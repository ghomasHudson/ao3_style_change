Okay. In my defense, this one is longer than normal. And more plotty.

Sherlock evaluates John’s cheeky grin. The smudges of blood on his shoulder where he cradled Sherlock’s head while the German’s wife rebuked their interference and he kisses him. Because no one surprises Sherlock Holmes like John Watson. The inside of John’s mouth is velvety and warm. Breathe. Slow. Quick, quick. Slow. More breathing, less kissing. Just John’s lips on his lips and
It’s too much. It’s way too much.
If John may coin a phrase, shit just got real.
“Nope.”
Then skin.
“John, um.” Sherlock opens and closes his mouth. Fiddles with the ear plugs, vaguely aware that he should not tell John he wasted his money because he’s smiling his proud smile. Sherlock is struck with the irrational desire to hug him. So he leans forward, arms stiff, and his elbows feel very awkward right now. Pat-pat John’s back. On the verge of retreating when John wraps his arms around his shoulders. He smells of mulled wine and comfort. Sherlock couldn’t ask for anything more disgustingly perfect.
Sherlock is already laughing.
Sherlock bristles. Fury threatens to overrule the schooled expression on his face, dictate his hands, but he’s already tapping the tabletop agitatedly. His dander is rising to critical levels. He has to speak. Unleash, lest hateful words wither and die in his chest and he’ll have to dig them out of his throat later, petrified insults sticking to his esophagus and a seven percent solution will ease his suffering, but he can’t. He can’t do that anymore. Sherlock opens his mouth, the muscles in his shoulders ape the ebb and flow of Violin Concerto #1. A string of deductions, rapid-fire and unforgiving. One after another. Legato. He doesn’t take a breath: “You’ve been engaged to marry twice before. You broke it off. Both times, if I’m not mistaken. The first unlucky bastard you seduced and dumped was a menial laborer, probably construction, and his job embarrassed you, yes, because you deserve better. Isn’t that what your mother always told you? That you deserve better? Shame she didn’t take her own advice. Father a sot, died of liver cancer three—no—four years ago. Irrelevant. You were in love with your second fiancé, but he cheated on you. Men are all the same. And your pride. Wounded because look at you. Nice figure, smart, sexy. All those praises your girlfriends have erroneously bestowed on you over the years. So now you’ve fixed your sights on John. A good man with a good job and relatively handsome by your standards, but he isn’t good enough, is he? He lives with a flatmate—an attractive flatmate, you think—and he’s at my beck and call. I am not the jealous one, Ms. Morstan. You are.”
“Bored.”
“Do you know you do that out loud?”
“Oi!” Dimmock throws a joint boot at them. “No flirting at crime scenes! You promised!”
Sherlock’s mind is whirring, his eyes darting from the livers to the ventilation to every nook and cranny, long legs carrying him from one end of the freezer to the other. Irritated. John imagines he’s quite warm, working himself up like that.
have an announcement. To make.” Picks up his wine glass. “First, I’d like to thank Angelo. A fine man. A damn, fine man.”
Not a reprimand. Not blaming Sherlock for living day in and day out with the burden of another human being branded on the backs of his eyelids, bloodied face tormenting him in the dead of the night. No, it’s an endorsement. John believed in him. Believed he wasn’t the fake he said he was. Believed he didn’t commit suicide.
John holds him steady. Warm. Bright.
Sherlock refuses to budge.
“I could die, John.”

Sherlock touches John’s shoulder. “The victim was stabbed here.” Trails his fingers down John’s side. Fishes around for the hem of his t-shirt. Tugs it loose, sliding his hand under John’s belly. John’s eyes snap wide open. Arches his back a little so Sherlock can reach his abdominals. “Here.” Sherlock rolls John over. Methodic and slow and sexy as hell. “And here.” Dragging his hand down John’s thigh. Squeezes tight. Leans in close to whisper, “No vital organs damaged. I would suppose that we’re looking for a medical man, but the wounds bear signs of hesitancy and insufficient practice with the scalpel found at the scene of the crime.”
John hesitates.
John does.
“No.”
Sherlock flexes his theatrical muscles, flinging the offending phalange in John’s lap the moment he sits on the coffee table, a pair of tweezers in hand.
“Gladstone. I was three years old. Almost four. He bit me. A woman came to take him away. I remember standing at the front door, crying. I didn’t want him to go.”
Sherlock liberates a handful of innocuous pages of text. Stuffs them in his pocket. “Come on, we’re leaving.” He swirls his coat like a bloody thespian.

“What are you doing?”
John opens his mouth to speak, but he can’t. He won’t. Not yet. Of the hallucinations that plague his waking eyes,
They leave at noon, deliciously sleep deprived.
Sherlock tunes her out. He tunes the night out. The tunes himself out until there's nothing left but a single thought.
“What?”
An indignant huff. “Why are you doing this?”
John relaxes under Sherlock’s ministrations. Sherlock familiarises himself with John’s eyebrows, his eyelashes, the helix of his ear. Mouth and tongue and he breathes out and out some more, dizzily marking John with shapeless words, airy promises. John gasps; “oh”s and “ah”s ghosting against Sherlock’s neck. Their knees knocking. Brushing. And Sherlock’s kneeling between John’s legs. His back undulates, one vertebra at a time. John braces his shoulders against the chair, lifting his bottom out of the seat just so he can reach.
John elbows him.

So John does. Gentle nails scratching against his scalp. He rubs errant curls between his fingertips. Tugs a little when Sherlock pesters him with guttural noises, lips pressed against John's jugular notch. Tongue dipping inside. Teeth against skin.
“No,” Sherlock bites. If John weren’t immobilizing his left hand, he would swaddle himself in his robe and curl in the fetal position. “My reinstatement

Sherlock ignores her. He’s standing at the fireplace, face angled toward the ceiling. He would sprawl on the sofa, but it’s likely his transport will refuse to get back up once he lies down. He rocks on the balls of his feet, rhythm, humming under his breath.

John knows nothing of art, but he thinks the way Sherlock’s mind works is beautiful.
Sherlock is inert. Boneless. Undone beneath the weight of the conviction in John’s eyes. Can’t promise him anything. That’s not the way the world works. He says as much as he drowns, eyes closed, head lolling from the pressure and the pain and the pleasure and—

. Sherlock squirms. The pressure amassing, threatens to consume him. The tipping point. Sherlock braces himself, teetering on the brink of feelings and emotions he never let himself succumb to before John.
Sherlock clutches John’s shirt in his hands. “Oh?” Strives for nonchalance. Misses by a mile. Breathless. Beguiled.
John makes a thoughtful noise that drives Sherlock distracted. “Gladstone?”
“Need a thief to catch a thief. Need a doctor to fool a doctor.” Sherlock puckers his lips to better assist John’s meticulous application. John has never given much thought to the amount of detail Sherlock devotes to his disguises. It’s so simple, on the outside looking in. A change of clothes. A bit of product in his hair. But it isn’t just the outfit or the makeup. It’s the way Sherlock carries himself, the way he speaks. John firmly believes that if Sherlock weren’t the world’s only consulting detective, he would be an actor. “Culverton Smith killed his nephew. I know he did. He
John stows his purchase in the fruit and veggie compartment. He smiles ear to ear.

I rest my case.”
“Yes.”
Sherlock spends exactly ten minutes more than usual preening in his bedroom. Not a second more even though his hair refuses to cooperate, damn it. At twelve on the dot, he meets John on the landing. He’s irrationally pissy, surges of adrenaline causing his insides to squirm, his heart to palpitate, his palms to sweat. John is dressed to the nines. (

The movie stops abruptly. Members of the cinema staff make a beeline for their seats. Shine flashlights at them unnecessarily. “Gentleman, I’m going to have to ask you to leave.”

. Sherlock’s eyes find his, then. Black as night and shining like the stars themselves are nestled within. A whole galaxy of supernovas and dark matter. Sherlock lets him see, then. Everything. And he wonders what his eyes hold, knowing good and well the depth of loyalty and love pouring from his soul is brimming there, ready to spill over.
This makes John angry. (
“Ready?” John asks.
“Bedroom?”
“Oh, good, you follow.”
This strikes Sherlock square in the chest for no reason whatsoever. John is washing dishes in the sink because
Sherlock is ten. He tugs at the bowtie around his neck. Resents Mycroft for aging another year. Resents the guests invading their home to pay him unnecessary deference for achieving nothing except enduring the passage of time. Polite laughter, a mishmash of conversation orchestral tuning to Sherlock’s ears. Nowhere near as beautiful, but fascinating in its own right.
“No. Stupid, stupid,” Sherlock bites. If John weren’t currently immobilizing his left hand, he would swaddle himself in his robe and curl in the fetal position, perfectly illustrating his puerile petulance. “What if I trip and fall and break my neck and I can’t reach my phone?”
Sherlock freezes. Surmounting dread like a cold shower in the deepest of deep space.
“Opportunist,” Sherlock reminds him, frowning. Gestures to John’s chair fussily and then drapes his arm across his face.
The room reverberates with whoops, groans, and whistles in equal measure.
and John hits send before he can cancel the message.
Sherlock looks disgusted. “Far be it from me to correct you in your area of expertise, John, but let me assure you. I’m not a necrophiliac.”
Sherlock shoves the pillow in his face. A tactical error because John wrests it from him easily enough and now there's nothing at all between them, is there? Stupid, stupid!
“Wha—no. Not yet.”
John bins his dinner. They make for Baker Street, falling in stride. Before they leave the park, John stops Sherlock with a quiet “Um.” and his eyes are trained on the kinky rabbit somewhere to the right of Sherlock’s ear. “Thank you. For.” John shoves his hands in his pockets. “Coming.” A pause, pregnant with implications. “And dinner, of course.”
John finally--
“God, you fascinate me,” Sherlock whispers with conviction, edging closer. If ‘
Two weeks down, eleven to go.

List of words is getting very long so I'll stop noting them here for now.
Sherlock does not believe in love. He believes in John Watson.
To Dr. Rei’s credit, she finishes stitching the gash on John’s brow before she asks Sherlock to return to the reception area. Not that he follows her orders. No. Why would he do that? All thunderous fury and well-lit angles. He takes John’s head in his hands. Examines Dr. Rei’s (

Sherlock periodically sweeps the flat for bugs, courtesy his elder brother. Cameras, mics, you name it. John watches him circumnavigate the room like a well-dressed force of nature. On the coffee table, off the bookshelf, leaping from one chair to another. A thought occurs to John during Sherlock’s invasion-of-privacy temper tantrum, and he asks, “Did you play Don’t Touch The Floor when you were little?”
“Second…” John will not instruct Sherlock how to go about kissing a lunatic. “Just think about murder. You’ll be fine.”
, and John for John. It was enough, at the time, to ascertain that John was his closest friend—a friend worth sacrificing his reputation for, his calling in life for, his very purpose on this earth for. The nights he laid awake on the other side of the world, contemplating what in the hell persuaded him to give up the opportunities to prove his cleverness for one man. One man with a psychosomatic limp and trust issues. It nearly knocked the breath out of him, chiseling away the excuses and the lies guarding his shriveled, little heart. It scares him shitless to think what he won’t do for John.
John unzips his fly. He brings himself to completion with the same hand that conducted Sherlock’s climax.
John looks at Sherlock, who’s pretending he hasn’t noticed a single thing. (
It’s a good choice, really. Because when they commit to a relationship, Sherlock loves to leave John keening (Loudly.) in the wake of a well-issued whisper.
. The smell of sugar and leather ripe in John’s nose, and he wants to taste. Needs to taste. And he’s on him, open-mouthed and breathing in and in and
Sherlock’s toes curl. He crosses his legs so John won’t notice.
John smiles softly. Murmurs in his ear. “I can’t stop this.” Suckles Sherlock’s earlobe, but Sherlock buries his face into the carpet again when it starts to tickle and John allows him to escape without a fight. Devotes himself to the back of Sherlock’s neck once more. “I can’t stop touching you. I’m—“ John laughs. “I think I’ve tapped you out.”
Sherlock is not a romantic.
John folds his arms across his chest. Clears his throat. “Explain.”
“Why did John fall off the swing?” is Sherlock’s rejoinder.
“What’s that?”
“Wait ‘til I tell Mrs. Turner!”
Romantic gestures, words of affirmation, terms of endearment. Discarded, left fermenting in the deepest and darkest reservoirs of Sherlock’s hindbrain.
“You’re not fine! You’re clearly the antithesis of fine!”
Sherlock pushes himself over and on top of and looking down at John. He’s smiling that predatory smile John associates with serial killers or that one time Molly text Sherlock about a body in the morgue. Situs inversus. Sherlock’s jealousy, coveting the inversion of internal organs because then their hearts would beat against one another, wouldn’t they? Lying like this?
) Sherlock apparently doesn’t give a toss. That or he’s deleted all traces of self preservation because he's panting from the heat like air hunger doesn’t faze him in the slightest.
“Oh.” John shuffles his feet. Pokes at some loose gravel on the pavement with the cane he doesn’t know what to do with. “You’re very, uh, good.” John cringes.
, to rip the sensation out of his body. No, Sherlock wants more. More is better. More is good. He pulls John closer. And closer John remains.
“Our people,” Sherlock mumbles against his thumbs.
Sherlock shoots him a nasty look.
Sherlock steps closer. Considers his words carefully. “Everything.” It’s barely a whisper. A promise. And a cheeky grin to top it all off.
John feels guilty. A little. But the sneaking and secret planning are incredibly titillating.

(So primarily women. But John isn’t sexist.) The contestants created the most insane, the most innovative dresses and coats and real people don’t think like that.
He doesn’t care how long it takes.
They scramble out of the coffin in naught but their knickers. Lestrade offers Sherlock his overcoat, John his suit jacket, awkwardly respecting their privacy while he phones for an ambulance. “Just…” He’s at a loss. “…just stay where you are.” Greg excuses himself, his mobile pinned against his ear.
Sherlock breezes through the kitchen.
“You okay?” When Sherlock doesn’t answer, he hazards a guess, “Mycroft?”
“Don’t tell me she—“
“Tuesday.”
Sherlock’s glower is ferocious. “Get out.”
“What’s that?”
John raises an eyebrow.
Gobsmacked? Yes. That’s what he is. Gobsmacked. Sherlock doesn’t know how to respond. John is a friend. He enjoys going out with John. Having fun with John is never boring. So why can’t he draw the necessary oxygen into his lungs in order to answer
The air is suddenly different. Sherlock is electric. Magnetic. Charged particles like an aura, blanketing John’s person with heart-racing, adrenaline-stimulating euphoria. John loves him, he loves him, he loves him. And Sherlock loves him back. Whatever Sherlock has in mind, John is up to the challenge. After last night, after everything. John sighs, his hands on Sherlock’s waist, and they fit together like skeletal bones. Ball and socket, hinge, pivot. Sherlock breathes in, John breathes out. So good. It’s so good and
John’s stomach rolls pleasantly.

The turning point. The realization. The fourth movement of a symphony. Allegro, maybe? Hell if he knows. Sherlock would. He would know. John makes a mental note to ask him later and the very idea of
“Big baby.” Readies his weapon of choice.
Sherlock does not. He’s too busy toying with John’s frenulum.
It’s John who elects to play mascot. It’s the least he can do, Sherlock decked out in not only a deerstalker but also buttons and whistles and the plasticized grin he wears when he actually envies a member of the criminal classes. Twenty crotch-dumplings are gazing at him in wide-eyed wonder.

John can sense Sherlock’s intent to disengage before he can take a step back. He tightens his hold. Just a bit. Almost imperceptible. But not imperceptible to Sherlock Holmes.
“We could always switch places,” Sherlock says offhandedly. Like it’s an option. But no. No way in hell. Not only would Sherlock fail to protect his modesty, John would have to simultaneously pretend to paint Sherlock’s pale arse while deducing who in their right mind is plotting to lure Sherlock into a windowless van and
Sherlock shakes him off. Pulls John down against him. Kisses his lips. Exploring every tooth, the palate of his mouth, his tongue. John whispers Sherlock’s name:
“Yes, well. Come here.” Reaches for Sherlock. A hand on the back of his neck. The crinkle of receipts under their knees.
Sherlock pours two glasses of wine. Because that’s what one does, apparently, when one is rich enough to get drunk in a bathroom that can rival the magnificence of Taj Mahal. It hits John that he’s sharing a bath with Sherlock Holmes. On their honeymoon. John’s not one to believe in parallel universes, or maybe he is. Because right here and right now seems highly improbable. Until Sherlock sticks his foot in John’s face. Wiggles his toes. Silently asking John to either
. So agonizing. After weeks of over analyzing everything from their mid-morning conversations to the way John styled his hair, enough was enough.
There’s an eighty-five percent chance that what John really means is,
“You mean Ringwraith.”
Sherlock supposes.
No lobsters were harmed in the writing of this drabble.
Sherlock isn’t someone John would consider brimming with holiday spirit so he’s gobsmacked when he finds Billy the skull dressed as Santa on the eve of Christmas. “What’s this?” John sips his wine wile he totters in front of the hearth, waiting for Jeanette.
“Hell, no,” Sherlock scoffs. “She drove after them herself. In Father’s car.”
No ifs ands or buts about it. If John were the poetic type, which he isn’t, he would liken his flatmate to a gazelle, a swan, or maybe another creature in the animal kingdom that doesn’t make him sound like bloody a ten-year-old girl when he entertains these kinds of thoughts in his head.
They smile.
Sherlock might be boggling now. “Pursue me?”
They lounge, John listening to Sherlock’s unencumbered brilliance and Sherlock listening to John breathe. They stare at the ceiling, chests rising and falling in perfect harmony, and John imagines they’re star-gazing.
Sherlock snaps, “Hurry up!”
Undeterred by John’s humbling commentary, Track42 has a flattering number of plays by the end of the week.
Sherlock’s mobile lands on top of John’s coat because Sherlock is kissing him again. Rattling the door on its hinges.

Sherlock raises his eyebrows. “Safeword is exactly what I mean.”
“No.”
Sherlock is confused. Which doesn’t happen very often.
Sherlock thinks viciously. He keeps his mouth shut. This once. Because the reward is far more important than laying into ‘Reggie’ for wasting his time, Jesus Christ.
John jolts in his seat. Didn’t realize he’d closed his eyes. His head throbs and his body screams at him to just
“My boredom reaching heretofore unimaginable heights,” Sherlock replies.
“I’m afraid I would keep you anyway,” Sherlock blurts. He’s surprised to hear himself divulge this heretofore heavily guarded secret. A bit not good. Admitting he would hold John hostage against his will. Because he would. Or not. Probably not. But he’d try. For a while. Maybe. Sherlock swallows his uncertainty. It tastes like mercury. Vexed and impatient, he snaps, “Say something.”
John grins at him, unduly proud of Sherlock’s thoughtfulness. If sparing the soles of his
John brushes his lips against Sherlock’s ear. “You’re amazing,” he tells him.
“Y-Yeah, okay.” John licks his lips. Sherlock is admiring (in as much Sherlock admires anything), John’s (frankly) bland selection. “I’m hanging up, now.” So he does.
John can’t think for all the

John Watson is cerulean.
The building goes up in flames. Sherlock breathes in. Fear gripping his heart. Sharp and icy and he stands alone in the middle of the street. Lost. Confused. Because this can’t be happening. This absolutely cannot be happening.
When management catches wind of their departure, a frazzled hotelier asks Sherlock why he's checking out early, wringing his hands and pulling at his weak mustache. John flags down a taxi. Loads their luggage in the boot.
“You know what I mean.”
“I loathe Christmas.” Sherlock abandons his violin. Makes a detour en route to his bedroom. Plucks a shiny, silver star from the box of ornaments and promptly wedges the sparkly abomination inside one of his erlenmeyer flasks. Cracks an evil smile of his own—he has three, total—and proceeds to get dressed.
“Don’t care,” John interrupts him from halfway inside the oven. “I don’t care,” he says upon standing, “what you have to say about her or me or anything because tonight is going to be perfect and you. You, Sherlock,” John jabs a finger at him, “are going to behave yourself.”
“He’s one hundred years old or something.”
They fall asleep on the couch in the middle of
Still. He feels the weight of their eyes on his cane. The unasked questions. War and death don’t belong here. He’s not even sure
“Does he?” John bends down. Nudges Sherlock’s face with his nose until their mouths meet. Kisses him chastely, the sound of their lips parting, touching. Sherlock’s heart vacates his chest, tries to find a new home in his throat. It’s mildly uncomfortable. Sherlock doesn’t like it. Except not really. Because it’s fascinating. Hasn’t felt this way before. Hasn’t been rendered speechless before. Breathless. Wanting more of something legal, something good, something alive. “He didn’t threaten to break me if I break your heart, did he?” John kisses Sherlock again. A little kiss. Gentle, sipping shallowly at Sherlock’s lips. Barely there.
John can barely contain himself. Gasps, “It’s, um…”
Doesn’t realize he’s speaking aloud.
Sherlock and John sprawl out on the dais. They stretch their arms and legs at their leisure. Giggling inappropriately.
John convinces Sherlock they need to keep their blood pumping. They sway back and forth stiffly and John is suddenly nostalgic. Secondary school, dancing with a girl he fancied, his two left feet. John wonders if Sherlock participated in anything as ordinary as a school dance. He wonders if Sherlock even knows how to dance. Not ballroom dancing, dancing-dancing. He can’t picture it. But he pictures Sherlock in mauve very easily.
“She jumped to conclusions.”
“I’m a doctor, but I’m not a chiropractor.”

While his nose isn’t broken, blunt trauma has blackened both of Sherlock’s eyes. He routes around inside the freezer for the bag of thumbs he liberated from Bart’s morgue. Presses the frozen digits against his face.
John kisses him. And Sherlock doesn’t know why.
Sherlock is not impressed.
Please note I know nothing about Britain's legal system. Also, the last line is a reverse/repeat from Chapter 15: Skull.
Sherlock sees red. “John!”
"Guilty."
“Why she bothered to have someone stab her more than once.”
Sherlock hums noncommittally. The shit.
He broods while John uses the last of the beeswax around his chin. “Listen…I…” John fights a smile. “Thank you. For letting me in on this one.”
“Mhm.” From thumb to pointer, from pointer to middle. Circle, circle, stop. Sherlock’s ring finger touching the center, recognizable impression and apparent interest beginning to turn John on in more ways than one. “I’m brilliant, but not that brilliant.”
More. John’s worth it.
“Wh—“ John giggles. “Dr. Joseph Bell?”
John licks his lips. His voice is husky when he says, “Mm. Keep going.”
Fuck. That voice.

John emerges from the bath, his tartan robe belted tightly around his waist. Soap and aftershave and the scent of balmy skin. He mock-salutes Sherlock. Sits in his chair with an indulgent groan. After six hours of reconnaissance, a foot chase, and an onslaught of goose droppings, John is milking the conclusion of their most recent case for all its worth.
“Wow.” John massages his wrists. Stands up straight. “You’re incredible.”
“Hyoid?”
"Please, John. Close your eyes. You have to maximize your visual memory. I need you to describe--"
I have slightly underestimated how time consuming my brother’s wedding next weekend will be. Updates sporadic for the remainder of June.

John is in the kitchen. He’s doubled over against the table trying not to crack a rib stifling his laughter. “What was that noise?” he asks casually.
“I remember,” Sherlock mutters.
Sherlock drops his mobile from his supine position on the couch directly on his face. But that’s not the funny part. No, the funny part is when he leaves the phone flat against his forehead like he meant to lose his grip all along. Just lies there, his nose whistling from the impact, and his hand descends to rest upon his belly, as elegant as anything.
Sherlock fixes that, as he’s so inclined. Epiphanies coagulating on the tip of his tongue, battering the backs of his teeth like a ram. Ostentatious. He never could keep his revelations to himself. He certainly can’t now that there’s a cognizant being sharing rooms with him. It’s John’s fault if he’s out cold when Sherlock is being particularly brilliant.
The ball is in her court.
“Yeah, but you and me? Like this? All you.”
Sherlock shuts his eyes tight. Preserving the raw twinge John leaves behind. Wavers where he sits. John holds his face in his hands. Watery laughter dancing in Sherlock’s ears. “You look like shit.”
Sherlock should have known archetypal platitudes would mean little to the man who is ending him.
“Got back early. You didn’t notice. Obviously.”
Sherlock breathes out. Half drags, half carries John away from the fiery remains of Mr. Wilson’s pawnshop. Practically throws him to the ground on the opposite side of the road.
“You don’t have to stay, you know. It’s fine. Go back to work.”
Sherlock eyes John wryly. Then he nuzzles closer. Breathes in John’s scent. “How do you feel about bees?” he asks in John’s oversensitive ear.
“Why not?” is John’s response. Settles in, which involves elbows and knees and as urbane and tactile as John has proven to be in the past, their couch is only so big.
Pain. Loss. Suffering.
John is resting his chin in his hand, his elbow on the table. Staring at nothing until Sherlock bodily interferes. Can’t stare into space when space is occupied by the torso of Sherlock Holmes.
he texts back.
Pianist fingers calculating the exponential curvature of his elbow. “What is your first memory?” His voice so soft, so private. John’s breath hitches.
“What?”
Drags his knuckles across rib number six. Drags the ring across rib number six.
He should buy John a ring. Yes, something that makes a statement. Mine, mine, mine. Sherlock, Sherlock, Sherlock. Property of Sherlock Holmes. Do not trespass: violators will be persecuted. Would John prefer silver or gold? Diamonds or moissanite? Contacts in the fine jewelry business; Jean Carlo owes him a favor.
“Lives are at stake,” Sherlock lies.
Sherlock gives him a look.
—the chair topples over.
Sherlock opens the door a crack. Doesn’t let him in.
"John," Sherlock threatens him. Holds a pillow against his chest to ward off another attack.
Sherlock is hiding a smile. John can see it. Tucked in the left-hand corner of his mouth. “When?” He knows bloody well when, but John indulges him anyway.
“Because Sherlock will find you,” John adds, his voice muffled from inside the bulldog head.
Sherlock still hasn’t figured out how John reads his mind. His deduction skills are piss-poor at best.
Flushed and perspiring beneath the sheets of John’s bed. A cocoon of linen. Safe and sound in a tangle of limbs and a nest of pillows and discarded clothing. John loves him thoroughly, attentively, casing Sherlock’s lean frame beneath his body. Extols him past the point of no return with
And maybe they are. Sherlock can't tell. Not while he's spinning farther and father away.
Molly offers Sherlock the keys. He thanks her with a gentle kiss on the cheek. “You are indispensable,” he says. Hops into the driver’s seat and sheds his tux coat. “Come on, John. We’re losing daylight.”
“Mmm.” Sherlock’s voice is staid, monotonous. Not having yet accepted the fact that he’s embarrassed himself. And maybe he never will because he doesn’t do embarrassment. He’s resigned, though. Resigned to the fact hat John takes pleasure in his pain. (
courses through his veins.
“The concept of timing must be foreign to you.” John idly scratches behind his ear, ducking his head. His face is ruddy from blushing.
John does no such thing. He makes Sherlock a cup of tea he probably won’t drink, but it’s the thought that counts. Glances from the Kiss N’Tell mobile prescribed to Hyoid, to Sherlock, to the mobile again. John has never seen Sherlock outright fail at something before. He’s a very proficient man. Capable of acclimating to a wide variety of situations when necessary. He learned to drive within minutes, his personas are immaculate, and he even cooked John an edible, hot meal when John was sick with the Flu. He’s good at everything he sets his mind to. Except, apparently, phone sex.
Sherlock points. “This is heliotrope. That’s purple.”
Sherlock knows.
Sherlock has studied love for the purpose of navigating its convoluted justifications and breakable vows of monogamy. Love is a vicious motivator. The masses fall in and out of it, trying on new partners like trying on new outfits to wear. What he has with John isn’t love. It’s
“Go away.” Sherlock shoos her off. “I’m done with you.”
Sherlock smiles so hard it hurts his face. Tries to sound casual. He hopes John doesn't hear the unquantifiable glee tickling the back of his throat. John isn't hurt. Doesn't sound hurt. He sounds breathelss. Excited. (
“You’re awake,” Sherlock gasps. “What do you remember?”
“The victim.”
John finds Sherlock’s disengaged tone of voice kind of sad.
Sometimes, their schedules coincide to create an aforementioned lazy morning. Sherlock requires John’s audience and John tolerates Sherlock’s barging in on him because his circadian rhythms are somewhat composed, a string of late nights notwithstanding.
Sherlock cries, his hands desperate in John’s hair, swaying with every rise and fall of John’s restricted thrusts. The cuffs of his shirt mancle his wrists.
smile. Sherlock has successfully nailed and butchered obscure and famous quotes alike. He finds this incredibly charming. “Second star,” John murmurs.
Of course he does. It’s obvious. So obvious it’s painful and Sherlock can’t help but curl his lip in response. Mycroft sits opposite him in John’s chair. Legs crossed, umber sock garters just visible up his trouser leg. Makes Sherlock want to break something. Of Mycroft’s, preferably. John would not appreciate finding a mess upon his return from the shops.
John finds his voice and says, “Bird’s gay.”
Sherlock shoves his kit in John’s arms. “Keep watch. He’ll realize his mistake in a moment.”
Sherlock grabs his violin.
“Victim showed signs of bruising...” John objects mutely when the warm weight of Sherlock’s hand abandons its post. Skims across the drawstring of his pajama bottoms, catching his thumb on the hem of John’s t-shirt again. Flicks his wrist. Rides up his stomach, exposing his midsection. Sherlock drags his knuckles across John’s ribcage, the crook of his arm, and caresses his wrist. “…here.” Then the other. “And here. The chafing indicates she was bound with nylon rope. Victim says her husband, wearing a toboggan, eyeholes cut into the material. That’s important, John. He attacked her. Knocked her down on the floor.” Sherlock straddles John on his knees. Pins his arms against the bed, repositions his hands against the headboard. “Like so. But it couldn’t have been her husband.”
“Angelo’s?” Sherlock asks. What he means is,
“Bender.”
“Two to three? I hate to break it to you, but your homicide-to-case ratio is at least sixty five.”
It’s strange seeing Sherlock at the cinema. He doesn’t have the patience to sit still and watch anything exceeding the length of a YouTube video, let alone a film over two hours long. But, damn it, John’s tried to see a movie by himself and Sherlock always—
John blinks. "Treasure?"
There is no definition for
, John can’t decide if he’s lost his mind or if Freud was right. There really is such a thing as a Death Wish and John is subconsciously risking his life.
Sherlock grips John’s hand tightly. “This is John. He’s mine. I found him.”
Mike grins smugly at John.
Sherlock tilts his head to one side, languid, cataloging everything and wrecked beyond belief. Watches his body quaver and move of its own accord, unashamed in its pursuit of John and John and
Gone.
“Hn,” is Sherlock’s response.
“You fell asleep.”
Sherlock watches John wrangle his hand from his trousers, soiled and glistening in the dim light of the hallway. He catches John’s wrist before John can wipe the evidence off on his jeans. He kisses John’s knuckles. Tongues at the delicate webbing between his fingers. Tastes the both of them together. Inhales their mingled scent.
John nibbles on a mozzerallea stick. “How did your parents meet?”
John tugs on the collar of Sherlock’s shirt and Sherlock stoops. Fully expects John to kiss him. Cliché. Romantic.
“Go on what?”
. John’s hand is sandwiched between Sherlock’s erection and his pelvis. John rolls his hips, an involuntary jerk, and a desperate “Oh, God…” A gush of precome oozes down the head of Sherlock’s cock, over John’s attentive fingers.
John smiles.
Admittedly, John does not have the best track record when it comes to responding to probing questions in an affable manner. He did his best, though. For Sherlock’s sake.
He knows why.
John’s socks of subsequently knocked off.
John stretches. Laces his fingers over his head. Concentrates on the beating on his heart, striking every joint, a resounding chorus of
Sherlock blinks at him.
John brushes a finger against the cleft of Sherlock’s ass. He jolts, his muscles seizing before he pumps his release into John’s hand.
John stops humming. Stops washing the dishes. Stutters at the contact, Sherlock’s hand at the small of his back. He closes his eyes.
John’s palms are crusted with dirt. Stained with blood. He doesn’t believe for one second Sherlock means what he implies. Dainty fingernails, glinting in the light of the moon. John flexes his hand, all but prepared for Sherlock to rescind his offer the moment John reaches for him. He’s pleasantly surprised when Sherlock fails to meet his expectations. He does not balk, does not flinch when John tentatively runs his fingers over the metacarpals of Sherlock’s lily-white hand, soiling his knuckles.
“John,” he manages. “
“I know you can act. Show me.”
He can, but he’s not going to. Sherlock makes a noncommittal noise John apparently enjoys because he homes in, yanking the lapel of Sherlock’s coat, and kisses Sherlock’s lips. Sherlock’s stomach rolls in surprise. Lazy, warm, shockwaves of pleasure radiating from his chest to the tips of his fingers. Instead of kissing John back, Sherlock asks into and around and on John’s mouth, “Really? Is this what we’re doing (
“I’ll get her,” Sherlock offers for absolutely no reason because why would he trouble himself when John is always so delightfully useful? Analogous mundane activities. Analogous is a funny word. It has anal in it. Logous. Pertaining to study. The study of arseholes. Yes. And what’s inside. Ha! Certainly not jam. No. Would have to be pudding. Chocolate pudding. What self-respecting anal would fill itself with vanilla pudding? “I’ll go get her,” Sherlock repeats himself.
“You’re the expert.” John brings a waxy paintbrush to Sherlock’s mouth. “Why aren’t you perfecting this disguise yourself?”
Sherlock supposes. He plucks the hindwings from the bee’s thorax.
John is the
“I think it looks good this way.”
Sherlock pays for John’s gift, shifting his weight from foot to foot. Itching to leave.
Months turned to years and John dated women. Sherlock can’t determine when
“Don’t
“Sherlock,” John warns.
“Oh, God, I’m—“ Sorry? Confused? An idiot? All of the above?
“I could eat,” John replies. What he means is,
“Or until you get bored.”
? He registers another comment, but the tips of his ears burn in righteous fury even before he’s cognizant of the recipient of their ignorance.
Relief like the night sky. Sherlock burns all the brighter for it.
Sherlock might be boggling now. “Pursue me?”
Sherlock blinks. And he—
He’s humming a tune Sherlock recognizes. One of his scores. Mediocre, Sherlock thinks, but John seems to be enjoying himself.
221B. Just as he left it.
Sherlock wishes he didn’t find John’s conduct so charming. It’s inconvenient. “You’re inconvenient,” he grumbles.
Sherlock depends on John. Relies on him, reflexively, like he relies on his cardiovascular system to carry blood cells and nutrients through his body. John is Sherlock’s reason for living. Saccharine and sordid and true, unfortunately. Give the man a puzzle and watch him dance. Give the man a friend and watch him die for three years.
It occurs to Sherlock that John is upset. It irks him that John is wasting valuable bee larva/morphine amalgamation time with his impermissible feelings. It also occurs to Sherlock that if he takes it upon himself to engage John in an empathetic manner, his wobbly will pass and Sherlock can get back to work. And John can listen. Because Sherlock is benevolent like that.
He’s blushing.
John laughs. “What’s a man like you doing on a plane like this?”
. Which, if John’s interpreted Sherlock’s sentiment correctly, means their relationship hasn’t plateaued since its consummation. It’s Sherlock’s way of saying John isn’t boring.
John’s head is resting on Sherlock’s chest. He feels ridiculous, but incrementally warmer than before. He’s having a hard time caring about the heteronormative voice having a stroke somewhere in his hindbrain because it’s fine, really. It’s all fine. “Why would I’ve danced with a man?” A beat of silence. “Have y-you danced with a man?”
Doesn’t matter who said it. Or why they said it. He acknowledges their derision and the moniker, in its feeble attempts to break skin, merely dissipates in the frigid air. Sherlock closes his eyes. Sniffs again. Oceanic fragrance.
“That. Has got to be the worst punch line ever.” John is in tears.
“Anywhere.” Sherlock bites his lip. Releases it slowly. Swollen and wet. “Do it.”
John giggles. “I can’t tell. Is that a smoldering look or is he constipated?”
It’s the most beautiful thing John has ever seen.
John’s mouth goes completely dry.
John touches Sherlock’s hands. Eases them apart. Fingernails leaving crescent moons on his skin. “You would keep me?”
That’s all. Just. Him.
Sherlock waits until John is dozing before he says, “You find me attractive when I’m dirty.”
“Well,” he hums. “Thank you for that.”
Sherlock adjusts his posture. Long legs and bent elbows and tilting his hat forward over his eyes. He snaps his fingers.
Sherlock processes this new information. John can feel his body reacting to the stimulus of fresh data. “A few? Who?”
“No!” Sherlock is quick to deny his mounting ennui. Too quick. “You’re doing…well. Really well. And.”
“Why?” John tries to turn around in his chair, but Sherlock stops him with a firm hand on his shoulder.
“Yes.”
“There is nothing more tedious,” Sherlock drones, reciting the oft-repeated anthem of his supposedly mind-numbing existence. “than knowing
John and Sherlock take their seats. Sherlock is making a very unappealing face at the floor, where his shoes are kind-of sort-of sticking in a
“Is this the part where I invite you upstairs for coffee we have no intention of drinking?” Sherlock invades John’s personal space and John closes his eyes, titillating Sherlock with his blind trust. Breath mingling in the night. Streetlights and headlights like mandorlas in the accumulating fog, twinkling in Sherlock’s periphery.
“So the question is…” John nuzzles Sherlock’s neck. Breathes, “…who really attacked the wife?”
I'm not dead! It's only the fist week of the season and I can't keep my eyes open. I'll do my best.
“John,” Sherlock whispers. John wonders to hear him speak at all. “What are we doing?”
John kisses the corner of his mouth and Sherlock breathes him in. Doesn’t kiss him back, just breathes. Parting his lips. A taste. A little taste. An electrical shock. Ventricular fibrillation. Isn’t used to the cloying need of reassurance. Steals his breath even as John restores it. “I would let you go,” Sherlock admits, chest heaving. Doesn’t realize he’s told the truth until after he speaks the words on John’s tongue. Genuine surprise, a gasp of regret. Or delight. He’s not sure. Why would he do that? Why would he let John go if John wanted to leave?
“What about it?”
“If the floor is lava,” Sherlock says, redistributing his weight so that’s he’s straddling John’s lap, his bony feet digging into John’s thighs. “Then you’ve lost your legs.”
Sherlock is clinging to John’s jumper. They’ve disturbed their work.
Sherlock Holmes is baked. Smashed. Ripped. Fried. Toasted.
A week goes by. Neither of them discuss their engagement that’s technically two and a half years old. (Semantics.) John has no doubt in his mind they would have carried on as they had before, content with the knowledge of each other’s unwavering devotion, if not for Mycroft sticking his nose where it doesn’t belong.
. Folding over. John guides him to the floor only to assail him with renewed vigor. Ten fingers teasing and poking and driving Sherlock absolutely mad, tears in his eyes. John had no idea he was ticklish.
“Haven’t decided.” John wipes his mouth on a napkin too ornate to belong to either of them.
John is cold. And only slightly wet. And still smells of sewage. He cleans Sherlock's backside anyway. Can't decide if he's relieved Sherlock is who he always is or disappointed there actually won't be sex. Looks at the shower floor. Should invest in adhesive stickers if they ever have shower sex. Could be dangerous.
“Your reason is no reason.”
, which Sherlock finds wholly beside the point.
“Now you’re just taking the piss.” Sherlock fumes in quiet for exactly three minutes. “How do you propose we solve our dilemma?”
“I’m taking you with me, obviously.”
“No.”
Raining down and filling his head, his heart with repugnant doubt. Heavy. Heavier than the guilt he carried with him for three years. Maybe because keeping John Watson isn’t as altruistic as saving John Watson.
“Mrs. Hudson promised to keep an eye on you.”
As for love?
She tugs harder, her hand balled in a pudgy fist.
Sherlock leans forward in his seat. “Everything.”
“Since when are you interested in anything other than a puzzle?”
“God, yes.” John is lightheaded. It’s like an out of body experience and he’s dizzy with it. Inspiring Sherlock to maintain his rhythm with helpful little tugs on his belt loops.
Sherlock does and doesn’t understand the compulsion to avoid seclusion. He would say he empathizes, but empathy and he haven’t gotten on since Uni and damn it all to hell if he feels the need to try and rationalize the reasoning behind: “It’s not you, it’s me.”
“Points for burgling, but I’ll have to penalize you for execution.”
“Where are we? Where’s Catherine?”
“Gladstone. I was three years old. Almost four. He bit me. A woman came to take him away. I remember standing at the front door, crying. I didn’t want him to go.”
Suddenly sits up straight, dislodging John entirely. “That’s it!” Leaps off the bed and runs down the stairs. “You’re fantastic, John!” And it’s a little bit sad Sherlock’s praise still makes John’s blush like a teenaged girl. He’s got it bad for a mad genius, though, so he’s allowed to be soppy every now and then.
“Boring.”
. “Why are you laugh—laughing at me? You don’t laugh at me.” He heaves a sigh. “You’re a the beacon of Amon Dîn, you know. Third star to the right and straight on ‘til morning.”
“I’m—“
Sherlock lifts. John pulls down his bottoms. Rubs soap scum off his thighs. Out from between his toes. The rag is warm. Smells of sandalwood. John is also warm. Smells of good tilled earth and comfort.
Sherlock scoffs. “Nice. Nice is a word used to describe one of your dull acquaintances or your great aunt Silvia’s handmade doilies.” He taps a beat on the doorknob, his patience wearing thin. “John, you didn’t have to accompany me if that’s what you’re getting at.”
Could be dangerous.
“What? No! Of course not. I—“ And for no reason whatsoever, Sherlock’s ability to lie leaves him high and dry. He opens and closes his mouth before he finishes lamely with, “—want to borrow your stethoscope.”
Sherlock analyzes. Touches. Tastes. Kisses John’s scar. Fascination bright and scrupulous and burning John’s pleasure receptors at both ends. Hot. Smoldering. Sherlock diverts his ministrations to John’s neck, seamless. Every inch of John as absorbing as the next.
"You okay?" John asks. There's a wedding ring on his finger.
He will never resort to verbosity or wax poetic on the fine and/or coarse texture of John’s hair or calculate the logarithmic curve of his nose or wage war on his brain in order to define John Watson’s eye color. No. Why would he?
No wonder Sherlock’s so giddy. Idiocy is a double-edged sword as far as he’s concerned. Pains him to monitor the ignorance of others, slogging through daily life weighted down by normal people and their normal cognitive functions. But stupidity on a psychological level—stupidity significant enough to warrant further investigation—is the pigment to Sherlock’s binder. Without stupid people doing stupid things in stupid ways, his life would be much more dull. His mind cranks out masterpiece after masterpiece in the wake of stupid.
(See the end of the chapter for
. Shut him down
Tilts his head back. “Could say thank you.”
, he congratulates himself.
In this moment, John knows a single word--a single gesture--could disrupt the balance. So he chooses carefully, hoping beyond hope his next move will tip the scales in his favor. Maintaining eye contact, he readjusts his grip on Sherlock’s wrist. The pads of his fingers caressing Sherlock’s flexor tendons, mimicking the way Sherlock plays his violin. And just as Sherlock coaxes a tune from his Stradivarius, John’s touch causes Sherlock’s eyes to flutter shut.
, John?”
“You’re upset with me.”
John nods at the mess in the floor at Sherlock’s feet. “Mouse.”
“I don’t know.” John licks popsicle juice off his knuckle. “Never really thought about it.”
Sherlock recognizes the signs that he’s hyperventilating. Can’t stop. Out of his control. Everything is out of his control and John can’t leave him. He isn’t allowed. Sherlock is dying first; they’ve already discussed this. (
—so he grabs his coat and leaves for Bart’s, conveniently unsuspicious.
Sherlock closes his eyes.
“Mr. Holmes!” Mike claps a meaty hand on his back. “That’s him!” Gestures toward Deez with his rounded chin. “The groom!”
Late, but not too late!
For the longest time, this chapter read: His pants are neatly pressed. Because, yes. John Watson presses his pants.
When he gets home from work, John pokes at his supper with one of the few, clean forks available to him. “What did you do?”
John is confused. They’ve, what? Got a clear view of the back of his head? His shoulders?
“I know.”
Sherlock wraps his coat tightly around his midsection and props his knees against the vacant seat in front of him.
. Sherlock will not tell him so because he doesn’t know how. Can’t even articulate a decent idiom because gold doesn’t interest him, puzzles do, and puzzles only weigh heavy on Sherlock’s mind; the comparison is moot. It angers Sherlock that John regards himself poorly when he’s far more precious to Sherlock than any riddle, enigma, or murder the world has to offer.
Not lost-lost, John hopes. But definitely itinerant. It’s half one in the morning and Sherlock is staring at himself in the mirror over the fireplace. E-mails printed and taped to the mantelpiece. His eyes dart from one to another intermittently, hands pressed against his mouth. Otherwise, he doesn’t move. He hasn’t moved in so long John begins to worry. Sherlock needs to move, if nothing else. Not because standing in one place is bad for him, necessarily, but because it is.
Sherlock is not good at dating. Or dates. He finds them predictable. Tedious. Sherlock wouldn’t call himself a connoisseur, per se, but he’s disrupted enough of John’s half-arsed attempts to woo the fairer sex to have a good idea of what to expect. Dinner. A movie. Heinous.
Complementary to chapter 58: Elven.
There is nothing wrong with more.
Mycroft has a way of frowning with his entire body. Brow furrowed. Shoulders tense. Fingers tighten on the handle of his umbrella. “The risk of what?”
John stares at him. Keeps staring at him. Sets his glass down next to Sherlock’s. “I. That’s nice. Um. Of you to say.” Exhales a, “Thanks.”
FYI: I know it's Bieber, not Berber. Oh, those boys. Beetles and the Berber.
John will never ever admit how much Sherlock is turning him on right now.
“Very good.”
Sherlock’s face is possibly the cutest thing John has ever seen.
(See the end of the chapter for
Satisfied with John’s (wheezy) answers, Sherlock takes notes. Configures a flow chart that will knock John’s socks off.
.” John glances at Bird, the only member of the party left in the room besides John.
John chuckles, but Sherlock can hear his reservations loud and clear.
When Sherlock pouts, he wants everyone to know it. Doesn’t regulate a strop just to one room. Doors wide open, limbs strewn most inconveniently across the couch or the kitchen table or the bed, and if John dares to shut himself in the bedroom upstairs, Sherlock resorts to his violin.
John Watson is not angry. He’s dazed. More than a little confused. He tries. Desperately tries to reconfigure the grounds for his rage. “Why do you keep doing that? Stop doing that.”
“Sherlock.” John points. “Why is Billy covered in—I hope that’s candy.”
ad nauseam. Sherlock doesn’t know that John tolerated plenty of
Also, please note that it is ‘violators will be prosecuted’, not persecuted. Sherlock either doesn’t care to know the difference or he does know the difference and he prefers persecution.
“In case you’ve forgotten, us? We’re partners.”
John is living one week at a time these days.
, like needles prickling his shoulders, his neck.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Anderson scurries into his office.
Sherlock moves into position. On John’s, “Three!” he heaves the couch off the ground and John dives for the—
way. Sherlock’s chin brushing against John’s ear, Sherlock’s hips swaying to whatever music he’s conducting in his mind. Grumbling pissily and fits of rage subdued to mere tremors in his limbs and the belligerent stamping of his feet. Never once steps on John’s toes, though.
with me weeks ago. This is the third movie of the trilogy. Don’t sit beside me on the couch twenty minutes from the end and start asking questions.”
John presses his open mouth against Sherlock’s cheek. Bestows a particularly wet raspberry. Much to Sherlock’s…
“Watching a movie.”
Two of his classmates hold hands in the library. They’re both scouring the pages for Waldo, who isn’t all that hard to find, really. Sherlock doesn’t understand the appeal. He watches them closely anyway, his concentration divided between their interactions and the dead bee he found on the windowsill.
, as the flyer in John’s back pocket guarantees. Masochists survive the Tilt-O-Whirl, clinging to one another for support. Secret sweethearts are ushered from the Hall of Mirrors under penalty of arrest for indecent exposure.
, as John so eloquently ridiculed his pre-boredom turmoil earlier that morning.
“Oh, stop. You love the attention.”
Hard.
Sherlock can’t stand it. Absolutely cannot stand it. Wants to claw at his flesh, break open his body if only the pressure and the pain and the awful, awful, awful tepidity! Luke warm, spit it out of his mouth, but he can’t. He won’t. Because it’s John and he would suffer many deaths and resurrections and untold amounts of boredom if John will just…just.
Mary, however, was strictly unimpressed. The moment John was out of earshot, she accused Sherlock of being in love with his flatmate.
Sherlock draws himself to his full height. Towers over John. A reasonably low blow, all things considered. “Go on, then.”
“What about her?”
his voice betrays him.
Sherlock swallows. Exhales shakily. (
Crosses the room. A hand on Sherlock's arm.
Sherlock won’t open his eyes yet; John is rubbing his thumbs over his cheekbones. More pronounced, probably, since

“Anderson?”
Sherlock’s toes curl. He crosses his legs so John won’t notice.
Have some more Kid!lock.
He’s beginning to wonder if there was ever a time before Sherlock’s most recent case.
I apologize, yet again, for failing to update as planned. I will do my best to post chapters daily throughout Thanksgiving and Christmas. Thank you for your patience! Have some semi-angst!
Sherlock watches John plop the sombrero on top of the cow skull. “What are you doing?”

“Please tell me that’s not going on your blog.”
John has never been more embarrassed in his entire life. And he hasn’t even started undressing yet.
Sherlock has no intention of eating. As is his practice, he disrupted John’s evening with Ms. Magdalene, a fabricated narrative his excuse to trouble John for his opinion regarding a set of crime scene photographs. John, as is
John doesn’t like it. Except that he does. He’s not sure how he’s supposed to feel about the conflicting emotions Sherlock often inspires in him.
Amanda’s sanguine eyes are big and bright under the fluorescent lights.
“Um. I’m not...”
“Second, I—“ Like he suddenly remembers Sherlock is there. “—my date tonight.” John takes a swig of his Pinot. “We’ve been through a lot of shit and you drive me ‘around the bend, but I. Um. Marry me.”
Sherlock bounds up the stairs. Two, three at a time.
Sherlock and John celebrate by making a mess of the pavement.
Sherlock is just fine with that.
Lips puckering while Mycroft seeks blessed serenity to keep calm and carry on.
They feel each other smile. Bullet holes spackled with yellow spray paint.
“Penile amputation,” Sherlock elaborates evilly.
“Could be,” Sherlock purrs sensuously.
at me. Like it knows.”
The music is sweet. The movement of their bodies even sweeter. Barely. Going nowhere. John doesn’t mind. And neither, apparently, does Sherlock. He trails his fingers up, down John’s jumper. Feels him there with him. (Always with him.) They rock in tandem, breathe in tandem. “What are we doing, John?” Sherlock asks again.
"Thank you." Sherlock takes his seat. The Maid of Honor stands to give her speech.
frown. “So we’ve got…” Prods at the plastic (might as well call them) pustules. Filled with more screws than he can shake a stick at. “Big ones. Small ones. Medium sized ones. Bigger ones. Washers. These…squiggly bits.”
What?
“We should do it again sometime.”
John crosses his legs. Not loudly, but fussily, which might as well be loud for all its exaggeration.
“That’s what I call a Death Frisbee.”
John grabs his laptop. Prods at Sherlock’s legs until he makes room for John to sit down. “C’mon. We’re watching a movie.”
“How about last week? When you thought it was a good idea to light the Devil’s Foot Root on fire?”
“How are we supposed to get clean like this?” John asks Sherlock’s clavicle.
John hugs him, after.
They kiss. Lips brushing tentatively and,
“She’s a librarian, as evidenced by her keratosis pilaris. Two children, broke it off with her second husband over dinner at
“It would do wonders for your public image,” Victor says.
“I’m fine.”
John scowls. He sits back down amongst irate demands from the patrons. Sinks deep in his seat. What must people think? Two, grown men watching Twilight?
Sherlock firmly believes there is no possible way for John to feel as deeply and as destructively as Sherlock feels for John because John is a good man. An honest man. But there’s no doubt in his mind that it’s a mutual scintillation obscuring the truth from the both of them. And that’s okay for now. John’s okay.
John looks at Sherlock sitting there. Imagines a teenaged version of his best friend sulking under the covers of his bed.
Take that, aesthetics.
“What do you see, there?” Sherlock asks, pointing.
John shuts up.
. That’s what people—“
Sherlock and John make their getaway. The lift doors shut, muffling Anderson’s curses on their not-so-good names.
“I could kiss her.”
John patiently waits for Sherlock to make a decision.
“You’ve been in here over an hour.”
But he can’t rest yet. A killer is on the loose and somewhere in this swamp of seemingly meaningless correspondence is irrefutable proof Mr. Angels is none other than Miss Sutherland’s own father.
They can’t stop laughing once they’ve started and it takes John several attempts to free his arm from Sherlock’s trousers, which makes it even funnier. John clings to Sherlock for support. Shoulders shaking, eyes brimming with tears. John prefaces even more laughter with,
“Mmm, I dunno.
Next preview: Dark, teen love, angst, kissing in the rain.
“Oh, my God,” he hiccups. “Anderson’s going to be pissed.”
“I hate being tired.”
When John doesn’t show any signs of comprehension, Sherlock sighs. “I cleared the room on purpose. I needed a better view of the bar.”
On a happier note, your surprise is almost finished!
. Loudly.
"Victor?"
Sherlock sits. “The Decision of the Flower.”
Catches sight of John slipping something inside his stocking.
John is in the midst of a (he refuses to call it a) meltdown. His heart leaps into his throat when he hears Sherlock return. Practically in his mouth, on his lips when he says, “We don’t have to.” because he will not loose his best friend over cold feet.
John smiles tightly. Blinks at the ceiling. “See, this is what I don’t understand. Maybe you can explain it to me.” He turns. Faces Sherlock, a vision of thunder. “You’re dying first. You’ve established your right to kick the bucket before I do. Fine. But where do you
“What for?” Sherlock wants to know.
John waits fifteen minutes. You know. Just in case she excused herself to the loo. Or something. Another put-upon sigh. He just can’t win.
Sherlock’s glower is ferocious. “Get out.”
Sherlock is amused. John is irritated.
Sherlock shushes him. Bites down on his bottom lip to keep from grinning like an imbecile. But he has to admit. This is fun. More than fun. This is ideal.
“It’s not…” Sherlock hesitates the briefest of moments before adding, “…home.”
“What are you doing?”
"I'll join you." Sherlock removes his scarf. Toes off his soiled shoes by the door.
John never knows what to expect when Sherlock stoops to phoning him. The last time Sherlock made an outbound call on his mobile, a thug broke his thumbs trying to coerce Sherlock into revealing the location of a blue carbuncle. John’s stomach twists into knots just thinking about it. The sound of Sherlock’s quavering voice on the other end of the line…but not because he couldn’t handle the pain. No. It was because he wouldn’t be able to text for a few weeks. (
John is researching internet jargon. Trying to decipher some of the comments on his blog. What in the bloody hell are feels and why are some of Sherlock’s fans so intent on screaming casually? On the fence whether today’s youth are incredibly passionate or incredibly stupid.
John hates to tell him, “I don’t know.” Because if questions are a sign of affection, John’s answers need to deliver. Clears his throat. Heart skipping one beat. Two. “I’ll find out.”
Sherlock corners John in the bathroom as he’s brushing his teeth. “What are your favorite sexual positions?” While John’s spitting up his lungs, Sherlock reiterates, “This has absolutely nothing to do with a present. I’m asking because I’m curious.”
“My girlfriend wants to ride!” the skid mark on the pants of adolescent pubescence complains.
John’s hand wanders toward Sherlock. His fingers splay, almost as if he’s trying to reach him. Protect him. From bad dreams, from particularly painful memories that tend to raid his mind while his body is forced to recuperate.
, and maybe it is. A bit. "You're no better than Mycroft," John told him once. (Sherlock still hasn't forgiven him that particular transgression.)
The air is suddenly different. Sherlock is electric. Magnetic. Charged particles like an aura, blanketing John’s person with heart-racing, adrenaline-stimulating euphoria. John loves him, he loves him, he loves him. And Sherlock loves him back. Whatever Sherlock has in mind, John is up to the challenge. After tonight, after everything. John sighs, his hands on Sherlock’s waist, and they fit together like skeletal bones. Ball and socket, hinge, pivot. Sherlock breathes in, John breathes out. So good. It’s so good and
John never wants to speak of horses again.
He’s been shooting up with ‘John’ a lot lately.
John tries and fails not to fidget under the scrutiny. He knows–he
“The ring, it’s…” John loses his train of thought when Sherlock all but pushes him onto the sofa. Crawls up his body, fingering rib six like he’s playing Beethoven’s
John checks his pulse. Fixes the collar of Sherlock’s robe. Rubs the pad of his thumb under Sherlock’s eyes, noting the evidence of discoloration from lack of sleep. Tuts his disappointment, but he’s smiling. He leads Sherlock to where the bed is in reality and Sherlock follows. Drops his guard wholly and without hesitation.
Sherlock nestles his face between John’s shoulder blades. Wraps them in the bedspread. Safe, warm, and not the least bit itchy.
John noses at the length of Sherlock’s throat. His tongue inquisitive against his skin, laving his pulse point like he wants to eat him whole.
“Yes.” It’s all he can manage. But he has time. He has all the time in the world.
“But you know all about me, don’t you?” Painted lips. Polished nails. Eyeliner applied with a steady, practiced hand. She’s gutsy. Definitely a trait John would admire, along with her sizeable breasts. Mary Magdalene smiles at Sherlock without humor. He can see it in her eyes. That cold, calculating look oft referred to as woman’s intuition. A lioness on the prowl, preparing to pounce. “I’ve read John’s blog. Seen the papers.” Mary sizes him up, her evaluation of him rendering her most apathetic indeed. He is not a threat.
“Obviously.”
. He can’t move or see and the smell of nonenal is particularly arresting. All that’s left is touch and Jesus Christ if he isn’t painfully aware of every inch of Sherlock’s sex. He needs a distraction. Something to keep his mind on the heterosexual agenda. Because he is. Heterosexual, of course.
Bird squeaks, “Murderer?”
Sherlock quirks an eyebrow. Daring, “Go on.”
He doesn’t.
Chaos Theory. A butterfly beats its wings half way around the world and
“Dames,” John says in an American accent. “And the horses, eh?”
. Sherlock cares less about his sex life than he does about teenagers. (Though, his sex life and murder? Could be interesting.)
Romantic tripe. Sherlock doesn’t know himself.
“You’re bleeding,” the boy says around the sucker in his mouth. He gnaws on the candy like a wee beastie, his voice soft and cold like silk on steel.
threatens to goad Sherlock’s brain cells into committing suicide. John smiles when Sherlock flips the bottle of whatever
John holds him tight. Traces his thumbs against his hip bones. Feels Sherlock undulate beneath his reverent touch. And watching Sherlock fuck the air between them at the mere look on John’s face--while undeniably Sherlock in all its vanity--is stupidly sexy.
. John kept being perfect and Sherlock kept allowing his perfectness to affect him, damn it.
John rests his elbow on the table. Or tries to. He misses a few times. Plants his chin in the palm of his hand. “You’re beautiful.” He doesn’t realize he’s said this out loud until Sherlock starts giggling at him. “I meant to say brilliant, I did. Brilliant and, and amazing and I’d do anything for you, Sherlock, I really would.”
John’s Sherlock-effused universe collapses on itself, a black hole of emotion sublimating an impression of infinity. It’s just the two of them. One anchoring the other anchoring the other, tethered to a single moment in time.
To say John has butterflies is an understatement.
. He drops the offending crustacean on the counter and glares at it miserably. John isn’t going to kill it and neither, apparently, is he because John’s made him all wishy-washy and there are plenty of experiments he can perform on a lobster, right?
“For God’s sake, this wasn’t even a four!” Sherlock complains, struggling to subdue the man beneath him.
God help him, but it’s endearing. “You don’t have to stay, you know. It’s fine.”
Sherlock buttons his aubergine shirt. Chest flushed, creeping up his neck. His body is betraying him and he hates it. Nerves. Why would he be nervous? There’s absolutely nothing to be nervous about. Unless the date goes poorly and John decides it’s in his best interest to get while the getting is good.
John is fluent in Sherlockian. “Berk,” he says instead of ‘I love you, too’.
“Not measles. Morgellons.” Like John should know better.
The streets are a symphony of London nightlife. Crisp, autumn air. Teasing Sherlock’s fringe. Aimless conversation gives birth to brave, new worlds inside John’s chest.
is that he’s shaking, John can’t say. Nerves? Does Sherlock do nerves? Wonders may never cease.
“I want you more.”
To be subjected to something so
“Nope.” John pops his P.
Sherlock blinks. Takes a steadying breath.
“Yes, alright.” John yawns. “I’d gift wrap the perfect crime, but…” Yawns again.
s. Fragile hiccups at the start. Vulnerable and tentative, but growing in volume and pitch. Harmonizing in a way that fuels their lust. Sherlock’s voice reverberating on John’s tongue. The heel of John’s hand slick with Sherlock’s precome.
Sherlock grins. “Don’t be so hard on yourself, John. I’m sure you can distract me for a day or two.”
Sherlock thinks.
That damned crease deepens.
“Shut up,” Sherlock snaps. “It’s half nine in the morning,” White-knuckling the sheets. Hair in disarray. “I can’t do this.”
“Good.” John actually blushes. “Be ready at six.”
“He asked me if I like to wear tights.”
Real.
Sherlock responds with a:
He puts his violin away. Feels not-exactly-guilty for John’s waiting up. Not his fault. (Conversely, he hopes it is. Hopes everything John does is his fault.)
morphs into a pliant cry. It’s shaky, like his knees, like his heart, a yearning so big he can scarcely draw breath. John’s breath. Against his parted lips. And Sherlock mouths needily at John’s exhalations, drawing him in and in and further in.
He doesn’t care how long it takes.
“I change my mind,” Sherlock says quietly. He doesn’t care if it’s inaccessible, destroying the curve. He’s proud to tell him, “Ten.”
John opens his eyes to find Sherlock staring at him. Not
They giggle all the way to the ground floor.
“Presumably, to live.”
“Mmm.” Sherlock is rolling crumbs between his fingers. “How did your parents meet?”
John struggles not to glance at table three. “Why?”
Lots of things John says translate into,
does not hold everything in the balance. Most things. Lots of things. But not everything. John isn’t everything, either, but he contributes a key element to Sherlock’s everything. Sherlock will be damned if he accepts a mimicry of John’s resplendence. Forced to revise his metamorphosis from a solitary creature of habit to a solitary creature of habit with a John.
Flashing lights. Screaming children. Foodstuff of questionable origin. Vomit. Is there any question why carnivals are Sherlock’s worst nightmare? More than the incongruous sights and the myriad of smells, there’s laughter. Loud, annoying, excessive, annoying, redundant, annoying. A far cry from
And John will never know. Because Sherlock will never tell him. How can he explain something that has no words or definition? Sherlock has lived his entire life wounded by his intellect, his disdain for others, and their resultant derision. John is a salve. Healing him and hurting him simultaneously. His feelings for John eclipse rationalization, a glimmer of emotion, like atmospheric scintillation. It’s enough to go by, Sherlock thinks, if this is what a fraction of the sentiment John inspires reduces him to. A mess of uncommon nonsense.
Sherlock says nothing. It’s too dark to see so John can only assume his silence, a rarity in and of itself under the circumstances, is Sherlock’s way of confirming that there is a finite supply of oxygen.
Sherlock’s threshold for pain is paradoxical, inconsistent. Knife wound? No problem. Oil of vitriol? Piece of cake. A cold? Lord have mercy.
“Hm?”
Sherlock wishes he didn’t find John’s conduct so charming. It’s inconvenient. “You’re inconvenient,” he grumbles.
Yes. God, yes. Huffing, burning, closer, and the mist is closing in around them.
The boy (whose name escapes Sherlock—not that his observational study will be compromised whether he knows who he’s watching or not) turns the page before the girl (also nameless) finds Waldo. She objects. The boy ignores her. Hands held tight.
The shirt falls open. Framing Sherlock’s lean figure. Drawing John’s eye to the dark trail of hair disappearing into his impossibly tight leather trousers.
Sherlock is thoughtful. John wishes he would contemplate whatever it is he’s mulling over somewhere else. It’s hard to read through Sherlock’s legs. “Does the floor have to be lava?”
.) But he’s lazy. And he enjoys watching John do things. The oddest things, really. Peel apples, the plumbing. Anything but type entries for his blog, which Sherlock rudely proposes is a sign of devolution.
And “You…” is almost an answer. The way he kisses Sherlock most certainly is. John is soaking wet, but Sherlock doesn’t care. John’s hands are slippery and warm against his belly, prune-y fingers sliding across his skin, skating under his ribs. Water trickling down his torso and John says, “Yes.” Feeds on Sherlock’s sigh of relief. “Yes. Anything. Yes.” Their lips slide together aimlessly. Tongues graze briefly, eliciting a delightful moan in the pit of John’s throat.
John hands him the requisite toothbrush from the dentist.
"John," Sherlock speaks his name like a riddle. Affirming every kiss, every caress, demanding an answer and posing a question all in one, ragged breath.
Sherlock hails a cab with a turn of his wrist. John would give just about anything to encompass a fraction of the poise Sherlock possesses. Because self-confidence sluices his every pore, joint, and socket like some kind of sparkly second skin and it tosses John’s biscuits that he has a
If intimacy is what John needs (
John looks back and forth from the Ferris Wheel to Sherlock. “What?”
John counts down the launch of Sherlock’s rebuttal to Mycroft’s offer, drowning the ‘three, two, one, liftoff’ with a swig of ginseng, which he loathes. But it’s the only tea they have in the cupboard and he can’t
John is giggling.
“I know,” Sherlock whispers with more solemnity than he garners for the murdered dead. And that must mean something, John thinks.
Sherlock groans.
watch Holmes v Holmes without a cuppa to alleviate the stray insults that invariably hurtle in his direction. Collateral criticism.
John chokes, “Why?” Derelict vowel on the tip of his tongue, on the pad of Sherlock’s index.
Sherlock says it. Quick. Like ripping off an Elastoplast. “I promise.” As if announcing he has a terminal disease. “And now I mean to have you.”
Sherlock huffs. That’s it, isn’t it?
John opens his eyes to find Sherlock staring at him. Not
John panics.
Sherlock’s expression shifts, just so. A touch of color in his cheeks. “I knew that.”
“You’re disturbing the other customers. We’re evicting you from the theatre. Please leave.”
John collapses on the bed beside a considerably less itchy Sherlock. Sherlock gravitates toward him, demanding the removal of John’s clothing with almost-drunken gestures and one-syllable words.
“Lucky.” John snorts. Follows Sherlock’s lead and takes a swig of the Pinot. Not really his taste. Bought it for Susan. Grimaces as he swallows. “I think that’s a matter of opinion.” Another swig.
Sherlock is silent. John doesn’t let go.
Sherlock's smile widens. His eyes crinkle. "Sebastian."
“I remember,” Sherlock mutters.
They both get the hell out of Dodge when Mrs. Hudson invites them to stay for dinner.
And Sherlock is already palming his erection. Hisses his pleasure before John shoos him away.
Sherlock watches John while he listens to the caller invariably describe their kinks.
An afflux of galaxies, twinkling like the stars. John chuckles with the improbabilities.
Sherlock sighs in relief. “Thank God.” Hops to his feet readily. “Come on, John.”
The bathroom door opens. John draws the shower curtain.
“Have you considered the repercussions?”
John really needs to sleep.
Molly blushes crimson. “Oh-okay, then. Honeymoon underway. I’ll just…” Unsteadily, she leaves.
. Somehow, he thought the beautiful chaos that occaionally constricts his lungs would change his opinion of John. Or of himself.
Until.
When Sherlock dragged the aforementioned distracted John out of their flat to attend an art course because “Four of the last five models that posed for Miss Haversham’s figure painting class have turned up missing.” John didn’t think for one second he would be participating since he can’t draw stick people to save his life. Knows next to nothing about tempera or acrylic or oil paints. He was vaguely concerned that Sherlock would lift some terpenoid, but it never crossed his mind Sherlock would introduce himself to the smattering of students as a connoisseur from France, complete with accent, and John as their male model for the evening.
“You’re heavy.”
John cards a knuckle down the cleft of Sherlock’s arse. Or where the cleft of his arse would be if his trousers weren’t so damned tight.
s. Sherlock doesn’t need John’s edification to withstand a blitz of slurs. He survived on his own, mending his self-esteem long before John Watson invaded his life.
“Anilingu
“Fuck me,” John moans. A statement of resignation, not a request. (Probably.) “I believed in you.”
) down here?” Sherlock’s attempt at insouciance is annulled by the huskiness of his voice. He clears his throat while John nips at his chin. “Your reasoning?”
John eyes him warily. Climbs inside, half expecting Sherlock to scarper off to places unknown like the skiving bastard he is. To John’s astonishment, Sherlock hops in after him. “Baker Street,” he instructs the driver. “221B.”
Sherlock is confident he’s hallucinating. Drugged. Tripping on acid. Cocaine. Jonesing for nicotine at the very least.
“I don’t believe you.”
John hands Sherlock the lockpick. He flexes his aching fingers. Watches Sherlock work magic in the bathroom mirror. Despite his inability to see what he’s doing, handcuffed back to back as they are, Sherlock handles the tool with relative ease. He also takes his revenge on John, pressuring him to kneel on the edge of the tub, his elbows akimbo. (
“Fuck,” John groans. He kisses Sherlock soundly on the lips.
the one who’s always interfering with my love life.”
“John, we need a new safeword.”
“Of course not.”
John scrolls through a collection of classical music. Typical. Obvious. There has to be something more! Something incriminating! Like Country or Rap or that Berber kid. John giggles to himself at the thought. He skims Sherlock’s assortment of Chopin and Beethoven.
Not technically.

Another groan. “Who do I have to shoot to get you to do this more often?”
.), Sherlock will find a way to give him the sun. Just one thing, though. Only one condition. John can’t leave. Ever. Sherlock won’t let him.
) It’s fine; braving Sherlock’s flights of fancy in the face of death and murder and gore of indeterminate sums, but flagging down a cab double-handcuffed to another human being is next to impossible, as it happens.
John rolls them over. A smile budding on Sherlock’s mouth. John kisses it into full bloom. “You’re amazing.”
The movie stops abruptly. John finds himself a little disappointed, strangely. Two members of the cinema staff make a beeline for their seats. Shine flashlights at them unnecessarily. “Gentleman, I’m going to have to ask you to leave.”
“You returned to work on Tuesday.”

on his mobile. (I.e.,
There’s nothing for it. He’s just…flat out gorgeous. Aesthetic features, prominent cheekbones, cat-like eyes, and artfully curled hair. There are times John can’t stand to look at him, honestly. But there are times he can’t bear to look away. Like tonight.
The lounge isn’t big enough to accommodate the both of them comfortably, but Sherlock is loath to stop kissing John to look for the bedroom. Stop kissing John to freshen up a bit. Stop kissing John to…anything, really. There are occasions when John Watson simply ought to be kissed and this is one of them, dammit.
“He doesn’t actually mean safeword,” John explains, encouraging Lestrade to lift his arms, clearing his airways. He gives Sherlock one of his many Looks. This one is a combination of
it thrills him down to the soles of his feet to surprise Sherlock Holmes. John’s toes curl in his shoes. “Shit, shit,” he gasps, torn between beating a hasty retreat and—kisses him again. Pulls Sherlock closer, groaning with the futility of his restraint.
John trusts him, though. That’s what it all boils down to.
John simply smiles and shuts Sherlock out again.
“I-I mean. Understood.”
He steers Sherlock against the wall. Sherlock slumps, bracing his shoulders for support. His coat frames his eager body, betraying its desire for John’s perusal. His nipples are peaked, delicious little nubs clearly evident beneath the silk of his straining shirt. A visible bulge in his bespoke trousers. His eyes, finally deigning to open, are heavy lidded and dark. He observes John take him in and John, for once, doesn’t bother disguising his appreciation, but allows it to be seen for what it is. Hot and heavy and Sherlock cants his hips at the naked want on display.
"I was joking, obviously."
(The understatement of the millennium.)
Sherlock produces two plane tickets he purchased a week ago.
“Your legs burned off.”
“Practice makes perfect.”
Sherlock doesn’t like that idea, either. Doesn’t want just anyone rummaging around his things. Nor does he want to start an argument about strangers in the flat lest John suggest they get their hands dirty chasing vermin. The only pests he feels obligated to hunt down are murderous, human ones. “Fine,” Sherlock grudgingly agrees. The proceeding note is a tad on the piercing side.
The resulting silence is pregnant with Sherlock’s indignation. “What?”
John bristles as he sits beside Mycroft, not his sexy secretary.
“What? Really? Why?”
John remembers the first time he held a needle and thread. His mother learned how to cross-stitch from his grandmother, who made a living as a seamstress. Maybe needlework is in his blood, he has no idea, but it is no coincidence that he can stitch a wound with startling proficiency.
“You made it painfully clear I was to never fake my death, under any circumstances, ever again.” Sherlock doesn’t fight his smile so much as suspend it. He’ll smile at John later. When he doesn’t feel so sticky. John will smile back because he’s John and he can’t help himself. “I learn from my mistakes.”
It’s midnight. John is not awake.
“—your cooperation—“
It occurs to Sherlock again—that makes three, a number Sherlock finds pleasing—that he doesn’t know how to be effectively comforting. Compromised, sure. Innocent, no problem. Charming, hell yes. He hasn’t had to resort to comforting in years. Not that he can remember, anyway. Must’ve deleted it. Nothing the internet can’t fix.
John fucking loves this man.
“Who’s there?”
“We’re out of milk,” John whispers in his ear.
“Yes.”
tacit and oh-so worth it. John sucks his tea between his teeth, the slurping finally driving Mycroft back downstairs.
. A tic, a frown. A snarl and he’s on his feet. Stalking John’s romantic table arrangement with avid displeasure. If he can’t fool John, he will antagonize him. Because? No reason. Sherlock doesn’t need reasons, he needs for John not to invite strange women into their flat.
“Then why?”
John convinces him to
was a common theme among the guests.
. Neither does he approve of John’s height advantage during an argument. They wrestle for purchase on the steps. Sharp elbows, muffled curses. But invasion of personal space is a lark; the nostalgia of Basic Training strengthens John’s resolve.
Isn’t it? If he can’t admit their relationship began a ten, he can default to nine. Or maybe nine’s too obvious. Wouldn’t everyone say nine? Sherlock isn’t everyone. He doesn’t want to just choose a number without thinking. Nine is technically perfect since ten is technically unobtainable. Again, Sherlock grants he made mistakes. And the drugs bust. Had to knock it down to—
John clenches his teeth. Like he can willfully subdue the blush tinging his cheeks. “Later,” he says, which is code for
I apologize for my absence. The good news is wedding season is over. The even better news is my hours are changing and I’ll have more time on my hands. Win-win!
“I’m not going anywhere,” John says, a touch cross. For being such a genius, Sherlock can be incredibly stupid. “Even if I were, I’m taking you with me.”
“AHhhh-ahh!” John shouts. Stands. Successfully obtains everyone’s attention. Hesitates, but only momentarily. “
Sherlock hesitates. John isn’t sure if he’s contemplating not playing because he’s too self-conscious or because—John mouths an ‘oh’. Steps up onto the couch. Sherlock is a brilliant man, seemingly incapable of lacking in self-confidence and impervious to humiliation, but John knows better. Sherlock may not feel things the way most people feel them, but he feels them all the same. And if there’s one thing Sherlock is uncomfortable with, it’s jumping in with both feet without sufficient data.
“Marginally.”
Sherlock can’t get into trouble if he’s sitting (Possibly sulking.) in the dark next to John.
John purses his lips. On the verge of asking what in the world Sherlock is talking about when Sherlock prods his forehead with a lackadaisical pointer finger.
He immediately hates himself.
“What are you wearing?”
.) So John, learned in cheek, implements revenge. He listens to the prompt: 'You’ve reached Sherlock Holmes. Intrigue me. Your life may depend on it.'
kiss him back, though, as much as John irritates him. (
John is everything.
Sherlock snorts unbecomingly. They descend into peals laughter.
Sherlock is a contradictive little shit when it suits him.
John is fluent in Sherlockian. “Berk.”
John bins his lunch. They make for the Yard, falling in stride. Before they leave the park, John stops Sherlock with a quiet “Um.” and his eyes are trained on the kinky rabbit somewhere to the left of Sherlock’s ear. “Thank you. For.” John shoves his hands in his pockets. “The break.”
“Yes, I—“ John smiles. Leans forward on his toes to kiss Sherlock on the mouth. “Yes.”
Sherlock snaps his hips forward, hard enough to drive John back against the wall (
Sherlock disparages the human race its be-all and end-all fascination with sex. Adrenaline, dopamine, serotonin. Sex has never appealed to him on a level befitting his intellect and while he is no stranger to masturbation—his transport is disappointingly normal at times—he is neither repulsed nor intrigued by his body’s intrinsic desire to reproduce. It’s nature. It’s science. It’s
“So, reasonably, you wish to name a lobster Gladstone.”
Sherlock shrugs. “It’s the most sensible honeymoon destination of all.”
So will Sherlock’s undivided attention.
Sherlock doesn’t know how to respond.
Sherlock lobs him a funny look. John loves the crease between his eyebrows when he’s confused.
“You have a man crush?” Sherlock is most certainly intrigued. He’s all but repeated himself. “More than one?”
John doesn’t say anything. Taking too long to think. Makes Sherlock antsy.
“I mean the whole us together thing. Eating takeaway and watching twelve hours of security footage.”
Sherlock nods.
Sherlock doesn't particularly care, which means he must care a lot. Absently fills a plate with assorted finger foods. Just enough. Not too much. Doesn't want John to suspect. Not that he's paying enough attention to Sherlock to suspect anything.
Sherlock is horrified. “Good God. Never do that again. Under penalty of death.”

Sherlock sniffs haughtily. Goes back to thinking.
“Those pictures couldn’t have waited twenty minutes?”
) who cradles her chin atop interwoven fingers. Imperturbably. Like she’s one up on him. Sherlock doesn’t have time to waste, to rejoinder with passive-aggressive body language. Undertones contending that John Watson his HIS. Belongs to HIM. And she—with her little, black dress and fuck-me slingbacks—will have no stake in John’s future if Sherlock has any say in the matter. “A rather bold assumption. We’ve only just met.”
“Yes?”
. First only because sexual compatibility seems to be ‘the basis of a stable relationship’, if Sherlock is to believe the internet. (Dull. And the other setbacks can go rot.) Sherlock doesn’t give a flying fuck about sexual orientation or gender identification unless it’s
Sherlock smiles crookedly. “How do you feel about children?”
Mycroft has a way of frowning with his entire body. Brow furrowed. Shoulders tense. Fingers tighten on the handle of his umbrella. “The risk of what?”
“You should be ashamed of yourselves,” one of the staff chastises John. “A man of your age. Honestly.”
“Interesting,” Sherlock murmurs. As crazy as it sounds, being called interesting by Sherlock Homes is equally as satisfying as sex.
Geese. Honestly.
They fly out of Fitton on a private jet. Sherlock owes the CEO a favor.
“Hang on.” John pokes his head out of the shower. “You’re working for 1-800-Kiss-nTell?”
“Act natural?”
“Because we want to.” Knuckles across his ribcage. “You’ve been desperate for my attention all day.”
He’s sleeping. So soundly.
“I wasn’t aware Dr. Watson’s sexual orientation included men.”
Sherlock’s boyhood room is nothing like John imagines.
Mycroft is unimpressed. Just as he’s unimpressed with most everything. The apathetic core of his character does not show on his face. No, he twists and bends and pinches his features to resemble that of a man who is pleased. Charmed. Delighted. Any and every variant. Mycroft offers the young woman his hand.
Sherlock’s compulsion to decorate the flat with skulls does not bother John. Decorating the skulls with unsystematic accessories, however, bothers him quite a lot. Not because he thinks it’s stupid, but because it’s really really cool.
The both of them are fighting for breath like they’ve been on a chase across London’s rooftops.
Sherlock is gasping. Ragged exhalations harmonize with John’s bass snoring. His knuckles ache. He draws his bow against the strings, elevates his elbow, inclines the pale column of his throat. Tendons visible in his neck. His fingertips scream against the fretboad, but he presses harder.
tomorrow.”
Sherlock’s brow is pinched, as close to dumbstruck as is possible. It wrenches John’s heart, his wonder. His disbelief. He wants to flatter Sherlock over and over until praise no longer renders him speechless. Renders him indolent, gasping under his hands, his tongue. Unmoored.
John rubs. Hard. Sherlock shoots him a sullen look and reels his long shanks to his end of the bath. Not sure why John’s un-obliging behavior compels Sherlock to start experimenting with the bath products. John doesn’t mind. Just as long as Sherlock allows him to relax, too.
Sherlock stops texting. Glares at John’s editor (
Because two of you asked.
His stores of information give way like the Red Sea before…before whoever it was. Gandhi? Sherlock doesn’t know. Doesn’t care to know. But he’s inside his own head. Statistics, encyclopedic configurations, bone and debris and mud. Granules of sand prickle the balls of his bare feet. The swish of his robe as he weaves down the hallway to his illusory bedroom.
“You’ve been in here over an hour.”
.) He’d almost forgotten home manifests itself in the shape, the sound, the scent of his dearest friend and John retreats. Damn near takes Sherlock’s heart with him. Lurching like it yearns to follow, to minimize the distance between the two of them because nothing on this Earth will separate Sherlock and John so cruelly ever again.
Grips the keys tight in his fist. Biting into his skin. A moment of heart-pounding anxiety. Not fear. Never fear. Actualization. This is happening. They are happening. Sherlock reminds himself to breathe. Manual override. Conscious of every step they’re taking, walking in synch. Across the sweeping expanse of gardens and (apparently) waterlogged ruins of homesteads past. Archaic motes swollen from excessive rain, the smell of earth ripe with budding life, flora and fauna.
. Customarily stern, sometimes stubborn. Ready and willing to bend the laws, break the rules. A nudge in the right direction. Follow Sherlock’s lead no matter the risk or the reward. He’s quintessential. So fucking quintessential, the thought of living without John is unbearable.
“Hm?” Like they’re sunbathing on a beach in Porto-Pollo.
John shakes his head. “Sit,” is his command. Points toward the studio full of twenty-somethings and the drawing horses they’re straddling. Gathering their brushes, mixing their paints. Pallet knives scraping taut canvas and the smell of hot wax, oddly. “We’ll talk later.”
Sherlock sits up straight. Steeples his fingers. “Horses?”
“You were really very good. Maybe you’ve discovered yourself a new profession.”
John is beyond confused. But perfectly content lost in the dark, considering. Doesn’t stop Sherlock from explaining to him, in depth, how three
“No.”
I apologize profusely. And I intend to update regularly now that I have my feet under me. The first month of the season is always the worst. Please forgive me my tardiness. Have a bit of fluff!
“John,” Sherlock pleas.
Sherlock is a contradictive little shit when it suits him.
Sherlock’s gone.
John licks his lips. His heart is pounding. His jeans are a little too snug and the smell of Sherlock’s cologne a little too sweet. Sherlock’s flushed cheeks and the patina of sweat glistening at the hollow of his– “Okay,” John decides.
John’s smile is unparalleled.
“Mmm. You said amazing already.”
of his devotion. Only a fraction. He jumped off of a roof for John, spent three years away from London,
John looks up at the sky. At the clouds.
John may or may not be drunk.
Sherlock refuses to duel with him as he wields his dessert, complete with “wruu, ksch” sound effects.
John is suckling Sherlock’s bottom lip when it hits him that Sherlock isn’t kissing back.
John meets his eyes, lips pressed firmly together. “Oh. About. Yes.” Unsuccessfully curbs a smile. Infective. Sherlock answers in kind. It’s unbearable. “This, tonight. It was nice.”
“Mother conscripted Father, who was enjoying a ‘damn fine cup of coffee’, to ‘follow that car’.”
John assumes he’s broken something.
“We can’t both stare.”
Mike hands him a pint and smiles exuberantly. “Got yourself sorted?”
Title sequence. Trees, landscape, yes. Here we go.
John smoothes an elastoplast across Sherlock’s zygomatic bone. “You let him hit you.”
Sherlock respires an “Ah” for a particularly breathy “I” and John jerks his head sideways, knocking their noses together. Sherlock chuckles darkly. Switches to his other ear. “I really want to know, John.” Lays the H on thick, his lips caressing the shell of John’s ear. Another “Ah” and John is shrinking in his seat. Sherlock chases after him, back hunched, his mouthful of air hot and titillating.
) who cradles her chin atop interwoven fingers. Imperturbably. Like she’s one up on him. Sherlock doesn’t have time to waste; he will not rejoinder with passive-aggressive body language. Undertones contending that John Watson his HIS. Belongs to HIM. And she—with her little, black dress and fuck-me slingbacks—will have no stake in John’s future if Sherlock has any say in the matter. “A rather bold assumption. We’ve only just met.”
John takes in the view. Sherlock plays
John just smiles. Cuts his ravioli into manageable, bite-sized pieces.
“Yeah,” John murmurs. “I think so, too.”
Does John feel love? Or
“The problem is kids believe themselves to be invincible.” Sherlock doesn’t even have to look at John before he tells him, “Gaping is terribly unattractive, you know.” There’s a sparkle in his eye as he weaves in and out of the Rube Goldberg obstacle course constructed by three teenage boys with the collective intelligence of a fruit fly. Two of whom are huddled on the curb, shock blankets galore. Blubbering their heads off. Incidentally, the third member of their trio died doing what he loved. I.e., being a moron.
This is how Lestrade finds them. Waltzing blindly around the rack ribs.
Sherlock snorts.
Sherlock highly doubts a lobster has the capacity for introspection. Or the ability to reconcile itself as an individual creature separate from the environment and other individual creatures, for that matter.
“What th’ hell is going on?” a woman demands. Probably the one who screamed going by the red wine soaking her jeans.
“For what? Are you hurt?”
“Easy!”
That’s an unfair assertion, John decides as he grabs his coat. Him not winning. For all intents and purposes, he’s already won.
“Yes. Of course.” John looks out the window. Can’t find anything to do with his hands. The thought of cupping them around his crotch is tempting. He clears his throat twice before he says, “Kissing Molly Hooper was, what? Practice?”
John takes a seat by the door and smiles mechanically while Bird retells the same stories he’s heard a thousand times before. Tales of conquests and pub crawls and that one time Hotty got them thrown out of a local taco joint for sneezing guacamole into his hands. John takes to people watching, Bird’s grandstanding floating in one ear and out the other. The twenty-somethings with nothing to lose. Dancing to the beat of the music, their laughter accompanied by the clink of glasses, a round of “Cheers!”, and the thump of bass.
“Oh,” Sherlock groans, and he wonders at the sound of his own voice. Thick and potent and altogether new. “Touch me.
Sherlock’s eyes are unguarded. John catches a glimpse of his great heart as well as his great brain. It damn near undoes him.
They’re walking home from Angelo’s, the streets a symphony of London nightlife. Crisp, autumn air. Teasing Sherlock’s fringe. The conversation between them gives birth to brave, new worlds inside John’s chest.
John is well versed in the put-upon sigh. (
) work, cracking John’s neck quite nicely in the process. “You’ll scar,” he hisses.
“The concept of timing must be foreign to you.” John idly scratches behind his ear, ducking his head. His face is ruddy from blushing.
Seven hours later, Sherlock is combing the flat for morphine. (
John glares. Sherlock knows from firsthand experience that sheets conceal next to nothing…sometimes.
Sherlock sways. Rocking from side to side, feet shuffling against the rug. His eyes are still trained on the e-mails. He doesn’t say a word. The flat is dark. Sherlock’s only light source originates from outside. Curtains drawn wide and the city pours into their living room, flashing and pulsing like a living, breathing thing. Sherlock exhales, a silhouette, framed in gold. He closes his eyes; he doesn’t need to see the evidence anymore. Hasn’t had to since the first time he read them. He tilts his head back and he continues to sway.
Rings some more.
John supersedes his predecessors, too. Sherlock has known a few companions in his lifetime, some of which more invigorating than others. (In every sense of the word.) Stimulants, appetite suppressants, anesthetics. Anything and everything to tame the chaos inside his head. To gag the ghosts of his past, peeling their vitriolic accusations from the synarthrodial joints of his neurocranium. John, though. John looks at Sherlock and his consummate loyalty needles his veins. Hot. Potent. Incredibly addicting. Washing away his insecurities, his reservations.
. Wait. Not daggers. Plutonium bombs. He’s glaring Plutonium bombs at the PA system, which is currently playing the most mind-numbing Christmas music John has ever heard. Who creates the playlists for this shit? Are they trying to stimulate more shopping or mass murder? In Sherlock’s case, it’s the latter. He stands in the middle of the cologne department, head tilting back and back and his face is terrifyingly blank given the tremors waltzing up and down his spine like Mycroft and his Lady Du Jour,
“What are you doing?” he asks perfunctorily.
As an apology for missing so many days unintentionally (work-related and friend-related), please accept this reunion drabble. Another apology drabble due tomorrow, which will be kiss centric. I incorporated Elementary’s “I’m going to miss this.” speech, which aired Thursday.
John tilts his head to one side. “Sort of looks like a rabbit wearing a strap-on.”
“No. But it could have been, I think.”
Carruthers growls. He kicks and pivots and Sherlock loses his balance for all of two seconds before Carruthers slams him to the ground.
“Do you care?”
Sherlock feels the stirrings of what he’s discovered is referred to as butterflies. He doesn’t like that word, either. Not in this case. Not butterflies. John inspires something more manly. More dangerous. Medevac, air ambulance, Sikorsky S-76. An entire war, even. “You were hungry,” Sherlock reminds him.
He lifts a flute of wine to his mouth. Takes a sip. A grimace John adores in spite of himself. Sherlock watches the couples mingle with desultory curiosity. Reading every gesture, tick, wrinkle and word. Quicksilver eyes roaming from person to person. Indolent. Until he sees John among the multitude. His gaze. Caustic during one of his blacker moods. But today John decides
Ever since Sherlock met John, he hasn’t shot up. Not once.
John kisses him. “Fine. But no honey.”
Sherlock sways where he stands. Rocking from side to side, feet shuffling against the rug. His eyes are still trained on the e-mails. He doesn’t say a word. The flat is dark. Sherlock’s only light source originates outside. Curtains drawn wide and the city pours into their living room, flashing and pulsing like a living, breathing thing. Sherlock exhales, a silhouette in the dark, framed in gold. He closes his eyes; he doesn’t need to see the evidence anymore. Hasn’t had to since the first time he read them. He tilts his head back and he continues to sway.
Ironically enough, Sherlock does not utilize Billy on Halloween. “Predictable,” is his excuse.
Sherlock grunts. Caught between a laugh and a moan. “Who’s distracting now?” He manages to sound petulant and aroused at the same time.
John shot a man. For him. Probably not good, but Sherlock finds John’s sangfroid…impressive? Arousing? Endearing? Romantic? Incredible? Ten? Ten times ten. Good morals. Hand couldn’t have shaken at all. Nerves of steel.
John hooks his thumbs in the waistband of Sherlock’s pajama bottoms. Sherlock seriously thinks about offering no help whatsoever. Wants to observe John taking matters into his own hands because John’s hands are a little weathered, definitely abled, and his train of thought leaves him high and dry in a switching yard of John’s capable fingers.
Sherlock leaves his keys to dangle in the lock. “About?”
, Sherlock would say.
Sherlock takes a breath. “John bent me over his chair last night and we made mad, passionate love right where you’re sitting.” He says this with the zeal of a Ben Stein skit. John coughs at the mental image of Sherlock willingly bending over anything for sexual gratification.
John shudders. Never again. He winds the sheet around his torso, his waist, and his legs. Nobody’s seeing anything. Especially Sherlock, that twat. John scuttles out from behind the curtain and immediately turns his back.
John gazes out the living room window. The fog is as dense as the anger accumulating at the base of his skull, prickling the backs of his eyes. Sherlock is avoiding the subject in a fashion befitting a man who has no sense of tact. He’s flipping through the paper, talking aloud like John cares to hear about a ship christened
s when he was on tour in Afghanistan. Or, more likely, he does know and doesn’t wish for John to associate Sherlock’s birthday with his military career.
“This is miserable,” Sherlock quips, spitting toothpaste out of his mouth. He watches John brush his teeth in a circular fashion. Up and down, neat and precise, and it makes him absurdly happy. He doesn’t like it. One confession, one night, and suddenly the everyday and the ordinary and the mundane aren’t so mind-numbingly monotonous. Sherlock wants to cut them out and hoard them in secret places no one else can find even though they serve no purpose. But he can’t help it. And it pisses him off. “You’re killing me,” he voices his displeasure.
“You’re fantastic.”
Mostly, he enjoys watching John do things. The oddest things, really. Peel apples, the plumbing. Anything but type entries for his blog, which Sherlock rudely proposes is a sign of devolution.
But if he did, Sherlock ruminates, he would settle for cerulean. In classical artistry, the term
For some ungodly reason, Sherlock remembers one of Shakespeare’s most famous soliloquies is Juliet’s “O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?”. Perhaps because Mycroft is irrationally fond of Shakespeare. (
John and Sherlock share a look. A silent conversation follows thusly:
Mrs. Hudson is staring at them, blushing like a Worcestershire orchard before harvest.
Okay. This is…long and weird. I don’t even know. I apologize in advance for the strangeness. I also apologize if I've completely misrepresented the uses of butorphanol.
related. He doesn’t even identify as asexual. Not technically. He identifies with no one; labels tend to make him itchy. Especially
A young woman is presented to Mycroft. She has managed to squeeze into a size two when she should be wearing a size four. Face artfully painted, lipstick in rogue. Hair washed and styled and pinned. She’s beaming.
“Have you noticed we’re the only adults in here?”
"We're not married yet."
“Really?” Sherlock huffs, deliciously winded. He kicks at the sheet tangled about their legs. “Now? You’re going to antagonize me now?” Grins evilly when John nods the affirmative. “Mmm, saddle me up. I like a nice. Hard. Bit. In my mouth.”
Their eyes meet. A union of opposites.
and what a bastard.
John isn’t entirely sure, but he thinks it’s exactly what they’re supposed to be doing.
Sherlock prefers not to eat while on a case, but John tastes of salt and butter and cooking oil and Sherlock is amenable every now and again.
Sherlock resorts to a tactic better suited below the belt. He whispers in John’s ear,
John catches his trousers when Sherlock throws them at his face. “Future…”
Sherlock is not amused. “If you’re quite finished, I have larva to attend to.”
“I’m not playing right now.”
“No,” John agrees. “But it could have been, I think.”
Sherlock transfers his grip from John’s shoulder to the back of John’s chair, picking up his routine from where he’d left off before. He arcs his neck, the pale column of his throat illuminated by the red and gold lights of the pub.
) or disapproval (
“That’s hardly acceptable.”
This only makes John laugh harder.
Sherlock is smart enough to realize from whence John’s apologies stem. He turns over on his back. Tangling with the sheets and the cushions and they shift together in the bundle they’ve made. Their feet are exposed, bathed in the light of the rising sun. “Now hear this, John Watson,” Sherlock all but growls, his mind droning like a hive a bees in the wake of John’s insecurities. “Do not apologize for…” He swallows. “For loving me.” He may be asexual, but he can’t say he doesn’t enjoy every single minute John lavishes him, ravishes him. And maybe that means something. And maybe John’s the exception.
Sherlock shoots her a withering look. “Buttercups are dicots,” he presses on. “Petals multiples of four or five. In this case, five.” He nicks a buttercup from the vase.
, but it gives Sherlock a sick sense of satisfaction to retain a term so standoffish. It has served him well in he past. He does not plan to discard it now.
The culprit cries, “Banzai!” before he leaps into the Thames. What he means is anyone’s guess. Doesn’t really matter. Lestrade and his team are waiting for their man down stream.
, but semantics is beside the point. Sherlock’s threshold for pain is impressive. (Impressively stupid.) Yet there are occasions when he indulges himself in a bit of a man cold. Or, in this case, unwarranted whinging.
Sherlock treats John to pad thai and dumplings after he gets dressed.
John kisses the corner of his mouth and Sherlock breathes him in. Doesn’t kiss him back, just breathes. Parting his lips. A taste. A little taste. An electrical shock. Ventricular fibrillation. Isn’t used to the cloying need of reassurance. Steals his breath even as John restores it. “I would let you go,” Sherlock admits, chest heaving. Doesn’t realize he’s told the truth until after he speaks the words on John’s tongue. Genuine surprise, a gasp of regret. Or delight. He’s not sure. Why would he do that? Why would he let John go if John wanted to leave?
John fails to stifle his giggling. Little gasps of delight directly against the mouthpiece. Directly into Sherlock's ear. Straight to his brain, lighting up his large-scale neural networks. "I...may've...punched your old pal from Uni in the face."
Sherlock beams back.
Serve, retire, practice medicine in the country. Pickett fence. A wife and 2.5 kids.
“Fuck me,” John moans. And Sherlock is pretty sure his statement is one of resignation, not a request. Still, he’s no less enthusiastic when Sherlock kisses him in earnest, their mouths sliding together in perfect syncopation.
John touches Sherlock’s hands. Eases them apart. Fingernails leaving crescent moons on his skin. “You would keep me?”
