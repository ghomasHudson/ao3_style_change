John leaped forward, grasping his gun from the floor, rushing after Sherlock. He had almost reached the fighting men and tried to get a clear view at Collins in the dim light when a shot echoed through the corridor.
"Hard to tell. As they probably belong to some branch of organized crime, it'll depend on Scotland Yard. If they can offer him security, maybe."
"But why would someone fabricate the gains of Hayes Leisure Entertainment?" John frowned as he tried to make sense of the numbers in front of him.
"Lestrade will need some time to get here, but he'll alert the police officers in the area," John heard him announce as Sherlock stepped up next to him, exchanging the phone in his hand for Collins' gun, pointing it at the man who was clenching his fists in rage.
"Good. Very good, Mrs. Hudson. Now, the other man. The victim. What do you remember about him?"
Sherlock was immediately at his side, regarding the sheet John held in his left hand while he raised his right so that the light of the flashlight illuminated the paper.
When Collins had followed his instructions, John called for Sherlock, not taking his eyes from the man in front of him.
The man took a step back into the corridor, and John momentarily understood what he was planning to do. Collins was going to lock them into that room until the people he worked with would arrive to kill them in one way or another.
Sherlock rose from the floor, regarding the dispersal of the bluish spots. He shoved the curtain on his right aside, taking a short glance into the niche with the werewolf installation. "After the victim was stabbed here," he said eventually," he must have stumbled against the wall, given the high accumulation of blood splashes in the area here. From the amount of blood, I'd guess he wasn't stabbed more than twice. Otherwise, there'd be more traces in this area. But where did the murderer take the body?"
"Sherlock!" John exclaimed, his heart skipping a beat when he saw his friend stumble backward, clutching his side.
"What? What is it?" John asked while the carriage moved through the exit and into the dusk of the evening.
However, right now, Sherlock was standing in front of the sofa in their living room, eyes fixed on the assemblage of notes, photos, and other clues covering the wall. It was a strange mosaic they had worked tirelessly to create over the last year. However, no image, no structure of Moriarty's organization had become visible, the man himself seemingly vanished from the face of the earth.
Sherlock gave a haughty snort, his stride quickening. "At least I have no intention of being idle."
"But it's probably the most unobserved at a crowded funfair. Think, John."
"I–oh, it happened so fast. Our carriage–it had just moved around the corner, into the part where they have those niches in the wall with all sorts of installations: villains, vampires. You know, the ones you watch while you drive by." She gave a little laugh. "It's quite funny actually to–"
"You know, Sherlock, we still don't have even the slightest evidence that Mrs. Hudson's murder victim even exists," John said, inclining his head.
And here it comes. John winced slightly when the high-pitched voice of their landlady echoed through the hallway.
Since they had moved into Baker Street, Mrs. Hudson had put up with everything, from bullet holes over late-night violin sessions to police drug busts and Secret Service agents observing her house. But whatever Sherlock had done to upset her this time, from the sound of it, John suspected it would take more than a rueful smile to appease her.
The moment Sherlock switched the blacklight on, around a dozen bluish bright spots in different sizes appeared at the far end of the corridor, and John felt something cold seep into his stomach.
"You saw a murder on the ghost train?" John asked, his brows arching in disbelief.
"Most of him?" Sherlock repeated, digging deeper.
Sighing, he risked a glance at his friend. Sherlock had finally turned away from the wall and stepped into the middle of the living room, hands folded in front of his chest, head tilted slightly to the left as if he were weighing a deduction.
"SHERLOCK!"
"Well, that looks… tacky," John said, his eyes absorbing the sight before him.
"Mrs. Turner, dear." Mrs. Hudson gave him a brief smile before she continued. "Sherlock, I have seen it. The long knife–" She trailed off, wringing her hands. "It was horrible. Just like in one of those Hitchcock movies".
"The ghost train. Yes, murder."
"Precisely. Two years ago, Hayes surprised the industry by naming his protégé and long-time employee, Randel Collins, executive director. And while Hayes is still owner and face of the Hayes Leisure Entertainment, Collins is now handling most of the daily business. Much to the dislike of the other showmen families. They see him as some sort of intruder, who was not born into the trade. And of course, they have all been hoping for their chance at absorbing the Hayes business once it would have been for sale."
Mrs. Hudson's eyes widened with a mixture of shock and surprise. "Sherlock, how do you–"
Because it was the logical choice.
John followed right behind him.
In front of them, Collins seemed to freeze. "Albert?"
"There. As good as new," he declared with a false air of lightness as he removed his hands a few moments later, clasping them tightly behind his back to hide that they were shaking.
"Sure." He heard the doubt, he could feel his friend's inquiring eyes on him, but he was spared from another lie when their carriage moved forward with a jerk and entered the ghost train only a moment later.
"Stabbings are a messy business," Sherlock said, pulling the miniature forensic light John had gifted him last Christmas from the pocket of his trousers, pointing it at the darkness before them. "While most of the bleeding happens internally, you can never avoid at least some splashes of blood. Hardly to be seen on a black floor in the dim light of a flashlight."
Had someone asked him, John would have guessed that the line of fairground stalls stretching along the park's roadside was at least half a mile long. The pavement close by was flurrying with all sorts of people: families, groups of teenagers, as well as many older people, either on their way towards the funfair or already returning from it.
John shrugged. "Well, it isn't that we know much else about him; besides that, according to Mr. Hudson, he looks like Mr. Ordinary."
A second later, Sherlock stepped out from behind some kind of dark curtain, which, in the gloomy corridor, John had believed to be part of the wall.
"So, the old Hayes still takes care of problems at his funfair himself," John said while he climbed behind Sherlock into the last one of seven small, bright red carriages. "Maybe Mrs. Hudson's murder victim was such a problem as well, huh?"
"Must be hard to run an entertainment business in a national economic crisis, isn't it, Collins?" Sherlock interjected, and for the split of a second, something in the man's face twitched. "Dropping turnovers. People with less money to spend. A few ten thousand quid extra can come in handy in times like these. That's why they approached you. Because it was an offer you couldn't reject. Because you had to prove those wrong, who think you're an outsider, that you couldn't carry on the success of Hayes Leisure Entertainment."
When John turned around, he saw a middle-sized man, probably about forty years old, with a receding line of brown hair standing in the doorframe of the small room. The hard, angular face and his sturdy frame told of a lifetime of physical work. He held a flashlight in the left hand while his right was curled around the holster of a gun that he pointed directly at Sherlock's chest.
But it was the sight of that one angry red line running along the left side of Sherlock's waist that suddenly caused an icy claw of cognition to close around John's heart.
They found a narrow path between the Ferris Wheel and the ghost train that led to the park's area behind the funfair where a long line of caravans stretched beneath the trees. They stood approximately fifty feet away, while on the lawn in front of the caravans, dozens of younger people were sitting in the high grass, taking a break from the turmoil on the other side of the funfair.
"And you-"the man-made a short gesture with the barrel into John's direction "–now use your left foot and shove that gun over here, or your friend has a hole in his chest."
When his friend tore it open, Mrs. Hudson had already reached the landing in front of their flat and was leaning with her right hand braced against the wall as she tried to catch her breath.
"You're lying," called Collins, panic rising in his voice.
It was a printout containing countless numbers and tables.
**~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*******~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~**
John leaped from his chair, following Sherlock instantly as he started for the door.
"So, the business is going to be sold, or someone outside the direct family has to take over."
"The man, Mrs. Hudson," Sherlock reminded, his voice more insistent this time.
John nodded. But he hadn't listened to a word Sherlock had said. Because suddenly, his friend was too close; far, far too close, his tight pressing against John's in the narrow carriage, an all-consuming, pleasant warmth was seeping through his jeans where their bodies touched.
"Can I get you something?" John asked. "A cup of tea, maybe?"
Forever.
"Has to be a storeroom or something," Sherlock said, handing him the flashlight.
A fond half-smile spread on Sherlock's face. "They are empty. All of them".
Not the flat. Not Baker Street. But with the man standing right across the room.
The older man must have merely nodded because John didn't hear a reply. A moment later, Sherlock's voice called from behind him again, "Lestrade? It's me. There's been a murder. The funfair in Roe Green Park. I need you here."
John's eyes flew up, meeting Sherlock's in shared realization. Their landlady wasn't angry. She was deeply disturbed about something.
"Don't move," Sherlock ordered quietly, giving him a rueful smile before he broke away from John's gaze and reached for the phone in his jacket.
The leaden silence that followed his conclusion lasted for a long while.
John pointed the beam of light at the lock, and several seconds later, a soft click echoed through the corridor.
"World Fair's," Sherlock replied with a casual wave of his hand as if the answer were self-evident. "Leading newspaper for the funfair industry."
Tearing his eyes away from his friend, John pursed his lips. His gaze was already drifting back to the text on the screen when he remembered the initial reason his writing had been interrupted.
Alone in the vehicle, John drew a shaky breath before he followed him into the night.
"Hah!" Sherlock exclaimed once they had passed the installation.
"Apparently so." Turning away to prepare the bandage, John hid a cheerless smile. Trust Sherlock to make the logical choice, of course, neither the easy nor the right one.
"Move, and I'll kill you," John said coolly. "Now, let the gun fall and shove it away with your foot. Slowly."
Swallowing hard, John closed his eyes, fighting for his composure, for his medical distance. He was a doctor. A soldier. His resolve couldn't break. Not now.
"Thank you." Sherlock nodded and grasped John by the elbow, leading him towards the entrance of the ghost train.
"Could be one of the staff, a worker," he said eventually. "Or maybe a guest from the funfair who sneaked inside the ghost train for some reason."
There was a pause.
Not that there was much to deduce about an angry landlady. John rolled his eyes and opened his mouth to voice exactly that notion when Sherlock held up a finger, instructing him to be silent.
Only seconds later, after a short detour to fetch his service gun from the drawer in the living room table, John followed him downstairs.
When he took a step closer, John saw the three nutshells subtly moved by wrinkled fingers.
They had just passed the corner of Kingsbury Road and Valley Drive when Sherlock told the cabbie to stop, and the car pulled into the small parking lot of a car seller. From there, it was only a short walk across the street to the park.
Had Collins' bullet hit only a few inches further to the right, he would have lost him.
"Missing?"
Another short pause.
A lot more.
"Not only the gains but the costs as well." Sherlock pointed with his index finger at the tables at the bottom of the page. "Somebody is using Hayes' firm to launder money in considerable proportions, and obviously, Alan Simmons discovered it."
**~~**
"John."
"People know we are here. And why," John bit out.
Christ, she had to be running up the staircase, he realized with an odd sense of foreboding.
"Yeah, sure you do." John rolled his eyes and placed his left palm on his friend's exposed stomach to hold him in place. Firmly ignoring the slight shudder he felt running through Sherlock's body at his touch, John turned back to tend to the injured skin tissue, careful not to open the wound again.
His friend's mouth curved slightly, pale blue eyes roaming over John's face as he moved closer, and John knew, he suddenly knew with absolute certainty that the impossible was happening: Sherlock was going to kiss him.
"Mrs. Hudson," Sherlock picked up his questioning again. "You said the police searched the ghost train? How long was that after you saw the murder?"
The next floor's corridor was as narrow as the one before; the only light that was falling into the room came from five or six small slits at the bottom of the right side of the wall. They ran, with some distance between them, down the corridor.
Crouching down next to an irregular, bluish spot with the diameter of a walnut, Sherlock traced the floor with his fingers. "Somebody wiped the blood away. Adequately enough for the remaining traces to be overlooked by the police without sufficient illumination. The murderer wasn't in a panic. He knew what he was doing once he had decided to kill."
Surges of people were passing through the main entrance of the funfair. A small girl with a candyfloss in her hand nearly bumped into John. He carefully steered her around and back towards her mother. Sherlock was already a few steps ahead in the crowd when he looked up again, waiting for him at the gate. In the sky above him hung a large banner in yellow and red.
"Well?" Sherlock asked gently once they had all found their place. He bent forward, resting his elbows on his thighs.
"John?" The question came promptly. Of course, it did. Sherlock's mind would never refrain from making deductions, even at the most inconvenient times.
The woman's eyes narrowed for a moment while she regarded Sherlock, who gave her a most charming smile. "Office caravan," she grunted eventually. "On the lawn behind the Ferris Wheel. But ya probably won't find him there. Left a few hours ago. If it's a business matter, you better speak to Mr. Hayes anyway. Try his caravan or the backside of the ghost train. Seen him there earlier. Some problems with the light since the thunderstorm yesterday that nobody seems to be able to fix."
"So, you do believe what Mrs. Hudson saw was a murder?" John asked after a while.
Sherlock stepped forward, placing a steadying hand beneath her elbow. "Mrs. Hudson?"
"Well, I know it might sound odd" –their landlady's gaze drifted nervously from Sherlock to John– "but on the ghost train. You know, Marie and I, we thought it would be fun. According to the papers, it is the largest in Europe, and –"
"John."
"Meiringen, Switzerland. A plane is already waiting."
"Ah, you know who I am, then." A false smile spread on the man's face, revealing a line of crooked teeth. "But who says I'm going to kill you? Maybe you two will just have a little accident."
John closed the distance between and glanced into the room from which Sherlock had just emerged. It was the niche with the installation of Jack the Ripper.
John felt a rush of nausea rise high in his throat when the full meaning of the sight hit him. He looked away and squeezed his eyes shut. But the image wouldn't go away as if burnt into his mind.
He hadn't realized it, not truly. Not until he had seen Sherlock at the pool. Brilliant, dangerous, and–for once–not indifferent. For once, something had mattered more to his friend than the game, the chase, than being right. For once, Sherlock had cared.
"Sherlock?"
John nodded nevertheless, and a moment later, he saw his friend's whole body freeze while he listened to his brother.
"Christ, Sherlock." John sucked in a breath, putting the gun down.
"Hello, Mrs. Hudson." He tried for a reassuring grin when Sherlock gestured for her to step inside. She looked pale and more than a little shaken.
"Then, he isn't necessarily the owner of Mrs. Hudson's ghost train?" John asked, handing Sherlock his ticket.
"Maybe thirty or forty minutes later. It took some convincing until an officer went inside with the owner, Mr. Hayes. Terrible man, that one. No manners at all. When they came back without finding a body, he dared to suggest I might have mistaken the Jack the Ripper installation for real. Can you believe it, Sherlock? As if–" Mrs. Hudson had to swallow "–as if I were some old biddy." She shook her head, sniffling quietly while she pulled a hanky from the handbag and brushed her nose.
"Alan Simmons," Sherlock announced meanwhile, sounding disturbingly unmoved. "Thirty-nine. Married. Apparently, he was an accountant."
"Stow it!" Collins barked, cocking the gun. However, Sherlock didn't stop.
His friend's voice was dripping scorn, but John noted that he sounded strained as if in a lot of pain when he asked, "Mr. Hayes, are you alright?"
And with every passing day, the frustrated frown on his friend's face became more profound, the shadows beneath his eyes more visible. It was as if the continuing failure to catch his archenemy was eating Sherlock from the inside like a slow, burning fire; and the thought made John's heart clench in his chest.
"It's over, Randel! I've heard it all," said the man, whom John was sure was nobody else than Albert Hayes. "The police will be here any minute."
He glanced around, his gaze searching for Sherlock. He had been only a few steps ahead of John, but now, there was no trace of him. Moving carefully forward, John pulled his gun from the waistband of his slacks.
"Sherlock," he called when he realized it was a folded piece of paper.
It was almost six o'clock when they finally reached Roe Green Park. With its large Ferris Wheel looming into the early evening sky, the funfair was already visible from afar when their cab entered Kingsbury Road.
And when he did, Sherlock stood right next to him, looking at him. Really looking at him, the pale blue eyes were filled with that same longing John recognized in his mirror every morning.
"Some people would say they are having fun, Sherlock," John replied, unable to suppress a grin.
Still quite inexplicably, they had both survived the explosion that night, thanks to Lestrade and his team.
"Sherlock!" No response.
"And why did they have that argument in the back of a ghost train in the first place?" John added. "Not the likeliest spot for a discussion."
But he wasn't prepared to have this discussion.
"And how do you know all that?" John asked, clasping his hands behind his back while he walked beside Sherlock. "I never realized you had a special interest in the Travelling Amusement Industry."
"Oh well, we were only a few meters when he appeared in the background of the one with the werewolves. Now that I think about it, he stumbled backward. Ordinary guy. Short, dark hair. Regular build. Your age, maybe. But that's hard to tell with you boys these days." She smiled briefly before she continued. "It looked as if he was arguing with somebody. I remember I was about to say something about it to Marie. She was searching for something in her handbag at that moment, you know. But then, I didn't because the man, he raised his hands as if to protect himself." Mrs. Hudson paused, opening her eyes. "That's–that's when it happened, Sherlock. But he was gone again before I could tell Marie."
After sharing a short glance with Sherlock, he pulled his gun from his waistband and moved to point the flashlight at the door while Sherlock placed his hand on the door, pushing it slowly open and stepping inside.
"What?" John spluttered. "I mean, how? Even the police didn't find one when they went looking for it."
"Sherlo-ock." Mrs. Hudson shifted unhappily on the sofa. "Is this thing really necessary?" She gestured with a hand towards her closed eyes. "I feel rather silly talking to you like this."
From the corner of his eye, John saw Sherlock dart forward, using Collins' momentarily distraction to pounce on the man, crashing him into the wall.
"And who would that be, sonny? That nosey, old lady? Yeah, I've heard about her. Albert called me after the police had left; he thought she was barking mad. Believe me, she won't have a flicker of doubt once the people I work with are done with you."
**~~**
There was no immediate response from Sherlock, but John heard him call his name an instant later. He spun around, finding his friend standing in front of the left side of the wall, opposite the curtain with the werewolves behind it.
**~~**
He was probably six feet high with a heavy paunch beneath his dark shirt. He had a round, wrinkled face. He was wearing a broad stache under his knobbly nose, and there was a tuft of thick white hair on his head. Something about his whole appearance reminded John of a circus director; only the grim line of his mouth wouldn't fit with the rest of the image.
"Where do you think, John? Upstairs," Sherlock replied, his voice sharp with impatience.
Heaving her shoulders, their landlady breathed out a small puff of air. "Ooh, the officers didn't believe me. They thought I was making things up when they didn't find the body. Even Marie did."
"My apologies, Mrs. Hudson. But I need you to maximize your visual memory. Think again, what makes you believe it was a man?"
What if they never caught Moriarty? What if that one great game never ended?
"I am lying still," Sherlock snapped, only to shift away on the stretcher a heartbeat later when the cotton swab with antiseptic agent touched the wound.
"Thanks, love. But no." Mrs. Hudson shook her head while Sherlock maneuvered her towards the sofa. He waited for her to sit down before he took the spot next to her, studying her out of the corner of his eye.
"And you are taking ridiculously long for this," Sherlock bit out in an impatient, frustrated huff.
"Sherlock, you really have to try to lie still," John admonished as he set out for another attempt to clean the flesh wound at the left side of his friend's midriff. He had only been able to stop the bleeding moments ago.
When Sherlock opened it, John wished for a moment; he hadn't been looking. The first thing that appeared inside the wallet was the picture of two small children, probably not older than six or seven. They were smiling and waving into the camera.
John nodded, his jaw set in grim determination. So, this was it then, the moment Sherlock had waited for. The final round of the game.
"Marie?" John asked.
A few moments later, they walked past a large group of teenagers standing around one of the funfair stalls. They were loudly cheering for a guy trying to throw small, wooden rings around stone blocks.
"There was no knife, John! In the Ripper installation!" his friend exclaimed, rubbing his palms against each other. "Mrs. Hudson cannot have mistaken the Ripper installation for real, when the knife isn't even there! I need to get inside that ghost train. All the essential data to solve this case has to be there."
"The body has to be still inside," Sherlock declared, glancing around.
"You said the police were already on the way, Albert," he bit out, turning his head towards the man.
Starts Friday, 29th April. Ends May 2nd. Opening Hours: 1 pm – 11 pm."
"These are annual accounts and calculations of passenger numbers for over a dozen funfair rides of Hayes Leisure Entertainment," Sherlock said a few moments later, his eyes flitting over the paper. "According to those, the reported gains for each of them in the last two years lie up to 20% higher than the maximum amount of passengers the rides could transport and therefore earn."
It didn't take long until they eventually located it. The ghost train stood next to the Ferris Wheel at the far end of the funfair, its bright green lights illuminating the grotesque paintings of several villains, ghosts, and monsters that graced the front side of the approximately thirty feet high building. At the top, the words "Blackwood Castle" glowed conspicuously in the dusk while, beneath, a banner announced, "Europe's Largest Ghost Train!"
For several seconds, the only sound in the room was the echo of their landlady's fast approaching steps in the hallway.
"The figure is usually holding one. Look." Sherlock pointed towards the raised right plastic hand that seemed to be curled around thin air. "This wasn't a planned murder. Why kill a grown man with a knife when it's far safer to use a gun. Nobody would have heard the shot over the noise of the ghost train. No, the murderer hadn't known he was going to kill when he first came here. But he knew where to find a weapon when he needed one. He knows this part of the ghost train. Probably works or has worked here."
"Sherlock!" John called, running after him. When he reached him, Sherlock was already pacing forth and back next to a food booth, selling popcorn and candy apples.
Not now.
Therefore, Sherlock and his presence at the crime scene would only be needed once Lestrade and his men would arrive to interview them.
"The knife, John. The murderer has taken it from here," his friend announced, gesturing towards something on the other side of the curtain.
When he turned back, the bandage in his hands, Sherlock was lying flat on the stretcher again, eyes closed, his torso heaving calmly beneath the open shirt. John had long known that his friend was far too thin, ribs illustrated beneath his impossibly pale skin.
"Mycroft's people have located him."
The corridor was long and narrow and completely painted in black; an iron ladder stood at its end while uncounted electricity cables covered the high walls.
But... This morning he'd been awaken by the sound of his door being opened not-so-slowly, followed by not-so-quiet tiptoes. Then a muffled 'Lock ? You asleep ? Dad said no to wake you..." He had promised Rosie to bring her to the park that morning. The spring has settled in and she loved watching bugs as much as he did, though she prefered ants over bees. "Ants are more funny", she said. "Funnier", he'd replied, though he didn't get her point. Bees were so much more... Focus, Sherlock, not the point here.
"It smells a lot like cinnamom for an experiment"
"You remember what I told you ? That I was gonna make a deduction, and if I were right, you would tell me so."
"I just missed you today. Missed your warmth. You're so warm... " Sherlock got closer, practically putting himself on Jonh's lap on the sofa. He started kissing his neck, then went lower and lower.
"I wish you told me more about what happened to you, so I could avoid any trigger. And I'm not just talking about your time away. I'm not that thick. I know there are many things you're not telling me. I don't ask you anything now, just saying, if you ever feel like talking about anything, I'll listen."
"I... ok, maybe I imagined things. But... think about it, please ? I..."
A month and a half ago, after a few minutes of stunned silence and some stuttering, John had taken his impromptu declaration with an interesting mix of joy, relief and enthousiasm, and responded in kind. The love card had been a bold move, Sherlock knew that, but he also thought than John would not risk their friendship for anything less. And it worked.
"I love you in whatever outfit you happen to be wearing, that's not the same..."
"And I'm not asking how you know that. You did seem to think he was a virgin a few years ago, though."
Thanks to anyone who came that far, hope you liked it !
And, worst than that, he realised that he loved their new arrangement. Loosing John before would have been excrutiating. Loosing him now would be simply unbearable.
Sherlock just nodded and waited.
Sherlock smiled back and went to fecth a plate. In front of the oven, he took deep breathes and tried to put his thoughts together. He had made a plan on his way back, now he just needed to sort a few details and to find a good timing. He went back to the sitting room and sat at his desk.
"Oh, you're back ! I left you some risotto in the oven. You did promise me three meals today, you still owe me one !"
"So if... when this is all sorted, you'll yell at me ?" Sherlock said, sounding strangely hopeful.
Sherlock's throat was so tight he couldn't speak. But he felt a warm and unusual feeling in his chest, too. Was it hope ? He raised his head, looked John in the eyes, and nodded.
"It was the only time." Sherlock said. " I... it was a suicide mission. Mycroft said six months. And I couldn't... After my time away, after Serbia of course, but that wasn't even the worst. I couldn't bear the idea of being all alone again. Facing death seemed so much better. I'm so scared of loneliness. Even more since I met you. The drugs take away that fear, but I realise they make it so more likely to come true. I've been alone for a long time. For most of my life. And whenever I tried not to be... It didn't go well. The drugs make me feel acceptable, appropriate. I still crave these feelings. But staying on drugs might make you leave. It might make me dangerous for Rosie. It might make Lestrade put me away from cases. I can't say I don't want the drugs, but there are things I want more. Does that make sense ?"
What the hell had Sherlock done ?
"I'm going to do that again, ok ?"
John wanted someone who would eat and sleep and generally keep healthy habits, but not so much that he wouldn't have to take care of them. He loved taking care of people. And he had a special fondness in feeding Sherlock. So not too much change in that regard, let him feel needed. Sherlock could safely go on pretending he didn't know were the nearest Tesco was.
"Because I want you, Sherlock, not any character that could meet all my expectations. I want the real you".
"Shut up, you fool, I still think he's way too young to take care of himself. I know my kids are gifted, but he'll be surounded by adults, and he's just a kid ! Two years are a lot of time at his age. So what was I saying ? Yes, don't forget my cousin Lina in High Wycombe, you can call her if..."
John felt suddenly ill. It didn't make sense. Were they that well-matched ? But they hadn't been before, or they had, in their own way, but they've never been in perfect tune. They were more complementary than identical. Flashes appeared in his mind. Sherlock having cooked exactly the food he had been craving all day when he came back home after work - God, Sherlock cooking was in itself a small miracle, but the man made it look like he enjoyed it so much... Sherlock asking for time alone with Rosie whenever John himself felt overwhelmed or exhausted. Sherlock disappearing whenever John felt like being left alone, and seeming to appear out of thin air whenever he felt lonely. Sherlock playing exactly the kind of music he felt like listening, and stopping as soon as he has had enough. Sherlock always willing in bed, whenever John was in the mood, whatever John had in mind.
"Here we are again, watching him do his thing like we're all useless."
"It's fine, John, I did push you quite hard and I could do it again, it's not as if you're the only one to blame."
"But... Yes, right, John, I swear I'll stop you if... things ever get out of control for you."
"Of course I am ! Whatever you do, you don't deserve to be hit... You know that don't you ?"
He was smiling and sounded genuinely pleased to see Sherlock, not at all put off by his sudden departure.
The next morning had been quiet but not tense. John left early to spend some time with Rosie before heading to work, not without giving Sherlock a prescription in case he sufferred from any withdrawal symptoms. They decided to meet for lunch.
Sherlock was out of his depth. A million plausible excuses and deflections came to his mind but none could do the trick. That was it then. Game over, you lose.
Sherlock ate in silence for a while, and John went back to his book. Sherlock kept looking at him discreetly, and began to put a mental list together.
"I see your point here. It's just so far from what I've been thinking for so long..."
But John loved attention. No more mind palace time when he was there, and obviously no more sulking. Of course Sherlock would have to see when John wanted him there and when he needed space, but that was easy enough. Sherlock made a mental note to ask Lestrade for a bunch of cold cases. He would need to keep them at the ready for the times John needed action. Cases draw him towards Sherlock in the first place, Sherlock had to keep that in mind.
"And it's been hard on you. So hard you needed release, one way or another. Hence the drugs."
Then he run down the stairs, grabbed his coat and was gone, leaving a gobsmacked John in the kitchen, an empty spoon in his hand.
"Rosie's perfectly fine. She'll be with Molly tonight." John was still facing the kitchen's wall. Breathe. He turn around. "You and I need to talk"
"Love, please, promise me."
After Mary, after Eurus, after this whole fiasco, they had settled on one rule : no more secrets, no more assuming the other knew what one of them was about.
"You said it all before, you know he got it the first time !" His father sounded more amused than annoyed.
John kissed him tenderly.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock felt a bit bold, the teasing being so innocent but so far from the way he had interacted with John since they became lovers. So close to whom Sherlock really was, in fact.
"And I didn't think for a moment you would hit me. Scold me a bit, maybe, that's all. My gesture had nothing to do with you, I just reacted. I'm not afraid of you or what you could do to me."
"I... if you're sure... I... oh yes ! Don't stop !"
Spring had made an early appearance that day,  so they found themselves sitting on a pub terrace in the sun. John asked him about the meds – bought and taken – his current physical state – meds working, no withdrawal symptoms worth mentioning, except some intermittent shakes – his cravings – very present but bearable - and they exchanged small talks until they orders had been taken.
I've always wanted you, I just never thought you would want me too. I want to try again, not for you, but with you."
John did, puzzled. It was pictures of Sherlock. Just three pictures, and John felt his world crumble. The pictures weren't that good, but the meaning was clear. Sherlock was back on drugs.
"What 's all that ?" John stood in the kitchen, a freshly retrieved from day care and very sleepy Rosie in his arms.
"Stop it, John, please. I'm not afraid of you. I forgave you, you know that, and that move right now had nothing to do with you."
Sherlock had never felt more grateful for Rosie's timing. But it wasn't over, and he needed to be more careful.
"Yes ! Our new arrangement worked so well in the beginnig.. But I knew I couldn't be it for you, I knew it was never going to last... But then you started to have doubts so soon, I knew I failed even more than I usually do, and I couldn't bear it... I panicked. I couldn't think straight. And the drugs help me focuse, they really do... They made me able to try again."
He had the warmest smile ever, and Sherlock couldn't resist and kissed him again.
Since then, things had been good, John being considerate and gentle -as predicted - and frankly not asking a lot – nothing out of Sherlock's comfort zone anyway. It was so good that Sherlock even took to initiate sexual encounters at times, something he had never done before. Sex had always been an ordeal or a mean to an end. He couldn't let himself become needy though, and had to keep in mind John's needs were first and foremost. That had to stay the rule, with sex like with everything else.
"Sherlock, I have to ask, and you have to know that either way, I'm not leaving the flat : do you want to be with me, I mean as a lover, and without considering what I want ?" John suddenly asked.
"No. Never. I have... places. I never brought anything here."
Sherlock looked at John warily, but John just seemed to wait for him to go on. So he did.
John came towards him with an angry look. Sherlock couldn't help himself, he flinched and started to raise his arms to protect his face, then realised his move and let them fall down. If hitting him was what John needed now, he should not deny him.
"But a lot of it happened years ago and I didn't have the means to keep him on check as efficiently as I do now. So don't ask me what happened to him, I don't know. I just saw the effects on him."
Sherlock had been thrilled by Lestrade call : a locked room murder, not as exciting as a serial killer, but second best ! And here he was, seemingly oblivious to the body on the couch, but fascinated by the wallpaper pattern. Sally and John were standing at the door, while Lestrade was busy answering a phone call.
"I still have Rosie to think about, and as much as I want to be with you, I'll never put her in danger. Do you have anything here in the flat ?"
"He's way easier and more considerate at home. In fact we're never arguing. Never about anything of importance anyway."
"So does Sherlock."
""Are you implying he's been abused ?""
Now his options were scarce : let John seek another girlfriend who might take him away, or try to fulfill his needs himself, with the risk of putting him off entirely, like he had everybody else.
Sherlock was doing his best to use a light tone, and he could see John relax a bit, but not entirely.
"Of course I do, love."
But these days, Sherlock always agreed with him. Or to be more precise, Sherlock always seemed to have had from the start the same opinion that John had. The same wishes. The same tastes in a lot of things too. And the same needs. At the same time.
After a quick trip at the chemist's, Sherlock spent the whole morning on a cold case a former client had sent him by mail. This woman's great grandmother had been accused of poisoning her husband with chloroform. Yet, she admitted to have bought the product – her husband was abusive – but not to have given it to him. Way more strangely, his stomach was full of the product, but there were no burns to his throat. She had been aquitted, but a hundred years later the mystery still lingered, and the great granddaughter wanted Sherlock's idea. Or ideas. At the end of the morning, he still had three likely theories. He put them aside and went to join John.
"Come on, Dr. Watson. You did realise in the past few weeks that my brother has... issues that tend to be exacerbated by intimacy."
Rosie had been fussy all morning. She didn't seem to remember any word except "no", didn't want to eat and didn't find any of her favourite toys interesting. Of course, she didn't want to take her afternoon nap either, and putting her to sleep had been a hardship. And then, a minute ago, she finally fell asleep. John tiptoed outside of her room, relieved. A very loud bang came from downstairs.
"Because I won't. Ever. Again. I'm so ashamed I did it in the past, especially with what happened to you..." John was making every word very clear.
John knew he was being unfair, but Mycroft judgemental tone was suddenly unbearable. To his astonishment, Mycroft didn't argue and just waved at the driver. The car stopped, and John got out immediatly.
The tension increased, and Sherlock spent more and more time awake at night, trying to think about the day before, checking his attitude and making mental notes about things he could have done better.
"Daaaaaaaad ???"
"Honestly ? I need a perfect grade, and I suck at chemistry. Everyone says you're a freak, but the best with this stuff, so..."
-  "I... The case... Just remembered loose ends... Don't wait up..."
John came closer and rest his head on Sherlock's shoulder. It was nice, comforting, and Sherlock allowed himself to enjoy it. A moment later, John added :
"I believe you. Perhaps I don't really understand what it entails, though" Sherlock replied.
" Sherlock, you don't think I'm gonna hit you, do you ?"
"Sherlock, please, stop a moment. Do you think you have to do that to please me ?"
"Should I go on, Captain ?" He pulled John's pants down and started licking the head of his cock.
The taxi ride back home had been a tense one. They went back to a still asleep Rosie. They had been gone only an hour and a half, and she just had begun her nap when they left. John profusely thanked Mrs. Hudson for watching her - ("really, John, you know it's my pleasure, and I didn't even got to see her ! Bring her to me later, will you ?")
"Dr. Watson, pleasure's mine." Mycroft's voice was low, and he looked concerned, but then, when didn't he ? John didn't have time to ask himself more questions, Mycroft just gave him a brown file.
"It would not be the first time an intimate relationship would end with my brother overdosing in a drug den somewhere. Hence my presence here, to avoid such a dreadful ending"."
Another call from upstairs
"I said and did a lot of crap. There's something bigger going on here, so no one is leaving. At least not until I see the whole picture. So you, Sherlock Holmes, are going to talk. No lie, no avoidance, I want the truth. All of it"
"How can you be so calm about all this ?" Whispered Sherlock in the dark
"Oh excuse me my Lord if crimes these days are too dull for His Majesty. As if you ever make tea in the first place." Lestrade replied in a derisive tone.
His conclusion had been a bitter one. No need to compare the data with the facts stored in his mind palace, he knew they could never match. He wasn't that naive, even in those matters. In this area, he was doomed to fail.
"And I hit you when you came back, when you were still hurt. And that time in the morgue... You were dying and... I'll never deserve your forgiveness for that. And right now, if I looked so frightening that it reminded you of being tortured..." John sounded desperate.
"You're awfully affectionate tonight. Not that I complain, but you're usually not that straightforward... " John said, smiling.
Thaddeus left him two months later, telling him he was too much trouble for his worth. Being alone was even worst now he had had a taste of companionship.
So they had a full breakfast, had been strolling Regent's park for the best part of three hours, and been back for lunch. Then nap (on Rosie's part), a bit of tyding up (on John's part) a bit of research on case-related stuff (on his part). By the end of the day, Rosie was playing in the sitting room, telling herself elaborated stories, and John had been cooking a very good-smelling thing. Then all hell broke loose
"Come on, love, let's go to bed."
"Excuse me if I don't believe that", replied Sally, "You must be the most patient of men !"
"I can't say I'm not angry, love, because of course I am. You know I am. But can you believe, just for now, that I don't want to lose you either ?"
"...bit scary here. Sherlock ? You're with me ?"
Something was very, very wrong.
"Yes..."
"No you don't ! You can't. I'm selfish and dismissive and rude, I'm not worth your trouble, and you could do so much better...." Sherlock voice broke.
Sherlock realised he had looked everywhere but at John during his speech, so he raised his head slowly. Telling the truth was so foreign to him, he felt at the same time exhausted and extremely relieved. John was staring at him with very bright eyes. He reached for Sherlock hand on the table.
When he came down a good quarter of an hour later, nothing looked out of order. Sherlock was working on an experiment and didn't seem hurt at all, but he did look at John warily.
"Sherlock, have a seat. Here, tea's ready. No one is leaving for now."
"Come on cupcake, it's too early to sleep, wake up a bit..." the bathroom door closed and Sherlock only heard muffled sounds.
The boy – Albert -  he shared his room with wanted to be a lawyer like all the males in his family had been for eons. He was two years older than him, like everybody in his year was, and assured Sherlock's mother he would protect him . But Sherlock quickly deduced he had been passing his tests by bribing the right people. He meant it nicely, thinking it took some skills to know who would take a bribe and who wouldn't. But Albert was furious, and then took to ignore him entirely.
Not really a choice then, he just had to be better this time.
Sherlock needed to think. Maybe he'd been wrong, that would certainly not be the first time. Especially when it came to these – sentiments, not his area. He had thought about it a lot after his birthday, nearly two years ago.
Not as long as you stay with me, at least, Sherlock thought. Not something John would want to hear, for sure.
Sherlock realised it wasn't at all what John wanted to hear, and his choice of words had been a very bad one. He chose quickly another path.
Sherlock knew he wasn't supposed to do that kind of thing these days. Things between them were so much better. Now they talked. Sort of.
"I didn't when we started. Not really."
John hated above all his own inner violence, so no pushing him. Sherlock didn't think that changing their relationship would lead John to new outbursts of violence, but then he had never been good at predecting those. If that happened, he would have no other choice but to endure it.  He could live with being roughed up a bit, but he couldn't risk John leaving because John himself couldn't stand his own acts. Sherlock didn't have enough data to know for certain what would happen, so this point would need further exploration.
"Sorry, got a bit lost in my mind. What were you saying ?"
John went back to Rosie for another round  of lullabies and sweet pleas.
John chuckled, rolled his eyes and went to give Rosie her bath, trying to wake her up gently :
The truth was, he was so scared of being right, so scared of discovering Sherlock had felt pressured, or coerced in any way. Not only would it make him lose his lover, his best friend, the second most important person in his life, but it would make him nothing short of a monster.
"Sherlock I just want to be sure... Oh... "Sherlock had started stroking his cock trough his pants.
"I've never been good at relationship, you know that. When I realised you were attracted to me, I didn't even considered what I wanted. It was just a choice between giving you what you wanted and taking the risk to lose you.
"Ok, let's say I believe you." John clearly still had doubts. "I still need to know that you will not let me hurt you, or anyone else, ever again." Sherlock knew John thought above all of Rosie, and the idea that John could hurt her seemed so ridiculous he nearly snorted. But John was dead serious.
"Why ?"
"As you're perfectly aware, as high and mighty my brother can be with most people, he would let his very few loved ones do absolutely anything to him without raising a finger to stop them. He lacks any sense of self preservation, and has never been good at choosing his partners. I've yet to figure if you're breaking that pattern or not." Mycroft paused, looking at John with ice-cold eyes. John certainly didn't want to let Mycroft of all people scold him, but he still felt his face burn with shame. Of course Sherlock had been abused. John himself had seen to that. It wasn't far stretched to imagine other people could have taken it even further.
"I'm happy you know, about us. What we have. It's good."
"What was that noise anyway ? Nothing seemed to have exploded, so what happened ?" John asked, stopping Sherlock train of thought and clearly trying to lighten the mood.
"I asked you if you want to pair up with me." Sherlock raised his head and blinked dumbly at the boy standing in front of him. The chemistry teacher had given them a project to be done by pair, and he had ignored it, knowing by then that no one would work with him. And then, here was this boy... Thaddeus if he remembered correctly, waiting for his answer with a smirk.
"Do I look like I don't want it, John ? I though about it all day. And since you came back I could barely think of anything else. It's been so long..." He opened John's flies. "Do you want me to beg ?" Sherlock added teasingly "I don't do that, but I could make an exception...."
Being intimate with John wasn't repulsive. Sherlock had to admit he had entertained the though a few times, even when he was convinced John would never be amenable to the idea. He just hoped John's tastes would not be too peculiar – he knew John had been vanilla enough with his past girlfriends, but would he stay that way with someone like him ? Sherlock could endure lots of things, but he couldn't deny he had issues. Some things could trigger very bad reactions, but denying John anything would be even worse...
"Yes.
John had a warm smile on his face, but his eyes showed his concern.
John seemed to give some thoughts to his answer, and Sherlock hoped he would let it go. In the same time, a mental note was engraved in his brain. Never underestimate John's observation skills ever again.
"You know what," John went on, "don't answer that now. Take your time. We're going to have a quiet evening, and whenever you'll be ready, I'll hear you out. And we'll go on from there."
The quiet banter went on for the rest of the lunch, and they eventually went their separate ways, John promising to be back home early.
That was in times like that that Sherlock trully appreciated his brain abilities to work at light-like speed. It was like having a big flashing red light inside his head : danger zone, time to give your best.
The waitress arrived with their orders, giving Sherlock a few minutes to gather his thoughts. When she left, he started.
"I'm fine thanks, just tired. It... all went well."
Sherlock took it, gave him a puzzled look and unfolded the picture.
"Sherlock ? You remember that time I deduced your birthday ?"
Sherlock agreed, and their work sessions had started. It was nice to speak with someone. Thaddeus was witty and had a dry sense of humor that Sherlock understood better than common jokes. He wanted their sessions to last. So he did his best to keep himself in check, never voicing his deductions about his co-coworker or anyone else, trying to get along with Thaddeus' moods, agreeing with all the other boy's opinions, even the most inane ones.
"Ok, that's good. It means you have hidden stashes everywhere in London, but it's still good. So how bad is it ? If you were to stop right now, should we expect any side effects ?"
And it worked, mostly. John seemed happy, balanced, confident. John trust him again. He let him watch his daughter alone, for Christ sake ! They laughed, run after criminals, argued about inane things such as keeping experiments too close to things they were supposed to eat. Long gone were the guilt and the hard feelings. And then...
"You do realise that's not the point. The wallpaper was a bit tricky, I'll give you that, but how come none of your lovely team saw the victim's shirt wasn't the right size ? Did you want to make fun of me ? That's it, this case has to be a joke !"
"Of course I do. How could it be a bad thing ?"
"Mycroft, nice to see you, to what do I owe the plesasure ?"
John was spread out on the sofa with a book when Sherlock went back.
"Because you chose me ! I.. you have many friends, and colleagues, so if one of them is a freak, it's not a big deal. You can find balance elsewhere. And we have the cases, you love our adventures, so putting up with me to get that was a good deal. But as a lover, you made it clear you'll only have me. And I love that ! I wouldn't have wanted you to go on seeing other people but it would have been a way to keep things balanced..."
"John, I think I'm in love with you."
John didn't bring the subject back the day after. Not the one after that. Not the next one. It had been five days now, and Sherlock felt more and more anxious. Was he trying to hard ? Was it showing ? Should he had let John unsatisfied at times just to avoid raising his suspicions ?
Sally sounded bitter but she forced herself to smile. She had warmed a lot to Sherlock since he came back from his faked death, but still had trouble accepting his quirks.
"Good. I need time too, I need to start all over again and do it right this time."John smiled.
Then John happened. He had been the exception, seeming to actually like Sherlock from the start and to find his countless flaws tolerable. He thought about it, and came to the conclusion that John could accept him as long as his life was well balanced by other people. John string of girlfriends had been something of a nuisance, but a neccessity. With Mary, it had been perfect : shooting part left aside, she had genuinely liked Sherlock and understood his relashionship with John. After the first months of marital bliss, she would never have drove them apart.
"Yeeees... Aren't you supposed to be some sort of weird genius ? What word don't you understand ?"
They never needed to negotiate anything. Sherlock wanted the exact same thing that he did, every time. It couldn't be... Sherlock was so natural, so spontaneous, but still, John should have seen it before.
Sherlock looked at John blankly. He seemed totally at loss.
"Yes ?" Sherlock sounded puzzled.
"Complete you as a human being". It still didn't make sense, not in his experience anyway. He had even researched it. Couples, romantic entanglements. Lots of data were to be found. None made sense.
"Are you seriously complaining because I'm too easy to live with ? That's certainly a first !" Sherlock did his best to sound amused. Then he went on seriously. "You do make me a better man, John. You're my conductor of light, after all", he added with a smile.
He craved something stronger. The self-empowerment of cocaine. The oblivion of heroin. Shooting up wasn't an option, the marks would be too obvious for John, wherever he put the needle. But he had chosen more inconspicuous ways of using in the past when needed. Less satisfactory maybe, but still good enough. And he could keep his habit in check, he knew he could. Cocaine would help him think, make him better, take away the deep feeling of inadequacy that made him want to run away before John left. He could take just enough to be able to try again.
Later, when they lay in bed, sweety and sated, John had watched him fondly.
Mycroft went on.
John had thought so for a long time. That still hurt to hear it. He didn't really get how this was related to their current situation, but deep down, a part of him had always wondered and always needed to know. He had asked for the whole truth, and that was Sherlock giving it to him, in his own "all-or-nothing" way. That was Sherlock showing how far he was willing to go to save their relationship, and, however overwhelmed John was feeling, he realised there was hope for them.
"Did Donovan say something ? You've been tense since I left you with her at the crime scene. Is it this freak think again ? Because I don't care about her opinion. I only care about how you see me..." It was time to give a go at deflection. He put on his most seductive smile and moved towards John. "And you could see all of me right now, if you wanted to..."
"Oh God, like I've never yelled before" John answered fondly.
John licked his lips and let Sherlock slowly stroke his arm. Then they heard Rosie calling for them.
"Couldn't he at least keep us informed of what he's doing?"
"Still, you didn't exactly answer my question."
John felt suddenly very, very cold.
So John's belief that romantic entanglements were a way to improve one's life only meant one thing : one day John would leave. Sherlock didn't know if he could go through another wedding, another best man speech.
"So we'll see. I can help you with the physical aspect of things, obviously, but the psychological one is the most important. So, do you actually want to stop ?"
"I fail to see the difference."
"I... yes ?"
Oh. John needed reassurance about his self-control, not an outlet for his anger then.
"I should be the one asking you that, don't you thing ?" His voice was impossibly low.
"Sherlock, we'll agree your brother's an insufferable git, but that's not the point here. And don't give me a "that's for a case" crap, we both know it's not. So why ?"
Sherlock bend over to lick the spoon. He hummed in delight and was ready to tell John how good it was, when he saw it. John's pupils had darkened a bit, and as Sherlock stood back, John was watching his lips with an unmistakable air of arousal. John wants me, was the only thought that crossed Sherlock's brain before he panicked.
For the next six months or so, Sherlock's other efforts to find a common ground with the other boys all went sour. He shared his time between the library and the chemistry lab, and tried to ignore the only thing college had taught him so far : loneliness is a very vivid feeling.
"I had to try... "
"Not your business, Mycroft. Why would you think Sherlock and I being a thing would lead him to that ?"
"Nothing serious, I guess. I don't really know, it's been a while but I really tried to keep it light."
"Wow, that was... Thank you. I'm so glad you told me this. Let's do that, then. Start all over again. I love you, and I want to tell you until you believe me."
So they had tea, and dinner, and sat together on the sofa to watch one of this crap television show John seemed to love. Sherlock was lost in his thoughts for a long time. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, he started talking.
The case had been closed in exactly 57 minutes, and Sherlock was complaining to Lestrade.
"It's not about telling me what I want to hear, Sherlock. Oh God. We should have had that talk weeks ago. That's how it is for you, isn't it ? You want to be what you think I want you to be"
"So you had to be perfect to prove me I've made the right decision in choosing you."
Sherlock felt a lump in his throat and just nodded, not trusting his voice. He'd done wrong again, burdening John with his issues when he should only make his life easier. And letting him guess something was off. If he didn't do better, John would soon decide their relationship was not worth his trouble...
"John ? Where is Rosie ? Did something happen ? Is she alright ?"
"I... think you should keep the flat. Rosie school's arrangements have all been made for next year, and she could keep the same day care. Plus Mrs. Hudson is always here..."
"I'm aware of the recent evolution of your relationship with my brother. These are the consequences. Don't get me wrong, though, I don't put all the blame on you."
"You were looking at me like I'm one of your experiments, I don't really mind but it's a bit unsettling, I'd like my body parts to stay together and nowhere near the fridge."
Sherlock did his best to look calm and uninterested, but he was indeed nervous. High school had been barely tolerable, college might not be much better, and this time he wouldn't even have the safe haven of home at night. He never got along well with people outside his family, and actually living with his peers could hardly go well. He let his mother voice fade away and looked outside the car window.
"But then you'll leave. Everybody leaves."
A friend of Thaddeus', Alexander, asked him out. He was way more controlling and liked to keep Sherlock in check, explaining him what he should say, what he needed to do to be accepted. He was also into much rougher sex, and didn't really take no for an answer.
"John, you won't. I know you won't." Sherlock said firmly.
After asking Sherlock a million times if he was sure and willing and ready, and a thousand inane questions to ensure his informed consent, they had fallen in bed that very same night.
He tried to pay attention to John's every move and expression, but it was even harder now because John was more distant. Sherlock felt exhausted. Sleeping was difficult. Eating was an ordeal.
Two weeks... John froze. It had been a few days after their aborted conversation about their relationship. He had wanted to talk with Sherlock about his doubts lots of time since his first attempt, but he never did, (except that half-hearted try the first time Sherlock had initiated sex after their conversation).
He fought the tears gathering in his eyes. He was pathetic.
As soon as they were in bed, John hugged Sherlock closely.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"They really do help, I mean the drugs. They make me stronger, and more focused, and they take boredom away. And of course, there is the high. It does feel so good, you know. Like my mind is on fire, but a perfectly controlled fire, or like everything is finally quiet."
Usually, John would have found this funny, but he was way too nervous. Sherlock noticed, obviously, and immediatly stopped his fussing. That did nothing to ease John's concerns.
"Sleep, you need it, and I'll be there when you wake up."
"Fuck you, Mycroft. Let me out of this car right now."
"No, really, everything goes extremely smoothly..."
"You really believe that, don't you ? Why don't you let me judge for myself ?"
A look that lingered. Increase or decrease of John usual speaking ryhthm. The way he moved. Since the beginning of their now sentimental (sexual ?) relationship, Sherlock got better and better at knowing not only when Joh wanted sex but what and how it would satisfy him the most.
"These pictures have been taken but my team four days ago. The evidences aren't entirely conclusive, but it would appear Sherlock started using about two weeks ago."
"I need to go pick her up, we'll talk about it later, ok ?"
"Yes, John." Sherlock seemed very tense. So far from the dismissive way he had seemed to receive that sentence the first time.
"I realised something today, about our relationship, ever since we started... being together. I wonder if you think that, maybe, you have to change who you are to be with me. As if you had to please me all the time for me to want to stay with you... I don't know if I'm making sense right now, but.... Do you actually think something like that ?"
Both of them knew what these words were : a way to go back to normal, a peace offering.
"I'm afraid I can't tell the same about this jumper of yours, honestly, if I'm to be your boyfriend, I shoud be given a right of veto ..."
