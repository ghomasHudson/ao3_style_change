Derek stopped Dean from exiting. They stood eye to eye, staring each other down, sizing each other up.
Dean, Sam and Castiel got into the car first as Jack protected them. Jack went in last and they drove off immediately after the door closed, leaving the agents mystified.
“It’s alright, Jack. Sometimes we do things that hurt others, but it’s okay. We can learn from our mistakes and try not to make them again. Right?” Jack kept quiet, Emily could tell that he regrets what had happened.
“We’ll let them lead. They are confident enough to pose as FBI agents but they know it’s wrong. We don’t know how they are going to act as themselves. With a dependent in our custody, they already have a stressor. They know they have a disadvantage. Depending on how deep their delusions are, we could be the kidnappers in this situation. We’ll play by ear. Try to get them to separate. They were the FBI’s most wanted, and even if they were dead, they are still the most wanted. We’ll try to detain them here, if they get away now, who knows when they’ll show up again. Prentiss, Reid, I want you to be the ones talking to them. They are protectors, they will most likely protect females and submissive personalities.”
Dean’s thoughts about Castiel blended with memories of the story he had shared. He thought of the hurt and abandonment and self-hatred he had suffered. Dean wondered how a person could survive that. There was so much Dean wanted to ask, to understand. He wanted to make sense of why some aspects of what he heard had felt like someone chipping away at him. Why did he feel such visceral reactions on
Dean hung up and stretched out on the couch. He knew Sam meant well, but he could barely admit to himself how deep his feelings for Cas still ran. He didn’t like thinking about it - how a part of him cracked when they broke. And usually, he was pretty good at not thinking about it, by drowning himself in work or finding other distractions.
“I don’t wear it that often,” Castiel protested weakly. Meg raised her eyebrow, the small gesture calling him out more than any combination of words ever could.
“I don’t know anything about you except your name,” Castiel said as they were walking, “but to ensure we are on even ground, my name is Castiel Novak.”
“Where am I?” Dean had choked, throat on fire.  He had coughed a little as he struggled into a seated position, wiping his hand over his mouth as he coughed again. Bright red stained the back of his unusually pale hand.
These thoughts were more frequent as he contemplated the situation with his family. Dean didn’t always know what to say, in all honesty.  He almost never knew exactly what to say, but he was at least able to hold Cas, remind him how wanted he was. He was there to provide reassurance when Cas decided not to see his parents for the foreseeable future. He was there to listen when Cas started worrying about Max, could hold his hand and kiss his forehead when his concerns for the recently released man settled heavily onto his chest.
“You do?” Jack asked softly, and the uncertainty in his voice made Dean feel like a rib was cracking.

But Dean looked him in the eye then, and smiled softly with a look of genuine curiosity on his face. So naturally, logic decided not to stay around to assist Castiel. Castiel decided that he didn’t have to get into the details, he could just share the general idea with Dean.
The fact that Castiel was there, understanding him and feeling what he felt… Dean didn’t have the words to describe what that meant.
Castiel pointed his head in the direction of the cafeteria. Dean immediately started walking that way and Castiel fell into an easy step next to him.
Castiel frowned; it was highly unusual for the owner of this place to actually come by. She mostly left the day-to-day running of the facility to Charlie. Castiel had, in fact, only spoken to her once, the day he was moved here from the hospital. She had knocked on his hospital door while he had been packing up. He hadn’t seen her since.
Sam, therefore, stayed with him, always playing devil’s advocate when Dean suggested plans, always asking about Dean’s safety. And, without fail, Dean scoffed every time Sam shut down a plan when it seemed too risky. But Sam had held his ground and refused to let Dean attempt any halfcocked plans much to Dean’s palpable annoyance.
“I understand,” Eileen said kindly, “If it were me…” she trailed off, eyes darting to Sam, “I can’t imagine what you must be going through”.
Dean couldn’t remember the week leading up to him waking up in a blind panic with a tube down his throat and a number of needles in his veins. If he was being honest, he couldn’t remember much of those first couple of days, either. It was all a mess of pain and confusion and desperation. But, about two days ago, coherency had settled on him as the confusion lifted. The first thing he had seen was an unfamiliar and very beautiful slightly older woman, with dark hair and a black dress underneath a white lab coat, staring at a clipboard.
“Uhh… Sam had Model UN after school so I had to fetch him later than usual, and it was dark by the time he got in the car. But, I don’t remember getting home or anything,” Dean had mumbled. But, the more Dean had thought about it, the more he had found the memory strange. In his mind’s eye, he could see Sam getting into the Impala, the front seat fully taken up with his gangly limbs and his loud voice as he started talking before, he was even fully seated. And then, it goes dark. No fade to black, no haziness, just complete and utter darkness like someone had violently pulled a shutter down in his brain.
Dean couldn’t hold the tears back, so he didn’t try to. He listened as the heavy drops splashed onto the starched sheets.
“I’m sorry that you went through that, Dean,” Castiel said softly. His baritone voice washed over Dean.
It was past what was considered a reasonable time for dinner, but Dean hadn’t come out of his room. Perhaps Cas’ constant verbal poking and insistence that they talk annoyed him more than his desire for food. He would likely emerge later once he believed Cas had gone to bed. But Cas would be here. Right fucking here. He could outwait Dean; he had five years of insomniac nights as practice.
When Dean thought of his apartment, of the last time he was in there, his blood ran cold. There were ghosts in those walls, ones he couldn’t face without knowing Sam was okay. Seeing the place where he held his bleeding and unconscious brother before he was recovered terrified him so deeply, his bones ached.
He was often alone at this time of day, ensuring he woke up long before the other residents, relishing the quiet hours when he didn’t have to put on a mask or interact with others. He would stroll out of his room and sit on a garden bench, and watch the sun rise. The stillness of these moments had a purity to it that seemed to still the tremors in his heart and soothe the raw ache in his wrists. But, before he had time to truly appreciate it this time, he saw a figure waving far too frantically for this early in the morning from the communal kitchen window. It looked like he would not be alone today.
Cas hurried to his own room, not wanting Dean to come out and chastise him for only being in a towel again. But there was a reason he’d risked the nudity instead of just walking to the shower in his sleep clothes.
Dean nodded and relaxed his grip on his own hair, “Well you never know. I’m a super interesting topic of conversation.”
“I can’t begin to understand being raised in a religious situation like that, so I don’t want to undermine whatever you're dealing with,” Dean said, as he watched Cas climb under the covers of his bed, “But I have a very strong suspicion that whoever you end up being is gonna be awesome. But more than that, he’s gonna be
Thank you so much to all of you who have read, left kudos and particularly commented on this fic. It's so encouraging and means the world to me.
“Dean. I will never leave you again. This, us. I will fight for this and fight to be right next to you for as long as you need me. For as long as you want me. You are the righteous man. The man I Fell from Heaven for, the man I rebelled for, the man I have loved long before I was able to put a name to the sensation. And if you want me to stay then I will.” Cas’s eyes were almost glowing. He looked holy. He looked ethereal. And Dean was falling apart below those eyes, the eyes of the man that he had loved and had lost. The man who had crawled home to him and who he would have moved heaven and hell to hold in the way he was now.
Cas hadn’t taken anything out of his pockets when he arrived. He’d hung up the coat, and Dean had immediately started arguing with him.
“Yeah. Well, Jody and I are the only ones who haven’t. Everyone else has passed the halfway mark. Max is actually being released in a week from tomorrow.”
“I concur,” Cas said, watching Dean’s smile widen. Cas loved that he was able to do that, was able to say what he wanted; that he was able to make Dean smile this way. His heart was very full.
Amara looked at him calmly, “Because you saw him the week leading up to the car accident, obviously. Dean, you need to heal. You need to get better. And, I think I know of a place where. I’ve already cleared it with Mr. Singer.”
Unnaturally still, eyes closed and deathly pale. But some part of Cas was here with him. Dean walked over to the side of the bed and dropped to his knees, placing his palm on Cas’ limp hand. Dean traced the shape of his fingers with his own, tried not to think about how fucking
When Dean heard Castiel’s breaths evening out into sleep, he finally let the dam of emotions break. He cried silently for most of the night, thinking of the morning when he’d have to leave Castiel again. The motel room remained silent, broken only by Dean’s occasional whispers, a mantra to keep him grounded:
After he had stormed into his room, he had dropped down onto his bed without bothering to change into something more comfortable. Every bone felt heavy, like his very skeleton had been coated over with cement. After the day he had experienced, Dean had assumed that he would fall asleep immediately; he was drained so absolutely that even breathing seemed like an excessive effort. Sleep, however, evaded him.
As his eyes scoped across the room, he suddenly found himself making eye contact with a stranger through the glass walls of the
The water kept spitting onto the mattress so Cas tried to move the bed out of the firing range as best as he could. He watched the small torrents of water for a few more minutes, but shortly after Dean hung up with Billie, he switched the water off. The water didn’t stop but decreased in velocity significantly.
Dean banged his head on the shower wall a few times hoping it would shake loose the very unhelpful image his brain had conjured up. It seemed glued to the inside of his eyelids.
“No Cas, don’t try make this better okay? I let Jack down. I did. And it’s not like what I said is true. I told Sam that Jack wasn’t family. But of course he is, of course. I was just so blinded with rage and it…” Dean felt his throat tighten.
“Would it help if I started?” Cas asked, voice low. Dean opened his eyes and looked at Cas again, the itchy feeling intesifying.
“Of all the things I thought you would ask, that was not it,” Dean laughed. Cas grinned and pointed to Dean’s bed.
When he reached the door, he knocked, and when he didn’t hear anything, he tried to open it. It was locked. But just as he lifted his hand off of the door handle, he heard a dull sound, something that sounded a lot like the word “coming.”
“I can’t believe that worked,” Dean said as he dropped onto his bed. Cas smiled at him as he removed his trench coat and draped it over the couch that was still taking up an inordinate amount of space in Dean’s room. They would probably have to move it out soon, back to wherever Dean had dragged it from, if for no other reason than practicality.
“I have removed the physical influence,” Jack said, looking Dean directly in the eye. “But the grip is now psychological. Cas has been in this state for so long, he does not
Cas turned toward him. He interlocked his fingers and placed them on Dean’s chest and then rested his head on the pillow they created.
Dean backed up into the room, as if Cas were stalking towards him with his fists raised and murder in his eyes. In actuality, Cas was frozen solid behind the threshold. Dean kept backing up until the back of his knees hit the couch in the living area. Cas heard a whispered, “fuck” as Dean slowly lowered himself onto the cushions. Dean palmed the lower half of his face, his eyes never leaving Cas’. Cas felt his heart crack.
Dean felt like he had somehow stumbled his way into something that was both very real and very honest, something that was quickly becoming the central point in his life. This thing that was growing between him and Cas made him feel
Castiel nodded absently, swapping his finger for his thumb and tracing the tattoo one last time before withdrawing and dropping his hand in his lap.
“You do realize that, as the child, it is not your responsibility to “manage” or “deal with” a parent, right?”
“In here,” Cas responded and seconds later Dean was standing in front of him. He looked chaotic bordering on manic: his eyes were bloodshot, his hair wild, his flannel creased and there were dark stains on his jeans. He looked frenzied and disheveled.
“I used to come here a lot,” Dean said, as he slung his arm around Cas. Cas sighed happily and leaned into Dean’s side, resting his head on his shoulder. Dean doubted he would ever lose the thrill he felt every time he was reminded of how perfectly they seemed to fit together.
Dean stood up and shoved his hands into his pockets, rolling his eyes and gritting his teeth as the pain laddered up his sides. He tried to keep the smile in place as he followed her into the room. Missouri sat down on one couch, and indicated that Dean should do the same on the other couch in the room, which was only a slightly less aggressive shade of yellow than the one outside.
“This has happened a couple of times with patients, particularly in the first two to three weeks. There are protocols in place. Don’t fret, Castiel,” her smile comforted him. .
But for Sam, he’d deal. Fuck, he’d go to hell for the kid; what’s ten days in a strange, boring and slightly bare apartment with a stranger? Plus, he got here first, so he managed to grab the room with the queen-sized bed; the only luck that had graced him since getting on his flight at
Strategizing was a very fraught process that lasted much longer than anyone had expected. Sam’s anxiousness was exacerbated by his brother’s deteriorating physical and mental state. Dean was almost impossible to be around, but Sam would not leave him alone either. Dean was distant, moody and snapping at everyone. He never left Cas’ side, even sleeping on a dilapidated couch he had dragged into his room that first night. Sam, however, doubted that the sleep he was receiving was in anyway restful. He had spent his entire life with his brother and was very familiar with the drawn look that etched itself into Dean’s face when his dreams were twisted into nightmares.  After the circles under his eyes darkened alarmingly, Sam basically refused to leave Dean’s side. He knew he was annoying his brother, Dean’s very pointed and obvious eye rolls sent a clear message, but Sam knew that Dean tended to get reckless when he was in this state. And seeing as Dean was insisting on being the one who would have to venture into the Empty, Sam needed to ensure Dean was in the right mental space for this. He would not lose his brother due to Dean’s tendencies to disregard his own life if it meant saving someone else’s. Not after everything they have been through.
Dean couldn’t help but smile. “Neither do I, hence, happy to spend the money, bitch. Plus, I don’t have a wife to keep happy.”
“I – I don’t know,” Dean felt extremely anxious at the thought of not seeing Sam for another three weeks.
Cas and Sam also had a very good relationship. They both liked the same books and had this monthly tradition of buying a book for the other to read and then discussing it over coffee and biscuits. The biscuits were often home-made as Cas had insisted Dean continue teaching him how to bake and cook once they were both settled into the real world again.
Missouri shook her head in an affectionate way, “It doesn’t Dean. And you need to deal with what happened before you will be able to deal with what’s to come.”
“I’m going after Cas. Drag his ass back to where he belongs” Dean said simply, and the fact that he had something to do was already lifting some of the heaviness inside him.
“Yeah,” Dean sighed, “Look, I know I’ve been a dick. I guess it’s my turn to extend an olive branch.”
“What were you dreaming about?” Cas asked, lazily drawing pictures with his thumb on Dean’s neck. But Dean could see the worry there: the slight furrow of Cas’ brows, the searching look in his eyes.
End notes will likely be a little long for this one, but there are no content warning for this chapter! *Gasps*
Dean flinched, despite himself and then quickly schooled his features into what he hoped resembled nonchalance, “That was in the past. I’m all good now, really. I mean, look at me, I’m the picture of health.”
Dean laughed brokenly, “What? We fucked once and shared some heart to hearts, and now suddenly, you think you know what’s best for me? That you can fix this? That there is anything you can do? I don’t need you. I need to find Amara.”
Dean pulled at his hair and closed his eyes, trying to think through this clearly, trying not to address this reactively.
After group, there was a little down time in the day room before lunch. Here, Dean really got to exploit his enjoyment of riling Cas up. He teased and hinted, joked and misled but ensured that he never gave Cas any concrete answers about their activity. Cas’ eyes squinted when he got frustrated. It was so endearing that Dean thought he would explode.
The weird tense and charged energy that now encircled them when Cas stared at Dean and Dean ignored him, made it feel like a small current of electricity was running over his skin. He was so keyed up by the atmosphere and by Cas’ presence in the other room that he seemed completely incapable of staying fucking still.
“I’m still very new to this and every intervention I do can have some unforeseen consequences. And I’m scared if I force him to wake up that something may go wrong. Like what if the shock sends him back to his ‘factory settings’ or what if he gets a fright and his true form bursts out and blinds you or…” Jack started, fidgeting with his thumbs.
Dean was quiet for a while as he filtered through as many memories of Cas that he could grip onto and tried to see them through the filter of what he had just learned. Something inside him was shifting and he suddenly felt off kilter.
Meg looked at him, blinked and then threw herself into his arms. She sobbed against his chest. Castiel soothed his hand down her hair and held her for a long while. He could do this. He could be the one providing the comfort this time; he could be the pillar. Meg had done it for so long.
“Is that a metaphor?” Castiel asked, eyeing Dean wearily. Dean made a non-committal sound while he turned his body slightly so that he could face him more directly.
“And that doesn’t mean it will always be easy because life is just shit like that. But it’s going to be easier, and you know better now,” Dean dropped his arm so that he could take both of Castiel’s hands into both of his own.
Thank you, as always, to the absolutely wonderful Hellbreaker42 for beta-ing this work. I appreciate you so much :)<3
Cas smiled at Sam and turned to look at Eileen, who was rubbing Jack’s shoulder as he huddled against her. Castiel did not know her well, but he smiled warmly at her and she returned it.
Dean was immediately thrown back to the conversation they had had right before he had almost sealed himself away in a malik box. He could see the desperation in memory Sam’s face reflected in the actual Sam’s face. He could see his brother fighting back tears.
“Cas, I need you.” Dean started, and suddenly the barrier that had been silencing him for so long crumbled as he looked at the angel who had died for him. And, all of a sudden, Dean found that he could not stop talking.
. I'm always looking for more Heller friends. Currently, my real life friends and family are taking the brunt of my Supernatural obsession even though they don't watch the show.
Cas opened the book and his eyes travelled down the quote inscribed on the back of the front cover. Dean knew what he was reading.
“You were,” Dean whispered, “We got you out. But you seem to be trapped in your head, in the loops the Empty set out.”
He doesn’t often let himself think about Cas, about that time in his life. Even if it was the happiest he has ever been. And maybe it makes him pathetic, but the wounds of Cas’ sudden departure still ache as deeply five years later as they did that godforsaken night. He knows a part of him never let Cas go, held on to the thorn of his absence, ignoring the way holding on ensured he kept bleeding.
Please note, though, that there may be a one week delay in the next chapter. I am so, so sorry about this, but my life has gotten quite unexpectedly busy at the moment as I'm in the process of moving and have been assigned two new big projects at work. I will try to have it done by Sunday! But just in case, I wanted to communicate this with you
“There is a lot we need to address there. Firstly, Dean, we are fine. You and I are completely okay. Secondly, Sam is alive. You have spent your whole life protecting him. You kept him fed and educated and safe. You didn’t let him down. John did. John failed him. Okay?”
Dean lowered his hand and started scratching down Cas’ back. Cas let out a low growling sound and Dean felt the angel harden against his hip.
“The demon Sam had been involved with,” Jack offers for clarification, as if anyone there was not very aware of the situation. Sam was honest to god blushing and pulling at the collar of his shirt.
Dean started crying again. But this time, it was just a few tears spilling from his eyes. Castiel wasn’t even sure Dean had realized he was. Castiel lifted his hands to brush the tears away with the pads of his thumbs.
Dean’s entire body went rigid, a very painful hot anger bleeding through his muscles, pulsing menacingly behind his eyes. Everything went red-tinged as his lungs abruptly stopped working.
Bobby climbed into the driver’s seat and Cas slid into the backseat. Dean hesitated for a second and then followed Cas.
They haven’t spoken about their impending separation. The idea of having the conversation made it feel like ants were running rampant over his skin. He couldn’t even think about what it would be like to have to say goodbye, even if it would only be temporary. Going from twenty-four seven contact to two thirty-minute calls and one hour and a half visitation session was going to
“Among other things,” Dean admitted. ”But, before I followed the John Winchester inspired coping mechanism of boobs, booze and blackouts, I had to deal with my fears of this. Of the possibility that you would hate me. Of the possibility that I would lose you. I could’ve followed my fears all the way down.”
Dean turned to him, the pounding in his ears deafening, " Will you be okay? I don't want to leave you but I need to..."
“He was in a very bad place. Amara, apparently, heard of him from an ex-colleague working in a hospital in Colorado. She went to see him.”
And suddenly, Cas was hurled back six years, to him and Dean in his uncle Bobby’s hunting cabin. They’d decided to do a romantic weekend one summer. They’d barely been there three hours before the water heater in the pantry burst, flooding the kitchen.
“Is that good or bad?” Dean asked, trying to swallow past the lump growing in his throat as the image of Sam tied up to all those machines flashed behind his lids.
“Good Morning, Dean,” Amara greeted him, as Marve brought the chair to a stop by the hospital front doors, “Ready to go?”
“I was thinking when to ask you, and as I watched Sam get ready for today, get so excited about his future, it just clicked for me. You are my future, Cas. You are the best thing that has entered willingly into my life. You are the best choice I ever made. I am so ridiculously head over heels in love with you.”
“Cassie!” Gabriel’s voice boomed as he grabbed Castiel around the shoulders the second he was in reaching distance. Castiel hugged his brother back, smiling a little dumbly into his shoulder. And when they pulled apart, Castiel immediately seized Meg and hugged her tightly. He felt her tense for a split second before embracing him back.
“Dean,” an urgent voice murmured in his ear. “Dean, wake up,” the voice seemed more urgent, and this time it was accompanied by a shaking that jolted Dean awake. His eyes flew open as he jerked up, the sheets of his bed pooling around his waist. His heart thumped wildly and painfully in his chest.
But even when speaking in actions, he tried to avoid Cas hearing what his mind was screaming the loudest:
This option, however, also meant there was no room service and very limited TV channels. So yeah, it did kinda suck.
“Maybe I don’t quite know what to say,” Dean admitted, “But, I didn’t leave. I showed up here, in your doorway.”
To a group home, or some shit. I don’t have the fucking luxury to sit and talk about my feelings and do weird stretchy poses. I need to go home. I need to go home right now!”
He could not make out the words, could not make out who he was shouting at. All he could hear was the cadence, the blend of blind panic and outrage.
“I don’t know. I mean, I feel like I know a lot about you, ‘cause of the life story thing, but you don’t know all that much about me. And I know if it were me, I’d be a little, I don’t know … wary? About the unbalanced-ness of it all,” Dean was aware that he was not speaking cohesively, but it seemed like he was unable to stop the torrent of words falling out of his mouth.
“Jack, would you go grab the root? I’m a little tired from all that running around in the Empty and I’d like to just rest up a bit before I go walking around in Cas’ grapefruit.” Sam shot him a disbelieving look that quickly melted into an infuriatingly knowing look. Dean glowered but didn’t rise to the bait Sam’s expression was dangling. “
“Dean,” Castiel breathed as Dean grabbed onto the doorframe, as if standing up was difficult, as if he didn’t have the energy to remain upright on his own.
Long after Dean had assumed Cas had fallen asleep, Cas whispered into the comforting blackness, “Thank you, Dean.”
“I’ve heard that laughing is not usually considered a good thing after intercourse,” Cas said, looking unsure. Dean pulled himself up so that he was at eye level with the angel.
“After a couple of those episodes, I started talking to Mr. Singer about your history with John. I filled him in as much as I could about what happened to Sam. And, combined with your x-rays showing numerous healed fractures and your extensive medical records, I was able to slowly piece together some of your history. Your trauma. I had to ask Bobby if he thought you were suicidal –“
“No,” Cas held his gaze. “We went on one unsuccessful date three years ago. We decided to be friends and that’s it.”
When the woman answered, he asked if there was any chance the apartment buildings weren’t fully booked because, perhaps, he could isolate alone. Billie told him that, unfortunately, no, that would not be an option. The entire block of apartments was fully booked. As he was about to hang up, Billie told him the other resident, his temporary roommate, had already checked in and Cas just had to knock on the door when he arrived. Cas thanked her before hanging up.
Dean switched on the radio, and the familiar sounds of Led Zeppelin filled the car. He hummed along to the melody while avoiding eye contact with Cas. He could feel his blue eyes boring into the side of his face.
But there was no way Dean could have said that. That level of vulnerability was not something his mutilated soul could survive. So, he kept quiet. Rather a lie of omission than an outright corruption of the truth.
“Castiel Novak, will you marry me?” Dean repeated the words that Cas had just read. He held the silver band in his palm, which was outstretched towards Cas. “Please say we can do this, you and me, for the rest of our lives. Please marry me.”
Dean was not sure how long they stayed like that, a frantic constellation of clinging limbs, but he did eventually hear his brother clear his throat.
Everyone was quiet for a while. Dean no longer felt angry, but he definitely needed more time to process what was happening. Cas dropped his arm again and just rested his hand on the small of Dean’s back.
“If you decide to finish these last three weeks, I promise the following: if Sam wakes up, you can go see him, no questions asked, no objections from my side; any developments, good or bad, I will let you know immediately through Charlie or Stevie. I will also, of course, reinstate all phone and visitation privileges. In fact, I will even let you call Bobby right now, and you can talk for as long as you want with no time limit.”
of it. How wonderful it felt to have Dean like this, to taste him and press up against him. The kiss was like a breath of air after being submerged in water, the electric buzzing in his veins after his first sip of coffee. It was beautiful and overwhelming and oh, so intoxicating.
She spoke about her first love, Sean, and how, despite the odds, they managed a long-distance relationship through college and how they got married when they both returned to South Dakota after graduating. She joined the police force, and he got a job at a bank. And soon after, they had a little boy, Owen.
“No,” Cas reassured him gently, “nothing like that. I am completely fine and I’m home now. We just want the same for you,”
It took all his self-control not to collapse at the obvious disdain in Dean’s eyes, the malice in his tone. He settled for leaning against the wall.
A part of Sam knew that if he still believed in prayer like he had in his twenties, he would be thanking every celestial being out there that his brother was here with him, that they had both survived this. That they did not become the
Cas was at both of those visits, and although he didn’t get to say much, he sat next to Dean and held his hands or drew nonsensical patterns on the skin of Dean’s forearms.
He knew he was pathetic for still being this ridiculously and painfully hung up on a man whose presence in his life had all but evaporated over five years ago. But the fact of the matter was, Dean Winchester was the love of his goddamn life. And he knew there wasn’t ever going to be someone else that fit with him the way Dean did, who Cas loved that deeply.
“Yeah, we can, that’s what I was checking,” Dean said, showing Cas the internet tab on his phone, “it looks like same-sex marriage was legalized in 2015 in the State of Kansas.”
A very special thank you to Hellbreaker42 and aubrielle for the beta reading, advanced reading and general encouragement. I'm so grateful to know you both :)!
“You ready to go home?” Jody asked as she watched Dean closely while he stood up and slid his jacket on.
“New rule: you are to be fully clothed at all times while in the common areas,” Dean spat as he hurried to the kitchenette. He kept his back to Cas as he started pulling ingredients for breakfast from the fridge.
Meg had promised to take him shopping for his own things for his room as soon as he was allowed out. Castiel looked forward to the whole process of turning a place he lived into a home. When Dean was, more or less, back to being himself, Castiel informed him of this. Dean was almost
“It is obvious you care about Dean” Charlie started, and Cas tensed, but he heard no judgement, “and, although you're doing great, it is still upsetting to see someone we care about struggling. It is just to make sure you can share your concerns with her. If you would like to, of course.”
He noted that most of these stories were of events that happened after Dean had strolled into his life, knocking him sideways and out of the numb bubble he never even realized he wanted to escape. Castiel has done his own work, and taken the difficult steps, dealt with his trauma, but Dean had catalyzed his healing process.
look that had crossed over his features when Dean introduced him to the multitude of kitchen equipment, was a mental image Dean was going to hold close for a long fucking time. As the session progressed, however, Cas got more comfortable, confidently rolling up his sleeves, and Dean had tried very hard, and had failed very hard, not to stare at the newly exposed skin, and the deft ways in which his hands - and those
“I was so angry, Cas, I just wanted him to suffer. I wanted him to feel the pain I was feeling. The pain he had caused. So I…”
“We might finally have it,” Eileen calls from somewhere behind Sam. Sam and Dean both turn to look at her. Eileen smiled softly as she walked into the room and sat down next to Cas’ vessel on Dean’s bed.
Meg dropped onto the seat of the couch Castiel had just vacated, lying down with her legs in Gabriel’s lap.
He tried, and failed, to ignore the throbbing and heavy feeling between his legs as he turned on the water with a more aggressive tug on the tap than the situation warranted. As the steam started filling the room, spilling through the open shower door, Dean realized that there was only one way this problem was going away. He groaned in frustration as he rubbed the heel of his palm over his boxer-clad dick. He jerked his hand away when he heard the sound echoing loudly in the tiled room.
He pulled her towards him again and crushed her closer to him. He started sobbing silently into her hair. She held him tightly for a few seconds before pulling away.
Cas lifted his eyebrow, and Dean cringed inwardly. At least the tension had lifted a little. The place of contact between them, however, was still burning like liquid lightning.
“I will be available at any time, Dean. These next three weeks will be uncomfortable, but I really do believe it’s the best thing in the long run.”
Something had happened to Sam. Something had happened to Dean’s brother, the person he had sacrificed everything for. He was the person he loved the most in the world. Something so bad had happened that Dean’s brain had literally shut it out, had tried to carve the memories from his mind.
So instead, he decided to focus on Dean, who was curled up next to him on an overstuffed sofa, as they all watched
Castiel, hand halfway extended to Meg’s, froze. The mention of his parents made his blood run cold and his skin feel like it was being electrocuted.
“Elephants? What the fuck are you talking about Sam?” Dean snapped, “And when did you learn about psychology?” The second question directed at Jack, who just shrugged in a non-committal way and muttered something that sounded a lot like “I am literally God.”
“Hey Cas,” Dean said weakly, grabbing Cas by his shoulders, “Buddy this is a dream okay? You need to wake up. Please, I need….  I need you to wake up.”
Castiel nodded into Dean’s shoulder, and then, somehow, they were both lying down. Dean moved and manipulated them a bit so that they were laying the right way on the bed, both of their heads resting on the pillow, without once letting go of Castiel. Dean moved his arm so that he was fully cradling Castiel against him.
Cas darted his eyes back to Dean’s before he nodded. “I haven’t really laughed much for what feels like forever. But you make me laugh.”
Dean said nothing, just continued unsteadily rocking. Castiel dropped in front of him, gently trying to pry his hands away from where they were burrowing into his face. Dean resisted, shaking his head, tears were streaming down his face, glistening in the low light of the single lightbulb that was illuminating the deserted passageway. Castiel eventually gave up and just held onto Dean’s shoulders.
He was dying to know what had made the date three years ago unsuccessful. But he was also dying to not have a discussion about the previous night.
“Dean, look at me.” The hunter hadn’t realized he had closed his eyes, so he opened them, and Cas was looking at him with a ferocity that was overwhelming in both its novelty and its intensity.
He looked uncomfortable for a second before waving at someone behind Meg. Dean turned his head slightly and he watched as a young, dark-haired girl walked towards them. By the time she reached the group, Sam’s soft smile was taking up half of his face.
Since Dean had heard about this, he knew immediately what he wanted to do. He had checked with Charlie, and she loved the idea, even gave him permission to work on it on weekends and she had okayed Cas joining him. He was ecstatically excited but also trying exceptionally hard not to show it.
And as Dean thumbed the corners of the folder, he felt something small flicker inside him, something that did not feel like the uneasiness and emptiness he had felt since Chuck. But instead, the feeling felt warm and light. The feeling felt a lot like hope.
They spoke for ages about a lot of superficial topics. It was nice and the tension eased slightly, it wasn’t as suffocating.
He hadn’t managed to sleep much the previous night. This, however, was not an uncommon occurrence. He’d developed quite severe insomnia in the years after college. After Dean. At first, it was the guilt that had gnawed at him, biting into him so savagely that the pain of it made sleeping impossible. Then, it was regret which pulsed like blood behind a bruise and all of the agonizing accompanying thoughts about the colossal mistake he made. How it was rushed. How it was unfair. How he should have just talked to Dean.
“I am very happy to hear that. Although, twenty-four seems quite young to be getting married, if he’s happy, then it must be the right choice for him.”
Dean dipped his hands under the hem of Castiel’s shirt, his palms resting on his lower back. He looked at Castiel, eyes wide and swallowed once before he nodded. Castiel slid his hand away, running his index finger along Dean’s top lip before he moved his hand to the back of his neck.
Castiel couldn’t really make sense of what Dean was saying, couldn’t follow his train of thought. But he understood that what Dean had blocked out had to do with Sam. His baby brother, the kid he had raised and loved more than life itself.
“Cas?” Dean asked softly, anxious about breaking the stillness, but it did not look like Cas was going to say anything on his own, and Dean
Dean pulled himself forward and planted a kiss on Castiel’s cheek, “So are we going to brush our teeth and go for round two?”
“Okay,” Castiel conceded, “you are correct. Something did happen, but it’s nothing of great import.”
“I just think there’s more to the story, Dean. I always have. I mean, obviously at the time I wasn’t thinking about anyone or anything else, and I – I was in a bad place, and I didn’t think twice. I should have, I know that. I am really sorry –“
“Right, okay. Straight to the hard stuff then,” Dean mumbled. Cas half shrugged, lifting one shoulder weakly.
“Dean, look at me,” Castiel urged, and Dean slowly turned his face towards Castiel’s. “You have ruined nothing. Do you hear me? And I am not going anywhere. I’m right here.”
“If you don’t need calming down when working on a Saturday, I think it makes more sense for you to be a patient here, rather than a nurse,” Dean admitted. He had worked almost every Saturday for years now, and it never failed to be a horrific experience.
“You know, if I still had my Grace, I would be able to just touch you to ensure your immediate sobriety and hopefully, a logical explanation for whatever you are trying to communicate with me,” Castiel said, and Dean thought he could detect very real and very clear annoyance in his tone.
“But, they’re such great people! And, they are porn stars, not hookers.” Castiel heard a warm voice from somewhere behind him and he spun on his heel. Standing within arm’s reach was his older brother, his familiar face holding a look completely unfamiliar to Castiel.
“Did you listen when they did the safety procedure? In case of an emergency, you have to put your own mask on before helping those around you.”
“You may have noticed that anger is Dean’s default response to traumatic events. It’s a coping mechanism. It’s not how he really feels,” Sam said not making eye contact with Cas.
“This is an actual plan, this is something that could work,” Sam said, eyes glowing. Cas darted his eyes to Dean who seemed to be thinking something over.
“Cas,” he said seriously, “that was unbelievable. The only reason I am laughing is because I am genuinely happy for the first time in so long.”
Dean looked at Castiel with wide eyes before he slowly leaned forward and pressed his lips to Castiel’s. It wasn’t like the previous night; there was no desperation, no running from, just running towards. The kiss was passive and gentle.
Cas gestured to Dean’s neck and chest. When Dean looked down, he could see that his skin was littered with small blue and red marks.
“No the fuck I’m not.” Dean’s voice was soft but urgent, “And, dude, I just want to make sure you’re
agreeing to this? Dean’s vision darkened. He was vaguely aware that both Jody and Castiel were now staring at him, and he thought he heard someone's voice, but it was too muffled to decipher who it was or what they said because all he could hear was the pounding in his head.
And as the minutes bled into hours, Castiel’s anxiety had ricocheted in his chest, making it impossible for him to stay seated. At around midnight, he had given up trying to remain calm and just bolted for the nurse’s station. Stevie was there, and she seemed calm and collected as she typed something into her computer. Castiel felt slightly better and breathed slightly easier when he saw her serenely going about her work. It was likely just professionalism, but still. He needed calm then.
So that is how after eight days of intense planning Sam and Dean found themselves having the same argument every few hours.
“Dean, you are like a hurricane; you are loud, attention-grabbing, and you leave chaos in your wake,” Cas gestured at Dean’s side of the room that was littered with books, clothes (both dirty and clean) and the drafts of the letters he was writing to Sam spilled all over the floor.
Just a fair warning, this chapter is quite heavy, but all will get resolved. This story has a happy ending. They just have some work on themselves to do first. Please see end notes for trigger warnings.
The thoughts tried to infiltrate the burning river currently encompassing Dean’s mind. But Dean didn’t care. He just didn’t.
“And don’t, please don’t say you never said that,” Dean’s voice, usually overflowing with emotions, just rang hollow.
“Okay, lets do this,” Dean said, his voice shaking. Jack walked towards him and smiled as he closed his one hand around Dean’s arm and the other around Cas’s vessel. Dean felt Cas’ energy leaving him and then a second later, Cas’s entire body seemed to light up from within. There was a beat and Cas suddenly inhaled sharply. It was the single most beautiful sound Dean had ever heard. Painful relief flooded through his veins.
. Dean’s tongue teased at the seam of Cas’ lips and when the angel parted his lips in invitation, Dean was suddenly home.
“Sorry,” Cas mumbled, moving slightly out of reach to put the mug on the coffee table. He returned to Dean.
“Oh, fuck no,” Dean grinned devilishly, his hand running lower until he gripped Castiel’s hip possesively.
They stared at each other for a while, and Castiel felt so much joy in just sitting there with this confident and beautiful man. There was something in the way Dean was looking at him that seemed so
“Cas, buddy, you really got a talent in the kitchen, man,” Dean grinned as he opened the door. Cas was smiling shyly as he entered after Dean. And Dean meant it. Sure, Cas was completely useless with the spatula at the start, but that was because he had never learned and his fervor and desire to do things right made him a quick study.
He only read a couple of pages of the novel he had mostly memorized when Sam’s video call request came through.
“Will he be?” Dean asked Castiel as he walked over and sat on his own bed. He couldn’t remember the last time he had seen someone look so haunted.
But what made it worse was that Cas was just so fucking calm and cool about it. He was just so goddamn
“What I said earlier, it was cruel…” Dean breathed out, his eyes closed, regret spilling over his face.
It was probably a testament to the fact that Chuck was no longer writing their lives, as for once the plan went off without a hitch. After entering the Empty, the amulet around Dean’s neck had lifted in the air and immediately started pulling Dean in a direction. And Dean had focused on that. He had never been claustrophobic, but the complete darkness felt like a weight on him. He was grateful for the occasional flash of light behind him, a reminder that his brother was there with him and would be his guide back. Dean followed the angelic compass. He ran for what had seemed like an hour (although he couldn’t tell exactly) when the amulet suddenly plunged down and froze, a couple of inches away from Dean’s body.
Dean grinned, “I already think you’re awesome. I just think now you’ll be awesome and happy. You deserve to live a life you chose. A happy life.”
“It’s not a deflection,” Castiel insisted, “at least not solely. The medication is really working, and I happen to have a very attractive roommate,” Castiel wondered if his face could melt, “So, as I said, good week.”
Castiel nodded and Dean reached over to switch off the light. The two moved, slotting together like puzzle pieces, Castiel’s chest warm against Dean’s back, his arm thrown possessively around Dean’s midsection. Cas held him so close, no air could flow between them.
Cas was always in favor of the latter, but if there was one thing he could not afford to relive, it was any of the memories about his early mornings with Dean. Dean’s legs around his waist, his ankles locked at the small of Cas’ back…
“We’re doing everything we can,” the nurse recites that empty, hollow promise that they give to so many wrecked people.
“I don’t pay you to nap, handsome,” Crowley says, even though there’s amusement dancing in his eyes. He loves to catch Castiel sleeping, even though he never really punishes him for it, simply because he knows he can hold it over the younger man’s head later. “You’ve got a call on line two. She sounds gorgeous- don’t let her slip away, hm?”
Cursing to himself, he plasters on a smile to take care of his tables, resolutely ignoring Michae’s presence for the rest of his stay. After about an hour Michael’s soup is gone and his americano is clinging to the sides of the glass, and he makes little fuss as he gathers his briefcase and hat, before exiting the restaurant.
“Oh.” Castiel returns his gaze to the pages. What is English? Is it a language he can comprehend? Is the Roman alphabet something he can actually decipher? He taps his fingertip idly against the page number, 64. “I wouldn’t want to impose.”
and Dean’s lawyer know,” Castiel puts his elbows on the arms of the chair so he can start massaging his temples. “I’ve been meeting him every Friday for the last month and a half.”
Grumbling, Dean squats to start stuffing things back into the pockets of his apron before he stands and ties it around his waist once more. They both move behind the bar, Charlie prodding him in the side as he taps the order into the iPad. “Whaddya want?”
Michael's eyes are wide with surprise and disbelief. Then, of all the things he could say, he asks, "Did you press charges against your father?"
Castiel considers just killing him. Just getting rid of him. Having a roommate to solidify alibis is only important if the cops come sniffing around, but they haven’t, and they won’t, so what’s the point of Dean?
He spends his time dodging. Michael’s power is strong but his flight is clumsy. They’re both out of practice, but with less wings Castiel is a hair more agile. While that may be the case, if and when Michael lands a hit, it’ll rattle his jawbones.
“Stop talking,” Castiel groans. His feet feel heavy as lead and he can’t feel anything between his waist and shoulder. Between one blink and the next they’re walking and then he’s being let down gently onto something soft and cushiony (a couch?), finally able to relax. Dean’s voice swims in and out of his head, but he’s in too much pain to understand anything specific.
“He had a bowl,” Castiel pulls a hand away from his head to gesture with it, “with… some sort of herbs and a matchbook. He was only in my apartment for five minutes. Then… I woke up? And he was gone.”
Castiel walks over to peer over her shoulder, feeling his gut drop as he watches the surveillance feed Charlie hacked into. There’s the man, and there’s Castiel, and they really
Castiel outright scowls. Michael winks, then makes his way to the car, where he opens the door for Dean. Watching them drive out of sight, Castiel finally lets out an uncontrollable, frustrated noise. What is Dean getting into? Dating an older man? A previous, violent client? A man who practically bared his teeth to Castiel?
“This is he,” Castiel confirms, pulling his phone away from his ear to check the caller I.D. Private number?
Sam and Dean go silent. Castiel looks between them, suddenly aware of the fact that neither of the brothers has considered that option. The brothers are staring at each other, wide-eyed and slack-jawed. Unsure as to how to comfort them, Castiel shifts idly in his chair.
It could be a coincidence that God has been brought up twice in one day by people Castiel would normally pass off as psychos. Something tells him that he should stop believing in coincidences.
That shocks a laugh out of Dean. He pulls back, using the towel again to wipe his eyes and hide his smile. "I just- I dunno… I feel like we aren't on the same level sometimes. Still feel like a dumb kid."
He never gets wet again, thanks to the man keeping close. The umbrella is large enough to ensure they don't bump awkwardly. The man's bar is eight blocks down and one block north of the strip club, which on this side of the city is pretty sweet. Dean's not up here too much since he's stuck taking the bus everywhere and isn't interested in an hour long commute, but an area like this is actually pretty convenient.
Now her expression turns puzzled. “Don’t you two have, like, insane communication skills? Why can’t you ask him?”
Dean hums conversationally, shrugging as he starts shoveling once more. “Sounds to me like you’ll need to keep having alibis at the ready.”
Making sure that the flush is gone and the sheen of sweat on his collarbone has dried, he hops up the steps directly into a cloud of the scent of mom’s pot roast. In the kitchen mom, dad, and Sam are already seated at the table. Shuffling in, Dean takes his seat next to Sam, kicking his foot under the table just to annoy him. Sam huffs and glares, while Mary stands to start serving their portions.
It was a picture of Dean with his arm thrown around his brother, both of them smiling widely at the camera.
Cas stepped back, and Dean followed him. They both sat down at the table. The air was still slightly uncomfortable, but there was something different too. The mutual desire for the uncomfortability to dissipate.
“Not like that, but just be careful how you phrase things and any allusions you make to mental health outside of sessions. A lot of the patients here are vulnerable and face emotional triggers when it comes to blasé references to any mental health concerns.”
He settled onto the couch. Time passed, dragging slowly, but he didn’t even turn on the TV. Cas just kept glaring at Dean’s door. His eyes narrowed as he watched a shadow pass over the dull light streaming under the door. Dean opened it slightly, and if Cas’ sole focus hadn’t been on that godforsaken door, he might have missed the green eye peeking through the sliver between it and the wall.
Dean nodded, licked his lips and made a decision. Very slowly and deliberately he moved his hands up, never breaking contact with Cas, until he was holding the angel’s face in both his hands, reveling in the feel of the stubble under his fingers.
Dean watched him curiously at first but eventually joined in the cleaning. Cas tried not to think too much about the fact that they were actually doing something together without arguing. Cas really tried not to think about how happy this made him.
Castiel swallowed heavily. He hadn’t discussed it with anyone yet. He wasn’t sure he wanted to talk about it until he absolutely had to. Moreover, he didn’t even know Dean all that well.
Dean let out a frustrated sigh as he placed the empty plate on his side table. He ate all three of his meals on the bed today like he often did back in college as his dorm obviously didn’t have a dining area.
Trigger and content warnings: Mentions of offscreen death (Jessica), using alcohol as a coping mechanism (not alcoholism, though), mentions of a car accident with one fatality (John).
Dean would not call what Sam and Eileen had a plan exactly. It was mostly a collection of notes, questions and lore. As he rifled through the folder, he could admit that it at least looked like the beginning of
“I know how you see yourself Dean,” Cas started, and Dean snapped himself back. He couldn’t listen to this again. He barely survived it the first time. He cleared his throat loudly and hurried to Cas, very pointedly ignoring Cas’ dream version of him. The silence emanating from him was deafening. Dean was definitely not ready for the effect of seeing Cas’ eyes would have on him. The relief felt like a wave, drowning out everything else except the sharp, crystal blue of the angel’s painfully familiar eyes looking at him. It took longer than Dean will ever admit for him to register the confusion on Cas’ face as he looked between Dean and the dream version of Dean.
so that she could keep an eye on him. Dean had tried to resist, seeing as it was already dawn and he hadn’t felt as out of control as he had earlier in the evening. And, if he was being honest (although admitting this was by no means easy), he really didn’t want to be away from Cas.
Dean laughed and dipped his head to catch Castiel’s lips with his own. When Dean’s hands came up to rest lightly on either side of Castiel’s neck, Castiel groaned from somewhere low in the back of his throat.
“Would you be open to doing something else today? With me?” Dean tried for nonchalance but could immediately hear that he failed. He dropped to his knees to lace up his boots so he wouldn’t have to see Cas’ face.
“We thought you’d say that” Sam said, walking to the table in the corner of the room and grabbing a file from his desk.
“Yeah Dean, I’ve been watching you two do this dance for a decade…” Sam started but Dean interrupted: “us two?”
“I am,” Dean replied, and because his luck apparently sucks, he stumbled over his own feet a record-breaking three times before landing heavily on his bed. This time, he plopped down onto the foot of the bed.
“I mean it, Dean. You don’t have to carry things alone anymore. You don’t have to pretend you are okay when you aren’t. You can hurt without it making you weak. I can’t carry your burdens, nor can I take the wounds that you’ve had inflicted on you, but I can stand next to you. I’ve got you, Dean.”
Castiel nodded eagerly and then hurried off. While he was washing his hands, he decided he might as well brush his teeth.
“Dean?” A warm voice asked. Dean’s head snapped up, and he was greeted by concerned brown eyes and a reassuring smile. Dean swallowed heavily and put on his best, most charming smile.
In both visits, Bobby, at Dean’s insistence, had done most of the talking. Dean wanted detailed feedback from the hospital about Sam’s prognosis. Bobby had wanted to hear about how Dean was doing, but Dean told him that he was doing okay, which he was, and that he was being honest with Missouri and Charlie when he wasn’t, which he was. So, Bobby had relented and told Dean everything.
He looked around and saw that he was standing on the back porch of what looked like the lake house he and Cas had bought soon after their wedding. He saw the backyard beehive Cas had installed surrounded by beautiful flowers in full bloom. He walked around the house slowly and saw his face reflected back in one of the mirrors and he stopped. Staring back at him was the face and body he had had in his early forties. He heard shuffling inside the house and heard the kettle boiling merrily. Dean walked to the front door and pushed it open lightly. Standing by the stove, in pajama pants and one of his old band t-shirts was Castiel. At the sound of him entering through the door Cas’ head shot up and his face broke into a smile, the warmth of which would challenge that of the sun.
Dean glared at him. Actually glared. And Cas felt the first sliver of irritation pierce through the bubble of shock. Did Dean think he was alone in this very complicated and stressful situation?  He wanted out too. Of course, he did. Sharing a space with Dean, being forced into close proximity with the now almost-stranger he was still in love with, was a very specific kind of torture, the type of torture he wasn’t sure he’d be able to survive.
He wasn’t sure why they were whispering, but something about the quietly creeping dawn seemed to leave the atmosphere enchanting yet somewhat fragile.
Castiel was absurdly tired when he collapsed onto the uncovered mattress in his new room. The bags of new sheets, duvet covers, and generic art pieces spilled out across the floor. He had managed to put his little pot plants on the windowsill before the bed beckoned to him. He closed his eyes and instinctively reached out beside him but was met with air. His stomach dropped when he clenched his hand around nothing.
“Well, he can be the greatest person alive,” Gabriel’s voice was uncharacteristically serious, as he dropped onto one of the vacant couches, “but he’s not who we’re going to talk about. Not right now at least, although I am expecting a speech and an accompanying powerpoint presentation in the foreseeable future.”
“What are you doing all the way over there?” Dean asked after a minute of comfortable silence passed between them.
Castiel lit up from the inside, his blood singing in his veins. He was gripping Dean’s face, his hair, his neck, everything he could get his hands on. Dean tasted like acceptance, like freedom. Dean was pulling Cas tighter and tighter, as if he wanted even the idea of distance not to exist between their legs, their chests. As if he
But now, the more Dean thought about it, what Sam was saying made sense. But before the thought could bloom into something dangerous, like
Castiel finally unspooled himself and slumped back into the seat. He grabbed the aux cable she was holding out and plugged in his phone. It was still strange to have it back in his possession, kept safe and fully charged for him by Meg.
Dean let out an explosive breath, “His name is John Winchester. A veteran – used to be in the Marines. He was married to my mother for a couple of years before she died in a house fire. He was a man who lost the love of his life and then lost the will to live. So, he basically orphaned us, because the night we lost our mom we lost our dad to the bottle. And he was a mean drunk. Couple of stints in various rehabs and jail cells...” Dean trailed off and massaged the back of his neck, trying to alleviate the pressure that was fueling the headache.
“No, I’m serious. I was so anxious when you left last night, and I’ve missed you today,” Castiel admitted.
“Couldn’t sleep,” Dean said, noncommittally.“ Probably jet lag or something.” Or his first love being in spitting distance of him.
“Yes,” Castiel nodded and took a seat at the desk, “it’s very daunting for him. Max was admitted here three months ago. He lost both his mother and his twin sister in the space of a month. The grief of that... it wasn’t something he wanted to feel. He overdosed six weeks after his sister’s funeral.”
Dean started to protest but Sam stopped him by placing a hand on his shoulder, “Hey man, you look like crap. You’ve barely eaten or slept in days. Remember what you told me way back when we got abducted by all those gods? You told me I was no use to you burnt out. And you were right.  You’re no use to Cas if you don’t look after yourself, you get that right?”
“What’s got your panties in a twist?” Claire eyed him curiously, absentmindedly curling her blonde hair with her index finger.
“No,” Dean sighed, “Like I said, I just wanted some time to think. And what is there to talk about anyway? Like I know people always say you should talk, but what if there is nothing to say?”
“What were you listening to that put such a smile on your face even though you had to be at work at the ass crack of dawn on a Saturday? Was it Metallica? Metallica always calms me down and puts me in a good mood.”
Dean spat out the toothpaste and then turned to Cas while fixing him with an exasperated look. “Babe, then wait until I’m done brushing my teeth.”
Cas was so relieved that his ill-conceived words hadn’t triggered another retreat in Dean that he nearly dissolved into laughter. Luckily, he managed to stay in control of himself. Barely.
Castiel could not remember the last time he had slept that well. As he started ascending into consciousness, he became acutely aware of something warm and very much alive underneath him. He opened his eyes slowly, and yes, there Dean was, his face seemingly younger and more expressive in sleep.
Cas fidgeted with the corners of the book and Dean huffed in exasperation before putting his hand out expectantly. “Is that for me?”
Missouri nodded in an understanding way, and Dean wanted to fucking scream at the compassion that was evident in the way she was looking at him.
Dean opened the photo. It was a selfie of Sam and Eileen, their arms wrapped around each other where they stood outside a little café. Dean couldn’t help the grin that spread over his face as he saw the unadulterated
Castiel scrolled through his downloaded songs, of which there weren’t many, and eventually decided against it. He typed in a song name in the search engine.
“Bite me,” Dean grumbled as he mussed his own hair. Dean eyed his jeans that lay on a lump at the foot of his bed before shrugging and heading straight for the door still in his sweatpants. Castiel raised an eyebrow at him.
“I know I need to get better at using words, Cas, particularly now. And, particularly when everything is so new to you. And, me pouring my heart out to a stranger won’t clear anything up with us.”
He knew what was awaiting him when he opened the door. In their last session, Missouri had gone over all the physical changes Sam went through so that Dean wouldn’t be caught off guard. She explained that he was thinner, paler, that he had a couple of ugly bruises running up his arms from where the nurses drew blood and stuck the needles attached to the multitude of IVs he’d had over the past eight weeks. Missouri explained that he also had tubes in his nose.
“Naturally, the kid’s not certain about metaphors but understands the psychological effects of cosmic entity torture techniques,” Dean muttered as he pulled his hand down his face.
I finished this a little earlier than I thought. Hence, the early update. But to stick to the schedule, I will post the next chapter on Sunday.
And it suddenly makes perfect sense to Dean why both relationships he attempted since college hadn’t worked out. He’s been blaming it on timing, personality mismatches, different life stages, different ideas of what a relationship was.
Dean looked relieved. Castiel’s heart clenched painfully at the fraternal word. He didn’t like the idea of this particular man seeing him in that way.
Thank you so much to everyone who has interacted with this fic, particularly comments, it really means so much and is so motivating. I have just finished writing Chapter 11 and as soon as this fic is done, I will be updating more regularly.
The shudders that had been wracking his body before returned with vehemence and grew into uncontrollable sobs. Dean tried to curl into himself, but Castiel’s arms were there, stopping him, pulling Dean into him. Dean turned his face into Castiel’s chest, crying desperately.
“Dude, seriously. It’s not a big deal. And I don’t want to talk about it anymore,” Dean tried to end the discussion.
When the two were alone, Sam sat down across from Cas as he placed two beers on the table. Cas automatically reached for his but he did not take a sip, just fidgeted with the label:
The three hunters and the angel jumped up and there was a flurry of hugs and hair ruffles. Jack beamed at them.
He’d expected the blow of seeing Dean to lessen in its severity as the years progressed, as the time they spent apart started outnumbering the time they spent together, but he was sorely mistaken. The pain he felt after their break up (sitting in his bed for a month, not doing anything but crying his eyes out and sleeping in fitful and restless bursts) when he saw the first photo of Dean since that night, out with friends for his farewell dinner, hurts no more than the photo he held in his hands now. He lowered his eyes to the caption which read “The trouble with being the best man at a wedding is that you never get to prove it.”
Dean felt shaken by Castiel’s life story, and he couldn’t identify exactly why it had affected him in such a potent way. Why the heartbreaking story of this exceptionally interesting man made him feel as if his entire world was off-kilter – unbalanced. The floor kept twisting as he walked.
that Cas could understand what it meant, what he was saying without the words that refused to come from him.
Meg was slowly returning to her normal self. The worry lines that had seemed carved into her face appeared to be shallower, the shadows under her eyes were dissolving, the gaunt look in her face less prominent every time Castiel saw her. Furthermore, he had Gabriel back. His older brother slipped so easily back into his life, transitioned back into his role seamlessly.
Dean flew across the room and wrapped his arms around Cas. He hissed a second later when the hot coffee that Cas had been holding spilled on to the bare skin of his stomach.
Which, admittedly, is a very strong reaction to a dude he hasn’t even seen, let alone met. But Dean was not about to analyze that because the heartbeat in his ears was deafening and his fingers were curling into fists.
Cas turned to look at him. He didn’t know what to say. The vertigo hadn’t quite left and the ringing in his ears hadn’t quite dulled to silence.
“I’m going to go check on Jack,” Sam said eventually, downing the last of his beer, “maybe watch the last bit of Moana with him.”
Exactly two hours later, Dean was pulling a necklace with an amulet glowing with Cas’ grace over his head. He had felt weird after Jack had pulled Cas’ grace from his body, it had not been painful exactly, but Dean did definitely feel as if something was missing.
They had group after breakfast, in which they discussed Max’s fear of leaving the structure and safety of the center. Missouri led it, and she gave wonderful advice that was specific to Max and then to the whole group. Dean noticed that everyone there seemed to be nervous about leaving. He wondered if he would get to that stage. He doubted it. If he was being honest, he thought that he didn’t really
, her genuine interest in Dean, in his well-being, had put him at ease, had let him lower his guard enough for her to squeeze her way into his life and his heart. And it was good. For a while there, it had been
“This place is fully booked. I called earlier to see if it would be possible to isolate in an apartment alone.”
He’s never been in any kind of physical relationship, not really. He had one stolen kiss that kickstarted the destruction of his childhood with Alfie, and then, some with Meg when his life was cloaked in dishonesty. Nothing like this. Nothing like what he had with Dean. It was too unfamiliar, too special, too sacred to be used as a distraction.
Castiel nodded. Linda Tran was the other night nurse who worked the same shift as Stevie. Castiel didn’t stay in one of the rooms that she looked after, so he didn’t know her well, but he knew what she looked like at least.
He had found that he had enjoyed her company. He found himself trusting her – a weird experience as Dean never trusted anyone. Dean second-guessed everyone’s motives, their thoughts and alliances. Some lessons, especially those that were learned the hard way, tended to stick and influence any and all other thoughts and decisions.
“I don’t think it was premeditated. I think you were desperate. I think you were scared. I think you felt guilty. And you lashed out in the only way you knew how.”
“Okay? You can’t just say ‘okay’. What happened?” Dean had felt his temper rising, the anger pulsing in conjunction with the panic in his veins.
“Well,” Dean swallowed, “To be honest, no, I don’t believe in the biblical heaven or hell or anything like that. I believe that there's no higher power, there's no God. There's just chaos and violence and random, unpredictable evil that comes out of nowhere. It rips you to shreds.”
I did do some research for this chapter, but again, I am by no stretch of the imagination, a medical professional (I haven't even watched
“Yes. I never wanted this. I want to help people, but in this position it’s not entirely possible. You can’t get involved with the day-to-day when you constantly have to see the big picture. And most importantly, I miss my humanity. My soul, it is what connected me to my mom. I don’t like not having the part of me that was most like her.
This was not what he was expecting. He felt the familiar guilt creep into his brain and throb at the base of his skull. He could not spend his time with things like that. He needed to get better, needed to
“No, I’m up now.” He didn’t look very awake. Both of his eyes were still closed, but he cracked one open when Castiel settled himself at the foot of the bed.
But these urges came and went, coming in and drawing back like tides. And, all that aside, he mostly just felt okay. Relieved. He even liked getting to know the other patients, particularly the red-headed woman from Scotland, Rowena. She was a practicing wiccan, and she spent quite a lot of time explaining different symbols and star alignments to Dean. Dean understood exactly zero of what she was saying, but she was interesting, and Dean always liked people who were like her – people who were unapologetically themselves.
Well, he wanted to do more than that. A whole lot more than that if he was being honest. But not right now. Not tonight. He hadn’t slept though the night for weeks, his evenings had been fraught and alive with both anxiety and pain, and he somehow knew that if Cas were next to him, the angel’s light would chase away the dark demons crawling in his mind. He, however, would not go to sleep without having this conversation. Dean knew that it had been a long time coming. It was time to end what Sam had called “the dance” the two had been doing. Dean was tired of circling; he was ready to dive in.
Dean tried to keep the painful grin in place, knowing Cas was searching his face, “There’s a first time for everything, ain’t there?” Cas looked unconvinced. Dean knew he could talk to Cas. He knew he would listen. Dean just didn’t have the energy required to say these words, to tell these stories.
Cas felt his orgasm building faster than he would have liked. But it had been so long, and Dean was there and he was so gorgeous, even with the angry set of his shoulders and the evident tension in his face, and oh, Cas loves him so much and…
Castiel shrugged and then smiled sheepishly. He had mostly been quoting the movie to entice Dean, but there seemed to be something burning in Dean’s eyes. The green was alive and almost glowing with what Dean was trying to say.
“Is everything alright?” Jack asked, eyes glancing to Cas, “nothing went wrong after we got you out?”
“How have you been since Monday?” Missouri asked after Dean had taken a couple of large gulps of water.
“Gabriel, you were just a child yourself. You were not my parent. It was not your responsibility to look after me, but you were there for me when it mattered. When I crashed and splintered, you helped me put myself back together. You gave up so much of the independent life you had created for yourself to ensure there was a place for me to stay after the first time I tried to... you know. You dropped everything, again, when I needed you this time.”
Dean shook his head. “Not really. But, I didn’t really care either. All I could think about was that stupid ‘If’, and there was John just not …”
“Cas, I just wanted you to know that this is me trying,” Dean said, feeling borderline manic. All he knew was that he couldn't let Castiel leave this bed, and he didn't want this rift between them to widen while he was still trying to figure out how to cross it.
“Mmm. And why are you wanting to check yourself out so soon when you haven’t even been here for a full week yet?”
“Oh,” Dean repeated dumbly. The sudden lack of burning inside had him feeling rather hollow and uncertain.
“Yeah, sure, because chaos wears a hoodie and slippers at five thirty pm,” the sarcasm fell off the man’s lips.
“Well, that is why I’m here,” Dean heard Amara’s voice. He twisted in his seat. There she was, standing in the doorway. Her dark hair loose around her shoulders. A white-hot anger pulsed through Dean the second he made eye contact with her. Resentment and betrayal burned in the back of his throat as she strode towards them. By the time she was seated on the chair directly opposite to his, he was shaking.
Castiel reached over from where he was sitting and took Dean’s hand in his. Dean inhaled sharply, but fit his fingers in between Castiel’s. Castiel was fully beaming now.
Castiel hadn’t even bothered to attempt to go to sleep. He knew it would evade him, would hide away out of his reach.
He undressed quickly and hopped into the shower. He cursed when the first weak splatters of water bounced off his skin – the water pressure was truly awful.
“And, as we agreed at the start of your program, I’ve ensured that nobody at the hospital allows him near Sam’s room.”
Cas slid his hand up the expanse of Dean’s back. Dean looked at him, and Cas inhaled deeply, looking directly at Dean. Dean copied him
Dean took the phone from her, and with his hand still in Cas’, he started typing the familiar numbers. And when Bobby answered the phone, Dean felt like, had he not been sitting down, he would have collapsed.
“Uh, yeah. Nothing’s wrong, but it’s something serious, so if you don’t want to talk about it now, you can let me know.”
He knew Dean was angry. He knew he had a right to be. His opinion on Cas was a direct result of a decision Cas had made.
“Dean we will get him, we just need to make sure we have a solid plan. One where we can get you both back.”
Dean, who was standing with his back to Cas, stiffened visibly at the creaking sounds of the hinges. Cas sighed sadly as his heart broke a little.
when Cas got like this. And not because he didn’t want to. It was quite the opposite, in fact; he felt the need to scream his feelings as loud as possible. But there was something that stopped him, something that seemed to cut the air carrying the sounds of his confession off right before it left his throat.
As always thank you so much to my wonderful beta Hellbreaker42 who always makes sure to check my work, no matter how busy he is. I appreciate you very much.
The laugh and the voice belonged to a petite red-headed woman who had just walked through the front door.
, how he always stood a little too close and never asked for personal space anymore. He never mentioned how, when Cas disappeared for weeks on end, Dean would be moody at best and intolerable at worst, how during those times of absence, Sam would hear Dean in the
And without giving Dean time to argue, Castiel tore down the now familiar route to the nurse’s station.
Dean silently screamed into the pillow again before removing both it, and the comforter, from his face. He blinked at the morning sun, adjusting to the excessively bright light that the threadbare curtains let in. He missed the blackout curtains at the station.
“So, I’ve been trying to think of ways that we can shift the power. Trying to remember any lore that came up when we were hunting Chuck. Because we know that the world needs that power to exist right? So, who or what do we transfer it to? What is strong enough to hold it and not get corrupted by that level of power. But I could not think of the answer,” Sam said, frustration clear in his voice.
“Excuse me?  Weren’t you raised in a religious cult? How do you know about social constructs?” Dean lifted himself onto his elbow so they could look at each other.
He heard Castiel let out a frustrated sigh, and suddenly, he felt the pressure of a warm arm snaking around his waist, pulling him even closer to the tower of body heat that stood next to him and guided him with only a slightly rough insistence into the room. Dean resisted the urge to inhale deeply.
Castiel felt a confusing flash of emotions at the sentiment. He used to fear them, the emotions, but his time with the two hunters had taught him to embrace them. To feel all of it.
By the time he finished his dinner, the feeling had not abated. Not in the slightest. Being around Cas did
Thank you so much to everyone who has read, left kudos, subscribed and commented on this fic! It means so much to me and I appreciate each and every one of you :).
It has never been like this with anyone else. With Benny, with Lisa… It just wasn’t the same. He cared about both, had even loved them in a way, but he was not
“Not everyone runs away from something just because they are young and scared of their feelings. Some people know what they want, and they fight for it,” Dean was glaring heatedly at Cas.
Just like they never spoke about the time when Sam was thirteen and he had walked in on Dean kissing another boy on his bed in a rented motel room somewhere in California. Sam had squeaked in surprise and Dean had thrown a pillow at him with a mumbled “
The word pulsed in his mind before he had time to stop himself.  He felt the smile fade from his face, felt the familiar cold rush of shame rolling through his entire nervous system. But before he had time to be completely swallowed by the feeling, Dean reached out and grabbed his hand.
And then after that, it just seemed like his brain got a kick out of keeping him awake at night, replaying all of his failures, his mistakes. On days when his mind was being particularly cruel, it would create intricate storylines of the lives they would have had.
He had been standing outside of Sam’s room, staring through the clear window at the dull, white-washed curtains that were surrounding the bed, for the past five minutes.
Being around Cas was difficult, and it was confusing. It was like dipping a scarred arm into vinegar, just to realize that none of the cuts had healed fully, the scabs washing off easily leaving nothing but a searing burn in their wake.
Cas was white as a sheet, all the blood seemingly gone from his cheeks and lips. There were droplets of sweat clinging to his hairline, trickling slowly down his face and he was dragging in deep, wheezing breaths.
“And, as I’ve mentioned, Sam was not in the accident nor would it be wise to give your brain triggers that will force premature memory recall.”
Luckily (unluckily?) for him, Becky did not pick up on his disinterest and was content to continue talking as long as Castiel grunted,
“And, uh, while we’re on the topic of unpleasant situations,” Gabriel continued, his voice so unfamiliar when laced with anxiety, “could you tell me what happened? Meg told me some of it, but I want to know. I mean, if you’re ready and, like, absolutely no pressure or anything.” Castiel swallowed heavily before agreeing. And so, he spent the rest of his afternoon relaying to his brother one of the darkest times he’d ever been in. He listened to Gabriel apologize for leaving, for not being there. And Castiel apologized for not reaching out when he felt himself spiraling.
Cas stroked Dean a couple of times, as he cupped Dean’s neck with his free hand, running the pad of his thumb over his Adam’s apple.
“She died the day I was born. But she’s in heaven now. I met her once. She said I would do great things, I don’t think that’s possible. Everything I do seems to go wrong.”
The police were all outside, guns pointed at them as they left the room. All their guns trailed after them. As they slowly made their way to the main entrance.
Derek nodded and followed, opening the door to see Sam crouched in front of Jack again, speaking in a soft voice. Dean was leaning on the far wall, his arms crossed.
Entering the interview room again, Prentiss sat down and tried to engage Jack. Jack answered basic questions. She found out that he has never gone to school, has no friends and likes nougat. Jack clammed up when asked about what his parents do for work.
Jack looked at the cup that was handed to him. It had some black liquid inside. He swirled it around in the cup, careful not to spill. Suddenly, he tossed the cup down onto the floor, staring but not seeing.
Outside the interrogation room, Dean started shouting at the agents, “I told you not to stress him out. Do you know how dangerous he could be?”
“So forensics just got the results from the DNA of the victim. It matches the suspect DNA from the rest of the crime scenes. He’s our unsub.”
“We have so much information, yet no information? What do we know about the Winchesters?” Rossi asked the team.
Aaron gave out the orders and everyone went to get ready for the Winchesters’ arrival. There were so many inconsistencies in their profile, the most they can do is to be prepared for anything.
“I told you I don’t know. I was lost and the man told me he could help me. He said to follow him. I did and he did something to me. I woke up and we had reached a cabin somewhere in the woods and he hit me. He hit me again and again and again shouting something. Sam told me I couldn’t hurt humans so I didn’t hit back. But he didn’t stop. I just wanted him to stop.”
“There doesn’t seem to be a way for the body to be hung up. The ceiling is too high and no beams or supports to hang on. Unless he dumped the body here and used another location for burning.” Spencer commented, bouncing ideas around.
“You can’t. They won’t pick up unless you use my phone. Can I get my phone back?” Emily looked towards the observation room as an unspoken request.
The police were still on the lookout for their kidnapper, any extra manpower was setting up all their rooms for the Winchester’s arrival. They were told to stand by, at the ready in case anything goes haywire. They were all anxiously waiting for the arrival of the two criminals.
“We’re going, Sammy. Get your butt up and we’re going home. They have their story. It was self-defence. You can’t hold Jack here.”
“That’s not an earthquake.” A man rushing into the station said. Dean Winchester. Followed closely by Sam and who they assumed was Castiel. Sam and Castiel had a knife out and Dean had a gun.
“I was at home, reading. I was reading your dad’s journal, so I can help on hunts. I saw a picture of a house here. He writes how it burned down and he wanted to kill whatever that set the fire. I just wanted to see your childhood home. We don’t have a normal family, but maybe I can try to be whatever was left there. Before I knew it, I teleported here.”
Aaron looked at Derek, “Don’t let them leave the building. If they seem like they’re planning an escape, stop them.”
“My mum is in heaven and my dads are on a job.” Jack did not see the harm in telling them. Dean had warned him not to tell anyone about what they do or where they live, but anything else was never mentioned.
“Yeah but you can save yourself by not rushing in all the time. You die, who else is there to save people?”
The atmosphere was tense now, she had to turn it around somehow, “What other rules did your parents set?”
Everyone nodded as Emily went to the interview room with a small cup of coffee. Spencer and Derek went to observe the interaction.
“Looking at the body, there seem to be no defensive wounds. He was caught off guard and had no time to defend himself or he believed that he was safe. It could mean that he knew his attacker.” Spencer started ranting off possibilities, “His eyes were completely burned out but there doesn’t seem to be any trace of a fire that happened. The burn would classify at least a fourth-degree but none of the skin elsewhere has been burned, only around the eyes and face. The weapon used must be able to reach high temperatures as well as be very precise to be able to attack a point and nothing else besides that.”
“I was walking around. Never been here before, I was lost and he said he could help me. I followed him to his car and he injected me with something. I was knocked out. I didn’t even know it was possible.”
“There is. Just not one that fits this kid. I tried searching for the immediate area and branched out. No one that matches this kid’s description.”
“I’m going to talk to Jack. See what else I can get from him before they arrive.” Emily said walking back to the interview room.
Dean took a moment to consider, they are out now. Now the FBI knows that they’re not dead, they’ll be hunted down and their future hunts would be affected.
“Put down your gun. You’re in a police station, you start shooting, and you won’t be able to get out of here alive.”
The door opened to show a brunette woman in a black suit. Those kinds of suits that Sam and Dean often wore. FBI they said. From what he understood, they were like police but even the police listened to them.
“Fine. But we’ll find out what happened on our own. You guys just sit tight and we’ll talk to Jack.”
“Dean Winchester? This is Emily Prentiss from the Lawrence Kansas police department. I have Jack here, he’s been arrested. We need you to come down as soon as possible.”
Dean slammed the trunk closed and headed to the driver’s seat, ending the conversation. The drive back was a silent one, not even music was playing. They all got a shock when Dean’s phone rang with Jack’s number.
“Possibly. Based on how he is acting right now, and what he said when we arrested him, Jack could have a personality disorder. Some people with DID don’t remember their alters’ and could be accompanied by headaches when they switch personalities.”
Sam waited a while for Jack to nod, “Good, good. Now listen Jack, we can help remember? These voices will stop when they move on. They can’t right now and you’re the only one who can help them. Remember our training?”
“Not just the burns, the entire scene was weird. With what we know and what he said when we arrived, it seems like a closed case and it has no link to our kidnappings. He doesn’t match our profile. Our unsub is intelligent and organised, probably in his late forties, his kidnappings were spread out over five years. Victims all boys in their teens, brown hair, similar body structure. This boy wouldn’t even be older than me and according to what Prentiss got from him, he is still a child. Judging from his age, he seem to have some kind of disability, that's why he still listens to his parents religiously and is innocently naïve. He seems to be more like the other victims than our unsub.” Spencer ranted off.
Blushing softly, Mary sends John a warm look as she turns her hand over to give his a squeeze. “You’re right. It’s just-” she looks back at Dean with bright eyes, “my first high school baby.”
“I’m still not sure why,” Castiel says. He toys with the glass between his fingers. Benny’s bar is old but polished, intimate and cozy, the scent inside of top-shelf whisky and old stale cigarettes from before indoor smoking was banned. Castiel has found solace here often. He and Benny aren’t best friends, but there’s something about him that has Castiel always feeling some sort of comfortable. “Benny, reporters from all around the
“Yeah?” Dean smiles wryly. They hang in the moment, a strange sort of stasis, but it’s interrupted when his teeth suddenly chatter. He laughs, “F-fuck, it’s cold.”
Dean starts the coffee. He looks in the fridge, pushes a few things around, then decides to start cooking breakfast. Castiel’s been working hard between the bar and the shelters, and Dean’s been watching him slowly run himself ragged. The guy’s got so much charity in him he forgets to take care of himself.
He rubs the bridge of his nose firmly. “Everything looks like a video game that is losing its rendering.”
“They’re the only options you have,” Castiel says dryly. His gloved hands reach to grab Michael by the collar, hauling him out of the car. Michael’s still wearing his work clothes, and Dean has no idea where Castiel has kept him til’ now, but he’s not dirty and smells… well, like Michael. Like expensive aftershave and freshly roasted coffee. He’s only been missing for three days.
As he passes Dean, Castiel throws his towel over his head and yanks him playfully, enjoying his yelp before letting him go and throwing his towel back over his shoulder. "If you manage scuff them you're grounded."
“Fuck, I live in the valley,” Dean curses, darting to the sink to rinse out his mug. He then dashes past Castiel, all semblance of a calm, relaxing morning evaporating as he goes into the bedroom to start pulling on his street clothes. It takes him five minutes to change and check his phone (no new messages), and then he’s out in the kitchen once more with Castiel blinking at him in confusion. “Where’s the nearest bus line?”
Castiel felt cold all over, sweaty, and shaky. He felt the anxiety leaking into his muscles, contracting them painfully. Dean’s face, his vacant look, him on his knees in the hallway…. The images repeated like a carousel in Castiel’s mind. He heard Dean’s torn voice, heard the words he had unleashed. Castiel watched himself in his mind’s eye, questioning everything, every movement, every interaction. Did he help at all? Did he make it worse? Did he fail Dean? His chest constricted achingly. His airways seemed to tighten.
“Let me be the judge of that. Out with it, babe.” Dean said, trying for a no-nonsense tone, but he knew instantly that he had failed miserably.
“Adjusting to what, Dean?” Castiel’s voice was very soft. Dean cracked open one eye to stare at the man who was wearing his clothes, a sight that left him a little breathless (don’t think about it). Dean searched his face and hated the guarded look he found there, that look had never been aimed at him before.
Dean absolutely bawled his eyes out at Sam’s graduation ceremony. This is a fact. It is, however, a fact that he will dispute for years to come.
“Well, since we humans don’t have the luxury of Grace at our disposal, we usually use copious amounts of water and snacks to soak up the unwanted side effects of booze.”
The lead boy steps into his space. He’s probably half a head taller than Dean, but wiry. Dean’s not winning any beefcake contests, but he’s starting to fill out with puberty, his shoulders broadening and arms and legs bulking up with the weight training he does for wrestling. “You saying we didn’t beat you bad enough yesterday?”
Castiel sends him a withering look. “In any case, you asked me to be here, Mr. Winchester. I was under the assumption that you might have an idea as to what you would like to talk about.”
Later that night, settled in at home, Castiel props himself up against his headboard. Glasses on, lamp dim, book in hand, he allows himself the space to rest and fully absorb the unlimited joy he’d felt all day. This book doesn’t require all of his focus, so his eyes move over the words while his brain muses other things. The Singer-Harvelle’s made him feel more welcome than anyone he’s ever encountered. He knows they’d been wary about Dean choosing to live with him, their protective natures unsure about Dean seeking shelter with an outsider, but he feels like tonight he proved himself. From helping in the kitchen, to joining in the ribbing at the dinner table, to discussing football stats with Bobby--Castiel felt like he’d entered the Singer-Harvelle’s as a chaperone and left as a member of the family. Ellen and Bobby treated him with their own version of respect, and Jo and Sam were warm to him as well.
“Yes,” Castiel coughs, then hisses in pain, trying to roll away from Dean so he can cough up blood onto the pavement. He can’t hear anything over the rushing and ringing of his ears, can’t see anything other than the fire in his eyes. It feels like forever and no time at all for Dean to haul him up onto his feet, supporting nearly all of his weight.
She clearly must have rigged the hat. Dean himself said that he requested Castiel. Did Pamela open up the bidding to try and draw him out, and when he didn’t take the bait, she took it into her own hands? But why would she do such a thing? Why would she go through the effort of having Castiel arrange to meet with Dean and then not continue contact? And, come to think of it, why hasn’t Dean mentioned her?
“Really.” Color Castiel impressed. He wasn’t sure that Dean’s passion for dancing would take him out into the public eye. He can’t help but smile wide. “I think that’s wonderful.”
“He’ll be slowed like every other figment on this plane, but even if he noticed you escaping with Dean, he’d let you.”
“No, don’t. I really don’t feel awful. And you’re probably right. I’ll check with Missouri tomorrow. Tonight, I just want to go to bed early.”
“I’ll call for him, while I’m running,” Dean countered weakly, restating the previous argument with no better logic. Sam could tell by the look on his face that Dean did not really have a plan, he just wanted to get moving.
Castiel’s Sunday had passed in a blur. He’d fallen behind on his task for the group session that was going to happen on Monday, so he spent the majority of the day at the little desk in his room. He wrote, scratched out, wrote again and then tore pages out of the notebook and threw them violently at the little waste basket at the foot of his bed. He tugged at his hair, he chewed his bottom lip, he paced, but the words never came easier. The words scratched at a raw part of him as they stumbled inelegantly from his pen onto the page.
Dean placed the bag on the ground by the foot of his bed. He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.
Dean studied him for a minute before a small smile appeared on his face, “It’s not like it’s your first time sleeping on a couch.”
This, however, meant that he did not sleep at all. Every time he closed his eyes, the image of Sam reaching out to him with his hands coated in red, burnt the back of his eyelids. And even if these images weren’t enough to haunt him, his simmering anger would have been enough to keep him conscious. He couldn’t articulate the depth of the betrayal and despair he felt when he thought of Amara. He had gone against his instincts, had trusted her, had listened to her and she had
To say Dean melted out of the bed would probably be the most accurate description. Castiel bit back a smile as he heard Dean grumbling to himself. His smile only grew when Dean automatically came back to Castiel’s bed and dropped unceremoniously onto the cushions.
“Are you feeling better?” Castiel asked. Dean nodded against him and tightened his arms around Castiel’s back.
“Sorry, Bobby.” Dean called, although he wasn’t sorry, not really. He was very anxious about going to the hospital and he knew that being closer to Cas would help ease that burning ache that clawed at him each time he thought of his brother.
“I don’t think there is one,” Cas said as he started kissing and biting Dean’s neck again. Dean groaned at the sensation.
“Unless we can guarantee your safety, you are not doing this.” Sam says after a while, surprised by the authority and surety in his own voice.
Given that he had spoken to her frequently and was sure she was okay, Castiel felt comfortable enough to excuse himself and Dean after dinner, taking a rain check on the movie. Rowena complained saying it was unfair that she was forced to watch those “wretched cowboy monstrosities” and then they skip out when it’s her night to choose the movie. Castiel apologized profusely, but he really wanted to check on Dean. They hadn’t had a lot of alone time today, hadn’t really had a minute where Castiel could privately ensure he was okay.
“They did really seem to like it, right?” Cas asked shyly. Dean’s heart did a weird flip-floppy thing that he tried, and mostly succeeded, to ignore.
Castiel had just climbed out of the shower of the en-suite bathroom when there was a knock on the door.
“You... are not wrong.” Dean admitted with a mischievous grin that disappeared quickly when he realized the world would not stop spinning.
Castiel chuckled, “Unfortunately, we don’t have time. After breakfast, it’s time for Jody’s life story, and I promised I would check on her before she had to speak.”
“No, of course not. If Dean’s important to you, he’s important to me,” Gabriel grabbed his phone. “I’m going to text her now and set up a meeting for later this week.”
Given the early hour, he was very surprised to hear a soft knock on the door. He jumped upright, heart beating fast. But when the door creaked open, it was not Dean, but Charlie.
Amara had spent quite a few hours discussing this place with him during the past two days. Dean had to admit that it sounded nice – that it seemed more a calm place for healing rather than a white-washed room with prying doctors. But, maybe he had just drunk her kool aid.
After dinner he familiarizes himself with the kitchen. He puts the leftovers away, amused at all of the healthy foods and fresh produce in the fridge. He learns the layout of the upper and lower cupboards, and all of the drawers. He wipes down the counters and sweeps the floor, then makes his way to the bedroom he stayed in last time he slept over.
Everyone’s face flushes in anger and embarrassment. He’s yanked away from the locker, feet still tangled in his jeans, his underwear the only shield on his skin. He gets tossed around between a few different pairs of hands before a fist connects with his stomach, doubling him over and stealing his breath. He coughs wetly, the blood from his lip mixing with the saliva he spits onto the ground to clear his mouth. The boys don’t give up, someone jerking his head around again to land a punch on his jaw. It cracks through his skull. He’s never been beat up before. He’s managed to skate by pretty much everywhere, neither calling for too much attention nor getting too little attention. He blends.
“Here,” Kevin says, opening his closet. He gets down on his knees so he can reach way into the back and pull out a shoebox, rearranging some shoes it was clearly hidden under. He turns around, gesturing towards the full length mirror in the corner of the room. “I’ll show you what I have. I don’t know if anything will be the right shade but we can try.”
And here, in front of Castiel’s house, a place he’s only been to once before, Dean finally feels like he can breathe, ironically enough. There’s no weight on his shoulders, no cloud over his head. No thinking of mom and immediately feeling guilty, like he didn’t do everything he could for himself and Sammy.
So he goes back to the beginning. John Winchester. His run-ins with the law started when Dean was about five or six years old, and Dean’s record doesn’t pop up until he’s twelve. Castiel broadens his search from whatever John gets into trouble with to cast a net for anything else happening in the same town at the same time. At first, it’s odd things. Like fatal animal attacks, car crashes on windy roads; seemingly run of the mill stuff. But these are things that happen and seem to attract John to them days later, and he spends about a week in town before moving on. In pretty much all animal attack cases, there’s no reports of any more animal attacks for the next… well, ever. Cars stop crashing on windy roads, at least not with so much frequency. It seems so miniscule, so insignificant at first, but then as Castiel digs and follows John Winchester across the continental United States, he starts to see a pattern.
“And what do I have to say?” Castiel asks rhetorically. He tosses the salad in the bowl excessively as he thinks aloud.
As he looks around, taking in the closet space and the dresser, he notices some paint swatches on the grey wall next to the light switch, all different shades of green and grey. There’s a question mark written in sharpie next to a swatch of grey; the question mark had been crossed out, a shade nearly the color of Dean's eyes being circled instead.
Hands wrapped around each other’s cocks, they hump until they can’t anymore, until Dean is sure they’re gonna fall to the ground because they can’t stay upright. Orgasm sweeps Castiel first, and he has the mind to grab the hem of Dean’s shirt, which is stretcher than his button-down, to catch his release. The blatant disregard for his clothes has Dean rocketing over the edge, as ridiculous as it is, and soon his shirt is damp and sticky with both their cum, their foreheads pressed together as they come down from the high.
It’s quiet for a few moments, the click-clack of Charlie’s fingers on her keyboard muted, but still furious. “Yeah, I can find his number for you. But are you sure it’s a good idea to contact him?”
“After three you’ll graduate to serial killer,” the other says conversationally. The sound of dirt falling onto the tarp nearly drowns their conversation.
“Hello Dean,” Castiel greets in that formal way of his. It’s good to hear his voice; they’d exchanged a few texts over the past two weeks but it’s mostly been Castiel checking on him. “How are you feeling today?”
When Dean pulls into the driveway he puts the car in park, letting it idle. He stares straight ahead at the garage door, hands in a white-knuckled grip on the steering wheel. John still says nothing.
Sam struggles half-heartedly until they make it outside. He pulls out of Dean’s grip and adjusts his backpack and clothes, huffing. “Don’t take out your insecurities on me.”
Before the sun is up, fully clothed and sleeping next to a man that’s been Abstinent Prince Charming?
Snorting, Michael makes an expansive gesture with his arms. “Humans are a plague, Castiel, that God created and then chose to end. The Earth was beautiful before He got bored.” He sniffs and shrugs. “You know how quickly He changes his mind on things.”
He looks at the backs of Sam and Dean’s heads, like has has so many times for the past decade. Then, he rumbles, loud enough to be heard over the revving of the engine as the car once again bounces on and around potholes as they leave the craters in the meadow. “We should go on vacation.”
truth important, too? You’re going to die for things you insist were necessary, you’re going to die a sane man who occasionally drinks too much and punches walls to cope with a severely traumatized childhood. How is that fair?”
Opening the door to the bedroom, Dean pokes his head out. The smell of coffee hits him first, his bladder hits him second. He crosses the hall to relieve himself, then washes his hands and ambles down the hall on bare feet. Castiel’s floors aren’t carpeted but they feel oddly warm. Huh. Maybe he has the heater turned way up.
Dean smiles to himself. He still feels light as a feather. With Castiel’s feet on the ground, he knows he won’t float away.
“Hey,” Dean greets a lone man seated in a booth by the window. He sends him a friendly smile, pulling his notepad and pen from his apron pocket. “What can I get you to drink?”
Dean strikes the match, the three of them all exchanging a glance. Castiel holds his gaze for a beat longer, then closes his eyes, keeping his bleeding hand over the bowl.
Castiel is definitely sure he wasn’t meant to hear that. He lingers in the doorway for a second, hoping a good opportunity arises for him to make a more organic, less awkward entrance.
Castiel exhales slowly. Inhales through his nose, exhales through his mouth. He does this a few times before he says, “What is my relationship with Dean?”
*stares at the "slow burn" tag* boy oh boy i don't think i've ever done something THIS slow. well- maybe. hm.
“Well, whatever you find- if you can’t lift it, please ask someone for help.” He stands up, running his fingers through her hair gently. “I’m sure there are lots of strong, capable men ready to help a beautiful woman like you.”
“Do we have to go in?” Sam’s tiny voice breaks through the chaos in Dean’s head. It’s a relief, his little brother asking that question, because Dean had been wondering the same.
Rolling her eyes, she pinches the inside of his elbow, grinning when he yelps. “You’re such an idiot. When will you realize that you’re the best company he’s ever had?” She picks up the glasses of water, her grin widening. “Take off after your family leaves.”
Mary sends a worried glance to Trevor. “He’s a troublemaker, but don’t you think it might be because-”
He hangs up. Calling Benny like this had been a knee-jerk reaction, but the other thing he wants to do (get in his car, turn on Dean’s phone GPS, and run Michael over) simply can’t happen. Benny is his best friend, and also a link to Dean, so it only makes sense to talk to him about what’s happening. If he’s lucky he and Benny can take the squad car to crash their date and cuff Michael for expired tabs or something.
"These are all more reasons I should atone. I should have helped you get out of that life- I should have
Everything seems both louder and deathly silent at the same time. He first sees his dad, in his big leather coat, drooped in a chair. He looks tired… older than his years. He then sees John’s hand resting on the hospital bed, which would look unlived in if it weren’t for his mother lying in it. Everything is clean. His gaze skitters around to a few things; the monitors, the machines, the tv in the corner, his dad again.
their conversations as much as he’s been terrified of them, and he must be buying into Dean’s story.
“It’s not-” Dean’s breath comes out so quickly he’s sure he’s going to hyperventilate. “It’s not a pervert thing-”
“Ouch,” Charlie says with sympathy. “Take a bath with some lavender salts? I brought some, they’re on the bathroom counter.”
Castiel’s eyes close, a smile on his lips. His Grace is already regenerating his wounds, skin healing, body resting. New flesh crawls down his forearms like webs, attaching to muscles and tendons, pink with freshness before darkening to his soft caramel tan. “It will take Michael a long time to heal… and if God truly is gone, that means that the angels are, too. Michael has always had a vendetta against Earth… especially you two I have a hard time believing he will move on from this world as long as we are in it.”
Nodding, Dean returns to his pasta like there’s nothing wrong in the world. Normally the silence between them is welcome and warm, but Castiel feels like he’s going to suffocate. Cheery Dean is something that he loves and cherishes, but knowing that the reason for his cheer is the same reason he’d been seriously injured is sitting improperly in his stomach, making it hard to enjoy the delicious food that Dean prepared.
