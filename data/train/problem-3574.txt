Dean’s now pacing back and forth across the small living space.
“No more apologies. No more regrets. Just us. Ok?”
Ok. Song’s done. Dean’s making his way across the living room to Cas. Talk time. He’s running through all the things he should definitely not say when he feels when two arms wrap themselves around his waist.
He comes back to find Dean half asleep.
“Anyway, long story short. I had to give JD up for lent.” Dean shrugs as if that’s enough of an explanation.
“Ok, Boss. I’ll be right outside if you need.”
“You were upset, it happens.” Dean is looking disappointed. “I should go, Bobby will wonder what happened to me. We should get together soon though.”
He pulls onto the road, puts on his turn signal and goes left. He wonders if there are car accidents in heaven. The flash of that first big crash, the one that should have killed him. The first deal -- the yellow eyed-demon, Tessa. Life before Cas, lots of beer, lots of monsters, lots of one night stands, and more than a few decisions--he wishes they’d done differently. Regrets, he’s got a few.
Castiel takes a step back, Dean takes a step forward and turns around to face the angel.
And clearly some things do.
“Pretty sure Charlie didn’t program Before She Cheats into the machine.”
“Shhhhh…. Dean Winchester, you are beautiful and I have been in love with you for as long as I can remember.”
“Oh…” is the only word that Cas can find.
“Bobby is ready for retirement, offered me the shop. Sam has Eileen to take care of him now. I wanted to be closer to you.”
It’s almost two years to the day since he left. Back then, he wasn’t sure he wanted to leave. Right now, he’s not sure he wants to come back. Ottawa hadn’t been his first choice — too far, too foreign. But Dean made it clear he didn’t want him, all of a sudden that became the best thing about it. One drunken romp cost Cas his best friend and the man he’d been in love with since his teens. Physical distance seemed like the best idea, their lives in Kansas too intertwined.
“No, Dean. Enough. I was quite willing to give this friends thing, another try. But all day, it’s been like you’re coming onto me. What do you want from me, Dean? Because I am getting mixed messages.”
“I don’t usually whisper sweet nothings, but …” Dean whispers into Cas’s ear.  “We’re breaking a few rules here because it’s your first time. I want it to be …” he eases Cas’s knees closed, to lower himself down to onto Cas’s lap. “... special.” He grinds, Cas gasps.
“Sam told me to ask you about the accident?”
Cas will never understand how humans evolved to become so ridiculously complicated. Honestly, he’s at a loss. Truth be told, he’s still shaken by the prayer earlier and all he wants is to clean up this mess and either hold Dean forever or zap himself to that remote fjord in the Alaskan wilderness and wait for the end of the world.
“But that’s not why I called. Charlie, Gabe and I were thinking of heading off to the cabin this weekend. Inviting the gang, bit of a welcome home thing.”
“Imagine the team we’d make. Your fabulous good looks, my exceptional brain. We could rule the world.”
He thinks about Cas. Cas is wrong. There is no happiness in just being. Not for him. He hopes it will come.
“Oh, so you’re taking advantage of me now.”
“What did you want to tell them?”
How the hell is Cas supposed to reply to that.
“Gentlemen, we are not done… Next!” Zar calls after they’ve all downed their round of shots.
Dean leads Cas to the porch. Over the course of the day, Dean has installed fairy lights, and there is a small table set for two with the candles from last night.
Cas snaps a photo of the Impala through the windshield and sends it to Sam.
“I do this a lot and well, I’d like to apologize for what is about to happen, or not happen,” Dean makes sure to drop his voice -- one of his regulars described it as the rumble of a ‘67 Chevy on the open highway. Dean runs his hand down his own chest thumbing the top buttons of his jeans, making his meaning understood. He’s half hard already.
: Not sure what you mean. He’s got a fire going, watching a film. Usual Dean. I think.
“Your server will be with you shortly.”
Cassie, darling. Don’t leave us hanging. Give us details. Is he still wasted on the ladies? Is the Cas-with-a-vagina fiancée there too? “Hello Darling, I’m Cas -- you’ve probably heard Dean moan my name in his dreams.” Oh, the bitch potential is too delicious.
Back on land, he exhales deeply, glad he doesn’t have to do that again for a bit. He can see the cabin up ahead. There is welcoming smoke from the chimney and it feels like it’s calling him home. It’s only as he’s pulling up the driveway that he realizes that he’s supposed to be alone here. The cottage should be dark.
“I thought… you were hurt,” Cas says into Dean’s shoulder. “I thought I was losing you, again.”
“Can we cuddle?” Cas is pushing his luck, he knows. They used to do this as kids. When Dean’s dad was in a rage, or when Cas’s mom made him feel like the broken brother.
“Are we done yet?” Dean says. “There’s the two girls from earlier that had potential. How were the lap dances?”
“No, Bobby didn’t know either. I was working up to that.”
Looking back now he goes over all his terrible choices, they don’t seem to bother him the way they used to. He supposes that’s good, but the Cas-sized hole in heart though doesn’t seem to be getting any smaller.
“Kind of hoping that maybe…” Dean looks up at him hopefully. “We could start again.”
“Darling, we understand. But we have seen more than enough,” Zar interrupts.
When he comes to again, he’s definitely still drunk but less so and the pain in his head has abated. He sits up to find Dean sitting on the bed next to him. It takes a moment for his brain to catch-up. Thankfully, the room is no longer spinning. Much.
“Not tonight, Charlie, I need some down time and I’m opening tomorrow.”
They are all quiet for a moment as they take in the delicate piano inspired soundtrack.
“Come on, Dean. It wasn’t all bad. At least, let me kiss you at midnight.”
“Gabriel. Now! I’ll tell Mom about Casa Erotica.”
“Ok.” It’s not the enthusiasm Cas was hoping for, but he’ll take it.
“And it’s dumb, because at the same time, I’d pretty much decided that I need to do something about us. But, not drunk, and maybe with more words. I dunno, man, fucking date or something. I didn’t want our first time to be a drunken make out session, and I felt guilty about that too. It wasn’t supposed to go down like that. And I was kind of paralyzed by like my own recklessness. Then you were gone and I felt like it was too late. Sam and Charlie man, they tried. They threatened, begged, you know, pretty much anything and everything to get me to talk to you. And my dumb stubborn-ass self couldn’t admit that it was up to me to fix this and that I was …” Dean stumbles over this last word, “wrong. And booze seemed to be the only way to numb and forget how badly I’d fucked up.”
“You know Dean loves you and he misses you so much. He’s just struggling to express it. Not that it excuses what he’s done in the past. He doesn’t think he deserves you. John Winchester left that poor boy with a legacy of sacrifice and self-loathing. And Dean, well, he still believes a lot of that and deep down he just wants to protect you.”
“Nah, let’s just get it done. Can we cancel next week? I feel like I need the full Silkwood after Crowley.”
With that Dean gets out of bed and uncovers Cas.
“Ok, just sit here for a sec,” Dean helps him sit on the edge of the bath. “I… I’m just going to take my clothes off and join you.”
“It’s too much, I’m sorry. I can make them invisible again.”
Good fall back option if Toto and Kansas don’t pan out.
The clock chimes 5 p.m..
“Dean won’t…”
“Daddy! ‘Raff!” As she shows Cas a toy giraffe.
Cas just glares. Dean laughs again.
“Dean, they can wait a moment…” Cas grabs Dean’s hand. “Come here.”
Cas washes his hands — he spots an old dent in the wall. They must have been about 14, he and Dean had been fishing when Bobby called them in for dinner and told them to go wash their hands. They were roughhousing when Cas’s elbow went through the thin drywall. It’s not bad for a first patch job. Still, it’s rough, and uneven. Guess Bobby never fixed it, more important things to deal with, no doubt.
Dean nods. “She was home for a lot of our childhood, we moved around a lot.”
Dean shakes his head. “God, I’m sorry for earlier.” He kisses Cas’s cheek. Lyra has now calmed down and she sticks her cheek out too. He kisses her as well.
“He loves you and you’ve basically torn out his heart. And now you’re pretending you don’t care. You love him too, Dean. Come on, at least go wish him good luck.”
He watches as Cas and Sam exchange hugs. Next up, Cas hugs Charlie, touching her face as he pulls away, he must be wiping away her tears. Cas is good like that. Sam and Charlie get into her car and drive off. Cas looks over his way, seems to give a small wave before getting in his car and driving away too.
“I only make pancakes for my boyfriend.”
“Ok, but I"m not watching the audition. Dean can do it.”  Watching his bosses’ cousin audition has to be the biggest career-limiting move ever and Dean wonders, not for the first time, what he did to have his life end up like this.
“I was so fucking scared when you appeared here, Cas. My ears still ringing from our last attempt to communicate, Bobby telling me it was a suicide mission. Guess he was wrong. But man, you walked in here, I was a lot scared and a bit turned on. Maybe that’s why you kept looking at me funny.”
But it only lasts a moment. Then Cas smiles at Dean and cocks an eyebrow in a way that could be construed as suggestive. Or maybe Dean is grasping at straws. He must be, because there is no way, is there?
“I’m still a bit drunk. I still stink a lot, I want to shower.” Cas decides, trying to sit up. Hot water on his body will definitely make him feel better.
Sam wants to save him. But for once in his life, Sam listens and doesn’t call for help. Had he realized it was going to take so long to bleed out, he might have allowed Sam to call an ambulance. Save him a long death speech. At least, he got to say goodbye to Sam. Not the first time, maybe the last, but that’s unlikely too. Dean hopes this will be the clean break they both need. They’ve gone through a lot since he got electrocuted in the basement way back.
“Cas bird” she insists.
After Cas vetoes all the slutty the suggestions, they do finally agree that what he calls his gay pub crawl outfit is the way to go. Light-wash jeans, they are a bit tight and his favourite white tunic. The tunic is light enough to show off his chest, the jeans his thigh and ass. It used to work magic on Carter, who inevitably would make Cas late. The boys say the outfit is completely and totally mind-blowingly hot without looking like Cas tried too hard. They say barefoot is better  —
“Thank you.”
Cas pales as he takes in the scene. Dean is ok, he’s ok. Cas takes a deep breath. Dean’s more than ok, he’s holding a child. Fear gives way to relief it ebbs towards anger.
“I should go,” Cas settles on. “I’ll find a motel.”
“Not gonna last,” is all Dean said. A few strokes and Dean came, Cas followed shortly after. They stayed in the same position, kissing, and holding each other. It felt like the most natural thing in the world.
“I am sorry, Dean. My friend Ramzey is a bit of an exhibitionist, I didn’t realize what it was. I’ll move to the bedroom, not everyone is comfortable with amateur gay porn. My apologies.”
There’s still lots of stuff in the back. There are a few frames, he picks one up. It’s a photo of the two of them as kids by the lake, Dean holding up the first fish he ever caught. He puts the photo back. Grabs the next, one, the two of them after Cas’s commencement clinking beer bottles. He’d give anything to have Cas look at him like that again. He’s not sure why he’s surprised that Cas kept them. He’s got tons of pictures at home too. He wants to go through them all, maybe Cas will let him once the storm lets up.
“Beer?” Dean pulls a bottle out of the fridge door where he’s placed six of the bottles of Beyond the Pale’s Pink Fuzz. “Looks like you got the expensive crap.”
“I’ll let you keep that illusion for now, and I suppose Master and Servant is really a soundtrack for a second or third date?”
Cas leans in and kisses him again. “I really don’t care.”
Dean swears he hears a rumble of thunder in the distance. Dean goes back to the car. He turns on the radio.
And we know it. *roar*
“Yes, Cas?”
Cas decides to skip the stir fry he had planned and instead whips up a batch of chili, the fact that it was Dean’s favourite doesn’t escape him. He gathers all the ingredients, ground meat, tomatoes, onions, garlic, and pulls the beans and spices off the shelves.
“What? No. Mrs. Claus smells like shortbread everyone knows that. You smell like…”
Then he notices that Dean is blushing. In none of Castiel’s fantasies did Dean blushing look anywhere near that cute.
“How long?”
He sent Dean a few texts apologizing.
There is a long pause. The three dots appear, then disappear. It takes a moment and then they are back.
“No way out, then.”
He pulls the large serving bowl down off the shelf when feels a warm hand on his lower back. Cas. In Dean’s mind the touch is deliberate but yeah, maybe not. Still, he can’t help but lean into it.
Missouri puts her hand over his and waits until he looks her in the eye before responding. She shakes her head.
“I love porn, Cas, all porn. You know that. Just didn’t expect it.” Dean leans in to get a closer look at the screen. Cas prays for death.  “Whoa, this is you…”
“Hey baby brother, Gabe, good to see you.” Dean hasn’t pushed Cas off him.
“Cas, these aren’t ugly. They are amazing. Beautiful even. And you know, we are always here to help.”
“Oh dear god, if I end up with Look What You Made Me Do stuck in my head every time, we fuck, it may be grounds to end this now.”
Cas tells the car to call him.
He and the fiancée broke up. He seems ok with it all. I really didn’t want to deal with this. Hopefully, I wake up in Oz without him and I can avoid this situation indefinitely.
“Did you tell Sam?” Cas asks. “He wanted to have a welcome back party, bring the gang back up here. You ok with that?”
“I’m going to contact UCLA, Balt. Lawrence is too small and I’ll never be able to get rid of him. And this moment, I’m pretty sure I hate him and I’m stuck here for four more days.”
Dean feels Cas stiffen. Oh god, what if it’s just for tonight? This might kill Dean. A week passes in the moment it takes Cas to speak.
Lost in thought, he doesn’t notice the bright yellow VW Beetle until it parks in front of him. Charlie hops out, red hair blowing into her face. He unlocks the passenger-side door. She’s usually sunny, bubbly fun, quick with a laugh. But not today; today she is a storm.
Cas chuckles. “Checking out my ass, are you?”
“Is that a yes?”
Except it’s not true. Not really. Dean’s feeling a lot of things. Happy isn’t one of them.
Tryin' to hold back this feeling for so long
Cas is still not sure, there is the distinct possibility that this some sort of messed up ghost-of-binges-past thing. But he’s a bit more convinced that Dean might actually be in his bed. On his bed, over the blankets... whatever.
“Cas, this is Baby, the most important woman in my life after my mom,” Dean says unlocking the passenger side door and holding it while Cas gets in. Dean walks over to the other side and gets in. “I inherited her when my dad died, only good thing to come out of that relationship.”
Dead silence filled only by the sounds of rain hitting the roof and the wipers’ swooosh-thump. By unspoken rule, they never speak his name, kind of like a lesser Voldemort. Cas tries not to let the mere sound of his name get to him. But Dean’s absence from his life is a chasm he hasn’t managed to fill, no matter what he tries to tell himself.
“No hippy drinks, Cas. We discussed this.”
He rolls out of bed -- his head pounds a bit. Making his way to the bathroom, uses the facilities, spots Dean’s clothes hanging behind the door and one of his spare toothbrushes by the sink. Guess Dean is really here.
“Cas,” Dean finally says his voice barely a whisper.
“Hello, Dean.”
Not great. But I want him around more. Don’t want to scare him away. But I keep pissing him off, he said he’s going to LA.
“Ok, Ok, let us get us another road before we settle in to the sad and sorry life of Dean Winchester. “
“Remember the bash when you came home from Stanford  after finishing your freshman year? God, Dean was so excited to see you, he must have baked 10 pies.”
A pang of jealousy hits Cas, as he wonders who this Benny guy is -- new best friend? There is a longer pause, then Dean looks at Cas, Dean seems almost surprised to see him there.
On cue, Zeppelin’s Kashmir comes on the radio. He’s always loved the way the tension builds throughout this song. He realizes that the sound system on Baby has gotten an upgrade. It sounds far better than it ever has. He wonders if he’s really hearing the song or if it’s that he’s remembering the feeling of it. What Plant’s moans have always done for him should have been his first clue that straight wasn’t exactly his thing. (And damn, the sight of the singer in those super low rise jeans from those videos of back in the day. Whoa.)
Cas can’t help but roll his eyes. “FIne, mom.” He’s not a fan of shoes, but Dean is right. “I’ll get my hiking boots out of the car.”
“Morning, sunshine…”
He doesn’t reply, just looks at her blankly. This seems to infuriate her more.
“Sleep with me tonight,” Cas asks. He’s sure Dean will be gone in the morning. He doesn’t get to have nice things. He doesn’t get to be happily ever after. He’s bracing for another rejection.
But the chase was fake, and Cas laughed as Dean allowed himself to get caught.
“You know you mean a lot to me, Cas. It’s just Dad was right, I fuck up everything, all the good things. It’s better this way. I’m sorry.”
Cas’s knees go a bit weak. He wishes he knew what to say, wishes he could he make light of being suddenly cut out of Dean’s life, or quip something snarky about having moved on and life being better without Dean. But he’s got nothing.
“I’m not what you need and you can do so much better. But maybe you could give me a chance. Can we go on a date, take it slow, get to know each other again, please?”
Dean looks at Cas and winks.  “Well, doesn’t mean we can’t keep trying.”
“God, I love your chili,” Dean says from the other side of the island.
Cas made his way to the bathroom, it took a moment for the water to heat up. He was planning breakfast in the morning, lunch, their whole lives together in that time. But when he returned to the bedroom he found Dean fully dressed and making his way out the door.
Dean remembers how the physical labour of building the pyre felt good. The way his hands would get blisters from the ax, the way the smell of gasoline would linger on his skin for days. A small way to remember the dead -- a reminder to grieve. He never got that chance when Cas got sucked into the empty.
He’s tired and all he really wants is to get off the road, but by his math he’s at least 30 minutes out.
All the things Dean loves -- pie and cinnamon buns, and waffles with cinnamon. He fights a sudden urge to crawl into Castiel’s lap and scent Cas’s neck. What the actual fuck, he thinks to himself. He wants to walk up to Cas and nuzzle. Nuzzling is what needy omegas do right before they offer their necks up to their mates. Dean Winchester fucks, is fucked, gives, receives, blows and is blown and he might occasionally give in to a snuggle but he never ever nuzzles. But right now, all he wants is to do is drive his nose into this strange alpha’s neck and nuzzle. And Dean can’t finish the sentence.
Dean grabs a towel and wipes himself off quickly then grabs a second towel and kneels before Cas slowly working his way up his body. It feels like an act of worship. All Cas would like to do is take Dean to bed make slow passionate love to him. But, that's not happening tonight. Dean is standing before him, he smiles as he rub the water out of Cas’s hair. Then Dean stops, moves in close and kisses Cas tenderly on his forehead.
Dean was expecting a crushing kiss, instead Cas is gently running his hand down Dean’s cheek. His blues eyes looking longingly into Dean’s. Dean feels naked, he turns his head and kisses Cas’s hand, nipping at his thumb.
"Who?" Dean asks. Aunt Naomi is legendary for her rich conservative ways.
“Hello, Sam.”
“I was planning on being here for two weeks but I may have over-purchased. I shared a house with three roommates, we took turns buying food. Shopping for four has become a bit of a habit.”
“Benny, looks like we’re both here bright and early” Dean says, pulling Benny into a hug. “We have an audition coming in at 11. Gabe wants me to have a look. Can you send him up to Hedonism?”  All the private rooms have ridiculous names, Hedonism is the biggest, equipped with a pole and a few chairs, mainly used for private parties, like the dreaded bachelorettes.
Dean hadn’t set out to kiss Cas. Well, not tonight, anyway. Eventually he was going to kiss him. Some day. Not today. Not a few moments ago. He had a plan. Some sort of big reveal. Like a spectacular poetic confession by candlelight with the first kiss at the end of the date. He was going to be smooth and charming as fuck, a total gentleman, and sweep Cas off his feet. Then they’d live happily ever after. Maybe. If Dean ever worked up the nerve.
“Jimmy, could you pass me another cherry pie,” the waitress says. Not Cas then, just someone who looks like him. He’s not sure if it’s better or worse to be able to see what Cas used to look like. For now, it hurts. A lot.
Rather than take the bait, Dean leaves the kitchen and goes back to his room. Cas finishes putting the chili together and leaves it to simmer. He grabs his rain gear and makes his way towards the water hoping the walk outside will clear his head. The cabin is clearly too small for both of them, if there wasn’t so much crap in his car, he’d sleep there.
Out of boredom, he takes a sip the large Coke he purchased during the last stop. The sweat from the cup drips onto his lap. It’s cold and damp but he just lets it dry. Not like anything has gone to plan since he since he left — the weather, crossing customs, finding a motel room for a night, what’s adding a damp crotch to the list? Cas isn’t a superstitious man, but he is sure all these things are portent to something awful. What if he just skipped Kansas and just kept heading west to California. Sunshine, beaches, and his dear friends and former roommates: Balthazar, Carter, and Ramzey. They’d done the sane thing, escaped winter and made a bee-line to beaches and sunshine. He was going to miss them.
A sudden gust of wind nearly pushes his SUV into the ditch. He clutches the wheel more tightly. There are deep puddles, and he’s glad for his four-wheel drive. He comes to the wooden bridge over a usually shallow creek. His headlights make the water glisten -- they wouldn’t normally, the water level is obviously exceptionally high. Sam wasn’t kidding about flooding. Water droplets splatter over his car, and he feels the bridge sway under the weight of it. This sort of thing doesn’t usually scare him but he’s glad the bridge is only a few hundred yards long.
“Mmmmmm,” licking the last bit of dessert off Dean’s index, he releases it with a swirl of the tongue and a pop. Dean was looking a bit distracted. “That was amazing. Did you want to go to the show?”
Well, he’s not wrong, Dean thought. He’d been drunk and he’d gotten behind the wheel of a car. Flashing back to every single timeSam would be most upset about their dad driving home after a night at the bar. Upset that John was drunk but even more upset that John could have hurt others. And now, Dean had gone and done exactly the same thing. He was no better than his dad.
“But some alphas are.”
Cas cannot believe Dean just wants to forget their history, wants to play ‘everything is fine’. As if they can wipe the slate clean and Cas could pretend he hadn’t been in love with Dean since high school. And all the hours upon hours he’d spent with Dean, baring his soul telling him everything except maybe how he felt. It’s not that easy. He grabs the head of garlic and slams it against the counter so hard that Dean jumps.
“Hey!”
“You sure you’re ready for that. It’s kind of a big decision,” Dean says.
Dean pours him a cup, fixes it with a touch of milk and a dollop of honey and leaves it on the counter for Cas to take. It’s the best cup of coffee he’s had in a long time. Damn him.
Cas raises an eyebrow.
Well, on that they agree. Cas just nods.
Dean wants to listen to the song of Cas saying his name over and over again, preferably while Cas pounds into him, but that's not on his playlist. He takes off his boots and socks, because there is nothing sexy about that. “I wasn’t planning on getting naked this morning.” Cas nods. He scrolls his song list, looking for something sultry, seductive, and fun. He hits play.
“It was always a great combo.”
With all the tools assembled, they make their way to Missouri’s house. For the first time since he arrived in Kansas, the sun seems to be trying to peek through the clouds, he was starting to wonder if someone had scorched the sky. And though it was up and fine just yesterday, there is a fallen tree blocking the driveway. There must have been a windstorm in the night.
“Wyra — baby birb.” She point to herself. “Cas — Daddy birb.” She moves her small hand to the top of Cas’s shoulder. Then she notices the giraffe she’s still holding.
Dean’s phone buzzes.
He drives. He should stop and do the rounds. See the gang. Take his mind off all this. But he just can’t bring himself to do it. He’s spent his whole life serving other people, maybe it’s time he took some time for himself for once.
“Nah, it’s on me. I fucked so many things up. And there are many things I can’t make amends for. Us being one of them.”
“There are worse things than being alone at midnight, Lisa,” Dean says. “Besides, who says I don’t have anyone lined up?”
Dean laughs. And they count down to one, and Dean kisses Cas and Cas kisses Dean. Then, as promised, Cas leads Dean to bed.
Benny made it clear he really didn’t like Lisa, she’d apparently made a habit of trying to use the meetings as her personal dating pool. But Dean let himself get swept away, loving that someone, anyone, still found him attractive in spite of everything he’d done.
Cas seems to have regained his composure from earlier. This simply won’t do and Dean resolves to work a bit harder. He gets paid to make clients flustered, he's got this. He peels off his slightly too tight t-shirt and walks toward Cas placing his hands on Cas’s knees gently spreading them apart. The blush is back, is spreading down Cas’s neck as Dean leans forward and undulates to rub his bare chest against Cas. He hears a barely whispered “Fuuuuuuuuuuuuck”.
Oh. Wow.
“Then don’t.”
“Cas, you’re going to have to do something. Pick her up. Take her to the living room. Give her some whiskey.”
“Of course.”
Dean lies over him, kissing up his neck. It’s divine. Cas is pretty sure he could come from this alone. He moans, grinding into the sheets. It’s only then that he feels Dean’s erection nestle between his butt cheeks. He’s not sure who sighs or who moans first. Dean moves away first.
“Well Jack, I know things haven’t always been great between us. I’m sorry. I thought things ended ok. I have questions, man. Why does everyone get their happily ever after but me? What the fuck man. I don’t get it. Am I so broken, so vile, that I don’t I get a slice of heaven.”
He packed everything into the Impala and decided he didn’t want to be home with his photos and memories of better times. He drove directly up to the cabin, so he could be alone. It was late evening when he finally got there. He got all his stuff inside, grabbed two bottles of JD and walked down to the dock, watched the sunset, and cracked open his first bottle. He finished it and started in on his second. This much he remembers, it all kind of gets blurry after that.
“Fuck off, Mr. Probably Real.” Cas seems to have recovered his full snark and Dean gives a chuckle. If Cas were sober, it would cause a flash of arousal, but, with this much booze on board, not so much.
“I know what I am doing, Castiel.”
-----------
“I know what you want,” she laughs. “ But I would move off that couch or Mary’s going to kill you.”
“No, please don’t. Just, they move. I didn’t expect that. And you, you know, have actual feathers.” Cas hates watching Dean struggle for the right words.
He supposes he has to be civil, who knows how long he’ll be here with Dean. Maybe now is the time to resolve this, just get it over and done with. Then maybe they can both move on. Ramzey is right, they do know a lot of the same people.
“I am sorry about earlier, Dean. It’s been a stressful few days.”
“Please…”
“Well, I see things are going well.” Missouri is back. “Now, I know you have a show to get to but I wouldn’t worry too much, they’ll be back next year. You’ll be back here too. Won’t all be smooth sailing, but you love each other something fierce.”
“I’ve known you most of life Dean.You’ve made some bad choices. We all have. But that doesn’t make you bad. The Dean I love is kind, generous, and protective of the people in his life he truly cares about. Do you when I knew, I was in love with you? Mrs. Brown had asked me to read a poem I’d written to a local LGBT youth group. My mom wouldn’t go. And Tessa, well, she didn’t want you to go because bad enough your best friend was gay, to have you go to a gay thing… just not done in your senior year. We never really talked about it. I just assumed you weren’t coming. But as I’m leaving my house to walk there, there you were in the Impala.”
Dean looks like he’s about to say something, but doesn’t. Their eyes meet again, Cas sees anger has given way to confusion. He sees Dean take a deep breath to get rid of the tension in his body.
Dean looks up at Cas and kisses him hard. Placing his hand behind Cas’s neck and pulling him close, controlling their motion. He lets go when he feels Cas’s fingers poking into the waist of his pants. He snaps the band of his boxer-briefs.
Lyra raises her arms up to Cas in the universal sign for “pick me up”.
“Cats and dolphins like angels. They consider our touch to be good fortune.”
“I hardly think alcoholic drinks are advisable.” Cas picks up Lyra. She’s made herself rigid and hard to hold. On the plus side, she’s no longer screaming, on the other she is trying to kick her way out of his grip. Cas considers whammying her unconscious for a bit.  Dean must be able to tell what he’s thinking.
“What the hell is your problem?” Cas is glaring at him in a way that shouldn’t be so attractive. But Dean started this fight and damn it he’s going to finish it.
“Daddy…. Boo!!!!” Lyra wails, another meltdown imminent.
“But the bottoms?”
“Found her,” Cas shouts. Dean walks into the hallway to find him.
“To whoever is running this joint, I don’t care about Jimmy. I don’t care about Benny. I only care about Cas. So get his feathery ass to me because I need to tell him a few things.”
Ramzey posts a Wizard of Oz gif of ruby red slippers clicking their heels together.
“Oh, that girl was a diversion. We all know it. Just like your friends, Castiel. You both hate to talk about this sort of thing. It’s what lead you to this point. But at some point, you will have to come clean about your feelings.”  She places a hand over his. “You can try to  deny it to yourself. But only for so long.”
Missouri finally sits down and serves the plates.
He walks over to the pole in the middle of the stage. Swirling around it, flirty. He stops, shows off his ass in these jeans. He looks good, and he knows it.
He opened his eyes. Jody Mills was looking calm but more serious than he’d ever seen her.
“Is there any way for me to see your wings?” Dean hesitates, he’s afraid of the answer. “Or your true form.”
“I want a mate who completes me. A lover, a friend, a partner. An equal.” Cas continues. “Someone who wants to make a family with me. What do you want, Dean?”
“But I haven’t taken off anything yet?” Becky pouts. “The finale is really great, I call it the Colonel Sanders, I suspend myself from the pole while taking off…”
“With those low-riding track pants, you love so much?”
Cas wraps the blanket more tightly around himself, Dean takes a step closer but doesn’t sit down. He’s shirtless and wearing the polar bear sleep pants again, looks like not much else.
“Cas, I...”
“I don’t fully control them. They’re often wrapped protectively around you. I don’t usually fight it. We could research a way for you to always see them.” Silence falls again, Dean smiles and nestles in closer to Cas.
And John’s prophecy is one step closer to coming true — Dean is now a little bit more alone.
“No, I am not drunk.”
“Yeah, so Sam and I found this spell and we… ,” Dean stops dead in his tracks, and  blinks a few times to register the angel in front of him -- Castiel, Angel of the Lord, in his human vessel completely and totally naked.
“Have dinner with me tonight. Clear the air.”
“Oh, is that what you think happened?”
“It’s resolved, Balt, I’m done. I am moving on.”
“I came home early from a business trip,” Cas starts through the tears. “I found Michael getting fucked by a glitter-covered bear wearing assless chaps on our couch. Some sort of pride thing. I walked in and I could hear them, you know. And Michael is making all those sounds I thought were only for me… And there are tiny itty bitty small pieces of shiny stuff all over the walls and the floor.
Dean smiles. “Nice,” he says out loud.
He sits on the floor of the barn, head in his hands. He sees no reason to move.
My fault, I didn’t tell him you were coming.
“I don’t want to wait until midnight.”
Cas wonders if wanting to be left the fuck alone is cause enough for justifiable fratricide. He takes another pull from the bottle and prays for death to take him before his very obnoxious brother finds him.
“No, I was surprised. It’s a bit intimate.”
“Help me to the shower?” Cas says with renewed purpose.
It’s a bit hazy after than, but Cas worked Dean out of his jeans, mouthing at the erection hidden behind the boxer briefs..
“They are soft, almost like they aren’t there at all. Incredible.” He leans over and kisses Cas on the lips.
Dean’s turn to kiss him.
Cas just nods, he wants to yell and scream but also wants to pull Dean into his arms and never let go. Dean makes the decision for him, he puts Lyra down on the floor and takes a step closer to him.
Once upon a time there was a beautiful omega named Dean Winchester. He was tall for an omega, strong too, with golden brown hair and  skin was covered with freckles. Alphas from all around the land would come to ask his alpha mother, Mary,  to arrange for mating. But she’d been widowed at a young age and, after the  arranged marriage with her omega-husband John ended violently, she swore that no pup of hers would ever be forced into a mateship with someone they didn’t love. Not that didn’t stop them from trying to talk her into it. And as rumours of the gorgeous, strong, freckled omega spread, Mary was spending more and more of her time sending suitors away.
“Listen, I’m all for sharing our feelings and braiding each other’s hair or whatever…”
Dean isn’t sure why he keep fucking up with Cas. Ok, he knows. He fucks everything up. He desperately wants Cas back in his life, knows it’s best for Cas if friends is all they are. But damn, sometimes his brain goes offline. Like 10 minutes ago, god what is that — forcing himself on Cas or anyone is not cool.
“Were you serious about kissing me at midnight?” Cas says. “Charlie assures me that odds are you were.”
Gentlemen please!
Looking at Dean, Cas is pretty sure he’s sober. But Dean always could hold his liquor and the evening is still young.
Lyra is no longer in the kitchen. And there isn’t the pitter patter of little feet to guide them. Their place isn’t that big. Dean starts in the bathroom and the bedroom, while Cas checks the closets. He’s still reeling from a few moments ago but for now, they have to focus on finding Lyra.
“I’d give him money to stop,” Dean deadpans and shudders.
Minus Cas, of course, who could maybe explain to Sam why Dean’s death is fair, and that Dean is truly ok with dying. Hopefully Cas will be there to comfort the grieving, unseen.  He wonders how Sam feels about being the last man standing.
He only called him Castiel when they were pissed with each other. Cas just ignores him and starts stacking up logs by the house. But Dean is now in a snit. He can’t help but keep criticizing and explaining how things are supposed to be done.
Cas does. He’s thankful for the water hiding the tears that are suddenly falling. But Cas is sure Dean knows, he could always tell.
He’s not sure what happened next, but he woke up the next morning on the floor of the bathroom in the cabin, a nearly empty bottle of JD in his hand, whether the second or third he doesn’t know. He threw up but it was mostly dry heaves. Feeling woozy, he got up, had a glass of water and some Advil, and passed out on the couch.
“I’d like.”
“I think Lyra can.”
Cas is supposed to laugh, but instead he just looks at Dean. Dean had forgotten exactly how disarming Cas’s looks could be. He bites his lower lip. Worries and waits.
He tries to slow the windshield wipers, the rain now more of a cloud of wet mist. The splash from the vehicles ahead of him means that visibility is still terrible and he can barely see the road ahead of him, so he turns them back up. He follows the lights of the transport truck ahead of him. He looks down at his speedometer, the traffic has slowed yet again. Cas curses the weather, curses every decision that led him to this moment. He’d try praying if he still believed in all that religious crap.
Cas sits impatiently in the car, he’s only been in Kansas half a day and already Dean is fucking up his life. He considers getting out of the car and peeing on the Impala’s wheels, but it’s windy. (And he has a soft spot for the old girl, gas guzzler that she is.) He really doesn’t want to deal with any Winchester drama. He’s about to turn the car back on and head back to Lebanon for the night, when Dean opens the front door holding his phone in one hand, making a frantic motion for Cas to come in with the other.
Cas lets out a deep sigh. What has he done to deserve this?
Castiel rolls his eyes. “And I am wasting an afternoon doing this because…”
“Not worth that much.” Dean wants to know more about Cas’s boyfriends. But not really any of his business. Cas raises an eyebrow and smirks. “Out with it then.”
Now, now, maybe they’re taking it slow and spending a lot of time talking.
He sees the fish jumping. It’s the perfect day. Maybe they are all perfect. Too perfect… maybe this isn’t heaven at all. Maybe this is some sort of hell where you get to have everything you want except for the one thing that you need to make it worthwhile, and being forced to watch everyone live their bliss.
It’s misty outside, but it’s not pouring. The winds have died down as well. Cas makes his way down to the dock, he’s spent a lot of time fishing, swimming, watching the sun set from here. When he thinks of the cabin, this dock is what he thinks about. Dean taking a running start before cannonballing into the lake. Hell, he’d even had his first beer here, the few they’d stolen from Bobby’s stash. It was here that Cas first told Dean he was gay. To his credit, Dean just took the news in stride and said he didn’t care, he just wanted Cas to be happy.
He pulls into the driveway. His worst fear is realized when he sees parked there the jet black 1967 Impala. The only thing Dean ever truly loved. He turns off the wipers. Rests his head on the steering wheel.
“Are you likely to change your mind about wanting me?”
There is a conversation at the door, Cas isn’t really paying attention. But he hides his wings.
Dean chuckles. “Point taken, ok, she hasn’t bitten me yet.”
“There are no monsters here, Lyra…” Cas has decided that toddlers are the most frustrating entity he has every come across, why would she want monsters.
Cas doesn’t bother to deny, instead retells him the events of the night, confessing that Dean Winchester still takes his breath away.
But Dean is standing by the table looking at Cas’s laptop. He’s blushing right up to the tips of his ears. “Not sure what they do up north, but down here we do our porn watching in private.” Dean sounds more amused than horrified.
Dean hates that society is making his mother go through this. He takes a deep breath.
“Can you get in her with me? I just really need this, please.”  Cas says slowly. He's not sure how he’ll feel in the morning. Probably some combinations of scared, embarrassed and ashamed. But he really needs a shower and he can’t unless Dean helps him.
Dean thinks.
With an audible sigh, he knows the time in car has given him too much time to think. It is entirely possible that he’ll be able to avoid Dean indefinitely. The job in Lawrence is definitely a good one, great for his career, and he does love the idea of spending more time with his friends. It’s has to be the weather making things worse, it’ll all feel better in the morning. And if they aren’t, he can get back on the road tomorrow and keep heading west.
“No, no. No one else could do this for me. No one else has …”
How big is your tail, gorgeous? ;-)
by Pearl Jam comes on, he debates turning it off. It’s hitting a bit close to home. In the end, getting lost in a long drawn-out Mike McCready solo eases his mind. And if Vedder’s baritone reminds him of Cas, he’s sure as hell not going to admit it, especially not to himself.
Zar’d been kicked out of his family home in his 20s. He’d done some dancing himself in his day, so Dean’s not sure what the issue is.
“The powers back. So I sure did. Then you looked cute when I tried to sneak out. You were still asleep but  frowning after I left. So I thought I’d come back.”
“Thanks. The cabin is far enough from Gold’s lake that water damage shouldn't be an issue. Slightly concerned about damage to the trees.”
Then the doorbell rings, and without a word, Cas goes to answer it. It’s Charlie. Punctual to a fault, coming with food and to help them set up. Dean’s not sure whether he wants to kill her or thank her for interrupting.
“Hey gorgeous, you doing ok out here?” He looks in the back seat. Man, there is some serious room back there. Not sure if it's big enough for two men, but damn he’s itching to try. “Damn, I’m getting way ahead of myself here. One kiss and I’ve got a list of places we need to christen.”
Deans laughs.
“You look good on his knees.” Cas loses his balance a bit, grabs Dean’s shoulder.
“I see the bridge is still out, is there any other way out of here?”
Cas looks at Dean in disbelief, he should be revolted by their motley appearance but he’s not.
“If I had a dollar for every time I thought you were going to kiss me, I wouldn’t need a job.”
“I don’t think so.”
Dean’s been through this with Donna any number of times -- that people will and do still love him. He struggles with it.
A few moments later, his phone buzzes again.
Sounds like Dean has given this some thought. Maybe there is an opening here for them to both get closure on what happened between them. But before he can reply, Dean grabs his tablet and moves to the porch leaving Cas alone once again.
“Whoa, down Cas. I’m mated.” Charlie chimes in.
Sometimes Dean underestimates Cas. He forgets that he is thousands of years old, that he’s seen creation and that less than a decade ago, Cas got along just fine without the Winchesters looking over his shoulder. He also forgets, that Cas’s angel powers are a lot more than the most amazing sex toy ever created. But sometimes in spite of it all, that  bad ass motherfucker is a bit too trusting, and places his faith in the wrong people.
“What if there’s a fire?”
Cas tries to interrupt, but Dean just holds up his hand.
On their way, beautiful. Glad I have something to remember you by when I’m older and the pretty boys no longer want to play with me.
“Hello, Dean. Jamie.”
“Daddy!!!” She says again.
“Mom, I don’t really want a mate and I really don’t want to blind-date alphas.”
He’s not sure if getting to see Cas one last time is going to make it better or worse, if they can’t have each other.
”Hell yeah!”
The road has changed. It looks like Louisiana. Maybe Cajun country. He’d like to see Benny again. If John is here then the vampire with the heart of gold might be too. It’s a weird place this heaven, Dean thinks to himself.
(smiley face emoji) It’ll be ok, Sam.
“I’m not sure which photos he showed you. I decided to try and reinvent myself in Ottawa. Open myself up, play the field. Except I never really enjoyed one night stands like you did, but I didn’t want anything serious. Polyamory worked Zar, Ram and Carter.”
As he crests the hill, he sees a kneeling bare-chested Cas doubled over. He is too late, it’s like a worse case scenario. Swallowing hard through the pain, he dashes over.
“Hi. Did you get up and make me coffee?”
Dean stands looking at Baby and Cas’s SUV, and decides they might be safer from falling branches and trees if he moved them towards the end of the driveway. He grabs his keys, and finds Cas’s keys.
“Can you see my wings, Lyra?”
“Ok, then. Song requests?”
Cas will move away and find someone better, someone who can take care of him the way he deserves. Dean knows that Cas would never be happy with him in the long run, couldn’t be. So he’s watching his best friend pack up his shit and walk out of his life.
Cas runs the tip of the wing down Dean’s back, stopping to at his ass.
The more he thinks about all this, the angrier he gets with himself. Then he starts struggling with a part of the trunk. He needs an extra set of hands to help. What’s worse, he’s felt a few drops of rain falling on his face.
Dean would laugh, except that his little naked ape mind can’t help but check out Castiel’s vessel. There was nothing little about this tree topper. And now that he’s checked out the angel, he just can’t seem to rein himself in.
Dean nearly drops his beer. Cas and Dean have a shared a bed on a few occasions. Last time, Dean woke up rock hard, holding Cas tight. Dean is sure that Cas was awake, but neither one of them brought it up. This means it never happened. Right?
Getting the supplies out the car takes a few trips and Cas is drenched by the time it’s all done. Slamming the door closed behind him, he shivers.
“I don’t see kids or a fence in the future but maybe a dog or two,” she laughs knowingly. “Let me bring you dessert.”
“Come here,” Cas says as pulls Dean into a searing kiss. He rolls Dean on his back. “You ok?”
“You’ve never seen a live strip show and you’re related to the drink-it-smoke-it-or-fuck it twins? How is that possible?”
Dean seems to forget he’s there for a moment.
“Well, me and pie. Were both delicious.”
Panicked, he disapparated from the grocery store, not putting down the ice cream in his hand. He realizes he’s still holding it. He walks into the kitchen. Things are messy in here too. All the bottom cupboard doors are open and the pots are stacked on the floor. The stockpot holds the dried kidney bean Dean refused to try. There are a pair of spoons next to them, and a mashed banana on the counter. Dean hates bananas. They never have bananas. Cas can’t figure what the fuck is going on. He leaves the ice cream on the counter.
But Cas stumbles. Dean catches him and gets wet in the process.
“I brought you a present,” Gabe sing-songs. Really, Gabe’s only mission in life is to irritate Cas -- the only thing worse than Gabe’s impromptu visits are his ridiculous presents. It’s probably some sort of teeny glittery dildo that glows in the dark. Cas doesn’t reply, he just has another drink.
"Asshole."
Lyra seems much happier now. He sits next to Lyra. She stand up, like she doesn’t fully understand something. She looks at Cas’s front, then at the back.
Happiness, well, everyone may be happy, but he’s not there yet. He feels guilt at leaving Sam, angry that it ended when it was just getting good. Lots of shit, he hoped to fix. He wonders if there are people here, who will rightfullywant to avoid him. Probably. Maybe they’ve come to forgive him. Maybe he should learn to forgive as well. Don’t mean he’s going to his parents for dinner any time soon.
He’s tentative, it’s barely a touch at all. Cas moves the wing towards him but Dean quickly pulls his hand away. Cas looks down and  folds it up.
"Happy to help."
He is.
“Daddy birb,” she nods and says again. Then she sits in his lap. He’s not sure he’s ever held a human child like this. He can smell the baby shampoo in her hair. He can’t help but kiss her head. Eventually, Lyra drifts off to sleep.
“I? What? We can’t take on six kittens.”
“Cas, you stupid angel, I’m in love with you, probably have been since you first walked into that barn, light bulbs popping. Ok, maybe it wasn’t love, maybe it was more like lust. But I’ve never felt that way.  I wanted to give myself over to you. I used to dream about touching your wings, the way they were then. Huge, powerful. God, then Metatron, and the way they looked after all that. I cried, Cas, over what being with us had done to you. I should have been there for you. Shoulda … should’ve done a lot of things. “
“Yeah, yeah, just don’t want to share your top secret chili recipe I get it.”
Cas is at a loss for words. Of all the possible outcomes, this sort of confession was the last thing he expected.
“Dean, can I?”
He takes a deep breath and opens the door, here goes nothing. Walking into the living room, he sees Dean wearing a pair of light-wash jeans and a navy blue shirt over a plain white t-shirt. He smiles when Cas walks in the room, almost as if he’s nervous too. Cas walks up to him kisses him on the lips.
“I have a very long list of things, we’ll have to try, not all of them in bed.”
Dean isn’t sure why he keeps fucking things up with Cas. Donna says he needs to “use his words and express his needs.”  He needs Cas in his life, he’s the yin to his yang. He’s also in love with Cas, but that’s not a need. So what do you do when what can get what you need? They haven’t talked about that. Dean’s just going to crawl into Donna’s office when all this over, curl into a ball and stay that way.
He puts her on ignore, not taking his eyes off Cas and Sam. Good lord, he misses Cas, has missed him every single moment since he stormed out. But he needs to let Cas go. Cas gets to have good things, better places, better people — better than him anyway. He thought it would be easier than this though, especially since Cas keeps looking down the street in his direction. Part of Dean wants to leap out and hug Cas, hold him tight, one last time. He pushes that down deep, he’s good at that.
It’s a bit court appointed, get him to explain.I have to go.You 2 going to be ok?
Cas tilts is his head, unsure what’s going on. “Dean, I…”  am at a loss for word, obviously.
“Didn’t she ask where Lisa was? You’d think I’d be old news.”
“Monsters Inc. It’s a kids movie. Ben loved it. We don’t have it. Has your mojo ever pirated movies?”
Balt chuckles. “If you really want to run away and come to LA, then that is certainly an option. I am sure the boys will welcome you with open arms. Word of advice, if I may. Resolve things with Dean first, otherwise you’re just going to wonder what could have been. “
“Sit,” she says sternly. “If, after lunch, you never want to speak to Dean again that’s fine. But you will have this meal together. And we are going to have an honest conversation.”
Cas wants to protest, starts to but it sounds untrue. Balt is right. Leaving Kansas with all its advantages because of Dean may be a bit rash, moreso because he and Dean haven’t really talked. It’s been a trying few days, and the stress of it all may be getting to him. He still a bit angry, but he decides to go back into the cabin, mostly because he has nowhere else to go.
“I think I’ll go for a drive,” he finally says to Bobby, as he looks over to the Impala. He fakes a bit of a smile. There is hope, if nothing else. If Cas helped Jack with this, that means he’s out of the Empty. He’s here, somewhere.
He sits at the counter. The waitress is stunning, just his type, but he feels nothing for her. She brings him a coffee. Is she a forgotten one night stand? It would stand to reason that some of those people may be dead. He sips his coffee. The man working in the kitchen says something. It’s the voice. Dean stands up. Sees the  familiar wild dark hair. Dean jumps up before he has a chance to think.
“Mom, that's just a fairy tale. My true mate will walk in the room and we’ll drop everything and want nothing else ever," Dean says mockingly.  “What if they turn out to be some traditionalist and I end up enslaved.”
, Dean can see it now. “This might be a waste of your time. I’m afraid my dance skills are bit more traditional. But I really need the work.”
Why does letting Cas go have to hurt so much? Dean showers and switches into the PJ bottoms Ben got him for Christmas last year. Ben, now there is someone else who deserves the sun, the moon and the stars. Dean hopes Lisa does right by him. He promised the little guy he’d check in from time to time. Maybe they can go bowling or something when Dean goes home. Right. He needs to find a new place to live.
Cas holds the space and tries to get Dean to look at him, but it’s dark and he’s having a hard time catching Dean’s expression. The lightning streaks across the sky, lighting up the room briefly, Dean’s looking down at his hands like they hold the whole world.
The lightning strikes, the thunder booms. Cas doesn’t say anything, he weighs his words.
Still, midnight is slow to come.
They get under the covers and Dean falls asleep, without worrying about the fact that he’s the little spoon.
“Fine. Please help.”
“Hi.”
Cas smiles “Ok.” and he seems to glow a bit.
Are you there yet?
There is a breeze, and maybe birds flying off in the distance. He doesn’t even open his eyes.
Cas is trying to process this but he’s suddenly throwing up again. Dean, solid and warm against Cas, flushes the toilet, gives him a warm washcloth for his face and offers him water. Cas shakes his head no.
He logs off sending everyone his love.
Well, one of you is. Verdict is out on Dean. I’m sorry again.
“Dean, I am not sure I fully understand. I am not a bird. Why does she think I’m her father?“
“Not that I’m not planning a lot of more of this later, but dinner first.”
*****
Leave it to Cas to make asking for consent sound oh, so sexy. Dean just nods. But he’s feeling nervous and shy, so he rests his head on Cas’s shoulder.
He feels Dean slowly run his hand up his right calf. Rough worker’s hands, followed by the soft scruff of Dean’s beard as he kisses, licks, and nips his way up Cas’s outer thigh. It’s slow, reverent. He uses both hands to massage the thighs.
Dean is wearing faded sleep pants. Looks like they might have polar bears on them --— they do great things to his ass. Cas blames his sleep brain for staring but, of course, Dean turns around catches him staring, smiles and cocks an eyebrow. Awesome. So much for the pretense of not being attracted to him.
“Not surprised, the recipe is more of a guideline. I don’t really measure.”
“Yeah, Cas. We can cuddle.” Dean seems to glow a bit at the suggestion. “Just don’t throw up on me.”
Guess that’s what ended up happening in the end. With an “I love you, Dean”  he was gone.
“You must be real, in my dreams you’re usually lot more compliant.”
“Jesus, Cas. Let’s get you somewhere more comfortable to sleep.” Dean pulls him to standing.
“Cas, whatever you’re thinking, stop,” Dean gently licks Cas’s scrotum. “I love,” Dean takes a testicle into his mouth. “Sucking.” A pop and release. “Dick.” With that he’s takes Cas in deep.
But if Cas’s death has to mean something, and the world is saved, maybe Cas’s last gift was a semblance of a normal life. Maybe now is his time to bow out of the monster game, get a job in the middle of nowhere midwest, fix a few cars. Alone, with minimal human interaction and wait out his time topside. He knows enough to know that when he passes it’s not the end, but heaven just doesn’t hold much appeal.
“Glad the booze has worn off…” Dean says as he continues an infuriatingly slow path towards Cas’s now very hard dick.
“You are so beautiful. May I kiss you?” Dean says.
“I miss you, Cas. I love you. I am in love with you. I don’t want to do this without you,” Dean tells the night sky.
“Dean,” Castiel asks earnestly “Are you ok? You seem a bit flushed.”
“Can’t what, Dean? Be friends? Be lovers?”
“Jack fixed them. Better than they were, I think.”
“You never pray.”
“Oh, great place for a show,” Dean says.
Chosen. Dean made the call before Cas did it for him. It’s just like his dad predicted. He fucked up the one good thing in his life, like he’s always done with the good things. Dean knows that Cas deserves better and that’s what he’d get from him. Cas is leaving Kansas, his big brain earned him a new fancy fellowship at Saint Paul’s University in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada — health care, winter, and a new brand of people he can build a good life with. All Dean’s got to offer him is his favourite bar stool at the Roadhouse and a half-empty bottle of Jack Daniels. Fuck, in his place, Dean would be leaving him too and never give the rear-view mirror a second glance.
It’s still grey and overcast, Cas hopes it’s warmer and puts his Birkenstocks.
“It was more... intimate than I’d assumed,” Cas says.
“I’m embarrassing myself here. Like today with the clip with Ramzey, I meant that he’s the lucky one. He gets to be with you. You said he was in school and doing things with his life. That guy should be your kind of man, but damn if I don’t hate him a lot right now.”
It looks like in 2019, Dean does get to have a few nice things.
“No, no Cas. You smell perfect. Can I call you Cas? Please stay. I’d like to talk to you.”
“Thank you, Cas.” Dean says fingers touching Cas’s as he grabs the album to ring up the sale.
“Dean?”
“Hush, I am giving you both what you really want. Each other. You two lovebirds are going to go to dinner, hold hands, kiss goodnight. Cas, you can show Dean the high thread count of your new sheets. Snuggle. Not a word boys, not a word.”  She gives them the old Vulcan salute, winks, and leaves for the evening.
“So you don’t have a comeback,” Cas says as he scoffs. Winchester is infuriating. Hot, sexy, and does things to a pair of jeans that should be illegal, but he is also completely and totally the most unattainable infuriating man on the planet. And Cas is sure Deans been put on earth just to spite him.
Lyra doesn’t move, as if for her nothing at all has changed. Dean looks stunned. He keeps looking at Lyra, then the wing around her, then to Cas’s face. Cas thinks they’re awful, wishes he’d shown them to Dean back when he was proud of them, instead of the ragged mess that they are.
They spend the rest of the afternoon ignoring each other. The space is small, however, and with the rain continuing to come down in sheets, there are not many places for Cas to hide. It’s going to be a long week if they can’t find a civil middle ground.
“Ok. Rumours has it from the betas that he’s a fun lay. And that if he likes you, sometimes he’ll invite you back to his place for some non-mated action.” Gabriel waggles his eyes brow. “Cassie, you know he’s going to  look at this sweet, sweet package,” Gabriel gestured towards his crotch, “and he won’t stand a chance. He’ll be begging to try my big old knot on for size.”
They both pipe up in protest. She shushes them with a wave of her hand.
Cas turns and get serious for a sec. “Yes but I also want to be your boyfriend.”
“The weather has been like this since I left Canada. Feels like I’ve been driving in the rain since I crossed back into the US two days ago. Long slow drive.” Cas really doesn’t want to talk about the weather.
“Thank god, he’s gone,” Cas thinks as he finishes the bottle. He wants more but that’s going to require going to the kitchen, he can’t quite handle standing up right now. He lies back on his bed. The room spins a bit and he hears footsteps in the hallway. There shouldn’t be anyone home. He prays the burglars kill him quickly and that’s the last thought he has before he passes out.
In Ottawa, the past wasn’t holding him back. There was no Sam whispering “he’ll come around,'' an empty promise as it turned out. No Gabe wanting to set him up on Grindr. Ottawa allowed Cas to just be, and with license to do whatever the hell he wanted that’s exactly what he did.
“Hey baby girl, like Sully and Mike,” Dean asks.
“Gentlemen, please follow me” The maitre d’ interrupts eyeing them suspiciously.  Cas supposes that if two men came into his restaurant with a reservation under a clearly fake name, he’d be suspicious too.
Damn, Cas as the smokin’ hot commune leader who’ll invite you to the orgy if you play your cards right. Sign. Me. Up.
“I wondered if you were ever going to get around to that…” Dean says.
“You’ve never pegged me at all, and that’s a damn shame.” Dean waggles his eyebrow suggestively. Cas hates that he feels himself turn a whole new shade of red. It’s going to be one of those days.
“The extra-firm mattress? Dean doesn’t want me, it’s that simple. I just thought I was over him.”
“You know what I want?” Cas whispers into Dean ear.
“I’m sorry for…”
Dean sees an image of getting Cas ready for his date with Nora and how he looked in jeans. How nervous Cas was. How it killed Dean inside that Cas was trying to build a life without him. He should have said something then. He never should have kicked Cas out, not after everything.
“That’s good you have a support system like that.” Cas sounds like he means it, but there is sadness in his eyes. “What did Lisa think about all this?”
Dean hates himself, almost as much as he hates that Cas died thinking his love was unrequited. Dean realizes he’s crying. He lets the tears fall, maybe this is the toll on the road to this happiness.
“Hush a few seconds until we can wish everyone a Happy New Year,”  Cas says only pulling away a little bit. “Then we are going usptairs and I’m going to have my way with you.”
Dean would laugh but he’s busy denying his feelings.
“In 1 mile, take exit 275 towards Weatherston on your right.” Siri rudely interrupts.
“I’ll help.” Sam chimes in.
“Don’t you two look cosy. Tell me this is a thing now?” Charlie looks more excited about this than Dean is.
Cas is not going to last long, he knows. But he puts his hand on the back of Dean’s head and sets a harder rhythm. Dean moans.  “Dean, I’m going to…” Cas tries to pull out but Dean grabs Cas’s ass to prevent him from pulling. Cas comes. Dean swallows and pulls off gently.
The opening bars of Zeppelin’s
------
“Told her I wasn’t the marrying kind. She just shook her head, told me to put a ring on it. She invited us both for dinner at some point this week. Something about talking sense into us.”
He’s about to dial when he hears the door open and sees Cas come walking in as if it were any other day.
Shit, Cas forgot about the download and holy hell, the message was from Ramzey — a video no less.
“Tears of joy?”
“Oh, I have dessert.”
But before he can make his dramatic exit, he hears Missouri’s screen door open.
It turns out his blood alcohol was just below the legal limit, but given the empty bottles in the car, and his state when they found him, they charged him with impaired driving anyway. As a first-time offender he got a fine, a thirty-day license suspension, and court-mandated therapy.
“I”m sorry for showing up like this. I didn’t know you were here.”
Dean looks hopeful, as if one quick quip could erase everything and they could pick up where they left off. But it is too much, too soon.
“Are you sure?” Cas had asked. Dean just smiled and kissed him again.
Even now, Cas feels that this is was a problem of his own making. Dean was his best friend, and he wasn’t sure how to get on with his life without him. Moving to Ottawa gave him a chance to see what his life was like without Dean. It was fine, good even, but Missouri is right, he misses Dean and without him, something is missing.
“Hi, I’m Becky.”
“Oh you are a pretty little one,” Crowley’s scents Dean’s neck. Dean notes that smells of kippers and marmite. As if that’s not revolting enough, he also smells mated.
“No, you won’t. You love her too much for that. Besides, that’s not why I know things. I just hear them around,” Missouri explains as if that’s enough. “Hand me your menus.” They do and she walks away.
“Hi, ummm, my name is Chuck. I’ll be dancing to Spirit in the Sky.”
Ah, yes, the tone of a lie -- Dean has no intention of calling Sam.
Dean watches as Cas takes off his shoes. He wants to walk up and hug him. Cas looks up at him, like he can’t quite find the right words.
“I keep expecting to see you there, Dean.”
“Sam said something about California, I didn’t think you were coming back.”
“Oh please Gabe! Only animals growl.”
Dean leans into kiss Cas. It starts off chaste, just brushing his lips against Cas’s. Honestly, they have an eternity to get it on so why not take it slow. But then Cas sighs, and parts his lips. It’s the most beautiful thing, and Dean can’t resist, he licks into Cas’s mouth, tasting him for the first time. It’s electric. Cas pulls him in closer. Dean feels Cas’s wings wrap around them. He reaches up and touches the feathers. He’d feared they’d be sharp. Weapons. But they are soft, gentle. They move under his touch, alive. Magnificent, incredible. Dean wants to rub his face in them. He realizes he’s pulled away from Cas’s lips.
That’s what got me into this mess in the first place
“Ok, but we sleep,” Dean says.
“This bed is better with you in it. You ok after last night?”
“Dean, you were too hungover to help with clean up last year. There was confetti everywhere, the bathroom, my bedroom, even in the oven,” Cas had semi-furious going on. “There. Will. Be. No. Confetti.” He used that voice that brooks no argument. Deeper. Stronger. Commanding. And sexy as fuck— not that Dean has noticed. Much.
She pulls him to her again.
“Cas, I love this but man, I really need to take this somewhere a bit more private,” Dean confesses.
“I suppose that’s possible. Bobby always said that kids are more sensitive to things. Lucky kid, I’d love to see them.”
“Daddy!” she says as she reaches arms outstretched toward Cas.
Dean doesn’t say anything. Cas pushes him out of his path and starts to walk away.
“Yeah, ok. It’s a long sad story, you sure you’re ready?”
“Of course, they do. Just because they were born in trash doesn’t mean their mom didn’t named them all and teach them a thing or two.”
: Didn’t give him the chance.
Cas just nods.
“Cas, you don’t… what?  … That’s not…”
“Don’t. Please. It’s a good 20 miles out to the next town and Sam’ll kill me if anything happens to you out there.”
“This is amazing, Dean. I’m touched.”
He doesn’t want to believe her. But she’s not wrong. He wants to run away and leave it all behind, but having Dean around rekindled something. He’s just not sure how to describe it. He looks down at his hands wrapped around the cup. She continues.
They laugh, turning off the light on the way out. Downstairs they hear the sounds of a very successful party, but Dean just wants to be alone with Cas.
But Cas. Cas he can’t get a read on. That’s what it always comes down to. Dean decides on the one thing he truly wants, and he can't have it. Maybe that’s what Cas meant. But if he can’t have Cas, then what was it worth? Can he opt out of heaven, what are the other options? Deans lies back on the dock. He lets go and allows more  tears to fall, all the ones he’d been holding since Cas disappeared.
Dean is cursing his reputation as a lady’s man.
Dean was pretty embarrassed about the whole thing. Really his story to tell. No one was badly hurt, Dean bumped his head. Lots of damage to the car, the tree survived.
If Castiel has to listen to Trans-Siberian Orchestra’s version of Carol of the Bells one more time, he is going to smite everyone in   Little Wing Records starting with one perfectly-assed Santa-hat-wearing dancing Dean Winchester.
“Pie is pretty amazing, I’ll give you that.” Cas explains. “But just try it, it’s rich, creamy and kind of melts in your mouth.” Cas uses the fork to serve up a piece of the fluffy confection. “Here, it’s coffee-soaked ladyfingers and mascarpone cheese. One of  life’s great pleasures. Open up.”
“I’m sorry. I don’t know much about cars.” Castiel decides to let the daddy issue go for now. “But she’s gorgeous, Dean.”
Cas still doesn’t understand.
“I don’t know that I can just forgive.”
“I am not sure, a century, maybe more. No one has ever survived this before. It makes me ugly. Unwanted. I didn’t think anyone would ever want to preen me. That may speed things up. It’s been millennia since anyone touch them like that.”
“Bye Dee, Bye Cas.” As she gives the tiniest of waves before falling asleep again on her mom.
To his surprise, the world doesn’t end immediately. He isn’t struck down. Cas doesn’t say anything, just licks his lips, and tilts his head in the way that he isn’t fully understanding the world around him. It’s the look he used to give Dean and Charlie when they spoke Star Wars. It’s also the look that made Dean want to kiss him in the first place— 10 years ago.
“Cas, you gotta say something, man. Just let me down easy.”
“Not sure. He broke up with Michael. But he said the furniture had to go. Something to do with ridding the world of teeny pieces of glitter,” Gabe says and adds. “Things haven’t been good since the break up.”
“No, I’m usually bored, wishing the song was shorter and passing the time making a grocery list,” Dean explains. “Coffee. Bump. Grind. Milk. Grind. Bread. Wiggle. Grind.”
“Listen, I want to go, you want to go. I’d love to go with you. I promise to keep my hands to myself,” Cas says. “Unless you’d rather I didn’t.”
“She’s looking for a Snoopy Christmas album. We looked in the kids’ section but it’s not there.”
There was so much left unsaid. So much he wanted to say after Cas’s “I love you”, probably things he should have said when he was among the living. It was so complicated there. But it seems silly now. The stupid things that held him away from Cas, from the magic between them. The time he spent worrying about what the very dead John Winchester would think. All the slurs, the ones his dad called Cesar and Jesse. How Dean never defended them. Then he thinks of how Charlie was the most amazing person he’s ever met. He wonders if the original Charlie is here too. God, Dean feels stupid.
“Pretty low bar, there cousin,” Gabriel says.
“Whoa, lady. This is our first date. Might want to wait on the 2.5 kids and the white picket fence. Have they cancelled the show?” Dean asks.
“I’ll let you know.”
Cas thinks.
As it turns out, the meal is actually very good, no strange organ meat. The lasagna makes Dean moan, and the sound makes Cas drop his fork. Cas’s fettuccine with shrimp is amazing. But inevitably, it’s a bit messy, he wipes a bit of sauce land on his lower lip.
“Not his fault,” Cas mumbles. “ ‘m terrible.”
Dean just stands there. Deer in headlights. What did Cas just say?
“Want you, Cas. Have for a long time.”
Dean laughs. Cas can feel Dean getting hard behind him.
Grabbing his robe, he wraps it over the Angel, allowing himself to run his fingers across his shoulders. He exhales, knowing his friend can feel it.
Within a breath, Cas is up high on the pole. In a display of flips, twirls and dips, hanging from his arms, Cas moves in time to the music. Dean wishes Cas’d hurry up and take off his pants. For the first time, he gets why people pay for this. Then, as if he’s reading Dean’s mind, Cas plants both feet on the floor and falls into a perfect split and humps the floor once. Dean is flooded with images of Cas driving into him.
“I’m not sure, American cat language is not quite as expressive as English. But as a rule animals don’t combust or go blind when they see my true form.”
It’s an olive branch and given that they’re likely going to have to spend some time together, a very considerate gesture. Cas still isn’t sure what he wants to do about Dean, but he has to admit it does smell heavenly. He throws the apple core out and he pulls out the plate. He bites into the omelet, it’s decadent -- part of him hoped it would be awful.
“Shhh… patience is a virtue. I am going to go back to my room, get out my lube, work off this situation myself. Give you a chance to decide what you want.”
“Yes.”
It’s unlikely that Cas could eat even if he hadn’t had an ill-advised roadside burrito three hours ago. At this precise moment, he fears he may throw up. He hates that Dean reduces him to this. It’s been two years, five weeks, and four days since they last spoke, he should be done with all these feelings.
“Yes! I’d hoped to be there by now, but traffic is slow. Weather keeps getting worse. Are we sure this isn't some biblical prophecy that has been overlooked? Perhaps I should make building an ark one of my first priorities.”
“Oh angel, I’m sorry. I didn’t think…”
“Not sure guys like me get to be happy. I’ve done some awful things.”
“Castiel, am I saying that right? I have one very important question. Do you promise to keep your pants on?”
The first time Cas kissed him. He was recovering in a hospital bed after Alastair got his last digs in. Cas unable to heal him. The nurses had just come by to top off his pain meds, Cas watching over him. As he drifted off, barely hanging onto consciousness, Cas kissed his forehead then was gone. At the time, he thought it was peace and serenity, but maybe it was love.
“That sounds like Gabriel.”
“Then firemen. This discussion is not over for another time.” With that, Cas pulls down Dean’s pants and boxer briefs. “Off!”
Dean has no clue who Mika and Bob are, they might be great and devout or whatever,  but Cas blessing random children cannot be good. Dean GPSes Cas’s location,  grabs his flannel shirt and his shoes and runs outside. He groans as he darts up the stairs and out the bunker doors. “Note to self, get more angel mojo next time.”
Dean reaches up and kisses Cas to reassure him, but looks down. “We’re good. We’re good. I’ve just haven’t been with a lot of men.”
“Cas, it’s ok.” Dean sounds like he’s trying to convince them both. “Sam explained. I didn’t tell him I’d be here either. Did you eat? I have some left-over pasta.”
It was good to be prepared. Thank you.
“Ok, I’ll look in the shed next to the ax. Be there soon.”
Dean sits down, playing with the wing now wrapped around him. Running his fingers through feathers. Cas hums, content for the first time today.
“Sadly no, I took a boat over. Jody’s due to swing by later to do the rounds and check on everyone in terms of provisions. Let me know if you need anything. Ain’t no way out. Time to curl up with a good book and enjoy a bit of quality down time.”
“Daddy up!” She says when Cas makes no moves to get up off the ground. Instead he looks to Dean for guidance.
“Unlikely. You’d be on them already. Unless you’re planning to kiss Cas, you two always were tied at the hip. So what do you say, for old times sake?”
Getting out his tablet, he searches for bachelor and one bedroom apartments. Maybe he needs a two bedroom if the little guy is going to visit. Prices near the garage aren’t too bad, and if it’s walking distance he won’t need to pay for parking. A notification pops up:
“Dean, it is not your fault. Thank you for the coffee. I’m going to stretch and meditate.”
What the hell is Dean supposed to do now? Dean is a mess. And he’s not ready to talk about it. Sam knows something’s wrong but Jack rebuilt the world and well, Sam’s got Eileen and a chance at his happily ever after. The love of Dean’s life got sucked into the void. Probably to never return. Maybe Dean deserves this end for, well, any number of things that have happened since he got sent to hell. Probably for a few things before that too. So Dean pretends. Pretends he doesn’t miss Cas with every single ounce of his being, pretends to smile, and love pie. Mostly, deep down. He hates himself. Eternity is a long time to realize that  your only chance at happiness has, more than likely, passed you by.
“Sure thing.”
Dean showed up with a dozen doughnuts and coffee. He went to his first AA meeting later that week. He never did call Cas.
Not bothering with the table near the kitchen, they set up the meal on the coffee table in front of the TV. Dean sits on the couch with a full cushion separating him from Cas. He grabs some cheese to sprinkle on his food at the same time Cas does. They touch briefly before both pulling away like they’ve been burned.
Dean had everything he needed, and had little interest in finding a mate. He had a job working as a mechanic, and a sweet, sweet ride of his own. He even had his own little apartment apart from the family house. He had friends, people he loved and a long list of betas who were more than happy to help him through his heats and anything else he might feel like getting up to, into, or allow to get into him. The last thing he wanted was an alpha to try to tell him what to do.
Dean reaches to the spot. “Here?” He barely touches the broken bits that Cas just pointed out.
The film is almost done when they hear a quiet knock at the door.
“Personal space.”
“I guess that answers that question,” Sam says, looking completely flummoxed by this turn of events. “We were just coming up to see if you two were ok. With the radio silence, we figured the safe money was on double murder.”
“Like Mrs. Claus.”
Balt laughs. Cas isn’t sure what to make of it.
“Ummmm, I think, in order to get the full impact of the dance, as naked as you would for a normal, paying client.”
“Probably.”
Dealing with Cas being gone for good nearly drove Dean back to drinking. Lisa, well, she didn’t get it, wouldn’t give him space to figure it out. They’d had one hell of a fight about it, something about how if he was so upset about Cas, he should marry him instead. She may have been onto something.
“I’m wherever you are. Jack says we both deserve it. He’ll come get us if he needs help, God rarely does.”
As they close the space between them, Cas gently wraps a hand around Dean’s neck, rubbing his thumb along the stubble on his cheek. Dean leans in, he’s usually the one initiating things, and it’s so nice to just let it happen. Then Cas’s lips are on his. It’s gentle, tender even. Dean tries to deepen the kiss, but Cas pulls away.
Cas sighed.
Dean gives a faint smile.
Dean shakes his head no. “Kind of enjoying our bubble. But I guess I can’t stay up here forever.”
He dusts himself off, grabs the coats, the bowl, the weapons and places them in the trunk of the Impala. He finds the weapons compartment empty. There probably aren’t a lot of monsters to gank here, but you can never be too careful.
Muriel gets up and walks out of Dean’s lap and joins the other adults cats over to the side. Cas runs his hand down her back as he address Bob and Mika.
“Dean, I’ll bottom if that’s what you’re asking.”
Cas leans forward, Dean does too and their noses bump. Guess, he’s not the only one feeling awkward and uncoordinated. They both laugh, and  try again. It’s been moments since their last kiss but it feels like forever. They move closer. Then Cas’s lips soft and glorious are on Dean. This time the kiss deepens. Cas nibbles and Dean’s lower lip, tongues tease and explore. It’s Everything he hoped it would be. The stubble, the strong nimble hands pulling him closer.
Moon digs her claws into Dean’s shoulder. “Hey Moon! Stop that.”
“I thought you might want help drying off,” Cas says. Dean swears Cas’s voice is an octave lower than it was the last time they spoke. His voice has always done things to Dean. But standing there, in the candlelight, Dean’s mouth goes dry. He swallows hard.
Sam cries some more. Dean hates to see him hurt, but it’s better this way. Sam calls their closest friends to let them know. He tells Jody to stay away, Donna too -- they won’t listen, Dean knows that. His death will hurt them too. Eileen won’t make it in time. Sam tells them all he needs to the part alone. But the grieving, everyone will help him with. They’ll all spread the word. And as people leave after paying their respects, maybe Eileen can convince him that enough is enough, and he should find another way to help the world.
“Hey, umm… you got a sec?”
Listen, I only need one lion. And Cas said it was stormy. Oz for the win!
Maybe you took photos. Then it’s not telling it’s showing.
“Hmmmm… “ Dean climbs into the bed next, pressing his body against Cas’s. “I’m hoping for a few more days now. There’s this guy in my bed, and I’d feel like I have some nights to make up for before I free him.”
“Nah, Lisa and I fizzled out a while ago. I proposed because it seemed the thing to do.” Dean shrugs. “Long story. But I’ve been through worse.”
“Hey dude, it’ll be ok. We’ll make sure you aren’t completely cut off.  I know it’s not ideal. But it needs to stop pissing rain for a good 48 hours, so the water level can fall a bit and they can fix up the bridge enough for you to drive over it. Take another few days after that. Give it four days.”
“Dean! Are you here?” he braces for silence.
“A please might be nice.” But Cas comes over to help, pointing out how to cut through this knot. Dean knows how to solve the problem, he just needs Cas to hold something.
Old Cas would have made nice but the apology to Dean is as far as he’s willing to go.
The scenery changes again. He hears another rumble of thunder in the distance. He follows some dirt roads. He sees the barn, the place where they met. Parks the car, he’s not sure why but he checks out the trunk. It’s empty, save for a trenchcoat and that jacket with Cas’s handprint. He takes them both into the barn.
“You could be the one. Your true mate, all growling and bells ringing as you two can’t help but rip each other’s clothes off.”
Cas chuckles and switches sides, then kisses a trail down Dean’s belly. Dean panics for a moment, pushing Cas away. Cas stops immediately, “Dean?”
: I hate that question.
“You smell like you’ve already exchanged bites,” Dean says as he shoves Crowley away standing to give himself some much needed breathing room.
“Think she found you.”
The barn looks exactly like it used to. The sigils are all still there, all the weapons, the bowl they used for the spell, and the demon knife Cas pulled out of himself. It’s as if it was just sitting here all this time waiting for them to find it again.
“Dean, I want to get to know you before we mate, but may I please touch you?”
Tell me you had sex with him.
“We will obviously take precautions, Dean,” Cas had explained, apparently reading his mind. “Safe sexual practices are important.”
“Hey, can I get a hand here,” Dean barks at Cas, it comes out harsher than he’d meant.
“Probably best we stop. Goodnight, Dean. My door will be open.”
Dean holds up a can of ginger ale.
“I’ve been known to indulge in Kind of Blue,” Dean offers. It seems a ceasefire has been reached. Dean smiles.
“So Deano, mon frere, inquiring minds want to know, which hottie are you going to be kissing at midnight?” Gabe, one of Cas’s cousins, always right to the point with a question Dean doesn’t want to answer.
Cas is not really a hugger. In fact, Dean can count the number of times they’ve hugged. (He may have relived them in his mind thousands of times.) But for some reason, Cas allows Charlie to hug him.
He considers turning around and finding a motel for the night but the nearest one is a 30-minutes drive on a good day and he really needs to use the washroom.
Victor has seen a lot of desperate alphas working this detail but Castiel is the first who really, really doesn’t want to be here.
“Hi Dean,” a sultry voice whispers into his ear.
“ ‘m hallucinating.” Cas adds before his stomach revolts and he has to dash to the washroom to throw up. Dean follows him, pours another glass of water and presses  a cool compress onto the back of Cas’s neck.
“Perish the thought,” Castiel says.
Cas looks right at him, Dean always feels that Cas sees him in a way no one else does.  “You know Dean, I used to be able to tell what you were thinking. Penny for your thoughts.”
Finally out of the apartment, they walk side-by-side down the street towards the car. They’re a bit close for two friends but neither seem to mind. They’re about halfway down the block when Castiel spots the vintage Impala, he’s seen only ever seen in the store parking lot.
“Dean, did we order?”
“Leia to your Solo vs. Picard to my Riker. Charlie clearly has some wrong ideas about me.”
“I take it that’s a yes. Guilty pleasures…” Dean tries to suppress a moan while swatting Cas’s hand away. “I should take you back to my place, put on some Taylor Swift.”
Ramzey, true to his word, has sent through a link to the photos and videos of  his goodbye party. It’s the usual debauchery and goings on, Carter and Ramzey laughing as they deep-throat a banana. The pile of them in Balt’s massive bed. Cas in the middle surrounded by all his lovers — he vaguely remembers someone setting up that camera. God, things were so much simpler last week. A lot of love, laughter and great friends. It was easy. He considers emailing his contact at UCLA, maybe another year away would do him good.
“If you’re going through hell, keep going,” he says out loud. He takes a few more deep breaths. Cas tries to comfort himself thinking of the cute little house waiting for him in a few weeks. Gabe and Sam found it for him on a lovely dead-end street. The previous owner even had a small garden planted. He can handle two weeks wallowing in memories at the Winchester/Singer family cottage until his place is ready. Right? Really. It’s just memories, they can’t hurt him. He wonders if Missouri is still up there. Maybe he could go visit her, seek some advice, she always had a knack for making him feel better.
He takes his time at the sink, but he can only hide in the bathroom for so long. Taking a deep breath, he opens the door and heads back in the living room. It’s only then that he gets a really good long look at Dean — still impossibly stunning— barefoot, in a well-worn pair of jeans that fit like a glove, a faded Zeppelin shirt. Either time has been kind to Dean or Cas has forgotten how breathtaking he is.
I know you’re right. But don’t know that he’ll talk to me, and right now, having a house fall on me sounds like the best possible outcome.
“ Apple, my options stuck out here were limited.”
And he’s tired of pussyfooting around Dean. He’s just not sure what Dean wants from him, he’s not sure what he wants from Dean either. Fact is, right at this moment he feels more alone than he has in a very long time. He considers logging into chat, knows that someone is likely there to help, or to try and make him laugh. He’s just not sure he can fake being happy even for their sake.
“Thank you, Garth. I’ll get in touch with Jody to see if we can arrange something. There are some matters I need to attend to.”
“As long as you’ll have me.” Cas never hears the reply before sleep overtakes him.
Cas looks at Dean, Dean looks at Cas, and for a moment neither of them say anything.
“Ummm, Cas.”
“Very ok. Probably for the first time in a while.”
Thankfully there were only two alphas left for the day. Two more from the Milton clan -- great, they were super rich, totally entitled and known for their conservative, traditional ways. If there was a way to get three strikes before stepping up to the plate, being a Milton was it.
He locks eyes with Cas. “I love Marvin Gaye, guy knew sexy, makes every thing just a bit hotter.”
“Ssssshhhhh, we’ll get to you two soon enough…” She pulls away, hands on each of Cas’s shoulders.  “Castiel, let’s have a look at you. Looks like the North has been kind to you. I made you cookies.”
Wanna come over and find out
Dean doesn’t care. He kisses Cas once more.
“Are you just asking that because you want pancakes?”
“Now, that we’ve all had some time to calm ourselves.” Cas and Dean both start to say something, but Missouri holds up her hands.
Cas blinks a few times, nods and takes another sip of his coffee. He feels anger bubbling just under the surface. “This is not Dean’s fault,” he mumbles to himself, calming himself with a deep breath before he finally speaks. “How long?”
“Yes.” Why is that still so hard to admit? Cas takes a step towards him.
Castiel chuckles. Gabriel is about to chime in but Charlie shakes her head and grabs his arm. “Handmaiden, you sure you’re ok?”
There is more open road, a bottomless tank of gas, and no need to stop. Until he sees a diner. He’s not hungry but feels compelled to stop. It looks familiar, maybe the diner from Twin Peaks. If it is, Dean will know this is hell.
“Yeah, he’s here. Safe and sound. Inside.”
“Cas!”
The kettle whistles, Dean grabs a tea bag, and Cas’s favourite cup. He fills it before adding some honey and handing it to Cas.
“Hello, Dean.”
“Gabriel, please leave!” Castiel says finding his human voice. “Take Charlie to dinner. Dean and I are going to get to know each other.”
“What? Oh God no,” Dean laughs. “I asked him why I would want him for a mate and he dropped his pants.” Castiel laughs, deep and long. The tension is broken for a moment.
“To what do I owe this … pleasure?” Whatever it is, Cas is sure it’s going to be terrible and probably designed to make him look awkward and nerdy. He finds Dean staring at him again. Dean smiles. It reaches his eyes. Cas pretends that his knees don’t go weak. The blush is harder to hide. He wonders what would happen if he were to kiss Dean, right there.
“Hey, Cas.”
“Oh come on, the skinny dude in the trucker hat was funny!” Gabriel smirks. “You have to admire that kind of confidence.”
He drives. He drives because he doesn’t know what else to do. He drives because it’s something to do. He listens to the radio, all those sad songs that remind him of Cas. Eventually the sun sets and he finds a spot in a field where he can see the entire night sky.
Dean laughs and he pulls down his clothing the rest of the way and kicks them to the side. He looks up at Cas who is casually stroking himself while checking Dean out.
-------
I spoke to Dean. Tell me you aren’t back out on the road.
“Huh, I was right,” Cas says looking down.
“Then don’t.”
There is a debate about whether or not to have dessert in bed. In the end, they decide that adding pie filling to the mess their sheets is probably not the best idea. They settle onto the couch instead. Cas doesn’t love pie, but maybe it’s that Dean made but it’s delicious. But he can do better. He crawls onto Dean’s lap, pulling off his shirt and t-shirt.
“You don’t know what happened.” It’s such a mess. Fuck, he knows better than to mix his liquors. Tequila, whiskey beer — they were fucking asking for trouble, and trouble with Cas it was. If only he could have kept his libido in his pants.
“Thought you wanted to take things more traditionally.” Cas teases but takes a step closer to Dean. “Look at me.”
Dean, between Cas’s legs, drapes himself over him. And their lips meet, morning breath forgotten, gentle languid kisses become more urgent.
At the moment, he’s listening to a sales pitch worthy of a used car salesman. The alpha in front of him is named Crowley (no first name), he’s dressed in black and shades of contempt. He has chosen to stand. It still doesn’t hide the fact that he’s much shorter than Dean.
“I’d like to kiss you?” Dean answers the question by closing the space between them and pressing his lips to Cas, gently nipping Cas’s lower lip. He feels Cas smile. Cas tastes like toothpaste and smells like lavender body wash. Dean’s been secretly loving the smell lingering in the air after Cas’s shower. He feels the towel fall to the floor. Cas nuzzles across Dean’s chin, to nip at his earlobe.
He’s about to say no but he sees the mint chocolate chip on the counter. “I can. Apparently this is my day of thieving. The ice cream is stolen too. Anything else we need, since I’ve turned to a life of petty crime.”
“Will you make me pancakes?”
“It may be hopeless, Cas.” He looks to Lyra. “Lyra’s like a baby bird that has imprinted on you.”
Hey, don’t kink shame.
“Which part? The part where you both had too much tequila and traded hand jobs? Or the part where you couldn’t get out of there fast enough and ghosted him?”
It’s the first time things feel sort of normal between them.

“It’s really not. You have 30 seconds. Get out or I sic Victor on you.”
“I will talk and you will listen. Then I will leave you two stubborn boys alone to sort out this mess.” She starts to clear the table, but Dean and Cas are on it before she can. Cas refreshes everyone’s sweet tea and Dean grabs the tin of cookies that lives on her counter.
: Out of here. No. And with Cas, also no.
Can’t be worse than the download speeds out here. Let’s hope the power stays on.
“As I recall, I tried to reach out to you, Dean. You’re the one who shut me out. This is not on me.” His tone is a bit too short to be matter of fact.
Somehow they’ve moved closer while Dean talked. Cas has moved his hand so that he now threads his fingers with Dean.
Jo hands him the bottle and the mike. Guess this is happening now. A chant of “Dean! Dean! Dean!” Rises from the crowd. It would be a rock star moment except that he’s in his own living room and he’s not sure where all these people came from. Small was the MO for this year. Forty people in his living room is not small.
But all he wishes for is Cas. He knows the angel won’t show up. Dean is good enough for heaven, but not good enough for happily ever after. Fairytales are just a bunch of shit anyway. Forever is going to be a long time, but for now it’s a beautiful sunny day by a lake.
Within seconds, Dean hears the familiar flutter of wings and feels the warmth of a body standing directly behind him.  If he’s told him once, he’d told him a thousand times.
“I thought you were dessert,” Cas says.
Dean loses the power of speech for a moment. From those strong legs, to the muscular chest, and every single thing in between. He’s usually self-assured and cocky. He’s got a line for this.
“Oh, I’m nearly naked at school a lot. Our last school production featured mostly nude dancers.”
The GPS in his car chirps that there is only 10 miles to go until the exit. He prays that the transport truck he’s using as a beacon doesn’t leave the highway before then. It’s the only thing showing him where the road is. A notification of a text on his console. A disembodied female voice reads:
Sweetie, any guy that turns down your dick is doing himself a disservice. What’s his email, I’ll send him a few of our commemorative videos, so he can see for himself what he’s given up…
Dean just pulls Cas close. “How is Michael cheating on you your fault?”
And Dean happily obliges, humming into the kiss, when Cas decides to flip him over. “I think I was the one making promises earlier. Let me take care of you.”
“I have nothing left to say to him,” Cas says to Missouri. “I am heading back to the cabin.” He goes to stand but Missouri, busy getting lunch on the table, stops and puts her hand on his shoulder.
“Fuck off. No.”
He clears his throat. “Sam and I found this spell, we’re struggling with the Enochian. I was hoping you could help,” Dean says.
“You said you’d never come back.”
“Got a new queen-sized bed too, memory foam. It’s awesome.” Dean winks as he says it.
“Well, it is amazing. Sam has tried from the same recipe, it’s good but not this.”
“Yes, I know I need to call you both more often. You have better things to do than to listen to my whining.”
“I was thinking an omelet but now that you mention it.”
“Missouri, he doesn’t love me. Not the way I loved him.”
“Shame Doris Day is more your type,” is all Cas manages as a comeback.
“I’ll take a look in the morning, see if there is any damage.”
It’s friendly and a bit intimate. If he himself brushes against Dean once or twice, he doesn’t make too much of the fact that neither one moves away. The warm hand on his lower back as Dean leans forward and whispers that he’s going to step away to help a customer, well, that’s just Dean being polite. Castiel isn’t logging every single incident in his mind for a lonely night.
Cas nods. “You know, man cannot live by jazz alone. Like you, I do listen to other things too.” It’s a bit of a white flag in their battle of the genres.
Dean sits in the chair Cas was in a moment ago. He watches marveling at how graceful and natural Cas looks just standing there staring at Dean. Castiel takes a deep breath and walks onto the stage seeming to gain confidence with every step. He spins around the pole with complete control, and then stops to lean against it. He shoots Dean a come hither stare while slowly undoing his tie, then throws it at Dean and unbuttons the first few buttons of his shirt to reveal firm a hint of firm pecs and what looks to be a tattoo.
They are both silenced by shouting and the door flying open. “Ok, ok, I’ll go. I swear my dick is the longest in the land. Casa Erotica 6 buddy, if you want to see it in action.”  Gabriel hobbled out with his belt unbuckled and his shirt untucked.
Last in the email is a link to a video. Ramzey has captioned it. “I love looking up at gorgeous men when I suck dick. I miss you, Blue Eyes. Your favourite cocksucker. Ram.”
Cas moves to his left arm and dries that off too. Cas then leans in and whispers in Dean’s ear.“Turn around, let me dry off your back, pants will stay on for now. I promise.”
Or celebrate your renewed friendship by showing him your home movies. He will see the error of his ways. Then wham-bang-thank-you… ummm… sir one thing leads to another.
“Daddyyy….” she says between sobs. “Want zooooomy…. Deeeee…. Daddyyyy… ”
He hears a faint ok.
“Thank you.”
Cas exhales and relaxes back into Dean. Charlie turns her attention back to Gilda.
Cas can’t help but smile. Dean kisses him again. Cas grabs Dean, flips him and presses him to the bed.
“Counting on it,” Cas says.  And they both blush at their own audacity. “Come on, let’s see what Tony’s has to offer.”
“You’re not the one who needs to apologize. I shouldn’t have been looking at  your stuff.” Dean says. “But yeah, this is hard. I miss us.”
“I have no food. Missouri’s Diner for breakfast?”
“I’m going to let you in on a secret, Cas,” Dean says, his now-unbuttoned pants barely sitting on his hips. “I love getting naked for strong, beautiful, dark-haired, blue-eyed men.”
“Cassie darling, I love you. But this kind of tenured position doesn’t come around often. At least try it. There are bound to be new people. And that house is divine with that cute garden. You’ll make friends, you did it with us.”
Dean laughs. “Not the first time I’ve heard that.” Cas makes to grab for the wall. Cas isn’t sure what that means unless there was a world ending apocalypse during his last nap.
Ram, no. Just no.
Happy is really not what Cas is feeling right now.
Home used to be anywhere Dean was.
Dean melts every time he says his name. There is a minute pause just before he speaks Dean’s, as if it’s sacred, as if he’s special.
“I’m studying dance, my last role required nudity for most the show but it wasn’t sexual,” Castiel continues.
“Awww,” Gabe coos. “Look at these two love birds. Shame their won’t be gorgeous children to come from this union.”
With that she gets up.
“This is a real strip club, toots,” Gabriel says not quite kindly. “Let’s see what you got.”
“What do you want? I am glad everyone is happy. I just have to find my own happiness without Cas.”
He finds his way back to the main road. Wandering along the way, he sees the newer cabins, most have been converted to rental properties, the peak season is over and most are empty. He sees a few downed trees, but no serious damage thankfully. Without really thinking about it, he starts to wander down the road a bit towards the old Moseley home. Missouri had been one of the few people he’d opened up to about his home situation. The long fights with his mom, their strict religious upbringing, how much they hated Dean, blaming him for turning Cas gay. Missouri promised him things would get better, and they had. Really, things arebetter now, this is just one blip on the radar. Soon this will be behind him and he can get on with his life. Lost in thought, he doesn’t realize he’s in front of the old home until he’s standing at the foot of her driveway.
Cas always marvels at how much easier it is to lie via text. They exchange a few more pleasantries before signing off. He’s missed Sam. If he’s honest, he’s missed Dean too, but there are too many other emotions tied to it as well, it’s a volatile mix and not one he’s sure he can control — seems tonight will be a test of that.
“Of fucking course,” he mumbles and tries to hold back the tears.
Another long pause, they both seem at a loss for words. One of the things Cas loved about Dean was their ability to just sit and say nothing. But this, this is uncomfortable and ill-fitting. Cas wonders once again if it wouldn’t be better if he just left.
Cas looks at him like he’s not entirely convinced.
“It’s not usually my hands that are the problem, Dean.” Cas winks, full-on winks, and Dean is sure he dies a bit on the spot. Then he watches as Cas’s fine ass walk away. He would sure love to have his hands on that, and the rest of Cas too.
“I knew about the phone. He’s not returning my texts either,” the voice says. “Wish he’d told me about Michael.”
Dean sighs. “You can talk to the animals?”
Dean licks Cas’s finger tip, then takes it into his mouth to suck it gently, releasing it with a pop. Cas hums his approval.
“‘Morning, sunshine…” Dean’s voice rumbles from the foot of the bed. “Sorry, nature called.”
Dean takes a few steps towards him and pushes Cas against the house. He stares at Dean - anger flaring in those blue eyes. Cas licks his lips, Dean loses his resolve and smashes his mouth over Cas’s. It’s rough, hard, all teeth, tongue and passion, just like Dean remembers. Cas seems to be in it, but then Cas gives him a strong shove back.
“Far be it for me to turn an offer like that down.” Damn, he hopes Dean isn’t kidding.
Book two tickets. You’ll need help. For science, of course.The guy can’t be that good looking.
“If it gets any worse, I’m going to have to sell the club to pay for therapy.”
“Charlie! Mr. My-behemoth-of-a-car-metal-head is making up for something. The bigger the wheels the smaller the cock, as they say. Besides, blondes of the female variety are more his type.” Cas nods towards the blonde. He wishes Charlie were wrong about his feelings for Dean, but feels he owes it to himself to protest anyway.
“Cas, I love you. Had you asked, had you said anything, you could have had me too. Always.”
“We should sing our song," Lisa says not taking the hint.
“Dean, come help me get the rest of the stuff from the car?”  And she’s out the door as Dean slips on his shoes.
Dean runs his hand nervously through his hair and pops a cassette into the deck.
“I”m not going to lie though. The last few years have been hard. All the things I wanted to share with you. But I miss you and I’m tired of being angry. And I am still so stupidly, inexplicably in love with you. So yes, Dean. I’ll date you.”
“How is she doing?”
“Hey, I’m ok. I’m sorry.” He grabs Cas’s chin and gently kisses him lips. “I’m so sorry, Cas. Lyra’s mom had an emergency, something about a dumpster fire. And my toddler skills are rusty. Lyra here seems to be getting the better of me.”
“I'd rather bottom to be honest," Dean teases, really this train left professional a few stations back. "I’m sure it’ll be fine, Cas. Gabe said you’ve pretty much got this gig if you want it. And we’ll help with routines.” Dean looks down at the song selection. “This is such a great song choice. Let me see what you can do…” Dean  plugs Cas’s phone into the bluetooth for the room. “Are you ready?”
Sam flat-out refused to speak to Dean until he got clean. Bobby went back to working in the garage full time. Promised Dean he had a job once he got out but ONLY if he sobered up. And yet, Dean couldn’t completely stop drinking. For the first time in his life, Dean felt completely and totally alone. And, wow, it was scary and it sucked. Really the only person he wanted to talk to was Cas. But Cas was fucking some gorgeous men up in another country because of him. And how do you call up your former best friend and say “
Some things never change. I miss you all already.
Dean laughs. “Sure. I hear the new Captain Marvel is pretty great.”
“Listen, it’s dumb and I don’t want to make work awkward,” Dean stammers. “Just go without me.”
“Shouldn’t be. You’re hard to forget.” Dean gives a sad smile. “That’s probably a topic best left for another time.”
“You’ve had two fucking years, and you want more time! Time for what, Dean? You know, for months, I blamed myself for what happened. But I’ve come to realize that this is not entirely my fault. That night, yes. The ghosting, that was all you. I tried to apologize, tried to explain, you wouldn’t let me. So yeah, whatever Dean, by all means, when you’re ready. I thought I meant something to you, and for some stupid reason, I loved you. But apparently, I am no more to you than any other piece of ass you picked up in a bar.”
And it suddenly becomes clear, Charlie was right. Not wanting to lose this chance before Dean changes his mind, Cas decides he’s going to have to have to use actual words to make Dean understands.
Without Dean and his goddamn “Hey, let’s just be friends” routine. Like anyone believes it’s what Dean wants. How dare Dean judge him for moving on and trying new things. Why the hell wouldn’t he? Dean kicked him out of his clubhouse, and so what if he’s found new people to play with, why wouldn’t people like Ramzey want to be with him. And if Dean thinks Cas is ashamed of anything that went on with Ramzey he’s got another thing coming. There was good money to be made being Ram’s co-star, not that he’d want to this full time but the extra cash, he saved enough to put a down-payment on a house.
There are a variety of empty booze bottles strewn throughout the room, the living room and the kitchen. It is, quite frankly, a mess.
“It’s a nice one.”
Cas is pretty sure he’s dead and this is the afterlife. Dean lowers himself down slowly, Cas gently massaging his legs. It’s so warm inside Dean and tight. Slowly Dean starts to move. Up and down, deep grinds. And Cas is slowly losing his mind. Dean reaches down and starts to stroke himself.
“You’re here now and, not gonna lie, you smell good. You smell…”  like everything I want. “Why don’t you sit down. I can ask you my usual questions, helps get the conversation started.”
Surrounded by the lake on two sides, the cabin was initially a small one-room hut with a fold out bed, and a kitchenette where Bobby would hang out to get some fishing in. When John disappeared, leaving him the boys, an expansion was needed if they were to spend any time up there. Bobby enlisted kids to help with the expansion. Dean had asked if Cas could come along and it was a magic summer rebuilding the place. Cas remembers the boys sharing a tent, while Bobby slept in whatever spot of the cabin was still remotely habitable. They’d stay up late telling ghost stories, and making improbable plans for the future, falling asleep mid-sentence.
He takes a deep breath, makes sure his hoodie is clean this time, and makes his way to the small kitchen to find Dean putting away his groceries.
Dean walks into the kitchen, holding a young human with bright blonde hair, and great big smile.
And Cas loses the power of speech, as Dean smirks and pulls Cas in close, their lips barely touching. It’s a tease and Cas has had enough of that. He puts down the fork pulls Dean into him. Dean smiles into it. It’s tender and tentative, just delicate touches. Eyes close as they let the moment overtake them. Cas can taste the dessert on Dean’s lips, he licks it gently. The kiss deepens, passion under the surface.
Cas blocks out the bad 80s hair rock playing in the store and continues his work cataloguing and pricing albums from the Cain collection -- 50,000 albums, mostly jazz all in impeccable condition. He’s looking at a rare Miles Davis and Quincy Jones recording of Porgy and Bess when he’s interrupted.
“All the times I should have said something but didn’t. I should have told you. All the times, we both spent far too long staring at each other, every single time I wanted to kiss you. I am so sorry I didn’t see it. Didn’t believe it, in you, in us.”
Cas does a quick self-assessment, he’s soaked from the rain, wearing a ratty pair of slightly too big thrift store track pants that ride a bit low on his hips and a threadbare white t-shirt that has a mustard stain on it from trying to eat a Quarter Pounder in the car at lunch. The man who broke his heart is standing there looking like sex on a stick and Cas looks like he’s been dumpster diving.
Cas would punch Dean in his stupid perfect mouth if he were more awake, instead he mutters something akin to yes please. It is too early to be this chipper.
“Dean, Dean, wake up…” Someone was shaking Dean awake and being loud. His head hurt and he wasn’t entirely sure where he was.
of the windshield wipers beating out a base pattern as if it’s a weird rhythm from an infernal metronome warning him to stay away.
“Ok. For Sam,” Cas isn’t sure why he feels the need to say that. “I should go back to the car and get the groceries. The rest can wait until morning.”
“God, I miss you, maybe I’ll email UCLA in the morning.”
“I never thought you’d want to see them. It’s … too much of a reminder that I’m not human. You used to hunt things like me, Dean.”
Truth is Castiel really doesn’t want to be an afterthought. Eight hours of snarky Dean at work is enough for anyone. He is going to go home, pour himself a glass of wine put on the latest Snarky Puppy album and forget about what Dean’s deep rumble of a voice does to him.
Cas had heard the phone the first few times, then had passed out. He came to with a Godzilla-sized headache awakened by Gabe’s Candy Man ringtone. He’d thrown the infernal thing across the room. Sadly, it had left a dent in the wall but hadn’t shattered. Feeling a wee bit guilty about making people worry, he chases the emotion with another swig. But he can still see the last few teeny tiny specks flash before his eyes when he closes them. Heck, he sees little specks of glitter everywhere lately.
“About what?” Dean says looking up.
“Yes, they’re fine staying with us.” Cas is talking to the big cats again. “We can manage for a while. Dean could use a bit of pussy.”
“Oh, one of those albums that makes jazz tolerable,” Dean says with a chuckle. Forget kissing, Cas is now back to thinking up original, creative ways to kill him.
“I … I hope this is a thing, Charlie.” Cas says. “But, we’re taking it slow. Waiting until midnight to seal it with a kiss.”
“It’s just you and me, pup.” Sam says to the dog. Miracle barks. Dean still does not speak dog but he feels better knowing, Sam won’t be alone.
Eddie gets it, but Dean turns it off.
The night was a celebration of the next phases of their lives. Cas had been accepted into school, Dean was taking on Bobby’s shop. A lot of beer, far too much tequila, and somehow they ended up together in the back of an Uber heading back to his place. He’s not sure how it happened or why, but Dean’s mouth was right there, so Cas kissed him. He’d pulled back quickly in shock, worried about what he’d just done, when Dean leaned forward and  kissed him back. Really kissed him — on the lips, with tongue. Cas was surprised, wondered if they were both too drunk to be doing this.
*****
“Boys! Enough shouting! You are both coming in for lunch. Both of you. I am not taking no for an answer.”
“Dean, can I ask you a question?” Oh god here it comes. This year has been a shit show, might as well find out now that Cas doesn’t feel the same way and move on with things.
Dean then slowly works up Cas’s spine, running his hands over Cas’s ribs. It tickles.Cas tries to pull away, but Dean pulls Cas’s arm gently away from his body. Then kisses up his ribs. Fucker is good at this.
Dean bristles and crosses his arms defensively over his chest.
“Castiel, I know you’re in here, you can’t hide from me...” Gabriel shouts even more loudly.
Lost in meal prep, he doesn’t notice Dean approach.
“Tomorrow is going to suck and he’ll want to make some drinking resolutions, but yeah, he’ll live.”
“I’m going back to the cabin. You can finish this by yourself.” Cas makes his way towards the road back to their cabin.
Then in a move he’s not fully sure he understands, Cas pulls Dean onto his lap. Dean is trying really hard to keep it family-friendly and above the belt. But with Cas’s mouth nuzzling on his neck and thoughts of how good that will feel in this inner thighs, Dean is quickly forgetting lot of things, including that there are other people around. He’s making to unbuckle Cas’s belt.
“Is it ok if I touch you?”
It takes a moment for his brain to catch up with what he’s just heard, that album is definitely not beginner jazz. “I’m sorry, we don’t have it. eBay is probably your best bet at this stage,” Cas explains. The customer purchases a rare Mingus bootleg, Pearl Jam’s Riot Act re-issue and oddly, some Daft Punk. Maybe all is not as it seems with Mr. Dean Winchester. But it’s busy and Cas never gets the chance to follow up with Dean.
One last meal  — he can do this. One minute at a time, as Benny says. She’s made mac ‘n cheese, Dean knows it’s incredible. It might be his last conversation ever with Cas, but at least the food will be good.
“I know what I said but I also promised myself, I’d never let you walk away again.” Cas takes a few steps closer to Dean and holds out his hand and leads Dean towards the bed. Once there, Cas kisses Dean gently before he sits on the end of the mattress, Dean standing between his legs.
Dean hands him the coffee. “Black, right?”
Dean looks skeptical, but laughs when he looks at this phone.
“In the flesh…” Dean voice is barely a whisper. “Looks like you started the welcome home party without me.”
“She hated Michael. Said, she could see right through him. He refused to go back there, she burned his eggs.”
Gentlemen? Where?
“Ok.” Dean kisses the top of his head before leaving the bathroom. It feels oddly normal. Cas decides he’s definitely hallucinating. He tries to get up. He’s wobbly, but manages to put the seat down on the toilet to have a little rest before making the long two-foot walk to the sink to brush his teeth.
“Can I?’
“You want to tell me what happened?” Dean whispers while working shampoo into Cas’s hair. It feels divine and Cas could stay right here forever.
How is it, Cas wonders, that it can feel like forever since they’ve last spoken yet it still hurts like it was yesterday. Cas swallows hard, takes a deep breath and forces himself to blink. He wishes all he felt was anger, but he still feels something for Dean. He used to call it love -- now he’s not sure, lust perhaps. One thing is for sure, he call feel himself getting sucked back into Dean’s orbit. Part of him wants to move into Dean’s space, pull him close and kiss the breath out of him, the sane part of him wants to pick up his things and run.
“I’ll assign Charlie in the room, and Victor outside for protection. You’ll never be alone with them.” Charlie and Victor were both mated alphas, they worked for the family business, Winchester Security and were both good friends of Dean’s.
“Ok, this is a terrible idea. Five minutes though, not 10. But if it gets too weird I’m calling it off.”
They finish dessert because it is really that delicious and well, why let free deliciousness go to waste. And if the food gets licked and sucked off fingers and lips, well, it just adds to the experience.
“I've been really tryin', baby
Cas wakes up to a loud thunder clap, then the sound of rain hitting the cabin roof. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees lightning strike across the lake. He hasn’t been asleep for long. Too much on his mind. Dean mostly.
“Thank you.”
“Fuck Cas, I’m sorry…”
“Me too, Sammy. Me too.”
“I told you about Michael. We kissed. You hoped I still wanted you in the morning?”
Cas holds up his hand. He doesn’t want to have this conversation. Not now, preferably not ever. He grabs his coffee.
“But if the right person came along. And it was more than biology, I could be persuaded otherwise. In all honesty, I don’t know many omegas who would have me. I keep odd hours. I don’t follow pop culture. I don’t care about sports or cars. But your smell, Dean. I don’t believe in instant scent bonds or true mates. But you...”
“Deep breath, Winchester. You got this. Act normal. Nothing doing. Just pretend like everything is perfectly normal. Because it is totally completely normal. Things are FINE,” he mumbles to himself. He also knows that shit’s not fine.
“You’re not hurt?” Cas says in disbelief, afraid to move, afraid of the other shoe dropping. Dean looks at him in confusion but slowly Cas sees the pieces falling into place.
He’s not sure why but he follows Sam as his brother loads his lifeless body into the trunk of the Impala. Sam hasn’t stopped crying but they are different tears this time. There is no rage, just acceptance. No cosmic plan to re-arrange. That’s today though, Dean hopes Sam doesn’t try to find some weird mojo to bring him back.
“I brought you a flashlight.” He’ll drop off the flashlight and go to his room. Really. But he still can’t quite bring himself to take that last step into the room.
The banter continues and Cas ends up missing his friends more and convinced that KU was the wrong decision.
“Not far from the truth, but they manifest as feather. They aren’t like bird feathers, really. My grace maintains them, but the scars. I wish you could have seen them 20 years ago.”
There is mumbling he can’t quite make out and then Cas hears the front door close
“I think, you’re seeing something that isn’t there, Charlie. I really need to get back to work.” He likes Charlie, he just wishes she just wasn’t so observant.
“There’s is a re-issue this year, on green vinyl. It’s a bit tacky but I’m sucker for it.” A delicate piano version of O Tannenbaum fills the store and Cas feels his tension drop. “Did you know it was recorded in an afternoon and was the biggest hit of Vince’s career? They are playing at The Old Church this weekend.”
Their eyes lock, Cas is mesmerized. And wow, he isn’t going to last long. Cas grabs Dean’s hair, moans. He thrusts a bit gently. Dean hums while pulling Cas in deeper.
“All killer no filler.” Dean mumbles to himself as the bar of Bon Jovi, “Wanted. Dead or Alive.”  In all it’s cheese, he loves this song.  Out of habit he checks to see when he needs to fill up Baby next. The tank is full.
The air crackles around him and the flutter he’s never really been able to quiet. It takes a moment. Then slowly two large silver and black wings emerge from Cas’s back. One wing is wrapped around Lyra keeping her warm, her tiny hand wrapped around a few of the silver feathers. The other rests behind Dean on the couch.
Baltazar came into his life while he was surfing for a place to rent. Originally from Paris, the art history major had been living in New York City when a two-year teaching contract in Ottawa came up. He was tired of the Big Apple and decided well, Ottawa was kind of the mandarine he needed.  Cas loved how his friend was wild, carefree, and was more than happy to drag him all on his adventures. But more than that, Balt made Cas feel beautiful, sexy and wanted, something he desperately needed after Dean’s rejection.
The toddler swearing and pot clanging has stopped.
It’s open auditions for new dancers at Cerulean, and it’s not exactly going as well as the owners, Gabriel and Balthazar, had planned. Well, Dean supposes, it’s going as well as could be expected when you run the only pansexual strip club in Lawrence, Kansas. It’s a college town, Dean assumed they were going to for the hot grad student demographic, but apparently, it’s just the embodiment of every other stereotype in the American midwest: people who work to hard for way too little looking for a little excitement.
“Me too. It can’t be like it was,” Cas looks wistful. “But we can certainly try to be more civil towards each other. Maybe work towards … friendship.”
Soon his rhythm becomes erratic as he paints Cas’s chest -- and Cas comes a few quick thrusts later.
Of course, he ends up in the kitchen with Cas. Charlie has put on some sort of 1980s Christmas medley while she decorates. God help him he might have to break some things if Wham comes up next. But yeah, there is Cas dancing along to the tunes. How something can be this cute and this sexy at the same time, Dean will never know. It also increases Dean’s panic 1000%.
As one of Cerulean’s best dancers, they make a pretty penny from Dean, and he from them. They have asked Dean if he can spot potential in any of the dancers in exchange for a night off and a a full day’s pay. It had seemed like a good trade off at the time, but now he’s got a headache and
“He told me he tried to call you.”
”Like a month ago.”
“I drove Baby into a tree, just this side of the bridge. I haven’t been back much since then. It was totally my fault, some things were just really hard after you left.”
“But you didn’t have a choice.” Cas just leans in. “Let’s play doctor. All you have to do is open up and say aah.”
“Yes.”
“Dean, will you be my boyfriend?”
Dean didn’t really relish the thought of having alphas audition for him, in fact, he really wasn’t even sure he liked alphas all that much at all except for his mom and his little brother Sam. But his mom had clearly had enough and there wasn’t much he could refuse her. He sighed.
“Hmmmm, not what I expected… first one Ravenclaw. Second one probably Gryffindor. Weird for the Milton clan. They could be fun.”
Moon meows and snuggles in under Dean’s chin. On Dean’s lap are now four slightly bigger kittens apparently Moon is the cat captain. He looks over to see that Cas has ten more in his lap.
“I did.”
“Good morning, sunshine.”
He begins his morning practice. Making a gratitude list in his mind to calm himself: he’s grateful for coffee, a roof over his head, and the fact that he’s not on the interstate. He can also come up with a list of about 20 things he’s upset about. Maybe a list of what is pissing him off the most right now. “Dean, Dean, Dean.”
He then towels down his right arm. Cas rubs Dean’s hand between his own
The ordeal takes a lot of energy, and his body and mind seem to be disconnected. The navy bath mat looks like an inviting glitter-free place to nap. He slides off the toilet with a thud and lays his head on the cool floor tiles. He’s only out for a minute when he hears Dean come rushing in.
Cas takes one last look in the mirror. He’s taken his time in the shower, tidied the scruff on his chin a bit. He grabs his bracelets from the nightstand. He’s not sure why he’s nervous. Last night was amazing, and well, Dean has been sweet and attentive all day. Sex Cas has no issue with, but dating and relationships are kind of new territory.
“Of course, Missouri. Just call.”
In a lesser known part of the land, Gabriel Milton tries to convince his little brother Castiel to go on a speed-date with the magical, beautiful omega who refused to be mated. Gabriel’s not sure about the Winchester-Campbell approach to finding a mate for her son, he’s both shocked and impressed at the audacity of the undertaking. But one thing was for sure, his curiosity was getting the better of him and he wasn’t passing up this opportunity.
“You turned me down.”
“Why Mr. Winchester, are you coming onto me?”
“But you will sit here barely out of sight and watch him go.”
“I love you, Cas.”
Sam must be giving him shit. Lisa was Dean’s fiancée.
“This is good, you know, talking like this. I’ve missed you is all. It’s a lot to ask but could we work on being friends again?” Dean can squash all those romantic urges, really he can.
“Honestly, Cas, it’s fine. Sam and Bobby still have a cold one when I’m around.”
“Dean, you know none of us will let that happen. Please, Dean, I can’t run the business and keep your suitors at bay. Please.”
Guys, he measures up just fine. So what do I wear.
Cas moves to face Dean, the cats move but find new homes some on Dean, some on Cas. Cas places his hands on Dean’s temples. Dean knows to close his eyes. He hears a thunder clap and feels more than sees a flash of light.
Dean nods. Dean is watching him, green eyes never leaving his face. Cas thrusts timidly again, he doesn’t want to hurt Dean and god. Michael hated giving head. It must show on his face. Dean pulls off again, kisses down his length. He doesn’t look like a man who minds this at all.
, thinks Dean.
“Well, the bridge is out and it’s raining. Seems I have nothing but time.” Cas smiles, and Dean stomach does a little flip flop. God, he fucked things up with him, more so than with anyone else. And he wishes he could have him, but if there is one thing John Winchester was right about, it’s that Dean doesn’t get to have what he wants.
He touched his forehead, blood. And his left shoulder hurt. He’s not sure why. He heard the sirens in the distance. Baby’s front end was mangled, and Jody was asking him to blow into a straw, but it was all too much.
With the door to the waiting room open, Dean can overhear the conversation in the next room. This was something new and interesting -- an alpha who didn’t want to be here. There is also a lovely odor wafting in the room. Dean feels calmed. He calls Charlie over. “Tell Victor to make sure that Gryffindor Milton doesn’t leave.”
Cas knows that’s not true, not really. He’d hoped to keep those kinds of recriminations to himself, keep the anger to a minimum. Certainly wasn’t planning on throwing up all these pent-up feelings and giving Dean the satisfaction of knowing he’d hurt him, but now the words seem to hang between them. He almost wishes he could take them back. Almost. He steels himself for the barrage of harsh defensive words that he is sure are coming is way. But they don’t come. Instead, when he looks up at Dean, he sees a man hurting, small and curled in on himself, looking down at the counter.
Dean doesn’t say anything. How can he put into words the years of damage inflicted by all the times his father laid into him for being useless, worthless, and barely good enough to breathe the same air as his little brother. And how when things get difficult, Dean believes every single thing John Fucking Winchester ever told him: Dean doesn’t get to be happy, he’s a fuck up, a pussy, a fag and all those terrible words his dad used to try and “straighten him out.” His dad may have been a drunk and an asshole, but it doesn’t mean he wasn’t right about this.
Or that hug after he saw Cas for the first time in Purgatory. Then Cas pushed him through the gate and stayed behind, Dean felt a lot like this then too.
Lyra looks up at Dean like he’s finally making sense.
“Hey, you’re gorgeous. Besides it’s just me,” Cas had said. “You still ok?”
“Moving for you, dancing like this. All I can think about is falling to my knees and sucking you off…”
“I’m sorry all this happened, Dean.” Cas reaches over and places his hand on Dean’s. Dean hates how good it feels.
“Holy fuck, Cas! What the hell?!”
“Is he hot?” Cas mumbles.
“Hmmm, tempting, but I don’t want you to think I’m easy and put out before the first date.” Dean winks. Cas rolls his eyes.
“Deal. I’ll ask Charlie to set it up. ”
“It’s not bad enough that image is seared into my head. But now, there’s multi-colored glitter all over the house, my house. It got in my hair. I tracked it into my bed – it was everywhere, Dean. I gave away the couch, the table and the rug. It’s been two months, I thought it was gone. But Thursday night, I found a few more pieces.” Cas holds back a sob. “And you know what, it was my fault.”
“In our last conversation at the diner, Sam was telling a story during which he walked in on Bobby in the shower and said he was “in all his glory” and you explained that it meant naked. I assumed you meant the same thing you prayer. Of course, in all my glory, could mean my true visage. but we both know that that would blind you,” he explains clinically. “What do you need Dean?”
Cas looks at Dean like he’s never seen him before. Wait…  what does that mean?
“Cas, you’ve done things to me that should have killed me just last night. When we kissed a minute ago, you healed me. I pray when I’m looking for you. I know you’re not human. But there is only you for me. It’s always been you. And I’d like to see all of you if I could.”
“Dean?”
Dean smiles. His ears turn bright red. “I … um… I feel the same way.”
Benny keeps saying that Dean needs to tell Cas how he feels, but after what happened Dean just can’t see the point. No, Cas should find some nice professor — not too good looking, but kind, who can take care of him the way he deserves. Dean can see them sitting in their living room now, surrounded by books, finishing the New York Times Sunday Crossword before heading off to the farmer’s market. Dean, well, he’d be the man that was Cas’s best friend from school. They’d see each from time to time, get-togethers or when Cas dropped off the car to get fixed. Dean would wipe the grease off his hands, Cas would avoid touching him in his nice suit. They’d take a few moments to catch-up, Cas’s job, Sam’s kids, life at the shop. They’ll end with a promise to get together for dinner, but that wouldn’t happen either. Dean would go home at the end of the day, order a pizza and go to sleep alone, sad and pathetic. Just like he feels.
Not really his fault that his best friend and housemate is the hottest thing since Han Solo boarded the Millennium Falcon. Usually Dean can keep it check. No drooling. Ogling kept at a minimum. At least that’s what he tells himself. Dean has it under control. But a few seconds ago Dean completely lost his fucking mind, he just grabbed Cas’s shirt, and kissed him. On the lips. Rough. Hard. And now Dean is, for lack of a better word, freaking out.
“Daddy!” as a small but surprisingly strong pair of arms wrap around his legs.
“I know all about that, sweetie. Bobby told me. And now you’re back and you’re not sure how to deal with the troubles you’ve been avoiding,” she whispers into his ear.
“Yeah, seems like the thing to go with chili.”
“Castiel! Aren’t you just a sight for sore eyes!”
Realistically, bumping into a very smug Gabe at the grocery store was probably the catalyst. Gabe told him how happy Cas was, how much Cas loved Ottawa, told him about the boyfriends and that he didn’t think Cas was going to want ever coming back. Even showed him some photos, Cas laughing while the man taking the selfie kissed his cheek. And fuck, that guy was gorgeous. Then the next one, dancing with another smoking-hot guy, and blonde this time. On some level Dean was happy for Cas, new town, new people — this convinced Dean he’d done the right thing by ghosting Cas. What he didn’t expect was for it to feel like he’d been kicked in the gut. Dean knew how to numb this feeling: booze and lots of it.
Cas looks up into those green eyes. They both know what Dean is saying. But as they usually do, neither take the first step to start the conversation.
Balt found a four-bedroom house near campus they agreed it was perfect but two more roommates would help them both financially. That’s when Ramzey and Carter entered the picture — two exceptionally hot LA boys who’d also chosen Ottawa for school. Four hot gay men, no commitments to speak, it evolved in what Gabe liked to call a little gay hipster sex commune.
“Wow! Now that sentence really doesn’t make sense,” Steve on the TV says.
: Shot you down?
-----
Cas takes a moment and regains his composure, then he wanders over to his record store home in the jazz section to find Charlie sorting through a newly acquired collection of old soundtracks.  She’s set aside a few that might be of interest to jazz heads. And as he looks them over he tries not to notice that Dean (and his exceptional ass) is now flirting with a beautiful curvy blonde.
Dean tries to give Sam a sign, but it’s harder to move things than he remembered. Dean still isn’t sure what’s supposed to happen now. But he follows as Sam gathers a few things, picks up some salt, a clean white sheet and some wood for the pyre. Once or twice Sam looks over his shoulder.
“Is my nudity distracting you, Dean?”  Castiel asks looking right through Dean, who immediately blushes.
“What do you think she means?” Cas asks.
“What are we, Dean? What do I mean to you? Was I just your big gay experiment?”
“Shame. Why do these animals like you so much?”
“She sure is, but there are some spectacular abs in Black Panther.” Cas gives him a big gummy smile.
“They’ll do for now. I’d like a bit more polish but we can work on that.” Balthazar says.  “There are a few people left on the list but nearing the end. Then we’re done for the day.” Balthazar shrugs with ennui.
Cas’s powers may have waned a bit with all that’s happened, but he can usually feel supernatural entities. Right now he feels nothing at all, it feels just like it did before he left— and that is even more troubling. Maybe apparating here used all his juice, but Dean prayed to him seconds ago, what else could he do but come running.
“Thought I’d help. Sounds like a hell of a long drive to get here. But wow, there’s enough here to feed an army.”
Dean damn near leaps off the hood of the car and into Cas’s arms. Cas catches him easily. Dean is not wasting another second.
Dean’s eyes wander down Cas’s body, stopping at his waist. Cas knows he looks like a drowned rat, feels like one too. He absent-midedly pulls down his t-shirt to cover himself. Cas grabs the towel and his wet shoes and makes his way to his room.
“Well, let’s see smokin’ hot best friend vs. the cheating ex. Tough call or whatever the opposite of that is.”
They both just lie there for a moment, staring. Like they always have, but it’s different.
“Sure sure, let me have a few more shots of whiskey first.”
Then, c'mon, oh, c'mon… Let’s get it on. ”
“Uuuugh, ’s so bright in here. Can you turn off the ...?” Cas asks feebly as he sort points to the ceiling.
Mary rolled her eyes. Her son was given to hyperbole.
“We should let him audition, Zar,” Gabriel says giving Zar a knowing look. “He’s hot. He can dance. He needs the cash after dear Aunt Naomi kicked him out.”
“Hell no, Cas. Gabe smells too sweet, and what he showed me is nothing compared to what I’m feeling through your pants.”
“Just because I am a drunk doesn’t mean I can’t handle a chainsaw.” Dean hadn’t meant for that piece of internal dialogue to make its way out.
Dean makes his first mistake by looking directly at in Cas’s eyes. Damn, guy is intense. Beautiful. Strong. And those lips, Dean really wants to kiss him but this is work, just work. Hot, sexy work, that he’s allowed to enjoy. It’s a perk of the job, right? Like that time Jake Bass came in and gave him a blow job after his shift. Cas is much better looking than Jake, and he wonders what those lips would look like around his cock.
“I went away to school for a few years.”
“Thanks. I know this is difficult. For what it’s worth, I’m sorry about everything. ”
Still, it’s Cas and there’s isn’t much he’d deny him. So he sits on the ground, whimpering a bit as his still tender ass hits the ground.
“Cas birb” she says tiredly.
“No.” Lyra wraps the rocket into a tight hug.
“Cas, this is my new friend Jamie,” Dean says accompanied by the giggly blonde. She is even prettier in person. Cas hates her.
“Help yourself to the tea, there’s lots.”
Dean’s found his confidence, he walks over to Cas. Motions for him to open up the wing again. He runs his hand from Cas’s shoulder blade to the extended tip. Then he cards his fingers down the wing.
: I do need help. Dean decided I needed to be courted, so we are having a date and he’s making me dinner. I don’t know what to wear.
The last half hour until the ball drops crawls by, but Cas never really leaves Dean’s side. They end up on the couch in the living room. Cas has his arm across the back of the couch Dean snuggled in close, hand on Cas’s thigh. It feels normal. Right.
“I am not very eloquent myself at the moment, let me turn off Chet and grab my coat.” He files the information about other men for something to ask about later.
“Hello, Dean. I’m Castiel,” he says in a voice sounds like two packs a day and a pint of whiskey. Dean would be pay money to hear that reading something, anything, like the phone book.
“Cas,” he says to no one at all. “There were a lot of things I wished I’d done differently. Dunno, we talk about the empty and regrets and well… for the most part, we did the best we could with the options given to us at the time. You know, before we realized that everything was pre-written. I hope you’re happy, and maybe I don’t get this, but I need to square some things with you. Closure.”
“Get out.”
“It’s the one thing in my life I’m sure about. The one thing that hasn't changed since we were kids.”
“Definitely Slytherin of the evil variety today, Boss. Do you need a few minutes after all that?”  Charlie provided valuable insight like which Hogwart’s House every alpha would be sorted into and a preview of the alphas to come. “Should I send them away?”
“Possible DUI, could you do blood work? I tried the breathalyzer but he passed out. Could a be a concussion though, not sure.”
“Dean, why are you wearing underwear?”
The misting rain turns to pouring as Cas walks back to the cabin — he doesn’t try to cover himself, just lets himself get wet. He feels the water run down his neck into the jacket. He replays that night two years ago and wonders how it could have been different.
Speaking of Oz, did I ever tell you about my fetish for the Cowardly Lion?
“Dean, please consider this… there aren’t that many eligible alphas in the land. Just give a few the sniff test, I promise it doesn’t mean anything. And I have the family business to run, please. One afternoon a week is all I ask.”
Nothing.
“Thought I might find you here.” Cas jumps in surprise. He must be distracted. Dean was never one for stealth.
Rather than put on a shirt, he grabs the blanket off the bed and heads off the enclosed porch to watch the light show. He settles onto the loveseat thinking back to all the nights he and Dean would sneak onto the porch at night. Sure, Bobby was going to yell at them to be quiet and go to sleep already. Inevitably Dean would steal food from the kitchen: store-bought pie, chips, or cookies that hadn’t been consumed with dinner. Things were so simple then.
Charlie closes the door behind her. Castiel notes that it’s not closed all the way.
Dean is offering him an out. Cas’s brain takes a moment to catch up. He doesn’t want an out, he wants to go on a date with Dean, and it sounds like Dean wants to go on a date with him. Wow.
“On second thought, Cas. You go. Take Kevin or something.”
Dean does.
To no avail, Dean tries to parse that sentence in a way that might make sense. There is no way that this guy naked is anything other than sexual. At almost six feet, and hair that looks like he just rolled out of bed, spectacular physique, the man is pure unadulterated sex. In fact, Dean is sure this guy could walk out on stage fully clothed and stand there unmoving for a song and earn more than Dean does in a week.
He takes a deep breath.
“That can be arranged." Cas dips in for another kiss and giving one last hard thrust into Dean before getting off him. Cas picks up Dean's shirt and throws it at him. "Come on then." Cas starts putting on his pants. Dean crowds him from behind, kissing the back of his neck.
Leaving Kansas allowed Cas the distance he needed to put things in perspective. He met new people, learned to see things in a different way. The program at Saint Paul’s was unique and the fellowship gave him access to some rare Oblate texts. But more than that, the Queer community seemed to welcome him with open arms, something he rarely found in Kansas.
“You didn’t have to do that.”
Ottawa was ok, he knew people who loved the place, he liked it well enough but it never really felt like home. It was certainly much more big city than anywhere he’d ever lived. For the first time, he discovered the joy of anonymity. Finally in a place where he wasn’t Gabriel’s serious cousin, and Dean’s sullen best friend. He had to stand on his own and found that he quite liked it. In the end, going away was a good idea, coming back though, he is still not sure about that.
Dean exaggerates a shudder.
“I want many things, all them involve us, lube and condoms,” Dean says bluntly. “Or we could go the show and I’ll make sure to get us kicked out of the venue. Your call really.”
Measure up… LMAO
Cas barely gets a word in edgewise, but he fills in Garth in on the finer points of Ottawa.
“It is a stack of logs. Pretty sure I can do this even if it’s not up to your standards. It’s just wood, Dean.” Cas stands tall, clearly pissed off, and takes a few steps towards Dean. Dean is taller, but furious Cas is a force to be reckoned with.
It wasn’t all lost, there were moments in his life with Cas where he was happy. Things he’s held onto.
“Cas! Cas, you ok?”
Cas places one of his deliciously long fingers over his lips. “Shhhhhh… Gabe told me I had the job if I wanted it. All I had to do was show up. He said nothing about not taking advantage of his dancers.”
Lyra is now starting to fuss so Cas picks her up. He doesn’t mind children, but the pre-verbal stage does make him nervous. Still, she seems to like him.
“I need to kiss you,” he says by way of explanation.
“‘Raff jump...” as she drops the giraffe onto the floor and tries to wiggle out of Cas’s arms until he finally puts her down.
“Dean, please pass the salad dressing.”
“Wait, let me.” Dean reaches down. Three strokes and Cas comes too. Cas hands Dean a tissue to clean up.
It’s an old oak, likely to have needed cutting down soon anyway. Cas grabs the hand held saw to handle the smaller branches while Dean uses the chainsaw on the bigger bits. Dean removes his rain gear, and notes that Cas has done the same thing. It’s hard wet miserable work. But they are getting it done.
What a drive. Torrential rains, tornado warnings the whole way here. The customs agent took two hours with the car. And today, zero visibility on the Interstate my eight hour drive took 12. I made it to Kansas, but fear I might end up in Oz before the morning.
“God, look at you.” Cas scootches down the bed and beckons Dean in. “Come here.”
“At midnight?”
“God, I wanted to do this last night…” Dean confesses as he runs a finger along the waist of Cas’s sleep pants.
“A week if it stops raining, maybe a bit longer. Depending on when they can get the replacement here.”
Is that a nod?
“To be honest, I wasn’t planning on coming back. There was a contract in Los Angeles. But this one is better, and I wanted to be closer to family. LA has sun and something that seems woefully lacking here. The boys were also moving there.” Cas ends it there.
“Cassie, Cassie, Cassie, some animals moo… come on, you can’t tell me you’re not curious.”
“Today, I wanted to bring you home and find out exactly how flexible you really are.”
There has been a bit of drama. I found the wizard. I get here to find the beast of a vintage Impala, Mr. Run-off-in-a-gay-panic, Dean fucking Winchester. Guess he and his brother failed to work out a schedule.
“Castiel, Angel of the Lord, snookums, lovey dovey hun pooh, where in this marvelous universe are you?” Dean smirks as he  prays.
Nothing. In heaven, as on earth prayers usually go unanswered.
Dean pulls a condom from the box on the nightstand, and the lube. Then Dean looks down a bit embarrassed.
“Love, are you sure that was repulsion? You in a soaking wet t-shirt would turn most men gay. Ramzey isn’t wrong, you are beautiful. Why do you think we always ended up in your bed?”
Dean watches Cas walk away. It’s just a few steps to the bedroom, but the candlelight shows off the strong lines of his back. Dean blows out the candles in the living room, keeping one lit while he grabs two flashlights from the kitchen drawer. Standing by Cas’s door, he knocks three times. Cas is settled under the blankets, Dean can see the sleep pants he was wearing a few moments ago draped over the back of the desk chair.
“If you mean dessert, yes. Otherwise, definitely yes but maybe we want to go somewhere a bit more private.”
“Me too. You can be an infuriatingly good man, sometimes.”
“That’s not me. That’s Ramzey, he’s one of the friends I was telling you about. He pays for school with cam work.” Cas may have been in some of those videos too.
Dean laughs. “You did.”
Cas smiles. “It’s not for everyone. It worked for us. But you know, I’m sure there are people out there I wouldn’t want to share either.”
The end comes more quickly and more stupidly than he’d imagined. A rusted nail, as if whoever the new Death is, has decided that enough is enough. Dying a billion times and surviving, if anything was going stick, it may as well be this. All these ridiculous adventures, and in the end, he dies for good impaled on a piece of rebar. He promised himself he would allow whatever was supposed to happen, happen. He wouldn’t call in any favours. He would just let himself go. He hoped it would be quick.
“One week. Guess, that means I can’t leave either.”
Sam loads up the pick up Cas used to use, and drives off to the spot in the woods where they salted and burned most of a generations of  hunters before them. He washes Dean’s body with a reverence that Dean has never noticed before.  Then wraps it in a white shroud, ties it with natural hemp rope. Just like they've done with everyone around them who has passed before them. Sam cries.
He leaves his coffee unfinished and  gets back in the Impala.
by Miley Cyrus because she’s such an inspiration to me. Like Miley, I too cannot be tamed by convention or what people expect of me,” Becky says with far more passion and conviction than is warranted in this situation.
“Ok. I put your stuff in the big room. I know you like to work overlooking the lake. We changed the windows last summer, put in a bay, the view is amazing.”
“Fine, but you’re paying for dinner.”
After talking to Gabe, Dean picked up a few groceries for the night. His order consisted of frozen pizza, ice cream, a family-size bag of tortilla chips with salsa, topped off with a case of Budweiser. He stopped at the liquor store next door and picked up a few bottles of JD. By a few, he thinks it was four, but it may have been six. What he does remember is Ash, his favourite cashier, asking him if everything was ok. Dean told him to fuck off and mind his own business.
