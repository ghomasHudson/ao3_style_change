"Well, I don't suppose you remember much." The detective looked puzzled, and so John took that as a yes. "You weren't making a lot of sense. Oh - I should warn you, I think Lestrade filmed you on his phone."
"Yes," Sherlock considers, his thinking face ruined by the pallor of skin and the layer of sweat accumulating on his forehead. "I think you may have come up with a good idea for once."
Mycroft had called, asking after his brother and letting John know he'd threatened the staff - despite John telling him that wouldn't be necessary - and John had told him it was under control and he should be home by tomorrow. Satisfied, the older Holmes had left John to the sentimental soothing.
"Not yet," he replies, collapsing onto the sofa. He pulls out his phone, bored. "Lestrade said he has a case-"
Watson would remember this conversation much later, with startling clarity.
"I know," she said kindly. "I do. You think people can't see that you care, but they do. You care in your own way, Sherlock, and that's why you're never alone. You have Lestrade, Mrs Hudson – even my cat Aragog, who you must meet by the way." She laughed brightly, and he thought it might be the first time in a while he'd heard such a luminous sound. "We'll always be there. You'll always have friends in us."
"Duty calls," the doctor sighed, a weary smirk crossing his features. The two stumbled downstairs, coming across a scene that, some how, didn't leave them at all shocked.
"John?"
John knew exactly what he was expecting. He was a doctor, after all, and a bloody good one at that - but that didn't make the scene any more pleasant. Sherlock had transformed into an array of tubes and machines, each completing some bodily function that his "transport" could no longer perform. The most obscene of all was probably the thick tube trailing from his mouth, an ugly, tasteless thing that forced his chest up and back down again. John took his position in the chair by the bed, and slid his fingers inside the detective's, not even thinking twice about how perfectly they fit there.
If John really concentrated, he knew it started a month or so previously. Over his newspaper one evening, he had observed that Sherlock looked pale and drawn, his eyes slightly glassy and fatigued. Now, they had just finished a physically demanding case, and so at first John put it down to exhaustion - but when Sherlock took wearily to his feet, informing John that he in fact did not feel well and was going to lie down, the good doctor knew there was something quite wrong. Sherlock
John scoffed. He'd never met a more ridiculous man in his life.
The next time he saw him was at lunch the next day, scooping mashed potato onto his plate. It was better than the boiled potatoes from the day before, but still didn't quite beat Friday's chips – he shuffled along the queue, ignoring the other student's protests. "I'm beginning to wonder if they know how to cook anything else."
"Wish I'd known," John hissed under his breath, worry lines appearing round his eyes.
"Does your neck hurt?" He sounded panicked now. "Sherlock, no. Wake up.
The disease had spread to his joints, causing a severe arthritis in his hips and knees, and when the doctor attempted to sit him upright, he appeared to be suffering with pain in his back also. He resolved to leave the man where he was, worrying his lip as he covered him with a thicker blanket. When he returned to his bedside with a hot broth, Holmes had no appetite for it, and so Watson set it aside and spent the rest of the morning sitting beside him, reading aloud.
John had to struggle through each and every day; it left him falling apart at the seams.
"Are you sick now?" John queried just before the detective retched, and, rolling his eyes, the doctor held the basin under his chin. Now was not the time for 'I told you so's - those would come later - so instead, the good doctor rubbed circles on his best friend's back while he vomited noisily into the bucket.
Sherlock is silent for a moment, and then he looks his flatmate straight in the eyes. "What else do best friends do?"
Lestrade grasped the handle and jiggled it up and down. "Ah, it's stuck." He yanked on it again, moving his head and peering down the side. "Bolts got caught. We can't open it from in here." He threw himself at it. "No, no way. It opens in the other direction."
"How much did you have to drink?" John asked, concerned. With the way things appeared, he wouldn't be surprised if his friend had contracted alcohol poisoning. His only response was a reflexive swallow. "Sherlock, how much?"
"And they... they uh..." John is transfixed by the startling blue of his flatmate's eyes. Which is ok. Because they're an entire colour spectrum, and so it's normal to be taken aback by such a phenomenon. It means nothing. Until suddenly he isn't enraptured by his eyes anymore, but by his lips, those perfect cupid bow lips that John really shouldn't be staring at...
"What was it?"
He found Molly in the upstairs bedroom. She looked drawn, curled into the spare bedsheets with one hand twisted into the mattress and the other warmed against her cheek. Her under-eyes were dark, her hair limp and unwashed. He was loath to wake her.
"He's starting his radiotherapy this cycle." It was more a statement than a question. "He's scared, Mr. Holmes."
Molly Hooper had only been in her own apartment for twenty-three hours before she was called by Mycroft Holmes.
"She'll make sure I will," Sherlock finished for her, smiling tenderly. "Thank you, doctor."
John stared at him for a few seconds before both he and Greg erupted into laughter. "That may not be completely impossible," he panted, shaking his head, "but
Deciding that perhaps some comfort couldn't hurt, he slipped on his trainers and thrust open the door. Immediately, the stench of vomit assaulted his nostrils, and he paled, trying not to gag himself. Whoever it was had left the bathroom door open, something the other residents would not be happy about once the smell began to pollute their whole floor. Shaking his head, he took a step into the corridor – and froze.
John sighs. "Sherlock, my roommate had mono at university. You're not going to want to go out in a few days."
"Right." Dr. Wilson fumbled with some papers, pulling them upright and stacking them neatly. "Small cell lung cancer at this limited stage is a little easier to treat. Mr. Holmes is not far off the extensive stage, however, so we must move quickly. I intend to proceed with EP, or PE treatment – that is, a combination of the chemotherapy drugs Paraplatin and etoposide – for six, three-week cycles. So that's a day of IV treatment, two days of oral therapy, and then an eighteen-day rest period, six times. On the fourth cycle, I want to include radiotherapy into his regimen. After the six cycles are complete, we will review the case, and move forward from there." He folded his hands smartly, leaning forward across his varnished oak desk to speak to Sherlock directly. His voice melted into something softer. "With this programme, I would estimate that you have a five-year survival rate of approximately thirty percent, Mr. Holmes."
It was a miserable existence, and Watson could not help but feel an intense sympathy. Holmes' wings had been clipped, for lack of better phrase, and the inescapable impression that he could be spending the remainder of his existence incapacitated indoors deeply frustrated him. Not even his violin could soothe him, and before long, the flat fell into a melancholy silence.
And with that, the Inspector pulls the door closed, shrouding the detective in blissful darkness.
"You told me five minutes ago."
feel if he couldn't breathe - but he was interrupted by the pain in his chest. He forced another dose of medicine into his throat, but it was useless - it wouldn't do much if he couldn't inhale it in the first place.
"It's – well, it shouldn't be an issue, really, but... you see –"
"If you don't want to look after me then you can just say!" The detective's shout is ruined by a sudden fit of coughing, and Watson steps in to lift him up and tuck some more pillows behind his back. His gaze softens when he see's Sherlock's eyes watering and his chest heaving, and he perches on the edge of the sofa.
"Sherlock," he shouted back, sighing in relief when he heard the door come loose. It swung open and everyone instinctively leant towards the fresh air. Two paramedics came in with a stretcher and an oxygen mask, and John helped them load him on. Once outside in the sunlight, the detective began blinking, ghostly pale face turning towards his flatmate in confusion.
He wanted to say more. Learn more, about her, about who she was. Ask her how bad the last few weeks have been. Why she felt so obligated to stay, having only been in this part of London shy of six months, and having only known both him and Sherlock for less than that. But it felt futile. He worked amidst crime, had put away the most despicable of degenerates, tracked his boots through blood, watched his own colleagues crumble and corrupt. He was an expert on terror, a scholar when it came to malicious intent. He could hardly begin to comprehend the motives of someone so
The suspicion began when John caught Sherlock staring at a wall for several hours. This was not unusual - the detective often glared pointlessly at a wall for lack of better things to do; or he would simply appear to be watching a wall as he sank into the depths of his mind palace. There was something particular about this moment however, and that was because for a large part of the time he spent vacant, he was also smacking his lips, over and over again.
Mycroft huffed heavily as Sherlock stilled, consoled by his even breathing and lightly flickering eyelids. Since that Christmas, Sherlock had been put on a more aggressive treatment, and it was rare for any of his tonic-clonic seizures to become too serious anymore. The elder Holmes rubbed the detective's shoulder soothingly as he came to, smiling slightly when those blue eyes finally met his own.
Sherlock rolls his eyes, refraining from wincing at the way it aggravates his headache. "Of course you are, I wouldn't expect any more from Scotland Yard."
"You should be in bed," John suggested but, looking at the lidded eyes and weary expression of the detective, he just pushed him into a lying position and threw the nearest blanket over his skinny form. "Get some sleep," John ordered as he went to wash up the bowl, but Sherlock was already gone.
"Contemplation, you say?" Watson sat further upright in his chair, moving his collar about his neck in discomfort. "Of what? There are no cases, Holmes. Even the criminals have postponed their villainy in lieu of the humidity!"
"No time, John," Sherlock interrupts, shooting his doctor a withering look. "Did you not hear me? A man's been murdered." The detective quickens his pace, almost in spite of his friend. "Why do you only ever think of food?"
"I suppose. And to think, the poor fellow passed of the consumption only three years later!" Watson shook his head. "Perhaps he thought it less romantic then."
"With all due respect," Molly said, feeling her hands begin to shake, "I've been present throughout the majority of his treatment. I've gone with him to his intravenous treatments, I've made sure he took his pills at the right time; and I've seen, first-hand, how much Sherlock has struggled. You haven't seen how difficult this has been for him – how awful chemotherapy truly is."
Sherlock gazed at the ceiling. "Satisfactory," he concluded, filling his cup with squash. "My Chemistry course is prestigious enough, and the scenery is pleasant, but..."
"He's right," John agrees, but his voice holds more anger. Massaging his shoulder out of habit, he stares at Sherlock head on. "You could've been in some real danger there Sherlock. If you know you are diabetic, why would you risk skipping a meal that could stop something like this happening?" In reality, John knew why. Sherlock was an idiot who couldn't care less about his health - that would never change. But what John was really angry about, was that Sherlock had never told him. Him, John Watson, a doctor, living under the same roof, and he had been completely unaware about the whole thing.
Except, it wasn't funny.
"Pres, at ten." He shifted where he stood. "You almost ready?"
not sick. Why do you say that?"
"You feel sick?" Sherlock shook his head, frowning. He opened his mouth to say something, lips parted enough to show a row of tiny milk teeth, when a pained gasping noise came instead. His eyes rolled back into his head as he stiffened, and he proceeded to fall sideways and almost completely off the bed if Mycroft hadn't caught him with both arms, and tenderly laid him down on the carpet.
"Your fever went over forty, we had to get it down," John answered, and Sherlock nodded. He then weakly gestured to the three of them.
Sherlock frowns, turning onto his side. "
"Calm," John soothed when the detective started shaking, his teeth gritted. "Some one will come soon." He turned to Greg. "Try opening it from in here again?"
, anymore.
Sherlock shook his head again, but this time it was more desperate. Molly set the water down on the rug just as he brought two shaking hands up to cover his face – and then, to her absolute horror, he began to cry.
"Oh Greg, thank you." Molly held a hand out expectantly for the water. The detective handed it over to her wordlessly, unable to pull his eyes away from the scene in front of him.
"Before you go in," she said in a calm, measured tone, "he has been put on a course of cephalosporins, as well as an aminoglycoside – but we've also inserted a breathing aid, as he showed signs of breathing difficulties upon admission." She seemed to assess each of their reactions to the news. "It is procedure to inform you of the treatments and measures that have been put into place, so that you are not alarmed upon seeing the patient."
"It's my pleasure, really," she said, casting her eyes down to her lap. "I, um. I lost my dad to lung cancer, when I was young. I suppose, in a way, this helps me too. Allows me to do more than I could do back then."
Lestrade checks his watch, frowning. "John should be back in a few hours. I'll be out in the living room," he says, standing in the doorframe. "Just shout if you need me."
Holmes had gone to rest that night, unusually early, but Watson was kept up until dawn by both his own concern and Holmes' consistent hacking in the room below. The moment the morning light crept over the edge of his bedroom, Watson threw his bedclothes aside and, straightening his flannel nightshirt, ventured down to the detective's quarters.
Just under a month later, Sherlock was diagnosed with epilepsy, and was beginning to manage most of his seizures with a mixture of AEDs. A year and a half later, Sherlock received Redbeard for his seventh birthday, a russet Irish setter with long downy ears. He wore a blue clip-on jacket with bright red letters, and became Sherlock's shadow; quiet unless he was minutes from a seizure. His bark essentially became the young detective's lifeline, and their friendship was enough for Sherlock to continue his happy childhood.
John shrugged. "It's Durham culture, right?" He paused. "Or at least, Durham student culture..."
Sherlock seemed indifferent, and clambered unsteadily to his feet. "Where is she?"
The doctor looks up from his blog to see a rather dishevelled Sherlock standing in the doorway. His eyes are red-rimmed and his face as pale as chalk. He sniffs pathetically.
It took everything the medical student had not to run from the ward – he hoped that when his real training began, he wasn't this weak-willed – and he restrained the urge to recoil when he took Sherlock's cool hand in his own. He looked nothing like the man he'd first met, all charm and wit, dark hair curling around alabaster flesh like an ink pen on fresh, thick parchment. His skin seemed almost transparent now, more off-white than the sheets, and his hair limp as it sat plastered to his forehead, which throbbed with fever.
Over the coming weeks, John would notice that Sherlock could become lost on a case, weakly grasping onto a runaway train of thought one too many times and blinking in frustration in the moments in between. He
Lestrade had phoned about the case, but upon hearing of his consulting detective's condition, sent well wishes and joked about Sherlock always somehow landing himself in trouble. John had laughed humourlessly.
"So," she said, switching gear with a lurch, "back to Baker Street?"
, Mycroft had thought as he pressed his lips to Sherlock's once more.
Sherlock starts to shake, falling down onto one knee. The pain is becoming unbearable; he can barely open his eyes, let alone stand up straight. He can hear Anderson screeching in the background, each word a knife twisting in his head- he moans against the side of the sofa, sliding down to the floor.
, when describing either brother, was a grave understatement.
"Yeah, that tends to be how it goes." John stood, patting Sherlock on the shoulder. "Come on, mate. Let's get you back to bed."
"Dr. Watson, please." The good doctor glanced up from his book – a red thing, lined with a gauzy gold leaf – and lifted his greying brow. "My contemplative state is already hindered, by the oppressiveness of this unusual British summertime. I would appreciate your – how should I put this – sympathetic
John nodded, flicking through the files balanced on his knees. There was a small picture of Sherlock attached by a paperclip to a slip of hospital admin - he was sitting up in bed, grinning stupidly (yes, stupidly) and holding up a play pirate. A cannula thread its way across his face and into his nostrils. Mycroft appeared behind the doctor, looking down at the picture. He smiled. "He was five. He didn't make a fuss, actually managed to win over a few of the nurses with his... charms." His brow crept over his eyes, and he pouted. "He always liked pirates. Could never understand why..."
"I assume your's don't include pollen - I've spent a spring with you." He grinned, then. "And you like dogs too much for hair to set it off."
John Watson looked out into the London rain, hating the concrete purgatory that swarmed around them like locusts. He wondered if he'd been through the ten plagues yet, or if tomorrow it would rain hellfire and they'd all perish in the flames.
Sherlock started moving awkwardly, barely in time. He was right – perhaps a slow Monday would have been better suited.
"Oh fuck, Sherlock, no. Don't do this to me." He brought out his phone, already halfway to dialling an ambulance. "Tell me you had your shots. Tell me you weren't a
"You can sleep in the cab."
Sherlock had always been seen as infallible. That is, to most.
"Who?"
It was occupied. Typical.
Sherlock and John are freshers at Durham University. Unfortunately, someone hasn't had their vaccinations.
What confirmed his suspicions, though, was when Mycroft marched his way into 221B, with his younger brother's arm thrown haphazardly over his shoulder.
"About fucking time," he muttered, and then pushed his way into the block, arms practically holding himself together for the shaking. John frowned. It was still early October, and although the temperature up North was considerably lower, it wasn't quite cold enough to be shivering in a Belstaff coat.
"Don't speak, Holmes," he said firmly, grasping his hand tighter. "It is not needed. I know what it is you want to say."
The evening before the fateful crash, Sherlock had his hands pressed into his eyes sockets, his lips adopting a greyish hue and his forehead beaded with sweat. John had Rosie curled on one shoulder, and rocked her back and forth as he watched his best friend clearly struggle with some kind of physical ailment. Eventually, the detective looked up, eyes creased with pain and hands trembling minutely.
When Sherlock was dry and redressed and they were safely back in the sitting room, John handed Sherlock the thermometer while he went to get changed. "Greg, I may have something that will fit you - come upstairs."
"Mr. Holmes?" He looked up, matching Dr. Wilson's expectant gaze. He felt his brother place a hand lightly upon his forearm – a rare, but appreciated, show of affection.
John sighs. "Taking advantage."
And yet, there he sat, for hours and hours on end.
The soldier chuckled. "I'm flushed because I'm wearing
clearly don't think so."
John awoke the next day to a commotion.
One cycle of chemoradiotherapy treatment had been enough to truly wear Sherlock down. A second round was clearly going to be too awful to stand. The first Friday of the cycle – his last day that week of radiotherapy, but his first day of oral EP chemo – saw the younger Holmes slumped in his armchair, orange pills glinting forgotten under the lamplight.
The ride back to Baker Street is relatively quiet, the only sound being Sherlock's short cries every time the cab hits a bump in the road. Lestrade rubs his arm protectively every time the detective's face contorts in pain; he feels incredibly paternal towards the younger man in this moment, as if it is his duty to ensure he gets the best care possible. He closes his eyes against the sudden guilt of calling Sherlock out onto a crime scene. Yet, it couldn't have been his fault- the detective made no sign that he was sick, notoriously stubborn as ever. Except, for some reason, Lestrade feels he should have known anyway.
Upon entering, he found that the curtains were open, and the sheets smoothed. The man himself was sat upright in bed, hands folded over his lap and expression patient. He had the appearance of someone who had been waiting for Watson's arrival. It shocked the doctor enough that his initial reprimand died on his lips, and instead, he woodenly sat himself in the room's complimentary armchair.
John, of course, was a little shocked by the state of the detective. "He's had a seizure," Mycroft quietly explained, and upon seeing John's even more puzzled expression, ended tactfully with, "he has epilepsy."
"No sign of a struggle," Anderson chimes in from behind him, and Sherlock inwardly flinches at the breach in silence. That, and the fact that Anderson's stupidity is inherently annoying.
"Do best friends... do... this?" Sherlock mutters, referring to their current situation. John becomes very aware of how close they have become, and of the fact that his hands were no longer on Sherlock's neck for purely medical purposes. He shakes his head.
As Watson had initially with Holmes' persistent drug use, he withheld himself from protesting, wary once again of crossing the man – even if his conscience did, as before, consistently reproach him for his lack of courage. But the confrontation could not be delayed indefinitely, and as the detective's cough reached its fourth week of harassment, the doctor could no longer supress his natural urge to attend.
John scoffs and tries not to jump the man - he's been marching after him for around nine hours with little sleep or food. He doesn't know how Sherlock survives on so little sustenance; John can feel the energy seeping from his pores by the second.
Sherlock shoots him a glare. "John."
It was then that Holmes, who had been gripping his handkerchief so tightly, broke dear Watson's heart. For as he opened his palm, revealing the horror within, the older man's vision became shrouded in just
"I was reluctant to call you in," Lestrade admits, standing next to him and wringing his hands, a guilty expression plastered onto his face. "It seemed so simple at first, I was sure we could solve it. But the whole team is completely stumped."
"I'm not going back to bed," John snapped, shoving the glass of water into the detective's hands. He sighed. "Try and get some sleep."
Mycroft took a long breath, the air rushing through as static. "He... he won't eat. He hasn't eaten all day. I've tried everything – but, as you know, he's rarely one for negotiation..." Another sigh. "It's just, he's starting his fourth cycle tomorrow. He needs his strength and... I don't know what do when he's like this. He's being difficult. Irrational."
And if John hadn't been so distracted with Rosie at the time, he probably would have noticed the limp, one caused by heavily swollen ankles shoved into smaller socks - a symptom that would have had the doctor calling for a cab to Bart's.
Lestrade shivered.
The trip down to the hospital parking lot was quiet, tentative. Sherlock asked Molly if she'd perhaps like some coffee, and after a polite declination, fell silent. It wasn't until they stood outside of her old blue Toyota that the detective found the words to say.
Sherlock hardly reacted to John's ministrations. He just stared, chest rising and falling in time with his heart rate.
"It must be difficult, seeing Sherlock like this. Going through it again."
It was well into Sherlock's fourteenth year that the table's turned. Mycroft was home from university for Christmas, and the family were drinking rich sherry around a log fire when the younger Holmes noiselessly dismissed himself from the room, red-coated dog in tow. Naturally, the elder followed him. Although he glared bitterly, Sherlock said nothing as he lay himself down, face turned blankly towards the ceiling.
"Okay." She brought the tea to her lips and drank deeply. She closed her eyes, sank slowly into the wooden chair. Greg felt something stir a little in him.
"They open up at seven thirty," Lestrade told John, worried. "That's over an hour away."
But the detective smiled, and swinging his legs out of bed, stood. "Go wash up, Dr. Watson, and I shall meet you in the parlour in but half an hour." He glanced at the grandfather clock in the corner of his room. "We must waste no time."
It did little to stop the detective, however. He stubbornly continued to pursue cases, despite Scotland Yard's pleas that he return to Baker Street and rest; he spent the majority of his waking hours scurrying about the flat, flinging his hands aloft nonsensically and making a downright mess; and, if anything, he must have eaten
. It stunk of bleach.
"Look at the bloody carpet!" Sherlock yells, before regretting the increase in volume. He swallows against a churning nausea.
John nods. "Yes?"
He placed two Tesco bags on the counter, and took a moment to unload his goods into the fridge. He had no trouble, there were no organs or amputations to navigate around. At the end of it, there were just shelves of butter, milk, soup (Tesco's
Sherlock, as most people know, is particularly dismissive of his health. Phrases like "it's just transport," and "there is no time," often pass his articulate lips, much to the frustration of a certain Dr. Watson. However, John would probably be even more concerned if he knew the secret his detective has been keeping from him - as it goes, he remains oblivious.
"Someone could be walking by!"
She hit the gas, and they sped home.
"Neither." John looked tired, and Greg wasn't surprised - he'd been up all day and night caring for his sick best friend. And Sherlock was no ordinary patient.
"I've just got some service!" Sally exclaimed, ecstatic. John didn't acknowledge her at first - Sherlock's grip had slackened, and his breathing wouldn't slow down. He watched in horror as his eyes rolled back into his head and he body went limp against the wall.
"The paints from today," someone says behind the police tape, and John turns to see Anderson. "I already took a sample back. And the body-"
"Yes, you are. I'm a doctor. I can tell you have a
The flat felt hollow; the silence, a clarity. He could hear the fridge whirring lowly throughout the flat, the echo of the tap spitting into the metal sink, the floorboards, breathing. There were three blankets folded neatly on the armchair. The table was clear of vials, burners, books – and

And it wasn't odd that he put on a little extra aftershave. Or that he
I'd also like you to practice high-levels of self-care. Eat regularly – you need to restore your weight. Drink plenty of fluids and replace electrolytes to help sustain your kidneys, which will be at risk of long-term effects following chemo. And..." He flicked through a file, contemplative. "You were a smoker, correct?" Sherlock nodded. "Right. Well, smoking already puts you at risk for stroke, heart disease, chronic bronchitis – you understand. Chemotherapy increases these risks. It is imperative you make healthy lifestyle choices from now on."
Sherlock spat acid and saliva into the bottom of the loo, before resting his head against the cool porcelain lip. "Everything hurts," he mumbled, eyes closed against the roiling of his stomach.
The detective released the breath he didn't realise he'd been holding and did as he was told. He had never been here during a crisis, only when Sherlock had either been sleeping or sitting quietly in the living room, and he struggled to control his trembling hands as he drew his friend a glass of water. For a minute he just stood, gasping a little, unable to turn around, until he heard Molly call him from the bathroom amidst some other, frightful noises.
Irene turned back to look at him, somewhat distracted, but not enough to not plaster a smirk onto her face. "He'll sleep for a few hours. Make sure he doesn't choke on his own vomit. It makes for a very unattractive corpse." She sits on the windowsill, putting her feet up on the ornate bathtub and grasping a cord hanging from the ceiling. The coat slipped off her shoulder flirtatiously.
Sherlock groaned, storming over to kick the opposite wall. It was only a single pace away - the bathroom was quite small. And with all of them crammed in it, it was even smaller.
"Yet?" The detective's voice hit a higher pitch. He cleared his throat. "It's going to get worse...?"
There was a short laugh from the doctor. "How singular of you to say. It is expected from you, I should suppose." He closed his book softly, setting it carefully on the side table. "You are losing your ability to surprise me, Holmes."
On the sixth day, Sherlock finally began to respond to treatment.
He felt ignorant. And he
"Uh, tequila?"
He groaned dismally as the pounding in his head was accompanied by the slamming of a door on its hinges, and the crass slap of feet on linoleum as someone stumbled to the bathroom. He pulled himself upright just as the culprit heaved, and he couldn't help but grimace at the sound of puke hitting the sides of the loo. Someone hadn't had a good night.
, whilst Mycroft, fingers shaking, had gripped Sherlock's nose and pressed his mouth to his little brother's sticky lips, shuddering at the coppery taste of blood as he breathed for his only real friend.
), salad, and other normal, nutritious fares. He put the bread and crackers in the top left cupboard, and thought long and painfully about how this was no longer 221B Baker Street.
For those of you starting university this September, please, please remember to have your meningitis vac.
It's agonisingly long before the results show up, even though everyone present knows barely a minute can have passed. When they do show, both doctor and detective inspector wince. "One point two," Lestrade hisses, and John feels sick. "Lift his head, I'll see if I can wake him up. I need to get this down him." He holds up the juice carton, grimacing. "It may be warm, but it will have to do."
But Sherlock isn't diabetic. Is he?
"Have... to get... out," he gasped, holding on to John's arm. The doctor slid down next to him, his body serving as something to lean on.
The blonde laughed shortly. "I'm John," he called to him just as he stepped into his bedroom.
"I've got a tutorial," he growled harshly, making for the door. "Wishing you a speedy recovery, mate."
John smiled then. "He's a right pain though."
John laughs. "I'm going to edit out the 'for once' bit."
"I can't move," he whispered, pressing a hand weakly to his abdomen. John shook his head.
Silence. Then-
John stares at him for several seconds, before erupting into a fit of laughter. "Oh Sherlock, wow," he pants, wiping his eyes, "that's a good one."
So where was he then?
John hummed, striding out of the room entirely to stand in the kitchen. "Could you bring me a humidifier tomorrow morning? I'm sure you'd get hold of one quicker than I." He looked back at the bedroom door. "I'll see how long this lasts. Then I'll decide if heavy machinery is necessary."
. There was
Sherlock watched him, unsure if he should say it. In a fleeting glance, he assessed John Watson, and then sighed, complacent. "Despite its reputation, Fresher's Week did not help me find a place to fit in."
A nurse intercepted them a few paces before they could reach the ICU. John hadn't even noticed they were almost there, distracted by his musings.
John knew he had weaknesses - cocaine being one, and, of course, his tendency to fall very ill on rare occasions. The doctor was thankful that these were, as said, rare.
"I'm not!"
Sherlock panted, swaying slightly. John almost dropped the chips as he moved to steady him. "I'm fine, John -" another harsh breath, "- just, fine." The detective straightened, heaving in a deeper volume of air before setting his jaw. John stared, bewildered, unsure how to respond. Luckily, Sherlock filled the silence with something like, "must've forgotten to breathe, or, something," and John wanted to point out how ridiculous that was, but Sherlock had already disappeared into the kitchen and scraped two plates together in a rather whimsical fashion.
Sherlock blinked wearily, leaning into John's touch. His gut churned nastily, emitting a loud gurgle. "'M gonna be sick," was the only warning John had before Sherlock lunged for the toilet again. John half-held him upright as he burped wetly, bringing up nothing but spittle.
John laughed, an anxious reflex. "We only walked up one flight of stairs -"
"Ms. Hooper," he whispered, reaching down and gently grasping her shoulder. She shifted, stretching out her legs and squinting up at him. "Hi," he continued on quietly, "I've come to check up on you both."
John closed his eyes, fists clenching. "No reason at all."
"Right," John laughed, feeling silly. "Of course." They moved along in silence, dropping an array of questionable substances onto their plates. "So..." desperate to break the silence, John spoke up. "Other than the excessive potatoes, how are you finding Durham so far?"
Holmes huffed. "My mother adores him. Read him to me as a child. It was practically abuse."
about putting in a little bit of extra effort.
Before I get a ton of questions, this ending was on purpose. I wanted this fic to reflect my experiences at Durham university, especially with the friends I made there. So it's a little abrupt - creative choice. I adjusted some things - you can't actually study medicine at Durham but for the sake of this story, I made up the course. The rest is pretty accurate.
"No, no, no," John looped his arms underneath his friend's, hauling his gangly form upright. "No." He dumped him on top of the sheets, dragging them over his legs in the process. "Back to bed. You'll be fine in the morning. Just sleep."
In just three days, he had grown so thin.
"I said, that was amazing." John looked about the hall, as if profiling another case study for Sherlock's gift. "Can you do it again?"
Sherlock thinks about it. "... Yes."
"Oh Sherlock," John said, putting the bucket down and using the cloth to wipe his mouth. He hated seeing his best friend this way - he was always so strong and arrogant, so smart and annoying. The sympathy John was experiencing for the detective right now was almost overwhelming.
John chuckled and then sighed. "He's been here for a while Sherlock."
There was a collective sigh. "Sherlock," John said, putting his hand on his arm, "It's six thirty AM. No ones out there yet."
"I just told you. I have mono."
It would become apparent, in the following week, that the small improvements in Holmes' demeanour had been deceptive.
"It doesn't look so good, does it Mr Watson?"
"So, what are his chances?" Mycroft had asked, tone clipped – straight to the point, as per usual. "And how can we maximise them?"
"We can try our best to make sure it doesn't," John says, flushing the loo, "but I can't promise anything."
, Sherlock Holmes,
"Jesus. You alright?"
"Because I'm wearing... make up."
"Here." Lestrade offered up the glass of water as Sherlock reached over to flush the evidence away, and the younger man glanced at him gratefully, accepting it with both shaking hands. He sipped it slowly, ignoring the worried stares he was receiving from the other two people in the room.
"Now, John," the older man demands, and then the soldier is frantically turning coat pockets inside out in the quest for a kit John had no idea his flatmate needed. Finally getting lucky he pulls it out and offers it to Lestrade, who nimbly draws out a needle and pricks Sherlock's thumb.
"Might not be anymore," Sherlock counters feebly, wrist gesturing weakly to the tester kit. Lestrade picks it up, studying it.
who came to uni
Donavan frowned. "What's wrong with him?" she sneered. "We know the rooms small, freak. We're the ones trapped in here."
Mycroft was finishing off some menial homework in his room at around seven when he heard it. Sherlock had usually worn himself out by this time and would be softly sleeping in bed, but as the elder Holmes' hand glided over the quadratic functions, he heard a snuffle, and then an almost
from across the flat. Sherlock had thrown his bedroom door into the wall, and was now stumbling unevenly down the hall. Molly stood, knocking over her tea, and stared at Greg for a moment. There was a microsecond of silence, everything suspended, and then suddenly a flurry of movement as the coroner collected herself and rushed from the kitchen.
"I never understood those who saw beauty and intrigue in
It had been eighteen months since Sherlock was unreasonably nonchalant about the state of his health following the, quite plainly, horrific hospital stay - "malnourished, double kidney failure, and frankly, I've been off my tits for weeks!" - and currently, John was living with Sherlock, Rosie almost constantly balanced on one knee and a notepad and pen balanced on the other. The doctor recalled distinctly how Culverton brought his friend almost as close to death as he'd been in previous fiascos - with a little help from the drugs of course - but now there lapsed a feeling of peace over Baker Street, one not quite perfect but, preferable. Things weren't necessarily always good; in fact often, they were quite bad, but John's new motto went something like, "It is what it is." And that was, sometimes, shit. Except, he didn't quite anticipate how shit it could really get, until he woke up to a crash one morning in their flat.
, imitating a dazed, beached fish. The doctor was sure he had never witnessed such odd behaviour before whilst Sherlock pondered, but then again, he was a very odd man.
Sherlock shook his head. "A while back. I was... much younger, early twenties. I've always been careful... after that." John nods, taking a seat. "London is... particularly cold this year. I guess... an average of -2ºC."
It was an hour later that Sherlock started to doubt his theory. Abandoning his experiment, he migrated to the sofa, falling onto it without his usual grace and taking a few deep breaths. It's at this moment that John completed his blog post, clicked 'publish' and clambered downstairs. Groaning internally, the detective hauled himself up, using the back cushions to support himself, and smiled as the doctor came in.
Sherlock swallowed thickly, fidgeting in his chair. His chances were less than a third. Less than a third that he might, if lucky, simply prolong his life; put death out of sight but not out of mind; die, regardless, but with a delay?
Holmes' expression was morose. Watson did his best to let this slip his notice.
"Hello? Yes, we need an ambulance outside ASDA, in Soho. We're trapped in the public toilet, the lock jammed. Could you send a team that would be able to get us out?"
The body has already been removed from the house, but otherwise the crime scene is untouched. Sniffing the air, Sherlock scans the room, noting the sofa's position and the angle of the coffee table.
"No," he answered. "They're not that cruel."
"I'm just -" the brunette hissed through his teeth, sucking in air as if it were sparse. "Catching, my breath -"
Sherlock opened his mouth incredulously to protest, but was interrupted by more hacking coughs, not anticipating the way the dusty air would scrape the back of his throat. John gripped onto his arm, fingers massaging a soothing pattern into his skin. The fit can't have lasted more than a minute or so, but it felt like hours, and soon Sherlock was slumped forward and lifting his inhaler with trembling fingers, breathless.
The blonde stared. "You almost died," he said flatly. There was a heavy moment of silence then, the gentle beeping and humming of machinery the only melody between them. Until –
"Why?" he managed to choke out.
"Swollen tonsils, sweats, chills, sore muscles and fatigue." John is surprised his flatmate is being so compliant. He sighs with relief, glad nausea hadn't made its way onto the list. When Sherlock vomits, it is particularly unpleasant.
(See the end of the chapter for
The older Holmes spoke slowly, staring into the distance. "I should think so."
Spoilers for Season 4. Warning for minor depiction of vomit.
Huffing, the DI follows him in, mechanically closing the blinds, setting the trash can by the bed, and gently laying the sheets over Sherlock's tensed up form. He leaves quickly to fill up a glass with water, which he hands to Sherlock along with a few pills. "Take those. Then you can get some sleep."
Eight minutes, John recalled. He didn't know how to factor in traffic and... shock.
And then, finally: "I may have been mistaken," which Molly supposed was the best apology he could come up with. "I am also concerned, which could be why I came across so... crass."
Sherlock cast his eyes downward and shrugged moodily. "It's not completely impossible."
"What Irene Adler?" He took a step further into the room, worried about Sherlock's clearly fawn-like feet. "She got away. No one saw her." Sherlock threw himself towards the open window, peering through it as if somehow the answers lay on the other side. John almost thought he'd fall through. "She wasn't here, Sherlock." Turning around at breakneck speed, the detective fell onto the floor - John would have said deliberately if he hadn't known any better - and began clawing at the floorboards, searching under the bed for a bloody dominatrix. "What are you...?" He then glanced over at the wardrobe, frowning at the space underneath that. "What?" John wondered if he'd gone completely mad.
Mycroft kept the knowledge of Sherlock's absence seizure to himself for the following week - partially wanting to be sure of his conclusions, and partially hoping he was mistaken. He kept a close eye on the toddler as he pottered about the garden with his wooden sword and paper hat, watching for any signs that his mind may have left him, but as the days went on, it appeared more and more like the event had been a singularity. That was, until Saturday evening came to pass.
John jumped, almost spilling his drink down himself. Mycroft Holmes raised an eyebrow from the door. "How –"
"Mhm," he grunts, leaning against the DI once more. "Tired."
The detective looks up suddenly and shoots Anderson a withering look. "Fine. Just pained by the magnitude of your idiocy."
"To hell with the work!" John shouts, slamming his fist down on the concrete. "Why did you never tell me Sherlock? Why?"
It then he had looked up at his brother with watery eyes. "I haven't had tea yet," he said, curling his hands into fists. "You didn't let me finish!"
There was some shuffling and cursing from inside, and worryingly the smashing of a glass, but eventually Sherlock answered. He looked a little pale and dishevelled, but otherwise, he appeared sharp and graceful as always as he leant against the doorframe, brow creased in confusion.
It's a bit of struggle, but Lestrade eventually gets Sherlock on his feet, one arm flung over the older man's shoulders as they stumble out into the daylight. Groaning, Sherlock swallows hard, causing the Inspector to frown.
"You haven't been attending lectures." John shook his head. "Why?"
A real reification of the nightmare that was
"I'm not," Sherlock spat, voice hoarse and echoing inside the porcelain toilet, "vomiting into a fucking
"Where?"
"It isn't all misery," Dr. Wilson had told him ridiculously, because to Sherlock, it certainly didn't sound like much else. "We've caught it, quite miraculously mind you, just before it could spread to your lymph nodes, trachea, and other organ systems. Over sixty percent of patients are in the extensive stage at initial diagnosis, due to the speed at which SCLC spreads. Your brother must be particularly observant to have caught it so quickly."
John stroked into two fingers, Sherlock's desires were burning and begging for more. So John lowered his head to suck Sherlock’s cock, sliding up and down and let his saliva moistening it. Sherlock opened his mouth and lost his voice, exuding the excitement of lust. Three fingers shuttling inside his body, and being surrounded by the wet warm lips, Sherlock felt like fell into a furnace which made by sweat and heat, completely lost his mind with the dizzy feeling.
This was a small cheap hotel, the walls were thin, and most of the tenants went here for shagging, so when they stayed in silence, would hear clearly the dirty sounds came from the neighbouring rooms. The moans and groans from men and women forced John to remember Sherlock and Adler’s shameless erotic show just had performed in front of him, those images came back to his mind no matter how hard he tried to forget it.
"What happened?" John could not understand their language. "You speak Cantonese?"
They ripped off each other's clothes with the fastest speed, then the two flesh rubbed against each other with kisses and strokes. John's skilful hands teased over Sherlock's sensitive nipples and then slid down to his thighs and turned to Sherlock's buttocks. Sherlock’s prick crushed against John’s, that rubbing made him groaned and stood unsteadily on his feet. John took the opportunity to put Sherlock down on the ground, pressed against him and reached for the bottle of ointment which was inside his bathrobe’s pocket, then slid his fingers with ointment into Sherlock’s delicate buttocks and massaged into his opening which made him crazy. Sherlock gasping while be twisted around by John’s little finger, John kissed Sherlock’s prick while pounding inside him with excitement, that made Sherlock trembled and whimpered. John watching the flush climbing up Sherlock's cheeks, seeing him struggling to breathe under his sweaty messy curls, he just entangled with Sherlock’s body and did not release him while Sherlock seemed struggling backwards to try to get away from John's trapping.
＃　　　　　＃　　　　　＃
Sherlock curled up and leaned against John's back, only wanted to shorten their distance. "Your parents, Mary and kid..."
"Right." Sherlock just looked out the window.
John was stunned and looked at Sherlock, then tried to calm himself down and smiled, "She is fine, she should be celebrating the holiday with my parents at our home."
"Oh," Mrs Hudson covered her mouth and knew her spoke the wrong words.
Mycroft held her waist and introduced her to everyone, "Miss Adler."
I was weak, but I still stood up with my own will, only staring at him until he was gone.
Sherlock could not help but think of what happened in the car seat: the gentle hand which was good at caressing, the hunter’s smile, and those incredible blue eyes. He remembered John Watson the stranger. Thought of the feelings when he touched Sherlock, the raising temperature inside the car, the reaction Sherlock made at that moment...
Sherlock reached his hand out for John's short hair, wispered while caressing, "John?"
"Not necessarily," John shrugged. "And they're all dead."
A moment of silence, and then a hesitant female voice sounded, "John? It’s me... "
“Fuck off! You dirty thing son of the bitch, Such a shameless sissy! Don’t even try to sell your service in my restaurant! Get out!”
"Living in Hong Kong but hadn’t tried Chinese food?
“What aspect?”
John struggled hard, breathing and wriggling under him. "Sherlock, don't do that..."
"Will I see you again?" He saw Sherlock's longing.
"You are wearing a British army uniform, obviously stationed here in the military. The destination of the ferry is Hong Kong Island, stationed Victoria barracks as a matter of course. But you have the smell of disinfectants, your clothes despite washed still have residual iodine and red syrup splashed off the old stains, so you are a military doctor. " Sherlock pointed to the rescue package in the car. "This can also be corroborated. British troops generally stationed in the form of a three-year shift in Hong Kong, you are already familiar with things here, so it is not new. But you are still not used to the personnel style here, so it is not too long. If you leave soon, the plight of this place will not be too much in mind. But you are full of grievances, should also stay here for some time. You probably came about a year."
"Yes," Lestrade smiled. "But I didn’t hand over you, am I righteous?"
I hate women. Why was there a widow-dressed woman standing in our living room?
John sighed, thought that he should know Sherlock’s deduction skills would find it out finally, replied whispered, "it’s a gift from my colleagues... for celebrating my promotion..."
Sherlock struggled helplessly, and he did not know what was happening, just felt that John was dedicated to suck his soul, and his body was pushed by John to the bed and stumbled on the bed. John immediately covered him, with his elbows to support himself, staring at Sherlock closely, indulging in his enticing green eyes.
"Oh," the man still stared at the thing under the blanket which kept moving.
"Are you taking drugs again?" Lestrade frowned and folded his arms across his chest. "I do not work with a drug addict."
It was uneasy for him to arrive at the apartment finally, Sherlock found his looks was so awkward that nearly to make him laugh, but he had no time to care about it, he was just anxious to open the door of 221B.
Now only left Sherlock and John sitting side by side on the couch, embarrassment spread for an instant, totally silenced.
"Have you ever been here?" John watched Sherlock absorbing the fresh things around him curiously. "Seems you haven’t."
"maybe I’m old, don’t quite understand the thought of today's young people." Mrs Holmes murmured, "Perhaps the idea of our old-fashioned family is too outdated, still insisting about the traditional etiquette. But I still can’t imagine a gentleman who engaged with a good girl, would leave her in the countryside and went to a big city to have the fun of his own, it’ definitely a big scandal, an irresponsible choose."
My Sherlock is still alive.
In order to save you, I must go back!
Then Sherlock stared wide-eyed at John, stopped breathing - he felt how John's cock penetrated into him inch by inch; he felt how hot and hard were John, and how his shape was fit in his body.
The new nurse named Mary looks very cheerful and talkative, quite smart too. Do you like her? When I was playing the crossword puzzle this morning, she commented me with your tone suddenly, which surprised me. I just thought, if I met her before I had known you, maybe I would like her. Maybe because I can capture on her, a little bit of your shadow?
When Sherlock returned to Barts to pack his stuff, met Mike again in the corridor.
"I like you more." Under John's gaze, Sherlock felt that there was not enough oxygen in the room - his eyes could show that Sherlock was the most interesting and worthwhile thing in the world. "Do you often do this? Follow a stranger back to their place?"
"I'm glad that you're back..." Sherlock's voice trembled, clinging John and his lips pressing against John's back. "It's fortunately that you are alive..."
"You can leave us at the junction," John said to the driver.
"Sherlock Holmes!"
"Yeah, I’m not the John Watson..."
Mrs Holmes was so angry that she just picked up her handbag and ran away from the embarrassment, Mycroft eyed John with a guilty expression and chased his mother out. And then only left John who sat alone here and continued to watch the erotic show which performed and directed by Sherlock.
He hung the clean clothes, pulled the shower curtains, opened the shower-heads, and let the water slide down from the top to his body. This moment was the time he spent in his mind palace.
"Ok."
"More unbearable," Victor swallowed. "My student card is gone. I just went to the School General Office to do the replacement. But there was no one there. I was surprised to hear the strange noise coming from the Vice-Chancellor's Office."
"But it is unfair," John hissed, "it's unfair to you," he looked at Sherlock, "Why should I give up you if I care about them?" John hysterically flapped his lips, "The fact is I love you, only you."
"But you have told my brother about my whereabouts and situation?" Sherlock questioned.
"You can call it my apartment," said John, brought Sherlock upstairs to a shabby building. "Other soldiers like clubs, love hotels, something like that, but I more concern about cleanness and privacy."
"John Watson." John politely held out his hand and shook her, but Sherlock noticed that he had a suspicious expression.
John felt a moist feeling behind his back, right at where Sherlock leaning against him - did Sherlock cry? No, it was impossible. Even when they broke up, he did not cry, but laugh instead...
"Sherlock, the school bell rang, don’t be late on the first day!" They were walking on the corridor from the dormitory to the classroom building, Victor holding two copies of notes and textbooks, urging Sherlock to walk faster.
Seems real but illogical when you think about it, just like dreams.
He even followed John's steps into his car. Car speeding on the highway, all of a sudden they did not know what to say, had to let a little embarrassment of silence spread.
“As you said, I am now full of grievances, just want to go for a ride. I hope you could come with me.”
Then the winter holiday ended, Sherlock returned to continue his classes and home works and tests, and be forced by Mycroft to giving his mother an apology, and had a dinner with the so-called “family”.
"Your wife is cheating on you, has been cheating on you a long time ago, and she secretly had sexual relationships with so many people, not just one.”
Sherlock stroked his own ring thoughtfully.
Sherlock sneered and snorted.
It was a car ferry. Sherlock stepped out of a crowded minibus crammed full of passengers. Not far behind, parked with a black car, the door opened, a young officer wearing uniforms came down.
Sherlock pushed him away at the last minute, stepped back. "Don't know what you mean." He clenched his fist, did not dare to imagine that he had almost kissed a person other than John - that thought had let his stomach aching twisted, feeling so sick and disgusted.
#              #              #
Without you, I am nothing.
It is a difficult time, but I only think about such nonsensical things.
Sherlock hearing it wide-eyed, did not understand why the lawmaker could be so illogical that equated the relationship between two humans to animal sex? Although he always knew how his schoolmates avoided talking about homosexuals, he just thought it was caused by the social atmosphere, that it crossed the line of the moralist’s restricted areas. He only thought serious items such as adultery, underage sex, sex at improper places (such as school), prostitution, indecent and rape, those things would be considered as crimes. He never knew such an unreasonable law had always existed in his homeland and its colonies.
"Um... it's just an experiment," Sherlock smirked. "You know I like experiments." He winked at John and disappeared at the door.
He thought Victor was not here because the lamp was not lit, and he thought Victor would be embarrassed to see him so Victor would try to avoid him. But he heard some noise coming from the neighbouring bed, some friction sound of the fabrics, and some heavy rapid breaths - a total of two breathing sounds, two people were lying in that bed.
When discovering the uncontrolled bleeding, it was no longer can be saved.
"John?" Sherlock whispered softly, his voice still drowsy.
John laughed. He looked around carefully and then used his most light voice, "Have you heard the crime of gross indecency?"
"Dr. Watson will also be my assistant and working partner." Sherlock went on to announce.
Pound. A strange noise from the window.
"I am just telling the truth, and that's all logical."
"They all thought I was dead," John said. "My parents had lost their eldest son not long ago, then Mary left, they became so lonely that their daughter-in-law and grandson in Hong Kong were their only sustenance. Then the war started, the most important thing for them was to ask about our news, but the telegram from Hong Kong informed them of my death, Mary and grandson were whereabouts unknown... They were old, couldn't stand it, both got sick. After seriously ill for half a year, they passed away one after another. "
Sherlock swallowed John's whole prick and then spat it out, letting the saliva shine and glow on it. He carefully licked its root and balls, kissed it everywhere, and then swallowed it again and used his tongue to caress it. John was trembling and breathing hard under Sherlock's blowjob. Sherlock held on John's hips and kept doing the blowjob for him, deepening each time and gradually accelerating.
I need you, Sherlock.
Sherlock came out of bed barefoot, stepped forwards to John; John also turned and got down from the window ledge, reached for Sherlock. Two weeks separated made them missing each other so much, so now they both greedy staring at each other, as if the pole of the magnet could not be avoided by the other side of the deep attraction, Sherlock stretched out his hand and touched John's face, stroked over his eyes bags, cheekbones and lips softly. John clasped Sherlock's face in his hands and pulled him into a vortex-like kiss, sadness, missed, destruction, sweetness, craving and bitter, those huge amounts of feelings exported at a sudden, they drowned, Sherlock would be died by drowning.
Like this time, after Sherlock bathed, he received the internal reports from Lestrade and could take a look at the testimony, and he quickly found the suspicious place. So the two went to the crime scene and the Scotland Yard and finally found the suspect within a police group.
"Rio, just slow down a bit..." Victor’s hoarse voice came from the sheets.
"Um, frankly, I am quite enjoying the life of a bachelor because it’s freer, and the single person barracks are not as bad as you thought.”
"Ouch..." Sherlock intolerably twisted, while John kept thrusting him by his fingers, he could not bear it, "John... be quick..."
"But I promised him first, and he said he has a flatmate too," Mrs Hudson continued.
"Seems you like them very much." Sherlock ridiculed with a smirk.
"It's fun," Sherlock showed a glamorous smile. "I need your medical knowledge."
"He's sick," John tried to explain, "I'm a doctor, so he sleeps here to accommodate me take care of him."
Someone who could get along with him - Sherlock thought of John for granted. Sharing an apartment with John had used to be his dream, but... Sherlock shook his head - no more daydreaming, his teenage days had passed for a long time, and now John's son would be soon a youngster... Yes, John was already someone's husband and father. Sherlock was saddened at the thought that they had not seen each other for years.
I knew something wrong, gone wrong from the deep part, my brain going wrong.
Lacked your extraordinary mind, I lost our exciting adventures. Nothing happened to me.
"It's Mycroft," Sherlock announced calmly.
My life is not the same.
Sherlock did not fall asleep at all. He got up quickly, put on the dressing gown, walking fast towards the source of the sound.
"Did you buy it?"
Sherlock froze, his brain had too much information shouting at the time, in complete chaos. Then he turned with horror and stared at John's back, so scared that he did not make any sound in time. "Wait..." He almost lost his voice because of the scare. "Wait!"
John frowned at Sherlock, but Sherlock just looked away.
Sherlock was unable to resist, tightly closed his eyes - John, he imagined that was John in front of him, his John... long-lost caress, long-lost kiss, beloved John, I was yours...
“By deduction.”
On the road, they did not speak, but both mouths curved up.
Sherlock knew what he wanted to say so quickly covered his mouth, "don’t say."
"I wouldn't let you down, my love." James smiled and came closer. Sherlock felt only shaky. "Chasing is fun. We have a lifetime to play this game, our love game."
"What?" John and Lestrade surprised in unison, both turned to Sherlock.
Sherlock made a detour to the backyard. He liked to sneak into the janitor’s house while the janitor was gone to work, so he could read the fresh newspaper from there and see whether there were any interesting murders that would cure his boredom. The class was too boring, he already learned all the things in the textbooks by himself. Besides, his seat was on the corner of the classroom, no one would notice his absent, Victor always took attendance for him.
"Hush~" but someone bothered him.
A short, bold, smart blond, has a nasty secret connection with Mycroft - ah, that's familiar!
Sherlock just stared at the dark ceiling, and said in a hateful voice, "go on."
Busy Mycroft was diligent and almighty, working all day long. Although lived with him, Sherlock might not see him once in a day. As clever as Sherlock, he learned to be independent early on, learned to solve his own problems, because his guardian is always absent when he needed him. He also thought his precocious would earn a little appreciation from his brother. But when his brother appeared, he never showed a little friendly attitude, always only severely criticized and reprimanded, as if Sherlock was an idiot. No matter how perfect Sherlock performed, in his sage brother's eyes, those were just kindergarten student’s nonsense. He just could not do anything to catch up with Mycroft’s standards.
"You don’t live in barracks?" Sherlock answered himself. "Oh, I see, it’s your private love hotel. Indeed, It's more convenient."
"Even you have forgotten my looks and my name by then."
#              #              #
At the dinner party, Mrs Holmes treated Mycroft and Adler very kindly, but she just ignored Sherlock and John, no matter how John tried to show his decent sense of humour to please her, the response was cold and unwelcoming. Even unsophisticated as Sherlock, he knew what they were doing and they were done it for a special purpose - his family wanted to humiliate John Watson, made him felt embarrassment for his behaviour as had a taboo relationship with their little son; and Mycroft was demonstrating as a good example to Sherlock how to become a decent and elegant adult.
When John was ready, they lay sideways side by side, Sherlock clung to John from his back and pushed - Sherlock entered John, felt that he was inside him now, and that feeling shocked both of them - Although John was a bisexual veteran, he never do this with any other person, but let Sherlock have his first time, be the first who penetrated him. This was a remarkable event for both of them.
＃　　　　　＃　　　　　＃
"Rare." Sherlock tried to recall. "I think no. Most people are dull, they do boring things all the time, all are idiots."
"Ah, I see!" She hurried down the stairs.
"Captain Watson." Mycroft introduced with a nasty smirk, "Sherlock's friend in Hong Kong."
"You decided to rent it before you get in and have a look?" Mrs Hudson found it strange.
Sherlock performed very normally this day, better than normal, his mother and brother even considering he was a good boy now.
John collapsed on Sherlock, they both still wearing their pyjamas which had stuck to the fluid.
"Sherlock, this gentleman wants to rent this apartment too, are you sure you will move in with your flatmate?" Mrs Hudson asked.
I really want to hear the sarcastic comments by your own mouth.
Sherlock deadly wanted to push James over, James bit his lip finally, made him taste the blood. "Leave me alone!" Sherlock's voice revealed extreme disgust, wiping his lips and breathing heavily.
Sherlock's eyes widened, totally did not understand, but he could not find a word with his mouth opened.
"Greg Lestrade." He reached out to John with a polite smile.
Pedestrians became more and much more complex than in daytime while most were going to visit the red light district, visitors included traffickers, pawns, sailors, soldiers, rich guys and dignitaries, mixed with the smells of smokes, sweats and colognes, made Sherlock frowned. John glanced at his expression, smiled and held his hand, pulled him out of this mess by running away with him.
"Dr Watson, would you like some cookies?" Mrs Hudson greeted her new tenants with tea and snacks.
John gave a wry smile mockingly, "It must scare you."
A familiar feeling. Sherlock shook the eyelashes and remembered their first time.
He had returned to the university to investigate James of mathematics department - James Moriarty was a doctoral student in mathematics, academic excellence, character modest, was also the most popular teaching assistant in the department. He had many fans or said he had lots of believers even outside school because his speech was very moving and exciting, could easily instigate people to embrace him and his beliefs. People admired him, followed him and listened to him, making him and his members just like a religious cult.
"Deduction like a detective investigating cases?" The officer perplexed, he paused and held out his hand. "I forgot to introduce myself, John Watson, although the rest of information you are just right guessed."
"He... lives downstairs," John replied, clutching the blanket which covering Sherlock, and ignored the action Sherlock trying to uncover it.
"Oh."
You ought to laugh. I even started to feel jealous of your fan. When I came and found that she was taking care of you, helping you to clean your face and body, or just only looking at you tenderly, I felt angry like my own position was replaced by someone else.
Thus, goodbye.
Frankly, it was the first time I agreed with Harry.
#              #              #
"I only bring a willing person into my bed." John led Sherlock across a road, turned into an alley, left the lively main street. "l took you here, just happened to be my room nearby."
"I love you too," John said softly, his lips sticking to Sherlock's cheek, a kiss of him as each word was spat out.
The ambulance crew arrived very quickly and sent him to the hospital.
My John, is back.
When Lestrade came back from work, Sherlock decided to talk to him. He coughed to draw his attention.
"I'm looking for Sherlock Holmes," said the man, frowning at the uplifting human shape beside John. "Do you know where he is?"
His hand stroked his cock tentatively, feeling more pleasure, but at the same time desired more. He stroked himself with those two’s panting rhythm, and closed his eyes to pretend that it was John. He would let John touch him, let him caress his private parts, let him give himself a thrill of excitement, let him release his hidden desires...
"Sorry... " Sherlock faintly heard a whisper, felt the warmth of being clinging, and then re-fell into sleep.
"Do you love her?" Sherlock asked curiously, chewing his mouthful of food.
When the family and friends were sat down, dinner started, there was a weird atmosphere between them, seemed to be kindness but actually was cold. Sherlock observing every detail - especially about Miss Adler's silk stockings, the brand of her cigarettes and the colour of her lipstick, he had already seen these things and he remembered in where - in a minute, his mouth curled up and stared at Mycroft with a smirk. Mycroft frowned.
"Hey, Mummy." Sherlock reluctantly kissed his mother's face.
So lazily they lay together, let the passage of time, none of them wanted to get up nor separate - they separated too long, no one wanted to leave again while the other one now was so close.
"You could, if you could pass the entrance exam, you could even get a scholarship, then your study fee would be paid by somebody."
Everything about Magnussen and Appledore is very real but unlikely in a way. Did I imagine a super version mind palace just because I have a similar one? A transparent screen floating on the air (playing the video which I rushing to John, who was under the fire at that moment) - is that invention exists? It's impossible to wear the hospital gown and walk with the IV bag to the restaurant to meet Magnussen, everyone knows that the hospital gown can't cover patient's back, which makes you like naked wearing it. (Although I'd only weared a sheet in Buckingham Palace)
James was holding Sherlock's cheek, staring at his Cupid's bow, whispered while he almost touched those lips, "Don't you want to stand on the other side? Obviously, hell is more fun than heaven..." James continued to lean forward, his lips almost rubbed Sherlock's. Sherlock slipped back slightly and crashed into James's arm which waited behind him. "The only rule here is the violation of the rules..." Sherlock looked at James confused, his lips parted slightly, and James was fascinated by it and leant forward again, getting closer to the pair of seductive lips...
Sherlock stood over Jennifer Wilson’s body. The consulting detective had already read from Wilson’s body what she needed to make her deductions. Now she was checking the weather on her phone.
Sherlock told the shorter woman, “Helping me make a point,” in complete honesty.
Sherlock told herself to have patience. That this
Mycroft ignored Watson’s questions. “Do you see the camera, Doctor Watson?”
John stepped over to Sherlock. Quietly she asked the consulting detective, “What am I doing here?”
again.
Which John clearly didn’t grasp and was evident when she asked, “Of the message?”
Sherlock ignored the DI and turned to John. “Doctor Watson, what do you think?”
John arrives back at 221b and texts a murderer....
There was nothing Mycroft could do about how Sherlock treated her own body, nothing beyond getting Sherlock the best specialist and treatment when Sherlock -
“I don't wanna sit down.” The tone had its own subtle taunt in it. Especially when she said, “And it’s John.
Mycroft instructed Watson to: “Watch.” She moved the camera as far as it would go in the other direction. Then, she said, “There is another camera on the building opposite you. Do you see it?”
in the privacy of her office - and hoped Sherlock took a shower after, or at least washed her hands. But that hope might have been a lost cause considering that Mycroft knew her sister had such appalling notions about taking care of her “transport” during a case.
It was unfortunate that her ancestor had for some unknown reason decided to attach himself to a skull. Not that appearing to talk to thin air had ever done Sherlock any favors for her reputation either. Not that Sherlock cared much about her reputation, of course, not as long as she was allowed to solve interesting cases.
It wasn’t until Sherlock fished the bright pink suitcase out of the skip and went to turn to John with a triumphant grin that she realized that she left the ex-Army doctor back at the crime scene. How inconvenient that psychosomatic limp was proving to be. Sherlock
Squeeee! Next chapter there will be Johnlock flirting!
“You know, I've got a phone. I mean, very clever and all that, but...er...you could just phone me. On my phone.”
“What does anyone want? Information.”
bring. Though that was part of it too….
With Sherlock elsewhere digging through skips, Mycroft grimaced at the thought, it was the opportune moment to have a private conversation with the former Army doctor.
John’s phone trilled again. This time, however, John did not check the text. It would be Sherlock, of course.
Mycroft sighed. She knew her Sherlock was finally working on that dreadful serial killer case. The one that made it look like the victims were committing suicides. Clever that. Clever, but dreadful.
“But who’re you?”
For the first time Sherlock wished a spirit had stayed after being murdered. Most of the time the spirits of murder victims were barely more helpful than the corpses they left behind. Mostly spirits were as tedious in death as they were in life, but at least they were more helpful than
Mycroft’s face fell. She couldn’t help it. She felt like she was losing control of the situation. She had originally planned to offer John money, but Mycroft had decided against it when it became obvious to her that it would be an insult to the proud soldier.
Also! we will be canon divergent after A Study in Pink. Then we'll get canon divergent for realzies! and truly see banshee and medium/psychic stuff
With Watson on her way it was now time to finish setting the stage.
Sherlock made a face. “Of course she's not. She's from out of town, though. Intended to stay in London for one night... before returning home to Cardiff. So far, so obvious.”
Mycroft felt something inside of herself become lighter. Her smile became a little more real. Only a touch. “You don't seem very afraid.”
Johanna.”
“There is a security camera on the building to your left. Do you see it?”
Sherlock mentally waved the thoughts aside. She had more important things to think about. Like catching a serial killer.
Ah, yes, the psychosomatic limp. Sherlock was going to have to do something about that if John was going to stick around. And Sherlock very much wanted her to stick around. More than for what the future
John stared into her eyes, searching. Searching for what Sherlock wasn’t sure. Sincerity perhaps? Why wouldn’t Sherlock be sincere in her request for the shorter woman’s help? If it was anyone else Sherlock wouldn’t never had made the request. John Watson on the other hand? Yes. There was something about the woman that drew Sherlock to her. Something more than the potential of Absalon’s predictive message. The consulting detective just couldn’t quite put her finger on it. She needed more data.
“What about the message, though?” Lestrade prodded.
“Not yet,” John replied. When she looked up at Mycroft again the civil servant could see that the soldier’s mask was down. There was a twinkle in those blue eyes that had not been there a moment before. Nor had there been that little turn up at one corner of John’s mouth. “I would really like to know who you are. You’ve not said yet.”
, it's German for revenge. She could be trying to tell us something….”
With everything finally set Mycroft leaned casually on her umbrella and waited.
A puzzle Mycroft thought she wouldn’t mind deciphering.
“Not much,” Sherlock replied honestly. Wilson clearly decided that since she had left her message that she didn’t need to stick around until her murder was solved.
Sherlock shouldn’t have felt so...disappointed. Absalon had said…. And John had said….
Mycroft's pov. And the conversation goes a little different.
John’s brows furrowed. “Sorry – obvious?”
Sherlock raised an expectant brow at John. “Well?”
Something flickered across John’s face before Mycroft could read it; then it settled into...ah...fearlessness. A soldier’s face.  “You don't seem very frightening,” John told the civil servant.
“I suppose not, compared to bullets,” Mycroft acknowledged. She was about to say more when she saw with her telesthesia that Sherlock was back at Baker Street. Mycroft’s time alone with John was running out.
The civil servant didn’t wait for a response and simply turned the camera the other direction. Now none of the cameras at that location had Watson in their sights.
Thankfully, her attention was diverted to her computer screen where Mycroft saw live CCTV footage of Johanna “John” Watson leaving the house where the most recent serial “suicide” had been found.
Again dialogue, for the most part, comes from the episode.
Or not.
the woman Absalon had referred to, the one that was essential to Sherlock’s own future.  “Of the body. You're a medical woman.”
Mycroft smiled, one reserved for bureaucrats, ambassadors, and heads of governments, and replied, “When one is avoiding the attention of Sherlock Holmes, one learns to be discreet, hence this place.” When Johanna still had not taken the seat Mycroft said, in a lightly provoking manner, “The leg must be hurting you. Sit down.”
Even so, Mycroft was forced to pause a moment when she saw what her little sister was up to.
“Why am I here?” John asked.
Mycroft sat comfortably against the leather seats of the luxury sedan as she watched the CCTV footage on the laptop resting on her lap. On her mobile phone she rang phone after phone along the side of the street Johanna Watson was limping along.
“Am I boring you?” Mycroft asked.
Whatever John saw in Sherlock’s eyes must have satisfied her because John gave her a small nod before stepping over to the corpse and awkwardly getting down to her knees beside it.
Mycroft saw Sherlock in her mind’s eye. She was texting. Mycroft did not need to see the text to know it was to John.
Mycroft ignored that question as well. “Get into the car, Doctor Watson,” she instructed. When Watson hesitated she told her, “I would make some sort of threat, but I'm sure your situation is quite clear to you.”
As a child Sherlock had thought that Absalon’s words mere nonsense. ...but if she had listened maybe she could have prevented Victor Trevor from dying…. Sherlock had promised herself that she would
John still looked confused. Ah. She was unsure why she was being addressed despite her eagerness to come with Sherlock to the crime scene. Which was just silly! This was the reason Sherlock asked John to come with her to the crime scene - for her medical opinion!
Mycroft  directed the camera to turn away before saying, “And finally, at the top of the building on your right.”
“As I said, a concerned party.”
Mycroft refused to think along those lines a second more.
John leaned forward, just a bit. “That isn’t to say that I wouldn’t still have a name from you.” And then John winked. “Then, just maybe, there could be something between us, and if I occasionally bring up my brilliant but daft flatmate...well...then that would be no one else’s business, would it?”
It was a clear as crystal to Mycroft that the shorter woman had spent a number of years in the Army, had been discharged though not because of the limp (psychosomatic or otherwise), was a tidy person by nature, was low on funds, and was clearly not afraid of the situation she had found herself in. Most interesting of all was the fact that although Watson was clearly an adrenaline junkie and ex-soldier she draped herself in drab apparel. Just what kind of facade was Watson trying to present with her ill fitting overly large lumpy jumper and utilitarian shoes?
Mycroft sent a message to Andino to go pick up Sherlock’s prospective new flatmate, and another for a driver for herself.
Mycroft was at her desk going over everything that could be found on one Johanna Hamish Watson when her telesthesia showed her what Sherlock was to. The view of Sherlock was only in her mind’s eye so the civil servant had no trouble continuing with her work. Multitasking was like breathing for Mycroft.
So whatever Sherlock was looking for in skips must have to do with her case. Mycroft allowed herself to sigh, once more - after all, she
By the third phone that Mycroft called Johanna seemed to finally catch on. Mycroft watched as she turned part way towards one of the shops. Someone that was not Johanna attempted to answer the phone and Mycroft hung up, only to ring the payphone a few feet in front of Johanna. The phone Mycroft had already calculated that Johanna would answer.
Watson’s stride, like much of the rest of her, contradicted itself. She did not so much as limp over to where Mycroft stood, but marched over while putting weight on the cane. If Mycroft had not had someone procure Watson’s therapist's notes - not that she needed the notes to tell her so - or any other part of the file on Watson Mycroft could read all of the information from the former army doctor herself. From the psychosomatic limp to the untrimmed pixie haircut to the years out of date clothing the woman wore.
“Yeah, I can tell,” John said dryly and a roll of her eyes. “What do you want of me, and why should I give it to you?”
John took the phone out, checked it, and put it back in her pocket unanswered.
“So she's German?” Lestrade asked, clearly prodding for information.
“I would prefer this stays between us,” Mycroft implored. “Sherlock and I used to be close,” she grimaced a the memory of how things used to be oh so long ago. “Sadly, not anymore. Sherlock might take it badly….” Mycroft purposefully trailed off.
