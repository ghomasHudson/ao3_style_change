"Oh, god." Shaun whispered, shuddering openly, shifting on his knees and spreading himself out for John. "Oh god. You're really going to do it? John? Will you fuck me afterwards?"
When he had no reply, he grimaced sulkily and yanked the duvet up over his head, cocooning himself into a grumpy, chilly lump under the covers.
He was surprised when John grabbed his hot, sweaty hand, jerking him out of his sulk. Sherlock looked down to where John was clasping his palm, surprised John would want to be so open about their being...together. Not that he was complaining. After learning about John's previous relationship...Sherlock felt that he needed a bit of openness.
Kudos to the damned creature for managing to camouflage itself somewhere despite being eye-wateringly bright orange and blue, a stark warning of its toxic nature. He would be less worried if he wasn’t so painfully aware of the paper cut on Mrs. Hudson’s finger, and the scalpel nick on his own palm, two devastatingly effective paths for the fast-acting poison to take.
John clenched his teeth hard, forehead distorted by anguished crinkles, and as Sherlock's blood-hot release flooded inside him, he struggled on the absolute brink of his own orgasm, body juddering in need. "Sherl...Sherl...more...
He spun the short army doctor around and dragged his trousers down to his thighs. John didn't even hesitate, bracing his hands against the wall and pushing his arse out naughtily.
"Yes..." He whispered, managing to collapse onto his side with John still inside him. He felt inordinately shattered, drained, and he shivered from over-exertion. With one shaky hand, he plucked a tissue from the bedside table and pretended to clean himself of non-existent ejaculate.
John smiled. He wasn't surprised Sherlock had something of a hair trigger. The man had been denying his body's urges for decades and everything they did was new for him. It probably shouldn't have, but being able to take Sherlock apart with just a few moves turned John on.
In the muted midday quiescence, the wet sound of John pushing two fingers inside himself was a fiendishly deafening tease for the detective.
. Fuck...me..." Each nudge against his prostate ramped his arousal, already at a hot, blinding level, even higher and Sherlock whined.
Sherlock dropped his violin and bow on the sofa before greedily grabbing John's face once more and kissing him mercilessly. After a few seconds, he pulled back, gifting John with his crinkly grin, before leaning in close to his doctor's ear. "What should I wear?" he asked in a despicably sumptuous baritone murmur.
The park was at almost peak capacity, too, with numerous groups of people lounging about, sunbathing, picnicking on the browning grass - families, couples, groups of students, a few solitary people clutching books or kindles (and that was just in the immediate vicinity. The park was huge). People were traversing the terrain, dogs running around, children splashing in the fountain and screaming with youthful joy.  And John was letting them all know, in a very obvious way, that he and Sherlock were together.
"What the fuck do you think you're doing?" He hissed while Sherlock rolled his eyes up at him and kept sucking, swirling his tongue around John's thickening cock.
"John? JOHN!" Sherlock bellowed, before twiddling his three-day-old rose in his fingers, scowling when a wilted petal fell off and fluttered to the carpet. He strode to the bathroom door and banged on it. "YOU KILLED MY ROSE!"
Warm semen jetted across the back of John's hand and dripped down over onto his stomach. He worked Sherlock through what seemed a rather painful but relieving climax, whispering words of encouragement in his ear all the while.
"No...I mean..." Sherlock struggled to find the words, edging closer to John. "I got to have you...then."
Of course he did. Sherlock relaxed infinitesimally as John grabbed his hand and gave it a squeeze, his own posture relaxing as he beamed at his mother. "Mum. This is Sherlock Holmes-"
Sherlock glanced down at John’s hand, swiftly panting through his nose and the flush on his face spread like wild fire down his neck, over his chest, and even stretched out to weave between his contracting abdominal muscles. He seemed highly sensitive to such a simple touch and John felt him grow and harden so fast under his hand that Sherlock lay back, looking dizzy.
a favour." He winked and dragged the speechless detective off through grimy puddles to their destination.
Sherlock growled. He felt as if he were burning up from the inside out with sexual frustration. He didn't understand it. John hadn't wanked or had sex in 3 weeks- a record for him as far as Sherlock knew- and he seemed totally...fine. Oh, he glanced at Sherlock's lips every now and then, but for the most part he was fine. Not like Sherlock. He sometimes felt as if a stiff breeze blowing in the right direction would make him come. He was aroused by the most random of things: the way John buttered his toast, when he bit his lip, tongue poking out as he read the newspaper, crossing his legs, sighing...
"Who knows what you do to me under the covers. Having your wicked way with me. And you won't even cuddle me in daylight. I feel so used," John teased, snuggling back into Sherlock's torso and sighing at the exuberant warmth of his body.
“…You look…like you’ve been doing something you shouldn’t have,” John replied carefully. “What have you taken?”
Stars exploded behind his eyelids as John's dick grazed along his prostate, making his cock jerk frantically and leak out a stream of pre-come which spooled down onto John's stomach.
"If I needed advice on a woman I would have asked a man, considering your experience with them sexually is limited to a teenage fumble after a fifth of your father's rum. No, Molly," he said slowly, leaning forward and forcing her eyes to lock on to his. "Sex with a man."
"Lick it up." John demanded as he pulled out of Shaun, gazing down at the tepid gush of his own semen that dribbled from his lover's body. Loving this new side of John, Shaun didn't even hesitate before obeying, turning abruptly and licking at the cooling semen under his knees . He curled his tongue in his mouth, relishing the flavor and the stinging hurts that were starting to make their presence known.
Sherlock slowed his hand to a tortuous, snail-pace. "Slow enough?" he murmured, his wrist bumping awkwardly against John's in the dark as they both attempted to maintain their rhythms on each other's shafts.
He felt the irresistible urge to peel away his bandage and gape at his wound like a mindless tourist, circumnavigating the violent history narrated by the marks on his body. Waiting for the bath to fill, he took a couple of anchoring inhales, which in fact did nothing to make him feel better. Christ. He was going to have to share a bed with Sherlock later. While he was like that: damaged. One of the best, most intense (if, most dysfunctional) relationships he had ever had, had ended this way…and now, John suspected...it was going to happen all over again.
John dragged Shaun down roughly into his arms, laying them face-to-face. "You've got time for me now, right?" He grinned dangerously, snaking a hand teasingly over Shaun's sensitive groin.
." John moaned, closing his eyes, still cradling himself gingerly, and Sherlock moved further away, swallowing self-consciously. He felt like an utter failure. He'd been so sure of himself, so confident, that he'd be able to pleasure John this way-
"Your...excessive use of flattering adjectives is...nice," Sherlock laughed nervously before it suddenly occurred to him that he should repay the compliments. "You...you're toned...and strong, and your skin is like saffron."
"You forgot something, Sherl," John murmured, nibbling on his bottom lip as he watched his pale, beautiful, and wonderfully nude detective drag himself inelegantly out of the bed.
John very carefully inserted his digits until all his knuckles were nearly enveloped, anxious about forcing himself further, despite what Shaun wanted. He was about to express a doctorly warning, in anticipation of his small (yet still-substantial) fist, breaching the other man. The words were short-circuited, however, by the shocking, brand-new, numbing sensation of Shaun clenching around his fingers.
John stood up on fiercely protesting legs, and groaned, heading to the bedroom door in order to go and make some rejuvenating tea. He paused on the threshold to glance back at the shagged-out detective.
"You don't deserve it," John leaned forward, biting down sharply on his detective's nipple for his own selfish satisfaction. After soaking up Sherlock's deep grunt of pleasure, he spoke again. "Want to hear what happened after that?"
John struggled but dutifully swallowed the slick, liquid bolus of come and saliva. Surprisingly, it tasted less unpleasant than he remembered.
. I want to mark you up, Sherlock. I want to suck bruises into your skin and bite and let everyone know you're mine now." He let Sherlock feel the very briefest tease of teeth- Sherlock tensed, body sluggishly coming online- but John moved on, licking at his collarbone.
Sherlock blinked, desperately trying to work a way out of this. "I'm...I'm sorry I wasn't there to prevent your being stabbed." He began haltingly, hoping John knew he was sincere. "And I know it was my fault, but I'll do everything I can to speed along your recovery."
"I don't think he knows as much as he lets on," said Greg with a small smile, trying to find the words to comfort his friend. "I don't think he's ever really been in a relationship either. Maybe he does feel something and is trying to show it, or maybe he's saying what he thinks he's supposed to say."
Lestrade gave him a look before rolling his eyes. "All right. Come on. It's through that door back there. Watch your feet- there's glass everywhere."
They quickly spied John's friends who had snagged a large table in the corner and were already drinking and laughing. Sherlock trailed after John, feeling out of place in the crowd, not knowing how to act.
“Yes, Sherlock?” he asked, not looking up. He only raised his gaze briefly when Sherlock stretched, and a few overworked joints popped loudly, and satisfyingly.
John's lips tightened and he made to pull away, so Shaun upped the ante, moving forward and kissing him. He mouthed gently at John's lips, coaxing them to respond and, after a few seconds, when they finally did...he relaxed.
"Fat chance. You would either already know I'm on the way home with your psychic powers, or I'd say it and be
He lingered a bit longer than necessary on Sherlock's crotch, gently rubbing his cock with the soft towel until it was standing at attention, bobbing slightly with every beat of Sherlock's heart. His testicles were drawn up from the cold and John stroked them lovingly, smiling.
Panting only slightly, John tossed Sherlock one of the flannels, the cloth smacking wetly onto his pale skin. Sherlock, his eyes closed, didn't even flinch.
"Fucking lovely." Came the growl against Sherlock's chest. Teeth scraped over sensitive skin and goose bumps broke out beneath the onslaught that was John.
"Seriously, Sherlock, just let it go. Come back to bed." He grasped his hand, tugging Sherlock down the hall. "You haven't come yet, darling. I'll make you feel
"You were...demanding. Did you enjoy that? Did it turn you on, restraining me? Making me work for it?" John's voice was quickly becoming husky.
to be there. Gunther von Hagens in London." Sherlock babbled, taking a deep, shaking breath, his eyes sparkling bright and passionate. "You know, he and he alone invented the technique of plastination- on
"That wasn't all me, love." He said, finishing up with the bed and watching as Sherlock unsuccessfully attempted to scrub semen out of his hair with a flannel.
John huffed out a laugh, easing away from Sherlock's head with an uncharacteristically shy expression, still staring at the mess he'd made of Sherlock's hair. He ran his fingertips over the semen-coated locks, biting his lip to contain his pleased smile.
"Sssh." John blew a stream of air against Sherlock's arse before extending his tongue and licking a delicate stripe along his hole.
“Anything.” John smiled, eyes tracing Sherlock’s still come-covered face. “What’s going through that gorgeous brain of yours?”
Thrilled at the sight of the honest crinkles that creased Sherlock's face when he smiled genuinely, John stroked his hair, before slipping one hand down between them, fondling them both gently through their bottoms whilst maintaining intense eye contact.
"Not really, no." John chuckled, realizing he was going to have to explain this to Sherlock. "It's uh...it's a song people like to play when they're...when they're going to have sex."
"It was open and shut, as I said." Sherlock heard John shift in his seat, knowing he was intrigued. "And it's not that I don't love what we're doing together but...this is a rather odd request."
"So...you wouldn't mind if I..." Sherlock slapped a gentle palm against John's hip, his other hand slowly manhandling John’s cock, thrilling at the little unconscious twitches and throbs that the swollen, mindless flesh made.
“I don’t expect anything, no,” Sherlock huffed as he turned the bedside lamp off, pitching the room into sudden darkness. The bed dipped and bounced as he got into it, the warm gust of air signalling his slumping body, and John vaguely caught sight of Sherlock’s black curls as he turned onto his side to face him. “You’re always getting me things anyway. I thought I should repay the favour.” His tone was light-hearted and low, rumbling in the space between them.
"It's only been, like, three times, honest! In all these months, I swear," Shaun urged, glancing around before deciding it was safe to gently take John's hand. He hadn't been ignorant to John's obvious (if slightly unnerving) desire for physical intimacy and post-coital cuddles and chitchat. He hoped this might sway him.
. That was the key word, Sherlock thought, leaning up and fulfilling the first requirement which was snogging John. John hadn't specified but Sherlock decided to add to the experience and use his tongue, slipping it past John's lips. Sherlock could feel the radiance of John's frustration at not being able to use his dominant left hand, yet enjoyed the slightly off-kilter rummage of an undamaged right hand in his thick, dark curls. John settled into the kiss with total ease and comfort, which soon transcended into eager, rapt arousal and obvious intent, as he pillaged the sweet, cupid's-bow mouth offered to him. Sherlock pulled away from the kiss, panting, and John made a noise of protest.
"Good morning," Sherlock murmured in his hypnotic baritone. "I don't believe we've met." He didn't miss the reflexive, nervous swallow of the other man, and the unnaturally rapid blinks of his eyes. He watched the flicker of Jason's eyes to John, telling and obvious to Sherlock's in its implications, then smirked triumphantly.
Sherlock huffed, his head beginning to ache, and he swore quietly before texting back with clumsy thumbs, rolling his eyes even as he typed.
"This again?" Shaun licked his lips hungrily. "What is it with you and fidelity? All right. Fine. I'll let you shag me - fuck me, bruise me...god,
"God, I am so pissed at you." John breathed, circling his hips and Sherlock cry was muffled by the plug still in his mouth. He bucked against John as John's assault on the delicate bundle of nerves increased. "So...fucking...pissed, Sherlock. You did all of this- today- on purpose. If you'd done it on accident...not meant to...it'd be different." John gave a few more harsh grinds against Sherlock's prostate and groaned at the muffled whimpers he elicited. "But you didn't. You played hurt this morning...because you were planning...God."
"Yes I...he's just..." John consciously lowered his voice, and Sherlock struggled to hear. There was another thirty seconds of inaudible mumblings, before a deep, heavy sigh echoed from beyond the door. The sound of the phone hitting the sofa with a muffled thump was followed by John's footsteps, making his way back to Sherlock's bedroom and Sherlock scrambled away from the door, almost tripping over his own feet in his rush to get back to the bed and appear as if he had been there the entire time. He was in the panicked process of trying to drag the thin bedsheet over his hard-on when the door opened and he promptly flung it away, trying to act casual. He rolled over to face John, his legs adjusted to disguise his arousal. He tried his very best to will away the searing heat in his cheeks that he imagined was blooming in scarlet badges of shame.
"What's wrong?" John held his cock and Sherlock watched it pulse while his own slipped out of John's body, flaccid, in a rush of lube. He shuddered in defeat, avoiding John's eyes and wanting to crawl out of his own skin with embarrassment.
"Sherlock, what is it?" he asked, having to elevate his murmur to a fairly loud question above the noise of the pub. The shell-shocked brunette nodded almost imperceptibly towards the bar.
"I'm not sure...what I'm thinking," Sherlock mumbled. "There are candles...the heat and light are appreciated. I assumed at first that you purchased them because of the temperamental heating in the flat. But wax-based combustibles are considered romantic, so...that's why there are..." his eyes flicked rapidly round the cluttered, golden-gloomed living room, "...twelve of them."
Sherlock, glancing back at John, halted his empty trolley in barely-restrained irritation, practically baring his teeth at his partner. "John! Not now! We need the pineapples. We don't have time to waste on your airy-fairy browsing habit."
Feeling brave, Sherlock licked his lips and wrapped his arm around John's body. A mix of fear and bittersweet sentiment swelled in his throat and made him feel a little breathless at his boldness.
The door was locked. Of course. John shouldered at it, trying to get it open and he heard someone curse inside, then-
“…Sorry?” Sherlock said with a considerably, deep and throaty voice, sounding unsure on what to do as he continued to be caught up in the echoing ripples of what he had experienced.
"Lucky guess. And what does that say about you? That you like it?" John wanted to plump his pillow, but didn't want to create any superfluous noise for fear of missing Sherlock's response.
By the time the kettle had boiled, a small spread had been placed on the table consisting of a delicate tea set and the rest of the cheesecake. Sherlock helped himself to another slice as his landlady set down a tea pot and joined him on the opposite chair.
John's cock throbbed irritably, as if asking him what the hell he was waiting for, and a sleepy little moan from Sherlock as he insistently pressed himself against John made up his mind. He shifted, aligning his hip better to give Sherlock more to rub against, and John reached down, his eyes fixed on Sherlock's body, and started stroking himself.
“And neither will you, presumably. Tired, yeah? Knees weak? Heart still racing a bit? We can give the case a pass, if you're not feeling up to it?"
Digging his fingernails anxiously, and unconsciously into the palms of his hands, Sherlock knelt on the plump mattress as the older man fell with a satisfied groan, onto the bed.
been holding out on us," he grinned, very gently nestling a few fingers in the warm auburn curls between his legs.
It wasn't too far to the pet store, which, according to Sherlock's speedy background check, had unusually late opening hours, sometimes staying open till 9pm. Could be important. He was sifting efficiently through some slim but detailed files in his Mind Palace regarding commercially available hybrid spider breeds, when he was disturbed by a slightly-stubbled kiss on his knuckles, followed by a cheeky sequel on his jaw, accompanied by a soft, smiling huff of breath.
"Don't tell me you're not hard because I can feel that for myself, Sherlock." John said, rolling his hips against the hard ridge of flesh. Sherlock moaned appropriately but went still.
"Yeah, but it could also have gone a lot worse," John noted, finding Sherlock's warm palm in the dark, slotting his fingers around it, and pulling him carefully up and back onto the bed, now bereft of sheets, a cool expanse of usable space. "Come here, lay on top of me," he asked, whilst still sounding commanding.
"Mmm...I can deduce it." Sherlock replied breathlessly, eyes roving over John's body in an invasive perusal. He tugged fruitlessly against his restraints, throat bobbing as he swallowed thickly. The idea of John so manfully defending him against the slander of his co-workers making his chest warm in a way that had nothing to do with sex or arousal.
The army doctor just about held back a dirty giggle, preparing to reply, before his lover strode off with confidence in the direction of the toilets.
Sherlock supposed. It was rather tame, not what he'd been expecting, and with a sinking feeling he realized why: John didn't want to push him. He still thought of Sherlock as breakable.
," he demanded, forcing himself harder inside the man, scratching an itch that seemed reluctant to be sated, feeling his own climax aching to explode.
"Death by sex...there are worse ways to go," John pondered, nuzzling aside dark tendrils of fringe and smooching Sherlock's heated forehead.
John had been so gloriously unpredictable this evening. Sherlock honestly couldn't work out what would happen next and the possibilities had him panting in desire.
"...I don't think 'two seconds' is adequate by anyone’s standards, John. I'll try and make sure to last from now on. I, um...liked it better that way too. It was...stronger," he admitted, his already exertion-stained cheeks colouring even further, glossy with sweat.
Sherlock rolled onto his back so the full force of his pout might be appreciated. He preened inwardly as Mrs. Hudson tutted and picked a few pieces of sawdust out of his glossy black hair. (
"Filthy things." John crawled onto the bed after Sherlock. Sherlock's heart began thundering in his chest. "Utterly wicked things. You'll beg me to stop...but I'll just keep going.”
Sherlock’s toes were already curled, but with John’s slow, provocative touches, they curled tighter, and his ribs expanded in a deep, sharp, audible inhale. It was obvious he was unused to the sensations and also quite obvious he enjoyed them, as his firm erection bounced twice with the canting of his hips. John smirked with satisfaction, and he made sure to watch Sherlock's expression as he probed with his middle finger, inexorably, around and around where he wanted to be. Sherlock's beautiful face seemed an awfully long way away, he had never been with a partner so tall, and so he had a hard time fixating on his features when a concave, trembling stomach, rust-coloured nipples and twitching limbs were vying for his attention.
John muffled his cry against Sherlock's shoulder, shivering as he came, semen splattering against the front of Sherlock's trousers and seeping into the fabric, mingling with the creamy stains already there. Sherlock groaned, watching John tremble and sigh, and dazedly stared down at the complete and utter mess that constituted his trousers. A mess John made worse when he rubbed at the come covering Sherlock's groin, spreading it around and into the fabric with parted lips. Then he blinked and glanced up at Sherlock, looking the slightest bit worried.
John let himself be squeezed in the tight embrace, knowing what Sherlock always needed after they made love. "Properly?" He teased, lightly, kissing him again. "As opposed to improperly?"
"Dull." Sherlock waved a dismissive hand. "Why waste my time helping you with the suitcases when you doing it yourself gets the blood pumping. You're angry- but aroused. Good combination. Excellent things have happened when you were both angry and aroused. I can think of several new things we can try off the top of my head."
“Toast. Now,” John instructed distantly, not looking at Sherlock. He licked his left thumb and forefinger and turned the page of the paper, gaze intent.
Long, strong hands, vaguely slicked with a brief fumbling of lube, as well as an organic dampness of sweat, pawed at John with addendums of sharp fingernails. John grimaced through nicks in his scalp and persistent, noisy, baritone yells of pleasure.
"Almost..." John grunted, working his hand faster over his cock, shivering at how utterly wrecked Sherlock sounded. "Nearly...there...let me hear you, Sherlock. Come...come, Sherlock...don't hold back. .I wanna hear it..."
"What's wrong with you?" Shaun asked after five minutes of cajoling, of dropping blatant hints, and even trying to once grab John through his trousers to get him in the mood. John jerked away, not wanting Shaun to touch him, wondering if he'd even washed his hands after tossing Wilkins off.
Sherlock blinked sluggishly and then took a long inhale, “No. Not that. I don’t normally need that…”
"Can't promise I won't kick you," John warned him, only semi-joking, as he moved towards the far side of Sherlock's bed and pulled back the cover tentatively.
"Sounds wonderful." Sherlock murmured, straightening and blowing the man in the car a cheeky kiss. He revved his engine, peeling the car away from the curb and easily handling it into a parking slot.
!" Sherlock suddenly went entirely still, body taut, muscles corded and trembling, mouth open in a soundless cry-
John tried, and failed, to choke back a giggle as he watched Sherlock peer around, searching for a member of staff like a hunting hawk.
"Want to tell me what this is all about?" He asked, leaning forward so Sherlock could hear him and their conversation would stay private. "I would've thought after solving the case you would've been...happier."
Shaun screamed when he came, disregarding that they needed to be quiet, and his body juddered beneath John, veritably dancing at the end of John's wrist.
And Molly came, biting down on her stuffed bear to contain her cries. Somewhere, in the back of her mind, she apologised to Sigmund as she rode out her bittersweet orgasm. Her fingers quickly eased away her forceful aftershocks and she sobbed, her hips jolting, her long hair sticking to the sweet, frustrated sweat upon her face.
"I...can't believe it." Sherlock quietly admitted. "It doesn't seem real. Why…why would you love me?
Sherlock spent the next thirty minutes, after he had relaxed somewhat and after they'd all ordered and had some wine, giving a long-winded diatribe about the history of kimchi before John tapped him gently on the thigh.
"I'm teasing, Sherlock. Seriously. I don't mind- we'll do whatever you want." He sighed, contented, and Sherlock shuffled back into his embrace, pushing John the tiniest bit closer to the edge of the bed.
His phone dinged and he sighed before snatching it up, flicking it open and expecting to see Mrs. Hudson's usual
, I didn't see it." John laughed, lightening up the room metaphorically, and Sherlock's heart literally.
"Enjoyed that?" John asked, wholly unnecessarily. It was obvious Sherlock had. He nodded just the same, glancing around. They were still alone.
," John murmured in concentration, while he probed very tenderly in the right direction, hooking his finger to graze the man's untouched prostate.
“Yes, but…yes. It’s fine. You’re just the last person in the world I would have down as an animal vigilante.”
Sherlock held him close and between his long, lean legs, hooking one of them across John’s back clumsily, “Prefer…sex?” he asked gauchely, voice vibrating against John’s lips.
"Now...tell us what you know...and we'll make this...quicker." The goon in front of him said, kneeling down to Sherlock's level and giving him a creepy smile. "Tell us...and I won't eat your flesh from your very bones while you're alive."
The doctor grinned, and pushed a soft, questioning kiss against Sherlock’s pliant lips. The detective gave him a tentative smooch back, shivering a little at the voluptuous, wet sound it created.
John gave another glance at his phone, then glanced at the door, making sure it was shut and locked. He sighed. "God, Sherlock. I bet you're so hard right now. You've been wanking ever since I let the flat, haven't you? I can hear it in your voice. I can hear...hear how desperate you are. You're gagging for it, aren't you, love?"
“Oh, yes! Is it still there? How does it feel?" Sherlock asked excitedly, grinning widely, and extending one long hand to John's bare stomach, as if palpating for residual ejaculate.
The way John deleted the history of the sites he visited about city breaks and British seaside getaways was almost adorable, as if he was erasing queries about obscure sexual fetishes and hardcore porn. The fact that he seemed to consider these searches illicit, made Sherlock think that he either wanted to go alone, but didn’t want to upset Sherlock by mentioning that fact just yet, or perhaps that he wanted Sherlock to accompany him, but was understandably afraid of rejection.
John's face was flaming with anger and discomfort, although he felt a vague, distant reassurance as his mates patted him on the back and glared at the now-unwelcome guest.
John cupped his hand and allowed Sherlock to gingerly tip a furry thing into his palms. His eyes widened when he realized-
,” he whispered, words pushed out with each rough and audible exhale. Sherlock was pliant and yielding under John’s hands for several moments, moaning lowly, lasciviously, until he began rocking back into John, his hips angled and his back muscles bundled as he met each of John’s thrusts with his own.
Sherlock had just taken the last bite as Mrs Hudson came rushing into the room, her usually pristine hair now haphazardly ruffled and a dressing gown pulled tight around her body.
With a contortion of his mouth, clearly stifling an answering smile, Sherlock took hold of the offered end, “I greatly dislike you for this. I thought we were through with the crackers at Christmas.”
Sherlock was shamelessly thrilled beyond description at his lover's state. His left hand was planted firmly on John's right thigh, to counter the frankly violent jerks and thrusts the smaller man was attempting, seeking his climax. A climax Sherlock continued to deny him. He'd already had John close three times, taking a giddy, powerful joy each time he pulled away, tasting the salty hint of pre-come on his tongue and realizing John was close...before leaving him wanting.
"Oh...god...just here," John pulled one of Sherlock's hands forcefully to cup his testicles, sobbing out a desperate, almost-alarming cry of need. "Sherlock...Sh...Sh...oh...f..." John's vocal chords rapidly lost their strength, multiple syllables a burden and excess words a drain on shallow breath. He began to pump his hips viciously hard into his own fist, gritting his teeth and throwing his head back.
The brunette’s cat-like eyes flashed wider in a shock of aquamarine. A faint, airless pause followed.
“You don’t seem to get much physical pleasure out of anything. Food, sleep. You don’t like being touched. You don’t date. Stands to reason you wouldn’t waste your time on orgasms.”
Sherlock gritted his teeth, a latent, deep and forceful second climax taunting his muscles and mind. He sobbed in something approaching panic as he lunged and seized John's mouth with his own, snogging inelegantly, dragging John's left hand to his semi-stiff shaft.
John literally screeched when he finally came, jaw clenched, hips pumping wildly as he ejaculated over Sherlock, spurt after spurt landing on Sherlock's chest, shouting out sounds of overwhelming pleasure. Vindictively, John directed his pulsing cock over Sherlock's own cruelly denied cock and balls, dripping his final dribbling pulses of come over the painfully erect shaft tauntingly.
"Not that slow." John grunted, still trying to stroke Sherlock off while at the same time let him do the same. John canted his hips away a bit, trying to make more room on the bed, moving himself precariously close to the edge and only freeing up a few inches of space. Sherlock let out a faint mewl of irritation as he tried to back away and make more room and hit the stone-cold wall. He quickly grabbed John's hip to prevent him falling from the narrow bed and sighed, irritated.
"…...I...he isn't here yet, he's...one moment," The receptionist managed to stutter through her embarrassment and shock, staring at the newly-arrived army doctor as he strode purposefully through the front doors. John caught the dubious, wide-eyed stare directed at him and paused, immediately anxious.
After a beat, Sherlock slowly peered up, looking as overcome and entranced as John felt, and the moment he did was the same moment the skies outside exploded in glittering, flashing, sparklingly, spreading fireworks. The colours, the light, were suddenly all reflected in the widening pupil of Sherlock’s eyes, an ethereal sight. Mesmerising. He smiled at John, lights and colours playing over the planes of his cheeks, and tugged him down within the banging snap of a red, popping firework.
John chuckled openly, his boyish, thin-lipped grin as enticing and enchanting to Sherlock as it had ever been, even when he was teasing him. "Actually, no. She's one of my...what would you call them - conquests?"
Sherlock huffed another minty breath against John’s face in exasperation, “You caught me. That was my plan all along,” He sarcastically drawled as he pulled his hand away. “Why would I do that, John? – You’re being absurd.”
"Oh, lord." Sherlock heard John sigh as he waved back at his parents, faked a cheery smile, and started threading their way over to the table.
," Sherlock exclaimed somewhat deliriously, gnawing on his bottom lip and sighing throatily as, once John had released his hands, he fumbled at John's hips, redundantly pulling them forward once more. John's softened cock slipped out and Sherlock moaned, high and plaintive, his body spasming on the table. John's hands tugged at Sherlock, helping him raise up from the table and turning him around to lean against the side, his legs visibly weak and shaky.
"Not using me." Sherlock protested, realizing he'd said something to upset John but not knowing what. "I enjoyed it too."
"Mm. Yes, perhaps." Sherlock said casually, not wanting to alert John to the danger. There were eight of the youths and only two of them. In a fight...well, the chances wouldn't be good.
"That's right. You only sent me a few pictures. As usual. Because you know that's all I need. Why do you continue to be surprised at my excellence?" Sherlock snapped irritably.
Sherlock appeared instantly ashamed of his lack of experience and leaned back against the mattress, turning his head away, “All right…”
Sherlock humphed, pulling his coat tighter around himself and glancing around the raucous room with a disdainful gaze. Half the patrons already looked drunk and, judging by the game on the televisions, there was enough time left for the rest of them to get smashed as well.
Sherlock, who was standing with his hands on his hips a few feet away from the door, scowled at him, “Why don’t you just go to that blasted party?” he muttered.
"Just...just a bit." Sherlock prodded, needing to see John touch himself, feeling like a starving man he was so desperate to see John orgasm. It felt like an obsession.
The bedroom was a disaster. Half the ceiling had collapsed, chunks of plasterwork and wood littering the bed and floor. Rain streamed in from outside, wetting everything in thick, cold rivulets.
"I..I l-like the way you fuck me." Sherlock stuttered, trying his hand at dirty talk. "It...your cock feels so big inside me."
Grunting, gritting his teeth in concentration, Sherlock writhed on the utter brink of orgasm. "Just...bit...m...more." He pleaded without conscious shame and John moaned, the first noise Sherlock had been able to tear from him in three weeks.
John huffed, rolling his eyes at Sherlock's dramatics. If this had been any other night, he would have rolled over and let Sherlock drag his own drama queen arse into the bed. But John was feeling a bit bad about his rough treatment of his detective earlier, no matter how much they'd both enjoyed it, and, remembering that Sherlock's shoulders were still sore and probably growing sorer by the minute, John abandoned his warm cocoon with a sigh and helped the gelatinous goo of consulting detective onto the bed.
Sherlock allowed himself a brief glance at John, wishing he could just clean up and snuggle in alongside him and share in his languidness. Have John sling an arm around his body and share his heat. Sherlock had never woken up beside anyone before, he'd never even slept with someone, and he wondered what it would be like. Uncomfortable? Crowded? Strangely erotic? Stiflingly hot?
"I love you...when you're on a case and you're...amazing everyone with how brilliant you are...when you turn to look at me because you...want me to be amazed too. God- I'm always amazed by you, Sherlock." John panted, feeling Sherlock's breaths huffing warmly on his shoulder, his fingers digging more and more brutally into John's skin as his pleasure built. "I love you when you're making me angry. Without even knowing what you're doing...and you give me that look because you don't understand. I love you when you're making me angry on purpose...and you know it and I know it...and we both know where it's going to end up but we like to pretend it won't...
The detective flinched, and then cleared his throat, his cheekbones stained a dusky, wet pink. He hesitated for a few moments, and then spoke. "Can we do something…new?"
"Hi, Melissa?...I'm fine, you?...Good, good...The reason I was calling...Well, that was actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I've uh, I've started dating Sherlock-"
Sherlock groaned into wakefulness, sunlight spearing painfully through his eyelids, the peachy London dawn endeavouring to bugger up his already erratic sleeping pattern. He stretched in his bed and spent a few seconds assessing the statistics which, on a daily basis, immediately inundated his sleepy brain. Temperature of the room. The weather outside. Air pressure. His own body's status. The location of John.
"You looked overwhelmed. You looked like you were at breaking point. Utter desperation. There were tears in your eyes. I...I know that's not good, but...it...I liked it," Sherlock admitted quietly. As he finished speaking, he extended one spidery hand to the bedcovers, ready to peel them back and get an eyeful.
John paused with his cock still buried in Sherlock's arse and leaned over, resting his body along Sherlock's. The change in position allowed him to grind his cock, hard and cruelly, against Sherlock's prostate and he did so, drinking in the agonized little moans which built up in Sherlock's throat as he writhed beneath John.
Just as Sherlock's leg muscles began to tense and quake threateningly, John pulled back, biting his bottom lip in muted glee at Sherlock's choked off, agonized moan. Hot sweat was actually making sweet, sumptuous webs of Sherlock's eyelashes now, and his breaths were heavy and rasping enough to make any general practitioner concerned.
"...Was going to say...you make it sound like...like you're head-over-heels," Sherlock huffed, laughing nervously, extending one long-fingered hand to seek hopeful reassurance from his partner.
"Of course. Idiot," John scolded himself gently, snuffling out a little laugh. "Could give it a try, I suppose." There was a questioning tone at the end of the sentence, and he tensed up as he awaited the reply.
…in my…” Sherlock trailed off and rutted madly, overtaken with pleasure as their genitals pushed and rubbed with hot, slick friction. He groaned, fingers clinging to John’s waist, nails cutting into skin, and closed his eyes.
"Think I'll come dry off too." he said, taking Sherlock by the elbow and steering him down the hall, slamming the bathroom door behind them.
He still didn't understand...any of it. John was straight. No, now he was bisexual? He'd never slept with another man, as far as he knew. He slept with as many women as he could, as often as he could. And now, suddenly, he wanted Sherlock? Why? What-?
This would be the first time that John would see him directly after a session. Since they had moved in to 221B a few years ago, Sherlock had only indulged three times, and always when John had been away somewhere. He hadn’t actually planned this eventuality; it was just that the urge always seemed to hit him harder when there was no reason that he should avoid it. His libido seemed to surge into paralysing action the minute his body sensed that it was finally safe for him to surrender to the thing that, for the most part, was happy enough to lay dormant and quiet.
." John grinned, hands encircling Sherlock's calves and slowly bringing them up, forcing Sherlock to bend his legs, the position exposing himself- if not for the briefs. He swallowed thickly, cock giving another throb as John's eyes gazed at him. "I think about fucking you, using my fingers first. God, you were so tight the other night. I imagine the way that'll feel on my cock, me stretching you open. And you'll be so good for me, won't you, Sherlock?" John asked, tilting his head to the side curiously. He knelt up on the bed, aligning himself in a parody of how he would fuck Sherlock, forcing Sherlock to wrap his legs around John's waist and grinding his still soft cock against Sherlock's turgid one.
"You're an idiot, Sherlock," he murmured, aggressively fondling between the detective's legs."...I can't wait to...tell you how wrong you are."
A big, hearfelt thank you to our followers and reviewers! You guys are the best! There will most likely be one more chapter after this one to round it out.
Sherlock grimaced and shooed away the silky, sexless voice back into the fleshy padded room that it been confined to, yet had once again emerged from. Soundproofing the room had proved fruitless. The number of malfunctions in his Mind Palace construction were proving unacceptable, and the sooner he managed to de-sexualise his head, the better.
With ostensible apathy, Sherlock opened the drawer of the dressing table and removed a few items, placing them on the bare mattress beside him. With a slightly vindictive grin, he spread his legs and settled elegant, pale fingers over his chest, teasing with only the faintest tickles.
"T-talk to me." Sherlock commanded in a shaky voice. "Tell me...tell me what you would do to me if you were here."
At the same time as John curled his right index finger in Sherlock's line of sight, silently asking once more for the mobile, his left one did the exact same thing inside him, stroking his prostate affectionately, and the doctor couldn't help but chuckle deeply in his chest, eyes alight and fiendish.
John laughed into the wet kiss and met him with his own erection, hissing raggedly at the sensation, "
"It's logical, John. Look at society's view of the ideal man. It's certainly not me. Even biologically, I'm useless as a virile, reproductive specimen."
"Y-yes." Sherlock managed to gasp and John made a pleased sound, swiping his thumb over the head of Sherlock's cock and using the wetness there to ease the glide of his hand. Sherlock whimpered, tossing his head and clutching his fingers into fists, trying to tamp down on the nonsense noises he wanted to make. John's hand felt amazing. His cock was throbbing and his balls drawing up tight against his body. He felt as if he were suffocating the closer he got to orgasm but was afraid to open his mouth, afraid if he did he would moan and John would laugh...
Sherlock smirked around John's cock gluttonously, and extended two long, pale fingers to tap Morse code into John's twitching thigh.
There were a few soundless, motionless seconds from Sherlock that made John panic that he'd done the wrong thing, before the detective's held breath eased out in one of the most delicious, sensual, unrestrained noises he had ever heard.
Sherlock nibbled his plump bottom lip, eyes a little hazy, before they sharpened as a fiendish idea came to mind. He leaned down to John's ear and whispered in a baritone that made a convulsive shudder work its way down John's spine. "...I did it…all of it…to annoy you. On purpose. And...I did something else, as well."
"Well, I want to make sure you don't." John said firmly. "I want to make sure- as much as I can- that everything's perfect for you. All right?"
Sherlock smirked. "I know what you think of my hair, John. You love it because it's soft and tactile and shiny. You only want me to cut it because of some misguided social rule."
Sherlock cut off his apologetic speech, staring at the white mess decorating him. The idea- walking back through the park and down the busy sidewalks until they got to the hotel, then walking through the lobby and up the stairs to their room...all the while covered in evidence of what he and John had done... It almost made him woozy. It definitely sparked a sizzle of lust in the pit of his stomach. He would need to sort that feeling out later.
"Sherlock! I'm about to head out to meet my parents- Oh, there you are. Thought you were still in bed. I'll be back in -
"Now you." John tugged pointedly at the hem of Sherlock's t-shirt. "Can I see you this time? Please?"
"I refuse to believe my own ejaculate reached my hair." Sherlock said acerbically, then gave John an interested look. "Did it?"
"Kay, Sherlock, we'll get you some sexy pants. Remember you do need PJ's as well, though..." He glanced at the next uppity-looking business woman walking towards them, tapping on her smartphone, and he smirked fiendishly. "Because you ruined all your other ones by coming all over them."
"Is this all right?" John asked, his voice still low, incredibly intimate in the darkness of the flat, and Sherlock shivered, wordlessly nodding. John's fingers slid further down, lower, brushing against the bottom of Sherlock's cock.
cliché. ‘Honey I’m home!’” The teasing, mischievous look on his face was almost overthrown by his heightened arousal, but John caught sight of it nonetheless.
"I...it wasn't too much was it?" Sherlock asked against John's lips. "You enjoyed...which parts, the best? If at all?"
"Thank you." Sherlock said smoothly. "John is very sweet. Of course, he wasn't always that way. But after I told him about the pineapp-"
to have sex with you,” Sherlock mumbled in a dark voice, clambering to mount John once more. The doctor let out a small, struggled exhale from the sudden and considerable weight of Sherlock’s whole body settling on him, before the brunette started gnawing on his bare collarbone.
"Now you." He nodded at the front of John's jeans, tented and strained against the bulge of his erection.
The door to John's bedroom softly swung open and a tall, wraith-like figure slipped inside, shutting the door behind it with a barely discernible click. On the bed, John made a sleepy sound of distress, throwing one arm outside his covers. The dark figure froze, its entire body stiffening. It silently watched John thrash on the bed before he settled, dropping back to sleep again.
"Can I tell you a secret?" Sherlock whispered huskily, hissing with effort, as he began to push a little harder inside his lover, both of his long hands planted possessively on John's hips.
He barely got the words out before Sherlock was tensing, realizing John hadn't come yet, and his warm, moist hand was wrapping around John's sensitive, dripping shaft again, thumb rolling over the wet heat.
Sherlock blushed and lowered his eyes. "I'm sure we are," he agreed, letting John kiss him again and trying but failing to pull his doctor into the bed with him.
Unlike his partner, John didn't feel the urge to rummage through other people's things on a regular basis, and therefore he'd never pried into this particular drawer. Sherlock might have had this toy for years, for all he knew.
in." John stressed, hugging Sherlock tighter to him. The embrace hurt Sherlock's aching ribs but he didn't protest, relishing the contact. "Sherlock...I don't want anything to happen to you. I wasn't there to help and you almost got yourself..."
“ –after all, you’re fairly-well versed in various sexual proclivities, at least in theory if not in practice.”
“I’m a bit out of my depth here, John,” Sherlock reminded him snappishly, looking adorably affronted.
Making use of his most manipulative acting abilities, Sherlock grinned his crinkly grin and ruffled his newly-short, soaked dark curls, before placing a hand on Molly's upper arm, leaning close to her. "I'm sorry for this inconvenience. I wouldn't have asked if I didn't really need help."
"I didn't kill your rose, you bloody idiot!" John's voice came through the door, muffled and irritated. "You forgot to put it in water-"
"My name is your password." Sherlock said abruptly, nibbling on his bottom lip and scooting forward to the edge of the bed. John paused.
"That's hysterical." John agreed, his charming grin lighting up his face as his hand unconsciously squeezed Sherlock's leg, which was starting to tap in agitation. "…Sherlock, you alright, mate?" He asked, eyeing him fondly.
Molly busied herself with the kettle, picking a few flowery-decorated mugs from the cupboard and plucking teabags from the labelled ceramic tins beside the microwave. She jumped and barely restrained a yelp when she felt, more than heard, Sherlock's sultry baritone voice rumbling right beside her ear. The sound wound her up in such a pleasant way she was surprised her hair wasn't spontaneously reverting to its natural ringlets.
John was surprised when Sherlock suddenly emitted a furious, anxious wail, his brows knitted tightly, his beautiful pale throat bobbing with gasping breaths. John smirked helplessly when Sherlock's body jerked, covered with sweat and writhing in desperation.
Sherlock growled, flinging his phone down the sofa. He rubbed at his eyes with the heels of his hands, frustrated and upset and-
"Come on." John stood just as the one who had been peering into the water had a foot planted against his arse by one of his comrades and he was kicked into the lake, followed by a few bottles flung with surprisingly accuracy when his head resurfaced. Swearing extravagantly, he pulled himself from the lake on wobbly legs, swaying, rivers of tepid water pouring off of him.
John, having just admirably defended him against the slander of his co-workers- stopping off at Tesco and buying batteries just for this…knowing, even as he stood placidly in line and then straight-facedly handed over his money to the cashier, what he'd be using the batteries for later, was deliciously, sinfully erotic. Sherlock's erection, dark red and weeping at the tip, brushed against John's neck as his doctor lavished kisses against his skin- everywhere but where he most wanted- and Sherlock whimpered.
By the time the cab pulled up outside 221B, neither man was bothering to disguise his rapid breathing and tangible arousal. Sherlock got out of the taxi first, stepping straight into an oily, tar-black puddle in a pothole of the road…and didn't even care.
Their mouths now open, their tongues teased and tussled in a heated, deliciously-slow wrestle. John grinned as Sherlock's little huffs of breath started coming faster, his tight little noises and sighs getting louder and more frequent.
"Oh, John!" Mrs. Hudson's concerned face split into a happy smile. "I'm glad you're back, dear. I was afraid you'd get caught out in the rain. Sherlock is just helping me tidy things up a bit- my back, you know. It's hard for me to reach under the sink these days and he does a marvellous job of it." She gave John a wink. "I'll send him up shortly." Mrs. Hudson waited until John had nodded, given Sherlock one more searching look, then disappeared upstairs before turning with a stern look.
Shaun sighed. "God. You're such a pansy. Yeah, fine. Condoms. It's worth it to get to fuck your arse." He glanced around before lowering his voice. "Come on, Watson. Meet me at the med tent in 15 minutes."
"Out of. ..?" John's face flushed scarlet and he glanced guiltily at Molly. He knew that she knew and it was suddenly horribly awkward in the kitchen. Molly swallowed heavily, averting her eyes, embarrassment swelling and burning inside her body.
Sherlock's eyes narrowed at the trepidation mingled with curiosity he heard in John's voice. "Yes. Extensive research about the prostate." He stressed, smiling coyly at John. Instead of looking aroused, though, John looked a bit worried.
is working," John smirked up at him, breeching Sherlock's body with his third finger, thumbing the detective's darkened shaft comfortingly.
“And even though I hated having tripe like that in my hard drive, it makes a good metaphor at this moment. Because, for example, the sea, and the clouds, are the same. They look and feel and sound completely different, but they’re made of the same material.”
He shook his head. "Still in the freezer. That there is Derek. The little twink from London. The one in the leathers."
"Sherlock," John muttered tiredly, still shuddering faintly from the endorphin rush of his orgasm. "Do me a favour?"
John stifled a grin, gliding the pads of his fingers teasingly up the length of Sherlock's shaft. He was slowly getting hard against John.
“So good, Sherlock, that was…wow. God, the way you look when you come. Perfect. Sinful,” he babbled, lovingly palming the detective’s unsatisfied cock, and frotting gently against him.
Sherlock sighed, a huff of frustration, before tugging his collar back down and taking long strides from the room. Mrs Hudson would understand. If not, then he would find someone who
"What? I thought it was common for children to throw snowballs at each other. I see them doing it all the time on our street when it snows and they always end up pelting you, John. Though, you really encourage them and are just as bad as they are."
"Anything you need," John began soothing him with little sentences, interspersed with delicate, closed-mouth kisses. It was oddly quiet in the sterile hospital room, at nearly 2am. He listened with a practised ear as Sherlock's heart monitor slowed to a calmer pace with every passing moment.
Sherlock chuckled, a baritone vibration around John's increasingly-excited shaft that made the doctor hiss. Sherlock  scooped his hands under John's bare backside, lifting him a little, and kneading firmly.
"J-John can we...can we...just a bit more? I'm- I'm nearly there." Sherlock admitted through gritted teeth, thankful for the blindfold so he didn't have to look at John while he said it.
Dragging the lilo out of her room, John had looked as embarrassed as Molly felt, which only made her feel worse. Sherlock she could forgive because he seemed just as oblivious of the tension in the flat as ever. But John…John was nowhere as innocent as Sherlock. He knew.
Sherlock shuffled an inch or two closer and then yawned with a small laughing sigh, “Good,” he said. “Goodnight John. I’ll be here. I’m always here.”
"Try not to suffocate me with involuntary muscle spasms." Sherlock grinned and John chuckled too, biting his thin bottom lip.
Sherlock deposited his tea on the table, clearly fighting, and failing to fight, a chuffed, bright-eyed expression. Feeling bold, he made his way, in broad daylight to the bathroom for a shower - completely naked. John managed to swallow down a carnal sigh at the rare sight of a confident, bare Sherlock.
Afterward, they sat in silence in Molly's bright, cheery sitting room. At least, John had described it to Sherlock as bright and cheery but Sherlock remained dubious. There were pictures of cats on the wall.
"For the record, where'd you learn that?" John asked, his voice flat and Sherlock was instantly on alert. Sherlock could practically see the physiological result of the clench of shock he felt within himself - strained arteries, bouncing, mindless erythrocytes, lungs struggling like inconsistent, unreliable bellows.
"Yes, in my will. Do keep up, of course I left you everything. Who else would I have left it to? Mycroft? He'd buy cakes and pastries and squander it in largesse."
John flinched abruptly as Sherlock was reading the ingredient list on the back of the bottle with clinical interest, and the taller man looked down inquisitively.
John was still mulling this over when Sherlock emerged from the loo. He didn't acknowledge John, stalking right past him and flinging his clothes about the room looking for something to wear. With a surge of annoyance, John unfolded his arms and seized the petulant, flailing child with a strong hand, halting him. He was greeted with an indignant scowl for his troubles.
He could hear Sherlock banging things around in the shower, giving vent to his emotions and letting John know, in no uncertain terms, that he was angry.
He afforded a tiny instance of sentimentality by giving the outdated smartphone a brief peck as he settled himself onto the mattress once more.
John inhaled irritably, before responding with utter truthfulness, which he imagined would be a time-saver. "He did all sorts. We were pretty adventurous." He said calmly, his face deadpan.
Sherlock squinched his pale, ice-green eyes closed briefly, and his exhale seized with a small, strained laugh. "If I make a huge mess, it's your fault." He cleared his throat, taking a few extra seconds to indulge in the sight of John fingering himself forcefully. "...Your prostate is clearly extra sensitive. I want to lavish it with attention. A shame my tongue can't reach that far..."
“Sorry,” John uttered quietly, though he was unable to prevent a smug grin from distorting his empathy.
John laughed. "They were fucking Neo-Nazis, Sherlock, and we were a couple of queers snogging on a bench. Of course they'd have bothered us."
"You said I couldn't go without sex. So I'm going without." John pointed out. "Touching myself would be going against that."
Sherlock mentally kicked himself as he angled his finger up, blindly searching in the slick, wet heat of John's body for the little bump of nerves. He focussed on gauging John's reactions, the little twitches in his lined face, the hitches and inadvertent brief seizures of breath, as he searched, trusting to luck rather than experience. Suddenly, John cried out, body arching off the bed and going rigid, hand clamped around his cock as his eyes flared wide in surprise.
sex that he had experienced with his ex-army colleague. He then shook his head slightly at the thought of inflicting any sort of pain upon Sherlock, who he really did love more than anything.
In his rush, Sherlock tossed a sumptuous scarlet shirt on the bed, and John raised his head and eyed the brand-new tag curiously.
…” John cut off his sentence with a sharp groan as his detective palmed him encouragingly through his boxers.
"You can't be shy, slut like you." He smirked, grabbing Sherlock's soft cock through his pants and giving it a squeeze. "Finish what you started. Suck my cock."
, Sherlock..." He encouraged, voice ragged, and Sherlock, buoyed with success, kept going. He stroked John's cock slowly, his lips sucking kisses onto the exposed head.
"I would certainly hope so," John murmured, before gritting his teeth in anticipation, pushing apart Sherlock's strong thighs, and nudging the toys' considerable tip against Sherlock's entrance repeatedly, not yet allowing it to penetrate him. He did it, not out of a desire to vindictively tease, but out of a pure, animalistic desire to watch his partner truly border on
"You're usually the one popping lube out of your pockets." John muttered, searching fruitlessly through his own pockets, even though he already knew he hadn't brought any,
had a misunderstanding. And yes, I'm disappointed, ok? But that isn't your fault. Just...calm down."
John treated him to a glorious, clownish grin, and proceeded to resurrect the unseen fairy. “There we go. All is right with the world.”
John stopped talking when Sherlock suddenly went rigid, his body tensing against John's. He pulled away and stared at Sherlock, his stomach dropping at the stunned look on his face. "You...
"Are you, erm...going to...'eat me'?" Sherlock attempted, frowning away a bead of surprising sweat that had materialised somewhere under his curly fringe and started trickling down his face. Rubbing his forehead on his shirt sleeve, he braced himself once more against the wall of the narrow cubicle.
“I don’t answer inane questions,” Sherlock replied as he snuggled in, getting more comfortable by pushing his leg further between both of John’s, tucking it and entwining it with a whisper of fabric and a flex of his toes.
"I know you're watching me, Sherl," John commented mildly without taking his eyes from BBC1, and turning the volume up a little with the remote, before putting his tea down and re-adjusting his loose dressing-gown ties absently.
"I'm not scared." Sherlock snapped and John's arm fell, his lips quirking up as he watched his obviously scared-but-pretending-not-to-be lover squirt some lube onto his fingers. Sherlock rubbed it together to warm it up and then shuffled forward, insinuating his finger between John's cheeks. John was about to offer guidance, but silenced himself when Sherlock’s knowledgeable (if unsteady) fingers, carefully smoothed the tender skin around his entrance, prodding very gently, and tentatively, at the puckered, pink hole. He expected Sherlock to thrust his finger inside, wholly without finesse, and was prepared for the uncomfortable stretch, for the pain....
"Just thought you'd want to fully enjoy this." John said innocently, easing his way down and gripping the bottom of Sherlock's shirt, intent on pulling it up-
Sherlock snorted and gathered another pillow close to rest his head on as he pushed up a bit on his knees and lowered his torso to the bed, arcing his spine in a lean, elongated sweep of flushed skin and muscle, “Yours isn’t so bad either,” he mumbled friskily.
"It seems Fate has intervened in the form of a vindictive thunderstorm and a faulty ceiling." Sherlock grinned, turning with a flourish and heading towards his own bedroom, pleased. He'd been plotting different ways to get John to move into his room for days- the fact that John still insisted on sleeping in his own bed when they were together and Sherlock was making himself
"John!" Sherlock flexed violently, moaning alarmingly, with obvious anxiety as come squirted from his cock, painting stripes across his stomach as he writhed through his premature orgasm. John held his finger in Sherlock, bracing his arm as Sherlock sobbed and tightened, squeezing deliciously around his finger.
"Finally found a way to shut you up, hm?" John breathed as he worked his cock in and out of Sherlock's body, fingers digging into Sherlock's hips to keep the taller man in place as John snapped his hips. "Got anything clever to say now, Sherlock?"
," John huffed with open fascination, barely pumping his numb wrist inside the other man, clinically amazed by the sight which was virginal to him, the easy stretch of pink outer flesh, the adaptation of internal organs around a glorious intruder...
"Christ...maybe we should postpone it," he uttered, biting his bottom lip thoughtfully. "Maybe if we take his teeth out first, then there's no risk," he sniggered.
John snorted, shaking his head, his lips curling up into an amused smile, and Sherlock was about to cup a long hand to John's face for a good-morning kiss, when the smaller man twisted away, thumbing at his obnoxiously chiming phone. Sherlock grimaced petulantly.
Sherlock rolled eyes, the expression inconvenienced by his wet eyelashes which were glued together in pretty, tear-soaked cobwebs. "Improperly is fine, too," he murmured, "but I'd rather you know that I love you like a...a
"That thought hasn't even crossed my mind." Sherlock whispered. "How could you ever think I would harbor that idea of you? I..I l-" He bit his lip to keep the word inside, not knowing if he would be rejected now or not. John flinched, oblivious to the unspoken words, as Sherlock's dexterous fingers stroked along the back of his hand, mapping veins and bones and tiny scars in the tenderest topography. John sucked in another shaky, wet breath, and Sherlock continued quietly. “I loathe that you think that. Truly. What do you take me for? Apart from an arrogant, rude, sociopathic arse," He joked feebly. John chuckled wetly, turning his hand over and clasping Sherlock's.
. Loads of curly hair. Looks like he's twelve. Really posh. Probably being a tit to everyone. Wearing a big coat."
"Living room." Sherlock said, not sure if he would be able to wait until they got to the bedroom. It was too far away. He needed John now.
He had no idea what this could be, was trying to figure it out but was coming up with nothing. It was worrying. Fingers shaking slightly, Sherlock reached into the stained mug for the last cookie, took a deep breath, and opened it.
Sherlock had no idea if this particular gang had perhaps grassed on some of their friends, and were now facing the vicious, deafening consequences. He closed his pale eyes, giving a few more fierce yanks at his bonds. He wasn't ashamed to emit a faint hiss in the dark dank gloom as he imagined never seeing John again.
"Nothing you need to worry about." He said dismissively, reaching for Sherlock's trousers. "Take those off. If you're a very, very good boy, I'll jerk you off while I'm fucking you."
Still silence. A sudden, angry car horn pierced the humid air, and encouraged the first nagging prods of a migraine in John’s skull.
John frowned, trying to sync up this Sherlock, who was blatantly begging for it, to the shy, blushing Sherlock of the past week, the one who had stealthily sneaked into John's room and wanked instead of waking him up and demanding sex like this one would have done.
It wasn't the heat (which was considerable, sticky, and the source of much discomfort on John's part, who was more suited to cold weather), that was causing his face to redden so deeply that he could feel it tingling. It was a peculiar cocktail of arousal and shame. This felt filthy: getting off in the middle of a communal shower room where
yourself, Sherlock." John said and Sherlock's eyes snapped open to stare at him. "Touch yourself. Start stroking your cock. Slowly."
"I don't know what we'll do with all this, Sherl. Not like you can eat it all in one day- and no, that wasn't a challenge don't go setting about trying to prove that a human being
, that he was pushing John too far and he'd end up pushing him away…but he ignored it. "If they didn't, and the relationship worked out, you at least had sex with them by the second date. And then afterwards as many times as you could get it. We have been together for an entire week and haven't...you won't..." Sherlock huffed, his annoyance and hopelessness with the whole situation getting the better of him. "…If you don't want to sleep with me, just say so." His body tensed, waiting for John's agreement, his expression visibly, and deeply, unhappy.
"And you're upset because...?" John was stalling, and he knew it. He wasn't sure what Sherlock had heard, or what he thought he'd heard, so he would reserve judgement until the man gave him a little more information.
“Hold on tight,” he murmured, guiding John’s left hand to finally take hold of himself. The doctor complied eagerly, sobbing in relief as he began to frantically fist his shaft, head tilting back sharply and tendons standing out on his deeply-flushed throat, a delicious bead of sweat resting between his collarbones.
"Everything will be perfect if you snog me silly as often as I like and make me come on a regular basis, starting at some point today." Sherlock announced, straight-faced, before suddenly emitting his rare, adorable (to John), deep-toned giggle.
Sherlock followed John's gaze to the mark, heart starting up a quick tattoo inside his chest. A flurry of confusion, and then almost immediately, shock, threw him into a sudden, silent panic. "I...That. That happened when I..."
“What…does that mean?” Sherlock muttered as he glanced down with a twitch of his thighs. He flicked his eyes to where John’s fingers were and John noticed that his shaft throbbed and engorged further in interest.
" Shaun shivered, a full-bodied shake, and sagged against John, his breathing suddenly unsteady against John's neck. "Oh, god. You're serious? John...you...fuck, you're serious?" He blathered, cock smearing trails of pre-come over John's hip.
"Not...exactly, no. But he hasn't reciprocated when I've told him I love him either. Isn't that what you're supposed to do? He thinks I haven't noticed."
But, John reflected as Sherlock's kisses grew weaker and weaker as the taller man slipped into an exhausted sleep, he was
you can't," John challenged, swivelling his hips and then pulling Sherlock forcibly back onto him, impaling him deeper, whilst he himself stayed still.
"One at a time, yeah? Um…We were...intimate for about eighteen months. On and off. We weren't exclusive. By any stretch of the imagination." Not remembering Sherlock's other questions, he shrugged helplessly. "He moved away after we both left the army. I might have stayed with him, if he hadn't...you know."
Sherlock slumped limp, breathing hard and quivering in aftershock, still basking in the echoing rush of satisfaction, “Dear…God…” he rasped with a panting laugh, which only managed to tighten muscles around John’s oversensitive skin in a ripple.
"You've got to be roasting." John joined in as they entered the crowded, overly-noisy pub. "It's not healthy to wear that in this heat."
"In this very closet, no less," Sherlock wheezed, his crinkly smile lost in the darkness, before he kissed John's hair. He sensed the shocked twitch of John's head, and immediately anticipated his question, "Yes, really."
John sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. He knew Sherlock was getting frustrated with how slow things were progressing between them but honestly, had he expected John to shag him six ways from Sunday as soon as they got together?
Sherlock gulped and his hands shook as he reached for the bag, already knowing what he would pick and wondering what John would think when he did so. He withdrew the item from the bag and held it up for John's perusal. John grinned wickedly.
John fists clenched, and the resulting jolt of pain in his left arm did absolutely nothing to ease his vitriolic mood. Buzzing with frustration, he glanced at the bedside table and growled quietly at seeing nothing breakable, nothing to create the sort of cathartic, audible crash of destruction that might appease him enough not to just slap the childish detective sharply round the head and be done with it.
"Let him go." He said, frowning after the retreating back of Jason, rubbing his knuckles thoughtfully over his reddened cheek, before grinning again. "I think I got everything right."
"Normally. Probably not. But I haven't come in weeks, Sherlock. Weeks. I'm pretty sure I have at least one more in me." John greedily pushed back against Sherlock's finger and his brain skittered off the rails.
"What?" John was startled into incredulous laughter and Sherlock, his face falling into hurt, closed lines, turned away. John's hand shot out and he grabbed him, spinning Sherlock back around and forcing him to meet John's gaze. "What are you talking about? You're bloody gorgeous-"
Surprising himself almost as much as he surprised Sherlock, John found himself slapping at the detective's hand, before grabbing his biceps and slamming him roughly against the nearest wall.
John sucked in a sharp breath at the lovely blush that spread across Sherlock's cheeks. "Could be. It's really for whatever you want to hear, sweetheart. And I would
"I want you there with me." John walked around so he could look at Sherlock's eyes, which were downcast and sad. John felt like a colossal arse. "I really do, Sherlock. Come with me. I'll wait for you to get dressed."
"I don't need your fucking sympathetic mouth! I just want..." John seethed in frustration, levering himself up clumsily from the cheap armchair, his shoulder and chest protesting.
Sherlock shuddered through his aftershocks, wide--eyed and open-mouthed. The delightful shock of his orgasm left him lax but shaky.
"Can I be of assistance?" Chaucer asked, traipsing up to them, looking hopeful. Definitely worked on commission, John thought.
"God, you're fucking gorgeous like this." John breathed. "Jesus. Look at you. You're taking it so well." John moved his finger in and out of Sherlock's arse, almost all the way out before pushing it back in. "You're so...tight."
"No...John...yes...it's..." There was a long, restrained, shuddery growl, and Sherlock's body ground against the cheap bed tellingly, his thigh muscles twitching, and the heated pulse in his carotid artery throbbing visibly, even in the gloom.
“Sherl…get off me,” John laughed breathlessly, stroking Sherlock’s still-pulsing biceps. “Besides, you can’t sleep now, it’s only 11am.”
longer. Not that it mattered, John thought with a fond smile. He could feel Sherlock shuddering behind him, his body an almost dead weight against him, and warm semen was running down his thighs. Sherlock had obviously enjoyed himself and that, John thought with a wince as Sherlock finally let go of his grip on John's hips, was what mattered.
John chuckled, sending tremors through Sherlock's body. "Couldn't you have just deduced it?" He asked, pushing Sherlock's shirt from his shoulders and skimming his hands along the smooth, pale chest in front of him. "It was there...plain as day for you to see. For anyone to have seen, probably. How much I wanted you." John licked at Sherlock's nipple, sucking it into his mouth and laving over and over it with his tongue as Sherlock's already nervous composure began faltering even further.
Sherlock sucked at John's shaft like a hungry infant, pale eyes closed to savour the experience and taste, his large hands awkwardly, but enthusiastically, massaging the base of John’s cock, thumbing the hot, hardening skin with focussed fervour.
"Oh god." Sherlock muttered to himself, briefly wishing he hadn't started this whole thing…before raising his eyes, normally so sharp, but now languid and tentative, to John. "You won't laugh?"
Suddenly and without warning, John stuck out his tongue and inserted it, as far as it could go, into Sherlock's arse. Sherlock gasped, stunned, hips jerking and cock hardening, as John wiggled the muscle inside him, flexing his tongue and prying his arse apart with his hands.
John grinned self-deprecatingly and crawled up Sherlock's body to press a kiss against his cheek. "I guess you'll have to join me then. Pineapple for breakfast for both of us." He leaned down to whisper in Sherlock's ear. "Though if you come down my throat, I probably won't taste anything."
A deafening shift of heavy, tentative limbs and crisp bedclothes, and Sherlock was soon gently pinioned beneath his doctor, returning his polite kisses with a cautious tongue and tiny pecks.
"I'll be fine." John kissed Sherlock, tugging at his lip. "I'll be fine. Come on, Sherlock, come on, love." He wedged a hand down between their bodies and cupped a hand over Sherlock's erection, massaging at it forcefully. "Let it all out."
"I'm...I'm empty, And I don't like it," Sherlock admitted frankly as the seconds stretched out, John's breathing coming faster and faster behind him as the shorter man worked through the filthy implications of how long Sherlock had left the plug in, where he had gone with it, who he had seen. Sherlock sucked in a few fortifying breaths as John lifted him up slightly and quickly removed the rest of his clothes, leaving them in a bedraggled pile on the floor, before stripping himself as well. Sherlock hurriedly shoved aside the petri dishes and various items of dissecting equipment that were preventing him from getting a determined grip on the tabletop; his nails raked into the tortured wooden surface, seeking solace and support in anticipation of what was going to happen.
John winced vaguely and groaned, hugged his pillow to his head and let out an almighty, sleepy sigh before settling languorously into the mattress. Sherlock, exasperated, started tapping his fingers insistently on his partner's cheek, drumming out an impatient rhythm, and repeating his name at increasingly loud volumes.
"Yes...that's it, Sherlock. Fuck, yes, that's it." John filthily encouraged, mouth dry at the debauched sight in front of him. "Fuck me. Oh, Christ, fuck me harder."
"I'm not in the mood." Sherlock’s voice broke tellingly over the last word when John's fingers brushed against his testicles. John's smirk widened.
All the good feelings from his frankly fantastic, illicit wank in his office evaporated in the face of Sherlock's reminder that there was a whole office full of women, some of whom he'd dated, to which he'd just been outed. He'd have to explain, something he wasn't looking forward to, and on top of that, Sherlock was angry.
John felt as if he'd missed a step going down, his stomach lurching in surprise. "What?" He managed to ask through numb lips. "What do you mean?"
John pulled back, avoiding eye contact, and stepped away without a word. He didn't know what to say-
"Fuck..." John breathed, his resolution wavering under the sights and sounds of Sherlock practically begging him...but the idea of doing anything on the dirty, crummy kitchen floor sealed it. John shook himself free of Sherlock's grip and stood, offering him his hand. "Sofa. And I'll...I'll do whatever you want. Ok?"
"Not wasting any time, are we?" John muttered, watching Sherlock strip himself, his own hands starting to pull at his clothes, divesting himself of every shred in record time. Sherlock shoved his clothes inelegantly off of the bed and licked his lips eagerly, letting out a soft groan in the midday darkness as he felt John- wonderfully naked John- alight on the bed, and saw him crawl toward him with inexorable purpose.
"Let's do everything by touch. Our other senses. It'll be fun." Sherlock urged hopefully, his eyes not quite managing to hide the anxiety behind their ostensibly-bright eagerness.
John seemed genuinely remorseful, giving Sherlock’s knee a quick thumb-rub. There was a forgiving, peaceful silence between them, barely tainted by the constant churn of boats on the grey Thames, the jarring beeps of a dozen smartphones and the occasional childish shriek.
John gave him a brief kiss before pulling away and starting the clean-up. "You were enjoying it. And it wasn't...bad. But...it was just...too much." Even now, his cock was still prickling in a very distracting way. Cerebrally, he knew it was because there was blood trapped in the vessels making him feel twitchy and unsatisfied. He'd already come twice that day but the uncomfortable feeling of being unfulfilled lingered.
John grinned, snapping down the lid on his laptop and shoving it to the side. He rolled on top of his beautiful lover, thrilled at feeling Sherlock's prominent arousal digging into his thigh.
Sherlock was flushed, his hands knotted in the sheets as he watched John ride out the last waves of his climax. John's eyes dropped to his groin, expecting to find Sherlock's prick hard, looking forward to maybe being allowed to help him get himself off.
John cleared his throat and rubbed his dark blue eyes which were still gummed from sleep, peering up at his lover. "Sherlock, what the fuck...it's still early." He propped himself up and glanced at the bedside clock before sinking back onto the mattress with a groan. "…I know you're excited, but we live less than twenty minutes away…and it doesn't even open for
John smirked, snapping the batteries into place with promising clicks. "You won't die, Sherlock. People don't die from not having an orgasm. You should just be grateful I've relented."
"Has anyone else ever done this to you?" Sherlock's fingertip traced the head of John's cock and John's eyes slammed closed, his breath gusting out in a sob.
Sherlock pretended he didn’t notice John’s internal squirming. He absolutely revelled in the fact that John, after all this time, was completely eaten up with curiosity about his sexual habits. He was blatantly obsessed with it, in fact, and
John's spine stiffened in shock and he knew he looked staggered at seeing the Irishman again. Shaun still looked the same, and he gave John a lazy grin, his eyes roaming up and down his body.
John huffed a small, private laugh at the thought of Sherlock as any kind of animal - 'cute and furry' would not be the immediate adjectives.
his hips while he walked through the aisles. And Sherlock wanted to wipe that smug little smirk off John's face- preferably by sucking his cock until he was gasping and gone with pleasure and he swore he’d never smile at the petite brunette they passed near the bread ever again.
"Alcohol for compliments, sounds like a fair trade. OK, so... broad shoulders, always good. Uh..." John cocked his head, trying to see Greg as someone he would flirt with. "Your... eyes."
to see you, Sherlock. Every goddamn inch of you because I don't know what's got it in your head that you're hideous but…you're the most beautiful, stunning, attractive man I've ever seen."
“I want a muffin,” Sherlock declared quietly. Before John could respond, Sherlock nodded through the window of Speedy’s. “That young woman on the till. It’s her first day, she’s feeling pressured. Distract her, ask her questions about what products are gluten-free. I’ll grab something for you as well.”
"Lestrade. He already knew, though. Just congratulations. A few others from down at the Yard. Oh...oh,
He stepped back a pace, giving John a cheeky grin that the doctor recognised immediately as being one of forgiveness, before unexpectedly twirling round with his violin, eyes on John, losing himself in the song. John laughed, glad Sherlock wasn't upset any more, eyes sparkling with mirth and love as he watched Sherlock play the rest of the song, finishing with a series of complicated looking flourishes. John applauded appropriately, noting the way Sherlock's cheeks flushed with pleasure as he did, and then hauled his love in for a filthy kiss.
you fucking yourself, Sherlock. I'd make you stop, tell you to put your hands above your head and not move them. No matter what or I'd stop. And you know I would. So you'd keep them there. And I'd fuck you myself. You're already so loose I bet you'd take three of my fingers easily."
Sherlock sighed massively, and then checked his watch in casual hyperbole. “I have told her nothing. If everything went to plan, and her travel was uneventful and punctual, then she’ll be back in…six minutes. Ish. Although,” he paused, narrowing his eyes and listening carefully to the faint voices from Baker Street, “…It seems she is early.”
John pulled back his already-bloodied fist for another brutal punch, only barely aware of the faint, horrified vocalisations in the background.
"I...yes? Yes. It is. Of course. Happy..." Sherlock tried to think of the appropriate sentiment. "...'Us?'"
With the shocking immediacy of a switch being flicked on - a switch controlling a million volts of vital electricity - Sherlock's brain cottoned onto a fact that his body was already achingly aware of - John needed to be fucked. Relentlessly.
"Pick that gun up!" he snapped and the boy scrambled for his rifle, picking up his gun with shaking fingers and, sniffling, steadying himself visibly.
"Sort of. Seeing you like this- hair cut short...you look handsome." His eyes twinkled as he leaned down to steal a quick kiss. "And I realized...you're
John grinned, a shadow of malice in his dark eyes at being reminded of the unfair treatment. "Good boy." He casually removed his hand from Sherlock's swollen shaft, absorbing the resulting strained wail of desperation with pleasure. "And what do you think of all this? Your...opinions on my actions," John muttered, giving one teasingly light stroke to his detective's length.
Dimples nestled gently above his buttocks deepened as Sherlock tensed and laughed breathlessly in response, “I
"You say that to all your conquests. Please, John- if you still want to do this, turn the lights off. If there was a way I could see you and remain invisible, I would embrace it wholly. But I've memorised your...well, almost every inch of your body, and I can see you with my fingers, even in pitch darkness."
The only answer to his call was the lingering echo of the front door slamming shut, and Sherlock felt a frown crease his eyebrows. With a huff and pulled his head back into the bathroom, slamming the door with enough force to shake the frame.
John finally slumped against the bed, boneless, and blinked up at Sherlock, smiling tiredly. "Fuck...Sherlock." He sighed, stretching his overworked muscles, blissfully relaxed.
"T-touch me. please, Jo-ohn...touch me," Sherlock whimpered, shuddering visibly beneath John and he felt Sherlock's passage flutter around him, signalling the other man was close.
John was rocking breathlessly, his free hand gripping blindly at the Irishman's tight, damp waist. His eyes registered a swift, clumsy, shocking movement, as Shaun seized his mouth in a ferocious kiss. It was like a shock to John's system. Unexpected. Thrilling. Every muscle in his body seized up. It was the first time they'd ever kissed and John gasped, surging upward and kissing Shaun desperately. Shaun paused for a second, and John could feel every throb, every pulse, of the man inside him, the man who now bit gently at his lips, which were open with shock, and ripe for the taking.
"Breathe, Sherlock." John murmured soothingly, reaching beside him for the toy and selecting the correctly sized batteries. "Just breathe, love. You're fine, Sherlock, you're fine. Just breathe."
John wriggled slightly with quiet glee, loving the sound of the word on Sherlock's shy lips. "God, I could listen to you talk about orgasms for hours," he chuckled. "And when you got tired, I'd give you a couple more to talk about."
"What, because I'm injured?" John asked incredulously. "I can't rough you up for a few weeks so you've suddenly decided-"
"Yes." Sherlock easily lied, frowning as he stared at the screen. "Not now, John." He murmured, knowing John was bursting to ask questions about a new client. They hadn't had a case in quite some time and the strain was wearing on them both. "Just let me..."
Sherlock gulped. "Yes." He kissed John again, pressing his lips as hard as he could against John's, wanting to convey how much John meant to him and how very much he wanted him. They snogged indulgently for a few minutes and just as Sherlock eased back, determining this was probably violating John's definition of "waiting"… John sighed and pushed Sherlock forcefully back against the wall.
Jason laughed, but he was one of the few that did. The others looked slightly strained and sick, embarrassed for John as if their innocent ribbing had taken a turn they didn't like.
The pleasure scraped through John with agonising, heady slowness, his own short fingernails raking purchase on Sherlock's ribcage. He had never felt anything quite like it, and the sense of not-quite-enough was stinging him, forcing a litany of gasps and grunts and sobs from his gritted teeth. He had never been this consistently vocal, and he couldn't rein it in. He thudded his sore, hungry cock harder, more inelegantly, inside Sherlock.
John snorted fondly, carding his fingers through those lovely curls and turning Sherlock to face him. "There's more than one way to have sex, Sherlock. We can still...you can still get me off. Only if you want to." He hurried to add, not wanting Sherlock to feel obligated.
John was shaking his head before Sherlock said the last word and at that, he winced. "Sherlock, no. Just...don't."
John continued his slow, deep, sensuous massage of Sherlock's supple back, fingering his neck with purpose, before smoothing down Sherlock's spine to his backside, which he squeezed playfully, rewarded with a strangled yelp. "Let's be brutally honest with each other right now, Sherlock. I would move heaven and earth in order to keep you with me. And I think you have full cognizance of how bloody important you are to me. As well as how incredibly gorgeous and fucking desirable you are," John winked, before smooching Sherlock softly.
," John sighed tremulously. He winced faintly as a rogue, London-tasting breeze shifted the closed curtains and a blinding sunbeam pierced the window and his eyelids, his eyelashes fluttering at the intrusion.
"Yeah but...you've been...getting off w'others. Haven't you?" John picked at him, wriggling his hips when Shaun scissored his fingers. He wanted him to touch his prostate again- not sure if he liked it or not- but Shaun didn't.
hot," John muttered, blushing self-consciously. He dragged his hands down Sherlock's extensive spine, humming appreciatively at little twitches of muscles and damp skin. He stopped when he got to the detective's wonderful backside, plump and muscled and yet wonderfully bouncy. He knew this because he gave a few playful taps to the rosy mounds.
"Oh...J-John." Sherlock writhed, trying to parse the multitude of sensations he was experiencing. The pain- slight but stinging. The tingly feeling which lingered even after John had stopped. The throbbing which was centred at his cock- and when John reached between his legs and grasped him, Sherlock could feel how hard he was- twitching in arousal. John chuckled, sweeping his thumb over the head of Sherlock's cock, collecting the moisture there and spreading it down the shaft as he stroked him. Sherlock's head fell onto the scarred tabletop and he flexed his hips in counterpoint to John's strokes, shaking slightly as he anticipated the next strike, his hips beginning to quirk and grind restlessly.
"God. Not Craig. He had the personality of a dead fish. She broke it off with him months ago. Nick. Nick was the latest one. The one with the fancy hair." John wiggled his hand over his own head demonstrably.
! I'm gonna send you home if you don't behave. Right?" Lestrade ordered voluminously, placing a heavy, stern hand on his shoulder.
A week later, Sherlock was wrapped in a Union Jack blanket that had materialised near the sofa a few days previously- he thought he might have lifted it from a crime scene and then forgotten about it, but he wasn't sure- sulking in his self-imposed cocoon, eyeing John with silent suspicion whilst pretending to watch Murder, She Wrote. John was noticeably agitated. It was obvious that his mind, like Sherlock's, was on the events of that night. Of what would be taking place.
And when the need became impossible to ignore, he satisfied it in the fullest, deepest, most intense way he feasibly could, gorging himself shamelessly on it till he was nearly sick with pleasure.
." He said, scowling forbiddingly. "It's just for me...and I'm more than willing to see it again," Sherlock added, smirking, ruffling his hair with a hand which had gone slightly numb after leaning on it too long.
Sherlock scowled at the noise and retreated to his bedroom again, “Sometimes I wish I could hibernate whenever I pleased, for as long as I wanted.”
It was unclear whether it was the bite, John’s words, his hand, or all three, but Sherlock choked on a whimpering groan and became suddenly, exceedingly vocal, cursing and whining as his pleasure built intensely, “Yes! Yes…fuh-fuck! Mm…mm, oui!” He trailed off into a garbling bundle of curses, pushing into John’s moving hand as his penis got harder with his oncoming orgasm. “Oui…plus forte! Plus vite! C’est bon! Oui! – Merde…oui!”
John was afraid to speak, afraid he'd break whatever tenuous peace Sherlock had gained from his touch. He held his breath, watching a flush stain Sherlock's cheeks, the knowledge that this mad genius had almost been taken from him hitting particularly hard.
"Whatever you want." He replied, following John further into the building, away from any prying eyes that may happen to walk along.
"Please." Sherlock said without hesitation, with obvious relief, sliding his fingers from John's body and hunching forward. He rested his forehead against John's knee and took deep breaths, a fine trembling shaking his limbs. John was patient, didn't move while Sherlock calmed down, doing his best to ignore his erection and the gaped, horribly empty way his arse now felt. It took a good ninety seconds before Sherlock pulled back, hazy-eyed and flushed a beautiful, rosy pink.
“Some bloke came in and he had two extra nipples. I don’t think he even wanted anything done about them, it was like he was showing them off. Bit bizarre.”
John winced at the bald facts of his previous relationship laid bare, but he nodded, squeezing Sherlock's hand.
John groaned, his face distorted in an expression that couldn't be construed as anything but pain and shock. The doctor's weak right hand hovered over his own crotch in a subconscious act of protection. "I didn't mean...I thought you meant my hip...I didn't think you were going to…God." John gave into the urge and cradled himself, cupping a hand around his soft cock and giving Sherlock a glare.
"Did we go too fast, love?" John asked, looking concerned and taking his hand away from his cock, which had started to flag in the face of Sherlock's obvious discomfort. "Were you not enjoying it? I thought you wanted it- you should have told me if you didn't." He said softly, understandingly. "I wouldn't have been disappointed."
Perhaps he'd pushed John too far this time, Sherlock thought as he took a deep breath, glancing up at John's stony face, before licking his lips again and leaning forward, taking the tip of John's cock in his mouth.
Breathing deeply but softly, Sherlock moved quietly towards his...towards John's bed, kneeling carefully at the side, his knees making the barest of
The detective winced, chuckling dirtily, at the sensation of wet, hard enamel biting possessively at the base of his hairline. They both ignored the chemical smell in the air, the less-than-sanitary location, and the pulsing throb of a bassline from dodgy, unpleasantly-loud music that was making its presence felt from the main room of the pub.
"Could barely make myself go to work this morning, seeing you stretched on the bed. Naked. Your cock getting hard. I wanted to call in and fuck you all day." John took a deep breath, remembering the sight of his boyfriend from earlier. "I bet you're stretched out on the bed right now...if I were there I would join you. I'd...I'd kiss and lick my way up your legs. Your..." John had to pause and adjust himself in his trousers. "Your beautiful, long legs, already spread. Ready to be fucked. Like a fucking whore. Tell me how hard you are, Sherlock. Tell me."
Thanking God that Sherlock never actually said 'stop,' John efficiently, painstakingly brought him to climax, gulping assiduously on his thick, blood-hot member, pumping quickly with his fingers, sighing in relief when the muscles around his numbing digits suddenly crushed tight around him, and Sherlock bellowed.
"And are you not, John?" Sherlock asked innocently, arching an eyebrow and giving John an amused look. "I would believe some of the activities we have done would be considered
"Sorry, I know that was probably too much." John admitted, grasping Sherlock's hand and giving it a squeeze. Sherlock tiredly squeezed back.
"Is that all you're going to say to me?" John sighed, squinting up at the mussy-haired detective and scowling when Sherlock merely stared at him in reply. "What the hell are you doing in my bed, Sherlock?"
John was still angry over their encounter with Chaucer. Sherlock could tell it in the set of his jaw and the way he walked, stiff and silent, in front of him. John had vacated the shop before Sherlock, telling him to pick whatever else he saw fit to buy and Sherlock, weak-kneed and shaky from his denied orgasm, had hastily obtained a few extra items, wanting the shopping trip to be over and done with so he could meet up with John outside and relieve the achy tension swirling in his body.
“I know all about the dribbling,” Sherlock scoffed good-humouredly, and suddenly there was an explosion of hot, mint-scented breath against John’s face as Sherlock shuffled closer. “I don’t mind the risk. I like to live dangerously.”
. Right. Yes. Of course,” Sherlock wheezed until he cleared his throat and flitted his gaze around the room in sudden embarrassment. “Undress me
"Not that I'm aware of. But he can do this. He's more than capable. And he is bugged. We'll hear it if things go south and rush in if he needs our help. Just settle down."
"Do you want to have sex?" John whispered in an astoundingly attractive, feather-light, innocent tone. Sherlock jerked away, eyebrows snapping together, and gave John a surprised, searching look.
"Is that something you think about a lot then Greg?" teased John, nodding as the bartender asked if John wanted another one. "Course he has one, and he's not an alien." John kept his tone light, but the undertone was almost defensive.
He deposited their pet in the living room, checking he had enough food and water, and then returned to the bedroom with a sulky, belligerent expression on his pale face. Closing the door, he gave his doctor a piercing stare.
"Good boy." He whispered, licking again at the tight pucker which flexed, opening and closing, at the stimulus. To either side of John, Sherlock's legs began trembling, gooseflesh marching up his calves and setting his hair standing at attention.
The doctor sighed in resignation. "Listen...Sherlock, I can tell you're enjoying this. And I'm going to let you, God help me. Just...please never tell anyone about this, alright?"
A group of young men (Sherlock felt justified he'd gauged their ages correctly) were grouped beneath the trees, cackling with laughter, shoving each other and stumbling about. Clearly drunk. There was a crackle of undergrowth and broken branches as one was pushed into a holly bush, before his assailant had his half-empty Bud bottle wrenched from his hands. The reek of alcohol was getting stronger, and one of the men, with a ruddy face and a tattooed neck, stumbled to the edge of the lake and peered at it, as if looking for the phone.
"This a good spot?" Lestrade asked, scoping out the best seat so he'd still be able to watch the wide-screen televisions.
, Sherlock." John pleaded needily, smoothing his own hand along Sherlock's shaft gently. Sherlock grinned fiendishly, his large hand tickling teasingly near John's member.
Nodding briskly with a strained and eager grunt, Sherlock swept a shaking arm aside and motioned to one of his bedside drawers, “It’s…it should be in there,” he said, grabbing at John’s waist with his other hand.
"You've got...one minute...before I spill my fucking load inside you," John warned, before pumping even harder inside Sherlock's arse, sinking his teeth into the back of Sherlock's neck and keeping them there, digging his nails possessively into the detective's delicate wrists, and rutting him like a male lion for a good twenty seconds.
John waited patiently, politely ignoring the two wet sniffles that followed. "…He touched me," Sherlock admitted quietly.
Molly's flat was...nice. Nothing spectacular. Certainly nothing like 221B. But it was spacious, nicely fitted up and uncluttered. The scent of lemon cleaner lingered in the kitchen and living room, an even more chemical smell lingered in the loo, and Sherlock's nose twitched. It was obvious Molly had speedily tidied up after Sherlock's phone call earlier.
Once, John had even resorted to paging Sherlock over the intercom as if he were a wayward child. Sherlock had arrived at the appropriate till with his arms full of avocados, beanie babies, and cool whip, insisting they were all essential for his new experiment and pouting until John bought them for him.
“You’ve been busy then,” John quipped, in an adorably awkward attempt to inject some humour into the situation, before scurrying away from Sherlock’s little den of iniquity.
"Oh...Christ...Sherlo-" John uttered, scrabbling at the detective's ribs, soothing the vicious purplish bruises at his scapulae with messy, wet kisses. "Oh, fuck, honey..."
!" Sherlock grated out, eyes shut tight and his body flexing, grinding forcibly. "...S-stop...I don't - want to c..."
The tension lifted, they both lapsed into easy wordlessness for a solid five minutes. Sherlock rested his head back, and closed his eyes peacefully. John tapped away at his keyboard.
Sherlock pouted slightly, and physically recoiled a little in the face of his doctor’s tempting entreaty, before grudgingly giving in with a small sigh and a tired eye-roll.
When he turned around, Sherlock was staring at him, his eyes narrowed suspiciously. John raised his eyebrows, trying to look innocent.
"G-go slow." John cautioned, not wanting a repeat of earlier and willing his hips to remain still and not thrust. God, but Sherlock was good at this. John closed his eyes, wondering how Sherlock had got so good in so little time. Not that he was complaining but...oh, God...
"Not...not there yet." John sped up the motions of his hand, trying to keep up with Shaun's thrusts. It was exhilarating. Almost made him feel like he was flying as everything around him spun at a dizzying rate.
He'd always been attracted to Sherlock, ever since the first day they'd met- and every other encounter since then had made John addicted to the person that was Sherlock Holmes. It wasn't just Sherlock's body and face he adored, but his mind. His wit. His personality. John had fallen for it all- and hard- but he'd always thought...well, that nothing would come of it.
The detective halted in feverish disbelief, panting heavily, eyes wide in horror and staring at nothing, and uttered two simple words -
"Mmm," came the faint response, before Sherlock let go of John's hands, smoothing his own comfortingly across John’s chest and stomach, before grasping his doctor’s slick, engorged shaft, and working it effectively.
"I'm...I might just...go," John said feebly, clearing his throat and quickly heading out the door, towards the stairs to his bedroom.
John watched with irritated disbelief as Sherlock strolled off in the direction of the correct aisle with a previously non-existent sense of direction. He wondered if Sherlock had some sort of innate homing instinct for where sex products were located. Would explain a lot, actually.
"You looked...you looked...very good." Sherlock admitted in a fiendishly-deep baritone murmur, eyeing the warm drops of come on John's quivering stomach hungrily. John huffed out an awkward laugh, shaking his head and reaching for the towel, wiping himself off and scrubbing at the lingering traces of come.
"You're not immune to happiness, Sherlock. – If you insist, I'm coming in. And I'm going to force this joyous time upon you," he grinned, going to his flatmate's door and rapping his knuckles on it noisily.
Stomping inelegantly downstairs, he sulked into Mrs. Hudson's kitchen after half-heartedly picking her front door lock with his penknife.
"I know for a fact that, not only have you never had anything bigger than a fair-sized cock inside you, you
The next few words from Sherlock were emitted so casually that John’s heart took a good few seconds to remember to stop with shock.
Sherlock blinked his eyes open and glanced down, wrinkling his nose at the mess and John laughed, turning back to the bed to deal with the sheet situation.
Sherlock sat on the kerb, thumbing through his phone as he tuned out the occasional polite tut of passers-by who had to step over his woollen coat, trailing out behind him on the ice-cold pavement.
"Mmm? Fine. I'm fine. Just...just fine." Sherlock quickly stated, eying John's erection before darting his eyes down to shadowed area where his arse was, framed between his spread legs. "I...you'll need to lift your legs a bit...to let me..." He gestured with the lube, hoping John wouldn't make him say it out loud.
John had suffered enough disillusionment and grief during his long deployment to cease caring whether anyone saw him being fondled by the man he was routinely shagging.
"I'm ready," he murmured, blinking away a rogue, stinging bead of sweat as it burned down from his hairline.
His long, white fingers eased over his biceps and forearms, enjoying the tingling, and not-unpleasant sensation of contact on the scars of his track marks.
John inhaled slowly, a tactic Sherlock knew he employed when he was trying to remain clam. "Okay. He touched you...there. And when you said he wanted to eat you...you meant your...?" He trailed off and Sherlock, shivering from the memory, nodded.
Sherlock snuffled an immature giggle at that last phrase, and John looked up at him again, seeing no hint of vindictiveness in his honest, crinkly grin. Shaking his head, John absorbed his flatmate’s tobacco-tasting, deep-toned laugh and then offered his own breathless, slightly manic giggle as a sweet sequel.
"Yeah." John groaned, gasping when Sherlock repeated the movement again and again, cock starting to leak at the tip. "Add a-another."
for it?" Sherlock queried, looking tentative. "I know we've done it before but I hate to think this has put you off…"
John took a second to understand that this was what his life had come to before lifting the lightest case in his good hand and nodding. Sherlock could get the rest of the cases later.
Sherlock returned with their drinks, pushing John's into his hand. "This is more fun than I thought," the detective admitted. "Have a drink."
John snorted, ignoring Sherlock's provocative comment. There was no way he would be able to come again so soon, much less get it up. He wasn't twenty any more. Going twice in one day was enough to entirely drain him.
Slightly irked that he could coax no further movement or any sound whatsoever from the detective, who was barely reciprocating, John broke the rather one-sided kiss. He moved back only far enough to be able to focus on Sherlock’s blush-stained face, his embarrassment painted like exquisite red ink on virgin porcelain.
..." Sherlock wavered on the edge of his orgasm, voice raw and torn with effort, brow crinkling and his whole body tensed in anticipation.
"Greg...Greg...he might be...what's going on?" he asked quizzically, though worry imbued each and every word.
"Wh-what?" Sherlock's eyes flared even wider and John, not waiting for him to do it himself, dropped his hands to Sherlock's flies, undoing them and pulling out Sherlock's prick. "What are you doing?" Sherlock asked, his voice a shaky, unsure whisper in the posh dressing room.
"Call it what you want," John teased, "but it's healthy to get yourself off. Without another person there. Doesn't mean I don't still want you or anything."
"Let me get dressed for the occasion. Five minutes." Sherlock said, hurrying towards the bedroom, inspired to make everything perfect for John’s romantic gesture. "Oh. And I see you got fortune cookies. Never sold with Thai takeaway. If I didn't know better, John Watson, I'd say you were up to something," He winked, before swirling dramatically and entering his bedroom.
"Oh, god-...god, yes." John wheezed and Shaun teased him, licking at his lips but denying him, grinding his hips against John's arse- before artlessly plunging his tongue in John's mouth. John reflexively sucked on his hot, tasteless, dehydrated tongue, the reminder of the blowjob he had offered (and been given) flashing into his mind, and he started to squirm and jerk tellingly as his orgasm surged.
The detective hissed as he lowered his legs, his heels bumping loudly on the floor. The stretch of vigorous insertion and the effort of his fingers and wrists were starting to make themselves known in tiny tingles and aches, and he allowed himself to just close his eyes and breathe for a minute.
His cock, gripped in his hand, pulsed, adrenaline surging through his veins. A thin string of pre-come welled from the tip, dribbling along his fingers as he held his breath, heart in his throat, watching John writhe.
Sherlock looked pained, but John recognised it as the breathless, heated, gorgeous pain of ecstasy, and he was proved right by the little, constant whines and sobs of the taller man who was beginning to experiment with little bumps and swirls of his hips.
"FUCKING CUNT!" The kid yelled, swinging his still-intact bottle at Sherlock's face with blind ferocity and insane speed. Sherlock quickly stepped back, feinting, and with calm and silent ease, John seized the boy's wrist and fractured it with an audible crack. The youth howled, dropping the bottle and cradling his injured wrist to his chest. His mates ranged around him, not knowing what to do, waiting for further direction.
John swallowed heavily, feeling a distant pulse of arousal which he suppressed. Now wasn't the time- they were both knackered. "Yeah. Of course…. Do you think of me when you use that gigantic beast?"
He heard John's heavy tread on the stairs and curled tighter, pulling his dressing gown around himself and wishing he were invisible.
?” Rolling his eyes in a way that was filled with nervousness, Sherlock rotated his wrist and waved his fingers in a vague gesticulation. “I mean…with penetration? Or…there’s the…
"I understand if you don't want people knowing about us. You already receive enough grief and jabs and attempts at humour just being my friend- how much worse would it be if everyone found out we were together. I understand why you haven't told anyone. It…it makes sense." The idea of John not wanting to tell anyone they were together hurt…but Sherlock shoved it away. It didn't matter if no one else knew, he sternly told himself, just as long as he had John. Just as long as he got to keep John...He could withstand the rest.
Sherlock coughed quite dramatically as a result of a shocked inhale, and John grinned and patted his broad back in a motion that started as a hefty, masculine fix for a blocked throat, but which ended in a firm, tender rub of the younger man's scapulae.
"That all you were planning on doing?" John teased, cock twitching as Sherlock eyed it with undisguised pleasure. "Not that I'm complaining....better than an alarm clock but..."
John glanced at Sherlock's hardened crotch under his silky blue dressing gown and boxers and rolled his eyes. "
"I just...I mean, it might be a bit......quick.” Sherlock explained quietly, squirting more lukewarm lube into his palm, and applying it to himself assiduously.
The displays were severely sparse, the complete opposite of what John was used to when he went clothes shopping, usually in a busy shopping centre. He wouldn't have known what to do with any of it, but Sherlock strode around, looking at things with a critical eye while John pretended he wasn't feeling massively out of place.
A smartphone suddenly sailed past them into the lake, narrowly missing a swan which honked and flapped its wings in a display of shock and anger. More deafening laughter rang out.
"Ugh," John heaved, giving an inadvertent full-body shudder as he rode his brief aftershocks, trying to drag them out a little more by offering a few sharp thrusts that caused his lukewarm, wet cock to slip up the irresistible pale fullness of the detective’s left buttock. "
propose earlier, did you?" John asked, a creeping tide of embarrassment washing over him as he saw how sincerely dumbfounded Sherlock was.
Sherlock skulked at the doorway to the kitchen. The smell of frying bacon (organic, streaky), sausage (artisan, rare-breed) eggs (omega-3 enhanced) and mushrooms (English-farmed buttons) was alluring, was almost enough to pull him further into the room. But he remained lurking in the doorway, unsure…until John stunned him by turning to him with a massive, fond grin, a greasy spatula in hand.
