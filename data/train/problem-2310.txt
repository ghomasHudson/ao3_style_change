Upon seeing the detective inspector, Sebastian moved suddenly and dealt Sherlock a hard blow to the stomach. Sherlock doubled over, gasping, and so was powerless to stop his adversary. So he ended up facing the DI, the knife against his Adam’s apple, Sebastian just behind him.
He wanders past the classics and genre fiction into another room where the ceiling soars higher. Above, a skylight allows pale sunbeams to filter into the shelf-lined space. Here, the second story is visible, as a platform circles the sides of that level, allowing the people browsing above to peer over the banister at the rest of the shelves below.
“I want to talk to you.” Sebastian stood up straight though he kept his arms crossed. “I see you didn’t bring police.”
“Of course,” Irene's teeth gleamed behind her scarlet lips. “Sexy history prof. Pretty fair with his marks but sadly pretty immune to my charms. He says he wants me to succeed on my own merit.” Her eye roll was so impressive it was nearly audible.
“You are basing your question off how you saw me react to that Dutch ship,” Sherlock cocked an eyebrow. He had shifted around to lean his body weight against the mast, though his hands continued to wander up and down John’s arms. “But it has been three years since that scene. I have never forgotten how you reacted, and I wish I had perhaps changed course. Not in the midst of that storm,” he rushed on when John opened his mouth. “But sent longboats after, sought any survivors. Yet I did not.” He shook his head, scowling. “It did not feel right with me. Which I imagine is partially your fault,” he shot John a faux-severe glance. “And when I saw your ship sinking… I don’t know.”
Sherlock smiles, a little sheepish. “I think I mentioned it once. But it was a brief diversion, really. I was easily bored as a child. Still, had I followed on that path, we might have met there.”
He returned with the boy minutes later, carrying a bowl of water and fresh bandages. Wiggins switched the cloths and wiped the wound as best he could while Sherlock daubed John’s forehead with a cool, damp rag. John let himself drift, not awake but not asleep. After a while, he heard Wiggins speak.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Ekene has found us a cluster of coves to take shelter in, off the coast of Africa. We’re nearly there. If we can just make it-”
“I do, and I like how you like it too.” John flashed a cheeky grin at him before returning to work. His other hand moved lower, landing on Sherlock’s chest. His thumb found a nipple, and he rubbed it through the fabric of Sherlock’s shirt. Sherlock made a whimpering sound, hands gripping hard on John’s hips, then sliding back to his backside.
He spent the next few minutes flicking through several of his “pairs,” the people the site had somehow
John slipped back to the main deck and rounded up his men. Most of them, save Sholto, had made no effort to befriend the pirates, merely treating them with distant wariness. They spent most of their time, even during meals, up on deck amongst themselves. The pirates in turn had left them alone.
“Because I know it’s not what you planned for your life,” Sherlock said hastily, lifting his head to stare at John, eyes wide. “You were a captain in the Royal Navy with your own ship, and now you’re a pirate. And you have to share your leadership, and—”
Footfalls, then the sound of a chair sliding across tile. Molly was more than halfway down the corridor when she heard it.
“If you intend on remaining in his company,” he glares, as if to warn — again — that to do otherwise at this point would be unsafe, “perhaps you could keep me apprised of his wellbeing?”
John nodded. “In a while. There’s a few matters I need to take care of first.” Their navigator had taken ill, so John was scrambling to ensure the charting of their course had been completed properly. Still, a sparring session with James was not something he wanted to miss. John knew the former captain was an excellent fighter, had known ever since the day John had met him on a dock in France, several months ago. He had invited the man to join his crew after a day of talking and sparring, made him his Lieutenant a fortnight after that, and had never regretted his decisions regarding the man once since.
Sherlock huffs a soft laugh, but it comes out only half-amused. “But that doesn’t sound so bad. Besides, we talk a lot about your writing and my school work.”
Soon, their fight brought them to the edge of the circle of pirates, which shifted in a hasty effort to avoid the flashing blades. Sebastian seized the opportunity to break through the human wall and into the open part of the deck. Winter pursued him, and with the new arena, the dynamic of the fight shifted. Both fought harder and faster than ever, their feet moving as much as their swords.
He lifted his gaze to meet Mycroft’s. The elder Holmes brother was still, eyes wider than they had been a minute previous. He knew, he
John was aghast. This man who had tended to his illness with such gentleness mere hours ago, who had held him in his arms and spoken tender words, condemning an entire crew to death?
John’s hands are stuffed deep into his pockets, his shoulders hunched and his brow furrowed. He slows before the door to 221, staring at it. As he hesitates, Sherlock examines him.
Sherlock frowns a bit at John, obviously sensing his casual tone is feigned. But he obeys, and John pretends to be focused on lifting the lid, taking out the tablet’s how-to manual, and skimming its contents. In reality, his attention is intent upon his boyfriend.
“Oh,” Sherlock blinks, as if thrown entirely off balance. “Well, for one thing, he’s clearly tired. He always has a tendency to blink twice as often when he’s been travelling. That, and his watch was still set on SGT, eight hours ahead of Greenwich. He must
Sherlock grins and drops his book onto his lap. His thumbs fly across the screen as he taps out his response.
Moriarty grinned, like a pleased schoolteacher burdened with a particularly slow student who had just realized one and one made two. “Of course. Go on.”
But before he could finish speaking the request, hands were pulling him forward, up, and into the longboat. John watched, winded and shocked, as the newcomers assisted his wounded and bedraggled men to safety.
John’s reply arrives barely a minute later, and this time, Sherlock can do nothing to prevent the intense blush that once again floods his cheeks.
“I don’t know, can you?” he says, that confidence deciding to manifest, apparently, as playful teasing.
. Your next move doesn’t have to be a career. It can just be a job. Something to do. You can find your calling later. It doesn’t have to happen right away, on a schedule. Just because other people are moving at a different pace doesn’t mean you have to match them.” He smiles reassuringly, hoping he’s saying the right things. “You don’t need answers right now.”
John smiles at him, then reaches out to take Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock tries not to tense when he senses the shifting tone.
John nodded, torn between mortified at his own role in Sherlock fainting and flattered by her last comment. “I’ll make sure he finishes the food.”
Sherlock ignored his sharp tone, too busy steeling himself to reveal everything to pay much attention to the warning John’s voice contained.
Finally, when the silence had lasted what felt like an age, John sighed. “Did you have something to tell me,
Sherlock’s hands are on his hips as he moves back into the room after the newcomer. “What do you want?”
Sherlock lifted his head, winced when the motion strained his injury, and called out, “Come in.” Best to get this over with.
John lay there without protest, feeling utterly miserable. His throat felt dry, his arms ached, and his entire body felt too cool. How could he be feverish if he felt this cold? It made no sense; Sherlock must be wrong.
He moves in and places a gentle kiss on Sherlock’s cheek, which draws an elated smile out onto Sherlock’s face.
"I..." John swallowed. "With Winter injured, and Sebastian... Well. I could take on some of their duties, if you'd like?"
Sherlock tugs him down the hall into a bedroom. John barely gets a look at the periodic table poster on the wall, the stack of books atop the chest of drawers, before shifting his gaze back to his boyfriend.
“Victor,” he said. “You did not know you had been discovered. And we have the chance to do something now. You cannot bring those men back, but you can ensure they did not die for naught.”
“I’m sorry, Sherlock,” Victor said. “I wish I could tell you more. But what I do know is they don’t just smuggle opium. They also carry weapons, and occasionally kidnap people.” Victor grimaced, and John felt a jolt in his gut at the thought.
How the hell had this happened? John whirled in a circle. There, up at the helm, lay a sailor. A harpoon protruded from his back. No wonder there had been no warning cry.
“Should he have?” Sherlock asked softly. He had a slight frown on his face, so John reached out and slid an arm around his waist.
“I’m so sorry, Sherlock,” Victor said. “I nearly got caught by the EIC. My story for why I had joined them was a bit dodgy, and they noticed. So I had to go into hiding for a year or so. When I felt safe enough, I reached out to Mycroft.”
“He was extraordinary,” John said. He wished he could say more, find properly eloquent words, but all words failed him at that moment. They would not have done Sherlock justice anyway.
“Alright, let me sail,” he scolded in a faux-severe tone. John chuckled and resumed his position behind Sherlock, again slinging his arms around him. They fell into a companionable silence for several minutes. On the main deck, most of the crew had started up a card game, sitting in a circle near the mizzenmast. That sight of his friends relaxed and laughing proved to John they were really, truly in the clear. The threat of the NOTP had been neutralized—without their leadership, they were helpless. A message from Mycroft had reported that, thanks to his own information and connections, the remaining operatives were under scrutiny by multiple governments. The East India Company, it seemed, was ecstatic. Mycroft was unsure how to feel about that, but he was assured that the world was a better place with only one trading programme in it.
Of course, John had done so much to have been denied the privilege of witnessing these things. The violence and anger and distrust he had shown Sherlock since the detective’s return, since Mary’s treachery was revealed, and since Mary had died, had pushed him to such a distance from Sherlock that it was remarkable for John to even be here at all, living in 221b.
If only Sherlock were here. John would love to watch his reactions to things, to hear perhaps what he has to say about some of the stories. Still, he understands why the chemistry student didn’t come; sharing opinions on writing, let alone sharing the writing itself, with anyone, can be nerve wracking. John himself had been terrified to hear what people had to say about his first book, until the generally positive reviews came out. Sherlock, who seems unused to sharing his feelings, clearly does not have the same level of confidence as John’s writers.
The crew laughed and cried out in agreement, and the music started up. Their footsteps, moving to the beat, reverberated through the ship’s deck.
Sherlock lowered his sword and approached. Concern flickered in his eyes. “Of course.” He helped John sit next to the helm and knelt beside him. “I fear I have pushed you too far today, John.”
. What good was he? He was a seasoned sailor, adept at all manner of ship duties, but he lacked a specialization. He could shoot a flintlock, but could not treat a wound or swing a sword well. How could he call himself a true sailor? He should have been able to help Winter, should have had the battle skills to step between her and Sebastian and block that last awful blow. Or he should have been able to rush forward and help stop the bleeding, help take care of the girl who had shown him nothing but kindness.
, learning. And experience at sea was at least as valuable as a university education. “What about food? Has he eaten today?”
“Why should I?” Sherlock hisses. His fists are clenched at his sides now. He watches Mycroft cross the room and survey it with mild disinterest, as if it were a rental listing he has not intended to visit and is only lingering in to be polite to the real estate agent.
“Well…” John purses his lips. “I don’t know, honestly. After the way they treated Harry when she was having her problems with alcohol, I… I just couldn’t deal with them anymore. I cut off contact back when I was still in uni.”
“Well, if you’re worried,” John says, keeping his voice soft and placating. He’s never seen Sherlock this manic. He steps forward tentatively. Sherlock moves backwards, though, still looking perturbed. “I think I’ve a fairly okay idea what I’m getting into. You’re handsome and brilliant. Just my type, really.”
Sherlock’s smile faded, though he nodded. John, heart sinking, sat up straighter. “Hey,” he said. “I’ll back off, if you want. This, what just happened, doesn’t have to happen again. I know I have a lot to make up for, a lot of trust to earn back. We can go at your pace.”
John looked unmoved, which made Sherlock feel even worse. “So what do you propose to do about it, now that we’re both on the same page about things? Gonna continue keeping me out of the loop? Or are you going to start acting like a proper, normal boyfriend?”
“Well, either way — thank you for being so encouraging. Where were you when I wrote all my other books?”
Christmas morning, those thoughts seem far away when John rolls over with a yawn to find Sherlock already awake and gazing at him. They don’t stay at each other’s flats every night, but when they do, waking up is John’s favourite thing to do. Sleepy Sherlock is surprisingly cuddly and affectionate.
?” he crinkles his nose, but soon has to join in John’s renewed laughter. They giggle together, still inches apart. Soon enough, John crowds close again as if pulled by a magnet. He locks their lips together once more.
The next morning, John enters the seating area of the graduation venue, where he spots Mycroft right away. He waves John over, and John gulps.
Sherlock tensed, but it was John who responded, pulling his own mobile from his pocket. He frowned as he read the text.
Sherlock edges closer to John on the sofa, taking a breath. He’s been considering this for days, and now the moment is here.
“But…” Sherlock frowns. “You told me you’ve always loved books. Writing. You wrote your first original story as a youth. You’ve never once mentioned anything related to the military, in any context.”
“I’ve got to see to something, I’ll be right back,” he said in an apologetic tone. “The papers are right there on the corner of my desk.”
He soon found an answer as new sounds reached his ears. Another ship, sleek and much smaller than their assailant, appeared in his peripheral vision, and he whirled in the water. It looked less aged than the enemy’s, perhaps the age of the
Meaning Sherlock was buffeted back and forth, a sheet of paper in a cyclone. Only occasionally would he be flung above the surface, barely long enough to gasp a desperate gulp of air before plunging back into the water.
Eventually, he had pressed his grief back into a deep part of himself, trying to move on with his life. He sailed, glad to be in charge of his own vessel, appreciative of the freedom it afforded him. He needed to work past the pain of losing Sherlock.
Looking back on all that time after he had left Sherlock, John remembered few details. Yes, there had been new places, acquaintances, and excitement, but even those things seemed duller than they should. What he did remember with utmost clarity was taking the bandages off his shoulder for the final time. He remembered taking the helm of the
“Since we’ve a few minutes until the ceremony starts, can I ask about your new book? Sherlock won’t tell me anything.”
“Sir.” He didn't bother to behave any more deferentially than that greeting and a swift nod; he and Lestrade had known one another for years and had long since dispensed with any real semblance of hierarchy between them, at least when speaking privately.
“No, it was at University of London, my alma mater. Besides, it would have been a couple years before you were even in uni.”
He climbed out of bed, movements only a little clumsy despite his weakness. John followed, curious. On Sherlock’s desk, which John had only spared a cursory glance the night before, was the scattered detritus of genius. There were diagrams and maps, more detailed than John had ever seen, that he suspected were drawn by Sherlock himself. Another pile of papers were titled
Irene Adler stood there in the doorway, looking flawless as usual. She smirked. “You need hobbies, my friends.”
Mycroft nodded curtly, then turned to depart. John watched him go, wondering fleetingly if perhaps, with all Mycroft’s connections and knowledge and influence, he had been responsible for this promotion.
’s crew are interested in women, and the others are tedious in their suspicions or prejudice against them. Besides…” his shoulders slumped, just a bit, just enough that John noticed. “I will not risk anyone else unduly. This is my fight more than anyone else’s.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes. He has seen the initial draft of the novel, but that was months ago. Since then, John has revised the entire second half with the help of his editor, James Sholto. And to Sherlock’s intense consternation, he hasn’t been allowed to see it yet. John keeps insisting he wait for the galley to come out, so Sherlock has been forced to subsist on what he can deduce from the questions John asks him, or comments John makes. Even John’s creative writing students at the university seem to know more about the new book than Sherlock. Not by much, but nonetheless, Sherlock feels left out.
Sherlock flinched. The memory of that night, so full of lighting and thunder and fury, had haunted him for three years. He had replayed it so many times he could have described the shape of the clouds, told the number of raindrops clinging to John’s lashes, and counted the heartbeats that passed during that awful exchange of words.
“Look, with this body,” Irene gestured to herself, in her rather form-fitting black top, with a proud raised eyebrow. “Anyone remotely interested in women notices me. Even those who don't usually notice that kind of thing. But Holmes? When I went to his office and turned on the charm, he didn't react at all like they usually do. He looked more... horrified than anything else.”
"Well," John rubbed the back of his neck. "I just thought, since you're through with school until next term starts in a month, and I've got the weekend off before the crazy Christmas incidents next week... I thought it'd be nice to, you know, celebrate. Spend some time, just the two of us."
“That’s just it!” John burst out. “It’s been three years! I thought you were dead, but you had no such ideas about me! How long would you have not sought me out? What if you hadn’t happened across us yesterday? Would I have
It seemed, however, that he did not need to. Sholto’s face fell, his lips tightening and shoulders sagging.
"No, it's alright," Sherlock smiled in response to John's worry, though he felt a clenching in his stomach at the look on the shorter boy's face. "Let's go."
’ stores would be strained quite severely. Sherlock and Irene declared that morning that it was to be half rations for all save the wounded, until they arrived at port. John’s men grumbled about this amongst themselves, but only until he gave them a stern look.
She twirled a thin rapier in her hands, and John wondered how she could make such a move seem so lewd. Perhaps it was something in her expression, the way she could look so wicked, enticing, and playful all at once.
“Here,” Sherlock extracted a bottle of amber liquid from a pocket. He took a quick swig, then proffered it to John.
— convinces John this man is indeed a blood relative of Sherlock’s. Because while they do not look alike, that expression, as if he is seeing far more than John can fathom, feels eerily familiar.
let its dark grey sails unfurl in the cold wind. It caught a favorable breeze as it angled toward the open sea and its next journey.
“So the rest of it…?” John began as they headed across the gently sloping grass as it transitioned into sand.
James Sholto sat in the infirmary, arms crossed and eyeing Hooper wearily. When John entered, both heads turned toward him.
Sebastian whipped his head around at the sound of the newcomer’s voice, and he could not suppress a small smile. Out from behind the brick structure that held the doorway, emerged Lestrade. His badge was clutched in his hand, and he approached with a wary step.
That night, all was dark in London. The streetlamps cast a soft golden light over the pavement, the breeze was light and cool, and on Baker Street all seemed still.
“Because,” John leaned in. “This ship is involved in treacherous business. If anyone in England, or Europe for that matter, heard that it exists, your own lives could be placed in jeopardy. The owners of the ship that destroyed the
Sherlock stares him down, trying to convince John without words to drop this subject, because he doesn’t think he can handle this. John just waits, gaze steady and earnest. And dammit, how can Sherlock refuse
John clapped him on the shoulder. His signs were still uncoordinated, but his words widened Ekene’s smile nonetheless. “Let’s take the
Molly returned in record time, with the bowl of water as well as a ration of biscuits, salted pork, and water. She faltered at the look on John’s face, which he was certain was frozen in a mask of shock.
Trying not to think about it any longer, he skims his work before realizing that it’s been several minutes since he has last heard Sherlock writing anything down. He looks up to find his boyfriend leaning back in his chair with his arms crossed. When John meets his gaze, he grins.
had been behind this all along. They had documents, falsified signatures, so much treacherous evidence, all of which ‘proved’ my father had been in league with them for years. They claimed he had gone behind their backs, secretly dealing with the ship captains, then altering the formal reports to hide his crimes.
Sherlock shakes himself out of that particular memory when John’s voice catches his notice. “Do you think his company is doing something… dunno, illegal?”
“A bit.” Sherlock finished the biscuit and began on the salted pork. “I’m sorry. What you were doing before this… with the kissing and all… that was… good.”
They chuckled then fell silent, both listening to the fire and enjoying their respective roles in the stroking of the hair.
On the paper was a sketch in charcoal, of Sherlock standing at the bow of the ship, which had its sails full. He had a small smirk on his face, his curls wild in the wind.
“Take it.” Sherlock twitches it in his hand. “I want you to read it. I think… I think it will show you some of the… sentimental side of myself.”
, covered in sharp growths and salt residue, had cut open his side with that last collision. Sherlock reckoned he had a few more minutes before he either was knocked out or otherwise wounded badly enough to die.
I would rescue them, and by extension, bring you aboard?” Sherlock felt his heart clench and his stomach twist. How had Moriarty, a man who had not spoken to Sherlock in years, know what he would do? Sherlock himself had not known what his decision was until the moment he had ordered the longboats to be dropped.
“Hope he isn’t insufferable next time. His story’s up for work-shopping next,” John says in an undertone to Sherlock.
He hesitated and lifted the scope to his eye once more. In the distance, he could discern the silhouette of a ship, and another shape in the water. Likely the victim of the attack, sinking.
Desiring to refresh his memory of the place, John pulled open the desk drawer to retrieve his private log. He flicked through the notes and stories he had jotted down over the past two years, then jumped as a slip of paper fluttered out of the pages onto the floor. Curious, he picked it up.
John twisted to find Moriarty looming over him as he made his way down the steps, several of which were catching on fire. The hilt of his sword was stained with blood, and John raised his hand to the site of the blow to realize it was his own; the man had hit him with the blunt end of the weapon.
“Ekene,” Sherlock said softly. He gazed around, then spotted the man standing next to John, and signed something with sharp movements.
“I’m not a sailor,” John said. Then, with Moriarty mesmerized, gaze fixed on him, his brown eyes shining in the light of the fires surrounding them, John moved. He lifted his own sword, pulled from the flames and now red-hot, and pressed the blade to the wound in his stomach. Steam rose, and he yelled as it burned and burned at his skin.
Donovan took over the department, and developed more than a grudging respect for Sherlock. John watched, incredulous, one day after a particularly grueling case wrapped, when Donovan smiled, clapped Sherlock’s shoulder, and asked him and John out for drinks.
As three deck hands untied the prisoner and began to lead him away, John saw Sebastian and Sherlock exchange a dark look, laced with utter loathing on both sides.
“Oh, come on, Greg. It was on his neck, near his collarbone. Odd place to spill chemicals or have brush against a flame, isn't it?”
Sherlock laughs. “John, I’m a chemistry student. I don’t have the formal training you and your students have. I can hardly even be considered a real poet. What does iambic pen-whatever mean?”
Sherlock always had been reserved, due to years of teasing in school. He’d learned to bottle up his feelings and deal with things on his own. Until John. For some magical, wonderful reason, Sherlock had opened up to John, within mere months of knowing him. Even after convincing himself he just might be a freak like everyone said, he let himself show John who he was. And for the entirety of their relationship, John had never stopped feeling grateful.
Sherlock swallowed, hardening his expression. “And because you knew Sholto was there, you had to destroy the
He loathes job applications to the same extent that he hates poor writing. He’d much rather eavesdrop on John’s half of the conversation.
Molly speculated that Holmes had had a previous life as a detective. “They always pick locks to check suspects’ houses!” she said. “Well, at least on the telly…”
“Oh, you don’t?” Sherlock snaps. He has that tone John has begun to recognize now, that lofty, dismissive tone he adopts when he feels cornered.
And so on. Sherlock didn’t dare delete them, in case he needed them - they were evidence, after all, and he was a detective - but he also now worried that John would notice them if he ever used Sherlock’s phone.
Now, the next morning, he could barely look at John. He wanted the other boy to stop looking so guilty every time he looked at Sherlock. It hadn't been a big deal, after all. Sherlock had gotten Sebastian off him before any real damage had been done, and yes, he had been a bit emotionally compromised last night, not to mention a little stabbed, but none of that was John's fault.
“Sherlock,” John cuts him off firmly, though he smiles, “you don’t have to defend your gift. It’s… well, honestly
“I know we just had cocoa,” John began, tangling his fingers in Sherlock’s hair. “But I think later we should go out.”
“I’ve sent him for Wiggins. I’ll see if there isn’t something more we can do for your wound.” Sherlock slipped his hands in his pockets and looked at John. His eyes seemed especially blue today.
John groaned in embarrassment as the other two had burst into more laughter. Sholto had signed an affirmative for Ekene, who also chuckled.
His legs protesting, he forced himself upright. He seized his coat off the back of a chair as he staggered across the room.
The weapons collided, reverberating. Then, they parted, swept out, and met once more. Over and over, Sherlock and John’s swords struck. This time, as opposed to his fight with Irene, John felt more confident. He could follow Sherlock’s weapon and even anticipate some of his next moves. Still, Sherlock was quicker, more practiced, able to execute motions John hadn’t seen or imagined. John struggled with both his sword and his feet to keep up with the mock-battle.
Systematically, John backed James up, sending blow after blow at him. At last, James’ back hit the railing, and he was forced to lean backward to avoid John’s next attack. He pushed back hard on John’s sword, and gained ground again. John retreated accordingly, watching Sholto’s feet and body language.
Last week, John had forgotten a date he and Sherlock had planned weeks before. He still hadn’t remembered.
Right on cue, the door swung open to reveal a ruffled consulting detective, wrapped in his usual dark coat and neck concealed by an old, ratty green scarf. Faint circles rested under his eyes, and a general air of exhaustion emanated from the young man.
He took John’s sword and wrapped a cloth about the blade. At John’s questioning glance, he rolled his eyes.
When they broke apart, John met his gaze. “I told you. I want to take care of you. I hope you don’t think this was a mistake, because I don’t. I should have kissed you years ago. Of course, maybe we weren’t ready then.”
“Wait, was that answer to the first question or the second?” John looked up at him with worry, though hints of amusement were beginning to infect his expression.
supposed to tell our professor about your sexual harassment of your lab partner?” He eyed Sebastian up and down. “And I see you spent the night on another binge of yours. Cheap alcohol too, ugh. And how do you feel, knowing your parents are going to stop funding your uni enrollment if you don’t start passing? Must be frustrating.”
The password turns out to be a long, complex series of numbers, symbols, and randomly capitalized letters. Sherlock has to call it out twice for John to get it right, but they get there in the end.
John’s heart seemed to stutter in his tightening chest. “Oh, Sherlock,” he breathed in a quavering voice. “You could have died.”
“Thanks,” John ducked his head. Had Mycroft said the same thing to his brother the last time he had left London? Only to learn he would never come home again?
, John thought to himself. It had been too long since he had been out there, in the endless expanse of blue. Four months, in fact, of being back on land, attending various functions in stuffy London parlors. Four months of pandering to rich nobles, fending off simpering rich women looking to make a marriage to a handsome, famous Navy man for themselves or their children (or on one memorable occasion, their mother). Four months on hard, stable land, feeling suffocated.
“What about him?” Sherlock’s reply was sharper and louder than he intended, but he could not deny the way ice seemed to crystallize in his chest at the sound of the name. “What’s happened?”
Before either of them could speak again, however, Sherlock’s phone buzzed on the table. They looked at each other.
“And I warn you, Sebastian,” his voice dropped to its deepest rumbling growl yet. “If I see you again, if you come near any of my crew, I will ensure that you regret I did not kill you right here on this deck.”
“You told me that,” John nods, glancing at the book as well. “And I like to believe I would have figured that out, considering…”
He sat up and they smiled at one another for a moment. “If you want to clean yourself,” he continued, voice bright. “Let me show you something.”
Something twisted in Sherlock’s expression then, so quick John almost missed it. But he didn’t, and realization set in without warning. The look in Sherlock’s eyes, the genuine tone of his voice, made him believe the man. He may be a pirate, but he might actually be truthful about his worry over his friend.
John turns to face him, surprise springing to his face, but Sherlock plows on, “We had an anatomy class together our last year before going to uni. He was less moronic than the rest of my so-called peers. We went on several dates, if you can call them such at age seventeen. They mostly consisted of pretending to study in my bedroom but actually snogging.
“You weirdos talking about your pet obsession again?” another voice chipped in, and everyone looked around.
“Sherlock?” he yelled. He raised his bleeding arm, trying to keep the smoke and blinding light of the flames from reaching his eyes. He coughed hard. “Sherlock!”
Sherlock blinks but smiles. John radiates sincerity, and something about that fact makes Sherlock lower his guard again. “Alright.”
“India, actually.” Sherlock’s cheeks were pinker now, which John took to be a good sign. “She was training to be a doctor there where she lived with a lover, named Tom, until it ended badly. We ran into one another and I offered her passage. She may be our doctor only temporarily, but we are glad to have her.” He cleared his throat, blushing harder. “So… You've changed,” he noted with raised eyebrows.
Strange, he mused once it became clear that John had drifted off, that he could be snuggled in a soft bed with the warmth of his boyfriend all around him, and still feel so alone.
More specifically, he had a fleet of cannons to sabotage, and perhaps—if circumstances favoured him—a certain captain to face.
He locked their lips together this time, and John moved close, desperate suddenly to feel Sherlock, his breath and heart and the very blood in his veins. Sherlock allowed him to arrange him in any way he chose, pliant and soft under his hands, but still kissing back with eagerness. After a moment, he broke away from John’s mouth to again turn his attention to the shoulder scar.
John smiled as Sherlock nosed at his throat and dropped dozens of light kisses onto his skin. Their engagement was set, which was good enough for John, especially when in the present he had a very cuddly fiancé in his arms.
“Are you okay?” John asked from where his face was buried in the crook of Sherlock’s neck. “Is it bad?”
!” he snapped suddenly. Sherlock stiffened as Moriarty’s smile twisted into a glare, sharp and piercing. “Sir Trevor, that boring buffoon, was not my real father, and you know it. My actual father, now, he was the real man.”
John stepped closer, reaching for him. Sherlock went into his embrace, feeling a weight lift from his chest. He felt like he could dance. They stood there in silence for several moments, savoring the feel of each other. Sherlock felt his irritation seep away, replaced by soft relief.
Sherlock chuckles, ducking his head. “Yes, I suppose. I was just a child when I thought I might study forensics. I thought that for years.”
“You okay?” John asks, placing his foot over Sherlock’s again. He wants to take his hand, but is unsure if Sherlock would be comfortable with that. Then again, he had allowed it on their first date, so…
Sherlock shrugs, as if it somehow is not a bother to deal with this torn object—John won’t even call it bag anymore, now that it’s closer and he can see how sad it is. “I haven’t got around to replacing it.”
drugged—with a small smile on his face. And… that face. Sherlock usually barely noticed people beyond what he could deduce about them, but this man he couldn’t help but notice. Unassuming, plain-looking by most definitions, but somehow still striking. Handsome. And… vaguely familiar?
Upon hearing this news Sherlock had been quiet all evening, lost in contemplation. John hadn't pressed him. He knew thinking about the man brought back bad memories, ones full of fear and distress. So John had stayed close but did not intrude. Then, while they had sat on the sofa together, Sherlock's head had dropped to John's shoulder. John had turned from his novel to find Sherlock watching him, an undefinable look on his face. John had reached over and gently began rubbing the back of Sherlock's neck.
He didn’t know what this was about, but it sounded as if her day had been at least as delightful as his.
“John,” Irene’s voice next to him made him jump. He spun on his heel to find her and Ekene watching him.
So Sherlock finds his hand and squeezes it before placing it on his own hip. John takes the hint, sliding his arm across Sherlock’s back and bringing them closer together. “Not precisely,” Sherlock says. “But it did occur to me that it’s customary in most relationships to have… said those words by now.”
“I would,” he murmurs, and moves to retrieve his notebook from his bag. Digging it out, finding the right page, and handing it to John is less graceful than he’d have hoped, but John is kind enough not to comment. He only slides an arm around Sherlock’s waist and reads the poem silently. Sherlock resists the urge to fidget.
John, meanwhile, is staring at Sherlock. His countenance is surprised, but also delighted and proud.
Sherlock glared at him. How could he ask this? After everything he had done, to Sherlock’s family, to Sherlock, to John?
Sherlock’s eye roll was so obvious as to be physically palpable. “Well, I am glad you are enjoying yourself. I only request you do not get yourself mortally wounded anymore. It is growing rather tiresome.”
“Lead the way then, boyfriend,” John declares, just to watch Sherlock’s flustered expression show itself once more.
. We are bound for India. We found you today, drifting. What is your name? How did you come to be in that situation?”
Yet at the same moment, while Sholto gives him a much warmer smile now and points him down an aisle, Sherlock wonders.
Then, the captain appeared, apparently having been below-decks. He skidded to a halt, and his eyes flashed across the scene, taking in the furious crew holding Sebastian down and the blood on the deck before landing on Winter.
“You can’t blame me for this, though. I haven’t done anything wrong,” he crossed his arms, definitely angry now. “You should have told me.”
The door downstairs opening and closing made him jump. His mind kicked into gear without hesitation, as if he weren’t emotionally devastated. It wouldn’t be Mrs. Hudson; she was visiting her sister this week. And this person had used a key, so that meant, surely it had to mean... John was back.
“If you prefer working with other students, you may join another pair,” Holmes continued. “But if you do not mind working alone, you may.”
Mr. Holmes — William — steps forward and gives John a warm handshake. He’s Sherlock’s height, wearing a jaunty bowtie and a grin. “The famous John, at last we meet. Do you know, I’ve read all your books.”
Well, perhaps not everything. John frowned as he climbed up the stairs leading from the Tube, the tall form of Bart’s looming larger and larger as he neared street level. He did have to admit his schedule had prevented him from relaxing as much as he’d used to. He and Sherlock hadn’t been spending as much time together as maybe they should have been. But, he reminded himself as he shoved his hand into his pocket for his ID badge - rather more aggressively than strictly necessary - that did not excuse Sherlock’s behavior.
Sherlock scowls, but nods. “Fine.” He clearly is attempting to maintain a serious expression, but John sees his lip twitch. He is not fooling John with his haughty air.
“I could go in your stead,” he retorted, seizing on the first solution that came to him. “Or Victor, or Irene, or someone.”
“Good to see you again, John,” Mycroft says. It doesn’t even sound like a lie. He’s spoken with the elder Holmes sibling a number of times, though none so memorable as the first time, when Mycroft had offered to pay John to keep him informed about Sherlock’s life. Since then, he’s always put John a bit on guard.
"John," Sherlock bit his lip, the lip which John had just been kissing only moments ago (kissing!). "It's fine. I... I liked it."
“What would be the point of that? When we board the ships, the point is to fire a warning shot, isn’t it?”
This is it. He’s ruined everything, finally driven John off. He’s known all along it would come to this. John is too good for him, so why on earth would he stay? He won’t fight for Sherlock, not after this. Not after already expressing frustration with him, after saying he wants Sherlock to be better — to be
Sholto doesn’t fidget exactly, but Sherlock can see in the tension of his shoulders and the set of his mouth that this isn’t a conversation either one of them want to have.
The longest silence yet followed that speech. Molly dragged the zipper nearly closed on her pencil case and shoved it in her bag. She shouldn't wait; she should leave now and tell Greg what she'd heard. But then-
Sebastian turns to face John, who is smiling a dangerous smile. “We haven’t, no,” he says, voice sickeningly sweet.
“Never mind,” he murmured. “Rest now, and we can speak of this in the morning. I will ensure you are well-cared for. When you feel strong enough, you may have a berth in the crew’s quarters. For tonight, I’d rather have my ship doctor monitor you.”
I bought this ship partially made. A shipbuilder in Ireland was destitute, desperate. We had enough pilfered coin and goods to fund the rest of the construction. She is small, only needs a crew of twenty or so. However, I have organized it so if needed, it can be run with only a handful.”
“Mum was secretly happy I was safe. She admitted it once on the phone. Dad… well, he just didn’t talk about it. He barely talked to me again.”
John looked back at Irene, who watched the woman with a surprisingly tender expression on her face. When she glanced at John, however, she waggled her eyebrows in a suggestive manner. John felt his face heat and was sure it had turned bright red.
Then, John moved forward again, reaching out. This time, Sherlock allowed himself to be tugged forward, almost pressed flush against John. Their eyes met, then Sherlock's gaze flicked down to John's lips.
He wanders through the rows, eyeing the numbers on spines until he finds the correct section. Luckily, this library is well stocked, and he ends up with four tomes in his arms in a few minutes.
Sherlock, for all his deductive powers, could not determine what his own boyfriend might be thinking anymore.
“Nothing, just... “ he frowned as he tried to decide how best to broach this subject, especially so early in the morning. “I was wondering what I’m going to do next year, when we’re probably living in different places.”
John shifted closer, placing his head on Sherlock’s pillow so he could be near enough to kiss him. And for a few minutes, everything was morning breath and stubble and bed-warm skin. And it was all glorious.
Satisfied, he set down his compass and pencil and rubbed the bridge of his nose with a sigh. How long had it been since they had been to India? He was not sure; it must have been at least six months.
Part of him wondered what it would be like, to be one of those renegades. Dangerous line of work to be sure, but still. What must it be like to be able to sail the seas without having to answer to anyone?
“I know.” John throws caution to the wind now; he moves close and takes Sherlock’s face into his hands, cradling that beautiful jaw, stroking those stunning cheekbones. “I know.” He sighs heavily. “Come here.”
“Do you feel well enough to step outside? It’s more comfortable than in here.” Holmes nodded up toward the deck.
“You know what I mean,” John said. “I should have been there for you much earlier. I should never have let things get to that point, where you felt like you couldn’t
“Hello, Watson,” a voice called. He turned and spotted a young woman he knew. She called herself Winter, and she—along with a boy named Bill Wiggins—had tended to his wound in turns. It seemed Sherlock had ordered the two of them to care for John as best they could. John had, in spite of himself, taken to her. She seemed kind and thorough in her efforts to keep the bleeding stemmed, though according to her, she was simply a deckhand and a poor substitute for their late doctor. While she worked on John’s shoulder, she always hummed. Her bright attitude had made the infirmary seem a bit brighter, if only for the short time she was there.
John mirrored Sherlock’s earlier motion, reaching up and touching Sherlock's face. Warm, solid, alive. “I thought you were dead.” The words felt like a confession, a ridiculous notion now that the man stood before him.
“He ended up playing it off as some kind of elaborate dating ritual, that it was a Brighton tradition. I wish I could remember the details I came up with, but I know it involved a goose and some kind of gemstone as the origin story.”
That makes John laugh. He squeezes Sherlock’s hand, and something in his expression makes Sherlock’s heart clench. Being the recipient of such affectionate looks is… remarkable in its unprecedented nature, to say the least.
Sherlock's eyebrow lifted toward his hairline. "Is it?" He asked, tone a bit too knowing for comfort.
“You are not defective!” John jerks back to clutch at Sherlock’s shoulders, eyes afire. “Don’t you say that.”
But by the time another hour had passed, the entire crew was on alert. The fact they were being followed was obvious now to all on board. Everyone muttered about how the strange ship loomed on the horizon, maintaining the same distance all the while. Odd behaviour, all agreed.
“Gladly,” the man whispered, breath ghosting over Sherlock’s skin. He stepped back a bit then, and set his lantern on a hook dangling from the ceiling.
Sherlock stretched out his legs next to his boyfriend's, and the detective hooked one around John's ankle as he reclined beside John.
John wanted to scowl at him, but the mirth in Sherlock’s eyes was impossible to resist. So he laughed, softly, into the crook of his neck, then moved up to nip at his earlobe. “You’re right, sorry. But if you want me to keep quiet, you’ll have to be less tempting.”
“What are you talking about?” Could John be serious? Could he really be fighting for them? For Sherlock? Sherlock had never thought of himself as someone anyone would want to fight for.
"That's fine," John said quickly. "That's perfectly alright. I... I don't want to mess things up with you."
“You seem to be sensible. Surely you have discerned by now that my brother is unique. He thinks differently than most people. I cannot tell why he might have elected to throw his lot in with you…” Mycroft pauses appraisingly, stare still unwavering. “But it seems he has made a decision he has never made before in terms of… relationships. Therefore, I wonder if you might do me a service.”
“This is important work, John,” Sherlock grumbled as he turned back to his work. “I’m attempting to develop a way to suppress the sound of a gunshot.”
“It’s over,” Sherlock murmured. When he turned back to John, he was smiling. He was still disheveled, bloody, and soaked. But the look of awe on his face, the exhilaration, the relief, made him stunning.
John saw no choice but to obey. Sherlock gently pulled aside his shirt, then peeled back the wrappings. John glanced down. His wound was smarting and an angry red shade to match, strangely tinted darker in other places. It seemed to be closing up, but not entirely. He supposed his exertion may have kept it from healing as well as it could have. And the poultice appeared to not have changed a thing.
Lestrade would likely have access to information, surveillance, and databases that Sherlock didn’t, but… he hesitated to bring it to anyone’s attention. He’d promised himself he could deal with this, and besides, there were no solid threats. If Sebastian was planning something, Sherlock couldn’t deduce through his texts what it is. So he felt there wasn’t much to bring to Lestrade even if he wanted to.
Sherlock nods. “I am. Besides, considering what I’ve seen of the ‘competition,’ as you say, I want no part of any of them.”
“You’re sexy,” John holds up a finger with each item in his list. (Yes, he is definitely still inebriated; he only calls Sherlock “sexy” after having at least two drinks.) “You’re a total genius, you’re pretty, you like my books, you write poetry…”
“I…” But Sherlock’s heart was pounding so hard he couldn’t hear himself think, let alone form a coherent answer to appease the man.
Sherlock was unnaturally still. “Auburn hair, tall. Seven and twenty years old, or he would be now. Nothing?”
“Perhaps I am, Captain Watson,” Sherlock teased, and John shivered in anticipation at the implication.
He fixes his gaze on Sherlock, who’s curled up on the floor beside him. They ended up on the rug of 221B a while ago, though to be honest, John can’t quite remember how or why. Somewhere around his third cup of Sherlock’s homemade mulled wine, he’s lost track of what’s going on.
“I… I know you carry notebooks, but you do most of your actual writing on the computer,” Sherlock rushes through his explanation, fiddling with a bit of discarded ribbon. “And I thought, if you got on a roll — not that you can type very fast—” he rolls his eyes, “but it’s… you know, another option. And you can get to the internet of course—”
“Yes, the first time we met, or a version of it, at least,” Sherlock said. His fingers danced along the rim of his cup, the handle. His eyes reflected the flickering fire. “I was in the lab at Bart's, and then Mike Stamford was there, and then... you.”
“John,” Sherlock whispered. His forehead creased, his mind apparently working hard and quick. His fingers lifted as if to touch the mark, but stopped so close John could feel the air move by the wound. He held John’s gaze. “I fear this needs more treatment than we can provide.”
So they heat their water (using different mugs, to be safe) in the microwave, laughing about the tea blasphemy. This is by far the easiest, most comfortable morning John has ever had at a new lover’s home, he realizes. In fact, everything feels easy with Sherlock. Something about him seems to just
Sherlock inclines his head. “Probably for the best, at least for your relationship with other apparently important writers. Sparing their egos, on the other hand…” he grimaces, as if that is not high on his list of priorities.
So much had changed in such a short time. Had someone told him just a fortnight ago that he would feel himself comfortable upon a pirate ship, even defensive of the captain’s motivations and fond of the crew, John would have hit them.
He stepped away and noticed Irene addressing several of her pirates. He suspected, from the way she gestured, adamant, that she was giving them much the same lecture about keeping the peace that he just had.
“To sea,” he grinned as he thumped John on the back. “We’ll be back out there soon enough. And we’d love to have you back.”
“I’m not some helpless-” Sherlock began, but at that moment, a noise cut him off and closed off his throat.
and wondering where she was now. Wondering if, perhaps, Sherlock was thinking of him in this moment. Fanciful as the thought was, it still pleased John. Both he and Lestrade were silent for a moment, lost in their own—rather divergent—thoughts of pirates.
“No!” Sherlock repeated. His struggling intensified, but was to no avail; Sebastian’s grip was too strong.
“No, John don’t be an idiot,” he insists. “Your books are… well—” He stutters to a halt, abruptly unsure how to speak.
John giggles, and Sherlock feels his own spirits uplifted by the sound. “So, I take it you had time to get some writing done earlier?”
An hour later, or perhaps it was just a few seconds or maybe an entire year, Sherlock was still in the sitting room. He’d moved to his chair and remained there, wrapped in his coat and staring straight ahead. He felt numb all over, a condition that had set in the moment the front door had slammed on John.
John sets down the spatula and grabs Sherlock for a quick kiss. “It’s called breakfast in bed for a reason, yeah? Go lie down.”
The chivalry was acceptable, Sherlock supposed, but he couldn’t help feeling just a bit coddled. He was young, yes, but he wasn’t a
A click made John’s gaze dart to the side. A tall figure waited, a gun in his hand. John sighed and released the man. This was not worth being shot over; John had now had enough experience with bullet wounds and their effects for a lifetime.
Sherlock smirked, but the light feeling between them lasted mere seconds as his smile turned into a frown, intense and serious. The amusement faded too from John’s heart as the reality set in. If even Sherlock was worried, had seen this kill someone before, it must be serious.
They end up discussing the book for nearly another hour. As the minutes pass, Sherlock relaxes in John’s reassuring presence. The writer is an excellent audience as well as skilled at discourse, providing insights and feedback from such a unique point of view: the creator of these stories, these characters, this world. However, Sherlock is startled by the way John seems to see his books: as mere entertainment.
“Maybe,” Sherlock muttered, flashing her a dark look now. John couldn’t decide if it was because of her teasing, innuendo-laced tone, or her proximity to John.
Ever since nearly losing Sherlock - the attentions of a vengeful stalker only somewhat to blame - John had fought to do better, to be there more, to text during breaks and on public transport. He'd made conscious effort to put Sherlock first, make their relationship the priority it had been in the early stages. And in turn, Sherlock had worked hard to open up more, share his feelings and worries and events in his daily life.
Sherlock is already waiting by the time John arrives at their determined place of meeting. He has swapped his leather bag for the newer one, and has left behind the textbooks and notes.
On the floor next to the chair sat a baby monitor, though John could hear no noises from the other end, just a quiet hum. Rosie was sound asleep too, and John smiled as he imagined Sherlock putting her to bed — always so gentle and doting, in a way John had never believed Sherlock could be until Rosie happened.
Sherlock smiled, though he felt he might also be blushing. “This is… not exactly the way I imagined meeting you.”
He paused a moment, just looking up into Sherlock’s face and chewing on his lower lip. “Come on,” he finally muttered. They settled onto his small, old sofa. Sherlock watched with curiosity at the way John moved. His shoulders were tensed, but his touch was soft and gentle. So he couldn’t be angry with Sherlock, but seemed to be concerned about something related to Sherlock.
The instant they were alone, something in Sherlock’s expression softened. “John.” He stared at John as if he had been bidden to memorize him.
Greg thought hard. It only took a moment for the memory to return to him — the only other male who spoke in the class, the others else half asleep or unwilling to speak up about the portrayal of women in literature. The boy had been bright, and often funny. Greg remembered more than once laughing under his breath at the analogies the boy would make in his analyses.
He swallows, and John’s heart clenches at the sight. “Hey,” he says. “We can go as slow as you like. We can just—”
Sherlock felt a shiver track up his spine. Those words, both said and unsaid, kept reverberating in his mind. John’s voice, full of desperation and worry and concern and affection, made him want to turn back. He nearly wanted to abandon this quest, and just let himself be held by the one man who had looked at Sherlock and seen someone extraordinary.
laughed and conversed loudly around him. Ekene had invited John to sit with him, Winter, Wiggins, and a few others, but John had declined. He was not much in the mood for socializing with pirates at the moment. Ekene had shrugged and returned to his friends, patting John rather kindly on his good arm as he had left.
“It’s personal,” John cut in before he could try again. “Sherlock’s being followed and threatened. We’re trying to find where he is so we can get him locked up again.” As he spoke, he shot an annoyed look at Sherlock.
“No!” Rosie shrieked with the laugh that meant one of her fathers was saying something especially silly. “That’s not how it works! Your Valentine is someone you love!”
. I could see the potential, if only I could get my hands on you. You long for freedom, and I can give you that. But noooooo, you still refuse! So boring. You’re on the side of the angels after all.”
Sherlock swallows hard, burrowing into John’s embrace. “I…” He trails off, though, as if at a loss for what to say now.
“The pleasure was mine, Molly,” John waves at her as she makes to depart. He turns back to Sherlock, whose face still is decidedly ruby.
“It’s okay,” he said. Then, when he saw John’s eyes flick down to Sherlock’s lips, he leaned forward and brushed their lips together. “I was waiting for you,” he added, then kissed John again.
John and the others retreated as Sherlock stalked toward the mizzenmast. Sebastian didn't move, only stared daggers at his captain.
When he opened his eyes, everything was too bright, too blindingly white. Ugh. Sterile scents, white tile, plastic furniture. He was in the hospital.
The past day or so, though, John had forgotten those feelings. Or rather, he thought, he had pushed them away, buried them beneath all his anger and resentment and fear.
Sherlock wrenched his gaze from John to Victor. His jaw dropped, though his grip on John barely loosened. “Victor?”
"Well, yeah," John shrugged and struggled out of the enticing grasp of the pillows, blankets, and boyfriend's hands. "It's a magical creation. Besides, I'm making one of the drinks for you. So it's fine."
“So you pretended to befriend me,” Sherlock said. He knew he should be fighting, getting off this wretched ship before something worse happened than mere threats, but his mouth seemed to be working of its own accord. He had to spell it out, had to understand everything. He had to know why he had not seen this coming.
“Sherlock!” Irene screamed. Breathless, John stood and looked around. She knelt, Winter’s head in her lap, and was stroking her hair. The red-haired woman had a cloth pressed to the bloody wound in the girl’s side.
“Wanted to make sure you were alright.” John leaned forward so their noses knocked together. Sherlock smiled. “Are you?”
"John!" Sherlock's cheeks turned pink in an instant, though for all his pretending at offense, he was still laughing.
John swallowed, pushed down the sour taste Sherlock’s words brought on. He forced himself to consider what else Sherlock said.
Sherlock was so wrapped up in his thoughts that he barely noticed that John left the room, only surfacing when the DI then immediately turned to Sherlock.
She raised her weapon, eyes sparkling. She was young, barely eighteen years of age, but bright and capable. In battle, however, John could not help but feel skeptical.
It’s from Molly, and Sherlock purses his lips and just barely manages to keep from groaning aloud. He had been fortunate that morning, the assignment they had been given in lab sufficiently complicated and time-sensitive that there had been little time to chat, even with one’s lab partner, about anything not science-related. Sherlock had made sure he only spoke about the experiment, maintaining a perfectly professional manner the entire time. Then, as soon as they had finished, he’d dashed out, ignoring her amused and exasperated calls after him. He had hoped that would be the end of it for now.
“John Watson!” A pair of middle-aged women come forward, and one begins gushing. “Oh, we’re such big fans of yours! I didn’t realize you would be here today!”
And the way he looks at Sherlock… Sometimes Sherlock hates how well he can deduce, because he can nearly read John’s mind. John looks so confused, as if he cannot understand how could someone as brilliant and insightful and witty and fascinating as Sherlock believe he is so horrible.
And without warning, Sherlock is reminded of something he read in one of John’s own books. A quote, spoken by Sherrinford to James Sacker when he’d watched a client hesitate to enter.
Sherlock shrugged, his cheeks warming. “It’s just… it’ll be the end of term in a few months, and both our leases are up. Most students in our year will be moving to different accommodations, especially you, since you’re going to be doing your work at one of the teaching hospitals next year, so I thought you’d want to move farther into the city…”
Sherlock turned his head slowly to meet the gaze of the man who stood behind him. The warm golden light of a lantern cast strange shadows over his face. He was pale, a few years older than Sherlock, and had a face that was hard with malevolence.
But another volley swept down over them, and John ducked under the boat to avoid it. He opened his eyes beneath the water, and immediately wished he had not; human forms drifted, horribly still in death. Bullets and harpoons shot through the water, and left thin trails of bubbles in their wake. The boom of the cannons, though muffled now, still sent chills through John.
Wait. What? Sherlock cranes around the crowd once more, gazing at the side of John’s face. Yes, it really was
John shook his head, sighing. “It wasn’t you.” He eased off Sherlock and sat back on his heels. Sherlock tucked his legs under himself and shifted close again.
He waited, hands clasped over the handle of his umbrella in front of him. John stared back. The light was dim, and growing ever dimmer as the sun retreated, but John could still distinguish the man’s features. The nose, the face shape, the hair color—all unlike Sherlock’s. It was difficult to believe this man and the pirate captain could be related.
She entered to find her professor sat at a small desk in the back corner of the room. The rest of the space, with low slanting ceilings, was taken up by three other desks. None of the others were occupied at that time of the afternoon, but Molly could still imagine that when all were occupied, it was rather crowded.
But that reaction sent a half-embarrassed giggle through Sherlock, and he bit his lip to contain it. However, soon both were giggling through their blushes. Sherlock ducked his head and hid it in the crook of John’s shoulder.
John let out a surprised laugh. “Love, you know that bet was only for a month? You won by, like, almost double.”
"Ah." John nodded. His stomach plummeted through the deck into the bitter sea below. "So you and him..."
Sherlock continued to work for several minutes. “Ah ha,” he said with a small grin of satisfaction. “Now we’re in. Alright, Baker Street, half seven yesterday…”
John swallowed. “Good.” He surveyed Sherlock, then looked away as if the sight of him was somehow painful. “You should go to bed. You look like you’ve had a long day.”
“Probably around here somewhere…” John trails off with a glance at the bookshelves, and his eyes widen slightly at something he sees in Sherlock’s face. “Oh, no. Don’t you dare even think about looking for it. You’re forbidden!”
Sherlock nods, clutching his new book—he’d finally settled on the Davy biography, after much deliberation and some input from John—to his chest. John squeezes his arm and starts to step away.
A moment later, Sherlock slumps against the pillow and drags his fingers through his hair. He can practically hear John telling him to stop “mussing those gorgeous locks,” but he ignores the thought. Because what the hell is he thinking? He is Sherlock Holmes, and although he has promised to open up to John, he cannot pine and moan to himself about
The words “I love you” were a surprisingly long time in coming. Rosie was six (and a quarter, as she would insist on reminding them whenever her age was mentioned) when they finally arrived.
He hoped it wasn't just him. He hoped desperately, while he added dollops of whipped cream and sprinkles of cinnamon to their drinks, that Sherlock felt the same way.
He sets the book on his lap, scoops his phone off the table, and unlocks it. John replied to his earlier messages the following morning—
After nearly an hour, John pauses to take off his reading glasses, rub his eyes, and massage his hand. As he does so, he marvels at the atmosphere. This is… comfortable, familiar, as if they’ve done this a hundred times and now take it for granted. In reality, they’ve only worked side by side like this a handful of times, and always in one of their flats rather than in public.
Sailors went about their work, barely glancing at him and Holmes. They appeared to know that John was the captain’s business, and stepped out of the way with brief respectful nods. Then, John performed a double-take when he noticed something unexpected about the crew.
“I should have come to you,” Sherlock tried again to explain. “I should have told you, or someone. But I,.. guess I thought I could handle it. I thought I wouldn’t have to bother anyone else. I thought it wasn’t a problem for anyone else.”
“Lieutenant John Watson,” he replied, a bit reluctant to give this man any information, but also not seeing another choice.
Her smile vanished, and her eyebrow rose. “I think you’d better take that up with the Captain. He…” she cleared her throat. “He did not authorize me or Billy to tell you anything of that nature.”
He didn't yet know how they would continue to consult together, even though John would struggle sometimes to balance the hospital and the cases, or how messy their kitchen table would become, coated in the detritus of Sherlock's brilliant experiments and a half-dozen coffee cups.
John rose to his feet again, firing back at the other ship. He scanned its decks, seeking a captain, a lieutenant, or anyone who looked to be in charge. But the
He looked like a cat, John thought as he took off his shoes and closed the door. Like a sleepy house cat who had run itself ragged chasing mice and scratching chair legs and had finally found a safe, warm corner to curl up in.
John stared at her, determined not to look at Sherlock yet. “Of course I do, honeybee.” That was a nickname coined by Sherlock, which had instantly caught on among everyone else who knew Rosie. “Why?”
“You know what I mean!” John cries. “You never offer anything up, any of the usual things you tell someone you’re in a relationship with! You never tell me how you’re feeling, or thinking. I know you like me, like spending time with me, but I feel like I don’t know
Another silence passed. Molly stood, her belongings finally gathered in her arms. Then, just as she turned to leave, Holmes spoke once more.
Then again, John mused, even if he did come to find them again, John knew he would be ready. And he had a feeling Lestrade would as well.
“The rest’ll either have sunk or is still on the way toward shore. There’s a chance we could get more here, I suppose, but you never know. I just wanted you to have a look at it, in case it’s one of your lot. Get word to the proper authorities, you know?”
John holds him tight for a minute, wordless and working up the courage to speak. Then, Sherlock shifts. “You’re thinking rather loudly. Out with it.”
John scoffs, frustrated. He hates that he’s getting angry, but Sherlock isn’t giving him a chance to feel anything else. “That’s only a valid excuse for so long, Sherlock. I’m just asking you to try to let me in! Just a bit! It’s not that hard!”
“Do you think they're... planning to board us?” another asked, shifting his weight from one foot to the other. His question sent a ripple of concerned muttering through those gathered.
At the railing of the pirate ship, Sherlock’s lover wrapped his fingers around a rope, leaped up and over the railing, and soared through the air toward the
Sherlock’s gaze whipped back up to John’s face, though John had the distinct impression he had been looking at a place lower on John’s body instants before. A slight curl of his lips appeared as the pirate glanced down at John’s chest.
“It’s my fight too,” John said. He stroked a thumb across Sherlock’s cheekbone. “Are we prepared? It’ll be a difficult battle.”
Startled, John laughs, and even Sherlock’s lips twitch. “I’ll consider that next time,” John says, approaching again. This time, Sherlock lets him, meeting him halfway and slipping his arms around John’s waist.
