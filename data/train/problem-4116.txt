“The Christmas Tree lot, duh,” Dean said, fake pulling Cas up by his shoulders. “We have to go now and get a good one before it’s only Charlie Browns left.”
Then Cas nearly moaned at his first sip and Dean suddenly choked on his. Cas’ eyebrows danced upwards and although Dean couldn’t see himself, he was pretty sure his cheeks were steaming in the cold, a red-hot blush streaking across. Cas murmured a thank you, Dean before his next sip, if only to break the silence. Dean shrugged, but now Cas had a lick of whipped cream on his nose. Dean’s hands fidgeted at his side — “you ugh, Cas you gotta little”—before coming up to wipe it off with his index. Cas’ nose crinkled and now Dean turned around, desperate to cool his face off. He pretended to look at the tree beside them. Rubbed a branch between his fingers. Note to self: More hot chocolate for Cas.
------------
"Hey you’re back. I was beginning to worry." Sam says from his bed, not bothering to look up from his book.
Dean hears the sound, breaking the kiss and swiveling his head around until he comes face to face with Cas’ camera, outstretched on Cas’ hand. Cas clearly caught them on camera making out, and Dean was speechless. Cas simply grinned and put the ejected film into his pocket.
“Well, Cas, nobody asked you to. I don’t know if you noticed, but you’re not my fucking babysitter.” Dean spits. Dean turns on the music. blaring it. Cas turns it off.
“Why won’t you love me?” Cas says into Dean’s chest, burying his face into his shirt. “....Why can’t you love me?”
Cas speaks quietly now. “Is...Is that what you really came to say?”
Dean’s lips are soft, but they go still under Cas’. Cas pulls back. Fear flashes across his face, his toying grin having fallen flat. He goes to blurt out an apology but Dean silences him, slamming his lips back into Cas’—greedy and needy and wet. The tube drops out of Cas’ hand and ricochets off of Dean’s shoulder but neither of them notice. Dean’s arm has already wrapped around Cas’ waist, pulling him completely flush against his own body. Cas feels himself go completely lax, feels himself fall into Dean, let’s Dean completely surround him with his arms. His hand comes to wrap around the back of Dean’s neck and grip there and Dean moans into Cas, breathless and wanting. It sets something off in Cas immediately and he pushes into Dean. They slam back against the bathroom wall. The sink is digging into his lower back but it’s a far off echo against the feel of Dean’s body. Dean’s tongue flicks across Cas’ lower lip and Cas opens instantly, letting Dean in.
“I think I’ve waited longer,” Dean says, pulling Cas back up to lock lips again, deepening it now. Cas slides his fingers in between Dean’s and pins Dean’s hands above his head, pushing further into his hips. Dean groans and bucks forward. Dean nearly bites off Cas’ tongue when Sam raps sharply on the greenhouse window. The two of them turn in shock and with the biggest shit-eating grin, Sam gestures dinner’s ready and then immediately flees.
Cas swallowed. “Do you think he—” but Dean was already getting up, moving away from the couch towards his room.
“A very long time,” Cas says, a smile creeping back over his lips. “...you?” He knew the answer but he wanted Dean to say it, to vocalize it.
“Tonight was so fun Cas,” Dean said, laying his head back against the couch.
Cas catalogues Dean’s tenderness. “Coffee for Cas. One ice cube. Three sugars.” A rub on the shoulder. The better side of the motel bed. The better side of his anger, when he should be mad, but he isn’t. A missed call. A voicemail. “Come back from your cloud in the sky Dumbo.” What’s not said, if only because it’s shown. Things Dean takes: punches from a vamp, Cas’ sour moods, the tomatoes out of a burger. And what he doesn’t: Promises for granted. The kitten Cas finds outside the bunker that he nurses back to health. The kitten Dean is actually allergic to, the one Cas is sure Dean will send out for adoption but
“Oh yea,” Cas said, standing up a little too quickly to meet Dean. He swayed as Dean tried to steady him but Cas brushed him off. “If people ‘like me so much’ then why did I not have a date Dean? Huh? You keep saying
“Cas, stop staring” Dean would say. The softest hint of a smile? On that mouth, that mouth pressing deep into that pillow. Pressing deep against Cas’, in every day dream, hinted in every hitched breath when Dean stands a little too close, licks his own. Dean pushed Cas’ shoulder with his hand, not bothering to open his eyes.
"I like it," Sam says, before turning to wave goodbye to comatose Cas and exit through the the door.
Dean’s eyes burned from the residual desert heat. He felt dirty. He looked it too. Sand was gritting across his skin in places it had
“Yeah okay,” Cas says, pulling the keys out and handing them to Dean. Cas’ fingers slide across Dean’s for a second too long upon returning the keys and it sets a mood between them that Dean breaks with a cough and a simple thanks. They switch places in the car. Dean pulls out onto the main road and looks to Cas.
, is what he thinks. He’s imaging a date.
“Hey, I thought your New Year’s resolution was to be more compassionate,” Dean teases.
Dean orders them beers. Before Cas could sit down Dean grabs him again, directing him over to the back. He sighs. He knows where this was going.
His eyes crunch against the oncoming tears.
“Dinner’s ready,” he calls over his shoulder. “Just thought you might have wanted to know.” Dean and Cas look at each other for a split second, fear in both their eyes, before Cas just laughs and Dean feels relieved that Cas is okay with it. If Cas is okay with it, then Dean should be too.
“I think we’re ready,” Cas says. He orders a fajita plate per Dean’s suggestion and Dean orders something called "flautas," giving the waitress a shrug. She brings Dean a beer too.
“Hey there you go,” Dean says, still holding onto the car door incase Cas suddenly slams on the brake.
“My eyes are up here, Dean.” Dean rolls his eyes but Cas has walked off, slipping into the pants Dean has handed him.
“It’s fine,” Cas said. “No one was gonna ask me anyway.”
“Charlie Brown,” Cas said, head cocking.
“Cas, we can’t put it by the fire there’s no outlet.”
“It’s okay, Dean, I understand. I’m sorry I shouldn’t have done that,” Cas whispers, turning to leave the car and a very confused Dean.
Sam first unwraps a porn mag—”Naughty Nerdy Girls”—but underneath is a new pair of running shoes. “Thank you Dean, these are great,” Sam says, lacing the strings through their holes. “The shoes, not the girls,” he adds. Sure, Dean thinks, winking at Cas. Cas rolls his eyes. He returns to his gift, carefully peeling off the paper.
“This must have cost a fortune,” Dean says, closing the book to run his fingers over the cover. “Cas you shouldn’t have, I….Thank you, Cas, really, thank you.”
“Alright Cas, time to pop your Christmas cherry, then,” Dean said, rebuking a look from Sam. “We’re going to do it right this year, you’ll see,” Dean said, hand lingering down Cas’ shoulder blade to the back of his chair.
“Now, to make the car move, you take your foot off the brake and put it on the gas, just like this. See?” Dean says, making the impala crawl forward extremely slowly. Cas nods again and Dean gets out of the car, pops open the hood, and places the stick in place to keep it up. Cas follows suit and meets Dean at the front. Dean gives him a brief lesson of all the parts and how they work and what to do if your car over heats and whatnot.
Dean understood that Cas had had enough and simply nestled himself between Cas’ arms, letting the vodka pull him into sleep. Cas wrapped his arms around Dean and leaned back, resting his head against the couch. Soon enough he was drifting, the sound of Dean snoring lulling him into dreams of prom dates with green eyes and more freckles than he could count.
“What are you-Oh yeah, that belt sticks sometimes,” Dean says, reaching over to help.
Cas’ eyes fluttered open, itchy and dry from the motel air conditioner. The sun was only barely breaking the horizon. It was early still. He turned over, careful not to wake Dean sleeping beside him. The motel had two rooms but only one queen bed in each. Sam had taken one room, Dean suggested Cas and him grab the other. One one hand, Cas hated being human. He hated being hungry, hated feeling his legs ache, hated when the sweater scratched his neck and the coffee burned his tongue. Hated having to drive everywhere. Hated feeling so powerless.
shirt—inches up his back to flash a strip of skin. Dean swallows hard. He tries not to look down, tries to focus on Cas’ shot. The angle’s all wrong though; Cas will hit the eight instead. It happens subconsciously: Dean leaning over him, sliding his hand down Cas’ arm to rest lightly on his hand. He doesn't even realize he’s doing it until he’s there, until Cas is warm under his chest, until Dean can smell patchouli and pine, until Cas’ hair is tickling his cheek. He tries not to think about it, tries to keep enough distance between them so that Cas can’t feel his heart hitched beat echoing in his ribcage.
“Dean, I’m so confused, is it a printer?” Cas says, truly puzzled. “And I don’t understand why someone would want such a small piece of paper-“
Dean is stirred by the sound of jiggling keys, then he wrangles himself through the door into the room. He drops the bags and sloughs onto the bed, kicking his shoes off before rolling over onto his back. Cas is busy fiddling with the heater, trying to get it to turn on. It whirs up and he steps back, Dean’s arms reaching out to pull him back by his waist.
“Umm, about two weeks.” Dean hesitates, stupidly embarrassed.
“Okay.” Cas replies, beginning to think and ponder certain dates and whether they were better than others or whether he should just pick any random date on a calendar and call it a day.
Cas speaks between panting breaths, “I, I thought you regretted it, uhh, you didn’t speak to me, uhh, for three days” and Dean’s heart collapses in on itself. He pulls back, gazing deep into Cas’ eyes.
Now that Cas was human (for now, Dean told himself. He was working on it.) Dean finally had an excuse to go all out. On one hand he felt childish at the idea of decorating the bunker in kitschy Christmas bows and ribbons, stringing up lights, posting a tree up in the corner. On the other hand, seeing Cas among the Christmas trees, fingers stretching out to graze their pines, stopping to smell each one, made a warmth was spread through his chest. They’d been through so much this year; together and separately. Dean had to make it up to Cas. He had to give him a proper holiday.
“Here just wiggle it like this,” Dean says, shaking the thing. He gets it undone and pushes it back across Cas chest to the side of the car. He looks up as he’s done and meets Cas’ blue-enough-to-paint-an-entire-sky eyes, whose pupils are full on dilated and Dean thinks ‘fuck it’. He’s done being a coward about his feelings for Cas and being unable to act on them and having this prolonged agony through fleeting touches, like today’s keys mishap. Dean thinks those are the only things he can smile about; times when Cas hugs just a little longer or when their fingers brush, and Dean knows Cas thinks nothing of it but to him they’re everything and-
“Well I’m not joking.” Cas says, dropping the Polaroid from his face, staring Dean in the eyes, pleading in his heart for Dean to say he feels the same way.
anybody’ but you don’t mean it! You don’t get it Dean, there’s isn’t an anybody” Cas spat, sort of regretting the harshness, but in reality it was the truth. If Dean didn’t like it then Fuck him.
“I’m fine, Cas. Let’s just go,” Dean says, shaking him off, opening the car door. He stops first, dabbing his bleeding nose with his shirt. He ducks in, sits shotgun. Slams the door.
“Someone’s bossy tonight. It’s New Year’s Eve! Relax, dude!” Dean says.
Dean can’t even remember the last time they had a tree. They never really had them as kids—Christmas was not exactly a Winchester affair. Dad was gone most of them anyways. Dean had always tried to do something for Sam but with no money and being a kid, it was mostly just watching motel TV and seeing snow, if they were lucky. It’s why Sam’s never big on Christmas every year; always brings back shadows of sorry memories. Dean always went with the flow, didn’t want to push Sam, but he always secretly wished Sam would budge and maybe one year they’d get a tree. Do more than just get wasted on eggnog, eat take-out, exchange gifs wrapped in newspaper, and pass out early. Gifts from Sam were always small and practical; Dean’s were wildly immature.
“Oh?” Cas said, turning fully towards Dean. “What’s that?” His eyes flickered to Dean’s lips.
Dean’s head snaps over. His jaw is hanging. “What?”
“Okay, well, come get me when you’re ready,” Cas said, drifting out of the room. “I’ll be in the greenhouse.”
“Oh, you guys just took longer than unusual,” Cas said over a bite. Sam just laughed. Dean became suddenly very interested in the milk carton’s ingredients. Ingredients: Milk.
“Just shut up and come here” Cas says, pulling Dean in for another kiss.
"If something’s bothering you then we can-"
“Cas…” Dean says, trying to stop Cas’ mouth, which is running a hundred miles a minute. “Cas, it’s okay!” Dean says, grabbing his arm. Dean’s touch anchors Cas and he calms a bit.
Last Christmas was drifting in from afar in the winter wind. “See one you like?” Dean said, coming up behind Cas. He’d bought them ridiculously priced hot chocolate from the stand at the front of the lot. He bought a pack of ornaments too, some garland, even lights. Cas' face lit up in surprise as he accepted the styrofoam cup, balancing a mound of whipped cream. The surprise melted into a smile as Cas pulled it up to his lips. God, those lips. Those chapped lips, ruddy in the cold, lips Cas licked right before taking a sip. Dean felt a little self-conscious standing there, staring in anticipation.
“Uhhh….” Sam said, standing there. “How was….uhh….did you,” he sputtered. He just stood there.
Cas, something he only ever dreamed about a million times, but this time it was real. And Cas’ was serious, and Dean was serious, and fuck Cas’ look of
“The lady at the local bookstore helped me find it.” Cas says, trying to deflect.
“Come one get in,” Dean replies after he notices Cas hesitancy to follow.
“We should probably get out before Sam comes to investigate the noise,” Cas says, sitting himself up and sliding towards the passenger door.
“I’m sorry, I was just drunk and I, I, I crossed a line. I won’t do it again,” Cas reached out to touch Dean’s hand but Dean was already standing, already backing out. He’d said about all he could. Every word was like a fresh brand into his side. He was trying, he was, but there was only so much a guy could take.
“Fine, what are yours then?” Cas asks. He smirks when Dean is silent, when he blanks. Of course, Dean didn’t have any resolutions himself. He’d been busy! He hadn’t time to think. They’d been on a hunt, give a guy a break for once.
“Then don’t speak.” Cas is kissing him now, softly, but Dean pulls back. His eyes widen because fuck, Cas just kissed him. While sober. In the daylight. In the greenhouse. Cas kissed him.
What began as a shock, however, starts to ebb to warmth, spreads through his chest, and starts to climb up his neck. It’s definitely some stupid, warm fuzzy feeling when he notices Cas frowning upwards at the restaurant’s sign. Dean follows his gaze and about doubles over when he sees the sign.
That night they kiss and talk for hours, Cas taking multiple photos of Dean. All of which Dean is happy to smile for because for once in a long time he is finally happy and he’s glad Cas can say the same. They sleep in the same bed that night, Dean falling asleep on Cas chest, finding comfort in Cas’ even breaths. He falls asleep planning on Cas’ gift for his next birthday, because he was to be damned if it isn’t as good as this years.
“Don’t ever think for one second I don’t,” Dean says, closing his eyes and leaning his head back against the window.
Dean doesn’t know how to respond, his tongue is tripping over itself, trying to figure out how to speak again, but a smile is forming on his lips. Cas doesn’t
“It’s Christmas time so wake up,” Dean says, throwing the covers off Cas. Cas is only in boxers and Dean freezes, then blushes, then averts his eyes. Cas stands now, stepping up to Dean.
“I don’t know how.” he finally admits, quietly, almost to himself. Cas’ tears have run dry but he’s silent, gone still now in Dean’s arm. “I love you, Cas. Of course, of course I love you. I love you. I need you. I need you every day. I need you so much it terrifies me. It terrifies me.”
Except when Cas is interrogating this suspect in Dean’s suit, the pants just a little tight on Cas’ ass, its rubbing Dean all the wrong (or right) ways but- shit, Dean has to be professional. People’s lives are at stake.
Dean freezes. Cas comes to stand up behind him and Dean can feel his breath on his neck. Cas raises his hand to Dean’s elbow, his hand just lingering, barely there. Dean turns to Cas and his eyes meet his, ice blue and lined with hurt. Dean swallows.
“God those were supposed to be for Sam. I panicked, okay?” Dean says, shielding himself from Cas’ little punt to his shoulder.
So Cas doesn’t say anything, he just joins Dean at the counter, pours himself a coffee. He turns and leans back against the counter and thinks of something else to say, something that he hasn’t already said a hundred times. He stares at his reflection in the coffee's surface, watch it dance in distortion. He doesn't recognize himself in the rippling surface. Or even the mirror, he thinks.
“I thought this one would work?” Cas said, standing in close to Dean. Dean nodded, walking around the tree in fake inspection.
“Ah, that’s a shame, see I
“It’s okay, I’m sure it understands,” Cas says with a slight grin. Dean chuckles. In the silence, he pulls his hand out from behind his back. It’s a gift wrapped box—it even has a bow—and he hands it to Cas. He scratches his arm.
“No, not at all,” Dean said. Ouch. That didn’t come out that crisp. Cas pulled up to Dean, standing almost flesh with his body. Dean could feel the heat radiating off of him. He leaned back but Cas’ lips we’re right there, still so chapped, still ruddy as he licked them, again.
“I don’t know, just with the long hair and everything and the—” he gestured at Sam’s outfit.
“Alright serve yourself,” Dean says, handing out plates. They all dig in, plating way too much food each but somehow managing it all. When the food is gone and they’re stuffed they migrate to the living room, Cas and Dean falling onto the couch as Sam sits in a recliner. The fire crackles and pops.
playing with—” he ducks the swing he anticipated from the shorter one. Dean’s fist is already driving up and through before he’s stood back up. It connects with the guy’s jaw with an audible crack and the guy staggers back. His weight carries him back as tumbles over his stool. The taller one lunges but Dean sidesteps under and around him, hooking his foot under the guy’s boot and shoving him forward. He trips and goes down hard and fast, head slamming on a table’s rim. He’s knocked out before he hits the ground. The third guy freezes. Don’t be stupid, now, Dean thinks. He backs off, hands up, knocking into the table behind him. Dean stands for a moment, breathing. The bar’s gone dead quiet. He can feel 30 stares on him but he doesn’t care, just turns and walks off. He tips over someone’s old beer, letting it slowly pour off the table’s edge and onto the taller one’s face as he slowly comes to.
Dean can’t read Cas’ face because he’s looking down into the box. He keeps looking down, slowing reaching in to pull out the 5 inch knife. The knife is a typical hunter’s knife but the blade is sturdy, a beautiful walnut shade. It is not the color that stops Cas but the intricate carving, the swirling celtic knots that run down the handle’s spine. They’re delicately intertwined but meticulously carved, stained a little darker for contrast. On each side are anti-demon and anti-monster sigils respectively. but Carved at the bottom of the handle are Cas’ initials in Enochian.
Cas closed his eyes when Dean stirred in waking, pretended he was asleep even though Dean caught him. He caught him every time.
“Dean, I don’t want to play, please,” Cas says, a huff of annoyance. Dean swipes his hand at the air, rejecting Cas’ rejection. Dean wasn’t aversed to forcing Cas to play pool with him, much to Cas’ complaints. Sometimes as bait when hustling, to lure in some sucker from the bar to bet against Dean. But other times, Dean just wanted to play. Like tonight.
“So, what’s engong?” Cas asked, washing off his plate.
“Does he own the lot?” Cas asked, finally giving in to Dean’s pulling hands.
“Thank you Sam. It’s awesome.” Cas says, putting it down on the floor in front of him.
—but Cas was right. Cas did know him. He could recognize what Dean said when he couldn’t speak. He knew his every tell—for better or worse. When he was lying. When he was asking for something but too scared to vocalize it. When he was telling the truth but pretending to be lying, to save face. From what, Cas couldn’t always understand. But right now, he understood that Dean would say something, joke about the moment, deflect when he was ready. And Cas would laugh, because the joke would probably be funny anyways. Cas knew when to push and when to wait, when to let Dean navigate to him, to reach out to him, to trust Dean to trust himself to do it. When they were together, there were many things unsaid, of course, but nothing gone unnoticed. Each lingering touch, each just-because coffee, each here, I’ll drive, you sleep—each one emboldening the next, cementing the last in a language they shared but did not speak aloud.
“Come here,” Dean says, pulling Cas down onto the bed. He wraps his arms around him, pulling him flush against his chest. He nuzzles the crown of Cas’ head. Motel heater be damned, Cas thinks. Dean is warm enough. “Thank you for driving,” he says, yawning.
So that’s how it was settled. Cas would be going to prom.  He hated even the idea of it, but Dean had seem so hellbent on it that maybe he’d go for an hour or so then leave. Dean would understand.
“Anyways clear your schedule for tonight, we’re making eggnog and cookies.”
“Shut up Sammy,” Dean said, hands gripping the edge of the washing machine.
“No it’s fine Dean,” Cas asked, trying to stop Dean from getting to heated. Dean was standing up again.
“Yea well, that too,” Dean says, stammering. “Shut up,” he adds, just for good measure, but it’s an empty jibe. Cas just shakes his head.
“I thought you were going to say New Year’s Eve,” Cas asks. His grin peeks out from over the menu. Dean can feel the tips of his ears heat, strike like lit matches.
“Yea, it was” Cas said, smiling to himself. He didn’t lie this time. Being along with Dean actually made Cas estatic. Being with Dean always did.
“Alright Dean,” Cas said, hoping to just move on from the subject.
“Let it go, Cas” Dean says, spitting out another mouthful of blood. He’s flexing his hands against his sides and breathing heavy, puffs of breath dissipating into the night. He stands facing the street, squinting into the headlights, not moving, just breathing. Cas can’t even get a word in before he’s halfway across yellow lines, flipping off a honking driver.
“Any one I want?” Cas aks, skeptical of the legitimacy of Dean’s question.
“Fine. Well, Merry Christmas, Cas.”
“Was the store crowded?” Cas asked over his lunch.
“That looks kinda fucked,” Sam said, passing by.
Cas follows through and sinks the seven, sending the cue to tap lightly on the eighth. Dean lets out the breath he didn’t realize he was pulling and pulls himself off Cas. Cas is smiling, clearly happy with himself, maybe a little embarrassed to be proud.
“Okay, you ready?” Dean says, closing the head.
“Hey, let’s get you cleaned up,” he said. Cas nodded. The stillness of the air gave way to movement, the heat returning to the room, and the moment had passed—whatever it was. Dean’s hand still rested on Cas’ shoulder as he guided him out.
“Nope,” Dean said, shaking his head, lips pulled into a taut line.
“Dean, it’s okay.” Cas said, placing a hand on Dean’s knee. “You don’t have to be sorry. Besides, Christmas on Earth is...good. It’s great actually. I like it. Thank you for introducing me,” Cas said, wrapping the blanket closer around him. Warmth spread through Dean. The fireplace and the bourbon were no match to the sheer heat radiating of Cas’ body. Here on the couch, orange flickers of soft light caressed Cas’ face, illuminating his eyes as they held Dean’s gaze. God, in the light Cas was so beautiful. He always stunned Dean. No matter what time of day. Even in the mornings, with his bed head and baggy pajama bottoms. It wasn’t even the skin peeking under his sleeping shirt that always stirred Dean. Just the sight of Cas comfortable, sleepy, home, threw Dean everytime. Of course Cas was beautiful during the day, working in the greenhouse, reading his books, his hands attentive to book and flower with the same gentle caress. Right now, with the sparks of a fire dancing in his eyes— those eyes that were holding Dean’s, holding true, not breaking— Dean’s breath was catching in his throat.
Cas looked wiped too, slumping against the doorway as Dean slid in the key. They fall inside and into the A/C, Dean moaning as he collapses on the bed. Cas sits down in the chair, leaning back, pinching the bridge of his nose.
“Why?
“Good,” Dean says. He bends his arms to rest between them on the top of the seat. His elbow brushes Cas’ shoulder, just barely.
They were both panting. Dean couldn’t see himself but he could see Cas, whose ruffled hair was absolutely not helping the deep flush blooming across his cheeks. Dean could only imagine what he looked like. He looked down at the pillow he held clutched in front of his crotch.
“God Dean what the hell is wrong with you” Cas asked, plugging his nose before gulping his down. He immediately felt the burn and grimaced, to which Dean bellowed at, only handing Cas another shot.
“Come on Cas hurry up I’m getting impatient” Dean said, shaking Cas back and forth on the bed.
“Yea, I’m good,” Dean says, the tension falling out of his shoulders. Cas smiles himself now. Leans back a little. It’s dark but Cas can see a soft smile flash quick across Dean’s face.
Cas kisses him again, slow and thoughtful. Dean cups his face and wraps his arm around Cas’ waist, pulling him in tighter. They kiss for a moment longer and Cas pulls back, leaning his forehead against Dean’s. Dean reaches up and kisses it and Cas sinks back down on Dean’s chest.
“You’re an idiot,” he mumbles, trailing kisses down Dean’s neck. Dean roots his hands through Cas’ hair.
Cas couldn’t dance. In fact, he was horrible at anything involving coordination. But Dean didn’t care, he just tried to make Cas enjoy himself.
“Good,” Cas says, still staring. Dean looks over and smiles fully now, the hint of a blush splattering across his cheeks.
“Tomorrow morning.”
“So this, this, this isn’t yours?” Cas asked, eyebrows raised. He swirled the glass slowly.
“Sorry babe,” Dean said, laughing. He handed Cas another shot and took two himself.
“They had it coming,” Cas says again, nonchalantly.
sticks all by ourselves.” One of them glances at the other. The shortest turns red, crossing his arms. Dean just goes on. “No one to sink any balls with, fill all those holes” he says, dragging it out, laying it on thick.
“It’s eggnog, Cas, and it’s delicious,” Dean said, biting into a banana. “You’ll like it.”
“Well I don’t have another car,” Cas says, lowering his head and feeling embarrassed.
“Of course you did. I already knew, of course. When I was an angel, I could smell it on you. I didn’t think they were about me, though.” Cas’ eyes flutter back up to meet Dean’s. “I hoped they were about me.”
“What do you mean?”
he’s ever felt. He wonders how it could get any better than this.
“C’mon,” Dean breaks the silence, reaching his hand up to Cas’ cheek. “Let’s go to sleep.”
“I’ve never let myself even think about it…” Dean trails off, but it’s clear that he has. He’s thought about it too much. He’s spent so many nights dreaming about what being with Cas would be like - just truly
. He’s had sex dreams too, sure, but he wants Cas in another way, mostly. In a
Cas chokes on his breath as he hears his own name. Dean is thinking about him while he touches himself. Dean is thinking about Cas while he touches himself.
Dean felt an uncomfortable feeling of shame settle in his stomach. This is the first time in his life that he has ever,
“We’re here,” Dean grumbles, stepping out of Baby and squinting at the setting sun shining on their home for the next few nights. A small sign hangs next to the front door of a brick office, it’s blinds drawn tightly closed. Extended sideways from the office is a bunch of rooms. Around 20 maybe, Dean thinks. Surely a motel in a town as small as this wouldn’t need 20 rooms, but Cas informs him it’s actually booked out. Huh. Cas has the keys to their room, number 16, and Dean taps his feet against the dirt as he waits for Cas to get his bag out of the Impala. Dean has his slung across his shoulder already, feeling the handle of one of his daggers burying itself into this rib cage.
Cas, slipping his hand into his boxers, touching himself just out of Dean’s gaze. Cas takes Dean’s cock in his other hand as he strokes them together, fast. Dean’s hips buck forwards, and in under a second of Dean thinking about Cas holding his cock, Dean comes.
“Listen, Cas, I-“
“You’re tired, Dean. I don’t mind doing your share of reading, too. Go sit down and rest your eyes.”
It’s about 4am when Dean stirs awake to the sound of plastic dropping against the floor in the kitchen. “Ughhh, Cas?”
This kiss is so differently from the first one that Cas gasps a little. Soft lips, nibbles, laughing into each other’s mouths. Dean is definitely leading the kiss, his lips moving hastily against Cas’. He lets his tongue wander over Cas’ lips, then his teeth, and then his tongue. It’s a soft and playful kiss when it begins, but it soon turns into something intoxicating.
Dean huffs and does as he’s told, moving to sit in a comfortable, old recliner chair. The leather is a worn brown, ripping and bits flaking off at the edges, but Dean lets his head rest backwards and his eyes drift shut. Cas smiles to himself and puts Dean’s stack of books next to his own.
It’s a cheap hotel room, with bleak white walls, a queen bed with a red cover, a tv, and not much more. There’s a doorway leading to a tiny bathroom, illuminated bleakly under the sunset. Dean immediately dumps his bag on the bed and heads to the kitchen, looking in the fridge for a beer. If he’s going to be sharing a bed with Cas for 4 days, he’s gonna need an ample stash of alcohol. The fridge is empty. What else did he expect from this shithole?
Dean pulls away from Cas slowly, his arms still around him, their noses almost touching. He’s going a bit cross-eyed trying to look Cas in the eye. His cheeks are wet and his eyes are red and he’s sure he probably has snot everywhere, but he doesn’t care. If he doesn’t say it now he might not get another chance. He doesn’t want to risk feeling the guilt-ridden pain ever again.
Dean smiles at the fact that Cas knows he has to have his morning coffee first thing after waking up. He smiles wider at the thought that Cas might’ve been making him a hangover cure, sans the pills, because he would just heal him. God, Dean loves it when Cas heals him. He can feel Cas’ grace filter through his entire body, molecule by molecule and cell by cell. It really
“So? Ive shared a bed with a few of my mates, you just stay on your side and it should be fine. Unless he sleeps naked, because you don’t want to deal with the whole morning wood scenario.” The bartender chuckles to himself, like sharing a bed with your friend is the most normal thing in the world, like talking about morning wood with a stranger is the most normal thing in the world.
Several minutes follow of Cas listening to Dean’s breath and his heartbeat, waiting to hear him succumb to sleep. Instead, he feels Dean’s hand grab at his own, intertwining their fingers on the mattress between them. Cas is a bit taken aback because Dean is normally so opposed to physical touch, but he soon finds himself rubbing his thumb gently on the back of Dean’s hand. Dean falls asleep feeling the most happy, content, and
He’s half hard now, and he feels guilty for listening in on Dean’s private time. That is up until he hears Dean’s moan echo through the shower and into the cramped motel room.
Dean chuckles as he walks to the front door with Baby’s keys in hand. “Alright, buddy. I’ll bring you a coffee back. You better be out of bed by the time I’m back!”
“I don’t think you do, Cas.”
He can’t believe he’s out to Cas now. And Cas couldn’t care less. Dean might cry just thinking about it. He doesn’t, instead slowly removing himself from the bed and strutting to the bathroom. He pushes the door closed gently, but doesn’t shut it as he knows it would creak loudly and probably wake Cas up, and God knows the angel needs his beauty sleep. He turns the shower on, letting the steam fog up the mirror and mix with the early morning light to create a calming ambience.
That was definitely not silent, Dean thinks, as he glances towards the door. It’s still mostly shut, and the bed on the other side of it looks the same as when he left if, so Dean shrugs it off and focuses on cleaning himself up.
When Dean sees Cas in heaven, he can’t move. It’s a bright white all around, but when he locks eyes with Cas they’re back in the bunker. He doesn’t breathe, he doesn’t walk towards him, run faster than he thought he ever could, reuniting likes he’s dreamt every night since the goodbye. Cas is smiling, like he always was. Dean is crying already, an ugly cry that causes sobs to wrack his body, like a stutter that never ceases.
A little weight lifts off his shoulders because deep down, even if he confessed and Cas didn’t accept who he was or didn’t reciprocate the feelings, Cas wasn’t the type of person to just leave Dean like that. They’d still remain hunting partners, at least. Dean’s chest stung a little at the thought of losing what he had with Cas, after everything they’ve been through together, losing eachother time and time again. It only makes him more certain that this moment of courage is the right thing to do.
way. His head falls into his hands and he exhales in shame. “How can I even be in the same room as him when I’m… like this? I can’t even look him in the eyes!”
But with Cas, Dean wanted nothing more than to curl into his side and breathe him in deeply, to treasure him. To truly appreciate him in a way that he knows Cas deserves, but that Dean has been to closeted and too scared to do.
Cas wonders why Dean is acting so strangely today. Sure, Dean is often grumpy and snappy, but Cas can sense there’s something different about it today. He barely spoke on the drive here, not even anything about how nice Baby drives, which is extremely odd. Cas hopes Dean can get over whatever it is while he’s out - no doubt at the local pub - before he returns. Although Cas doesn’t need to sleep, he would like to lay down for a short period of time without Dean’s angst stinking up the bed.
Humans are so strange with their distinction between platonic, romantic or sexual feelings, Cas thinks. He’s never been in a situation like this before: in Heaven, sex just doesn’t happen. There’s not arousal, no pining, no morning wood. But on Earth - God. Cas is a little ashamed at how often he, you know, releases.
“Don’t worry about it, Dean. You were clearly tired, and as I said, I don’t mind doing your share if it means you take some time off to rest.”
While Dean is out, Cas tries to settle into the motel a little. Even as an Angel he feels uncomfortable in stagnant, liminal  places such as this. He opens the blinds, turns all the lights on, sets the t.v. to a channel playing animal planet, and lays on the bed. Dean’s bag is next to him, heavy on the linen sheets. He thinks about unzipping it, touching his soft clothes, even pressing it gently against his nose and inhaling the scent. Dean’s scent.
Cas staring into Dean’s eyes, almost staring through him. Like he was searching for that feeling of happiness inside of Dean.
Dean is whistling when he comes out of the shower, towel around his waist, his hair dripping water down his bare chest and back. Cas is awake, sprawled across the bed, and his head pops up when he hears Dean talk. “Morning, Cas!”
He tries to ignore the rush of blood heading towards a certain area between his legs. It’s like his body knows that morning showers are usually time for, you know, a certain release. Dean knows he’s kept the door open a little and any small noise would make it’s way to Cas’ ears, but he had faith in his ability to cum silently. After spending your life on the road with your brother, you get pretty good at silent orgasms in random bathrooms, hotels, or in Baby late at night.
To be fair, Cas had never really been interested in sex or anything to do with arousal since residing on Earth. That has changed, he discovered, since he met Dean. Dean was his sexual awakening, if you will.
This is enough for Dean to feel the blood rush to his crotch. Dean is turned on, he’s not going to lie, and he thinks Cas is too. His cheeks are dry and he’s absolutely beaming with happiness, and he can’t help but lean in and press his lips to Cas’ again.
“I never found an answer, because the one thing I want - ” Dean wants to reach for Cas, to hold him, to touch him in these last moments he might ever have with him. But he just blinks, a ravenous empty feeling taking shelter in his stomach.
. More profound, as he himself once said. He loves Dean, and he has for a long time. Cas knows angels weren’t supposed to develop any feelings at all, most importantly not
Cas hurries over to the bed, but walks up to Dean’s nightstand and places a cup of water there for the morning. “I thought you’d be a bit thirsty in the morning, so I was getting you water before you had your coffee.”
Dean is groggy and already has a bit of a headache from the drinks, but he laughs quietly. “Don’t be silly, Cas. Get your fucking cup and come to bed.”
“Because it is.”
He feels Dean’s entire body pressing against him: they’re chest to chest, arms scrambling, thigh to thigh, and, most importantly and certainly most excitingly, crotch to crotch. Cas can feel Dean’s cock, already half-hard, pressing against his own, and he moans loudly into the kiss.
“Man, why’d you let me fall asleep? I feel like an ass for sleeping on the job.”
Cas’ dick is rock hard and springs up when released from his underwear. He has precome nestled at his slit, dripping slowly down his shaft. Dean almost drools at the slight, thinking about how he made Cas like this. The air feels hot around him, and he wonders if the bunker’s walls are responsible or if it’s Cas’ undoubtedly aroused body in front of him.
Dean laughs a little, a fire in his eyes. “I’m fucking pumped to do that everyday for the rest of time.”
Cas, unzipping his pants and sliding them down, all while staring longingly into Dean’s eyes. In this fantasy, Dean is naked from the waist down, his cock hard and swollen laying against his the skin on his tummy. Cas doesn’t stray from Dean’s eyes. Dean doesn’t dare to touch himself: he’s locked and loaded and if he moves he might lose it.
“Fuck, Cas.”
Cas lifts his head and meets Dean’s eyes for the first time that morning, his tone completely serious as he replies. “I am not wearing panties, Dean. And even if I was, it makes no sense that they would be twisted. If they’re twisted, you wouldn’t be able to put them on.”
Dean and Cas fumble through morning wood, falling asleep at work, and feeling vulnerable around one another.
Dean looks up at the bartender. He’s handsome in a dark, mysterious and broody way, but he has a kind close-lipped smile on face. He’s dressed in black jeans and a grey t-shirt, which Dean is assuming is the uniform for this bar. A kitchen towel drapes over his muscular shoulder.
“Nothings up, why don’t you head out and get a coffee while I get ready?”
Dean knocks on the motel door timidly before twisting the handle and stepping in. The lights are all on, thankfully, as the sun is long gone. Cas is laying on the bed and the t.v. has some weird show about rhinoceroses playing. Cas sits up quickly as Dean steps in the door.
“I love you.” Cas hopes Dean understands that it means
Cas pulls back to smile at Dean, and in seconds Dean has leant forward and caught Cas’ lip between his teeth. Cas opens his mouth in surprise, and Dean kisses him slowly and deeply, letting his hand move from Cas’ waist over his hips and to his ass, where it grabs gently.
They’re panting together now. Dean takes off his shirt and orders Cas to do the same. “Off!”
“Dean? Deeeaannn? I’m so sorry to disturb you, but it’s best we return to the motel for the night. The library is closing.”
Dean hasn’t seen Cas since the confession; since the Empty took such a big part of his life away in just a few seconds. When Cas said the three little words, Dean’s heart started beating faster. His friendship with Cas was different than his friendship with everyone else, but he could never put a finger on it until that moment.
They lay there, laughing at nothing in particular anymore. Dean bumps his shoulder into Cas, and when Cas doesn’t move away, he keeps it there. Cas sits up on his elbow again, and Dean follows.
For Cas, this was Dean’s language. The words he couldn’t say aloud. The words he couldn’t utter, couldn’t will himself to say. But he did say them. He said them every day. He said them over and over, with his hands, with his actions, with his movements. He was saying them again, right now, as he pulled into the motel. As he tapped Cas’ on the shoulder, led him inside, and filled a glass of water for him.
He steps forward, swallowing Cas in his arms, pulling him tight. “Hey, hey, Cas, come on Cas,” but Cas was pushing his arms into Dean, fighting against him. Dean only held on stronger and now Cas was punching his chest in little fists, tears pulsing down his cheek. He eventually caved, folding into Dean, full sobs raking up and down his spine. They slide to the floor, Dean cradling Cas now, tears welling up in his own eyes.
"How much time you think we got," Cas asks, grabbing Dean’s tie and sitting up and over to straddle him.
“Dean. Stop. Just...look, Dean, just go talk to him. I know you don’t want to but for once in your life, do not run away from this. Do not run away from him.”
“Shit!” Dean yelped, both him and Cas startled by the horn going off so abruptly.
“I know,” Dean said. “I….I will.”
“Oh, we’re baking?” Cas said.
. Suddenly, just being here with Cas, who’s wearing one of Dean’s shirts because his own was torn by the cabra, feels like a dagger piercing through his sternum.
“What?” Cas said, not even having heard him.
“Why do you do it?"
“Okay now slowly ease onto the gas,” Dean says, pulling Cas out of his stupor.
They drive in silence. Cas' hands wring the steering wheel, Dean resists the urge to soothe them, to stop their incessant writhing, to get Cas to just leave it. Cas speaks, but he stares straight ahead.
Cas had packed his bags quickly at first, but slowed at the end, dreading stepping out of the bunker and into the cold. When he stepped out in the main room, Dean wasn’t there. He made his way up the stairs, with every step carving a new chunk out of a dwindling hope of “Wait! Don’t go”. It doesn't come.
Cas spots him outside the bar across the street. He’s too far away to get there in time. They’re going to get a few punches in, maybe a few kicks depending on how many Dean’s had. It’s dark and Cas can hardly see; dim shadows dance on walls. Dean’s face flashes in the light of a headlights as a fist connects with his jaw. Blood glitters in the air. Cas is trying to cross the road but the cars are flying by, freezing air licking across his skin. In between passing cars Dean is rolling on the ground, still shouting some taunt, still edging them on. There’s a kick in the ribs Cas can feel from across the street. He bolts through a break in the cars, doesn’t even hear the honks. He’s between them now—Dean and the three bikers he’s managed to piss off—and grabs him by the armpits, practically dragging him off while Dean continues to scream. Dean is fucking drunk, his words slurred in a mix of alcohol and the crimson blood pooling in his mouth. He spits it to the ground and shoves Castiel off, turning to walk off towards the car.
“That’s generally how sneaking around works Ca—”
“I— You’re being dumb.”
Dean looks to Cas, whose almost fallen asleep on his bed. His suit is disheveled, the top button undone and the collar-Shit. Fuck. Oh god, fuck.
Dean pressed his lips onto Cas’. They were rugged, just as Dean had imagined, but soft, slow, even sweet. Then Dean caught up with his drunk body in real time, realizing that fuck, these were Cas’ lips. But Cas’ arm only slowly wrapped around Dean’s neck, pulling him in further. Dean’s breath hitched in his throat as they deepened their kiss, hitching again when Cas rubbed a thumb down Dean’s jaw. Dean realized his hands were still planted by his side and when he wrapped them around Cas and Cas moaned so slightly into Dean’s mouth, Dean thought he’d nearly crush him pulling him closer. Cas crawled forward into Dean’s lap, straddling him now as he leaned Dean back into lying down. Dean bit a little on Cas’ bottom lip and Cas pushed down into him, running a hand down his chest. Dean pulled off to mouth kisses down Cas’ neck, starting at his ear and working down to the hollow of this throat.
“I hate the desert,” Cas says, his voice gravelled and dry. Dean looks over, sees the sunburn beginning to settle across Cas’ cheekbones. He just hmm’s, too tired to speak. Cas eventually rises for the shower. Dean drifts off.
If Castiel was totally honest the only reason he chose November 23rd was because he loved fall and it reminded him of staying inside the Bunker like last fall in which Dean, Sam, and him had hot chocolate, courtesy of Dean, and for the first time in a long time, Cas had felt happy. Dean had had a little too much to drink before the hot chocolate, and his lingering touches on Cas that night had made Cas’ skin ignite and crackle like the fire in front of him. The fire had been nothing compared to Dean’s warmth though, as he fell asleep on Cas shortly after Sam bid them a good night and left for bed. Dean had conked out and rested his head on Cas’ shoulder. Cas only took the empty mug out of Dean’s hands and laid it on the floor. He set his mug beside it, and closed his eyes (he said he’d just shut them for a minute), before he ended falling entirely asleep by accident. In the middle of the night he woke up alone, Dean gone, but a blanket had been laid on top of him. He felt contradicted at the hollowness he felt inside upon waking up alone, after expecting Dean to be there on some fleeting chance of fate, and the happiness he felt in the fact Dean had cared for him with a blanket.
“Sleep tight, girl scout!.” Dean called out, sinking back into this seat. He drummed his fingers on the table—much to Cas’ annoyance—but stopped, checking his watch. “Alright, we’ve got to go now before they close.”
“Hey, I’m back!” Sam called from the top of the stairwell. FUCK. Limbs slammed into limbs as they scrambled apart, Dean’s hand knocking Cas’ across the back of the head. They just made it to opposite ends of the couch as Sam turned the corner, signed book in hand.
“Wait Cas...have you had a Christmas before?” Dean asked, leaning forward over the table. Their shoulders brushed as Dean propped his arm up to rest his head on his fist.
“Be my guest,” Dean said, throwing up his hands.
“That’s bullshit Cas,” Dean said, crossing his arms.
“There’s one more thing, but I was saving it for later,” Dean said. His words rang out before he thought them, the booze speaking for him. Dean, slow down.
“Wait-what the fuckno thatss so stupid Cas don’t t-think your not awesome because you did-dnt get invited to prom,” Dean said, taking off his shoes. “You’re like the coolest person I know.”
, never comes. The adrenaline that had coursed through Dean all night, that caused his skin to sizzle under Cas’ touch, to hum, had receded. It left him exhausted in its wake, the heat of the day sinking deep into his bones. But so did Cas’ warmth, radiating into his chest as Cas’ breath slowed, eyes closing.
“This is the wheel, the gas, brake, and gear” Dean says while pointing out all the corresponding parts. Cas just nods in agreement and tries to absorb everything Dean says.
“Dean,” Cas says, looking up from the fully developed Polaroid, “it’s absolutely perfect.” Cas says, taking the Polaroid in his hands and trying to figure out how he can take a picture himself.
Cas slowly tilted the glass back, letting the bourbon flow down his throat as he swallowed the drink whole. A little caught on the corner of his lip. He wiped it with the back of his arm, reaching forward again to set down the glass on the table. Dean’s eyes were open as wide as his mouth, which he quickly tried to close. Everything was happening too quickly and yet he swore time froze as Cas’ head tipped back, his neck arching, his adam’s apple bobbing up and down.
“Dean, don’t—” but Dean is gone, having walked off in their direction. Cas could only watch now. He knew better than to chase after him, to try and stop him. He stays out of the fray, setting the pool stick down.
“You said you were cold last week in town, I thought it would help,” Cas says and Sam smiles. “Thank you! It’s a great color, Cas, I love it,” and Sam throws it on for good measure.
“Oh c’mon Cas if you’re going to learn to drive properly, you’re going to learn in a real car, not this thing,” Dean says, taking a look at the rugged interior.
“Dean slow down” Cas said, putting his hand over the shot Dean was about to down. Dean simply smiled and took it regardless.
gratitude on his birthday, because this is the happiest moment of Dean’s life. They make out hot and heavy, Dean’s mouth slowly opening up to Cas. Their tongues meet and clash, exploring more of each other with every second.  Dean smiles into the kiss, because it’s the greatest thing to him, and-*click* .
“Cas, it’s Prom!” Dean countered, “You have to go.”
The drive into town is only 15 minutes long but the minutes are crawling on. Cas isn’t saying much. Dean knows he’s giving him space and he silently takes it, thanking Cas in everything but words. They hadn’t talked about it yet; he doesn’t know if they will. It’s not that Dean is
Cas shrugs. “If I understand this correctly, resolutions begin on New Year’s Day. Which is tomorrow. I’ve still got”—he checks the car radio—”two hours.”
----------
“I’m really sorry Dean I don’t get what it is.” Cas says, turning over the Polaroid in his hands again and again, looking at the buttons and flash and trying to figure out its purpose.  Dean’s heart collapses only for a second, before he realizes he’s being stupid, and that will love his gift once he understands how it works.
“No time,” Dean says but of course there was time. There was time for coffee because Dean had cooked a huge breakfast. Eggs, sausage, pancakes, hell, he even made biscuits.
“Sorry, Dean” Cas said. He was not sorry though. Dean was an immaculate creation, an existence of beauty and richness and warmth and strength. Cas could never be sorry.
-------------
“Dean you’re drunk,” was all Cas said, knowing fully that tomorrow Dean would be sober and in love with Lisa and Cas would be nursing a hangover. And that’s it.
“Yes Dean?” Cas replies, his eyes still entranced on Slaughterhouse Five. Dean had recommended it too Cas one day about a week ago, and Cas hadn’t liked the book at first, but with a little persistence Dean managed to make him recognize it’s genius.
What surprised Dean most was not the softness of Cas lips. It wasn’t the sound of Cas’ sighing in his ear or the feeling of him bucking into Dean’s hand. Or the way his pupils flashed wide, how low his voice was in every moan, how needy and handsy and eager Cas was. Or how eager Dean was in turn. Or how encouraging Cas was of Dean, how there was never an awkward moment, only understanding and
“I thought you were supposed to be the fashiony one,” Dean scoffed, pulling out a maroon sweater with a stripe of beige running across the shoulders. It was nice but scratchy and $70? Jesus.
“Do what?”
they’ve seen it before. The memory flashes, that night Dean fell asleep on Cas’ shoulder. He woke up sometime later in the early a.m., eyes dry and scratchy, but he was tucked under the covers. Cas was sitting at the motel table reading something on a laptop, his brow furrowed. Dean remembers his breathing hitching, his effort to even it, his heart hammering. He tried not to move or catch Cas’ attention.
It’s a Tuesday afternoon in the heat of July when Dean asks.
“Punish yourself.”
But next time Dean goes to pick out a tie, somehow the same one always manages to wind up around his neck.
“Uh oh.”
Sam won’t notice, will he? Dean thinks. Fuck, of course he will, Dean immediately realizes.
“You mean you had Christmas in Heaven?” Dean says, eyebrows furrowing.
“Happy New Year’s Eve,” the motel clerk says as Dean pushes out the door to leave. Dean pauses, faintly repeating it back as the door shuts behind him.
“You’re going to Prom. Whether you like it or not.”
Cas shuts the book. “Yes, Dean, after Bible Study we all got wasted and then fed each other milk and cookies” Cas drawled. Dean’s eyes rolled back, head tipping backwards to follow them.
“Dean, you need to eat…”
I have never needed someone more in my entire life and every moment without you feels like I’m suffocating.
Of all the horrible and idiotic things Cas has done in his life, and there have been many, this had to be the worst. Agreeing to go to Prom was not the worst part, hell it wasn’t even the second worst. The worst was the fact that he’d be third wheeling Dean and Lisa.
“Oh,” Dean says, closing his jaw. He keeps turning his head to stare at Cas, as if it's not actually Cas but only some mirage, some döppelganger he picked up in the bar.
“Good. And don’t use my detergent.”
“I’m glad you like it,” is all Cas manages out, a blush creeping out over his cheeks.
Cas is staring at the glimmering stars. The feeling he had earlier is returning, that particular warmth, settling in deep somewhere within his ribcage. Of course, Dean didn’t have to fight those guys. He shouldn’t have walked over to them in the first place. But he did. He did because they were teasing Cas. Because he hated it. Because they were teasing
“Dean,” Sam said, standing before the door. Dean had his back to him but he tensed, hand gripping a shirt.
“Stop, I know you don’t believe me Cas” Dean said, sitting up to look Cas in the eyes. “It’s bullshit no one asked you”
Cas’ eyes widen and he hugs Dean again, murmuring another thank you into his chest.
I would die for you.
“When? I don’t have a birthdate.” Cas asks, turning the page of Slaughterhouse Five.
Dean looks out the window.
“Am I not allowed to be in a good mood?” Cas said, knocking Dean’s shoulder.
“I’m sorry I really thought it would go slowerIthoughtit’dbeeasierIdidn’tmeanto-“
“Not now, Cas”
Cas is driving down a desert road, squinting into headlights as they pass. It’s midnight, or at least a little past. The stars are shimmering like rippling heat, but it must be freezing right now (Cas can’t feel it) because Dean is shivering. He’s sitting shotgun, asleep, his head propped against a flannel bundled loose. His hands are twitching in his lap, he’s curled in on himself. Cas passes a hand over his shoulder, letting a little grace slip out from his fingers as they graze Dean’s shirt. His shivering stalls and he shifts in his seat, murmuring a hum of nothing. He breathes a little deeper. The hunt had gone well enough, simple Salt n Burn of some ghost upset over a mine shaft out in the middle of—as Dean calls it— “butt-fuck nowhere”. Sammy was back at home, arm still in a cast from the last hunt gone south. Just Cas and Dean this time. Cas has been driving for an hour but the hotel’s at least another 30 minutes out, if he even finds it. It’s cacti and desert road and the occasional snore from Dean. He hits the stereo’s nob, keeping the volume low so it doesn’t wake Dean. Dean never plays the radio, only his tapes. They are great, Dean’s tapes, but they never change. The radio is nice. A commercial fades and a piano starts flickering in. The radio’s cutting in and out but a girl’s singing now, lilting above the piano’s falling notes.
“Dean,”
and when Cas remained completely lax, head rolling, Dean had taken him up in his arms and hugged him, gripped him so tight, his breaths coming out ragged, his eyes misting over. Cas had slowly come to, stirring in Dean’s arms and Dean sighed out in relief, but didn’t let go for a moment longer, just squeezed his eyes shut and Cas tighter. He thought he felt Cas’ hands softly tighten around him but soon panic turned to worry and he pulled back. He searched Cas eye’s—blue as a stove top flame— for hurt or blood or a sign that Cas was okay.
Not a date.
“I thought you regretted it. I thought you’d hate me,” Dean says and Cas is flipping them, pushing Dean against the wall.
“These are—” Cas holds up a pair of red long socks, with a blue stripe that cuts across the top. “....These are great Dean, thank you.” Dean just kinda stammers, sputtering like a stalled engine. “Yea, I—uh yea, I, I just saw them and I..I thought you would like them.” Sam’s eyebrows cock to the sky and he shoots Dean a look of Really? Dean ignores him.
“Final answer.” Cas says, smiling at Dean.
“Try me, and if I smile, then you can get your damn picture and we can leave,” Dean says, leaning back against the car.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Sam scoffed, crossing his arms.
Knowing he’s about to get thrown out, he grabs his jacket, Cas, and they bolt. Cas is wide-eyed but doesn’t waver, simply let’s Dean drag him out of the bar as the manager appears in the corner. They’re in the Impala and skidding out of the parking lot before he can even get their plates.
“Well, I’m glad you like it Cas,” Dean said, sitting up a little. “It’s a...it’s a fun holiday time.” A fun holiday time? Pull it together, Dean he thinks. Somewhere between Dean’s brain and his mouth his words were corrupted by Cas’ gaze, garbled, ruffled through and spit out. And that was Dean sober.
“Woah, easy there,” Dean says before Cas can even get an apology out of his mouth.
“I know, it’s just I feel bad taking gifts from you guys, you already do enough and you’ve helped so much and I just don’t feel righ-“
“Cas,” Dean basically whispers, staring at his shoes. “I...I, you know I’m not good with words.”
“Dean,” Cas called out but he kept his head down, didn’t look back as he rounded the corner. “uh...goodnight Cas,” Dean choked out.
Cas springs his wish upon Dean on a quiet Sunday, both of them resting after a regular Salt & Burn that ended last night.
“Dean!” Cas says, looking up from the blade. “Dean it’s incredible, thank you.”
Dean’s heart was already beating hard, but when Cas settled back and laid his hand to rest against Dean’s knee, just so slightly, Dean felt it skitter out of rhythm. In the light and the silence, Cas’ face flushed. Dean told himself it was the booze, that Cas was just a lightweight, and that he was being a fool by sitting forward, propping an arm behind him. Cas’ sleepy eyes widened just slightly as Dean inched forward.
Sam’s present was delicately wrapped, much to Dean’s resentment, as Dean couldn’t wrap for shit, and Cas accepted the gift with a little hesitancy.
“I love you,” Cas says quietly after a couple seconds more of silence. It’s almost a whimper, but Dean hears it. Dean notices Cas’ hesitancy and fear, and tilts Cas head up to meet Cas’ eyes with his.
“Umm, yea, they were out of Sam’s hair gel,” Dean quipped and Sam just furrowed his brow. He didn’t even bother remarking how little that made sense.
“Don’t ask,” Cas says and Dean laughs, wrapping his arms around him tighter.
Dean and Cas go on a hunt together. Cas wears Dean’s fed suit, Dean wears Sam’s (even though its way to big for him). Simple Salt & Burn.
“No Dean really I feel sick,” Cas said, “I think I’m just gonna call my mom to come pick me up,” Cas said, fishing out his phone. Dean grabbed it before he could even unlock it, and put it in his coat pocket.
. Dean slots his hands under Cas’ knees, hoisting Cas higher up on the bed. Cas scrambles back towards the headboard and Dean climbs over him, slotting himself between Cas’ legs. Cas pushes up, just slightly, but it’s all the invitation Dean needs to grind down into him. Cas moans and Dean takes his chin in his hand, tilting his head sideways to kiss hard down his neck. Cas squirms under Dean, bucks up against Dean’s hips, desperate for pressure. Dean just continues down his neck, breath hot and warm and kissing hard as he pulls Cas’ collar down lower, exposing his collarbone.
“Yea, me too,” Dean says, kinda clearing his throat. He looks away from Cas now—tonight was reaching the limits of the human experience as he knew it—but Cas pulled his chin back to him and stared deeper into him. Dean knew he couldn’t hide now. He never could in the first place.
Sam smiles. “Glad you like it. And that’s a journal Cas, so you can write whatever you’re feeling or your day or whatever you like.”
One of them grunts, standing up straight now. He sets his beer down. One crosses his arms. The short one steps closer, sizing Dean up.
"I’m fine, Cas," Dean replies, not even sparing himself a glance. He knows he wouldn’t be able to control himself so close to Cas. Cas. Whose wearing his clothes right now.  Whose breath smells like peppermint and whose smile’s a ray of sunshine.
“Actually yea,” Cas said, loosening up a bit. The worst part was over. Now he could just relax, hang out with his friends, and get wasted.
--------
“Okay try again, this time a little easier,” Dean says, preparing himself for the worst. Surprisingly, Cas gets the car to move without flinging Dean out of his seat.
, or anything like that. He’s hugged Cas before, many times. But this had been...different? It was the second chupacabra in the den that afternoon—the one they hadn’t seen coming— that had thrown Cas against the wall and knocked him out. The fear had pulsed through Dean, his hand moving instinctively. His blade crunched through bone as he stabbed it through the crown of its head. The paw it had raised in the air, the paw that was supposed to rip through Cas’ chest fell. The body hadn’t even hit the ground before Dean kicked it out of the way, falling to his knees to shake Cas’ awake.
“Of course,” Cas says, curling himself inside Dean’s arms and legs, breathing him in deeply. He roots his hands through Dean’s hair, grabs a fistful of his shirt.
“Into town?” Cas says, frowning, remote in hand.
“So make one.”
It rails through him like a train.
Then only half the lights would turn on, because, of course. Dean ended up breaking four ornaments himself, which meant they were then only left with six. The garland only made it a foot up the bottom too because Dean had only bought one pack. In the end, it looked….kinda fucked.
It dawned on Cas that Dean was actually way out of his element but was faking it, only pretending he knew what he was doing. He guessed Dean must have found help online or called Home Depot when Cas wasn’t paying attention.
“So I’ve heard,” Dean replies, grinning against the roll of Cas’ eyes that he can’t see but can seriously feel anyways. Cas just laughs. Dean reaches down and pulls the covers over them, settles in, and turns off the lamp.
“Shhhh,” Cas said, lifting Dean’s chin to kiss him again. They went slow, Cas’ tongue running along Dean’s bottom lip and yes, please, now, Dean opened deeper for Cas. Cas’ hips slowly pushed down into Dean, and Dean bucked into the pressure. Now was not the time to be coy, Dean thought, and grabbed a handful of Cas’ ass. Cas’ was trailing down Dean’s neck now and Dean slowly started lifting Cas’ shift off his back, Cas’ shuddering against the cold air—
“Stop talking Sammy,” Dean said, never turning to look.
confused beyond belief. But then he surges forward, crashing his lips on Dean’s. Dean’s heart begins to race at a thousand miles a minute because he’s kissing
“Dean I’ve been alive for millions of years, the last thing on my mind is my birthday, but to answer you’re question, well…I don’t know” Cas says, putting down his book, “I’ve never really thought about it”
Now they’re sitting, waiting. Dean takes a swig of his beer. Cas eats a tortilla chip. He’s learning to eat, slowly, learning to recognize flavors. Salt is easier, since it’s basically a mineral. The fajitas he eats are supposed to taste like cumin, as Dean tells him, but he doesn’t expect he’ll get much out of it. He usually just eats to make Dean feel comfortable. Dean hates eating alone. After Cas has pushed his food around, Dean will probably just finish off whatever’s left anyways. And Cas will let him, feigning fullness.
“I don’t know. Just thinking. About us,” Cas says, planting a kiss against the Dean’s throat, nosing right under his ear.
“I’m not going to bite you. Stop sneaking around like I’m some fucking broken animal.”
“I don’t know, how about we start with you not dying, huh? Seems like a good reason to me?” Dean says. Cas’ eyes flick over the menu.
“Really?” Cas asked. Dean thought he was going to smell the liquor on his lips, he was that close. His face was red from the alcohol flush, but he definitely was not blushing. No, not blushing. But just as quickly as Cas was there he was leaning back, pulling out the glass Dean had been trying to hide out from behind him back.
“I’m going to kill him,” Dean mutters but Cas is nuzzling his neck.
"Those guys were groping some girl, I wasn’t gonna—”
Dean rolls his eyes. “Cas, you’re supposed to say work out or eat healthy or something stupid.” Cas eyebrows knit together. “Besides, you’re already those things anyways and therefore, you’re cheating.”
“Been ready Dean” Cas said, resting his hand against his arm on the couch.
Cas hmm’d, sipping a little of his coffee.
“No way Cas. There’s no way your gonna spend you birthday in bed. Come out, we’ve made you breakfest, and then we’ve got more things to do. And sleeping in bed all day is not one of them.” Dean said, pulling the covers off Cas’ body. Fortunately, Cas slept in only boxers, and Dean quickly stole a glance at that perfect ass before Cas turned over and Dean looked away. There was nothing more that Dean wanted then to just climb inside the bed and cuddle with Cas all day, but this was Cas and he had feelings, and none of them were for Dean, and Dean wasn’t going to fuck it up because he was a hopeless romantic for someone he couldn’t have.
Soon they arrived back at the bunker, and Dean got out of the car, but Cas was having a tougher time. The seat belt wouldn’t unclick and a growingly frustrated Cas met Dean when he popped his head back inside.
“Cas...how much did that book cost?” Dean asks.
“For Sam,” he says at he hands his gift off. “For Dean.”
“This looks great, thank you Dean,” Cas said, filling a cup of coffee. Someone’s in a nice mood, Dean thought. Cas was usually overflowing with grump in the morning, typically biting off toast and the occasional head, if he could.
By the time they made the eggnog and drank it all (the cookies didn’t make it farther than preheating the oven) they were properly trashed. Thankfully, Sam was out at some book signing or something nerdy. They spilled onto the couch, limbs tumbling into cushions and onto each other. Cas’ foot was brushing against Dean’s shin, just light enough to tickle. Neither moved away. Dean had lit a fire under the TV but neither of them got up to turn it on. They sat in silence for a moment, Dean scratched his arm. It was his nervous habit; Cas knew it well.
The din of their hyena laughs fall flat as Dean steps up to them, putting his hands in his pockets, nodding his chin at them. Each turns to face him, ruddy faced, slightly sweating, their greasy hair slicked back. Dean thinks they’re too young to be real bikers. Probably couldn’t tell a muffler from a spring fork. They’re just shadows of forgotten fathers, still playing with their toys in the street. Children having grown old and big and drunk.
“Smiling is hard Cas.” Dean says, making up the shittiest excuse, so maybe Cas will realize it just will not happen and that’s that. If Cas wants a picture, then fine, but smiling was never part of the deal.
It didn’t surprise Cas when she left not 30 minutes later. Dean would have to fix that later. Probably flowers. No, more like earrings.
“Good,” Cas says, teasing grin on blast and he has to duck from Dean’s fist as he tries to lightly punch Cas’ shoulder. Dean lets out an exasperated sigh, another
to rebel for. Than what I gave everything for.” The tears were slipping now, sliding long streaks down Cas’ face. Dean has been pacing back and forth, every tense muscle rejecting Cas' words, shielding himself from a truth he can't bear to witness. When he looks up and sees Cas, Cas with his hands in his face, Cas racked by sobs, he loses it.
Prom was just liked Cas had imagined. A bunch of awkward high schoolers dancing to songs Cas hated. Yea, an hour was gonna be a long time. Dean seemed excited though, pulling Lisa into the crowd to dance. Dean beckoned for Cas, but Cas simply replied he was gonna grab a drink and then meet them in a few.
No, Dean was caught off guard by just how...easy it was. When they’d both gotten off their briefs and were finally naked, neither squirmed or turned away. They’d both just taken a moment, sat back, breathing each other in and just looking. It was the feeling of falling apart and together at the same time. Gravitating to one another in the soft light of the motel lamp, just an extension of the clothed dance they’d been playing for years.
--------
“Dean, it’s okay, you don’t have to—”
He cornered Dean in the laundry room.
He’s cut off midthought as Cas’ lips meet his, and for a second Dean can’t even comprehend what’s going on. Soon enough his mind catches up to his lips and he backs up quickly, racking his mind for an excuse as to why he kissed Cas, even if he doesn’t remember doing it. Maybe he did it subconsciously or maybe his hand slipped on the seat and he fell forward.
“I know,” Dean says, lowering his head down to breathe in Cas, patchouli and dirt and pine.
“I don’t know,” Dean nearly whispers. He pinches the bridge of his nose. He pauses, hand propped up in the air before letting it fall. “I don’t know, Cas, I just…” He turns to the window again.
They talk about a possible hunt in Cheyenne. They talk about Sam, about new parts Dean needs for Baby, about plans for winter in the bunker. About Cas’ garden and the greenhouse they were building. Cas had protested to Dean’s help at first since he didn’t want to bother Dean but Dean had insisted. He wouldn’t let Cas
Dean flexes his hand in his lap. Something pops, broken. He sighs. He rubs his hand over his face, shifts in his seat. He leans forward, putting his hands into his face. He waits a long time before he speaks. He leans back, throwing his hands up in the air. “I’m sorry. I...I didn’t mean to make you worry. I...Let’s just forget it.”
“Hi boys,” Dean says. There’s no hint of affection.
Cas is looking over too now, faintly smiling. He knows Dean expected a telling-off—he probably deserves it anyways—but Cas can’t summon the energy. Or the will to care. In fact, he doesn’t tell Dean off because he doesn’t really want to.
Finally Sam finished eating, (“You can’t eat to fast, Dean. You won’t properly digest”- Ya ya ya)(a bunch of bullshit if you ask Dean) and they got to presents.
Dean didn’t respond.
“Oh,” Cas says, looking down. “I see.”
“Hmmm, think again,” Dean says, right as Cas is about to shoot. Cas looks up, catches Dean’s eyes, brows furrowed.
“Put your foot on the brake,” Cas says, and does so. He earns a grin from Dean and Cas heart jumps a tad, but it quickly grows cold with the realization that he’s driving and if he screws up Dean will kill him and this is his car and what if he’s horrible and what if-
“Cas,” Dean muffled into Cas’ shirt, his nose nuzzling into Cas’ neck.
“And where did you even get the money?” Dean says, remembering that Cas, you know, doesn’t have a job.
For kissing you, For not being who you need me to be. For not being strong, open, willing. Dean thinks. But that is now what he says.
“Let me grab my jacket and keys, and I’ll meet you outside, okay?” Dean says as he rounds the corner for the hallway to his room, his voice light and quite from the distance.
Cas sighs. “...Only from yourself,” he says, almost to himself more than Dean.
“Dean.”
“Hmm, I believe I did, yes” he says, eyes squinting, mouth crooking up into a grin. “Did you forget?”
“Yea, since when did you bake, Dean?” Sam said, mocking sincerity. It was a fair quip; Dean had been jabbing at him all day.
Cas fucked up. He knew it; he always did when it came to this stuff. Dean and Lisa should be here without him, enjoying their prom without Cas third wheeling them awkwardly. Cas had been so stupid. Dean obviously only invited him because he felt bad. He probably wished Cas had just ditched, leaving him and Lisa to a night together. Cas set his glass down and went to the bathroom, knowing in full he’d a least find some peace there.
“Dean,” Cas says, trying to catch up.
“Me.” Dean said quietly, picking at his fingernails.
When it’s all said and done, when the haze of greed and lust and need clears, when the room falls silent except for their even breaths, Dean closes his eyes. He waited for the shoe to drop, for the air to be sucked out of the room, for Cas to pull off and turn in shame or regret or embarrassment or whatever. But Cas doesn’t move. Neither does Dean. They only lie there, Cas’ fingers trailing slow circles over Dean’s chest. Dean brings his hand to scratch through Cas’ hair and Cas sighs so slightly. The fear Dean expected, the nuclear fall-out, the fighting, the
Their ties. They’re switched.  Fuck, they must have mixed them up when they were getting dressed in the car. Fuck, how could they be so careless. Dean curses under his breath.
“I was only going to ask if you were okay,” Cas says. He notices the swelling rising in Dean’s hand. He reaches over, brushing his fingertips from the knuckle down to the wrist. Dean’s skin is hot, nearly vibrating. It stills under Cas’ fingers, wisps of grace lick licking across Dean’s skin. They dance light blue across the back of Dean’s hand, somehow warming and cooling in the same breath. Dean says oh and then thank you, flexing his hand.
Cas is walking towards him leisurely in a way that suggests he knows he has forever with Dean, because he does.
Dean swallows all of it. He vowed to never miss a spot, to make sure Cas knows he wants him, all of him.
him. But he chokes down a sob everytime he thinks about it; how will he ever say it, or act on it? Cas deserves all the love in the word and more. He’s a fucking angel, after all. Surely he won’t settle for someone as perpetually fucked up as Dean, right?
When Dean comes out of the shower with just a towel on, Cas is still achingly hard. Cas buried his head in the pillow, trying to will his erection to reduce so he could get up and get ready for the day. Dean’s physique wasn’t helping; he’s all muscle, water droplets running over his nipples, an incredible v-line leading Cas’ eyes straight to-
divine.
“You know how we’re, like, best friends, Cas?” Cas nods encouragingly. “Well, I think that we, um, at least from my end, might be, um… a different kind of friends. You know?”
“I’m impartial to your sexual or romantic relationships, Dean. It does not bother me with whom you engage with.” Dean sighs at Cas’ robot answer, and Cas senses that he wants more, letting his guard down. “Thank you for telling me, Dean. You know that nothing like this could impact our friendship. I’ve got your back, as humans say.”
Dean’s never sucked a dick before, but he’s had his sucked many, many times, so he’s just reenacting the shit that made him go crazy. He sunk his mouth all the way to the base of Cas’ cock and then moaned softly, eliciting a wild response from Cas. Cas’ knees are shaking as Dean glances up at him with his nose nestled in Cas’ curly pubes. Cas’ head is hung back, his eyes rolling back in his head, and Dean might cum from the sight alone. He’s never seen Cas in such a raw, natural state. With no grace, Dean thinks Cas fucks like an animal. And he loves it.
Dean and Cas spend most of their day either at the Police Station or the local library. Dean isn’t a big fan of reading, so at 5pm when Cas notices Dean rubbing his temples and fidgeting, he takes over. Dean’s a sore loser and doesn’t like letting people down, but Cas smiles at him like he hung the sun in the sky and gives him a pat on the shoulder.
Cas is only a few inches away when he stops. His eyes meet Dean’s, which are filled with tears, and he wonders if Dean can even see through them. They stay there for what feels like hours, feeding off of each others aura’s, bathing in the feeling of being close again. Dean is the one who speaks first.
Cas is patient and understanding as Dean rambles on. “You know you can talk to me about anything, Dean. You don’t have to be nervous.”
. Dean is a pro at repressing feelings. When he doesn’t reply, instead staring at his drink and swishing the liquid around, the bartender lifts one eyebrow. “Unless that’s… uh… what you’re wanting?”
Cas says nothing but a grunt of approval, and Dean raises his eyebrow. “What’s up with you today, Cas? What’s got your panties in a twist?”
When Cas is finally under the covers on his side, Dean sighs contently. “Goodnight, Cas.”
“Dean?” Cas snaps Dean out of his stare with a questioning glance, a small smile still resting on his lips. “Are you ready to go inside?”
Cas blushes, “Of course not, Dean. I always enjoy your company.”
Shit. Cas can’t possibly get up now.
Dean brings his mouth towards Cas’ bulge and exhales a hot breath that hits Cas through this underwear, making him shiver. Dean bites his lip and begins to remove Cas’ underwear, seconds away from seeing his most-dreamt-about cock ever.
When Dean comes, white drops of his release land on Cas’ chest and hips. Dean is a little embarrassed, he’s shaking and relying completely on Cas to hold him upright, and he sees Cas reach a single finger to his chest, dragging slowly. Cas is staring at him longingly when Dean meets his eyes, lifting his finger to his mouth and tasting Dean.
“Handsome ‘goddamn’ idiots?” Cas lifts his eyebrow, a challenging smirk on his lips.
“I’m heading out.” Dean shouts as he walks back towards the Impala. Cas barely has time to comprehend what he’s said before the front door slams behind him. Sheesh, Cas thinks. Someone did not regain consciousness on the correct side of the bed, and consequently is experiencing an onset of negative emotions. Or, as the humans say, woke up on the wrong side of the bed.
Cas’ face looks like a deer in headlights, but with a little more remorse. “Dean! I’m so sorry, these cups all just fell out, I didn’t mean to wake you, oh gosh!”
He takes the tip of Cas’ cock in his mouth, swirling his tongue around and around, exhaling warmly. Cas is shivering, his cock throbbing, his fingers gripping the base of Dean’s hair follicles so hard his scalp turns white. Cas is oddly quiet, so quiet that if Dean didn’t know any better he’d think he was shy. Cas is breathing so heavy now, gasping and growling and rocking his hips forward as Dean swallows him down deep.
Cas smiles and lets himself lean into Dean’s palm for a second. He exhales slowly, “Yeah. Okay.”
If he was slowly and deliberate before, he’s a wild animal now. He’s grinding against Cas’ thigh, letting his own thigh slip between Cas’ legs. He wants to feel Cas on him. He’s dreamt of this moment for so long, but he’s drowning in it, and he can’t think of anything else except Cas’ lips on his.
“It sounds like that’s a good place to start then, man. You don’t have to start carrying around a gay flag wherever you go. Just let it happen, whatever it is.” He leans forward and puts a hand on Dean’s shoulder. “It’s pretty clear that you’ve got something serious going on for this guy. Don’t let your insecurities or worries get in the road. It’s not often that we feel that way about someone.”
“- is something i know i can’t have.” Despite the weight of his words and the tears rolling down each cheek, Cas smiles. He knows that Dean knows what he means. Dean knows Cas knows that he knows. It’s been like this for years, but neither of them have ever had the balls to say it. Dean feels shaky and nauseous. He doesn’t ever want to think about a world without Cas. He’d spend a million years in Hell if he could spend one more day here with Cas, he thinks. The air is heavy with the tension of forbidden love; Cas can taste it on his tongue. Dean doesn’t say anything, but Cas never expected him to. Cas knows, deep down, that Dean loves him. He doesn’t need Dean to say it, but that doesn’t stop him from wanting to hear it. He wants to look away, to save Dean some heartache, to catch his own breath without Dean hearing him choke down his tears. He doesn’t.
Cas wakes up that morning to steam spilling out of the bathroom, dancing in the morning light, and the smell of sticky arousal. Cas looks under the duvet; nope, no morning wood. And then it hits him - it’s Dean. And if he listens closer, his Angel senses can hear his soft grunts and the sound of what Cas can only assume is his hand slipping forcefully along his shaft.
, but that plan was ruined the second he pulled Dean from hell. Really, that second: his hand touched Dean’s shoulder and it felt like the very atoms that made up his vessel were reborn. He really didn’t believe in love at first sight until he met Dean. He had tried multiple times, with several female counterparts, to force onto other people this bond - this love - that he feels for Dean, even having sex with a few women, but to no avail. Sex wasn’t even as exciting as humans made it out to be. Cas wants to think about how it might be different with Dean, with two male bodies intertwined, but he doesn’t let himself. He closes his eyes and listens to the voice of the narrator on animal planet bouncing off of the empty walls.
Cas usually isn’t one to swear, but fuck.
He kneels down slowly, maintaining eye contact with Cas as he reaches forward and undoes Cas’ belt. He does it slow, brushing his hand against Cas’ cock through his jeans, wanting Cas to beg for it. After about 30 seconds, Cas is whining and grinding forward slightly. He grumbles a little and then sighs, “Please, Dean.”
It’s silent for a few minutes, but the air is calm. The walls of the bunker are strong around the two men, holding their little bubble of happiness tight.
“I’m in love with you, Cas. You know I have been for a long time. I-“ He sniffles again, taking his hand away from Cas’ waist for a moment to wipe his cheeks clear of tears again. Cas exhales and his face breaks out into a stunning grin. “I’m so, so sorry I didn’t say it before, I’m so sorry for being stupid and insecure and I love you. So much that it has me crying like a fucking baby. I never wanted you to feel like I didn’t want to say it back, but I just couldn’t say it then.”
“I-“ He begins, his voice shaky and broken, and he thinks this is fucking Heaven, why is my voice still breaking?!. He takes a deep breath, as if he’s trying to suck courage from the air around him in order to say what he needs to. “I didn’t say it back, Cas.”
Dean groans and rubs his head in his hands. “Shut up, man. I don’t know why i say things sometimes.”
Dean catches his eyes and replies. “Yeah, Cas. Handsome goddamn idiots.”
Cas is grinning so wide that his cheeks hurt, nodding so Dean continues.
Dean is a little taken aback when Cas doesn’t squint in the sun as he unlocks the door. He forgets that Cas is, like, an angel and shit. Stepping into the room, Cas holds the door open for Dean. “Thanks.” He doesn’t meet Cas’ eyes.
Dean absolutely loses it.
“‘Night, Cas.”
Dean hides the blush on his cheeks by locking eyes with the floor and allows himself to be led to the car. He fingers his pockets for the keys, slips them into the ignition, and they head for the hotel. The sky is pitch black, and Dean wonders how long he was out for. Surely a little library like that wouldn’t be open late into the night, right?
Dean blinks awake, prying his limbs from where they’re attached to the sticky leather. Cas is leaning over him, one hand gesturing to the lights being turned off in the library, and the other resting gently on his upper arm. Dean jumps out of the chair, his legs still waking up. Cas uses the hand on Dean’s arm to help steady him, and offers a shy smile. Dean returns it, slightly embarrassed.
Dean has a fire in his chest and Cas feels it burning, drinking it up through Dean’s lips. When Dean grabs his ass, Cas almost growls approvingly into the kiss, but manages the last sliver of self control.
Cas obeys and waits for Dean’s next instruction. With Cas standing in front of him, lips swollen from kissing, neck adorned with his hickeys, cock hard in his jeans, Dean feels content. He’s waited his whole life to find someone who looks at him this way. To think he was there, beside him, for so long makes him shiver with regret, and then shiver again with anticipation for what is about to come. (Literally)
He mumbles his way through their conversation, and as soon as Dean’s gone, he jumps out of bed and into the shower, praying the warm water will calm him down. It does, but he can’t help but think about what just occurred and what it actually means for the two of them. Sure, they’ve always had a bit of a different relationship than other friendships, but Cas had never even though about what that truly means.
Dean slams down his gun onto the table. “Exactly! You shouldn’t have to! Damnit Cas. Everybody—every. single. person—I have ever loved I have gotten killed or watched die. I am not going to let that be you. ” Their voices echo off the bunker’s tall walls, parroting them back in distortion. “You deserve better, you deserve a real life, not this. Not hunting, not dying, not this."
“Yea, but then you’ll set me up to nail this in right here. And you’re two balls behind.”
Dean stops talking, stares down at his hands. Cas stares forward in the road, unflinching when the headlights blind him.
“Hmm…okay…” Cas says before continuing.
“Don’t worry Cas, it won’t bite,” Dean says jokingly.
“I wasn’t going to.” Cas says, sighing. “....They were dicks. They had it coming.”
Dean cuts him off midsentence by grabbing his tie and yanking him forward, flush unto him. He kisses the lights of out him, yanking his tie off to expose the side of Cas’ neck. He takes no time in making his way down to suck a hickey right under Cas’ jaw, and at this point is practically grinding himself into Cas.
“I need you, Cas.”
“Thanks,” Cas said a bit sadly. A silence fell over them.
Cas just got up and left.
“Please Dean let me sleep.” Cas said, angrily pulling up the covers over his head to try and stop Dean from continuing to be a nuisance.
“They’re lucky it was you,” Cas says. “I probably would’ve just smited them.” Dean chokes on nothing, then bursts out laughing. He’s doubling over again, nearly driving them into oncoming traffic. He straightens the car, laughing still, running his hand down his face. He glances over at Cas again. Cas is trying to hide a grin by looking out the window.
“But I’ll make it,” Cas says, pulling off the table.
They spend another hour or so on the road, Cas learning to park and reverse and turn and a few other things. The sunlight begins to fade and Dean checks his watch. 6:30.
“We uhh…” Cas started.
Putting up the tree took longer than Dean had anticipated. First, they couldn’t decide where to put it.
“Hiyaa Cas,” Dean said, trying to shelter the glass from Cas’ view by moving in front of it. His movement was a little too quick and somehow also too slow.
“Sorry to interrupt, but did you know Cas’ wasn’t planning on going to Prom? No? You think he should, right?” Dean said, holding up a ‘wait’ finger to Cas, who had returned to his seat on the couch.
Now Cas rolls his eyes, steels himself against a grin. Something had really gotten into Dean tonight. He was clearly feeling bold. Sometimes when Dean got drunk he let things slip, or teased a little harder, or let innuendos hang in the air. But tonight he was sober. He wonders if it would last.
