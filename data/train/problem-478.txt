Mrs. Hudson snatched a magazine off a side table and swatted him with it, herding him toward the door. “You could roll around in a dumpster and he’d still have it off with you in a heartbeat. GO, you ridiculous man!”
I know you say Mary’s death wasn’t my fault, but I still feel responsible. If I hadn’t done what I always do, if I hadn’t been so arrogant, Rosie would still have her mother. That said, I’ve accepted that for whatever reason, you have chosen to forgive me, and if you and I are ever going to be fully okay ever again then we need to learn to both give and receive forgiveness.
"Sherlock," he said, leaning in close to murmur the words for his ears only. "You have to consider things in context, okay? You had it exactly right this morning. I'd been repressing everything for years, dating girls I didn't even really like just to prove to myself that I hadn't been staring at my rugby captain's arse. When I was deployed and discovered Army hookup culture, it was..." He chuckled. "Like a man offered water in a desert.  I tried to tell myself for a long time, and even after I got back, that I may have been bisexual, but that I preferred women and only ever slept with men when women weren't an option. But now I… I actually think, uh..."
John strolled in, settling himself casually on the edge of the sofa as though just dropping by. “I thought I’d stop round on my way home, see how you were doing.”
Finally, finally, John came to a halt at the small table and stopped, still beaming like a fool. “Hey,” he said ridiculously.
He stayed there for a moment until both their tremors subsided and then he gently pulled out, reaching for the towel and wiping Sherlock carefully before cleaning himself. He tossed the towel to the ground and crawled up to pull Sherlock tenderly into his arms. He cradled Sherlock’s bony shoulders—still bright white in the moonlight—and stroked his hair from his face.
John turned at the cry and saw Tank barrelling past the nurses at the front as though they were not even there. He was clutching a burned. bloody bundle in his arms and John realized in horror that it was Leo. “Oh my God,” he said.
“I’ll bring the car around,” Watson said. He dipped his chin in the direction of Lestrade’s teacup and said, “Go ahead and finish that, might take a minute.”
Sherlock kept his eyes closed. If he didn’t see his humiliation reflected in John’s eyes, maybe it wasn’t happening.
“You thought that you would take him by surprise and slash his face,” Sherlock said. His voice was low and very level. “He didn’t even know who you were, did he? He’d never seen you before. Maybe he didn’t even know you existed. He and Mandy weren’t in regular contact, at least not until she contacted him when she thought she could earn a little extra money by procuring cocaine for Toby Hartwell. She didn’t have any intention of using it herself, did she? What happened?”
Sherlock slowed to a walk, panting and winded; the trees were not thick but were too close together for running. He looked over his shoulder just as in the distance the floodlights at the convent came up again. Then he began to run anyway.
“That’s my Lord the Earl’s horse. Who might you be?” In spite of the coat and hat this was clearly no villager—his accent was far too posh. A guest?
“She go,” Yulia hissed, tugging at John’s arm. He broke the kiss, feeling utterly stunned, looking at Sherlock’s closed eyes and parted lips still inches from his own. He felt a shocked sense of loss. “Hey! You John! She go!”
“Boarding school in Switzerland.” She was still eating, her tone unchanged; if Sherlock hadn’t been watching he wouldn’t have known tears were trickling down her cheeks. “Put most of the money in Switzerland too. They’ll be okay. We set up my best friend as guardian.”
Sherlock nodded agreement. “They’ve made a witch hunt. It’s really quite clever when you think of it--no need to frame anyone when you can convince the people to accuse themselves. I want to see those papers. Let’s go faster, this part of the path is quite straight.”
“No I won’t interfere, no I won’t leak anything to the press, and of course I’ll pass anything I find along to her. How long?”
Greaves lifted the bottle to the lantern light and studied it. His eyebrows went up at the label, but he said only, “And considerably harder to sell, I’d say. Not really my market, this stuff.”
“Oh, Valentine’s Day,” Sherlock said, relieved at the prospect of not having to take Lestrade out for a pint.
The weather finally cleared the day before Molly was to leave for the country. London took on a festive, finally-summer air, people out in the streets smiling instead of skulking behind their curtains peering suspiciously at the neighbors. Molly gave a little skip as they walked to church.
Sherlock rolled his eyes inside his hood. Everyone knew that Colonel Moran was the hero of Ireland, an honorific he’d received for brutally suppressing the Irish rebellion. He was a brute of a man, a small-eyed, broad-shouldered thug in a uniform. Sherlock hadn’t looked at Moriarty, though somehow he always knew when Moriarty made one of his infrequent appearances in London; he seemed to feel the man’s eyes crawling over him no matter how far he withdrew into his hood.
“Christ, Sherlock, I can’t. We’re at Mark and Julia’s, you remember from the wedding? They’re having a bit of a baby shower for us. Maybe tomorrow—“
“He’s just happy because you’re the only one stupid enough for him to beat,” Elyer said, passing him a platter filled with torn chunks of
a midlife crisis. It’s not a crisis at all, and as you’ve correctly pointed out, actuarial estimates—“ a thought occurred to him. “Do you know what, strike that. It’s not a midlife crisis, it’s a post life celebration. I was never meant to live this long.”
Mycroft considered. “There was a window, with a window seat. The trim and the seat were white. You would stand on the seat—“
“In a warehouse in Shahrisabz.” Sherlock had already decided to give that one up; Saidimir had surely told them anyway.
“She was pretty. Really pretty, and she had nice clothes…she had some fancy dresses in the guest room where I stayed when I was over there and I used to look at them.” Jayla’s face suddenly lit with an almost mischievous smile: a child’s glee at knowing an adult secret. “She had a fake dresser!”
And he meant it. The events of the lake seemed a lifetime ago, the concerns that had been so enormous now completely irrelevant. He knew he would never leave Sherlock. He would just have to be strong, that was all.
Sherlock dropped the hairpin in his pocket and pushed carefully at the door. He felt resistance, but the door slid forward smoothly enough. He stopped and peered through the crack. He could see practically nothing: dim light, and what seemed to be a rack of shelves full of boxes in front of the door. He listened, but heard no sound.
“I would like to lick John,” he finally managed, settling back down and looking up into John’s eyes. “I would like to lick you
“I trust you won’t be offended that I can’t say the same,” he said grumpily, but he squeezed her outstretched hand warmly enough. “Aren’t you going to tell me your name?”
Once they’d got their trousers off it became obvious that they needed to move to the bed for John to continue mapping Sherlock’s legs, but that proved distracting: they ended in a tangle of arms and legs and kisses. Sherlock pressed against John’s naked body as though trying to meld them together. John felt fantastic: strong and warm and slightly scratchy with hair, his thick sturdy cock pressing up against Sherlock’s hip, and Sherlock could not get enough of him.
Wiggins shook his head. “Haven’t heard anything about Russians. I did hear they were connected though, have some powerful friends, if you follow me.”
Sherlock shrugged. “Farther north, lack of buildings to block the wind. The weather patterns are actually quite fascinating.”
John rolled his eyes. Sherlock worked his way up to the landing, where he collapsed against the wall on the pretense of looking out the window.
John pictured Sherlock pinning his laser gaze on Nick as he clutched his penis clinically, asking, “Do you prefer more friction on the head? Fast or slow?” Oh dear. “Well, you can, but remember not to break the mood,” he improvised. “You can be like, ‘Is this good?’ or “Do you like it harder?’.  But kind of breathe it into his ear, don’t act like you’re interrogating a suspect. Throw some kissing in.”
“I know, I know, but it’s not terrible—what I did was, there’s some tide pools down the cliff path. They’re warm from the sun so I went in one to scrub off and took a bucket of water along to rinse the salt off, so it wasn’t too bad. I’d like for you to get those open wounds in the salt water anyway; I’ve nothing to wash them with, not even soap.”
A week passed. Where the hell was the coup? John by now knew Dalmatia’s actual name—the cancelled elections had made the international news—and one night he gave in to his curiosity and opened Google.
The Devil’s Foot turned out to be not a foot at all but a pub. Several years ago, in a back room following an after-hours poker game, two people had been found dead and one permanently brain damaged. The cause of all three turned out to be severe hypertensive crisis.
“Your dark secret! What you do on Tuesday nights! I know you have one, you wouldn’t have agreed to this meeting else, but I can’t work out what it is. Willfen and Bonaventure are both having affairs, Patterson is playing internet poker—he’s set it up very cleverly, did you know? He got a pay raise and arranged to have part of it deposited into a separate account and he uses it as his gambling allowance, every Thursday night, using the wifi at Café Milano. The same Café Milano you drive to every Tuesday, with Paul Willfen, who then meets his mistress. But you—what? You don’t drink, you don’t smoke, you don’t cheat on your wife, you’re to all appearances an upstanding citizen, C of E every Sunday, so what do you
Mary was right. The minute the plane lifted into the air, John felt all the anger and resentment he had been cherishing crumble away like rotten ice, and grief and regret came rushing in. He made it into the back seat of the car where Mary put her arms around him, and then he cried as he had never cried before in his adult life.
John blinked. “No.” They had never really talked about what Sherlock had got up to whilst he’d been away. Sherlock had dropped a few casual asides here and there, but certainly nothing about being captured, and John hadn’t asked. At first he’d been too resentful and later...it just never seemed to come up.
“Oh, yes,” Sherlock said, stealing a glance at the clock. Would this session ever end?  His face was beginning to hurt.
“What?” John looked up from where he had pulled his chair over to the fire, away from the games and chatter at the long table.
Lestrade has settled into his new life, although he still doesn’t feel like joining the dating world yet. His kids are his first priority, followed by his job, and he is surprised to realize that he is really quite happy with the way things are. He has his cozy flat and his cat and his friends, and it is enough for now.
“Hold on,” John said. Sherlock heard footsteps, stairs, doors creaking. A drawer opened. John’s gun, Sherlock thought. Then John was back on the line: “Everything’s where it should be. What’s going on?”
By the time he had stripped all the way down to his vest and pants Sherlock was wet and throbbing, but the sense of panic had receded, and the crackling along his spine no longer had such a vicious edge to it. Clearly the water was spiked, laced with just enough low-grade tranquilizer to keep him from actually hurting himself. Fine, Sherlock thought, and gulped down another, the water cooling the burning only briefly.
Sherlock couldn’t help smiling. He was alone, truly alone, for the first time in months, and he went outside and sat on the wall to enjoy it, turning his face up to the sun. He would go for a walk soon, work on getting his strength back, and then he would sit in the sun and read his book. There were much worse ways to spend the day.
“Yeah, I know,” John said. His own voice sounded oddly flattened, as though all the warmth had leaked out of him too. “It’s just that…right now, until…Sherlock, if I come round I’m going to end up touching you, and if I start touching you, I won’t be able to stop.”
Sherlock wriggled his way around, frowning as he attempted to keep his balance with his hands tied, and John took a piece of ice from the bowl he had set on the bedside table and popped it into his mouth. When Sherlock had finally got himself maneuvered around to a fair approximation of where he was supposed to be, John spit out the ice, took him by the back of the head, and plunged his chilled tongue into Sherlock’s mouth. Sherlock gasped at the sensation—God, he felt so hot--and dropped his head back, letting John take possession of his warm mouth. John reached for the ice, still kissing, and slowly ran the edge of the ice cube over Sherlock’s collarbone.
kill anyone he’d make such an excellent job of it that no one would ever catch him. Lestrade devoutly hoped he never did.
Sherlock shook his head. He was very flushed, one hand at his nipple and the other between his legs, twisting and panting. John licked his lips. “You want them, don’t you? Look how you’re spreading your legs.”
He’d ring her when he got back. The nephrologist’s nurse, asking him to reschedule the follow up appointment he’d missed--damn, he had forgotten all about that. Oh well, couldn’t be helped. He had a handful of texts: Mycroft,
Sherlock had gone completely white, but he stood fast. “And why would you do that?” he asked, eyebrows raised.
“Oh, I didn’t say that, darling,” she said, smiling. “But why try to publish fake allegations of impropriety when I can get you the real dirt on tax evasion?”
John had been lying on his side, watching the shifting patterns of sun and shade on the endless expanse of rolling landscape spread below him, the ever-changing vista of clouds and sky—not to mention the play of the light over Sherlock’s long, elegant naked flank—but that brought his attention back. “Why on earth? I don’t mind taking the bus, you know that. I like the bus.”
John smiled weakly. He did not say that he was not worried so much about Sherlock’s lungs as about his backside; he could not help feeling that Sherlock was likely to attract exactly the wrong attention from Mr. Brocklehurst. Not that there was a good kind to attract.
“You knew,” Sherlock said. His voice was thready with pain and exhaustion. “You knew he was afraid of the dark.”
Matthew raised his head. His eyes were glistening, and John saw the relief and misery in his face. “I just wanted to hurt him. I didn’t want him to die. I wasn’t even trying to make him brain-dead, like Mandy...” His voice broke. “But her face. Her face was beautiful, before. I just wanted to make him pay for that much. I thought that was fair.”
Sherlock glared. Part of him wanted to stay angry—it was a relief to feel anything besides despair, and he recognized dimly that he was more resentful than he’d realized that John didn’t seem to appreciate that he’d done all this for him—but most of him wanted, desperately, to hope.
“Oh shit,” John said suddenly, frowning in the direction of the house. “Somebody’s given Harry champagne. Sit tight, will you? I’ll be right back.”
Sherlock had been trying desperately to think of how to break the news to John gently, of how John himself would have done it, but now he gave up. It wasn’t going to go well in any case. “Mary’s real name is Anna Grace Ransome. She trained as a marksman in the Australian Defence Force and went freelance as an assassin known as Agra. You might remember the name as one of Moriarty’s more skilled subordinates. She began building her Mary Morstan identity five years ago and assumed it full time after Moriarty’s death, at which point she apparently retired from active work as a contract killer. I believe that her relationship with you is genuine, by the way. Her cover was blown some months ago by someone who sold the information to Charles Augustus Magnussen, whom Mary killed. Unfortunately it appears the information had already been passed on.”
Sherlock came back with a slight start. His gaze sharpened. “You aren’t eating that samosa,” he said. ”You want it, but you’re hoping the vegan will have your shirt off next time and you’re feeling insecure about your physique. You needn’t. Your body mass index is completely appropriate for a man of your age and she finds your level of fitness attractive. She probably showed you pictures of her companions on the camping expedition and you’re thinking about her fit vegan friends, but you shouldn’t, she prefers men with a sturdier build; ultra fit types like long distance runners lack the body fat to—“ He stopped abruptly, bright red flooding his face.
They talked about Nepal and the meditation center in Los Angeles (“I’d like to be a vegetarian, but, you know, it’s hard…”) and the warrior monks at Sherlock’s monastery, which fascinated Michael. Sherlock forgot his nerves and began to relax. He looked Michael over covertly—he was a little easier to take in sitting down—but there wasn’t much he could read; Michael might as well have come from another planet.  His clothing was excellent, Sherlock could tell that much, and he was impeccably groomed, with hair so short as to be nearly shaved. His skin was very dark and his eyes crinkled when he smiled.
The sunlight began to fade in the late afternoon, so Sherlock packed his sewing away and switched on the lamp. After reading every book on yachting and navigation the bookstore had to offer, he’d finally got bored enough to start reading
Sherlock rolled his eyes, but John could see him smiling. “And why am I switching out Lestrade’s phone for this?”
“Mine or his?” Sherlock peered at the phone. “This is the one you had when I first met you, the one your sister gave you. Why do you still have it? I thought you tossed it when you upgraded.”
, tipped him over and he lost his breath entirely, head thrown back and suddenly silent, crying out soundlessly, as heat rushed through his groin and shot wet over his hand.
Over the racket of both their shouting John heard a new sound, a heavy irregular dragging. He strained his ears, but the rain and thunder made it impossible to pinpoint where it was coming from . The noise was getting softer, as though moving away. “Sherlock?” John tried again. “Simon! Did you tell them to send an ambulance?”
Sherlock put his hand flat on the floor and pushed it under the door as far as he could. He felt John’s fingertips touch his on the other side.
Sherlock felt a chill, though surely that was ridiculous. “It’s over. I’ve taken out all of your soldiers, and I’m never going with you. Put the gun down.”
“You’re wrong,” Reilly hissed. “I did it all myself. He was miserable with that spoilt silly omega, he was practically crying. I fixed it for him, and he’ll cover this up so we can be together, you wait and see.”
“Notify the family, and start interviewing everyone who knew her. We’ll have someone back here tomorrow looking for the busker.”
Halfway up the stairs he stopped, pausing to mop at his eyes, which had begun streaming uncontrollably. Which was why he was still within earshot when Mycroft, clearly believing him to have gone all the way to his room, said in a low icy whisper, “And what if he gave Sherlock AIDS? Have you thought of that?”
“When?” John said, fascinated. Sherlock almost never talked about his past. John had the impression he had deliberately deleted as much as possible.
Mummy and Mycroft weren’t allowed in the omega ward, of course, but Father stayed with him the whole time. It was all a slurry memory, foggy wanting and burning thirst, hazy from the drugs they’d given him. Once he’d recovered, he and Father and Mummy sat in the office with the omega doctor as she explained how the suppressants worked, how the implant would be replaced every five years or taken out if he wanted to have children, how it was indistinguishable from an alpha’s implant, how being an omega would have no effect on his life at all.
“Sounds yummy,” Jezebel said. There was a pause, then she said, “And what would Mel’s name be then?”
“Really?” She clicked around on the blog. “Army doctor. Bit of a grey area, that. I’ll have to think on it.”
Simon smiled at him, eyes crinkling. “I think Sherlock is lucky too,” he said. “Ah! Here we are!” The path had opened out into a wide valley, ringed on three sides by rocky hills. Simon pulled out a pair of binoculars and began scanning the hillsides.
DI MacDougall did not sound completely surprised when Sherlock rang her back with the solution, which led Sherlock to suspect she hadn’t been quite as stumped as she’d claimed when she’d phoned. She professed to be deeply grateful, however.
“Oh dear,” Mrs. Hudson said, leaning over to peer at his foot. “You won’t be able to wear that back to the Veilgarden tomorrow, it’s supposed to rain. Have you got another pair?”
“Not just her. We should have a spate of christenings coming up, and there will be some presentations as well—Sister Adelaide had her baby whilst you were away, just one, and a boy at that.”
John came out carrying his drink and sat down in his old chair, looking at the fire. Sherlock watched him covertly, but John barely seemed aware of him; he was staring into the flames with that hard closed expression Sherlock associated with the weeks after Sherlock had been shot. Sherlock picked up his tea out of habit, but of course it had gone cold. His skin itched. He folded his hands in his lap, then clasped his wrists tightly, as though to keep himself from digging at the thin skin of his inner arms, or perhaps from flying apart.
The coffee helped. John managed to stretch it out over more than an hour, eating half the sandwich as well, and then took a break so he could have a piss against a tree in a convenient copse whilst Sherlock added petrol. The sky had finally darkened.
“You don’t need them to see you. You just want everyone to know you’ve had me. Marked up and messy and used.” Sherlock hooked his fingers and drew his nails over the exposed part of his chest. He didn’t even really leave scratches—just red lines—but the sight heated the blood in John’s veins. He’d never particularly had that desire, to mark and claim, but surely that was part of the appeal of a pristinely untouchable dancer, wasn’t it? Like wanting to leave footprints on fresh snow.
“Because there’s no other way,” Sherlock said very quietly. “Because it will be the last time. Because at least this way—“ his eyes faltered away from John’s. “—at least this way you won’t be expected to participate.”
When they’d all got settled with their tea and dispensed with John’s effusive praise of Hobbes, Donovan said to Sherlock, “I had a call from your mum. She’s coming up to take us to tea Saturday.”
“Oh Christ,” John said, letting his head thump back against the barn wall. “They know about Callie, don’t they? I
“I need to convince Trevor to give up her line of research,” Sherlock said patiently. “I told you before. We don’t know what Moriarty did differently or what he altered, so there’s no way to prevent him from acting directly without possibly making things even worse. But if Trevor never builds the apparatus in the first place, then he can’t use it, do you see?”
John laced their fingers together and rocked slowly, just barely moving inside him. The sensation was not entirely comfortable, the drag a half step below a burn even with all the lube John had used, but Sherlock breathed in and out and concentrated on the feeling of John’s hands holding his and after a bit his body began to relax.
“Well, I was thinking seriously about giving it up. I mean, as I said, I don’t work all that much anyway, and now that we’re together in pretty much every sense…and you’ve made it clear that you’d prefer to have me at your beck and call, so…what do you think?”
“I knew you’d had a sister,” Sherlock said. His voice was slurry and a little hoarse; he’d been intubated for three days after he bled out the second time.
“Yeah, but…” John realized that this line of conversation was going to take them into dangerously choppy waters. “Do you
“Well, nobody’s perfect,” John said kindly, which made Sherlock huff up like an angry cat. “But it sounds like it could work. You could set up as an actual criminal mastermind; you’ve got a real knack for this.”
” Sherlock breathed rapturously. He reached into the box and pulled out the topmost object, a small Bible of the sort handed out by earnest church ladies. John stared. “Oh, yes. Is there a letter?”
Harmon nodded heavily. “I told him we was fine. Kelly would have taken care of that girl; she wouldn’t have talked. But he insisted. Offered a lot of money.”
Sherlock made his plans. At the needlework store he bought the class kit (he had high hopes for his own scissors, but they proved a disappointment: the ends curved so that he could not put out someone’s eye, or open a vein) along with extra practice cloth and a rainbow of silks. Then he bought a pile of handkerchiefs.
“Shut up and drive slowly, we haven’t much time,” Sherlock aid impatiently. “I’m not going to turn you in. I need your help. I wouldn’t have done in any case, I’m on your side, in case that isn’t obvious, and I
John was thirty-four years old. He’d been in love, more than once, and he’d fallen in love and married a woman who was brave and true and had died in front of him fighting for a cause they both believed in. He thought he had nothing more to learn about love and nothing left to feel. He had been utterly wrong. Falling in love with Sherlock was a disaster, a catastrophe in every possible sense, but he knew he could no more tear himself away from Sherlock than he could his own arm.
Despite his seeming confidence, Sherlock spent the next few days so high-strung and twitchy that John was sorely tempted to bunk at the hospital just to get some sleep. When they arrived at the cellars on the third night to see no light on the river he immediately began pacing, hunched and frantic in the low-ceilinged room. John looked at the whites of his eyes showing and a lifetime of horse habit took over. He placed his warm palm on the back of Sherlock’s neck and said soothingly, “Calm down. We’re early. Now tell me how old you think this cellar is.”
“Of a sort,” Sherlock said, sliding off the bed. “Get in quick before it gets cold. I’ve a present for you--I brought it up earlier today and hid it in the hayloft.” He had got his boots on now, and darted nimbly out the door into the loft. John moved quickly to his chest, rifled through it silently, and made it to the bed just as Sherlock returned with his arms full.
Sherlock had no idea what to do. The taste was thick and unpleasant on his tongue, and why was Rowan putting his finger into his mouth? Pure reflex made him close his mouth around it and Rowan grinned again, his usual cheeky smile, but there was the echo of something darker still lurking there.
Sherlock’s heart sank—if the Commander was planning to entertain that evening there was no chance of Sherlock meeting with him—but it seemed Mrs. Turner was supervising the replacement of the draperies, which had been taking down for cleaning. Everyone stopped to stare at him when he appeared in the doorway.
Well. He’d asked the question, and now he had more questions. Sherlock definitely knew that he wanted, even if he didn’t know exactly
“Ah,” Sherlock breathed in pleased surprise. “Of course.” They reached the door and he handed John a torch, reaching in his pocket for his lockpicks. John leaned against the wall, keeping the torch steady on the lock, letting the half-forgotten scent of grass and sweat stir the adrenaline humming in his nerve endings:
“You weren’t going to win your money back,” Sherlock said, tipping his head back to look down his nose. “You were just going to lose more.”
bored I would have done it myself, but Lestrade should work it out in no time if he does as I told him.”
“To stay here,” Sherlock repeated patiently. “You’re both completely obvious. No one is going to talk to me if you’re along.”
“—the police and prosecutors involved are not going to take kindly to having those convictions questioned.”
When the orgasm hit he couldn’t help thrusting up but Michael had his hand on him, so hopefully he didn’t go too deep.
“Yeah, back at home. I’m lucky, they were okay with me taking today for personal business cause we’ve got an extra day, as long as I make it there by tomorrow afternoon, but we play in Boston after that. So I’m leaving Sherlock in charge here.”
“Yes.” Sherlock actually looked up. “Lestrade saw your note, so he went to Speedy’s and bought a sandwich whilst I was in the shower, and then he stood over me until I ate it.”
“Heard you had a rough night,” Mike Stamford remarked when John came into the cluttered little charting room where they held signout in the A&E.
“I want there to be no doubt whatsoever about the sample,” Sherlock said, unbuttoning his right cuff. “And as I’m sure you’ve no interest in watching me urinate…”
“I’m glad…” Sherlock hesitated, looking away. “I’m glad you didn’t go with them. In the car that day, I mean.”
“I’m sure that painting will still be missing when we get back.” John drank his wine, set down the glass, and rested his elbows on the table. “Okay. Now you have to tell me about you and Nick.”
“Yes. Only children under twelve are protected from hanging. Or prison, for lesser crimes. But Father has a scheme to introduce reform schools. Boys up to sixteen will instead be sent to reform schools where they will stay until they’re eighteen, and be taught a skill.”
Sherlock carried the plate and mug into the kitchen and drank a glass of water. He knew intellectually that he was ready. He had been ready for weeks, as ready as it was possible to be, but always the fear of failure had held him back. He was still afraid, but he would no longer let it hold him back.
“He was beaten, Owen, with the buckle end of a belt. We’re taught to recognize what that looks like, and I’ve seen it before, although never this bad. This wasn’t some kind of rough sex play. This was Moran beating the crap out of him. It must have hurt like hell.” The image of the paracetamol flashed through John’s mind again and he had to stop to fight the tightness in his throat.
“Good luck with that. Sherlock doesn’t do press,” John said. “Did you lot talk about him? He’s usually more than happy to let official law enforcement take the credit.”
“I suppose I’ll have to keep riding back here,” Sherlock muttered, sliding in. “At least until we get where we’re going. Where
with his calling everybody ‘bro’ and his stupid gay jokes and he can’t even do a proper English accent! Oh my God, you should have heard him, he’s so awful!” She seemed ready to cry.
“I can protect myself and I can protect my family. I will do whatever I have to do to make sure of that.” She uncrossed her arms to lean forward. “And believe me, Sherlock, if you breathe a word of this to John, you will never hear from him again. You know I can make that happen.”
“Mate?” said the bartender behind him and John whipped around, feeling obscurely guilty. He paid and carried the drinks back to the table.
“Of course it is,” John said forcefully. He was under no illusions that his own deployment had been in the service of any aim nobler than Sherlock’s mission in the country John still thought of as Dalmatia. “You absolutely deserve to be considered for that.”
“Oh, he’s still upstairs,” Mrs. Hudson said. “He probably just didn’t hear the phone, he’s all involved in whatever it is he’s doing. One of his homeless lot came round a few hours ago with some pigeons. Pigeons!”
“Of course,” Mycroft said immediately, straightening. “Charles will see to anything you need.” And then as John turned away: “Oh, and John? I took the liberty of cancelling your appointment. Someone will be along in the morning to take care of your hair.”
John chewed a minute, thinking. It was true. There was no real reason for him to stay in the house he had shared with Mary, although the thought of leaving the site of all his memories of Em gave him a sad ache in his heart. He liked his job quite a lot, but if he planned to pick back up his old life of running around with Sherlock…did he want that, his old life back? What did he want? He had known the moment Mycroft laid out his offer what his decision would be. If going with Mary and Em meant never seeing Sherlock again, then he could not do it. The guilt over giving up Emmeline was tempered by the certainty that if he went, his and Mary’s relationship would not survive the strain; he’d be gone in a year anyway. Even the thought of Mary marrying again, of Em having a new father, had brought surprisingly little pain: Mary would choose well—someone like David, maybe, devoted and steady and a little dull. A good dad. Deep down, John knew now that he’d never really wanted to be a father. But what
Irene smiled but changed the subject smoothly. “What I can’t believe is that you went to a bunch of amateurs in San Francisco. I’m insulted! How would you feel if I came to London and asked the police to solve a case?”
Sherlock flushed hotly and looked at his drink. Had the man thought he was scanning the room for a partner? It was ridiculous for the thought to startle him. In his former life, cocaine had not been the objective of his clubgoing, at least not until things spiraled so badly out of control. It had simply facilitated what he actually wanted, which was sex.
“Oh, but that would be such a waste. Such a beautiful boy.” John was watching for it his time and sure enough, Sherlock shivered all over with pleasure. You great narcissist, John thought fondly. “So lovely, such smooth skin, such a pretty cock. It’s a sin to hide it away. Maybe after I win I’ll have you stand your watch naked. Let all the other pirates see what a prize you are, let them see that beautiful arse as you climb the rigging—not touch it though, you’ll be all mine for seven days. I could bring you back here any time I like and fuck you. Fuck that pretty mouth. Fuck that gorgeous arse.”
“Well, actually,” Sherlock started, then stopped, put his hands in his pockets, and looked away. “I’m, er. I’m not going straight home. I’ll be quiet when I come in.”
Mycroft sighed. Caring again. When would his little brother learn? “His injuries occurred during this capture, then?”
Astonishingly, it wasn’t too bad. He had to put up with Mycroft, but he wasn’t around all that much, and it was a small price to pay to be able to sleep and eat when he wanted and not have to account for his calories. Mycroft engaged a van with a lift and a strapping young man who could probably bench-press Sherlock, wheelchair and all, to get him to physio and generally haul him about. Physiotherapy continued to be torture, but John would come to meet him after and they would have lunch, and then sometimes Mark the strapping young man would drive them around to crime scenes or the Yard or Bart’s. Molly was quite taken with Mark, although she was less keen for John to climb up on a chair and point the camera over her shoulder so Sherlock could complain about her autopsy technique.
Relations between alphas and betas were officially banned—the Church held them to be one step up from bestiality—but in practice a blind eye was often turned. Secondary/beta marriages had been widespread for decades before the Restoration and in any case there were simply not enough omegas to meet alpha demand.
“We don’t need you,” Mycroft said calmly. “The documentation my people retrieved from Belfast before they destroyed the premises ties Moriarty, also known as Turner, very nicely to a long list of illegal activities. We just need him to set foot on British soil, and we can arrest him. You being there will only complicate matters. Particularly if he does suspect a trap, since in that instance I imagine he will have arranged something along the lines of a bomb himself.”  He flicked his eyes to John, who recognized his cue.
“I just thought you’d be happy for anything right now. We’ve been back over a week, I reckoned you were getting bored.”
Sherlock went back to school, leaving his CDs in a pile on a shelf. He took his Smiths poster down and crumpled it in the rubbish bin. He did keep the Discman though; Mycroft had given him a collection of violin concertos on his bitterly tense fifteenth birthday and he listened to them obsessively the rest of the year, using the earphones to block out everyone around him. That was the year he got serious about the violin. Eventually, of course, the rumor mill moved on to someone else, and Sherlock was forgotten.
Sherlock took a slow, careful breath, and realized that he was not in pain, beyond the usual dull misery of his arm and the new bruises where he had fallen. He was folded over his knees with his forehead pressed to the floor, left arm over his head. He was gripping someone’s hand. John, he thought in confusion, Arslan, but it was a small hand, a woman’s. He took another careful breath, through his nose this time. Hair oil, peppermint tea, soap, perfume…something light and citrusy, pleasant. Grapefruit. Sally Donovan.
a bar,” Mitch said. “And I can make pretty much any drink you want…or are you wanting, like, a British bar?”
“You’re right. Yes, Mirzayev’s death did destabilize the situation in Eastern Europe, although I don’t think anyone could have foreseen how expansionist Russia would become in so short a period of time. It proved critical because NATO deployed troops to Poland and Germany. There was a great deal of posturing on both sides, and whilst everyone was distracted, China declared war on Japan.”
Harry had to bury her face in her napkin again, giggling so hard she turned bright red, and fortunately at that moment a parade of waiters arrived bearing a birthday cake and singing “Happy Birthday” with credible enthusiasm.
“How do they count the seven times?” Sherlock asked, voice muffled in John’s front. “Is it total orgasms or separate sex acts?”
“She’s singing again,” Sherlock said. He sat up too. “It must be another signal, but it’s going out to everyone—“
Now properly motivated, Sherlock threw himself into recovering with ferocious intensity. He ate everything that was put in front of him, even the broth--although John suspected him of tipping most of it into his chamber pot--took the bitterest medicine without complaint, and submitted to having his back pounded to loosen the mucus. He still had black days when his slow progress made him withdrawn and brooding, but for the most part these spells were brief. John was deeply grateful for the newspapers and Irene’s letters, which kept Sherlock happily engrossed for hours on end.
Harmon regarded Sherlock, eyes narrowed. “So he’s running for Congress. So what? He’s not after my vote.”
Mrs. Leighton smiled sadly. “I know what the drug screen showed, Dr. Watson. I’m not naïve, and I’m not in denial. I know she wasn’t using cocaine before that night because she didn’t have the money. She’d lost her waitressing job a few weeks back and she was cutting every corner she could just to stay afloat. We talked about it all the time, I so wanted to help more, but my husband was made redundant last year, and it’s been hard at home too. She’d even switched to cheap coffee, and Mandy loved her coffee.”
Feeling sick and heavy with grief and fear, John led Shovel into the stables and was surprised to find Ned and Davy whispering in the tack room.
“Don’t know,” the girl said. He face remained blank, but Sherlock saw something flicker in her dark eyes: she didn’t like admitting she didn’t know.
“The river’s not frozen,” he said, sounding curious even whilst panting. “Look, John, I think I can see the hatch from here!” He coughed, coughed again, and reached to unlatch the window.
But Sherlock didn’t answer; he was already asleep, his face completely peaceful for the first time in days.
“An excellent question, and one which she has so far refused to answer. In fact she will say nothing except that she wishes to speak to you. The problem, however, is that she is not Victoria Trevor.”
” Sherlock breathed and then they were kissing. Oh, yes, this was loads better than kissing girls. Why on earth hadn’t he thought to try this before writing the whole thing off? Philippe’s tongue in his mouth did not feel like a distasteful invasion but like something delicious, like butter and honey, like….Sherlock rather gave up on coherent thought at that point.
“I’m going to call Judge Harris’ clerk and give them a heads up,” Ryan said, standing and pulling out her phone. She paced out to the hallway. Sherlock sympathized; he felt rather like pacing himself.
Lady Smallwood gave him liberty of the house, but Sherlock returned to the privacy of the thick-walled room upstairs. He had planned to read the rest of the book, but found himself staring out the window, brooding. He was no longer really angry at Lady Smallwood; he’d been around that particular brand of pigheaded pragmatism all his life. Mrs. Hudson, on the other hand…he’d thought of her as an ally, and it would be a while before he forgave her. Dr. Sawyer as well.  He could not bear to think of John, but of course his thoughts kept straying to Mrs. Hudson saying
—oh, he’d missed Christmas whilst in the monastery; hopefully Mycroft had given them a suitable gift from him) and then Mycroft’s. Mycroft congratulated him on his success in Tibet and informed him he was now going to Laos. Lovely. Finally, slowly, Sherlock opened the message from John.
“Sherlock Holmes, of course, and John Watson. It happened in Switzerland. Sherlock was shot—we’re told it’s not life-threatening, but Mycroft’s on his way now.”
Sherlock had not really made a conscious decision to run. It felt more as though there were no decision to make. He had known as soon as he knew the truth that he would escape or he would die, because the alternative was unthinkable.
John’s face lit with an astonished joy that made absolutely no sense to Sherlock. “Oh my God. You’re talking!” He actually laughed in amazement, though his eyes were filling with tears; had anyone ever been so delighted for Sherlock to talk? His hand tightened on Sherlock’s. “I’m here with you, of course. Where I should have been all along. I never, ever should have left you, Sherlock, I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry…” The tears spilled onto his cheeks and he wiped at them with his free hand.
“After Matron looks you over,” Alfred said, coming back in with an armful of blue and brown clothing. “And she’s right on my heels, so cover your bits.”
“I knew you were all right!” Sherlock said joyfully. “John thought you’d been arrested—oh, hush John, it was ridiculously obvious, you’re a terrible liar. Did you go to Munich?”
Sherlock slipped back in to the back room. Molly was sitting at the desk again, but she looked merely bored and anxious, not numbed with terror as she had before.
This proved more taxing than John had realized, and now he understood why Molly always seemed to be the first one at the hospital every morning. Fortunately Sherlock insisted that he was now capable of taking his afternoon walk unassisted, which John thought really meant unsupervised, but how much trouble could he get up to in a hospital overrun with patients and staff? And he still seemed to be recovering nicely, so John decided not to worry about him. At least until the morning when he came in and found Sherlock fast asleep.
As soon as Sherlock padded into the kitchen, hair damp and in fresh pyjamas, his eyes snapped to John, then flitted around the flat: half-empty boxes, stacks of unfiled papers, headphones on the bison skull. Without a word, he moved to a pile of boxes by the sofa and opened the top one, removing handful after handful of (probably stolen) police files.
The hand slid from Sherlock’s elbow, traced down his arm, and tucked itself into Sherlock’s own gloved hand for a brief second. A squeeze, then it fell away.
(Will update this with a link for the artwork to be reblogged once Khorazir has it posted. PLEASE check back or go follow!)
He took John’s hand again and slowly brought it to his lips, meeting John’s gaze with heat in his eyes as he dragged his open mouth over the back of John’s hand. John’s breath hitched, grew faster, and he wrapped his fingers tighter around Sherlock’s… just as Angelo arrived with their appetizer. He let out a shuddering breath and nodded his thanks as Angelo set their appetizer between them, and Sherlock immediately dug in. His appetite had been alternately non-existent and ravenous, and tonight was a ravenous night.
John dropped his bag and wrapped his arms around Sherlock, burying his face into Sherlock’s scarf, and Sherlock’s beating heart cracked right open. He breathed in, and with it came the story of an afternoon, of crowded trains and fresh bread with dinner, of Harry’s messy flat and Tesco-brand shampoo, of John, of
“Afghanistan or Iraq?” his mouth asked as the rest of him spun uselessly, seeking traction, failing utterly.
John indicated the highest cabinet in the kitchen with raised eyebrows, obviously proud of his own genius, which Sherlock acknowledged with a quirk of his mouth.
“No, don’t worry, John, I think this’ll be short, don’t you think? Let’s jump straight to the point. We both know you only married me for one reason.”
John leapt to his feet as if burned and stood there for a moment, stunned, his hands limp at his sides.
Sherlock pulled the waistband of John’s boxer briefs down and licked the bead of moisture from the tip of John’s cock with one quick flick of his tongue. A ragged moan tore from their throats in unison, and Sherlock dove back for more, the burst of John’s taste on his tongue a new and deadly addiction. He tongued at John’s bollocks, dragged a firm stripe up the underside of his cock, then plunged down to take the whole thing, pressing his nose into John’s groin to absorb his scent. Sherlock swallowed once around the head of John’s cock, the pulled back with an achingly slow drag, and set the pace with long pulls and leisurely traces over the slit, under the head, every spot that made John gasp and clutch the sheets.

Defense mechanism. John's expression softened. "I wasn't sure if you were gay or just... not into anyone. Anything."
With slow, measured movements, Sherlock took the bottle of scotch from the side table and replaced the stopper. John, without a word, handed his full glass over, too. The ice cubes clinked against the the glass walls, mostly melted, and condensation ran cold down Sherlock’s wrist as he carried both the glass and the bottle to the kitchen. The bottle went on a high shelf far out of John’s reach, in among the pots and crockery they rarely used. He moved to the sink to empty the glass… then paused.

With a quizzical look, Sherlock reached into the bag and removed the gloves, stitched from supple black leather and more expensive than anything so small had a right to be. They were lined with the softest material John had ever touched, and they had tiny metallic threads sewn into the fingertips so Sherlock could still use a touchscreen without removing the gloves. Practical for someone who

? The whole experiment would be pointless, though, if he didn’t push himself beyond his normal bounds of expression.
Sherlock hummed against John’s lips, sinking into the feel of John’s mouth until his own ridiculous grin broke the kiss. “I love you, John.”
Their breathing slowed, but Sherlock only melted into him further, nuzzling, caressing. When John finally let his fingers slip free, Sherlock made a small noise of displeasure and squeezed him even tighter.
I don't have any children and I work mostly with teenagers in my day job, so uh... thanks google? Hopefully there's nothing wildly wrong here.
Sherlock flopped into his armchair, drew his knees up to his chest and pressed his forehead against them. After a long, silent moment, his muffled voice drifted from the hollow space between.
Sherlock's lip twitched with a suppressed laugh, and John cut him a quick look over the wreckage of dinner sprawled across Mrs. Hudson's dining table.
I was so obviously taken with him right from the start and it’s quite funny, in hindsight. My first impressions were correct in some respects. Sherlock is absolutely rude and arrogant, though he no longer looks twelve years old anymore, and he clearly has the posh boy public school thing going, though he also wallows on the couch in his dressing gown for days and refuses to wash a dish. But above all he is absolutely likeable and charming, fascinating, a bit of a mystery. My madman. My Sherlock Holmes.
“Now, John, now, please,” Sherlock begged. “I use toys, I know when I’m ready, I won’t break, just please, please—“
And now that I’ve said all that, I also feel like even more of a spectacular arse for leaving you hanging after you wrote me your letter about Irene and Victor and all that, because I haven’t even finished this letter yet and I’m already going out of my mind waiting for your reaction. Which I’m sure will be… well, no, actually, I have no idea. I don’t know if you already suspected, or knew. I don’t know if you’ll even care. But this was a really huge thing for me. This was the source of all my anger, all my self-hatred, my messed up marriage and history with girlfriends and… and more than that, too. This was almost all of it.
"You know what I like," Sherlock said, then cringed as Jenkins yelled "I bet he does!" to great uproarious laughter. John flushed and laughed with the others, then dropped a kiss to Sherlock's forehead without thinking.
I hope you will forgive me for not addressing any of the content of your last letter here, but I have a particular matter I absolutely must discuss. I’m sorry I couldn’t simply say this yesterday when that damnable text alert went off again at home, but thankfully we have this new way of communicating that is a bit less immediate. I think it might give me the space to say what I’m trying to say.
“How did you identify him, though?” Lestrade asked. “Your last text made no sense; something about an ink splatter?”
"You know that once the pieces start to fall together I can't stop it. I didn't mean to cause you pain." His Adam's apple bobbed, and his eyes darted back and forth, as if physically looking for the right words.
a love language because he thinks the whole things is bollocks," John grumbled bitterly, and Mrs. Hudson fixed him with a frightful glare.
Thanks, everyone, for your overwhelming response to the writeup of the Culverton Smith case. It was a nasty one, and we’re still recovering in some ways. I left out a lot of the truly horrible parts. That case will be with us for a long time, to be sure.
"I'll be ready by half seven," Sherlock said, and promptly flopped down on the couch in his thinking pose, his fingers steepled under his chin.
“No. Unless you’re going to say a kiss, a card that includes the words ‘I’m in love with you’, or you’re planning to put a bow on your own head, John doesn’t want it, and
John brought his hands up to Sherlock’s hips and brushed their noses together. “You can pour out the rest of the bottle. I won’t be needing it.”
“Sherlock, there’s a card here from your parents,” John called out, shuffling through the day’s mail as he came up from Mrs. Hudson’s flat.
There are so many horrible… truly ugly things inside of me. I’m trying to process it all. But after…
” Sherlock snapped, and John sighed both internally and externally. He pushed back from the table and stood, ending up toe-to-toe with Sherlock, the camel hovering behind.
Next box: awards, certificates, trophies John had never seen. Where had they been hidden? Fencing, boxing, academic awards, two framed degrees from Cambridge. A whole other piece of Sherlock that John had never been privileged to know.

“Because it’s what you want!” Sherlock half-shouted. He rolled to a sitting position on the edge of the bed and propped his elbows on his knees, hunching over to wrap his hands around the back of his head. His voice, when it came again, was muffled in his chest. “It’s what you’ve always wanted. Wife, kids, suburbs, normal life,
“I’m sure, John. I promise. To be honest…” He cleared his throat and dropped his gaze, a faint blush tinging his cheeks. “When you were staying here after I got shot, and I was reading all those books, I—”
"Just thirty seconds, Sherlock. Stay there." And up the stairs he went, snatching the small bag from the back of his sock drawer and thundering back down a moment later.
John lined the mugs up perfectly straight on their shelf, plugged in the kettle, and left the flat with a messy combination of relief and unease. Leaving Sherlock alone, even for a few minutes, set John’s heart racing—
He thought about giving it over breakfast, but then if it went poorly he'd have to endure the awkwardness all day.
Sherlock stood and removed his goggles, avoiding John's eyes now that he didn't have the filter of plastic between them. He watched his own fingers where they rested on the goggles, tapping against their clear facing.
“Because I’m in love with Sherlock, and I always have been, and I was too much of a coward to do anything about it before he left. But you can be damn certain I’m not letting the chance slip away this time.”
“John Watson, Iain MacKelpie,” he said, gesturing from one to the other in introduction. “War photographer and photojournalist. In Afghanistan and the surrounding region for the last ten years, with occasional forays elsewhere. Promiscuous. Functioning alcoholic. Bit of an arse.”
“Of course!” John sounded almost offended, and his eyebrows echoed the sentiment in their tense furrow. “I… of
Sherlock, will you take John to be your lawful wedded husband, to be loving, faithful and loyal to him for the rest of your life together?
Chapter three of four for today. Make sure you didn't miss the others! One more very short one coming later.
And that did it. A surge of pleasure, a crash, an electric rush, his own come mixing with Sherlock’s in his hand. Sherlock collapsed against him, his mouth seeking John’s immediately and swallowing down every groan, giving his own pleased hum in return.
Sherlock couldn't help it. His mouth twisted into a smile without his permission, though he fought it as best he could, feeling his cheeks grow warmer still. Iain’s grin widened at the blush and advanced another step, right into Sherlock’s space.
Mrs. Hudson bustled forward, never one to be cowed by Sherlock’s moods. “Not at all, dear, just the first to arrive.” She took the Tesco’s bag from him and peeked inside, then patted him on the cheek. “Molly will be here, never you worry, Inspector. Have you met the Holmes’ yet?”
Sherlock and John have chosen to exchange rings as a symbol of the vows they have made here today. The Best Man, Mr. Greg Lestrade, will present the rings.
He pitched his voice low, pressed his hand ever-so-slightly into the softness of John’s jumper, and waited for a reaction. His own heart rate spiked, and his fingers tingled with the warmth of John’s skin beneath his jumper, though he kept his breathing under perfect control—right up until John slid an arm around his waist and drew closer, pressing their bodies together along their flanks. John chuckled warmly, perfectly timed to cover the hitch in Sherlock’s breathing.
Then he sealed their mouths together, and Sherlock groaned high and desperate, every nerve in his body coming fully alive in a riot of sensation. He stumbled back until his legs hit the the desk and slid down, propping his arse on the edge and dragging John forward into the vee of his legs. John’s lips were hot and insistent against his, a firm press that came again and again, punctuated by ragged gasps that inevitably turned to inappropriate laughter instead. They pressed their foreheads together, and Sherlock lifted both hands to cup the back of John’s head, threading his fingers through gray-blonde hair.
“Are we just going to sit here in silence?” Mary sneered. “Nothing to say to the mother of your child, John?”
And it was the most natural and necessary thing in the world to drag himself to the other side of the bed, to crawl in, curl around, to lay atop the covers and hold vigil.
He turned Sherlock’s hands over in his instead, and returned light kisses over Sherlock’s fading burn scars.
John dragged Sherlock down with a hand on the back of his neck and crashed their mouths together again, his blood running so hot in his veins it burned away every trace of confusion and doubt, until all he could think about was Sherlock's body under his hands, his tongue in his mouth, his hard cock grinding into John's.
“That’s the end of it,” Pip announced finally, holding the bottle up and peering at the last few drops. “Here! Benny!”
“No, never. On his wrists and neck, at least once on his arms. I came back for my phone one day and he was going from the shower to his room; he didn’t see me. And that’s the other thing. Before, you know, we’d go about in towels, he was in his dressing gown half the time. Now he’s always completely dressed with long sleeves, so matter how warm it is.”
The man shrugged. “Just keep him quiet and you can be his grandsire for all I care,” he said. “Come along now.”
“A bully, a liar and a sneak. Aunt Wilkes was blind to his faults of course, but she was very eager to make everyone aware of mine. Fortunately Father was not so unperceptive. Sebastian was packed off to boarding school as soon as he turned seven, and Father settled an allowance on Aunt Wilkes. Her rooms in London are quite small though, so they spend the summer holidays here each year.” Sherlock pulled his legs up and rested his sharp chin on his knees, looking small and unhappy. “Sebastian has only one real talent, and that is for finding out what I care about, and ruining it.”
had fallen into his lap. If he let go, John was positive Sherlock would immediately resume his frantic whirling and then possibly John would end up going for his gun. On the other hand…this was ridiculous, an utterly bizarre thing to be doing, but somehow it did not seem as bizarre as it would if John had found himself with a hand on the groin of any other male of his acquaintance. John always seemed to end up putting his hands on Sherlock in inappropriate ways: getting his phone out of his pocket, shoving food in his mouth, pulling cigarettes out of his mouth, pushing him all over the flat (into the shower, out of the shower, into bed, off of John’s laptop).  He was more like John’s child than his flatmate. They were half a step away from John putting a tissue to Sherlock’s nose and telling him to blow, John thought. So in that light, this wasn’t all that strange. (Or possibly it was stranger.)
Planted in the most isolated corner of the waiting room he could find, John took a sip of coffee and grimaced. Terrible. Why was hospital coffee always vile? It wasn’t even hot. He sighed and took another halfhearted sip, then looked at his watch. This was going to kill him. It hadn’t been five minutes; Sherlock might not even be properly under yet.
Sherlock paced along for a bit chewing on that. He still was not certain if the rising panic over the alleged terrorist threat was mere distraction or a setup for something bigger, but he believed it no more than Molly did.
“I can see why he’d scare a little kid,” McGinty said. “And looking at this record, why he’d scare the grownups too. That murder charge was his third felony; he was going away for a long time no matter what, so it made sense for Kelly Lewis to sell him out. Well, he’s at Lucasville now—that’s the maximum security prison down toward West Virginia—so we’re not getting there today. I’ll let Lauren know so she can start working on getting us in.”
John could not help smiling. “That was good,” he told Sherlock, who nestled back down, pleased with himself.
John knew what he was trying to say, and he knew in his heart that it was Sherlock’s decision to make. Sherlock might always be John’s to cherish and protect, but only because he chose to put himself in John’s hands. John looked into his hopeful face, his pure blue eyes, and really there was no choice at all. “Yes,” he whispered.
John swept his finger around until he brushed the place again and Sherlock arched his back, moaning. A flush had spread over his pale face. John watched, fascinated, as he coordinated his movements so that he stroked Sherlock’s cock in the same slow rhythm as he slid his finger over the sensitive nub he had found. John worked Sherlock slowly, wanting to draw it out, slipping a second finger in when he loosened a little. Before long, however, Sherlock was panting in time with John’s strokes, tightening, and then he gasped out, “Oh, oh, oh,” as he went rigid and clenched rhythmically, climaxing with John’s fingers buried deep inside him. John stared, mesmerized by the sight of Sherlock’s long slender body quivering under his hands. He was already half hard again just from touching Sherlock, and the sight and feel of this was almost too much. Sherlock spasmed around his fingers and John swallowed hard, thinking about how easy it would be to push Sherlock’s knees up and just sink into that hot, loosened opening...no no no no no, he thought, sliding his fingers out reluctantly and climbing off the bed to find a flannel.
The potting shed had once been a chicken coop and still had old angled windows over the bench, looking out the way they had come. Rowan maneuvered Sherlock around to the bench and turned him so he was facing out, pulling him back by the hips so that his arse was pressed against Rowan’s groin. “Oh, much better,” Rowan sighed, grinding. Sherlock, who was half aroused all the time these days anyway, immediately felt himself harden. “That wind is fucking freezing, and watching you wriggle your tail in there was driving me mental.” He slid one hand around and fondled Sherlock through his trousers. “God, you’re ready to burst. Poor baby, hasn’t anyone been taking care of you whilst I’ve been away?”
Sherlock frowned at his watch and then out the dark window, trying to work out how long he had been in the lab. He had come over Friday evening, and he remembered a few people coming and going earlier today, so…he checked his watch again. Late Saturday.  A long time, but he had worked longer without a break in the past. He had had a bump of cocaine at some point when he felt his energy flagging, but he couldn’t remember exactly when, so maybe he was still coming down. Not a lack of sleep, he’d slept Thursday night. Food? Sherlock tried to remember when he last ate. Not breakfast Friday, he’d still been sleeping, but he definitely remembered tea and toast at some point…Thursday morning? Wednesday? Sherlock brought a hand up and sniffed at his own breath. A faint whiff of acetone. Of course, that might just be on his hands from earlier, but he supposed it was just as likely to be his stupidly demanding, now-ketotic transport. Oh well, he wouldn’t mind a quick run out anyway, his back was getting stiff.
John crawled over Sherlock to his usual spot against the wall and slid in. It was deliciously warm. Sherlock even tried to put his feet down to cover John’s.
Sherlock grinned. “You’re catching on. Of course there’s an excellent chance he’ll find much more, if Moran really is doing Moriarty’s dirty work. And whilst Pitts will spend most of his time congratulating himself, he
“No, Seref is going to be released from prison and kill a man from a rival gang in a power play. Supposedly. Actually the Turkish government is going to take out the rival gang. And then Seref—you—are going to flee to Uzbekistan and try to get a job with Mirzayev, whilst the real Seref stays safely stowed safely away in prison under a different name. He’ll be released once you’ve finished there.”
The woman seemed to sense him staring at her and glanced up, still eating. “Oh, you’re awake,” she said without much interest. “First heat?”
“Er…” John screwed up his face, trying to remember. Had he a type? He supposed so: he’d always had a bit of a thing for tall slim blokes, long legs and—“I’ve just remembered! You’re going to love this. We went to the ballet one time—my cousin was in it, it was that Christmas one, with the nutcracker. Harry fell asleep. There was a male dancer who danced with the main ballerina—not the little girl, the one who has the big solo—“
For the first time the shepherd looked at him with something besides amused indifference in his eyes. “What are you offering?” There was the slightest emphasis on
John and Irene were used to this by now so John just asked Irene, “How are you faring with your...paramour?”
John wiped his fingers on the bedclothes as Sherlock turned, feeling a little illicit thrill—they were never coming back here either way. Sherlock arranged himself on his knees and elbows, head resting on his forearms. John considered and then pulled his hips back a bit farther and pushed his knees apart. Right. More salve, he thought, and carefully slicked his cock and then smeared a bit more around Sherlock’s hole for good measure. Then he knelt up and took hold of Sherlock’s hip with one hand whilst gripping his own prick with the other, and slowly pressed the head inside. Oh, it was so
After a week, the Russian doctor came and removed the stitches from his face. Sherlock sat quietly on Saidimir’s empty bed as he worked, trying to gird himself for the inevitable examination of his arm. The housekeepers stripped his bed and silently carried the sheets away as the doctor probed gently at his face. At one point Sherlock caught a whiff of stale vodka on the man’s breath and flinched away violently, but the doctor did not seem to notice.
“Oh,” Sherlock said, surprised. He looked up from where he was digging through his trunk in search of his swim things. “I’m, ah, taking a bit of a break, actually. Thought I’d go for a swim.”
Mrs. Hudson beamed at him and scurried back to the kitchen and Green Jacket said with undisguised envy, “She never gives me boxes of scones.”
The most bizarre aspect of the whole situation was the way the rest of the world just carried on, seemingly unaware that John Watson’s life had been turned completely upside down. Even Mary noticed nothing, although to be fair she was having trouble keeping the days of the week straight at that point. Most people simply attributed John’s dazed distraction to the strains of new fatherhood.
Sherlock Holmes, who had once held his tongue for weeks under torture, had never particularly thought of himself as brave or strong. He had to work hard to conceal how the thought made him glow.
Sherlock must be losing it, John thought; weren’t all psychotics deranged? Sherlock scrubbed his hands through his hair, making him look like an electrocuted dust mop, and began pacing the floor.
“You done with that?” John asked Green Jacket, who had just set aside the international section. Sometimes he liked to read about the current situation in Afghanistan just to be glad he was out of it. Green Jacket passed the paper over.
Violet’s employers lived on an estate in Hampshire called the Copper Beeches. Both of them were frequently away in London, and even when at home were often in their separate studios on the grounds (“although I don’t think Davy does anything in his but shag local girls. He’s an awful perv, tried to get in my knickers the first week”). Jessica was uptight but not difficult, and she sometimes paid Violet extra to pose for her when Jessica was trying different layouts for shots.
Or whatever else comes to mind. Those of us dressed as gentlemen will begin remonstrating with the guards to do something about the students, which will give the students time to get away, and then this lady--” he gave a slightly ironical bow to Irene, who was dressed as an ostler and had a pipe clamped between her teeth--”makes her dramatic entrance.”
Sherlock hesitated. He told himself he didn’t want to get Michael’s hopes up, but he knew perfectly well that wasn’t the reason; Sherlock had just never liked showing his hand. “I think I can get him to talk,” he said finally, as he had to McGinty. “And I think that will help us, yes. But I need to do some more research.”
Trevor tipped her head to see the label and nodded in approval and Sherlock felt his eyebrows go up: he’d never seen Trevor drink anything stronger than coffee in their Oxford days. “I’m paying though,” she said firmly. “I owe you a rather large debt of thanks.”
Mike turned red and stared into his mug. John, who had grown up in the country and lacked such sensibilities, grinned.
Sherlock turned in a circle where he stood, hands tangling in his hair. He had been so careful--and now—what was Moriarty doing, was he bored?—what would Reilly—John—
John went still and Sherlock braced himself before he was even aware of it, expecting John’s anger in the form of a fist.
“Tell us about Miss Kelly,” McGinty said. His tone was of only mild encouragement, but Sherlock could tell he’d caught the importance of her words as well.
Sherlock shot her a glare that of course Molly couldn’t see and then turned his scowl on the wall. Decorative Needlework! He considered simply refusing to go, but then he would have to find a phone and convince Mrs. Turner to have him fetched back; ancillae weren’t allowed to walk alone. And if he refused to go to subsequent classes Molly couldn’t go either, and she seemed--bizarrely—genuinely excited about cookery. He was stuck. Sherlock shot the wall a final poisonous scowl and stomped off down the corridor.
John clutched the edges of the basin, breathing deeply until the dizziness passed. “How? How do you know?”
John thought of Sherlock curled in the cave like a wounded animal, and he swallowed. “I’m not leaving you,” he said. “Not ever.”
“Yes,” he said, emptiness settling in him like a weight. He was suddenly acutely aware of how much he missed John, and not just for his praise. “Well. Maybe your friend will dedicate her book to you.”
“Rosemary Allen,” Sherlock said to John. “Worked for a pharmaceutical company, retired some years ago. Mycroft checked tax records and she lives in a cottage near the sea now—not in Brighton any longer. Guess what she was working on.”
“Go ahead and put it on speaker, you’re going to need both hands,” John ordered and was gratified to hear Sherlock’s quick intake of breath.  He prudently put his own phone on speaker and shoved off his trousers and pants, grabbing the as-yet-unused bottle of lube he’d retrieved from his overnight case and flipping open the lid. “Are you touching yourself again?”
“—be a minute,” John finished, turning his smile on Sherlock with a gleam of teeth that made the expression much more like a snarl. “Right behind you.”
John did not think he was talking about John’s fingers, still stretching Sherlock’s previously untouched entrance wide open.  He could see Sherlock’s closed eyelids trembling. “We don’t have to go further. I can touch you whilst I do this, I’ll make you feel so good—“
Too late. John thought they had managed to slide out the door unobserved, but they had gotten only a short distance away before four of their fellow players stepped out in front of them.
“But such a tasty mouthful,” Sherlock said. He had scrambled up the tree like a cat, gathering more plums from the high branches, and now he spat a pit too. “Oh, look at that, mine reached the river.”
Moran held him up for a moment and then pulled out and away, stepping into the kitchen as Sherlock folded to the floor and tried to catch his breath. It was a few minutes before his hands were steady enough to reach for his clothes.
Sherlock buried the pajamas in the bottom of his hamper and took a long hot shower, scrubbing himself until the scent of the soap banished the last lingering aroma of sex in his nostrils. Drying off he caught a glimpse of something in the mirror and turned to see, craning his neck to look at the back of his upper arm. Red marks darkening to bruises. John had left fingerprints on his skin, after all.
knackered, but the truth is I’ve just learnt that Sherlock’s been in love with me all this time and might have given up his life for me and I don’t know what to do about it and I’m scared shitless I’ll never see him again? …No.
John twisted his fingers again and slid in a third. Sherlock groaned and arched his back, legs slipping around John’s waist, and pulled his thighs up and back. “Dancers are very flexible,” he said breathlessly. “Care to see?”
Sherlock, of course, had a very good idea of who the snitch was. He’d searched Saidimir’s side of the room whilst Saidimir was on guardhouse duty, and had found a really startling amount of cash as well as some letters from Natasha that made even Sherlock, with his limited Uzbek, blush.  You didn’t need to be Sherlock Holmes to put this together, except apparently you did, because no one else seemed to suspect.
Sherlock did not dare look at John, who was probably barely keeping a straight face. He halted abruptly in front of the three girls, flicking his eyes over them in assessment.  All were styled, straightened, adorned and attired in an interchangeably expensive manner that he supposed represented the height of upscale adolescent fashion; all were ignoring him in favor of their phones. This would not do. He whipped to the tallest girl, hoping he had chosen the one he wanted. “Where are the stolen jewels?” he demanded.
“Oh, that’s just the beginning. He got epinephrine and the reaction started settling down, but he was already under arrest at that point so he was handcuffed to a bed…”
The woman professionally known as Agra, who was currently travelling with a passport in the name of Margaret Leeds, paused in the aisle of the plane. “Is it just you on your own?” she asked the skinny girl staring moodily out the window. “I mean, is your mum in a different row someplace? I could switch if you like.”
“Okay.” John dropped the shirt on the grass and stretched out next to Sherlock, propping himself on his own elbow. “So tell me this fantasy.”
and a coffee since I didn’t get my cocaine. I’m getting some for you lot too. Do we go back to the station now?”
When Sherlock woke again he needed to piss. He slid carefully out from under John’s arm—they’d been up very late, and by the clock in his head they’d really only slept a few hours. John needed to rest.
“There’s a girl, not someone he’s already seeing or he wouldn’t be so anxious, they just met. He already had plans to meet his friends, but she probably told him to ring when he finished if it wasn’t too late. Right? You’ve been looking at your watch for the last hour. Now Sebastian’s leaving, you won’t be breaking up the party, so you’re going to call her.”
“Linda Stafford used to be a customer service representative in a division of special marketing called ‘New Families’,” Sherlock said softly. “There was a number to call if parents had questions about what type of pushchair to buy or how to install a car seat. She worked with Wayne Ellis for years. He must have thought of her immediately when he realized the baby was viable.”
John had stopped listening. How had he forgotten? This was Twelfth Night, January the sixth, the Feast of the Epiphany, Sherlock’s birthday. “Ah, I need to--I need to check something,” he muttered and escaped, hurrying through the halls to the limited privacy of the stairwell.
John blinked awake. It seemed to be morning, but the cloudy light was so diffuse that it was hard to be sure. He was lying on the sofa with a terrific crick in his neck.
But it appeared Sherlock had something different in mind this time as well. When they’d reached the point that John was beginning to gasp and clutch at Sherlock’s hair, Sherlock suddenly pulled off in a slow, wet, cruelly tantalizing slide.
In that unguarded moment of happiness the memory finally slipped past the barriers he’d erected. John. John’s hands holding his face, John’s lips stopping his heart. The longing that swept over him was nothing like the craving for drugs: the intensity of it drowned him, he could not breathe under its weight.
Sherlock’s eyes were hidden behind his sunglasses, but John had the satisfaction of seeing his mouth open in surprise. “Well, you had to know I’d find you, didn’t you?” John went on conversationally. “You might know crime, Sherlock, but I know you. I even know why you’re here.”
, and then the door to the staircase opened and Sally Donovan stepped neatly forward and punched Willfen right in the face. He dropped like a stone.
Angelo’s eyes narrowed, and for a moment he looked every inch the fearsome criminal he had been. “How the devil can you know that,” he growled.
“Only in fantasy; don’t get your hopes up,” Sherlock drawled. A minute later he said, far less lazily, “But you do, don’t you.”
Rowan’s laugh sounded nothing like it usually did. There was no booming warmth; it was a cruel, gloating sound. “Did you enjoy that, Mike? Bet you listened to every minute, didn’t you? I’ll wager it’s the closest you’ve ever gotten to having someone yourself. Did you go back to your room and—“
“How do you know--” John began, and then as if on cue he heard hoofbeats behind them. A lot of hoofbeats, and moving fast. “Bloody
Sherlock woke whimpering. He was aching and empty, already rock hard and sheeting moisture down his thighs, pinned down by John’s weight. Before he could even try to move John grunted and rolled on top of him. He pushed into Sherlock without even opening his eyes, and Sherlock moaned, shuddering all over at that first rush of pleasure. John’s eyes flew open. “Oh,” he said. “Oh, fuck, you—“ and then he thrust again and all words fled for both of them.
John sipped gratefully at the hot coffee. “This is brilliant. Thank you. I’ll never let Sherlock say a word against you again.”
That would be a no, then. At the restaurant, John had just gathered up his bag and iced coffees when his text alert chirped. John transferred everything to his right hand, precariously, and pulled out his phone to check the text, which turned out to be from Dimmock. John had just read
“No,” Sherlock said without looking at him. Initially Phillips had seemed to think he should assist Sherlock in divesting himself of his robes and donning his pyjamas, but Sherlock had shut that down immediately: enough people touched him as it was.
Reynolds’ house proved to be set well off a back road, at the end of a private drive. It was a long, low structure with a view of the cliffs and sea stretching behind it. Sherlock parked, collected his ugly sculpture, and arranged his face into his brightest smile, but annoyingly no one answered the bell.
Sherlock sat up a little, lighting up a bit as he always did when he had the chance to explain something clever. “Mycroft and I were setting up an organized crime ring out of Norway. The head of it was like Moriarty—a shadow, a man no one ever saw. It’s useful enough if you want to avoid taking the fall, but even more so if he doesn’t actually exist. The idea was that after attracting enough notoriety we would begin cutting in on Moriarty’s territory and draw him out that way, but he moved too quickly. The only silver lining to this situation is the chaos it’s going to have created in Moriarty’s organization, and that creates an opportunity for the Norwegian to move in, take over, and destroy Moriarty’s organization from the inside out.”
So when Sherlock walked into the pool, hands clasped behind his back to conceal their shaking, and saw John wearing the parka, he was quite honestly shocked.
“Sounds like we’re good then,” Roz said, trying to stand up without shoving her chair into John’s knee. “Let’s go collect Sherlock.”
She took a breath and he thought she meant to hiss venom back at him, but she didn’t. She just breathed, jagged and irregular, somewhere between panic and despair.
Mycroft had sent a thick file of questionable insurance payouts late Friday afternoon, and Sherlock worked steadily through the weekend. In spite of his good intentions he didn’t remember to eat until Saturday night. Standing in the kitchen, gloomily dumping beans out of a tin, he realized to his horror that he missed Hobbes: her midafternoon arrival had lent structure to the day, even though her humming drove him mad whenever she was there. At least she didn’t hum whilst she was working. Or eating. Sherlock had never felt lonely eating alone in his younger days, although that was probably because he hadn’t even realized how profoundly lonely he was back then; it was just his baseline state. But since coming back from the dead all his meals seemed to be like this one, eaten standing up or on the run. It had made a change having Hobbes there, the two of them eating in companionable silence at the desk, their books propped against each other.
"In fact," Sherlock said, "this is the perfect opportunity for me to observe you in in a different social group from what I normally see. I'm sure to make all kinds of interesting observations. I'll need to tidy my mind palace before we go. When is the event?"
Sherlock’s cries rose swiftly in pitch at John’s words, and his motions sped, taking ever so slightly more of John’s cock.
[JW blinks hard a few times, his lips pressed together, and lays a hand at the small of SH’s back to guide him to a stop in front of the door to 221 Baker Street. JW lets his hand fall away and takes a deep breath]
The plane soared overhead, and when it reached its nearest point, Sherlock fixed his eyes on its vast gray belly and sent everything inside of him up in a stream of steady light.
The start of today’s session was… unusual. I was unable to avoid giving Sherlock and John back to back appointments this week, and the result provided quite a jumping off point for our discussion today. John and Sherlock encountered each other in the waiting room just outside my office in between appointments, and John had brought his daughter with him, as he’d been unable to call upon his usual minders. As soon as she saw Sherlock, Rosamund squealed and reached out for him, and Sherlock took her into his arms without hesitation, obviously pleased to see her. Sherlock offered to mind her in the waiting room while John came in for his appointment, which he accepted. He handed over her bag and left them with some reluctance, though as it turns out, the reluctance had nothing to do with leaving his daughter in Sherlock’s care.
But he was Sherlock Holmes, and his partner in domestic semi-bliss was ex-army doctor John Watson. They could only stay in and bake cookies for so long.
When John drew back again, he let the hand in Sherlock’s hair trace down his jawline, cup his cheek.
“I don’t want to go home with her, Sherlock,” John said, taken aback. He wasn’t sure what he’d expected, but the sheer venom in Sherlock’s voice was more than he’d heard in a long time.
Withdrawal symptoms have been absent for a full two weeks now with no relapse. Sherlock reports better sleeping and eating habits over the past four days since completing his not-assignments. I hope to see him continue in this new direction and will consider removing these indicators after one month of healthy eating and sleeping.
Sherlock's love language? If he were to want to receive love, how would he want it? How would he hear it? It apparently wasn't acts of service, as John had tried that plenty. But that still left four options.
John mustered a nervous smile once the server left. “They have beehives on the roof here. The sous chef who maintains the hives said he’ll give us a private tour, if you want. He’s a fan.”
Sherlock turned. Hesitated. Walked back a few paces, his mouth doing that thing, the thing John hadn’t seen since the tarmac.
The hand around Sherlock’s tightened, and his heart ached, beat hard, sent a pulse of fire through his veins to pool low in his stomach. He felt like a live wire, like a gas main waiting for a spark, and John—
Ten years after his first boyfriend left him, John Watson kissed the love of his life in the middle of a busy London street.
The breath caught in Sherlock’s throat, and he clattered to a halt, this thumbs hovering over the keys. The icy air bit at his cheeks, burned them a rosy pink. Finally, he replied.
Sherlock was silent for a long moment. John's brilliant plan began to crumble before his eyes. Too transparent, so obviously fishing, and he'd just revealed everything he'd always held so close for this exact reason—
Harry, I’m so sorry for emailing you like that. I just woke up from a nap and I'm sobering up right now. And I’m not touching that shit again. I poured the rest of the bottle out, I put my goal in writing, and I’m going to work on the exercises my therapist gave me as soon as I get in contact with Sherlock. He confided in me and I’ve been out of touch all day and if it were me…
Sherlock stopped in his tracks right in the middle of the crowd, enveloped by the pack of revelers all swallowed in their coats and scarves, huddled against the increasingly chilled wind. His head was bent over his phone, his mouth pressed into an unhappy line, while his parents walked on without him. They made it halfway across the square before they realized that Sherlock was no longer with them, then doubled back. Sherlock didn’t look up as they approached.
When I startled him out of one of these dazes for the third time, he apologized and admitted to being preoccupied with Sherlock’s latest letter. Finally having confirmation that Sherlock is gay and has had a relationship in the past shook John to the point of a drinking binge, though not out of any homophobic discomfort. He
[He pulls SH into a back-slapping hug. SH hesitantly raises one hand to lightly pat at GL’s shoulder]
Sherlock choked on his sip of wine at the implication, and John had to quietly admire Mummy’s gall. It was only the first shot of her volley, however.
drank some. But only a single lip print, not several overlayed, barely there—just the one sip, then. Good.
“Mary finally agreed to the paternity test. These are the results. Mycroft brought them to me at work.”
One second Sherlock was pressed up against John’s leg, and the next he was on his knees between them, dragging his mouth slowly up John’s inseam with his eyes fixed on John’s. John gasped, squirming involuntarily as Sherlock continued his slow slide upward, barely ghosting over John’s fast-hardening cock, until his mouth hovered inches away from John’s. John wrapped a hand around the nape of Sherlock’s neck and tugged lightly at the curls there, his other hand at the dip of Sherlock’s waist.
Sherlock nodded. He’d already read the story of the Smallwood’s marriage: at church, in the house, in Lady Smallwood herself, in a thousand tiny details.
clever, Mr. Holmes! Do you think it’s significant? Maybe my building is on top of an old graveyard, and it was built on Wednesdays?”
For a month or so nothing came of it. Sherlock worked a few private cases of the sort he could practically sort without leaving the flat. John made risotto. Sherlock made brioche. There was a long experiment involving air pressure and balloons, which caused loud and startling
Eventually John gentled the kisses, relaxing his grip to let Sherlock’s head relax back just a little. Sherlock sighed and turned his face to nuzzle into John’s palm.
Sherlock’s eyes flicked to John, a pale flash of surprise, and then away. He sighed. “I’d been there before,” he said slowly. “Years ago. The name’s changed, so I didn’t realize until we arrived.”
Even if John had felt like discussing his worries, he couldn’t: there was no one who knew but the three of them, and John certainly couldn’t imagine pouring out his heart to Mycroft. Occasionally, however, he caught a glimpse of Mycroft’s unguarded face when he looked at Sherlock—a quick shadow in those bland eyes—and found the fact that Mycroft too was anxious simultaneously reassuring and unnerving.
“Not too long, mind, we’ve the other horses to bring in, and now Young Tom off.” Mr. Gregson sighed. “What a day, and so hot too.”
Rowan pulled his finger out, leaving the bitter slime in Sherlock’s mouth, and ran his thumb over Sherlock’s bottom lip. “Next time I’ll teach you to suck my cock,” he said softly.
Ryan didn’t even blink; she must have assumed Rodriguez had mentioned a baby. “Yeah, it is. I came back for this case, actually; I was supposed to be on maternity leave another month.”
Sherlock blinked and looked around, realizing too late that he’d been standing there staring into space for several minutes and hadn’t tidied a thing.
Mycroft nodded. He sat back in his chair a little. “When we learned that you and Sherlock had left Sherrinford together, I immediately sent men north in case you decided to return to your home. When they reported that the village was too small for them to remain without attracting attention, I had a charitable foundation establish a dame school in the area and installed a young lady, Miss Clara Hunter, to be the teacher and to keep an eye on your family. I am very sorry to tell you, John, but your mother died last fall. Miss Hunter assures me she had all available care and was in no discomfort.”
“Last I heard the road was free to all,” the man in the center said. He had a thin, feral face, ill shaven and unpleasant, but he was no farmer or laborer; his horse and gear were too good. “Or are the aristocrats claiming that too now?”
Sherlock made an affronted squawk and John rolled him over and got his mouth on his nipple, and that was the end of the talking.
The rain had slackened off again and John spotted the stone wall first. “Is that it?” Sherlock slowed and John leaned forward, squinting as the headlights picked out the sign. “Blackstone Lodge. Brilliant, another gravel road.”
“Oh, and you’re going to be godfather, obviously,” John added. “Did I tell you before? So you’ll practically be the star. No need to steal the show like you did at our wedding.”
When the car arrived to collect Henry Molly hugged him as best she could and even Sherlock—who loathed both social niceties and physical contact—shook his hand. “Good luck,” Molly said, a slight tremble in her overly-bright voice.
“Well, I wouldn’t have much of a chance ordinarily, but the field’s rather narrow—they’re giving preference to veterans, and the person who brought this to my attention had already made inquiries and been told that field work for the intelligence service would be considered acceptable.” Sherlock was fidgeting a bit now, not meeting John’s eye.
John beamed at him, surprised and pleased. “That would be lovely. I’d really like that. In the spring, when you’re fully recovered and they’re nesting.”
Sherlock turned away from the board, keeping his eyes closed as though that would somehow make the announcement disappear, and ducked into the toilet. He pulled the bag out with shaking fingers and didn’t even bother to measure out the drug, just sniffed and sniffed until his nose was running and his eyes were watering and the lights had brightened as though by magic and his mind was completely, wonderfully clear, because at last he knew what he had to do.
John sat at the desk for a long moment, fists clenched, staring into space. He wanted very badly to hit something. He wanted to rage, vomit, weep, tear off the black uniform, and kill the Commander with his bare hands. He wanted to scrub his mind clean of what he had seen.
John did not need to be told twice. He leaned against the door and closed his eyes, lulled by the soothing hum of the engine and the growing patter of raindrops on the windshield, and fell into a light doze.
Sherlock mastered his new instruments and began to write in earnest. The peregrine babies grew feathers, got bigger, and were hunting on their own in a shorter time than John would have believed possible.  In London, Zombie Mum’s baby also grew bigger (more slowly, in the way of humans) and began to take an interest in his surroundings. This horrified Nose Ring, who promptly moved seats and now glared at John and Green Jacket every morning as they exchanged their brief pleasantries. On the dales, the days grew longer and warmer and John acknowledged to Simon, reluctantly, that the country was not so bad after all.
Ned and Davy both apologized with genuine sincerity when he returned to the barn, and John stayed to finish the cleaning with them. There was still a little residual awkwardness, but that would pass. Still John was glad to finally escape on Hermes, pounding over the fields feeling the fresh spring sun and the biting air scouring him clean.
John sighed and considered his options. He could go back to the flat, but it would probably be empty; Sherlock had likely stormed off to who knows where—Moran’s, possibly. John had mixed feelings about that. If getting tied up and his arse smacked would settle Sherlock down after that debacle, John didn’t have the heart to grudge it to him, no matter how bitter and jealous he might feel. Of course, it was always possible Sherlock
He held up his other hand, the one not clutching the pager, and Sherlock saw a cigarette clenched in his trembling fingers.  It occurred to him in the same almost subconscious way that he had registered that Ian Braithewaite had not actually stayed obese, that he (ironically) now liked swimming quite a lot, that he had two children and a cat and loved his wife very much and liked his job well enough and took a salad for lunch every day but often sneaked off to the vending machines around four in the afternoon, that Ian had never smoked before.
. “I was wondering if it could be related to my Axis II diagnosis.” One upside to this admission: that detested PDD had been discarded in favor of Asperger’s syndrome, which Sherlock found much more to his liking.
“Sherlock has not accomplished his mission, so I have no ability to attempt an extraction even if it would not increase his danger tenfold along with jeopardizing everything we have worked to accomplish.”
,” Sherlock said, giving the word his usual disdainful emphasis, “we might as well take advantage of it. Have him send a doctor round tomorrow…” John’s face must have revealed something, for he snapped, “Oh, don’t be an idiot. I would prefer never to be touched by anyone but you for the rest of my life, if possible.”
If you don’t believe me feel free to take my DNA. It’s not going to match what’s on her trouser leg.”
The bartender considered this. “I don’t know about that, but he stole my girlfriend and she had too much bourbon yesterday and told everyone his dick was bigger than mine.”
Sherlock had rung John before he left but had got his voice mail, so he’d left a message telling John he was setting off on an adventure and would be in touch and, in a flash of inspiration, would send postcards to Rosie. He’d already posted one from Chicago showing the shiny bean. Sherlock had no intention of spelling out exactly what he was up to, so hopefully John would too distracted by pictures of the OK Corral to wonder what Sherlock was doing.  Wait, where
Hobbes not Donovan; either half siblings or—no, Donovan had implied the girl’s parents hadn’t married. “Hobbes. Like the philosopher?”
odd. I was followed him whilst I pretended to be on my phone, and I saw him nod to one of the Guardians at the outer doors. And then the Guardian slipped his hand in his jacket, and the building went up behind me.”
“Oh, that.” Sherlock stretched like a cat. They were sprawled out on the grassy slope at the pond, trying to warm up in the sun. It was the first day hot enough to swim so they’d taken advantage of it, but the water was chilly enough to send them scrambling after very long. “Tedious, but not awful. The tea after was worse. Horrid Lady Lynde was there, she’s the patroness of the girl’s school, she always acts as though I’ve one foot in the grave. Told Father twice I looked flushed.”
Sherlock fumbled his tie off, fingers shaking, and tied it so tightly around John’s upper arm that his fingers immediately began going numb. “Like that?”
“I’ll need to have killed someone there, so there’s reason for me to have left the country,” Sherlock said with relish.
“It’s not as though he’s microchipped,” Mycroft said, a little irritably. “And I’m not omniscient, in spite of what Sherlock would have you believe.”
. Finally she told me that Alice was her daughter from her first marriage, that she’d gone on a hiking trip in the Himalayas and decided to stay and work with an aid organization there. She said Alice had a crazy ex-boyfriend and wanted to get away from him. I was like, wow, I never knew you had a daughter, cause there’s no pictures or anything, and she said something like Alice spent her holidays with her dad until he died. But then she got these totally scary guard dogs and I’m like, overreacting much? I mean if this was her daughter’s stalker why does
“Cheer up,” Sherlock said that night after Mr. Minchin had shouted the lights out. “It won’t be for long, and I am sure the laundry is lovely and warm in winter.”
“Who’s on top?” John may not have studied these things in school, but he had once been the youngest of a pack of stableboys, and knew how it worked.
“Yeah, okay, spare me thy honeyed words, Romeo. I know you’ve got an ulterior motive here, care to fill me in?”
“--and the Bennet’s, that’s got the most attention in the papers because of the, you know, the daughters.” John remembered the Bennets from the ball. The whole family, like that of Lord Sherrinford, had been murdered, and there had been hints of atrocities in the papers. “Which was clever of Moriarty because it increases public outrage while at the same time distracting from the fact of his real target, which was your father. Now he has leverage to overturn the reforms and use the military to crack down on his opposition and strengthen his own position.”
Of course John would not be comfortable climbing into his bed. Sherlock’s face felt hot and he was glad of the dark. Actually, John’s head was in the perfect position now. Sherlock curled onto his side on the edge of the bed, rested his hand lightly on John’s hair, drew his fingertips back, slowly, and then did it again. John relaxed under him. Sherlock let his mind drift back to his hedgehog, to mathematics, to music, to the Ninth Symphony, to the chorus, to choral music, to motets. He thought of the motet he wanted to find at the museum the next day. He thought of the piece he was composing inspired by Lassus’ motets, transposing the voice parts for string quartet. There was a part that dissatisfied him. He heard it in his mind, the piercing sweetness of the sopranos, then the high notes of the violin, high, high, high, edging up the fingerboard…he saw the notes as sound waves now, the frequencies changing like bright colors; then finally, as he began to slip under, they became stars, cold and pure in the descending darkness, their edges a soft prickle under his fingers.
all the time.” Mrs. Donaldson’s disdainful sniff let them know exactly what she thought of that. “No wonder the daughter turned out how she did.”
“The dry weather’s broken the back of the dysentery, looks like,” John agreed. “I’m glad things are slowing down. although it means Dr. Woodcourt will have time to pay attention to my ward soon, which doesn’t bode well for the Musketeers.”
“Oh, everybody knows that song where I come from.” John yawned. “I should have asked Callie how she knows it, it doesn’t seem to be widely known in the south. I think it may be Irish, actually.”
Sherlock, always delighted to have an audience, settled himself happily on the step. “It was dead easy to get to the cellars from here; I just went through the kitchens, and then I slipped into the back part of the cellars the way I found and came upon them from the other direction. I was behind a great lot of rubble, so they never knew I was there. I arrived about 11:30--I waited for Kent to make his rounds, he never comes between about 10:30 and four unless someone is very badly off--and Al and Norb were already there, with the hatch open, waiting.”
“Oh, by the—“ he cut himself off at Mrs. Gregson’s disapproving glare. “—blessed St. Eligius. Lads, if there’s any more trouble, save it until tomorrow unless it’s life or death, all right? It’s enough to drive a man to drink.”
John sighed, climbed out of bed, and tripped over Sherlock’s discarded running shoes. Cursing, he shoved them under the bed so that Sherlock would have to search for them later. Still, Sherlock seemed to be in a good mood; he must have come up with a new line of attack on his run. From a three-patch problem to a three-mile problem, John thought, pleased with his good influence.
Get on with it. Sherlock pushed the roll back in his pocket, set all extraneous thoughts aside, and bent to the lock. It was old but well-maintained, and he had it open in seconds.
Sherlock blinked several times, trying to process, knowing the truth already even as the larger part of his mind refused to accept it. “Mr. Holmes,” the woman said. “You’re looking very well. I don’t know that I would have recognized you.”
The previous day had been fair, unseasonably warm for March, though today was dark and wet. John had ridden his bike, yesterday. Sherlock had been watching when he came home, Mary and Lily already back and waiting for him outside in the sunshine. Lily had just learned to walk and she was toddling determinedly on the pavement, clutching at Mary’s hand, when John came around the corner. “Dada!” Lily cried, and John’s whole face lit in a beaming smile.
John secretly thought his all-black Guardian uniform looked less like the one his great-grandfather had worn and more like something from the Third Reich, but he kept this thought to himself. They seemed to be skirting a more upscale neighborhood. John caught glimpses of women in elegant, feathered hats, nursemaids in starched caps pushing prams or holding the hands of white-gloved children.
Just another minute, he thought, and then I’m going to climax like a bloody freight train and then--
Sherlock fetched his map and found the route to Mallaig quickly enough—it was already on his map—and he and John both memorized the directions to the fisherman’s house. John also memorized the codes and radio information, just as backup, though he freely admitted he would probably be lost without Sherlock.
He found Sherlock standing outside, smoking a cigarette. From the smell around him it wasn’t his first.
Sherlock turned to have been correct in every particular, of course. He considered the self-satisfied face of Timothy Whittington, imagining how much less pleased Whittington was going to look in his mug shot, but that was putting the cart before the horse. He’d no evidence, for one thing, and arresting Whittington might tip Anthea off that he was getting closer. “Follow the money,” Sherlock muttered, and rang Mycroft.
“He hemmed and hawed a bit, made Commander Moriarty think he was thinking about it, only he wasn’t. He let Moriarty talk on, all about other things he could do to sweeten the deal, but finally he got tired of playing with him and told Moriarty he was too late. Said that you’d…that he was going for a honeymoon heat in a few weeks’ time and that if it didn’t take that he’d promised you to Commander Magnussen for a better deal than Moriarty could manage.”
One grim night John stumbled out into the sleet only to be immediately picked up by one of Mycroft’s sleek cars.
“I’ve seen that for myself,” Sherlock said, but he was smiling and Lestrade knew he was pleased with the compliment. “I’ll certainly keep it in mind, Detective Sergeant.”
The ancillae sat toward the back. Sherlock spotted Molly in their usual place—amazing how quickly one learned to recognize acquaintances without being able see their faces--but to his surprise she seemed to be talking to someone, an ancillus whose face Sherlock couldn’t see. As he slid in beside her he saw that the omega was pregnant.
The pieces clicked into place: the notes in his prayer book, the tiny parcels under the altar rail—“The morning-after pills. That was you all along.”
Sherlock, who found all religions equally ridiculous, still bristled instinctively on John’s behalf, but John just said mildly, “What happened to his mother?”
“When I was young,” John said slowly, “my father was thrown from a horse and broke his arm. Sir Willoughby had the doctor out, and he let me help to set it. He was kind, but he was honest. He told my father, ‘This is going to hurt like the blazes, but you must hold still like a man, and then it will be done, and if you do as I say it will heal good as new.’ I saw how he made my father believe it, and how my father set his teeth through the pain while the doctor pulled and I held the splint. And do you know, he was right—that arm healed straight as the day he was made.” He paused. “Later I asked my mother if she thought my father would mind if I became a doctor instead of a jockey. She laughed and told me that I could no more become a doctor than Mary could grow up to be a horse or Harry to be a jockey, which apparently they had wanted in their time. That was the way of the world, she said. And it was, for me.”
“She’s going to drop the phone in a toilet,” Sherlock said, standing too. “Mycroft! Call your people, tell them to get to her
Sherlock made an inarticulate sound and twisted, his head lolling back to bare his throat. There was a faint mark on the white skin above his collarbone, a fresh bruise from John’s teeth. John did not remember making it.
When John got out of the shower he could hear Sherlock in the sitting room talking away to someone. It took him a moment to realize that the oddity nagging him was the fact that Sherlock sounded neither demanding  or impatient, which was his default setting on the phone: he usually endured talking to people only as long as was necessary to get what he wanted. Curious, John stuck his head through the door. “Who was that?”
The glancing touch arced through Sherlock’s never endings like electricity. He froze. John’s face, inches from his, looked as shocked as Sherlock’s felt; his fingers tightened painfully around Sherlock’s bicep and wrist.  Sherlock could not breathe.
“I used to hear this song clubbing,” John said reminiscently. He crossed over to Sherlock and held out a hand. “Feel like dancing, gorgeous?”
They dragged chairs up to the hearth and ate the beans straight from the pot, having given up on toast after burning the first two pieces. When they’d finished Sherlock poured them each a whisky. “It’s against the law, my drinking this,” he observed.
There came a pause in the Commander’s snoring and Sherlock froze, not even daring to close the file he was holding, until he gave a great snorting inhale and started back up again. Obstructive sleep apnea. Sherlock carefully slid the file back, thinking. The NeoTories had reestablished a rigid social hierarchy based on class and gender roles: secondaries on top, betas at the bottom; alphas in command, beta men in the fields, omegas in the bedroom and women in the kitchen. (They also preferred a pre-Industrial England of green fields and apple-cheeked milkmaids, with the manufacturing and factory work outsourced—to India, of course. That had accorded well with India’s view of its own role in the new world; hence the alliance, although Sherlock wondered if the Indian press portrayed England as the jewel in India’s crown rather than the other way round.)  But with so many men gone to the Army many beta women had been allowed to continue in their former roles; they were better off than the omegas, in some ways.
John was not so sure. That was perhaps the worst thing about their stay in the palace: the feeling that he was trapped in a limbo with no clear idea of what he was meant to do next. For years they had had a singular goal, which they had accomplished, and now…what?
“Barret was hit,” Sherlock said to her. “It’s his shoulder, it’s not serious, John’s a doctor and he can help him, but if you’ve a first aid kit in the boat…”
Sherlock stared. Surely John wasn’t suggesting he drop his pants? He felt a rush of heat in spite of the gooseflesh rising on his arms.
“We don’t always talk about you, you conceited git,” Lestrade said. “I’m asking John what he thinks about me getting a cat. The wife was allergic, but now I’m on my own…”
Sherlock went still, thinking, and then said, “You’re right. That car we just saw, going south—it passed us a few miles back going north.”
John felt sick, but Sherlock was outraged: “Three suicides amongst veterans who were all slated to attend the same retreat and nobody noticed? Tell me they didn’t all take place in London.”
“Sherlock, it’s New Year’s Day. There’s not going to be anything on. What are you looking for anyway?”
discreet. Apparently Sir James thought that I was some sort of kindred spirit to his little monster and that I would therefore persuade him to man up at last.” She rolled her eyes. “Of course this wasn’t going to work. I did try to tell him at the beginning, but he was quite persuasive.”
“All too well. Take care of your lad there,” Owen answered and then looked uncomfortable. “About that…you know I was just taking the piss, right?”
“Yes. Of course in that same period of time she killed at least three people of whom I am aware; I suppose contract killing isn’t a terribly time-consuming occupation. After Moriarty’s death she told her supervisor that her mother had passed away and that she would be moving to London for a fresh start.”
John took the news stoically; it was not unexpected. “Thank you, sir. I could go back to my regular duties today if you like, but I appreciate the chance to stay a few more nights.” Sherlock occasionally still had nightmares about the coal cellar, and in any case still spent most nights coughing and restless.
stupid enough to be the sort who stored his passwords on a bit of paper cellotaped to his drawer, Sherlock thought hopefully.
“Not until we’re finished,” Sherlock said severely, so John sighed, took a cold shower, and went to bed alone.
John cut through the tape binding his ankles to the chair and dropped to the floor beside Sherlock, who was breathing shallowly in a way that was not quite whimpering.
Sherlock had been tortured on several occasions, the last just over a month prior to his extraction. He had been in terrible pain, and oxycodone had been easily obtainable in prison. After the last time he had been transferred to solitary confinement and at that point had also begun taking high-dose alprazolam.
John could see it: Sherlock’s legs spread wide, all stretched out and fucked open and filled with John’s come, just waiting for John to fill him again. He realized with a small shock of surprise that he had not been thinking about that fictitious girl at all. It was Sherlock he wanted, Sherlock he wanted his teammates to see him fucking and claiming: Sherlock with his long legs and white neck and piercing eyes. The most brilliant, beautiful man John had ever known.
“I don’t know,” Watson said. The house door opened and there stood Phillips, implacable as ever. Watson hurriedly turned and got out of the car, bending to open Sherlock’s. The next words were in a low whisper Sherlock barely heard. “But stay away from him.”
John, emboldened by the way Sherlock’s face had lit up when he walked in and the steadiness of his fingers, screwed up his courage and said, “You know, you could always text me if you wanted to ask something. Or phone. The number’s the same as it was.”
Mycroft feel?) He felt a flash of guilt, remembering their moment of shared communion in the kitchen. “He’s not so bad, you know.”
Alone in the green room for the first time, John slept peacefully through the night and in the morning woke hungry for his broth. “We’ll see about some food for you when the doctor comes,” Mrs. Medlock said, smiling.
Sherlock swayed and suddenly Mycroft had his upper arm in an iron grip and was tugging him firmly back to the relative stability of the landing. Sherlock blinked, vision clearing, and looked at him. He wanted to say thank you. He wanted to apologize. He wanted more than anything to be lifted up into the great bed again and feel safe.
Warnings for the next three chapters for S3-style John being...even more S3 than he was in S3. Sorry!
John nodded. “Mycroft’s working on it. A car crash, probably. He’s, er, rather good at it, planning fake deaths. Lots of experience.”
“Sorry,” John said as lightly as he could. “It’s late, and I’ve got work tomorrow. Besides, Mary should be back from her book club by now and she’s probably waiting up to tell me about it.”
Would it? Sherlock didn’t know. He took a deep breath. “I tried to put them away,” he said. “All those memories. I put them in a trunk and locked the trunk in the cellar of my mind palace. Rather a dungeon really. But I’d put desire in there as well, and when I tried to let it out, it was a bit like Pandora’s box, I suppose.”
“Yes,” Sherlock whispered. He moved to stand, to wrap his arms around John like before, but John backed away.
Because it's popping up in the comments a lot: The Purple Shirt of Sex(tm) was from series 2, and we haven't seen it since. I highly doubt he'd still have it in his possession four years later! I know, I know, I love it too, but to be honest? I love that dark blue shirt more!
Okay, looks like you're getting three chapters today and four chapters tomorrow, so buckle up, fuckers. Make sure you didn't miss this morning's chapter, and subscribe/check back later for one more.
They went downstairs to join Sherlock’s parents shortly thereafter, following the bright scents of lemon and garlic and the clink of dishes and silverware. They’d barely crossed the threshold before Mummy was on them, ushering them to two seats at the dining table, romantically lit with candles and piled high with food and… presents?
John shook the solicitor’s hand, thanked him for his services, and followed Mycroft out into the early evening light as a free man.
I’m terrified that, once all our truths are out on the page, you won’t want me in your life anymore.
“You fell in love,” Father clarified, cradling one of John’s favorite dog-eared books in his weathered hands.
This is the last chapter for today. Make sure you didn't miss the other three, 46-48. More tomorrow!
He forcibly dragged his mind back to the present and looked up to find Sherlock watching him. Normally he'd look away as quickly as he'd looked up, avoiding that intense gaze that made him feel so flayed open, so obvious. But today... he wanted to be seen. He wanted Sherlock to know. So he gazed right back, and even quirked a tiny smile. They didn't break the gaze for a long moment, until the cab pulled to a stop and the driver cleared his throat awkwardly.
Sherlock cut him off with a long kiss, slipped his tongue into John’s mouth with a low keen, and the fire in John’s gut flared immediately back to life. He released Sherlock’s shirt and ran his hands down to Sherlock’s hips instead, dragging them flush against his own and grinding, hard, his blood singing with need. They both groaned into the kiss and broke apart with a gasp.
Please stop asking me about The Woman. It’s not what you think. It was never what you thought. She is clever and interesting and a challenge and completely uninteresting to me from a romantic standpoint. Please ask yourself why, despite having ample opportunity, I never once had sex with either The Woman or Janine. There is a logical deduction to be made and I fully believe you’re mentally capable of getting there.
“Don’t suppose I could convince you two to come back to the station and give me a statement before you go dashing off,” Lestrade interrupted, then took a step back, as if sensing he had walked into an awkward moment.
"So don't," Sherlock said with a nip to John's ear. "You're always telling me not to think so much."
"So, what are you two doing for the holidays? Heading to Sherlock's parents house? Quiet day at home?"

“You already knew my opinion on this when you texted me this morning, Sherlock. I’m not sure why you thought it would have changed in the past few hours.”
“That’s not all you could have gotten up,” Sherlock grumbled, and disappeared under the covers. John gave a panicked yelp and scrabbled away, sending the sheets flying and the cold air of the room rushing into the bed.
in response to my plea for cost of living info. I took plenty of liberties, but I wanted to at least be in the ballpark.
“Be with me,” he whispered into the space between their lips, then ducked in for another long, lingering kiss. “Let’s be together. Here.” Another. “I love you.”
He should have been shocked by the words, should’ve wanted to call them back, be gentler, but the way Sherlock's head fell back against the wall, the moan vibrating in his throat—it was hard to feel sorry about anything.
Sherlock took a slow breath in, letting the moment fill with that charge, the buzzing energy that sparked between them more and more frequently of late. The corner of his mouth curled into a tiny smile, and he reached over to touch his glass gently to John’s.
[Folded inside the card is a copy of the fully executed paperwork granting parental responsibility until the adoption can be made official, dated from the morning of February 4th. Mycroft Holmes is listed as a witness]
"Sherlock, if you're still pretending for the sake of the guys, now would be the time to stop before this goes too far," John gasped, thrusting involuntarily from the proximity of Sherlock's hand. God, he wanted to kiss him again and never stop.
I’m not sure that’s true, actually. If I had loved you more, I might never have had the chance to do all the soul searching I’m doing now. I may have lived my entire life never really knowing myself, or living myself authentically. That’s quite terrifying. I may not have loved you as much as you wanted, as much as a husband should love a wife, but I loved you the right amount to eventually be able to let go and get to where I needed to be. I did love you. I did. I don’t know if that makes any sense, but I know what I mean, and that’s the important part.
John covered his face with his hands. The problem was truly embarrassing, and one he really didn’t want to have to explain to Sherlock. Sherlock stared at him expectantly, though, so he fumbled for something suitably vague.
At the last, he waved a hand, accidentally smacking John lightly in the chest. John covered the hand with one of his own and squeezed.
“Actually,” he interrupted, a bit sharply due to Mrs. Hudson’s elbow jab. “I was just telling Mrs. Hudson that I found a new restaurant I think you’d like. I made reservations. If you don’t have anything on tonight.”
With no protest from Mary, the solicitor began handing the forms over one by one. From his place against the wall, Mycroft explained the procedure.
Sherlock stared hard at the back of John's head, as if he could see into his mind and read his thoughts if only he could look hard enough.
The glass was at his mouth without him actively deciding to put it there, his tongue tracing the rim, dipping out to tap it over and over like evidence at a crime scene. And it was quickly
“So, what do you think your parents have planned for tonight? Anything special? New Year’s Eve traditions?”
“Figured we could distract ourselves with some crap telly,” John said, shifting another box aside to access the power outlet. A faint click from the kitchen called him back, and John finished preparing their tea—milk, sugar, tea bags out, the most British of solutions to an excess of suppressed emotion. John carried the lot of it into the bedroom along with the food from Speedy’s.
“Yeah, okay, you caught me. While you were… gone, there was this American bloke, showed up on the street one day. Stephen. A doctor, bit scruffy, but looked
Sherlock pushed up into the kiss with a desperate groan and climbed fully into John’s lap. John tugged at Sherlock’s curls again (quite possibly a new addiction), and Sherlock gasped against John’s mouth. Perfect opportunity; the kiss deepened, tongues curling in a hot, slow slide, one or the other or both of them humming and groaning and melding their bodies together.
“I was just about to bring up some biscuits for you three, but it seems awfully quiet up there right now.”
“He was probably worried about overstepping and decided not to give it to her. He did look so sweet with it, though, hiding it under his coat like a thief.” She giggled, and John could picture it, Sherlock sneaking into the flat, getting caught with the stuffed animal, flushing the embarrassed pink John so loved to see stained across those sharp cheekbones. Mrs. Hudson raised an eyebrow at John’s dazed half-smile, and it was his turn to blush. Her wrinkled hand cupped around his where it rested on the table
I don’t think I’ll ever be completely rid of that fear, Sherlock. I’m always going to remember what it felt like when you were dead. I’m always going to remember you laying there in a pool of blood, how it felt when you jumped, how it felt when I found you in that hospital bed. You kept trying to leave me—
, breathing. Sherlock’s head swam with the smoky scent of scotch, the imagined slide of John’s mouth on his, and his breath huffed out in a little sigh that fogged up the interior of the glass with his heat.
A beat. Sherlock’s eyes darted over John’s face and body, deducing everything John had been hiding, been suppressing for years. Badly, but not entirely unsuccessfully, judging by Sherlock’s reaction. He let down his guard, let it all show, let his face be open and clear.
Hallucinations [  ]  Delusions [  ]  Sleep Problems [X]  Appetite Problems [  ]  Drug/Alcohol Abuse [X]
Or perhaps recognition for his brilliance, no matter how much Sherlock enjoyed it, wasn’t the kind of affirmation he needed. Maybe he wasn’t saying the right things.
They stumbled into the bedroom in a tangle of limbs, Sherlock’s rumbling laugh in John’s ear. Sherlock pushed away from him and fell backward onto the bed, propped on his forearms, and when he looked up through his lashes, cheeks flushed and eyes bright, John’s heart stopped.
“After what I said earlier…” He broke eye contact. “Word might get out, I’m afraid. People might talk.”
his mother’s meddling taking effect, making the atmosphere in the flat strange and heavy, so he snatched the phone from John’s shoulder with no mind for his floury hands.
Of all the ways he'd imagined this evening going, none of his potential scenarios included Sherlock being his emotional support, carrying him home so he could have a good panic. What had truly changed, though? It wasn't anything he hadn't already known in some dark corner of his mind for years. It was simply a fact. Just another fact about him.
"Yes, well," John said, shifting awkwardly in his chair. "I was rather deeply in denial there for a while. Probably not gay, actually, I do legitimately like women. But, uh... men. Too."
"Good night, Watson," Harris said, covering Patel's mouth with one enormous hand. "Go take care of that man of yours. Let's do this again sometime."
“Boys, honestly,” Mrs. Hudson begged. “It’s not right to be so cross with each other this close to Christmas. Can’t you just—”
“Mycroft, I want that naloxone here in twenty minutes,” was all he said, then slung Sherlock’s arm over his shoulder and helped him to the door without a backward glance. Behind them, the car doors slammed and the engine revved as it pulled away.
of tension and wanting into the sweet, slow motion of their lips. Their bodies aligned, hummed with the perfect harmony of their hips together, John’s fingers as five points of steadying pressure in the small of his back where his skin thrummed with the contact.
“Bed,” he demanded, and Sherlock groaned his agreement. John scooped both hands under Sherlock’s arse cheeks and hauled him up off the edge of the desk, then went in for another bruising kiss. Sherlock buried one hand in John’s hair and wrapped the other low around his back to guide their slow shuffle toward the bedroom.
"And so I told Mrs. Turner she was being silly," Mrs. Hudson said with a wave. "Money is tight enough for her as it is and you know I've no shortage there, but she
Sherlock stopped dead in his tracks. “Ah, actually, I’ve just remembered a critical mold experiment that I really—”
He is amenable to starting couples therapy with Sherlock, so I called Sherlock back in for the last few moments to get them scheduled. The three of them make a beautiful family, and I’m honored to help them get a solid start together.
, Sherlock. There is no risk for you in this situation,” Mummy continued, but Sherlock cut her off with a quick gesture. His phone was glowing with a missed text message, timestamped five minutes earlier.
“Of course,” Mycroft replied, drawing a small, wrapped package from his pocket. “Would you like it under the tree?”
Dishes passed and plates filled, piled high with too many kinds of potatoes and some kind of crunchy green bean concoction. Jane dominated the conversation, which was just fine with John. He sat back and ate, watching Sherlock from the corner of his eye for any sign of discomfort. The food on Sherlock’s plate melded into a pile of unfortunate colors and textures as he pushed it around listlessly.
John froze, his shoulders shifting back automatically. Defensive mode. He turned to face the source of the voice: Tall, thin, close-cropped dark hair, with a short blond man holding his hand just off to his side. He could practically
John has worked hard and progressed remarkably quickly over the past few weeks. The man who walked into my office today could not be more different from the man I saw in early January, much less from past months and years. He seems comfortable and at peace with himself and the world in a way I’ve never seen from him before. Overall, he has the air of someone who has shed a heavy burden.

a future. He is making plans, reconnecting with friends, letting his family back into his life. He spent nearly ten minutes talking about his plans for Rosie Watson’s birthday party this weekend, which he has been working hard to plan and prepare. The pictures of his craft projects were a delightful addition to our session.
[SH reaches for JW again, and this time JW allows it. He collapses against SH’s chest and wraps his arms around his waist. SH pulls him close with both arms around his shoulders and rests his cheek against the side of JW’s head]
“I’ve got you,” John murmured, running a hand over Sherlock’s shuddering form. “We’ll get through this.”
Sherlock snorted at that, and they both collapsed against each other, laughter shaking their shoulders. Hands drifted, the space between them softened, and before long they were swaying gently to the music, John's left hand tucked in Sherlock's right, resting quietly with their foreheads leaning together. Lingering in the moment, enjoying the last bit of tension as it melted away into warm surety.
[Sherlock Holmes and John Watson enter the field of view at 22:19:16. Both are laughing, their shoulders bumping every other step. Their cheeks are flushed and their eyes are bright]
Sherlock grabbed a handful of John’s jumper and hauled him up to press their mouths together, pouring every ounce of his complete and utter happiness into the kiss. And in John’s mouth was the most unique of flavors: Sherlock, plus John… plus the lingering taste of Merlot.
Once he started scrolling through the photos on his phone, he grew quiet. The recent photos were almost entirely of Rosie or her birthday party prep work, excepting a few that he scrolled quickly past with a blush. When I asked what he was feeling, he grew cagey, hesitant, then finally admitted he was afraid of being judged for thinking about things too early. At my encouragement, he blurted out that he wants to adopt Rosie, wants to have a tangible, legal connection as her parent. He deduced her existence before John and his ex-wife even knew, made a vow to protect her eight months before she was born, feels intrinsically tied to her and wants that to be publically and legally acknowledged. When I advised him to discuss it with John, he rolled his eyes (‘obviously’) and said he had done a lot of research into options and hoped to discuss it this evening. Similar to our last session, he appeared embarrassed or self-conscious about this desire, but also determined. He wants this, and he’s willing to do whatever it takes, if John allows it.
Before you are both joined together in marriage it is my duty to remind you of the solemn and binding character of the vows you are about to make. Marriage in this country is the union of two people voluntarily entered into for life to the exclusion of all others.

“My parents are coming here for Christmas,” Sherlock said, knowing the surprise would knock John off balance. John floundered predictably, his mouth gaping open for a long moment.
"Yes," John said, drawing Sherlock forward by the hand to get some measure of control over the situation. "This is Sherlock. Sherlock, this is Bill Murray, who you’ve seen through the blog, plus Jenkins, Patel, and Harris."
"Go give that to Lestrade, then come find me. If you're still absolutely miserable, we'll go," he said, tapping the rim of his glass against Sherlock's with that tiny, mysterious smile he'd worn so often of late. "I'm off to find Molly. Be nice to people, please. It's Christmas."
But really, i’m doing a lot better these days. Six months sober is a big anniversary. I’m serious about wanting to be able to be there for Rosie. And for you. About the drinking… for me, I had to cut off completely. I couldn’t have just a little. You aren’t as far down the rabbit hole as I was, so I’m hoping that will work for you. I know you can do this, Johnny. Call or text me every day and tell me what you’ve had to drink. In my group we pair up with accountability buddies and it really helps, having someone to report to every day.
A weight off his soul, words shared rather than hidden away, and it was the start of a chain reaction he couldn’t control.
“Quickly, John, the capture of this man’s murderer depends on your assessment of this camel’s wounds,” Sherlock said with a gesture to the body on the nearest slab. “Start with the right flank.”
"Fine. Sure." He pushed away from the table and stood, gathering the dishes from Sherlock's place, because of course Sherlock hadn't bothered.
way, he couldn’t be sure. But it didn’t matter, ultimately. Sherlock had sacrificed for him over and over and over. It meant something. It meant everything. He’d been oblivious and selfish.
And there he was. Standing out in the open, looking up at the snow, his duffel clutched in one hand. Fluffy white flakes drifted onto his upturned cheeks, and the setting sun turned his silvering hair a blazing gold. He was
That said, I’ve been told by fellow analysts that I might have a second career in writing romance novels, so I give you my thanks for that. It's as good a retirement hobby as any.
Iain took another step into the room. “Would have been by sooner, but you never answered my fucking texts, you cunt.”
I'm going to do two chapters/day for the next few days. I'm so impatient! Check back later or subscribe for more.
Sherlock’s throat constricted at the sight of John’s warm, crinkled smile, so he only nodded, taking the mug and following John out into the sitting room. John picked up his own mug and went to stand by the window and, after a moment’s hesitation, Sherlock joined him. He was careful to place himself a comfortable distance away, but John ignored it and shifted closer until their arms brushed with each sip of chocolate. Outside, the fine powdery snow had shifted to fat, wet flakes, falling in a thick rain over the dusted streets.
They stood together, cheek to cheek, on their dusty, threadbare rug, under the watchful eyes of the skulls and the smiley face and the bats and beetles and books. John leaned back to look into Sherlock’s eyes, to feel the sweet tension of
There was little in the world John Watson loved more than spending the hours after a successful case watching Sherlock go soft around the edges. They laughed inappropriately, walked too close, had dinner with their legs pressed together under too-small tables, and John let himself bask in Sherlock’s cleverness, his joy and unreserved smiles.
Even as Sherlock’s eyes took in the details of the soldier before him, his heart sent out a pulse of light; recognition.
Mary sat completely unrestrained across the stainless steel table from John, and he couldn’t shake the crawling sensation of danger dragging fingernails down his spine.
John and Sherlock, you have made your promises before these witnesses, and in doing so begin the rest of your lives together. May you always believe in each other, and in the love that you share. It now gives me great pleasure to pronounce that you are now legally married, joined for life.
“You’re much quieter these days,” Mummy said from her nest of blankets on the couch. She had changed into flannel pyjamas and made them all hot toddies, then settled down with one of Sherlock’s monographs while Father perused John’s collection of mystery novels. Sherlock hadn’t spoken a word to them since John left. His lips twisted in reply to Mummy’s words.
"Here," he said, handing over the bag before he could he could lose his nerve. "You left your gloves at that crime scene in Clapham, and I saw these and thought you'd like them."
And Sherlock Holmes, with his flat full of sealed boxes, with his bullet hole and lingering burn scars, was almost certainly in love with John Watson as well.
"All right, come on, you tossers, let's go inside and get started with the drinking before we get any further, yeah?" he begged, squeezing Sherlock's hand in a silent signal to please keep it together just a bit longer. "I need a pint if I'm gonna look at your ugly mugs all night."
, Sherlock,” John murmured into the skin of his thighs, thrusting and twisting with first one, then two fingers, and Sherlock was inside-out, flying apart from the sparking pleasure in his gut. Another finger, and he whined, high and long, as he drove himself down, fucking himself on John’s hand.
But Sherlock slipped away into the twilight, and was halfway across the street before she caught sight of him again. He disappeared into the off-license on the corner while Molly got caught at the pedestrian crossing, her lips twisted in a wry smile. That was Sherlock, always dashing about after something or other.
I never said you didn’t. You deserve good. Like Molly. Molly is good. For you, I mean. Not me, obviously. Too many breasts.
I’m glad you came to me with this thing you’re going through though. We queer kids gotta stick together. Our phone calls have been great, but this is the most we’ve actually TALKED about stuff that matters in… years.
John reached out, slowly so as not to startle Sherlock, and brushed the sweaty curls off his forehead. Sherlock tracked the movement with his eyes, then let them fall shut when skin made contact—feather-light, tentative.
Father pressed a cup of coffee into John’s hands and clapped him on the shoulder. “Morning, son,” he said.
Sherlock shrugged. "It's not something that comes up often. You know how I am. There aren't many people in the world who can tolerate me."
A warm rush of elation fills Greg’s chest, presses behind his eyes, and dear God it’s a good thing they’re trying to keep this quiet or he’d be crying at a crime scene. He wants so badly to ask a hundred questions, to laugh and hug them and shake them for taking so damned long, but he clears his throat and chokes it down.
“Have you now?” Sherlock said, eyebrow raise, and John tugged gently at the curls under his fingers.
“Are those tickets for the LSO’s Stravinsky program?” he asked. Sherlock looked up sharply, brows drawn together.
It felt just like being in the army. All dad’s bullshit felt so far away while I was over there, so irrelevant, I just tuned it out. It didn’t matter. It never needed to matter. I had no problem ignoring his voice while I was giving out blowjobs to my fellow soldiers in Afghanistan. Why should I let it bother me now? Why should London be any different? Especially when he’s dead and can’t come after me anyway? It not. It’s not different at all. It’s like I flipped a switch when I was deployed, then flipped it back when I came home. Well, I’m flipping the switch again, by choice this time, and I’m breaking the damn thing so it stays this way. Now that I’ve been reminded what it feels like, to want men and be wanted by them and have that be known, I’m never going back. This was exactly what I needed. This reminder, this pseudo-Afghanistan in a dark basement of sweat and sex and music.
John blinked to make sure it was truly Mrs. Hudson standing in front of him, not Sherlock. "Come again?"
The echoing silence was too much. Sherlock slipped Iain’s card from his pocket and turned it over in his hand a few times, then strode over to his desk to get his phone. New contact, Iain MacKelpie, new messa—
John reports that he is enjoying his anger management classes despite the fact that they are “bloody awkward” at times. He has been able to speak openly, identify his triggers, and practice incorporating the strategies that work best for him. We talked at length about the anger triggers that have been most persistent for him in the past, specifically Sherlock’s fake suicide and his father’s homophobic abuse. John expressed fear that he would never be completely over Sherlock’s suicide, but believes that he has finally let go of much of the trauma resulting from his father. He drove out to the cemetery where his father is buried over the weekend and he said his final piece, made the conscious choice to let everything go. Then he visited Sherlock’s empty grave and did the same. He admits that he’s not sure whether it will “stick”, especially in the latter case, but he wants to try. He has requested that, once this class ends, we add elements of anger management into our appointments once per week as a maintenance dose of sorts.
John Watson had planned on a perfectly boring, uneventful Friday night. The clinic had been slow. Sherlock had just solved a case the night before and was delightfully docile. The weekend stretched before him with quiet promise: curry, bad mystery novels, and if he was really lucky, a movie night with Sherlock where he could subtly try for a cuddle. It worked occasionally. This weekend felt like it could be one of those times. He settled into his chair with a sigh and rubbed his socked feet together with a contented hum.

“Thought you could show me around London for the night, take me out on the town. And in a country where sucking cock isn’t illegal, too, what a luxury! What do you say, posh boy?”
“Off on a date tonight, then? Who is it, the barista from Tuesday? She has ten cats, you know, and—”
contained Sherlock’s microscope and some of the lab equipment he’d made such terrific messes with. John unpacked all of it into a messy heap on the table.
Sherlock strides over to John and places his left hand on John’s chest, right over his heart, the ring a bright contrast to John’s navy blue jumper. One of John’s eyebrows is terribly amused by the proceedings, and Greg is at a total loss—until John’s hand comes up to cover Sherlock’s. John’s left hand. Sporting an identical ring. Sherlock murmurs something in John’s ear and they laugh, leaning their foreheads together, their eyes secretive and sparkling and incandescently happy.
series by SilentAuror. Just a little scene that lodged itself in my head after finishing the most recent installment. I highly recommend both this series and absolutely everything by this author. Every time I’m like, nah, there’s no way I’ll like this thing, I read it and it’s amazing, so. Read the things.

Sherlock’s father clapped a hand on his shoulder and squeezed. “I’m sorry you had to go through that, John, but I’m glad you’ve found some peace.”
I am writing to inform you that I am resigning from my position as Analyst for the SIS. It has been an honor to serve the crown in this capacity for the past twenty-five years.
swallow it. We’re going to start with this and give it an hour or two, see how you’re doing, then add more. Okay?”
Good evening, and welcome to the Mayfair Library for the marriage of Dr. John Watson and Mr. Sherlock Holmes. This place in which we are now met has been duly sanctioned according to law for the celebration of marriage. If any person present knows of any lawful impediment to this marriage they should declare it now.
This is a 221b (221 words, ends with a word that starts with b) written in honor of 2/21 and inspired by drunk Sherlock in TSoT.
Molly Hooper was a woman on a mission, and she refused to be swayed. She had Sherlock Holmes backed into the corner of an adorable sweet shop draped in gauzy fake snow and cheerful twinkling fairy lights, pinned there by the force of her glare. She pressed her lips together into a thin line and stared Sherlock down.
Lestrade huffed a laugh. "Yeah, that's right. Because John needs someone to talk to, see? Someone who understands."
wanted more, and it’s so hard to deny it when I’m here. It’d be even worse if I were here all the time, if I had no separation. And it wouldn’t work forever anyway. There are only two bedrooms, and Rosie will need her own eventually, so unless Sherlock and I… I’d have to move out yet again, and I don’t want to put us through that. I won’t.”
John’s heart kicked back to life, flooding his body with heat and electric anticipation. He tightened his finger around Sherlock’s and forced his gaze from Sherlock’s lips to his eyes.
The facilitator was very thorough and his comments (attached) are promising. Between the course, our work together here, and his acceptance of his sexuality, I feel that if John can continue on his current path he will be unlikely to repeat his past violence, though we will continue to incorporate anger management into our regular sessions and watch his progress carefully. He broke down in the middle of our review when the topic of his past violence toward Sherlock came up, and he admitted to an ongoing struggle with negative self-talk regarding those incidents. "I know where it came from now, but it doesn't excuse it. Even if he forgives me, it'll still be a while before I forgive myself, I think." He acknowledges the need for self-compassion in this regard, and will continue to work on it. He’ll need some practice putting his new tools to use in everyday life, but I believe he has the support he needs from friends and family to stay true. He is not at 100%, but he has worked hard over the past month, has been honest and committed. I believe he is on the road to long-term recovery, and is in a position to begin a healthy romantic relationship. He thanked me for my help, and by the end of our session he was laughing through his tears. "I can't believe I'm doing this. It's really happening. I'm actually taking Sherlock Holmes out tonight." He laughed again. "I have...
Lestrade turned more fully toward Sherlock, a blinding smile visible even in his peripheral vision. He couldn’t turn, though, couldn’t meet the smile, couldn’t look this thing head-on yet.
I call upon these persons here present – to witness that I, Sherlock, do take you, John – to be my lawful wedded husband – to love and to cherish from this day forward.
“How about we skip the going out part,” Sherlock said, shifting closer until he could feel the heat of John all along his body, “and go straight to bed.”
They made it to the first floor landing with Sherlock swaying on his feet, half asleep already. John guided him through the sitting room door with his eyes on Sherlock’s dragging steps and quiet, whispered encouragement on his lips. Once through the door, he looked up to take in the welcoming sight of 221B, his home up until seven days ago, the home of his heart, his—
“I guess we have to get up and get this whole Christmas morning thing going, yeah? Mind if I borrow some PJ pants and a dressing gown?”
A tiny thing to help me cope with John's violence toward Sherlock in TLD. Past abuse and homophobia are referenced.
Sherlock withdrew his phone from his pocket and unlocked it. John sighed internally. So much for that conversation. Should have expected Sherlock would be distracted by the first—
Well, that sounded simple enough. "Okay, so, he was telling you he loved you in one way, but you wanted to hear it in a different way."
"Trauma related to one's sexuality is... not unfamiliar to me," he finally said. "Please accept my apologies."
"Let's find out," Sherlock said, popping the button on John’s jeans. He dragged the zipper down, slipped a hand inside, and John saw stars.
"No, no, just us," Molly said cheerfully, swirling into the dining room with a glass dish of... something marshmallowy. Call-me-Jane clapped in delight.
“I know.” John dragged his hand down Sherlock’s chest to rest at his hip. “I know that. But this kind of thing doesn’t just go away overnight, and I know you know that. Even now that we… that we’re… doing this, now. I just want to make sure we’re both okay. Okay?”
“Let me guess. He fucks you at night, tells you what great friends you are, how much you mean to him, then denies you in public, yeah?”
An unbearably endearing grin interrupted John’s words, and he had to visible force himself to stop smiling so hard so he could continue. “—even though you always rehearsed the Sugar Plum Fairy part, too, because it was the most challenging, and because you thought the girl who always danced it was horrible.”
He closed his eyes and let himself drift, remembering the press of John’s lips and body, the strength of his arms, the gleam of joy in his eyes. His body pulled and ached in delicious ways with remembered pleasure from the night before, and Sherlock’s mouth tugged up at the corner of the memory of their first time. And the second. And the third.
Sherlock snatched up the envelope and carefully withdrew the contents. His eyes darted over the pages and, to John’s alarm, quickly grew moist.
Thank you SO MUCH to everyone who has stuck with me through this fic, despite me finishing late! If anyone wants to help me go through it and actually edit/beta/britpick/etc., let me know! I’d like to polish it up for next Christmas.
Then they were inside, the thick, too-warm atmosphere of the pub wrapping them in humidity as they headed for a corner of the pub holding no less than fifteen strapping military lads, all of whom turned to cheer as their little group entered. The six of them made their way over and grabbed a table on the edge of the gathering, John steering Sherlock to the seats on the end so they could make a quick getaway if needed.
