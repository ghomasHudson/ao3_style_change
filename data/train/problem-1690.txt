Then he realised that he’d actually ended the collaboration the same way it had started, with a handshake and a smile, which felt minutely amusing, in a twisted, tangled sort of way.
And yet…there was nothing.
“You could argue that – “
“Out of spite? Or boredom?”
“The gag isn’t a ruddy priority right now!” was the first thing out of John’s mouth once the gag fell away.
Sherlock couldn’t help the stiffening of his body at that particular comment, no matter how it was phrased, but took some measure of comfort in the fact that it was only for a moment.
The blond looked to the ginger for answers, but only got a small but pertinent grimace in response, which he took to mean that Mycroft didn’t know but would explain what he suspected later.
“Something like that. But he wouldn’t have bothered sending one of his most trusted minions out to deliver those things to you if he thought you could – “
Oh, no. Oh, please, no, not that.
It’d only be for another year, in any case – if Mycroft couldn’t be persuaded to let him go to university early, that is. Whether he was 17 or 18 when he started hardly mattered, did it?
He didn’t accept the watch.
But something still worked. Someone was still in there to react.
“We can do it, Doctor Watson,” she said, smiling with her eyes again. She looked at them both. “Otherwise, we wouldn’t have agreed to take you when you contacted the clinic. Your health comes first and after that, the health of the babies. We’ll schedule you for appointments every fortnight for the remainder of the pregnancy.”
Moriarty grinned, the grin of a skull or possibly that of a knife blade, his eyes gleaming. Then he twisted around Sherlock, nimble as a cat, and reached for Tessa, his fingers almost touching her, still with that glint in his eye. Something that had been unhinged in the moment.
“Excuse me for being…so uncouth,” he managed to hiss, trying to keep his jaw from moving too much, as the thumb hadn’t moved. “I wasn’t taught the right etiquette…for meeting murderous psychopaths in…ridiculously expensive suits. Please…enlighten me, so I will know…in the future.”
Her adoptive mother called her name again.
But that was the point, wasn’t it? Moriarty was no longer just a genius criminal, he was one of them, and he’d taken the time to –
Not that Sherlock was wrong. Well…there probably was at least some part of him that felt he had a right to her, whatever he would like to believe about himself. But there was more to it than that, even though he knew that sentence was used by the very people where there really was no more to it than that. They merely wanted as plausible an excuse as possible and maybe even a rationalisation to themselves that concealed the truth of the matter.
Sherlock returned the kiss.
“I would’ve thought my erection if nothing else would’ve been an abundantly clear indicator that that notion is utterly incorrect.”
He checked, almost instinctively, for a temperature but didn’t feel anything that’d be worrying.
“Sherlock, I’m not leaving as long as I’m not mating claimed or whatever it’s called. In fact, if that’s what you’d prefer, I won’t leave your sight, provided it isn’t going to take weeks or the like. But I can’t change the fact that it happened nor do I want to keep silent about it.”
He took a step forward, ignoring the way he could, by the brunet’s estimation, see the amber eyes gleam out of the corner of his eye and the cry of his name from Sherlock himself.
It was also somewhat delicate so he really oughtn’t be fiddling with it so much. There were mechanisms in there that could break, and even if they weren’t irreparable, they weren’t fixable right this minute, which they would need to be for the thing to work when it was meant to work. Which was paramount, to say the least.
He now pushed at John’s shoulder and the doctor, guessing his meaning, stopped. John then shifted to a kneeling position that didn’t require him to support himself on his arms, though he was still careful not to press into anywhere except what his knees and his hand touched.
Who in turn stiffened as he thought he saw the pupils become slits again, but he blinked and the gaze was no longer on him, so he told himself he’d just been imagining it.
His smile now had a hint of a smirk to it, though only for a moment before he let it drop away, both the smirk and the smile. There was no need to be smug and cocky about it.
“Ruby?”
What he in fact ended up prioritising was getting to talk with Mycroft.
Or maybe it was just that the others were all implicit in that one descriptor. That to say more might upset Sherlock more or tip him off and be more likely to send him running after the doctor than fending off Mycroft. Or it might mean nothing at all.
At least, there was no need or call for it yet. Better to save that for when this was truly over, though honestly, there were a lot of things he’d rather do when they were out of the woods than focus on feeling self-assured.
But John shook his head.
There. He’d said it. Or at least, he’d articulated most of what he was feeling in that regard.
“I just said no!”
There, John turned to his partner and for a moment, the mask fell, and Sherlock saw the whole array of emotions that he would’ve expected from his Omega.
He realised what was going on with a jerk and instinctively tightened his hold on the thread. However, when he looked down, he saw no indication that the thread had been pulled or slipped out of his grasp even a little, which of course wasn’t a guarantee but even so –
“I know that!” Sherlock snapped back. “Of course, I know that! Just as I know that I’m being stupid for tensing up and for being scared but that doesn’t mean I can stop it.”
He paused, seeming to think for a moment. “The point, though, I think, is that there’s still a pair to be. I’ve spent most of the night and morning being worried, being downright terrified, honestly, that either you or I would die today.”
Though his back was turned, Sherlock could feel Moriarty’s departure in a way he hadn’t before, which was…oh!
Apropos that, did – no. If they did know, it would have been taken off him. That or they’d have mocked them for it, with the Alpha thug’s gun pointing at both of them. Unless, of course, the dark-haired man had only just noticed and therefore intended to take it off John right now, which –!
He was about in the right place, though, for him to stand just perfect for seeing what Sherlock’s contact had come up with as a substitute after the fire. Which, while not what he’d had in mind at all, was everything she’d said it would be, including better than the original.
Then he said, more quietly yet much more earnestly, “I love you.”
All that said, he stood tall under Mycroft’s scrutiny, his chin lifting slightly, proud to display the bond bite openly. Not that he was ever going to have it marked by the tattooed ring around the outside of it that was popular among certain Omegas, or the even more gaudy embedding of more or less precious stones below or above the teeth indentations, or that he’d specifically choose clothes that showed off the bite. He had no need or desire to flaunt the fact that he was indeed now bonded; he knew and so did his mate, and that was all that really mattered. The world could piss off.
“John – “
“John, I’m not trying…I mean, I didn’t, I wasn’t, I promise that I – how do I convince you, then?” he asked, sounding increasingly pleading and just a little desperate as he spoke.
It seemed that his fears were proven right when, on the morning of the Monday that would’ve been, should’ve been their last rehearsal before the concert itself, he got a text from John.
It was no guarantee that what might be considered a…well, a romantic gesture for anybody else, and by that he meant any other dragon, would be interpreted that way or be done for that reason by Sherlock. Of course, it could be argued that this was an unconscious and therefore a subconscious action, but that still hinged on Sherlock being interested in John…like that.
Part of it, more than likely a great part, was in a probable effort to cope with…all of this, to be honest. Bring a bit of normalcy about it – which was the other part, wasn’t it? If you could call it that when it was weaved in with the first. Reverting to behavioural patterns previously established between two people, especially if they were ones between siblings, was pretty common, after all, and probably, though John was no expert in such things, even more so in stressful situations.
The Omega huffed a minute laugh that lacked any amusement. “Don’t I know it. Some it was, though, and we won’t know for certain how it’s affected them. Yes, we’ve had tests done and it doesn’t seem as though there’s been any damage done but that’s at present, with many caveats and possible risks further on, and I know you’re going to say that I shouldn’t worry, that it’ll do no good to worry – “
“Stop right there. You’re not overreacting at all do you hear me?” There was more than a hint of a snap to his voice at that. “We ignored the deterioration of the scent bond last time, at the very least partly due to not knowing enough about it to know what it could do or how we ought to behave, ought to be careful.”
One genius with a precarious mind was enough to deal with, why did there have to be two? Well, misery liked company and genius needed something to measure itself against, he supposed.
The man, who was a Beta himself, shrunk back the moment the Alpha stepped forward. He didn’t close the door, however, which was the important point right now. Nor did he scream or call for the police. There was hope yet.
Or maybe not. Looking closer at Sherlock’s expression, though the sulk was set pretty well into the features in general, there was something in his eyes that was…pleading? Was that right?
It had looked as though they’d been content to take only the girl but then, just as they were leaving, the wife had screamed and run after them, fingers outstretched.
There was no response from the dragon, neither verbally nor facially, which was…something to keep an eye on.
He held up his wrist in evidence. The claw marks were clearly visible, blood, both fresh and dried, and all. Sherlock winced at them.
Time in which Sherlock went through a myriad of emotions, the amount and strength of them immobilising him while the two others tumbled down together in a heap, John starting to crumble beneath the power of the dragon’s stare – which only worked as fast as it did, he knew, because of the time he’d already spent under the active execution of a dragon’s influence – and the jaws opened, moving closer.
He didn’t have an answer to that.
He got a nod, a vigorous one despite the curly head’s position. Interestingly, not to mention comfortingly, the hands did not tighten their grip, just stayed exactly where they were.
“Yes, we do. But you’re arguing a completely irrelevant point just on principle. Or to be contrary for the sake of it, which is more or less the same thing when it comes to you.”
Stalking his prey? But dragons weren’t exactly the type of shape suited for stealth. Of course, they would be far more capable of that when in human form but even so, their mindset didn’t seem right for that, either. Then again, Sherlock wasn’t normal for a human being, it’d somehow make sense that he’d employ behaviour not typical of dragons, either.
It was relatively late by the time they got to the hospital and all the way through to the solitary room where she was kept under observation. This was not so that doctors could study her, John had made quite certain of that before they’d left, but to monitor her in case any complications or other unforeseen occurrences. The solitary room, which was firmly secured, had been chosen so that no one would smell her Heat and be overcome by instincts or bright ideas.
, despite all that had happened – even if he couldn’t remember an apparently large portion of what had happened and not just when he was comatose, he could infer quite a lot – that felt significant. Extremely significant, as though there might be some hope yet.
“Won’t you introduce us, Sherlock?” Mycroft said, voice carefully welcoming. He flashed an insincere smile.
Where it might lead them.
“It was a stupid thing to say.”
“Isn’t that like a big red flag, then, him going in here? Advertising where you live?”
Reassurance. Reassurance that he wasn’t leaving, was what he meant.
About time that John returned that, then, in more than one way. Not exactly meet him measure for measure, but in the ways that would have meaning for Sherlock.
John couldn’t deny that some of the lingerie he’d seen would look good on the slim, tall figure, either. But they had best stay within in his head, as fantasy.
“I deserve to get my ear pinched?” Though, to be fair, it had brought him out of his thoughts, and he felt a smile tugging at his lips.
It only registered that he’d picked up an abandoned, half-full mug of tea and thrown it when it clanged like a porcelain clapper against a metal bell against the corner of the mantelpiece, then fell onto the tiles in front of the fireplace, breaking into three pieces, what little tea that hadn’t described a messy arch in the air flowing out between them.
Considering that, it also made far more sense for the older brother to reap some benefit like that from being a dragon. Either that or he was heading for a breakdown at some point, his heart giving him issues later on, especially considering his diet. It might not consist solely of cakes and biscuits, whatever Sherlock claimed, but it evidently wasn’t the health option, either.
He settled back down, staring up at the ceiling while his hand found its way, almost automatically, into the tangle of curls, carding through them as carefully as possible.
The last customer in front of them was being served his drink, the efficiency high in the shop.
The soft toy was still in his hand.
“See what?”
Why was that? Had he managed to sink further into whatever primal state he’d descended to? He didn’t seem to behave more ferally otherwise but perhaps that wasn’t how it worked with dragons.
The image of Mycroft proposing to John outright was too appalling to consider.
They had had enough of that already, so now they would move forward from that and would find a way around this.
To be honest, even though he had technically seen far worse things in his life, Sherlock knew that it was something that would be burned into his own, unable to be scrubbed away or otherwise deleted.
But this was…
Better move fast, then, hadn’t he?
Sherlock stopped the thought with so much force that his brain had to do a hard reboot for a split second.
No time, though. Search room. Find watch. That was the priority. Everything else could come later if it were even relevant at that point. He knew he was letting himself be distracted with just about every little thing that could distract him even though he couldn’t afford to, and the knowledge annoyed him, even more so that it wasn’t even helpful to know it.
It didn’t take a lot to work out what ‘cordoned off’ in fact entailed. John wished it made him feel as safe as it should.
Well, no, that wasn’t true. It was just as touching because they were really very much linked, weren’t they? The love was what made those mundanities have meaning and the mundanities grounded the love into something concrete and proper.
No, not…well, perhaps a bit but mainly not. He trusted Sherlock and while yes, this was a test of a sort, it wasn’t an unreasonable request, given everything, nor did it mean that he didn’t actually trust him. Besides, it was as much for Sherlock’s benefit, for his piece of mind as it was John’s.
The fact that they were there at all was comforting, though, and not because John had a lot to gain and even more to lose and would therefore have a lot to be nervous
“It’ll be okay,” he whispered and tried to believe in it fully himself.
He had three little lives who depended on it.
He tried to shift again, on the chance that being home, being safely back in his territory, with his treasures around him, would convince his body to let him go all the way back to human. Or human-shaped, in any case.
“Beaten up? Well, yes, Sherlock makes up for what he lacks in experience with sheer tenacity, but the worst of it has been patched up and the rest has already healed.”
The dark-haired man moved his leg up and away as soon as John started to shift, as though he’d not just read his movement but his intention, too. Which, given who it was, probably wasn’t far off.
“That’s one way of putting it,” John said with a scoff.
For any artist or creator, there is a distinct risk, if not outright certainty, that time will lessen your opinion of your own work, to the point where all you can see are the faults and other issues, leaving you to utterly despise what you’ve made, unable to comprehend how you could ever have liked that piece to begin with, let alone thought it good.
“Not until you stop worrying about utterly unimportant things that will sort themselves out.”
“Why should I?”
I realised I had never given John's little girl a name, which I felt horrible about, so I gave her one that's close to my heart. :)
The doctor didn’t speak at that, didn’t move. But the corner of his mouth turned up, just enough for Sherlock to see, which made him smile in turn.
I have pulled somewhat from my own experiences of waking from an induced coma and my prognosis and issues, so there's some precedent, at least. For the rest, I hope it's been believable enough, even if it's not exactly a light, easy path in front of her. I hope you'll forgive me.
The fact that its face was no longer visible probably played a part in that, of course. It’s a bit easier when you don’t have eyes, bead or no, staring back at you as you do it, judging you or asking why.
They had all been home today. Though their little girl had started preschool when she had turned three, she was off today due to sickness. What exactly that sickness was, the man clearly didn’t want to say, at least not to Sherlock.
explanation from the older Holmes brother but then, he never really expected that from him, as much as it could annoy him.
Now he’d graduated from poetic to useless metaphors? Oh, good. Especially when Moriarty was precisely the reason he ought to focus. One of the reasons, at any rate.
One wouldn’t have thought the human skin could go beyond white in colour but somehow, the man’s skin had gone beyond that into outright transparent. At least, so it seemed.
pay Sherlock back but, not wanting to rock the boat further after what had just happened, he kept that to himself.
“No, of course not.” He paused and decided to plump for honesty. “Not at
He couldn’t fail that trust.
‘Just curious. Am I not allowed to be? – SH’
I should stop making promises, shouldn't I? I only end up breaking them. I'm sorry. Thank you for all the kind feedback for the last chapter, though, and for the one still reading ;)
John listened intently for further sounds, this time mainly from the dragon side of things, even though he also kept an ear on the outer door, just in case that somebody did try to break in that way.
“I know.” He tightened his grip on the other’s hand. “Still, I promise I’ll improve.”
"Hang on, how the hell would you know that he was a most trusted one?” John asked, sounding significantly calmer than when Sherlock had returned, something that had grown in the last few comments, but then again, this was sorting out the practical, as it were, that would always be easier for him. Well, John, wasn’t alone in that, was he? “Have you met him?”
“Alright, no need to mock me for it.”
Feeling the beginnings of anger bubble up inside of him, John paused to think before he allowed it to become any more than that. It took a bit of effort, especially with the trip home he’d had, but he managed it. If he was asking Sherlock to change and better himself, then it was only fair that the doctor himself followed suit.
And again, the way that he was holding onto him felt warm and comforting, just like one would hope it to be. It didn’t feel possessive in the slightest, which was admittedly not great as evidence, to say the least, but John would take it.
But then, none of his bland girlfriends had actually known
His hand found his middle, rubbing at what could so easily still be mistaken for nothing more than paunch, which had been to his benefit while he’d been in the harem. No matter the number of babies residing in there, he would allow nothing to hurt them, including vindictive harem owners and one Irish Alpha madman.
“Well, regardless, it’s quite a different thing to have multiples rather than the one.”
John sighed heavily. God, they had a lot to work out yet, didn’t they? In all sorts of areas. His only real consolation was that they were working it out, talking about it and being willing to listen to each other. That said, that was quite a major consolation, really, one he was increasingly grateful for.
“You kissed
He watched Sherlock’s pupils grow significantly at the unexpected comment and could smell the change in his scent as well, at least before he reined it back in, with a will that was wobbly and took more moments than he likely would have anticipated or liked but was unquestionably strong normally. It was merely somewhat…hampered at that moment.
Arrogant sod.
Nor what he meant by the fact that he had stayed in the doorframe, waiting, rather than coming to meet John. He was calm and composed, both in face, posture and scent, but everything about his clothes and his hair, not to mention his eyes, looked dishevelled and, if John could say that, worried.
His silence evidently aggravated the dragon, which rumbled somewhere in the depths, the eye’s pupil contracting. It shouldn’t be possible to contract further but it did.
If only they ever were, really, instead of merely not quite as stupid as others.
He could hear the slight snap to the end of the sentence and made a face. Not that Sherlock could see it, as he was pulling ahead just a little bit at that point.
Sherlock cut himself off at that, though that was main because John had distracted him by reaching into the bag in question and pulling out the item.
Hesitating for only a moment, he pushed his fingers through the thick mass of curls, much like Mycroft had done earlier and for much the same reasons. Unlike when the elder Holmes had done it, though, Sherlock moved at the contact, pushing into the hand. Not much, not like he might have done in…in different circumstances. If those would ever have arisen, of course, which he’d always doubted and now…well, those doubts hadn’t exactly diminished. Rather the opposite, really.
“What you’re saying is that once again, I shouldn’t apply puny human conditions to the might of dragons, is that it?”
The Beta, reassured as much by the doctorial manner and the apparently open, friendly demeanour that John did so well, relaxed a little again, nodding in agreement. Yes, that must be it. Mrs. Bisset across the road was always very…interested in what was going on in the neighbourhood.
“I took this,” he continued, keeping the eye contact that hadn’t faltered, “not, as you’re assuming, because I’m a dragon and I cannot help myself. If that was the case, you wouldn’t be able to move for things in the building, quite apart from the flat. Whatever a dragon ends up collecting, most tend to be somewhat selective, but few are really that discriminatory over time.”
He had to swallow again and take a deep breath to keep his gaze on the other. How could this still feel so very vulnerable and soul-baring, even when he had already got the result he’d hoped for? When he was supposed to be safe and dry, as it were.
Sherlock spotted the smile in the voice. “Definitely. All the support in the air and love is terribly distracting.”
In reality, of course, Mycroft would’ve likely smiled and been happy to see the development in his brother. On the inside, of course. There was no need to divulge such things
He started to move away, towards an assistant to presumably pay and get them to deliver.
“Then what was the passport for?”
“I don’t think that you would ever harm me,” he began, looking the other in the eye. “I never have, whatever you have been up to. I wasn’t thinking it through, which is no excuse, I know, and I’m not trying to make it one.” He swallowed a little. “It was a stupid thing to say, with no justification, and I’m truly sorry I said it, love.”
So, what were his options, then? Kissing, of course, but that ran the risk of being seen as a way to circumvent the issue more than anything.
“Part of? Why only part of?” John asked. Then he answered his own question. “Because there are several other factors playing a part, such as the bullets, and they are all tangled up.”
She didn’t say anything but merely held out a single sheet of paper to him.
“There is one.” As he spoke, he unwrapped himself from the shorter man enough that he could drag him outside. Not that he couldn’t push his way through the roof if he shifted fully into dragon form, but when he couldn’t shift back into a human guise, the likelihood that he could become full dragon was minute, to say the least. In any case, there was still the same issue of time.
Nor did the fact that the wings weren’t invisible because they were folded in on themselves but because they rested far, far above him.
John and Sherlock try to get some rest but get sidetracked by working out how this is supposed to work and
Why was he suddenly feeling self-conscious about it? It wasn’t as though he didn’t have quite a lot of details about John taking up space in his brain, details which he had no intention of deleting. He had even aired some of them to his flatmate at times, without so much as a blink or a care, even when John hadn’t taken to the revelation favourably, to put it mildly.
This was what Moriarty would’ve been faced with, wasn’t it? The times he had met John in the harem, that was. Almost certainly, it would have to have been, considering the Omega’s position in the harem and the Alpha’s behaviour.
“Don’t apologise. It’s okay.”
So maybe John was right, and he was indeed projecting, though he would still say that the doctor was scared, too. Not that that negated his feeling scared, obviously, he wasn’t going to try and deny that.
The honorific straddled the ground between respectful, though not deferential, and flippant and slightly mocking. More towards the former, however, in contrast to his first meeting with the man.
“But I don’t. There’s no excuse. Please, go on. I promise I won’t waste any more time.”
He didn’t say keeper, because he wasn’t entirely sure the nurse wasn’t trying to listen in. Not for any malicious purposes but just because there was a culture of nosiness between staff at most hospitals, especially where the hierarchy was more rigorously enforced; it was a relatively safe way for Omega, and to a lesser extent Beta, staff to get back at their Alpha colleagues, who were most often their superiors.
Didn’t have to fear Sherlock.
A murmur went through the crowd as they looked at them, the relative colour of the blond’s bruises enhanced into vividness by the spotlights on the stage. His rumpled clothes probably didn’t help either, public school and state school parents being equally adept at snobbery and prejudice.
It didn’t matter, though. So long as he got to spend time with John, nothing else mattered.
So, it was up to his bond mate to do what he could to get everything sorted and fixed.
“Your skill at stating the blindingly obvious yet completely useless is yet unmatched. Perhaps you should ask your parents to bottle it for you? You need to make a living somehow, after all.”
He thought he heard a noise come from the dragon as his foot made impact but whether it was one of pain or merely surprise, he couldn’t say. It wouldn’t have mattered, either, if not for the fact that despite his best effort, his ankle was not let go of. The grip didn’t even loosen.
And he would have told him if it was. Sherlock knew that he would
There. We finally made it out of his Mind Palace and through some more worries.
He stopped, clenched his teeth and brought the heel of his palms up to press against his closed eyes. Harsh, slightly ragged breaths were audible.
The barista looked between them but was evidently quicker on the uptake than the snotty brat and just smiled knowingly.
Something wasn’t quite right with the expression on the brunet’s face. Yes, he could buy that he’d be shocked, maybe even a little aghast that he’d put himself out there like that, whether he’d meant it or not. To be downright horrified, however, seemed just a little too strong a reaction for it, or at least, not quite the right one for Sherlock to have.
Sherlock smiled and stole a quick peck. “Yes. Very sure. And you?”
Sherlock got there first, and not just because he was the one who had the least way to travel. While he waited, he smoked a cigarette and ran a hand through his hair repeatedly.
“Felt my stomach…flip.”
And what would that be?
In its love.
But when falling comatose like that or similar trauma, the brain jettisoned whatever was stored only in the working memory at the moment of the trauma. He shouldn’t be able to remember that, should he?
“For what? Fly around? Apart from the fact that people would be after me, for a host of varying reasons, there are far easier ways to transport yourself nowadays. Breathe fire? What would I have need of that?”
If her mind was still there enough to not only speak, which required far more of you than people tended to give it credit for, but also to recognise him, there was hope that she could make a recovery. Perhaps not a full one, that might be a touch too optimistic, but maybe enough that she could have a good life, regardless.
John looked at Sherlock, then down at their hands, then back up at the brunet.
The reptilian eyes didn’t blink but they widened. The teeth pulled away just slightly, no longer touching his skin, as the head tilted back upright to look him more directly in the eye.
“No, it does –!” John barely managed to stop himself before his voice rose again. Fuck’s sake, he just wanted to go to bed. He sighed heavily instead. “It doesn’t. He is scared that he will lose control, even though he…how do I convince him that control doesn’t need a vicelike iron-grip on the thing at all times? It was difficult enough to get him to agree to sleep just now, and I’m not sure he is in fact sleeping.”
“Point,” ‘John’ conceded. “Or rather, it would be one if you had chosen just about any other time than this to emerge and take Sherlock over. Why be content to wait for this long – and we’re not counting John in this, he’s a convenient catalyst – and only resurface when the overall mind was out of commission?”
Much to his surprise, therefore, John found that, so long as he worked slowly and carefully, frequently but very softly touching the other’s cheek or hair or similar while he worked, he could ease the limbs off of him one by one without any protest or indication that the brunet was waking up or had awoken.
“Hm? What is?” It came out slightly muddled, as though through a faint haze of sleepiness.
Why Moriarty would send both that paper to Mycroft and then send someone with a message to John or Sherlock, within a day or two, was a speculation that John would rather not have at that moment, as it made him worry and bile rise in his throat, and he was not going to allow this berk to see it. So, he pushed it aside for the time being.
Only play-acting, like an actor or possibly sometimes that of a child, however real they looked at the moment. Often, something fake can be made to look like the real thing far better than the real thing itself, after all.
That he didn’t have it on his person regardless of clothes, John put down to nothing more than ‘claimed’ being recognised by other human beings within personal space rather than clutching it to your chest at all times. It would still be seen as claimed, as it was in his coat pocket.
John and Sherlock work on gaining a better footing together and giving John a toe-hold into society and an identity as his own person again. And on gaining information for Mycroft, which in turn will help keep John safe.
It was enough that he had a moment of utter frustration and needed the help, the support that the blond was willing to give without hesitation. There never had to be more than that, at any point. Just as John never needed to explain when he held Sherlock painfully tight in the night or couldn’t stand to feel his body warmth, and not merely because the consulting detective could work out what the matter was without needing to ask.
to open it, unable to cope with the reality about to crash down upon him, one way or the other.
“The crucial part,” John began again once he’d sat himself back up, the watch somehow still in one hand and his other holding Sherlock’s own, “is that you started courting me by taking the watch. That wasn’t your intention, I’m well aware of that, but that was nevertheless what you did. It wasn’t merely a delayed hoard acquisition. Why? Because there are other things of mine that would be more significant to you, that you would go for if it were merely another thing to add to your collection.”
If he was to get at them…if he was, when there wasn’t any way for the wings to disappear, because they couldn’t before the wounds were treated which they couldn’t be until the coat came off, which it couldn’t because of the wings…the whole thing felt slightly disturbingly like the lyrics to ‘There’s a Hole in My Bucket’. A small part of John’s brain, possibly in a concerted effort to cope with a sudden burst of absurdity, latched onto that and hummed the melody in his brain.
After a pause, he added, “Thank you.”
His thoughts were derailed when John spoke, what he said getting his attention.
As a matter of fact, he would confidently say that few could handle it as well as John had, especially when in the situation, and if he needed someone, in this case Sherlock, for some support afterwards, that wasn’t a sign of weakness, quite the opposite.
It's still not a long chapter, I know. These chapters are hard for me to write, though, and draining, so it's the best I can do. Apologies.
That is a point,” he said, dry as anything. Then he turned his head to look directly at John and the expression on his face was entirely serious. “However, I do hope you believe me when I say that I wouldn’t do that. Not now nor ever.”
At the same time, there was a small, barely audible keen which sent John’s pulse up quite a few notches when he noticed it.
John managed to pull himself together. The look he shot the other was close to a glare. “Only for the fact that, oh, nngh, that’s not – stop! – that we don’t have any damn lube at hand, and I am not using hand cream or lotion or conditioner or whatever else might be close by. However posh or expensive it is.”
– he could only put it down to the one culprit.
Just take how he’d reassured John earlier about the teddy bear. It might seem insignificant, one ruddy teddy bear in the rest of it, but it mattered to John, and also to Mycroft, so Sherlock had let him do it. Had trusted him to do it.
It was only then he realised another difference.
Another dragging of the hand, this time across the entirety of his face and with a bit more force than the first one had used.
“What for?”
Once they were outside the building and quite a good way away from it, too, the blond finally stopped, after he’d looked around to check for any potential listeners.
Unfortunately, the theatre kids had felt they’d been snubbed when they couldn’t have their usual school play, especially the ones who had their last year this year, and so they were going to have their last time in the spotlight before they were whisked away to where they were one in a few thousand with the ability to perform rather than just a few dozen. Not that most of them realised that, of course.
“Quite. Then listen carefully, Doctor.”
Then, though his mind was filled with thoughts, he heard his name being called.
That and shutting down whatever backdoors was left. But, provided he could push the dragon back down, there ought to be enough time to do that, then return to John.
“Please, love, turn around,” came the voice again. The achingly, heart-wrenchingly familiar voice. Sounding…honestly, not as it normally did, but it didn’t…
No, what had mattered to him had solely been the case, the mental exercise and challenge, which meant it was irrelevant to him whether he upset anyone or not. That was their problem, not his.
When he woke, it was dark out, but he couldn’t gauge whether that meant it was very late evening or early morning. That might be just as much because calling it ‘awake’ was something of an overstatement as it had to do with the darkness not being particularly distinguishable, which in turn wasn’t helped by the artificial light from outside muddying things further. Then again, he ought to be used to that by now, didn’t he? He had lived here for a while.
To try and cover up, pretend that he hadn’t just blushed at something as insignificant as that, he started to undo his own trousers.
“No, but you are a dragon. The temptations are the same, from what you yourself have told me.”
Internally, he scolded himself, told himself that he shouldn’t get carried away. Not only was he sure that John didn’t mean it like that, he was merely being kind, there wasn’t any reason for him, Sherlock, to fan the flames of what could develop into a proper crush.
He kept his ears metaphorically turning throughout, to listen for and find any possible indication that the triggers were being pulled or the other dragon was sauntering his way back into the pool area.
“John?”
It might be that he hadn’t reared his head in some time, depending on how likely it was that he had made another phone call to John while Sherlock had been asleep, but that wasn’t to say that he was no longer interested or wasn’t watching, either.
He tried to sit up, surprised at the change in position, but stopped when the wing placed over him curled further around him in an apparent attempt to prevent him from doing so.
The important thing was just to get an overview of what had happened, not interview him for ‘father of the year’ or even conduct a police interview. He wasn’t that kind of detective, after all, whatever John had implied.
“I...” The barest hint of colour was visible in prominent cheekbones.
John bit down on the comment on ‘you tell me’, because it was neither relevant nor useful in the situation, much as it would be momentarily satisfying to utter.
But that wasn’t the same at all –!
“Yes,” he said. “Yes, and bloody well yes.”
To be honest, he didn’t know, and he was somewhat beyond the point of caring, at least unless it was a direct way to help his friend return.
Just an idiot.
Isn’t that a bit reach coming from you, though?” he asked, but the frown had smoothed into nothingness.
So why he said what he said next, he had no idea.
didn’t add up.
He had got better at it, significantly so, both through his own working on it and through the help of his bond mate. Very much the latter but the point was that although he had, it mainly related to John himself and he had a long way to go yet.
Nevertheless, John, whose shift had been cut short due to a fire in the adjoining building – they’d been evacuated for the smoke but as it turned out, only one person had needed medical assistance and so they’d gone home – came into the kitchen, looking concerned.
“You…remembered?” It came out very quiet.
“You shouldn’t trust me.”
"It’s not, so shut up and let me finish!” Sherlock snapped. Fortunately, the only effect was John’s second eyebrow joining the first.
Perhaps…perhaps if he could get John to keep watching his eyes? Alert him the moment he noticed his eyes changing into something more…more reptilian? It was hardly enough to be certain, but it just might be enough.
Then he paused, mentally called himself an idiot, and continued somewhat more truthfully. “Just…moment of panic that there might be a connection between this and Tessa. A more substantial one, I mean, than the mere fact that they’re both related to the harem and me. Which is ludicrous, I know. Even if she’d been…sold or something,” here he had to take a deep breath through his nose again, “there would be no reason for money to enter my account. I won’t be on any legal documents there are regarding her, if there even are any, so whatever this has to do with, it isn’t her.”
It also answered the question Mycroft had asked John earlier. In a roundabout way, at least. He hadn’t claimed him and if he’d tried to, he’d been unsuccessful. But it was evident that he wanted to. Subconsciously, without question, and, when he woke up, he would likely also finally be able to admit to himself and John what had been almost painfully obvious to the older brother for months.
John took it with a small smile, one of gratefulness and affection, and said, with a deliberately overly cheery tone, “Let’s see if it still applies when your knot is throbbing in pain from overuse, shall we?”
“So, you agree. Good.” The brunet redoubled his efforts.
“There’s the shapeshifting and the whole hypnosis thing you’ve got.”
‘…Is that your toff nose way of saying you’re bored out of your skull?’
Alright, so perhaps there was some ferventness in that last bit, too, he wasn’t going to try to deny that, and not just because it would be hopeless.
Of course, the reason they’d stopped in the middle of it all was because of consent issues and then it had devolved from there, but John still had the distinct impression that there was more to it than that. That maybe Sherlock wasn’t as ready for it as he was making himself out to be.
What was the matter with his brain? This went beyond his claim that sleeping and eating and such slowed him down, this was…
Still feeling rather apprehensive of the true meaning behind and the eventual outcome of it all, John nevertheless reached out to take Sherlock’s hands. The consulting detective let him do it without fight or comment, and he tugged them down and away from his face, gently.
When he took the time to look, though – and to be honest, it was getting progressively easier for the doctor to read him, especially in situations such as this – not to mention scent, John could also see that the innate excitement of a promising puzzle to unravel was not inconsiderably tempered with concern and the quiet fire of protectiveness.
That knife now hung more or less where the first one had but fitted much better and was easily accessible, too.
John was so worried about how his new life was going to be – even when he didn’t say it, it was evident to Sherlock, abundantly so – and about what and who he was now. Now that his life was so different from everything he’d known. He didn’t, at least not yet, realise that Sherlock’s own life had been turned upside down, in the best possible way, and while he didn’t have to reset and recreate his identity from scratch, there had still been a major overhaul of what had existed.
“Why do you ask?”
Now, though…he was still happy, in the pure sense that something he’d hoped for was happening, but it was…it felt wrong. It didn’t feel as though Sherlock was kissing him. Rather, it felt as though he was trying to establish an anchor, attach himself so firmly to the other that there was no risk that he’d detach and be cast loose again.
What he hadn’t counted on was that, upon the door closing behind them, John gave him what might be described as a withering stare for a moment or two, which was still within the realms of what he’d have expected.
Sherlock went on to explain that his badge should’ve been in his trouser pocket for ease of use, he knew, but he had left it in his inside coat pocket instead, he was a bit paranoid about losing it, see, as it was their first case going solo on something like that. Then, at seeing the state of him, he had quite honestly forgotten but if he would just wait a sec –
That Sherlock had quite a bit riding on this whole performance didn’t need to be any concern of John’s. It’d be no skin off his nose whether he showed or not, probably.
Then there was the question of if he did, would he be doing the case Mycroft was building against the harem owners a disservice, if not outright harm it? He wasn’t sure, though he suspected that it would. But when he’d voiced the concern, Sherlock had shaken his head. It hadn’t come from any of their users, had it? And though Moriarty seemed to have had free movability through the harem, there was no evidence that said he was an owner.
Some things couldn’t be helped.
He thought he heard murmured, “There you are”, but he might have heard that wrong.
Which was why, as he inched himself closer, he also angled his body, ostensibly towards John for protection and blocking. Tessa had not looked back at him and neither Moriarty or John seemed to have noticed anything, either. It was only a matter of time but the further he got in that time, the better.
It wouldn’t do him any favours to dwell on it.
John made a face that was halfway between denial and confirmation.
“But I love my Mama,” she whispered, in what seemed almost an apologetic voice. That couldn’t quite be right, though. Not at that age. Confused, yes. Frustrated, likewise. But outright apologetic? That didn’t sound right.
He got a slightly derisive snort for his trouble. “Why, exactly? It’s nothing but boring social convention.”
As was the man it had been created from.
They were moving again but he could feel John jerk beside him and tense.
A sound came from her lips, small and weak but John heard it, nevertheless. It was, after all, his name.
“Apropos of that,” he said instead, “what about singing? Duffy won’t let us off with just playing the piece. He’s not that much of a pushover.”
Had he lost the grip on the dragon while he had been asleep, as he had sought to avoid by intending to dose instead of full-on sleeping, and had…had done what he had promised himself and John he wouldn’t?
John would deal with that when he got there, and hopefully, it would be the right response.
Heart beginning to thud, he leaned over, reaching for the cloth.
John followed, doing his best to keep up with the longer stride. He didn’t say anything.
“Sherlock! What on earth do you think you’re – “
He brought his own hand up to let it trail through the strands of blond hair. It wasn’t softer than he’d imagined or anything like that, but it was still lovely to be able to touch it without having to think up some excuse.
Though many lacked what could be called an actual face, there was nevertheless no doubt that they were making noise nor that a good few of them were grinning at him.
He checked and while it for a moment looked as though he had found it at last, not in the sofa or his own chair but that of Sherlock’s, it turned out to be the sad remains of a belt that had been used for…something before his time, as far as he knew. Bearing the whip in mind, he carried it over to the waste bin, which was overflowing with paper to say the least, and dumped it in.
The moment he did, she let go of the hand and instead looked at him, as intently as she had before. Then, probably led by instincts, ones that had nothing to do with sexual maturity and everything to do with familial bonds, she sought out the scent gland in his neck.
Of course, courage and bravery was part of John, even when it tipped into recklessness and bullheadedness but even so…
He hadn’t intended to turn it into a question but that was how it came out.
“I know. I’m an idiot.”
“You’re being awfully calm about all of this.” It sounded almost like an accusation but not quite.
would ever admit to, even on pain of death. It wasn’t to set the cat among the pigeons that he’d drawn Sherlock’s attention to the doctor’s splurging on that one Christmas gift the year before.
What he said was, “I do.”
John didn’t answer. His smile instead became a sort of grimace for a moment, the self-conscious sort, which didn’t make sense. What on earth did he have to be self-conscious about?
In fact, he’d hoped that it would be like in the movies. More than a little bit, too, much as he was ashamed to admit that, to himself but definitely also to Sherlock. Admit any of it, really.
He let the implications of that be up to John to interpret from but judging by the sudden light in his eyes and the way they crinkled at the corners in a smile, he took it to mean that Sherlock had spent a good deal of time between getting the notes and now practising. Which wasn’t…false. He’d certain spent enough time practising that he didn’t need to see the notes to be able to play them but that hadn’t taken as long as it did for others.
Oh. Yes. Of course.
The brunet told himself it didn’t matter. That it was fine. All fine. He could perform his part of the song, he knew it by heart at this point, at the concert. Perhaps he could even improvise the lyrical portion that was intended purely for guitar, originally – hell, he’d heard it often enough by now, and it wouldn’t be the first time he’d played by ear and memory rather than practice and notes – and get himself out of trouble that way. Mr. Duffy wouldn’t make it Sherlock’s fault that John didn’t show.
like he was remotely alright? And if he had time to stand there and bloody well not just sniff him but ask inane questions, he could get him unbound and out of the bloody
“Right. Okay. That is a factor. But not an insurmountable one.” He saw Sherlock’s expression. “You won’t harm us, Sherlock, I know it.”
“There’d be what?” John prompted.
He was distracted from contemplating that further by Moriarty bending his knees a little as he turned towards John and Tessa.
What he found rather curious was that not long after he’d purchased something, Sherlock would find it. That wasn’t the curious part, though, nor was it that it wasn’t chucked. No, what struck him as peculiar was that the few times he’d seen his flatmate spot the thing in question, he’d seemed…well, pleased, was the only way he could describe it, really. Almost gleefully so, actually, which
However, that meant that he…that there were things in his hoard that he hadn’t intended…
But though the shaking got worse, there was no wet inhalation, nothing dripping down on his chest. Nothing to indicate that he was crying. Then again, he remembered, you could cry, sob, even, without so much of a tear falling. Without much of any noise, too, come to that.
They wouldn’t be performing a school play this year. That wasn’t what was bad. In fact, he didn’t care about the school play, except to plan how not to be part of it.
The Omega gave a fleeting smile at that which looked odd with his frown. He sat down in the one chair in front of the fireplace, the one Sherlock had just abandoned, and pulled the Alpha to him.
The feeling only increased when the blond then asked, “That’s how you feel about it? As if it’s part of your hoard?”
He smiled at Sherlock then leaned up to kiss him on the cheek. The Alpha turned his head and made it a kiss on the lips instead, but it wasn’t as though John was going to complain.
He still held one hand in his and that hand he squeezed tight, painfully.
“Right.” Some thought poke at him, hard. “Oh. How are you holding up? You looked rather…”
claimed John. Not…like that, anyway. He wouldn’t do that to…he had no
The fact that Mycroft felt confident enough, not that he was likely to ever openly exude uncertainty, to put her in a permanent document like that did something funny to John’s insides. Of course, it wasn’t as though a new passport couldn’t be issued, and quickly, too, if you had the right resources, i.e. Mycroft, but even so, the former soldier hardly imagined the ginger to go to the trouble of including her if he weren’t certain.
The man tried to protest at that, but the doctor insisted, smiling as he did so. He also mentioned that it would help his body to heal. There was the hint of steel to his voice that was difficult to ignore.
The image was so unexpected yet felt so right and filled him with such a warmth and heartache simultaneously that he couldn’t help wishing that the man actually had his own family.
What he needed wasn’t the dragon’s heart. Nor was it its mind. It would be handy to have a metaphorical muzzle and leash, of course, but the foot would do the job. More than one job, really, if he could pull it off.
“That doesn’t in itself mean you never have or that you haven’t tried.”
“It will.”
“We could get a nanny,” he said eventually.
If he had looked, he would’ve seen the urge to steal everything within a ten-mile radius for his own hoard, as a start, chained up beside the desire to burn all threats to said hoard down. He might have caught a glimpse of the feeling of rage he’d experienced most fiercely when he had first had something of his hoard destroyed.
And if that wasn’t part of, if not the whole of the refrain of this entire attempt, then he didn’t know what was.
Focus.
Sherlock let himself be tugged towards a bedroom.
“I don’t think it ever bothered me before,” Sherlock confessed. “Not like this, anyway. They’ve always been purely cases. Now I think of those cases and every face morph into…” He paused to grimace. “Which is stupid, and I know it’s stupid, because I haven’t seen her, so I can only superimpose your traits onto a toddler’s face, and that’s not even mentioning how utterly useless remembering them is, in this context or others.”
That was hardly the point, though, was it? Even if he’d written the ruddy book on it, he was out of order, no matter how much the little shit had annoyed him. He could’ve explained it far…no, not necessarily better, as such, but certainly kindlier, and with the same impact. Hell, he’d done that when it came to his charges, hadn’t he?
That had been the intention but despite his best efforts to stay awake – he remembered quite distinctly John’s tone changing at some point and had known it’d been him who’d been addressed – he had fallen into not only a sleep but a deep one at that.
That the caring consideration was at the forefront despite the swirl of other emotions there meant a lot to John.
Wasn’t it always when you thought things had already sorted themselves out that you were most at risk? Complacency breeds carelessness and inattention and those in combination breeds danger like nothing else.
Someone had to have crimes done to them, didn’t they?
You are amazing and sweet readers, one and all of you, and I'm grateful for all of you! I'm sorry this is a day late, RL stuff has been...somewhat rough. But it's longer than usual, so there's that.
Was he justified in being worried now? He took a moment to check within himself just to be absolutely sure, but he couldn’t feel that the dragon had managed to rise further.
Even a short distance away, he ought to be able to hear it far more clearly than he was. In fact, with at the very least the screech earlier, it had been loud enough that someone should’ve heard and reacted to it.
Here?
“Come now. You can grant me a little bit of leeway in that regard.” Mycroft smiled from his seat behind his desk and lo and behold, it seemed to even have the ring of genuineness. It must be something in the water. “Do sit down, by the way.”
So…where next?
He paused, the grin fading. “Sorry I got you drafted
The fact that he was this open in his blackmail actually counted in his favour, in the teen’s opinion. At least he wasn’t trying to be clever about it, that was something.
“I love you, too, John.”
The way he looked thoroughly sleep-tousled and disoriented, in the way that only Sherlock could, and a freshly woken Sherlock at that, helped cement it and consequently, helped set John’s mind at rest. Not so much because of the berk listening in on the doctor’s conversation with his brother as the fact that he needed the sleep even more than John himself did.
Only it wasn’t nearly as well-structured or intense. The thrill of this was…well, first off, it was tension rather than thrill, and it was relatively selfish, too. Taking back, not even necessarily rescuing, one little girl was hardly going to be the thriller novel of the year, was it?
Did anyone expect this to be continued? I did. :)
Firstly, he’d grown quite a few inches in the last year and now stood taller than most of the other pupils – to call them peers would indicate that he was at their level, which was a horrible thought – which made it significantly harder to remain unnoticed, much to his annoyance. Worse, a few other pupils seemed to have noticed, too. They certainly kept sending glances his way, which he didn’t understand. He wasn’t that gangly and ungainly.
He hadn’t been out shopping for clothes yet, too caught up with other things, and Sherlock being just part of it. Well, that was one reason as to why.
He smiled ever so slightly. That was, his lips curled a little and the corners of his mouth pulled up. It was gone in a flash, though, as he realised his mistake. “That there? That was – I should be ashamed that something like that came from a part of me, especially one so old and ostensibly cunning as you. The least you could do was be a little bit creative or have some proper dramatics to it, but no. Of course you couldn’t manage that. How could I even expect that?”
Sherlock didn’t even consider brushing him off. Not only would it be abundantly evident that that was a lie, it’d be making consideration that John hadn’t asked for. What he was asking for was the truth, and Sherlock would give it.
He would rather not but on the other hand, it did mean that his brother felt he was being useful. It had been what had ultimately persuaded him that Sherlock had it under control and needed no more frustrating meddling from him.
“It is if it’s vital – “Sherlock began. Despite the vehemence in his words, the expression on his face told a different story and the moistness of his eyes clinched it for John on not listening to what he said.
For a purpose, it turned out, and not to say goodbye. Instead, he’d unearthed a pen which he was pulling the cap off with his teeth. Then he started to write.
“Not as an object, John, do keep up. As a mate.” Well, that had sounded almost uncannily like Sherlock, but the doctor shrugged it off.
It sounded like he had a whole lot more to say but was interrupted, by a whole host of voices, by the sound of it. Sherlock just about heard the concerned brother voice dip into annoyance for a split second before it changed to oozing icy politeness. Then the line went dead.
“No, that’s fine,” John said with a smile. “Go on home. Sherlock and I can look after her until your colleague arrives to relieve you.”
As it sometimes happens when one starts doing something, it is impossible for anyone else nearby not to join in, whether it was a joyous or a sad thing, and so it was for Sherlock. An answering chuckle sidled its way out of him, the ridiculousness of the situation providing ample reason to and his comment being the last drop that made the cup run over.
In other words, he looked absolutely gorgeous.
But it wanted to be cunning. To intimidate him and scare him into submission. Into giving it control, like it felt it ought to have had from the start.
As he’d spoken with Mycroft, he had been looking around the room once more time, for the watch itself but also, although he knew where both the coat and the jacket were going to be, for any piece of clothing that might hold it, just in case.
That it seemed to have worked was the worst of –
“Then I’m an idiot?”
He clenched his fist momentarily at that, as though he was clutching something in there and was determined not to let go of it.
If only they knew what the exact cause, or, as it seemed to be, the exact mixture of causes was.
If there was a hook on the end of that sentence, it was so inexpertly cast that a blind fish wouldn’t be caught on it.
“Obviously, there is a significance to the bone dust. It’s the bones of a dragon that’s been ground down and then used to coat the bullet.”
That he’d merely been messing with them for the sake of it, because he had those papers and therefore got to ‘play’ with the two of them and had no…no real designs on the Omega or his daughter.
It boiled down to John’s friendship. You couldn’t have a friendship where the other part couldn’t leave. Even Sherlock knew that.
All in all, it felt as though he had lost more energy than he’d gained, somehow, and he was only an actual headache and a horrible inside of his mouth from a hangover. Well, that, and vomiting straight onto the airplane carpet, of course.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I don’t care what it takes but I will kill you. You piss about, playing these elaborate games with Sherlock just because he’s not merely intelligent enough to match and outsmart you but he’s bloody daft enough to be interested in playing your sick games.”
Whatever else he was, Sherlock was Sherlock, and he was his friend. His best friend, even if it was a one-sided thing.
Once he was released, Sherlock tugged at the hand he’d not yet released.
John looked a little taken aback, again, but recovered quickly and said that no, of course it didn’t. He was still her mother even when he was also theirs, just as much.
With all the uncertainty of whether to go through with it or not, however, the time he’d wasted on that, he’d been left with only a very short time before the big day to get the last bits of it sorted and collect what he needed on those favours.
That was…not surprising, when he thought about it, but it did prove that he had indeed made the right decision. Not just to trust John and himself and to get this over with and under control as soon as possible, crucial though that was, but to have pushed away
He started to get up, but long fingers shot out to grab hold of him, tugging at him.
The blond didn’t say anything to it. Instead, he reached down, grabbed his guitar, grabbed hold of Sherlock’s arm, a firm hold and began to walk up the stairs.
at that. At this point in time, it felt not only warranted but the only possible reaction.
The most battered but obviously loved little soft toy you ever did see.
The group of three that was up on stage now was the last ones before it was his turn and though they’d elected to put music to The Jabberwocky, of all poems to pick – then again, someone thought it a good idea to recite Kubla Khan, probably purely for ‘literary credit’ or something , so it wasn’t as though it was unprecedented – it wouldn’t take them long to finish.
It didn’t work. He was still stuck.
“Trust me. It’ll be fine.”
‘…What?’
Because this was only a temporary thing until John found a place to work, even if that somewhere had to be in a shop or a supermarket. Then he’d pay his share of food and rent, just like anybody else would.
“Tessa or Tess?” he asked.
If Mycroft, who made a point of ignoring such things unless they were detrimental to his job, was aware of it, it shouldn’t be much of a surprise that Sherlock’s instinct was to protect John at all costs. He was precious to him, after all.
‘You didn’t say anything wrong. At all. – SH’
“Don’t lie to me, Mycroft,” he said, and not even his voice was the snap it’d normally be when talking back to his brother or refuting a stupid point in general. It was much quieter, much more sincere. Much more unnerving. “I can smell the blood on both you and John, and not much of it is mine, at least not on John. I can also recognise claw marks when I see them, particularly my own, and you’d be wilfully blind not to spot John wincing, quite apart from what he said just before.”
Sorry about the summary. I am exhausted, my brain hurts and I know I've left this over a month so I just wanted to get it out.
Part of the brunet felt pride at her working it out as fast as she had, even if her instincts had helped her along, and children could be more in touch with their baser parts, as it were. It was still rather a good deduction to make.
There was a pause that went on for one beat of the wings. Two. Then, “I’ll explain when we get home. I promise. Any and all questions you have about this, John, I promise I’ll answer them. Fully and truthfully.”
He took a breath before he ploughed on with the meat of what he meant to say, as it were. “That’s not all of it, though. I think I’m as calm about it as I am…No, you’re right. I am nervous. It is a big thing whichever way you slice it. I’m not scared, though. It’s a bit like showing up for church and finding out you’re the one who’s getting married. That doesn’t mean you don’t love the one you’re getting wed to or wasn’t prepared to get married, it just means you’re a bit…underprepared when the day itself arrives. Does that make any sense?”
There could be no doubt about it, utterly ludicrous though it sounded – and it did sound beyond ludicrous. There was no such thing as a
His expression as he stared at the other conveyed a deep sense of ‘what the hell was that for?’ which deepened when he got a smile for his trouble, slightly enhanced by the twisting of his neck to look at Sherlock.
If something wasn’t done and Sherlock carried on this way, whatever his underlying intentions were for doing so, then he would, John believed, succumb in one way or another.
get even close to be in the clutches of that…that…
Potential suspicions he left well alone, too, because they weren’t going to help.
He was the master, not it, he was the person.
“And if they’ve gone home for the night?”
He hadn’t ever wanted a mate, that was true, but neither would anyone ever have wanted him, beyond the instinctual. It would never have been an issue, or so he’d always thought.
That he had cared and still did care about John and their time together. Enough to remember such things.
John glared at him. Did it
‘Your question, btw – gods, I wish. Don’t really think they’re into guitars much, not even if I try and play it like a violin.’
Sherlock shuddered to think just what her ‘Uncle Jim’ might have hinted at or even outright shown her that she had somehow managed to forget enough to still like him. What children remembered and what they did not was, after all, something of lottery. Not entirely.
A muscle quirked in John’s lip despite himself. Only Sherlock would pair ‘plain’ and ‘pandemonium’ like that, though the latter was quite…fanciful for the man, too.
“If you’re determined to be an idiot – “
Not that he wouldn’t do everything in his power to make sure this proposal went off as well and as smoothly as possible so that John would see it for what it was and would be happy to accept. But if it…if it failed, then – he fought the still too-horrible thought but this time, fought to keep it in his mind rather than out of it – then he shouldn’t be…be…
But where to go? They obviously each hair their own bedroom they could go to but that felt incredibly and entirely wrong, after they both had admitted that they loved each other. After they’d
Part of the brunet froze at that implication because John had promised to stay close by and yet, despite that, he’d been –
“You will tell me?”
“John, please.”
John swallowed, feeling the tips press deeper as he did so. They didn’t stop once the swallow was over, pressing unerringly deeper but still without piercing skin.
He looked amused and yet…disappointed? No, not quite that. But there was the sense that he’d expected differently from John.
That said, the ‘obviously’ that was left out of the end of that sentence was clearly heard, regardless.
"We are,” he agreed, “and I trust that you’re going to tell me when and if you can. I do, Sherlock, truly. But if you’ll force yourself to do when you’re not ready for it, then…”
“Either Holmes-Watson or Watson-Holmes would be fine,” Sherlock said, tone lofty as he addressed his brother, drawing his mate closer, “or keeping to Watson. The point is that whichever he chooses, the decision will be John’s.”
“Was that your plan from the off, then?” John continued, completely ignoring, or possibly not hearing, Sherlock’s utterance of his name. “To just get this whole thing over with and then disappear, stringing me along in the process?”
Granted, John wouldn’t be giving birth to the twins for months yet and even then, they would hardly be in a position for much mobility for some months after that.
Even so, he tried to will his fingers to move faster. They were almost there; the bonds, which had gone over and across the vest at certain places, were gone and he was working on the vest itself.
Sherlock saw Mycroft give John the once-over, which was clearly more for show than any collecting of information. He would’ve deduced everything already, from the time they’d been on stage, with perhaps only the importance John held to Sherlock being withheld from him at that time, and even that was unlikely, given the looks they’d shared up there.
The end result was that he stayed exactly where he was, unable to find out what he was to do or even how to phrase what he wanted, needed, to say. Which was ridiculous and pathetic and beyond unhelpful.
To be perfectly honest, part of the delay has been because I haven't been sure i should post it. See, I'm a little ahead, actually, but there's a lot of speculation in all of it, just like here, and...yeah, scared of boring you half to death, really. Of course, I could cut it but I'm afraid of cutting something I don't remember using as a point later.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock slowly started to shake and for a moment, John thought that he was going to cry. That would be alright, of course. In fact, though it would be the first time he could remember his friend actually genuinely crying, it would be beneficial for him, to get some sort of proper outlet.
For now, though, he was enjoying the moment.
Who was he to rob her of that? Her mother, obviously, yes, but so what?
he whispered, sounding pained and more than a little lost. “I don’t know.”
Once in the kitchen, Sherlock flopped down onto a chair. He looked…almost despondent which was somehow just as off and unsettling as the possessiveness and the anger he’d displayed when the dragon had been in control.
But the sweet dorkiness of the look, freed from the airs and shields he put on while awake, brought home what Mycroft had talked about. That what mattered was how John felt, how they both felt, when they stripped away the dragon and all its mess.
“Yes, of course I was,” John shouted, just to be sure that he was heard, too. “That’s what hu – what people do.”
Now that he had her within his grasp, metaphorically and literally, had confirmed for himself not only that it was indeed Tessa, his daughter, whatever name she otherwise had, but that she recognised him in turn, he was just going to, to
His previous life, and not necessarily purely in relation to the drugs, seemed like something that had happened to someone else, and when he looked back on it, he couldn’t seem to find much, if anything from it that he missed.
No, man. Whatever else he was, he was still a person. A man, even if he were a dragon, and – and pronouns and classifications really weren’t something to think about right then. So of course he’d been unable to get it out of his mind even as he jotted the details of Mycroft’s suggestion, his plan down.
Not that anything had been broken between them or needed fixing and yet…
“Sorry about that,” John said, sitting up straight in something of a hurry.
“…Thank you, love.” It came out softly and quietly.
Oh, for – and now his mind was running off without him, too. As though this wasn’t frustrating enough.
He grabbed the guitar he’d brought, which he’d momentarily leaned against the shed wall, in his left hand, his dominant hand. Then he dug into his uniform trouser pocket and fished out a couple of pieces of paper, neatly folded. He held them out to the other teen.
He couldn’t see.
“Celeste,” cried the woman and it was a cry in both senses of the word, the sob tearing itself out of her throat at the same time as the words. If she had been able, she undoubtedly would have reached out a hand, imploringly.
John didn’t even need to look behind him at his partner to know he was smiling to the point where calling it a smirk would be far more appropriate. It did after all mean that he’d been right in his prediction, and John had been wrong.
John looked her over as he came closer, his heart sinking gradually lower in his chest the more he took in. While some of her appearance could be explained by the general appearance many patients acquired while sick in a hospital, most of it could not.
Doesn’t count when he had something to guide him, does it?”
“Thank you,” John said, his voice getting a little bit strangled and his eyes shining brighter still in the light that managed to slip into the room. “Can you accept that I feel the same?”
“Sherlock was, as many other children are when they are born, given a plush toy. That toy was an otter, handpicked by our uncle. When he became old enough to register things, it became his absolutely favourite toy.”
“It doesn’t,” he said, looking away. He didn’t particularly want to see what expression the bafflement morphed into.
“No, he was genuinely not expecting the two people he knew, and has known for a long time, too, to do this. Especially not to harm his wife and himself.”
“Right,” he continued, “let’s see what the damage is then.”
Because he still had his eyes closed so very tightly, he didn’t notice that a few tears had begun to escape his eyes and trickle down his cheeks.
Since it was late, that wasn’t a given. On the other hand, if Mycroft knew that she was awake, someone must’ve informed him, and it was hardly likely to have been any of the nurses that made the call, their authority not stretching that far. So, someone of sufficient standing would’ve looked at her, especially likely given the observation she’d been under since her admission.
“I’m not having any wedding reception until after I can fit into a regular suit that doesn’t have to be altered to fit me or come from the maternity section in any way, and that’s final.”
“What?” Sherlock frowned a little in sudden puzzlement. “John, that’s not – “
“Something along those lines, yes.” It felt as though more words were pressing against the Alpha’s lips, but he wasn’t letting them past.
with them.
His nostrils kicked into gear and calmed him down somewhat by informing him that they couldn’t smell any fresh blood from John, so even if he had been hit, somewhere he wouldn’t immediately notice, it wasn’t anything severe enough to be a risk factor.
To be fair to him, though, there were still quite a few things he didn’t know or had deleted about the intricacies of bonds and while he had worked hard to regain as much as he good while he’d been bonded to John, there were still areas where he had to work at it, harder than most people.
If he
He looked up from his position on one of the chairs for what ought to have been a dining table but was in reality mostly another landscape of papers, books and miscellaneous detritus, though thankfully nothing edible, or what once had been edible, among it.
Even in his own mind, thinking to himself, he sounded just slightly pleading, slightly desperate.
“I’ve already got one. A very important one that I’m afraid will take all my attention for its duration.”
That made even less sense.
Thirdly, undoubtedly at least partially the result of the change in teachers, the school play had been changed. Miss Wilkins couldn’t manage the whole menagerie as she normally did and so, she’d decided to make it into more of a sort of showcase of talents, combining music with English.
Yes. It no doubt was, much as that hurt to realise, let alone admit. The indignance was born of hurt, too, but John was well within his rights, for lack of a better term, to show some disbelief at what was happening in front of him.
It was gone as soon as Sherlock noticed it but even for that split-second, his heart sank low enough to jostle his intestines and his entire body turned cold. He thought he felt something shift and rumble deep inside him and although that was gone in a fraction of that split-second, it was still enough to have the rest of him sit up and look around like a highly nervous dog.
He still couldn’t quite help at least running his finger across it a few times, just to reassure himself that it was there. That he was doing what he’d set out to do and this was real rather than a dream. It somewhat felt like a dream to him, still, but then again, in his more…fanciful moments, sometimes this whole relationship could.
The military had been close living with no chance of more private spaces, at least within barracks and for more than half an hour, at most. But while it had been close, for many closer than they ever got emotionally to their own family, it hadn’t been…at the very least, he could say that they hadn’t all been emotionally close or intimate. There were things you just didn’t talk about or show and as importantly, they had been able to
After having turned him, though, Sherlock didn’t attempt to pull him in further or otherwise manhandle him. Instead, he let him be, and stood two feet away from him.
It had actually been surprisingly easy. John had brought it up, expecting at least some token argument because that would be curtailing something the Alpha did. But Sherlock had just nodded.
Opening eyes he hadn’t realised he’d closed, he looked at John to try and gauge his reaction.
Indifference wasn’t what he felt for John’s little daughter.
“I know that you won’t, Sherlock, and I am not doubting you in the slightest. However, I said both of us and I meant both, too.”
That last thought sent a minute shiver through him.
Was that comforting? Worrying? Both? In equal measures?
But that left a sliver of opportunity for Moriarty to have visited while he had been…otherwise occupied.
Sherlock shook his head, internal pride waving a banner high at John remembering the study, which he had indeed looked at, his reasoning based on it, and not least, his ability to immediately link to the scent bond.
John pulled the other into a quick, but tight hug, hoping that it would help. Well, along with what he said next.
Sherlock frowned but didn’t say anything.
Pretty much, yes.
“It was merely a question of expediency, so you didn’t have to deal with the ogre for longer than necessary, not that I don’t believe you capable – “
But that wasn’t what it entailed, necessarily. It could just as easily be that he did care about John but not in the way he would expect or want. Rather, it would be the care and affection, if such a word could be used, that one bestows on a cherished possession, caring about it for what the object provided them rather than any intrinsic value of its own.
Mycroft looked between them, the eyebrow rising again. He didn’t say anything, however, just inclined his head minutely again, then turned to leave.
Then he would leave. Leave and never come back. Refuse to have anything to do with Sherlock, no matter what he did or what he offered. He wouldn’t expose them or anything like that, but he’d still back out completely.
Just like the brunet had done the other way, more times than the blond could count, even at this relatively early point.
Letting out a noise that couldn’t be quantified, she then sniffed at their still joined hands.
Silence stretched between them, heavy and uncomfortable. John wanted to move, to get out of there and not come back for a while. However, he recognised both why he wanted that and why that wasn’t the way to go.
Despite the seemingly assured manner of his words and his demeanour, there was just a hint of uncertainty in there. Which had been there when he’d brought up what he had to say, too. So, nervous of what he was going to say or more likely, what that would mean and how John would take it.
I haven't forgotten this, I promise! Thank you all for your, admittedly assumed, patience with me and thank you for the feedback on the last chapter. Thank you for sticking with me at all, really <3
“Sorry, but you can’t just dump the knowledge that a mythical being not just exists but happens to be my best friend and now expect me to at least ask some questions.”
Moving faster, lest it be Moriarty and the shit-heel thought of another method of getting through to him if he still didn’t pick up, one that would be far less pleasant than this.
Moriarty. Was it him calling? Not Moriarty. No. Fuck no, not that bloody wanker of a creep again, he’d had
“I know, I know. And they’re growing well, too, according to the doctor and the scans. High end of the curve and everything because of course you couldn’t do things by half, now could you?”
This wasn’t – there was still so much he hadn’t said. Why did the stupid lid have to pop open before he was ready for it to?
The point was that it was here, and it was real, whether he could remember the reason for it or not. Deception and manipulation was a possibility, obviously, but as he concentrated, almost dropping both things in his hand, he could find none of it.
Or maybe he was just stalling for time. Though he knew he ought to, he hadn’t yet given up hope that he would see Sherlock without the dragon again, for more than a second or two, not entirely. He’d tried, hard and several times, but had found that he couldn’t.
“Of course, I’m thinking about you being a bleeding dragon!” John burst out. “That’s like saying ‘Don’t think about the elephant’!”
“No, of course not, or I would’ve recognised the scent of him. But for an Alpha, even an unconventional one like Moriarty, to have another Alpha of relative intelligence as well as brawn, not to mention loyalty, like that, someone he would send to perform an important task like this –”
Sherlock didn’t turn around. He closed his eyes and took another deep breath. Why couldn’t he have let this be easy? Just this one thing to be easy. Was that so much to ask?
The claws had punctured his skin at last when the dragon had woken up and taken over, and the struggles only served to push them deeper. Blood oozed from them, stoppered somewhat by the claws still embedded in them but still seeping thick liquid continuously, staining the pillow and bedsheets underneath him a slowly darkening red.
The lyrics to ‘Hello, who’s your lady friend?’ incongruously flashed past in his head at that.
Sherlock wanted to pull him in, wrap himself back around him and tell him that it was okay, that he’d make it okay, whatever it’d take, if he’d just continue to believe in him.
Had Sherlock hurried him along when he’d needed a moment…ever, really? Not as far as he could recall, no. But specifically in the bedroom of a little girl who they would be,
It looked as though Moriarty was perfectly aware of what Sherlock wanted to do to him and also that he couldn’t do it as things stood. That was what the slight, pursed quirk of lips and the eyebrows raised in challenge suggested, at least, and the glint in dark brown eyes cemented it.
Focus.
To display what kind of person he’d been messing around with.
As he had been with other small things, really. That they stemmed from a desire to make things like they ought to be rather than purely something that Sherlock felt was right.
He was wrong.
“You don’t know that we won’t,” Sherlock argued back, even though he didn’t particularly want to argue. If anything, he wanted to…to have a normal afternoon of both doing small nothings in the living room. Failing that, crawling into the other’s arms and just holding would be wonderful. “I could still try to carry on as I have before. As I always have.”
Sherlock refused to be rattled, though. Not by something like that, at least. Judging by what had been happening since they had landed in France, it was unlikely, highly so, that he wouldn’t be at least rattled if not outright shocked or terrified by something or other in all of this.
Try to, anyway, because John grabbed hold of her as well with one hand, the muscles of his arm tensing hard. The other finished its movement, grabbed the hilt of the knife firmly, and pulled it out in a quick, fluid, practiced motion.
“John?” he asked, tentative and puzzled, not understanding what was going on. That wasn’t to say he didn’t have a wish for what it might be, but he also knew where his wishful thinking landed him, and that was never anywhere good.
“Sherlock? Love? What’s the matter?”
They stayed like that for a long while, just needing the calm, the reassurance and the security that it brought. It wasn’t even just what had happened between Sherlock leaving and returning, either, as residue of what had gone before that, which had accumulated like the sea depositing sand or the build-up of stalactites over time, played a great part in it, too, for them both.
How could he think to jeopardise that with proposing? It wasn’t as though it was strictly
John snarled in turn. “All of this, this absolutely horse hockey of a case, you build all of this up, kill those people for no good goddamned reason – and then you don’t even have the bleeding stones to carry it through! I’m nothing special, I’m not interesting, just go ahead already and blow my brains out!”
Thank you for all the understanding from people in the comments, that was very kind. <3
“That’s…thank you, Mycroft,” he repeated as he looked back up, with more genuine feeling than before. “That’s incredibly thoughtful of you.” He smiled.
There didn’t seem to be anything to indicate it, as far as he could tell with his eyes and the one hand that he had free. The other was trapped beneath the weight of one consulting detective who’d apparently decided that mattresses weren’t for him and that John was much better to lie on.
To say that there was a very great risk that he’d be dropped, or the brunet would collapse with John on top of him. Neither scenario was appealing, obviously, and the likelihood of that happening should he attempt seemed assured. For crying out loud, the man was swaying where he stood.
“Yeah, ‘course it does. Or I assume so, but maybe there’s something else at play, too. I really don’t know, love, I’m not a dragon, and even if I were or otherwise knew, I’m far too knackered right now to think about anything.”
Jim’, after all – though he’d focused more on the ‘Jim’ part when she’d spoken, she had used both, even if it had been in French – and even though Sherlock wasn’t an expert at getting relations between people right, ‘uncle’ implied a degree of closeness but also a degree of distance at the same time.
Whether she understood was of course another matter altogether.
Mycroft watched this without comment but with more than his usual keen eye.
There was indeed no indication of ice in the pale eyes nor anything else that he would classify as being dragon signs.
Even with the pull of the scent bond, he could’ve decided to merely have it dissolved, however that would work. Or he could’ve kept it at that, refusing to bond with John further. Insisted the Omega had an abort-
Such dragons were unstable, to put it mildly, and while he highly doubted that was the reason for Moriarty’s behaviour – for one thing, it would be incredibly pat and dull, two words that didn’t stick with Moriarty at all – it made his interest in John even more undesirable.
“You forget that while he didn’t exactly sleep, he was unconscious for a while, a while in which you were conscious and trying to cope,” Mycroft pointed out, quietly.
It had been battered and tested several times already – some might even say constantly – and had emerged whole, more or less, on the other side. Not by accident, either, and they had got progressively better.
Had he had the thought to spare for it, he might’ve expected her to resist him or at least struggle, still screaming. It would make sense that she would, and that could be any or all of those things.
When John finished recounting what had happened when the Alpha had been, he was shaking. Not hard, not like he had when they’d been discussing the paper Mycroft had gotten. Just a small, barely visible one that could speak for sheer exhaustion as well as being unsettled yet again by what had occurred but more so by the implications of it.
Somehow, though, he managed to stay upright and, shifting his grip on the continually melting remains of the jade statue, reached for the next piece again.
The words ‘you cannot know that it’s her, John, not for certain, not with residual traces like this’ were on the tip of his tongue but he swallowed them down almost vehemently.
And he’d…well, knowing Sherlock, he probably had a pretty good idea of when John would be there, even with the rather meandering path he himself thought he’d taken, but even so, he clearly hadn’t been in the know enough to pop down a minute or two before and just make it look as though he’d been standing there for a long time.
The eyes were still on him, though, even from the somewhat awkward position, and so made contact almost the moment he opened his own, boring into him.
Ridiculous or not, though, he wasn’t going to define himself that way. Nor did he believe he had, though he might of course be wrong on that score. It wasn’t as though he hadn’t been before, was it? Regardless, he wouldn’t be doing it going forward.
‘But no sign of him? No sounds of wings flapping or something.’
Tessa finally gets to meet her biological mother.
He didn’t want to let John know that he was struggling with that, but he probably ought to. If they were indeed in this together, it would be beyond stupid to keep that to himself, even if he very much wanted to. He knew they had just discussed the notion of him becoming a bad father, which John had adamantly refused, but that didn’t mean it couldn’t be brought up, now did it?
in love you with you, yes, and I’ll say it as many times as you need for it to sink in and stay in there. Or not, if that’s what you’d prefer.”
The doctor dug into the box, taking out whatever he thought would be necessary to administer aid. Once he was done, he left it there for the moment as he walked around the coffee table to get to the brunet’s back.
Of course, that wasn’t to say it then followed Moriarty
The reason he stopped was external; his eye had been caught by something in a shop window and his heart had in response done a complicated move that was somewhere between a thudding drop and a pirouette gone wrong.
Should he mention the clear cold the other was experiencing? No, best not. It wasn’t as though the Alpha wouldn’t be aware of it, however much he was pretending not to be, and there was unquestionable an explanation. There might even be a good one.
On the fear, he knew it to be fear even before he’d got it out to see, that was a marble egg, unusually large and black and streaked. It struck him as odd, even more so than the gun and in particular the jade statue, because it seemed not only useless but exceeding boring, too.
John couldn’t help wondering, even knowing it was completely irrelevant. So was the small amount of admiration for being able to apparently coherently type something on a phone keyboard while simultaneously delivering a lengthy explanation. Then again, he was Sherlock’s brother, wasn’t he?
And yet, Sherlock found himself looking at everything he possibly could, even faster than he normally did, to try and get a gauge on whether something was amiss, putting his other senses to use as well.
, Sherlock thought but didn’t voice out loud. It wasn’t as though they didn’t both already know that.
No, that wouldn’t work. Not only would that like as not be seen by the doctor as admitting guilt, however he swung it to convince him otherwise – and when did John become that well-versed in his little trick? Or was Sherlock ascribing more astuteness to him than warranted? – he wouldn’t accept it, and especially not from Sherlock.
Still, though, it was quite bad enough, and Sherlock’s hackles rose instantly the moment he smelled it. More than that, and far stronger than that, thankfully, did his protective instincts and concern for John’s wellbeing. They still weren’t conducive to keeping a clear and rational mind, of course, but at least the clouded judgment came from a much healthier place, then.
He knew they’d need picking up sooner or later, the cab driver called to them, coming to a stop.
“Yes.”
John kissed…it wasn’t fair to say he kissed passively or hesitantly. There was real passion there, it would be difficult if not downright impossible to deny it, but it was cushioned with a care that Sherlock wouldn’t have expected. As though he was afraid to break something or…or scare Sherlock off.
If he needed to, he could use something that belonged to John as a form of dowsing wand to locate him. It was rare that he did need to, however, and it had dwindled in occurrences steadily in the time they’d lived together. He’d much rather not need it, for several reasons, but he’d learned to his cost that relying on his skills alone without the object as a backup was a foolhardy idea.
being in a warzone. But maybe it had more to do with the blood itself than the bearer.
“Kindly refrain from dismissing your emotions or need for them like that.” There was a sharpness to his voice that even Sherlock himself was a little surprised by. “As for deductions, I have already made several. One or two of them are even to do with Moriarty.”
Those contradictory actions had been odd but then, when he’d seen the man, sauntering quietly towards him, they paled in comparison.
So, it was more accurate to say that their roles had been reversed this time around. Which was good and fair and part of the point, he knew that, wanting to show John that he meant this and was willing to put himself in the vulnerable position, too. But it didn’t do anything to make the uncertainty and second guessing any easier to bear.
“What?”
John was back to grinning. “Novice? What, a bit of an expert in the field, are you?”
Thank you all!
But that was it, wasn’t it? They couldn’t actually do without him. Not if they wanted to be sure that it was the right girl that they brought back with them, in any case, which was rather the important thing.
Actually, rather kind, really. There certainly seemed to have been very little of the pettiness one might expect to see in such a situation, one sibling warning a potential partner about the other sibling.
‘Why on earth would I want that? – SH’
Was a greater man, too, not in spite of the flaws he had but because of them. Someone who had been if not the anchor then at least the weight on the other scale for John as his life spiralled ever downward and had been able to benefit from the doctor as John had from him.
“Perhaps he is trying to woo you himself.”
Oh, but it felt wonderful, to have his thoughts and worries drain away into the white nothing that seemed to come ever closer. So very lovely and comforting. Perhaps it wouldn’t be so bad, really…
In the end, he decided against it. Why exactly he did, he wasn’t able to say.
It hit him hard, which he hadn’t expected. Nor had he expected the awareness to come at this time. If he’d expected anything at all, it would’ve been for it to happen when they’d first ventured out, really, the first real meeting with humdrum, everyday life after his sequestered life.
what he treasured.
Once satisfied he’d located all injuries and assessed them in turn, he passed on to the next wing, giving it an equal amount of attention and care. However, he didn’t speak out loud during the examination, keeping whatever observations he made to himself, and Sherlock didn’t quite trust his voice right then, either.
Then John looked up at him and beckoned him down with his eyes rather than through verbal means.
“Don’t try me, Omega,” the Alpha said, the humour in his eyes replaced with simmering disdain and contempt. They were not dominant, but they were certainly visible now.
A shiver ran through the brunet, from the back of his neck all the way down his spine, leaving tingling warmth in its wake.
“I never would. I promise,” he said, trying for as much earnestness as he could, because it was true, and he needed to be sure that John believed him on that score. It was imperative. “I love you. I should have said before this, I know – “
“John, you’re not to blame for this.” He tightened the grip on his hands. “None of it. If it’s anyone’s fault, it’s mine. I will not have you blaming yourself for something that only got started because of me.”
“Right. Of course, it would be. Sherlock? No, Sherlock, stay with me. Stay with me. That’s it. Come on, just listen to my voice, okay? Stay with me now, keep those eyes open for me.”
Was there a bit of colour to the cheeks? Why?
“There aren’t any others.” They didn’t see John’s worth.
Her eyes followed him.
“I…I didn’t mean…” he faltered and paused, closing his eyes briefly before trying again, with determination. “I want you to work, John, if that’s what
But even without the smell, it was not a sight that said much of anything good about dragons in general or Sherlock in particular.
Actors kept a distance from the audience when working onstage so as not to give away that the feelings they displayed weren’t true. Something which an audience would always pick up on if they were close enough to scent the actors and it would always ruin the whole production as audience members talked about lacklustre performances and unconvincing actors.
Sherlock huffed, or tried to. It would’ve worked a whole lot better if his eyes weren’t still rather dilated and his cheeks lightly flushed in a way that had nothing to do with remnants of sleep.
In case someone like them showed up, too, Sherlock supposed, at least from the point of view of her…her
Just the thought that he’d get to see that, watch the Alpha age, and grow old with him as a bonded pair, almost filled his heart to bursting.
They got the poor thing through with dignity, and guts, relatively intact.
The two hands, one lifting quickly with a metallic glint that Sherlock could see and Tessa couldn’t, while the other, small and blemish free, slid surprisingly smoothly, almost nonchalantly, out of the inside of the jacket.
Sherlock’s eyes went wide even as his muscles relaxed on him and his heart rose in his chest.
“Dragon equivalent, obviously.”
There was a part of him that didn’t want to touch the money that had even the slightest to do with Moriarty because who knew where they’d been acquired? Then again, it was a bit late in the game to begin worrying about that sort of thing, wasn’t it? Hypocritical if he did, in any case.
“I think you ought to leave,” ‘John’ said, speaking directly into the brunet’s ear. Not that it mattered much, as the dragon wasn’t paying attention to them, not right then.
Well, that was something. And he’d made it through the…day? Day. He’d made it through the day sleeping without being eaten or claimed. Right?
“Now you’re just being incredibly pedantic for the sake of winning the argument.”
Alright. The table was first priority, quite obviously, and then he would have to work outwards from there, in the hope that it was at least in the living room. It had to be somewhere in the flat, but it would be easier if it were in the living room.
Then his brain kicked in and informed him that though the speech could’ve been with Moriarty, too, this was Mycroft’s voice, clipped in its Englishness, with no hint of a lilt.
“Yes.”
“Yeah, I’m not really keen on him upping the ante, either.” He didn’t even want to think about it; just the knowledge of what damage he’d managed to cause until now was hard enough to deal with.
“You do.”
“Yes…” Sherlock admitted, a little reluctantly. “Well, one of the possible reasons.”
But that wasn’t how it came out. It came out quiet and, though not exactly small…defeated, somehow. It was the vocal equivalent of shoulders sagging down suddenly and heavily.
those, or they shouldn’t have manifested yet. Because you’re right, I do know all of that. All of it and you know what? It doesn’t make a blind bit of difference. I still feel as though I’ve failed them because however unreasonable it is to say otherwise, I have. And I can’t do shite about it because they’re some bastard’s property in all but monetary transaction and that’s still how the actuality of the law works.”
Moriarty and the harem were connected to previously established work and while this technically was connected to the harem, too, it was different.
“Yeah, ta for that. Like I need reminding. The bloody loon called me earlier and made that point rather clear, didn’t he? What I
Staring, unseeing, at the display in front of him for what felt like ages but, in reality, was no more than a few minutes at most, John came to the decision to go back to Baker Street.
Nor was it as though there were Alpha psychopaths and such in every class or every battalion. There was a significantly higher concentration of the messed-up ones among the owners and punters of the harem, of course, but that came with the territory.
I know this feels like a jumble of several different, smaller points but it is a 7k chapter and I hope it also feels as though we're progressing, both in story and in character. I don't know, this felt nice to write, somehow.
After a moment or two of that, he tilted his head and began to slowly part his lips, carefully cataloguing each and every reaction he got from the doctor, both good and bad. If there was something which he was uncomfortable with, Sherlock wanted to know, likewise if some action triggered a memory of something.
“Fair point. It’s been a little bit longer than ‘just now’, mind, but…and I’m smiling because of this, mainly.”
One or two of them he knew the origin of, but that was mainly because he recognised them from one case or another. Telling his friend that he couldn’t steal said items and would have to put them back was met with a complete lack of care, the kind that cats were so good at that, the I-know-it-bothers-you one.
alone anymore, and he didn’t have to function and take precautions as though he was. That thought was still enough to rather floor him, he had to admit.
Most of all, though, his protective instincts made him almost suffocate the poor girl, though she clung just as hard to him, her face buried in his shoulder.
“I’m allowed...well, no, not really, but I’m going to be an idiot as much as anyone, love.”
“It’s not that I don’t understand – “John began but Sherlock shook his head.
To Sherlock, it was also time for another marking of the year. One that had an almost complete overlap with the one celebrated by everybody else, as that was sort of inevitable, really, but was infinitely more important to the consulting detective than anything that had to do with births of saviours or fat men in furry lobster costumes going down far too small chimneys.
“And just as big pains in the arse as each other, yes. Anyway, regardless of what crap you put your body through, I can’t keep up with it indefinitely. Nor can you, it seems. I promise we can pick up as many arguments as you like later on. But not now.”
Even the Alpha in the doorway seemed to pick up on it because when John looked back up at him, he was grinning again.
“John.”
If it was for a joke or a dare, it was far too long. A peck should be enough for that, or he’d employ tongue. Except John wouldn’t do that. He knew he wouldn’t.
(See the end of the chapter for
“People can be possessive without it having anything to do with instincts, whether they’re Alphas or not,” he pointed out, but gently so. For whose benefit that gentleness was, exactly, he wasn’t entirely sure. “And I’m not stupid enough to think that there couldn’t be an element of that in it. I just…”
It was more of a peck than anything else, to be honest, but it was entirely of his own volition and under his own steam, which he hoped would count for something.
Then there was the fact that he’d written his number down, he remembered to and made time for it, despite evidently being in a hurry. Which didn’t mean that he just wanted anyone to play with him, did it? Why remember that if you would be fine with whichever? Why go to the trouble of having the sheet music printed?
If his doctor could do that, then Sherlock could bear the uncertainty and more besides without complaint or wish to make it easier to him.
Sherlock couldn’t help but wish for the presence of his figment John again, as a help and anchor inside his mind. It was only for a moment, though, as he knew why he wasn’t there.
Only to falter when he saw who had actually been the one to touch him.
The transformation was oddly slow; the index finger gradually began to bulk up at the same time as scales began to cover it one at a time, the copper colour made clear against the paleness of the rest of the hand. Meanwhile, the nail blackened and seemed to thicken, too, into something resembling almost a carapace but one made of keratin rather than chitin. Then it stretched into the length and curve that John remembered and for a moment, he had to suppress a hard shiver.
John firmly ignored the slightly acerbic comments in his mind and got in line. There were three people in front of him. At least, there started out being three.
That she clearly did understand him and was able to answer, for an admittedly given value of answering, gave him some hope. It was modulated and somewhat frail, but it was there. It was born of the knowledge that within the first few hours, it was difficult and fraught with inaccuracy at this state to judge the state people were in, in cases like this, and the fact that even so, even at this early point, her mind was working well enough for her to speak understandable sentences, if somewhat short and simplistic, rather than mostly gibberish.
Would he prefer it if his plan went off without a stumble or hitch? Yes, of course, and he would probably also think his idea at least a little better than John’s, wrong as he knew that to be. But that wasn’t the point of this.
It was a small mercy that John was behind him, at least for the moment.
“John?”
Thank you.”
Ruby has woken up from her coma and John and Sherlock go visit her. To see what state the drug-induced coma has left her in.
And he wasn’t done, either.
Thank you,” he said, equally quiet, equally earnest. “That…thank you so much.”
