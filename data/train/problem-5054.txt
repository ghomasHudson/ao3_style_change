As the last passengers left the cabin, Dean saw Castiel slowly step up behind Balthazar, whose turn it was to bid farewell to their guests today. Of course the angel-named man knew who the last one to leave the plane was going to be. It had almost become tradition by now, after all.
"You there," he didn't waste any time when he picked up on the second ring.
Walking was a funny affair, afterwards. Funny at least for Dean's brother Sam, who, despite the other Winchester's misery, couldn't help the snorts that escaped him as he watched Dean take step after careful step back to the Impala after the job was done. Try walking without bothering your body's most precious possession if you are a man and have just been kicked into said possession.
"I'm sure you'd get by perfectly well, but I'm happy to help and to be needed."
He didn't know how it happened, or when. How long they had been standing there, or who moved first. He didn't care either.
Dean was aware that he'd have to have a talk about that with Cas, and soon. But did he really want to? Did he really want to know where this was going to lead to, also? Did he want to face to possibility that they'd have to accept they had failed at making this work, even after Dean's passionate speech about how they'd manage? And most of all, did he want to waste only one minute of their precious time together for such an unpleasant conversation?
The hotel entrance came in sight much too soon for Dean's taste, and before they could enter, he stopped them.
"You know," Charlie, sitting next to him and powering up the game console, suddenly spoke again, "maybe you don't have the right groove yet. I don't mean that as an accusation or something. I just mean... you've never been in that kind of relationship, and from what I gather, nor has Cas. It's new to the both of you."
"I thought you had already put it in your hand luggage?" came the muffled reply from the bathroom, and Dean smiled when he heard water splashing and then a high-pitched, happy squeal.
"I wouldn't be so sure." And indeed, much to Dean's confusion, the baby girl looked at both her fathers with huge, questioning eyes. It was a little staring contest that ensued, one which seemed to have Mary waiting for an explanation - or at least that's the strange feeling that befell Dean. She couldn't possibly... Nah, it was stupid.
Conversation was easy, and questions exchanged to get to know the other better.
"Little Cassie's smitten with a passenger, after all, huh? I knew it," the older man teased instead of answering, and Castiel rolled his eyes, shooting first Balthazar and then Gabriel, who had come to stand a few feet away from them and snickered quietly, a dirty look.
Snapping his luggage - a suitcase small enough to fit into the overhead lockers - he left the plane, waving and calling a goodbye to Gabriel and Balthazar. It was time to go home. Or at least go to his makeshift home that was the hotel he always stayed at in San Francisco. But wherever it was, he just wanted to get some rest, and his weekend started.
"You're not the short term guy. I get that," Paul interrupted him, once more closing the distance between them, his arms winding around Castiel's body in a way the flight attendant actually craved. It made him feel safe. Home. Loved. it only it had been the right guy... "But don't worry, handsome. There's nothing shameful about it. I'll make it good for you. And I don't expect anything in return." Letting his hands wander up and down Cas' back with soft massaging movements, he added, "I'll be more than happy to know those muscles are a bit relaxed afterwards."
By the time he was done, they were sitting on the bed, turned towards each other, and Dean was gently playing with the fingers of Castiel's left hand, caressing and massaging them as he listened intently. The flight attendant was sure that the light physical contact was meant to reassure him, to let him know that his lover was still with him. He smiled a silent thanks when, after he finished talking, Dean remained quiet for a little while longer, only lifted Cas' hand and tenderly kissed his palm.
No. No no no
Why couldn't people travel like it had once been God-given to them? By car? Granted, cars took a little longer and posed a few minor problems when it came to crossing oceans, but still. At least one had both feet - or four wheels in that case - securely on the ground.
Even their goodbyes were cut short when the pilot, some Michael Archer or something, if Dean remembered correctly, demanded Cas' presence and the flight attendant had to leave the farewell wishing to one of his colleagues. The look the slim man with the heavy British accent gave him had Dean ponder on for quite a while after he had long left the airport.
The last thing Dean saw was Castiel's contently smiling face.
The problem was, though, that Dean may have been happy to be back on the ground; but he also actually yearned to go back on board. Not because he wanted to be on a plane, and definitely not because he wanted to be up in the air. But this metal contraption held a person he really wanted to see again, as soon as possible - preferably
"It's been twenty minutes, mister, and I am
"Dean? Where're you goin'?"
Yes, their situation was unique, as Charlie had said, evidently so, since no couple he knew, or had ever met, had to live like this - apart from each other for long periods of time, sometimes so long that Dean feared one of these days he had to rely solely on his heart to recognize Cas, because his eyes had forgotten him.
"Let's go for that drive, 'kay?"
But then, Dean was still here, wasn't he?
"Uh... did we miss something?"
"Still here. So, Castiel. Be the best version of yourself. Something tells me he deserves it," she said, rare seriousness in her voice, for once not the little teasing sister, but the friend who talked to him as an equal. Dean responded in kind, sounding strong and confident as he did.
"You kissed, Cassie. Yet here he is, chatting up the next pretty lady that happens to be in his orbit," Balthazar argued, opening a few of the cabinets, looking for something. "Now where the hell is the pepper again?!"
Being apart so often though - that was anything but perfect. It meant wistful longing up to a point where it didn't make the relationship more interesting, as people around him likes to claim when they heard of his misery, and emphasized the bedroom side of things especially. Instead this was the kind of missing someone that meant when they finally saw each other, they didn't spend the time having wild sex; sometimes they just savored the minutes they were together, holding each other, sharing meals, taking walks. Sure, it also included making love, and yes, it
Rolling out of the bed, his feet found his slippers, and he breathed out a sigh of relief when his frozen toes were engulfed in the little felt cave.
"Good. Spent yesterday with Sammy and Jess, we went to the beach. Not warm enough for swimming, but at least for a bit of volleyball and a huge bowl of ice-cream afterwards," Dean grinned, the memory bringing back the taste of unusual flavors onto his tongue. "Yours?"
- in the first place. "I... uh... I was just..."
With his bag in hand, Dean maneuvered around suitcases and people alike as he walked the well-known way towards the airport exit. It was time to start his day, and his week; the office was probably already expecting him.
"Um... just a beer, thanks," he told the barkeeper, who gave him such an intense once-over that Cas was inclined to grab his clothes, just in case the look made them vanish suddenly.
It was Balthazar who greeted the passengers this Friday evening, and while he cheerfully welcomed everyone aboard, he narrowed his eyes at Dean.
Gas-N-Sip???
With a cheerful "Tadaa!" he eventually had the object that was now easily identified as a muffin freed and held it under the other man's nose. Carefully Castiel sniffed, before he stuck out his tongue and licked.
"Have you seen that guy? Let me tell you, Cassie, he's one for flings, I know these types--"
"Put your phone on speaker and place it next to you. Close your eyes." Not even a word came as reply then; a humming sound was the only affirmation. Dean lowered his voice and followed his own instructions by closing his eyes so he'd be better able to imagine being with Cas. "I'm there, Cas," he spoke, slow and soft, "I'm right there with you. And when you let your hands touch your chest now, it'll be my hands caressing you." He waited another few seconds, before inquiring, in an almost-whisper, "What are my hands doing, Cas?" He heard the intake of breath, the attempt to speak, but his lover took a moment to mobilize his voice again.
, actually. Stumbling back, he let Cas enter the apartment, though he didn't pay much attention to what his lover did as he quickly sought something to sit down on. Cas quit. He ended it. He was done with...
"Why do you think something's up?"
Dean rested his forehead against Cas' and reluctantly pulled away his hand from where it had found a place at the back of the angel's neck to brush away a tear.
The flight attendant didn't mind the effort one bit.
No, surely Cas was nothing special, seeing as all this didn't apply to him.
Silence answered him, and when Castiel managed to open his eyes he hadn't even noticed closing he was met by a look he could only identify as worried.
Now he and Cas used it to protect themselves from the soaked wood of the bench as they took a seat on it, bodies tentatively touching with their shoulders and legs pressed together.
And then he was flying. Felt the wind beneath his wings, how it tickled his feathers, how the air masses moved around his body and carried him in their welcoming arms to keep him up there, above everything where he was just a spectator, an observer of the world without being part of it, without having to worry about anything in it.
"Done for the day?"
"Of course I do."
It had hit him after they had hung up last night; what they had done, and how he, Castiel, had been lying on that bed in a hotel room, one he hadn't locked or marked with the 'Do not disturb' sign, one he hadn't even drawn the curtains on, and that he had been naked and fully aroused, touching himself, pleasuring himself, under the guidance of someone who was several hundred miles away.
It was, unsurprisingly, the hotel their feet carried them to. After a quick look around when they entered the entrance hall, they slipped past the reception desk and into the elevator quickly, riding up to the eight floor in a comfortable silence. But when they finally came to stand in front of Cas' room, the quiet became slightly awkward. Where to go from here? Would they part ways now? Would they continue to meet like this? Was there even a--
Lost were words on Dean - and on Cas, apparently, seeing as the man next to him just stared ahead. The smile that adorned his lips was reflected in his eyes, and it made him to Dean the most beautiful person he had ever seen. There was so much happiness in his eyes, happiness that matched Dean's own. And now he only wondered why they had waited so long to do this... if one could call the two weeks since they first talked a long time. They certainly felt like it to Dean.
Domestic flights weren't a dream job, not when it came to work within air travel business and one's desire to see the world. But, as he knew, there were also worse occupations to be had, and Castiel wasn't all that bothered that he was able to stay in known territories, so to speak.
"I got kicked in the balls, Sammy, not knifed in the kidney."
When he was finished, Castiel felt as if a huge weight had been lifted off him. It felt good to just say it, to put into words what he had been carrying with him for months. The depth of his feelings for Dean had only grown with every day, every time they saw each other, until he realized that he didn't want to waste that chance, however small it may ever be. In his thirty-odd years, Castiel had never loved, never felt the way he felt for Dean now. How could he ever let that go without giving it every chance it could get? Castiel wasn't a brave man, by any standards; most of his life he'd gone for the safe way, the one he knew he wouldn't risk too much on. He could have been a pilot, as it had always been his dream, but flight attendant had been the safer option. He could have worked harder and risked more, gotten into intercontinental flights a lot sooner, but he rather had a secure job than what he had always wanted.
"I am, yes."
And then surely Dean Winchester wasn't in love either.
"Why didn't you come to us, to--- to me?" Castiel smiled warmly.
"Check the right desk drawer, if we haven't packed the passport already, it'll be there."
"Impatient," Cas laughed, and kissed his way down Dean's body once more.
"I don't understand why you have to think so little of you, Dean. You're worth so much more than that. I will never hate you. I've been on this Earth for three and a half decades and never did I feel so sure about anything. Not even about my career choice, despite my love for flying. I love you, Dean, and nothing else matters. I'm not an impulsive person, I think things through. You know that. And I've thought long about that decision. It is the right one."
"I just came to ask whether my healing was effective, seeing as it was interrupted. Are your penis and testicles well again?"
Of course he had seen the steward before, had spotted him during the safety demonstration pre take-off. But the man had instructed the rear half of the passenger cabin, and thus had stood behind his seat. Besides, Dean had been too busy to follow the display. You couldn't see and hear that often enough, and you never knew when you needed it.
"Sounds a lot like my meetings at work. Boring, pointless, and a complete waste of time," Dean joked, then took Cas' hand and led them to the bench.
"Everything all right?"
"As I said--" It was his lover's sharp headshake more than his following verbal response that made Castiel stop midsentence then.
Sam, for his part, wasn't too convinced regarding that 'fine' part. Especially not when half an hour later his and Cas' - who had stayed, just in case, despite Dean's protests - research was interrupted by a groan as the older Winchester tried to get up.
"Always glad to be of service. And any time for you, Cas," Dean replied cheerily, and gave a lopsided smile, wondering not for the first time what the hell he was even doing here, flirting with that guy. Not that he didn't think of him as worth it or something, but... as much as Jo's voice in his head demanded him to take action, the dark-haired flight attendant was still just doing his job, so however was he supposed to know whether Cas' interest went any further than business? Yes, of course he was never going to know unless he tried or said something and--
"You want to give Mary away?!" If the sheer horror in Cas' face hadn't been so heartwarming, Dean might have laughed. Instead, he smiled fondly and wrapped his arms around his partner, gently nuzzling his cheek with his nose.
"All right, Dean-o, here's the thing," the chief started, "Cassie want us to stay out of his business, but if the little one is unhappy, it becomes our business as well."
"It is, in fact, an angel name."
He had no idea Cas was such a good kisser.
"Nonsense. You like that guy, more than just a little, everyone can see that, and you deserve to enjoy yourself for a change."
"You're... calling me Cas. I-- why?" And there it was. His confirmation that he had indeed crossed a line. Maybe Castiel was a bit friendlier to him than he was to other passengers - he may or may not have observed their interactions a bit - but that didn't have to mean anything. Some people you just liked more than others. Cashiers at supermarkets also didn't show the same amount of amiability to every customer. Hell, not even Dean himself had it always in him to be as nice to the next client as he had been to the one before, when he had to deal with them. It all depended on sympathies.
It was only a long while later, when they were lying content in each other's arms, that Dean spoke again.
"They don't have any pie.
He ought to think of more things he needed to assure the repeated return of that man.
Now he was a father and, to some extent, a husband - a 24/7 job that required full commitment, no matter what he wanted or was in the mood for. Lucky for him, there was nothing more he wanted than to be with his family, with Cas and with Mary, as much and as often as possible. So nothing about that closeness they shared was worrisome to him, contrary to what some people seemed to try and make him believe.
, let Dean's own arousal grow, and he stroked himself a few quick times in hopes of calming himself down a little. The plan sounded better than the result.
Squinting at Dean in irritation, he wondered, "Why would I ever want to do that?" and found his partner looking at him with a wide-eyed look that told him that apparently neither of them wasn't all that sure about the answer. Even if before, they might have known.
8th Heaven Jetways was a relatively new airline, and while Dean usually would have preferred more established and renowned ones, there were two undeniable advantages to this. For one, they were a lot cheaper than the well-known airlines, still having to make a name for themselves. And two, well, the flight times were much more convenient for his schedule.
"I... I also like to thank you."
"I'm... I'm not sure... I don't want to... to hurt you?" Dean smiled at that, a gentle, reassuring expression that lit up his face and Castiel caught a quick glance of before he closed his eyes automatically upon the other man's face coming close and his lips being claimed again.
"Thank you. You too."
"Dean. I'm not stupid."
"Yes, I know, it's just... it holds too many things of you, and you alone, and it would have reminded me too much that you're not there," Castiel shrugged, and soon found himself in a tight embrace he returned by pressing one hand between Dean's shoulder blades and burying his other in his hair, something he knew his lover liked very much. And indeed was the other man's voice a very contented rumble when he asked,
life - he had made a decision. He had thrown cautions and hesitations and old rules and ways of thinking overboard and done what he should have a long time ago. Life was too short to waste it, to be alone when he didn't have to, to not act on something he had long since become tired of hiding anyways.
"Hey squirrel," the man replied, and was sure he could
"Teasing, Cas!" Dean growled, and the flight attendant caught the words with his mouth as he let it descent upon his lover's. It was a kiss without finesse, sloppy and wet, but neither cared, moving on instinct clouded by desire and the longing to be close in every possible way.
"Shurley," a familiar voice behind him suddenly said, quickly followed by, "hello Dean. What are you doing here?" It was enough to at least stop the man behind the counter stop glaring at him - and it certainly was enough to make Dean blush when he turned around.
"Listen, Paul, I... I'm not sure I--" He was cut off the moment the other man's lips landed on his - and a hand squeezed between them to grab his crotch. The kiss was not the best Castiel had ever had - but not the worst either. The touch that came with it, however, was enough to make him squeak in surprise and take a step back, detaching Paul from him. He wasn't going to deny that his body was reacting to barkeeper's actions, but was that really what he wanted? Some stranger getting him off, only to never be seen again? Even if it was just a handjob, or a blowjob - in Castiel's book it still qualified as one night stand. And that was absolutely the opposite of what he wanted.
With a growing lump in his throat and a stomach continuously dropping Dean watched how Castiel took a deep breath, surely having to work up the courage to say what he wanted to tell him. Well, at least he wasn't unaffected by it, which meant that Dean did have a place in Cas' heart.
For the first time in his life, there was something different about his being with a man: There was no fear. No fear of being spotted, and no worry about judgment. And the cloak of secrecy this jacket had been a symbol for, this reminder of a life he had believed he would have to live, suddenly lost its importance.
"Come on," he said, his voice a conspiratorial whisper, and led them out of the hotel into a thankfully rainless late afternoon. He navigated them through throngs of people, commoners and tourists alike, into a quiet area not far from the hotel; a park of sorts that, for some reason, didn't seem to have attracted the attention of anyone yet. And hopefully it never would, Dean found himself thinking as he looked around the small oasis that presented itself around them in awe.
"So how was your meeting?"
"This gives you directions, business hours and entry fees. I also took the liberty of arranging for a rental car."
Groggily he slumped down on the mattress again, in his arms a mess of soft cloth he shook out halfheartedly over them before falling back into the pillows, already crowding Dean's space by slinging his arm around the older Winchester's middle and curling into his side, one of his legs slung over Dean's, his head landing on the other man's shoulder.
"Now that's a sentence you don't hear too often from the working majority. You wanna stay here or do you want me to walk you back to the hotel?"
As if his mind was ever going to listen to him.
He gave his lover another few minutes, before he decided that there was one last thing he needed to do.
"And he'll keep his promise."
"Oh. Well... um..."
"Business trip to a client that takes you across half the country? What do you do?"
"You really are getting old, Gabe," Balthazar teased meanwhile, good-naturedly, but the bite behind the words was still there. His friend liked showing his rebellious side, Castiel knew.
"No, Dean, that doesn't just happen. Not to you. Not about a concert that's as close to your personal Holy Grail of Music as it'll ever get as long as Led Zep don't reunite properly and with the original crew, which you might only have a chance to see in heaven. Or hell, depending. Oh no, you forgetting
"Can be at the Heaven's Door around seven, I guess. That okay for you?"
Things had changed for them; and not only because of Mary. Arrangements had been made early on so they would see each other more often than only on weekends and on flights twice a week.
now, between him and Cas last.
"I... believe you could call me that."
"Dammit Cas! You can't do things like this!"
The road was still there, as was the sun, the light breeze, and the feeling of freedom. Still, Dean's smile faltered.
Lucky for Sam, he at least didn't let out the indignant squeak Dean did then.
"You absolutely are. But then please admit that this is much more than your usual casual fling. Because, Dean, we both know he is. If this works out, if you actually manage to take this a step, or several, further, you're in for something more than just an eventful night. I hope you know that."
"It's fine, just got a lot on my mind."
"Nope," the other man replied, popping the 'p', and swaggered past his friend, throwing a glance past the dividing curtain. "Apart from telling you that it's the same for your darling passenger."
"Yes, thank you. See you then."
Just when Dean was about to come back with a  witty reply, a droplet hit his forehead - and another one his rose right after.
They weren't yet done when they met again for lunch after Jo had dropped Dean off at his office, or when she picked him up to drive him home to his apartment. But, as the blond woman at some point noted, they also wouldn't get any further as long as his friend didn't even know the flight attendant's name, or had found out if he was available.
"Been makin' that for the last few weeks. 's big enough for the two of us. Not yet done, but'll have to do," came the mumbled reply, which was followed only seconds later by a grumped out and not-quite-awake-anymore, "Now shut up and go back to sleep."
He did, however, learn it a short while later during a private moment in a nameless motel's bathroom: from now on, physical exertion on the pleasurable side was going to make artificial light unnecessary.
"I believe that ship has sailed," Castiel remarked and pushed Balthazar, who was still too close, gently but firmly away. "And I'm not inclined to call it back to the shore."
"I know, but... this is the same thing as with the personal space, you know?"
Because when Dean Winchester fell in love it was, of course, with a blanket stealing angel.
to him?!" Dean asked incredulously, sitting with his legs spread wide on a chair that was standing right next to the door and he had decided to unceremoniously fall into.
'smitten', as his friend had called it, with Dean. Castiel couldn't remember the last time he had met a person he felt comfortable around so immediately. Usually it took him long to warm up to people, to connect to them. He was sure able of being friendly, but it was always on a superficial level. Not that interacting with passengers required anything else - or more, for that matter. That his heart beat that little bit faster after only seeing someone a few times, and actually interacting,
Unless, apparently, it was for Dean Winchester.
have stopped you. But I didn't
What he allowed himself were moments like this one, when he relished in the silence of an empty bath and water gave him the chance to hover above ground, even if it was merely an illusion he willingly succumbed to.
The rose beds were what drew his attention most - there were colors amongst these flowers he'd never seen like this. Not that he could remember. There was red, of course, and yellow and white, but there was also orange, and different shades of pink, and then there were these mixed ones, like...
"This isn't working. I'm really sorry." And then he left as fast as possible.
"Yes. Let's be together. Let's do the whole nine yards. You know, meeting the families and friends, moving in together, arguing about holiday destinations and who does the dishes and brings out the garbage and stuff. Let's make it official."
The thing about heaven was, though -- when the right people were in charge, it had a chance to be good.
"And...?"
"Absolutely."
"And you say my time here is lonely," Castiel teased, locking his hands behind his back and bouncing a little on his feet, before he seemed to remember where he was and quickly adjusted his stance to a more professional one. Dean, however, merely laughed.
And in Dean, a whole different kind of darkness spread.
Frowning, Castiel warned, "Balthazar...," but the man in question dismissed it with a hand wave.
"Uh... yes? You said yours was an actual angel name, your people are called Sky Angels and... well... you're..." Now it was, and this was something that warmed Castiel's heart immensely, for Dean to blush and throw a wide-eyed look at the other man. "You're...
He was greeted by the jingling of the bell above the door, by the smell of coffee, and by--
"We're a couple of dumbasses."
Their little exchange, however, stayed on Dean's mind for a while after that. Of course he didn't plan on hurting Cas; it certainly was the last thing on his mind. Hell, it wasn't on his mind at all. In their short time together, the flight attendant had become important to him in a way he hadn't thought possible. Dean had had relationships - okay, affairs, but still - and enough of them to be familiar with a certain pattern when it came to them. But with Castiel? It was different. He didn't know why, he didn't even really know in what way, but there was something that made this thing with Cas, whatever it was, whether a long-ish affair or a relationship or maybe even more, strangely and still comfortably new. This one he wanted to last. Sure he had wanted the same with his other relationships, but this time... this time he was willing to work for it, and hard. He wouldn't,
He didn't remember when he had ever meant something as much as these words.
Exhaustion may have been prominent in him then, but Castiel still found his way down to the spa area after leaving his suitcase in his room. He'd considered to just shower and go to bed, but next to flying, swimming was his favorite pastime, and the next best thing he knew to achieve a feeling of weightlessness. It was the only other thing that made him believe he was able to defy gravity.
Nodding once, both men turned at the same time; Dean to return to his seat, and Gabriel to resume his work.
about that concert and now you're not here three hours too soon to get on our nerves, but instead are late?"
It was their life in one enormous memory, passing before him, fleeting, and gone.
"Dean?"
Slumping against the nearest wall, Castiel took a deep breath and exhaled slowly through pursed lips.
A slight cough made them part a few seconds later, to discover a smirking Sam who had entered the kitchen.
"Yeah, I know that one, have seen it a few times. Good to know it's recommendable, I keep that in mind he next time I have to get rid of relatives," Dean winked and was rewarded with a smile; something he couldn't get enough of, brilliant and infectious as it was.
"Don't, Balt. Not now. Gabriel is right. We can discuss this later, if we must; but only when we're back on the ground."
"Yeah, it is. Because last I heard, you... you were in Heaven's lockup."
In a tone heavy with meaning, Bobby suddenly said, "You should look inside," and his head nodded towards the entrance of the Gas-N-Sip, "you might find whatcha need."
again." And once again, quiet filled the car. Chancing a glance over at Jo, he found her staring him incredulously, and blinking rapidly in disbelief. If he hadn't been just a tiny bit worried about her reaction - even though he was sure she didn't mind - he would have found the picture hilarious. He was just glad that they had to wait at a red light, so Jo didn't have to pay attention to the road in that moment.
Not many people knew that Dean was bisexual. He was comfortable in his affairs with women, but he had also early on, when he was still a teenager, come to understand that the other side - or his side, in that case - awaited with many interesting subjects as well. His experiences with other men weren't plentiful; but they existed, and they had only affirmed him in his feelings.
"Gimme me a sec, Jo, I'm almost at Sam's," he said by way of an answer, and took a right turn, rolling through the familiar street until he spotted a free space. As soon as he had killed the engine, he picked up his phone he had put on the passenger seat. "Jo?"
Castiel nodded in agreement, the two of them walking out and to the Impala, standing there like it belonged, reflecting the sun beams. And as he slipped behind the wheel, Dean's heart skipped a beat. This was his freedom; this was his Heaven. Driving baby, Cas next to him, and knowing that Sam would be with them after he had lived a happy life with Eileen and their son.
Apart from that, he also found himself curious about the man. There was a mystery woven around him Dean knew was there, but couldn't make sense of. And if nothing else, Dean Winchester really liked mysteries. There were too few of those in the world, even more so now that people made themselves transparent by sharing everything about themselves on the internet. Granted, he didn't know for sure if Castiel didn't do that, too, but something told him that the man was very private, and there'd be a lot to learn about him once one took the effort to do so. But it was going to prove to be a challenge, and that was what intrigued Dean most.
"Hey yourself," he smirked, quickly squeezing the hand his lover had strategically placed on Dean's armrest. It was the only contact they allowed themselves in public; at least in that kind of public that was Cas' workplace. It was also a promise, one he was certain was going to be fulfilled.
"I believe you're talking about the Musée Mécanique?"
"So he got the JM Seal of Approval, I take it?"
, okay? At least fine enough to survive without angelic intervention."
After all, even the universally dreaded 'meeting the family' could be marked with a sign of approval.
"Okay, go over there quickly, and call me back when you've arrived."
Lately passengers had become harder to deal with and to please; even Dean had noticed it, and he felt sympathy for Castiel who oftentimes came back exhausted from his flights with yet another group of unusually difficult flyers. Plus, intercontinental flights were of course much more demanding, what with time zone changes the aircrew had to endure, as well as moody weather that never quite fit the reports and, consequently, the clothes they packed.
Or maybe not.
"I would love that very much." Hearing those words, something
Or at least that was what Castiel desperately tried to make himself believe.
"Hey," he smiled, brushing over and then wrapping his pinky around Castiel's where his hand lay between them.
And forget certain passengers who were about to remain only but a nice thought.
"Balt..."
"Cas? Is everything all right? Do you... is this a bad time, do you want me to--" he began to offer, half turning and pointing at the door, even as his stomach sunk.
"What? Will I-- of course I'll be here, Cas! That's what this is about?!"
Gabriel's voice was an unexpected addition to the discussion; usually he kept out of the other two men's verbal duels. But having had to listen to the whole exchange, he was slowly getting fed up with it. His following comment was nevertheless not only accompanied by an eyeroll, but also a smirk. "You sound like... like... well, you. Seriously, no hen party can be that bad. And I know, I've been to some."
"That's... that's good. I guess."
- the book lying next to it as if he wasn't listening to anything around him at all, but now turned into a vibrating giant shaking with laughter he worked hard - and failed - on suppressing the sounds of.
"I hate waiting," Dean murmured, interrupting Castiel. "I wish you were here with me. And on my flights."
"And I--" He swallowed hard, his voice unexpectedly shaky despite being more than sure of the words, as he continued, "love you. I should have told you sooner, I'm sorry. But I do love you. So much." He felt Cas waver in his embrace then, so all he could think of was to lock his arms around his angel even tighter and claims his lips in a kiss.
"Yeah, pathetic, right? Anyways, my recommendations... obviously, there are the classics. You know, the Golden Gate Bridge and the Cable Cars. If you're interested in museums, you should check out the Cartoon Art one, it's my personal favorite. Oh, and the Musée Mécanique, that's really awesome, it has this huge collection of all these arcade games, and you can actually play on them. And... okay, this is embarrassing, I'd actually have to ask Sammy for the more intellectual stuff, he's much better at these things. Speaking of, Stanford campus is pretty impressive, at least it was to me. But hey, what do I know, never been to university, so..." Blushing, the passenger trailed off. He really ought to shut his mouth now.
It was idiotic, he knew that - idiotic and unprofessional. But every once in a while, even someone like Castiel Shurley claimed the right to be not the responsible and level-headed person he was on an average day, but as human as everyone else. According to colleagues and acquaintances he lacked that humanness most of the time, so he believed he was allowed to wallow in it at least every now and then.
Gliding smoothly over to kneel in front of Dean, the flight attendant rubbed his palms along the other man's legs and over his hands, before finding his ass cheeks again. In a moment of braveness he leaned down and kissed first one, then the other, enjoying the way Dean's breathing hitched, and drawing a gasp right after when he placed a digit on the hole before him.
There was no answer left in Cas. He just stared at Dean, mouth hanging open, eyes blinking too fast as they tried to erase a picture that was too good to be true. He had never gotten what he truly wanted in his life so far. And now he got two things at once - the ideal job
The fascination that was there to flying was undeniable. Lift up into the clouds, past them even, and watch the world become smaller, more insignificant - nothing could ever have been more amazing.
There. Mind-reader. Called it.
It took them many minutes before they were able to let go of each other again; before their lips stopped seeking each other long enough for them to lean back and let their eyes meet. They stared at each other for a long time, just speaking through their eyes, ocean to forest, emerald to sapphire.
"I guess so, yes," he eventually remembered to reply, and forced a smile onto his face. "I assume it's not easy only seeing your family on weekends."
"Yep."
, which, by the way, doesn't include listening to you lot pestering him about something he can't change now anyways, to serve those of us who still have manners."
"Are you my friend or Castiel's?!"
It stung nevertheless. As innocent as it - hopefully - was, Castiel did his best to avoid looking to Dean and that woman.
Only when they parted minutes later, having shamelessly indulged in releasing years of pent-up longing - well, parts of it at least, Dean was sure there was still enough left to last them another few eons - Castiel, too, laughed. A pure, happy laugh.
"For the weekend, actually," Cas answered with a smile.
"Yeah, coffee's not good for the heart and all anyways," a blond-haired woman in 4a piped up, "and I'd very much like some apple juice. And a few of those heavenly tasting cookies!" Catching first the woman's eyes, nodding his thanks to her, and then Balthazar's, who immediately understood, Castiel turned toward the back of the plane and trailed the drinks trolley behind him. When he reached row 15, Dean's usual one, he used the wagon as a sort of a wall between them and the unfriendly passengers.
"You know what I mean."
Some months ago - the exact timespan he couldn't actually recall as time went by differently in his, in
Cas? Or had he maybe returned to his duty as an angel, a servant of God? Did he still remember their time together, their moments, what he had said when---
"What? No, Cas, listen, it's just--" But before Dean was able to finish, the angel vanished in an audio-only flurry of wings.
There was brown looking back instead of green.
"Speculation."
"Cassie, don't pout--"
Blindly he reached for the lube while he used the rest of the watery substance still on his hand and his lover to continue the light massage he had started earlier; circling the tip of his finger along the rim without applying any pressure. He knew he was going to drive Dean insane with it, but something in him wanted to know how much his lover was going to be able to take.
"Yeah, about that..." Jess started, just as Cas, having recognized the cue, said, "I leave you two alone."
"Hey, Cas? You all right?" Castiel blinked, realizing that he had zoned out to thoughts of Balthazar, of all people, while the man who was important right now - and hopefully would be for a long time - was right there in bed with him... and fumbling with opening the bottle.
Getting out of bed, Castiel stretched and took a deep breath. He needed to start his day, to be productive; needed to distract himself until he felt ready to deal with his broken heart, to take care of it and sooth it with memories he would thrive on.
Not much, apparently.
For endless minutes nothing but breathing could be heard over the connection, fast and full of little gasps from both sides. Dean reveled in those sounds; in the thought that his plan had worked out and he had succeeded in exhausting Cas enough so he would hopefully fall asleep soon.
So he pulled onto the street, miles and miles ahead of them through the wilderness of this new world, the song lasting them along their way, an easiness to their destination-less trip as Dean lounged in his seat and Cas leaned his head back, watching the lush forest green go by through half-closed eyes, both of them breathing in the clean air coming through the open windows. When Dean's right hand found Cas' left on the seat, it was the most normal thing, and their fingers intertwined as they enjoyed the road in silence.
There was an all too well-known sound the moment Castiel sat down. And he wasn't even taking his seat because he wanted to rest, though he definitely didn't mind that side effect of his action. No, he just needed to tie his right shoe's laces again - but apparently not even that he was allowed to do.
Those were the last things Dean saw before his eyes closed to the living world.
"But what if... something is seriously hurt. You really wanna risk that?!" He was so not having this conversation. No one should have such a conversation with their brother. Especially not their big brother whose sex life one had to deal with way too much already, alas involuntarily. But then, probably not everyone had a brother that was so stupidly stubborn. Or, at times, stubbornly stupid.
"As I was about to say, I know these types, and yes, maybe I'm one of them, but I've never claimed something else. Whereas lover boy over there actually did promise you you'd meet again, didn't he, Cas?"
Balthazar was not wrong. He
Five months. That was how long it had been going on already. How long they had to have arrange their schedules, trying their best to find times and places when they could meet, and if only for a few hours. They managed, somehow - but it was never enough. It was eating at them, a constant weight they carried, each meeting overshadowed by the knowledge that soon, too soon, they had to part again, and they didn't know with a one hundred per cent certainty whether their next planned date was going to happen.
Startled from his thoughts, it took the flight attendant a second or two to process the words that had just been hissed at him; then, however, he scrambled to his seat and quickly put on the belt. And did his best to ignore his colleague and friend Balthazar's glare.
It must have been half a lifetime before Dean eventually replied, "So am I," to Cas' earlier statement and made them both chuckle. And then they sank into another kiss.
? You have it bad for that flight attendant, old man, you might as well reserve a space in tomorrow's paper for a big announcement."
"Yep. There's this little bakery not far from here that has specialized in them. They're technically normal muffins, but, as you may have noticed, not the normal sweet ones. Instead they leave out the sugar and add ingredients for a hearty taste, like ham and bacon and cheese and even potatoes. Then they add spices and onions and bell pepper and stuff and it tastes like a whole breakfast, but in the form of a handy pastry."
"No, in fact I'm--"
"Thank you. We will." He didn't even know where the answer was coming from - but it was out of his mouth before Cas had even the chance to reconsider the words. Balthazar wasn't any less surprised than his friend, if the light gasp from his side was anything to go by. The barkeeper, on his part, obviously liked the answer, and grinned winningly before leaving the two flight attendants' table.
"I explain it to you then. Please, Cas?" Dean hoped that the other man wouldn't ask any more questions now. He knew how much he relied on knowing things in advance, which gave him a certain kind of security and control, but this was something he couldn't give Castiel a heads-up on, or else his lover would deny it right away; that much he knew.
It took Dean wriggling and his hands finding purchase on his lover's shoulders so he was able to counter any movements before Castiel pulled back, almost all the way out, and pushed in again, a slow but constant glide that he felt every inch of. Three times was he allowed to repeat that motion the same way, before his partner very clearly - albeit non-verbally - told him to get a move on.
A dark old barn. Dust floating in the faint light of a few beams coming through broken planks. And Sammy's grief-filled, tear-streamed face.
More his brain wasn't able to process. It was too much. It was the past twelve years in one moment. It was everything they had ever done, ever said, ever achieved, ever endured, ever lost, ever won.
Castiel's eyes were almost comically wide when he came face to face with Dean, a look of disbelief on his features for a moment, before his brain visibly caught up with the situation. And then he started to blush furiously.
"Yes, I know, but..." Jess took a deep breath and rubbed a hand over her face, the other stemmed into her side, as if she was trying to hold onto herself. "I'd still quite like your opinion. As someone who's basically new to the family, maybe you have another insight. It's just... I'm not sure..."
"Well then, Sheriff," Dean muttered under his breath as he pulled Cas close, "how about you arrest me and we go," he nodded his head in the direction of the Impala standing outside, "for a drive somewhere...
"Dean! Stop lurking out there with your boyfriend! We want to meet him!"
Now that the cat was out of the bag, it was astonishingly easy to talk about it.
"This is definitely the worst thing I have ever had to do in my life, but I have to leave," he announced, face apologetic when he approached Cas again and dropped down beside him.
Instead, he stated, "I can see why," and took in his surroundings once more, the fairytale garden amidst the city, plants glittering in the sun with the remnants of half a day of rain. The sounds of people and traffic moving by outside could be still heard, but only faintly. It made it easy to forget the city was still there. Only after a few minutes a thought occurred to Dean. "Wait, which doorman?" Because he certainly hadn't noticed them passing anyone, or any form of entrance, for that matter.
"As in,
"Hey Charlie," he greeted, feeling tired all of a sudden. His best friend was the last person he wanted to attack just because he couldn't be with Cas, and not being able to get rid of this dark cloud above his head made him resign.
"I doubt he is the right one to get laid by," he sighed and shrugged his shoulders, wondering for a moment why the words sounded so strange even to his own ears. Only at his friend's frown, he added, "Not any time soon, that is. He is not one night stand material."
"That's why fears are also there to be overcome," Castiel replied thoughtfully, and Dean didn't have to be a genius to understand that his lover was most probably also thinking about them. Of a fear of being rejected and laughed at overcome.
"Woah, woah, okay, Cas, slow down. What's the matter with you?"
"I call you in a few minutes."
"So?"
The question Dean asked him was the one he had wondered about as well - in the beginning, when he had first started to think about quitting after his conversation with Balthazar. But the answer had come so naturally to him, without almost any consideration, and without doubt.
"I'm sorry?"
Castiel only smiled happily, his eyes glittering with joy as he leisurely stroked his lover and not let himself be hurried by the impatient snapping of hips above him.
"I'm not a regular in hotels, but I'm sure that eight in the morning is a bit early for the cleaning team," a familiar voice answered, and Castiel whirled around, eyes wide as he came face to face with the subject of his earlier thoughts and worries.
It was also something - the involuntary discovery as well as the topic itself - he wasn't going to keep quiet about. They had, after all, agreed on talking about things that might cause misunderstandings.
Whether Jo was right or not didn't matter right then. Because Dean's mind was already busy rethinking his own words... and coming to the realization that he would like both to be true. He wanted his friends to like him. He wanted them to accept him. He and Cas weren't even... anything yet. And that was to say, if there was a
"Hello there, handsome. Fancy taking me home?"
He had lost count of how many times he involuntarily had been risen by his body's need for some warmth - and how often he had to fight to get at least a corner of the blanket. He was tired of it. No amount of cuddling and skin pressed to skin and all the other imaginable niceties - most of them before they fell asleep - of a shared bed made up for the cold anymore.
"Wait, you
"Morning, old man," the woman in question greeted cheerfully, and leaned over to unlock the passenger side door.
Still. It was ridiculous. This wasn't even long-distance anymore. This was long-distance of-around-the-globe or something. Or in short: too far. Not having Cas around for a short time was unbearable. And he never knew if the phone calls - at least those they tried to have once a day, if not more often - made it better or worse. But the prospect of not being able to see him for a full month? it made him actually question the whole thing. As much as he hated himself for it, and his brain for having such thoughts, but what use was a relationship if the respective others barely ever saw each other?
inside Dean's mind.
It was only then that he realized just what his lover had actually said. Cas quit. But one didn't quit a relationship, did they? One ended it, or left, or both agreed that it didn't work out anymore. But quit? One quit a job. So had he heard that right? Was Cas seriously ending his employment just because... well, for them? But... he couldn't! He had waited so long for that, and Dean... now he would throw that way just for Dean? No, he couldn't allow that. He'd go and beg Cas' boss to take him back. Yes, that's what he would do; what he had to. He owed that to his lover.
"So… you're a soldier again?"
"I really thought he'd go for it."
"Dean," Castiel said warily, a shiver in his voice, and the other man didn't need to see him to know that he was blushing. Clearly he had at least understood.
"Cas, not that I love or
"If you can't talk, or won't, or whatever, make a decision, Cassie. One of you has to," Balthazar stated matter-of-factly. Castiel was almost afraid to ask - and he knew the answer already.
He was pleased to find the pool empty; which was not much of a surprise, given that it was late in the evening already and the hotel wasn't booked. In addition to that was the weather quite good, warm and sunny, so most people were probably still out for walks or dinner at one of the many restaurants that offered seats at a terrace or in a garden.
often. I think that's going to be the best thing about that resort."
Same back was snatched only a few minutes later when Cas suggested to find some shelter after all, as the rain began to become heavier, destroying their hopes that maybe it were just a few lonely drops of a some even lonelier cloud flying by. A thought that had been in vain anyways, if the darkened sky was anything to go by.
Confused didn't even begin to describe Dean's condition then. Whatever did they want from him? And anyways, why were they meddling in someone else's affairs? Little brother or not, if there was someone to talk to, it was Castiel, but not those two clowns.
"Remember what I said earlier?"
Castiel was not in the business of 'getting' anyone. He was a professional, and as such felt bound to the company's rules; which included a clear statement regarding any kind of relationship between flight attendants and passengers. It was for the best also, he told himself; apart from the fact that he didn't even know if this Dean Winchester would be interested in men in general and in Castiel in particular, he also didn't believe there would be much of a future for them. With Dean -
"I want you to leave one hand up there now, Cas. Leave your left hand do what I want to do so much right now, let it caress and roam your body. And your right hand you bring down between your legs. Can you do that for me, Cas?" There was a jerky sound on the other end of the line, and Dean believed it to be nodding. It should have been enough; he knew Castiel well and didn't need verbal confirmation, but he craved to hear his lover's voice. "Talk to me, Cas. Tell me you've understood."
, his mind provided him, and he was inclined to agree. Trees and fields and mountains around him. A beautiful, peaceful scenery.  And behind him a--
"Oh, and for the record, Cas?"
"Anyways," Gabriel spoke up, effectively stopping new round of bickering that was just about to start. "The guy's some businessman. Lives in San Francisco, works in Detroit. Designs cars; some rebuild old models project, pretty successful apparently.”
Then Castiel slipped away, slipped from Dean's weakening grasp as the hunter felt overwhelmed with defeat and loss and pain, and he stumbled backwards, into the wall, as Cas was engulfed in blackness.
"A little bit, yes, but Dean, that has nothing to do with me not wanting it. I would have stopped you, I
"Dean..." The man didn't listen, though. He rambled on, as if a damn was broken.
"Come on, Cassie. I mean, what if you had met him somewhere else, outside work, and he then decided to fly with us?"
"It was my pleasure," the flight attendant answered, and the color rising into his cheeks was more than a little endearing.
"You can't... grab another man's... well, a man's," because who knew what Castiel was, if he was any gender at all, "private parts just like that."
"Yes, Sammy's my brother and Jess his girlfriend. Wait - you didn't think...?"
"Cas?"
"Very funny." He fumbled to remain standing as Balt pushed his pants down, the by now unbuttoned shirt from his shoulders, and the change of clothes into his hands, but wasn't stopped from his continuous protest. "You know that's not what I meant."
"Dean, have you even been listening?"
Now that Jo knew also almost everyone who was truly important to him was informed, and as Dean thought about it, it lifted a huge weight off his shoulders.
. Not that the latter was asked for to get details added, but Dean took a lot of delight in his brother protesting and the women giggling. And Castiel blushing.
But Cas had been gone when Jack had assumed God powers. Cas was in the Empty.
And so Dean did. Or tried at least. First he had to allow himself a moment more to think of his wonderful angel, the one he loved so much, and who had apparently knit or sewn or whatever-that-was-called together several spare blankets to make one that could have easily been used as parachute.
"Dean. This relationship with him. More time with him. I just don't know if I can continue like that. If
"Because you know him so well," Dean said, mocking tone in his words, and it earned him a slap on the arm from Jo.
This without the shadow of a doubt was the most ridiculous situation Dean had ever been in. And that was considering he had had numerous affairs and one night stands, among them not few who had brothers. But never, not even in his teenager years, had he ever had someone approach him like this, to protect heart and honor or whatever of his subject of interest. He couldn't believe that was actually happening.
- but about someone he might just find it in him to care about a bit more than only for a few hours of pleasure and fun.
Shockingly enough, Dean found that he wasn't all that bothered by it. He was more bothered by the fact that he'd have to leave Cas, because as much as the other man meant to him, a Led Zeppelin tribute he just couldn't miss, and not only because the tickets had been horrendously expensive.
"What's that?" Dean asked, dumbly, even though the answer was obvious.
Castiel waited exactly for as long as it took his friend to vanish through the curtain before he allowed himself to fall into his seat in the crew area and bury his face in his hands.
Swallowing a few times to get rid of that lump in his throat, Dean hoped that his voice wouldn't leave him now as he prepared for sending Castiel across the finish line.
"It is okay, Dean. I know. I understand. We don't need to dwell on the past."
"What do you mean, 'what'?! You've been nagging us for
And how could he have ever known that, contrary to his firm belief, the time between take-off and landing was more than enough to turn his world upside down.
"Cas?! I can't find the passport, have you seen it?"
"Happily."
"Yeah."
"This must be what they call a vicious circle."
Closing his eyes and shaking his head, Castiel sighed. He understood his friends' concern, but he really could have done with less hurtful words. Even more so since he himself struggled with his faith in Dean and his believe that the passenger was truthful about his statements, and his interest in him. A little flirt on the side didn't hurt, as long as it remained in that state of easy conversation and a touch or two.
"You know these rules are just guidelines, right?" Oh how he hated Balthazar's uncanny ability to read his mind and come up with just the right comment that gave his doubts a hard time.
Not that he wasn't going to make very good use of that opportunity now. There he was, his fascinating and gorgeous passenger who happened to also have a wonderful, kind and charming personality, and he was ready and willing to become Castiel's lover, so how could he have let that chance pass, even if this timid self with its tendency to be rather inhibited wanted him to.
make you uncomfortable," Dean repeated, not a question anymore now, but a statement. The sadness, the apology in his lover's features, it didn't ease Cas' worry that a huge misunderstanding between them was to occur that could possibly cost them their relationship.
about the concert you've been getting on all our nerves about for months?!"
"Oh."
"Cas, please don't--"
Wordlessly, he stared at his friend, a single tear rolling down his cheek.
"You need to get laid," Jo remarked on Wednesday evening at around eight, when they were still in the office, pouring over files and schematics and blueprints the computer told them didn't make sense. Only that same computer of course didn't tell them where to look for the problem, so it was up to them to check every single calculation again.
"One and a half weeks," he defended, weakly as the argument was, and demonstratively looked down at the papers in front of him again. "Let's try and finish that, okay? I wanna go home and to bed."
That was all that was going around in his head right now.
"Gosh, you're as much a spoilsport as he is. You're just lucky I love you both enough to be capable of respecting your wishes every now and then."
"Nah, as I said, no need--"
"I got an idea. You at the hotel yet?"
The so familiar sound of fluttering wings he managed to ignore.
Opening the desk drawer Cas had indicated, he found what he was looking for right away, the passport lying atop some other papers. When he snatched it, it wasn't his intention to take a closer look on what lay under it, and if for time reasons only, but something caught his eye: the hard-to-miss headline on a webpage printout that said in big letters
"Hello Dean." The older Winchester couldn't help himself then - he laughed. He laughed and pulled Castiel into his arms and held him so fast that the other man actually let out a small noise of protest.
"Good. Let go of your cock, now, Cas," he ordered, and at the noise of protest he repeated firmly, "I need you to lift your hands off your body for a moment, and then I want you to put some lube on your fingers. I know you can do that." The squelching sound that followed drew a sigh of relief from Dean, even though he wasn't quite sure what he was relieved about.
Aforementioned person manning the bar was also the one Castiel spotted right upon arrival. Because how could he have missed him - he who looked like one Dean Winchester's twin brother. Granted, he lacked a few details, looked a little more worn, a little less groomed, and his style was, understandably, not business, but rebel rocker teenager. Alas the good-looking sort. But he had an uncanny resemblance to his favorite passenger, and it was enough to make Cas growl at Balthazar the moment the other man turned to grin at him winningly.
Of course he and Cas had to answer questions, and not few of them. Every detail of their first meeting was enquired, as was how they had taken that next step from passenger and flight attendant to, well,
Sitting in the bathtub, Castiel carefully bounced Mary on his knees, and then laid her against his bent legs, holding her with his hands wrapped securely around her as she stemmed her tiny feet against his stomach. Water splashed when she struggled a little, and the jumping droplets fascinated and excited her even more. Mary loved water, that much Dean and Castiel had already found out about their daughter.
So here he was. Sitting in an airplane, waiting for the inevitable - the take-off. Which he hated even more than flying itself.
"I'm afraid I can't give you any information about guests staying at our house when you can't provide a full name."
"You may offer me," and here the passenger's tone of voice changed to a biting calm one, "the complaint form. I'm having enough of this!" The other people around them who had listened intently now began to murmur, obviously spurred on by the angry man in front of Castiel. One by one others suddenly also demanded the form, and the flight attendant began to reevaluate how much he really loved this workplace. Because in that moment, love was not the word he was thinking of.
"Sibling?"
The bag in hand, he wormed his way back under the sheets and into Castiel's welcoming arms, before he slowly revealed the contents of his purchase by dipping a hand into the papery case and pulling out one of the objects it held, all the while he carefully watched his lover's face. Which was set in curious expectation and topped by adorably ruffled hair, courtesy of their earlier round of morning lovin', as Dean had called it at one point, much to Cas' amusement and, in turn, his delight.
"In all fairness, they did forecast rain for the evening."
It was a soundtrack made of gasps, groans, harsh breathing, broken kisses and two bodies relishing in their intimate connection that filled the room as movements became more rushed and impatient by the second; and when Castiel eventually regained enough mental clarity to change the angle of his thrusts so his cock would rub along Dean's prostate, a conglomerate of a yell and a yes was added to the sounds, and repeated several times, before the man beneath him had to give in to the overstimulation he was experiencing just then, and came with a shout, taking his lover with him as his hole clenched around the shaft inside him.
Thus the loss when Dean pulled back all of a sudden irritated the flight attendant. Unwillingly he let go when his partner lifted himself away to lean to the side where his bag had somehow come to stand on the ground next to the bed. It was mostly an automatism when he stopped the man in his movement, whispering questioningly, "What are you doing?" The reply was just as quietly.
"I get that. That's why I spent most of my time at work when I'm in Detroit, and only go back to my apartment to sleep. Could just as well put up a bed in my office..."
Castiel was not open when it came to sex. He preferred to keep it all private, in a locked bedroom, and best with the lights turned off. Sex was still a peculiar thing to him, as much as he enjoyed it - especially with Dean. Only with Dean. The few encounters he had had before were not even mentionable; quite the contrary. That excluded Balthazar of course, but then things with Balt had been different in so many ways.
"It was good, wasn't it?" Dean grinned, oblivious yet, or maybe simply trying to lighten the mood, but his face fell when Cas didn't respond in kind. However, it was the flight attendant himself who felt horror befall him when his lover suddenly took a step backwards, completely breaking any physical contact between them. "Oh God... did I make you uncomfortable? Cas, no, you should have told me! You could have said no, you can always say no with me, gosh, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to..." Hadn't the situation and Dean distancing himself from Cas scared him so much, the flight attendant probably would have watched with fascination how the other man's face drained of color with every word. But when Dean, almost white as a sheet, stumbled backwards until his back hit a wall, he knew he had to do something, and fast.
"Though you may not have had the advantage of my healing powers those other times."
When Friday came around, he was ready to kill someone - anyone at all - whereas he usually didn't even have the heart to kill a fly that bothered him half the night. The thought that kept him sane was that he was hopefully going to see Dean again.
When Dean groaned then, it wasn't because of the pain. That he could almost forgot over the fact that his kid brother had called angelic help for a sore nut. Or two. As if this wasn't embarrassing enough already.
"I take the red and yellow one," a voice he'd come to know so well, despite not having heard it that often yet, sounded from behind him, and he smiled when he turned around. "Hello Dean."
"I suppose so, but I'm used to it. I'll just read or take a few walks or whatever I'm in the mood for."
"Dean!" How the three managed a synchronous call was beyond the flight attendant.
"It was. It
the good old times," he purred, and it sent shivers down Castiel's spine that walked the narrow path of every fiber of his body refusing the suggestion and yet a few of these fibers not being entirely against the idea. But no. This was the past, and there was a reason for it.
good, though. Regardless of my worries afterwards," he murmured then, referring to Dean's earlier words. The other man only chuckled.
"Mr. Shurley! Welcome back, sir," Yanny, the receptionist Castiel had already spent one or the other minute - and sometimes more - having a chat with greeted him with a smile when he approached the counter.
"Breakfast," Dean grinned proudly, and disentangled himself from his lover's limbs to quickly fetch the little surprise he'd brought. Which was, when he thought about it, just another point on his list of 'Signs that Dean Winchester is getting emotionally attached'. He had never brought breakfast. So he had never been at the hotel room of someone else, never spent the night and had to wonder about morning meals. Either he left before that ever became a subject, or he was at someone's home where he simply made do with what was there, if he decided that staying a little longer than till sunrise was acceptable.
"He won't. His flight got delayed due to technical problems, and now they will probably leave South Africa not before tomorrow morning, maybe even noon, which means he won't be here before the afternoon or evening, and I can't leave any later than three pm. So - I'm not gonna be able to see him, not even for at least a few minutes, and that sucks majorly."
"I'm serious, Dean. Don't hurt him. Take care of him. I told you before, Cassie's like a little brother to me and Balthazar. He doesn't have anyone else. Don't give him hope when you're not planning to go through with it."
"Don't you
"I take it you have family to come home to, then, yes?" the woman asked, and Dean sensed there was an ulterior motive to the question, but he answered nevertheless.
Castiel knew he should have stopped Dean. He should have asked, if not demanded, to talk first. What he had to tell could change things, and maybe not for the better. What use was it to meet Dean's family and friends now, when he didn't even knew if not tomorrow he'd look back at this day, this evening, as the last he'd seen him, been with him privately? What if Dean sent him away and then even chose another airline to fly with?
Their short walk back was a rather fast one, though they also did their best to take their time at least a bit, so they could make the most of every second. And it was done so in silence - walking next to each other, fingers still linked, shoulders bumping. The smiles on their faces told whole tales, as did the joy reflected in their eyes.
So this ended tonight.
"You're not going to eat something as well?" came the question from his side that pulled him from his thoughts, and Dean blinked for a moment, before he leaned forward and took a bite from the muffin he was holding, earning himself a playfully shocked and hurt look.
"Well... because we were apart so much and I would never have expected you to quit your job for us, for
As their friend left the crew area, Balthazar came over to pat Castiel on the back. The latter was just about to nod in thanks for the silent support when he heard the whispered, "Go get 'em, tiger."
"You're a weird muffin, Cas," the indignant squeak the flight attendant gave at that got completely ignored, "and I couldn't be happier that you're a part of our family." And before he even knew what was happening he found himself wrapped up in hug he was quite sure only monkeys were capable of - what with the clinging and all.
"How's Baby?"
He started when he left the small cabin of the toilet and - once more, just like on that flight the week prior - found Gabriel standing before him, in his personal space. And the chief flight attendant didn't lose any time getting right to the point.
"Case in point," Dean groaned, letting his forehead rest against Cas' for a moment, before he detached himself unwillingly and snatched his shirt from the ground, struggling to get into it while walking over into the living room and the portable cot Mary was lying in and playing with the mobile hanging from the handle. She squealed happily when she saw her dad.
In that moment between seconds, when he felt Cas' hand applying pressure to push him out of the way, Dean reacted on pure instinct. Instinct he didn't know he even had. Instinct he would never, in a million years, have expected from himself.
"What's up?" he asked, but when he followed Gabe's dagger shooting stare, an answer became unnecessary. "Woah. Isn't he a douche." A groan from behind him made him turn around to Castiel, who stood leaning again the cabinets and shook his head.
"But I don't want to be here without you. It's all right, Dean. Yanny will be happy to see me, too."
"We'll make some. Together," he eventually promised when he had calmed down. "We can do everything we want now, don't we?" Cas smiled at that and nodded, walking towards Dean as he did.
When Dean pulled away the curtain that covered the area past the toilets, there was no Castiel waiting. Instead, the third of the flight attendants Dean had seen often on his trips, the one he believed to remember was the chief of them, suddenly stood before him. Meanwhile, he also noticed the other one he had just talked to follow him and come to stand behind him.
"I'm sorry, I have to go. May I take your cup?"
"Yes! Yes, that's what he called it."
"Hello, Balthazar. Is this an inconvenient time to call?"
"Thanks, Dean."
The even more familiar human shape appearing several steps away amidst the field he couldn't.
With a little help from all sides and supported by what both men had saved already, they had even been able to buy a small house just outside of San Francisco; one that was perfect for their little family, and had a garden where Mary and her cousin, Sam's and Jess' baby boy Kevin, ten months himself, could have carefree playtimes.
But now? Now what he wanted,
"Breakfast muffins?"
But when he dared to look up then, he was surprised to find that his to-be lover had turned a few shades of red.
"Can I get you a drink, ma'am? Sir?" Pamela was interrupted by one of the flight attendants appearing next to them, and she gave the tall, slim, blond-haired man with his British accent a withering stare.
Sammy, of course. He'd be around sometime, someday, he knew.
"What? What's going on?"
"You really are dedicated," the passenger said with a smile when he accepted the water and immediately took a greedy sip from it.
Down the aisle to his right he stood, the angel in his suit and trenchcoat, the one who looked like Heaven's very own tax accountant, but who was the bravest and most loyal and overall best friend Dean had ever had.
"You sure about that? If I was you, I'd have a contingency plan for your next date."
"And? Did I promise too much?"
"Taking a stab in the dark here, but you - in all your talking you do, according to what you've told me -you have never talked about
And then he needed yet another moment to think of a certain part of his anatomy.
But mostly, she was a happy baby because she had a family that loved and adored her. And spoiled her.
"No," came the immediate protest from the blanket mountain which began to move right after, spitting out a rumpled and disgruntled Castiel.
"I was hoping he could help."
They had never thought it possible, but adopting little Mary proved almost even easier than arranging with their jobs and bosses. Both Cas and Dean were entirely unprepared, as hard as they had worked on making their home ready for the baby, when they received word that soon enough, they'd be fathers to the six-months-old girl.
The flight attendant nodded and then went back down the aisle. His flustered appearance after that little moment with Dean, however, didn't go unnoticed, much to his dismay.
"Okay," he said, his voice even more shaky now. Dean couldn't help but smile fondly.
"I'm in car business, my company's in Detroit. So I travel back and forth between there and San Francisco."
It surely wasn't the worst pastime.
"Thank you, Yanny."
He was only halfway to the door when from somewhere beneath the dome of angel and blanket he heard his name, rasped with a sleep-thick voice.
"Angel?"
To his personal distraction.
He was just in the progress of searching for his underwear when he heard the door lock click, announcing someone entering. Quickly turning towards the window and thus away from the entrance, he quickly dismissed, "I don't need cleaning services right now, thank you," and hoped the hotel employee would get the message - and not think of him as a too impolite guest, since he spoke with his back to the person and didn't acknowledge them any further.
"Dean!" When Cas said his name this time, the other man snapped his mouth shut. And was immediately filled with worry. There was fear and sadness in his lover's eyes, but also relief, and Dean really didn't want to think about what that meant. Though he was certain it could only mean one thing: Cas had made a decision.
This lost in thoughts and zoned out, he couldn't help but flinch and let out a little gasp of surprise when Dean, without warning, spoke again, determination prominent in eyes, voice and body language: "To hell with it, we
"So... how come you are here? I thought angels weren't supposed to be in people's Heavens? Or is this part of the reshaping you and Jack have done?"
"I'm not really into going home with someone I've just met an--"
"Yup, I can see how totally with us you are." Apparently Balthazar wasn't yet through with his stabs; and really, how could Castiel ever have assumed something different. He knew that man long enough, after all.
Happy that his brother's complaining would finally - hopefully - be silenced and he could return to his research, Sam only spared another short glance to the other two men in the room. But what he witnessed wasn't the usual two-fingers-to-the-forehead action. Instead, their angel friend, without hesitation, full-on grabbed Dean's crotch. And Sam was sure that he was looking in a mirror, because he must have worn the exact same expression his brother's face showed in that moment - eyes wide enough to come close to bulge from their sockets, and mouth falling open in shock.
"Do you want to come in?" he heard himself asking, and felt his stomach drop... until he saw Dean smile.
"I..." Cas blanched. Of all the things he had said, this was what his lover picked. And he hadn't even meant to tell Dean that. Not yet anyways. He knew those were big words, meaningful words, and they held more weight than any declaration that he wanted them to be together and make their relationship work could ever had. He had planned on taking his time saying those words out loud, and find the right moment. Maybe he had been naive - maybe there was no right moment for this. But surely there were wrong ones, and this applied to all those times when he wasn't yet sure it wouldn't make the other man turn and run. As firm as he was in his decision, he certainly didn't want it all to end just yet, if it had to end at some point.
Castiel opened his mouth to argue, but didn't get around to say something when they were addressed by just the person in question approaching.
"It's all right, Dean. We will see each other again, won't we?"
This was it. This was the moment it all came to an end. How had they now managed to fight for it, as he had once promised Cas all those months ago? He had been so certain they could make it work. Why was it so hard? And why didn't he just give up what was keeping him from the one thing, the one person, he really wanted?
Was he really...? Had he truly...? There was this big four letter word floating in the air just in front of him, and he still wasn't all that sure how to grasp it. How long had he known that man? Surely not long enough to... to...
For one, Dean had decided that Castiel was and would be neither affair nor conquest. He very much doubted that the other man was the type for it anyways, and if he was honest with himself, judging from everything he knew so far, it would be a waste to have Castiel merely for one or a couple of nights. Especially since it would make their roles as passenger and flight attendant really awkward - not without reason Dean avoided running into one night stands again if he could help it.
The ground beneath his feet felt liberating, and the sun shining into his face as he stepped out of the shadow of the plane like a welcome back embrace of the world. He was safely back on earth, or tarmac, but however one wanted to call it, it was a fantastic moment and Dean savored it by stopping and closing his eyes for a second, even though he was supposed to walk over to the terminal entrance quickly.
"I love touching your body, Cas. You are so beautiful, all muscles and yet softness in just the right places. Now give your nipples a bit of attention. Remember how I always rub them gently? I'm doing it right now. I lie beside you and I tease you, just as you like it."
"All done with your phone call?" the purring voice next to him sounded once again, but this time, before also the hands were able to return, Dean turned his head towards Pamela, looking at her apologetic.
The voice was not right. That definitely didn't speak for the Dean-facsimile. Unfortunately for Cas, however, voice was not really what he paid much attention to the moment he had a close-up of the man. Because there really was, if he didn't give it too much thought and didn't look for too long or too closely, more of Dean in this face than was still explainable by coincidence. In any case it wasn't fair.
Yes. Perfect.
"We kissed." For some reason, Dean felt idiotic saying it like this. Like a schoolboy who told his buddies proudly of his first kiss - and made it a story about how he had totally swept the girl off her feet with it, while in fact he'd been the one with wobbly knees.
In the distance a young man, dressed in a white jean jacket, stood at the riverside. He was barefoot and enjoyed the small waves of fresh water swapping over his toes every now and then. With a smile he looked up to the bridge and rose his hand in an unseen greeting to the three men standing up there, arms slung around each other. The men who had raised him; his fathers. They radiated happiness and joy and love, and everything the young man had wanted this new Heaven to symbolize.
"No I haven't!" Castiel protested, struggling to keep his voice at a level that wouldn't let half the plane overhear their conversation. Which, in turn, alarmed Balthazar that he was right in his deduction, because Castiel never rose his voice. "As I said, I was just thinking. Contemplating a few things. And incidentally I missed the take-off announcement,
Though sad about losing a regular customer he had obviously become fond of, Yanny was thrilled for Castiel when he was told by the same that from now on he was going to stay at Dean's as often as possible. May Cas himself have regretted having to leave behind the familiarity of the Seaside Inn; the prospect of becoming an even bigger part of his lover's life by being allowed to stay at his home whenever he was around was more than enough to make him forget these few sorrowful thoughts.
"Well... after getting off the plane on Monday I noticed a problem."
"Cas," he said, voice thick with tears, eyes already filling with water. "Cas, you... you're..." Then he noticed it. The frown, the unhappiness displayed in the other man's face. It wasn't right. It scared Dean. "What's the matter, Cas?"
Introducing Castiel - now officially his... boyfriend? Nah, they weren't teenagers. Lover? Not quite a name for someone you were in a relationship with. Partner? Could work, but had a cold, clinical air to it. Significant other? Okay, they definitely had to talk terms at some point.
Though he was seriously reconsidering the 'not dead' part right then.
"So?" she continued, entirely unimpressed, and stuck her tongue out at her future-brother-in-law when he threw a cashew nut at her.
But here a fierce and too-loud, "No!" from his lover interrupted him, and in the blink of an eye he found himself engaged in a forceful, if not bruising kiss. Dean allowed it for a few seconds, before he gently pushed the other man away.
"Listen, Cas, I'm thankful for what you've done, but I'd really like to stop talking about it now, okay?"
"The one to end it."
"Yes..." the other man rasped, an erotic sound he had heard so often in these past weeks, and wasn't able to resist. This was about Castiel, but still he couldn't help himself when he quickly pushed down his pants and briefs, and pulled aside his already half-open shirt.
The week went by not as fast as Dean would have liked to, but he also had enough work to distract him, so he only really noticed the Friday that had him glance at the clock on the wall of his office every ten minutes. Or at least that was what it felt like.
"You don't have to stay at the hotel, that's what I gave you my keys for--"
"I will make sure of it." Dean could have sworn there was a hint of something else there, something that spoke of a yearning that remained unspoken, and desperately hidden. All of a sudden Castiel began to fidget, just a little bit, barely noticeable, but he felt strangely aware of the other man, even though they weren't more than casual acquaintances.
"I'm not sure our schedules will match though," he said, putting his hand over hers on his knee with the intention of gently removing it. She, however, took it as invitation to slip it a little further up, and let her other hand come to rest on his chest.
"Mr. Winchester was my father; I really prefer being called Dean."
felt.
But nothing compared to the pain he was feeling right now. Bloody ghost and its definitely-not-textbook ability to manifest in corporeal form. Lucky for them, at least textbook killing worked, even if some other things didn't. Not so lucky for
"You up for going there now that I'm with you?"
"Yes, since the company is paying for it, we have several upper middle class hotels to choose from. They are still not particularly luxurious, and they are far from being home, but at least they are comfortable enough for staying inside when one isn't in the mood for going out. When I'm here I always stay at the Seaside Inn. It's not too far from either the city or the airport, and I can take walks to the sea."
Dean.
"You're not asking me, Dean. I'm doing that because I want to."
Castiel wasn't so naive to believe that his problems vanished when he was that far above everything he had to deal with on the ground, but at least he could pretend for a little while. Could do his job and every now and then steal a glance out of the porthole, assured that for that moment, for these few hours, he was in his own world, a microcosm that remained undisturbed for as long as they remained airborne.
He did indeed. He had already decided that Cas would be more than just another notch in his conquest board, and in his mind he was doing everything short of praying that the flight attendant was up for that as well. So far he had a good feeling about it, and he was already impatiently awaiting their next - private - meeting. Hell, a part of him - a tiny one, but it was there nonetheless - even cursed that this concert had to be on that weekend. If only he had been able to stay with Castiel. And even if it had only been for talking, or taking a walk, or whatever. But having to part so soon, and after their first kiss at that...
"Don't mess this up, Dean Winchester," Jo's sudden warning brought him back from his thoughts, and for a moment he frowned at the words.
"I think a wedding will be very useful."
"That's great, Cas! That's..." The flight attendant literally saw as realization hit Dean. Realization what it meant. There was the tell-tale widening of eyes, and the slumping of shoulders, the flash of sadness and disappointment in his expression. But Dean was quick to school all of it, hiding it away and putting a brave smile in place. Only his voice wavered the tiniest bit when he continued, "That's all you ever wanted. Congratulations." And then he leaned in and kissed him on the cheek, and Cas knew it was mostly because his lover needed a reason to hide his expression that had once again began to slip during his few words.
of same father that didn't know and accept anything else than the social norm.
"You got a few minutes, or is this a bad time?"
"I believe you already had that often enough. Just this morning, for example," he gave back, equally quiet, before he turned away to tend to the other guests. He never saw the proud smile on his lover's face as he watched the retreating form of the flight attendant he was so hopelessly... well.
"I do. I have. I--"
Still reeling from his realization, from his mind putting into words what so far he had only had a vague grasp at, Cas almost missed the other man slowly letting go and turning away. In the last second he put his hand on Dean's arms, preventing him from leaving - be it symbolically or really just to follow the repeated calls of the others in the next room - and tugged lightly so his lover would face him once more.
thankful. That twinge, that emptiness, it was going to be filled by his brother, as it was supposed to be.
The sun was warm as it shone through the treetops, the world dipped in a soft golden glow, the street lined by proud trees of lush green.
Or was he?
"Think you're gonna see her again?"
"I'm Castiel," he answered and smiled at his passenger.
Now was important to take care of a problem one of the arrangements - the main one to be precise - came along with.
"Tell me what that is, first. Please. It tastes... different, but also familiar." And just like that, Dean's arousal was forgotten - at least for the moment - and his smirk turned into a winning smile when he announced, "Breakfast muffins!"
interesting...
"Hey Cas." Every other word would have been a waste of time, Dean decided when he folded his arms around the other man and pulled him into a kiss. "Glad you're here," he whispered when they parted again, and then leaned in for another kiss, just because he couldn't get enough and it had been a week - and anyways, did he really need a reason?
"Really?"
Or maybe he had just become light-headed in wake of his anxiety.
But actually leaving to buy breakfast and then return? For someone who would have the meal service due to the hotel stay anyways?
The fact that there was no one he knew of who had that kind of long-distance relationship also made him wonder if that was because it just wasn't possible. Maybe, for a short time, like they had endured it five months now. But how long was this going to work, not having the person one loved close by? It was painful. It was insufferable.
No. No. No. No. No. No no no no no nonononononono...
The week definitely qualified as hellish. If there was a Hell, this was what it looked like: filled with unhappy passengers demanding information on when they were going to start. Three times they had to wait in line before take-off, which caused them delays of up to one hour, and a plane full of cranky customers, their voices mingling to a disharmonic concert made of words like 'refund', 'last time', 'unprofessional' and the like.
he loved in his arms, Dean Winchester finally understood.
... angel."
Glaring at the curtain of hair obscuring his view on his brother's face, Dean took a moment to contemplate his answer while wondering if fratricide was a possibility, considering their family history. Ultimately he decided that it wasn't worth the effort. And that meant the effort of doing all research in the future on his own. In any case wasn't Sam his primary concern.
Living in the bunker was spoiling them, no doubt. A proper home, a real kitchen, an archive and a library, and of course beds with memory foam mattresses. Memory foam! It could have been so perfect.
"Turn around? Why?"
else than your own hands will do you some good, trust me. Especially since I somehow doubt that your own hands have much to do these days."
Instinct had no active, processing mind. Instinct didn't wonder why he would kiss that best friend. While he felt the sudden need to let go of something he had been holding in for so long. Instinct just acted. Made Dean act. Act on longings and desires, on fears and on despair. All of which were laid into the kiss, passionate as it was reverent, expressing what Cas had just confessed and Dean was not yet ready to say.
"Sir?"
He felt restless. He felt like someone had taken a vital part from him and put it on the other side of the globe, practically unreachable for reasons made by time, money and certain anxieties.
"What?"
. Until now they were just two people who had met by chance, found they liked each other, and kissed on one occasion. Who was to say it was ever going to become more?
Balthazar's - surprisingly gentle - voice pulled him from his thoughts. Right, a reply. If only he had one.
"Woah, what's up with you?"
Their plan to adopt a baby had worked in their favor, also. Dean's boss Jody Mills, a woman who was as strict and fierce as she was fair and kind, had been delighted to hear of their family plans, having taken a fancy to Cas the first time she had met him, and supported their relationship ever since. Under the promise that the couple would visit her with their new family addition soon, she signed off the papers that allowed Dean to give up his Detroit apartment and get comfortable at his new desk in Palo Alto.
"It's true, though, Cas! Also, you were the one who came in here looking like you had just seen a ghost."
"I promise you'll be in bed no later than ten, okay?"
"I quit."
His neck.
Assuring his brother that he'd be there shortly - he really wasn't looking forward to the rush they'd have to put on now - Dean ended the call and turned back to the other man still sitting on the bench who now looked at him curiously, head cocked to one side. Dean couldn't help but smile at the adorableness of it.
Maybe under Jack as God, even people like Garth and his family would be allowed into heaven.
"Seems like you got his attention. Well done, Cassie!" Balthazar laughed, clapping his friend on the back. It didn't much help the dreadful feeling the younger man had in his stomach all of a sudden, knowing that this was all wrong. There was nothing of that feeling of 'right' he had had with Dean the first time they had talked; instead he felt like a piece of meat the stranger had just decided to devour.
Heaving himself from the bed after having disposed of his phone on the nightstand, he went to the bathroom to clean up. He was too tired to shower, feeling as relaxed as he had aimed to make Castiel, and barely managed to brush his teeth before he fell onto his mattress again and struggled to get under the sheets. He was asleep not even five minutes later, slipping into unconsciousness with thoughts of Cas on his mind.
an amazing, perfect partner? He barely resisted the urge to pinch himself. If this was a dream, he didn't want to wake up anyways.
Shaking his head, he grabbed the car seat and his suitcase, announcing, "We're going to be late for our flight," before he headed out through the door leading to the garage. "I'll secure her in, lock up, will ya?" And with that, he was gone.
"Dean..." the flight attendant only murmured, now after all following his body's instincts and pressing himself against the other man, needing as much of their bodies touch as possible, and if only to reassure himself that his lover was still there, and wouldn't go anywhere.
Dean Winchester had never given much thought to heaven. Not in a positive, look-forward-to-it way at least. Last he checked, heaven wasn't the place one actually wanted to go; a big mess, a prison for souls, damned to relive one moment of their lives over and over without ever knowing.
His week at work went by torturously slow. There were some throwbacks, problems that needed to be solved, keeping him in his office till the late evening hours and had him fall into bed as soon as he entered his apartment and taken off his shoes. At least it stopped him from thinking about Castiel too much... one should have thought.
"I'm afraid that's beyond my, or any of my colleagues' expertise. We may not tamper with the technical equipment on board, for safety reasons. I apologize for the inconvenience. May I offer you something else?"
"Well, I'm gonna go 'n harass Rufus for a bit." Bobby stood up and walked a couple of steps. "Give Aretha some timeout from him. That Heaven, apparently you can have everything you want; even bad taste like Aretha must've." Once more, he turned to look at Dean. "I guess the question is... whaddya gonna do now, Dean?"
An hour later saw them bring their suitcases, bags and little Mary, bathed, dressed into her favorite jumper and snuggled into her car seat, to the front door. With a good fifteen minutes still in hand, they were ready to go - on their first real holiday as a family, and only their third one since they'd become a couple.
"Get on with it already! Please, Cas!"
"Business trip. I usually work in San Francisco, but my boss sent me to Jackson for a meeting with a client, so... here I am."
"Come on, angel, I'm ready!" he demanded - a sudden sound after minutes of only heavy breathing, moans, a gasp or two, and maybe some keening noises - and it was obviously in an attempt to spur the other man on, but he actually achieved the contrary when Castiel suddenly stopped, taken too much by surprise by the new pet name to continue what he was doing. His lover just freezing and doing nothing anymore seemed to have Dean worried then, though. "Cas?"
"Just... dunno, thought you might prefer it?" With a confused frown, Cas shook his head.
Dean opened his mouth to reply, but snapped it shut when he heard someone snicker. Someone was laughing at them. Someone... was Sam. Little brother Sammy, who was sitting in his corner of the booth, looking down at his breakfast and -
"Um, next Friday in the early evening, I guess, as usual. I should definitely be back before you return." There was silence on the other end of the line, and a strange feeling settled in Dean's stomach. "Cas?"
"I'll be waiting at the door to freedom," he found himself replying, even winking boldly - but also quickly retreating then before he crossed any line.
"Are you all right, Mr. Shurley?"
"Welcome on board, Mr. Winchester," he began, already a warning undertone in his voice, "We hope you have a pleasant time on this flight." Not willing to play this game, Dean simply rolled his eyes and was about to walk past the flight attendant, when the same grabbed his arm and whispered into his ear, "But if you make it too pleasant, we'll make sure to correct that for you."
Gabriel huffed, then tsked him. "Don't be ridiculous." Again he let a few moments pass, to create a more dramatic air, but only succeeding in making Dean more impatient. "Castiel kills you. But I will help him hide the body. And give him an alibi." The smile was too brilliant for the words he had just spoken, but at this point, nothing could really shock Dean anymore about Gabriel Rickster. Or, as he'd come to call him, the Trickster. Suited him better, anyways.
"Hi, I wanted---" And all of a sudden it hit Dean that he didn't even knew Cas' full name. How was he supposed to find out which room his favorite flight attendant was staying when he didn't even know who to ask for?
Paul really knew what he did. He was good at it - more than that even, Castiel had to admit. Sighing, he gave in to the temptation of a man who looked so much like the one he really wanted, and who was willing to welcome him in his arms without asking anything in return. It was almost too good to be true. They kissed again, sinking deep into a lovers' embrace when Castiel, too, dared to touch the other man, and hands roamed for minutes as lips and tongue devoured.
"I will return to the Seaside Inn, but if you have to leave, you should, Dean. I don't want you to be too late."
He had to admit that coming face to face with Balthazar was a bit anti-climatic.
The younger man shrugged his shoulders; he didn't know the answer to that. Visit his family and friends, of course, at some point he would do that, he wanted to. See them all again, happy and content and finally free of the never-ending duty of being a hunter, how could he not want to share this with them. Right in that moment, however, there was an emptiness inside him, a sense of loss, and celebrating just didn't sit right with him. He could go for a drive, his Impala stood close by and waiting for him, but--
"Nope. Sorry to disappoint you, Jo, but no." And it wasn't even a lie. He hadn't gotten lucky, not if one excluded one's own hands in the definition of 'getting lucky', at least. However, if it alluded to meeting someone really,
As it turned out, he was lucky. At least in the respect that his favorite passenger was on the flight. Not so much when it came to the flight in general.
"Dean... last night..." Castiel began, but trailed off when he failed to think of how to say what he wanted to say. Instead he bit his lip nervously.
The sickening squelching sound of the portal into the Empty opening made him turn around. And if possible, his heart sunk even deeper than it already had. Then the door to the room slammed open and Dean would have given everything, soul included, to stop time.
"Shouldn't he be fly boy?" Charlie piped up, thumb pointing into the flight attendants direction, and popped a potato chip into her mouth, munching away happily on it.
"You love me?"
. Am I right?"
about - at work. Especially not he, Castiel, who couldn't take all that so lightly to leave the matter behind once they had to work.
"Not on the job, Balthazar," Cas growled, making his friend blink in surprise. Someone sure was passionate about this conversation, as much as they wanted to pretend otherwise.
. Yeah, that worked.
a future.
"Dean, please." The words came unexpected. And they almost broke his so far iron will that kept him from tending to himself and leaving Cas to his fate. He knew that his lover needed the guidance now; he was too far gone to continue on his own, and Dean would never leave him hanging like this. But the words hit him, in places he didn't know such words were even able to reach, and Dean had to force himself to concentrate, which was not an easy feat in that moment.
"Or who I have to possibly bring another cup to. Just in case," he then found it in him to reply boldly, which earned him a surprised look and slight chuckle.
Castiel loved his job, but a flight full of demanding passengers was really no fun at all. Especially because this certain kind of airline guests always seemed to agree on taking the same flight, like the Association of Annoying Commuters went on a class trip or something. And when something broke. Something as vital as the coffee machine.
"Well... if there was something... something big... do you believe they'd be in for that. Either of them?"
Quick work was done with the bottle of lube once he had it - and it allowed him to do exactly what both he and the man who was currently at his mercy wanted: He waited another few seconds to make sure Dean was relaxed enough and then pressed the tip of his finger in.
"That doesn't sound like there's someone waiting for you at home."
"Good heavens, Cas, live a little! It's not like I want you to marry the guy! But like I said earlier, there's some tension in you that makes me worry you might snap sooner or later, and some relief won't be wrong. And if it is brought to you by someone who is easy on the eyes, with whom you can pretend?"
Despite his fear, and consequently his usual caution expressed by keeping his seatbelt on, he now unfastened the same and, murmuring an apology, at least had a good reason to remove Pamela's insistent hands from his body. He got up and quickly walked towards the back of the place.
"I was trying to help."
Or was it.
Dean wasn't big on botany and flora, but he appreciated beautiful surroundings as much as the next person, and he was continuously fascinated by what Mother Nature came up with. Jess had a green thumb, her and Sam's apartment a small oasis in itself, but even though she had often offered to show him a few tricks, Dean had never dared to actually risk having something living in his home, especially seeing as he wasn't there all the time.
"Of course, sir. You have a good rest and nice weekend."
Without waiting for an answer, he headed straight for the dresser and he took out a t-shirt and a pair of jeans that usually got ignored by Castiel. In fact, he didn't even know why he still packed them, this piece of clothing Balt had once convinced him to buy because it 'made his arse even prettier', as he had said. Surely he was not about to analyze the meaning of him still carrying it around all the time.
"So you live in California as well, then?"
"I'm really sorry, but I gotta go now."
, he wasn't falling for a passenger. A man he barely even knew. And who was off-limits according to company rules. And who he, in any ways, just might have pushed away verbally by inquiring about the usage of his name by Dean.
"What the hell are you talking about?"
"That sounds perfect," the other man replied, and smiled at him, and quickly squeezed his hand, his thumb gently brushing over the back, before he let go again.
"There's always something to tell with Baby. You usually don't shut up about her. Unless..."
"That's good to know. See you then!" And he left.
"I hope you have a great evening, Dean. See you on Monday."
"Oh no, Dean Winchester, you can't fool me. You've met someone, and apparently this someone has left quite the impression on you, too. So. Stop playing coy and give me details. Or you can walk the rest of the way."
home, whenever he left the airport to head down to San Carlos. And so far it had been great. But this day... this day, as he stood on the train, too agitated to sit down, dread filled his stomach with every passing stop, with every mile he got closer to Dean.
The shaking didn't stop. It went on and on, causing every muscle in his body to lock in place, even though he wasn't sure what that was supposed to achieve. He did it anyways.
"I found his hotel today."
"Really?"
," Castiel replied, and added a light teasing tone to the words he repeated off Dean. "Thank you, Dean, for your suggestions. I will make sure to have a closer look at them."
"Is that... is that new? I mean, how long have you known that you...?"
"I assume you are still angry at me." It was a simple statement, like there was nothing to it, and yet it bothered Dean like nothing else. Was he angry? Not quite. Was he confused? All the more so. It happened when your best friend touched your privates, even if it was with the best intention.
"Were good, thanks," she said for the both of them, all the while the airline employee only looked at Dean and ignored the woman next to him.
The wind danced around him as he slowly walked along the uneven pathway, and it reminded him of that breath of air that had always announced an angel's arrival. They were curious, these things you remembered when you were left alone and in peace with only your thoughts as your company, and when--
"I think we've establi--" A moan swallowed the words when Cas sucked the head of Dean's cock into his mouth. "Established that - you're killing me here, angel!"
"I know. I just wanted them to leave you alone. It's not like you can conjure up another coffee machine just like that. Broken is broken."
"I had an idea," he began, "How about we leave together? I have my car here at the airport; I could wait for you, then you wouldn't have to take a cab or the public transport."
And he was definitely not looking for suggestions from his colleagues. He should have known better than to ask.
"I'll keep that in mind and will head right down," he smiled back, signing the slip of paper Yanny had placed in front of him.
"Sure sounds fun."
"He has," Jess replied for Sam, and grinned winningly; then she bumped her hip against her new fiancée, a gesture Castiel was certain was meant to encourage the younger Winchester to speak.
"Cas? What is it? You're starting to scare me here, babe."
"Then he'll be gone and you'll find someone who wants and deserves you loving them. And loves you back." When Castiel failed to answer once again, Balthazar sighed and continued, "Okay, different question. What do you want?"
"I wasn't creepy, I had just..."
"You're hogging," Dean accused, and at the former angel's confused squint - which wasn't cute, not right now, shut up - elaborated with an exasperated sigh, "the blanket, Cas. You use it all up for yourself. That thing's too small for two grown men, I get another one."
"Good day, sir, and welcome to the Seaside Inn. How may I be of service to you today?" the man greeted, his voice warm, yet distant.
"No, Cassie, simple knowledge of human nature. But if you don't believe me, well, I might be pointing out the obvious here, but - there
make it work! I've been stupid often enough in the past, I won't be so stupid to let you go again!"
"Mhh?"
. Do you know how expensive that is?!"
"Was it in the drawer?"
"It'd be nice to sleep for a bit. And talk tomorrow. How does that sound?"
"Fun is much more welcome than...
"And what decision do you suggest I should make?" There was no pause after that. They both knew the answer - and unsurprisingly, Balt was not shy to put it into words.
"Hey idjit," a grumpy yet fond voice called out to him, breaking through his bewilderment, and Dean looked down to find their old friend sitting there, in a wooden armchair in the sun, a bottle of beer in his hand.
The result had been surprisingly few changes. Once the truth was out in the open... not much changed. Except for an arrangement or two. Nothing quite noticeable. At least as long as doors were properly closed, but that... well, that was another story and really not of importance right now.
"Says the man who hates flying. Besides, to go anywhere by plane you need money, Dean," Cas grumbled, trying and failing to give his lover an equally disgruntled look, instead letting himself be kissed again by insistent lips and a clever tongue. A hand came to rest on his waist as Dean turned fully towards his lover, then slipped up his side and finally around his shoulder to press him close as Dean deepened the kiss, effectively making Cas forget whatever he had wanted to be unhappy about.
"I won't, Dean, I promise. There'll be no more reason to leave," was the soft reply.
She also loved Dean's cooking and singing, and Cas reading stories to her; she got excited whenever Uncle Sam played airplane with her or had her in his arms in general, because it allowed her to see so much more than when she was with either of her fathers. She enjoyed cuddling with Aunty Jess and was always quick to fall asleep when Dean's sister-in-law carried her around, and the toys and colorful pictures Aunty Charlie showed to her always made her look at them with wide eyes and every now and then a mouth formed into an engrossed 'O.'
And Dean just couldn't stop himself anymore. Taking two quick steps towards the other man, he wound one arm around Cas' waist and the other around his neck to pull him close and press their lips together. It took the flight attendant a second and a surprised noise before his arms locked around Dean's body and his mouth opened in welcome.
However, when Dean wanted to pull Cas closer and get comfortable to sleep, the other man resisted, keeping a small distance between them as he faced his lover, tired blue eyes staring into green ones.
"I'm not!"
"No, but we do have talked about marriage and agreed that it's a definite possibility."
at him. If he doesn't want you I resign my status as expert for all things sex and romance." It merely took Castiel's raised eyebrow and doubtful look for his colleague to firmly add, "Yes, I have that!" However, before either was able to further discuss this issue, another service bell ring called Balthazar away.
"Not saying you haven't. The couple part? You're fabulous at that, from all I've seen and you've told me. But you do that whole relationship as you both believe it has to be done, because you've learnt it like this from watching others. You're unique though. Think about what you have, and what you want, and then try to bring those together."
"The name rings a bell..." she replied, a little vaguely, and a questioning tone included in it.
So he answered like he always did when it came to things he rather not dealt with - he dismissed it.
Several hundred miles away, the flight attendant dominating Dean's thoughts couldn't stop thinking himself. Time and again Castiel's mind went ruefully back to that Monday morning when he hadn't been able to say goodbye to Dean and wish him a nice week. He missed that last smile he had already gotten used to, those few kind words they shared; the verbal reassurance that soon enough, they'd meet again.
It didn't last long though; too exhausted they were from earlier, and anyways was food as source for strength just the thing they needed then, so some ten minutes later found them sitting next to each other, shoulders still touching as if it was impossible for them to be too far apart right now, and eating their unusual breakfast.
"Hey sweetheart, what's up? You really don't want your dads to get laid, huh?"
"Promise to leave you in peace with your misery, even if I don't approve," Gabriel nevertheless said and shrugged, pushing away from the counter he was leaning against and strolling into the now empty passenger area.
"Then I'm sure you have nothing to worry about. Some things can't be timed."
"Castiel? That's an... unusual name. But nice. Really very... you know... it sounds... beautiful." In tandem they blushed at Dean's words and stared at each other for a moment before Castiel added:
When he strode into the hotel lobby Dean spared a single, cautious glance towards the reception. Even though Cas had told him that Mr. Grumpy - Yanny he believed his name was, but their first encounter had left a lasting impression - was actually a nice guy and approved very much of their relationship, he was still not so sure. He knew the personnel did their best to assure the privacy of their guests, trying to keep away any visitors that weren't announced, and as much as Dean appreciated the sentiment, he really didn't need that confrontation right now. Even if Mr. Grumpy would let him pass - and possibly even without alerting Castiel - Dean couldn't be sure about the others.
his brother roll his eyes.
With bottle and cup in hand, Castiel returned to his cause of emotional confusion, intent on proving to himself and whoever else cared about that he was, indeed, a professional - smitten or not.
His friend didn't even answer. She just looked at him sympathetically and hugged him; and when she let go again, she just snagged the bag of chocolate chip cookies and the Xbox controller and pressed it into Dean's hands.
But it was true - he didn't notice the woman sitting next to him on his flight back to Detroit the next Monday, and, on top of that, especially didn't notice how beautiful she was. It was she who
"Good night, Dean," came the mumbled reply, before the line indeed went dead, and Dean was almost proud that Cas had still managed to answer.
"Because I have been listening to your stories about what he does and every little move he makes for two weeks and I think by now I know enough to hazard a guess on his opinion about you. And I'll be damned if that man is just nice to you because of his job."
"I thought you were… I mean, Bobby said, but… how did you…"
"My schedule changed. I'm in San Francisco now. At your apartment door, actually."
The first thing Castiel noticed when he woke up was that feeling of being cold, but in an unfamiliar way. It wasn't the way he felt when during the night he had kicked off his blanket and laid bare and open to the cool air; nor was it like when in winter months the dark hours turned out to be colder than expected and that low temperature had crept into the room.
When Balthazar entered Heaven's Door, Cas found himself spotted quickly. After a detour to the bar, at which Balt obviously ordered red wine, he approached his friend's table.
"I'm not in the mood--"
asked her, then?" Dean instantly remarked, his words not really a question, though he was gracious enough to let it at least sound like one.
He knew it was the right thing to do. He'd been a coward long enough.
"How romantic," Dean remarked, but there was no malice in his tone, just amusement. By now he knew his lover well enough to know he would not get such words wrong, words anyone else might just have taken as hurtful.
"But this is your career! I told you we'd make it work. Maybe we just have to try harder. Need a new strategy. But you can't just let it all go now. One day you will hate me because you gave up something you always wanted for someone like me." Cas didn't answer right away; he simply shook his head, staring at Dean with sadness in his eyes.
"Then I will anxiously await for the weekend to be over," Castiel replied, a lopsided smile painted into his features.
There was a moment between seconds, an easy-to-miss movement, a combination of leaning in and pulling close, and their lips touched, tentative and shy, as their bodies once more fell into each other. And just like their love had grown slowly over the years, their kiss as well was deepened without the need to rush, guided by feelings and the simple longing to be with each other.
"Cas," he breathed, and unbidden yet not unwelcome tears denied him a clear vision of the angel. "You're… here."
"Absolutely. He's totally adopted."
"Nope, just leave it Sammy, 'kay?"
The two men stared at each other for a long time then; not to see who blinks first, though, but in silent communication, and in confirmation that they understood each other. Neither of them wanted Castiel to get hurt, and Gabriel knew it as much as Dean. The passenger even appreciated the other man's concern for his friend; he knew he wouldn't have acted any different had this been about Sam. So he could relate to the sentiment; to Gabriel's protectiveness, especially if he saw Castiel as his little brother. Those needed to be kept an eye on, even if they were grown-up and standing on their own feet already; that much he knew all too well.
It had been a long, long time since Dean had last to endure the shaking of an aircraft while he was on it. If it had been his decision, it could have been a much longer time also. Unfortunately, no one asked him. So when the plane began to quiver and waggle in the turbulence the pilot had just announced - a notice Dean had very much tried to ignore, true to the motto,
"I promise, Jo."
He may have been mortified at the display - your own brother's private parts in the focus of attention of any situation was nothing the younger Winchester was happy to think about, but here they were - but at the same time it was also the most hilarious scene he had ever witnessed. Turning the deepest shade of red any person must ever have sported, Dean scrambled away from Cas' touch and, consequently, off the bed so fast that he actually ended up in a heap of his own tangled limbs on the floor.
"Good. Otherwise I'd have to kick your ass. Which would at least serve you to get from the airport to work, because I definitely wouldn't pick you up anymore then."
"No, it's all right, I know what they say." There was a sneaky little smile on Cas' face which told whole tales to his partner - who found himself enjoying it immensely. It was that side to Castiel no one else got to see; the one that showed that beneath all that innocence and, oftentimes, obliviousness, he was still a man who was aware of the finer details of human interaction, even if he didn't make use of it often. And that was huge fun.
"Found it," he announced when he returned to the bathroom, where Castiel meanwhile had gotten out of the tub and was just in the progress of wrapping Mary into a fluffy towel, which was rewarded by the little girl with a happy smile.
And now it was for Dean to prove to Castiel that what they had was another one of these good things.
"Yes, I'm fine, Yanny. And as for the name plate, I don't think that'll be either necessary or useful," he offered with a now tired smile, and took the key card Yanny handed him.
"No," Castiel shook his head, "you go, I have a meeting to attend before I can leave, and it wouldn't take too long now."
"Not until now," he replied to Dean's comment and pecked his nose while his hands were busy with the plastic bottle. "Also, I always thought that's what makes it interesting?"
"Perfect."
Because this man? This man was going to be his destiny.
"Something's off with you, lately. What is it, Cas?"
Dean remained quiet after that, simply pulling Cas closer and holding him. He could relate to that, somehow. That sense of freedom he felt whenever he was driving his Baby, it was unique and nothing his life could give him otherwise. It wasn't as if he didn't enjoy his life as it was, but there were restrictions and limitations he felt every day, something the Impala took away for a while.
Heaven, indeed.
It took the former angel a few minutes to return to their room; minutes Dean unashamedly used to cocoon himself in the remaining warmth of the heap of cover Cas had left behind.
"Do I want to know why you are so well informed about one particular passenger?" Castiel kept his tone carefully neutral, but Gabriel was not fooled. He knew his friend who was like a brother to him too well.
Castiel wasn't sure what to say. That didn't sound like a happy family at all - unless, of course, Dean was just joking and it was all harmonic and... But what he said sounded odd nonetheless. And apparently his face gave his irritation away, as Mr. Winchester first frowned, and then had realization dawn on his face.
"You know, if you need some distraction, we could always...
"And yet they exist for a reason."
"You went to Castiel even though you knew you wouldn't be able to stay?"
When he awoke the next morning, it was to a grey sky and raindrops drumming against the window pane of his room. He almost considered just staying in bed, ordering up breakfast and spending his Saturday reading; but weekends were short and he hated wasting time. After all, he had some suggestions from a certain passenger he really wanted to follow.
"I believe it is nice to have someone... anyone, really."
"Have a nice weekend?"
"I'm sure we'll know in a few seconds."
His room in some hotel close to the airport in San Antonio was nothing more than four white-turned-grey walls casing him in, and the quietness within reminded him more than ever of his loneliness.
It was even more because - what if this was one-sided? The intense missing, and the feelings that were behind it? They'd never talked about this. Sure, they were together, thought of themselves as a couple, but had they ever talked feelings? No. It was entirely possible that Cas was not in it for the long run. It was improbable, going by everything Dean knew about his partner, but... well, there was always a
"Not really, no. For the why, however... I'd quite like one to that."
Dean was halfway through his dish of toast, scrambled eggs and sausages when another fluttering sound made him freeze mid-chewing motion.
Being frustrated at least had one advantage: It brought out his sarcastic side, something that was very helpful when it came to dealing with his colleagues. Usually Castiel wasn't what one would call witty, his mind always stopping his mouth from talking before things weren't thought through. His politeness was, after all, his strongest suit. But over time he had learned to shut his brain up for short moments when he was in the presence of his friends and colleagues, something that was often enough rewarded with raised eyebrows and half-smirks of appreciation. He knew it was a patronizing gesture more than anything else, but at least it was something.
Dean had always known that he wasn't one for long-distance relationships. Granted, he had never thought he'd be one for a relationship, period, but then had he learned early on that life wasn't exactly predictable, or plan-able, as much as he wanted it to. And it wasn't as if this part - the whole relationship thing, having Cas in his life - was bad. The contrary, two-hundred per cent.
"Oh for the love of-- Cas!" Dean protested once again, much to the other man's delight, and ground his hips against his partner's, causing friction to both their erections and making them moan in unison. It also helped Castiel's finger find its destination, the tip of the digit rubbing over the puckered hole, smearing lube over it and letting Dean hiss in pleasure.
Now, though, as the man came to stand beside his seat, smiled at him, and asked him what he could do for him in a rough, rumbling voice that sent a whole different kind of turbulence and shock down his spine, Dean felt ready to believe that there was a purpose to his being on this flight, on a plane in general, other than his brother or his job.
The evening sun warmed their faces as they relaxed into comfortable silence, neither feeling the need to speak. What was there to say that could have been more important than savoring the closeness they shared in those moments.
"No. I'm not thinking anything, I... it's certainly not my place to judge, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have--"
There was a fluttering sensation in Dean's stomach at the thought that the flight attendant cared as much about it and their goodbye as Dean did himself. And so, not even half a minute later and when all the other passengers were gone, Balthazar turned and grinned at his colleague before leaving the two of them alone.
"To be fair, though, I am the person complaints should be directed at; seeing that usually I can solve them and a written one wouldn't do me or my colleagues any good."
Dean Winchester's feelings when boarding a plane and taking his seat were always the same: He was filled with an impending sense of doom. Flying was unnatural for humans, that much he had decided years ago already. Whoever had come up with the concept must not have been in their right mind.
past it. All of them. I'm sure Ash has been scarred for life. Mum and I had loads of fun though."
Staring into the cabin, he let his eyes roam over the passengers, all busy fixing their belts, talking to their neighbors, reading, or just waiting for the soon-to-come start. It was a curious mixture of people, old and young, casual and business, excited and unhappy and even grumpy. Since 8th Heaven didn't offer any Business or First Class seats, their planes' cabins created a passenger manifest that was quite unusual, and always fascinating to Castiel. Even more so if there were especially interesting people on board. Like, for instance--
He didn't quite expect the other man to pull back suddenly, though. Confused he watched as Dean got up and quickly shed the remaining piece of his clothing, then almost roughly pulled off Castiel's underwear as well, leaving them both finally naked. The flight attendant shuffled a little to the side when his lover crawled onto the bed again, where he fell down on his back next to the other man, and unceremoniously spread his legs wide, pulling them back with his arms around his knees so that he was open and exposed, something he seemingly didn't mind at all.
Should he be honest? Should he tell Dean that it wasn't great at all, because it meant that he'd barely get to see him anymore? Should he take that first step before Dean could, in vain hope that it'd protect his heart at least a bit? Should he say they could just as well call whatever that was between them a quits? Sure, 'whatever that was between them' run deep, that much was undeniable. But was it enough? And moreover, if he declared now that he would turn down the job offer, just so he could be with Dean - would he scare the other man off?
Introducing Castiel to his brother, to-be sister-in-law, and his best friend went much better than Dean had expected. Not that he had expected problems to begin with, but the three apparently fell in love with him at first sight.
"Cassie?"
to try it. Never had the right partner, maybe. But with Cas... His lover was vocal, and the noises he made alone enough already to bring Dean to the brink. But even without the sounds he was making, even without that wonderful voice, thick and dark with arousal, coming from the speaker of his phone, Dean realized with a start that he would have done it anyways. As long as he was able to do something good for this man he...
"I don't understand." Dean opened his mouth, but snapped it closed right away.
Because of one Castiel Shurley.
He was not prepared for what happened next.
"You look a bit pale, sir. Are you all right? Can I bring you a glass of water? Or would you prefer tea?"
He...
Still, there was this strange twinge in his heart, as if something was missing. Someone.
No, this was different. This was...
"I'm very sorry, I hope I can help solve it somehow?"
"In bed."
Dean had always been someone who cared first and foremost about the pleasure of his lovers, and not his own. Because if his bed partners had fun and a good orgasm afterwards, he was assured he'd get the same.
Cas wouldn't understand. Bloody angels and their beginner's level knowledge about basic human behavior. He sighed and pinched the bridge between thumb and forefinger.
There was something he had to tell him, and he wasn't all that sure it was going to be received all that kindly. Not that he was exactly scared of his lover's reaction; they'd known each other maybe not long enough, but they sure knew each other well enough for Cas to not worry about any kind of violent reaction from the other man. If anything, Dean was going to be accepting and supportive.
"Yeah, that's true," Castiel admitted, then shrugged his shoulders, indicating that he rather change the subject. "So is there anything else I can do for you?"
With his pelvis resting snug against Dean's, Castiel experimentally rocked forward a few times, causing friction to his own cock as he moved slightly inside his lover, but also to the man beneath him, whose erection was now trapped between their bellies. And Castiel knew exactly how
But the worst part was - he couldn't even be angry at himself. He should have been; should have taken it as a lesson learned the hard way, as something that would forever be a warning to him, a red flag whenever he even considered doing it again. And maybe it was, to some extent; but as far as Dean was concerned... if he had a time machine, if he had been able to turn back these hours spent with that man - he would do it all again. Because this... this had been special, no matter how it had turned out in the end.
Castiel breathed heavily, his fingers digging into Dean's shoulders, as he slowly rose his head to look at Dean.
"You've taken a fancy to a passenger, haven't you?"
"No, Dean," Castiel interrupted, almost a bit too forceful, before he continued in a softer voice, "it's okay, I have a reservation at the Seaside Inn, so I'll just stay there. You don't have to come back now. You won't get a flight before tomorrow and I will be leaving Sunday at noon again anyways."
"Don't do this, Cas," he begged. He didn't ask, didn't suggest. He begged, and hell, he would have fallen to his knees doing so if he had thought it could have changed anything.
"Looked him up after he continued to show up on our flights," he shrugged, "thought the knowledge might come in handy, which it now has, apparently. But don't worry, Cassie - you know he's not my type. Bit too male for my taste." Winking, the older flight attendant turned away to snag the snack basket he'd just refilled and place it on the tray wagon.
For the first time in his life, Cas believed he understood what family meant. And that he never again wanted to miss it.
, Balthazar."
There was a dagger formed out of the words he really hadn't wanted to hear right now, and it found a new home in Castiel's heart. Of course would a man who chose to fly on a regular basis despite his anxiety have a very good reason for it. And what else was such motivation than traveling between work and the place where loved ones lives? This Dean Winchester probably had a beautiful wife and the statistical two children and, going by the looks of the man, adorable ones also. Sometimes Castiel forgot that normalcy was still defined in families of man, wife, and children, not loner male flight attendants and worldly, outgoing business men.
"Angel, you sure know how to turn a guy on."
Dean took a moment to look into her dark eyes, filled with mischief and wit, an attractive sight surely, on several accounts. He grinned then, leaning in a bit himself.
They seemed to be everywhere at once. Roaming his back and kneading his shoulders, trailing down his chest and stomach, firmly grabbing his ass cheeks through hindering fabric and rubbing and rolling his nipples to sensitive attention.
"How can you want to... to... throw away something you've been working for and dreaming of so long?!"
"And who are you to intrude on things that are absolutely none of your concern?!"
His tired bones and muscles carried securely, Castiel allowed himself to close his eyes as he lay on his back, drifting on the surface and feeling as if he was surrounded by silk gently lapping at his skin as his presence and the pump moved the water enough to cause little waves moving back and forth within their tiled boundaries.
"That means though that you still have to meet the eggheads in there, you know that, right?" And Castiel let out a laugh that had never felt more liberating.
Moving above Dean, Cas reached for the lube and slicked his cock and Dean's entrance up with a generous amount of the clear liquid. He stole another quick kiss from the other man's lips before he locked his eyes with him and at the same time brought the head of his erection to his lover's hole, gliding over it a few times and then slowly pressing in.
So while Sam returned Cas' greeting cheerfully, Dean merely let out a sound that came, interestingly enough, he noticed, close to being a growl.
He was flying. And to him, it was the most perfect feeling in the world.
Castiel was sure minutes had passed before the other man finally spoke.
"Our shift starts at 7.15 tomorrow. I have to get up at five. This is not the right day to go out, Balthazar," Castiel tried to argue, only half-heartedly trying to push his friend's hands away as they began to undress him.
"I don't even know if he's interested!"
Because sometimes the only wings you needed was the weightlessness that the feeling of being happy and loved brought into your life.
"Yes." More Castiel didn't have in him, but the smile he added to the word told Dean everything he couldn't put into words right now.
"Real estate. Won't bore you with the details, though... Would rather like to know who allows me the luck of having you next to me?"
"Sure, always for you, Cassie. When and where?"
"You're not actually thinking..."
"Not quite the kid I imagined us to have one day, but there you go," Sam chuckled, and patted Cas on the back.
Charlie was right. He had never thought he would once have a relationship. For more than thirty years, this had never been something he took into consideration with any of his affairs; not even those he saw several times and got along with really well.
"You know full well I didn't mean it like this. But you have to do something. Something more than just ask for his name. If you like that guy - which you obviously do - try to find out if he likes you, too. And for the record, my money's on
And Dean knew better than to argue with his lover when he was tired because he had been woken in the middle of the night. Some mistakes he just didn't make twice.
"No. No, that's not it, it's just... well, yes, sort of. It's complicated."
Now it was too late. He couldn't just announce he'd give up his work, stay at home, get a less demanding job, but at least be there whenever his partner came back. It would make him make look desperate, and if he knew one thing, then that desperation and, consequently, the dependence behind it, was even more of a death sentence for a relationship, any kind really, than being apart all the time.
Eventually, they arrived at their motel room, with the younger Winchester having long since given up commenting on Dean's protest every time they drove over a bump in the road. Which of course and just for the record, had nothing to do with a certain injury, but instead
He had no idea what exactly he was asking for; but he also could never have guessed it was what found him on this early April day after a rainy, unspectacular weekend that saw him head back to work...
Another step. And one more after that. Carry on and be happy with what you are given.
"You're gonna come back later than planned, right? Like that time when you were in South Africa?"
For a dead man, his heart was still able to beat quite fast, Dean noticed. Could it really be...?
"I..." Dean began, confused, but when he looked into the other man's face, he realized that there was something else to it. "Yes, of course, thank you," he so said, believing that the person waiting for him, this colleague to explain the 'phone' to him would be Castiel. Nothing else made sense anyways; even more so since he hadn't seen his flight attendant for a while.
"Dean...?" Snapping out of his musings, Dean scrambled to get his thoughts back on track - bring himself back to that man on the other end of the line who waited for further instructions.
"Are you kidding?!" he bit out. "She was freaking me out with all her handsiness, but what do you want me to do?! I can't just get up and take another seat, especially since that plane is fully booked!" As an afterthought, he added, "And stop calling me Dean-o!"
"Dean, I... we need to talk." Instantly, his partner's eyes narrowed with worry.
Dean didn't seem to mind, though. He climbed over Castiel to come to hover above him, and entwined their fingers, thus keeping the flight attendant's hands securely and immovable next to his head, while he ducked down to follow the path his palms and digits had taken before, kissing and licking down Castiel's neck, chest, stomach, as far as their locked hands would allow.
"Yes, Dean. I'm fine," he thus replied, smiling warmly and taking the object of offense from him. Within seconds he had cracked the seal, and squirted a bit of the clear substance onto his hand, before he handed the bottle back and boldly let his hand sneak down their bodies and into the other man's briefs, where his wet hand closed around Dean's cock.
"But will you be here then?"
"Heya, Cassie. What's up? You're making yourself scarce lately," Balt opened when he answered, sounding slightly out of breath.
"Nonsense. Enjoy yourself, take what you can get, and be happy about it. There are no rules here, Cassie. After all, you and frequent flyer loverboy are not exclusive yet. Hell, there isn't even a 'you and' when it comes to the both of you. So, until that changes, I suggest you use the time to get back in the saddle." With a waggle of his eyebrows and a salacious grin, Balthazar added, "Especially when it's a saddle like
Castiel had the strong urge to kick himself. He would have, if it had been possible. It wasn't though - he knew, because yes, he had tried. Groaning quietly and shaking his head, he turned back to the galley to finish up his work, and almost collided with Balthazar when he rounded a corner.
Dean's instinct also pulled and crushed the angel against his own body, and made him claim the lips of his best friend.
"Dean?"
"Woah," was her only verbal reaction when she finally found her voice again, after the car behind her made her snap out of it with the help of a hearty honk.
When he came to stand before the door that had 8-20 written in golden digits on it, he took a deep breath, willing the excitement in his belly to stop making him all giddy, before he knocked twice, and a third time after letting three seconds pass - their more or less secret sign.
Nothing else needed to be said after that; Balthazar's little stab was an agreement nonetheless, and the forces pulling at them as the plane set off to start had them shut up anyways.
"That's probably because you are." Turning around to Dean then, Cas added, "I'm really happy to see you," and his was voice quite and laced with shy uncertainty.
"What? You kill me and make it look like an accident?"
"I am whatever I want to be. And… wherever I want to be." Even a Dean Winchester couldn't miss the emphasis put on that
With careful steps, Dean approached the glass door, already catching a glimpse of something tan-colored through the windows, and a lump formed in his throat. So it really was true.
The doorbell rang just as he had hung up the phone. And really, after that conversation he wasn't in the mood for visitors. He wanted to be alone; he wanted to be
He had noticed him before, of course he had. It was hard to miss that man, for that beautiful face alone. Still, as the passenger so far had been very quiet and unobtrusive, Castiel hadn't had any contact with him yet, aside from probably at one point the obligatory greeting and farewell before or after a flight. He hadn't paid much attention to him either, apart from his short moments of staring when little breaks in his routine allowed him to.
"I'm really looking forward to that trip," Cas said, a sigh in his voice as he repeated the words for probably the fifth time that morning. Dean only chuckled, rolling his eyes good-naturedly.
"I never thought I'd ever say this about a flight, but - that was a very enjoyable one. And all thanks to you, Cas."
"Not when you're on the receiving end of it," was the answer he got, a whiny note in the other man's voice, as Castiel was just the progress of pushing Dean's boxer briefs out of the way and letting his fingers roam over the firm globes he found beneath. A single finger strayed tauntingly between the cheeks and towards the entrance Dean was awaiting - and demanding - him to touch, but Castiel still held back, only came close, but never made contact.
This time, the smile was warm and truly happy when Dean replied quietly, "Any time." Then he was gone.
"Wow, you have it bad."
Shrugging and shaking his head, Cas remained quiet for a short while, sorting his thoughts. There wasn't actually anything to say to that. They'd never talked about it. End of story. He liked what they had. And he knew that Dean was - had been - more of a one night stand, no-feelings-involved kind of guy. What if he told the truth - said those words that so often changed so much, while at other times they were simple confirmation for something that had always been clear anyways - and it did change something? And not for the better, because while they were so good together, Dean still saw them as nothing more than, as it was called these days, friends with benefits? Of course, he had introduced him to his family and all, but was that really indication for anything?
, as Jo called it, he couldn't wait to deal with.
Sam could have counted down the seconds just by watching Dean's expression shift, and then said together with his brother what he knew was coming. With the difference that, no surprise there, Dean rolled his eyes and growled in disapproval first - just for good measure - before exclaiming with way more drama than necessary, "Alright, alright, do it." Not, however, without turning a nice shade of red, as the younger Winchester noticed. Apparently the thought of Cas using his healing powers that way, even without touching him, was enough to make Dean all flustered. And he didn't want to think about why this sounded all wrong.
"Yeah, got it," he dismissed and tried to squeeze past the flight attendant in the small passageway, but Gabriel wasn't finished yet. His face turned dead serious - an expression Dean didn't have expected him to even know - before he spoke again, all cheerfulness gone from his voice.
The phone was picked up on the third ring. Unusual for someone who claimed to always have their phone close by in case 'some arrangements for the night came up on short notice, the caller shouldn't have the chance for second thoughts.' Not that Castiel was such a candidate.
"You had
And it was with
"Well, uh... I was... of course when I'm serving you, I..." For some reason Castiel felt as if he had 'creepy stalker' written all over his face, and it was making him self-conscious enough that all he wanted was flee the scene. He couldn't though, could he? He had a job to do. And he'd be damned if he didn't make good use of any second of that job right now.
"I think we've managed pretty well so far," Dean defended, not quite sure what his friend wanted to tell him. He and Cas were great together - what else could they do to become even better? Was it even possible? Perhaps there was this problem of them being apart all the time due to their jobs, but really, that wasn't their fault. It wasn't as if they could just quit.
"And I still don't know why I even told you that," Cas sighed while pulling out the drawer right next to him and fishing out the refill package, "this was definitely the last time I did. A kiss is not a promise of marriage or something. Besides, who says anymore than Dean being nice to her now will happen between them?"
"Sure thing," the stranger purred, eyes still focused on Castiel, and left not without throwing a brilliant smile at his guest.
"Dean, where the hell are you? We're waiting for you!" his brother said by way of a greeting.
Meeting Castiel, getting to know him, it was showing Dean how it could be. Even if they had only had one night with each other so far; but Cas was someone he could talk to, someone who was intelligent and a kind and gentle soul. He was the kind of person Dean believed he would be willing to try more with, to try and make it work with; the kind of person he... he could fall in love with.
Jack had done them proud. The boy they had raised together, he, Sam and Cas, had taught about life and love and family. The boy who was now out there, righting the wrongs, and doing it instinctively perfect.
"So you're basically our angelic sheriff?" Dean laughed good-naturedly at the thought, even more so as Cas frowned and raised a doubtful eyebrow.
Deciding that a change of scene couldn't hurt all that much and he could always go back to the hotel if he had enough, he - still grudgingly - put on the jeans and the t-shirt, and let the other man pull him out of the hotel room.
"Isn't it always. I thought it was all good and happy and so on with you two."
to each other, apart from their passenger/flight attendant conversations on the plane. Even if those had been more private than any such talk should ever be, they still were strangers in most respects.
There was a nearness he couldn't quite explain; nor was he able to understand it. As they rocked together, desperately heading for their climaxes, they clung to each other, Dean's hands finding purchase on Cas' shoulder blades as if he tried to hold on to his angel's non-existent wings, and Cas cradling Dean's head in his hands, while his lips by now were just resting against his lover's, to kiss whenever they felt like it. And they felt like it a lot.
still very, very good - but when time was short, one had to find priorities, and those didn't lie in carnal needs.

is not normal."
were going to end.
"So are you staying at a nice hotel?" He was just going to pretend that question was as innocent as he wanted it to sound. No reason to consider that there was information to gain here, valuable information, and if it was freely given, it might just ease one or another insecurity.
His parents' house.
Dean breathed in the fresh forest air and smiled.
a car--"
Cheers and clinking glasses expressed the approval of the older Winchester words' in the following, as did the hugs the other three gave the flight attendant. Dean watched it all with an increasing warmth surrounding his heart, his very being, that was so alien to him that at first he didn't even know what it was. And when he eventually recognized it, he didn't quite dare to believe it.
