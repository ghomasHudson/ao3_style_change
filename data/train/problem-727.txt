As he stepped out into the blank expanse of cement on the deserted roof of St Bart’s hospital Sherlock’s sense of calm wavered at the edges. Everything was in place. But Moriarty’s unpredictability seemed to be the only predictable thing about him.
“I’m sorry to hear that as well.”
There’s a pause while they both contemplate the back of the chairs in front of them. John watches as Sherlock shifts himself slightly in his seat, his long limbs trapped in a space not designed for them.
“And you’re ‘shipping out’?” The stranger says the words as if quoting them,
“Yes.” Sherlock’s reply is instant; his face a picture of confusion. “Why?”
She nodded and went back to her work. He turned to leave.
John can’t listen any longer.
“You should wear that nice scarf of yours dear,” Mrs Hudson replied, “The weather is turning,”
“Mrs Hudson!” Sherlock called as he closed the front door behind him with a thump.
“Yes, though frankly the whole thing was a bit more complicated than I would have given him credit for. No DNA evidence, no fingerprints, place had been wiped clean.”
Sherlock remained silent, his mouth working but no suggestions presenting themselves. His floundering was so uncharacteristic that it had her look back at him.
John comes back to himself in the kitchen. Two mugs for tea on the countertop.
“Perhaps,”
“What do you mean?”
“Look, she’s left us a lot of sh… stuff to sort out,” The receptionist said lifting his eyes back to them and not answering his question, “I’m swamped.”
There’s a sickening noise as knuckles collide with cheekbone.
A smile on his face.
“I’m sorry Sir,” She replied, “I can’t let you see him.” She continued, exactly as she had the first time. This time she followed it with: “Your name isn’t on the list.”
Before he can say a word however a memory appears in John’s mind, brought about by the sight of Sherlock’s face sitting so close to his right elbow.  Suddenly he can feel the smooth skin of Sherlock’s cheek beneath his fingertips, smell the scent of his skin, taste the swell of his lips. Had that really…?
“She was quite taken with you,”
“Well,” She breezes, “This really has knocked him sideways. Not like him to go about expressing his feelings.”
“Yes.”
“Don’t ever die on me again Sherlock.”
“Yes,” Sherlock sounds almost impressed.
“You’re not a suspect.” A deep voice offers behind him.
His eyes fall closed again at the realisation and he takes a moment to do a mental assessment of the aches and niggles in his body. Ribs broken, he notes through the pain in his breathing, head sore, throat dry but all limbs seemingly present and correct.  He tenses his fingers and toes to make sure, noticing his right hand seems weighted down; he has to crack his eyes again to look down at it.
“Of course I know what Snapchat is,” Sherlock leaned back over the bannister, squinting, then started back down the stairs.
“I’m not badgering,” The man he called Sherlock tells him calmly.
“You don’t believe it?”
I haven’t told you how it feels to look at you across a room. The shattering recognition of everything I admire.
“I…” Sherlock can’t find any words of defence.
“So,” John pauses, waiting for further information. “Whereabouts?” He asks when nothing is forthcoming.
There are voices in the room as John emerges from unconsciousness again. Arguing voices.
For a long moment Sherlock watches him and John wonders whether he’s misread the situation completely.
“I suppose there’s no harm in taking a round-a-bout route.” Sherlock concludes.
“Well then,” John sighs, “We didn’t cover talking people down from ledges between appendectomies.”
The kind of club that John wouldn’t admit to occasionally frequenting if any of the guys in his unit were to ask.  Not that they would, John thinks, what happens on leave, stays on leave. Seventy two hours of heady freedom. Freedom from drills and uniforms and the hot, faceless monotony of his Hippocratic burden. John has intended to take advantage of every moment of it. Which explains why he’s here; shirtless amid a throng of throbbing bodies; moving in strobe against a soundtrack of drum and pop.
“No, why? Is he dead?” She asked brightly.
“She lives here?”
“Exactly that.”
“No. You took it out on the mug.”
“And the plates.” Sherlock confirms.
Sherlock breaks the silence. Voice low: “I’m not dead.” A summation.
“No, I’m not sure you did.”
“I’ve not spoken to him yet,” John again, “I’ve not spoken to anyone, they don’t know about Mary.”
“What?” He asked, in the face of her scrutiny.
“I clean the table!” Molly cried, punching him softly on the arm.
On the other end of the line Detective Lestrade paused a second too long.
“Have you been talking to the nurses?” John asks,
“I,” John stammers, unsure, “I heard there was someone up here.”
“Oh, that, no…” John starts,
“Enough for him to visit.”
“Hampstead.” And Sherlock puts a place to the name.
“That was why I joined up, at first,” John said slowly, “The money. We didn’t have a lot growing up, I had no way of supporting myself, so it made sense. They put me through medical school.” He was studying his beer bottle as he talked in a manner that implied he was revealing more than he was comfortable maintaining eye contact for, “Now I know it wasn’t just a means to an end, it suits me.”

“No…” John replies immediately,
“I see, dear,” She replied, not seeing, but Sherlock was already gone. She caught up with him as he was placing the box on top of the empty desk in the empty sitting room upstairs.
John backs away a little at that, contemplating the question.
“This is Angelo,” She offers to John, her gaze flicking between the two of them. “Angelo and I have known each other forever.”
They meet in a park.
“A consulting criminal?” Lestrade blustered. He really did have an irritating habit of repeating the words Sherlock said back to him as if they were somehow surprising.
“Coffee.” The man says without polite preamble, aiming his words at the pretty female attendant poised above them wearing a pale but enthusiastic smile. “Black, two sugars,” A pause, “Please.”
“Nope.” The receptionist popped the ‘p’ in a manner familiar to Sherlock.
“I don’t know.” He answers honestly, after a while. “Am I supposed to remember you?”
“Yes.”
Lestrade paused, took a breath. Applauded himself for his spectacular show of restraint.
In a blur Mary had left again, crossing the room to greet a nurse coming towards her as if they were long lost relatives.
“Cause and effect…”
“You’ve moved back in then.” John says, stunned.
“So,” John offers in greeting as he rounds the flimsy wall of curtain in a treatment room. “Good afternoon, Mr…?”
“I had my reasons,”
John couldn’t breathe.
“Hardly,” John huffs “You had me worked out within minutes of sitting down,”
A stunned silence.
“Okay,” John replied with more confidence than he felt.
“It’s my stag night. I can’t believe it’s my stag night. Sometimes I wonder how I ever found myself in this position. But Mary. She’s, she’s
“Yes.”
He tried not to think of that John too often, despite knowing now what he looked like. The way his uniform fit him, the brightness of his smile, the precise military shaping of his hair around his skull.
“It’s not an infallible science.”
“Yes.”
“There is still a certain margin of error. People aren’t as uncomplicated as I used to think.”
"What way?” John asks. Feeling, rather than seeing, the shift in the bench as Sherlock stretches out, selfishly taking all the space. “The ‘being thrown in a cell and letting your mate make a fool of himself’ way?”
Sherlock paused before replying, studying John’s face with that singular focus, before stepping a single pace forward.
“I’d prepared for if I had to die,”
“We can’t all have family money,” John gestured back at the house,
“While you were dead?” It’s not often that such a sentence can be spoken, never mind with the lightness that John applies to it.
“Yeah,” John said tentatively, as if trying out the thought.
“He’s…” He can hear Sherlock say. Not at him. Then he closes his eyes.
John contemplates him.
“Who has the most peculiar taste in hair colour.”
“Mother listed on her medical record. We’re struggling to get in contact.”
“Do what?”
“John?” His sister’s voice however is less sure,
“I was out.”
He sighs as he sits, not really expecting anything from the kitchen. Then, miraculously, the sound of the kettle being filled, then the button being pushed.
The mugs are heavy in his hands as he carries them through into the sitting room. Through to the books and the papers and the notes of the sitting room. The chaos and the mess.
“Close by?”
Then on some unspoken agreement both sprang into action, turning and striding as one back to the embankment. As they rushed back to land Lestrade raised the radio he was holding to his mouth:
“You knew he would though,” She says and John flicks his eyes up to her, remembering a cold room and his laughter: his complete confidence in the fact that Moran had given himself away just by speaking to Sherlock. Perhaps Mrs Hudson really can read minds.
“How long were they missing?” John asks Sherlock quietly, without looking at him.
“If you’re coming out for a smoke, don’t step on me.” John clarified, still not turning to look at him.
“Sherlock!” She cries as she sees him, and John has to admit that everything he’s heard about him up until this point seems to make a little bit more sense.
“Why?” Sherlock ignores him.
“Yes, party, starts at six,”
“You took in my appearance and the value of my clothing, as well as the fact that I am keen to remain unnoticed when travelling with strangers and deduced I held some kind of commercial fame. An actor perhaps?”
The stranger ignores the question, leaning to shut down the computer and replying calmly:
Wary, Sherlock didn’t react.
It didn’t work.
“Your shift is over.” Sherlock doesn’t frame it was a question.
“Those three people aren’t the only ones who care about me.” Sherlock continued, the noise above growing, drowning out the sounds of London below. Sherlock had to raise his voice to be heard: “You forgot someone.”
“Like green ladders?”
“You’ll be here when I wake up?”
“Sherlock,” John cuts him off, “I think I need to say this.” John sighs slowly, girding himself. “Because I never got to before and I regretted that. But it wasn’t until all this that I realised exactly what it was I wanted to say.” A pause, Sherlock doesn’t move to interrupt; John takes a moment to re-order his thoughts and starts again: “You were the only thing that made sense to me when I was dreaming.” Another pause, “I see that now. You may also be the only thing that’s made sense to me since I woke up, in a strange way.” A breath, “Such a lot has happened. And such a lot hasn’t happened. And you were there, through all of it.” John stops suddenly, a breathy laugh: “Well, except when you were dead.”
“Beer? Wine? Punch?” She asked.
The doctor moves forward, offering another question, producing a pen light from the top pocket of his scrubs and flashing it across Johns eyes, then asking another, touching the cold end of his stethoscope to John’s chest, then another and another.
“I’m sorry?”
“Married. Working. Hospital.”
Key in the lock, front door swinging open. Feet on the hallway floor.
“Tomorrow.”
Sherlock hummed, an acknowledgment of his name. Continued his pacing.
He pauses, John lifts his eyebrows to indicate that he should continue.
“You…” So far nothing in this conversation seems to have made any sense to her, “You can’t.”
A full three seconds passed as John stood in the beam of her gaze, before finally she seemed to process the information he’d provided.
“It was handled quietly.”
“He’s afraid.”
“Mrs Hudson I can’t find my phone.”
“You’re a doctor?” Sherlock feigned surprise.
They watch each other silently, John wondering quite where it will go from here. Until Sherlock nods slowly, a single tip of the head.
“How?”
John looks between them both. Memories waking, impossible ones.
John remains unmoving, not wishing to alert them to the fact he’s awake. They are speaking without care to the volume of their voices, unconcerned about disturbing him. John wonders idly what that means.
Glancing behind him to make sure John’s retinue were far enough away Sherlock moved forward toward the bench they’d all been crowded beside. On it was a battered old paperback, forgotten.
“Doctor Price.” Sherlock supplies, John savours the name for a second. “You remember her?” Sherlock asks.
If John didn’t know better he would wonder whether the sore feeling in the back of his throat was the threat of tears. The only thing John can think of to do against it is to lean forward and touch their lips together.
“Ok Sir,” She says calmingly, forgetting his earlier instruction “But, you see,” She pauses, “Where I’m confused is that Fleet Street isn’t on the Bakerloo line?”
“But I would have known.”
“But you have an idea?” John looks over at him, suddenly hopeful.
The other two boys follow her out obediently.
“Full confession.”
Sherlock found, therefore, that he had all the time in the world to comply with John’s written request to be at Victoria station on Friday morning. He even managed to convince himself that filling his sudden abundance of free time was the only reason he wanted to go.
He contemplated his options carefully, turning back to look at the neatly made bed again.
The evening passed by pleasantly. She told him about where she had grown up and her reasons for becoming a nurse. They fell easily into gossip about colleagues, stories from the hospital: that time so-and-so played a prank on whatshisname and how drunk thingamabob had been at that thing they went to. They laughed their way through his retelling of a story from med school and she discussed her reasons for favouring Thai food over Vietnamese.
John opens his eyes, rolling his head along the wall to face Sherlock beside him. Somehow he’s not surprised to find a pair of gunmetal eyes staring back him. Expressionless. Lost.
John stares back at him with a sense of peculiar unreality. This man looks nothing like the Mike Stamford he knew at Bart’s.
They meet on the South Bank.
“You didn’t think you’d be out here for long.” Sherlock deduces.
John stands behind a familiar man in a dark suit. He’s facing away from him, arm raised at right angles to his skinny frame to aim the gun he’s holding at a figure some distance away.
John had been visiting a friend. They’d been for lunch around the corner and John had offered to walk her back to the office. She’s pretty; beautiful green eyes.
“That didn’t happen.” Sherlock says.
The party continued and Sherlock stayed quietly on its peripheries. A drink had been offered to him as he arrived and though he’d accepted it more as a disguise than anything else, he’d found that he’d enjoyed it more than he’d expected. He sought out a second.
“We didn’t see you.” John pauses, thinking, studying. “How long have you been just on the edge of things?”
“Time to introduce myself properly. You’ve seen my work, naturally.”
“You want specifics,” Sherlock confirms, not a question.
“Do you know where you are?” He asks softly and John finally has chance to consider his surroundings: the same hospital room, no light through the distant window this time, just the sterile tungsten glow of the overhead bulb.
They meet in a country inn.
Sherlock’s fingers traced across the back of John’s hand, not the first time he’d touched him but so much more intimate than a handshake.
He reached in.
“That might be the first time you’ve agreed on anything.”
“It’s good to be home.” John says slowly in the face of the memory.
“Bribery certainly isn’t beautiful.”
Tense.
The room on the other side was brighter and busier than he had ever seen it. Doctors and nurses moved to and fro, their green gowns and masks obscuring their faces and blurring their outlines against the dull green walls.
Silence.
“She will?”
“Too bad.” John took a swig from his beer, prompting Sherlock to look down at his own as if remembering he was still holding it. “I was going to bum one.” John continued.
Sherlock slows, leaning down to run the tip of his tongue across the soft inside of John’s ear:
“I hoped.”
“I didn’t even know you had a brother,” Mrs Hudson fusses,
They’re looking at each other now, eyes locked across a room. The intensity of Sherlock’s gaze disarming.
It had taken him a little while to adjust his thinking, the reference in the first letter being such an obvious link between this correspondent and the case he was investigating. But John had failed every test, taken every word of Sherlock’s at face value, and even offered evidence of his own: the skull, the snow. As much as it pained him to have been wrong, once you eliminated the impossible then the only thing that remained…
“Since last night.” She says calmly, an air of understanding. “I sent Sherlock home; he’s worn out, poor lad.”
“I think I probably did.”
John smiles, “No I mean are you going to be in the North for long?”
“No. I am,”
“It was?” Sherlock seems surprised.
“You’re a hard man to find.” A familiar deep voice puffs hot breath into the crook of John’s neck, mouth grazing sensitive skin. John closes his eyes to savour the sensation.
“John,” The figure on the table suddenly turns to look at him, voice softer, the motion of his lips matching the word.
“You aren’t wearing a coat.”
“What?!” He asked the moment it was to his ear.
John pushes it toward him without thought, realising as he does so that he’s somewhat shown his hand; now the stranger cannot fail to realise that he is watching.
“And we need to talk to the brother because?” Lestrade asks Sherlock.
“2008?” John asked himself out loud,
Hadn’t.
A voice behind him caused John to spin around in surprise, he’d heard no one come into the room.
“You’re going to get it,”
“He was standing beside her in the photograph.” Sherlock.
From his pocket he produced a crumpled piece of receipt paper, holding it aloft so Moriarty could see. Moriarty looked at it in confusion.
Something shifts in the stranger’s face and he sits forward a little, continuing.
“Because it’s still unacceptable. They don’t realise your value.”
Something in this seems to get through to him. Sherlock turns his whole body slowly on the ledge; John can’t help but be fixated on slim dark shoes shifting so close to the void.
“Don’t be stupid John.”
It had been a week since his last call from Lestrade, and a lot longer than that since it had been regarding anything interesting.
She eyed them warily.
“Er, no,” He aims at the uniformed woman in the aisle, automatically fishing in his pocket for his phone and thereby wordlessly answering his companion to the opposite effect, “Nothing for me thanks.” He continues to her, casually handing over one of the most expensive and personal items he owns to a man he hasn’t known for more than ten minutes.
Silence again.
“Good.” Sherlock said when he’d finished, the closest he came to praise. “Meet me there in an hour.”
“You have a website?” Johns asks, feeling faintly ridiculous.
“Ridiculous.”
John can’t help but smile at this man who seems to know so much about people, without knowing anything at all. “So how did you know?”
“Mrs Hudson!” Sherlock bellowed,
“John,” Sherlock says soothingly.
“Yes,” John agrees, thinking back, wondering when it was he had assumed it was a book. “Well, I might have to look it up sometime.”
! And the café, downstairs, no message. The phone. And Mrs Hudson came home, and she said. She said… And the plates,”
“I’d probably agree with you there.” John says.
They meet at an airport.
“Kept.”
John is drowning in the feeling of holding him. He pulls him down with him, desperate and clinging, so that they both end up on the floor, on their knees amid the mess. John can feel the warmth of that marble face. The blood rushing beneath the surface. Can hold Sherlock’s thoughts in his hands and the taste the shape of the words he has said.
“Why are we going through all this again?” John asks him finally, emerging from his study of the memories he finds etched into familiar features.
“I promise.”
“But you have it worked out now?”
“What? No.” Sherlock is taken aback. “Don’t be ridiculous.”
Sherlock can only look back at him with a half-smile and not for the first time John gets the impression that they are all just playing along with a farce created entirely in Angelo’s imagination.
“Oh, you told him about me?” John asks him.
“But you have theories?”
“She liked to see me look ridiculous in it.”
“Yes,” From the shine in her eyes he could tell she enjoyed having surprised him. “They’ve been short staffed, until you got here. Desperate times.” She smiled again. “You’ll be covering twenty-two patients on rounds today, this floor and the next,” She handed him a stack of clipboards like the one she’d been wielding previously. He caught them one-handed.
“Err,” John fumbled, he shouldn’t have been so surprised by the question. “I guess…” He started.
“Yeah, something called...” Lestrade was shuffling things around on his desk, the noise over the phone was unmistakable. “Cylidate. Not common, but her tests were positive.”
“I’m sorry?” John asks, off kilter for a moment.
“I’m sorry?” John asks.
“You should rest.”
“I can’t believe you’re even asking that question.” John struggles to contain his incredulity.
“I guess I am.”
“But that is still how they see me.”
Of course he does. It’s what one does in such a situation. A mime. A mimicry. An external physical representation of an internally incapacitating emotion. Or just the complete ignorance that the world continues to move on around you, expecting you to carry out your small purpose within it. Like holding crockery. Or breathing.
“Can I borrow your phone?” The stranger asks suddenly, drawing John’s attention back from the rush of scenery. He turns to find both his new travel companion and the catering assistant staring at him.
“What’s happening?” John asks him. His voice has risen now, sharp with fear.
“You know what death looks like. You saw what you expected to see.”
“No one uses calling cards anymore,” Lestrade pointed out.
leave.”
“What do you want from me?” John asks finally, weighing each word.
“We knew each other for years, he was…” John casts around, then looks up into the stranger’s eyes. “Shorter. Less…” John gestures around his head with the hand not holding on to his cane. “…hair!” He finishes.
“You did go to prison.” Sherlock tells him.
“A lot has changed.” Sherlock stated calmly.
“Yes,” John’s breath is heavy.
John stepped forward, moving back into Sherlock’s space and studying his face with a fond smile.
“I can’t?”
“Is there a reason why you are visiting your parents?” Sherlock asks,
“Yes.” Sherlock said firmly, holding Lestrade’s gaze.
I’m not sure I ever expected that I would be the kind of person to write a love letter (and that is what this is, there’s no use anymore in saying otherwise). I don’t think anyone would expect from looking at me that I would be that kind of person either. I’ve always done that in my life- attempted to live up to the expectations others create for me. It’s time that I stopped. Became the expectations I set for myself. That is what this letter is. A new start.
“It was evidence!”
“Not a word,” Mike’s response.
“Not that it’s any of your business, but December.” John paused, “Probably.”
Sherlock’s repetition seems to hang in the air, unsaid. “I thought it would serve a purpose.”
“The Royal Free?” Sherlock asks, referring to the hospital. For an instant John is faintly surprised that Sherlock has remembered this detail, provided as quickly as it was, before he remembers who he seems to be talking to.
John has to look up to catch the angle of her gaze before he realises that it’s not him that’s being chastised but the child. He watches as the mother stalks over to drag the child-John away, a vague recollection appearing unbidden in his mind of a tired smile and untouched milkshakes.
It had become a habit. Cupboard. Mugs. Two of them. Pull them from the shelf and set them on the side, his hands steady.
She smiles sweetly and has time to offer a bashful “Thank you,” before a large man with an animated face abruptly bustles over to their table.
Sherlock turned to glare at him briefly, confirming that yes, his arms were crossed. Then he turned back to the body.
“No,” John shakes his head “Why?”
“So you’ve been in London.”
The puzzlement in John’s eyes was suddenly replaced with acknowledgement “Yes!” he laughed at his own memory, “Yes, I do,”
“This is inevitable.” The man says.
“From the scene? She clearly wasn’t killed where she was found.”
“Which tells me it’s either illness, scandal or money.” Sherlock continues, “Although that is conjecture at best.”
“Another body?” Sherlock asked expectantly as he rounded the final corner to find Lestrade waiting for him.
“Is that why you’re here?”
“You think Moriarty has something to do with this just because of some heavy-handed alliteration in a headline?”
John retreats. Back to his tea on the countertop. Back to the broken shards of a mug across the floor. He realises that Sherlock didn’t mention this. As if shouts and breakages and thoughts of Mrs Hudson are always linked.
“One of them is Mary’s brother.” John offers.
“Of course I would know that, why wouldn’t I?”
“Of course,” Sherlock said, knowing he wouldn’t.
“We’ve been looking for you,” Mike said pointedly to John,
“And why shouldn’t you?” The patient asks her instead, the lightness of his tone belying the shortness of his words.
It’s approaching a full minute before he says anything again:
“I didn’t tell you, at the time,” She continued, “You were so upset…”
He lies still for a moment, listening to the noises of Baker Street below him: the traffic washing by, footsteps, the floating sound of voices stirring up from the café below. He smiles. The world is still going on untouched outside. People are still laughing and drinking and talking and working. Despite the fact that Sherlock fell, and that he returned.
“Yes.” Sherlock confirms, slowly, “It was the only way.”
“Go away?”
“I know you like a challenge.” Lestrade started patiently, Sherlock continued to stare. “And the case was just too easy for you…” Sherlock huffed out in annoyance, dismissing Lestrade’s words with a wave of his hand and resuming pacing. Lestrade continued, “You’re clutching at straws looking for something bigger…”
“What do you mean, ‘kinda’?” Sherlock asked, incredulous.
“No,” The man confirmed. He was a stocky figure, shoulders so broad he looked uncomfortable even in the wide armchair he was sitting in.
“To save my life?”
“Did I get anything wrong?” Sherlock asks suddenly.
They meet at a poolside.
For a moment John is taken aback. He finds himself assessing the person in front of him. Whippet-thin and long limbed, clad in probably one of the more expensive suits John has had the opportunity to sit beside and swaddled in an equally expensive looking long coat and blue scarf. His hair is a mess of dark curls, framing a pale angular face.
Sherlock concluded as John reached the end of the letter, the ghost of his hand brushing against the back of John’s as they walked.
“Osborne?” Sherlock repeated suddenly, cutting her off.
“Good luck finding a girl for that one.” John says finally.
“Yes. I read your military career in your face and your posture and your reason for leaving in your leg. I can’t read your mind.”
Sherlock’s eyes go wide.
When he does step out it’s onto a carriage full of bored looking passengers. He has to limp through them to find a space. Cursing his leg. Cursing them.
“So now you’re worried about being recognised at train stations?” John offers,
“You are,”
In retrospect it’s really quite obvious that when the door swings open the figure it reveals isn’t Mrs Hudson.
“Putney Pier.”
“You don’t.” Moriarty moved forward, “I just find you interesting. I enjoyed you playing the game.”
“I remember.”
Not enough, not out loud. Not with emphasis enough, to show you how much I really mean it. Perhaps that simply isn’t possible.
“I’d noticed.”
“I was wondering when we would get to that.”
“It was only your time she really wasted.”
“We’re not that incompetent.” Lestrade cut in.
“Chris,” John responds coming back to himself.
“I’m not going to hurt you.”
“I must apologise if I’ve given you the wrong impression.” Sherlock continues, this other Sherlock, not the one of a few minutes previous.
“You don’t?”
“George will be there?” He countered.
He’s being crushed by the weight of what he knows and what he doesn’t.
“It’s not?” Uncertainty flashes across Sherlock’s steel eyes.
“Is this a job interview?” John answers the question with a question of his own, softening it with a smile.
“I did.”
“Not figuratively. Literally. I yelled at her.” A pause. “Did I?”
“I’ll be right there.”
A long sigh. John sits back on his chair, resting his head back against familiar cushions. Blinking his eyes against the heaviness in his lids.
“You misunderstand.” Sherlock says,
“I’m not sure.” Sherlock meets his eyes. Seemingly for the first time in hours.
“Well, yes.” Lestrade replied derailed.
“Oh dear, have we looped back to that again?”
“Of course, yes,” He said too quickly, motioning for her to lead the way. “Sorry, I should…” He said back to the consultant, with another vague hand gesture.
“Technically you were no longer using it…”
“I will continue to be a doctor.”
“I’m not surprised. He was driving it into the ground. He had no idea what it was he was selling.”
“Many?” John asked, huffing a laugh, “I’d be surprised if I had any.”
John still can’t believe.
John has that feeling again of viewing the scene as if circling around it. The entwined figures of their bodies in the centre of the room, surrounded by ghosts. The books and the papers and the notes and the secrets. Touching and grabbing and holding and hurting.
“Sorry?” He has to ask, turning back to the expectant looking barmaid.
“Oh,”
“Goodbye, John”
“I’m sure,”
“Why am I here?” Sherlock said slowly, the first words he’d said.
“There was no other way.”
His fingers drummed on his knee as his brain turned over the events of the morning.
Then someone pushed through the door beside them, the noise of the party heightening for a second and bringing them out of it.
“You predicted my shouting.”
“I do live here.”
“You realise this isn’t the Edinburgh train?” He asks in faint Cockney accent as he scrutinises Sherlock’s ticket.
“Yes.”
“Do you have an appointment?” John again. It’s late in the day and he’d thought he was finished.
“And you do?” John asks,
“Yes.”
“Have you been able to locate her?” Sherlock asked, ignoring him.
“It does?”
For three full seconds he stared at it, his stomach in knots, breathless with anticipation. The screen told him only that a generic mobile number was calling, it wasn’t saved in his contacts.
“Quite the turnout,” John said as they turned back to survey the room.
They meet in a café.
“Problem?” The man asks.
“Thank you.”
Thirty minutes later Sherlock and Lestrade were back on the pavement outside the building.
He clarified.
She doesn’t respond, but he can hear her breathing. Hard and heavy.
“They aren’t linked.”
“You look like it,”
“But the opposite happened.”
“I think I cut myself.” Sherlock’s voice.
Sherlock’s mind flashed to the clues left with the body: the rolling pin, the handcuffs, the ID Badge: Mrs Hudson, Lestrade, Molly.
John raised his eyebrows in a question.
“Handle what?”
“No.” Sherlock asserts, more forcefully this time.
“You told me, a while back, that you’d met someone…”
“No,” There’s fear creeping into Sherlock’s calm tone too, not obviously, but John can tell. He knows that voice almost as well as his own.
“I was thinking… that I’d lost you.”
The question dies on John’s lips.
“You thought he was a drinker.” John.
John suppresses a smile, goes back to his paperwork.
“Were you being an ass?”
“But…” Sherlock started,
“You didn’t?”
They meet in a computer lab.
He’d said.
“You too John,” She called after him, before pausing and adding quickly: “And tell her hello from me!”
“Of course it was. It was extraordinary,”
“Six, currently”
The cheerful look in Moriarty’s face fell out all at once.
“You just were.”
“Yes?”
“Yes,” Sherlock.
“Which means?” He asks.
“Cheap date.” John replies with a shrug, turning to pass on the request.
“Everyone has been here,” Sherlock counters.
“I know you’re only trying to wind me up.”
“Stop
“You’re not.”
She stopped talking. Pressing her lips together carefully.
Three years. Three years it had taken for the yarders to clear Sherlock’s name, and for the country to remember it. Now it was all John can do to manage to walk a street without seeing it. The media are on to him day and night for “his side of the story”, he’s had to unplug his phone.
“Stamford.” The figure says, hurrying toward John and offering a hand “Mike Stamford. We were at Bart’s together.”
“Well, where else might you find some?” She asked.
“No…” Sherlock started uncertainly, but was saved by the sudden appearance of Mike, who pushed his head through the opened door.
“I’m not sure that counts. What about your name?”
“Cuba.” Her eyes were still locked on Sherlock, and his on her. Lestrade looked quickly between the two.
Pulling the phone from his ear John looks at it for a long time.
“You don’t have an accent.”
Long fingers find their way to the back of John’s neck, carding through the short hair there.
“She did?” Despite himself Sherlock was just a little impressed.
“The things he gets up to,” She continues before John gets chance to ask who Sherlock is, “And the hours he keeps. He knows I’m not his housekeeper, but sometimes I just can’t help myself. He needs a bit of looking after.”
“What are you feeling now?” Sherlock asks, voice a low rumble. Close. John has to look back into his face and finds himself caught in that stare.
“So then this will be easy?” The officer surmises with practised efficiency.
He is no longer the one sitting beside a figure lying on a bed. Instead that same figure is sitting sentry above him while he is the one lying beneath the blankets.
“Then what is it you’re doing?”
“Yes.”
John stills.
“Look, put that down would you?” John demands, stalking over to him and snatching it from his grasp. The action seems to have reawakened his anger, “What the hell do you mean ‘most’?” He rounds back on Lestrade.
“Alright,” As he speaks he pulls his scarf from his neck, pushes back at his coat so it falls across the arm of the sofa. He is staying.
“Yes,” Sherlock’s voice again from somewhere at the back of the room, he seems to be making a habit of answering questions not directed at him “Six since June 13th. All female, middle class, aged between mid-thirties and early fifties,”
“More damaging.”
And the cab screeched away from the curb.
“I’m not sure.” John hesitates, “A detective perhaps?”
John, aware that he had, yet again, got lost in the past, shook his head a little to clear it and attempted to process what Molly had just told him. It seemed momentous somehow, but he couldn’t quite put his finger on why.
John pauses to study the photograph again and the men stationed on either side of her.
Everyone had paused in what they were doing as he’d first called her name, turning to look straight at him. As he clarified his request a number stepped backward, revealing a figure standing at the head of one of the examination tables, fingers deep in the open skull of a cadaver laid out before her. She was so absorbed in her work that she was the only one who’d not registered his presence.
“Don’t be so gauche… Lucy did.”
“Yes.”
Disappointed, John looks away from her. Back at the faded grey blue of the hospital blanket draped over his legs.
“Why would people want to read about those?”
“Officers are on their way.” He said definitively,
Before you I lived my life in neutral shades: khaki and concrete, sand and rust. I thought I was happy for a time; moving from one battlezone to the next. I found the comrades I needed, saw my niche and settled there. For a time. I did what was expected of me.
“Eighteen twenty,” A female voice behind John brings him back from the place he seems to have got lost in.
“Yes,” He turned, and started back up them.
“John?” The man says to him again, confused.
“You were with your lady friend.”
They meet on a bus
“I hurt you.” Sherlock again.
“When?”
“Oh yeah.” It clicked, “That was nothing. That was, yeah.” He paused. “Strange.”
“None,” John responds immediately, beginning to grow tired with the whole exchange.
“Except for the card…?” Lestrade continues.
It’s only one step forward.
“John?” Mike’s voice behind them snapped them back to reality and immediately John let go.
“Yes, you said all he needed was someone to put up with his silliness.”
“Perhaps,” He started in a rush, and John stopped, “Perhaps I could, try and change your mind, about London?” Sherlock continued haltingly.
He doesn’t.
“What?” Sherlock asks.
John can watch the understanding of his own words pass across Sherlock’s pale eyes, a visible representation of the effects of alcohol. Sherlock breaks eye contact. Starts to pace again.
But this time the evidence seems so damning that he doesn’t race to confirm it. John could not have failed to notice the scattered pieces of broken china across the carpet of the sitting room when he stood there previously.
“I’ve come to talk to you about Sherlock Holmes.”
“Cutting it a bit fine aren’t we?” John asks, attributing his own display of friendliness to his surprise on the sudden appearance of a stranger. Talking to a fellow traveller on a London train would usually be considered the height of social indiscretion; the stranger seems to know this and raises his eyebrows as he responds.
“Three years?” John repeats.
“Looked a lot like it.” Lestrade replies.
“No,” John smiles back. “
John looks at him quizzically, then something occurs to him.
“I think so.” Molly replied, still giving Sherlock the side eye, “Family money too,”
John pauses to contemplate this.
“Where is he now?”
The end of John’s order is lost in a strangled shout from behind the counter. John and the pink-haired girl who had been serving him turn together to watch as two men rush past the doorway behind her. One is hurrying backward as if defending himself from the figure pressing toward him: a tall man with a dark coat and a threatening look on his raw-boned face.
“I thought,” John starts, realising he has no idea of how to end the sentence, “I thought I might be able to help.”
“You’re not leaving anyone behind in London then?” John asks and then wonders where the question came from.
“You suspected.”
“What can I get you?” She asks pleasantly.
“Occasionally.” Sherlock says succinctly.
And on the other side of the world, Sherlock knew, there was another John. One that did not yet know of Baker Street, or of Sherlock Holmes.
“She threatened your job,” Sherlock replies succinctly.
“I’m a fake.” Sherlock says then.
“Afghanistan.” John offers with a bewildered smile, “Sorry, how did you know?”
Please let me know what you think: if you liked it, or hated it or feel you must shout at me for anything I've included or not included. Would anyone be interested in me continuing? If so, what would you like to see?
There’s another pause. Sherlock is fiddling with his phone, then his eyes slide to John.
John turned and went back inside.
Beside him Moriarty was silent. Perhaps he’d never expected it to be so easy, or that Sherlock would go so willingly for those he loved.
John blinked at her, taken aback.
“Here for the coffee?”
The room is stark, unfamiliar, a sterile coat of whitewash and grey green curtains, pale sunlight drifting in through a distant strange window.
“You’re not going to explain?” Sherlock asks,
“You too,”
“Obvious,” The word was high and drawn out, before he abruptly switched back to a normal tone: “I thought I owed you a visit.”
“I managed to get by her this time…” Sherlock continues, oblivious “But she’s going to realise… I’ll need your help.” He stops suddenly, looking around “You made tea?”
John swallows again.
“We all did,” A smile on her face. “I can’t imagine it really.” She says in a different tone, “All that time away, he tells me he was tracking people, people that wanted to do us harm.”
“Sounds good.” John replied.
He scribbled a hasty reply:
“She’s not the housekeeper,”
“No, I am,” John manages to open his eyes to look at him.
“Yes.”
“You’re just getting that now?!” Moriarty screeched.
“You seem interesting.” John says.
“Off and on?” John asks.
“John,”
John sits alone in the centre of a row of empty chairs, trying to distract himself from his surroundings by studying the ancient magazines arranged on the table beside him. He’s nervous. They always say that doctors make the worst patients.
“Well, when you decide you want to talk to me I’ll be out there.” John moves away, unconcerned. “Got some pages from my publisher to go over,” He continues, “Apparently they’re not ‘emotive’ enough. Her word. Can you believe that? Sometimes I think you’re rubbing off on me…”
“Worked didn’t it? I like to see you dance.” Moriarty widened his eyes with the word,
“Captain John Watson,” He told the nurse behind the reception desk. Again. He repeated the words carefully as if the reason she wasn’t complying was that she hadn’t heard him.
Sherlock drew close to John again, resting his fingers lightly along John’s jaw and holding his gaze. Before pulling him close for another kiss.
“Of course I have,” Mycroft corrected, “I helped support you in your previous crisis of accommodation, didn’t I?”
“This is staged.” Sherlock said eventually.
And then he’s gone.
“No,”
Sherlock takes his time.
The line goes dead.
“Raise. Your. Hands.” Came the order again. Sherlock and Moriarty had locked eyes: Sherlock’s calm and considered, Moriarty’s wild.
He took a moment to carefully press his lips together, recognising the import of the moment. Then continued:
“I’m surprised she never told you about him,” Mary pointed out.
“This one was serious,”
“I considered them all. I assure you, there was not.”
“Not sure I could be sitting in a quiet job in a little hospital in London. Not when there are people in the world that need me like they do out there.”
“How could you…?” He finally manages to stutter.
At first they are tentative, slow, an air of disbelief in their actions. John is still ensuring that this figure is in fact in the room with him: solid and real and not likely to suddenly disappear in a flamboyant puff of smoke. But it doesn’t take long for the tentative to give way to the desperate. Sherlock’s big hands on the back of John’s neck, John’s fingers clutching into dark curls, mouths pressed so close and so hard he can taste the rust of blood on his lips. John has the sense that this is the taste of the words they have said. That he will find them all here on these soft lips, crashing against his with such force they seem to draw the breath from his lungs, the words from his mind.
“Oh.”
“I know,” Mike smiled, “Just saying you’ll know someone else there.”
“Yes,” The man agreed, clearly confused.
“He claimed he was scared and then just… gave it all away?” Sherlock asked, following him.
“What was his name?” John asked, very quietly. Molly looked back up at him, holding his gaze as she spoke, her mouth forming the words very carefully.
“I’m getting pressure not to consider this recent one a case Sherlock, we have no evidence.”
“The brother?” Lestrade asks him, at much the same moment as John asks:
John needs evidence. Evidence that Sherlock had stood there. What had he touched? John casts around wildly, before realising the answers won’t be scrawled on the physical.
“Is that what all the commotion is?”
“How?”
“That’s a big thing to say,” John says with wonder.
The phone call, despite its terrible timing, had been just what John needed: the re-ignition of a friendship that had slipped between the many hours they’d both been putting in at the hospital. John seemed to be continuing the habit of making friends.
“I’m not sure why I didn’t,” John’s smile has reappeared for a moment.
“There wasn’t…” He starts, “By any chance, a woman, on the ward? One with kids?” John asks hesitantly.
“Not all that great,” He replied finally, more at John than at Sherlock.
Mrs Hudson doesn’t mention it of course, full of eagerness and enthusiasm she escorts them with joy back through a familiar front door, finally disappearing again back into 221a with the assurances that she will be up presently to provide them with the cake that currently cloys the air with sweetness.
“So what is this?” John continues by asking.
John seems to have lost his voice; instead he puts out a hand to gesture down the hospital corridor to his right.
“You mean like an alien?”
“Tell me about the case,” She asked. They were sitting across from each other at her small kitchen table, the hot cross buns warm and buttered on a plate between them.
“Yes,”
“Actually,” He started as she pulled the door of 221A closed behind them, hoping he was a better actor than she, “I think I left a few things behind when I moved out, would it be ok if I…” He gestured to the stairs.
“And you would know that?” Lestrade asks,
“Yeah, Steve,”
“That you were able to do that. To me. That you felt anything at all.”
“Where’s home?”
“Why do you ask?” Sherlock asks suspiciously,
He turns his head to study more of it, finding, to his surprise, that he isn’t alone. A stranger lolls in a plastic chair at the edge of the room, seemingly asleep, his dark curls falling limply across a drawn face and long limbs positioned at odd angles as if his strings have been cut. The pose gives the impression that he had been overwhelmed by sleep without warning, simply tipping into it at an impossible angle.
“And what was the plan for that?” John asks as lightly as he can in the face of them.
“Piss off,”
Sherlock was checking the lock on the window above the sink. For the third time. He became aware of the vacuum her lack of chatter had created and turned to look at her. Her eyes were wide and worried but her stance was resolute. She said nothing, just watched him desperately.
Sherlock ducked through without acknowledging what had just passed.
“I’m not?” John asked in confusion.
“Well good for you,” She replies, executing a spectacular one-eighty. “No need to tie yourself down too soon. You’re a young man.”
“Yes.”
He’d rounded the corner of the ward to see the face of a soldier he’d once treated, rather than a kid who’d broken his ankle in a skateboarding accident. He’d barked an order at the nurse rather than asking for assistance. He’d ducked at the sound of a car grinding gears on his laboured walk back to his tiny flat.
Sherlock is still there. Still patient. Still watching. What they call a fixed gaze. Pupils fixed and dilated. A dead man’s stare.
“I thought. Maybe. At the time. But since…”
“What’s ridiculous is you standing there telling me I’m being ridiculous! You’re dead! I’m being insulted by a dead man,”
“Why can’t I remember you?! You were there…” But now John’s thoughts are fading, words slowing. “I don’t remember you...” He says with effort. “…you fell.”
The clicking stops.
“More than attached,” The patient qualifies.
Beside the photograph: a single line of text, followed by a mobile number:
“No,” She says again.
Then he turned to the next: an account of the case, telling him about Vanessa Stephens. It was dated after the first but before the second and John realised that they weren’t in any kind of order. He opened each for the date and reassembled them, reading through more methodically.
“Mary,” John corrects, rubbing his face with the palms of his hands. “Her name is Mary.”
“What are you thinking?” Lestrade asked as he caught up with Sherlock in the hallway.
Sherlock, in the hallway again, checked the pigeonhole. Nothing.
“You don’t seem the type.”
“Right,” John confirms but doesn’t move.
“Yeah,” He breathed instead.
“And she called you on it.”
“The un-mistakable sound of a child’s foot connecting with the shin of a medical professional,” The man smiles,
“Not long. A day or two.”
“Should I?” he asked,
“The only one in the world.”
“How did you know? That I’ve let people…” John asks, swallowing. “Something in the way I hold my tea?”
“Somewhere in the middle.” She replied firmly, sipping her wine.
“It was the only way to solve the case.”
As always, with pain, came memories. The rest of the shift had been plagued with them.
“Beer then,” He changed his mind and she laughed, handing him an open bottle.
Then a fifth figure; striding forward at the last second and slipping through the closing doors. He fits himself amid them all, a long, skinny frame and a dark dramatic coat.
As if remembering the beverage in front of him the stranger takes a drink. John flicks his eyes back up to his face just in time to watch him grimace theatrically.
“I didn’t make you come up here.” John says finally.
John concedes, “You’re partly right. I had a therapist.”
“What?”
Immeasurable minutes pass by.
“Well it makes me wonder how difficult it was, being away like that. From you.”
“I’m often coming to conclusions on my own.”
“Well,” Lestrade sighed, “Ok then, I grant you. Not the ‘interesting’ ones.”
“Not everything.” The man concedes, “Not straight away.”
“Really Sherlock?” John dissolves, “Puns?”
John fell into it: the softness of his lips, the calm, confident way they moved against his.
“Tea?” She asks.
“I’ve plenty to occupy me.” Sherlock assured her,
“I agree,” Sherlock said, he was scanning the page in front of him, already summarised by Lestrade, “How did she find this Moriarty?”
“You need to get down here.” Lestrade said as Sherlock picked up on the second ring.
“Are you and she…?” Mary asked, on Molly’s name being raised.
“Not yet,” She said, “Something interesting…”
“Somewhere where you can be your own boss, if you wish. Somewhere where that won’t mean too much work.”
“I could have helped.”
He paused and thought about it.
“So you think Mary has disappeared because I’m, good-looking?” Half an hour ago John would have been willing to wager good money that his evening could not get any stranger, it seems he has just lost that bet.
“Okay Sherlock,” He said out loud, feeling more than a little foolish. But he pushed it aside and stood, dutifully going back to the words on the page and setting off in the direction it dictated, the spectre of his tour-guide walking along with him.
“You were being a pain?” John doesn’t really need to ask,
Then John had risked a glance at the man beside him and answered his own question. Sherlock was undeniably gorgeous: marble skin and dark hair and eyes that seemed endless. John had been unable to keep his thoughts from what he would look like beneath that heavy coat and deep purple shirt.
“You don’t remember anything?” There’s pain in Sherlock’s question.
“That’s when you started going through my papers.”
“Yes,”
“Well now, I told you it wasn’t far,” She continues, “This is me, just up ahead.” They’ve turned onto Baker Street and a line of straight-backed terraces rises up beside them. She stops at 221: a plain looking door beside a café.
“Yes,” Sherlock confirmed, preoccupied. Then he turned and walked away.
“John,”
He shook his head at the thought and took the letter with him up the stairs. Reading it for a second time.
“It was lovely to see you,” He said pleasantly, “All those months ago now. At your brother’s place.”
“Of course, yes,” Sherlock smiled back, realising she was the key to him gaining entry, “Very well deduced,” He added.
He‘d spent weeks sitting at his bedside, leading him home.
“You died, Sherlock. You. Were. Dead. I watched that. My best friend.”
“Okay, shut up,” He cuts in. “The first time we met… the first time we met, you knew all about my sister, right?”
This seemingly had nothing to do with M.
(See the end of the chapter for
“The woman in the green dress. She’s not happy.” John repeats, looking up and finding their collective gaze fixed on him, “Everyone else is smiling, except her.”
“You’re stronger than you think,”
“I came to see how he was.” Sherlock said, a bit unnecessarily and Mike nodded once, stepping forward to stand closer to the bed and moving his gaze to the figure lying there.
“You have?” John asks Sherlock.
’?” John quotes.
“No.” He said in answer to the question that hadn’t quite been asked.
“Thanks,” John's face threatened to split apart with his smile, “I came straight from work.”
“Not anymore?”
“Really, I’m not going to stand in the doorway all n…”
Looking back at the shelves he wondered at when Sherlock had left it there. When he came back to collect his things, perhaps? Or more recently? Or, a more tempting thought, had it always been there? Hiding amongst the others in plain sight as he had passed just three feet away every day, going about his life.
“You don’t have a home to go to?” She joked, with a smile.
Her words were beginning to fall out of focus,
“It can do that to
“Yes.”
The urgency in John’s limbs meant that his step down from the cab onto the pavement outside 221 Baker Street was a shaky one.
“Sentiment.”
“She asked Mrs Hudson if she could spare one.” Sherlock is telling the story now.
“And Mary…?”
“Me either,” Sherlock agreed, with a pleasant shrug, as if he were quite happy with the idea of not knowing things.
SHERLOCK
“If you say so,” Sherlock says blankly.
“That’s why you asked me…?”
“Well then,” The length of her pause gave away her disappointment. He ignored it, peering instead at the mechanism of the door, it appeared to be jammed, he gave it a gentle shake. “Plenty of space to move about in.” She finished, finally.
“Then what didn’t you know?”
“This way is easier?” Sherlock provides, parroting words that have been spoken in similar conversations previously.
“Because they cleared your name.”
“Not really my area,” Sherlock replied, mainly to the kitchen door, which he was attempting to close.
SHERLOCK
“Perhaps we will.” John says.
“You believed it?” John asks,
“I know.”
Mike shot him a meaningful look, holding his gaze for longer than was strictly necessary, then retreated.
“They were just wandering around,” Lestrade answers, John turns to look at him again.
“This is my mistake!” Angelo has stepped back a little. He turns to Sherlock “It seems you are too late,” He offers, shaking his head.
“He’s a busy man.” Sherlock says without emotion.
Sherlock responded in kind, pouring body and soul into the kiss.
“Yes well,”
“That turned out to be uncomplicated too. Three shooters. Three people that counted.”
“No I didn’t.” John counters.
“Lestrade?”
John turned to the next note, dated some weeks later.
“I can’t think.” He spits out vehemently. A beat of loaded eye contact and then he looks away.
There’s a subtle shift in that blank gaze then. Pale eyes darting away from an accusatory stare, down. To the right. Was that a marker for a lie? John can’t remember.
“That if people could see you were against me, you’d be safe.”
He turned and headed down the stairs, Mrs Hudson on his heels.
It was Sherlock.
Sherlock was standing at the floor to ceiling window on the 40
“That, or you’re always taking cakes out of the oven,” John joked back, accepting a cup of tea and taking his usual seat at the kitchen table.
“I believed you weren’t a fraud. I believed you fell off a roof.”
John inhales slowly, remembering the confusion, the rush of his words and the pitch of his voice. It was real. It could have been yesterday.
“Yes,” John breathed out, relieved, “Thank you, I will. Monday. My day off,”
Then he seemed to decide something,
“You hit the pavement and then got right back up and attended your own funeral.”
“She’ll probably bring that insufferable new boyfriend with her,” Sherlock supplies.
He’d needed some friendly words, a glimmer of brightness in the mizzle. Instead he’d received a request.
Sherlock stopped, gaze flicking between each of John’s eyes.
“Yes.”
“You’re not getting out of it that easily.”
“I’ve always had a following.”
“Definitely,” The stocky one said again. “You said twelve weeks? That’ll be around my birthday, barbecue at mine?”
“He said he’d call.”
“I think it’s time you left.” John is on his feet now.
“Could be useful.”
“Calm down,” The doctor instructs, her hand on John’s arm. “Dr Watson, you need to calm down.”
His eyes connected with Sherlock’s.
He cracks an eye to find Sherlock in a near-identical pose as himself, head tipped back against the wall. Eyes closed. John closes his own eyes against the temptation to study his profile, thinking instead of the image they must project from the doorway. Side by side. Long and short. Cold and warm. Firm and soft. The black and the white. Identically positioned, like Yin and Yang: a part of each in each. Woven together.
John turned to go.
“You’re in uniform,” The man says coolly,
“Yes.”
“You haven’t told me how you tracked down the others.”
“It is customary,”
“Don’t worry about me.”
She continued to stare at him. Didn’t reply.
“Really? She seems to have attended your wedding.”
“He does that.” Lestrade supplied, after he’d deemed enough time had passed and Sherlock was unlikely to offer anything in response. “What about her image?”
“I’ll get you that blanket,” John says walking away.
“I was shot.”
“Billy,” He said finally, lost in thought .
“To Sherlock?”
He has to close his eyes against the memories.
“That’s impossible.”
“You…” Molly started, then stopped. John looked over to find her studying his face, likely deciding what his reaction might be before framing the thought.
“I don’t know what you mean,” Sherlock smiled and glanced at her sideways.
“Your first tour?” The stranger asks after a long pause.
“You were under the influence of a great many drugs.” He replies.
“Well, yes…”
“And honey, you should see me in a crown!”
“I don’t know.” John replies calmly. “How long?”
“Got any biscuits?” He asked instead, brightening.
“So when someone wants to commit a crime, but doesn’t know how to go about it…?” Lestrade asked slowly as if hoping to be corrected, “They’ll just call...”
“I heard you were abroad somewhere,” The man continues. “Getting shot at. What happened?”
John’s stomach drops five floors to the pavement below.
“I’ll be here when I wake up?” John asks, losing himself slowly.
Suddenly compelled he scrambled to the inside pocket of his coat, drawing out the small notebook and pen he’d brought along with him.
“Well,” John addresses him, finding his voice, “I appreciate that sir”
Climbing the stairs behind Sherlock felt like walking through a dream. John found himself staring at the other man’s back in amazement, and no small amount of admiration, as he was led up and along the landing to the open sitting room door.
Then, as Sherlock watched, they became resigned, and it was with a final roll of the eyes that the other man finally raised his hands to the sky.
“Patient in 328…” He started to say.
“You’ll visit?” She asked, expectantly.
“You’re right I did. A man falls off a roof…”
John takes a moment to contemplate this, a mental catalogue of every emotion that has flit across his subconscious in the last twelve hours.
“She’s my wife. She’s not a victim of anything.” John again.
“You’re trained for surgery.” The man offers instead.
“Yes,” Lestrade made a decisive gesture and flicked back through his notebook, then lifted his gaze back to Sherlock’s, “We got something from the ex,” Lestrade repeated deadpan.
“You mean John?” Mrs Hudson asked, catching his gaze.
“How did it…?”
He found him in the front sitting room. John was standing in the window, surrounded again by a small gaggle of men. It was obviously the same group as on the platform, but this time John wasn’t dressed in fatigues, instead he wore a plain t-shirt and jeans, a beer held up in front of him like a shield.
“With the police?”
“I understand that you wish to continue with this doctor business…” Sherlock continues, John’s smile dies.
“Yes.” John lifts the hand that isn’t holding Sherlock’s to bring it to that face, “It’s probably time I stopped.”
“My wife.” John says to them both, as if explaining the circumstance to an errant child, “Is missing.”
They meet at tower 42.
John stops talking.
“And that’s…?” She asked with the air of someone that already knows the answer but isn’t sure she wants it confirmed.
“Figure of speech.” Sherlock dismissed him with a wave of the hand.
It was only the clumsy nature of the note that still bothered Sherlock. For it to arrive just hours after he had found the calling card made a taunting kind of sense, however that it should quote the exact address where he had found the card seemed unnecessary and grandiose. He’d added the postscript to draw attention to this.
A pause.
If John had been expecting him to say anything, this wasn’t it.
“Can I ask who the woman is in the photograph is Dr Watson?” It’s Sherlock’s voice that brings John back into the room, he’s moved closer, his tall figure looming imposingly,
Sherlock stared back at him for a full ten seconds, before the bland, pleasant look fell out of his eyes all at once.
“That was him. On the phone.”
“Wouldn’t say no,” The big man beside John replies quickly in a faint cockney accent. For some reason John can’t quite remember his name. He looks around to the rest of the group instead, their muttered repetitions of assent causing him to turn finally and push himself through the crush toward the bar.
“Yes.”
“Doctor Price would never allow it,”
“Yes.”
“Well, if you’re sure.” She’s letting herself into her flat. “You just go back and make yourself some tea now, wake yourself up, you look still lost in a dream”
“We’ve reached an impassh…” Sherlock replied through a mouthful.
The air was thick all of a sudden, through it, she smiled at him. He couldn’t look away.
“Both.” Sherlock confirms.
“You’re going to Baker Street?” Lestrade called out to him.
“And that couldn’t be because of a baffling conversation with a stranger?”
“They’re not?” He asks,
“Yes,” Sherlock allowed the thought to darken his face.
He leaves with a smile, the implication of his protection still left hanging in the air.
They watch each other as she speaks.
“It was necessary.”
“That’s why I try to avoid it.”
“What did you do?”
“If you like.”
John blinks.
“I’m not a witness.” He says dejectedly. They both turn together to look back him. “I didn’t witness anything.”
It might have taken John a long time to write his letter, but Sherlock’s reply was immediate:
Then:
“You scared us all.” Another smile, she takes off her glasses in a practised move. “It’s nice to see you back. I knew you’d manage it.”
“I can see,” He didn’t look up, but his keyboard was now better lit than it had been previously.
John stops.
“Oh.”
The moment it came to him he was heading toward the door, his hand already raised as he made it to the edge of the pavement. He told the cabbie to take him to St Bart’s.
“You have a brother?” John asked surprised.
“I will,” John said again, the platitudes of leave-taking.
“You’re a blogger.” Sherlock supplies.
They continue to look at each other. Barely two feet of wall separating them.
Then he was gone.
“Hello?” He calls, moving forward, unsure whether it was just some kind of vicious rumour. As far as he can see the rooftop is empty.
“You’ve not made it very easy for me.”
One flight down and one long sterile corridor later he was pushing open the door of the morgue.
John stops as they cross the threshold.
“And stop calling me Sir, it’s John.”
“You moved my chair?” Sherlock asks.
But he’d not yet stepped forward.
John nods with a smile and then begins the delicate balancing act of gathering up four full pint glasses to take them across the room.
John decided, as he watched Mike head back inside for the next round, that he was very pleased that he had come.
She looked up at him, offering an unconvincing smile and reaching up to pat his hand on her shoulder.
Perhaps.
“Sherlock,” Lestrade cautions,
“You too,” She repeated and then realised what she’d done and laughed. John noticed for the first time that she was nervous, it hadn’t occurred to him to feel like that.
Moriarty lowered his head, rubbing his face.
“Yes.”
“You tell me,” Sherlock replies, as if it’s a test. “Does it?”
“I think,” John starts again, “I think I would have been, if you’d turned up on the doorstep, like you planned.” John’s words are faltering as he tries to put together what it is he wants to say, looking inward. “But that never happened. A lot happened instead.”
What did it mean 2008?
“It’s not obvious to me.”
“You were wearing a wire?”
“She’s with her sister.”
“But the work?” John asks. The biggest question he can think of.
“We’re just friends.” John confirmed.
“Yes,” John replied simply, not summoning the will to be polite.
“I think that’s all we need for now Dr Watson,” He says with an air of finality.
“Too much tinsel.” Sherlock replied grouchily.
A man knocks into him roughly from behind, offering no apologies. John turns in time to see him push past impatiently, a long coat and a cloud of black curls.
John pays him little attention, pulling out his mobile and contemplating the idea of calling Mary, until noticing the time and realising she’ll be busy.
Of course it happened. He couldn’t make up words like that. Back and forth; explaining and accusing and shouting for God’s sake.
“She does fit the profile,” Lestrade again.
Sherlock paused, considering.
“So why today?”
Of course Sherlock doesn’t understand the importance of the morning after. The morning after the resurrection. The reassurances and words the touches: the confirmation that Sherlock is in fact no longer past tense, but present. That it wasn’t all some strange stirring of John’s insane imagination. It wasn’t.
A breath, three paces and a turn.
Then very quietly, in the distance, the sound of helicopter blades.
“I witnessed it!”
“And are you? Going to… help?” Sherlock seems to be struggling,
“Because I was hurting Sherlock.” A sigh. John is feeling too much, “Because you were gone and I was hurting. It hurt. I didn’t think you could hear me.”
“Is that what you were looking for?” John asks, “An apology?”
“I can’t help it.”
“And what do you see?”
“What does?” John asked, head buried in the chart he was holding,
“Seven?” John asks.
“What makes you say that?”
“You were wrong,” Lestrade said with a not insignificant air of smugness as Sherlock picked up.
John stepped forward into that familiar room and took a long look around.
“Yes.” Sherlock responds. Their conversation conducted without any real words having been spoken at all.
Sherlock took an aborted step toward him, unable to tramp down the swell of anger in his stomach. It must have flashed on his face.
“No,”
“Yes, and the rest.”
“No I didn’t.” Sherlock maintains. John feels like he’s losing his mind.
Sherlock continues: “One loophole in that: Moriarty himself could call them off. I could have made him call them off. People are uncomplicated,”
The chatter and the laughter and the noise; the scraping of chairs and the hum of conversation. It’s no longer there.
And his
“You should definitely get that.” The patient says.
“I will,” He smiled,
“Did you?”
“They’re the kind of words that a person should say.”
“Oh?”
“And him.”
“That you just came back?! Hopped up off the pavement and came back and told me all those things? After I’d imagined it? After I’d wanted it to happen? That you just let yourself back into the flat and we… And we… And then you just… went out?!” John’s voice is still a yell.
“Never heard of it.” John addresses Sherlock.
“Good job,” He said genuinely.
She let herself through the tired old gate and into the small garden opposite the hospital, holding it for him to pass through before turning and tracking over to sit on the single bench.
“I do. I know he underestimated you.”
John didn’t watch her go, still too fixated on what he held in his hands.
“We need to speak with Lucy Shields, she wrote the headline piece in the paper today?” Lestrade asked the receptionist.
“No.”
“Patient.” John smiles “You made quite an impression on her. I think she described you as my ‘’andsome fella’” John mimics her accent,
“Yes.” Sherlock agrees, “Or rather they were permitted to make the information public. It was the first step.”
John’s eyes were closed, his skin pale, made paler by the bandages across his temple and torso. One shoulder was completely covered by the rough hospital sheet, the other arm lay bare.
“You told me...” John’s response, words uncertain.
My best man,
“If your shift is over there is no reason for you to respond to that page.”
Sherlock moans.
“If you had just let me walk we could have already been out the door,”
John could imagine Sherlock sitting on one of the benches and tipping his face to the sunshine as he talked.
“You’ve done your tests, it’s written on the chart.”
“I never knew,” A stop. “When to expect. Whether I was just something to pass the time between cases.”
“You’re going to have to tell her.”
“And you accepted?” Lestrade asked, incredulous.
Sherlock has turned to look in his direction, properly for the first time, the full force of a cold stare turned solely on him.
Lestrade sighed.
Sherlock moved closer, toward a crowd around one of the tables.
“You’re sure you want to come?” She asked,
They’ve been sitting in silence for some time. John’s energy is ebbing. The buzz of adrenaline created on the sudden appearance of a corpse long subsided in his veins.
“When he’s better.” Sherlock clarified.
“Which means, Dr Watson.” The man says languidly, reaching into the pocket of his oversized coat, “That I think it’s about time that we left.”
Lestrade looked at him.
Of course there wouldn’t be snow. The statistical likelihood of the London climate being mild enough for snow in March was infinitesimal. Only this morning he had considered the necessity of his heavy winter coat.
“You’re not stupid.”
Sherlock sighed, didn’t answer.
“Yes.” Sherlock replied petulantly.
“Look, you’re…”
“We’re trying, two new pairs of hands and the fallout from all this…” John started, but she cut him off.
He pushed the note into the pigeonhole and closed his eyes.
They meet in a hospital.
“What is it?” Sherlock asks from his place in the doorway, his concern instantaneous.
“You have?”
“I think the long drop is doing that better than I can.”
Finished, the stranger reaches out to take a drink from the coffee on the table in front of him. John stares.
Teabags. Kettle. Water. Teaspoon.
“I made some hot cross buns,” She held his gaze. “Why not get dressed and come have one?”
He nods in acknowledgement.
As if on cue Lestrade strolls back over. John turns from Sherlock to watch as he approaches.
“You couldn’t?”
“An explanation.”
“Right.” He said, as the lift doors dinged open. “No reason.”
“You’re telling me that note…” John started to cover it,
“You wanted to know about a ladder.” John explains.
John thinks for a moment.
“Me?” John asks,
The plan was sounding more convincing the longer Sherlock spoke, even though he knew, in some strange back-to-front way, that it had already happened.
“Either that, or something that won’t show up on a standard tox report.” She replied.
The woman sighed.
“Close” Sherlock answers cryptically. “Most of the time at least. At first, I was away. Germany. For a month or two. But that didn’t take long. I came back as soon as I was able.”
Time passed.
“You came back? You found it?”
John opens his eyes, finds Sherlock lent against the far wall, hands behind him, an uncertain look on his face.
John can’t find his voice any more.
“There were a lot of people there.”
“Starts at six!” Molly called out to him from further along the corridor ahead of him.
“Good afternoon Mr…?” John starts, shuffling his work aside and looking down at the appointment schedule on his desk to find a name. Then he looks again, there’s nothing written on his 6pm.
“I suppose not.” John finds himself smiling again at his turn of phrase, before a thought strikes him. “Hang on a minute; shouldn’t I be the one forgiving you?”
“Of course I didn’t want to.”
“You were dead.” John states bluntly. The staircase is short; they’ve reached the top already, stepping shoulder to shoulder across the threshold of his room.
John stood slowly,
“And you didn’t like to hear people saying those things about her?” Sherlock asked, uncharacteristically sympathetic.
“Explain.”
“They’re a health hazard.”
“Of course it was. It was extraordinary: it was quite extraordinary”
“She was telling me about that police officer she used to date.”
“I’ll be back as soon as I can.” John promises as he disappears.
“Seen a lot of injuries then; violent deaths,” Sherlock continues to explain his logic.
“Sherlock?” It was Mycroft’s voice that drew Sherlock out of his mind palace sometime later. “What are you doing in my chair?”
John nodded.
“Yes.” Sherlock confirms, quicker now.
“Yes.” John tips his head back against the pillows with a sigh. While beside him Sherlock leans forward, his hand reaching onto the bed to cover John’s in a movement that seems practised. So practised that it takes a moment for Sherlock to realise he’s done it. He moves to draw his hand away but John catches it.
“I didn’t know what to think! You came back from the dead!”
She surveyed him, clearly not believing a word.
“Or they have a reason not to be here.” The stranger offers.
John is soaked.
“Deduction?” The word lights something buried deep at the back of John’s mind.
“Wait. There’s not, actually…” He started.
It brings John up short.
“Wine please,” She answered quickly, so quickly it caused her to laugh nervously again, “White, dry, anything really.”
“That’s what I said.”
“But yeah, party. My place, you know where it is. Next Saturday.”
John stares back at the stranger, watching him. His head swims. Why can’t he remember what Sherlock looked like?
“I didn’t call, no.” He offers her.
“Really?”
“I’ve seen you in the papers.”
A long silence. Minutes tick by. A lifetime. A lifetime unlived.
“What should I be expecting of this evening then?” He asked as he grew uncomfortable with the eye contact.
“You have a following.”
“Victim?” He asked quickly.
John had quite deliberately not asked about it, he didn’t want that last connection to that brief old life of his severed completely. But she was more observant than he often gave her credit for, and she must have noticed how his eyes cut up the stairs as he approached them.
“She threw me out.” Sherlock tells him.
“Yes, I know, I was just…”
“You what?”
“You know I’m not an actor.” The stranger points out.
A pause.
“You mean Kilburn.”
“Of course I do.” John replies with a smile.
“I only started last year,” She didn’t go on.
“Oh, I’m not sure, didn’t that guy from Psycho have a thing about his mother?”
“We were friends three years ago?” John asks, more confused now than he was when he awoke.
“No,” He looked away from them, back at his hands, “No, we weren’t ‘out’ in the papers yet. I wanted to be,” He added quickly, “But her people said it would be better if everyone thought she was single. She was more ‘available’ that way,”
John struggles to remember quite how he got here. Something to do with a guy who had reminded John of someone he used to know, stopping to talk to him on the street as they both wound their rather convoluted ways home from a bar. Something about that guy’s rather flirtatious suggestion that home and comfort and sleep and water were for the weak. The strong came here instead. The strong shucked off their shirt and pushed themselves between the writhing figures on the floor to pulse and jump and shout and dance.
John can’t find his voice.
“You seeing what isn’t there again?”
“There was a woman who visited,” Sherlock offers instead, “She had children.”
“I need to know if he has a green ladder,” Sherlock offers cryptically, striding away.
Sherlock whirls to face him, not breaking his stride.
“It’s what people do, don’t they – leave a note?” Out of nowhere Sherlock has started to cry. His strong face caving in.
Lestrade stood up abruptly.
“Then how did you…?”
They meet in a GP Surgery.
I owe you so much.
All done, finished.
floor of a London tower block, trying his best to ignore the conversation occurring behind him.
“You had a good time...”
John wasn’t quite what Sherlock had imagined; shorter than his peers and broad shouldered, his blonde hair a contrast with his dark uniform. Sherlock gravitated closer, near enough to hear what they were saying.
It read. Sherlock fired off a reply.
“The last guy did.” John said simply. “Guess it’s dark out here.”
If he’d been asleep he could never heard the noise in the hallway downstairs. Could never have stood from his chair and collected the plates from their positions beneath the coffee table. Could never have dropped them dramatically on the appearance of a man who may never really have been standing there.
“What are you working on?” John asks directly instead, moving over and pressing his hand against the back of Sherlock’s neck gently. Sherlock tenses, but doesn’t respond.
“You don’t need…” John started, wanting to leap in and assure him he was under no obligation to say it back, but at the same moment Sherlock spoke himself:
“Yes.” Sherlock on the other hand, couldn’t look away.
“You were watching me?” John continues.
“Did you really think it would work that way?” John asks.
“I doubt it. Was there a suspect?” He asked, interested, “Anyone on the rooftop?”
“Goodbye, John”
“It’ll only come when the postman does,” She pointed out.
A pause. Moments frozen in amber. Preserved.
“Perhaps I should be flattered?”
John blinks at his own words spoken back to him in a velvet voice. The voice of his dreams. He stares for a moment.
He went for that drink with Mary.
“Is that like her?” Lestrade asked.
“But you didn’t?”
A pause. Lestrade looked at Sherlock, waiting for the next question, but when none was forthcoming he jumped in instead:
“I’m getting married for god’s sake.” Disbelieving humour in John’s voice.
There was indeed a note waiting for him as he took his leave from Mrs Hudson, he picked it up on the way out the door and for the very first time made it all the way back to his flat before he opened it.
“Body of a young woman.” The officer offered, quietly, his face solemn, “Looks like suicide.”
John gapes. He has heard of him:
“I know,” John says, “Don’t say it.”
“Just…” John started, then realised he couldn’t possibly explain, “A special day, for us, I guess.”
John wonders if he’s still dreaming.
“Forgive me?”
“And you…” She started, hopeful, “Brought no one to help bring them upstairs?”
“But those aren’t necessary in a book about science?”
“Please God don’t say ‘necessary’ again.”
“Yeah,” John replied. They were sitting together at a small weathered old table outside a pub, making the most of the dying rays of the summer sun before it became too cold or dark of an evening to brave the outdoors.
Sherlock ignored the question and continued to study the room. Then abruptly he strode forward, completely ignoring the heap of a figure in the middle of the room, to a small business card sitting on the bedside table.
“To friendship.” John replied, with a sudden burst of affection.
“I don’t feel like it,”
“And what else do you notice about her?” He asks, so close John can almost feel his breath on his face. John has to force himself to look back down at the photograph.
“She could always be trusted to say things out loud.” John assures him.
The case had gone stale.
“What?”
“Oh,” Sherlock seems to realise something “John, um,” And starts to struggle conversationally as much as John had previously, “While I’m flattered…”
“I frightened her, didn’t I?” John tells him,
It’s three hours later when he’s able to go back.
“You’ve told me enough. For now.”
When they reach the top of the staircase they don’t break contact, both pretending not to notice as Sherlock leads them through the door and into the flat.
“You’re sure?” Mrs Hudson said, she was standing on the landing, facing him over his assembled bags,
Sherlock stares at him, his face open but as unreadable as a blank page of a book. Then his eyes soften, something beginning to tug at the side of his mouth, something like affection.
“I am,” She says up at him with a bright smile, his enthusiasm catching, “It’s good to see you,”
“Advice,” The man said slowly.
“On who’s authority?” He counters.
“Yes.”
“Oh no, nothing interesting, I’m sure,” John found himself saying without really understanding why, tucking the sheet quickly into his jacket pocket. “Best be going,” He continued briskly.
“There’s a body?” He asked instead.
There was no letter waiting for Sherlock when he returned home. He found pen and paper and wrote anyway.
“You asked me.” Sherlock has become very still, the nervous tension that fuelled his pacing suddenly lost. “That day. You asked me. Not to be.”
“Yes,” Sherlock pauses, “It was some time ago now.”
the clientele?”
Turning into the room ahead of them Sherlock could see the body of a woman on the ground. A thousand deductions immediately reared up; connections and details, things he was sure most of the room wouldn’t have noticed. As he studied her he could see all the pertinent details of her entire life story, written as clearly as if she had dictated him her autobiography. But no card.
Mike laughed. “To what?”
“Who says I’ve met someone?” John laughed, blindsided,
“Why not?”
“In publishing. Fleet Street. Look I’m sure I’ve told you this…” He’s getting agitated again, tired of playing the game.
“We need to find out why she did this, people don’t up and fake their own deaths for no good reason.” Lestrade explained slowly, as if speaking to a child.
“Make me.” Sherlock requests.
“You’re eating that or playing with it?” Mycroft asked above him and Sherlock looked up from his bowl of rapidly congealing Shredded Wheat,
“No one else did.”
“Who?”
“But…” John started, confused.
“We sit here and talk and make jokes and plan but it’s not real. It keeps happening, over and over and I see it. Please. Please explain this to me, for the love of God, explain it to me, Sherlock.” John is pleading now, “This isn’t happening and I want it to. I love you. Why aren’t you there?!”
“It was necessary to die?”
His tone is so familiarly bored that John feels like laughing.
They stand in silence for some immeasurable amount of time: two figures, on a roof.
“What?”
“I do have a life away from you Geoff,”
“Unless my people see you jump.” Moriarty agreed, his tone now contrastingly deadpan.
Hadn’t, not hasn’t. Remember the past tense John. Sherlock is dead.
Sherlock still stands by his bedside, suit but no coat, face still pale, eyes still blue. He’s dropped his touch from John’s hand and stands awkwardly immobile: not his normal resting state.
John’s head swims with the mention of his name.
“Yes. I suppose”
Officers were indeed arriving as he made it back into the hall, he spoke with them briefly, then he turned to stride away.
Sherlock doesn’t respond from beside him and John doesn’t have the nerve to check his reaction. Instead he presses on.
“Oh?”
“You wouldn’t, would you? Wouldn’t understand.”
And he concludes this bizarrely enthusiastic speech by grasping her firmly by the shoulders and kissing her noisily on the cheek.
He’d been dreaming of Sherlock.
John exhales.
“Exactly,” Sherlock said firmly, as if it proved his point. Lestrade blinked at him in confusion, not following his train of thought, but then again, he was used to not being able to follow Sherlock’s train of thought.
“How did I guess?” John offers sarcastically.
“There’s been a fourth,” John hears him say into his phone, produced from nowhere. He's sitting bolt upright on top of John, his pale chest still glowing faintly in the dark room.
Sherlock had found him in the cold and kissed his neck as he watched the skaters.
“You are a blogger.” Sherlock remembers,
“Not a fan of the cinema then?”
“But that doesn’t mean anything?” John says as a question, rising to his feet again, “Does it?” He’s grown tired of having the conversation conducted over his head.
A breath, three paces and a turn.
“Barely.”
“Afghanistan.” John replies.
“Enter Moriarty,” Sherlock cut in, bored of the preamble.
“It’s the painkillers.” Sherlock says slowly, with a movement that could only really be termed as a ‘nuzzle’ if it weren’t being performed by Sherlock Holmes.
I haven’t told you: thank you.
“He knows nothing. Find out who these ‘people’ are, I’ll speak to them next.”
“Who are you!?” John asks him, desperation seeping into his words, “What are you doing here?”
Finally John sighed and turned away, feeling foolish.
John stares away from him. Away from the doorway. Toward the kitchen.
John swallows, fear rising as the strangeness of Sherlock’s voice only confirms what he already knows.
And as Sherlock mentions it John notices: the chatter and the shouts and the rumbling of trains all around them.
There’s a long pause.
“Yes, but you thought it was in the sugar.”
“Yes.”
“You think you know me pretty well.” He says lightly.
“It’s staged for me...” Sherlock continued, paying Lestrade as much attention as he usually did at these times, which was to say: very little.
“Yes.”
“You could say that.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, “I find that…” Sherlock started but Lestrade cut him off,
And before he can think anything else, he leans forward and captures Sherlock’s lips against his own.
A beat of awkward silence.
It feels late.
On the top of the pile was today’s newspaper, half the headline visible on the front page. He pushed a finger at it to unfold it properly:
“Yes.”
John met his gaze for a few seconds, reading the meaning he put there, before cutting his eyes away.
“You changed time,” Sherlock said, John looked at him in confusion. “By sending that letter, you changed everything. I moved in here for a start.”
The two of them are left standing on the pavement, surrounded by shopping bags and, at least on John’s part, a strange sense of bewilderment.
Somehow the logistics of that sentence seem a little confused.
“You believed in Sherlock Holmes.” Sherlock wonders aloud.
“Anyone heard from her?” Lestrade asked, eyebrows raised.
As he stands he becomes aware of a presence at his back, a tall figure in a long coat. There’s a huff of air beside his face and long arms reach out to circle his waist from behind, lips brushing close to his ear.
“John,” John replies automatically, before remembering himself, “Doctor Watson.”
“Yes,”
“Basically.”
“No matter.” The stranger saves John from his conversational floundering,
Stepping forward the true force of his memories took over and John found himself superimposing the past against the sharp empty angles of the space around him: the bison skull on the wall, Billy the skull on the mantlepiece, Sherlock’s eclectic book collection.
“Yes.”
But the smile doesn’t take long to fade.
“I touched you.”
Sherlock.
“Well,” John doesn’t like the silence. “Thank you.”
The note waiting for him was brief.
“Just…”
An hour later and the pot had been drained and the delicious freshly baked cake reduced to crumbs on their plates.
“I…” John starts, gets lost.
John was taken aback by the words but realised, quite suddenly, that they were true. The last few weeks at work had been no easier, the hours no less long. But something had shifted with him. The memories had quieted, the black hours in the middle of the night shortening, not gone completely, but manageable.
“Is she ok?” He asks.
“Then what are you doing here?”
“Do you hear me John?” He asks instead, reality tilting. “You need to come back.”
“Yes.”
“Come
She always over-used her terms of endearment when she was losing her patience with him.
“…hard to believe? Well, believe it. You were wrong, she did tell us something.”
“Serial killer by proxy, I suppose. Yes.”
“You don’t need to make excuses,” Lestrade said, leaning beside him. Sherlock shot him a look. “It’s not your thing, you don’t need to apologise.” Lestrade continued.
“Exactly John.”
“I did know what I was doing when I kissed you.” Sherlock’s voice is calm. Poised somewhere above John’s covered eyes.
“I haven’t seen her in weeks,” Zoe said without preamble. “We had a bit of a falling out.”
“No, but I should be able to see them from here.”
“You really want to?” Lestrade asked, a bit surprised. Sherlock had never asked something like this of him before.
“You know what,” he said, catching the eye of the patient, “Hold this,” he said to him, handing the man his cane, before removing the brakes from the bed, “MRI?” he asked the nurse,
It is Angelo that breaks the silence.
“Meeting a stranger on a train is hardly the stuff that great mysteries are made of.”
“Perhaps we could start again?” John asks. Sherlock looks dubious, so John holds out his hand: “Hi, I’m John.”
“She did make the papers.”
“I could hear that,” She replied.
Sherlock squared his shoulders, schooling any trace of expression from his face. Then stepped forward toward the half-open sitting room door, pushing it wide.
“Me.” Sherlock replies quickly.
“Only partly?”
“As are you.”
“Yes.”
“You’re in my house.”
“You are sure you weren’t dreaming?”
“It tells me it’s something you don’t wish to talk about.”
John looks up at the previous owner of that coffee, his dark suit and dramatic coat seem to have avoided the cascade of liquid completely.
“I mean,” She stood and moved around the desk toward him. “Well, we’ve had a few… But n-nothing Greg’s been involved with…” She continued, clearly believing she was the one that was mistaken.
John is weaving between stationary traffic to cross the street and has to stop suddenly against the wall of a cab that’s pulled up in front of him.
“Ah, coffee,” The stranger addresses the beverage rather than the bearer, reaching out one hand behind him to return John‘s phone, “Thank you, Molly. What happened to the lipstick?”
“Eight. Yes.”
“John!” Mrs Hudson had thrown open the door almost the moment that he had rung the bell, the question on her face turning quickly to delight as she recognised her caller. “How wonderful to see you!” She beamed her beam of a smile. “You must come in! Come on in and tell me all about that new job of yours. Let me put the kettle on.”
“You bought beer, there are a few left.”
Sherlock thanks him with a nod, before turning to offer the same to the two seated at the table.
He was just another case for Sherlock to solve. It had never been about him.
“Was it not boiling fast enough?” She was smiling. Taken with the joke, “Too much steam?”
“He knew you were alive?”
“Is it a case?” Mrs Hudson asked, calling after him.
John’s standing now. He really does need to answer the page.
“And just how long did you spend outside watching whether or not I switched on a light?” John’s tone is teasing.
“No, I’m with the police.”
“And how many hours?” He asks lightly around the lump in his throat.
The helicopter was above them now, the updraft created by the blades causing their hair and clothes to flap frantically around them.
“That was, that wasn’t… No. That wasn’t what I meant.”
She glowed a little.
“John…” Sherlock looks dubious.
“Lestrade said some nice things. So did Mrs Hudson.”
“Very good.”
“I was watching the room,”
. More than these little people in this little city. Such little
“Fine.”
A pause as Sherlock considers the word, “Yes, what?” He asks finally.
“I want you to tell me where I can find Sherlock Holmes.”
The harsh whispers above him cut off sharply.
“You wouldn’t usually admit that.”
They meet in a pub.
“Should you be putting such thoughts in my mind?”
“You’re saying I walk slow,” John is being deliberately blunt.
Then he falls back to sleep.
There’s a pause.
“This is a doctor’s surgery, not a place for an interview.” John doesn’t back down, this man may be six inches taller but John has the authority here.
“So he knew I counted. But I didn’t”
Finally John exhales, a huff of air:
John turned to leave and Sherlock changed his mind.
“I’m not exactly trained for this.” John admits.
“Yes, you said that.”
Angelo had started to pace subtly in the back of the restaurant.
“Would you like to sit down?” A deep voice asks.
The whole thing was ridiculous. His life was passing him by while he was invested in a fantasy, an impossibility. A person no more real to him than the characters in those silly detective stories he used to read. He had to stop living in the past, most specifically two years in the past. He needed to move forward.
“Moriarty?”
“Open your eyes, John” Sherlock’s voice seems suddenly louder.
“Leaving London?”
“Partly.” Sherlock replies unhurriedly, “My mother and I have a… frosty relationship. My father died when I was small.”
“Yes,”
“The police don’t consult with amateurs,”
“Mike of course, and oh, a friend of yours,” She spoke as if she couldn’t quite put a finger on the memory, “Someone Mike knew too…”.
SHERLOCK
This place, these memories. Had won.
“Yes.”
John stops for a beat before replying, the normality settling across his shoulders like a warm blanket.
“Ok,” John’s mouth is a breath away from his. “Now stop talking.”
“She usually walks from Charing Cross – there’s a coffee shop she likes…” John offers, before remembering himself, “Look, I really don’t see how any of this is relevant…” His voice is rising again.
“Yes,” The stranger agrees.
“What are you going to do to them?” A pause, “My friends?” He clarified, pushing the words out tightly.
what you were doing.  You knew what you were doing when you sent me to Mrs Hudson. You knew I’d go. You knew what you were doing when you kissed me. You knew what you were doing when you asked me to watch as you threw yourself off a building in some… in some… necessity.”
“Captain Watson?” She asked,
“Yes.” Sherlock came back to himself, then turned on his heel, “Text me the address.”
“What do you want Harry?” They aren’t exactly speaking at the moment; John can’t help it if his tone is short.
“Morning.” John tries to say lightly, but his voice cracks. Anything that could have been an attempt at a joke lost in a croak.
“No,” John says, thinking it over, “Green eyes.” He realises.
“I feel I should take offense at the word ‘bizarre’”
“Right, well I should…” John said, gesturing to the train with one hand and wrapping the palm of the other around the back of his neck in a bashful gesture that looked like something he might do often.
“So, are you going to tell me what this is about?” John asked with a laugh as he followed Molly from the building. They were both bundled up against the winter cold, clutching their sandwiches.
They wait.
“No one complains,” She pointed out and John laughed, watching her smile spread as she realised she’d amused him.
“Yes Sherlock,” John placates with a sigh.
“Yes.”
“What’s happening?” John asks,
“Yeah.” He said sarcastically, looking away. “Really knocked myself out.”
“Sitting alone outside a train station,”
“No,” Sherlock agrees. Before adding, “There’s a fourth possibility.”
Sherlock stood staring at the scarf in his hands, the one he’d pulled from the pigeonhole that morning along with another note.
For John realisation is a tidal surge, like being submerged slowly into a pool of warm water. The beer had freed his tongue, the rush of the case and the heady nearness of Sherlock had banished his nerves. He’s overstepped the mark, he’s said too much.
Then someone knocked at the door.
In response Lestrade sighed. “Why?”
And turns to walk away.
It’s still there when John finally sobers some minutes later.
“You love me.” John.
“You will not let me forget that, will you?”
“Time-travel, John,” Sherlock said, as if it explained everything.
“But you did it anyway?”
“Sherlock Holmes.”
Baker Street was hushed and expectant when he arrived, the summertime darkness sitting across it like a too-heavy blanket.
The rest of the room fades away.
“Afternoon,” Lestrade offered in greeting as they moved forward toward the empty chairs opposite her, “You’re looking well.”
“Your phone,” The stranger nods in the direction of John’s jacket pocket where he had replaced it earlier, “It’s expensive, e-mail enabled, MP3 player, but you’re on an army pension – you wouldn’t waste money on that. It’s a gift then.
John smiles.
“She could have just been having a bad day,”
“You were worried,” John offers, from their previous conversation.
“Lunch, John,” Molly replied breezily, not looking round, “You know lunch? That meal between breakfast and dinner? The one we used to have together, all the time?” There was a smile in her voice, she was teasing him.
“Are you?” He asks.
Sherlock regards him levelly for a few moments, eyes narrowed, before he slowly steps forward and, ignoring the hand John has offered him, sits down in front of him on the coffee table. On top of the papers. John can’t help but notice how close his left elbow comes from brushing against the beer bottle beside him.
Cupboard. Mugs. Two of them.
“What do you deduce from that?” John asks,
“How long have you worked here?”
He opened them a minute later to find the sheet he’d placed there no longer white, but blue.
John can only look up at them.
John,” He’s still smiling, “In the time we’ve been arguing we could have already been out the door,”
John’s hands have curled into fists on the table before him. He has to prise them open slowly.
“What that was, what you were asking…”
For a moment he considered going up, seeing all those things in the same places, but just as quickly realised it was foolish, he had no connection here really. Only the friendship of a nice old woman.
“Yes.”
“And you know what?” Moriarty continued, “In the end it was easy. Because you’re
“You don’t underestimate me. You know me.”  John continues. “You
Sherlock grins back in response.
“Female, twenties, lived alone,”
In the most part it was working, but occasionally he found himself missing that strange old flat on the other side of town; the smiling face of his landlady, the homely smell of baking as he’d let himself in of an evening.
The question in his statement is a subtle one.
A pause. Mike steered away from the forbidden topic.
Sherlock swallowed, “You could be needed here,”
“Yes, she mentioned him.”
“Thank you for the hospitality as ever Mrs Hudson,” He said, moving to go past her, but at the last second gave in to the urge to lean down and give her a quick kiss on the cheek. He’d not done that before, and his embarrassment in realising that meant he couldn’t quite meet her eye as he continued to the door, “I’ll see myself out.” He continued brusquely, “Look after yourself,”
And now pressed against an unfamiliar doorway John can’t help but recognize that Sherlock kisses as he
“You came back.”
“I haven’t…” Sherlock starts, but then seems to catch John’s meaning, his words peter out.
“You faked your own death.” Sherlock jumped in the moment the words were out of her mouth.
“I took it he meant you,”
“So now I wonder,” John says, a slow burn of a smile, “If I wasn’t so far off the mark the first time.”
“I didn’t presume for a moment that it was.”
“I hear you got a flat?” Lestrade asked, when the silence got the better of him. “And apparently I’m the last one to know?”
They fall quiet.
“How?”
“Mike might have mentioned me,” She breezed, moving past him, he turned to follow, “Sorry about that,” She waved the clipboard, “This isn’t my usual job, I’m not all that used to dealing with people that are, well…”
“So the brother then.” Lestrade summarises, writing something in a small notebook he’s produced from his pocket. “Can you tell us his name?” He asks John.
“John, I…”
Sherlock’s face crumples a little.
John blinks.
Sherlock had been right, Angelo’s was still there, a shining beacon of warm light on the cold Soho street. As much as he wouldn’t admit it John’s hands were trembling when he pulled open the door the next evening.
“That’s why you’re interesting.”
“But it didn’t matter either way.” Sherlock takes three seconds to rescind it. John blinks in surprise. “If I’d told you. All this. It would still have had to happen.”
Sherlock had pocketed the note that morning as he’d dashed from the flat. Another case. His mind had been full of possibilities as he rushed across London. But once he’d arrived he’d been refused entry.
John lets out a long breath.
“Yes,” Sherlock said again, “And John.”
Sherlock had already started his retort when the second half of the sentence derailed him,  causing him to stare back at Lestrade with his mouth hanging half open.
“I-I’m sorry?” Mike stammered out finally, “How well do you know him?” He asked, perfectly reasonably.
“Because you did.” Sherlock responds.
“Do you want to get out of here?” John asks, boldly.
Then he read the forwarding address again.
“Looking like a great weight is on your shoulders,”
“I know.” He said quickly, then: “I’d like to come,” He paused, trying to look like he wasn’t begging, “If I may?”
“Can you tell me how you’re feeling?” The doctor has paused by John’s chart, looking something over. John notices his name badge: Doctor Osborne.
“By which you mean?”
“You are important John.”
“Sherlock!” Her greeting was infinitely warmer, spoken through a beam of a smile as she moved forward from the step to embrace him. Sherlock bore the ensuing show of affection coolly, realising only half way through the second cheek-kiss that he should be making some effort at reciprocating.
“Then it was just a case of luring him into a situation he thought he was in charge of.”
It took a moment for Lestrade to realise the final line was a question.
It bothers John that he didn’t know Sherlock owned a red scarf.
“Ok then, I won’t.”
“A professional opinion.”
“Can I buy you a drink?” John can’t remember the last time he’s said this to someone in a bar.
John peers around at the room exaggeratedly, “I’m not going anywhere.” He says.
“Whotcha,” He offered in greeting, coming up behind Molly and kissing her quickly on the cheek.
“Of Molly’s?” Mike asked.
“In a way, yes.” Sherlock concedes, “Though my brother dramatizes.”
“Open your eyes John.” Sherlock says firmly.
“Except for the shouting.”
Letting himself in through the familiar front door, he passed silently along the hallway. He knew now which floorboards squeaked, where to put his feet on the deepest parts of the rug to avoid the click of his soles. He paused at the writing desk as he passed, slipping his hand into the empty pigeonhole and resting it there, as if in absolution.
Sherlock blinked at it, aware that there was something about what she had said that was pulling at his subconscious.
“Very well,” Sherlock says finally.
“You realise this isn’t a holiday?” John replied.
Sherlock and Lestrade looked at each other.
“Neither had you.” John cuts in.
John processes this.
John blinks.
“You’re still avoiding the question.”
“Really?”
“You finished them all, dear,” Mrs Hudson didn’t look up from her magazine as he casually wandered into her living room.
“I know you don’t like to talk about it.” Sherlock followed up.
“You don’t get along with your family,” The stranger obeys, “Despite all the obvious achievements you’ve made in your life. A few possible reasons for that, the most likely of which, seen as they’re not here to wave you off into the sunset, is that they don’t approve.  Judging by that phone call you’ve argued. And now you’re sitting here beating yourself up about that…”
“Your landlady,” John remembers, even through a lust induced haze.
“So are we going then?” He asks.
The letter continued, pointing out a lesser-known music hall, famous for its acoustics and classical concerts, which spoke more to the interests of the writer than it informed the reader. Then a hidden garden on top of an electricity substation, it’s green foliage and pretty benches accessible only by a vertigo-inducingly steep staircase. Then the previous address of a soviet spy. All the while he walked John never felt alone, as if Sherlock lingered close beside him or somewhere up ahead; just out of sight.
It seems that after they have covered the larger topics they have now fallen back into small talk.
John sighs, continues:
“Yes.”
“You’re really not,” Molly agreed,
“I’m sorry?”
“Please,” John says to him, aware his face is wet. He might be crying. “Please, I don’t understand.”
It’s a hospital room, John realises slowly from his position propped up on the bed, a large one and private. Even with his mind muddled by sleep and memories he has to wonder what the special circumstances are that mean he’s here.
“Of course I noticed, I just chose not to rectify the situation,”
I miss all those things.
“Where?” Sherlock asks.
“Worked out pretty well though.”
“Ordinary,” Moriarty said again, with venom. “Like the reason you’re here…”
“Where are you going?” Lestrade called after him.
“And the victim?”
When he returns Sherlock seems to have conjured up a second bar stool, possibly from under that voluminous coat.
Sherlock nudges a piece of plate with the toe of his shoe. John finds himself smiling. How long ago was it that he’d broken that?
“But…”
“You’ve moved back in?”
“It’s not all the same to me.”
Look to the ceiling. Shouldn’t this be joyous? How often has he thought of this? He even asked for it once. Right out loud. Standing next to his gravestone, your gravestone.
“Though if this were the beginning you wouldn’t know I already knew those things about you.”
Everything about the latest case pointed at suicide, and there was nothing that Sherlock could do to convince anyone otherwise. Similarly the connection to Venessa Stephens: it was obvious, important, but not strong enough to provide any kind of lead on the whereabouts of her body. And without a body, Lestrade told him firmly, it wasn’t a murder investigation.
“But I woke up in a room?”
“Come to me for cases when he wasn’t able to give you any.”
“How do you know Mike?” John asked instead after a few seconds of silence, as if he’d realised he was part of a conversation and might as well settle into it.
“I met you.” John tells him, confused. “I met you in a pub.”
“You’ve already said that.”
She blinked at him, before pulling back her hand.
“They must be taking their time.” John says.
“But I won’t come any closer. If that’s what you want?” John offers instead.
Immediately the phone in front of him started to ring.
“I was…” John starts carefully, looking up at the doctor, “…I was a hostage,”
“No,” Mike replied, “Not heard from them in ages.”
“I’m sorry to hear that.”
“Your choice or his?” Again, Sherlock jumped in as she’d barely completed her final syllable. Again, she didn’t answer.
“Yes, on occasion”
“It’s for me, but it’s not all about me…” Sherlock said, half to himself, his eyes flicking around at each item in turn.
“I was there.”
“No, but it’s complicated to go through all the deductions again. This way is simpler.”
Sherlock, his attention drawn despite his best efforts, turned from the window to study the bright reception around them. The office seemed to be doing everything in its power to give the impression of success: the high floor, the large windows with a view that everyone passing was far too busy or blasé to notice, the fish tank. Frankly, the fish tank seemed a little too on the nose, the creatures within it hanging disinterested half way up a glass box, separated from the world outside.
“Don’t think so. Mike Stamford.”
“Oh, only distantly,” Sherlock was putting on the airy tone he used when he was trying to hide the fact that he cared, deeply. “Friend of a friend. But he’ll need somewhere to stay when he’s back on his feet and I’ll need someone to look after my place while I’m away. Logical really. Just thought of it. We’d be doing each other a favour.”
“My mother isn’t well.” John says finally, turning back.
“Mrs Hudson,” Sherlock said cordially as she opened the front door before him.
“Come upstairs.” Sherlock said in a low rumble against John’s mouth.
Sherlock has been gone for three years.
“I don’t mean good, I mean, fine, it’s all fine”
“John…”
“The others.” John clarifies. “The victims,” John has a suppress and shudder at the word.
“Mr Osborne.” Sherlock concluded. Lestrade nodded once.
“Very likely not.” Sherlock confirms.
“Before I fell.” Sherlock is still talking too fast.
“Any of it.”
“I’m a doctor.” Is the only thing John can think of to reply.
“For you,” Mike set his pint in front of him.
“You told me it’s been hard.” Sherlock’s voice.
“It’s been very, pleasant, speaking with you.” Sherlock continues, haltingly.
John realised on hearing it that he really had no business dwelling on the past as he was doing. Not when she was there, trying so hard to snap him out of it.
He shutters his eyes open slowly, focusing properly on a morning filled with sunlight not much brighter than the artificial glow of the night before. He is not surprised to find the bed beside him empty; he was more surprised that Sherlock had agreed to come to bed at all. Perhaps Sherlock had grown accustomed to sleep while he had been away, John thinks, before stopping himself. Away. Now even he was doing it: Perhaps Sherlock had grown accustomed to sleep while he had been dead.
“Sorry?” John asks once he’s found his voice.
“Yes.”
“Hospital.” John confirms, then adds: “The Royal Free.”
The patient is tall and angular. Long limbs lashing out at bodies around him as three separate figures try and keep him on a gurney. The long dark coat he’s wearing only seems to complicate matters, billowing out threateningly when he moves his arms or legs.
“Yes.” Sherlock’s tone is finally relieved. John is catching on.
“What happened?”
“She doesn’t know.” John remembers,
“You’ve spoken to him?”
“Do you know anyone here?” Molly asked once Sherlock had a drink in his hand. He’d considered the punch but had decided the garish colour didn’t bode well for its chances of being palatable. He’d opted for beer instead.
“Yes.” Another cold smile. “Did you like that?”
“That’s good to hear.”
“Didn’t help?”
This time she starts to sob. The sound makes something in his chest wrench.
“It means when the police are out of their depth, which is always, they consult me.”
“None of those things happened.” John replies.
The surge of cool air his withdrawing figure leaves against John is enough to spark him into action, following close on his heels as Sherlock clatters dramatically up the staircase.
“You know, tall, brooding…” Mike supplied dramatically.
Lestrade couldn’t help but crack a small and completely inappropriate smile, glancing back quickly over his shoulder to make sure they were far enough away from the man so they couldn’t be heard.
“Yes.” He took her advice, moving past her to the coat-hooks on the landing.
John laughed out loud.
It was a place holding its breath.
“No.” John springs forward, “Don’t!” The word feels like it’s been wrung from his gut.
“Wouldn’t suit me.”
“Who did?” Sherlock asked quickly.
John’s stomach begins to roll.
“So no,” John said, halting their fumbled exchange. “But thanks.”
“Oh.” John remembers himself, “Five pints of Pride please.” He asks her.
“Yes,”
Where, from the doorway, they had appeared empty, from this angle he could see that a single book remained. He moved forward, thankful of the silent boards beneath his feet.
His reply also had the added advantage of being true, which meant that the mysterious correspondent could not fail to realise that Sherlock was on to him.
’” Sherlock repeats.
“There’s a card?”
An awkward pause.
“If it is all the same to you I don’t think I will.”
“I’ll never underestimate your aim.”
There is no response.
He stopped, dropping his shoulders.
“Medic,” John corrects,
Perhaps he fell asleep.
“It’s Doctor actually,” John finds himself correcting,
Instead he’d seen something in the top pocket of the man’s jacket, partly obscured by his left arm. Remembering the previous scalding Sherlock swiped at a nearby discarded glove and used it to ease the card from the clothing.
“Unless…” Moriarty continued, voice high.
“It wasn’t something I wanted our brand being associated with. I let her go. She wasn’t selling any papers anymore, there was no reason to keep her on.”
“No.” John pauses, pondering the relative propriety of pressing the matter, then deciding to anyway:  “Was I right?”
“No, I said that my death was necessary…”
“This is what has already happened.” The man says heavily.
“Yes,”
“And what do you remember?” The doctor asks.
“Oh. Yes.” He paused, “Of sorts. I’m needed at St Bart’s.”
“Good, I mean, I don’t mean...” John doesn’t quite know what he’s saying.
she had help,” Lestrade started again, “Then, all well and good. She can tell us. You can’t just leap to conclusions.”
They meet on Baker Street.
“She won’t tell you anything,” Sherlock groused.
“You invaded Afghanistan; I doubt I could inspire any level of nervousness.”
“You died.”
“No,” He replies.
John can’t help but smile at this bizarre stranger and their bizarre conversation.
“Alcohol can do that to you.” John points out.
They are all shouting: at John, at each other, barking orders, creating confusion and noise. John complies with the roared instruction to put his hands on his head, doing his best to ignore the chaos they’re creating to stare back at the figure standing calmly in the midst of it all.
“‘There’s been a threat on your life’,” Sherlock repeated methodically.
“I can vouch for him,” She said matter-of-factly, “He’s a friend.” Then without waiting for a reply she turned back to Sherlock and beckoned him forward down the hall. Sherlock couldn’t resist shooting the nurse a quick grin as he followed.
“He was skilled at hiding his plans.”
“An hour.”
“What?”
“It’s nothing.”
“Yes,”
“Or try.” John tries again.
“I had some help.”
“Not even the police.”
“No,” John cuts in, “Not just that. I told you that I see it. Blood and pavement and…” John’s voice chokes off slightly.
“Surely you could just pick up the phone?” John asks bewildered.
“They know you’re here?”
“Was my therapist.”
“Yes.”
“It was…” Sherlock begins.
“No… friend?” She asked, turning to follow his movements. “Flatmate?” Her tone was hopeful, “That would be joining you?”
Sherlock halted in the centre of the room, unsure about what else to do.
didn’t jump,” Sherlock replied calmly,
“He was insane.”
“One that you can’t solve from here?”
“No!” John’s anger feels like a physical being in the room. Standing between them. A yawning space: six feet and books and papers and notes and Mrs Hudson’s nice wood floor and rage.
Sherlock lets out a small huff of annoyance beside him, and John feels himself smirking.
I couldn't have seen that life ending like it did. I couldn't have thought that I’d end up here. With you.
“If you had to explain 2010 to someone, how would you do it?” John asked, a little out of the blue. Molly looked at him.
“So we should be treating this as a serial killer?” Lestrade asked.
“You cleared up the plates.” John says in disbelief. His words at a normal volume now.
“Really,” John starts again “I am.” And as John says it he realises that he’s telling the truth, whatever it was has passed, his head is clearing. “I was just,” He pauses, unsure of how to describe it, “A little dizzy.”
“I’m not sure I can swing that…”
He opened his notebook again.
The phone rang as he was finishing his signature.
“You did?” John asks in surprise.
“Believed in you? Or believed you were dead?”
Lestrade laughed.
“Where?” Lestrade demanded.
“I’ll give you some space,” She said with a smile and Sherlock nodded his thanks, brushing past her and going inside.
“You say that…” Sherlock starts to point out, but John cuts him off:
“The radio silence gave you away.” John continues conversationally. “Amazing what I can get done at the surgery without my phone going off every five minutes.” He shuts off the water, “No messages since lunchtime, I wondered if you might have a case.”
“That was short.” The stranger says in response, waving it away, before turning his attention back on John properly, “You think so?”
“But…” John starts.
“But you are right about the receptionist.” John continues, taking a drink from his beer and sitting back. “She is a bit of an idiot. She didn’t even mention you’d been there, Mrs Stevens had to tell me instead.”
He realised that until that moment he’d still been working on the assumption that all this was probably some kind of a hoax. He knew he was writing letters to someone, a person that existed and seemingly cared enough to do something so thoughtful for him as to plan that trip through London. But this person couldn’t possibly be living in a different time.
“You spiked my drink.” A breath.
One word.
“How the hell…?” Lestrade started, but Sherlock wasn’t listening.
“I would think that was obvious.” Moran flexes his grip around the gun.
John has stopped to watch a street performer, his magic act mainly hijacked by the antics of his chosen volunteers: three boys under the age of ten, their mother standing laughing on the side-lines along with the rest of the audience.
“They didn’t ask politely.”
In the shadow of where that chair no longer rests he’s moved the coffee table, left front leg a bit dodgy from years of misuse, so he can rest his tea there. Amongst the papers and his laptop: glowing faintly against the growing shadows of the evening.
The creak of a footstep in the doorway. John’s head snaps up.
“Oh,” John offers in understanding, remembering the name above the door. He turns to the man politely, “Nice place you have here,”
“How?”
“I’m sorry?”
John sighs, the last of his arsenal exhausted.
He’d spied it on his way in but hadn’t had any opportunity to collect it, instead he’d hoped to take it on his way out, as had become his routine. Instead he had been granted all the time in the world to peruse it alone.
“I’m starting to see that now.”
“So knowing what you know about the likely implications on a human body of hitting a pavement from a distance of let’s say, thirty feet, you would, as a doctor, be able to give me a pretty accurate description of injuries likely to be sustained in such a circumstance.”
“Yes, close by as much as I could be.”
“Well I doubt the next leg of the journey will be quite so stimulating.”
“No?”
She nodded, “I have some ideas,”
John is a caught short.
Another swallow, the resolve in Sherlock’s stare seems to waver with confusion.
“No progress,”
“A consulting detective.”
“Like I love you?”
“And why should the fact that I’ve taken a flat be something I should tell you?”
“It did?”
“A green one.” John says, “But that was before you saw the picture.”
“…And?”
SHERLOCK
“You seemed interesting.”
She left him hanging for a few moments, watching his confusion before smiling and offering simply:
“Them?”
“But I don’t have that kind of power.” John asserts.
“You can stop counting now.” John tells him with a fond smile.
“Yes,”
John doesn’t know whether he wants to tell him the rest. He’s lost in the feelings of the dream, remembers the words he’d called out in desperation as terrible realisation had dawned:
“Right then.”
“Yes.” Sherlock agrees.
John sighs, suddenly aware of how long they must have been having this conversation. This dark room: the streetlight through the window and the slow glow from the lamp beside the sofa, throwing half of Sherlock’s face into shadow. Was the world still going on untouched outside? Were people still laughing and drinking and talking and working, despite the fact that Sherlock fell, and that he returned?
Sudden hot, panic flashed in Sherlock’s gut and he took an abortive step backwards.
John is lost. The throb of the music, the press of the bodies, the heat and the light and the sound and this mouth; the lips and the teeth and the cool surge of a hot tongue. Heady with desire they continue to dance together. The slick press of limbs and torso and faces. They move and stroke and kiss and hold. Hands searching. Lips taking all they can from the other. All the while watching. Eyes locked together.
“He didn’t.” Lestrade.
“Let me guess,” Sherlock replied, he was still holding the most recent letter, “Vanessa Stephens.” He didn’t even frame it as a question
The man in front him opens and closes his very un-Mike-like mouth as if unable to articulate a response.
Another pause.
John returned to his little flat in Farringdon late that afternoon.
“You were still groggy.” Sherlock says, uncertain.
“And now you’re heading North.”
“Yes,”
Love Q xx
Sherlock doesn’t seem to know what to say in response. His mouth hanging open beneath the edge of John’s hand, pale eyes huge, pupils darting left and right across John’s face.
“No, about it being complicated.”
“Sherlock Holmes, friend of Dr Hooper.” He almost held out a hand, then at the last moment decided against it. “And Dr Stamford.” He added, to help matters.
10:30pm.
“Touché”
“He could be dead in four hours,” John said plainly, holding her gaze for as long as it took her to shrug a response.
His house has become a police headquarters. Overrun with strangers.
“Absolutely,”
Sherlock can’t help but look impressed at himself “Spot on then. I didn’t expect to be right about everything.”
“But you called Lestrade?” Sherlock asked the officer.
Moriarty sighed dramatically, rising and pulling the front of his jacket straight. If he’d noticed the hesitation he didn’t comment on it.
The moment is broken.
Sherlock said nothing, keeping a discrete six feet behind them as they moved, at pace, to the door.
John crumples in the face of it.
A loaded pause.
But I’ll never know the answers to those questions.
“Oh.”
“She wouldn’t let me see you,”
“Well yes,” She laughs, a little uncomfortably.
“Then what are you doing here?” The stranger seems to take a long time over each word.
“What are you talking about?” John asks in a groan. Fingers finding every patch of his skin he can reach, touching, grabbing, the memories.
A thought occurs; John whirls around and back into the living room:
Sherlock stopped. Mike Stamford. A birthday party. Had it been twelve weeks?
“I was at work.” John says, stating the obvious again.
“Why you?”  Sherlock asks from the ledge. “Why you alone?”
“Yes, definitely,” He agreed. Then looked back at his sandwich,
“What then?”
“Six o’clock, staff room,” She waved him to the door, “I’ll see you there.”
“Or is it the other way around? I’m not sure I can understand this anymore. People don’t do that. People don’t. You do. Cause: you. Effect: I don’t believe anything you do any more.”
“I did,” They continue to move, to touch, to stroke, to connect.
“Oh, you mean description, context…”
“You tried to stop me believing in you.”
“And Sherlock?”
“Oh god, thank you,” He stopped, laughing, once they were in the corridor. She offered him a bright smile in response.
“Somewhere quieter.”
“Family problems?” A deep voice asks. John looks over at him.
“All my life.” Sherlock answers matter-of-factly.
Sherlock stopped, looking back.
“It’s always you, Sherlock.” John says in a rush of emotion.
“You looked pretty angry at it.” She pointed out,
“You really haven’t been trained for this.” The stranger purrs, an undertone of something like amusement.
“Yes.” Sherlock said neutrally. He disliked stating the obvious.
“Bison, yes,” Sherlock’s real concentration was on the item he was unwrapping. Mrs Hudson turned back to him just as it appeared from it’s plastic prison.
“I did?”
“Yes.” Sherlock replies. “The Science of Deduction,”
A man who was late.
“John, Mrs Hudson is home.”
“Ah.”
“John’s in the army,” She offers, as if feeling she should make up for ignoring him up to now by showing him off. Or perhaps, John thinks, she feels needs to boast of his achievements in comparison to Sherlock’s.
“Yes.” Sherlock doesn’t comply,
I can’t tell you that from the moment I first met you that I understood that we were part of a whole. That you were the head to my heart; stoic and strong, logical, occasionally to a fault. It must seem obvious but it took me a long time to recognise that in the two of us. It took me longer to recognise that in myself: I’d always thought I was the one who lived in the head. The way I was raised, the choices I made in my life, they were based on that assumption, the heart didn't come into it. I believed in my head; logic and reason, but once I knew you I realised I was only pale imitation of those qualities. I could never match up to the way you inhabit them.
“So?”
“You did. But then…?”
“It’s still empty,” Mrs Hudson said without preamble as she walked with him back out into the hallway.
John comes back to the present. Sherlock staring at him. He realises that his anger has ebbed with the memory.
“A skull,”
Sherlock was standing just outside the door of the staff room, contemplating a cigarette and wondering why he’d decided that today was the day he was going to try and be sociable.
“Which book?”
“What are you doing?” He asks, now even more stunned.
“John.” He said out loud, to himself.
There’s one figure he’s noticed in particular. Dancing alone amid the crowd, long body lithe and pale beneath a deep purple shirt open at least two buttons too many. Though the space surrounding them is full of touching hands, of stroking and rubbing and grinding, no one seems to feel it fitting to touch this figure, encased as he is in an aura of unattainability. Even his dancing has elegance, long limbs keeping time in a manner that should be clumsy but somehow isn’t. John is entranced, finds himself staring, before realising that a pair of pale steel eyes have turned to stare back at him.
“I love you too,” He said. Then stopped, bashful as he realised they’d spoken over each other.
“I find that hard to believe.”
“You didn’t make any more?”
“Look at you, all happy. It’s not decent,” Mrs Hudson replies, her tone sounding more as if she’s in receipt of a compliment rather than an explanation of what sounds like a violent crime. Four violent crimes.
“Yes.” Sherlock has plucked a photograph of John and Mary from the mantle and is studying it intently,
John keeps the stranger’s eyes as he’s bundled past. A familiar stranger. Someone who is and isn’t someone that John knows. Someone who’s dead. Someone who has been dead for three years and spoke to him through a phone while his image still stood before him. But this man isn’t him. John knows that. The same way he knows that this is happening. That this has happened.
“Right.” He pulled a notebook out of his jacket pocket and jotted something down. “Can I ask why you’re back?”
“You were there.” John tells him, voice quieter.
“Where are you going?” Lestrade asked, calling down the corridor again to him.
So John dances, not too far gone to notice that of the people dancing by his side the vast majority are men: tall and short and big and small and blonde and brunette and muscled and slim and completely clothed and… not, but patently male, shockingly male. It’s not a surprise. This isn’t the first time he’s been to such a place, probably won’t be the last and though it’s not something John will shout from the hilltops when he’s dressed in full fatigues it’s not something he’ll be ashamed of.
“What’s up now?” He asks,
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. “I miscalculated.”
“I know who M is.” Sherlock’s expression widened slowly with glee. He leapt to his feet. “Of course, it makes perfect sense!”
“You’re alive.” John tells him in the face of his silence, his words slow.
“I remember.”
“I don’t leap,” Sherlock mumbled.
John stopped, his bottle to his lips, looking at her in surprise.
“I don’t know, tanned bloke, no uniform. Grey hair.”
“Sherlock is dead.” Is John’s blunt reply.
Sherlock rolled his eyes a little but accepted it as the gesture of affection that it so clearly was.
Inside, John was framed clearly in the window, rifling through the side pockets of his pack, looking for something. Sherlock watched him, willing him to look up, to look at him, but the man behind the glass kept searching, unaware of his audience.
“All the time,” He said softly,
“Of course it was wrong of him to think that, and I told him, over and over, but would he listen?”
Finally he reached forward and answered it.
They continue to stare.
He paid the driver with haste, thanking him profusely for the piece of blank receipt paper and the pen that he’d made use of on the journey across London. The note he’d written was now clutched close to his chest as if made of something precious.
Another pause.
“You know where it came from?” Sherlock asked.
John swallows. For some reason he’s afraid.
Sherlock nods once and then crouches, a practised flick of one arm causing his coat to fan out on the floor behind him as he does so. John is so caught up in watching it that he fails to realise how close Sherlock’s face has become until he speaks.
“No, well, that’ll be sorted now,” He waved vaguely back at the room and started to walk away.
“I should probably get back to work,” She said breezily with a smile. John barely had enough time to nod an acknowledgement before she’d turned and was gone.
John paused and looked about him, the voice of the writer so real in his mind that it was as if the man had stepped from the page and sat beside him. He scanned down the rest of the letter, smiling to himself.
“Yes.” John pauses “It doesn’t matter what you think your actions said up until that point. That pretty much negated everything that went before it.”
Lestrade blinked back at him.
“…I’m just trying to get through to you.” Mycroft ignores him again, “I want you to be prepared.”
The silence is deafening.
“Seems a tad… dramatic,” Sherlock broke the silence, clicking his ‘c’.
It took roughly twenty cold minutes before the note was replaced.
John’s hands on the back of his own head. Turn around. Calm.
John was finding leaving this place harder than he had imagined he would. He’d felt more at home in this strange little flat than he’d felt in a long time. These ramshackle possessions beginning to feel so much like his own that he was surprised when he discovered that everything he owned still fit neatly into the two holdalls he’d brought with him all those months ago.
“That does seem like your intention, yes”
“You seem,” Sherlock replies, pausing momentarily to search for the word: “Nervous.”
“We’ll give it time,” He says, flipping the chart closed and preparing to leave, “You had a few people scared for a while there. You take it easy.”
“Yes,” Sherlock’s response remains emotionless.
“Well,” She sighed, when the moment passed. “I must let you go,” It was her way of telling him that she had other things she should be doing, “I’m sure you’ll be wanting to make the most of this lovely weather,”
“You wrote the headline?”
“I don’t… know.”
He was standing in the middle of the pavement on Baker Street, almost exactly a week after he’d stood there reading previously. As before, his stomach was nicely full of the tea and cake provided by Mrs Hudson and as before, he’d found a note in the pigeonhole.
“Really?”
Sherlock didn’t allow him to see his smile.
“On the crockery,”
“Who are you?” John repeats the question again,
“I liked to see you wear it.”
“John, what’s wrong?” From two paces away John watches the light come back on in Sherlock’s eyes, concern growing in their deep blue pools as they watch the obvious fear in John’s face.
“Sorry?” John asks, moving from his face to take in the stranger’s smart suit and thick coat. The pub is warm, John’s sweating in his shirtsleeves, he has no idea how this man can stand it.
“Guilt got the best of him.” Lestrade suggested, shrugging.
“Mrs Hudson.” John starts, ineloquently “Her sister. She moved house. Out to the country.”
“Fill this out for me please and wait over there,” She said neutrally, nodding at the huddle of plastic chairs behind him. Her tone was such that he’d half put out a hand to take the proffered clipboard before he caught himself.
Molly’s eyes widened in surprise, a small flush touching the apples of her cheeks.
“Yes you,” Sherlock confirms.
“That’s more than I deserve,” He says slowly.
“You would say that.” Mike said suggestively.
“No.” Sherlock stated firmly, “I’ve made arrangements for someone to stay and look after my things. You shan’t be lonely,”
He returned.
And he agreed.
“You just said I should tell… some people… something.”
“At the moment, yes, you won’t let me explain.”
“Victim is female,” Lestrade said as Sherlock approached, “Sylvia Jones, thirty-eight, self-employed, lived alone...” Lestrade turned to lead him through the building,
“I’m just giving this doctor here a moment to catch up with my notes.”
“I guess I did. Trust you to worry about your maths.”
The stranger looks at him frankly; John can’t help but be surprised at the colour of his eyes.
“Oh.”
He comes up short in the doorway to the bedroom. His shoulders falling as he surveys the mess: bed unmade, the duvet and pillows in such disarray it’s impossible to tell how many figures had slept there. John remembers doing the damage himself: Covers. Floor.
They smiled, awkward.
“I was being polite,”
“You featured.” John says vaguely.
“Could have been his name.”
His words are confident, spoken with weight and an air of the dramatic. They cause John’s world to pause for a second, tilting gently in his mind at a familiar name spoken by familiar lips. Something tugs at his subconscious. This is wrong.
They meet in the city.
“Your face is tanned but no tan above the wrists. You’ve been abroad, but not sunbathing. The fading of the tan lines and the relative lack of upkeep on the haircut however say you’ve been out of the military some while, six months perhaps, definitely not yet a year. Wounded in action I’d wager from the cane you have hidden down the side of the seat and the fact that you’ve been making do on just a military pension since your return.”
John tips his head back into the cushions in bafflement. Sherlock listens again.
Once they’d made it to her kitchen she stood in the centre of it in confusion, Sherlock whirling about the room, checking everything he could think of. The officers took up posts in the hall and doorway.
“Yes.”
“I succeeded, for a while.”
“You mean the guy with the coat and the…” John casts around, “Cheekbones?”
“And if she had help…” Lestrade started. Sherlock opened his mouth to jump in, but Lestrade knew what he was going to say. “’If! Sherlock,” Lestrade glared.
“Yes,” He smiled in recognition, taking it.
John blinks.
“A waking one perhaps.” Sherlock counters quickly,
