He eventually retweeted the video with a caption of: ‘gotta make assholes like that scared to show their ugly faces and ugly values’.
“You must be Steve, I’ve heard so much about you, Tony is smitten,” she made her way forward, looking him over, “it’s nice to finally meet you.”
“I’m sure I can handle that, thanks, Capsicle,” sarcasm practically dripped through the speakers, the roar of his boots sending him off in the direction of the further ship.
Steve stood huffing slightly, before turning to the teenagers. “Are you guys okay?”
He heard his phone over the radio, getting up and heading into the bedroom to pick it up, quickly making his bed before reading the message.
“Sure, I don’t mind, but you get to see me in what I’m wearing, c’mon, just a hint?”
SHIELD had been helpful with his request to keep his identity secret. They planned to pick him up any time he had a mission and it would always be the same team who were by secrecy, they’d deleted a lot of personal information from several files which had been made back in the 40s, he was grateful for that.
Steve took the next bag that was handed to him, turning and heading back into the changing room. He was near certain he heard Tony say something about making the trousers tighter but he wasn’t sure.
Sam’s attention quickly shifted to the kids behind Steve, asking if they were okay while Riley checked Steve’s knuckles for breaks, cleaning the blood off them with a tissue.
The roar of the engines took over the silence for a while, each member dealing with their injuries, getting comfortable for the three-hour flight home. Natasha was the one to break the silence between them.
“Yeah, stuff being the main products that you sell and make a difference in the world with. Don’t undersell yourself like that.”
“Thanks again, Mr. Rogers, you’re a really great guy,” Peter told him quietly before letting go and running up his steps and disappearing into the apartment block, his blue, pink and white flag blowing behind him.
Tony woke up around an hour later, jolting himself awake and wiping fresh tears off his face before his eyes found Steve’s face. Before Tony shut off his dazed look before his gaze turned to stone.
“Do you need a ticket?”
Steve knew the question was coming. It was inevitable.
Tony laughed, leaning back in his chair, squeezing their joined hands.
The trio had watched some of the performers, blushing furiously when one of the singers grabbed his hand and lead him up on to the little stage at the side of the parade, dancing with him during the song, ignoring Sam and Riley who were recording the whole thing. The singer thanked him after the song had finished, winking at him as Steve headed back off the stage, still red in the face.
Missions weren’t fun, they just passed time that Steve seemed to have an abundance of. It was like clockwork for him: go in, get done, debrief, go home. He repeated the cycle every time he heard the little Avengers beacon go off. Every time his heart leapt in his chest with the idea that he could be seeing Tony again. And every time he was let down when the red and gold armour never showed up.
“I’m busy. Sorry, Widow.”
“You really don’t have to get me a new suit, Tony.”
Steve didn’t even know they made cars in this specific purple Tony was wearing, although he imagined the billionaire didn’t really need to worry about the price of getting the car customized to fit his whole look. Steve thought it was a tad over the top but this was Tony Stark.
Steve read the message a few times, a small frown on his face as he read it before laughing quietly, tilting his head up and looking up at the blank ceiling before back down at his phone, laying back into the soft throw covering his bed.
“You told me that was the 16th! I cleared my schedule for it!” Silence followed before Tony quickly looking down at his watch.
“Peter’s gonna have a field day when he finds out Captain America saved him from transphobes,” Tony grinned, leaning his head against Steve’s shoulder, cuddling up against him.
TS: Oh stop it you ;)
There was a well-groomed man stood off to the side who jumped into action when the pair came in, “Mr. Stark! It’s so good to see you!”
“Hey, man, you okay?”
He saw Tony turn his head to look at Steve then back at the picture. “That’s the first time someone’s called the suit beautiful before, people usually saw tacky.”
“Y’know, you could announce you’re back and use it to just promote movements and issues around the world,” he told him, looking up from his tablet.
Moving on didn’t work but just getting through each day was enough. Being numb was okay as long as he managed to get through what he needed to do. He could work with numb.
“What about Loki?” Thor asked, comms crackling in Steve’s ear.
“Please, please let me explain, Tony. SHIELD has been helping me keep my identities separate. I wanted a normal life outside being Cap, outside the Avengers. I couldn’t tell you because--”
He was lectured. Don’t do this, don’t do that. Steve was sick of listening. He was sick of all the advice, of Natasha’s sympathy, of Sam’s effort to console him. Just sick of it all.
SR: It was more about putting assholes in their place, but you can take it as an ego boost if you’d like to.
“Oh I absolutely am, but I can’t let people start thinking I have a heart, the press wouldn’t like that one bit,” his smirk slipped slightly from his face, only for a fraction, but it was enough for Steve to see, “anyway, let’s move our topic away from the kid, I’d like to know how you turned into an internet star.”
He watched the bot for a few more moments before looking back inside the package, freezing when he saw the chocolate. He slowly picked it out, staring down at it. It was one that he had told Tony he liked a few months back but as Cap. They were on a long flight home back to New York from East Russia, Tony’s suit had given out and had a lift with the jet. Natasha and Clint were asleep but himself and Tony were awake, idly chatting about anything. Tony had mentioned a brand of chocolate he’d liked and Steve told him his own preference for a particular brand, saying it was the nicest he’d had since waking up. Not overly sweet like most types, but a softer taste.
The team had split up: Clint with Thor and Hulk. Steve with Tony and Natasha.
“Fine, let’s go.”
Tony was fine, his usual chipper self after a fight. He had a few bumps and bruises but he was fine, nonetheless. He had flown ahead, collecting the jet and landing not far from where the three were walking, announcing his arrival over comms.
“Oh stop that, I’m sure you wake up and you’re stunning,” Tony laughed, “pretty sure the Iron Man suit has given me more wrinkles than normal aging.”
Steve nodded, taking the hanger and heading into the changing room. He unzipped the suit, looking over it and nodding before undressing and hanging up his own clothes. He pulled the dark green suit trousers over his legs, smiling when they fit well. He slipped the crisp, white shirt over his shoulders, buttoning it up and tucking it into the trousers, zipping up the fly and doing the button up. He quickly fastened the waistcoat and slipped the jacket on.
Steve’s blood ran cold when he saw it.
Steve slowly got up, watching Tony’s shoulders shake, watching him cover his face with his hand. He took a few steps towards him, reaching for him.
Steve wanted to crawl into a dark room and never leave. He thanked the low lighting because the rest of the team would have definitely seen his blush. He kept his eyes low, his head lowered. Tony liked him. That wasn’t something Steve knew how to process, his heart beating fast in his chest.
The day carried on, they watched more performers, bought various little trinkets from the stalls. Steve ended up with a little enamel trans flag pin and a matching bisexual flag one that he attached to the front of his shirt.
When Steve didn’t answer, he carried on.
He retweeted the video, smiling as he wrote the caption, ‘make transphobes afraid again! P.s the kids are all okay’. He pressed send and then left his phone, finishing his coffee and then going to do his washing up, putting the radio on as he completed a few chores around his apartment, coming back to his phone a few hours later.
The four teens, Steve now knew as Peter, Gwen, MJ, and Johnny, were all extremely thankful for Steve, thanking him and confiding in him about their fears that something like that would happen.
Saturday came quicker than Steve thought it would.
Gabriel smiled and took the last hanger off the rail, handing it to Steve, “go give that one a try, it’s not green but it’ll look amazing. I’ll make sure Tony doesn’t drool all over the place.”
“How about a picture of us? Start strong and as I mean to go on?”
Waking up before Tony in Stark Tower was strange. The room was still dark despite the sun being up, the tinted windows blocking the rays to let the sleeping genius continue his slumbering.
“Well.. he hasn’t yet so I don’t see why you can’t get a free coffee with him, it might be fun.”
Steve left his phone on the table, going to open the windows, letting himself breathe in the New York air when he heard his phone buzz, scrambling to grab, trying to ignore how pathetic that felt.
“Not a picture? Not a bit more of a hint?”
“You know? That’s it?”
“I’ll see what I can do, Pete.”
He glanced to the side to see Tony sat in the chair next to his bed, obvious tear tracks on his face, puffy red eyes. Steve had seen him sleep peacefully before but this wasn’t one of those times.
SR: Pretty sure you’ve already woo’ed me, but sure.
Clint had fractured fingers and ribs, Natasha had sustained some form of head injury, which ended in Steve carrying her back to the Quinjet. Steve himself had broken an ankle from a nasty fall but it was already healing. Bruce and Thor were nowhere to be found, but that was normal for the pair, they would take time to rekindle and calm themselves before they joined back with the team.

“Sorry, boys, hate to break this up, but really, Tony? You’ve only been here five minutes.”
Tony still talked about him. Tony still kept the things Steve gave him.
He’d got the basics. Like the calling and even the texting was working out for him. Apps were a whole new level of confusing, a new level of scary for him. He’d fought Nazis, but now he couldn’t download solitaire on his phone? He wouldn’t settle for that.
“Well, at least you’ve met Natasha now I suppose,” Tony grinned, taking Steve’s arm again.
“Not yet, I’m gonna ask him to do something though, he seems kinda artsy, maybe the MOMA?”
“Good, you take the furthest boat, keep the perimeter, make sure no one gets away, me and Widow will get dropped down on to the first ship, you’ll have to help us over to the second boat once we’ve cleaned it out. Everyone know their roles?”
For the first time, Steve agreed with him and lead them back to the ship.
“Are you crazy?”
“There was this really handsome guy in one of the pictures, he flies in this awesome suit, I thought it was really cool.”
“You’d be surprised. I’ll see you at the gala, Captain.”
They pulled away, Tony instantly picking up his coffee cup and taking another long drink. Steve copied him before moving back to the pan, folding the eggs in half and letting them cook again. He grabbed two plates from the cupboards and set them on the side, smiling when he saw Tony watching. He plated up the omelettes and set the plates down in front of Tony.
“Because everyone likes having a backup, Cap, we’re here to make sure you don’t hurt a hair on your pretty head,” Tony answered, flicking a few switches on the control panel, turning in his chair to look at him.
He didn’t open it right away, he turned the radio on and made himself a cup of coffee before settling down on the couch with the box in front of him. He tore past the tape and opened it up, raising his eyebrows at the amount of stuff that Tony had packed.
Steve felt his phone vibrate next to his leg, looking down at the screen to see Tony’s name shining on the screen. He opened the message and scoffed, which turned into soft laughter.
He headed into the living area, heading to the door and opening it, looking down at the man stood with a large parcel at his feet.
“Thank you, JARVIS,” Steve replied, getting two mugs out and placing them under the machine, moving away to look around the kitchen again.
On the top, there was a little note that had his name written in slightly messy handwriting, he picked it up and set it on the table before looking back at the box. There were several packets of expensive looking dried fruit; blueberries, apricots, even banana chips. He picked up the packets and moved them on to his table, looking back at the box. There were all sorts; socks with little Iron Man helmets on them, a packet of coffee from a place in Brazil, a bar of soap that smelled of lavender, a few books nestled towards the bottom, a bar of chocolate and another little box at the bottom.
“Oh, I don’t doubt that at all,” he laughed, letting Tony twine their fingers together, squeezing their hands. “How was the trip?”
“He’s in my intern programme, he visits the tower twice a week to work on whatever, whether it’s his own school stuff and I just help, or if I need a helping hand in the lab,” Tony answered, taking a drink of his own coffee, “he’s a really good kid, don’t tell him I told you that though.”
And that’s how Steve ended up with two bisexual flags painted on both cheeks and a trans flag tied tightly around his shoulders, covered in glitter, grinning and strolling along with Sam and Riley.
Steve woke bright and early the next day, smiling as he felt no pain in his legs, taking a deep breath and testing his newly patched lung and ribs.
“Does Captain America have a phone?” Tony asked, staring at Steve and his bag, eyebrows raised.
“Stark’s meeting us there, said he’s updating his scanners or something, I tend not to ask about all the tech stuff but figured you’d wanna know,” Clint called back to him, flicking a few switches on the panel above his head.
TS: Okay, I don’t know if it’s me but it usually is, I get if I’m too much, it’s overwhelming for most people, I’ll leave you alone. I’m sorry.
And he was sitting here blaming Steve because of Bucky. He could never forgive Bucky for what happened, the thought made him feel physically sick, he walked over, down the steps and sat onto the sofa in front of the phone.
“Afraid you can’t take it Stark?” Steve raised his eyebrows, it made Tony clench his fists into the soft material of the couch.
Soon his cries softened to panted moans and Tony let him pull his cock out of his mouth. Steve flopped back into the bedding, his breath heavy and ragged.
“Well if you actually stayed around long enough you’d experience them a lot more.” Tony replied between nibbling the skin of Steve’s neck.
Then Steve crawled up Tony and forced his mouth onto Tony’s own, Tony tasted himself on Steve’s lips and drew in a heavy breath, kissing Steve back as hard as his tired body would allow. He pulled Steve into him, Steve’s still dribbling cock dripping down Tony’s thigh as he slid his leg up and down Steve’s own. Steve left Tony’s mouth and worked his way down Tony’s neck and onto his chest, where he bit down hard.
Clint’s face flashed behind his closed eyelids, his face when Tony visited him when he found out where they were being held. The betrayal…
Steve just watched him rant with an amused look on his face, not even attempting to move his body to let Tony pull his suit off easier.
Steve broke eye contact and sighed, stroking Tony’s cheek before flopping onto his back and scrubbing his face with his hands.
“No, you can’t hate anyone can you? You know I wanted to hate you for so long, then I met you, and I tried to give myself reasons to hate you but I couldn’t. And then this. We were a family all of us. We used to have parties and tell jokes and train together. And there was me and you, keeping this family together, your ridiculously overwhelming sense of justice and my genius keeping the world turning as it should.” Tony’s shoulders dropped, though the anger was still radiating through him.
“It would be.” Steve kept his gaze down.
Steve sighed and pushed his hand down to cup Tony’s cock.
Tony didn’t need anymore encouragement, he dropped himself onto Steve once more and set to the skin under his jaw, taking it in his teeth and biting down, feeling Steve’s body respond, his fingernails digging into Tony’s ass so pleasurably. He reached up and entangled one hand into Steve’s hair, tugging on it rhythmically as he started to work his hips into Steve’s. The hand that was still in Steve’s boxers worked their way down (and hey, there actually was hair on Steve's body who knew!) to the hard part in the middle and he stroked his fingers up Steve’s length, feeling his cock twitch and grow under them. He slipped his fingers round Steve’s length and started to move his hand, slowly, measurably.
“Oh I am far from gramps, what about you, I’m surprised you didn’t lose your voice with the amount of screaming you did. I thought you were trying to keep a low profile?”
Tony pressed himself into Steve and Steve inhaled sharply as he felt Tony’s erection against his stomach, Tony took the opportunity to grind into him and catch his bottom lip in between his teeth as he kissed him, biting down until Steve hissed with pain and Tony let go, getting a satisfied look at the bruised lip before Steve snaked an arm around his neck and pulled him back so their lips were together once again. Tony could feel the heat rising off of Steve’s body and it only fuelled him more, Steve seemed to run hotter than the average person (pun not intended, well, okay yeah) and it was driving Tony mad.
Tony glared at him but Steve was smiling under his hands. He groaned dramatically and dropped them to his side.
He continued to grind his hips leisurely into Steve, enjoying watching Steve’s balls roam around his abdomen as he moved Steve around.
Steve rolled off Tony and lay down next to him, pushing Tony across the sofa cushions until he was lying on his side, trailing his fingers across Tony’s stomach.
Steve ran his hands up and down Tony’s bare legs as the younger man straddled his waist. He huffed a laugh as he looked into Tony’s brown eyes that were alight and sparkling. “You weren’t kidding Stark.”
The phone rang and Tony jumped, startled out of his reverie. He stared at it for a moment before shaking his head and grabbing it. Here goes nothing. He flipped up the phone case and put it to his ear once more.
“You’d better believe I’m harder, what about you super soldier, did they super size all of you or leave that part out?”
Tony pushed his hands up Steve’s back, then raked his fingernails down the smooth flesh there. Steve whimpered and squirmed, but didn’t try to move away. Instead he let out a breathy whisper that Tony barely heard. “Again…”
Steve tore his eyes from the walls and launched himself at Tony, his bulk causing the bed to bounce Tony backwards.
“You are awful at talking dirty.” He chuckled.
He was off somewhere, gallivanting about with the bastard who murdered his parents, murdered them, as in physically killed them, strangled his fucking mother. How? How can he be okay with any of that? How can he look Bucky in the eyes and be okay? He couldn’t even think about Steve without wanting to break something. The second time he read the letter he punched his table and fractured a knuckle.
“Why? Should I be, am I getting his sloppy seconds or something.” Tony raised his eyebrows and shrugged.
Steve raised one eyebrow and gave Tony a half smirk. “Where’s the bedroom here?”
“I was actually just admiring your libido Stark. You finally have me beat.”
“Hey Tony, what…?” Steve scowled at him but he pulled back after rummaging through a small set of drawers beside the bed.
Steve shrugged but didn’t take his hand away.
“You weren’t announcing it either.”
“I get the feeling that you want to hit me.” Steve was watching Tony’s hands carefully, but not nervously. There was always that calm acceptance about Steve that drove Tony mad.
“Oh god, oh Tony you have no idea how good that feels.”
Steve stiffened under him as if he’d just received an electric shock.
“Uh I beat you in a load of departments, genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist, remember?”
Steve chuckled and left himself laying there with his head turned, watching Tony gather up two glasses and pour a generous shot of scotch into each. He reached under the bar and grabbed some ice cubes, dropping them into the deep brown liquid. He walked back over to Steve and shoved him over, before leaning up against the back of the sofa and shoving a glass into Steve’s hands.
“Now I know you can’t get drunk but you can still appreciate the fine taste of this stuff right?”
“I guess it was, Iron Man.”
“I’ve spent the best part of a year alone, wandering about, staying with different people or on my own. I’ve been unable to stay in one place too long or stay with anyone too long because I can’t, because what happened haunts me. What you think you were the only one? The only one kept awake at night? The only one staring at that phone for hours on end? I tried and tried and tried to hate you, hate all of them but I couldn’t.” Steve’s whole body was tensed and heated.
“Neutralised? Until some other whack job scientist decides he wants to make him his play toy again and then boom we have the Winter Soldier on our hands again, how many times must this happen before we actually manage to kill him, and probably you in the process. Do you know just how close we were to killing each other over this whole thing? Can you look me in the eye and say you weren’t prepared to kill me for him?”
“You’re right, it’s always been me and you and yeah, maybe this was an eventuality, there was always chemistry there, Nat used to really rib me about it.”
“You look like a slapped ass Rogers.’
He put them both onto Steve’s boxers and then thought better, and instead leaned down; catching the material between his teeth causing Steve to moan loud enough for Tony to be glad the place was empty. He worked them down, his fingers tugging at the edges of the legs as his top lip and nose brushed the head of Steve’s shaft, he could smell the salt of Steve’s cum already and it excited him greatly. Steve’s hand let go of Tony and Tony pulled himself down Steve’s legs until finally that glorious creature was released.
and Tony had managed to crack out
“Even though you’ll disappear on me, and somehow have to explain to your new friends that you were shacked up with me for however long this lasts and I would love to be a fly on the wall for that, I don’t regret this Steve.”
He flipped the cap with his thumb and squeezed it down into his hand that was currently working its way inside Steve. He needed more than two fingers for this. He lathered up a third finger and pushed it inside, keeping a steady rhythm.
Buckle up kids, it's about to get bumpy in here.
Without another word he drew back and took Steve in his mouth. Steve blew out the breath he didn’t know he’d been holding and stared open mouthed as Tony swallowed him as easily as if he were an average sized man; Tony grasped Steve’s hips and held on as he pushed Steve into his mouth until his beard was scratching Steve’s balls, it was a strange, foreign feeling. Steve could feel his cock hitting the back of Tony’s throat and yet Tony never faltered, he swallowed onto Steve’s cock and sucked, hollowing his cheeks and causing Steve to grab at the bed with enough force to rip the sheets. Tony took one hand and slapped the side of his ass hard for it, making Steve yelp, but he kept going.
“You’d be surprised Tony.”
Having Steve in his hand was like trying to hold on to a slippery metal pole and Tony marvelled at it. Not the only Iron Man here, Tony thought and laughed to himself, ignoring Steve’s glance. As Steve’s breathing became heavier and his fingers dug into the cushion beside Tony’s head Tony simultaneously slowed his thrusts down and his pumping, this was one fight Steve was going to lose. Steve threw his head back and let out a breathy moan, flicking his hips up into Tony’s own, trying to keep him going. No chance, I can 100% guarantee this is something I am actually better at than he is.
“You’d be wrong about that, that’s where you and I differ you see Boy Scout.” Tony replied sarcastically with a mock salute.
Tony took his free hand and ran it through his messy hair. “So how long have you had the hots for me then? I’m not expecting undying declarations here Steve my man, I’ve been in love and this isn’t it. I’m just curious as to what goes on in America’s golden boy’s head.”
“I know.”
Steve brought his head back up and looked at Tony with those piercing baby blues. He opened his mouth to speak, then swallowed and let out the breath he’d been holding. “I don’t really know I guess.”
“Jesus Christ you’ve been here five minutes and you’re already defending him. Why is it so hard for you to just accept what he did?! He’s the WINTER FREAKING SOLDIER FOR CHRIST’S SAKE!” Tony threw his arms in the air, feeling himself go red.
The phone Steve had left him, and the note, so wrecked from being crumpled up, binned, thrown around, unfurled and re read and scrunched up again that it was barely readable. Tony bit his lip until it hurt. He’d almost thrown the phone out of the window so many times.
Tony felt himself begin to climax and his thrusts became erratic, Steve held onto Tony’s cock, pushing back into his thrusts and then Tony was crying out Steve’s name in between expletives. He felt himself explode into Steve and as he pulled back and continued to thrust he looked down to see cum already leaking out and down to his balls from the edges of the condom, that was one hell of a load he’d just shot into Steve’s perfect ass.
“Bucky is gone.” Steve swallowed hard and Tony looked at him, really looked at him, he saw Steve almost turn away from the look in his eyes. “He put himself back under; he’s gone until they can help him, get the control off of his mind. He can’t deal with what he’s done, you can hate him all you like but he is doing the right thing.”
This surprised a laugh out of Steve and Tony bent down, capturing his mouth before he could stop laughing. Steve took in a breath from the side of his mouth and kissed Tony back, he ran a hand up Tony’s shoulders and down his back to his boxers, he slipped a hand underneath the elastic to cup Tony’s buttocks, squeezing hard enough to elicit a groan from Tony. He broke the kiss to look into Steve’s eyes quickly, then dipped his head to Steve’s cheek, brushing his lips across Steve’s ear.
Tony caught his breath, gulping down as Steve pulled his lips up Tony’s cock and swallowed, causing that gorgeous mouth to tighten around his tip, he couldn’t stop himself from thrusting into Steve’s mouth, he expected Steve to stop him but instead Steve wrapped his large hands around Tony’s ass and pulled him into him, taking Tony’s fully erect cock all the way down until Tony could feel the tightening flesh around his tip. Steve sucked in hard as Tony thrust into him, hollowing his cheeks and sliding his mouth up and down with a measured calm that made Tony want to scream at him. He gripped the back of Steve’s head and continued to stare down, watching his slick cock slide in and out of Steve’s mouth, he could feel the precum leaking from the tip of his penis and then he felt Steve lap it up with his tongue and he let out a guttural, primal groan that made Steve squeeze his ass hard enough to most likely leave handprint shaped bruises. Steve now started to pull Tony to him in time with Tony’s thrusts, letting Tony fuck his mouth as hard as he dared. Steve took it all, swallowing down on him as if he were made for it.
“You know I can’t tell you that, not until this is all over.”
“You bet your ass I do, I have to work fucking hard to keep up you the rest of you you know, I swear Thor was born with fucking pecs.” He scowled but it only made Steve chuckle, his body vibrating underneath Tony. “So do I just pull this shit off like a leotard or do I have some more bells and whistles to fail at undoing?” He crinkled his nose at Steve, who obliged by taking his hands off Tony and unclipping the belt harness what the fuck ever it was.
“Please Tony, fuck me into oblivion, I’ll do whatever you want.”
“Well this is weird…” Tony looked from Steve’s chest to his face then to the ground and back again. “Certainly never had this happen to me before…” He looped an arm up around Steve’s neck and sighed dramatically, fluttering his eyelashes at Steve.
“I lost because I held back, you didn’t, I held back because of you, not because of him. Through out everything that has happened I have always been classed as the wild card. But where Bucky is involved there is no sense to you, you would have killed me that day if you had needed to and I couldn’t bring myself to do the same. You’ve become dangerous, something none of us expected of you. I certainly never thought I’d reach a point where I actually thought you were going to kill me. God the only reason you didn’t was because of your little hat trick with my arc reactor. Tell me you wouldn’t have. Please dear god.” Tony looked away and dragged his fingers through his hair. “Tell me I’m wrong.” Tony looked back to Steve, who wouldn’t meet his gaze.
“Not going to do it, nope, nope, not going to, nah uh, nein, nicht, nei.” Tony paced up and down in the compound, arms crossing and re-crossing as he looked down at the phone. “I will not do it, that absolute goddamn bastard left us, left me, for that fucking prick with long hair and a stupid shiny arm, not left me like that, left me like, fucking left me damn it! I can’t, I can’t look at him and not see Barnes, I can’t look at him and not see the car, my parents, everything.”
“Oh you’ll take it alright Rogers. You might regret it though. I really, really like it rough.”
He got to the top of the stairs and stopped, looking around. A lavish open plan bedroom stood before him, the window wall continuing upwards from below to span two thirds of the slightly rounded room.
He rode out the climax, still pumping Steve’s cock as Steve’s cum ran over his fingers and dripped into a pool on the sofa and soaked in,
“Well you know what? You can shove your justice right up your perky little –“
Steve broke the kiss and looked down at Tony, looking all the way down, taking him in from his vantage point.
He took Tony’s skin between his teeth and worked it in his mouth until blood bloomed underneath the skin leaving a large purple bruise. He brushed his lips down a bit more and started again, Tony pushed his fingers into Steve’s hair and threw is head back, allowing himself to catch his breath as Steve’s mouth worked itself down his now hyper sensitive body. Steve reached Tony’s nipple and took it in his mouth, dancing his tongue across it, flicking it and sucking on it. Tony closed his eyes and tightened his grip on Steve’s hair. Steve finally let go and looked up at Tony, the glow from Tony’s arc reactor causing Steve’s eyes to sparkle.
And Steve does laugh, dry and a little bit hoarse, but he shakes his head.
He was beautiful.
And Steve doesn’t know what to say to that.
And it's the dumbest thing, but he doesn’t need living brain cells to laugh, so his head's tipping back, and then his breath's a stutter in his throat, sharp bursts of air that huff in his cheeks and slip through his teeth.
He is empty space and inches to fill, and Tony Stark knows all of his corners.
-------------------------------
There are moments where the song of silence bubbles between them. Where the air is thick with a kind of heavy two men only know in the darkness. There are moments where the urge to bend, to shuffle, to ease right into something fragile, overwhelms him.
Steve swallows then, and suddenly the smile drops off his face, and Tony feels it again, that phantom ache, the urge to grab glue and tape and stick it back on there himself.
There’s still a smile on his face, but he shakes his head.
There is a hope in Steve's chest. There is a wish that rattles in his lungs. It catches and drags on Tony's hips, expands with each breath they share. Tony is an endless sky, big and dark and beautiful, a prayer for the stars.
And Tony smiles, soft and warm and melting in the day, the kind of thing that wobbles from the weight of it, shivers in the middle from the force of it all.
Steve didn’t have to even think about it to answer that question. “Yes.”
“Probably not,” Tony agreed. “But there’s a big box in the middle of the MIT campus, and the fact that you knew what it was...she, sorry… It’s like you know more than you’re telling me. And also, you’ve made me believe in something I didn’t believe in before.”
The tiny creature hunkered down in Steve’s palm, barely peeking out from over his fingers, using the palm of his hand as a safe haven from the outside world.
“That’s it, sweetheart. Let me in,” Tony crooned. “Look at me.”
bigger than Tony, and when he was expecting it, it was like shoving a shoulder against a brick wall. “It’s always on my dime even though you’re the rich one.”
“I don’t expect you to. You were very drunk at that time.”
You even *make* donuts for Stark?
“Not doing anything,” Tony denied. Never mind the fact that the Doctor had caught him trying to break into the TARDIS red-handed. Again.
He's drooling into the pillow when the tip of Steve's cock presses between his asscheeks. He's mindless with need and want, and he despises himself for it. With every drag of Steve's cock against his balls and the base of his cock, he hates the way he needs that cock to split him open and turn him inside out.

“Be safe.”
If his wings were freed like all the other children who crowded around him and teased him, he would have wrapped himself in his wings and let the sounds drown out. However, as it was with his wings strapped tightly to his back, he felt naked and exposed, barrelled by the hurtful words.

To be honest, he really shouldn’t. Steve should say no, get off the elevator, hide in his room, because he...he was bad omen. He shouldn’t be feeding his desire of Tony because he knew that if he got too close, people around him would burn.
The slide of Steve’s cock was wet and lewd, messy and uncoordinated, but it felt so good. Tony wanted this and more, forever, accepting whatever Steve would give him, possessive holds of his chest and his cock, stroking firmly with the pre-come that continued to leak out of his cock, ducking even further under to hold his balls and massage it, all the while Steve sped up his pace and fucked his ass, sounds of slick and lube filling the otherwise silent room.
The thought of Vision hit him. With the knowledge that Thanos had taken all the stones, it was inevitable that Vision was dead or severely disabled – the Mind Stone had created him.  His heart constricted – yet another one was gone.
“In time.” Steve dragged his hands up and fingered Tony’s nipples, “I’m admiring you and your body. It’s so attentive. Look at you, so beautiful and half-way out of your mind, wanting to please me.”
“You’re right.” Steve sat there silently for one more moment, contemplating silently, before deciding to change the subject. “Have you heard anything more about Europe?”
Tony doesn't answer because Steve knows that Tony knows.  He isn't expected to answer; Steve doesn't want an answer anyway. So Tony just lays there, dozing in the warmth of Steve's heat, letting Steve take what he wants.
Yinsen looked at him. “It’s not complete!”
Tony stared at the TARDIS, considering it. “You’re...real,” he mused. “But you’re a thing. It can’t be possible that you can be sentient. I shouldn’t be asking a thing permission to enter.”
“Couldn’t sleep?” he asked.
There weren’t any visible cues as to what HYDRA was working on. Then, the sound of a muffled shifting broke through the white noise, and Steve turned, shield lifted. There was no one behind him, but Steve was sure that he wasn’t the only living being in the room. A
There was a bottle of bleach sitting on the sink countertop. With shaking fingers, he uncapped the lid. The smell was potent, almost overwhelming, but now, he didn’t care. He couldn’t take it anymore, all the hatred and all the teasing, all the pitying looks on all the adult faces, as if they could see his wings through the brace.

MY FUCKING EYES.
Steve felt like he left his stomach back on the ledge. His heart was pounding hard, feeling as it was beating out of his chest, and he instinctively retracted his wings closer to himself.
“That’s a no, Butterfingers!” Tony shouted, running to his lab. Butterfingers tended to get too eager in destroying things. “What did I tell you about unsupervised extermination!”
“Yeah, yeah, laugh it up,” Tony grumbled, stomping past him and ignoring the giggles that followed behind him. The hallway lights flickered ominously as then left the building.
If Steve thought that being teased for his translucent wings not molting when he came of age, he found that being teased for becoming wingless was worse.
“This is why you’re my best friend,” Tony declared, slumping over the coffee station…where there was no pot. “Aaaand I take that back.” He
“Yeah, baby,” Tony groaned back, pressing into his cock even harder, and Steve threw his head back and and mewled. “Come on. Come for me.”
that guy over there looks familiar. Wait. That was my date.
Tig: And here's to another chapter after a long hiatus. Anoo says hi, I say hi. Kait and Neb also says hi, and they are the amazing collaborators to make this chapter come to fruition! Thank you for those from a loooooong time ago suggested some prompts, we have taken some of them for this chapter!
“I think you adapted pretty well, given your circumstances over the last ten years, considering that you’ve been revived for ten years.” Natasha sat down at the edge of the ring as Steve continued to clean the floor. “Tony really helped you catch up to the present, and Sam was as well. Considering that none of this existed in your time –“ here she waved her hand in a vague motion, you learned quickly. I think it’s easy to forget that you’re not from this time.”
That time, he couldn’t stop the painful moan he let slip out of his mouth. He hunched over, staggering a few steps and bracing himself against the wall, moving ever so slowly towards the bathroom. He bit his lip slightly too hard; he tasted blood in his mouth as he forced himself to move.
because she wrote 3 sentences of animal au, and I took it to mean squirrel!Tony.
Steve gave them his best disappointed Captain America look. He was
Would be a better night if you dropped to your knees right now, but we can’t always get what we want, Tony thought viciously. He said instead, “Pep says we’re up 10% over last year and the night isn’t over.”
Steve looked at her, then looked down at the sketch he made. A reaper, complete with a hooded cape and a scythe, black wings outstretched and foreboding. He was that reaper. “Sure Peggy,” he said hollowly.

“He still needs to come back, I’m not gonna teach
Steve sighed. “If…there was a way to turn back time, I wouldn’t have left you like that. I would have been honest about everything, and I should have trusted you.”
“Hardy, har, har,” Tony said sardonically and stretched himself off of Steve. He padded away from the bed and returned several minutes later with two steaming mugs of his lifeblood.
Rhodey glanced at Stevens for a moment before he said, “he couldn’t hurt a fly with that face.”
“He never mentioned it.”
HOW DARE.
“I know it’s pitiful, but I’m still sorry.” Steve sighed, and he looked away for a moment, over Tony’s shoulder. Obviously, there’s nothing there, but he can’t bear to look at Tony else he get cold feet and forget to say what he needed to get off his chest. “You mean so much to me, and I realize that now. You’ve definitely been there for me when I needed you, and I’m sorry that I wasn’t when you needed me. You were right: you’re my friend too.”
As if he heard him, Tony began to turn around, his immaculate goatee perfectly trimmed on his face and his wide brown eyes gazing back at him. His eyes told of inexplicable hurt, and God, it never fails to agonize his heart looking at him like that. Steve’s chest filled with guilt. Those eyes were frightened of him.
Doesn’t know what he’s missing
was the anomaly here. He really messed up, and now Bucky was gone, and Tony was nowhere on Earth. “He loved me,” he said quietly.
“Hey, you’re back late,” Rhodey remarked, coming out of the bathroom with a towel around his neck. “How was lab?”
He stepped out into the cold air of the apartment, which already had begun to leech away at the little bit of warmth he’d acquired, and as he tossed on an oversized shirt, he glanced up at the mirror. He froze in shock.
“Probably a good sign,” Tony muttered.

No. He shouldn’t go there. He wasn’t his, after all.
He couldn’t shove the stack of papers into his bag fast enough before he was darting out of the classroom to see if the TARDIS was still there.
“Electromagnets,” Tony replied. “They’re usually pretty durable, but it’s not easy trying to find something that is fight-durable.”
Clint staggered, face twisting into mock horror and hands clutching his heart as if he’s been shot. Everyone laughed at his antics. “Shots fired, shots fired!” Clint bemoaned before he straightened up and told Steve seriously, “I expect more flying stunts next time we’re avenging.”
Thanks to vicspeaks for betaing this chapter!
I’ll DM you our secret entrance...Mr. Stark is currently having problems in the kitchen
That admission should have made him panic, but Tony was too exhausted to do anything but just stare at the man in shock, not even bothering to move his hand away. But he wasn’t wrong about that fact that the touch calmed him. Even though the touch felt
“Bumble?”
Tony gave him a cheeky grin. “Relax, Cap, it’s just us. Everyone else has been captured. Well, us and…aren’t you cute?” Tony crouched down to plant his face next to the glass cage. Tiny Steve was pressed against the furthest edge of his glass prison, switching his gaze between Tony and Steve.

“I can’t shift,” he bemoaned. It was as if he was missing a part of himself with the fact that he couldn’t tap into his wolf side, and that was a horrifying thought. He was so much more vulnerable as a human, and that made the situation a whole lot scarier.
“Wake up, we’ve got work to do,” Tony said. He clapped his hands twice.
“I won’t let you fall either,” Steve said, flapping his wings powerfully to keep them afloat. “Are you okay, Iron Man?”
It was enough motivation to propel him out of bed. He had a new mission to do, thanks to Tony; not everything felt hopeless after all.
I question whether he even knows what a recipe book is.
Because you know I’m one of the only few who can keep up with you and your antics.
“Uh huh. So the man with the sad beard isn’t the one you’re staring at and blushing over.”
“Well, that’s a charming fiction,” Tony smiled slightly as he collapsed into the co-captain seat clad in his under suit. Steve’s eyes flickered over Tony and returned to the skyline before Tony could think anything of it.
how about no - that’s not a proper date
“Steve, I’m home!” Sarah called out into the apartment when she walked through the door.
He needed Bruce’s knowledge to finish this.
You could have a little more faith in me, I’m a certified genius!
he chanted in his head. The man who broke all of his barriers. This kiss was better than their first one, all promise and passion and love, and Steve was dying for this. “It’s okay to be scared,” Tony said. “Being scared is healthy. But being scared and not doing anything is bad.”
“They can’t even be creative with their cloning experiments?” Clint groaned when Steve and Tony approached the Quinjet. Tiny Steve was looking around with wide eyes, awed and stunned by everything he saw. His tiny hands gripped the edge of Cap’s glove, staring at the fascinating new world he was in. “How did they even get your DNA anyway?”
he begged, although he didn’t know what he was begging for.

When Tony didn’t immediately do so, Steve looked up. Tony was smirking. “What?” Steve asked defensively.
Sometimes, he dreamt about Steve walking away from him, holding an unconscious Bucky by his side. Every step away from Tony felt final, and whatever bonds of fate they had between the two tugged painfully at his heart with every inch further away, and it felt as if it was going to snap in half.
He wasn’t wrong either, except Tony was
All of those thoughts fell to the wayside when they were fighting their latest enemy.
Bucky lied - the girls in their class were all taken with him, chatting him up and brushing their fingers into those soft blue feathers in hopes that Bucky would pay attention to him. Even the guys were taken with him because he was one of them.
Steve blushed slightly and continued, “She felt we all just did whatever you told us to do and none of us had any, what’s the word Pepper uses? Agency. None of us had any agency. And I tried to defend you, because that’s not true at all. If anything you’re annoying with how much you make sure we like things or are okay with things and then she accused me of being gay, which I’m not, I’m listed as ‘bi’ because that’s what Bucky said we call it now, but even if I was, why is that a problem? And I think I’ve been clear about how I don’t like bullies.”

Doctor Erskine changed the “4F” to “1A.” Steve breathed a sigh of relief because perhaps now he could make a small impact in the war. He may be a foot soldier, but no one was going to miss him.
“Never.” That was a new piece of information – Tony didn’t know that Stevens was a Captain, but the more he observed, the more he could see the set of his shoulders that suggested that the man was familiar with the military. He stared at the man, standing stock-still, observing and memorizing, and then Stevens looked up, brushed his hair back with his fingers. He grinned when he saw him.
“On the contrary, I believe first place is mine,” Natasha said just as her character reached the finish line.
If it’s supposed to be baked at 350 degrees for 30 minutes, I could bake it at 3500 degrees for three minutes?
“A couple more hours won’t hurt him,” Rhodey said. “When was the last time you ate anyway?”
He’s not here to tell him he’s sorry. His body filled with rage, and then regret for not realizing what he had done earlier. Now, Tony was only just a memory. A dream.
The stars must be aligning again. Every attempt of dining out I see my date not six feet away from me. It is like the moon is blessing us to be together.
Back at the Compound, Bruce placed the communicator between two clips. “It’s Fury’s alright,” he said, typing rapidly on his keyboard. “I’m running tests on it right now, but it’s a long-distance communicator, possibly off-world. Whatever signal this is going to, it may take a while.”
still a date! 😉
“I regret it,” Steve said, “I regret it so much.”
Yinsen said, “He wants to know where—”
Tony’s back were marred with old scars, indented slightly from the healing process. But where Steve expected wing muscles protruding out from his back, or at least a scar of it, there was nothing.
Tony gathered his coat, leaving Rhodey in his seat contentedly finishing his plate of food. “Don’t break him,” Rhodey warned.
“No.” Steve was horrified, and he shook his head in denial. Any thought otherwise would mean something worse – he had ruined his friendship that day, and he couldn’t bear to hear this news because it meant so much more.. “There’s no way he could have loved me.”
“I know Quill is very particular about people tampering with his ship. He nearly killed Rocket after he took off with one of the chairs.”
That really doesn’t help your case, Tony.
“Wait,” Rhodey tried to interrupt but Tony had an agenda.
“So, why are you thinking about it now?”
The press of Steve’s lips against his were like fire, roaring hot and burning him, every inch of it, and the fireworks sparked behind his eyes. It was too much and not enough as Tony scrambled his fingers against Steve’s tux, trying to find purchase as Steve licked his way into his mouth like a dying man.
“You’re...Captain America,” he whispered in awe, forgetting his fears for a second.
“Fuck, fuck, fuck, FUCK,” he said out loud. “FUCK.” He ran through all the options in his head and finally settled on being an adult, or at least attempting to act like one. He sighed deeply and hit the screen to dial Steve’s number, which thankfully went to voicemail.
Steve nodded, an unhappy look in his eyes. “I had the same dream. And I’m sorry, I wasn’t there for you when you needed me.”
“Steve, actually, nice to meet you.”
Tony looked at the man, then shifted his gaze to consider the TARDIS. The thing was, he did feel a buzz, just like last time. There was a gentle nudge in the back of his mind, like a feeling of realness from the TARDIS when he touched it. But still, he didn’t believe in magic though. The evidence might all have been there, but being so deeply rooted in real sciences, it was hard to wrap around the thoughts of mysticism.
“So—” Steve started at the same time Tony said, “Well—”

“It was one of those blubber ones?”
He hated the Stones with a passion, and no amount of looking at it would diminish that utter despise of them.
But it was the best lead he had so far in possibly figuring out this thing. He just...didn’t quite believe it though, not now at least, not when he was so focused on figuring it out just by using all the science he knew.
“You like him,” Clint said.
“Move closer to me,” Steve says out of the blue.
“Okay, what?”
Tony noses at his fur, but the fur stays stuck up stubbornly. He huffs, turning away. “It was windy while I was out foraging.”

When all was said and done, most of the feathers that were on his back were now on the floor, a mix of black and white that littered the bathroom tile, and he stared at his broken wings.
His fears of his wings were assuaged with the fact that Natasha gave her seal of approval, but he was still relieved that the rest of the team didn’t blink an eye when they saw his wings freed and hanging behind him.

Steve never liked him that way, in the way that the image implied, that was for sure; his mind must be performing tricks on him. It was…incongruent to the letter Steve had written two years ago. Tony had it memorized by now after rereading it so many times that the words became meaningless.  Steve
Steve’s fist was stopped short, stilled by an invisible force that stood between the two men.
So with all the evidence that pointed to the fact that the police box came out of nowhere, Tony was curious.
“I hate you, Virginia,” Tony muttered and signaled to a waiter to replenish his drink.
He just wanted to be back on solid ground and see Rhodey and Pepper, perhaps take comfort in their arms. God, he would even take Steve. Now more than ever, he hoped that Steve had forgiven him. He just wanted to look at Steve and say, “I’m sorry,” bury his face in his strong chest, and grieve for Peter. Now more than ever, he missed his friend, and his heart constricted at the thought of the loss of both his closest friend and the kid. He didn’t want to face yet another day realizing that he had just lost everything, and he was alone. “And if we don’t go to the outpost?” he asked her.
He regretted it, not kissing Tony. He had a chance to; he wanted to! But it wasn’t fair for his Tony if he were to kiss this younger Tony now, even if they were the same person in different time periods.
Museum
Those words sounded hollow. Steve saw the mask of disgust that flitted across his face. Steve collected the feather and turned away.
Mostly, the pain in his fist felt good, and for the first time since he got his wings, his chest eased. Granted, the ache never really went away, but Steve felt like he could breathe now.
Perhaps, however, had he made full use of his wings, he could have saved Bucky from falling to his death. Because during the time Bucky was captured, they tore his wings so that they were unusable, his formerly beautiful wings missing patches of feathers and rendering him flightless. It didn’t stop Bucky from running with Steve.
Steve shook his head. “He was in a cage. No water.”
Tony put his finger to his lips. “If you’re going to say bad things about your wings again, I don’t want to hear it. You’re not ugly, you’re not a killer. You’re a protector, and you deserve to use your wings.”
“I’m sorry,” was the first thing that came out of his mouth when he saw him next.
“Right. The chameleon circuits. The Doctor mentioned that,” Tony said. Now the man mentioned the same thing “But it can’t be chameleon circuits if I can see it.”
Steve nodded helplessly. Tony grinned. “Thanks Steve.”
The other guy’s politely asking him questions, but he’s gotten no questions about himself.
I listened! You said your mom was a total cow!
“It’s not your fault,” Sarah said gently before she coughed, chest heaving and blood dribbling out her mouth. Steve grabbed the towel off the bedside table and wiped her mouth carefully.
For more than the fact that he recognized one Captain America in his uniform, there was something even more, for better or for worse: Captain America was his mate.
“No,” Tony breathed, finally looking up. Because even though he was an omega, he would
“Yeah. In the snow.” He grimaced. “Gotta go, but I made breakfast for you. Eat it.”
alone. In the end, it was Tony who was alone instead, betrayed, left behind, trying to fix the broken pieces. Tony was skeptical of whatever game Steve was playing at.
Tony was extraordinarily glad for Yinsen’s steady fingers. He would have fucked the arc reactor up, and they didn’t have any room for mistakes. Tony looked down at his own shaking fingers. He hated the way his body betrayed him so, unable to do the fine motor control most of his work needed. He couldn’t fix this part of himself though, not when he was completely away from civilization and stuck with a lone Beta werewolf.

There was a fragile flame of hope; Tony couldn’t think of that - he couldn’t think of him when Stevens moved away like a ghost in the wind.
Steve walked away, the cadence of his footsteps carrying him away from Tony because he will do what Tony has requested. Tony deserved that and more.
Tony smirked, deliberately facing away from the Doctor so that he wouldn’t see it.
“Clint,” he said, opening his eyes. He grinned. “They smell so delicious.”
Drink nine quickly followed the photo op, with ten, eleven, and twelve in alarming succession after that. He lost his footing a little as he finished twelve and decided to call it a night. He quietly slipped out through the kitchen of the Plaza and into the safety of Happy’s waiting car. He fired off a quick text to Pepper to let her know he was heading home and then his fingers acted on their own accord as he opened up the thread he had with Steve.
“I’d love to,” Steve interrupted desperately. He, for the longest time, wanted to touch those feathers. He’d admired them from afar, drew Tony’s wings obsessively into his sketchbook, but he never got the chance to look at them up close. And he wanted to, so badly.
Yinsen looked at him. “They’re going to get what they want at any cost,” he said.
He set our hearts and buildings ablaze while he was here.
“And they bring light.” Tony’s look was intense when he stared at Steve, bringing the feather to his lips and then placing it in Steve’s hand. He closed Steve’s palm and held it gently between his own palms. “You’re not ugly, Steve. Your wings aren’t ugly at all. If that feather tells me anything, your wings are beautiful.”
The spaceship in front of them was standing there in all its glory, perfect and untouched by the fight. Tony hated it, and it felt silly to have a grudge against an inanimate object. However, it just felt like a sin to see the ship marked
Tony’s breath caught. “You don’t think…” he couldn’t finish the sentence. Finishing the sentence would be too horrifying to think about.
he whispered under his breath.
Tony nodded, and he lifted his gauntleted arm up to stroke Steve’s face. “You caught me,” Tony said, grinning. “You did a good job.”
Tony’s smile was brilliant. “Looking forward to seeing you more often, Steve.” The way Tony said “Steve” was sultry, and his eyes darkened. They stared at each other for a long moment, just a beat longer than appropriate.
“Let’s go home,” Steve said, squeezing Tony’s hand.
Tony shoved him against the wall with his shoulder. Rhodey was a horrible friend. “That’s bullshit. I hate their dumb faces – they don’t pay attention in class, and they always fail my exams. They don’t even deserve to be in MIT. Dumb, the entire lot of them.”
“Tony,” Tony replied. “Tony Stark.”
“Oh my god, it’s you again,” Tony groaned, closing his eyes and tilting his head up in a mock approximation of supplication. He didn’t want to deal with
However, during the rare events that he did appear, Tony would automatically seek out Steve, looking around the room until his eyes fell upon Steve’s own eyes looking back at him. And then Tony would give him a soft grin, a genuine one, not the dazzling media one, and Steve’s chest would expand, his face would heat, and he would look down shyly because those eyes were mesmerizing and shining.
“I found the lab,” Steve said. “Sending you the location now, Iron Man.”
He could be flightless, and he could be a hero. No one had to know that his wings were cursed.
Please.

“Of course.”
Yinsen dutifully repeated it, and the Alpha’s eyes flashed red. He snarled; Tony snarled back.
Tiny Steve whimpered under his breath, almost too soft for anyone else but a supersoldier to hear it. Steve smirked, watching as Tiny Steve stood there, head turned forward, frozen, wide-eyed, looking up at the mini octopus Tony, cheeks red and mouth open.
some of you asked for.
Dum-E is on fire extinguisher duty, he’s all I need.
That was NOT the deal.
“You will.” Bucky sounded so much more confident than how he felt. “If you have that mark, you’ll find them.”
dreams now? What had changed? Tony quickly determined that the most plausible explanation was the side effect of the snap – somehow, the nature of his dreams (or nightmares) changed, although Tony couldn’t prove this at all. Maybe magic, but he didn’t really believe in magic. But for the life of him, he couldn’t figure out what had changed.
Natasha gave Steve’s wings barely a passing glance. “Congratulations,” Natasha said instead. “And for your information, Cap, we don’t believe in superstition either. Your wings are beautiful. You don’t need to hide it from us.”
They fell into an easy silence, forks clinking softly against the ceramic plates, and it felt comfortable just sitting there with Stevens. It was so easy to to push all of his tasks to the back of his mind: no projects, no thesis, no class.
It had to be him.
“Okay.”
She replied, “We will be adrift in space until we reach our destination, and it would take longer to get to Earth than if we were to get to the outpost first.”
those hacks for the past few years - even though he was no longer an undergraduate student but a graduate on his third degree.
TMI dude. But I agree with the donuts part.
Steve deliberately stayed flightless, shoving his wings back into the confines of a new back brace. He couldn’t deal with the guilt of anyone seeing his wings and dying because of them.

Steve stared.
Oh god, he’s talking about how his fear of having children stems from his daddy issues. IT’S THE FIRST DATE FOR GOD’S SAKE.
, he didn’t say. Perhaps Steve knew anyway.
"No, Steve, stop," he says weakly.
Tony nodded. Yinsen pushed him gently towards the armor. “You won’t be able to move until the systems come online. Even your werewolf strength wouldn’t be able to carry this.”
Thankfully Tony handed over the water and bar without further fuss, tipping a little bit of water into the lid and breaking the bar down into crumbs before putting the pieces in Steve’s palm. Tiny Steve munched on the food happily, oozing utter satisfaction for the rest of the ride home.
Blue eyes, fair flaxen hair, tiny hands pressed up against the glass cage the creature was in, steaming the wall with its…his heated palms.
Do y’all remember the terrible first coffee hottie? I scored a date with him!
“I don’t know why I’m friends with you,” Tony said. “Who even refers to themselves in third person?”
No one would miss a flightless, cursed, winged human.
Then Tony began to shed his shirt. The transition was so abrupt that it left Steve speechless.
And then Tony stepped off the ledge, pulling Steve with him.
And if he tried to start a relationship, it was guaranteed that he would essentially send Tony to his grave.
Tony curled his hands up to Steve’s head, tangling his fingers in his hair, and then he pulled him forward so that their foreheads pressed against each other’s. “I love you too,” he whispered. “We’ll fix this, all of this, together.”
“Okay.” Tony was tired. He didn’t want to do it, especially not with the rest of his team.
It was an instinctive thing when Tony curled his right hand into a fist, and Steve’s face fell when he saw the movement. “Do it,” he whispered, and Tony could see in his eyes that he was quietly accepting his fate. He wasn’t going to turn his back; he wasn’t going to fight either. “I deserve it.”
"So you love me? All those...all those fuck arounds were just that?"
“Yeah, like a time traveller.”
“You’re making Cap uncomfortable,” Nat said, dragging Clint back and trapping him to do a noogie.
I’ve only accepted it to get the other guy off my back.
“It shattered when we thawed you. We’ll get you a new one, although I don’t understand why you’d put away a set of perfectly good wings.”
“Please,” Tony begged. “
Exactly two years after his wings were supposed to change, ten-year-old Steve Rogers felt a slight burning sensation emananting in his flight muscles and radiating down his spine. While the ache in his back felt more painful than normal, the thought of his Ma coming home early from work to celebrate his birthday lifted his spirits, and he did his best to ignore the wave of pain that blossomed.

He's drowning, letting the waves flood over his head, and he’s just a broken, used tool for Steve to use. Steve comes first, his cock twitching inside of him, and then he lets go of Tony's throat, dropping him carelessly. With a much needed gasp, he comes, hole fluttering around Steve's cock, falling back onto the bed because he can't hold himself up. Steve fucks him through the aftershocks, and then he stays there, cock penetrating Tony's ass, as he pulls him into his arms and holds him.
They sat there in silence, finishing up their lunches.
As you have started 10 fires this month, you have earned 1 trip to the FDNY’s 15th annual firefighter ball.
“Thanos did what he said he would do: he wiped out half of all living creatures,” Natasha exhaled. She was sallow and looked just as defeated as Steve felt, which was a testament to the loss of control they all had, if emotions were showing on their faces.
Tony swallowed, throat dry. “How long was I working?” he rasped. He stood up and nearly fell as dizziness swept over him and he closed his eyes, waiting for his equilibrium to come back. Food and water…that may be a good idea.
“It’s not!” Clint retorts, chasing after Bucky. “Nat tossed a rock at me with extreme prejudice!”

“I’m home!” Tony called out, tossing his scarf and coat over the couch. He was utterly chilled to the bone, grumpy and tired and hungry, and he still had so much to do before he could sleep.  He already regretted stopping to talk to the crazy man because it cut into his valuable and precious time.
real, and Tony was truly facing him on the other side. It certainly felt that way; the wall between them felt tangible, and the cutting remarks that Tony said to Steve were nothing that he had imagined.
They looked at him again, but before they could say anything else, Tony walked into the room again. Steve was relieved.
his family, missed the camaraderie of teammates, working together for a common cause. And he missed Tony. All he could conjure up for the longest time was the anger and the hatred that spread across his teammate’s face, not this open love and care that was shown on this page.
Tony bit his lip. “What do you propose we do?”
The elevator doors opened, and “Back in Black” greeted him as he walked through the doors. Tony was...messy with grease, his hair was matted, and his goggles on his face were askew. Tony’s wings hung limply on his back as he sawed something, sending sparks flying everywhere.
But more often than not, he drew the wings of people that passed him. He sighed, closing his eyes.
Nebula was quiet for a moment, and her face flittered with fleeting expressions as she calculated it. Finally, she said, “Three weeks perhaps, maybe more. It would take us five days to reach the outpost, and then a little more than two weeks if all the wormholes are in working order.”
Steve shook his head in denial. “No, that’s…no. Not true. I care about the present as well – I
He didn’t do this often, allow Butterfingers to destroy everything to his heart’s desire, but it was also a special day. Tony hoped it was a date, too. Still, with all the scraps he had from failed projects, he could treat both his bot and Stevens to this special thing.
Rogers.”
Ugh, the way they’re staring at each other is disgusting
Do it you coward
Steve whined at the mentioned at his wings, and he unconsciously tucked them back under him, hiding his face in his hands, but Tony crawled over him and commanded, “Stop.”
Nat nodded, and Steve pressed a comforting hand upon her shoulder.
“Well, I’d really love it if we could get our hands on those beepy things from
With a sudden cry, Steve hurled the phone away. A second later, from the darkness, the sound of crunching was heard, followed by the softer muffled sounds of the pieces from the phone falling towards the ground.
Steve’s entire visage brightened and Tony’s heart skipped a beat, like it always did when Steve smiled with his whole self. “You said you hated audiobooks.”
Tony loathes the way he keeps coming back to want this, a cruel penance for all the sins he has.

Tony stood by one of the on-board holoscreens and flicked rapidly through massive amounts of data on the screen. “I don’t think HYDRA tested that far yet. Files here state that he was engendered twelve hours ago.”
Every time he awoke with any amount of lucidity, it was pain and hell, blurry eyes and a raging storm. Tony wanted to give up, but something stopped him from doing so. Death didn’t want him yet, and all he could do was breathe through the unbearable pain in his chest.
“Electrocution.”
What the hell is Cow boy doing here???
“Sorry,” Steve repeated anyway, catching his shield midair. “I’m just tired of HYDRA.”
Stevens laughed. “It’s not a problem.” And as if he needed another way for Tony to like him more, Stevens turned to DUM-E and said, “Hello DUM-E. It’s very nice to meet you.”
Ugh, this is taking forever, I wonder if there is a way to up the temperature and decrease the time.
…Tony thought absently, wracking his mind and sifting old information. He had done research on the Mind Stone thanks to Vision and his patience with Tony’s eagerness to do tests on the Stone. It’s been several years already since the initial research, and much of the knowledge he had acquired during that time had been overwritten by newer knowledge and research. Still, if he could just figure out the wavelength of the Mind Stone, he would be able to find Thanos.
“Here,” Tony said, placing the metal feathers into Steve’s palms. They were much lighter than Steve expected, and they glistened in his palm as they caught the lights of Tony’s workshop.
Steve ducked his head in embarrassment. “Sorry,” he muttered.
“I love you,” Steve bursted out behind him. Tony stilled, heart pounding hard. Steve sounded breathless, desperate.
tmi, get a room
“Shrapnel to the chest, poisoned with wolfsbane,” he answered. “The Ten Rings told me to patch you up and didn’t give me any tools. I had to make do with what I had. You didn’t heal properly, and I don’t think you
Tony was grateful that caving in to the Ten Rings demands meant that he had more freedom to work on his armor under the guise of building the Jericho, and Yinsen’s hands helped tremendously. Having Yinsen there helped him focus too, because if he didn’t want to save himself, Yinsen deserved saving, and that was enough for him to continue melting the metal in the furnace and shaping it to his size.
“Yeah, yeah,” Tony said flatly, and Steve had to hide a smile. “Just stop this. I wanna go home because I had plans before I was

Butterfingers moped, his whisk wilting.
Through the open eye pieces, Tony watched as Yinsen moved around, scrambling to fit him into the armor. He breathed, trying to keep his anxiety at bay. He hated this, this stillness; it was against his very nature of freedom to move easily. This was unwieldy and slow. But he wasn’t a wolf, not anymore, not when the wolfsbane remained coursing through his body. He was a human, and a subpar one at that.
I did NOT need to know that about Steve’s sex life.
“I make your life interesting, Tony. And someone has to look out for you because you can’t take care of yourself.” He grinned brightly, ignoring Tony’s “Not true, Rhodey. I can take care of myself.” “James Rhodes.”
“You’re just jealous because no one wears Captain America underwear.”
Steve pressed his hips up to him, feeling Tony’s body tense from his thoughts and Tony felt the anger start to bubble over, he tugged on Steve’s hair again and Steve responded by grabbing him in the ribs and pushing him off of him sideways. Tony staggered back and down a step to where he landed with a thump on the sofa. This was more like it. The last time Steve had gotten rough there had been consequences beyond his control, not this time.
“I have no doubt Lang has an entire Avengers wardrobe set so that isn’t really points in your favour.” Tony sniffed contemptuously. “As for Falcon your bromance is adorable.”
‘Call you if I need you, call YOU, YOU BASTARD!” Tony punched the large glass window and yelped. “Son of a bitch! YOU’RE NOT EVEN HERE AND YOU’RE PISSING ME OFF!” He screamed at the window.
Steve dropped his head back to Tony’s chin, his sweaty hair brushing Tony’s cheek. Tony closed his eyes and circled his hips, slowly, teasingly, spinning the heavier man around on himself and causing Steve to grit his teeth and grab at the sofa. He took his other hand off of Tony’s shoulder and traced down around Tony’s chest, around the arc reactor where the skin was ridiculously more sensitive than the rest of his chest, which was so weird as the scar tissue should have practically deadened the area to touch. He reached Tony’s nipple and twirled a finger around it, stroking it, kneading his pectoral muscle with his hand and then brushing his fingers down Tony’s ribs. Tony switching the direction of his grinding hips and Steve gasped once more.
“I know that you’re talking but literally every time you open your mouth all that comes out is the national anthem.”
“Better make it worth my while then pretty boy.” Tony dragged his fingernails once more down Steve’s ribs and he was pleased to see red welts slowly rising from Steve’s tanned skin.
Steve glowered at Tony but there was humour in it, Tony could see it at the edges of his smile.
“Oh I’m revved up Stark; it’s you who seems to be struggling.”
“You may not have knelt for Loki, but I reckon you should for me.
“You’re already halfway there Iron Man, are you as hard as people think?”
“Jealous? Of your arrogant, obsessive, compulsive, whimsical, conceited idiotic self getting their kicks someplace when you know you’re desperate for it elsewhere?” Steve grit his teeth, he was obviously trying to keep his voice steady, Tony narrowed his eyes devilishly. So many buttons, which to press first?
You think I haven't heard the same tone used about you?"
“You absolute pervert Stark!” Steve leaned down and grabbed Tony round the waist, flinging him over his shoulder into a fire mans carry, ignoring Tony’s protests.
“A while.” Steve gasped back as Tony rocked their members together.
“You can begin by getting on your knees if you’d like.” Tony lifted one eyebrow and let the grin out, he raised both his eyebrows at Steve and let him follow his eyes downwards.
Tony allowed his grin to stay plastered to his face as he listened to Steve rave and swear as Tony pounded into his ass like it was an enemy, every slap of flesh on flesh fuelling his lust.
“Don’t get shy on me now Cap, I’ll pull those videos up again.” He beamed down at Steve, loving the way he looked on his knees.
He let go of Steve for a moment, reaching over him, running his body across Steve’s chest until his ass was practically in Steve’s face.
He pushed the pants down slowly, a grin spreading across his face as he revealed Iron Man briefs in stark contrast to his Gucci suit. Steve barked a laugh and leaned over onto one arm.
“You look great in cinema scope babe, look at your ass!”
He backed off of Steve, pulling his boxers off and leaning over the other man, who pushed his lips to Tony’s chest, placing a kiss on his thrumming arc reactor as he rummaged in a drawer next to the sofa. He pulled out a small red bottle and two little packets.
He removed the ice cube, then lifted it to Steve’s lips, delighting in the melting water running down his fingers and splashing onto Steve’s ripped chest. Steve looked at it for a moment, then opened his mouth and let Tony place it on his tongue. Steve sucked on the ice cube obligingly and Tony flung an arm behind his head and dropped onto it, groaning at the sight and closing his eyes. He heard Steve crunch down and knocked back the rest of the scotch, dropping it to the floor and letting it roll across the laminate flooring.
He opened his eyes, picked up the phone again and sat back against the sofa, he wondered if Steve looked at the other phone like he was right now, wondered if it kept him awake at night. Wondered if he’d given up hoping by now.
Tony kneaded his knuckles into the tight muscles there, then stroked down Steve’s hard thighs and back up again, he worked his hands around to the sensitive inner thigh and dragged his nails up them wickedly and Steve moaned, his cock twitching over Tony’s hands. “Come on Steve, a little louder now babe.” He spanked Steve twice in quick succession and Steve really cried out then, pain and pleasure mingling in his voice.
. Tony had taken in a breath but couldn’t speak so Steve asked again.
He sat up, keeping Steve’s cheeks spread, and positioned his cock at Steve’s entrance, he rubbed the tip of his cock around Steve’s asshole and Steve pushed back onto it. He slapped Steve once more. “Ah ah, you be a good boy now.” Steve stifled a groan in the cushions in reply.
“You’re a… billionaire… buy another.” Steve panted between groans.
Steve rolled his eyes. “How could I forget?”
“And you’re all cowboy huh?” Steve sneered.
This time Tony stepped forwards, they were closer now, both standing by the seating area with nothing in between them anymore.
Steve bit Tony’s lip and let out a yes that tapered off as Tony’s hand made its way down to Steve’s pert ass. “I can’t promise I’ll be gentle, actually scratch that, I have no intention of being gentle with you Rogers.”
“What the fuck are you wearing?” Was all Tony could come out with when Steve walked into the suite, but this Steve was different. His walk was slow, tentative. It made Tony mad, how dare he be the hesitant one!
“I don’t think I will.” He slipped a thumb under the waistband of the boxers and ran it down the sharp hip bone.
Steve lifted his hand to hold Tony’s to his chest. “Neither do I Tony.”
“Oblivion.” Tony chirped.
“You said a bad word!” Tony cried and dropped his pants and kicked them off. “Christ Steve can you drop the pompous attitude for one minute.” He stepped up to Steve and loomed over him, enjoying being taller than him for once. Steve sat back and looked up at Tony once again with those fuck me eyes and even had the audacity to bite his goddamn lip. “So what is your deal Rogers? Men, women, both, have you had the hots for me for a while or is this a new thing for you?”
Tony jumped up from the sofa, causing Steve to crash onto the cushions. Undisguised mischief danced in Tony’s eyes and he strode over purposefully to the bar, Steve watched his ass shake to and fro as he walked away.
“Tony.” Steve gasped.
“And when will that be? All the time Barnes is alive you will never be able to relax.”
Steve took in a breath. “I want it, I can take it all.” He panted, eyeing Tony up once more.
”Langua-“ Tony dropped onto him, cutting off his ridiculous catch phrase with his lips and Steve fell back onto the table. It can’t have made for comfortable leaning but Tony didn’t exactly care. Steve hadn’t exactly made the last, however fucking long he honestly had not been counting at all, not once, nope, no clue how long…
“Ah! Please! Tony!” Steve cried out against Tony’s cheek. “Please Tony, fuck me into-“
“Please what? Hmm?” Tony bit his lip at smirked at the pleading tone Steve had adopted.
“So I found out.” Steve caught Tony’s bright eyes with his own.
He was not expecting it. Nope. Not a bit.
“Earth’s Mightiest Heroes…” He muttered to himself as he heard the penthouse elevator getting closer.
“I know no such thing Rogers, how did you even get here by the way as JARVIS detected no vehicles arriving or leaving the area surrounding Stark Tower?”
“Jealous Stark?”
“Really?
“As epic bromances go, I reckon Iron Man and Captain America is in the top 3.” Tony shrugged. “I mean we’ll never beat Sherlock and Watson but we actually exist somehow so there is that.”
“By anything you mean me fucking you over?”
“Are you ready to be broken?” Tony purred.
Steve downed the rest of his and leaned over Tony to place his glass gently on the floor. Tony grabbed Steve’s shoulders, causing him to drop the glass, which hit the floor with a clunk but stayed in one piece, how boring, and he pushed Steve back into the sofa and straddled him, he grinned and placed his hands on Steve’s chest.
Steve sucked in a breath; Tony could almost hear Steve’s heart hammering in his chest, mirroring his own.
“Oh, yes, yes it is!” Steve bit down on his arm and Tony saw it, he rifled around him, found the bottle of lube and coated his fingers with it, then slipped his fingers inside Steve once more. He put in four and Steve clenched around his hand so Tony slapped him hard. Steve bucked his hips but relented, allowing Tony to start working him.
“Ready for round two?”
“Doesn’t taste like strawberries anymore does it Rogers.”
“Come on Stevey baby, what gets you hot under the all American collar huh?” He traced one finger down Steve’s hip bones and Steve let out a sharp breath. “You know you want to tell me.”
“Don’t get romantic on me Tony. I thought this was ‘just a fuck’?”
God what an aggravating man!
“You heard it ladies and gents.” He let go of Steve’s throbbing cock and sat up, he grabbed Steve’s shoulders pulled his entire length out of Steve, ignoring the futile protests from the older man. He threw Steve into the couch and drew himself up to tower over Steve.
“Dirty blasphemer.” Tony cried back.
“That’s more like it.” Tony lifted himself off Steve using his knees and grabbed the suit once more, this time working it painstakingly slowly down the broader man’s hips, making sure to drag his fingernails down the sensitive skin of Steve’s waist. “There’s that perfect V. You know Rogers I’m slightly put out, I mean practically the entire world has seen me naked, I’ve seen Thor naked because the dude has an aversion to pants, I’ve seen Clint because that man has no shame, I’ve seen Banner because we’re science bros and that fucking Scott Lang will just change right in front of securing cameras and bare his ass to them. And I honestly have no idea if Vision even has anything down there but you, you’re a fucking prude and you have made me wait a long time for this.” He took his tongue between his teeth and pulled the suit over Roger’s perky fucking muscly butt and was honestly surprised Steve had space in that skin tight outfit for a pair of boxers. “Damn I almost expected tighty whiteys.” He pouted.
Steve’s cock bounced across Tony’s stomach with every thrust and Tony bucked his hips and grabbed one of Steve’s arms, unbalancing him he pulled the man down to him, he had one hand gripping Steve’s hip bone and one on his arm, as Steve fell closer to the younger man Tony retook Steve’s mouth as his other hand reached for Steve’s shaft. Now at a better angle Tony pushed himself into Steve as his hand pumped him, aiming for the bundle of nerves he knew would make Steve lose his shit. “How do you hide this beast in that skin tight suit of yours Rogers, are you a grower, not a shower?” He panted into Steve’s mouth as he felt beads of sweat rolling off him and splashing down his own cheeks.
Steve closed his mouth and Tony took the silence to continue his critical analysis of Steve Rogers’ body. His eyes worked their way hungrily over the v that dipped below the atrocious boxers, and across the perfect washboard stomach, up to the bulging, hairless pectoral muscles. That caused him to ponder if all of Steve was hairless, he’d soon find out. His eyes continued to rove up Steve’s solid shoulders and perfectly outlined collarbones, up the soft skin of his neck and onto the slightly (for once) stubbled jaw, the swollen lips, the straight, perfect nose and onto those ravenous blue eyes that were staring right back at him.
“Oh jesus Tony.”
before even realising he was already thinking about the next time. He laughed and Tony opened his eyes and looked up at Steve, one eyebrow raised. With his face flushed up his cheeks, his eyes steamy and sultry and his mouth working on Steve’s cock Steve knew he couldn’t hold it much longer. He thrust into Tony’s mouth and Tony’s hand slid up his leg and under his balls, until it reached Steve’s still slightly sore asshole. He pushed one still lubed finger inside and Steve clenched his jaw, a cry still managing to escape him. Now Tony worked on his cock with his mouth and his ass with his fingers, sliding in another finger to join the first, curling them into Steve, seeking that glorious nerve bundle. He found it and hit it hard and Steve erupted into Tony’s mouth, his hips jerking erratically, his hands digging into the sheets and his toes curling as he arched his back and thrust once more into Tony’s welcoming mouth. Tony took it all, closing his eyes and still working Steve’s ass as Steve rode out the climax into Tony’s mouth. He hit that little bundle of nerves once more and Steve came again, his hips bucking wildly and a cry tore from his lips as he threw his head back onto the bed. He’d never had a multiple orgasm before and the pleasure was so intense it was almost unbearable.
Somehow, during the shouting and the arguing they’d ended up standing in front of each other, maybe a couple of feet away, Steve had backed away during Tony’s rant and they were near to the elevator.
“I’m sorry, have you met Thor?”
He lay a hand on Tony’s bearded cheek and smiled. “I have more friends than just you you know. They brought me here and they’ll take me back after.”
“Oh god Stark! Stop it.” Steve cried out as Tony stretched his legs out under Steve, pushing his knees up and cradling his ass with his thighs.
“There we go, normally we can’t get you to shut up about patriotism and shit, don’t go quiet on me now baby, show me how much you want it.” Tony sat back on his haunches and stroked himself, watching as Steve caught his breath, taking in the sight of Captain America bent over an armrest in front of him, naked and flushed. If that wasn’t the sexiest thing he had seen in a long time…
He stood on one side of the steps to the sitting area and Tony stood on the other by the window. They were so close but it felt like there was thousands of miles between them, and a barrier so strong neither could break it alone.
Steve pulled his arm from Tony’s grip, breaking the kiss, and slammed it into the arm rest beside Tony’s face, now Steve was looming over Tony and no longer looking the picture of innocence. Now Steve was pure unadulterated sex. His pupils were blown, his face flushed, his breathing coming in ragged gasps and moans, his hair was all over the place, his mouth was open and his lips were swollen, he had never looked more gorgeous that Tony could remember. “I have my ways Stark.” He replied breathlessly.
A week ago...
Steve cried out and threw his head back and Tony leaned down, backtracking his earlier plan and grabbed Steve’s ready to erupt shaft, ripping the condom off, he wanted to feel the hot cum on his skin. He started to pump Steve in time with his thrusts, causing Steve to keep clenching his ass around Tony’s pulsing cock, and then his whole body clamped down on Tony’s cock as he came, cum spurting out across the sofa and Steve’s arms, gushing down Tony’s hand as he screamed Tony’s name over and over.
The inner turmoil was giving Tony a headache. Did he really choose Bucky, or did Tony give him no choice, did Tony take away that choice. Did Tony push him into Bucky and make it obvious that there was no way Steve could make this right again.
“Oh this is nothing, Friday, wake up daddy’s here.”
“Excuse me?” Tony stopped his pacing and gave Steve and incredulous look.
“Uh huh…” Steve tore his eyes away and looked around the rest of the room, it was one big projection screen, on the wall behind the pond it showed a moving jungle, behind Steve it showed Miami Beach, to Steve’s right it showed…
Steve clenched his jaw and Tony could almost hear the internal struggle Steve was having. Pride always comes before a fall. And someone else was going to be coming before him too. Tony thrust his hips up and Steve’s fist hit the sofa hard, denting the metal frame below the cushion as he cried out, his breathing almost becoming a sob.
Like that time in Manhattan with the bomb and the Chitauri. That was right, and it hadn’t made him feel good in the slightest, it wasn’t like in the books or movies or what people tell you, that sense of overwhelming goodness making you know you were doing right. It was pain, and anger, and fear… So much fear. Was that how Steve felt every time he had his little justice vomit all over people. Justice vomit, he liked that. He laughed quickly, nervously and put the phone down, then picked it back up again.
He sounded tired, or half asleep, but just the way he said his name was making Tony struggle to breath through his anger.
“Don’t leave me hanging here Captain.” He said breathlessly. Steve placed his hands on Tony’s hips as he straddled his abs, and didn’t even bother with the foreplay, he pulled the boxers down, letting Tony’s cock fling itself out of its restraints.
“Better, but you’re still missing a few words. Say my name again.” Tony bucked his hips yet again.
And then it all went to hell.
He couldn’t even stomach seeing Wanda.
secure building in Manhattan, shoot maybe America I’m sure I could hack the Pentagon if I wanted to. I asked you to meet me here because if something happened you could get out alive.”
Steve opened his eyes tentatively. “I have to say I acted purely on instinct here Tony. You’re a good looking guy but I can’t figure out if I want to hate you or want to sleep with you.”
Tony never got to finish his sentence, he was slammed full force into the wall. Surprise caused him to lose his balance and suddenly Steve was the only thing holding him off the ground, Steve was glaring at him, blue eyes hard like chips of flint. But there was something else too, Tony held his gaze trying to figure it out.
“Yeah, I know.” Tony shrugged and brought his other hand down to Steve’s chest. “I’m much less complicated. If I think you’re hot, I’ll fuck you, I could not give a rat’s ass about man, woman, super soldier, whatever the fuck people like Thor are yadda yadda. I like pretty things and you are a very pretty thing Steve. I’ve thought that from the beginning but you’re also aggravating as hell, pompous, self righteous and a total douche bag at times, that can be quite the turn off. But it wasn’t until the accords that I realised just how much I need you Steve. And I do, need you. Even if right now I want to beat the snot out of you, I need you and I want you.” He ran his hands up Steve’s chest and trailed his fingers around the other man’s nipples. “You are one hot piece of ass Rogers. Even if you are an asshole.”
Steve gave a token resistance before Tony put him on his back, he trailed his hands down Steve’s sides, using his fingernails on the skin and making the other man twist and shiver under him, he reached Steve’s legs and yanked them open, taking a moment to enjoy seeing Steven Roger’s pink little asshole and his baby blue eyes filled with lust. He ran his hands back down Steve’s thighs, knowing he was driving Steve wild, and then took his hips between them, Steve pulled Tony into his body with his steel legs and Tony pushed the head of his cock into him slowly, nudging at him inch by inch, Steve once again moaned deeply, breathlessly and Tony found himself in sheer delight that he was the cause of that throaty sound. He looked down and caught sight of Steve’s suit and that delight mingled with the softened anger from earlier and he thrust himself into Steve without ceremony. Steve screamed and gasped as Tony’s entire length entered his body roughly, Tony thought Steve might protest but instead he grabbed Tony’s hair and took Tony’s mouth roughly with his own.
“Good, glad we got that cleared up. So, what, you go back to your hidey hole, this whole shebang never happened and world keeps on searching for Captain America?”
“You? If I wanted you dead you would be, so would your rockabilly bionic friend.”
Almost as if in a dream, he saw himself press the button and the screen change to say ‘dialling’. He took a deep breath, closed his eyes and put the phone to his ear.
“Really Stark?” Steve tried to sound confident but it didn’t work. He looked down at himself and crossed his arms, he was in his suit with a jacket over the top, he shrugged the jacket off and hung it on a peg on the wall and moved closer.
“Yeah, probably. So who’s this friend, should I be jealous.” Tony smirked and raised one eyebrow devilishly.
“I refused to be the only one left with bruises from this.” Steve panted.
Steve ran one hand back up to Tony’s chin and brought Tony’s mouth back to his, Tony reached his hands up in turn and fumbled at Steve’s suit.
“Don’t, I give these babies out for free.” Tony raised one eyebrow mockingly as he popped the top button and unzippered his fly.
“Oh now I’m intrigued, come on where have you been hiding away all this time?”
“Son of a-“
Steve worked Tony’s cock as Tony pushed Steve so he was sitting up against the sofa, he lifted himself over the whopping great penis as it was now called in Tony’s mind and grabbed a condom, checking that it was extra large and stretchy, he had them in all sizes in every draw, you never knew who he might bring home. He ripped it open with his teeth and one hand, then drew his two lubed fingers up Steve’s shaft and then rolled the condom down it, they were already lubed, but Tony loved all the little things like the bottle in his hand, the condom almost didn’t fit and he had to swallow past a lump in his throat as he looked down at it. Steve was still working Tony slowly but surely throughout this and Tony handed him the other condom after ripping it out of the packet with his teeth. Steve put it on him with a clear precision that could only come from a methodical obsessive compulsive and then Tony dropped onto him, their wrapped tools rubbing against each other teasingly.
A faint trickling sound began and Steve looked around, on his left a waterfall was coming out of the wall, it travelled down, under a glass floor and disappeared into the other wall. Steve took a step and the floor lit up under his weight like a stepping stone, he moved into the middle of the room and stopped once more, almost forgetting Tony was still naked in his arms. To the left, hidden by the waterfall was a tiny tropical pool with koi karp swimming in it, the waterfall bubbled through it and trailed off to the left as well, where more fish were swimming.
Steve’s fingers were still on his belt loops but he moved them off and splayed his hands across Tony’s hipbones clumsily and Tony had to wonder when was the last time, if ever… (probably man or woman a small voice charmed, though there had been James Barnes…). Tony dashed the thought away, that was one road probably best left un-travelled.
“I’m almost a bit touched Tony.”
The sigh and chuckle of relieving tension from the other end made Tony squeeze his eyes shut and dig his fingers into his face.
“To the left up the glass staircase princess.” Tony motioned to a twisting clear glass staircase Steve hadn’t even noticed earlier, or any other time he’d be in Stark tower, not that he’d ever really been up in the Penthouse, the labs below, the party deck and the R&D floors below were where they all spent their time.. “You guys have your areas, I have mine, I have another suite below us but, I’d rather not use that one, that was where Pepper and I...” Tony crinkled his nose, sighed and then grinned, showing his teeth and pushing such thoughts away.
“And when will that be? Because you look spent.”
Tony bucked his hips once again and squeezed Steve’s cock, Steve clenched his ass cheeks around Tony’s shaft and Tony couldn’t help but cry out in unison with Steve.
“Alright, enough of the pillow talk, my feelings quota is maxed out today, are you still with me old man? Reckon you can keep up enough for round 3?”
“Drop it Tony.”
“You’re damned right I want to hit you”, Tony stalked past Steve and turned around. “I want to punch you in your perfect teeth as usual but once it seemed like a good, fun idea and now it feels like retribution.”
Tony leaned forwards, reaching out and grabbing Steve’s hair, pulling their mouths together. He kept on advancing, pushing Steve back to the edge of the bed. Steve scowled at him, but he let Tony press him backwards and got off the bed, Tony stood up and retook Steve’s mouth with his own, now the height difference showed and Steve had to lean down to keep the kiss going. Tony tugged on his hair and pulled him forwards until Tony was backed into the wall.
Steve got up, gracefully as fucking ever, and strode over to him with all the pretentious purpose of an action hero in a film, which he practically was. (God knows Stark Enterprises merchandising unit had wanted it to happen). He stood over Tony, silent, lips bruised but pursed, eyes roaming Tony’s body. He suddenly felt very naked, which was odd, because he’d turned up to many things but forgotten his clothes and not batted an eye. It was the hungry look in his eyes, it was driving Tony mad.
Tony grabbed him and in a singular motion turned him and shoved him backwards until his knees hit the edge of the bed and Steve went flying onto it. Tony knew if Steve wanted to he could turn to an immovable rock under Tony’s hands, but he still enjoyed shoving the Captain around. Tony advanced on Steve and Steve backed up on the bed, giving Tony space to crawl up him and drop onto him. He leaned one elbow by Steve’s head and took his lips for his own, conquering Steve’s still salty mouth, his tongue crashing against Steve’s and struggling for dominance over it. He reached down, his hand finding Steve’s gorgeous cock and grasping it firmly. Steve gasped into his mouth and Tony grabbed his bottom lip between his teeth, pulling at it, letting Steve moan, feeling his hot breath on his face as he stroked his hand up Steve’s lengthy, thick shaft. He could feel the heavy veins that crisscrossed it and he couldn’t believe how fantastic it felt in his hand. He dropped himself to the side of Steve slightly and with every pump of his hand he thrust into Steve’s side, rubbing his still flaccid cock up Steve’s hip, feeling the smooth, hard muscle as Steve’s body reacted to Tony’s ministrations.
“Oh, oh oh Stark.” He pulled in a sharp breath.
“Oh here comes the routine, you just can’t stand to have something you want can you, you have to wise crack the whole way.”
“No more talking, fuck the fighting, fuck Barnes, fuck SHIELD, I am going to ruin you Rogers, I hope that serum gave you super stamina in bed because I intend to see you unable to walk straight.” He purred, accentuating his words with thrusts of his hips that had the other man gasping into his hair.
This stopped Tony cold. “Don’t you dare, don’t you dare use me in comparison, you know what I never did? Murdered someone in cold blood with my bare hands!”
“I don’t care Tony, just! Fuck! Me!”
It was all his fault...
Steve cupped Tony’s balls for a moment, fondling them, exploring them and Tony gasped into Steve’s neck, he could feel precum spilling down and dampening his boxers and he knew Steve could feel the warmth spreading over his fingers, he could feel it driving Steve crazy. He worked Steve out to his full length and whispered into Steve’s burning neck. “Supersized indeed big boy, let’s bring you out to play shall we.” Steve turned his head and nipped Tony’s bottom lip with surprising force and Tony feathered a kiss at the edge of his mouth before sitting up, giving Steve ample moving room to take Tony’s weeping cock in his hand as his other hand stroked straight down the sensitive middle of his ass. He pushed into Steve’s hand, biting his lip and then opened his eyes and took his hand out of Steve’s boxers and the other he disentangled from his hair.
“Oh I knew there was a freak in the sheets hidden away inside there just begging to be let out. I told you I’d ruin you Stevey.”
“I don’t care, you’re underneath me right now, no one else and I want to know why?”
“This ain’t my first rodeo.” Tony took in the sight under him, holding himself up on his hands so he could look directly into Steve’s eyes, but that was boring. There was too much in them.
“Come on Rogers, I have absolutely no doubt you’ll be screaming my name by the end of this, but right now, I want you to beg, I want my name to come out as breathy and sensual as those sweet little moans you keep letting out.” Tony smirked at Steve, who raised his face minutely and looked at Stark, one eyebrow raised. Tony took his free hand and cupped the back of Steve’s neck and pulled his ear to his lips. “Say please, say please Tony, fuck me into oblivion, I’ll do what ever you want.” Tony trailed his tongue down Steve’s earlobe teasingly and Steve groaned, and Tony could hear a hint of defiance even in that.
Tony didn’t know anymore, it kept him awake at night sometimes. He put the phone down and scrubbed his hands over his face and breathed out harshly. It wasn’t about right or wrong anymore, or the past or the present it was about the future. They needed Steve, Tony needed Steve (though loath to admit it). Banner was gone, Widow was gone, the team were in some jail (or secure facility as it was called, not floating on the sea at least, they’d be released soon, so he’d heard, but kept tagged and supervised under the act Steve had fought so hard to protect them from), Thor was probably watching on and shaking his head, not even wanting to come down here and sort it out because it was so fucked up.
“You know; great sex aside I still want to punch you.” Tony remarked nonchalantly.
“You weren’t so willing to keep me alive the last time we saw each other.”
“You’re actually so short it’s ridiculous.”
“I can and I will and I reckon you’d love it if I did.”
Steve threw his head back and groaned and Tony seized the opportunity to climb back onto him, he sat up, straddling Steve’s waist once more.
“Promises promises Stark.” Steve replied breathlessly, spreading his legs either side of Tony’s own.
. Tony took a hand and slammed his shoulder down so he dropped back onto the couch. “Shut up and kiss me Rogers you pompous idiot.” Steve was already reaching up with his neck, Tony leant down and again their lips crashed together likes waves at the shore, the kiss washing over them, Tony shivered and pressed himself closer to Steve. Fucking asshole. Why did he taste so fucking good?
“You talk a good game Captain, but can you back it up?”
“You said no more talking, now hurry up and make good on all those promises you just whispered into my ear.” He breathed, licking his lips and grabbing at Tony’s ear with his teeth.
From here on out I refuse to take responsibility for anything that happens. Tony took over and the rest is, as they say, history.
“Now quit yammering and get started big boy, I want to see those Boy Scout lips on my cock like it was the tastiest popsicle you’ve ever had.”
Large, slender feet travelling up to long, corded legs that seem to stretch on for miles, large, muscled calves and thighs, smooth as a newborn babe, a tight, packed ass and something that most certainly was rather large bulging under the tight black boxers.
“Bet you didn’t have this shit in the 40s, Strawberry flavour.” He winked and climbed back onto Steve, dropping the condoms onto his chest, slipping backwards until he could feel Steve’s penis pushing into his goddamn lower back it was so big. He popped the cap and grabbed Steve’s hand, upending the bottle and pouring it into his open palm. “Get to work Cap.” He grabbed the hand and wrapped it around two of his fingers, sliding them through Steve’s now closed fist, delighting in Steve’s expression, part lust part wonderment, then led his hand down to his own cock, Steve obliged, never taking his eyes off Tony’s face.
“You know I can’t Tony.”
“It wasn’t him!” Steve moved closer and Tony stood stock still, he wasn’t sure he could move and not punch Steve. “He was brainwashed, why won’t you get that? You’re willing to look past all of us and what we did and we’re willing to look past what you did because we can all see the person behind it but Bucky? Bucky was forced to murder people like a puppet with no free will of his own and you can’t look past that. You had a choice, Widow had a choice, Bucky doesn’t.” Steve was breathing hard now, his chest rising and falling and his fists clenched. “We’ve all had a wake up call in our lives, Bucky had his and put himself under, that was his choice, like your choice to stop building weapons. Bucky is a weapon, that’s what you like to call us now right? Bucky has neutralised the threat that he poses.”
Steve spat out more feathers and gripped the edge of the armrest until his knuckles went white. Tony heard a rending whine as Steve bent the metal frame, and then the whole couch lurched as part of the frame snapped under Steve’s hand.
“No, I trust you Tony, but I don’t trust the rest of America.” Steve kept his gaze steady.
“Oh Tony! Oh God Tony!”
And then he was moving, moving against Steve’s strength, pushing him back, pulling his wrists from his grip as their lips mashed together and he shoved Steve into the coffee table, the only reason his bulk didn’t smash it was because Tony had had Thor around for parties enough times to think twice about furniture, things hit the floor, probably smashed, who cared? Steve sat down with an astonished look as Tony loomed over him. Part of Tony was screaming at him. What the fuck are you doing? This prick ruins everything! Part of him was on a rant about spangly things and disappearing acts and part of him was thinking about ripping off his stupid costume, didn’t he own any fucking normal clothes?!
“Why am I not surprised at all.” He drew in a good humoured breath and continued to laugh.
“Yeah but you’ll heal much faster than I will.”
Tony could feel himself burning low down in his hips and then gasped as Steve drew one hand away from his ass and made its way to his balls, cupping and fondling them, stroking the sensitive skin between his ass and his balls then going back to caress his sack. That was what did it for Tony, he could feel his cock throbbing in Steve’s mouth, who hummed onto his shaft, vibrating it, encouraging it, driving Tony wild. He buried himself in Steve’s mouth, crying out, closing his eyes and having the breath knocked out of him as he came into Steve’s mouth, he heard Steve take in a breath through his nose and then he was swallowing everything Tony had to offer him and that just made Tony lose his mind. He opened his eyes, panting and looked back down at Steve. Steve whose face was flushed, his eyes closed, his mouth still working Tony until every last drop of cum was swallowed. Tony had never seen anything more erotic in his life. Bliss stole over Tony and he untangled his fingers from Cap’s hair, letting Steve slowly draw himself off Tony. He looked up, licking his lips and Tony groaned at the sheer sexuality of Steve’s expression right then. As Steve lifted his chin he could see Steve’s enormous erection, just begging to have something done about it. Steve followed Tony’s eyes and smirked before getting up. He pressed a hard kiss to Tony’s lips and swiped his lips down Tony’s cheek to his jaw where he nipped and feathered kisses down his neck, leaning into Tony against the wall, pressing his erection into Tony’s stomach and grinding against him.
“That’s it, say my name baby.” Tony smirked, enjoying watching Steve unravel above him. He circled his hips once more and brought his thumb to the tip of Steve’s aching cock, where he rolled his thumb in a circle across it.
“A strip tease from Tony Stark, don’t I feel special.”
Steve let out a long sigh and relaxed his body under Tony’s. “At first there was only Bucky, I tried it with women I really did but it felt so forced, just doing my duty, Buck got all the girls and they just looked at me with pitiful eyes. Bucky was the only one who looked at me and saw me. But I always felt that I didn’t deserve him and he’d eventually get bored of me. I always felt I had to prove myself in every sphere. And then Peggy came along, and she was perfect and she saw me. I’ll love her till the day I die Tony. I had that taken from me and though I tried with Sharon and Nat-“
Steve toppled forwards with a yelp as Tony darted to the side so Steve fell against the back of the sofa, so yet again Tony could put himself on top.
“Afraid you can’t keep up more like, old man, need some help revving up?”
“You’re not exactly small yourself Iron Man.”
“I don’t even know what that is.”
There was a beep and suddenly the walls were filled with video footage of the last two hours in the Penthouse lounge, Steve dropped Tony, who fell with a yelp to the floor, but sat up laughing his head off as he watched Steve slowly turn bright red as he took in the images before him. He looked down at Tony, who had one hand on his stomach and the other propping him up as he howled with laughter.
“How the fuck do you get this shit off Rogers? I’ve seen you take it off a million times and I am still in the dark here.”
“Seriously Tony, you want to talk about this now.”
Now Tony’s hands were roaming up and down that ridiculous suit, thank god he didn’t have his mask on; Tony would have destroyed it then and there, who wore that suit like that, why? Just, casual clothing, how long had it been? Did he really have to dress like that now? He did it on purpose Tony was sure.
“You’re right; I think the longest I’ve gone without sex is like three days.” He laughed and then moaned as he felt Steve start to push back onto his fingers.
“Was that my couch you little prick!” Tony yelled.
. As Steve’s cock started to go flaccid he pulled his ass of Tony’s own cock and spun around, Tony had time to think damn he recovers fast, before Steve had shoved Tony into the sofa, he peeled the condom off Tony’s still erect shaft and took it in his mouth. His hot breath ran down his shaft as took Tony’s cock like it was an ice lolly and Tony couldn’t take his eyes off the sight before him. He took his cum covered hand and put a finger in his mouth, tasting Rogers on his tongue and he groaned. Steve finally released Tony’s now limp penis and licked the cum off his lips, eliciting another groan from Tony.
“You don’t say shit when you have your damned clothes on Rogers.” Tony bit down on the section of skin between the neck and shoulder and Steve groaned, leaning over on the bed and pushing Tony off him so he could face him.
Tony leaned down and gave Steve’s cock a quick tug. “Don’t worry, I haven’t forgotten about you big boy, but this ass is demanding my attention. It’s gonna be tough work leaving a mark on a super soldier.”
“Do you ever stop talking?” Those blue eyes captured Tony’s gaze, whose eyes kept flicking back down to Steve’s smooth, chiselled chest.
“Ooh you almost sound jealous.” Tony gave him a hurt look.
Steve looked back at Tony, his eyes burning, and licked his lips as he saw Tony pleasuring himself to the sight of his naked body. He longed to reach down to his throbbing cock, and he wondered if Stark would hit him again if he tried. He decided Tony would, so he did it. Quick as a flash Tony dropped his cock and socked his open palm into Steve’s ass and Steve let out the loudest moan he could muster, dropping his head into his hands and groaning, flirting his ass at Tony.
He wanted Steve to make him understand, or at least fucking try, not give him the whole sap story ‘sparing his feelings’ bullshit. He wanted to talk to him alone, no fucking Bucky or Ross or anyone but them, maybe he could punch him a few times until he felt better and no one could stop him.
“Shut up Stark, I don’t think your sofa will survive round two.” Steve chuckled as he carried him up the staircase.
“Come now Rogers, you can do better than that. I want you to beg for it.”
“So where have you been? You and-“ He couldn’t bring himself to say the name, so just let the implication hang in the air between them.
Steve sighed and dropped his arms to his sides. “I wanted to be ready for anything.”
And now Tony was waiting for that call, no one knew he was here but Pepper and she had cleared the building out. He expected Steve to arrive incognito, in jeans and a god awful baseball cap and aviator shades like he normally did when hiding. In some butt ugly little car that belonged in the 40s just like Steve did.
“I can get us home,” Tony spoke quietly into the silence with the intensity of benediction. “Use some nanites, reroute the power to maximize efficiency. We’ll regroup, and we’ll then fight” This what he was made to do – this was what his mind was built for: to create under pressure. He needed to know if what he was dreaming about was indeed only a dream, but he needed to know who was still alive; he wasn’t going to die alone out here if he could help it. Besides, Thanos needed to go.
He woke up with tears streaking down his face. His soul still ached, but his eyes were dry when he finally moved from his position. He peeled himself off the wall, mouth dry and face wet, and he rubbed his drying tears with the back of his hand. A bottle of water appeared in his sight. “Thanks,” Tony rasped, taking the bottle from Nebula’s hand. He drank with deep swallows, the chill of the water refreshing his body.
“They should be honored I’m making upgrades on their ship,” Tony retorted. “It’s not very often I offer my services for free.”
“Obie made me.”
Steve looked back at the calm and sad brown eyes, taking in the beautiful man in front of him. He wished that this wasn’t a dream, that he had the opportunity to tell him face to face that Steve
. It took what felt like an embarrassingly a long amount of time for him to zero in at the source of the noise, but when he finally focused on the lab desk at the far end of the table, a pair of eyes stared back up at him.
Tony couldn’t believe his ears, and he stared as he greeted her like an old friend. Just like the Doctor, the man was crazy, pretending that such an inanimate object was real. And Tony had liked his looks. He was disappointed, but still he said, “That’s a thing…a police box.”
“What is this? A fucking game of Whack-A-Mole?” Tony grumbled loudly over the comms.
“Can we come forward?” Tony asked. After a beat, Tiny Steve nodded.
“Wingless, flightless, grounded through and through,” they chanted around him, “Pinioned, primeless, a freak, that’s you!”
He would have preferred the curse of being flightless over the curse of being black-winged.
Tony stood out there in the dark and in the cold, alone in his thoughts when Rhodey opened the back door. “How long have you been standing there, idiot?” Rhodey asked. “Where’s the Captain?”
He struggled to compose himself. “You know what she told me once? She said that every werewolf had a mate. I was lucky to have her. She made me very happy.”

“Obie’s riding my ass to finish the latest guns for the military,” Tony grouched. “I should be heading home to finish it.”
I thought we banned Tony from the kitchen last time he set fire to the stove.
“No,” Tony corrected. He looked out at the derelict buildings, imagining the screams and despair on these streets during their last moments. No, he wasn’t going to have it. He repeated, voice slightly firmer now, “No.”
Sleep didn’t sound like a bad idea, although Tony still dreaded slipping back into his nightmares. So he scoffed, “Sleep is for the weak” as the last bite of biscuits disappeared.

“That’s a very bold statement there, Doc. We don’t have enough time to learn everything, especially not at the Doctorate level.”
Ultimately though, he was an Avenger through and through, and he had a job to do. Protecting Earth from the Chitauri, from Thanos, for the sake of the rest of humanity was something he had signed up to do when he took the mantle of being a superhero. Now that everything was gone, he had nothing to lose, and the prospects of reversing what Thanos had done gave himself a mission he could look forward to.
“I definitely did. But really, bigger on the inside? That was really,
They gathered at the Wakandan war council meeting room. At any other time, Steve would have loved to study the grand architecture of the room, detailed with vibranium and gold, but now, he had no energy to study the art carefully. Steve sat at the head of the conference table; the Avengers, Rocket, and Okoye sat along the other sides. Spread evenly on the oak surface were a row of Kimoyo beads. Each bead lit up to play holograms above of the various news channels played above their heads, but only half were on air and broadcasting the ruins on the ground.
The words just slipped right out of his mouth. “Fuck me.”
“I’m fine,” Tony dismissed. “What’s the update on the program?”
Steve nearly dropped the bottle, and he cursed, scrambling to grip onto the bottle more tightly. He walked into the bathtub and stretched his wings out. He looked back at them.
(See the end of the chapter for
This time, there was a man standing there placidly behind him, staring directly at him with a bemused look on his face. Tony yelped and nearly brained himself against the blue box, barely stopping himself from crashing into them with a flailing hand. Then he whirled around and stared.
“That’s not possible,” Tony denied. “It can’t be alive.”
Tony leapt back in shock, jerking his hand away from the box. He didn’t shriek at all, nosiree, from being caught out snooping around the box. He turned around to see a tall, skinny man standing behind him. He looked like a professor, with a brown suit and horn-rimmed glasses, but even with a long trench coat over his attire, hands tucked snugly, he was not dressed for the New England winter at all. For one, the man didn’t have a cap on – surely his ears must be freezing. Second, he was wearing

Tony hummed. “I do know is that the Infinity Stones emit a wavelength no matter where they are, separated or together. The stones being together would create a much more concentrated pulse. If you can create something that would hone the signal, you would get Thanos too.”
He just wished Tony was here, sweeping to save the day, his flattering words easing people’s apprehension. Tony always did it so much better than him. But, as it was, toiling on the ground, removing debris from the streets, made the world a little bit more grey without the easy banter Tony normally made to ease the chore.
“I don’t think time travel is a science that will be found until long after I’m dead.” Tony was just repeating himself now. But really, Stevens acted like he was an old soul, kind of like how Howard acted, with his outdated vernacular and ancient eyes. But as Tony talked to Stevens more, he also realized that Stevens had some future tech knowledge that they didn’t have yet, so it was hard to place
“Captain,” Fury greeted him, his wings primed behind him. It was if the Director was always alert, on guard, ready to fly and fight at a moment’s notice. Steve noted that his wings looked black, but they weren’t as dark as his: there was a tinge of dark purple that stained his otherwise black wings. “I’m Fury, director of SHIELD. Welcome to the twenty-first century.”
And Steve was assaulted with a myriad of panic, shyness, love, and
appreciated it in a way that Howard never did. Even Obie gave him a calculated look whenever he showed him anything.
Like what? Do tell the public what you find attractive about me. Don’t forget to talk about my ASS-ets.
He was shaking, Steve realized, as they stood out there on the balcony with him about to show his wings to the world for the first time in seventy years. “I’m so scared,” he said in a small voice.
God, Pepper. He missed her. He hope she survived this. But even if she was still alive, there was no chance that she would take him back again. Every time he promised her that he would stop being a superhero, he turned around and broke that promise. Tony closed his eyes. There was no way for him to retire after this mess, if he ever got back to Earth. He sighed and tuned back to hear Nebula say, “You should get some sleep before we land. We may encounter hostiles while we’re down there, and it would be better if we were prepared and well-rested.”
Tony pressed a kiss to his wings and then made a trail of kisses before he kept his lips pressed against the back of Steve’s neck. “Anytime sweetheart. I’d be happy to join you whenever you want to fly.”
The monitor whirred to life. “Calibrating,” it said. “Good evening, Mr. Stark.”

“Hey, it’s just you and me. No one else is watching.” Tony pecked him on the lips again, a quick one, but one filled with the unwavering passion Tony had for Steve. “I’m going to take your brace off.”
“Set course to Earth,” Tony decided, turning back to the ship.
And his body was desperate for the Alpha in front of him.
Tony laughed with him. “Amazing, wasn’t it?”
“You won’t,” Tony promised. “I’ll be there to catch you. Every time you fall, I’ll be there.”
“Didn’t we agree that we would never mention that incident again?” Tony interrupted. He glared at his friend.
He kind of hated his life.
Yinsen was silent for a moment. Then he asked, “You know, the Ten Rings killed my mate and my children. They took them out into the village square, with all the others. Firing squad. I was spared because I was a doctor.” He pressed a shaking hand to his chest. He looked at Tony with tears in his eyes. “There’s a gaping hole in my chest where my mate bond was, but I’m still living because that’s what my mate would have wanted me to do. She was a doctor too, a doctor for the supernatural. She could have died many times over with the way that our race is hated, but she did her job anyway because that was what she needed to do. I’m carrying her legacy, no matter how much it hurts.”
Steve babbled, voice hoarse and broken, “Tony.” It was a benediction, and Steve was sobbing for the man who fixed him.
“I know, but remember Hammer?”
Clint and Thor groaned.
He needed to work on his artificial intelligence program, stat.
They chuckled awkwardly for a second before Tony broke it. “Pep wants a PR photo in our penguin suits before the clock strikes midnight and I turn back into a pumpkin.”
that guy over there looks familiar. Wait. That was my date.
“No,” Steve denied. He would never tell Tony what happened, cross his heart and hope to die.
, he didn’t say. He was so fucking skinny and frail, and sick all the time. There was no way his soulmate would love him.
The other hand was stroking his feathers, combing through them gently, grooming him. He never groomed them before; no one ever groomed them for him either. It was...a heated sensation that rippled down his spine, but for now, he was content to lay there, feeling the digits comb through his feathers. He felt clean; Tony must have cleaned him up while he was gone, and they were under Tony’s blankets. He loved it: it felt like Tony was completely protecting him.
“I’m okay,” Tony said, but he let Yinsen prop him up all the same. He looked down at his bandaged chest and the battery that was dropped next to him. “That battery might not be though.”
“You don’t need to be sorry about it, sweetcheeks,” Tony retorted. “This wings can take a lot. It’s just that your wings must be aching, so soaring is easier than keeping yourself afloat.”
Rhodeybear! BETRAYAL.
“Excuse me,” he said apologetically. He stepped aside to let the shorter man in front of him pass.
Steve squeezes his throat tightly so that his airway is constricted even further. He can't breathe. He's weak. His mind is only focused on the way that Steve's hand is restricting his breath and the pounding of the flesh behind him.
You’re baking? I’ll be over soon to be your taste tester!
Steve got out of his bed and looked at the bustling city below him. He could feel his back twinge as he moved. “You should have left me in the ice, if you knew what was good for you.”
I’ll bring donuts?
“Okay,” Steve whispered.
“You done?” Nebula asked. Tony looked to the side to see her looking at him. In moments, a wave of exhaustion crashed over him, and he slumped back into his chair.
“So are you here to get it fixed? Because I know nothing about…chameleon circuits, but I’m a quick study,” Tony asked. “I’m sure that if you give me a couple hours I can have it fixed.”
“She’s a professor at Columbia and was complaining about the speech you gave, the one that you and Pepper gave, I mean.”
When his seven a.m. alarm rang, he had gotten zero sleep, not enough coffee in his system, and a grumpiness that would send most people who encountered him running for the hills. He needed more coffee, desperately. Tony’s back cracked in a series of
As much as he wanted to kill them himself, he forced himself to reply, “No. Round them up for SHIELD.”

A muffled yelp from Clint, a thump, and when the comms came to life again, Natasha replied, “Will do. Over and out.”
He did, he couldn’t deny it. But he also knew that they could never happen because Tony was brilliant, and kind, and amazing, larger than life and perfect and beautiful.
“My name is Yinsen.” When he was sure Tony wasn’t going to move any further and hurt himself, he stood up, knees cracking. He looked old, tired, broken, but still, there was some strength in him as well. He moved closer to the fire, taking a bucket with him. “We’ve met before, once.”
“Our lives are weird,” Tony replied, twisting slightly to kiss her cheek.
“Another one,” Tony commanded.

“Joining us for dinner?” Bruce asked from the kitchen, where the smell of indian food wafted through the open doorway.

Thankfully Tony didn’t do more than that. The elevators slowed to a stop and opened its doors. “Hey bud!” Tony called out. Steve followed.
“I’m going to get you back for bopping me on the nose!”
“Tony.” The expression on Natasha’s face looked so intense that it took all of Steve’s willpower not to wince under her gaze.
“Look at us, using our adult words,” Tony smirked.
It was too easy for him to pack the small amount of stuff he owned and left the SHIELD safehouse.
Steve held him in his arms. “Take all the time you need, sweetheart.”
Tony turned around slightly. “Do you like them?”
And although he hated his wolf, this missing presence was worse than anything he ever experienced. He let out a cry of despair, just before they settled Tony into a chair and strapped him down.
Indeed, some feathers hurt when he plucked them away, but he gritted his teeth through the pain and endured it.
“You’re so pretty, sweetheart,” Steve replied softly, pulling his fingers out from Tony’s ass, and then there was the thicker, blunter pressure of his cock pressing against the rim of his ass. “Are you sure you’re ready for this? Condom?”

He was mostly flightless now. He supposed he liked it. Still, there was a foul taste at the back of his throat when he saw the rest of the feathers he couldn’t reach stuck in the back of his wings.
“Alright Cap. I’ll go see if Natasha needs any help.” The other set of footsteps walked away.
“You keep saying that you’re a horrible lecturer, but you still carve out a large portion of your time to help your students, even when it isn’t convenient for you,” Rhodey said, fully grinning now.
And in the wake of the setting sun, the tears pattered to the ground, and the Avengers held their collective breaths in defeat,
Also, you’re not better than me.
“Stop!” the voice said, but Tony didn’t listen. He needed to flee, get out of this. It was all wrong, wrong, wrong...
Steve was helpless, especially after the way Tony’s tongue darted between his lips. Steve thought he might be drooling. Then Tony winked.
Tony was still absently chewing on the final bites of his toast when he saw that the box – the TARDIS – was still parked in the middle of Killian Court. The campus was now bustling with students hurrying to classes before they became tardy, and in the morning light with the snowstorm dying down there was no way that genius-level intellectuals would miss a great big police box in the middle of their campus.
“We are face to face,” Steve pointed out.
“And what’s that?”
he said gravely, but his eyes twinkled with mirth.
“So you’ve never flown on your wings before.”
“Again?” the Doctor asked with a raised eyebrow.
Steve hummed. “Thanks for teaching me how to fly,” he whispered.
Tony couldn’t believe it, not without more proof.
I’ll make sure he’ll be there.
Stevens glanced at him. “You probably wouldn’t believe me if I told you.”
Nat: 3, Steve: 1. Steve: 5, Nat: 4. And on and on they went, blocking fists, grappling bodies, twisting around each other continuously as minutes, hours ticked by, until the sun came up and they finally stopped, panting hard from the exertion. Sweat dripped down their faces and Natasha’s hair no longer was in a braid. Steve was sure that he didn’t look much better.
Tony slipped the outstretched hand into his palm and dragged it closer to him. When he had Stevens’s attention, he asked, “Are you okay?”
. It hurt, to say the least, watching as Tony disappeared into thin air, knowing that Tony had carried the weight of Steve’s transgressions for the last two years. And although it was Tony’s fault for attacking Bucky in a fit of passionate and blind anger, Steve was as much at fault for provoking Tony and escalating it, fighting Tony the way he did bullies.
Steve laughed. “Mission accomplished. But you were certainly worth waiting for.” He drew back and stared into his eyes.

And then he unlatched Tony’s legs from his waist and dropped down to his knees. Tony stared down at him from between his legs, feeling more than vulnerable in this state than ever before.

“Yeah, alright.” Bucky shrugged. “But as you noticed, I don’t have friends either, so you’ll have to do.”
Tony wanted to take his words back, but it was too late, and the easy camaraderie slipped away like dust blowing in the wind.
Steve gaped after him as he turned around, wings clinking softly as moved and entered his car, Bruce following him.
“Indeed. We have work to do.” Steve nodded before he changed the subject. “Give me whatever information you have on the Stones, and we’ll work on it from our side too.”
Steve shoved the last goon into the wall in a frustrated fit before he slammed the edge of his shield into the electronic keypad. He was tired of HYDRA’s shenanigans, to say the least. They had better things to do than to chase down every last bit of HYDRA that would
Steve looked at him. “More than amazing,” he asserted. Adrenaline raced through his body as they landed back on the balcony, and he stared at Tony with love in his eyes. He...he had no words for him. It was more than love - it was devotion, an implicit trust, everything, literally everything. He wanted Tony so much that the feeling overwhelmed him.
Tony sighed. “It’s morning. As morning as it can be.”
“I have two idiots for bots.” He looked up, praying for patience. “DUM-E, get off of Butterfingers. I know you like to play with the whisk, but you like to pull the thing, and I do not have the time to fix you or Butterfingers! I have so much work to do and fixing you because you were a dumb idiot is the last thing I need tonight.”
Finally, Steve looked at Tony, taking in the way his honey-brown eyes shone dimly under the red light. Tony deserved this and more. He needed to face his fears, get the words off his chest, tell Tony while he looked at him in the eyes. “But you’re more than that –“

Rhodey stopped short and looked back at him. “Say what?” he asked. “What the hell?”
“What’s the catch?” Steve asked dully.
“But you did, Steve. And I hurt you too, but now though? This hurts more than anything else.” Tony shook his head, and tears began to leak out of his eyes. “I miss you. I miss Pepper and Rhodey. I hate space.”
“What did you do Tony?” Steve said, pushing him back slightly so that he could look at Tony in the eyes.
“I mean it, Steve,” Tony’s voice got quiet. “No settling.”
There was no time to think; he didn’t need to. His uniform ripped apart as he jumped vertically into the sky and his wings stretched out from their confines, shattering the back brace completely. He wasn’t going to kill another man he cared about because he was too scared. Not this time. Never again.
Steve breathed and leaned forward. Tony pressed his forehead against his in comfort. “Can you do it?” Steve asked.
“But time travel is impossible.” Even though Tony did see the size difference between the interior of the TARDIS in comparison to the exterior, it was just simply hard to believe that such a thing like time travel existed because it...just wasn’t possible.
Then he looked back to see a smoking gun. The man turned and fled, and Steve turned blindly until his eyes settled upon Erskine’s fallen form. With his last breath, he smiled, proud of his final creation.
him, and he hurt him badly.
When they were done with him, he was still twitching with the after effects of electrocution as they dumped him back into his prison. He couldn’t stop the small pained cries coming out of his mouth.

I’ve only accepted it to get the other guy off my back.
“No you’re not,” Rhodey agreed. “Pity for those who ever have to be in your class.”
Tony said nothing. It was better if he didn’t.
Tony said,  “You know, I’ve been trying to figure you out. You seem different, sound different, act differently from anyone else, and I’m not sure what it is.”
Steve stumbled forward, his wings flexing in the brace behind him, and Archie took a step back, laughing when Steve’s fist swung and missed. He blew the feather towards him, and the black feather caught in the air, swinging down gently to the ground.
“And sign it from both of us, J,” Tony supplied.
But he wasn’t falling; he was in the air, and Tony was holding him. “Stretch your wings out honey. I’m not going to let you fall.”
Update: everything’s under control, mostly. Besides the heat, Tony was winging the recipe and apparently put olive oil in the recipe. Or maybe it was motor oil?
Steve returned desperately, bucking into Tony’s grip. Tony looked at him, eyes darkened with lust and heat.
“Too much,” Tony finally groaned, grabbing Steve’s head by the hair and pulling him away. Steve’s eyes were blown, high on pleasuring his cock, and his lips were wet with saliva. Tony was sure he didn’t look any better. “Please, Steve.” He didn’t know what he was asking, he just needed something, anything.
Breaking into this police box was hard, Tony quickly discovered. Every time he set the tumblers to their correct unlocking position, somehow the tumblers fell right back down. Every time. It was as if the locks had a life form of their own.
“That’s only Deborah, Stevens,” Tony replied gently. “You’ve met her, and from what she’s told me, you’ve known her for a week.”
The centaur slid ungracefully off his fingers, stumbling for a few steps until he got his legs under him. Tiny Steve shot him a dirty look, and Steve grinned back innocently.
was miniscule compared to the donut which had carried him lightyears away from home. Tony never anticipated that he would live to see this side of the universe; he’d always imagined that he would die fighting on home turf, protecting Earth’s people. Now that he was here though, it brought him no comfort to imagine what was to come. The futurist felt wary, even afraid of the future; the things to come would be so much larger than what he could perhaps handle with his own technology and abilities. He looked out at the wide expanse, unseeing, as he held his cold helmet in his hands, its form scratched, dull, and dented. The coldness of the metal seeped into his palms, leeching heat from his body and leaving him desolate and lonely.
“Yeah?” Stevens breathed. “And you got to see the inside too?”
over yours truly. Do you remember when
When SHIELD got him settled in, he looked at himself in the mirror, perfect in all the ways he wasn’t before he got the serum, and he didn’t know the man who stared back at him. It was him, and yet it wasn’t. But maybe now, as he looked at the timer, his soulmate would like him.
“Well then, I’m glad to be of service.”
Bucky saw through him and fixed Steve with a determined stare. “Loving someone may not ever be easy, but there is a reason why they’re your soulmate.”

“You’re
“But –“
Steve looked at it, perplexed and cautious at first, when he saw the letter sitting innocently on the kitchen table. After determining that it wasn’t dangerous and it wouldn’t explode in his face, he opened it with glee.
He replied absently, “I get that a lot.”
in the present.”
“You know, I think I’m going to take a last look around, make sure that there’s nothing left, and then let’s blow this popsicle stand,” the first voice said.
“Cool, looking forward to seeing what HYDRA’s come up with this time. Almost there.”
“You can’t blame yourself,” Steve insisted.
Yet, there was an inkling of hope, perhaps even a reconciliation, with the sketch.
Thankfully Yinsen didn’t question him. Instead, he just said, “Tell me how.”
Happy Thanksgiving everyone and a reminder to be safe when cooking (we’re looking at you
“Bwubwubwee!”
Tony chuckled and graciously accepted the replacement drink from the waiter, who swirled up as soon as Pepper left.
when he wasn’t looking, and one Anthony Stark looked at him with veiled distaste. He thought that having a soulmate would complete his life, would be happy to
Tony itched to go home as soon as possible. He felt untethered while he was out in the middle of nowhere, alone, with no friends to lean upon. It was like Afghanistan, but worse, because there was no guarantee that he could escape from this like he did back then.
“Freak,” he spat. “Doom, black like a raven and harbinger of death.”
“Why are you thinking about this now?” Natasha’s gaze wasn’t accusatory, just curious.
What happened to the omelette Stark? Not as *EGGS*traordinary as you planned?
“He’s not worth it then,” Tony said. “If you don’t know what you did wrong and he’s not inclined to tell you, you should drop his ass to the curb.”
“Iron Man!” Steve said into his mic, even though he knew it was a futile effort. Tony tumbled freely in the air like a puppet.
“I’m going to get him,” Steve promised, standing up. As he did so, feathers fluttered and rippled in the air.
“I—” Steve hiccuped, “I need it, Tony. Please give your cock to me.”
“You’re welcome.” Steve nuzzled Tony’s cheek. “Does that mean we’re a thing now?”
man was here, alive, in the States, much less within yards of… .
I can't have caused THAT many fires. It was like, once, a month, MAX.
Bundled up in swathes of heavy coats and a hat, the smaller man mumbled something incomprehensible through his scarf. As he moved past Stevens, he glanced up, and Stevens froze, staring at those familiar eyes that he also hadn’t seen in years.
