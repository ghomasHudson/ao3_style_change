John looked up at him, tear tracks on his cheeks. “That I don’t deserve your love,” he rasped, “but I’d be a fucking liar if I said I’m not grateful to have it.”
John sat down with me, before he went to bed, lifting my feet into his lap.
“And Mummy has final say?”
“Your nose is beautiful.” I insisted. “I love nothing better than waking up to see your nose.... and your upper lip, right here...” I pressed my lips to the area under his nose.
“I expected them to try and kill me then, but they weren’t finished gloating. I was alive... which meant YOUR life was forfeit, John. They...” I swallowed hard, forcing my voice to remain steady. “They showed me video... they claimed it was being filmed live in London and sent directly to them – that there was a three second delay, no more, in seeing what was actually happening...
A man vindictive enough to want to punish the Omega for running away with a violent death. A man uncaring enough to conscript innocent bystanders through their biology into a savage mob with the Omega as its focal point.
Victor jumped back, but he removed his hand from my neck more slowly.
"You're passionate about it."
I nodded. "Are you going to see other people?” I attempted nonchalance. “Pick up handsome strangers on the Tottenham Court Road Underground platform."
“You’ll be watched by Moran or his people, of course. Take her to brunch at that place she likes on Marlebone road. In the café, make sure you sit with your back to the window. The deeper in the better. Order, then go to the gents, one of Mycroft’s men will be waiting for you. Swap coats with him – he’ll be roughly your height and build and they’ll style his hair like yours. He’ll take your place with Mrs. Hudson – protect her if need be.”
“I’m yours…” Mycroft blinked and a look of cautious wonder overtook his face. “Yes, yes, quite acceptable.
It was an obituary.
Lestrade produced a bottle of rather nice whisky from the pocket of his coat and set it on the table. I got a couple glasses out and reached for the whisky.
John worries his friends and lovers.
“If you say so.”
Angus nodded but his mouth was tight. "All right, John. Take care of your problem." He said and walked away down the hall.
“We’re already giving him antibiotics. Clean them thoroughly.” I felt a stethoscope on my back, then on my chest.
Shane’s smile was genuine. “I’ll call you then.”
"Fantastic. Really... quite extraordinary." John kissed Sherlock again.
"Jesus, yes! It was amazing. But, Sherlock, I don't want you to do something just because you think I'll like it..."
They walked silently for a while, shoulders bumping now and again, smiling at each other. John thought Shane would ask him back to his flat again… John wondered how he would answer.
I was always smaller than the other boys, smaller and red-headed, ripe for bullying. I learned to fight early, learned to show the bigger boys that they couldn’t scare me, couldn’t take advantage of me. I took a few beatings, but I was quick. Small and quick, I would get under their guard and knock them down before they even got a blow in. Then I’d offer my hand to help them up. Most boys took it. Some didn’t and I’d have to fight, have to work for the respect I demanded. I never considered not fighting.
“Oh, erm, ok. Yeah.”
He had not turned from scrawling his formulae. “No? I’m glad.”
Mycroft was wearing a three-piece suit in a muted tartan and a tie with the tightest, straightest Windsor knot Lestrade had ever seen. He wanted to peel it off the other man, piece by bloody, bespoke piece, and run his hands over the vulnerable skin underneath.
“I thought I’d find Shane here.” She observed.
"Nurse! I need help!" John shouted as loudly as he could. He took Sherlock's pulse again – nothing! John tried again, repositioning his fingers, searching for the jugular... he felt his own heartbeat racing in his fingertips... but Sherlock's heart was still.
“I need you to leave the flat with Mrs. Hudson at noon – it’s important that you get Mrs. Hudson out.”
Instead of returning to the Pensioners' Hotel, Sherlock went to one of his bolt holes, an artist's loft in Barking. The long ride on the Underground allowed him to rein in his urge to score heroin immediately and forget what he had just seen in its blissful anesthesia.
“But he lost.”
Watson’s eyes narrowed, and he stepped in front of his mate. Mummy remembered to look at him, not the Omega.
The swelling had gone down, his cock and balls normally sized again, but black with subcutaneous bleeding – it extended down his thighs, striped with pale rope burns. He looked like some sort of half-zebra creature, alien to his own eyes.
John hated how easily and quickly she deceived him. But he couldn’t tell him she was an assassin. He had no proof. “She’s just not for me. Not the one, you know?”
Sherlock’s face fell, and he blinked dumbly.
“No, no, that’s brilliant,” John whispered in response to Sherlock’s alarmed stammer. He palmed Sherlock through his pajamas.
As John moved off Mary, Sherlock saw his hard, wet cock leave her vagina, and he felt sick and guilty. He was aware that his mouth was open and his lips were trembling, but he couldn’t move. His throat felt clogged, like bile was about to rise.
“But, we’ve been living together without an issue for a year,” she protested. “I don’t understand where any of this is coming from! You made reservations for one of the best restaurants in London, and it was all going well until we got interrupted.”
“I feared this part, too” Sherlock sighed, his face open and slightly sad, “admitting to myself that I wanted to be in a relationship with you, and felt--desire.” He took a small sip of water, hiding his face behind the glass for a moment. “It was very difficult to come to terms with,” he mumbled.
John looked at him, eyebrow raised.
“About your text last night, I think you’re right. But did it really matter in the end? She always loved herself more than anyone else, even Rosie. Remember how she left Rosie to go find Ajay?”
“I’ve only been here for a minute,” John said with a forced smile, the tension from yesterday still present.
“Why would government agents help me move?”
John’s eyes went down to his lips, which were a little redder than usual from the humid air of the bathroom after Sherlock’s shower. His eyes moved back to meet Sherlock’s, and the second he saw the wheels turn in his head, John pressed their lips together. His lips were warm, really warm, and soft, and--
John glanced down at him and laughed through his nose. “Go to bed.”
“I know.” John looked tired, but pleased. “I’ll be glad when all of this is over. Help me unpack?”
John didn’t say anything.
Irene looked surprised, her calm and superior aura broken. She regained her composure. “Well, that’s not important right now. Back to this little one,” she turned in the chair, brining her knees up and feet on the cushion. She was dressed in a slim black dress, neckline down so low John was surprised her breasts weren’t popping out completely. She was barefoot, with her matching black high heels on the floor next to John’s chair. He didn’t want her bare feet on his chair. She looked exactly the same as she did almost five years ago, not a line on her face, which made a bubble of resentment form in his stomach.
That shut Sherlock up. He swallowed.. “But that doesn’t matter,” he mumbled, looking all over John’s face again, “I made you cry. I couldn’t do it and that made you upset.” The frenzied rhythm to his speech stopped, and he pulled in a suspiciously shaky breath, brow furrowing, looking guilty. “John, I’m sorry. I’m sorry for everything,” his face crumpled. “I’m making everything worse and I’m making you angrier and I don’t know how to stop. My mind,” he put his hands on his head, “it
They went back up to the flat in silence, and it felt like someone was grinding Sherlock’s skull at the center of his forehead, the aggravation from Mary giving him an intense headache. He wanted ibuprofen. They got inside, and John took off his coat and shoes and went straight to the kitchen. Sherlock thought he was going to make tea, but instead, he got a bottle of beer from the fridge.
John’s soft smile widened. “I love you, too. You look tired.”
“Okay.”
Then, it all came crashing to John, and he realized his final error. He hadn’t seen everything Sherlock had done for him. When they first met, Sherlock had taken an interest in him and cured his limp. Then, he gave him a life of adventure until he sacrificed himself by jumping off a building. John didn’t know the details, but he knew Sherlock’s two years away were no walk through the park. He put himself through pain in order to keep him safe. Then, he came back, only to discover John had moved on, but helped plan his wedding, got shot and almost died, and tried to justify Mary’s actions in order to save their marriage. Then, he worked with John to track Mary down and confront her. Finally, he put himself through absolute hell to simply get John to talk to him again. He did so much for him, and it couldn’t have been out of sheer friendship. The revelation wasn’t shocking; in fact, everything clicked into place. Sherlock always had a heart. John never fully saw it because he never believed
She chewed with her mouth open, staring at him with interested, but still sleepy blue eyes.
“Say what enough?”
“I’m kidding,” he smiled lightly.
“Well, what do you want to do, John?” she asked.
“Oof,” John giggled. “All right, my blushing sloth, I’ll stop teasing you.”
A large part of Sherlock wanted to throw away the pretense and confess now. But, no. It was too soon. John still wasn’t sure what to make of his suitor’s actions. Sherlock wanted John to want his secret admirer.  “What do you want to do?” he asked carefully. “This is your life, John.”
This feeling hadn’t come out of nowhere--in fact, it had been building up for quite some time, and he knew it. If he had to sit and really think about it, then he would say he started hating his life after he found out Mary shot Sherlock, but he wasn’t exactly happy before then, either. John didn’t think he had been truly happy since before Sherlock fell.
“Wait,” Lestrade put his hand up in exasperation, “how did you--?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“As soon as I came back,” he said. “My hair was down to my shoulders. It was dreadful.”
Mycroft’s face was grim, but his tone had its usual oily smugness. “Well, you’ve had a busy week, haven’t you, Dr. Watson?”
“Well, that’s not hard to believe.” He cleared his throat. “Erm, well, definitely by...you know, the Moriarty thing. Um, I think the Woman was when I realized it was love. Thought it was just attraction before.”
Sherlock’s eyes widened again. “You think I’m lying?” his voice grew high on the last word. “Reasonable, but please believe me--”
“I have superb hair care routines,” Sherlock said from under the towel. “Although, there are no dead ends right now, which isn’t always the case. I got a haircut recently.”
Sherlock took a deep breath. If he were going to get anywhere with John, he had to dig deeper. “You’re unhappy,” he said softly. “If this is giving you some sort of happiness, then is it not worth pursuing?”
“I’m not your servant,” Mycroft had told Sherlock over the phone.
He couldn’t bring himself to talk about Rosie, or the strange feeling he got from this dream in particular. It didn’t make sense, but Sherlock had no idea who she was. He couldn’t say a random baby popped into the picture, because that wouldn’t justify his sadness.
John smirked. “Yeah, see? Whatever argument you were trying to make was bollocks.”
Sherlock swallowed, looking even more of uncertain of himself than back at the restaurant. “You left this,” he held out John’s coat. His voice was rough. “You left in a hurry. I figured you’d want it.”
are you on about?” he asked, completely baffled. “Are you actually serious?”
Sherlock’s skin broke out in gooseflesh with the sheer effort to control his indignation. His balled fist shook with suppressed rage. “My place? I’m a grown man, I have no place. Also, I am
I enjoy making them sad.
“Unbearably so,” Sherlock said dramatically.
Sherlock was hurt by her. “It really is okay to admit she hurt you,” John said gently. “Even if you two weren’t romantically involved, her betrayal must have stung. I thought it did at the time, but for the wrong reasons, apparently.” It was just on a human level, then, it was almost sadder.
“No, no, no,” John shushed him, voice hoarse, but soft. “I’m sorry you went through all of that, but I want to make things right.”
He let out a quivering sigh. “Well, erm. Okay. It was never easy, you know. Accepting that I like men." He might as well talk about this now, he supposed. He had nothing to lose.
Sherlock looked down, and realized his laughter hadn’t diminished his partial erection. He looked at John, and didn’t see a bulge. Oh. It was just him.
“Someone who’s not in this country and not important,” Sherlock said, monotone.
John turned his head and looked at the fire. “Mary and I had an argument.”
John didn’t meet his gaze. “What I said to you in this flat, about you not--being cut out for a relationship. That hurt you, didn’t it?”
Sherlock scratched his stubble. “I suppose I can't call Lestrade for a ca--”
“Yes,” John said gruffly, standing up and shoving his hands into his pockets. “Yeah, that, um, that would be good.”
That, at least, made his eyes light up with interest. “He did? He hasn’t spoken about them since he was a child.”
“It’s late,” John murmured, “or, rather, extremely early. You’re home and you should rest. You need to heal.”
A voice in John’s head asked,
John’s smile dropped and he flushed.
Sherlock lowered his hand with his phone slowly, eyes skeptical. “Two years have passed, and you’re still relentlessly invasive into my personal affairs.”
Sherlock’s eyes closed briefly. “I’m sorry,” he said again. “I don’t know how many times I could say it.”
“Lift up so we can get these off all the way,” John whispered in his ear, “and I’ll make you feel so good.”
?” John asked incredulously. “You’re fucking
John felt himself getting angry, but swallowed it down. He didn’t want to snap at Mrs. Hudson. “Maybe I didn’t want to take advantage of
Sherlock closed his eyes, willing the negative thoughts away. “No need to be sorry,” he whispered back.
“Now that that’s over, I really will ignore Mycroft’s requests for a few days,” Sherlock stated, taking off his shoes after they went upstairs. “I already told him that in exchange for my help on this case, he has to take my parents to see
John nodded. “Thanks,” he muttered, vaguely aware that he was being kind of a dick right now, but he could focus on nothing else but the sting of betrayal in his chest. “What about Molly and Mrs. Hudson?”
“That’s why you have no coat or shoes.”
He knew a man weren’t supposed to act like this, like his life was over because of a broken heart, but John was so
“You like mine.”
They pulled back, but kept their arms locked around each other. Sherlock’s eyes were soft and his lips looked deliciously pink and plump. John didn’t know what to do. He loved him so much, and they just had a much-needed conversation, but did this was the final barrier between them, and he still didn’t know how Sherlock felt about him.
Sherlock wanted to throttle Mycroft. He wanted to sink into the floor. “Yes,” he croaked.
He scrunched up his nose. “No, thank you.”
While waiting for him to finish, John thought of the phone chime earlier. “You want to check your phone?”
“And what did she say?” he crossed his arms.
Sherlock looked up, his eyes and lips swollen and cheeks bright red and shining from tears. John didn’t think he ever saw Sherlock quite like this, and it was one of the most heartbreaking things he’d ever witnessed. “Please stop crying,” John pleaded. “I don’t want to have this conversation when you’re high--”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Just checking in on you, Dr. Watson. I wanted to see how you were feeling after your surgery.”
“Yes! Jim is like that. But it’s worse, much worse… I cannot bond with him. Do you understand? He will torture me.”
“My place isn’t far.” Shane said. “Come home with me, John.”
“I don’t know!” Dr. Mahon said. “She’s just gone!”
-until the next black eye comes along. I’m fickle-
"I am." He examined Bob again. "As certain as I am that your wife knows about your mistress."
“Then... let me take you to dinner. It’s the least I can do... to thank you for...”
"What do you want?" John repeated.
He returned to critical care and found Shane lurking nervously in the doorway of John's room.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What is his goal?” I asked.
“That’s fine, Shane.” John supplied. “What do they have in common?” He asked Sherlock. He still wanted to roll into a ball and hide himself away from the world – and he still would – but he felt INTEREST in the case penetrate his shell.
John pulled the sheet free, exposing the pale expanse of his mate’s body, kissing his chest, pushing him down onto his back and climbing atop him. He worried a nipple with his teeth and it hardened in his mouth. John sucked on it, pinching its twin and rolling it between his thumb and forefinger.
They were at a table near the door, people coming in and out. When John went up for another round, the bartender – a petite blonde – was flirty. John noticed, but there was no point in flirting back. She was probably just trying to cheer him up anyway.
I also practiced with the knives. I needed to use them deftly, as if I had been butchering animals since childhood. It was boring. But mistakes in America would not be boring – they would be much too interesting for my taste.
“What do I do? How do I help?” He demanded.
"That wasn't a good thing?"
The past tense felt like a punch in the solar plexus, all the air gone from my lungs in an instant, leaving me gasping.
“You promised you wouldn’t leave me! Sherlock! Don’t leave me!”
John grimaced. “You’ll be sorry you said that.” He thought a moment, ordering his thoughts. “You know most of it. I spent seven years in Afghanistan. After I was shot, it took… six months – no longer – before I fully recovered. Lots of physical therapy. I … getting shot… it’s very isolating. Everything changed. All the people I knew, the familiar places were gone. I was back in London, a civilian. I don’t have family I’m close to. I was really… alone.
“One or two...”
"Mean." Sherlock said and shrugged. "Will you be here tomorrow?"
“Nuh-uh.” Lestrade said, pulling the bottle out of reach. “Eat first.”
"Yeah?" John shook himself. "Sorry, what?"
"He told you that? That he loves you?"
I shrugged. “Didn’t come up.”
“That ain’t just suppressant." The big man growled, his attention back on Sherlock. "You smell
“OK.” I didn’t like the way Sherlock was trembling all of a sudden, the shallowness of every rapid breath.
I don't know why you are different from the other people I have cared about. You simply are. I was never tempted sexually by The Woman, but watching YOU make tea fills me with desire. It's not rational, how much I want make you smile, see you happy. It's not rational how much I desire to touch you, to feel your skin under my fingers...
But I should have been on that roof with him! I should have had his back, protected him from Moriarty! How had I been so stupid?! How had I let him convince me to leave him alone when I knew that maniac was gunning for him!
“Mycroft’s... I guess.” I could feel his heart pounding.
But something wasn’t right. John felt… guilty? Ashamed? What was it?
He had been ignoring the state of his clothing as much as possible, but shedding them was a relief. Lestrade was faintly appalled at the amount of blood staining the soiled fabrics — getting to Baker Street the day before had been harrowing.
John's hand slid around my erection and stroked it slowly, twisting his wrist and smearing the liquid welling from the tip down the shaft. I gasped with pleasure, feeling my prick harden even more. "It's safe." John said. "Trust me. I'm a doctor, yeah."
Moran returned with juice and biscuits. He took the kettle away for water.
Her reply had been non-committal.
“All sorts... find da Vinci’s war machines... sample gelato from as many different places as we could find... buy an orange leather pocketbook and use it to trap pickpockets... take a tour in the Doge and infiltrate into the places tourists aren’t meant to be – extra points for an unused, abandoned area... walk to a certain landmark and find the note Marcas had hidden with only a few clues... pick a tourist and follow him or her all day without them knowing...
Sherlock felt strange standing there with his pants and trousers around his ankles – he didn't want to take his shoes off in case he'd brought glass in on his clothing – not strange as in self-conscious, but the light-headed feeling of standing on a boat in the surf. He thought it must be from John's fingers on his skin.
"For a day, or a week – maybe a month, Sherlock. But a year and a half?! No. It's just cruel."
The man cut off the doctor tersely. "DOCTOR Watson has been kidnapped and tortured. Although why that should make a difference in treatment is beyond me. I've already contacted a specialist..." They walked away and John let himself drift off.
Sherlock moaned and arched. John put a hand on the back of his neck, pushing Sherlock’s face into the bed while he continued to tease Sherlock’s sensitive areas.
Sherlock looked the Alpha over quickly, assessing if he’d missed anything. “I know that you’re in your last year of medical school, currently doing a rotation in the morgue. You grew up in the suburbs of London and you lost your father young – possibly to death but probably to alcohol. He was an Alpha and you didn’t like the example he set. You have a sibling who’s an Omega and you’ve looked out for him your entire life. You’re trained in hand-to-hand combat and you are a marksman. You practice shooting with a handgun regularly. You had coffee and a bacon butty for breakfast and you were on your way to hospital when you scented me. And I know that you are kind and able to suppress your base Alpha instincts long enough to help me escape from the mob my scent caused.”
"There's a fresh needle stick between his toes – left foot." John said. "And in the past two weeks, two other patients – patients who had been in hospital for several days with unrelated illness or injury – have died of GBH poisoning, and both had injection marks in odd places – one between her toes."
She waited for him to say something. When he didn’t, she returned to her work. “I’ll do what I can for the Omegas. They’re good kids.”
“I lay the blame squarely on my father.” Mycroft responded. “He does it purposefully.”
Victor nodded. “I can’t abandon her. It’s just… she’s so much like Afan. Makes it harder.”
“No. Erm, of course.” I said. Drunk or no, his anguish – his guilt – sounded real.
"I'm going to get you more paracetamol and maybe some soup. I won't be gone long. Is there anything you want me to bring you?"
"When did you know?"
It WASN'T me. But I wished it were, it would be easier to get rid of her. Finally I hailed a cab and put her in it – half pretending I was getting in behind her. I leaned in and gave her address to the cabbie, tossed him a £20 note, and shut the door on her. I blessed the man for driving away before she could open it again and try to drag me with her.
“You annoying cock!” John put his head in his hand, hiding his smile.
But, well, maybe he should ask Sherlock about it. He had to be proactive this time, not an emotionally-stifled bystander to his own bloody life.
The cab pulled up to Baker Street. Great, he hadn’t even arrived yet, and he was already in a sour mood. He did that to himself, though, and Sherlock didn’t deserve to be on the receiving end of his bitterness, so he would hide it--at least as much as he could. He paid the cabbie and looked up as he got out of the car. For a second, he saw Sherlock at the window, but in a flash, he was gone. Odd.
“Be safe,” Sherlock said, looking up.
John didn’t look convinced. “You sure you’re okay? Was that fall outside harder than you’re letting on?”
“Nothing, nothing,” he said quickly. “You have to go to work, yes? Well, you should be on your way,” he handed John his toothbrush and grabbed him by the shoulders, spun him around, and led him out of the bathroom. “Don’t want to be late.”
“How?”
“Nothing,” John said.
It was a testament to how tired John was, that he shifted into Sherlock’s lap without a snarky remark, burying his face in the crook of his neck once he was settled. He wrapped his arms around his shoulders.
“What’re they about?” Sherlock asked, turned his head and opening his eyes, which almost looked dark blue from how much his pupils were dilated.
Sherlock's eyes fluttered close, the feather-light feel of John's fingers on his cheek sweeter than he could have ever imagined.
He had to work with John’s trust issues, and considering Sherlock lied about being dead for two years, he understood why John might not trust his intent.
Sherlock nodded curtly. “That’s agreeable.”
“Tomorrow.” His eyes glanced at the clock behind John. “Later today,” he amended.
“Tha.”
John remembered. “I’m sorry for that, like I said. I didn’t know how much that day hurt you.”
Mary was looking at him like he was a lunatic, and she might have been absolutely right.
“I just got lost in thought,” John said unsteadily, wiping his back again with trembling hands. He had treated Sherlock worse than he thought in his own timeline. The lump in his throat made his esophagus ache.
“Of course.”
“John?” Sherlock asked, all attempts at nervous humor gone and replaced with worry. “John, are you ill? Are you going to faint?”
“I’m great,” he said for once in his life. “Listen, I need to talk to Sherlock about something really important right now, and I need you to keep an eye on Rosie for just a little bit. I promise I’ll be back down for her soon, but we seriously need to talk.”
“But it looks like that made you feel more comfortable, hm?” John held his hands and lowered them.
“The Woman was chiming in and attempting to solve the case herself,” he grumbled, typing on his laptop. His curls were falling over his eyebrows, uncombed, and he was in his red dressing gown.
“I love John,” his voice shook.
John threw the empty yogurt container in the recyclables and sat back down at the table.
Sooooooo what do you think? I have an idea where this story is going to go, but as always, feedback is invaluable to me :)
John snorted. “Git.” Although it was a joke, truth be told, John was beginning to feel more like himself. They got under the sheets and blanket, and met in the middle of the mattress, hugging. John didn’t think he ever enjoyed hugging someone as much as he loved hugging Sherlock. He was solid and warm under his T-shirt, chest and shoulders more muscular than they appeared. They shifted around a little bit until Sherlock was on his back, arms around John, and John’s nose was buried in the curls by Sherlock’s ear. John only had one pillow, so they had to share, but it was an excuse to be close, so neither complained. John placed his hand on Sherlock’s chest, kissing the soft curls in front of his face and inhaling the sweet-smelling shampoo. The tension in his muscles was melting away, and John didn’t think he felt this relaxed since before Sherlock jumped. It was better now, though.
Rosie responded to his good mood with a smile of her own. “Dada,” she flopped a small hand onto his face.
Sherlock wanted to reach out to him. They were “married”, so he could do that now. He put his hand over John’s.
John took a deep breath. He leaned forward, tilting his head to the side, and stopped just before their lips touched, feeling his warm breath on his face. Then, his eyes fluttered shut and he slowly pressed their lips together. Sherlock’s lips were soft and plush. John opened his mouth slightly and Sherlock inhaled sharply. He unfolded his arms and wrapped them around John’s neck, clinging to him, kissing back as best as he could. He was unpracticed, but in no way a bad kisser. He was gentle. John pulled back, placed a firm kiss on his lips, and moved back again with a small
“Mrs. Hudson is perfectly capable,” Sherlock said. “She has assured us that it’s more than fine.” That was true, because in a relationship or not, John still needed a babysitter for Rosie when on cases and they’d had to have that conversation.
Sherlock jerked beneath him and John immediately lifted his head. “Are you okay?”
Sherlock remained awake for the next seven hours. The anticipation for tomorrow was keeping his brain active, but it was tainted by the constant thorn of guilt in his side.
John changed her nappy and sat with her as she munched on dry cereal in her height chair. He wanted to go see Sherlock, but he needed to spend time with her. While she ate, John got his phone, and the date was 8th February 2017. It was about a month after Sherlock’s birthday, after the incident with Culverton.
“When we get in,” John said as they were two steps away from the door, “you really need morphine.”
“After all the times I sat and listened to you cry about him,” she said in repulsion.
“Goodbye, John,” he smiled in what he suspected was a manic manner.
“Oh, she’s such a dear,” Mrs. Hudson chuckled. “Do you want her to have cake first, or open her presents?”
“Don’t swear in front of the baby,” Sherlock scolded. “She’s beginning to acquire language.”
Having gone to sleep right after sex, neither of them had bathed the night before. Sherlock took a shower first, standing under the warm stream and getting lost in thought. It was weird to think that he walked in on John and Mary just over a week ago. He thought that time was a strange thing; John and Mary hadn’t even been married for a full year, and yet Sherlock felt like this was one of the longest periods of his life (the section of his life that had felt the longest was when he was away, but he preferred not to think about that). When his bar of soap slipped out of his hand, he snapped out of his thoughts and finished washing. He didn’t bother wrapping a towel around his waist when he left the bathroom and told John, “Shower’s free.”
Sherlock’s lips trembled, and he blinked helplessly. “I’m not--” His words stopped dead in his throat.
John giggled. “You’re right about that. It’s not too late for us, is it?”
“I’m sure I look different now, too.”
There was a pause.
his fatigued mind supplied.
They didn’t mention John’s humping episode for the rest of the day, and blushed every time they made eye contact. Thankfully, Rosie distracted them both sufficiently enough, John thought it would have been indecent to think about humping Sherlock with his baby girl around, and as a result he was able to stay in the same room with Sherlock without dying from embarrassment.
John grimaced. But, this...this news didn’t put him at ease, for some reason. “So, she’s locked up?” John asked. “No way of getting out?”
“Lovely,” Culverton marvelled. “Just lovely.”
him right now. “You were nearly fucking dying to begin with! What inspired you in that massive fucking brain of yours to put your heart at more risk? Need I remind you that you
John pulled back and caressed Sherlock’s hair.
“I thought you wouldn’t shut up, even in sleep,” he laughed.
“All I did was give you a blow job.”
“It’ll be less of a hassle,” he said.
Still, there were things he wanted to know. John felt like he could not truly begin to move on if he didn’t know everything. “Sherlock, can I ask you some things?”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “You can’t lie to me. You’re thinking of your dreams.”
Sherlock gulped and looked away. “If you start, I’ll start,” he said.
“How are you?” John asked.
The next day left Sherlock in a slightly sour mood, growing irritated with his injury. John knew how that felt. He remembered the long months after his shoulder wound, sometimes asking why the hell he wasn’t getting better sooner, even though, medically, he knew he was healing as quickly as he could have. He told Sherlock that he was healing just fine, but understandably, that didn’t do much to improve his mood. John, on the other hand, felt a ball of anxiety tingling in his chest. He wanted to get his mind off Mary. He’d slept in Sherlock’s bed with one eye open last night, and he was tired, and wanted to kiss him.
John started laughing, feeling the stress fade away from his body. He got in his side of the bed, putting his head on Sherlock’s warm, bare shoulder. He let out a deep breath. “She’ll never think she’s wrong, no matter what.”
John nodded – though Sherlock could still feel his guilt – and poured shampoo in his hand. He began to massage Sherlock’s scalp with it, working it into a lather as Sherlock moaned his appreciation. He didn’t even care that the shampoo smelled cheap, as long as John kept touching him that way.
"Excellent!" I left her dialing Owen Hughes and made my way downstairs. I found the butler's parlour easily – it appeared it was used as an office for the household staff. I had several calls to make before speaking to Owen Hughes.
**John's consciousness swam up to the surface, to the barrier between sleep and wakefulness. He wanted to dive back down into oblivion. But reaching the surface prevented it.**
"Two weeks." I told Mycroft. "You'll have it all in order?"
“I can’t lose you, John.” Sherlock whispered. “Not again.”
"Look, they're chopping my hand off tomorrow. Leave us alone! Get out!" John didn't yell – he rarely yelled – but his intense, dangerous tone got his point across better than volume ever would.
“Maybe you should sleep with him.  A bit of hate-sex is good for the soul.”
"That's... that's a lot of assumptions."
Shane was bright red, his eyes dilated, his trousers tented lewdly. After a beat, he stood so abruptly the chair tipped over and clattered loudly to the floor. Shane didn't turn, he walked away from the door to the far wall and leaned against it, trying to recover himself with a modicum of privacy.
"I want you." Shane murmured, sliding his tongue  over the glans. "Will you fuck me, John?"
Moran nodded and disappeared.
John had been seeing Shane for four months now. They were still in the 'honeymoon' phase where they shagged all the time and smiled at each other a lot. John didn't know how long it would last, but he was enjoying the relationship a lot. Nothing would ever rival the thrill of living and working with Sherlock, but NOT being kidnapped and threatened with death for a while was seriously OK with John. He was ready for a quieter life.
"A bit."
Walter was waiting for me - the obligatory exit interview. I dreaded it.
“What do you want?” I asked.
“All right, shut up.” John had released my ankle and I felt bereft. But he levered himself forward out of the legless chair and crawled the meter and a half between us. “Just shut up.” He cupped my face and I clenched my eyes closed to stop the humiliating tears from falling. “I WANT to be here with you, Sherlock. I LOVE you. So just shut up about all that shite.” He kissed my face, his lips firm. “I am exactly where I want to be.” His arms encircled me and I found myself cradled against his strong chest. “Now tell me what’s wrong, my love.”
“Is this why you’ve been acting so strangely? Is this what’s been bringing you down?”
As soon as the door shut. John crumpled. He sat on the floor in the hall – right where he and Sherlock had stood and laughed together that first night – his head in his hands.
He settled slowly, the cool water soothing him, but he was still upset, I could tell. "You'll feel better soon." I told him.
Even if John hadn’t been bonded, this wasn’t the sort of place he’d ever enjoyed. But now… John couldn’t even imagine wanting anyone other than his bondmate. Was it some chemical component of the bond affecting his libido? Was it a function of the empathetic link? Had he simply fallen that in love with Sherlock Holmes? John didn’t know. But it was taking all his acting skill to show enthusiasm for the exotic Beta dancers.
“Shane.” Jason indicated the man who had helped John. Shane was thinner than Jason, lean and rawboned. He had shaggy brown hair and brown eyes and he would never be the man who was noticed first. Or second. But John liked the intelligence sparkling in his eyes. “You’re military?” Jason asked.
John made a small, helpless gesture. "People always want to tell me what they think – he was a fake, they always believed in him, whatever. It's hard enough to talk about it without all that...." John felt the familiar prick of tears and for a second he felt humiliated, but then Shane's arms were around him and his tears were OK.
Sherlock was in the black saloon car that waited for me behind the restaurant. Relieved to see him safe, I pulled him gently into my arms (ignoring the way he flinched) and kissed him.
“What have I done that’s so bloody stimulating?”
- physical fitness/sports
“Yes.”
“So... Jones cheated?”
When one’s soulmate turned, the soulmark on the uninfected partner didn’t dissolve, it disappear leaving nought but despair in its wake, as when one partner died.
In other news, John meets Mary Morstan!
Shane stayed another hour then kissed John goodnight. "I'll miss you tonight." He said.
I was pleased. I got to work, tonguing the knot of muscle at his entrance. He moaned as my tongue penetrated. I fucked him with my tongue, caressing his bollocks and perineum, running my knuckles up the shaft of his rock-hard cock, fingering the metal ring that pierced the head.
“S’pose it’s to do wi’ the girl.”
John watched his Omega don his coat with a dramatic swirl. Sherlock looked at him briefly with burning eyes, then ran out of the flat, down the stairs and through the street door.
“No.” I agreed. “But you do.” I wouldn’t fuss over him, but I hoped he would eat. He needed to eat.
"Here? In the woods?" He asked.
“I’m really missing out, is what you’re saying.”
“Fine.” I said, calculating instantly that a hit of heroin cost £4.45 here, and slouched out of our cell. I idly wondered how many deliveries I’d have to make to earn £4.45.
Sherlock gasped as I took him in my mouth again. “Yes, John!” He moaned. “Oh! Yessss, Johnnnn....”
John was alive. Sherlock sensed his wildly careening dreams – they played out in his mind, more real than his own discomfort, than the chill that invaded his core... his father was drunk. John's father was always drunk. He screamed at John... Alphas came to the house, strange Alphas. Arrogant Alphas. John had presented less than a year before and these Alphas invaded his territory! John faced them steely-eyed... His father shouted at him – John was little again, just a child – "You stupid little shite! Good for nothing shite!" He hit John, backhanded him to the floor. John was only six, but he fought back and his father punched him in the gut. He lay on the kitchen floor gasping desperately for air... Molly, tiny and young, struggling against the strange Alphas, she bit one, drawing blood. John tried to help her, but the strange Alphas held him back. He struggled and fought with all his might... but he could not get free... Molly with blonde hair and John’s blue eyes, battered and slack, with a leather contraption strapped around her neck and upper arms... an army of Mollies all battered and slack, cringing from John’s helping hand. Never good enough... "Good for nothing little shite!...
Sherlock indicated he should be quiet and turned the telly on loud. "The flat may be bugged." He said through the ginger whiskers. He approached John's laptop carefully, putting a strip of masking tape over the camera before he turned it towards him.
"You're sending me away with him." Sherlock observed sourly.
“Clumsy.”
That hit me hard – the pain crashing through me. Agony hollowing me out. I bowed my head trying to contain my grief. “We were together.” I managed. “The last few months. We didn’t tell anyone because Sherlock was convinced Moriarty would target me if he found out.” My grief turned to anger in a moment. “Moriarty! He’s to blame for all of this! And the clerk proves it! He had this planned out! Forcing Sherlock to jump, that’s murder! You can arrest him...”
John and Sherlock unmask the killer!
“Go away, Mycroft.” It was Sherlock’s voice!
Then Moriarty ‘rescued’ her – he built her a new personality, molded her into an extension of himself, someone who would follow his orders without question. Someone who would let him hit her, fuck her, cut off her fingers and then thank him for it. She would kill for him without hesitation. She HAS killed for him.
right there.” He waved his hand at Mycroft’s prick.
Sherlock unbuckled his belt and slid his trousers down carefully.
She looked well – more angry than fearful. Mrs. Hudson was made of strong stuff – she was ready to act when John or I struck. I took a step towards them. “The question stands, Ms. Morstan – what are you doing?”
“Are you saying that you’ll forget me?” John asked.
It had been a study of misery – my own.
"This will feel strange." John warned, and Sherlock felt something moving, crawling up his airway, scraping against his interior walls. It hurt! He tried not to scream – but it only came out as a moan anyway. "Almost there." John said. Sherlock gagged on the thing, choked and retched and then it was gone from his body, but Sherlock couldn't stop heaving. He tasted vomit and thought sadly that it was the thing with the peas. It seemed wrong his body should reject the thing with the peas.
“Yes, it’s me, love. I‘ve got you.” John’s lips against my neck. “I’ve got you.”
The room was indelibly linked in his mind with Mummy. He didn’t think he’d
“After he was dead,” She shot a loathing glance my way. “I was your salvation. You should have been an easy conquest. You should have fallen into my arms, grabbed onto me like your life depended on it – because it would have if your grief had been real.
"John...?"
“John, please... I WANT you with me. Obvious! Too obvious – nothing would alert Moriarty’s people faster. They’d see us coming. They’d kill us both. I... I can’t have that. You have to be safe.”
"But now you have something."
I gave him my arm as we left the bakery, Sherlock wrapped once more in the white parka. He leaned on me as we made our way back and it worried me. His pride wouldn’t allow him to show weakness unless he absolutely couldn’t help it. He was almost frail. I was happy he’d eaten the pastry, but he needed so much more! With difficulty I suppressed the impulse to fret and fuss and harangue him to eat more. He knew...
“I never did get the information about where Magnussen kept his trove. But I’d researched him, cased his offices and his flat. I was convinced that he had to be keeping everything at his estate in rural Connecticut. I went out there and broke in one night – the security was perfunctory at best. I thought it would be a quick in and out – if the information was on a computer, I could download it. If it was on paper, I could have Mycroft arrange a team to swoop in and take it before daylight.
“No, no, you’re right. I know Sherlock wasn’t a fraud.”
Shane's arms closed around him – he was so strong! – and with a shift, he turned them on their sides with John pinned against the back of the sofa. They lay there, hands moving and gripping and caressing, kissing and licking and nipping, grinding against each other until Shane reached down and started to unfasten John’s jeans.
John brushed Shane's long fringe to the side, his fingers lingering. Shane leaned into his touch. John pulled him close ...then Shane was in his arms – or he was in Shane's arms – and they were kissing.
Dr. Moon gave John an ice pack and helped him settle it gently against his abused manhood. They talked in low tones for another minute or so, then the doctor covered John up again, made notes on John's chart and left.
Sherlock nodded, and John eased off the man, making a face at the smell. If he had a personal scent, it was hidden under layers and layers of unwashed rags.
Angus sighed impatiently. "I DO have work – John might be my favorite patient, but there are eight others..."
John wanted to answer, but the water rushed up and closed over his face, entombing him in heavy blackness...
“Oh.” Sherlock’s feet were cold, the cement floor under the lino leeching the heat from his body. The adrenaline was gone and Sherlock was crashing hard. He wanted to curl up on the floor and sleep. He tried to listen to Shane describing how Church had cornered them in the lift.
“Yeah, of course, Doctor. What is it?” John worked hard to keep the annoyance from his voice.
“I smelled coffee and bacon on your breath and you had crumbs on the shoulder of your jumper – bacon butty, obvious.
I licked my lips. “You’re the first person I’ve met that Sherlock has had a physical relationship with.” I admitted. “Until now, I thought he was asexual.” I remembered the prescription of PrEP in the linen closet. “Or, I don’t know, kept his sex life extremely private.”
“Taken care of.” Mycroft said.
“I said fine!”
"What happened here?!" John's distress and anger penetrated, he had my attention. "When I left, this kitchen was clean."
I wanted to pull him into my arms, kiss his face a thousand times, tell him that Victor was nothing to me, tell him how much I loved him...
He didn’t have to – Coach repeated the praise to Dad, telling him how well John was coming along. John glowed happily… then listened in astonishment as his Dad mocked the Coach. He pretended it was a joke, laughing heartily. Coach looked sour. But Betas instinctually try to appease Alphas. John listened to Coach agree that it was a good joke and
He caught up to his bondmate at the rusted hull of the derelict barge. It was unclear if the barge was part of the tip or if it had simply pulled up one day to take garbage downriver and been subsumed.
It's update Wednesday! I've been so excited about this that I almost posted it several times this past week.
“Of course.”
“Medical tent?” Sherlock asked. “What sort of medicine?”
“Why strange?”
“But your pills.”
Using the momentum of her punch, John twisted her arm over his back, throwing her to the floor. She landed hard, the breath knocked out of her – that gave John the second he needed. He kicked her in the head before she could start to get up and she dropped with a moan. He stomped and kicked her over and over and over until he felt her skull turn soft under his boot.
Sherlock had a long afternoon of tests and scans – before they'd even let him wash up.
A meter from the trail, the cliff’s edge ended abruptly with a thigh height stone lip. On a clear day, the ocean would be beautiful. Today, it was treacherous, lightning still flashing in distant clouds.
ARE we together? IS he mine? Are we a couple? Are we everything John has always denied that we ever could be?
I felt limp with relief. I let Sherlock hold me – hold me upright as much as anything. My hunger had fled, the thought of my fried breakfast turned my stomach.
“Go away, Mycroft.” Sherlock said. His brother wasn’t trying to take him now, but he had an agenda – Mycroft always had an agenda.
“Believe it or not, we did consider that.” Sherlock told him. “We took it to the professors on Moriarty’s dissertation committee. As they understand the theorem – and these are some of the best maths minds in the country – we were applying it correctly and it
Mycroft regarded me for a long moment. Then he nodded. “I’ll have a comfortable chair brought for you.” He said. “And a charger for your phone. You have my number if you need me – and Fielding is here if you need anything else.” He gestured at the guard who nodded solemnly. Mycroft stood up and rubbed his eyes tiredly “I mean that, John – if you need food or a change of clothes or even a cup of tea, do not hesitate to tell Fielding, he’ll arrange it. I’ll be back in a few hours. Hopefully by then...” He looked significantly at Sherlock’s closed door.
"You don't have to stop." John said. "It's beautiful."
Except I was more than ready for Sherlock to be home! I was sick to death of waiting. Sick of doing nothing. I felt useless.
"How does he know?"
I stopped myself, more than once, from blurting it all out to Lestrade. “John loves me and we’re together now!” sat at the tip of my tongue aching for release. I swallowed it.
Sherlock handed him the tube with a baleful look and allowed him to spread the ointment inside of his arse, ostentatiously ignoring the bubbling amusement and lewd images that traveled through their empathetic link.
Jason shook John's hand heartily. "You remember Jane." He said, touching the woman at his side.
“Promise me, Sherlock, promise me that IF Moriarty is somehow set free, we will deal with him together.”
. The upbeat disco echoed loudly now…
“What’s up?” John asked when we had gotten to our flat. “You’re out of sorts – everything ok?” He laid his hand on the back of my neck lightly – he did that sometimes, a gesture of affection that reminded me of when he pulled me into a kiss. It was supposed to, I guessed.
Movement in the corner of his eye. Immediately on guard, Lestrade scanned the fire escape, the windows in the building adjacent, the roofline over their heads — there! A CCTV camera was turning towards them. Lestrade waved.
“You’re staying here.” John asked flatly.
“I know you blame me. Mycroft blames me too. And you’re right, it was my fault. I can’t undo it, much as I’d like to."
“Tell me about him.” Mary said one night after a few drinks, touching my hand. Possibly we’d had a few too many drinks. “Tell me about your Sherlock.”
“Oh.” I said. “Mary...” She winced, realising the transparency of her feelings, and turned away into her drink.
Sherlock followed Shane up the stairs to the third floor and took in his surroundings.
"It's obvious. It's even obvious to you."
Sherlock exploded from 221 Baker Street when the cab pulled up. He had the taxi’s door open almost before it stopped. Mrs. Hudson was right behind him, ready to fuss over John. He could resist Shane's and Sherlock’s fussing, but he had to let Mrs. Hudson cluck over him, at least for a while.
He snorted with delight. “It’s ALL English.”
“No... I wanted... it has to be now.”
He bit my neck and I moaned involuntarily. "I bet you wouldn't mind fucking me either." John whispered. "I bet that big cock ring would hit my prostate just right."
"It's just me." Shane said softly. "They've gone."
Update Wednesday!!!
"Maybe we should hold a gun on them?" John's helper suggested. "Easier to keep them down."
But I was talking about John... though his patience and decency have always been impressive, he has a temper.
“That’s why they like me.” John had told him. “I’m safe. Despite everything, they have romantic notions about bonding. You should talk to them. Teach them how to choose the
“Nurse. I don’t want any visitors. No one – not my brother, not Dr. Watson. I want to be alone.”
John looked up and surveyed the two men. “What am I missing?” He asked. Through their link, John felt a complex flutter of emotion from his Omega: irritation, hope, fondness... brotherhood...? Sherlock felt a kinship with Lestrade? Well, they were both detectives...
Oh well, it wouldn’t kill him in the next few days. John wasn’t 100% certain what would happen when Sherlock’s heat ended, and they ventured out of the abandoned building, but a bath was at the top of his list. Perhaps he’d call Bart’s from the bathtub to arrange the belated leave of absence. It wasn’t usual to stumble into a bond like this, but it wasn’t unheard of either. His instructors would understand.
It was Saturday. John had nothing on. If Shane wanted to work on his book, John would go home and do his own thing. He'd go running then maybe to the shooting range and the Tesco. If Shane wasn't working on his book, John would stay. They might go to the gym together and then get brunch. They might stay in and fuck again.
When Sherlock’s shudders slowed, and his limbs lay heavily against the bed. John licked his mate’s cock clean, then heaved himself up to kiss his beautiful Omega, careful that the fabric of his clothing not chafe his mate’s lovely skin.
"No." He was still by the window but he'd turned and was regarding the body on the couch.
“Where were you deployed?” Jason asked.
“Lestrade has Mary under surveillance? That should lead directly to him.“ Sherlock ate more of the strudel.
“Oh, yes, please!” Sherlock said scrambling to reverse himself on the bed, so he could assume the position.
“What does it
“I have skag for you. Not a lot, but it will help.”
Sherlock was either deep in thought or sulking epically. "Leave him alone." John said to Shane.
“Greg!” Mycroft begged. “Greg…”
Maybe, if he were allowed to leave here alive, he'd write about her. Would she allow it? Would she cooperate, telling him stories of past exploits that he could lightly fictionalize... it would be a sensational book.
“They must have met – Shane and Sherlock. I can’t imagine Sherlock staying away when you’re in hospital.”
"You're distracted now."
The elder Holmes brother crossed the kitchen to stand near Lestrade. They both watched Rosie ripping paper off her present, John helping and Sherlock beaming at them both.
“How!?” I’d thought, completely off-guard. “How can JOHN be Moriarty? How can John be my enemy? A criminal mastermind?! A murderer!? I LOVE HIM!”
“Yeah?”
He didn’t make the mistake of thinking that he’d fooled Jim Moriarty. Sherlock waited until almost 3 a.m. before putting on his best disguise – old jeans and a canvas coat he’d cadged from an assistant gardener three years ago – and dousing himself in scent suppressant. He went out the window as he had so often when he was a teenager and climbed silently to the ground. Sherlock hiked several acres through the countryside before risking the road – he didn’t dare go for the train station, that would be the first place Mummy and Mycroft would look. Instead he hitched a ride on an early morning lorry, telling the not-overly-bright beta driver a story about going to see a sibling in London. He used an eastern European accent to cover his posh tones.
"Barley ok?" He called from the kitchen.
I sighed again. “I think I told you... I wasn’t looking for anything like this because I was still hung up on someone else... you said you understood.”
That appeared to be the cause of death – GBH overdose. GBH wasn’t just a ‘date rape’ drug used to incapacitate unsuspecting women, it was also a gay party drug used in clubs and in private ‘chemsex’ parties. Like methamphetamine, GBH – taken in small amounts – reduced inhibitions and heightened libido. The difference between an intoxicating dose and a lethal dose was quite small, so GBH deaths weren’t uncommon. It had even been the weapon of choice of a serial killer a few years ago.
John plucked at the collar of Sherlock’s shirt. “Take this off, yeah?” He said. “I want to see you.”
“There’s nothing like a good cup of tea.” She said. “John… what happened? You don’t have to say if you don’t want to…”
“No, you were fine.” I said.
— John! Thank god! I didn’t know what to think. I hope everything is ok now. —
"But…"
That was true. John couldn’t refute it. “It’s complicated.” He mumbled.
“I have a line on a flat.” Sherlock said.
“New car?” I asked as I clicked my seatbelt closed.
He laid John out and took the opportunity to hastily rub John’s hands in an attempt to promote blood flow. He avoided looking at John’s swollen and bruised sex organs. Sherlock knew exactly what had happened the moment he saw them. He put it out of his mind.
There I met up with Harry.
“You won’t be disappointed. Jim wasn’t.”
"Did you eat today?" He asked, hand wandering up my shin.
“A couple things.” Anwen said, leaning against the desk. “The biggest is that Vic isn’t even mentioned. The will my father showed me, Vic was provided for – not lavishly, but not modestly either. Enough for him to live on if he chose.”
Sherlock’s irises expanded until his eyes were dead black and full of dread. “I know.” He said.
"You're going to see him again." It was a statement.
He had pulled out the single cold case of Lestrade's that he hadn't been able to solve from his hospital bed. Sherlock needed to reconnoiter the crime scene to prove one way or the other if the sister had done it. That is what he would do tonight, dinner wasn't on his radar.
John still had bruises all over his legs, faded now to sickly yellows and greens with a few dark purple spots. His abrasions were mostly healed, only the worst still scabbed over. The purple-black of the subcutaneous bleeding from his wounded testicles still stretched down the insides of his thighs, but it was beginning to break up and fade at the edges.
"No, absolutely not. I hate everything about it."
“Then I heard her. There were the remains of a goat – or maybe several – around the mouth of the drain and I realized that she was nearby – tigers sleep near their prey to keep scavengers away. I had the rifle up to my eye in a second. I didn’t dare move, but I scanned the area slowly. She was there, not ten feet away, looking at me. She crouched and I knew she was preparing to spring. I fired and she dropped. I’d gotten her right between the eyes – she didn’t feel a thing.”
"Sorry – forgot you were bent too." He mumbled.
"John…"
“They what?” I felt an unexpected wave of anger.
Sherlock has been abducted!
“Good point.” (I HADN’T wanted to go out with Moran – it had been an attempt to deliver him into the hands of the police.) “Maybe that’s why – thinking about Sherlock is too hard. I like that Seb’s different. He’s former military, like me, I thought we could have something in common. And he’s... charming.” I shook my head. “I fucked that up massively... I should have known – I did know! I just thought... it’s been years, yeah. It’s time to get on with it.” I grimaced. “I want to get on with it.” I sighed and squeezed Mary’s hand. “I’ll start making calls in the morning, reach out to some old friends in the army, see what I can find out. Seb has to be somewhere.”
Sherlock took hold of the weapon, but John didn’t let go right away. He pulled his mate close and kissed him. “Be careful.” He said. “If anything happens to you...”
I felt a deep-seated lust – it didn’t extend to my prick, it was way too soon. But the image of John kneeling at my feet PRACTICING his cocksucking ... I shuddered in purely intellectual orgasmic delight.
“Not yet.”
I pushed him back onto the bed, wishing again I couldn't smell the perfume on him. "Not tonight." I said, my stomach churning. I felt deeply ambivalent, wanting him desperately yet repulsed at the same time. I left quickly.
“John.” He rubbed my back, helped calm my heaving stomach.
“Sherlock never deferred to me.” I protested.
Reorienting us lengthwise on the bed, Sherlock, laughing, let me lower him down onto his back. I kissed him again, joy coursing through me as powerful as my desire. His hands roamed over my biceps, my delts, lingering on the scar the bullet left on my back. Sherlock smirked appreciatively at the flex of my shoulders as I braced myself over him. His hands found my hair and pulled me down to kiss him again and again until I pulled away, giggling a little at his moue of discontent.
I was stunned – and suddenly completely exhausted. “I don’t need an OBE, Mycroft.” I said. “I just want to see Sherlock.”
John felt a sting on his buttock – an intense, painful sting – and he cried out again before he could stop himself.
“Why?” I asked. I set down my fork. “You’re hardly closeted.... or ARE you? Is it so important that people think you’re asexual?” I was confused and surprised.
He opened the case and picked up the instrument. He'd played a little when John was in hospital, mostly to discover if he needed to rehair the bow or change any strings. Now he tightened the bow and brought the violin to his shoulder and plucked the strings, tuning the instrument. This was part of what Sherlock loved about the violin – the rituals. When he was satisfied he stood up straight and brought his bow to bear.... then hesitated.
“Maybe we could lie side-to-side…” John began.
“Vic and the boys are around somewhere.” She said. “They’ll be at dinner. Do you want to settle into your rooms...?”
“Excellent. Sign here. And here.” I heard papers and the scratching of a pen.
At home in their flat, John relaxed.
Now I discover that John had been thinking of his girlfriend the entire time.
"Stop." John said, the pain in his voice heartbreaking. He turned away.
“What do they do?”
We walked slowly to the bakery, holding hands. I steered him to a table by the fireplace – he was tiring rapidly, his stamina stolen by injury and recuperation. “Sit.” I said. “I’ll get the tea.”
“I observed.” Sherlock said. “You were wearing scrubs – the top – under your jumper and your hands smelled slightly of formaldehyde. You’re young to be a doctor and the teaching hospital isn’t far from here, so medical student. Formaldehyde means morgue rotation which doesn’t happen until your final year. Freshly showered and dressed, clearly you were on your way to hospital, not from.
"No." Sherlock said, setting down his fork. "I was wrong – I was arrogant and I was wrong. I never should have left you. I let my fear guide me and I ran. I should have told you how afraid I was... talked to you... but regret is useless – I can't do it over, dwelling on it is ridiculous!"
“There’s not much to tell… honestly it’s kind of a downer.”
I was loath to let him go, but he was determined.
“I don’t like fighting in here.”
“We’ll be quiet.” Shane said. “Get some rest.”
“Oh yeah. Wouldn’t think ‘e’d need a gun, big Alpha like that. But ‘e carried the girl out into the pile, all wrapped up. Set ‘er down real gentle – thought it was strange, being so gentle. I sawr ‘is gun good when ‘e set ‘er down. Then ‘e unwrapped ‘er an I could see it warnt garbage. After ‘e lef, I went an looked. Pretty Omega. Good for breedin’ even wi’ those skinny ‘ips. Wonder ‘ow she died. Do you know ‘ow she died?”
John’s arms tightened around me, but he was silent.
He was the best cocksucker John had ever had.
Unpacking Sherlock’s boxes was a herculean task. Not least because Sherlock himself unpacked his violin, put rosin on his bow, tucked it under his chin and began to play... leaving the rest of the unpacking to John.
They had gone out of their way to find the boy an especially compatible bondmate and he was throwing it in her face.
“I’m assured he’ll survive. It should only take a few hours.”
"What?" Sherlock asked in surprise.
Then I left Mycroft’s house, waving away his car. I wanted to walk. I needed to be alone with my thoughts.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "Did you think I WOULDN'T investigate someone who befriended John?"
Sherlock shrugged. “Might need it again sometime.”
Sherlock snapped the case closed and then stood very still, hoping John would get it over with quickly.
"Neither? Why would you do that? Fair play?"  The nurse asked sarcastically.
At his yell, Sherlock had plunged into the room. He must have been close, loitering in the hall outside John’s room. He looked around wildly for what had caused John’s distress.
“No... don’t. Sherlock! I love you!” I’d said into the phone, desperate, disbelieving.
"Oh! Boring."
"Lestrade thinks they found the sniper's nest. There's another body."
When the sounds from his bedroom ceased, John opened the overnight bag and rooted around. There were pajama pants with an elastic waist. Thank god! He put them on. Then he carefully donned a t-shirt that was so soft, it felt like silk against his ravaged skin. He recognized neither garment – Shane or Sherlock, or possibly both, had anticipated his need for clothing he could put on by himself and provided them.
Sherlock wasn’t ok. He wasn’t ok and I was terribly worried about him.
I was exhausted by then. I stripped off and climbed in behind Sherlock, relocating the hot water bottle to between his knees.
"Maybe." Victor conceded. "But he's alive. And he's devoted to you." He brushed a lock of my hair back, his fingers warm on my brow. "Go talk to him."
I went over and over the fight, self-righteously at first, the sting of John’s transgression fresh and my anger high. Slowly I began to see John’s side of things, grudgingly admitting to myself that I MIGHT have overreacted. The more I considered, the more embarrassed I became of my own behavior. I cringed at the memory of my accusations. I marveled at how patient John had been, how he’d tried to defuse the argument – until my needling had brought out his temper. And even then, he removed himself from the situation rather than lose control.
I scoffed. "No. I have a relationship now. I don't want anyone else."
“Yes, John, all Omegas know each other.” Sherlock said scathingly.
When John woke again, he was alone in the bed, the smell of brewing coffee permeating the bedroom. He got up and looked around for something to wear – Shane had left a dressing gown. He padded out into the big main room where the windows filled the flat with light. Shane was sitting at his desk staring into his laptop. John went over and kissed his temple.
Shane and Dusette sat in the back with the attendant while Sherlock rode up front, exclaiming impatiently at every stop light and slow down.
He didn’t care.
I had listened to John for ages... or so I thought. Listening isn’t something I’m accustomed to – not the way John meant it now. I observe and deduce... which glides over feelings and opinions and lands on facts. But facts have context. And context can be everything.
I let her lead me, smiling back a little foolishly. I noticed her heels sparkled like her barrettes and she’d swapped tights for smoky nylons. “Erm... I think I might be underdressed.” I wore what I always wore, jeans, a button down and a jumper under my utilitarian donkey coat.
“Stop it.” John commanded, wrapping his arms around his bondmate. “We weren’t serious. I’ll tell her I can’t see her anymore as soon as I get my phone back.”
Sherlock sighed. “Mycroft smells sort of the way peaty whisky tastes – it’s not to everyone’s liking, but everyone agrees it’s high quality. My only reservation about his scent... there’s a note that’s... off. It’s not
"Did you know all along?" Lestrade had asked. "Did you know Sherlock wasn't dead?"
John was surrounded by gargoyles. They chittered and groaned, made hideous faces and gyrated. Some of them were purple.
“Good.” She pinched each finger in turn and smiled when it hurt him. “Now make a fist.” John complied. “How does that feel?”
I'm not sure what Sherlock sees in me. Or what he thought he saw – it's beginning to be apparent he regrets telling me. He's changed his mind, he isn't so keen on me after all.
"It's not fair. It's not fair, and it feels impossibly hard, but you CAN do it. You can get through this. You can get sober."
Was that why he was interested in John? Because he thought Sherlock had killed Moriarty? If he wanted some sort of revenge, he would have killed John by now, surely.
-Sherlock couldn’t possibly manage his own money
“I don’t accept that.”
Lestrade’s groan was loud in his own ears. It had been a long time since another person had touched him there.
They wouldn't. But maybe they would.
“You’re so beautiful.” John told him. “So extraordinary. I love you.” He hadn’t meant to say it, but said, John knew it was true.
They hovered for a moment, wanting to help Sherlock… with a sigh, Mycroft retreated. He pressed a button on the side of his desk. “Anthea? I need you in my office.”
He didn’t stop the video. It was Mycroft’s responsibility to watch, even if he knew how it would end… so he was stunned when the Alpha closest to his brother boosted him atop the wall that cut across the alley. He strained to see the man that had saved his brother’s life – was he a Beta somehow come to help a compromised Omega? No, the man was definitely an Alpha. Mycroft watched the other Alphas attack him – they would mostly ignore a Beta – watched the man join the fight rather gleefully.
“Fuck me! John... oh! John!”
I came suddenly, unexpectedly, shooting so hard it hit the far wall. I leaned against the tile shuddering with each sharp shock - four, five, six before I was finished. I was destroyed by the pleasure, shaking with aftershocks, weak in the knees and craving John more than ever, missing him.
John explored the room again – standing this time – and quickly found the door. He pushed it open, wincing as it creaked, and crept silently out on his bare feet. He was on the deck of an indoor pool, the water reflecting the few lights dizzily.
He prayed that Shane had, that Shane was safe.... but he didn't want to see him right now. He didn't want to see Sherlock either - not that Sherlock was apt to give him a choice. He didn't want either of them to see him like this.
“Yeah.” He definitely had the self-confidence of a pilot. “For British Air now.”
“Not at all.”
He was blown away.
She was right, the odds of John hitting her were close to nil – I’d been surprised he’d put his elbow into her face when she attacked him. She was a woman, attractive and petite, and she was at his mercy. It didn’t matter that she was Moriarty’s creature, not to John’s sense of honour.
“Immersing them in water washes away trace evidence rather thoroughly.” Sherlock remarked. “He was wrapped in the plastic sheeting on which he’s laying – there was some in the skip as well.” Sherlock examined the young Omega’s fingernails, opened his mouth and then peered into his half-open eyes. “There’s the same chafing on his throat and here, under his arm, consistent with the first victim.”
Sherlock and John take a step forward in their investigation and in their personal lives.
"Late? Why were you at hospital at night?"
Lestrade climbed in. The pale expanse of leather was buttery soft. He slid across the seat and Mycroft followed him. He looked stiff — he was anxious, Lestrade realised. He hasn’t done this in a while either.
John came home late – but not as late as I expected. I was back on the couch watching telly when I heard him on the stairs. As soon as I saw him, I could tell he was pissed. He came right over to me and sat down, still wearing his coat. It was cold and his nose was red.
**But John was surprised that Mike had actually called Shane. He must be worried...**
“If I hadn’t refused the Alpha she chose for me, I wouldn’t be with John now.” Several of them reacted with shock at the very thought of them not together. “I ran away from Sherrinford, from Mummy and the Alpha she and my brother had chosen. If I hadn’t, I never would have found John. I met him accidentally.”
Dr. Phelps pinched the tips of his fingers, then between his fingers, then his palm… her expression grew grimmer with each negative. John didn’t acknowledge her touch until she was above his wrist. He steadfastly looked away from both of them – Sherlock realized John had already known what she’d find.
He finished making tea and put some bread in the toaster. He sat down and sipped from his mug. John was tired.
“You know I hate it when you don’t eat.”
“Hello?”
“What?” John discovered that he could not swing easily onto the deck as his taller mate had. “Sherlock...” He protested as he picked his way through the pile to a more accessible part of the derelict barge and climbed up. “What do you mean,
"Hungry?" John asked.
There was a time when Mary was her own person. But that time is long past. Moriarty broke her. He took everything she had, systematically. One bit at a time, he eradicated her. Scorched earth – Moriarty left nothing behind. He reduced her to nothingness.
“Good!”
John bobbed, taking him to the root over and over. He rolled the Omega’s vestigial testicles in his hand and pressed his knuckles into Sherlock’s perineum as he sucked. He felt the slick lubrication seeping from his entrance and thought momentarily of trying to stimulate his Omega’s pearl manually. But it was difficult to reach with his fingers and John could tell that Sherlock was not going to last.
He sat down, trying to calm the rising panic, but all he could think about was the riot.
“Look... sorry... Harry, I can’t explain, but you staying here is a matter of life and death.”
"Oh, erm, no... Taz used GBH sometimes... recreationally..." The big man shook off his melancholy. "Sherlock hasn't regained consciousness?"
“Of course.” Cam said silkily. “Thank you for coming, Inspector. I hope we are making a mountain out of a – how do you say – molehill.”
John kissed me and I fell into it, into him, immersed myself in him - the whole world his lips and tongue and teeth, the rasp of his stubbly chin and the warmth of his breath. I lost track of time, my whole being preoccupied with John's kisses. Until he gripped my arse again and pulled me against him, our cocks, hard and straining in our trousers, rubbing together. That brought me back into my body.
“When you’re safe, I’ll worry about that.”
Sherlock broke a window — an excruciatingly loud sound — and they climbed from the roof into the topmost flat. The tenant was home, a frightened-looking city boy who was happy to see the back of them with naught but a smashed window. They ran down the stairs, grateful for the thick, sound-muffling carpet, then eased open the front door and slipped out.
"I won't be late." He said. John waited a moment but when I didn't answer, he sighed and stumped down the stairs.
“Strange?” Sherlock asked, barely pausing his ministrations.
Moran frowned. He was still dangerous.
“I went to pick her up from school.” Virginia said. “As I do every day. She waits for me inside and comes out when I pull up in the car. Today she didn’t come out! I went in to look for her, but she wasn’t there. The headmaster wouldn’t talk to me – I had to call Tamsin and tell her that I couldn’t find Molly, and
When the doctor arrived, Sherlock examined her closely. Late-forties, slightly overweight, signs that she’d been caring for a baby – spit up on her shoulder and dark circles under her eyes. Given her age – and the wear on her wedding ring – Sherlock thought grandchild was rather more likely. But her adult daughter lived with her. Despite clear signs of exhaustion, she was energetic and prepared.
"I don't want to lose you either!" John blurted. He turned in Shane's embrace and wrapped his arms around his boyfriend, burying his face in Shane's neck. He smelled warm and familiar – a scent John remembered finding deeply erotic, though now he felt it only distantly.
John had texted at 1:23 a.m.: *Let’s talk*
“John, when your sister was taken, how did you find her?”
“It is.” I agreed. “It’s PERFECTLY awful. That night I ran out of here, she’d drunk so much she passed out... just fell down on the pavement... and by the time paramedics got there, her heart had stopped beating. Her electrolytes were severely unbalanced – alcohol can do that if you drink too much and eat too little... if someone hadn’t called 999 she’d be dead. She’d be dead, Mary.
When he reached the platform, the Omega helped him haul the ladder up and lock it back in place. Then he was running up to the next level and John was following him. He focussed not on the throbbing disco beat, but on how different the clang of his shoe sounded on the metal stairs from the soft thump of his stockinged foot. CLANG! Thump CLANG! Thump CLANG! Thump… and he definitely didn’t focus on the enchanting, hot honey scent of the Omega almost in heat above him.
Sentiment. My brother is right, caring is not an advantage.
"Really?"
“You want this?” He asked.
"Not. In. A. Cab." There it was: fury. I was furious with Sherlock. He'd led me on, toyed with me! I'd dumped my girlfriend for him! I'd never been with a man, but I was willing, for him. Only for him! And this is what he does!
Their kiss was needy, a clash of teeth and tongues. They wrestled, and Lestrade groped for Mycroft’s trousers, opening the flies and pushing them down, feeling the other man’s cock spring free. With a pleased grunt, he pushed Mycroft onto his bed and, freeing his own erection, climbed on top of him. They rubbed their pricks together. Mycroft licked his palm and encircled them both. It felt
Mycroft took a sip of the whisky, warmed from his hand on the glass. He swirled it and sniffed it first then cautiously drank. His eyebrows shot up in surprise.
“Mycroft, this isn’t necessary. I don’t want Sherlock’s money.”
I trust John. I trust John completely. My time away robbed me of so much, but not of the certainty of my love and trust in John. Maybe if I’m very, very attentive I will be able to deduce the point of continuing on.
“I won’t, John.”
“No longer than a week.” I say.
John clung to him, his hand around Sherlock's neck. He looked up, intending to look into Sherlock's eyes – Sherlock's eyes couldn't keep secrets from John. But he kissed Sherlock instead.
“I’m fine.” I said, giving the words a glum edge. “I’m tired. I feel like I’ve aged ten years in the past ten days. But I’m fine. I didn’t mean to worry you – I should have thought about Seb... you haven’t heard anything?”
Sherlock wiped furiously at the wetness on his cheeks, the deep well of regret threatening to overcome him again. "It's just the knock on the head." He said defensively. "It aches terribly."
I waited, breath held. Nothing. Nothing! I bounced my forehead against the wall gently, holding back tears that suddenly threatened to spill. I had to be strong. I had to be strong for Sherlock.
“Sherlock! The library.” Mycroft insisted. “Do I have to do EVERYTHING!?”
Greg walked with me, guided me, his hand firmly on my upper arm.
“Jesus!” Sherlock swore, shuddering with enjoyment. “Your cock... fuck! It’s so big! It’s all over my prostate... uhnn!”
"Get down!" Sherlock hissed. "Moran is shooting at us."
I loved him. I'd loved him for a long time – he was my best mate. He'd saved me from the oppressive emptiness that certainly would have killed me. He'd given me so much! I'd offered my own life in the hope he might escape when we faced off with Moriarty. It was safe to say I loved Sherlock Holmes.
They started down a path that took them into the piles of discarded equipment. The light from the bulb outside the lift didn’t penetrate far into the maze, just enough to cast shadows that danced and loomed as they made their way deeper into the dank sub basement.
“I’m fine.” I said flatly, conscious that I was far from fine. But there was nothing Mycroft could do to help me. He couldn’t bring Sherlock back.
"It takes as long as it takes." John told him. "I was still mourning Sherlock two years after he left."
Lestrade's secret is revealed! To the reader, not so much to everyone else.
He was tense under my hand. “Nothing.” He said too quickly. “What do you mean?”
"Mm." Sherlock buried several nasty retorts and settled for noncommittal. Bruno, as Sherlock was constantly reminded, was a good man. "You know John will lose his hand."
Shane grabbed a fistful of Sherlock's shirt, his other fist cocked and ready. "Get that 'superior mind' ready for some competition."
I wondered what the rest of the flat looked like, denuded of my presence. It made me feel glum... feel like John had stuffed me up here and forgotten about me...
"Oui. Yes. It's good you are no longer kidnapped, Dr. Watson. Where is Sherlock?"
“I like him this way.” Vino proclaimed. “I like seeing him broken. Docile. He thought he could bring us down, now he’s nothing more than a plaything. A pet. You can have another three says, Nazer. Use him hard, I won’t delay a third time. In fact tonight, we’ll ALL use him. A little party to celebrate his continued existence.”
“Sherlock, don’t shut me out.”
“You would be happy. Not here... not like this!” I gestured violently at the room.
“Erm, he referenced it. I had the impression he used cocaine now and then.”
Is this how John had felt in hospital – so happy and comforted to see Sherlock (and Shane, he added grudgingly) – but with a complete lack of the lust that always before had accompanied John’s presence? He still wanted this man to touch him, to hold him, he still wanted John to be his... Sherlock was amazed by love, by its depth and breadth, its greediness and its selflessness... Every time he thought he understood it, some new facet was revealed and he realize he knew nothing.
“Sherlock, he’s going to prison!”
Sherlock nodded. “They were good parents.”
He shucked the duvet back from his bed in one motion, then bullied Mycroft onto it. Lestrade bit his lower lip and admired the long limbs furry with copper hair, the auburn treasure trail stretching from navel to bush. Mycroft's long cock was fully erect, ruddy with arousal, foreskin retracted, damp head revealed.
“You will. As soon as he’s out of surgery. I’ve made arrangements – you have all the entitlements of a family member here. I’m certain it’s what Sherlock will want.”
“Oh, right.” John said. Swearing under his breath he left Sherlock on the bed and fetched cglived, syringes, saline and alcohol pads from an equipment drawer. Sherlock watched, fascinated, as John, using his hand his left elbow, and his teeth, methodically donned a glove and went through the process of removing the thing from his urethra. It left him sore and feeling somewhat neutered.
Yes, I was worried about him. I was out of my mind with worry about him. It was beyond foolish to go back into such danger in his state. But I was also envious that he was doing something so crazily perilous whilst I was doing absolutely nothing. Less than nothing – I was moping around, shutting myself off from the world...
I made a small noise of dismay, but if Mycroft heard it he gave no sign.
"The dead rise." John greeted me with a smile. "Tea's made." He nodded at the pot and I lunged for it gratefully. "How are you feeling?"
“Most Omegas live sheltered lives. There aren’t many educational or occupational opportunities for Omegas. As you know.” Sherlock scoffed. “There aren’t any Omega bars or clubs, at least not that I’m aware of. Maybe a sewing circle somewhere. You’ve met a lot of Omegas through your job? A lot of domestic disturbances?”
“Just look at him. What a prize he is! What a jewel he would have been in my crown!” Moriarty mused. Then his eyes narrowed and his voice turned mean. “Too bad he didn’t know his place!”
Shane laughed. “Maybe.” He said. “If this had happened to me instead, what would you do?”
“What the fuck! You blokes playing war? With MY cards?!” Staelich hovered over us.
“Wallog.”
“You miss them.” Sherlock observed with some confusion.
"So it's a coincidence? You coming HERE now?"
“I’ll come with you.” John said. “Let me get my coat.”
“I know.” John still lay with his eyes closed, both arms under the warming blankets. “I didn’t expect him to go back in.”
A moan.
That was the thought in my head as I entered him – that I could erase the uncertainty from his eyes with this act. I moved slowly, letting him fully adjust to my girth. When I was fully seated within him, I leaned over and caressed his face. “I love you, Sherlock Holmes.” I said, and kissed him deeply. He clung to me, held me tight as I began to move, sodding him deliberately.
Mike dragged him out for a pint. John didn't want to go, but it was Mike. Mike had brought he and Sherlock together. John felt like he owed Mike – rationally, he knew he didn't, Mike didn't do anything special. He just introduced two men, both in search of a roommate that each believed could not exist. Mike couldn't know how lonely they each were, how isolated. How much they would help each other. But it FELT like he owed Mike... more than just gratitude – he owed a debt. That Sherlock had died didn't cancel it out – on the contrary, it made what Mike had done even more precious.
"Oh..." Sherlock said when he saw the jock. He couldn't take his eyes off it.
"Come on, into the toilet. I'll take a look at the cuts." John kept his arms around him until they got to the sink. "Where?" John asked. "Your hip is bleeding."
“You don’t know...”
"No!" Gereth scoffed. "EVERYONE treats me like a kid. Everyone thinks they know what's best for me. I want to be shot of the lot of them."
That wasn't true. It was all Sherlock's fault. If he hadn't dragged the army doctor along on his cases, John would be whole now. Clinically depressed perhaps, but whole. Sherlock would most likely be dead – several times over – but John would have both hands.
John made a small noise of dismay. I let the horror of that night wash over me once more.
I gave myself a 36 percent chance of surviving it.
"I told you I didn't have friends."
I was warmed by his sincerity.
John made a note on his pad of paper. The other students used their phones or small tablets, but John didn’t type fast enough – neither with his thumbs nor all ten fingers.
I was nude in bed and John was stroking his hand down my side lovingly. Oh John! So intriguing from the first moment I saw you. So angry, so lost. I wanted you then, wanted your hands on me, your mouth. But I never expected that you would hold my interest. That you would never bore me. I never expected to love you.
Then John's mouth pressed against his own and Sherlock thought that if he had any pride, any dignity, he would push John away. Tell him that he didn't want whatever this was – a goodbye snog? Pity sex?
“You’re mine.” I told him, licking across the head of his cock, tasting the bitter sap. “You belong to me – don’t forget that when you’re away.”
“I need to go back to rehab.” I said softly, avoiding looking at him.
“They weren’t drowned there.”
after all, The Iceman. When Lestrade
“Oh? Yes! I too am pleased.” Mycroft simply stared at him for a moment, holding his hand. Then his face fell again and he cleared his throat. “Whilst it is
It was Sherlock, I was certain. The long, lanky body, the pale skin, the large hands and dark curls... but the closer I got, the less he looked like himself: He was so battered and thin... I shuddered in horror, thinking he was dead already. He was kneeling on the floor his hands tied behind him, leaning forwards over an old weight bench, head hanging. He was strapped to the bench, held firmly in place prepared for execution – beheading apparently. I felt my gorge rise thinking about that brilliant head being violently separated from its body...
Sholto poured water into the post and set the tea to steep. “You’re looking a bit peaky.” He observed.
“No. It’s... good.” Mycroft still appeared surprised. He turned 360 degrees, surveying the elegantly spartan flat. Then his eyes snagged on Lestrade — creased trousers, shoes in need of shining, the careless way his collar protruded from his sky-blue jumper...
“My control. My base instincts are... I’ve found myself acting in ways I’m not proud of. Just stupid Alpha shite. Stuff I’ve never…a little context… I, erm, bonded a few months ago.”
I was leaving rehab today. I put on a suit - the first time I'd worn anything but pyjamas since I'd left hospital. It felt both strange and refreshing.
Sherlock was admitted. The process took several hours – John stayed with him, fretting about what damage the GBH and the concussion together could wreak on Sherlock's brain.
Then he started pouring the whisky. But he didn't have the appetite for it – his stomach was churning as fast as his thoughts. He went back to bed and tried to sleep.
I stood and picked up our plates. “Eat your pudding.” I said, shoving the container of gulab jamon towards him.
“And Mycroft’s men will follow him into the building. Out of sight, of course. Once he pulls the trigger, we’ll have backup.”
Sherlock sat back pensively. “Jones used a code for their names – and the names of the witnesses. I have a feeling some of the people who owed him were quite powerful and were paying off their debts with favours. Which may have been why our sniper was gambling with Jones in the first place – if he’d won, Jones could call in some favours to benefit our man.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He smiled a bit at that, but I could see he was preoccupied, shadows pooling in and under his eyes. I leaned back, holding him more loosely. “What are you wearing?” I asked, staring at the hat pulled low on his brow.
I cupped his face as I kissed him. I pushed my fingers up remembering his beautiful curls ... his stubbly hair was coarse and strange, muscle memory wanting to fist a handful of black waves.
Victor put his hand on my arm. “You don’t know the trail. In this weather, it’ll be treacherous.” He saw me blanch. “Sorry, John, don’t worry. I’m sure Sherlock…”
I wept. I had not protected him. He had been caught in the maw of a nightmare and had been masticated without mercy. We had pulled him out, Mycroft and I, but not before he’d been terribly damaged.
“And let Sherlock take care of you? He can’t even remember to order samosas.” Shane said lightly.
“Come on, Sherlock.” Lestrade urged. “There has to be a cure. If anyone can find it, it’s you.”
“Can we… can we talk, Mary? I had no idea you felt this way.”
"Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective. I'm sorry about your recent breakup, Nurse Church, did he go back to Sheffield?"
“I’m trying to remember why I missed this.”
I stilled his hand and drew him against me. “Later.” I murmured, kissing him.
“John!” She sounded pleased. “Spill it, mate. How’d it go?”
https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/853
The policeman nodded her understanding and issued orders to her people.
“But I don’t know that.” John said, stepping away from him. The Omega felt the loss keenly. “This is my service weapon, Sherlock. I don’t let anyone touch it who I don’t know for 100% certain is certified.” John sighed deeply. “This isn’t an Alpha-Omega thing, Sherlock. If you feel you need a gun to defend yourself, then we’ll get you a gun. We’ll do it tomorrow then we’ll go to the range and practice so you can be completely comfortable with it. I’m going to put this away.”
"Erm, Dr. Watson?"
John hastily typed 'Terrence Blymore GBH' into google. And, yes! There it was: Taz HAD died of GBH poisoning as well. The two deaths were investigated jointly and though they didn't say why, police did not think the men had overdosed themselves either purposely or accidentally.
"What was there to talk about?" God, his arm itched!
Sherlock shook his head once, hating – HATING – Mycroft for being right.
“I have to go to the clinic.... I have to find him!” Sherlock cried and started towards the mouth of the alley.
“Thank you.” John said. “For saving him.”
“Don’t mind him.” John said to the nurse. “He’s always a dick.”
John stared at the envelope on the table. The entire world was upside down. 'Fuck you, Sherlock!’ He raged internally. ‘Fuck you! Fuck you for doing this to me!' He was an utter fool for mourning that bastard! Nothing but a fool, sitting around moping while Sherlock was alive and well doing god knows what!
“But I LIKE the thing with the peas.” Sherlock whined.
“I don’t NEED any help.” John spat the word like a curse.
John had never heard Sherlock play. The Omega had mentioned it briefly during the heady, lust-addled conversation before they bonded, but John had not thought of it since.
In the morning he resisted returning to Kensington to watch John emerge from the posh three-flat with a skip in his step. Instead he went to the Pensioner's Hotel. He bathed and dressed again as the posh, older gentleman and went to keep his appointment with Moran's tailor. There he drew out a young apprentice and got him talking about Colonel Moran. The boy had hunted with his father as a youth and knew his way around a hunting rifle. Moran had told him stories about stalking prey in 'the jungle' – it sounded more like India or somewhere in Southeast Asia rather than Africa. Moran claimed to have followed a wounded tiger down a drainage pipe. He'd trailed it to a dead end offshoot and killed the mad beast as it tried to attack him. The other members of his hunting party had nicknamed him 'Tiger Jack.' He had the tiger's pelt as a rug by the hearth in his bed chamber.
Lestrade wasn’t the absolute worst rugger I’d ever played with, he had too much spirit for that, but it was a close thing.
“He has to know!” I said.
But now I had seen it and I had to admit, Sherlock and Officer Vaachaspati were a handsome pair. I didn't intend to try and compete – how could I possibly compete?
"How are you, Victor?" I asked.
"I overheard Vic saying they should take a holiday, get away from the badgering. But Dad said he'd be damned before his own children drove him out of his own house. I actually felt kind of bad for Vic. He seemed pretty miserable. But he stuck by Dad. He would though, wouldn't he – knew what side his bread was buttered on."
But making John believe he was dead!? Letting him mourn for all this time!? NO!
"That's right, you aren't gay." Shane replied with an eyebrow cocked teasingly.
“He’s being modest.” Jason said. “He has four novels out. Twisty crime stories.”
Sherlock straddled my thighs. He spread lube all over my cock then lifted himself up and positioned it against his entrance. Slowly he impaled himself, grimacing slightly. I caressed his prick as he worked his way down. Soon enough Sherlock was sitting on my hips, then he rocked himself forward and I gasped with the pleasure.
“Do you? I know last night wasn’t what you wanted…”
I still remember how he kissed me, slowly at first, making me hard, making me want him. Then harder, more intense... and the way he looked at me, like I was something rare and precious...
John sighed through his nose. “You look like yourself today. Did you get some rest?”
Sherlock did.
“You didn’t do that,” Sherlock denied softly, grasping John by the shoulders. “I don’t want you to think that. John, listen. Neither of us were well a month ago. You don’t hold my nearly dying from drugs against me, and I don’t hold your outburst against you.”
Sherlock visibly relaxed. “I know what I’m doing; I’m modeling correct pronunciation.”
“Yes,” she sighed.
“It’s Mrs. Hudson,” Sherlock whispered. “I can tell by her footsteps.”
They both sighed.
Sherlock didn’t love her. His heart only had room for one person, and he didn’t think he could love a person who purposefully manipulated him the way she did. The point was that Sherlock didn’t know why John responded the way he did. That was another thing he felt: confusion. How did John change from thinking he had been in love, to thinking he couldn’t be in a relationship? Did the Janine incident get to him that much?
John’s lips twitched down into a frown. “What’s with the face?” he murmured, cupping both of Sherlock’s cheeks with his hands. “You look troubled.”
“That’s right, it’s a cat,” John booped her nose with the nose of the stuffed toy.
Sherlock’s hands were sweating beneath John’s. He knew he would regret 2012 for the rest of his life. He would never live it down, and he realized he didn’t deserve to. “I prefer kissing,” he joked weakly, a painful weight in his chest.
John’s face was so puzzled that it was rather cute, and Sherlock stroked both of his cheeks. He wanted to kiss the tip of his nose, but figured it might have been a touch inappropriate during a serious conversation.
Sherlock dialed a number, and John was able to hear the phone ring twice before it picked up.
“I had a bloody blast,” John chuckled. “It looked like you did, too. You were really fucking hot.”
Sherlock shrugged, trying to appear casual. “We could watch telly. It’ll be nice when we can go on cases again.”
“How is the Ice Man, anyway?” Irene asked, tightening the ties of the robe.
“I’m not sure if accepting my deliveries counted as cheating.”
“No!” John shook his head. “I mean, yes, you were supposed to. I was just really surprised.”
“What the fuck is this!?” he shouted.
When John returned to the room with a frazzled Mrs. Hudson, he was surprised to see Sherlock awake, but not surprised to see Lestrade recording him.
“Isn’t that what’s supposed to happen? People become lovers after confessing their feelings?” He sounded lost.
His indifference made John want to punch him. “Sherlock told me about Victor and Redbeard.”
Sherlock yawned. That was unexpected. He still felt embarrassed and wanted to go to bed, but it was cold without John, and the sofa was warm where his body had been. Sherlock pursed his lips. John wasn’t going to be out of the bathroom for at least fifteen minutes. Sherlock shimmied into John’s spot, enjoying the warmth. He pulled his knees up onto the cushions and curled into a ball, yawning into the blanket.
“Because,” he spat. Before he finished his thought, the scowl on his face loosened, and his features turned upset. “Because you’re my best friend and I thought you were the only one who understood me. But I was wrong. To have you insist that I must secretly be heterosexual and that I want to be with Irene made it seem like you never took me seriously. You just brushed off my words, as if I’m a child who doesn’t know what he wants instead of an adult man.” He sighed, the anger in is posture deflating, and his shoulders sagged. “You’ve always built up an idea of me, John, but it’s usually very far from the truth. You’ve done this in numerous ways over the years, but I think I know why you’ve been obsessed with me and Irene.”
Blessed John, he knew the heart of his insecurities before his brain made the connection. “You really don’t mind?” he asked meekly.
John would never know how Sherlock could make him so happy in one second, and completely fucking heartbroken in another. “
John held his hand. “Sherlock?” he asked hesitantly. “Can you...can you say it now?”
“Is it my hair?” Sherlock asked, eyes narrowing.
“It’s okay. I’ll take what you give me. I
Sherlock lifted his head, drowsy eyes scanning their situation, and he sat up, stretching, scratching the back of his neck. “No, I should get up,” he said, a red tint to his cheeks.
he thought. “Yeah,” John said casually.
“There you are,” he murmured.
But, things actually made a bit of sense. Some people didn’t actually like being around someone who was exactly like they were. Hold on. Sherlock obviously thought this through. “So you do want to be romantically involved with someone, just not someone exactly like you.”
Yeah I couldn't realistically drag this out much further lol
I think this story will have, like 3 more chapters? We'll see. I'm posting this before bed so I hope there aren't any mistakes lol
“I know,” Sherlock said patiently.
would be the owner of that heart.
John grunted, rolling his hips against Sherlock’s, and their breath was taken away when hot skin met hot skin. “You realize you’ve been groping me nonstop?”
“Yes. There was a note on the bottle, too.” John then reached into his jeans pocket and pulled out the very slip of paper Sherlock had put on the bottle.
“Don’t put pressure on your back,” John told him. “I know it’s just a sofa, but still.”
Anyway, uh, I've been excited for this chapter for some time, and I hope you don't hate me for it
Sherlock chuckled. “I wasn’t being serious. Besides, he doesn’t know about Irene, and I want to keep it that way. It’ll save me the headache of a lecture.”
His face softened and he cupped Sherlock’s cheek. “Listen, it’s all okay now,” he said softly. He licked his lips. “Well, it’s not,” he murmured, “my brain’s still shite. But. I’m okay otherwise.”
John laughed bitterly. “That’s a sign, isn’t it, of how much my marriage fell apart.” He rubbed his eyes. “I feel desensitized to her bullshit. I feel like a fool for falling to her, to be honest.”
John really didn’t deserve him. He cleared his throat, heart thumping painfully, turning his face towards the unlit fireplace.
Damn it. Sherlock’s total lack of reaction to this was confirmation that something happened between them, wasn’t it?
“I do,” Sherlock said, and disappeared into his room for a moment.
John blinked. That came out of nowhere, but he wasn’t opposed to the idea at all. “Really?”
He looked small, suddenly, and tired. Sherlock wished he could have comforted him. He looked at the bite mark again. Jealousy burned within him.
. “You try hard.”
He was immediately proven wrong when Mrs. Hudson opened the door. “It’s just--” She gasped, hand flying to her chest in shock.
Sherlock didn’t even know where to begin. “I don’t have much to do?” he asked incredulously. “What are you talking about? You don’t know my life. You don’t know how I occupy my time.”
I needed to feel him too. I pressed him against the wall with my entire body, kissing his neck, his clavicle, his chin, his mouth. I pulled at his kimono, my hand ranging up his thigh. I touched him, he was hard and leaking in my hand.
“Yes. He’s no danger to you.”
“Shhh.” John sooths me. “It was just a dream. We’re here in our bed.”
“Everything is so dull otherwise.”
“I guess, I thought if you were jealous, I’d feel more secure. John...”
“The sniper was... furious.”
“Yes! You’ve seen him?” I asked.
SHERLOCK
You hold me to a higher standard – because I know that you see me for what I am, I have to believe I am capable of meeting that standard. I strive to do so.
"Yeah. Yes. Go check out the labs on the third floor..." The nurse visibly made a decision, his face becoming determined. "Ask for Peter Smythe. He's a friend, I'll let him know you're coming by. You're not his type, but he likes it if you flirt with him anyway."
"Shane. You slept with him. Which is ... fine, whatever. But you can't expect me..."
John darted past them and advanced on the (his!) Omega. Up close, he was even more beautiful – his lips full and luscious… his scent like warm, wildflower honey… and he was so very young! John would be surprised if he was even eighteen.
"I have photos I'd like you to take a look at – I'll pay your consulting fee of course – if you'd be willing."
And here I could brood about John. I wanted him. That wasn't new, I'd wanted him from the beginning. I'd never intended for him to know – but he'd surprised me when he found out. He hadn't been disgusted, he hadn't pitied me, he hadn't done any of the things I'd imagined... l felt the hope surging through my chest again. Maybe... maybe John could love me the way I loved him...
He'd forgotten how big it was. His jaw was stretched wide and his throat assaulted. Sherlock struggled to relax as John pulled out and slowly pushed himself back in. Sherlock felt the impossibly huge cock push farther into his throat. He gagged. John immediately pulled back, but Sherlock gripped his arse and held him close. He took it into his mouth again, consciously relaxing his jaw – his eyes watered and saliva ran down his chin, but he continued to urge John's arse forward, back and then forward again, forcing his throat open until his nose and chin were buried in John's ginger bush. It felt like a wine bottle had been shoved down his gullet. Sherlock loved it.
“I see.” Mycroft said.
Despite sleeping for fourteen hours, I felt tired. But I forced myself to my feet. I put on my shoes and jacket and went in search of Lady Anwen.
Sherlock picked up the sheaf of papers and started scanning it, flipping the pages until he found the bequests. “I’ll want to read it more closely, but right now show me what is different from the will your father showed you.”
“I don't care what sort of trauma made you hate hospital” Sherlock snarled. “You're staying with him for as long as he wants you."
“Then we go take down Moran.”
I nodded. "I imagine it's been awful for you here, losing your partner..."
It hurt – I was so happy and so completely terrified at the same time... I'd never felt this way with Victor. I'd certainly never cared what the other men I'd been with did. But John... was THIS love? This abject dread of losing him?
Was it a mistake, letting the line between my two lives blur?
I fucked him through his climax, making certain the angle scraped my cock over his prostate with every thrust, until I felt his muscles ease. He lay back in repose, lazy with physical satisfaction. Only then did I carefully pull out and, kneeling over him, stroke myself until I came, adding my emissions to his own.
"How long were you together?"
The ellipsis indicating Sherlock was responding appeared... then disappeared and reappeared again. I stared at the dots, watching them bounce and bounce... it disappeared again.
“It’s a long story. But first, I have to tell you something.”
“And, yeah, there it is... a red tower... it’s, erm, nice.”
Day after day, he heard nothing from John. He tried to teach himself not to hope for it, to give up his dreams of reconciliation.
Mike was a good friend, but Mike was a doctor – he wasn't a surgeon like John, but he'd done his surgery rotation. He would understand HOW MUCH John had lost with his hand. More than anything, John didn't want to see the pity in Mike's kind eyes.
Dinner was ... long. The food was excellent, but my appetite wasn’t. I was sat across from Mary next to Seb at the head of the table. A seat of honour, I knew, but I would have been more comfortable farther away from those cold, blue eyes.
“Exhausting. You know how I feel about leg work.” Mycroft grimaced. “I spoke with several people who knew Moriarty when he was young. They refused to say much, they are still afraid of him. He leaves quite the terrifying impression, when he so wishes.”
Victor drank off the rest of his whisky and poured yet another. He’d wanted absolution from me – wanted me to tell him that Sherlock hadn’t been ruined by their affair.
He’d also played unrefereed rugby for years, wrestled all through college, taken mixed martial arts classes and been through hand-to-hand combat training in the RAMC. John could handle himself in a fight.
He kissed me like it was oxygen, all of his need, all of his love in the press of his lips, the sweep of his tongue. It was the best thing I'd felt in a long, long time. I was amazed anew that I had somehow secured the love of this man. Even after years apart, he still wanted me.
Then John was slipping over the edge. He shouted his climax and thrust deep inside, the thought of his cum filling Sherlock’s arse made him cum all the harder.  He shuddered and jammed himself forward trying to go deeper, to inseminate Sherlock’s heart and soul, his very being with the product of their union.
Suddenly Sherlock felt both of Moran's hands pressing on his neck, cutting off his air. His eyes flew open – Moran’s face was inches from his own. They locked eyes. Sherlock forced himself to relax, to not struggle. He let Moran choke him, keeping the eye contact until the black swam over his vision and he lost consciousness.
“Oh!” The nurse exclaimed. “Lice.” He and Dr. Baehr reflexively stepped back. I chuckled softly. I couldn’t help myself.
I was still a coughing, hacking, phlegmy mess, the better I felt, the more desperate I was to avoid passing it on to him – almost as desperate as he was to avoid contracting it, if the number of times he washed his hands was any indication. We maneuvered around each other tentatively and I began to wonder if he regretted what had passed between us at Wallog.
"What if I don't want you to step aside?"
"The hedge maze." Lady Anwen said. "I need to go back – Gereth won't hurt me..."
“Lestrade… you would be good for Mycroft, without a doubt. But Mummy would
Victor was much drunker than I’d realised. “Found out what?”
I’ve come to depend on his help. That’s one reason the thought of losing him worries me so much. Why Moriarty worries me.
In seconds a lorry squealed around the corner and sped down Baker Street, coming to an abrupt shrieking halt in front of them. Several men jumped out of the truck and grabbed Sherlock. They hustled him into the back of the lorry. As they were duct taping his hands together, Shane was ushered in as well.
“You surprised me though. I didn’t expect you to care for him so much.”
“I’ll try that, thank you.” Mycroft turned his attention back to the print on the wall. He named the artist. “Cy Twombly.” It didn’t sound like a question.
John rejoined Mrs. Hudson and they walked arm-in-arm to the gates. I followed their tail.
"Sherlock... " I stopped myself – he was sick and hallucinating, he obviously didn't realize he was telling me this. I shouldn't take advantage...
John's blog was on the screen, he'd been typing a new entry. Sherlock started to skim the text... then stopped and started over, reading it properly.
I remembered perfectly the feel of him in my arms, his weight against my chest, the texture of his cropped black hair, shorn of curls, the scent of some foreign soap on his skin...
“That’s good.” I said. “I can’t see you at all. Is there room for two?”
John glowered. "Don't touch me." He whispered.
Lestrade was relieved when Sherlock threw open the door, grabbed him and yanked him inside whilst Mrs Hudson closed and barred the door behind him.
"I'm not certain, Mr. Holmes. I could look..."
I choked through another wave of nausea. Mycroft looked distinctly alarmed. “I can’t...” I coughed. “I can’t bear for him to see me this way.” The sentiment brought tears to my eyes.
It didn’t help that Lestrade smelled like he’d just smoked a fag before walking in the door.
John described how they'd come out, the long tunnel to the parking garage, the vestibule with the lift and doors, which door led to the dungeon, the stairs and the long corkscrewing hall... By the time he'd finished, a van was pulling up. Two men got out and she gave them concise instructions, they carried John between them to the van and laid him in the back.
“Oh?” I immediately felt wary. I’d forgotten the camera – I’d forgotten myself! – when I’d beaten a man to death with the butt of my rifle. “They attacked me...” I started defensively.
John got up, and Sherlock’s body immediately missed the warmth of John’s thigh. Sherlock put more of the blanket on himself. He flexed his toes. His eyelids felt slightly heavy.
“Say ‘thank you,’” John mumbled absentmindedly.
Culverton’s smile widened. “Lovely. This is better than I thought it would be. You continue to surprise me, Mr. Holmes.”
“What have you got?” John asked.
She looked at Sherlock, her light eyes roaming over his body, as if she was trying to pinpoint where he was shot. Then, her laser-like gaze turned back to John--more specifically, his finger. “And you stayed with her,” she said quietly. “Interesting.”
“Only in my false deduction,” he said with a small grin.
his voice cracked. His eyes stung, but he couldn’t stop any of this from happening. “Why, Sherlock? Why aren’t you furious with me? Why don’t you fucking
His thumb stroked over the soft skin of his hand. “Just relax. You don’t need to sleep if you don’t want to. Just stay,” he whispered.
John gasped. “Rosie, no--” he made a move to walk towards them, but stopped. Sherlock looked hurt and confused.
“Hmph,” John smiled a little. “I guess you’re right.” He took off his jacket, setting it on top of the dresser, and took off his shoes. Exhaustion was catching up to him. “Sorry I didn’t get the shopping.”
Sherlock and John spend a night on the couch.
Mrs. Hudson was overjoyed but puzzled when she was told John was moving back in. “So soon?” she asked.
“You need rest,” John spoke. “You’ve got a hole in your chest.”
John’s hand tightened around the arm of his chair, gripping it. He had come to realize the only thing worse than being dissected by Sherlock’s deductions was being suffocated by his silence. They didn’t say much to each other after that. Sherlock chose to focus on Rosie instead of him--whether that was because he didn’t know what to say, or he genuinely didn’t want to talk to him anymore, John didn’t know.
The next morning, John woke up to the sound of Rosie’s cries, deep snores in his ear, and the feeling of Sherlock’s body sprawled on top of him. Their chests were pressed together and, to John’s alarm, he felt Sherlock’s hard prick on his abdomen.
“Oh yeah?” John crossed his arms. “Stretch out your hand and flex it without wincing.”
Sherlock just nodded, raising his violin to his chin. He resumed his playing.
"Mm." John took a slug of his beer. "I'm relieved that there doesn't seem to be any lasting damage from the GBH and concussion. He'll make a full recovery."
“Yes.” I said. “Yes, dinner would be lovely.”
“London’s back alleys are policed. Makes getting high less convenient.”
Sherlock scoffed. “Of course, I am! I don’t want children!” He said the word like one might say ‘cockroaches,’ or ‘weeping sores.’
“Yes.”
I had done this to John, turned him into this sad, pinched character. I hated myself for it.
John smiled into the mass of dark curls. “Good.”
Selwyn sighed. "Dad threw me out again. I went to my girlfriend's and got high."
The attendant opened the back doors. Dusette looked at Shane expectantly. When he didn’t move, her eyebrows rose, but she didn’t comment. She walked off with the attendant towards the hospital entrance.
John smiled. “And you deny your cuteness.”
John swallowed the lump in his throat, propping himself up on his elbows and placing his clean hand on his warm cheek. “You sure you’re okay? I love you,” his voice trembled, “and I want you to be okay.”
Ignoring his quick heartbeat, John said, “It’s not a matter of growing up, but I do think keeping this buried wasn’t the best thing to do. I am really sorry about your friends, Sherlock. You didn’t deserve that pain, and neither did they.”
Sherlock closed his eyes. “Resume the massage. Please.”
Sherlock sprung into action. “Well, Molly, Mrs. Hudson, don’t you think it’s time to give Rosie her gifts?”
“No, no, no,” John placed his finger over Sherlock’s lips. “No, I was just surprised. You didn’t do anything wrong, I promise.”
You know, I started this story before the U.S. election and season 4. It feels REALLY weird thinking about that lol
John didn’t appreciate her making Sherlock embarrassed. Honestly, she was just being insensitive! “Don’t act like you care about him.”
“We’re both idiots,” he said. “I love you, and you thought I didn’t. You love me, and I thought you didn’t. We’re worse than characters from a teen romance novel.”
Sherlock put his face in his hands.
Was he getting sick or something? He rubbed his eyes with his knuckles, hoping to clear the fuzzy feeling in his brain, and realized that he wasn’t in his bed. In fact, he wasn’t in his house at all. Blinking rapidly in confusion, John shook his head. This couldn’t be. He was at...a restaurant? Since when? Something about this restaurant looked familiar, too, but his brain felt like it was made of pudding, and he couldn’t remember it at the moment. He placed his hand on the table and opened his eyes again. He was still at the restaurant. How could this be? People didn’t just teleport from their beds to a restaurant, and a high-end one at that.
Sherlock was lying beneath him, red from his cheekbones to his heaving chest, arms folded over his flat stomach. He averted his eyes and tossed his head to the side, squeezing his eyes shut. “Oh
When John got out of bed on Saturday, there was apprehension in his chest for what would come later in the day, but he was happy, too. He felt himself smile wider than usual when he took Rosie out of her crib.
She stood up from the bed and walked towards the bars, and she looked haggard up close, eyes red and the lines around her mouth pronounced. “I need to talk to you,” she said quietly, but intensely.
John looked at Sherlock, uneasy. “I don’t know if I should leave him.”
The next day, Sherlock’s morphine levels were lowered by the nurses, only a little, but enough for him to be in pain, although his head was clearer, which he enjoyed. Still, his hands tightly held bunches of the hospital sheets as he tried to fight waves of pain.
of you, I could hardly breathe.”
“Not a problem. Do you need anything?”
(See the end of the chapter for
The cabbie nodded and drove.
The question surprised him and he hugged John closer. “Of course I do. Did I not make that clear?”
“And it damn near worked.”
“A good reality?” he found himself asking hesitantly. He mentally scolded himself for seeking reassurance like a teenager, especially when he knew the world he created for John after he awoke would turn into a nightmare once everything was revealed.
Sherlock immediately said, “It’s terrible. It makes you look ancient.”
“Don’t!” he shouted, spinning around, teeth bared.
). His nerves were singing. John’s warm, wet mouth was now kissing his neck by his ear, and he had no idea why but it felt divine. It was just kissing, but it was slowly turning his blood into magma. His lips were so soft, insistent but still somehow gentle. John’s arm was supporting him more than his own legs. He couldn’t stop a gasp when John’s hand met his bare chest, above his pecs, his nipples perking up and tingling when his thumb ran over one.
down and killing him, and he hadn’t even thought of that. Not that he was very concerned, though. He couldn’t bring himself to be concerned.
“Because after what I’ve done to you, you’d have a right to hurt me!” he threw his hands in the air, growing irritated, an angry, embarrassed flush to his cheeks.
John chewed on his bottom lip, nodding. “Could be.” He looked at Sherlock for a long moment, and Sherlock could practically see the wheels in his brain turning. John sat on the edge of the bed, placing his hand on Sherlock’s knee through the duvet. “I think you were less worried about Moriarty than you're worried about her,” he said soberly.
the Fall? He still had no idea what was happening, but he had to go outside and see if Sherlock was there. He didn’t want to mess this up, and somehow, he thought Sherlock’s presence would ground him a little.
e a father?” she asked incredulously. Her smile fell. “Wait, you’re not living here?”
Sherlock whined in protest, pressing himself against John. “Gather your belongings as quickly as possible. I want you back here.”
“That’s good,” Sherlock said, fixing the duvet and sheets around him. “I don’t think I’ve ever spent so much time in bed in my life,” he grumbled.
He was alone.
“How old is she?” Irene asked.
Sherlock’s head whipped around, his eyes wide and lips trembling.
Okay, John wasn’t expecting this. He was feeling vulnerable, and his hands nervously grabbed the edge of his sheets. “I, I guess I don’t.”
“Stop,” Sherlock held up a hand, standing, close enough that their chests were almost brushing. He looked pained. “Stop this, John. You haven’t been terrible to me, quite the contrary.”
her, whipped his head around, jaw dropping and face turning crimson. “Fuck!” He got off Mary, but it was too late. Sherlock had seen his broad shoulders, muscular back, bare arse, and the back of his sack. If he were to ever see those parts of John, he didn’t think it would have been like this. He couldn’t tear his eyes away from the glimpse he got of John’s testicles. If he weren’t so shocked, his mouth would have watered.
You’ll do fine, I know it, please touch me.”
Irene stared up at Sherlock, eyes interested. “I thought there was something different about you,” she drawled. “You don’t look so good, Sherlock,” she said without sympathy, only faint intrigue.
John was sitting in the corner of the sofa, leaning on the armrest with the blanket up to his chest, snickering at the garbage on the screen. Sherlock was sitting only a few inches away. He could feel the heat of John’s muscular thigh next to his under the quilt. He was distinctly aware of this, and was trying to inch closer to John, slowly, so their legs would casually touch. Perhaps it wasn’t right of him, trying to touch John when he was in an argument with his wife, but Sherlock had no plans to go beyond touching his leg. He just wanted to make some contact, just the tiniest bit. He didn’t want to try anything with John tonight, not when he was upset, and not when his plan was in shambles.
She answered it, wearing makeup and a dress and looking like she had been up for awhile. “Hello, John!” she smiled. “I didn’t expect to see you again so soon.”
Well, why couldn’t he? As long as Sherlock didn’t protest…
under his breath.
“Of course,” she said, frowning. “I’m down here if you need me.”
Confirmation that Baker Street was his true home was something John wanted to hear for years. He cleared his throat. “Yeah,” he said thickly, “you’re right.”
“John?” he rasped, his eyes fluttering open.
Sherlock thrust into John’s hand, letting out a strangled moan. John’s hand was so warm and tight but not too tight and god, he wished he could think clearly to savor all of these details, but his mind was pudding. He was breathing hard and his skin felt hot and damp with sweat, and Sherlock pumped his hips so roughly that he actually rocked John’s body in the process
Sherlock’s lip wobbled. “Yes.”
“I guess you weren’t, then,” he rolled his eyes. “I was...well, you know I only remember you from 2012, so I was asking...you really want a relationship?” he asked with a self-conscious look on his face. “I can’t picture you wanting any of what a marriage entails.”
“Cheeky,” John muttered, pinching his cheek for emphasis.
John lay down. He
He focused on the television and let himself get wrapped up in the show, and before he knew it, two episodes passed by. When his mind wasn’t spiraling out of control, Sherlock did enjoy a bit of down time, and he thought there was no better way to spend it than with John. This was actually nice, he thought. He was watching something he actually sort of liked, Mrs. Hudson’s quilt was like a comforting, soft cocoon around his body, and there was John, beautiful John, relaxed next to him, his strong body radiating warmth onto his, and the enticing smell of his cologne was in Sherlock’s nostrils.
They were on the sofa together, and John remembered how much Sherlock liked his neck kissed and sucked. He had the same reaction in this world, trembling and struggling to hold back his groans, clinging to John. His mouth opened in a gasp when John bit his neck, and he grew hard in his trousers. His lips were moist and swollen from kisses, eyes black with arousal.
It all hit him like a ton of bricks. John jumped up in the bed and looked down at himself, confirming that he was still dressed in his suit from the previous night. He put his hand over his racing heart, looking wildly around the bedroom. He was still here. He was still in this timeline at Baker Street. He went to sleep--he know he did. He could taste the sourness of his morning breath. This had to be real, then, even though he had no fucking idea how any of this was possible. He couldn’t be crazy since this was reality, right? This couldn’t be one big hallucination if he woke up in the exact same situation. He thought that was how these things worked, at least.
he thought,
John’s arm curled tighter around him. “I might’ve failed you by letting her hurt you, but I’ll always be there for you.
found on the losing side. He thought his actions spoke louder than his words, though.
John nodded again, the spoken permission from the person he hurt to move on feeling like a balm on his wounds. “I’ll try,” he vowed.
But Sherlock knew the answer, and he was part of it. He had to stop thinking about this. He was going to make his distress obvious.
“I’ve missed you,” John sighed, chin resting on his shoulder.
John felt his face flush. God, he really was a mess earlier, wasn’t he? He would have been more ashamed about it, if he hadn’t already cried in Sherlock’s arms in his timeline. Upon recalling that memory, he felt the sudden urge to hug Sherlock, but held it back. He didn’t know how this Sherlock would react. But, the thing that stuck out to John was how genuinely guilty Sherlock seemed over everything, especially upsetting him, and it wasn’t totally fair, because John was crying over
“Sorry,” Sherlock whispered, slowing down a little.
John took a few steps forward, clearing his throat, grateful for Rosie’s warm, solid presence against his chest. “This is my daughter,” he said woodenly. The last time he saw Irene Adler, it was before the Fall. Before he got married. Before Sherlock got shot. Before he became a father. Before the Culverton Smith case--
John took off his jacket and shoes and joined him. He turned on his side and held out his arms, eyes growing wet again. “Come here.”
John was skeptical. “If, one day, I’d gone up to you and kissed you, how would you have reacted?”
She didn’t buy it. “I wish you’d said something earlier instead of getting in your own bloody head and breaking up with me after taking me out to dinner!”
John quickly ate his breakfast, relieved to have food in his stomach again. Afterwards, he leaned his head back in the chair, and let the sound of Sherlock’s soft snoring drag him into a much-needed rest.
over. Mary had seemed defeated. She said multiple times that she left the assassin life behind her, which was nonsense considering the Magnussen debacle, but perhaps, in her twisted mind, she really meant it.
“Other than an occasional call from the Yard, what do you do?” she asked accusingly.
“I was worried,” he admitted. “It was a close call. I’d never been that injured before.”
John hugged him, their heaving chests pressed together. He swallowed, gathering his breath. “Sherlock?” he whispered.
Sherlock stiffened, eyebrow rising on his forehead.
The question felt like a jab to his heart.
“Baker Street,” John said weakly, and his tone fit with the winded expression on his face. “We need to have a long talk. We’re not doing it here or in a cab,” he said firmly.
“You’re telling me.” He scratched the back of his neck. “But, would you forgive me, if that happened?”
“We have quite a lot of information,” he said defensively, “however, she was sufficient at covering her tracks, most of the time.”
“Yeah, eventually, but my dreams were having a child with a woman. Ah, no,” John reached out and put a hand on his knee, “don’t look like that. I didn’t mean it that way. I just meant that I’d think my life goals would have changed once we got together, not just because of the type of person you are, but because of our work. Is Mrs. Hudson really okay with watching her while we’re gone? She’s not as young as she used to be.”
“Should we tell Molly? I think I will,” he said when Sherlock made a face. “She watched Rosie so much for me when--” he stopped. “You know.” He felt Irene’s eyes on him. When Molly was caring for Rosie, that was when he wrote that atrocious letter to Sherlock. God, he couldn’t think about that now. “Anyway, I’ll text her tonight.”
“I know,” he kissed his shoulder. “How do you feel about this, by the way?”
and a laugh. “I thought I was the limpet in the relationship,” he joked.
John put his hands on top of the table, folding them. “Listen, Mary--”
“But look at you,” John croaked. He cleared his throat. “You’re battered and bruised and she almost choked you to death.”
Sherlock sighed, scratching the back of his neck. “What is it that you want, Mrs. Hudson?”
“Let’s stop hurting each other,” John said with determination.
“Yes, yes, I know, I already sent a write up of my findings to your email. Do keep up.” He pushed his hair back from his forehead. “Will that be all? All right, goodbye.” He hung up, putting his phone down on the bed. He smiled. “That was nice,” he clapped his hands together. “Unfortunately, it only took us an afternoon, but we’ve had far more tedious endeavors.”
“I think we should celebrate.”
John poured a small amount of alcohol on a cotton ball and took Sherlock’s hand again, softly wiping at his cuts.
“Rosie, I know it’s Peppa.” He sat up, then laid back on the carpet, staring at the ceiling. “Even after last night, she’s still important to him. I guess I can’t blame him. After that night in Magnussen’s office, I stayed with Mary...”
“I think I was going to file for a divorce before it happened, and felt guilty. I dunno, it’s fuzzy,” he lied.
“Somewhat,” he gave a humorless laugh. “It’s frustrating, but I guess it’ll all return eventually. Not all the memories are pleasant, either.” Normally, John wouldn’t admit something like that to anyone but Sherlock, but he was still tipsy.
Sherlock swallowed. He didn’t find her tone very favorable. “Well, why not?” he asked defensively. “Why is it hard to believe he’d think that?”
“Whose fault is that?”
“You can’t do that once she starts spelling, either.”
“You’re an adult; she’s a baby. I would never put a child in harm’s way.”
Like I said, I really don't know how long this will be since Sherlock can't keep it up forever, but I'm going to write for as long as this is relatively plausible lol
He wished he knew how. He never let himself go completely in front of anyone before, not during sex, and he was scared of it.
“Unfortunately, I do owe him for that,” he said.
That made Sherlock grin a little.
With his suspicion confirmed, John cursed. “Jesus fucking Christ--”
“No, you’re not. I hurt you
John’s head whipped around.
Sherlock shook his head roughly, visibly frustrated. “I let you talk and talk because our friendship had just recovered, but I can’t take your moronic delusions anymore. You thought she would make me happy? Have I ever given that impression?”
Hey, sorry for the kind of late update, but I'm back in school again.
“Or phone or wallet,” he added, sniffing. “Give me another drink.”
with being hung up on Mary. He was tired of thinking about her. He was tired of acting as if Sherlock were not a better human being a million times over!
“Oh, he does that sometimes.”
John looked down at himself, and he had a noticeable bulge, too. He cleared his throat, head spinning, moving his hand away from his chest. “It’s okay, Sherlock.”
Culverton was looking at him curiously. “Why are you here?” he asked, and seemed genuinely confused. “It’s like you walked into my den and laid down in front of me.”
John cleared his throat. “Yeah.”
he thought.
“I told you,” Sherlock cut in sternly, the fire back in his eyes, “I did not want you in any form of danger.”
“Frot away, you lovely man,” John stifled the rest of his giggles. Sherlock started kissing him, running his warm hands down his body, pulling his jumper over his head. If John were honest, it was a little weird at first, letting a man take over. John was always used to being in charge in bed. Sherlock was physically larger than he in (almost) every way, and for the first time, he was hovering over John. It would have been overwhelming, if Sherlock weren’t humping his thigh like a teenager after three minutes of kissing. John had no problem with it, though, and was undressing as fast as he could, kissing Sherlock back blindly, shivering as he touched and explored and fucking deduced.
If she were any other person, Sherlock thought that he would have felt a tad sorry for her. Although she was selfish, Sherlock knew that Mary did love John, and Sherlock knew how painful it felt to have unrequited feelings for John Watson.
John’s brow furrowed, and he looked at the note, and then at Sherlock.
Sorry for not updating for months, but I wrote more stories for Good Omens (I have a fake relationship WIP right now, so check that out of you like the show :P). It was weird coming back to this after 3 months, but I hope it's okay. I want to wrap this up in another couple chapters. I'm still a johnlock hoe, but I'm not super motivated to write during this long hiatus :/ Thank you for sticking with this, though.
Heeeeeeeeeey folks. This chapter is a little longer than usual, but I'm not sure if that's a good thing? This feels like a ramble, but it was the best I could do.
He was crying? Maybe. “It’s--a lot,” he admitted. “I thought you never wanted to see me again, and now--”
Sherlock was gritting his teeth, a deep furrow in his brow, and his eyelashes were quivering.
“I think it’s better than her current name.”
"How do you know?"
“Who’s Magnussen?” Sherlock asked.
Could he do anything right?
“I’m glad to see you eating,” John said through bites of food. “You look thinner than I remember.”
She was glaring, but her eyes weren’t on John. “You remember our agreement,” she said coldly. “Give us privacy.”
“Rude,” Sherlock grumbled.
Sherlock sighed, shoulders slumping, walking so he was standing directly in front of John. From here, the cut by his eyebrow was more visible, along with the fatigue in his eyes. He put his hands in the pockets of his dressing gown. “I apologize for that, John. I realize how uncomfortable her question must have been for you.”
“So, I think it’s best if you crash here for the night,” Lestrade rubbed his jaw. “You can figure out what you’re going to do tomorrow, ’cause I don’t think you’re in a state to be thinking about what you’re going to do or not do with Sherlock.”
“Yeah. Um.”
she wanted to work through everything, not when her past caught up to her and she abandoned him to hunt down Ajay. “There isn’t really a problem,” he lied. “I don’t think we’d be compatible for any real long-term relationship.”
As a side note, my cousin did decide to put her foot on top of her miniature cake on her 1st birthday like Rosie here :P
His lip twitched.
“It’s okay,” John whispered in his ear. “You’re safe now. I won’t let her hurt you anymore,” his voice cracked at the end. His warm hand ran down Sherlock’s back. “Am I hurting you?”
“Oh!” Mrs. Hudson exclaimed.
“Because I know it can bring happiness, and I want you to be happy. Because I’m your friend.” His skin was on fire. “So. Just thought you should know,” he finished with an awkward nod.
John held the towel with one hand, and licked his lips when he put his other hand around the doorknob. “I’m coming in,” he warned Sherlock, and opened the door, hoping he didn’t see a naked Sherlock because, god, he didn’t know if he would be able to take that.
Putting his own feelings aside, he made it up to her that night by playing with her and her new toys. She seemed to like the Winnie the Pooh plush the most. Late at night, he was holding her against his chest as she slept in her new pajamas from Molly. “You were the only good thing that came from Mary,” he whispered. “I’m still sorry for cutting your birthday short.”
Some of the tension eased from the corners of Sherlock’s mouth, intrigued.
The next day, John was walking upstairs from dropping Rosie off at Mrs. Hudson’s for a couple hours (she insisted that she wanted to spend time with her and be like a grandmother figure, and John was more than fine with that) and heard the sweet sound of Sherlock’s violin. John smiled and walked into the flat, shutting the door quietly behind him.
John didn’t know what to say.
“Where are you going?” John asked.
For a brief moment, he entertained the fantasy of him and John actually being in a relationship, living together at 221B again. He would come home to John with the bouquet as a surprise, and he thought of John’s eyes lighting up and a smile blooming on his face, the corners of his eyes crinkling. Sherlock imagined John walking up to him, standing on his toes and planting a firm kiss on his lips, and thanking him for the roses, saying he was a great partner, and rewarding Sherlock by taking him to bed.
The cabbie looked back at him through the rearview mirror. “You all right, sir?”
It's the end, my friends
“It could have been better,” he said, shifting so they could look at each other in the darkness. “It was a little boring, honestly,” he said, lips close to John’s.
“I was the one who kissed you; don’t you think so?”
he asked himself internally. He was 42 years-old, turning 43 next month, and he felt like everything went irreversibly wrong. He was nearly middle-aged, damn it, and he felt like a failure. His marriage was an absolute disaster from start to finish, he was barely married for a year before he was unfaithful, and he screwed things up with his best friend.
It took John a second, but then it clicked. He only knew Irene was alive from when she texted Sherlock after the Culverton case. He stood up, putting his hands in his pockets, not sure how to lie.
He tried not to think of Sherlock, but of course he was the only thing on his mind. Whatever. He had to adjust to the new normal now. He made his bed and now had to lie in it. John went to take another drink from the bottle, but it was empty. He placed it on the cushion next to him and sighed heavily, feeling weary from head to toe, although he did nothing but sit around for days. He looked at the clock on the wall. He had several more hours of doing nothing until he had to get Rosie, and then he had to be semi-functional for her. He would let himself sit there and stare into space until then.
