John turns around swiftly, resting his back against the bridge’s railing. His palms cover his eyes in frustration again.
Of course, the two of them are also itching to have the other all to themselves. Another night in the village suddenly seems like a lifetime before they get a chance to do the things they’d like to do to each other.
“Now, Dr. Watson.” Mycroft drolls, irritated. “Before it’s too late for either of you. Speaker, please.”
John’s eyes widen in shock, his jaw slack.
“After your wedding.” Alexander says and looks at John.  “I was so upset over his injury. I realized he could have died. I told him how I felt and we…”
John smiles a bright, proud smile as he walks away. “Try singing. She loves that!”
He reads with relief and feels a semblance of control return to him. A bit more at ease now, he starts Googling, reading local news.
“What?”
“Is it?” David wobbles around, a crooked smile on his face.
. Now, if you’ll excuse me,
“I have. I have Sherlock, and yesterday was so important to me. I thought I’d come here today so we could talk. But now you spring all of this... A year, Sherlock?”
“I never said there was. But his stories, they almost sound as though they’re rehearsed,” Sherlock says. “As though he’s telling people exactly what they want to hear. You see, they change. The things he told me, the things he told Alison, Jonathan’s sister. They’re all variations on a very questionable truth.”
They’re both silent.
“Professionals? They weren’t there. None of these bastards were there,” David says and points at the door, talking about his friends. “There is one person who knew what it was actually like there, and I just spoke at his memorial.”
“Maybe I will,” David says, flapping the note. “Captain Calpin.”
, he thinks, as Mrs. Hudson places the baby in his arms, positioning her.
One morning, she’s preparing to leave the house early, citing a postnatal gynecological checkup she’s been neglecting while away. John’s feeding Rosie. Mary’s talking about appointments and errands. His face transforms into a frown, chewing on his inner cheek in disbelief.
“Yes, extortion. That’s his MO. He used them to extort you for your loyalty.” Sherlock huffs. “That’s ironic.”
Regrettably, Sherlock has a way of convincing (
“John was there. He flushed it all down the toilet,” Sherlock says with a faux-angry smile.
"No," Sherlock says. "Just like you, I trust Ella and can see the changes in John. I don't feel unsafe these days... or unequipped."
“Hmmm.” Sherlock hums. “I always wondered. Does Three Continents imply having sex in three continents or having sex with people originating from three different continents?”
His friend bruised his face and his ribs, the wounds still visible and aching. A friend who hadn't bothered to apologize for inflicting any of this on him.
work,
“Forget it,” she sighed again and shook her head. “I’m just so bloody tired.”
“We were ah...we were supposed to meet up. For dinner. But I called and cancelled at the last minute. Ah.. Couldn’t go. He was in a bar or a pub, someplace crowded. He didn’t sound drunk or anything.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Could you keep it down?”
“I raised that with Sherlock quite early on in the process. I asked him if he’d be interested in exploring that, investigating that. He agreed.”
“Goodbye, Dr. Watson.”
“It’s alright. It’s… beige. All flats seem very beige to me these days. But it’s alright, if terribly expensive. I have to use Mary’s savings to afford it,” John laughs. “Not a day goes by without thinking it’s smaller than Baker Street yet so much more costly. Doesn’t even come with a landlady that bakes cookies.” These last words bring a smile to Sherlock’s face, John notes with relief.
It’s not a crime scene. He sees Sherlock’s face and, behind it,
John feels the need to belong, to make himself a part of the experience. He picks up his phone and aims for a selfie that includes himself, Rosie, and the YouTube video. Later when he’s in bed, he attaches the photo to a text.
“He does that a few times a day.” Sherlock nods and juts his chin towards the screen. “Goes up to the attic for five minutes, sometimes more, sometimes less.”
“It was small and... claustrophobic…” Sherlock fights to keep his train of thought as David’s tongue finds his carotid. “And you were having nightmares—”
Sort of. She still resents John for… well, for not being Sherlock, he supposes.
Jonathan is dead. Nadi is dead. Who’s left? Aldridge? He’s a drunk, damaged man who lost all credibility years ago. He’s also trapped in a terrible catch twenty-two; if Aldridge ever lets on that he allowed David and Jonathan go on observation duty together that night, he’ll go straight down with David.
“Give me the keys, John,” Sherlock urges him. “I’ll drive.”
“Mm.”
“Nothing particular right now,” she says. “We just need some good headshots. Still finalizing everything else.”
"Yes. Yes, must have been, through that window." John nodded, demonstrating yet again just how much of a bad liar he was.
“See ya!” Mary calls out cheerily, eyeing the woman impatiently as she closes the office door behind her. She tears the envelope open in a hurry, her heart beating in her throat. Inside, she finds a blank, white key card and a short set of instructions printed in fine letters on a piece of office paper.
Rosie is oblivious to the man’s mood. She follows Sherlock around the flat like a duckling, vying for his attention. He heads for his bedroom for a change of clothes as Rosie toddles behind him and waits by the closed door. John looks at this interaction, amused despite the grim mood in the flat. He supposes following Sherlock around is what Watsons are programmed to do.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m… sorry, I’m in the wrong place.” Mary moves to turn on her heels, her brow furrowed.
“Shut up.” John murmurs. He thrusts Sherlock against the kitchen counter and aligns his own body against Sherlock’s. “Just.. shut up.”
Although it may be kind, it still is a lie. This is not the sort of information one is likely to overlook or misremember.
“Yeah, good,” John says and looks around, searching for something more comfortable to spend the next few hours on. The bed beckons; he gives in to the siren call of a soft mattress now that he’s been tasked with hours worth of reading materials.
for John, how can you even...”
“Rosie,” John clarifies. “I need a piss before we leave. Watch her for me?”
“There were hard moments. We’d argue. Sherlock kept tabs on her location, wanting to go and retrieve her. I didn’t. I kept telling him she’ll come back if and when she wants to. I wasn’t keen on dragging her back.”
Either someone tipped them off or he was doing a bang up job and they’re afraid, noticing the trail of destruction he’s been leaving behind him.
“And if you found something you needed in him… whatever you want to call it. Comfort, or… friendship… and talking to him made things better than I guess, that’s good.” John speaks through his teeth. “Yeah. it’s good. You both went through something I never… and I just assumed—you seem so unfazed by everything, and I chose to play along with that, when I should have listened and…”
“Mine?”
The video stops, and darkness falls over the attic again.
He laughs out loud at the surreal image as Lestrade, an eye patch covering his eye, tilts his head towards the group, laughing as well, as if saying
“Never said I didn’t want it. It was… good.” Sherlock confesses. He feels more than sees John’s head turning quickly back in his direction.
“I’m not dismissing how it must have felt for you, growing up. Not at all.” John continues. “But I’d been down that road when Mary died. I looked at Rosie and I felt nothing for her. I felt like a ghost. Thank god she was too young to remember but if it wasn’t for-- I’m not sure I would be a much better parent today.”
“I’m not,” David says, drawing a raised eyebrow from Sherlock. “It’s time for a fresh start.”
The impact of Sherlock’s words knock every last bit of air from John’s lungs.
“Or some other baby store, I don’t care which.”
John looks away as he considers his words carefully.
“I’d like to talk about Mary,” David pronounces. He’s about as gentle as an elephant in a china shop.
John can’t hear what they’re saying; the sounds are jumbled through the headphones, but he can read David’s body language. The man flops heavily on a chair as soon as they enter and his wife drops the bags. She approaches him hurriedly, rubbing his back.
John sighs, and this time Sherlock joins him.
Unfortunately for the photographer, his rampant enthusiasm attracted the attention of the idiotic local police. It wasn't until they hit a dead end in their own investigation - if one should call bungling in confusion 'investigating' - that they contacted London. That's how Lestrade got involved. Sherlock had been recovering for months when the DI called. He and John had been ensconced in the flat in their usual solitary confinement, John acting as a human shield against any requests for Sherlock’s attention and time for the sake of healing.
“Was John there a lot at the time?”
“Of course not, Sherlock. Come on.” John says, surprised by the questioning.
John’s smile could light up the entire City of London. “Let’s go.”
“Why do you do that?” Sherlock asks, his jaw clenched tightly.
The whole thing feels like an out of body experience; like a slow-motion video, the words odd and indistinguishable.
David takes the note, confused for a beat, then looks up at John with sharp, penetrating eyes. They look like the eyes of a completely different person; not the helpless soldier who was just holding onto the wall, hyperventilating.
John spends the morning alone with Rosie in the sitting room, playing and reading to her. He sneaks a glance out the big windows every once in a while, hoping to catch Sherlock’s silhouette as he approaches the house. He never sees or hears Mrs. Holmes or Mycroft the entire time.
His most striking feature, though, is a thick, salt-and-pepper beard; Sherlock wonders whether this is the unfortunate result of the man’s total disregard for his looks, or simply a useful tool in his profession as he trudges through modern cities inundated with CCTV cameras.
“All done,” she says, twisting the lid on the powdery stuff. “Off you go.”
“Will do, guv.”
’,” he says, running a hand through his hair uncomfortably, “is working on an exposé showing that your own ancestors wouldn't have passed the merit test going back four generations.”
John takes in the strange sight from the bed, surreptitiously watching one man as he watches another.
“All right. Enough about Mary for now,” John says eventually when the uncomfortable silence returns and lingers for far too long. “Your turn. How many languages do you speak?”
“Only in Gaza, though,” David says. “Not in Afghanistan.”
“It’s where he’s been spending his days since returning.”
“Goodbye, David.” Sherlock disconnects the call, his heart beating a hundred miles per hour. He takes a deep breath, struggling to regain his composure. It’s only then that silence in the room grabs his attention. John isn’t snoring softly anymore.
John Watson was climbing the stairs to 221B one Monday afternoon.
’ in choked frustration over the sound of his own thundering heartbeats.
And there they are again. Those eyes—David’s eyes—sharp, all-seeing, assertive. As close as they’ve ever been since Frankfurt.
Mycroft nods slightly and turns to John. “All right.” He says. “You’ll get it back at our parents’ house tomorrow.”
Nothing he can’t work with.
“Share any classified information,” David cuts him off dryly. “I get it.”
“Yeah.” The assistant nods, impressed. “It’s been that way for months. To be honest, I’ll be starting a new job very soon, I figured I’m about to be fired soon anyway so what have I got to lose, you know?”
“I appreciate it. Might need a pair of gloves once winter comes. I hope you’ll be getting a new batch soon.”
He lowers his hand to grab Sherlock’s palm and places it on his own waist, urging him to touch him back.
“Saul, please. I’m afraid that’s impossible,” the man says. “Where she’s embedded right now, we’re reserving communication for emergencies only.”
“Well, your various versions of the truth have more holes in them than a sieve, for starters.”
), red cheeked and determined as he approaches the single bench in the entire plaza, where Elin is waiting for him. Wiggins does as instructed and rounds the fountain, pretending to be out of breath and holding his side as he sits as close to them as possible.
“John—”
John wakes from a dreamless doze some thirty minutes later to the sound of a mumbling Sherlock. He’s perched in his chair in front of the screens sipping tea, watching David in his nightly ritual. Much like John, and despite the nine years he’d spent in enemy hands, David is a soldier through and through. He still goes by his evening routine as if he’s in an army barrack somewhere deep in the Middle East.
“Good,” John says.
“Oh, shut it.” She swats his shoulder playfully, a warm smile spreading slowly across her face.
“I'll decide that.”
“A new job?” Sherlock asks. “She left the surgery?”
Sherlock doesn’t say a word back, only struts hurriedly towards the waiting car.
“That’s too bad. You made it sound as though she’d turned your life around after you came back.”
“I dare say she was even a friend.” John teases and Sherlock smiles at the table. “Was Amit a friend as well? Is that her brother?”
David nods before he speaks. “That’s quite common, Sherlock, for a widower to take their ring off. It signals the end of the emotional attachment to their loved one. It means they’ve moved on.”
“Because I asked you if you understood and you said that you did. Was that a lie, Sherlock?”
“Terrifying?”
She’s a client. He knows she is. When the woman follows another woman’s finger pointing up at 221, Sherlock’s back straightens immediately, sending jets of adrenaline through his convalescing body.
“Yeah.” John nods, looking around. “Yeah. Er, let me find—”
“Why are you laughing, John?”
“He said… he said Aldridge was dangerous. He called me especially to warn me.”
John’s brain freezes as he thinks back to every man he ever passed by in the club. Then he realizes he has no idea where Sherlock learned about his army nickname, so he deflects the conversation away from any friends of Mycroft’s who once kissed Sherlock Holmes, holding that thought for later.
John laughed heartily. "Your parents sound like really cool people."
Dread began to creep down over Wanda's body like a thick, eerie fog rolling in over the ocean. "Hal, did something happen tonight at The Big H?" She and John exchanged worried glances, and John's stomach began to tighten.
Sherlock admires John's wardrobe.
Sylvia kissed her forehead. "That's my girl. Maybe you can call one of your friends to come over."
He had been out riding, checking out the town, utterly trying not to be bored, when the big building with the red neon sign that displayed Roller-Rama in all its glowing glory, piqued his interest. Here, he could observe those that were going to be his classmates in the next few weeks. He could find out their secrets and their habits and file them away in what he dubbed his “mind palace,” if it was interesting enough. So he found a spot next to a cute little red car and stood near his bike, watching, biding his time. He was glad he did, when he spotted a short, fit, impossibly blond boy walk outside and lean against the building, gazing at the sky, looking like he had no cares in the world. He had the stereotypical, quintessential perfect All-American California dream look he read so much about, and he knew as he laid his multicolored eyes on him, he wanted. It was as simple as that.
Mycroft looked at Molly instead, but she shook her head. "Please do as my parents say Mycroft. It'll be easier for all of us."
Victor kissed John again, and the two went their separate ways, bubbling with happiness.
Warren turned his head from side to side. His mouth was hanging open, desperately fighting back a moan, the sensation becoming much too much. He desperately wanted to shout and come, but he knew he couldn't. This is what he agreed to, this is what he paid so much for, and he wasn't regretting any of it. John was amazing, both gentle and commanding at the same time. He would be definitely booking more sessions.
John cleared his throat. "I'm John Watson, and I'm going to go and mill around a bit. Bill, see you later?"
Sherlock studied John and the other man walking beside them. They were laughing and talking. They were definitely friends, but there was a hint it would be more.
after she nearly killed Harrison's best friend? I couldn't stand her and wanted her to die a painful death!"
Sherlock exhaled deeply and waited for John's response, looking at him dead on. He saw John's eyes widen and his mouth drop open, gaping like a fish and he wondered with baited breath what he would say or do.
John grinned and began to gently massage Warren's behind. Warren stifled a moan as John's tanned, calloused fingers worked his magic on the abused flesh.
"You just remember these are waiting for you, along with the rest of me," she teased.
*****
Sherlock wanted more. He knew he didn't deserve more. Who in their right mind would pursue a romantic relationship with someone that first tried to rape them? If he had acted like a normal human being towards John and simply asked him on a date, they wouldn't be apart. But Sherlock was not a normal human being and didn't do normal things like dates. Whenever he was with someone, they never went out to eat, or to the cinema, or hung out. It was heated couplings in cars, or beds, or anywhere private he could find.
"You lot from that office building? What happened, was there a gas leak?" she asked. Valerie shook her head. "Bomb threat got called into the law office on the second floor."
John came to stand right next to him. He glanced over at Sherlock, taking notice of his lean body and unusually handsome face. He was dressed as a pirate, and the knee-high black leather boots Sherlock sported were doing things to John's mind and groin. John had recently come out as bisexual, after a few short-term relationships with women that didn't go anywhere, and he was ready to explore and date a man. A guy that looked like Sherlock though, probably wouldn't be attracted to a short, ordinary person such as himself.
She left, and Mary stood up, now barefoot. "I'll need to call my mom and ask her to get me. Dad's off today and is using my car."
“Jesus, I had no idea she knew what that was. I’ll have to start buying less of it,” John replied, shaking his head.
*****
Irene followed his gaze towards the bar. "He's more than okay Molly. I think he's found his date for the evening," she replied with a grin. "Go get him tiger."
"To what?" Sherlock asked.
"Absolutely. "I wouldn't have met Jasmine if it wasn't for the internet." Rosie had met her soon-to-be-girlfriend on a Doctor Who Facebook fan page. "If I can, so can you."
Sherlock shook his head. "Don't be. I purchased the shirt with his credit card. He never knew I took it."
"Well for both our sake let's hope he's on his best behavior," Wanda steely replied.
"Oh yes. Let me get the menu and we can pick something out."
Sherlock nodded rapidly. "It was a husband and wife. The husband used to work for the power plant before he was fired for habitual tardiness. He was able to get into the plant, disguising himself as a janitor they rented for cleaning, and shut down all the grids for the city. While he did that, his wife was the one stabbing people to death."
"At least give him one date. If it ends up being a disaster, cut your losses and move on. I don't think it's going to be a disaster," Molly added.
The two stealthily made their way to the exit. Out in the parking lot, they saw Greg, along with several police officers. The suspect maintained his cool glare. Then a young brunette woman walked by, in a gold lame jumpsuit, heading towards the disco. She eyed the scene warily.
“Since when did you get a girlfriend Jimmy?” John asked, astonished. Jim was not one for dating, instead focused on his studies.
"I'll take the shirt, size medium."
(See the end of the chapter for
I got through the East coast nor'easter, and two more snowstorms are expected this week but enough about weather, here's a short but good chapter. We're gradually building up to the climax of the murder mystery.
John got, stretched his arms and legs, and took a deep breath, fragrant smells of flowers and sunshine pleasantly filling up his nostrils. He instantly felt calm and relaxed.
Sherlock laughed and kissed John. "He's a smart one already."
John grinned. "Thanks love. This is really thoughtful of you." He sat down on the sofa and took a drink. "Mmm, delicious. Even with my stuffy nose I can still smell the spices."
"Keep still soldier," John growled, continuing to apply more pressure. Warren's erection was now a mixture of purple and red, and it was twitching like crazy. John knew he was close to coming, but if he was going to be a successful dom, he had to delay it a little more.
He took a gulp and sat the glass down, sighing happily. "Delicious."
Greg frowned. "Why not? He seems like a decent bloke. He ate up your deductions like a kid would eat an ice cream cone. He's smitten, and so are you. Please don't tell me you're going to listen to that brother of yours and reject him. Love is a chemical defect, my arse."
"Do you suspect Wilkes of being the arsonist?" Kitty asked.
Mycroft was more reserved in his judgement. "That was most unique Mr. Watson."
Sherlock held up his glass. "When you say new beginnings, does that include us?"
"Hallie," Jeremy softly called.
John stepped inside the elegantly decorated flat. The living room was generously sized, with a large window that looked out into the street below. Warren had it decorated with an assortment of exotic figurines that sat on dark wooden shelves mounted into the cream colored wall. Tasteful black and white pictures of London hung on the walls, and a small flat-screen TV sat on a sleek, black stand against the wall.
(See the end of the chapter for
Regent's Park was also the scene for the brutal slaying of Carl Powers Jr. who was killed several weeks ago.
"Yeah, well I think this may be the start of something good. Doctor Watson seems to be a pretty decent guy."
Sherlock had just a hint of a smile on his lips, which were full and lovely. He wore a dark purple shirt with the sleeves rolled up. John was captivated by his toned arms and his long, creamy neck dotted with freckles. Not to mention, the shirt was a little tight so the buttons were straining. John imagined them popping open one by one.
But he knew he would never forgive himself if he didn't stop this madness, stop more people from dying, stop more dwellings from burning. He steeled himself, clenched his fists, then unclenched them. He smiled at Richard and said,
"Oh God, and I'm Juliet, right?" John groaned.
Sherlock pressed a kiss to John's hair. "You spoil me with these meals. I'm almost beginning to miss Angelo's lasagna."
"We're fine. We're two hours out and the snow is coming down pretty good so Sherlock and I found a bread and breakfast to stay at until the storm stops."
“Sure. I’d love to see who’s behind the wheel of that beauty.” Mary skated away, while John went to see Jim. Molly went back to wiping tables.
John saw a conch shell half buried in the sand. He bent down to collect it, brushing salt and grain away from it's pearly surface. He put it up to his ear and grinned. As a child, he always loved hearing the sound of the ocean floor inside them.
Sherlock held him tight and kissed his hair. "Well, the time to stop feeling low begins now. We have this delicious dinner to eat, and later, I'm going to prepare us a nice, warm bubble bath. Then I'm going to lay you down in our bed and worship every inch of you, as you should be." He gently caressed John's swollen belly. "You're carrying precious cargo in there, and doing an excellent job taking care of little Hudson Holmes-Watson."
A small group of citizens were standing across the street watching the investigation. He could see the looks of sadness and disbelief on their faces. One was taking pictures, obviously a newspaper photographer. He turned back to the task at hand.
Molly and Greg had pulled up alongside John. After John called Molly to let him know what happened, she and her new boyfriend had come to say goodbye. “John, please call me everyday while you’re in LA,” she said, grabbing to hug him.
"Good," Brett answered. "Dad's been a nervous wreck all week."
Mr. & Mrs. Holmes are modeled after Benedict's parents when they were younger. Looks only though, I'm definitely sure they weren't the unconcerned people they are in this story.
"I'll be there for them. But will they be there for me after they find out I was the one who told you?" A tear escaped from Henry's eye, and before he knew it, he was sobbing like a dam bursting from too much rain.
"I am," Molly replied cheerfully. She turned to the boys. How about you gentlemen?"
Molly sat at her vanity, brushing her hair, wearing a pale yellow nightgown when she heard a ping at her window, startling her. She set her brush down and padded over to the window, pulling back the white lace curtains. She looked down and saw Greg standing underneath it, holding pebbles in his hand. She slid open the glass panel and called down to him. "Greg, what are you doing here?"
"And people call me queer," Big Seb shot back. "Your little plot to spy on some skin is lame city. What if you get caught?"
"Ugh, don't remind me!" Sherlock groaned.
Sherlock kissed his ear. "You are useful to me at home. You're the only one that can quiet my mind and keep my focus sharp and clear. I work better with you. And I've also been thinking, that maybe it's time to stop working with the Yard, and go completely private."
Sebastian kept quiet, guilt and shame flooding over him like a wave in a sea storm. He hadn't made things easy for his mother. His temper, fighting with others in town (but that was mostly self defense from the tired onslaught of slurs about his sexual preference), and his attraction to younger boys---he knew it had taken a toll on her. She had to deal with a father who preferred men and he killed himself over it, now she had to deal with a gay son. He knew she loved him, but it was tough under all the scrutiny and outrage. He'd never thought she would try to kill herself and now he wondered how things would be and if his mother would ever be the same.
“No, but that could change, and any muscular blond man is a target right now. I want to make sure you are safe, and if it means involving Sherlock, well, so be it. For as skinny as he is, he’s very fit and can defend himself quite spectacularly.”
Wanda wasn’t stupid to know smaller towns had their own problems, but in less than a year John had been attacked by two different boys and while Sebastian was no longer a threat, she wasn’t sure about Sherlock Holmes. After John revealed that he and his siblings had made others in town uncomfortable, her first instinct was to send John to Los Angeles to stay with Harry and Clarence. John of course refused, his home was here, his friends were here, and as he said “I’m not going to give Sherlock Holmes the satisfaction that he scared me off.”
John laughed heartily. "That might just be an option."
"Yes. On your own at Regent's Park, or the old Belgrave mansion."
A gunshot stopped John in his tracks. "Mom! Hal!" he cried.
Sherlock chuckled again. "Sounds good to me."
She led him past the main dining area, which was dimly lit, and the small round tables had softly glowing white candles in the center, cased in frosted glass votive holders. Jazz music faintly played in the background; James recognized the tune; "Take Five" by the Dave Brubeck Quartet.
"What is your name and address?"
Alain Ducasse is a real restaurant in London. Meals can run $450 a person. I'll just stick to Red Lobster, thanks! 😃
John got his next cut ready and leaned into the mic. "All right, your Captain is back to keep you burning up with boogie fever! Speaking of boogie, let's all attend the Silver Convention! A double shot of disco with "Fly Robin Fly" and "Get up and Boogie! Let's get down, and that's an order! Your Captain has spoken!"
Irene laughed again and Molly smiled. "That would make sense, seeing how you handed Powers so well." Irene's pretty face turned serious. "No, I'm proposing that you join our little business, doing what Molly and I do."
John laughed. "I will. Thanks Hal."
Henry broke off the kiss and laughed. "Leave it to you to turn a serious conversation into something sexual."
"I'm just glad he's here. It wasn't the easiest pregnancy," Rosie said with a yawn.
Sherlock waved his hand dismissively. "Oh that? I had one of my homeless contacts cut the power off."
Sherlock pulled John towards him and soon the shorter boy was in his lap. John didn't protest. He was tired, and just wanted to sleep, but he fought it. He laid his head against Sherlock's chest. He felt long fingers massage his scalp, lips pressing kisses to his forehead, a cool hand reaching inside his shirt that started to rub his belly and chest, and heated whispers of "I love you" against his ear.
Victor didn’t want to look conspicuous, so he sneaked a quick glance towards the snack bar and saw Sherlock. He turned back to his friends, now feeling a little more uncomfortable. “He’s got what my brother calls a “rape face.”
Victor reached out to put his hand on top of John's, not saying anything, but letting the other man know he was there for him.
“Least one of us got lucky,” Sherlock muttered. He desperately needed a cigarette.
Sherlock couldn't help but preen like a proud peacock, and the jealousy he felt when he entered the arena dissipated. "I'm very lucky to have John."
"Wanda, you're going to have to tell John and there's no easy way to say it..."
John smiled, relieved, and pressed play on the machine. The Skater's Waltz started up and John carefully joined Sherlock, who held out his hand. John took it, and the two began to slowly skate on the pond.
“I’m not.”
Edwin blinks owlishly, waiting for him to catch up. “Do you agree with Mr Holmes? Did you get a sense the story might be fabricated?”
There’s a noise of disgust somewhere in the depth of Sherlock’s brain at the sheer idea.
was a true siege, and the documentary linked to here was both a stunning piece of Afghan war history for me, as well a tough reminder of what soldiers in Afghanistan had to endure. Though I never served in the British Army, I do have my own experience of military service and the details of the siege were shocking to learn. Please note - the soliders who were there in Musa Qala are true survivors, heroes, and though I used their story here I by no way mean any disrespect to them by placing David there with them. David is a made up character and implies nothing regarding the real soldiers who bravely fought there.
, somehow?”
John looks at the older man, wired and tubed. He’d only met him a handful of times but he liked him immediately. Sherlock has his mother’s piercing eyes and her sense of drama but everything else about him is clearly an inheritance from his father. The shape of their faces, the voluminous hair, the cheekbones. There’s even that rare crooked smile. John’s breath hitched the first he saw that smile on William’s face.
“He barely knew me.” John says.
“Now you get out of here and don’t ever show your face here again, do you hear me?” Aldridge says. “Or I’ll tell the press you and that wanker detective have been harassing a traumatized war veteran. Did you hear me?”
“Do I?”
“It’s alright,” Sherlock says. “Still rather… quiet. But John brings Rosie, and Rosie’s definitely not quiet. Clients come over. It’s… manageable. My new… ventures help.”
“Don’t know,” she shrugs, throwing his own words back at him. “What do I even know about these things?”
The problem is it’s not only David that Sherlock is getting a glimpse into going through this trove of documents.
The sound dies away, the moment gone. John comes up for air, rubbing his cheek against Sherlock’s.
“Oh, of course,” Henry says and nods at Alison. “I’ll be outside.”
“Man, that’s fab John! That gives me an excuse to come see you and hang at the beach.” Mike took a sip of his Coke and leaned into John. “Irene and her friend Kate were here last night while you were off, and Irene was going ape over a new family that moved in next door to her a few days ago. They’re British and very rich. A husband, wife, and three teenagers our age. Two boys and a girl. Irene went on and on about one of the boys. From how she described him, he seems like a real flutter bum. Dark hair, black as night, tall and lean, cheekbones you could cut diamonds on, with these unique eyes. She said the first time saw them they were blue, but the next day, they look green. Kind of how yours are dark blue, but then they look brown later. And his voice is real deep. Irene described it as pure sex. Maybe she can hook you up with him, huh? Irene said Kate was all over him like bee on honey and he rudely told her girls were not his area.” Mike nudged his friend and winked at him.
"How is the boy doing?" Sidney asked, unperturbed.
Greg had told John he got a friend who called himself a consulting detective who would be undercover at the disco smoking Discopath out. This friend was apparently a brilliant genius, who could tell you your life story by how you comb your hair or a piece of jewelry you wear. "If anyone can catch this jerk, it's Sherlock Holmes," Greg had said.
Sherlock sighed, a bit too dramatically. "All right, I'll offer my help. But I'm going to warn you now---if this is some ruse to get me to let my guard down because you want me to join Sheridan six feet under---I won't hesitate to tell everyone in this town what kind of person you really are and what you did to our brother. And your precious greaser Jimmy will be first to know."
A confrontation at The Big H leads to an unwanted late night visitor for John.
John would have to ask the next time he spoke to Sherlock. In the meantime, he had to get ready. He was going skating with Molly, Greg, Sarah, Bill, Janine, Mike, Mary, Little Seb, and Victor.
"You've never met a late-blooming omega. We've had less time to develop our submissive nature."
Another customer entered the store. John looked at them. "I'll be with you in just a moment. He went to the counter to do Sherlock's exchange. "Wear this shirt tonight okay?" he whispered.
Wanda looked at the clock on the wall. "It's almost seven-thirty young man. Time for you to be off to school, and me off to work. Are you coming home after school?"
"As much as I'd like to sit here and watch you do a slow burn for your golden boy, Jim and I have other plans." She leaned over and planted a kiss on her brother's cheek. "Until next time big brother." She got up and smoothed down her dress, leaving Sherlock alone. When she was out of sight, he wiped the wet spot on his cheekbone where Eurus had pecked him. It was probably a good idea for him to leave too. John hadn't talked to him all night, and he had felt out of place the entire time. He also stood up and began to head for the doors, the only other thing on his mind beside John was getting home and to the safe space of his bedroom.
"Mrs. H watching the kids?" Molly inquired.
Sherlock giggled at John's ending pun, and eagerly opened up the box. Inside lay a gold plated bee pin. It was obvious it wasn't plated with actual gold, but it was a beautiful piece of jewelry. Sherlock grinned brightly as he took it out to examine it.
“We just met Mrs. Smallwood.” She bit her lip, trying not to look at the tall ginger-haired boy with the piercing ice blue eyes. “Uh, my mom isn’t here yet, do you think I could wait inside until she comes?”
Sherlock had been intrigued by LA, what little he'd seen of it so far. He heard the tales of it being the place to make your dreams come true, and it was the land where all the beautiful people lived. Although his main focus was John, he was also eager to explore Hollywood, seeing what kind of people were actually here. His brain would enjoy unlocking all their secrets.
“Of course I am. Christmas is coming up. Someone needs to stop Mycroft from eating all that cake,” Sherlock says, moving quickly around the many items waiting to be packed. “When I come back…”
Taking a sip of his Sunday morning tea, John sits cross-legged on a rickety garden chair. Next to him is Rosie, squealing with delight playing inside her brand new Princess Castle. He spent hours cursing and frustrated building it. It appears that his ability to follow instructions has shrunk to IKEA levels, and the Princess Castle proved to be more challenging than anticipated. He remembers with some worry that he was left with some parts that did not belong anywhere, but Sherlock had assured him they weren't essential, however, and he is a genius, so...
They get up and change quickly, hurrying to go back to each other’s arms.
“Yeah, I suppose you’re right.” John says, surprised by Sherlock’s always-unique perspective on things. “Still, it can get overwhelming…”
Right before they left for Sherlock’s parents’ house, right before things had gone to hell yet again.
1...2...3...4...5..6…
They scatter across the room when they finally enter, broken into groups. John thinks it reflects this family’s sad state of affairs. Mrs. Holmes and her brother sit next to each other on one end, Mycroft stands ramrod straight in another. Sherlock sits down in the last remaining chair at the centre of the room. John, protective and nervous, stands right behind him with his arms crossed. He could be mistaken for Sherlock’s bodyguard. He isn’t bothered by that.
Sherlock chuckles. “Do you think I should go, then?”
“Anthea will do nothing, Sherlock,” John plants his legs firmly on the ground. “I either work on this with you or not at all.”
“It would seem so.”
I know exactly what you mean, John. We tend to repeat our patterns, don't we? Because when Mary comes back, playing house won’t be enough anymore. I'll have to send you back again. And if it won't be Mary, it'll just be somebody else. Don’t ask me to go through that again, John."
This is the only chance he will ever get to do this ever again. He’s a selfish man and he’ll take this, memorize it in his brain and will never, ever delete the sensation of being engulfed by John in the throes of his passion.
“Yes,” Sherlock insists. “A car. Pocket money.”
”) and Sherlock’s plans for the next few days.
We can all agree I'm capable of writing fics by now, by I still suck at maths 🤷. The chapter count for Part I was incredibly ambitious at 30, but the truth is that I won't need 30 chapters for it. I updated the chapter count and I think Part I will end in about 3-4 chapters. Just so you know.
“What’s that?” he asks, distracted.
“We’re not.”
“Were there other times you felt like that?”
“Whatever you want. I’m up for anything. Think about it while you’re still there and tell me everything when you’re back,” John says. “There are no wrong answers, I promise.”
“Right.” Lestrade sighs. “Listen, Sherlock. It’s been a long day and it sounds like you have other places to be. Go and do what you need, I’ll keep my ear to the ground for the rest of the evening. I’ll call if anything comes up.”
Sherlock leaves the newspaper he’s been pouring over all afternoon neatly tucked and folded under his pillow, guiltily. He’s not entirely sure why he’s been feeling so guilty, though. The monstrous, detailed article has rather put his mind at ease.
John nearly snorts at the mere
“Sherlock?” David asks. Sherlock doesn’t respond.
Sherlock spends the rest of the afternoon wondering whether anyone might find sibling defenestration an objectionable holiday gift.
“Give us a twirl,” he says, pushing down that last thought. She frowns, then relents, finishing off with a little curtsy. “Nobody will be looking at me at the gala, that’s for sure.”
Sherlock clears his throat.
“Yes, again.”
20 minutes later, Sherlock walks up the street towards 221B. John and Rosie have been watching for him from the window. He’s alone, his face inscrutable. When he spots them he switches to a light jog that turns into skipping up the stairs.

“What?”
He’s still distracted when they open their presents (
“Perfect.” John says as he pats the bench. “Wait here. Cover yourself with that.” He throws the blanket at Sherlock.
And they sleep, at home in each other’s arms at last, just like that.
“Men.” John completes the sense.
“That’s not what I mean and you know it.”
The list goes on and on. Scattered inside the envelope are other things: note sheets stapled together, simply titled “John” (
They go up to the master bedroom, their images moving from one screen to another.
“How? Wouldn’t you find traces of someone else in the room?”
John smiles proudly at Sherlock, always delighted when others recognize Sherlock's genius.
“You’re welcome. I like chocolate too.” James says and turns to look at Sherlock. “I need to thank you again, Mr. Holmes. You saved me far too many times.”
John tips over to look at the paper Sherlock was asked to sign. When he’s done reading it he nods back to the other man. He whispers for Sherlock’s ears only and squeezes his shoulder.
“Alright.” John’s stuck where he stands, unable to move. He’s been dismissed but he doesn’t want to leave. “Is there any point of me staying here right now?”
He can’t blame Sherlock for shutting him out last night over his harsh words about love. The accusation was cruel, condescending. It’s a trap John unfailingly falls into, every time his heartache meets Sherlock’s wall of indecipherable indifference. It’s frustration, plain and simple, and it’s always directed unfairly at the one man who doesn’t deserve it.
“Care for a drink then?”
He wanted John to be sitting beside him and swimming with him in the pool. He wanted to play music for John on his violin. He wanted to show John his collection of pirate memorabilia. He wanted John on his bed to kiss and cuddle with. It was never going to happen, all thanks to his arrogance and ignorance. He'd have to settle for longing glances in the hallways of his new school, and he was going to make those glances
John nodded, trying to reassure himself. "You're right. So let's enjoy the rest of this beautiful summer day."
Clothing leads to an A&E visit. Alternate first meeting story inspired by "A Rash Decision" by Pat Precieux.
"This is so much fun!" Brett exclaimed as the carousel spun around. He was riding a brown horse. Sherlock sat next to him on a black horse. John was standing in front of him with a secure arm around Rosie, who was on a white unicorn. Sherlock couldn't help but stare at John's pert behind which his dark jeans was accentuating quite nicely.
"Hey Dave, long time no see," Harold said, putting the magazine in his lap.
John's mouth fell open. "What? Are you yanking my chain?" he asked incredulously.
"Molly, did you see anything out of the ordinary yesterday?" Sylvia asked her daughter.
Police cars and an ambulance were in front of the sprawling Wilkes mansion. Paramedics were bringing out Jeff Hope, lying on a stretcher under a white sheet stained with blood.
Wanda set her fork down. "Just you two?"
"My arguing with you was beautiful? I don't understand." John scratched the back of his neck, a habit he'd picked up when he sometimes was confused.
"Well, I thought about your offer and I've decided to come work for you."
Henry just shrugged. "Whatever makes you happy," he said, and quickly moved past the other teens into the house so he could set the pizza down. He secretly thought it was stupid, but he wasn't going to say it to Carl's face. The older boy had no qualms practicing his award-winning wrestling moves on others if need be.
remember it, and promptly hung up. Principal Saxon remained calm and called the police, and announced over the loudspeaker school was being dismissed early due to an emergency, and for no one to panic, and exit through the closest door. Students were not to go to their lockers, to leave with what they had on them. Staff would exit with students, and once the emergency was dealt with, custodians would lock all doors and make rounds. Any student that rode a bus, if they could walk home or get a ride with a friend, to do that, or walk to the nearest safe location, which was the Big H parking lot, and he and the secretaries would direct the buses to pick children up there.
Greg sat down next to Sherlock. "How does it fit in thought? Our first two victims regularly visited male escorts. The guy you're stalking is a sex worker providing the service. The killer is probably a sex worker."
John had sent him a song he wanted Sherlock to listen to before he arrived. It was a fast dance song that sounded straight from the 80's, the only instruments a drum machine and synthesizer, and the vocals sounded almost robotic. It definitely wasn't Sherlock's cup of tea, but it was the lyrics that brought it home. The man was singing about anticipating a rendezvous with his lover.
Harold turned towards Jeremy's face. "Hey," he said.
"Yeah?" His voice was hopeful.
James approached the hostess station. An attractive platinum blonde in her late 20's sporting an impressive bouffant hairdo and wearing a silver sparkly strapless flared dress stood there, eyeing the policeman up and down like she was looking at an item to place a bid on at an auction. An appreciative smile appeared on her bright red lips.
"They have a son, Sebastian. He likes to go after young teenage boys. None of the parents pressed charges, they were intimidated by the family's social standing. Henry Knight is his latest, and he lives with Sebastian and Sebastian's parents. I really can't speak out of turn. Ever since Henry moved in, Sebastian has been pretty quiet, and Mr. & Mrs. Wilkes have done a lot for Henry. He was kicked out of his home and had nothing. They really love that boy. Most parents wouldn't condone that type of lifestyle, but they do. I get this feeling, especially when I see Mrs. Wilkes, that she's hiding something. She came to the town hall meeting the other night at the church and sat in the last row, not saying a word. I smiled at her and thanked her for coming. But others treat her like a pariah because of her son, and they've said some nasty things."
"You're such a bossy omega," Sherlock softly scolded, leaning down to kiss John on the forehead.
Wanda smiled. "That's better." She glanced at her watch. "I'd better get going. I want to be home and safe inside before it gets dark." She kissed John on the cheek. "Now remember what I said."
Greg sat back with a sigh of content. "I still can't believe Molly and I...I mean I always liked her as a friend and a colleague, but I never thought we would end up as a couple. She'd been hung up on Sherlock for years, and I was trapped in a shitty marriage I didn't think I'd escape. Then finally, Jill decided she wanted out. I was so happy I didn't even fight her on custody. If the kids wanted to be with her and that loser gym teacher, so be it."
John has a gross, but special, surprise for Sherlock.
Sherlock took another drag, inhaled deeply, and dropped the stub to the ground, crushing it with his black leather boot. His free period was almost over, and lunch would be starting shortly. He didn't feel like eating, but he'd knew he'd get hell at home from his mother if he didn't take a few bites of something, so he'd figure he'd get a piece of fruit in the cafeteria.
He pulled his knees to his chest and hugged himself tightly, trying to sort out this horrible dilemma, wondering how he should proceed. It shouldn't be up to him. It shouldn't be up to a fifteen year-old to announce to an entire town someone they felt was a decent, upstanding person, someone who helped save him and give him a better life was a psychotic murderer.
"Rosie, you're the cutest ladybug I've ever seen," Mike told her.
John smiled at him as he opened the door for him. "Good afternoon."
, where he blogged about his life and being a gamma. He learned there were two other gamma males in the UK who reached out to him in his blog and they became quick internet friends. They were planning a meetup this fall in Wales, where one of them lived. Knowing he wasn't truly alone made him feel better.
John and Sherlock were sitting outside under a cluster of maple trees in Sherlock's backyard. Sherlock was feeling much better and his parents thought the fresh late summer air would do him good.
John nodded and stood up. "Before we dive in, I think we're going to need two of this place's strongest drinks. It's going to be an intense hour and a half."
Molly nodded. "Me too. But I actually like school. These continued interruptions means we'll have to make up the days missed at the end of the year.
Sherlock awoke, happy, sticky, and smelling like a combination of John's pumpkin spice scent and his own nutty and mossy scent. He reached for John, but saw his side of the bed empty. Frowning, he jumped up, reaching for his blue dressing gown and leaving the cozy warmth of their bedroom. "John?" he called as he stepped into the living room.
Harry watched her mother and brother, and she silently hoped this would be the end of the drama.
"Sorry to hear that. I hope he didn't catch it from me."
The two police officers shot by Wilkes had been treated and released. They had only been grazed by the bullets.
"It's my son. He was admitted to the hospital last night." He appeared on the verge of tears.
John was at the bar getting a club soda with lime. He never drank while working, even though one of the perks of being the DJ at Lestrade's was free booze. As he thanked Sally and started to head back to the booth, he noticed a middle-aged fortyish white brown-haired man, sitting in the corner, back to the wall,  wearing a yellow sweater over top a white shirt with a wide collar, and tan trousers, a cold expression on his nondescript face.
John shivered slightly and turned to face his husband. "You sure? You know how bad I am at slow dancing..."
*****
*****
Sherlock sharply turned to face him. "What do you mean, you know him? How? When? Where? Why?" he accused breathlessly.
Sherlock was impressed at John's deduction. "Have you told the police?"
Nothing was left of the church, which was reduced to ash and cinder. He fought back a tear. He and his family would come every Sunday before heading to his in-law's in Baskerville for Sunday supper, unless he had to be on a fire call. It was good that the community center opened its doors to everyone so they could still worship, but it wouldn't be the same. The church had been a beautiful structure, and now it was gone. It would be rebuilt, the pastor vowed, but a new building wouldn't replace the memories. His wedding to his wife Pearl was held here. Their children had been baptized here.
Sherlock couldn't put it down, and his younger siblings had teased him mercilessly ever since. Sherlock eventually read the rest of his novels, and they were just as good.
“There’s a freaky chick down by the pond. I caught her trying to drown a baby duck. I stopped her, but then she told me in this weird accent that I shouldn’t be upset about a duckling dying at her hand when I’m so eager to go into the army and kill people. I’ve never seen this bitch before in my life and yet she knows I want to enlist. She’s heading this way. I’m not sticking around.” He started towards the park entrance, but Big Seb jumped up and grabbed his arm. “You mean to tell me you’re afraid of a girl? You pussy,” he spat.
Sherlock entered the living room. "I'm all ready John."
Another smile, but this one didn’t reach his eyes, and the girl actually shuddered. Eurus and Sherlock would be thrilled at the reaction. “I can if you want me too.”
Everyone watched as Gary hauled the two bullies out of the roller rink. "You two are barred from this establishment. Don't ever show up on this property again, got it?" Gary growled.
“I’m going to kick his ass if he ever touches her again, I promise.” Greg wrapped a protective arm around his girlfriend.
Molly's eyes widened for a second. She looked down at her lap, fidgeting with her hands for a moment before looking at John. "It's so silly of me, having a crush on him when he's stated repeatedly women aren't his area. But he's incredibly smart, he has this voice that could melt butter, and he's...well, he's
"Hi John. Listen dear, I called because I need to know when you'll be available to help me get the old joint up and running. I'll have Ella and Angelo tomorrow morning and early afternoon, and Molly, Mike, and Mary are coming tomorrow after school."
John nodded. "I'll stay here and keep an eye on things."
John and Victor watched the scene across the street with amusement. "Looks like you don't have to worry about your stalker," Victor said with a chuckle.
Mycroft closed the doors and leaned against them, closing his eyes, as if he was trying to shut off the rest of the world.
John could tell Sherlock wanted to go, so he bid his friends goodnight, took Sherlock's hand, and they left the student center. It was pouring rain, and John started to make a dash for their dorm. But suddenly he felt two hands push him down into the wet grass, and he was turned over to face Sherlock, who had a randy grin on his face.
Sherlock nodded, then got into his car and soon the two were speeding out of the drive-in. When they reached Sherlock's house, John let out a whistle. It was a huge, sprawling colonial with pillars, surrounded by trees.
His nose twitched in annoyance at all the cloying smells from the omegas. As an unbonded alpha, the scents from the other gender often clogged up his nostrils which slowed down his brain and made him feel even more irritable than he usually was. Mycroft and Greg constantly pestered him to settle down and find a mate so he would, as they put it, 'be more agreeable and tolerable' but he hadn't found an omega he thought was worthwhile.
Sherlock stood on his bedroom balcony, enjoying a cigarette and watching the quiet beauty of the evening sunset in its brilliance of indigo blue, warm orange, and petal pink tones spread against the never ending sky. A few stars were already out, twinkling in the distance.
"Absolutely," Greg answered.
"Sorry if I'm not too social right now, but Mr. Graves sprung a trig exam on us and you know math is not my best subject."
*****
"Hi! I thought you were heading off to Beverly Hills with Kate today," Janine replied.
He heard strains of a piano coming from inside the house; he instantly recognized the tune as Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata. Whoever was playing it was good and had a decent ear for music, but being a talented pianist himself, he knew they could do much better. All the Holmes children were musically inclined. Sherlock and Eurus played the violin and performed in many recitals at school---when they bothered to attend school that is. When they would duet together, it was pure magic.
"You're amazing." Sherlock softly kissed John's forehead, which illicited a sweet giggle from the shorter man.
John was enjoying his time with Sherlock and he knew soon he'd have to catch the train back to London. He planned to ask him if they wanted to make another date before he left.
"Very good. Raise your arms," John firmly commanded.
"I like it, it'll look good with your dark hair and olive skin," Molly agreed.
Seconds later there was a knock on the door and a "Yoo-hoo!" from Mrs. Hudson. John let her in, and she was carrying a tray of chocolate chip scones. "I've been tuned into the news all afternoon and I've been so worried, I started baking. I brought some scones over, I thought maybe we'd have a few while you tell me everything that happened."
"We could try John's sister and brother-in-law, but I'm sure they would slam the door in our faces and call the police. I just don't know what to do. If Sherlock succeeds in getting to John..." Veronica's voice trailed off as she started to sob. Sidney took her in his arms, rubbing her back and whispering reassuring words of comfort.
John laughed. "I'd have pictures of you too. You're gorgeous."
The photo session in front of the London Eye went a lot smoother and more professional with the traditional poses. By the time Sherlock and John were done, more couples had descended on the attraction to take their wedding photos. Love and romance were definitely in the air.
After a long shower, he threw on a pair of black sweatpants and tied his blue dressing gown around him, settled on the couch with the laptop, and clicked on the link to book a session with John. A box popped up indicating April was filled, and John was now booking May appointments.
John chuckled. "Why does that not surprise me? Irene is a walking scandal herself."
John gave her a firm gaze. "Look Eurus, what happened back in England, as far as I'm concerned, I still think it was wrong to push your brother into the pool and not 'fess up. I don't know how the law works there, but you probably would have been charged with manslaughter and since you're a minor, you probably wouldn't have gone to jail. But I can see why your family panicked."
“I understand you’re scared Bryan, but your theory has merit. But would Seb or Jim really go after you? You’re a victim of Quinn too. You share something in common with Seb. He and Jim might see you more as an ally. Besides, how would they automatically assume it was you who went to the police? Everyone in the veterans’ group knows what happened.”
"No problem. You and your mom get home safe. Mrs. H. and I will be leaving soon after."
"Yes, but usually people don't refer to me that way. Typically I get freak, or poof, or psychopath. They're all idiots. I'm a sociopath, a highly functioning one." Sherlock was smirking, but John wasn't fooled. He could see the hurt in his face.
"Flattery will get you nowhere Mr. Holmes," John teased.
"Missing you like crazy, but I'm relieved to know you're okay. Pete Hooper called me earlier tonight and invited me to join a meeting with the other parents tomorrow night, about the Holmes family."
"It's okay." Sylvia looked her daughter, then a angry glare crossed her face. "Carl Powers has a lot to answer for."
John walked over to peek at Rosie, grinning at her small, sleeping form. "She's asleep, great. You played for her." He looked back at his spouse. "I got a text from Sarah. Her husband doesn't have corona, it was just a cold that developed into bronchial asthma. He's got steroids and an inhaler, and is home resting."
"Hello John," Sherlock said, a shy smile on his handsome face.
Sherlock finished his lap and climbed the ladder to get out of the pool, shaking the excess water out of his dark hair, and grabbed his towel that sat in a lounge chair. He wrapped it around his slim waist, and sat down, putting his sunglasses on his face, basking in the early afternoon sunshine like a contented cat. He wasn't that content though, he missed John.
Just then, it began to rain. A gentle shower fell down into the streets below from the dark winter sky. Sherlock and John continued to dance, entwined with each other, sharing soft kisses.
"Yeah. The good part is I was able to get my homework done, so I can just be cool for a while before I go to bed," John said. And to call Sherlock like he'd promised.
"The weather is perfect tonight to listen to spooky stories," Wanda remarked.
Sherlock's eyes widened in surprise and also shame. Greg's face broke out into a grin, but he held his laughter, waiting to see how his brother-in-law would get himself out of this one.
The two stepped forward and beamed at the baby boy. "Oh John, look at him, he's perfect," Sherlock gushed.
Marty's eyes widened and he stepped back. "Okay, okay, no need for all of this. I'll leave her alone I promise. We all will. Won't we guys?"
John snuggled closer to Sherlock. "I'm glad we decided to hang out here this week. "We'll have lots of peace and quiet. Imagine, a week of no Anderson whining about Sally dumping him for Dimmock, no strenuous rugby practices, no boring lectures, no awful pop music being blared in the halls..."

"Enjoying the view?" his husband's deep baritone suddenly spoke from behind him.
“John!” he heard Molly’s voice cry out. He turned to see his friend and Victor coming towards him. “I was about to call the cops!”
“I’m not afraid of little girls,” Big Seb growled. He took a step towards her, menace in his eyes. “Seems you’re not wanted here doll, so why don’t you get lost.”
“I don’t think you’re a nerd Molly. I think you’re a sweet and wonderful girl and I want to go steady with you. Irene doesn’t like doing normal fun things. I want to be with someone who likes sock hops and drive-ins and roller skating and hanging out listening to records.” He placed his hand on top of hers, which made him shiver. “So come on, will you be my girl?”
the weakest and sappiest of Shakespeare's plays, but now he could see where The Bard was coming from, and why Romeo and Juliet had intentionally killed themselves to be together forever. Love is a vicious motivator, and it motivated him to want to stop living. All for a boy he barely knows.
Sherlock shakes his head, caught off guard by the news. “What happened?” He asks.
“Hello?” A hesitant voice comes from the other side. “Is this… Sir Edwin?”
John frowns. “I don’t do that.”
Yesterday, John had bundled up more than usual as he got ready to leave; it’s as though he’s become so dependent on the warmth of the flat that anything that exists outside requires special armour. He shrugged into his coat with a sigh as he stoked the fire needlessly, throwing a glare at Sherlock, who was lumped carelessly in his chair. Resigned to his fate by now, Sherlock had offered nothing but silence in response to the doctor's prying eyes, yielding to the bristling-yet-heartwarming kaleidoscope of emotions residing there.
“Monday evening’s not good. I’ve got a…” David says, sneaking a glance at a tight lipped Alison, who’s been sitting and listening too. “Group thing.”
When he finally opens his eyes, he realizes Molly and Rosie are gone. He goes to the kitchen and pulls out a bottle from the cabinet.
“They made me believe-”
“Oh my god.” John says, rolling his eyes in grudging disbelief at his own stupidity.
He’s not brave enough to say out loud.
David smiles again, a warm, honest smile. “Bon appétit.”
In the car Sherlock is still and rigid. His hands are clasped tightly between his knees and he stares out the window wordlessly. They ride in complete silence. The first words to leave John’s mouth are uttered at the hospital when they reach the ITU reception desk.
With Rosie on his hip John leaves quickly, wounded and battered. He only stops to take a deep calming breath when he’s out the main door, resting his head against it.
“It’s not your fault, Sherlock. You take the blame so easily. We have enough going on as it is, no need to borrow trouble. Tell me you understand that.”
made it so uncomfortable which was probably a mistake because here it is, hanging uneasily between them.
“Good night.”
” He writes back.
John spent the majority of his life feeling untethered, unattached. Knowing that a man like Sherlock Holmes considered him his family brought a new sense of purpose to his days back then. It gives him the same sense of purpose now.
“I brought…” Sherlock points at a plastic bag in the small kitchenette behind him. “...
“You said Mary’s in training for a new job?”
Elin is, for all intents and purposes, a saint. In his usual fashion, Sherlock had vowed not to rely on his brother’s research, and opted for some legwork himself. Incredibly, he couldn’t find one damning piece of evidence; not a fine for jaywalking; not a complaint from a neighbour. He
“I’m sorry, John.”
Taking a deep breath, he pushes the door and walks inside, as conspicuous as possible.
“And they want me—” David continues, “they want me to give a speech to a bunch of crows. Encourage them. Convince them they’ve made the right choice.”
“Am I, er... interrupting anything?”
Sherlock wakes abruptly from his seat on the top of the stairs. Frustrated growls come from John’s room as he walks around it, banging doors and kicking the legs of the bed. It takes Sherlock a long minute to realize what’s happening. His blood freezes in his veins when he does.
"Thank you, Mr. Holmes, good luck,” Saul says, ducking his head to take a good look at the girl. “Be good, bubala.”
John takes a peek at the titles:
“That’s fairly standard.”
His heart heavy with disappointment, he walks quietly into his own house an hour later, the sun not entirely up yet, the early morning air cold. He takes his shoes off when he enters, hoping to avoid Mary’s questioning eyes.
Mycroft hums. “And why did you end up climbing into his car?”
“Sherlock, what’s the one thing I asked for when I agreed to help, hmm? No secrets, no lies.”
“What the fuck do you think you’re doing?”
“We have a deal, Mycroft!”
Seeing where the conversation is going, he eyes the brochure that came with the package. He’s no Sherlock Holmes but it’s safe to assume he’s meant to approach David again in the date and time mentioned.
This is the part of the conversation he fears the most.
And somehow, even though they had silently agreed to
“That’s rather rude, considering last we saw each other John and I were rather busy saving your life.” Sherlock snarls back.
“Baker Street felt empty, is that what you’re saying? You were feeling John’s absence?”
“Yes,” Sherlock smiles. “He caught you in a compromising situation and hung it over your head. You had sex with someone. Someone’s wife; my guess would be one of your remote cousins, a powerful one, maybe the most powerful one in your clan—a married woman, whom you seduced in hopes of extortion later. But he had photographs, or some other proof, and he used that to buy your loyalty.”
“But that’s my point, you see. They bludgeoned the man I used to be out of my body there on the floor in Afghanistan,” David whispers. “If she’d seen me lying on the floor there, she would have been disgusted. She would never want anything to do with me again. I’ve nothing left to give her.”
“Looked plenty heavy to me,” she says kindly, and he can’t help but smile at the goodwill. “It’s the wedding jitters, if you ask me,” she stage-whispers, winking. “You’ll be as good as new in no time.”
“What’s he doing there?”
“Mycroft was unplanned.” She says with a naughty smile in return for his shocked gape. “He was the first child, and he was always so sour and stuffy. We assumed it was because he’s the eldest. You spoil them and they become ungrateful. It took us six years to have Sherlock. Mycroft was unexpected so we thought the next child would come along without a hitch, but no. Six years. And we were so happy to have him. He was such a darling little boy. William fell in love with him the moment he saw him. And then Eurus came along a year later. This time we thought it’ll take us another six years but we were surprised again!”
John squirms in his chair as a sense of panic fills him, her words hitting hard like a punch to the gut.
“Right, but I didn’t. There was a whole squad of policemen there, Sherlock, all with their weapons drawn!”
“Yes.”
. The only plus side of this entire scheme, as far as he’s concerned; he’s counting on getting banned from Christmas dinner going forward.
“Just what the hell is going on here?”
He knows Sherlock has been working on improving his ability to read these signals. Has he been getting any better? Are there others succeeding where John has failed so miserably?
“It’s a waste of time, Mycroft!” Sherlock moans. “Somebody has to keep an eye on Stewart.”
“Hey?”
It wasn’t the confession that had him worried that day. He was a GP. He’d met his share of new mothers showing signs of postnatal depression or just plain, overwhelming exhaustion. John knew better than to judge a woman after her baby had been yelling at the top of their lungs for hours on end.
“Yes.” John sniffs in anger, his dangerous smile appearing. “I also know you called him paranoid and erratic while conspiring behind his back with an ex. We had a saying in Afghanistan, you know.
“And I…” She continues. “For many years after that, I wasn’t… I wasn’t present. It must have felt like living with a ghost of a mother for Sherlock. It’s horrible, I know. It’s unfair when you have other children to raise. But they insisted on keeping Eurus a secret and it absolutely tore me apart.”

“I’m…” John shakes his head, dumbfounded. “What? I’m… no, I’m not. Oh god. Of course you’d think that. Is that what this is about?”
Fear not, my friends, and DON'T PANIC when you read this! I promise things are only getting better from now on.
“I didn’t always know, John.” Sherlock confesses, his voice cold and worried. “It was too late by the time I did.”
They had been arguing about baby names, godparents (John wanted Sherlock to be their child's godfather, Mary didn't), the colors for the nursery, the crib he hadn't assembled yet despite promising to, Mary's planned maternity leave. They'd been fighting about marriage counseling before the baby came (John wanted to, Mary didn't) and about John seeing Sherlock more than he sees his own wife.
They’re silent for a few minutes, contemplating. Sherlock looks at him, then looks away again.
“And… there was a lot of
“It’s an inhalation anesthetic.” John says. “How.. why would?...”
On the third night, John exhales loudly as he parks the car. He stares unseeing out the window, his fingers aching from holding onto the wheel too tightly.
John hurriedly circles the cabin. It has one window, thick drapes covering it from the inside. He crouches underneath, straining to catch any signs of trouble.
She pokes some more, calling him again. “Daddy!”
Mycroft is willing to acquiesce a bit longer, lest the emotional turmoil slow Sherlock’s recovery. He’s making his own plans for Mary Watson in the meantime.
“I suppose… to not endanger a compound’s two snipers at once, I’d say.”
“Hey.”
“Oh. He said his name was Benjamin. I didn’t know he was a... He just sat down next to me. We started talking and…”
John hates her.
John swallows. “Like home.”
“Yeah...” Lestrade nods. “That’s the name of the hotel he was found in.”
“I can think of a number of ways of coaxing her into cooperating, should the need arise.”
Mycroft’s nonchalant, barely noticeable smirk is an open invitation for a sucker punch. It’s all John can do not to take him up on it.
“Why would I?”
She lets the words sink and waits for a response.
, hanging mid-air like a denim-clad piñata.
“No. No.” John shakes his head. “That’s not good enough. How would you feel if I told I’m leaving the country with a one-way ticket?”
“Bored with his desk job, apparently,” Sherlock says. “He’s now the Division Chief for Europe. Back in the field.”
Sherlock swallows. “
And it’s like magic, how that voice of his controls the state of John’s heart; back and forth between steely unease and grounding comfort. He clings to the fluttering thought that maybe he’s got it all wrong. That maybe, maybe, he’s just overreacting.
“I hated it. Can’t blame Eurus for that one, I suppose.” Sherlock looks at John with a shy smile, and they chuckle.
If Sherlock’s been plagued by a low-key humming of his guts at the fact that the nun’s supposed necklace was found with the two men’s photographs, he no longer is. When taken into account it was found buried amongst a thieving hoarder’s treasure, it becomes nothing short of circumstantial.
“You don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Rosie is wailing in his arms, thoroughly unimpressed by his jittery efforts. He tries talking to her in his most soothing voice, looking into her eyes. "That's enough, Watson. Your father will be back in no time."
“Greg?” John asks as he takes the phone, his eyes wide with fear as his body tries to adjust to the change in the mood.
“I thought I’d surprise you,” Sherlock explains, a twinkle of mirth in his eyes. “Like they do in the movies.”
“Were there others?” John asks. “Friends, I mean. Other friends?”
“Is your wife’s name Alison?”
If that fails?
“Gabriel? He killed Nathan Black?” John asks.
He’s holding her up by her small hands, helping her take a few wobbly steps as he closes his eyes and tilts his head to the sky. The combination of the sun caressing his face on this surprisingly warm day and Rosie’s little fingers brings a measure of calm he feels so rarely.
His only response is an uninterested hum, already engrossed in the case of the vanishing children’s librarian.
?” Sherlock demands. “What’s your brilliant plan this time, burying your head in the sand like you did about Mary? Has that worked well for you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“A headhunter contacted me,” she says. “A surgery in Hanwell is looking for a new head nurse.”
“What?”
Sherlock considers James for a long minute. John wonders what he sees.
he wonders and opens the envelope quickly.
John pauses, considering his words.
They’re back in Baker Street, after spending weeks there during Sherlock’s most crucial period of recovery. Sherlock had just been released earlier that day after his second hospitalization.
“Good.” Sherlock nods uncomfortably, licking his lips. Everything is supposedly fine, so why does John look as though he’s waiting for the ground to open and swallow him? “That’s good.”
“I see. What about the second time?”
“Was that where you got shot?” Sherlock asks, not looking back at John.
Sherlock takes the card, turns it over. He clears his throat. “Thank you,” he says and closes the door behind Mr. Lyons as he heads for the stairs.
“Oh, Sherlock.” Mrs. Hudson stares sadly and shakes her head. It’s one of those stares that make him feel like he’s a naive 5-year-old who has no grasp on humans and their terrible nature. She’s the only person in the world who can make him feel this way.
“Amar Mansour, my asset in Gaza, who Mycroft suggested I’d killed before I left for Germany”—Sherlock says, handing out a few papers from the dossier—“was captured alive on CCTV at a men’s bathhouse as I was photographed by security at the gates of Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv. Mansour never left the bathhouse, because that’s where he was shot to death. Do you know who else was at that bathhouse, unbeknownst to me?”
“So there were… diagnoses?” He probes. Not that it matters, he thinks. Every diagnosis given about Sherlock after Eurus died could never really encompass everything he went through as a child.
“I understand.”
He stops to look down at her with an assessing doctor’s eye, and sends a hand to her forehead, ruling out a fever. When he takes a turn to the left, he notices two men sitting on a bench under a willow tree out in the distance.
She sends him off with a kiss and a box of biscuits, designated to lift his mood. It doesn’t.
Dull. -SH
A shot is heard and the man in the black clothes drops to the ground; Alexander cries in fear; the second man in the car steps out and John sees it’s Gabriel, rushing towards Alexander; and John suddenly realizes Sherlock’s heading straight towards the scene. He never even noticed him leaving his side.
"I saw plenty of close friends, important friends, die. I don't think I'll be able to..." John trailed off, lowering his head.
“Why don’t you try? My shoulder’s a bit stiff tonight,” Mrs. Hudson says and moves closer, slightly raising her right shoulder to emphasize her claim.
John clears his throat and nods back.
“I see,” the security guard says. “May I suggest that you go and wait for him by the cash registers? He just might turn up there.”
John leaves Mycroft alone on the back porch and indeed takes over packing duty. It’s time to leave.
“I was protecting you, John. That was the only way I could think of.”
"Hello, Dr. Watson," Mycroft says. "Am I to understand my brother has been ignoring you too?"
“What?” She smiles and pulls the vest further up, revealing his torso. “You can’t shower with your kit—”
or else
“And then all
She approaches them in full special-ops gear; all black, balaclava and gloves on. Her gun, a solid and reassuring presence against her right hip, is more a precaution than an actual necessity.
“It could be dangerous, John.”
“That’s enough, Watson. Mr. Monkey had some very important monkey business to tend to.” He said and her eyes widened in awe. “I’m sure he’ll come back as soon as he becomes available again.”
“According to his belongings, his name is Nathan Black. 28 years old. There’s an employee badge of a local law firm. I didn’t get a chance to do a full autopsy yet but the cause of death is quite clear. His spinal cord was crushed. There aren’t any contusions or lacerations which suggest that the injuries were sustained without a struggle. In other words, someone broke his neck.”
“Here’s what I’m offering: you stay in London for now, Mr. Holmes,” Edwin says. “Go back to being Sherlock Holmes. Take on new cases. We’ll get you some high profile ones that’ll put you right back in the press. It’ll show the Corporal that we have indeed fired you. It’ll appease him.”
“Will liked you.” She says with a sad smile, trying to change the atmosphere.
John stops, now that he stands fully in front of the woman. He blinks for a beat. “Do I know you?”
...with Magnussen. That unfortunate event allowed me to hasten the process.”
David stops in his tracks and turns around in a panic, causing John to bump right into him.
“No cases, then?” Sir Edwin asks.
“You can read all about it here. More documents about Stewart, the little I was able to sneak away, and some more on that laptop. Thought you might make more sense of them. Mostly intel logs and documentation from the weeks before the attack.”
“Like I said, I can’t—”
He turns to David in the driver's seat, looking at his tall, proud figure. “Why am I here?”
It’s interesting, he thinks, as memories of the day Sherlock had left on an airplane flood him. That day, John was a ball of anger and anxiety, a volcano on the verge of erupting. This time, he realizes in a strange moment of calm, all the fight in him is gone.
“Thought so,” John says softly, squeezing Sherlock’s arm sympathetically. He has to stop himself from leaning into the comforting touch. “Not much longer, Sherlock, I promise.”
“Babies?”
Supposedly.
Edit: Surprise! This universe continues in the next story of this series - Detours. Please read on!
“No,” David says. “Not that I remember.”
Instead he wallows, stews in his own misery.
Sherlock hates it.
“What?” Sherlock freezes mid-chew.
Sherlock stands in another grey, bare room, the hustle and bustle of activity around Corporal Stewart not penetrating the thick door.
He sniffs Rosie’s head, relishing her soft baby smell. His arms are numb from holding her and his back aches from the rocking movement but he can't let her go tonight. This little girl and the man downstairs are all he has left. That’s all there is to it.
Sherlock moves uncomfortably on the sofa. David nods his head repeatedly - they’ve reached the heart of the matter.
“And Sherlock... please, please, I need you to hear me out here. Even if you think and think and decide that this is not what you want, I’m still waiting for you to come back to me. I’ll learn to live with that. But we need you. We need you with us. You told me I’m your family. I need you to show me you meant it.”
“As a flatmate, when we met,” John’s lips twist in a reluctant smile. “You used to ignore me for days on end.”
“You ‘lright, mate?”
“So, what’s going on?”
“I need to be sure there’s nothing you’re not telling me, John.” Sherlock says again and John feels like nothing but a client for a mere second. “It’s pertinent to the investigation.”
John smiles again and finally, finally, Sherlock smiles back. He can see the understanding in Sherlock’s eyes and relaxes.
The punch hits swiftly and accurately, leaving Sherlock surprised by the blazing pain that light up his nerves as his fist meets Mycroft’s jaw. There's a sickening sound of bones cracking; whose bones, he can't be sure.
“It wasn’t like… I’m not…” James says and looks between Sherlock and Lestrade. “I wanted his advice. His… medical advice.”
“By then, I preferred her away and distracted than close to home and laser-focused on us.”
David's face falls as Alison's smile disappears. “When?”
None are louder than John's silence, though, as he stands steadfastly behind him with his daughter on his hip, boring a hole into the back of Sherlock’s head.
“Ignore that. Did you hear me? You don’t leave again because if you do, don’t bother coming back,” John says. “Because there won't be anything for you to come back to this time.”
And then Sherlock smiles, a warm, honest smile, and all doubt leaves John's body. “Good night, John.”
“I can think of something right now.”
Ian’s wearing his wedding band these days. Makes sense, given that his once-estranged wife is standing right next to him behind the counter, patting his back affectionately.
“No, not really. It’s just that I really need to talk to someone—”
He takes in a big breath. “Alive” means there’s still a point to all of this. He shakes his head, clearing it of distracting thoughts. He walks to the car and pulls his bags out.
John’s heart skips a beat. The words that leave Sherlock’s mouth, when he’s unguarded, are so touching. John lets the silence envelop them for a while, listening to Mrs. Hudson’s snores.
“Loudwater?” John looks up distractedly. “That was the nearest exit on the way here—”
“John?” Mary asks suddenly, pulling him from his reverie. Somewhere along the way she’d hung up the phone and picked up the mountain of folded laundry.
“Yes, I know. I was there,” Sherlock says. “A polygraph test which you passed with flying colors, even though I know for sure you lied, at least as far as one very specific question goes.”
“No, it didn’t start here,” Sherlock says. “Not before uni.”
David looks at Sherlock. "Did you hear me, Sherlock? It's important for me that you internalize what I just said. That you understand I'm here to protect you and ensure your safety and your best interests."
He wants to fix this. He needs to fix this. A few hours ago he told Sherlock that it didn’t matter that Sherlock didn’t know how to do this. But right now it does, because John is so lost and so confused and he doesn’t know what to do next. They’re almost there, they’re on the precipice and suddenly John realizes he’s terrified.
“To Sherlock,” he signals with his chin, gesturing at the door. “After you.”
He sighs and places the phone back on the bedside table, staring at the ceiling. Mycroft had said Sherlock wouldn’t be available at first. John thinks he’d mentioned two weeks. But John never expects Sherlock to actually listen to anything so… institutional. Follow Protocol. Bureaucracy. Proper behavior.
), and sex. He hopes. He’s definitely holding out for sex but he’s not entirely sure where Sherlock stands when it comes to sex (
“I see,” he says with a sigh. His eyes scan the room, and he settles on the edge of the bed. “I’ve been afraid of this.”
The pub is quiet in this late afternoon hour, serviced only by a reserved bartender who keeps to himself and whispers silent curses at the telly. John is rather proud when he checks in with himself, eyeing the amount of alcohol he’s downed so far. Barely one pint, though he’d asked the bartender to have another one ready for when this one's emptied.
They slow down as they reach a
“Maybe you shouldn’t have.” James says defiantly. “Look where it got me.”
“Oh, are we threatening each other now?” she asks, her eyes narrowing dangerously.
The Q&A session begins with a flattering introduction and a run-through of Sherlock’s career and credentials. He talks about his days reading Chemistry and his experiences working with the Yard.
Sherlock blinks distractedly, bringing his brother into focus. “Are you sure?”
He has so many questions.
Dr. Levinson is tall, slender, and utterly aloof. Sherlock, in his own way, finds said aloofness comforting.
“Were you there when they actually found him?”
“I couldn’t allow the Corporal to go to the press with his… complaint. Not when these two were conducting an illegal operation,” Edwin says. “As far as the Corporal knows, Peter Knight was reprimanded and fired. He’s no longer a part of Her Majesty’s Secret Service, nor is his brother, who was sent on an unpaid leave of absence.”
“You don’t have to live like this, you know,” Mycroft says, scrunching his nose disapprovingly. Sherlock frowns. “There are people you can pay to clean the place up. It’s downright stale.”
“Is it ever?” he grumbles, aware of the housekeeper creeping onto the veranda. He doesn’t have a chance to oblige their well-rehearsed Friday morning conversation.
PS - John's consultation with David is *probably?* inappropriate, I'm not sure. But a comment left on the previous chapter made me think that David may have some important things say. It's my fic so I'll do what I want :)
“That’s Jamie,” Dinah says. “Jamie Watson.”
John closes his eyes, his heart aching. “Christ, Sherlock. Don’t say that. Not after everything you’ve been through. After all the work you’ve been doing.”
"About the drugs. About leaving for good and only telling me about a minute before taking off. About choosing to be a sitting duck waiting for Moriarty to attack. How's that for a start?"
“Though I doubt he’ll listen,” Mycroft grumbles, his voice barely audible.
“Elin Thøgersen is—”
When John can’t find a proper response, Sherlock continues in an ever quickening tirade, his voice growing louder and louder with every word. “You have a wife who could have chosen any other life for herself. You may question her methods, but she’s clearly chosen to spend it with you. So correct me if I’m wrong, doctor, but it seems to me that despite our deficiencies, mine and Mary’s, there are not one, but
punch him,” Sherlock says, his voice deep and warm, as they reach the flat a few hours later, breathless and red-cheeked from exertion.
Sherlock snorts. “Dashing, John? Really?”
“Yes. Thank you,” John says and gets up. “Excuse me, I need to...” John says and leaves Sherlock behind.
“Good.”
John looks to Sherlock for clarification.
A text interrupts their conversation.
“Yes. A GP.” John nods. “Not as exciting as patching a bloke up in the desert sands of Helmand, but it pays the rent.”
“Anthea will—”
John nods, finally understanding Sherlock’s words at the hospital a few days ago.
John did know that. He’d watched the conversation unfolding live on Sherlock’s screens at the bolthole the other day.
Sherlock’s face cloud with unreadable emotion. His back straightens in attention, but John stops him before he even opens his mouth.
Sherlock raises his eyebrows again, this time in apparent surprise.
Sherlock’s head couldn’t move more quickly than it is moving right now. “Mycroft? What’s he got to do with it?”
He looks over at Sherlock again and realizes, to his horror, that he has no idea what to do. Though they’ve known each other for so long, been through so many tragedies, he never really saw Sherlock in the throes of grief.
He’d left the empty bolthole not an hour ago with his tail between his legs. He’d hoped staying the night would help ease the tension. Instead, it seemed to make it worse, both with Sherlock and Mary- he realizes when he finds her in the kitchen, scanning him from head to toe as he enters.
“Not on my end.” James says. “I’ve had my suspicions about Alexander. He promised me it was a misunderstanding. I agreed to let it be. He was my husband and I promised him I’ll make an effort to trust him, as hard as it’s always been for me. I’m a man of my word.”
“Go on, now!” Aldridge says, insisting on watching John walking away.
So enraptured is he with John’s unspoken words, he doesn’t notice that the other man is getting closer and closer until his lips rest on Sherlock for a soft, hesitant kiss.
“They were crueler with him. I had a wife, he didn’t. It made him an easy target. One of the guards...” David bites his top lip painfully, his eyes unseeing. “He would… abuse him. Sexually. In the cell next to mine, every night. Made sure I heard all of it. The guard, he… he couldn’t touch him. He was too religious to actually… but he… used other things, and…”
He’d recognize this man anywhere, anytime, even if a hundred years had passed.
“I imagine she expected her brother to be found, too, since they were captured together. She mentioned a short memorial and going to a pub afterwards, to get ‘
“That’s personal.” Alexander says. “You’re not police, I don’t have to answer that.”
“Christ, he was a riot,” another man sighs and looks at a visibly stricken David. The man raises his pint and speaks to the table. “To Jonathan Palmer.”
“Am I—”
“A week and a half? I thought you planned to give two consecutive lectures.”
“Have you ever…” He starts and looks at Sherlock’s tightly wounded hands. Sherlock knows what’s coming, he realizes. He’s just as nervous. “Have you ever looked at me and thought… have you ever wanted this to be something more?”
“What are we going to call this one?” John says, stepping into the sitting room.
The notification comes from
John’s hand freezes mid-movement; he half-turns squinting, straining his ear in concentration.
“Right.” Says Lestrade. “He still claims to not remember anything from that night. His doctor reported he hadn’t slept a wink in observation and that he shows signs of extreme fatigue. I’ve only seen him for a passing moment but I agree. He looks unwell.”
was why I left, John. I can’t
“Then you got married, and… the baby. And then Mary…” Sherlock says, and John wonders if he’s aware that he’s touching the scar on his sternum as he does. “There wasn’t a place for me anymore.”
“John—”
“This is an undercover assignment, and an unofficial one at that,” Mycroft says pointedly. “When was the last time you checked your blog, Dr. Watson?”
“He’s been having panic attacks around large groups of people,” Sherlock continues. “I wouldn’t be surprised if he had one there, too.”
“She’s giving a speech tonight.”
How did she do this to us?
“Yes, please do.” Sherlock nods.
“We weren’t
If David is at all riled by realizing just how much Sherlock has invaded his privacy, he doesn’t show it. Instead, he sits up straighter in his chair, looking away before he finally speaks.
The conversation lingers for a while, as conversations go in rooms filled with covert operatives. Almost nothing is explicitly stated, and everything else consists of double entendres and innuendos. The true purpose of the visit finally becomes clear at last when Mr. Berenson unlocks his briefcase, handing Sherlock a thin dossier containing a top-secret,
) and another crease inside his wax jacket (
Suddenly, finally, Sherlock speaks.
"Shouldn’t you be picking Rosie up?" Sherlock asks as he nods a thank you to the bartender, standing up to put his phone in his pocket. John stares at the bar, hearing the dismissal and choking on a response.
“Rough night?” The cabbie tries again. “Looks like you need a doctor.”
“Yeah? Good.” He clears his throat. “I... saw the email. I don’t know what to say.”
He had hoped John Watson would be different, though.
, John thinks and chuckles quietly.
Lestrade shakes his head. “Poor guy. Well, that’s something to work with, at least.”
“I waited for you for
John stares at the ceiling, his vision blurring with dread.
“You sent me back to a miserable life, Sherlock. I hated going back there.” John looks at Sherlock. “How could you do that?”
“I haven’t been happy myself, Sherlock. For a long time.” John says and Sherlock stares at him with a mixture of fear and guilt. “No, not because of you... I just… I miss the way things were. I hate it all. I hate that damn flat. I hate those wallpapers and the beige pillows. And the neighbours, god, the fucking neighbours with their cars and the garden ornaments...”
“I’m sorry—”
” Sherlock says again. “It’s Lestrade.”
“Are you ill?” John smiles uncontrollably. “Should I be worried?”
“See that you do.” Sherlock grimaces, his heart fluttering at the thought of young Rosamund Mary Watson.
“Hmmm. Right.” John croaks, flustered. He clears his throat when he notices all eyes around the table are on him. “Coming!”
“And I have an erection to maintain.” He purrs in the other man’s ear. “I’m not a young man anymore. Waste not want not, darling.”
“What’s going on?”
John shakes his head in frustration. He’s not even sure what to say when he catches Sherlock staring at a distant spot. When he turns to look he sees James Sholto heading their way.
, he realizes as he scans through his mental Sherlock catalogues. Never had he seen such a content, sated Sherlock before.
“No.” John says, determined. “No.”
Sherlock, John realizes, truly and actually snorts at that.
As if a great man didn’t just die.
John thinks once, twice. “Used to,” he says. “Not anymore. He left the country about a year ago.”
“It’s late. Go home.”
The dark, cold room is lit only barely by the blue light and static audio emanating from the two computer screens. His breath a white fog, Sherlock texts Mycroft a reminder to send someone with a heating apparatus, seeing as he’s planned to spend several more nights here yet.
“What?” Edwin asks. “Who?”
“I miss… I suppose I miss the days before… everything,” David says. “I miss the lads, you know.”
” he says with a loud exhalation when he finally gets his bearing, breathing loudly.
“John-”
“John?”
about tea and just get some?”
John has to bite his lip in order to keep the words from leaving his mouth. He has so much to say, but he knows Sherlock well enough to know he won't be getting any answers. The silence between them is deafening, the weight of their own unspoken words heavy in the dark room.
“John?”
He finds — rather quickly and unsurprisingly — that he is yet again in very big trouble. He does not want to lose this precious access to Sherlock’s body - not tonight, not ever. He definitely does not wish to yield said access to other people, namely bright-eyed Australians in snug, stone-washed Levi’s.
“But James was still coming for his private sessions.” Lestrade says.
“No,” Sherlock says dryly.
, he tells himself,
John's tongue is heavy in his mouth. “In any capacity he would have liked.”
“No, not really.”
“Brilliant.” John says. “Thank you, Mrs. Holmes.”
“You’re a doctor,” Sherlock swallows. “I should think they speak for themselves.”
They begin by simply strolling around the market stalls, Rosie in her pushchair, pointing and calling every time she discovers something new and exciting. Sherlock is walking shoulder to shoulder with him, unnerved by all the sounds, sights and people.
“You’re no longer needed here,” Mycroft says, “but you are, in fact, needed by the Secret Service.”
“What are you asking, then?” Sherlock asks impatiently. “What do you want?”
“Isn’t this what you wanted, hmm?” He lowers his voice in frustration and moves close enough to feel her breath. “Mary and John,
He manages to convince Sherlock to join them for a walk in the park. Rosie is in a baby carrier, close to John’s body. Sherlock is a walking shadow one step behind him, his hands clasped behind his back. He’s being protective, expecting some unknown assailant.
The detective waits for a beat before speaking again. “How’s Halitosis Ann?”
“Not yet,” Sherlock shakes his head without turning to John. “Billy just rang me. He said David refused a ride home. Told his comrades he needed to cool off and decided to walk instead.”
Sherlock swallows at the sentiment. He changes the subject.
Sherlock stands and grabs another biscuit, entirely satisfied over the gasps and gapes. “You seem so adamant about overlooking the real problem here.”
“Sher—”
“My son.” A man’s image appears clearly on the screen. “My friend in London tells me you’re refusing to move forward. It’s understandable, of course. You’re in shock. Coming back to your comfortable Western life has confused you.”
Sherlock looks away to see David approaching (
“Oh, thank you dear.” Mrs. Holmes says as Mycroft lays a cup of tea next to her. John has to blink at the gesture; Mycroft just did something for another human being.
“Don’t worry about it,” David says dismissively. “It’s refreshing, rather. Everyone’s been so sensitive around me it’s been getting on my nerves. Can’t stand it.”
John swallows in surprise. “I—”
“No, David… you, you can’t punish yourself over their cruelty,” John says tightly. “Nothing they’ve done to you is your fault. If you do, that means they’ve won.”
“Yeah,” John said, distracted. “Looks like he had a good time, though. Did you win?”
“Of course not,” Mycroft says. “Never without our knowledge.”
“Anything. Everything,” John sighs. “Mary isn’t even her real name.”
“Where does she think you are?”
“Because he’s dead,” Sherlock says. David’s eyes grow wide with surprise.
“Mmmph.” John hums, unphased. He has his mouth on one nipple and a hand down Sherlock’s pants after all (it couldn’t be helped).
“That’s very kind of her, dear.” Mrs. Holmes says in an inflection that John, being the Englishman that he is, knows means quite the opposite. He turns to look at Sherlock who rolls his eyes in sympathy.
Sherlock flips the paper over, frowning. “Where’s the rest of it?”
She knew she’d pay a heavy price for leaving. Sherlock and John are… well, Sherlock and John. The three of them only just reunited, but she can sense Sherlock’s renewed pull on John’s orbit as well as his heart. It’s clear as day. She can’t even begin to imagine what transpired between them while she was away.
Sherlock dials and waits for Wiggins to pick up.
“I…” John says hesitantly, his chest constricting with warmth. Sherlock is… asking him to stay. “Is it poisoned?”
This,
Sherlock straightens his back, then sends an electrifying smile to Rosie through the mirror. “Charming Ms Watson here is my god-daughter. We’re not a couple.”
“So,” his brain and his mouth betray him. He remembers saying the same thing one terrible Christmas, a few years ago.
“What?” John sputters, turning to look at Sherlock helplessly. Sherlock pulls his coat more tightly around himself.
“I know it’s hard... for me, too.” John assures him. “But we need to do this. We need to be… honest with each other, for once. What do you want, Sherlock?”
“What?” David asks.
The flat is blessedly empty by the time he's back hours later. It stands dark and quiet, dusty and cold. The double-edged sword of loneliness he both longs for and hates hits hard, taking all breath out of his lungs.
“I thought… I thought I might immigrate, maybe,” David wonders aloud. “One of the boys from our section is hiding somewhere in the Amazon. That sounds delightful.”
he thinks as the memories attack his belligerent brain.
Missed him during the months of preparations before Rosie’s birth. He’d missed him over long, sleepless nights, trying to calm Rosie down during her first days at home when Mary, exhausted and asleep in the other room, couldn’t bear the sight of her after hours of wailing.
“Really?” John says and laughs when she nods enthusiastically.
It’s only when Alison’s footsteps are heard on the stairs that David’s smile falls unnaturally, and a big, panicky breath leaves his lungs. He listens intently, waiting to hear the bedroom door closing. When it does, David carefully removes the top part of the box to reveal a bottom compartment.
“He suddenly... kissed me. I’m not sure why.”
contract—absorbing the rest of it.
“Are you just going to laugh at me the entire time?”
Hoping that would do the trick, he lays his phone down and calls for his first patient.
As has John’s.
“Fuck,” David says again, bending his head towards his knees and shaking it. “I’m sorry, mate.”
“The nun’s students.”
“Maybe you’re asking the wrong question, though,” John says, scratching his head.
“What’s the matter with you, son?” Aldridge asks, taunting him.
“What for?” He asks because he honestly isn’t sure.
It starts with a picture attached to a text from Lestrade.
Whatever it is they’re fighting over, Sherlock realizes in frustration it’s substantial and short. David shakes his head angrily and steps away to the main road before Sherlock has even managed to recalculate.
he thinks. “Why was Jonathan upset that night?” he pushes. “His sister told you he called her that day, upset. What about?”
“Trust me to take good care of my brother, John,” Mycroft smiles, “he knew what he was getting into when he chose this assignment.”
Sherlock closes his eyes in anger, bracing himself for a long moment.
Sherlock grinds at thin air, now that John moved his body away. He looks John deep in his eyes, moaning in surprise at John’s question blunt.
John shrugs.
James stares at Sherlock as he speaks, his eyes round with horror.
“Thank you.”
After Sherlock retired to his room last night, John moved Rosie to the upstairs bedroom in the car seat and decided to just go with the rule-breaking; they cuddled together the entire night, safe and snug, and only woke briefly for a couple of feedings.
“What affair?”
“The head trainer of the RTI program was so surprised by his abilities he even had him take a polygraph test in a controlled environment. He lied through his teeth but passed with flying colours.”
“This seems like the sort of research you might want to do, in case the mole you spoke of is indeed among our ranks,” Mycroft says, and Sherlock nods. “I’ll leave this with you, then.”
John.
“But wait a minute, if you’re recruiting him to be a double agent, how can you be sure he won’t tell his handlers about it?” John asks. “That he won’t betray you?”
“Oh, right,” John says. “Do you… do you want to order in or go out?”
John’s blood boils at the memories. He’s happy David had brought that up. It’s time they talk about this properly.
intelligence gathering capabilities that would put to shame some countries’ intelligence agencies, considering. What did he have on
“I think they’re Scottish, ma’am—”
“Yes. We were on duty together that night.”
“That you’re worried she’s left you for somebody else. I don’t think she did.”
“You heading for the hospital again?” Lestrade asks and John nods.
John’s head is dizzy and his mouth is dry. His breaths are shallow and heavy and he tastes bile.
As always, I'm not a medical professional and it's possible I got a few things wrong discussing Mr. Holmes' condition. Apologies if that's the case.
the first one reads.
She turns to look over at the others. Her breath catches. While she was lost in thoughts, John migrated to sit next to Sherlock.
“If he said it, it must be.”
“How do you know about the speech?”
“You won’t know till you ask,” Mary says in that pushy sort of way she does that John had always found so lovely. “And there’s not much time left, you know. We’ll need to know before we finalize everything. I’ll ask him myself if you won’t.”
John tilts his head towards a chair to signal to Sherlock to sit down whilst he talks to the doctor. Sherlock is listening intently and probably understands much of the doctor’s briefing. He hopes to give him space in these initial few minutes to get his bearings, seeing his father in this condition for the first time.
"What if I told you she's not been as dormant as you think she is?" John asks, undeterred.
“Do you… live here?” Sherlock frowns. David’s possessions are scattered all over the room like he seemingly left the place abruptly. How is that possible? Last he checked, David’s GPS locator had placed him at his friend’s house, earlier today.
John opens the other text that awaits him. This one is from James.
“That’s…”
Time ceased existing that day.
The man opens the door and steps inside. They lose sight and sound of him for a short minute before he suddenly opens the door with a bang, scanning the area, looking for Alexander.
"We're going to see Sherlock," he tells her. "He's been ignoring Daddy. We need to make sure he's alright."
“'Gap year'? Sherlock, what is this?”
Looking at himself in the mirror before he leaves the room, he wonders what Sherlock will deduce about him when they finally meet.
With a sigh he checks his pockets, making sure his fake passport is there; he’ll need it for his checkpoint passage into Gaza. Looking down, he stares at his passport photo, a stranger looking back at him. Gaunt. Short, ginger hair, brown contacts. He’s flaunting a scruffy beard these days, the red hairs glimmering in the Middle Eastern sun. He stands out like a lighthouse in the streets of Gaza on the rare occasion he leaves their hideout.
Mary’s the one who left. She’s the one John is angry with. How did he end up hurting Sherlock?
“He cried that entire night,” David says. “I’ve hated Aldridge for doing that to him. I still do.”***
He rubs his hands in an instinctive attempt to warm up, blessedly finding a cosy looking blanket on the folding bed. He sits on it, his back to the wall, listening for footsteps.
He takes a deep, measured breath; the doctor in him kicks into action, in an attempt to calm his nerves. Sherlock is waiting for him at the bolthole. Sherlock, who’s been listening to every word, hearing John confessing to David about things he’d never tell anyone else.
John’s shoulders tighten.
What good is sacrificing yourself for another person’s happiness, when that person chooses to be miserable? What was the purpose of killing a man for Mary’s sake, for John’s, if John just ends up throwing his marriage away?
“You must have some theory about what happened that night,” John says. “David must have talked about it.”
The pull throws them off their feet and Sherlock sways, teetering forward (
“John.” Sherlock whispers, hoping to be rescued.
“Is safe. We have them.” Edwin nods and stands up. “You’re free to go, Corporal. Thank you for your cooperation.”
“Maybe we can start taking cases again soon, you know. Meeting with clients. Maybe after Christmas.” John prods gently.
have to do is sit back and watch it happen.” Mrs. Norbury smiles, a wide, satisfied smile.
Ten minutes turn into twenty, and as the signs indicate Buckinghamshire and High Wycombe, David’s car takes an unexpected exit.
*****
"Hi John. How was your day?" Molly asked, taking a seat at one of the student desks in the front.
Sherlock was the heartthrob of the Holmes siblings, gaining many admirers while they were in England. He was no stranger to sex, he’d lost his virginity at fourteen to Emilia Rigoletti, an exchange student from Italy who attended school with him. Emilia had chased Sherlock since the first day she arrived at Appledore, and he had all but ignored her until the day she nearly burnt down the school by deliberately setting a fire in the chemistry lab. When she told him she did it to get back at their chemistry professor, who Sherlock also hated, he walked with her back to her house and they slept together. They dated for nine months, until Sherlock laid eyes her on her older brother Dario, who was eighteen and on break from university. Sherlock promptly dumped Emilia and began sleeping with Dario. Emilia threatened revenge, until his sister Eurus said she would reveal to everyone that Emilia actually set fire to the chemistry lab because she was angry the chemistry professor ended their illicit affair. But Sherlock’s dalliance with Dario didn’t last, after Mr. & Mrs. Rigoletti realized that an eighteen year-old sleeping with a fourteen year-old didn’t look good for the family’s reputation. It was also at that time that Sherlock knew he only wanted to be with boys from then on, and be with them he did. His parents and Mycroft were horrified at promiscuous behavior, but Eurus found it amusing.
"Jimmy sweetheart, ignore it. They're probably going into the mansion. It's a popular place to shag in," Eurus said. She placed a kiss on Jim's nose then bucked her hips up. "Come on baby, start moving."
John watched the snow come down as he stood behind the store counter, folding shirts. He had taken a sales clerk job at Hackett and London on Jermyn Street so he could have spending money for Christmas, and it gave him something to do on the weekends when he didn't have classes that didn't involve boozing it up at the pubs. Both his dad and his sister were in outpatient rehab for alcoholism and they were doing great. He wanted to set an example and not be a hypocrite by avoiding the drink. For the first time in many years, Christmas at the Watson house was going to be a good one and he was looking forward to going home.
John’s face crumples in pain and he looks down at the floor, and now it’s Sherlock who wishes the ground would open beneath his feet. But then John lifts his head, shaking it in disbelief, and a guilty giggle fills the room, high-pitched and beautiful.
He clears his throat. “Looks like it, yeah.”
“I was shocked when he said yes when we invited him, but he said it was some sort of dare," Lestrade explains. "I assumed you dared him to socialize, or terrorize, more like it. So did you win or lose?”
“Two phones. An iPhone Alison bought for you and a Nokia you bought at ASDA and only used once. Why?”
“And if push comes to shove we can always use a honey trap,” Edwin says.
He think.
“I understand, John.” And yet.
He puts his hands in his pockets, turning away hesitantly. He’s never comfortable leaving Sherlock behind, but this time he’s going to.
. In fact, I know you quite well.”
“How does what work?”
A besotted smile escapes him when Sherlock turns to look at him. Sherlock half-smiles in return as he takes a sip of tea, that crooked grin John loves so much.
. There are short, delicate curls crowning her head now. Perhaps she’s grown softer with motherhood. Perhaps she doesn’t have the time or energy to keep regular appointments with her stylist.
this, you hanging on to every mistake, every… indiscretion, and just dangling it over my head for eternity like some righteous saint.”
"Just popped in to see how Sherlock's doing." John says, directing his words to Sherlock and not rising to Mycroft’s bait. He moves to his chair and sits down with Rosie in his lap.
They go on talking for a few more minutes, about Michael (“
“Oh.” John says and looks away, because isn’t that the most common and most frustratingly misleading assumption about the two of them. “No. We… No.”
“Never heard of them.”
Sherlock stares at the photo. “She’s beautiful, John.”
“Why’s that important? His movements?”
“Yeah.” John croaks. “Yeah, I figured that out, believe it or not.” The moment stretches. When Sherlock doesn’t offer an explanation, he continues. “You, er… you didn’t say you’re in touch.”
“Where were you?” he asks. “I told you I have to leave by four at the latest.”
John frowns in confusion. “What are you doing?”
"I thought you had a case. You said you couldn’t come over for dinner last night." John wonders what's the point of pretending. Sherlock never comes over to the flat unless he absolutely has to, and when he does, he looks like a fish out of water. He thought he saw Sherlock planning exit routes the first time he was there, after Mary shot him. John couldn't blame him. He can’t say he never did the same himself.
“John...” Sherlock says hesitantly.
—despite Jonathan, and the others too, there wasn’t a day while he was away that he didn’t think of her, when her voice wasn’t a constant presence in his mind.
John clears his throat loudly, searching for Sherlock’s eyes.
“So? Am I not allowed to check on him? To make sure he’s alright?”
Sherlock doesn’t answer till morning. John laughs as he reads the reply on his way to the surgery.
“What are you doing here?” Sherlock demands angrily.
He needs every bit of data he can find about David, his section, the compound he was abducted from, his abductors, and of course—Abu Nazir.
“Can I help you?” someone asks.
Sherlock swallows, taken aback. “I was just doing my job.”
Sherlock stares still, his mind at a standstill.
“Have you considered it, John?”
“What will it be like? When I come back?” Sherlock asks and John understands the question. Sherlock wants to know details. Logistics. Where will they live, what they’ll be to each other.
“There was none. It felt like it always did.”
He awakens hours later, his mouth dry and his head pulsing. He finds his way to the door in the early evening darkness, tearing it wide open.
When John returns to the Holmes house he finds Mrs. Holmes in the midst of baking.
Sherlock stares out the cab window, hoping to ignore the man into silence. He watches as his breath, a white vapour, fogs the back seat window.
“Go back to sleep.” John whispers.
“Oh, hello, Dr. Watson,” The DI welcomes him.
“Sounds lonely.”
“Food?”
The rest of conversation is nothing but a haze, his brain humming restlessly like a beehive under attack. Later he recalls Lottie mentioning that she’ll be visiting with her mother the next day; she hopes her mother will be able to shed some light on her uncle’s past, and why the necklace ended up in his possession.
(See the end of the chapter for
had to. John would have gladly gone himself, leaving both Sherlock and Mary and their cruel, taunting smiles behind if it wasn’t for the baby Mary’s carrying.
Abu Nazir, by the way?”
“And you said nothing.”
John raises his glass, looking for Sherlock’s eyes as he does so.
“You never really asked yourself why, did you?”
Sherlock hums and awards John with a small smile for his goodwill.
His delayed arrival to Innsbruck means a cascading change to his plans over the next few weeks. He’ll need to readjust his plans. This will hold him back for a while, since in Innsbruck he expects to deal with two of Moriarty’s largest crime rings. They are seemingly normal main-street businesses, used to cover up huge drug- and human-trafficking operations. The leaders of the rings are, fortunately, idiots. The type Sherlock met nearly every day in London, so he’s not as worried as he was in other locations so far.
The table falls silent again. David looks at Aldridge stunned, blinking.
“Yes?”
His body tenses when he hears the door to John’s room open and footsteps on the stairs. Nervous, he drops the slides he’s holding onto the floor where they lay broken. He curses himself quietly over his clumsiness, of how sensitive and responsive he is to John’s anger.
Edwin clears his throat and turns towards them, his back straight. “He rang me a few hours after he left last night and asked for a short, supervised conversation with him.”
Alison nods, holding back a sob and taking a big, grounding breath. “David, listen—”
The smile on David’s face dissolves as he realizes the extent of Sherlock’s knowledge of the inner workings of his life. It takes him only a fraction of a second to recover, however.
“I’m sure it did,” Mycroft says hesitantly, “but the timing’s rather suspicious, wouldn’t you say? Why are we only hearing about this now?”
Sherlock's eyes narrow for a split second, as if he's about to speak.
Sherlock nods minutely. “Once?”
Sherlock frowns. John grabs the last box. “Salmon for me.”
“And those were only the first few weeks there.”
“Christmas.”
Sherlock breathes impatiently through a wave of tsking and “My condolences” and “I’m sorry”.
Intoxicated with the mix of pain, heat, and arousal, Sherlock does exactly as commanded. John is hard as a rock, coiled, and ready to burst. Despite his commanding voice so far, John speaks softly in his ear now, encouraging him; “
David’s face twist with shock. “What?”
He hangs behind, letting her gain some distance as she walks down the street. Stealing one last glance at the house, he sees the light in the attic come on. Wincing once again at this permanent blind spot, he sighs and follows.
“All these secrets… it’d happened before. It usually ends with you running away or jumping off a roof or high on a plane. I’d just like to know you trust me enough to confide in me.”
“When has Sherlock Holmes ever bullied me into anything?” Lestrade huffs, and John returns the favour, a genuine one this time.
“No. I couldn’t be anywhere else if I wanted to. I couldn’t go home to her, could I?”
“Do you want me to go?” John asks, hiding his relief when Sherlock doesn’t answer. “I’m staying, then.”
“A lie by omission is still a lie.” John says, repulsed by Alexander’s condescension towards James’ condition. “Which field is that?”
“I want my gun back.” John says, catching Sherlock by surprise.
David leers incredulously. “What?”
He hates it that way.
“Come on.”
This is my fifth fic ever, and my first foray into a case fic (found it very scary to write one so far). The case is
“What happened this morning?” John asks. “You said somebody was dying?”
Sherlock nods.
This isn’t the first time he thinks about it, but he never talked to anyone but Harry about this.
John freezes when the details of the dinner they were supposed to have on Monday evening start rushing through his head.
Hamish ,known to his friends as Jamie, as it turned out, was an ambitious, promising young man. Army service was a family tradition for the Watsons—John’s grandfather was the last in a long line of naval officers who served Queen and Country faithfully. John’s father, on the other hand, was promptly disqualified due to a back surgery he’d undergone as a child.
“Yes, sir.”
“What do you mean?”
Sherlock’s back straightens unconsciously. “Your Catholic prayer beads?”
“Could you give us a minute please, Mycroft?”
“John, please…”
fix this.”
“I can do that.”
"I'm not a violent woman, but I could kill you for what you did to my John. Because of your sick and disgusting actions, he left town. He's terrified of you. And if you ever come near him again, I'll make sure John presses charges. Do I make myself clear?" She stared at him murderously.
The trip to Victor's took only ten minutes and he was soon walking towards the nondescript building, basking in the early spring sunshine. He entered the studio and saw Sarah sitting at her desk rapidly typing. He approached her and she looked up at him and smiled. "Good afternoon John. Victor and Kitty are already here and waiting. Go on back."
Sherlock was growing a bit impatient...and was growing down below too. He was so ready, and John was taking his sweet old time like always.
"What happened?" the cop asked Anderson.
Cliffhanger time! Will someone come to Molly's rescue?
Sherlock instantly wrapped his long arms around his doctor. "John, we did it!"
He still could observe though. It's what he was good at anyway.
The other boy, bleeding profusely, tried to get up, but fell back on the ground. "God, it hurts! I feel like my head's gonna come off!" he moaned.
"Say what Hal? Please, just tell me!"
John ignored his sister. "Mr. Holmes, do you think I could see Sherlock? I feel so guilty." His blue eyes were watery, and his lips were trembling.
*****
Wanda Watson returned home from a busy day at work to find John in the driveway along with Sherlock. The two were waxing and polishing John's car. Rock music played from the car radio. She couldn't help but smile at the sweet sight. Sherlock had come quite a way in less than a month, proving his friendship to John. Well, love actually. Wanda knew the boy was head over heels for her son. Sometimes she wondered if she was a good mother, allowing her son to be around someone who made such strong advances, after what happened in LA with the first boy, and then Sebastian Wilkes last year, but unlike those two boys, John really liked Sherlock. He trusted him. And John did not trust many people right away. There had to be something about Sherlock that John saw. Maybe John knew Sherlock was capable of being a decent guy. As long as they took things slow and careful, she was okay. Too many teenagers today jumped right into the first steady relationship they had.
"Oh I've seen them, and they decided they didn't want to live with their mom and her boyfriend. My sister agreed to take them in. Wasn't a hard decision as she's been widowed for a while and was getting lonely, and she loves her niece and nephew. They're happy, and I visit them when I'm off work. Jill didn't fight it, she really wasn't much of mum in my opinion. And they like Molly, always have, so everyone wins."
"I actually don't like the song either, but it is what it is," Sherlock replied matter-of-fact.
"Would you like something to drink? I've got soda and homemade iced tea," Wanda offered.
"It's a match made in heaven. He's a soldier's son, she's a cop's daughter, they're both tough as nails---honestly, it should have happened ages ago," Janine had said. I heard Little Seb's dad was over the moon, and Mary's parents said she couldn't do any worse."
“Good night, John.”
“Come on.” John says, resigned. “Let’s go back. I need... I need to think.”
