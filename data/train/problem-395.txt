“You’ll need to be more specific. Earlier, you nearly killed a paparazzo, and--also earlier--I was nearly shivved.”
I could not help but think that Fate had a cruel way of bringing me back to Holmes. Somehow, I had ended up where I was when my life started anew, that is, when I met Holmes. I have loved and lost love one too many times in my life and I knew then, at that moment, that Holmes would end that terrible streak of misfortune. Holmes was, indisputably, my past, my present, and my future—and I knew that I would not lose him for a very long time.
He’s also caught off guard by not knowing, decisively, whether he’s more jealous of Mary or of Sherlock, or if he simply wants to edge between them and--
“It’s really such a noble sacrifice, Sherlock, for you to assume the role of John’s lover for the sake of Mummy’s peace of mind,” Mycroft oils. “I imagine it is a
“Cheers,” John tells the bartender as he pulls out his wallet and counts a few banknotes. “Maybe grab that booth over there?” he says to Sherlock in an aside, jerking his chin at an empty booth tucked away in a corner of the room.
Sherlock gingerly turns onto his other side so he can watch John in his slumber. If Sherlock were to wake up to this sight every day, he wouldn’t need much else. This would be his air.
But then his eyes meet Sherlock’s, and his grin lessens, softening into something more wistful. Sherlock has the faintest smile ghosting his lips, his eyes gleaming, and it makes John’s heart kick up into a gallop.
“If there is anyone who does not have a problem finding a partner with whom to have sex, it’s you, John. In 2011, for example, you dated 43 women.”
After Rosie’s been put to sleep (and Sherlock’s washed his face) Sherlock settles in the corner of the room in a hard-backed chair wedged between the telly and his workdesk so he has decent vantage point for observing the merry goings-on.
At the front of the room, Mummy is holding a tray of filled champagne flutes. She zips from person to person, handing them off, then plucks up one of her own and takes the floor.
in time with each of John’s rhythmic, precise pulses, smoothing his hands down John’s rippling back, tacky with a film of sweat.
Sherlock angles his pelvis toward John’s hand, wanting more contact, and slides his own hand across John’s stomach before raking his fingers a bit lower to trail the hem of John’s jeans.
They stare at each other for a heartbeat before John reaches out for Sherlock’s sunglasses. Stops. “Um. Mind if I...?”
, so he shuffles across the seat on his knees, sits on his haunches, pushes John’s hand away, and leans over to swallow John down.
The great-nieces thread their arms together and walk to the edge of the grave, peering meditatively into its depths. One of them takes a handful of earth and unfurls it over the casket.
“You’re so fucking sexy like this,” John says in Sherlock’s ear, low and guttural, moving Sherlock’s arm out of the way to hook his own underneath Sherlock’s knee.
there--when his boot catches on a deep divot that twists his ankle and sends him down like a sack of potatoes, face-planting into the grass.
“You want to live with me...there.” Sherlock’s eyes dart to the deed and back to John’s face. “In Norfolk. ‘Down the line.’”
“That would be the port,” Mycroft oozes, leaning urbanely against the kitchen entryway in a too-formal three-piece suit and observing the festivities with the air of an anthropologist.
Sherlock squeezes John's hand, and he tips his head to rest it against John's. "My emotions clouded my judgment." He sounds a touch embarrassed. "You were simply doing what we discussed; you needed to be convincingly infatuated with Starr. And for that, I apologise."
“Yeah, come on, Sherlock,” John says huskily, muffled, the vibrations of his deepened voice reverberating through Sherlock’s body. “Ride my face.”
It took a moment, perhaps due to my faculties being slowed by drink, but I soon understood he was referring to me and felt my cheeks flush. I took a great gulp of whiskey and felt emboldened to return a compliment to him.
I observed him sceptically. Perhaps he sensed my scrutiny, for he said without turning to look at me, “It is nothing. I have bumped my hands against the table and it is swollen and mottled. An ugly sight. That is all.”
Sherlock pulls her in toward his chest, resituates his hands so they’re tabletop-flat, bolstering her chest and stomach, and lifts her into the air.
John hesitates for a moment before swinging a leg over and sitting on his knees astride Sherlock, hovering, not daring to have his arse make contact with any part of Sherlock’s body. Here, he’s better positioned to smooth the sun cream down the expanse of Sherlock’s pale back, across ridges of old scars and raised moles. He is meticulous in his application, leaving no window of skin unslathered.
Holmes flitted his eyes over my face, as if searching for some kind of physical marking there that belied my statement.
John kisses him and pets his hair. Sherlock wishes sorely for his bed back at 221b, wishes for the freedom to hold John close, to wrap himself around him and never let go.
Somehow saddened and uplifted all the same by Holmes’s speech, I turned his warm hand around and caressed the back of it lightly with my index finger as if it were fine Chinese silk. Holmes’s fingers twitched at the touch.
Sherlock opens his mouth slightly to allow John’s tongue in and their lips move together with a pretty, slurping wetness until John resituates himself on his side, with his head on a pillow. Sherlock mirrors him.
Holmes’s villa was situated on the southern slope of the Downs and there were remarkable views of the Channel where majestic white chalk cliffs jutted out into its coast-line. It was a reclusive place, a lone cottage far removed from the already sparse humanity in the vicinity, but it was homey. That particular visit was my third, but I still managed to be enchanted by the Downs’s natural charm.
“My dear,” Holmes started quietly, a hint of surprised exasperation infused in the words. “I would like nothing more than for you share lodgings with me once again.” Suddenly, he was energised and amicable and announced grandly, “Perhaps, in the scheme of things, my gruesome hands have resulted in some good, after all!”
“--and far be it from me to leave you boys,” a hard look at Mycroft, “without you knowing, with certainty, how much I adore you.” Then, barbed, “I will not be my mother.” Forces a smile that gradually softens into something real. “So all that is to say: Happy Birthday, dear heart. We love you.”
Dad and John appear to have reached a handshake stalemate. John audibly swallows. Dad still has his smile on, but it’s become taut.
“If you must know,” Sherlock begins, already regretting what he is about to say, “I’ve been tracking the progress you’ve made since you began watching those egregious YouTube exercise videos. ‘
“It was,” Mycroft says, speaking for the first time in awhile, and he sounds delighted. Or as delighted as Mycroft has the capacity to sound.
John pinches the bridge of his nose. “It’s--a metaphor, and we’re going to ignore everything I’ve just said because we shouldn’t be talking about this, you’re
Danny hadn’t liked being catapulted into the spotlight, so he scrambles to disappear back behind his father’s leg. Hafiz tuts, his hand returning to rest on the boy’s head, protective. “Sorry, he’s been like this since...well, since the divorce. Kind of retreating into himself, you know. We’re working on it.”
John is watching Sherlock in a way he’s never done before; as his focus of affection, desire. Sherlock has never had someone look at him this way.
He knows suddenly nothing about everything--when, before, he’d known everything about nothing--focussed only on John and John’s lips and kissing them. Closeness. John’s scent; masculine and familiar. John. Affection, or--yes. Affection.
After some deliberation, John expectedly chooses a beer, closes the fridge door, and begins his search for the bottle opener.
Before John can register anything at all, Sherlock is pushing him up against the wall and kissing the life out of him.
John indignantly places (or, more accurately, bangs) his pint glass back onto the table. “Come on, now.”
“Oh, now you do?” John says, sliding his hands down the sides of Sherlock’s torso, tickling over ribs.
John’s eyes are fixed on the back of the seat in front of him, his chin raised almost in defiance, and on the seat in the space between them lies John’s upturned palm, an unwavering invitation.
“Today,” she begins with booming gravitas, as if delivering a speech to a full amphitheatre, “we celebrate you, my darling.” She indicates Sherlock with her drink. “I can’t think of anyone more deserving of praise. Your father and I are so proud of all you’ve done for the world.”
A gobsmacked man with a child in tow are making their ways through the crowd toward John, and as they get closer, a few essential facts about the man jump out:
When he resurfaces, he looks to the distant shore and finds Sherlock and Rosie watching him from dry sand. Sherlock is sitting with his legs stretched out before him, hands braced behind his back, and Rosie is beside him, jumping and waving at John like a little jumping bean. It is
One of the rowdier constables, a rough-looking young woman, is beckoning Greg over to the other side of the room, holding up a tray of filled shotglasses like an offering to the gods. It's a siren call that Greg answers without second thought.
“Oh, John, how rude of us,” Mummy says. “You’ll be wanting to put down your things and get settled.” John nods absently, looking a bit out of sorts as he hefts the strap of the duffel bag over his shoulder. “I was thinking you boys could take the guest room with the Sargent painting. You know the one, Sherlock.” He does, and doesn’t miss that she hadn’t designated the room John and Mary shared two Christmases ago. “Go and show John the way.”
“Siger was there, too, of course.” Mummy pats Dad’s knee. “He was also beautiful. My beautiful man.”
John settles in beside Rosie as Sherlock takes his turn in the sea, jogging and diving into a massive wave, disappearing under the water for a few moments until he springs up like a mermaid, flicking his sopping curls off his face. John rolls his eyes at the Drama, but his heart is all a-flutter. He is
“I know we’re friends, good friends, yeah? But. I’ve been thinking. A lot.” Lestrade smiles crookedly. Molly’s mouth is hanging agape, her eyes darting from Sherlock to Lestrade. “About us. For a while. And, you know, well...I’d really like to take you out to dinner.”
“Yes, all right, I think we’ve heard enough,” Sherlock bites out. (It’s not Sherlock’s fault that summers spent in Yorkshire were so dull. Nor was he to blame for the gutter man’s fetching appearance [tan, compact, amply muscled, glorious].)
John purses his lips and contemplates the floor. “Right,” he says.  “Christ, how did I not know that? After all these years?”
“Thanks,” John says, peering over Sherlock’s shoulder. Greg had been tasked with placating Rosie; she’d very clearly been crying, her face is streaked pink, and the sight breaks John’s heart. “Shit.”
Once the man’s footsteps clop past the alleyway and recede into silence, they go lax, collapsing against each other in relief.
John’s eyes have drifted downwards to Sherlock’s lips, and he’s barely finished saying, “Kiss me, then” when Sherlock surges forward.
"You were concerned because I did not reciprocate. Forgive me. I was distracted by the way you were nearly devouring me." I did not know what to say. I was so thunderstruck by Holmes’s words. Holmes cocked his head thoughtfully. "I was rather pleasantly distracted, mind."
John is squeezing Sherlock’s head between his hands and kissing him, a fierce and desperate press of lips to lips, unmoving, spurts of breath coming out of his nose, tasting the salt of a wayward tear (his own or Sherlock’s?), the thrum of his pulse matching the beat of three previously inconceivable words as they strobe in his mind:
He should have known Mycroft would inevitably stick his (massive) nose in it, he just hadn’t expected it so soon. He hadn’t taken the time to mask any tells, and John is practically a living, breathing X-rated film.
“We left you alone with him, did he say something? It’s his MO, after all, to be a prick. I’ll knock his bloody block off if he did.”
Rosie slides over until she is pressed up against Sherlock’s side, grabs Sherlock’s hand. Attuned to John’s body language, she can tell that something is not right with her father.
Sherlock is a lone man on a park bench watching over a child. He’s statistically less likely to be a paid minder, as a man, especially at his age, and can’t possibly be a kidnapper hiding in plain sight--Rosie shows no discomfort being in his presence. So, yes, Sherlock being Rosie’s parent makes sense, and although Rosie looks nothing like him, it can be assumed that her mother’s genes had won out.
,” John says. Projects his voice for Rosie’s sake: “They’re just flowers. They’ll grow bigger and better than ever.”
establishment when I was 16. It allowed me to hone my skills; there was quite the treasure trove of people to observe. And since gossip is ubiquitous, I was able to confirm my observations with ease.”
John calms down, left with aftershocks of huffing laughter, and says, “I can’t fucking believe this. How long have you wanted to ask me to--to dinner?”
John had rattled his painstakingly-built foundations, and he's not been able to revert back to that hardened version of himself he’d once been. And even when John had left him, had gone off and married Mary, he’d vowed to try and keep as much of John as he could.
There was no furniture to speak of, only boxes with various indecipherable markings upon them. The sight of the near-naked sitting room, a place wherein I spent my halcyon years beside the man with whom I was in love, caused the back of my eyes to prick with tears.
He wants to tell John how he’s made Sherlock a better man; how he would be led astray without John; how he’s never enjoyed the company of someone even as iota as much as he has John’s; how a great deal of his waking moments are occupied with thoughts of John; how Sherlock is in
“Nah. She’s been looking at me all night,” Wiggins says, smoothing down his wrinkled t-shirt. “It’s the shirt, I think. Brings out the ocean blue of me eyes.”
They settle in a spot as far away as possible from the couples and families speckling the hill, spreading a blanket over the grass. Sherlock sprawls out on top of it, the sun smoothing a layer of warmth across his exposed skin.
I hesitated perhaps a moment too long, because Holmes said pawkily, "Please, do tone down your enthusiasm."
And then he takes Sherlock’s hand by the wrist, peering up at Sherlock from beneath his lashes, and presses a tender kiss to Sherlock’s pulse point, which jumps at the contact.
Stacked in the closet are a few boxes gathering dust. Sherlock unearths the one he needs, pulls out the sketchbook, and sits with it spread across his lap on the old, creaking bed.
Sherlock has his back to Mary, now, and she places a hand on his undulating hip and fits behind him, pretends to grind up against him. Sherlock looks over his shoulder at her and smirks, and she throws back her head and laughs.
“Nah, you know I’m impervious to his prick--uh, prick-ery,” John garbles. Greg is still hovering oppressively over him, so John gives Greg’s chest a little shove, regretting it immediately as Greg nearly trips over his feet and faceplants. He grabs Greg's arm. “Sorry! Fuck. Sorry.”
Sherlock turns his attention back to John, whose body is stiff, hands clenching nervously at his sides. Based on the man's age and profession, Sherlock suspects he had been a schoolmate of John’s, and apparently one of whom had caused John some grief.
I looked up at Holmes, who was affecting unconcern, feeling at a loss. “I wish you would have alerted me in the early stages of the affliction. I could have taken care of you and helped prevent it from worsening.”
They commandeer a sandy spot for themselves--a bit behind and to the side of the other beach goers--and John pitches their tent while Sherlock answers Rosie’s stream of questions:
As he’s pouring steeped tea out of the kettle, Sherlock hears someone (John, by the sound of the tread) approach, feels fingers dragging lazily across his back.
Sulkily, Sherlock curls up into a ball and turns his attention back to the great open pastures of--wherever they are. Somewhere unimportant.
Sherlock hadn’t had good footing. Or, more precisely, he hadn’t expected John to shove him. The man who knows it all hadn’t seen it coming, and it’s John’s turn to feel
“John,” Holmes panted, “there is nothing I would like to do more at this very moment than to fuck myself on your prick.”
This litany of superlatives caused the back of my eyes to prickle with tears. Holmes rarely spoke so freely or with such approbation. “Do you really think that?”
Alongside the warmwet slide of his mouth, Sherlock wraps a fist around the base of John’s cock, his hand picking up the colour there as he pumps, spreading the lipstick over John’s length. John’s cock is defiling Sherlock’s paint, making an obscene art of it, and it is the
John isn’t gay, and he’s not straight, either, but he’s not exactly divulged that to anyone over the past 18 years--since his self-realisation--and isn’t about to start now. It would change everything, were he to come out. It’d change how people see him and how he’s meant to be and live his life. And, more importantly, John had made a vow to Mary. He’s not free. He has a daughter who needs a mother. Two parents.
His mind has once again decided to stutter on the new information that John Watson had the option to
Sherlock crawls over John’s body like a sinuous cat and presses a kiss to John’s neck, then dots measured, delicate kisses down John’s body--on his right pectoral, on the paunch of his stomach, right above his hip bone, stamping perfect lip prints in his wake. John feels delightfully branded:
“--used the diamond-dusted ribbon tied around his wife’s Christmas present to cut through the bars and escape his cell,” Lestrade is telling his riveted audience.
What if the love of Greg’s ex-wife’s life is the “nobody PE teacher?” And not Greg? Hadn't she deserved to follow her bliss? Undoubtedly, the way in which she’d gone about it had been indelicate, but she had followed it. That's more than John can say about himself. Even when he'd thought Sherlock was dead, he never thought he'd be truly happy, because Mary would never be Sherlock. But he'd found some happiness with Mary and had moved on, to a degree, as one does. And now Sherlock is alive, and John is, once again, squandering the opportunity to be with him.
Jamila recovers easily, places a kiss to John’s pressed-tight lips. “Give Rosie another birthday hug for me.”
John is offended Sherlock hadn’t needed him on other cases. Or had he simply not wanted him there? John had expressly asked to be included if anything had come up. And, in all honesty, he had wanted to see Sherlock more often, but hadn’t known how else to see him without the excuse of casework, which is undoubtedly the fulcrum of their relationship.
Though...Sherlock never does seem to twig anything. Even when John’s been a bit more obvious, these days. Even when John has finally
John deflates, looks away. “It was in the moment, it was stupid, and I looked like a knob doing it."
When I arrived, it was late evening. The stars were more vibrant than those in London, unimpeded by polluted skies, and the air much colder due to its proximity to the Channel. I knocked on Holmes’s ivy-laced door, and Holmes answered after only a few moments.
a couple (and don’t intend to until John is mentally prepared for the reveal—and for all the fussing and tiresome conversations).
2. Tu ne demandes pas assez de moi. Je voudrais que tu en demandes plus = You do not ask for enough. I wish you would want more from me.
“Hello, gorgeous husband. Miss me?” Mary is saying in a cheery fortissimo, grabbing John’s face between her small, clammy hands and giving him a smothering kiss on the lips.
, and it will have to be enough. Because who else, really, in this dreadful world would make so many allowances for Sherlock? Sherlock is ceaselessly rude, inconsiderate, and mercurial by nature. And John accepts him;
It’s a monumental thing to say, for sure. Sherlock must respond in kind. He tries. “If I can, I would like to give you and Rosie everything. For as long as I live."
for many years.  Holmes and I had been in an unconsummated marriage of sorts, for all that time. Very happily, the marriage was finally consummated, though not solemnised, and it was unjust that I could not solemnise a marriage borne of a purer love than any other I had experienced.
John presses up, deepening their kiss, and then their mouths begin to move in frenzied tandem, tongues lick along tongues, bullish breaths spurt out of noses, moans and groans, and Sherlock writhes on top of John’s body, clumsily finds their cocks and aligns them, begins to pump his hips.
“I wish I had a set-up like that.” She glances over forlornly at the empty computer chair to her right. “It’d be a dream having my man right here, next to me, all day. I’ve mates who’ve met their partners through work. Granted, some of them ended up loathing spending so much time together that they eventually got a divorce. But I can’t see that happening if he’s my ‘person,’ you know? I mean, you obviously know.”
John doubles over and braces his hands on his knees, hanging his head, all too grateful for a moment to catch his breath. After his breathing gentles, he lifts his head in the direction of the bleachers, where girlfriends, wives, Greg, and Sherlock, Rosie perched on his knee, sit.
“Well, it’s clear that your lack of communication did not diminish the high-esteem in which she held you,” Mycroft says. Then, the slightest bit softer, “You were her favourite.”
An hour to midnight, we settled upon the neutral and pertinent subject of New Year’s traditions as practiced by my Scottish ancestors and which were, by that year,
“Be quick, my man. I can’t stand it,” Holmes said, breathless, turning around and climbing needily atop me, all limbs, kissing me sloppily.
He moved that exploratory hand sideways, sprawled flat against my chest like a great white spider, then down along my waist until it rested on my hip.
John skids to a halt. “That was real. In there.” He jabs a finger at the closed door. “It was real.”
John is trying to fight a smile as his hands travel up further, making their ways under Sherlock’s shirt. “I really want--can I just touch you?”
This gives John pause. He and Sherlock had only gone on 2 cases within the past 6 months, and he’d been gasping for more because life in suburbia is utter hell, and while he loves Rosie to bits, the tedium of parenthood is driving him round the twist. In desperation to be unstuck from the stultifying inertia, he's been texting Sherlock once a week, like clockwork, to see if there were cases on (which, frankly, also doubled as an excuse to check in on the man), no matter how uninspired they were, but 8 times out of 10 John had either been ignored or brushed off.
He locks John’s mobile and places it atop the sidetable on his flank of the bed, next to his own mobile, which is lighting up with reams of texts from
Straightening back up, his eyes latch briefly somewhere southward of John’s waist, and John valiantly tries to ignore any kind of stirrings in said southward area. He can't help that it likes the attention; Sherlock's attention, in particular.
John blinks off the whiplash. “I don’t think I’ve ever heard you say those words, in that order. But what exactly was I right about?”
John fiddles with his empty tumbler, looks anywhere in the room but at Sherlock. “Took me a while to figure out that I wasn’t...straight. It was right around when I started med school; 24, 25. Didn't want to accept it. But I couldn’t ignore it.”
And with that look, if John hadn't know any better, if he'd been a third-party watching their little scene play out from afar, he'd say that Sherlock's target, the heinous criminal he was after, was
I was startled by his sudden woeful passion. He promptly flung himself onto the settee and sprawled out like a great cat, head turned away from me.
Sherlock is waiting for him on the pitch just in front of the bleachers. He looks like he wants to reach out for John, his arm stuttering forward, but decides against it. “Hospital?”
Unwittingly, Sherlock jerks forward and bangs his head on the water basin with a loud, hollow clang.
together,” John tells Sherlock without preamble, easily picking up the thread started at the museum. “I also wanted him to think I wasn’t the coward I was all those years ago. That I could be out.”
He allowed me to remain holding his hand, which was undoubtedly a perk of the sparsely populated countryside, where few unfriendly eyes could fall upon us.
Rosie is starry-eyed by the newness of it all, her mouth agape as she gazes up at the dizzying chalk cliffs that loom over the shore.
John seems lost now, perhaps in a distant memory. Trying to recall a name or the sound of a laugh or the shape of a certain woman’s breasts--or something like that, maybe. For once, Sherlock resents his impeccable memory and attention to detail.
My breath caught at the declaration. “I would like nothing more than to be with you, Holmes,” I said impassionedly.
“This is mad, seeing you! You look…” Hafiz’s eyes rove over John’s body a bit too appreciatively for Sherlock’s tastes. “Fantastic.”
“Just this once. Just today,” Sherlock says, pouting his lips in an overexaggerated moue. “Please, John.”
. And in the past couple of hours, John and Dad have established a rapport--at present, Sherlock is staring glazedly into the fire, half-aware of the two of them playing Top Trumps, startled into full-cognizance by their occasional triumphant shout of competitive bluster.
“Don’t be a baby,” John says, getting to his knees beside Sherlock. “If Rosie can endure it, you can too.”
“I will need you to tell my parents that I died. Or that I was murdered, if you'd prefer to add a bit of spice.”
Sherlock decides to make the experience a bit easier, pulling his t-shirt over his head and flinging it aside.
“Do you hear that, mother?” Mummy calls out to her very dead mother, casting a deeply fond look at John. “I may soon very well have three sons!”
“‘Fun’ is subjective, Lestrade. I’d guess rugby only because that is something you and John both deem as ‘fun.’ Though, I’m sure there are other breathtakingly dull activities in which you both find enjoyment.”
John laughs at the absurdity of it. Of Sherlock saying it aloud. Of him having done it at all. “Maybe I did; what of it?"
John looks over. Sherlock is looking back at him with that same soft smile--the one he’d sported on the bleachers. The one had made John want to kiss him desperately, had made him resort to a quaint, sort-of kiss.
Looking to where Sherlock’s drawn his attention, he sees Mary and Greg bumbling back toward them, giggling like a couple of teenagers.
But Sherlock had explained it away, had dismissed any possibility of John’s interest in him as anything more than friends because he couldn’t fathom someone wanting him that way. Who would want Sherlock, who is abrasive and dismissive of goodness? Who is an unfeeling automaton? He is not made to be loved. No one had ever wanted him--even John hadn’t, not for a long time. And maybe Sherlock had been scared of what it could mean. It would transform his role in John’s life. He would take more responsibility with Rosie, and that is something he cannot mishandle. That is something far too precious to get wrong.
“Think you’re funny, hm?” John says, advancing on Sherlock like a panther would its prey. “Think you’re
Finally, John looks at him. “It’s the kind of thing mates tell each other. And you’re my best mate.”
A minute passes in this manner, John displaying a frankly impressive slideshow of emotions on his face, and the mystery of it is too intriguing for Sherlock to resist. “What is it?”
“Fantastic,” John says without any trace of enthusiasm, unable to meet Mummy’s eye as he carefully unwinds his arm from Sherlock and climbs off the bed, restoring his sleep-worn clothing into some semblance of order. “Sorry, it was rude of us to fall asleep on you.”
Sherlock turns around and John hastily undoes Sherlock's trouser button and zip, then his own, and fists both of their hard, pre-come pearled cocks together, pulling at them--silkyhot--in feverish desperation.
Sherlock’s about to back away, but John grabs his arm, pulls Sherlock’s ear toward his mouth. “Your kind of music, then," John says, low and rumbling. "Gives you a leg up. Just like the ballroom dancing.”
No correction: interesting. Often, John is champing at the bit to disprove a stranger’s assumption as to the nature of their relationship. Perhaps John
“That right?” John says with a knife’s edge smile. “Too bad I’ve always thought you were--and are--a tremendous knobhead.”
John has his ankle propped on a pillow, pressing a bag of ice to the swollen mass. He hasn’t moved a muscle in hours, and yet he’s sweating like a bloody pig. He feels…slippery. And unwashed. Even though he’d taken a shower this morning. It's been a muggy day.
Sherlock looks down blankly at John’s head bowed over his lap. Grey strands of hair are more obvious and plentiful at this vantage, and Sherlock wants to count each and every one of them. Wants to press his face into them and breathe John in.
Sherlock and John have gone out together countless times, mostly to restaurants, rarely to pubs, but it’s all the same.
Holmes had been concerningly quiet throughout, so I ran a comforting hand up his back, a terrain of spine nubs, and kissed a freckle. “Are you all right, my darling? Is it painful?”
have even enjoyed it once or twice. But this year, it’s year two without John. John will attend the party, but he isn’t
When he’s run out of excuses and has to once again share the same space as John, it turns out to be an easy task.
John darts his eyes over the room, then slides his hand down Sherlock’s thigh to rest in the juncture where thigh meets groin. Telegraphing:
Holmes sat down on my groin and experimentally rocked against me. I groaned in desperation. “Evidence suggests that you aren’t either.”
Sherlock makes a sarcastic noise at the back of his throat, chirping, “You slept with men in the army?”
“Mr Holmes!” A woman's overeager voice. “I heard you were dining with us and I had to come and see you for myself! I'm Hee-Eun; this is my restaurant. We're so pleased to have you.”
A host of positively filthy thoughts surface to the forefront of Sherlock’s mind, and he shoves it all away.
more substantial than the ones Sherlock has on, a tight black number that cuts off just above the widest part of his muscular thighs.
Then the laughter starts, low and appropriate-sounding, quickly spiraling into something hysterical.
From the corner of his eye, Sherlock watches Molly throw back a generous amount of her drink, survey the room, and clear her throat. A mawkish toast is imminent. Sherlock girds his loins.
“Yes,” Sherlock agrees, handing John his coffee. “An estranged daughter and a deceased husband. Lives alone--well, excepting
Hurt flares within Sherlock’s chest at the intrusive thought, and he is overcome with the clawing need to be alone.
“I know you’re not,” Mary says in the tired manner of someone who’s said the same thing one too many times. She scrapes her chair backwards and stands up, her bearing and expression resolute. “But I’m not going to live the rest of my life as your second best.”
“Well, of course! Though, to be fair, we’re all fascinated by your work, so we’ve a lot of questions. The new one, the ‘Bermondsey Bijoux’ case? I couldn’t believe how you managed to--”
“Just. Stop talking, yeah?” John says out of the side of his mouth, hoisting Rosie up, seating her on the balustrade between himself and Sherlock. “Okay.” He takes on a look of deadly calm. “Now I’m going to tell our friend in the bushes to piss off.”
I had not seen Holmes since my wife’s funeral all those months ago. His hair had grown longer, greyer, and was unkempt; he was gaunter, if possible, and dressed in a tattered mouse-coloured dressing gown, one of his dressing gowns I had noticed he was very fond of when we lived together at Baker Street, and a wrinkled nightshirt. He did not look surprised to see me in the slightest. If anything, he looked pleased.
“Sorry to--thank you. I wanted to make a toast.” With a shaky hand, she holds up her wineglass. “To the lovely Rosie, on her second birthday.”
Sherlock once again decides he will avoid John for the rest of the evening until he cannot anymore. Their charade will end when they take leave of his parents’ house tomorrow (Sherlock will sleep on the sofa tonight), and life will go on as usual. The kiss (good lord, the kiss) can be explained away; it’d been a part of their act, nothing more.
Sherlock levels him with a murderous glare. “Not if I get to you first. And trust me--you’d prefer John to do the job. At least someone would find the body.”
There is anger, of course, but there is something else, something equally painful but invisible, like embers from a roaring beach bonfire that'd been carelessly shoved under cool sand. Not doused, as in proper form. Something John prefers to keep buried.
Alarmed, he pops up his head and digs his fingers into John’s left hip. “Mrs Hudson. Twelve seconds.”
between them) as John sucks on his neck, and once the last button is undone, he hooks a leg around the back of John’s thigh to pull him in, grabs handfuls of John’s arse, and pushes his hips up.
is for John to receive attention in the very way Sherlock has given it. John will soon, inevitably, search for a partner, a woman. A mother for Rosie. John is no longer grieving Mary--that much is obvious. He is ready, priming himself, hoping to attract a mate.
For now, John will soldier on, just like he had moved on after the ballroom dancing lessons. It’s what John Watson does best. Keeps his head down, carries on.
Sherlock breaks into a wry smirk, rolling over--John’s ejaculate trickling out of his arse and over his thigh, onto the bed, much to his satisfaction--and presses into John’s side, feathering his fingertips down John’s chest.
Sherlock positions himself at John’s side and takes a moment to admire John’s eyelashes. Under the haphazardly-strung cool white fairy lights above the bar, his blond eyelashes are limned gold. Sherlock has never thought eyelashes beautiful before, but he’s also never fallen victim to such egregious poeticism before.
“I can’t be sure when I’m to see you next, and I need an answer promptly,” Mycroft says. “I must be taking my leave soon.”
John slaps the table. “My god, how could I forget. Should publish that one in the blog; it’s incredibly thought-provoking.”
John flings out a silencing hand in the direction of the voice, looking out of the corner of his eye flintily, jaw tight: a quiet, blaring warning that
One may recall when I described Holmes as an automaton. Let it be known I had done so on Holmes’s insistence so he appeared more aloof and mysterious; that was how he wished to be perceived by our readers. After a while, Holmes warmed up to me and was able to express himself more fully—he was caring and loving when he wished to be. He always tried hard to repress his emotions but he became more readable and open as the years passed (Well, at the very least, he did with me).
John steps closer, herds Sherlock against the brick and flint of the house, and soon he is close enough for Sherlock to notice his snowflake-dewed eyelashes and eyebrows and strands of hair. Pulse pounding in his ears, Sherlock bows and tilts his head, and his and John’s breaths intermingle in stuttering, vaporous clouds before they close the gap for a kiss.
Sherlock doesn’t get to hear which epithet he is tonight, because he cups the back of John’s head and collides his mouth into John’s.
The bathroom door flies open and out steps Sherlock, coiffed and dressed. Or as dressed as one can be for a day at the beach.
Sherlock fears that the designer jumpers he’s gifted to John, although sorely needed, have turned out to be inadequate and thoughtless in comparison to...this.
John is smiling at the woman, rictus-like. Every fibre of his demeanour screams that he wants her to leave them alone, but the woman remains where she is, intractably ignorant, too busy making proud googly-eyes at Constance.
“No,” Sherlock plays along, sounding admirably unstirred. “That shade of green clashes with my shirt.”
what it’s like to be on the receiving end of Mycroft’s ‘if you break his heart, I’ll break yours’ talk. But instead it’s ‘if you break his heart, I’ll annihilate you by way of chemical weaponry and cover up your murder.’” A manic giggle slips out. “Christ, I suppose I shouldn’t have expected anything less.”
Everyone looks at Constance, who has decided to lie down, chin on her paws, spent from all the excitement. She snuffles contentedly as Rosie continues to stroke her back.
Sherlock lowers his eyes to the ground and says nothing. He lets John make his deductions, because he is exhausted.
In short order, they’re fighting over the bill (Sherlock wins, as usual) and are on their way back to Baker Street. In the cab, Sherlock holds Rosie in his lap so she can poke her head out of the window like an excitable puppy, hot humid air pillowing her face.
John is marching toward them with a marked pep in his step, a coffee and a grease-stained bag in tow.
“Yeah. Twenty-, thirty-years time? You know. When we retire. And maybe even as a bit of a getaway in the next few years?”
“There has been very little written on the subject of lip pattern use in forensics, though the few existing studies have shown that sex can be determined from patterns with a near 70% accuracy…”
I will never know the apex of Sufi ecstasy, the devoted training, chanting and dervish whirls that culminate in a sensational feeling of
John knows this is it. Everyone Before had been a stepping stone to Sherlock. Sherlock is it--well, Sherlock is certainly not just
In the rocking chair sits Mycroft, dressed to the nines, hands folded primly over a laptop shut closed on his thighs.
Soldiering through, pretending this is not at all out of character for them, John leans over to peer down at the sketch, making an impressed noise and saying, “That’s quite nice.”
For our ceremony, Holmes secured the matching gold bracelet I had bought around my wrist, and we shared gentle, solemn words and kissed, languorous, in our garden, amongst our bee kin--on English soil, beneath the heavens.
“What was that last bit about, then?” John asks pleasantly enough. “And since when do you speak Korean?”
And he will. It’s what married couples do. They are honest with each other, and they work through their differences.
It was in the year following my wife’s death, enduring days on end alone in my flat and warring with pell mell thoughts of Holmes and my wife, that a truth revealed itself--I did not miss my departed wife nearly as much as I missed Holmes, and Holmes was still very much alive, ensconced in 221b, just a 20 minute cab ride from my quarters.
Mummy steps into the kitchen, closing the door to the den behind her, and joins Sherlock at the counter. “Is everything all right?”
He strides over to the coat rack, swipes up his and John’s coats and scarves, and twirls back around to meet John’s fixed gaze. “I know a place.”
“It isn’t in my nature to play it safe. My ego has often got the better of me, has made me do unspeakable things. Stupid things; dangerous things. I was almost certain I would be dead by the age of thirty.” John furrows his brows, pained and bemused, so Sherlock quickly continues, “For many years, all I had for company was my intellect, and I can’t imagine living without it, obviously, but I’d have never been able to live on it, alone. It would have destroyed me. I would not have stepped out of my provincial self-obsession if I hadn’t met you. I wouldn’t have realised that there are so many rich layers to this existence; that the concrete, the logical, can coexist with the abstract, the emotional, and create something larger than life. Since I met you and came to know you, I was determined to live to the greatest limitations of biology, to its farthest stretches, if it meant I could spend more time with you. And, now that you’ve given me Rosie, I wish to transcend biology.”
Staying tucked behind Sherlock--with renewed urgency--John squeezes lube onto his fingers and slickens the rim of Sherlock’s arsehole, which flutters at that first touch, then sinks one, two fingers, pumping them in and out, separating his fingers inside, scissoring, and Sherlock is strung out on the languorous, unrushed nature of John’s movements, lets out indulgent
of a baffling scenario. It’s not the kind of thing that happens in the everyday, to the everyman. John’s reaction had been odd, most definitely, a bit embarrassing, certainly, but then again he
why the credit card statements listed nonexistent vendors; the club’s been covering up her crimes because they cut a deal with her. They’re getting a piece of the pie.”
It could have been a test, of course. John could have been trying it on for size. Sherlock doesn't want to learn that it’d been mere curiosity, a flight of fancy, nothing more. John had only offered a small, tentative peck of lips, after all, and Sherlock had been the one to deepen it, to swallow him whole. Sherlock had been greedy.
Sherlock glances over his shoulder then looks back to his mobile. “Understandably, your fall upset her.”
John lets out a gust of breath once Hafiz is out of sight. “You have questions,” he says flatly, not meeting Sherlock’s eye.
“Almost got it,” John says abruptly, embroiled in a one-man brawl with his pants. “Bloody buggering bollocksing
Greg’s eyes are glassy, and he’s giving them a dopey, zenlike grin, but when he sweeps his eyes over their table, where John is nursing a pint, Mary’s just finished a G&T, and Sherlock’s halfway through a rum sour, the smile disappears.
It’s their third time doing this in the past week, John always initiating, but the common thread is obvious, now--Mémé. John is a taciturn man, eschews expressing sentiment verbally (much like Sherlock), so this gets his message across without needing to spew any trite nonsense.
The Dating Killer case had involved a man who murdered closeted gay and bisexual men, setting up the murders to look like they’d been commited by a woman’s hand. Lip prints had been found at each victim’s flats, deliberately placed to mislead the Yard as to the sex of the killer.
After they’ve cleaned up and are clinging to each other in bed, Sherlock says, “I still have lingerie from a case I worked when I was 28.”
With great ceremony, Sherlock stands up and whips out the purloined wallet, holding it up to the light. Two of the pockets are fat, bursting with credit cards. Sherlock pinches the cards out of their pockets, and he and John squint at the blocky names printed upon them together. Within the collection, they find their client’s and his mate’s names. As well as a smattering of other potential victims’ names.
But then he’d met John, and John had challenged that man Sherlock had known so well, because there Sherlock was, affixed to someone again, and it wasn’t a detriment. It was distracting, at times, but it wasn’t destructive.
They’d (or Molly had, really) decided to do a Secret Santa, so as to be accommodating to everyone’s personal budgets. But as with everything in life, Sherlock hadn’t been able to experience the thrill of a mystery remaining a mystery for very long. Sherlock had known John was his gift-giver the moment the man had walked through the door hours ago.
Sherlock runs the tip of his tongue over his bottom lip, skin-pink against unnatural-pink, and John follows its journey with great vigilance. “You find this particularly attractive,” Sherlock says.
He’s about to drop to his knees when John catches him by the underarm and pins him up against the wall.
“No. Listen to me.” John’s voice is all military steel, and it commands Sherlock’s attention. “I know this one wasn’t bad. I know it’s basically a nick. But things--they’re different now.” John drops his eyes and stares, hard, at his hand on Sherlock’s knee. “When Rosie was born, I realised that I couldn’t just live--or not live--for myself anymore. I had someone to live for. Before her, I didn’t care. I’d throw myself in front of a bus or a bullet if you asked me to. I mean, Christ: I have done. And that was obviously reckless. But I
“What’s all this, then?” John says as he steps into the sitting room, curiosity winning the battle against his obstinance.
he looked tired. John still hasn't stopped thinking about it. Yes, he hasn’t slept very much in the past 6 months, but it’s to be expected. He has a bloody 6-month-old.
“He was clearly watching you," Sherlock speaks over John, and then his head snaps up, eyes widening. “
“But thanks to this one,” John says, swiping his thumb over Rosie’s forehead. “And--to you, my life was turned around.”
When John’s finished taking his overlong sip of beer, his demeanour is markedly different. He looks uncomfortable.
John huffs out a laugh (good?), runs a hand up Sherlock’s arm to rest on his shoulder, fingertips ghosting along Sherlock’s neck. “You don’t need to be so formal about it,” he says as he leans across the gearshift, angling his head.
“This deserves a drink,”  he says cheerily, holding up his glass. “Cheers.” The three of them clink and take their sips; Molly takes the biggest gulp of them all. “You know,” John continues, wagging a finger at Lestrade and Molly. “I always knew you two fancied each other. ‘Bout time, really. All these years.”
There was a far-reaching impact of the RA I had not considered and it was a shame, truly. Some of Holmes’s passions were very hands-on, particularly apiculture and playing his violin.
Grief, that old tireless sadist that he was, revisited me like a well-acquainted foe, antagonising me endlessly, hoping I would succumb to his ugly machinations and become so heavily laden with sadness I could not function (one is reminded of our departed venerable Queen Victoria, mourning for decades, thinking of nothing but the loss of her loved one and shirking duties). I simply would not let the fiend win.
Triumphantly, Sherlock spins back around and holds up a complicated-looking, strappy, bow-dotted bra-and-thong set.
Thankfully, John isn’t looking at him, is sliding the sketch paper out of Sherlock’s hand to examine it more closely.
“Honestly, Holmes,” I said incredulously. “Both of your hands?” Holmes was not clumsy in the slightest, and I found his purported accident difficult to believe. Holmes did not answer me, further exacerbating my suspicions. He was taking me for a fool! “May I take a look?”
John whimpers in relief, and his breath comes out in punchy, misty clouds as Sherlock strokes him with one hand and clumsily pushes down John’s jeans and pants with his other, just enough to spring John’s cock free. Sherlock has to squint down between them in the semi-darkness as he strokes, frustrated that he can barely see it, but it feels wonderfully thick in his hand and he desperately wants it in his mouth--or inside him.
When the ceremony ends, Mummy turns on her heel and stalks away, as if she couldn’t possibly endure a moment more of the ritual, her ululations ringing throughout the cavernous cemetery.
“Sherlock,” John says, low, thick with rebuke, “we need to talk.” He shoves a wad of wool--Sherlock’s greatcoat--into Sherlock’s chest.
The resulting photo puts her uncompromising excitement in stark relief to Sherlock’s scowl, but she doesn’t seem to care. “Thanks so much! It just must be so lovely being colleagues, you and Dr Watson.”
At least, if anything, it can be misconstrued for a kiss to a god; a plea to win the game. A call for divine intervention.
I sputtered. "I am a fool! I’m so very sorry Holmes. That was—I do not even know why—I cannot—" Holmes raised a cool, placating hand. My mouth snapped shut.
At that, John comes quite gorgeously in Sherlock’s hand, keening, face twisting, and Sherlock milks him through it, marveling at the sight of John’s semen cascading over his fist.
But even with this sound logic, Sherlock feels it is imperative to correct the woman, because John would probably go out of his way to do the same. Rosie is decidedly not Sherlock’s. Not by any stretch of the imagination. Sherlock is not suited to be
It’s another oppressively hot day, and 221 is a building of Georgian times, ill-equipped for staple modern fixtures like air cons, so all Sherlock can do for relief is lie partly clothed on the sofa in the near-dark of their sitting room, his stringy hair pushed back off his forehead by a stretchy headband sprouting three tiny roses (pilfered from Rosie’s headwear collection), and bask in the weak breeze of an old fan stacked atop a tower of books on the coffee table.
Mummy leans over to give Mrs Hudson a peck on the lips, John and Lestrade’s wolf-whistles as a backing track.
The wind swells, circling leaves into the air, one of which lands atop Sherlock’s head. Sherlock lifts his hand to pick it out.
Sherlock hooks an arm around John’s leg, holding onto it for dear life as he’s pulled backwards by the tide. “John,” he croaks theatrically. “Don’t let it get me.”
Sherlock watches her go, watches her announce herself and her purpose to the boys, who are surprisingly receptive and take her into the fold without question, and Sherlock is reminded of how much he loves her.
John helps wrench Sherlock to his feet before he’s clambering to tuck his leaking cock into his pants and to pull up his shorts, cursing inventively under his breath before sprinting into the bathroom. Sherlock flees for his bedroom, shouting, “Shirt!” over his shoulder as he flings open the door and dives onto his bed just as Mrs Hudson’s footsteps reach the landing. He hears John dart out into the hallway to grab his discarded shirt before hurrying back into the bathroom, pulling the door closed just in time for Mrs Hudson to step into their sitting room.
Sherlock has an arch smile ghosting his lips as he turns his head. John doesn't budge, and they end up face to face, a hair's breadth apart, for a heart-hammering moment--suspended in time.
“Gone,” John says, taking a seat beside Sherlock. He places a gentle hand on Sherlock’s forearm. “What’s wrong?”
It starts off as shallow kisses, then becomes headier, Sherlock sucking on John’s upper lip and insinuating his tongue into his mouth, causing John to make gorgeous, strangled noises. John pushes the length of his body against him, his torso solid and strong, and Sherlock traces the contours of his body--runs his hands down from John’s shoulders to his biceps, his waist, hips, arse, and back up, wrapping his arms around John’s neck. John’s hand skates over the crescent of Sherlock's waist and rests on a jutting hip bone, but only briefly, his hand finding its way into Sherlock’s pants and pulling out Sherlock’s cock.
Lestrade makes a grand show of looking around. “Am I on another planet? Is Sherlock bloody Holmes giving me relationship advice?”
“When you came home from university in, oh, ‘94, I think it was, I was certain you’d found someone.” Sherlock nearly knocks the mug over in his haste to goggle at his mother. “Silly boy, you really thought I didn't know?”
After sparring with a violent librarian who’d plucked a child from his library’s weekly storytime circle and stored the girl--alive, at least--in his basement, John bullies Sherlock into the bathroom at 221b to doctor the shallow knife gash running a line up the top of Sherlock’s thigh. Sherlock perches atop the toilet lid in his pants and a t-shirt while John sits on his knees to clean and dress the wound.
“My dear John,” Holmes said softly, cupping my cheek in his bracelet-less hand. “We needn’t the pageantry of matrimony for validation of our affections.”
John seems unable to look anyone in the eye, so he tells the floor, “Thank you, Mrs Holmes, Mr Holmes. That’s--thank you very much.”
He had done everything wrong with Victor, had wanted too much too fast, was much too self-focussed and needy. He cannot do everything wrong with John.
“Shit!" John makes a reflexive grab for Sherlock's dressing gown. "Sorry.” He is holding a bunched up towel in his other hand, placed strategically in front of his groin.
Though...he's not so sure about Sherlock, at the moment, who is kissing him with gulping need, like he needs
“You gonna make me scream it or what?” he asks pointedly, and Sherlock makes a huffy to-do of getting up and heading over. “Do me a--”
John grins. “Well, now, hang on--maybe then I’d at least solve the great mystery of his missing head.”
Rosie’s face untwists at John’s reassurance, but she’s riveted to her spot lest she cause even an iota more of damage by walking off the flower bed.
“Forgive me, John,” Sherlock eventually says, voice sounding overloud, “but I cannot come up with one single thing I’ve done that would lead you to think I would not want you.”
On the train ride home, Sherlock sits slumped against the window, frowning aggressively at sprawling fields of nothingness and uninspired suburban dwellings.
Starr turns around and grinds her arse--and wallet--into John’s groin, bending over double, revealing more of the bejeweled g-string.
Sherlock snaps out of it, recalling the unfortunate reality that people other than John exist, and finds a thirtysomething Korean woman (
, but is proved wrong when he notices that the music’s gotten louder with intent. The DJ's astutely realised it’s that fuzzy time of the night where nearly no one isn’t at least squiffy and everyone is utterly besotted with life. Buzzing with good feeling, people want to dance it out.
John is reaching out, his fingertips brushing Sherlock’s forehead and fringe. Fingers push through the thicket of Sherlock’s curls.
“This was a poor choice of location,” Sherlock says, shooting deeply disdainful looks at John's teammates, who cower under Sherlock’s knife-like judgment. “Particularly with the weather we’ve been having. It’s hardly your fault.”
“Yes, and I have an important call to make in fifteen minutes,” Mycroft says, hiking his laptop bag over his shoulder and gliding into the kitchen. “Do try to avoid making a ruckus.”
“Rosie couldn’t keep her eyes off you,” John says, eyes on his fork as he sinks it into the yieldingly spongy base of the cake. Absurdly, Sherlock wishes he were the cake. “Suppose I don’t blame her.”
“‘I wish I could give you more?’” Sherlock parrots, mouth dry, because, even after all his puzzling, he hadn’t been able to parse it.
“Look at the pretty bird,” Sherlock says, overloud, pointing at a green parakeet that had landed on a branch jutting out into the pathway. It does the trick, Rosie gawping and reaching out for the animal. “A parakeet, also known as
Sherlock wonders with creeping unease if what he’s said has gone too far. They are not demonstrative with each other, as a rule, but there’s just something about this damn day that’s made Sherlock disturbingly
None of what had happened with Greg and his ex-wife had been fair to Greg, or to Greg’s children. It’d been exceptionally cruel. Unjust. There had been too much collateral damage. John would rather die than willingly allow someone he loved to get hurt. Especially if he were the cause of that hurt. Rosie needn’t have a troubled home life; she should have the best life John can give her. And that would be the one in which he stays with Mary and they remain a happy family. It’s the life in which he is faithful to Mary, the woman he does, in fact, love. It’s not a herculean effort to stay. They’re happy together. They're making it work. Head down, carry on.
Mycroft has his hand splayed across his heart, offended by the expectation of him to perform a menial task. “Why me? Sherlock’s right there.”
“I have to say," Mary comments, watching Greg effusively clink pints with a spotty constable that John would be hard-pressed to remember by name. “Greg doesn’t look a day over 40.”
“Don’t nauseate me with your fresh affections,” Mycroft spits out, reaching behind the chair to extract a manila envelope. He holds it out at arm’s length and does not bother to stand. “Happy Birthday.”
“It was a new development,” Holmes said. “I’ve only just decided to officially retire, though I have had my eye on a pretty little
Rosie keeps trying to peer over Sherlock’s shoulder, but Sherlock redirects her gaze each time, brings them farther away from the powderkeg scene (though, not before sparing a glance over his shoulder just in time to see the pap’s camera sailing over the garden’s walls and John taking a fistful of the man’s shirt).
“Spoiled brat,” John says fondly, his hands sliding up Sherlock’s back and over the dip of his trapezius, squeezing the taut, knotted muscles there.
It’s a gentle kiss, lasting no more than a few seconds, but it effectively erases all of Sherlock’s doubts and regrets and self-flagellations.
Holmes pulled his hand out of mine and unclamped one of my braces and unbuttoned my shirt with the other hand, employing a level of dexterity that was so typically Holmesian. In no time, he was onto the last button, which he undid with a flourish.
I noticed Holmes’s erection had flagged slightly, so I reached around and coaxed it back to full hardness, employing techniques that I often used onanistically. As his prick grew hotter and heavier in my hand, he was emboldened to lift himself up and descend back to the root. Then again, and once more. It was so very deliberate and slow; my patience was tried until I could not stand it anymore.
turn of events; it’s been a balm during such a dismal time.” With a pinched expression and watery eyes, Mummy presses a finger to her lips, and everyone allows her the moment. “Forgive me,” she says, quickly recovering. “John, we welcome you most warmly to our family.”
Annoyed, he swipes at his cheek with the heel of his palm, and when he drops his arm, John’s hand slides from Sherlock’s shoulder down to his forearm, hesitates, then slides down further to interlace their gloved fingers.
John’s line “‘Enjoyable companion’ makes me sound like a fucking dog” was something Martin Freeman said in an old cast interview. The cast was talking about what qualities of their characters they share, and Amanda said Martin is loyal, like John, and Martin responded with something along the lines of “Why does everything people say about me make me sound like a fucking dog?” It was very Martin, and somehow also John.
“I wish for our formal union; I wish to claim you as my husband. Our decades long entanglement must be afforded the same respect as any other love.”
Sherlock remains anchored in place, eyes tracing over the blocky engraving of his grandmother’s headstone--
“Oh my god. Are you Sherlock Holmes?” Hafiz is saying. “Is that Sherlock Holmes?” he poses to John, presumably.
Constance’s tail slaps against the ground--even as the rest of her remains motionless--when Sherlock folds himself into a pretzel, seated opposite Rosie, and places his hand to coarse fur.
and began accounting an intriguing case he had stumbled upon in a village some miles away from the Downs, a case where he exonerated the son of a vicar wrongly accused of being a horse-slasher.
John dramatically clears his throat. “I see most of us are done; I’ll do the washing up.” He pushes back in his chair with a grating scrape and stands up, begins to collect empty plates.
Every time Sherlock glances across the cab, he finds John still and remote, eyes unseeingly glued to the window, hands folded in his lap.
The man unselfconsciously thrusts his hips toward the woman in a comical display, and the woman laughs, spins around, and sways her hips, flashing him a coy look over her shoulder.
She looks between the two of them and her smile grows unfathomably wider. “But you will still be coming up next weekend for your birthday, won’t you.”
Last year, there hadn’t been a party; they’d opted to have the celebration at Sherlock’s parents’s house on Christmas Day. That Christmas Eve had been very sombre at 221b, as it had been the first Christmas Eve that Sherlock had spent without John since they’d shared the flat (not counting the years he was quite literally dead to the world). It’s embarrassing, how miserable Sherlock had been. Christmas Eve is just another day, no different than any other day of the year, or at least it should’ve felt that way. Yet he’d never felt so alone.
Sherlock slowly lifts his hand, fingertips to John’s fingers curved around the glass. Looks expectantly at John.
“Don’t be ridiculous. You know me, John. I’d hardly waste my time if I didn’t find you an enjoyable companion.” John snorts, shakes his head ruefully. “What?”
Sherlock lets out a surprised little noise at the contact, remains limp with shock, but doesn’t back away. He allows himself to be kissed.
! A rather pretty little case, wasn't it?—not omniscient and there is only so much in my bailiwick I can utilise. Such are ‘my limits!’ I have traveled to premier universities throughout this great nation and most of Europe hoping to stumble across some nascent brilliance heretofore unknown to society. ‘Perhaps,’ I reasoned, ‘A cure is on the cusp of discovery, hidden in the laboratory of a university. A place where minds are eager to learn and discover!’ Alas, there is not. Mankind is always learning, and time is the greatest teacher of all. For now, I must cope."
The smugness that radiates off Mycroft as Sherlock sits beside John on the loveseat makes Sherlock want to punch him square in the face.
“John,” Holmes breathed into my ear, then kissed a spot just behind it. “You are quite something--beautiful, if I may say so.”
Sherlock looks at John and jerks a nod in the direction of the door before slinking off into the heaving mass of dancers without a trace.
Holmes grunted with assent and began to frig himself on me, each downslide more energetic than the next, his buttocks connecting to my pelvis, the propulsions causing the armchair to slide incrementally backwards.
Admirably, Greg makes it to John in one piece. He slaps a hand on John’s shoulder and gets at eye-level, squinting, as if trying to peer into John’s soul. “What’s all this about, then?”
John catches Sherlock’s eye every so often. Other times, when Sherlock risks a glimpse, John has his eyes fixed on the road ahead, but he is smiling, an eye-crinkling affair. He knows Sherlock is looking.
Constance has stopped her leisurely stroll to get a good look at Rosie, tongue lolling and tail wagging.
John looks at him for a moment, expression turning positively lecherous, and he licks his lips, throws the flannel aside. Crooks a finger at Sherlock. "C'mere."
He hadn’t allowed himself to look at John too closely since the Heath; he hadn't wanted to remember the feeling of John’s soft, strawberry jam-hinted lips too vividly; to recall his smell--sweet with fragrant sweat and sun cream.
John slides both hands up the sides of Sherlock’s thighs, fingers combing through dark strands of hair, until the tips of his fingers meet the leg hem of Sherlock’s boxer-briefs. Sherlock watches raptly as John slips his index and middle-fingers beneath the elastic, and when John’s fingers tangle in coarse hair and nudge at Sherlock’s cock, Sherlock’s cock twitches enthusiastically, and his legs clamp tight on John, locking him in.
Holmes reached for the kettle that sat on the uppermost cupboard and picked it up with a soft grunt, bringing my attention upon him fully. My eyes fell to Holmes’s hands, which were covered with black, leather gloves, rather incongruous to his indoor, relaxed attire.
“If I understand the nuances of the situation correctly,” Sherlock continues, ignoring John, “your case is a
My stomach was then in knots, though I took solace in the fact that Holmes seemingly had not followed the scent of my unease to its source.
“I don’t know what you’re thinking,” John says, trying not to let any inkling of anger slip through even as it strafes through him. “I don’t know why--what you think it meant. But last week—last week, when I saw him, wires got crossed and—“
Re: Sherlock’s monologue about men losing “an average of 3 kilos” to impress their paramours when in the midst of an affair: they mentioned this fact in the true crime documentary,
Rosie plops onto her knees and softly places a hand to fur. Constance tumbles inelegantly onto her back, and Rosie gives the dog what she wants, strokes her stomach.
When? How often? With whom, precisely? There is so much Sherlock wants to know. So much he hadn’t seen.
“My dear man, you're reckless,” Holmes teased, reaching over and, with a spindly finger, wiping away a fleck of whiskey from my neck. I watched, transfixed, as he brought the pad of that same finger to his mouth and touched the tip of his tongue to it.
Mrs Hudson tuts. “What a shame. You’d think that profession would only attract the salt of earth types.”
What if he were to be bold, like his grandmother, and profess to John? Would it ruin everything? Or would it become everything?
From his rucksack, John unpacks a sandwich and juice box for Rosie, who has her lunch quietly but vociferously, enraptured by a couple of boys throwing themselves to the ground and rolling down the hill. He takes out a sandwich for himself and offers one to Sherlock, which Sherlock declines.
John sighs and grunts miserably as he pushes himself back up onto his good foot. He stretches out for the soap but misses, smacking it and the toothbrushes off the ledge.
John had showered Sherlock with approbrations of the sort in the early days of their friendship, but they’d become a drizzle, then a drought as the years passed. John had become jaded, or perhaps impervious to Sherlock’s sparkling genius, Sherlock had thought.
Sherlock’s eyes flit around the room, catching on their toothbrushes scattered across the floor, then on the soap, all of which he bends to collect.
“Right. I'm leaving,” Janine proclaims, gathering her things. “Bloody perfect for each other, you two are. You’re both
Sherlock is beyond relieved to have a proper excuse. “Regrettably, John and I have already purchased tickets for the return train.”
“I think I’ll call it a night too,” Mrs Hudson announces and everyone bids her goodnight. She gives John a tight embrace and a smacking kiss on the cheek.
“Actually,” Sherlock says, holding up the opener and giving it a wave. “Mémé was Mummy’s mother. Not a Holmes.”
Bandage applied, John moves to rest his hand on Sherlock’s knee and looks up, his eyes a fascinating shade of blue.
The relief that floods over John’s face is perplexing. Did John really not think Sherlock would say yes to such a request? That he would deny John anything?
John reaches out, traces the lip-lined dip of Sherlock’s cupid’s bow with his finger. “Femininity, for me, is attractive on anyone. And you’re already gorgeous, so this--it may be driving me a little mad.”
“Ah, well--thank you,” John says, a bit fidgety. His eyes flicker from Hafiz’s chest to his eyes, lightning fast. “As do you.” John glances down at the frightened little boy hiding behind his father’s leg, and his lips quirk up. “I see you’ve been busy.”
John kisses back with verve, meeting the sloppy and heady movements of Sherlock’s lips, wrapping his arms around Sherlock's back and pulling him close, their bodies pressed against each other in a flush line.
Inspired, I stepped forward and took Holmes in an embrace, Holmes going stiff, and words came stumbling out of my mouth gushingly. “Holmes, I hope you know I am overjoyed to be living with you again. I have felt so very alone these past dreadful months and could think of nothing but my poor wife—but then I thought of you, always lighting up the room with your intelligence, intrigue, talents. It was like going home to a safe, comfortable place when I thought of you. It seems you are now the one fixed point in my changing world, and it is a privilege to have you there. You have brightened my life!”
John can feel the rise and fall of Sherlock’s damp chest against his own. Can feel the steady drumbeat of Sherlock’s heart, louder than the battering waves. Can smell the salty sea, floral notes of sun cream, and Sherlock’s breath, fragrant with vanilla, lemon, and tea--their breakfast.
John blearily watches a group of overdressed women wearing pink sashes and tiny phallic party hats congregate on the dancefloor, feeling like a fish out of water. This pub’s clientele skews young, and he can’t help but think that he, Greg, Mary, and Sherlock are
With their hands already clasped, John helps hoist Sherlock to his feet, eyes falling to the bandage on Sherlock’s thigh. “All right?”
?” Sherlock repeats, waving a frustrated hand at the two of them. “There must be more. What do you do now?”
Apparently, Sherlock had not clarified to this woman that he isn’t, in fact, Rosie’s parent. She had gone on to assume that he is not only Rosie’s father, but that John is also Rosie’s father. Hence Rosie and Sherlock having an attachment to John that could merit them being considered, Sherlock cringes internally at the word,
Her footsteps are echoing down the hall toward them, so Sherlock flings himself off his bed and slams the door shut, lest Mrs Hudson take one step too far.
here?” John accuses, annoyed that Mary hadn’t come to check up on him, even if he hadn’t wanted her to. It’s the principle of the thing. But Greg looks hurt by John’s snappish attitude (wrongly directed at Greg), so John stumbles over himself to say, ”Fuck. Sorry. Don’t worry about me, mate, go back inside and enjoy yourself.”
John tunes out in favour of watching Sherlock’s lips move. And they are moving. Fast. They’re also pink and pretty. And quite pretty. Also: pink.
At once, I took a hansom to Baker Street and, even though I hadn't seen her in some time, was greeted by Mrs Hudson in her typically brisk manner.
John leans back into the cradle of Sherlock’s hold, looking enticingly soft and well-snogged. Tenderly, he swipes a thumb over Sherlock’s eyebrow, where a snowflake had been threatening to drop into Sherlock’s eye.
John crouches down to her frog-height, his knees popping, semaphoring his age. “Well, hello. You might just be the prettiest frog I’ve ever seen.”
The children’s exhibits are interactive, so Rosie has been running from station to station, breathless with excitement, poking, squeezing, and stomping on things. They can hardly keep up with her. But after a fair bit of flitting around, she finds her home at a long water basin with Rube Goldberg-like tubes and wheels demonstrating physics phenomena. The exhibit is, of course, mobbed with children, but they manage to nab spots, Rosie standing and running her hand experimentally through the rushing water in the basin, Sherlock crouching down beside her, and John standing a bit off to the side, watching them.
It’s a blessedly cool evening, drying the sweat off John’s forehead, and the panic that had been building gradually subsides down to a hum.
and he has to lay it on thick, so he forces her ear close to his mouth, looking ahead and catching Sherlock’s eye, “Gonna give you everything you’ve ever wanted.”
, so he slows his thrusts to a lazy grind, lets them catch their breaths, traces a lax path with his lips from John’s cheek to ear and says, “I want you to fuck me again; want it slower.”
Mummy would be disappointed, yes, but she’d get over it. And Sherlock wouldn’t have to suffer through an entire weekend of innuendo and fussing and over-sentimental declarations.
Come Monday, he and John will return to their usual state of affairs, and at some distant and daunting stretch in the future, John will leave him. Will find someone else in which to share the rest of his days.
Sherlock shoves the deed back into its folder and holds it under Mycroft’s nose. “I don’t want this,” he says, all bravado. “You take it.”
