He isn’t quiet. Not enough to be heard over the fan, but still, Dean worries that someone might hear something they shouldn't. Namely, his soft pants, the ones he can’t hold back. A hand in Castiel’s hair, Dean holds him in place, biting a knuckle to keep himself quiet. “Cas,” he sighs. “Cas…”
Castiel turns his head, his eyes soft. “You know that’s not true.”
Castiel wakes to a cold bed and voices downstairs, and the shower running behind the bathroom door. Outside, the sun shines, and a mild breeze blows the curtains. A soft voice hums, audible through the gap in the bathroom door. He shouldn't. Dean’s privacy is precious, and disturbing him would only fray the bond they’ve grown over the last few days. But Castiel has never been one for sitting idle, and Dean must’ve left the door open in invitation.
“Running, like an idiot,” Dean groans. He rubs his face, then pats the small of Castiel’s back. “You want the human perspective? Whatever you do’s gonna be better than what’s going on right now,” and Dean goes on, taking Jack by the shoulder and pushing him into the kitchen.
“God, I wish she fuckin’ would,” Donnie cackles. “We’re gonna be old and gray before she ever gets naked in front of anyone.”
“I believe you,” Dean sighs. Still, he keeps his eyes distant, and Castiel only holds him tighter in reply, pressing their foreheads together. The cold bites his bare hands, pinpricks that ground him into the moment, into the warmth of Dean’s skin. “You really wanna start over like this?” Dean asks, his grin sneaking back in. “Middle age ain’t what it’s cracked up to be.”
Castiel smiles into a kiss, this time in full. “I’ve been with men who barely lasted ten. Sex isn’t about how long you can sustain an erection, it’s about the connection.”
, Dean thinks. Castiel may be the first man to kiss him, but Dean genuinely likes him. Likes spending time with him, likes waking up in the same room as him, likes talking to him about mundane things. Sex with him is probably great, but just being in the same room with him is… freeing. Exhilarating, even, because Castiel understands.
“I’m here to take you away from here,” the angel tells him. Silver knees clang against the stone floor as he kneels. Gathering Dean into his arms, Dean allows it, his feverish skin cooled by the chill of the angel’s armor. “My name is Castiel,” Castiel says into Dean’s ear. “Do you trust me?”
And it’s
, Dean thinks, turning his face to the sun.
Castiel hums low in his throat, pulling his hand away. “Maybe you are.”
Ironically, teaching writing to freshmen is probably the easiest his last year will get.
“It doesn’t make any sense, then.” Bandage in place, Dean rubs Castiel’s ankle as he thinks. “Chuck wouldn't torture you for the hell of it. I mean, maybe years ago, but not now.” He rubs his nose. “You sure no one’s hexed your truck?”
Years ago, Dean might have played along, if she were human. If she were human, they wouldn't be having this conversation, and Dean wouldn't be standing in the middle of a crossroads, but here he is. “We know something’s up,” Dean says, gathering up the last remaining bits of his courage. “People don’t go to Hell for no reason, lady—”
“A deer.” She almost laughs—almost. “Dean hit a deer?”
Dean clings to him in the night, buried under the covers and nestled into the circle of Castiel’s arms. In the dark of their cocoon, Castiel can’t help but look at him, at the cuts slicing his cheeks and the puncture wounds to his throat. Faintly, Dean shivers, blinking awake every few minutes. Just lying there, he can feel just how exhausted Dean must be, but how unwilling he is to let himself fall under, even here, where nothing can harm him.
Dean pops another ice cube into his mouth, tucking it into his cheek. “When we get back to the house, I’ll do laundry and find you something that’s not so… tight.” He waves to Castiel’s suit and the buttons threatening to pop off and ping their way across the restaurant. Since when did he bulk up? “Place is big enough, it’s gotta have a washer somewhere.”
“Sammy,” Dean calls out as soon as the last witch hits the floor, brought down by Sam’s gun. “Sammy, get the kids—”
“Yeah, like.” Crawling off the bed—or falling, rather—Dean fishes through his duffel to find his father’s journal, previously tucked in the spare tire compartment in the trunk. The only safe hiding spot when he isn’t close to a motel, and it survived sitting in the elements for a year. “My dad wrote down everything about monsters in here, about hunts he went on, stuff about me and Sam. I’ve been trying to finish it out, but… There’s a page in here for angels, but he never wrote anything.”
Soundless, Dean lets out a breath, staggered and verging on a sob. He curls into himself, ducking under the covers, and Castiel holds him, squeezing his hand tight while he cries. And through it all, Dean hangs on, and only calms once sleep takes hold, allowing him to fall lax in Castiel’s arms.
Dean can’t help but snort.
So pathetic. And Castiel pulls them out of him, murmuring words into his hair as he taunts Dean with promises and praises. At one point, he reaches over to grab the book, flipping to whatever page he’s been reading for the past few days. “Do you trust me?” Castiel asks, like Dean would ever not.
They leave around eight, after Dean cooks breakfast for himself and Bobby. Though Dean  offers him, Castiel doesn’t eat, and instead spends most of his time on the front porch, the sun on his face and the breeze billowing the curtains on the other side of the wall. Despite the chaos roiling Dean’s existence and life as he knows it, Castiel looks the most at peace of any being he’s ever come across, human or creature. His calm bleeds into everything he touches, and Dean wants to revel in it. In him.
Humming, Dean sinks, his knees breaching the surface. Water laps at his chin, covering his ears as he wets his hair. Sunlight pours in through the window, glass closed to keep out the worst of the mid-morning heat. Said light illuminates the bright blue tiles on the floor and halfway up the walls, and the clawfoot tub Dean inhabits, and where he drapes one leg over the edge, dripping water onto the floor. Castiel takes him by the foot, rubbing circles over where Dean once shattered his ankle, during the time where Castiel couldn't remember his own name.
It feels ritualistic, like something they’ve done for years. No words spoken, no looks exchanged, just two people in each other’s company, breathing the same air.
“Then what are you?” Bobby grunts. He pulls a knife from his back pocket and seizes Dean’s arm, knuckles white while he slices a stripe across Dean’s wrist. Nothing happens, except for Dean yanking away once he finishes, covering the wound with his hand. “If you’re not a demon, or a shifter—”
“I can think of one better.” Crowley sits up straighter, his grin manic. Castiel’s stomach drops. “I think you’re better suited for crime scene cleanup. Or, at least your parents are.” All eyes travel to him. Castiel has never wanted to punch someone in the teeth more. “Oh, you haven’t heard? This is James Castiel Milton, son of the infamous Los Angeles Miltons.”
For a few more minutes, Castiel lies there, watching the meteorologists drone on about storms moving in from the west. The voices filter in slowly, Sam’s voice distinct as he banters back and forth with another woman, louder and accented. A shiver runs up Castiel’s spine. Dean keeps him pinned, drawing Castiel closer. “Don’t go,” Dean mutters, his voice slurred. “Don’t want you to go…”
Dean sighs and glances up. He smiles despite his exhaustion, his lips barely curling. “Sore spot?”
Happy. Ecstatic, even, with Dean at his side, alive, breathing, whole. Briefly, Castiel looks around the motor court, at the lone car in the parking lot besides the Impala and the lack of movement on the two-lane a few dozen feet away. The one weekend in winter when tourists don't flock to the first motel they can find, leaving them alone, wrapped in each other’s company.
He used to come here for a few months as a child, before John demanded they switch to the congregation in town, where he knew the preacher and all of Mary’s family attended. Mary loved it here, and in a weird way, Dean did too, back before he understood what was being preached and how he fit into every damnable category. But he had friends here, and everyone knew his name and commented on his freckles and how much taller he had grown. He liked the attention, liked being treated as an equal, a luxury he can no longer afford.
This is his home, now. Despite Ash’s obsession with honkytonk and Garth’s weird penchant for Civil War reenactments, they make good roommates and friends. Benny cooks every Sunday after the church services Dean refuses to attend, and Max takes him out to the batting cages in the next town over every Thursday like clockwork. They’re all he has anymore, and he makes it work.
Part of him expects Castiel to brand him all over again. What he does, though, is kiss Dean’s ring finger—and from the spot, a silver band appears, a quarter of an inch thick and glowing, gradually darkening to a bright, ethereal silver.
“Get to your right, Ash is out of gas,” Cas says, louder now, just as Adam passes to his left and cuts him off.
The girls are alive, in the end. Six of them, apparently, because witches work fast in Flagstaff, and they die just as quickly. Only, one of them manages to get a knife into Dean’s gut on the way down, and Dean lies on the floor of a two-bedroom bungalow, a hand over the wound to his gut and blood seeping between his fingers.
“Sam wants to smoke it out, but I talked him out of it,” Castiel chuckles. Silence grows between them, only broken by their breaths. “Like you said, the house is in your name.”
“You’re afraid,” Castiel whispers after he’s done, tracing the bruise. A red heat flushes Dean’s cheeks, his lips plush from kisses and the occasional bite. “You think after everything, I wouldn't want this body.”
“You were dead,” Dean hisses. Sitting up, he winces, clamping a hand over his stomach. “I saw you up there. You didn’t have a pulse, and they were… Shit, man, they were hollow. I didn’t even have to push—”
Soft, Castiel touches his thumb to the skin beneath Dean’s eye, gathering up the residual tears that stubbornly still fall. “What’s wrong?”
. Castiel’s heart swells, the urge to kiss Dean unbearable. By a miracle, he holds back, opting to touch Dean’s cheek instead. Dean’s eyelids flutter closed, a low whine escaping his throat. “Thank you,” Castiel whispers. “I’ll be here in the morning.”
Sam scratches behind his ear, his eyes to the floor. His skin pales. “He got taken by a soul eater,” he says, and—
“Listen to me.” Taking Dean’s hand, Castiel threads their fingers together. Dean trembles in his grasp, his breaths ragged. “You survived what would have killed scores of men. Hell is not designed for you to survive. Most souls don't make it past the first day, let alone a week. You lived through one hundred years of torment. I may not know you beyond that, but I know this.” He presses his palm over Dean’s pec, feeling his heart beat a frantic rhythm through his skin. “I know that you’re destined for great things. That you’re special, and that you’ll live a full life. A happy life, now that you can.”
And Dean can’t help but obey.
“Did he kick you out?” Castiel asks, suddenly stern.
Come drips between Castiel’s fingers; Dean has half the mind to lick it off of him, but mortification keeps him from doing much other than clinging to him with tears in his eyes. Not from sadness, but embarrassment, from elation. “You’re so obedient,” Castiel soothes, easing Dean into another kiss. “But you’re not finished.”
He sits on the bench closest to the front door and waits, hands folded in his lap. Lavender candles burn on the front desk, the scent muting the sterile smell of disinfectants. A faint buzzing echoes from down the hall, and voices carry, filled with laughter. The noise stops after another ten minutes. Another two pass before Castiel watches a man emerge from one of the many rooms, his forearm wrapped in cellophane. He pays Castiel no attention and leaves, the door tinkling with his departure.
“What the fuck am I supposed to do? I thought he had it under wraps. Like I said, it ain’t my business, but his daddy wants it to be everybody’s. Swear to god, the man’s got it in for half of this town, and he takes it out on Dean.”
“Not this kind.” Kneeing closer, Dean settles over Castiel’s lap, a smirk on his lips. “How’s it look?”
“Yeah.”
“I don’t want him to cut off my leg,” Dean mumbles.
They shouldn't come for him—but someone does. Every single instinct tells him to hide, to scream and cower, but whoever breaks the lock to his cell isn’t interested in throwing jabs or intentionally sharpening their blades next to his head. Dean whines and tries to tuck his legs closer, in a vain effort to protect himself. No matter what he does, they always have their way. Resistance is futile, and all Dean can do is obey.
“Hey,” Dean says and holds open his arms. Castiel embraces him without question, shivering as Dean strokes down his spine over his cardigan. Such a handsome man, so broken and yet so loving, and Castiel never intends to let him go. “Did you bail on everyone?”
Approaching the crossroads, Dean shakes the box again, trying to remember everything he put inside: a photograph from one of Bobby’s forgotten family albums in the basement, dirt from the cemetery up the road, a bone from Bobby’s childhood cat, and a stem of yarrow from the suspiciously positioned plant growing between two totaled DeSotos. Everything he needs, and nothing he wants to do.
Castiel could look at him all day, could drown in his beauty, and that's what scares him the most.
For most of the trip back to Sioux Falls, Dean leaves the windows down and the radio on almost as loud as it can go. Compared to last night, the weather is pleasant, all blue skies and chilly winds. The sun beats down, warming the interior and the leather seats. Considering the situation, it’s… comfortable, with Castiel at his side. The same Castiel who alternates between staring out the window and reading one of the paperbacks Dean keeps stashed in the trunk. Never making a sound, yet still vigilant at all hours.
“’s too bad,” Dean mumbles. He draws an arm around Castiel’s shoulders, eventually pulling him onto the other side of the mattress, away from his laptop. “You’re a great kisser.”
“I know.” Featherlight, he presses a kiss to Dean’s lips. Dean’s lips part, anticipating a second, but Castiel pulls away, hiding his face in Dean’s neck. “Your actions speak louder than your mouth ever could. But I still doubt, and I’m afraid that I may be misinterpreting.”
“Did you pay for it?” Dean asks.
Castiel’s weight returns to the bed, this time closer to Dean’s hip. So close, that Dean barely has to lift his hand to touch him, skirting his fingers up the back of Castiel’s shirt. “We don’t sing,” Castiel says through a sigh. “And we don’t play harps, contrary to popular opinion.”
Slow, Dean nods. “You could’ve at least sent a card.”
Right—of course Castiel can tell. “I do that,” Dean says with a halfhearted smile. “Been a hell of a day.”
“Oh?” Castiel lifts a brow.
“There’s nothing you can do?” Dean asks, brittle. He looks up, but not much higher than Castiel’s chest. Rowena must pity him, or else she wouldn't be here. There’s nothing for her to gain out of this, other than watching an angel die.
Blinking, Castiel reaches up to touch his cheek. “You do have faith, though.”
“Why’re you so pissed with him?” Bobby asks after a while, after Dean has successfully managed to sit up and take one of the painkillers Bobby offers him. “Know you two’ve had your tiffs in the past, but he said you threatened him.”
“Castiel,” Naomi says by way of greeting. “We need to talk.”
“This was a stupid idea,” Dean admits—finally—and Castiel can’t disagree.
All of the air leaves Dean’s lungs in that one second, the full extent of his anguish washing over him, accompanied by such a dramatic relief that he can’t help but sob, held together solely by Castiel’s hands. And worst of all, Castiel joins him, peppering salt-laden kisses into his hair while he weeps, soundless, such a stark contrast to Dean. Always so different, yet everything Dean has ever wanted. Someone to listen to him, to support him—to love him, unconditionally and real, to the very depth of what makes Castiel an angel. Something so human embodied in something so holy, all because of Dean.
The fact that Castiel fits so perfectly into his life doesn’t escape him. Even after he waves a quiet goodbye to Bobby and backs down the driveway, he can’t help but notice how easily Castiel takes up space in the passenger seat. Like he’s always been there, just waiting for the right moment to appear.
“Shh,” Castiel soothes with a kiss, a promise on his tongue. “I think I have an idea.”
Dean’s room, Castiel finds, is much like his was at the Bunker. The same wooden bedframe and desk, the same nightstands and lamps, but all of his weapons are stored away, replaced with small framed photographs of old family photos and some of his own, of the beach, others of motels and restaurants, a few of the road itself.
Bobby shushes him, shaking him a bit. It may have worked when he was a kid, but he’s twenty-eight now, and absolutely lost for what to do next. Racing is his entire life, the only thing he knows how to do, ever since his father bought him his first go-kart and plowed a track into the field in their backyard. Every second of every day, John prepared him, kept him focused, gave him every opportunity he could so Dean could rise through the ranks. ARCA, trucks, minor league, the Cup Series—all of it, solely because of John’s connections and Dean’s skill.
As much as Dean trusts his friends, this is something he’s never told them, and never plans to, even if the situation arises. His father kicked him out the first chance he got. Not even his brother knows, and at one point, they were attached at the hip. Castiel is the first man he’s told, and the first person not to assault him for it. And now, Castiel wants to touch him, and all Dean can do is shiver.
That, and Castiel’s slow, languid kisses, each growing fainter and fainter as Dean begins to drift. “I’d like to,” he says. “Would you?”
A man stares at him from within the wall. Translucent, almost, barely a shape, but Castiel can recognize his eyes and his jaw, his face much too old, his clothes too far dated to be anyone living. With a blink, he disappears—and Castiel bursts from the bathroom in nothing but his boxers, in time to find Dean sitting on the bed with a shoebox full of maps. Dean looks up, squinting, his cheeks growing redder.
Castiel’s sigh deflates his chest, and only after the fact does he bother to breathe again. “I’m not human, Dean,” Castiel starts. Not exactly the best way to begin a conversation, but at least he’s talking. “When I was brought back years ago, I inherited my own vessel, and that included my own genitalia.”
Too good—
Speaking of. “Hey, come with me,” he says, and urges Castiel off the bed.
. Dean holds back a laugh. “It’s fine, just—Should we be doing this? We don’t even know each other—”
A breath. “Yours too,” he says, and drifts.
With the last twenty in his pocket, he buys lunch and eats until the hunger fades and the need to pop the top button of his jeans takes over. “Can’t believe they dragged you all the way to Georgia,” Dean says after a while, chewing on the end of a straw. “You know how far that is from home?”
At some point, Castiel ends up on his back, with Dean straddling his waist and mouthing at his neck. The knife comes back into play, slicing open a two-inch incision in his neck. Here, his Grace flows like air, and Dean inhales it before closing his lips around the wound. The intimacy of being marked doesn’t escape him; Dean’s lips send a thrill down his spine, his tongue waking a part of him he only recently has begun to indulge. Before, Dean was aroused when Castiel bit him—and Castiel can’t help but feel the same, especially laid so bare, all of his skin available to touch.
“I’m serious, it’s… Look.” Standing, Sam walks over and leans against the banister. “My point is. If you were in trouble, he’d do the same thing.”
“Dude.” Dean lifts his head, looking Castiel in the eye. “You’re my best friend, but that’s not why I asked. I wanted to…” He worries his lip. “I wanted you to meet my mom. I wanted you to see where I grew up, and I… I wanted to ask you out.”
If Dean could shake his head, he would. As it is, he punches the steering wheel and jams his foot to the floor, and Adam disappears into the rearview for just the briefest of seconds. Long enough for Dean to pull back to keep from slamming into the 00 of Victor. The last thing he needs right now is to crash, right when he’s so close to making it to the top of the points rankings. “Better second than dead,” Dean tells himself for the fifth time.
With the quilt spread across the bed, Castiel cuts the string and nearly hurls the scissors and needle across the room in exasperation. It’s finished—after weeks of work and too many days collecting fabric back in Kansas, it’s finally finished, and surprisingly free of blood considering the state of his fingers. Part of him begs for rest, to burrow under the quilt and to never come out. The other, more rational part of his brain tells him to get up, and to take the blanket with him.
“Always,” Castiel says with a shy smile. “I still wonder about the implications. Stigmata are signs of faith, given to those that are worthy, but… we’ve both experienced the pain that they bring. You were a man lacking faith, and I’m a being possessed by light. What’s the common denominator?”
But Dean keeps walking around the left side of the home. Castiel follows him, regretfully barefooted, and finds Dean in front of a set of double doors raised up off of the ground. He undoes the exterior latch and swings one open, stepping down. A light comes on from within, and Castiel gravitates toward it, descending the set of stairs into a small cellar. The second he steps onto the floor, Dean reaches through the opening and pulls the door shut, locking the interior latch.
, Castiel thinks. But his mistakes have cost people their lives. He broke Dean’s heart on more than one occasion, and still, Dean refuses to leave his side. Because Dean—
“Your intent isn’t malicious,” Castiel manages, barely. As he speaks, Dean leans in to mouth across his skin, painting his lips with it. Low and deep, Castiel moans, the noise music to Dean’s ears. “You intend to heal. Sam intends to murder.”
But Castiel shakes his head. He pulls his shirt off with a visible wince and sits, his back facing Dean. His
Low, Castiel hums. A single digit slips inside up to the first knuckle, not entirely unfamiliar, but not exactly a sensation Dean can call himself used to. Lying back, Dean closes his eyes and breathes, shutting out everything other than the soft press of Castiel’s finger, one at first, then another as they spread him wide.
“I’ll do that.” With a sigh, Castiel stands, gathering his bag and slinging it over his shoulder. Dean mirrors him, grabbing Castiel’s mug on his way up. Their fingers brush; Dean longs for his touch even seconds after it’s gone. “For what it’s worth, I’m… I wish you didn’t have to experience what you did. I wish things were easier for you.”
But for now, he has this. Tears in his eyes and love in his heart, he has what he’s always wanted, and even more.
Mary looks over at him, her eyes imploring. “Is he nice?”
Looking up, he finds the nurse staring down at him, her eyes soft in consolation. “That’s not my story to tell,” she says, brushing his hair out of his face. “I’ll let you rest, and Mr. Milton fill you in. We won’t let the press know you’re awake for another hour, and we won’t let them into the room until tomorrow. Does that sound good?”
The first kiss, Castiel tastes the soap on Dean’s lips and spearmint on his tongue. Dean clings to him, pulling his feet from the bath and falling into Castiel’s orbit. Instinctively, Castiel’s wings wrap around him, urging him closer, as close as he can get. Dean burns, fever-bright, and Castiel can’t help but touch him, anywhere and everywhere, namely the curve of his ass where it meets his thighs. With both hands, Castiel lifts Dean up while Dean flails for balance, his arms clamped around Castiel’s neck and his thighs clamping around his ribs. Painful, but not enough to force him to let go.
“Yes.” Sitting up, Castiel cups the back of Dean’s head and pulls him in, tongue warm and wet against his own.
. Dean’s jaw tenses the longer he stands there, like he’s thinking, like his life is flashing before his eyes. In the interim, Castiel approaches him, and Dean doesn’t back away.
“Guess they couldn't find a Chuck E. Cheese,” Dean huffs.
“You know I’m not,” Castiel sighs. Brief, he glances down at his pants before he turns his face away. “This is… something I can’t explain.”
“Yeah—No, I mean, no.” Dean throws the Impala into park, afterward yanking the key from the ignition. “Just—Did I ever tell you about my brother, before I died?”
“Mr. Milton?” a voice calls. Castiel looks over to find a woman in blue scrubs walking toward him, her face neutral. His stomach drops as he stands, helping Mary to her feet. Her name tag reads Stephanie, and she greets them with a smile.
“You have a towel,” Castiel hums into another kiss. “You could walk without it.”
Castiel shushes him, tipping Dean’s chin up with a finger. “You’re strong, Dean. Even if it’s not this year, you’re still young. You have the skill and the team behind you. You won’t fail.”
Something unfurls from the depths of the universe. Out of the corner of his eye, Dean watches the walls of his cell disappear, only to be replaced with an emptiness that he can barely fathom. Surrounding him at the cardinal points jut the edges of two rings—or dozens, he can’t tell. He can’t focus, not with the way they rotate, the joints blending into one another. Eyes blink and watch him at all angles, and a steady fire glows over Dean’s stomach, blue and warm to the touch. The gears don’t grind, and the flames don’t crackle; all Dean hears is the steady beating of wings and the roaring wind.
It’s hot—too hot, and all too much at once. Watching Castiel might as well be a sin, his body moving effortlessly as he shoves inside, again and again and
Objectively, the cut doesn’t look that bad, but it bleeds, and Dean feels lightheaded just looking at it. A four-inch slice to his stomach, deep enough to need stitches but nowhere close to gutting him. “Fucker got me good,” he mumbles. From under the sink, he grabs a washrag and wets it, just enough to wash off the blood. After, he rinses it clean and goes about dabbing at his face, his skin gradually coming clean.
Dean touches his fingers to Castiel’s chin, thumb pressing against his lip. Castiel kisses it, falling into his touch. “Should probably come up with a battle strategy.” He stops. “What about Bobby?”
If only Castiel didn't know the answer. “Very carefully.”
ideas.
Something must be wrong, then. Not with her or Jack, but with someone else entirely.
Until Dean happened upon it, and Castiel stole it right out of his hands.
him and his cardigan in the middle of summer, and the jeans that hug his thighs just right. “You’re not supposed to be here—”
In reply, Dean nods. “You’re not real.”
. “She’s—I’m still trying to get over Jess,” he starts, palming his eyes. “I loved her, Dean, but one of my—I swear, she’s not even my professor, but she teaches European history. She’s a witch.”
With a nod, Castiel follows him down the stairs and past the front door, into the living room, then the hall. The siren grows louder through the walls, only diminishing after Dean ushers Castiel into the basement and shuts the door behind them. Downstairs, Sam waits with a hurricane lantern, the only source of light in the entire space. Outside of the two small windows, Dean watches lightning flash and the weeds blow nearly horizontal. In Castiel’s arms, Sonia squirms and yowls, trying to find a place to hide.
And then Castiel pulls away, slipping his fingers under Dean’s sleeve and pressing his bloodied hand to Dean’s right shoulder. Dean mirrors him, heart racing the moment he touches Castiel’s bare skin. An electric spark, a completed circuit. Castiel takes his other hand between them, locking their fingers together into a tight fist. “Close your eyes,” he says, squeezing Dean’s hand. “Give yourself to me.”
He stops, nipping his thumbnail. “This ain’t how it was supposed to go, man. You can’t just—You always leave, and I have to pick up the pieces.”
Unbelievable—and he missed it, because of the same man Sam beat just weeks later. “Adam tried to fight me after,” Sam laughs. Dean wipes his eyes, chuckling right along with it. “He chased me to our trailer and said I’d ruined his life. Cas came out and threw a shoe at him, and you can bet how that went over.”
Dean looks down, worrying his lip between his teeth. “I’d be pissed either way,” he says. “If this is some kinda bullshit way to test my faith, then it’s a shitty way of doing it.”
“I’m…” Inhale, exhale. Dean grips Castiel’s hand, tight enough to bruise. “I’m tired, man. Ain’t the first time I’ve thought about it, but it was… I saw a light. I was so close, but something kept me… I was ready. I’m tired of being such a… burden on everyone. On my mom, my dad, on… on you. Don’t wanna burden you.”
“Yeah.” Swallowing, Dean turns to press a kiss into Castiel’s hair. “We gotta… How far away is Sam?”
And all at once, Dean snaps his eyes open. Not to grimy cell walls, but to a one-room gas station, with no attendants and a CLOSED sign slapped over the door. Outside of the windows, Dean watches clouds waft across a clear blue sky. The refrigeration unit at his back rumbles, and a sudden thirst tickles the back of his throat. Sitting up, Dean feels his stomach, only to find the shirt he died in, ripped to shreds and stained in blood he doesn’t want to think about.
“Forget it?” Dean parrots. On weak knees, he stands, wobbling. “Forget what? ‘Cause it sounds like you’re leaving out half the damn story.”
The night of the bonfire, Dean barely remembers, but he knows at some point, he backed Castiel into the front fender of a Lincoln and kissed him. Or maybe Castiel was already there, ready and waiting, and he took advantage. Whatever the reason, Dean happily replaces the memory with this one, of Castiel’s plush lips against his own and a warm hand spread over his shoulder. Dean tilts his head, searching for a better angle, and Castiel gives in, his lips parting ever so sweetly.
Castiel pulls the sheets up and slips under, sprawled out on his back. Why he’s here, Dean can’t find it in himself to ask. Instead, he goes with what he knows best—making amends. “I shouldn't’ve yelled at you,” he says, pulling the sheets up over his chest. Protection—from nothing, but also everything. “I’d just woken up, Cas, and you—”
A grin, this time wider, yet pained at the edges. “When you look at me, you see a man. When I look at myself, I see a ghost of what I was. You should’ve seen them when we first met.” He leans in closer, a signal for Dean to hold him. And Dean does without question, drawing his arms around Castiel’s shoulders. Warm arms surround him, nails raking down the length of Dean’s spine. “They were beautiful. I could level buildings with a thought.”
“Teaching,” Dean says, neutral. Frightened. “I’m getting my certificate when I graduate.”
Deepthroating has always been a forte of his, the feel of another man’s cock down his throat doing more for his libido than anything he could ever dream of. The girth, the heat of it, the way it twitches when Dean swallows around the head, all of it goes straight to Dean’s groin and leaves him rutting into the sheets just to find friction. Castiel has to be seven, maybe eight inches long, if he’s being generous, and he slides down easily, slipping past Dean’s gag reflex and down far enough that if he touched the front of his throat, he could probably feel it through his skin.
“What?” Dean slams the oven door closed; Castiel jerks, heart jumping. “You thought you’d come out here and what, try to seduce some—”
He leaves the sanctuary of his car and locks the door behind him, stepping into the late-August heat. The inside of the store isn’t any better, with its air conditioner futilely plugging away. To his right, racks upon racks of women’s clothes sit on hangers, and throughout the rest of the store, aisles filled with non-perishables and homewares line the floor, with large blue designation signs hanging overhead. Castiel squints at the bright-white letters spelling
Dean drives somewhere close to the speed limit, if there is one, a hand on the steering wheel and the other hanging out the window. He looks good like this, healthy, like a weight no longer bears down on his shoulders, like he can breathe again. Castiel watches him on occasion, purely content to exist in this moment, with Dean behind the wheel and the wind in their hair. Nowhere to go, no place to be, just together, two beings content in each other’s presence.
, Dean thinks.
The world stops—and so does Dean, the lines of his face hardening. “No, no,” Castiel shushes and draws him closer, before the walls can close. Dean falls into his arms, shivering until the shock wears off. “Tell me again.”
Sniffling, Sam wipes his eyes. “I know. But I—For a while, I looked for ways to bring you back. Even after I got reinstated, I still spent my free time looking up stuff in the archives, but there was nothing. And I mean nothing. Y’know, normally we can find obscure myths in Bobby’s library, but there was…”
The noise is constant, but all Castiel can hear is Dean leading him over to the bar, where he orders two shots of whiskey from the bartender.
“He did,” Castiel manages despite Sam’s grip on his lungs. As soon as Sam lets him go, Castiel sucks in a breath through his nose. “How are you, Sam?”
“Colby, Kansas,” Dean starts. “Teenagers in town have been ‘mysteriously vanishing’ over the last couple weeks. Two were found dead at the airport, but locals swear they’ve been seeing the others in the fields, like some Children of the Corn shit.”
He can’t die here. Sam doesn’t know where he is, and Castiel—
Dean shakes his head. Eventually, he stops, facing the marsh. “You ever get a feeling?” he asks, refusing to turn around. “I just… I feel like he’s here, man. I won’t forgive myself if we drive off and he’s still out there.”
“I said we would make a pact.” Leaning over, Castiel touches the middle of the handprint. Dean jerks away, the pain radiating through his arm. “We’re bound down to our atoms. If you’re ever in danger, I’ll be able to protect you, and vice versa.”
. “C’mon. I’ll tell you over lunch.”
“It’s an abomination, Sam,” Castiel counters. At least he has someone on his side here. “Floral patterns have their place, but there are too many mums and I can’t look at them without my eyes crossing.”
Later in the night, after Dean and Sam have finished unpacking and headed off to bed, Castiel pulls the box from its hiding spot and pops open the lid to reveal several swatches of fabric and spools of thread, and the half-completed face of what he hopes will one day be a quilt. Pulling it free, he drapes it over his mattress, the mass of it only covering half of his bed but decorated in muted tans and browns and hand stitched in places, from embroidery sets he picked up in craft stores along the way. In Lebanon, several residents gave him their old patterns when they noticed him in the crafting section of the local grocery, and others handed over bolts of fabric they never planned to use.
Kneeling, Sam pulls him into his arms, square hands pulling him close. “It’s okay,” he says. “It’s okay, Dean.”
And Dean will take it, even if it means pain.
, Dean hears between the lines. Quickly, Dean looks out to see where Sam has wandered—a ways out, apparently, just his head visible in the water—and sneaks in a kiss, his heart in his throat and his hands sweating profusely. Castiel grabs ahold of his thigh, sinking his fingertips in, and a moan startles from Dean’s lungs, leading to an awkward mash of tongues and teeth.
Dean doesn’t answer him with words—he shouts, loud enough to alert anyone if they were home. But Castiel takes advantage of their solitude and pins Dean into the sheets, his pace brutal, sending Dean further and further up the mattress with every thrust. Dean braces his hand against the headboard, using the other to touch himself while a string of curses fall from his lips. Wood thumps against the wall and the bed frame creaks, in sync with Castiel’s own pants, the words spilling from his lungs, some of which he hasn’t heard in centuries.
By the hair, Castiel pulls Dean in for a kiss, one Dean returns with fervor. He shifts his hips, pulling off of Castiel’s length before lying flat on the mattress, legs parted in an invitation Castiel can’t refuse. Sitting up, he settles between Dean’s thighs and hoists him into his lap before pushing inside, into the blissful warmth Castiel knows all too well. Dean braces his palm against the headboard as Castiel moves, cradling Dean’s hips in his hands. Slowly, at first, easing Dean into it while Dean strokes himself to the same rhythm.
“Do you remember Sunday school? When you used to come in before service.”
Robe cinched tight, Dean leaves the sanctuary of his room and heads across the hall, his steps light and methodical. At this hour, everyone is asleep in the Bunker, and one wrong noise could send someone awake.
Shy, Castiel nods and follows him inside.
After a while, Dean slumps back onto the quilt, exhaustion lingering in his eyes. Castiel scoots closer, their shoulders brushing and hands joined. Idly, he rubs his thumb over the side of Dean’s hand, feeling him loosen as the tension drains from his bones. His eyelids flutter shut, and Dean breathes, slow and measured, all at once content.
For a moment, Castiel just stares at him—then sits up, taking the blade from his hand. Grace spills down his chest, wasted. “I’ve seen your soul, Dean,” he says, nearing a hiss. “I’ve seen every part of you, all of the regret, the anger, the doubt. I’ve seen you at your core, and there is no wrong in you.”
Dean sits in the middle of his bed when Castiel steps inside, dressed in patterned pajamas and tugging at the elastic of his socks. He lifts his head, his smile shy, and a warmth blooms in Castiel’s chest, shivering its way through to the tips of his wings. Looking at him—just admiring him—has always brought him the utmost joy, just from being in his presence. He wants to crawl into bed with Dean, wants to feel his warmth pressed up against him again, solid and firm and yielding.
“Dean,” Sam accuses despite Dean’s amusement. After a moment, he smiles, ducking his head. “You deserve to live too, Dean. I just—I couldn't save you before, and now there’s a chance you’ll die again? Because what, you escaped?”
The clock on the wall reads eight-twenty. Too late to sleep in, but too early to crawl back into bed. Dean does it anyway, pulling the sheets up and letting them fall. Beneath, he finds Castiel seemingly asleep, eyes shut and Sonia tucked up against him, purring so loud that Dean mistakes it for snoring. He’s beautiful like this, with his eyes soft and lips slack, his jaw touchable. Dean runs his knuckles across it, just because he can, Castiel’s stubble strangely soft.
Rowena’s eyes flash purple as a bright jolt of something dark pulses into Castiel’s palms, pouring through his bloodstream before his Grace rallies. Thankfully, she pulls free before it can react. “I’ve seen many more cases of stigmata in my lifetime than I can count,” she says. Humming, she runs her thumb across Castiel’s forehead, over the pinpricks marring his skin. “This, fortunately, isn’t God-given.”
But Dean’s office is cozy, with a bench sitting up against the wall and an adjustable chair in the middle. Along the marble-topped desk, a large array of colored bottles sit, some full, others verging on empty. He pulls sets of needles and a machine from a drawer, followed by a three-ringed binder filled with pages upon pages.
“You were thinking of the easiest escape route,” Castiel says. “Granted, if we had walked to the car, we could’ve driven back to the hotel.”
Sinking to the floor, Sam sits with his back against the wall while Dean sobs, unrepentant and terrified. Nothing he can do would ever ease Dean’s hurt, and just watching him, red-faced and snot pouring from his nose, all Sam wants to do is console him, to offer him
Castiel hums, tightening his grip. Dean lets out a groan, his eyelids fluttering. “Don’t think I’m not capable of fulfilling your desires,” he says, his voice gravel-rough. “Maybe humans aren’t enough for you, anymore. Maybe you crave the touch of the angels, or maybe it’s the other way around.”
—only, the longer Castiel remains silent, the deeper Dean hurts, his heart aching every time he looks across the room.
Castiel cocks his head before shaking out his sleeve. His blade falls free, and he hands it over, the handle pointed toward Dean. “You aren’t planning to conduct a ritual, are you?”
“Not like that,” Castiel finishes.
Slow, Dean rubs the space between Castiel’s shoulders. His wings expand, invisible, one wrapping around Dean, the other draped over the edge of the couch. Rowena takes notice, but doesn’t let it show. “Herein lies the issue.” She taps the tops of Castiel’s bandages, motioning for him to reveal his palms. “The spell to bring forth Stigmata requires time and effort and the hand of an extremely skilled witch. Now, I didn’t cast it, mind you, but I could name a few people who could.”
Anger again, then sadness. Castiel closes his eyes, lips turned into a scowl. “It doesn’t matter.”
“That saves me from having to interrogate them myself,” Rowena chirps. “My methods are a bit more unorthodox, as you’ve seen.”
Jaw tight, Dean averts his eyes. He continues to carve and ignores the drone of Sam and Castiel’s voices, and the sun hanging high overhead.
“And Jesus, but no.” Castiel slows his rock, his feet planted on the floorboards. “Dean, I’m not asking you to tell me about your family’s passive aggressiveness. That’s the last thing I want. But I can’t—” He stops, something akin to wonder flashing across his eyes. “I’m finding it hard to imagine you talking about angels.”
Dean refuses to answer for a long minute, not until he can breathe again. Spitting, he wipes his mouth on the back of his hand, looking two seconds from becoming violently ill again. “I wanna go home,” he mutters, utterly pathetic. Yet, he never tears his eyes away from Castiel, even when the woman—about a full head shorter than him—pulls him into an embrace. “Charlie, I—”
Recognition flashes across Castiel’s eyes. Faint, but it’s there, highlighting his cheeks in the dark. “Dean,” he breathes—
Right, because the world ending on a sunny day is the kind of irony he strives for.
. Grabbing his pants from the bottom of the bag, Dean shrugs them on without looking up from the floor. “I’ll hit up the lobby,” he says, grabbing the room key. “Give me five minutes.”
Again, Castiel kisses his knuckles, whispering words into his skin. All the while, Dean presses his nails into the bridge of his nose until he leaves indents behind. Pain grounds him. Castiel wishes it didn't. “I don’t know what to do,” Castiel admits. “I don't know where to take you where you won’t be hunted, and I don't know if the angels would be willing to help. They’re hands-off, Dean, I’m the only… I’m the only angel who’s looked after a human.”
“You can.” Standing, Castiel tips Dean’s chin with the pad of his finger. Dean moves with him, eyes fluttering shut when Castiel drops a kiss to his lips. He tastes of coffee and salt from the stray tear falling into the crease of his nose. “Please, Dean.”
The same book that Dean found in the library a few days ago, fit snugly into the carved-out pages of a Bible. Bound in leather and smelling of bourbon, the pages are inscribed in Enochian and translated into Latin, two languages Dean doesn’t know, but that Castiel can recite by heart. A spell book of sorts, written by angels for angels, as a way to transfer their knowledge down to fledglings. Only, the Men of Letters intercepted it and hid it away.
Almost on cue, Sam flushes bright red, all the way to his ears.
“The Tetons?” Dean asks, and Iofiel nods. Any other time of day, and her smile would be infectious. Now, Dean just wants to sleep.
Castiel wishes he could disagree. “That would imply we’ve been on one date,” he says instead, and Dean freezes. Panic flares, not for himself, but for the man shrinking away. Again, he reaches out, making sure that no one has wandered inside before he takes Dean’s hand into his own. “Dean—”
, which explains how he ended up here.
instead of
Castiel glances away, distant. “I guess we both have things we don’t want to discuss,” he murmurs. “He continually attempts to bribe me into giving up my education to benefit his own wallet. Though, he won’t admit to the latter. The implication has always been there.” Sighing, he turns his face into the bedding. “Whenever I fly home, he’ll continue to chase me, but if I stay here, he’ll harass me on the phone. I’m starting to think the only way to escape is to move to an island in the Maldives.”
“C’mon,” Dean huffs. “Don’t gotta get all sentimental on me. It’s just a tattoo.”
“Then trust me.” He presses Dean’s knuckles to his lips. “You truly are a remarkable man, Dean Winchester.”
“It’s alright,” Castiel murmurs. “It’s alright, Dean. I forgive you.”
As the days go on, Dean grows restless. Not for a hunt, but for something to do with his hands, to keep his mind occupied. Most mornings, Castiel packs up his supplies just in time to find Dean emerging from his room, fully dressed and half-asleep, with an empty thermos in his hand. Castiel doesn’t question it and wanders into the kitchen with him, waiting for the coffee to brew.
Much to Castiel’s suspicions, there really isn’t much to do in Lyle other than sit around. The downtown area looks picturesque, like a Hollywood fantasy that they’ve never been able to replicate fully. Just a small strip of land in the center of town, with century-old brick shops lining the street, aging signage hanging over the doors and names painted on the glass. The smell of barbecue wafts through the square, and townspeople wander about, some alone, others talking amongst each other.
The rest of the drive is quiet, for the most part. Just the noise from the road and the occasional static from the radio, the jarring rattle from a pothole. Castiel fully wakes Dean when the world stops moving and the engine no longer hums. The house looks the same as he left it, all red brick walls and black shutters, with three chimneys jutting up from the roof. The yard needs a good mow, and something red stains the concrete, from a memory that will haunt him for the rest of his life.
Castiel chuckles and hoists Dean’s leg up and around his thigh. “I won’t.”
Pushing away from the Impala, Dean pulls Castiel into a kiss. He tastes like air and smells of Dean’s shampoo, his skin warm. He wants to fall into Castiel’s wings, wants to be held in this moment for the rest of his life. Because this, this is something Dean hasn’t felt before, the unconditionality of love in its purest form, given freely from an angel. And given to him specifically—solely because Dean exists, because Dean can love him back just as fiercely. He doesn’t ever want to stop.
“We’ve tried them.” Sam shakes his head, and the woman loosens her shoulders, just barely. “They don’t… understand. A place in Jacksonville tried to commit him for insanity, and I had to sneak him out in the middle of the night. Please—”
“I know.” Missouri looks over at her monitor, satisfied with whatever she sees. “I know it’s hard for you, and I can’t lie and I say that I know how it feels. But if this man you met—”
“I figured as much.” Castiel looks up to the ceiling, his brow pinched. “It explains the library upstairs, and why there’s a scimitar on the wall.”
Sweat beginning to bead at his nape, Dean looks out toward the road. At a distance, a train rumbles its way toward him, wheels grinding along the track. Cars drive past, barely paying him or the motel any mind. Just another ordinary day. Blue skies, pleasant air, and an angel loitering by his room door, like wearing a raincoat in the middle of spring is suddenly in style. “You’re gonna get heat stroke,” Dean says and takes a swig from his bottle. “You always wear that thing?”
“I mean, my brakes are fucking done!” Dean shouts. If he keeps his feet off the pedals, he can maybe make it into fourth or fifth place, given the gap he has between himself and the rest of the field. Only a few hundred feet left. He can make it, can already see the checkered flag waving.
Whatever Sam and Castiel are saying—animatedly, excitedly, all emotions Dean can’t exactly recognize anymore—he can’t hear. Not because the skillet in front of him is crackling, or that the ocean is incredibly loud for this time of morning, but because try as he might, he still can’t completely comprehend that Castiel is alive and breathing, and sitting at the bar in front of a mug of coffee and last week’s issue of the Beachcomber.
The mattress dips. Cautiously, Castiel releases Dean’s wrist and palms Dean’s bare shoulder. He should have slept with a shirt on, but then again, he should’ve done a lot of things differently. “Tell me where you are,” Castiel says. It’s a request, but to his brain, it might as well be an order.
“Dean,” Sam accuses. Just how he wants to start the morning, by being scolded. “I’ve been trying to call you for hours. It’s almost noon, man.”
“And I’ll break it, too.” In the cramped confines of the dormer, Castiel leans forward to kiss him, knocking the wind from Dean’s lungs. “I’ll break your heart in hundreds of ways, and you’ll love it, because I’m the one who made you feel. And you make me feel, in turn. You opened my eyes, and I’ve learned that there’s more to life than being an angel. There’s the experiences, the feelings, the fact that every morning, I want to kiss you. I want to feel your body close to mine, and I want to—”
Dean nods along with his every word, his eyes growing heavy. Gentle, he settles his hand over Castiel’s hip, idly digging his nails into the fabric. “I’m tired,” he says, quiet. “All the time, Cas. Minute we got back, I just felt… gutted. Like I’m existing, but I’m not here. See that guy right there?” Dean points to the television. On the screen stands a man in a black shirt tucked into his jeans and a black jacket, wearing an aged Stetson and a pair of sunglasses that completely block out his eyes. His beard covers most of his face, and he swears every other word. Dean’s type, definitely. “I love this show. I just binged an entire season ‘cause I can’t get out of bed, and I might as well be watching infomercials.”
It’s an idea, one he’ll entertain in the morning when he’s more conscious. As it is, Dean can barely keep his eyes open, and showering is the last thing on his mind. “Stay with me,” he mumbles, blinking lazily. Castiel nods, sliding an arm around Dean’s waist. The tail of his coat just barely covers Dean’s ankles.
“Save it for next time,” Dean laughs—or tries.
Horror widens her eyes. Whatever Martha sees, Dean doesn’t know, but she practically cowers. If she were wearing something modest, she might have knelt in the dirt. “So you’re the one who laid waste to an entire army,” she growls, shaky. “Those were good men, angel, and you slaughtered them.”
“Dean,” Sam blurts, catching Dean’s attention. Looking up, Dean stops chewing and waits, his stomach unsure of whether to bottom out or lurch up his throat. “We’re going down to the beach, you in?”
Maybe an over-exaggeration—but the few guys Dean has sucked off never seemed to mind, and Castiel probably won’t care regardless, as long as it feels good. Mouthing at Castiel’s cock, he watches Castiel throw his head back, Adam’s apple bobbing as he swallows. He’s warm, heady in a way that goes right to Dean’s libido; his mouth waters as he unzips Castiel’s slacks, pulling him free of his boxers. Hurried, Dean shoves Castiel’s pants down mid-thigh, giving him more room, more skin to touch.
“When you found me,” Dean asks when the road straightens out, “how bad… How bad was it?”
After a moment of horror, Castiel spins and drops to his knees at Dean’s side. Dean reaches out for him, tearing at Castiel’s arms. Clipped, harsh breaths—Dean is alive, and Alastair is dead and gone. “Cas—”
Shivering, Dean throws the blanket over his head, covering his eyes. Castiel’s touch remains, and Dean falls asleep to fingers gliding through his hair, keeping him steady, grounding him to the bed and the air around him.
He blinks. Tries to think, tries to come up with any description of Dean’s tattoos, but he hasn’t ever seen Dean nude. All of this is new, the sigil engraved into the top of his hand, the rosary painted around his neck, the feather lingering just beneath his ear. All ones he can see, but the rest, he can barely make out without inspection. “I’m sorry,” Castiel mumbles. “I don’t know. It’s been a… very long time.”
Dean lifts a brow. “What, like, angel dick then?”
His sincerity breaks Dean at his core. “You don’t.” Standing, Dean takes Castiel by the shoulder—then his neck, thumbs pressed over the notch of his throat. “Look at me, Cas. Look at me and tell me that you don’t deserve this.”
“Yes.” Castiel looks down at himself, his eyes the slightest bit sad. “When Heaven recalled me, the angels, they… forced their hand on me. They ripped me from my vessel and attempted to reconstruct my Grace as they saw fit. Their soldier, once again. Only, the moment I possessed Jimmy, I no longer felt his soul with me. It’s possible he died from his injuries, but he’s no longer in pain.”
A pine falls at some point overnight, crashing from the tree line into the clearing.
Sitting beside him, Castiel rests his hand, palm up, on the side of the tub. Sheepish, Dean takes it, the first willing touch he’s given in half an hour. “You exploded,” he says. “You fucking—exploded, what’s up with that?”
Dean lifts a brow. “Oh, is that what you think? Baby’s not good enough for you?”
“Patience,” Castiel rumbles. He sets the book down, then cradles Dean’s face, pressing two fingers to his lips. He tastes like old paper and even older ink, but Dean sucks them into his mouth anyway, splitting them with his tongue. “How long do you think you’d last if I deprived you of orgasm?”
“I’m not dead,” Castiel mutters, turning his face into the sheets. Sonia trills and opens her eyes, her third eyelid half-retracted. “Did I follow you to bed?”
“No,” Sam says.
Broad, strong hands take Dean’s wrists and pin them into the pillows—after that, all Dean knows is Castiel’s weight on him, in him, and that he never wants it to stop. Castiel starts out slow, pulling out before hilting, again and again. Each time, Dean gasps, shivers running up his spine, his cock straining for friction in his hand. He wants to come—has wanted it for the last few minutes—but giving in now would ruin the fun. Part of him suspects Castiel wouldn't care, given the way he moves, single-minded and enthralled.
“Why would that make you a dick?” Bobby removes his hat, setting it on the nightstand. Thirty years in the sport, and he still has all his hair, even if he went gray at thirty-five. “Dean, you’re in your prime. You’ve got enough wins under your belt to make anyone the happiest man alive. But that don’t mean you can’t think about it. Hell, your daddy wanted to quit the second he got in the car for the first time. He liked to pretend he was the toughest son of a bitch on the track, but he was scared, ‘cause all of his friends? He watched them hit the wall one by one. He always swore, the minute he got into the big one, he was done.”
Slowly but surely, Dean wakes, his heart rate quickening under Castiel’s palm. Snuffling, he lifts the pillow and turns his head, squinting at Castiel in the shadows. “Time is it?”
Slowly—glacially slowly—Dean’s anger abates. “How do I know you’re not just saying that?”
. “Dude.” Dean presses a kiss to his cheek, then his lips, waiting until Castiel softens. “This your way of telling me you’re a virgin?”
“You the new guy?” the man asks, and Castiel nods, all he can think to do. “Name’s Ash. Heard you just rolled into town, got your classes all settled?”
Beyond a dented mailbox sits a one-story brick home, with a wraparound porch and a tire swing in a tree. And in the dark, Dean makes out the shape of his father with a newspaper in his hand, screaming at someone. That someone, being the woman who called him, begging for an intervention.
“I remember the way I drove here.” Castiel takes the container and sets it in the floorboard. “Make your way to Columbus and head west.”
“Let me have my moment,” Dean whines. “C’mon. Jet skis, Cas. It’ll be fun, wind in your hair, you’ll get to see me bust my ass.”
Dean snorts, hiding his embarrassment behind his palm. “Thought that was a whole stereotype, the whole boyfriend-at-first-sight thing.”
, he thinks, looking to the moon.
Sitting in the front seat of his Continental, Castiel looks at the faded red of the Roses sign a few spots away, with a bird nest perched in the top bend of the E and multiple piles of potting soil and rakes sitting outside of the front doors. Heat bakes the asphalt, permeating through the windshield no matter how hard the air conditioner blows. The breeze doesn’t help.
Dean opens his mouth to speak—to say
But Dean doesn’t like him like that, so far as Castiel can tell. And if he does, then Dean won’t admit it to himself, or to others, out of a sense of fear that Castiel can’t understand. Dean deserves to be loved, but will barely let himself be touched even when he needs it the most.
Dean snorts and sits back, his arms over his stomach. “How’d you peg me?” he asks, defensive. “What, you thought you’d just walk over and stick your tongue in my mouth—”
“Do you think he’ll be okay?” Eileen asks, and that—Sam has no idea. “Sam, if you think he might do something stupid, we need to stop him.”
Castiel crosses his arms. “How did you know?”
Castiel, surprisingly, eats, although he picks at his plate for a while beforehand. Sam continues talking, all of it static in Dean’s ears. Plate in hand, Dean leans against the fridge and pretends to care about the conversation, but all he sees is Castiel, the crumbs clinging to his lower lip, his fingers around the handle of his fork, the smile occasionally meeting his eyes. He’s beautiful, even more than Dean remembered, and just looking at him makes his heart race, triggering his brain to start producing enough serotonin to notice that the sun is shining.
? “Never been a heavy sleeper.”
Sam laughs and shakes his head. “Doubt it’s a bomb. C’mon.”
All Castiel had left, and it fits in such a small spot. Dean tries to pull his hand away, but Castiel refuses to let him go—because on Castiel’s finger as well, a mark blooms to life, gold shimmering in the sun. His eyes widen as he admires his hand, turning it over.
, Castiel thinks. Cradling Dean’s nape, he draws him in, intent on drinking every ounce of affection he can find.
Made whole.
For far too long, Dean watches him stand and pace the room, his steps sluggish, just as exhausted as Dean feels. There’s a bed upstairs, one he desperately wants to crawl into, but Castiel is his priority, even if Castiel doesn’t want to be here. “Amara took the bomb,” Dean says, lowering his head. “They just left, and said that this was the last straw. If we die, we die, and that’s it. No more resurrections, no more miracles, just us and the world. And I called you, but Sam said you’d taken off, and—”
Without promoting, Dean closes the gap between them. Not for a kiss, but he pulls Castiel in for a hug, his arms around his neck and his body close. Castiel presses his nose into Dean’s throat, inhaling the scent of him, like smoke and that body wash he uses to mask the lavender in his shampoo. He burns hot, drawing Castiel in, like a moth to the flame. Holding Dean is second nature, his body, his soul the one thing Castiel has longed for. Companionship, forgiveness—affection, all of it freely given, because Dean can.
Castiel nods, never quite meeting Dean’s eyes. “How long have you thought about retiring?”
, he thinks.
Mold and mildew waft through the air as Dean makes his way through the halls, the walls cold and wet from a fog that never quite abates. Water soaks the floors, destroying any chance of stealth he might have. Not that it matters. Lilith probably knows he’s there, and that Castiel is hovering close by, out of sight but never out of reach.
“Look, I don’t care about who’s dead and who isn’t.” Jaw squared, Dean looks Martha in the eye. “Someone put out a hit on me, lady. And I wanna know who’s got the balls to come up here and gut me like a pig.”
Later, he’ll tell Dean what he can stomach, but only if Dean doesn’t find out first.
? Castiel turns his attention to him, blue eyes curious. “You were…” Dean starts. “There was this case, and some vamp turned you. Said your Grace would fight it and you’d be fine, but you—you bit me, here.” He motions to his neck, where his skin burns hot, and not just from the shower. “You were gonna kill me, but I woke up.”
“He ruined my plan,” Alastair spits. “But I won’t fail this time. And I’ll use you to break him. One. Last. Time.”
“Sorry.” Castiel kisses his collar in apology. “Which would you prefer, sex or a nap?”
Smart. Something normal people wouldn't think of, and that no one should have to. “It’s nice,” Castiel says, and Dean brightens. “Do you have any suspicions on where the nest might be located?”
. “You’re bullshitting me, right?”
“Get ready,” Castiel cuts him off.
And Castiel can't help but let him.
“You weren’t supposed to die,” Castiel says. It doesn’t make Dean feel any better. “You were supposed to die in your sleep at seventy-two, but someone intervened. It wasn’t your fault, Dean, and Heaven knows that now.”
“I only know what I can see. And from what I can tell, your brother is impressionable. He’s swayed much too far into the dark, and I’m afraid that without intervention, you may never see him as he was.” Castiel touches his cheek—Dean turns away. “Dean.”
. “I’ve got an extra set of trunks in the bathroom cabinet. Just—go, have fun.”
Then, a rasp. Jerking around, Dean squints against the sudden light in the abyss, forming the shape of a man. The shape doesn’t move, but it does fade into being. Heart in his throat, Dean runs to it, clasping the being’s face. Stubble, ruffled hair, and swooping eyelids—Dean’s heart bottoms into his shoes.
A small smile creeps over Castiel’s lips. “For what it’s worth, I would’ve rescued you the minute I got the chance.”
“Good, good.” Ash lets him go, afterward propping his hands on his hips. “Hey, so, I shouldn’t be telling you this, y’know, new guy and all, but there’s gonna be a party outside of town tonight. Christen the year off, all that stuff. Look for the smoke and bring shoes you don’t care about, you’re gonna need ‘em.”
for once. “That’s—Cas, that doesn’t make me any better than Sam, if I’m bleeding you, and for what?”
“Apparently,” Castiel mutters, neutral.
.” Castiel steps closer, a question on his lips. “Are you—Do you think this is a dream?”
The medicine cabinet comes up empty save for a bottle of expired painkillers. In the cabinet over the toilet, though, he finds the jackpot—a box of medical supplies and a sewing kit with needles still in sterile packaging. “Thank you,” he says to no one and rips several gauze strips from the box. Needles and antiseptic set aside, Dean runs the tap and strips his shirt off, arms protesting with the strain.
, Dean thinks. He moans and trembles, his tongue heavy, his hips desperate to spread wider as Castiel strokes him, teases him, brings him to the edge, only to back away. Again and again, Castiel urges him to the precipice and stops, and each time, Dean whines, verging on tears. Because this might as well be heaven, with Castiel surrounding him, in him, locked in an embrace from head to toe.
Every day, Dean wishes the same. Rather than speak, Dean pulls him into a kiss, tasting the coffee on Castiel’s tongue. Castiel sighs when they part, his breath shaking ever so slightly. “Don’t fall asleep in class.”
“Right.” He wishes he had a map, but he’ll take Castiel’s word for it. “You ready?”
“Yeah.” Sam hands over a few of the sand dollars and pats his pockets. “I got a couple more, if you want them. If not, I can throw them back—”
“Dude, no,” Dean gasps. “Far as I know, we’re just normal people. Besides, wouldn't you know if I was some kinda Nephilim or whatever?”
“Cas…” Dean whispers, heated.
“He never really got to know his dad.” Mary pouts, her eyes hazy. “John died when Sammy was just a baby. My parents came to live with us for a while, until I could find work. I’d taken off to raise them, and all I had was his life insurance to get by. It was enough, but with two kids, it wouldn’t’ve lasted long.” She stops, shaking her head. “I thought we’d be together for a few more years, at least. But the storm… Dean was scared for so long, any time the wind blew. I don’t even know if he remembers it.”
From the front seat of the Continental, he types out
Another sigh. Castiel dovetails their fingers, trembling. “It’s recovering. Slower than I’d like, but being here… helps. There’s a… peace here, that I never felt in Lebanon. We were protected, yes, but we were also surrounded by too many memories, too much darkness. I found myself staring at the walls, waiting for something to happen. For the world to end, for someone to break in and attack us in our sleep… I couldn't stand the silence.”
Shuddering, Dean manages to worm his way closer, their lips close enough to touch. “This ‘s better than sex,” he says, his words slurred. “So much better.”
“I love you,” Dean says, as quiet as the marsh. “For years, I’ve… I wanted to tell you. I always did, but the world kept ending, and you died, and I… I mourned you. You never saw me, every time you left. I couldn't deal with it, I didn't know who to turn to. I never… And I never told you to stop.” A breath. Dean sags, his mouth twisting in anguish as he speaks. “I never thought you’d come back.”
“Shh,” Castiel murmurs, pushing down on Dean’s tongue.
By the time he returns, Dean has put on a pair of socks, bright pink with CATS stitched into each well over a dozen times. He sits up in bed, his curiosity reaching his eyes. His lips taste of spearmint toothpaste. Warm hands come up to cradle Castiel’s face, urging him into the sheets. But Castiel won’t indulge him, not yet. Even then, he can barely manage to rip away from Dean’s touch, his skin crawling with the need to have Dean’s hands on him, always.
After that, Dean goes with the motions, striving to fall back into his father’s favor. He hasn’t seen his brother in years, and his mother holds him whenever he can sneak in and cries, wishing he could come home.
“This is the room I was assigned to,” Castiel interrupts. Dean’s heart lurches. His roommate—the first guy he’s ever kissed is his
There’s no other way to get him down. No ladder, no landing pad, nothing to cushion the fall. The second Dean pulls the first hook free, Castiel’s wing collapses, slumping toward the floor. The second follows, and the rafters shudder, holding up Castiel purely by his wrists and a length of rope. “I’m sorry,” he whispers to no one, pulling a switchblade from his back pocket. “You don’t know how sorry I am.”
“Does that mean someone died?” Dean asks, choosing to look at the blade in Castiel’s hands. “Since there’s not exactly an angel attached to it.”
Castiel’s eyes soften. “I don’t know whether I should apologize,” he says, and Dean laughs.
Dean nearly snorts his drink up his nose.
“Thought that was just my stomach.” Sighing, Dean sets his fork down and ducks his head, hands in his hair. “There’s something wrong with my head.”
Spanish moss gracefully sways in the breeze, the limbs of the live oaks rustling, the only noise he hears. All of the tourists left hours ago, long before he wandered over and sat down, intent to sit there for the rest of his life. Idly, he scratches his jaw, stubble growing in thick and beginning to itch. Whether from chiggers or just his inattentiveness, he doesn’t know, and can’t bring himself to care.
“C’mon,” Dean huffs and turns his head. Castiel chases him, pressing a chaste kiss to his temple in apology. “Can’t just get handsy on me here.”
“No you’re not,” Benny huffs a laugh. “Man’s probably never held a gun in his life, you see his hands?”
Gently, Castiel coaxes Dean’s hand into his, twining their fingers. Dean holds him, squeezing until it hurts. “When did you check out?”
In his semi-long history of hunting, Dean has learned multiple things about the occult, one being that blood pacts are difficult. Sitting in the middle of the most complicated circular design he’s ever seen, Dean watches Castiel carve sigils into the dirt with the tip of one of Bobby’s kitchen knives, the one with the label on the handle reading
Castiel shakes his head. “She’s efficient. Which is probably the nicest thing I can say about her.”
Castiel grips him tighter. “If this is your brother, and if he saw you die like he did, then he might like the closure of seeing you alive again.”
“It’s nice.” Fabric rustles. Castiel opens an eye to watch Benny pull a cigarette from a half-empty pack. He lights it with a flimsy match, the kind left over from the heyday of motels and interstate travel, and snuffs it out before taking a drag. Castiel itches with a sudden craving. A habit he kicked years ago, festering beneath the skin. “Kinda drives you up the wall, but it’s nice. Quiet, mostly.” He exhales, smoke pouring through his nostrils. “Can’t stand the chickens.”
“Yeah, I get it.” Really, Dean does. Castiel just experienced a traumatic event, and as much as Dean wants to hold him, Castiel needs his privacy, needs a space to grieve that isn’t bogged down in nearly forty years of touch starvation and daddy issues. One day, he’ll ask Castiel to share his bed—until then, he’ll wait. “What car do you want from the garage?”
“One last question.” She stands on her toes. “Your brother won in Atlanta last week, do you think there’s any competition brewing there?”
Castiel kisses his cheek, afterward thumbing the spot. Another rush of tears spills, and Dean wipes them away. “Go,” he says, motioning to the fire. Dean won’t remember this in the morning anyway, depending on how much he drank. “Have fun.”
Pulling free, Castiel lets Dean down. Dean falls into him, and Castiel wraps his wings around his back, keeping him close. “How was that?”
Dean cleans the spot after he finishes and takes the transfer paper. He holds it there for a moment, twisting and turning it until he finds the right placement. Cold, gloved fingers press the parchment into his chest, smoothing the purple ink down and pulling it away. “Alright, tell me how it looks.” Dean hands him a mirror, and Castiel holds it up, marveling at the lines and what eventually might be. “Do I need to move it?”
Dean doesn’t reply. Instead, he pulls Castiel into his arms, and Castiel moves with him, his body wracked in tremors. He burns hot, so unlike just seconds before, Grace once again flooding his veins. But how is a question Dean refuses to have answered, so long as Castiel is breathing. “It’s okay,” he whispers to himself, above the sound of Castiel’s question, repeating on a loop until that’s all Dean knows. “It’s okay, Cas. It’s okay.”
Benny shakes his head. “Thibodaux, Louisiana. Folks moved us out here after Katrina, and we ended up stayin’. I went back the year after, just to see what was left, and all we had was a concrete slab.” He coughs and chases it with a cigarette. “Figure our little trailer’s fine. I’m only here ‘til I graduate.”
“Wait,” Castiel starts just as Naomi stands and Hannah turns. Both face him, Hannah out of curiosity and Naomi in perpetual annoyance. He tucks his sword away into the ether and looks down at Dean, who clings to him, nose tucked into Castiel’s hip. “I healed him last night, and I felt—something. Something I haven’t felt in centuries, when the last of the Nephilim were born. He’s a remarkable human.” A hand in Dean’s hair, he turns his attention to Naomi. “He saw me, outside of my vessel. He survived the blast of my Grace imploding. He—His soul recognizes me, in a way no human should be able to.”
Dawning crosses Castiel’s face, his eyes wide, tongue tracing his lower lip. Dean follows it, unable to hold back a quiet moan. “You lust for me,” Castiel says, and Dean nods, unable to do much else. “This would be considered a sin, to lust for the divine. But it’s not my flesh you crave.” He takes Dean’s hand and presses his lips to the tips of Dean’s fingers. “I see it in you, in your soul. You want to touch me, but you’re afraid that I won’t love you back.”
“How boring.”
The shivers settle in a minute after, his teeth chattering, his blood ice. No matter how many blankets Sam gives him, Dean can’t warm up. His temperature, according to Jack, is normal. This must be shock, then, or hysteria—and whatever it is, Dean wishes it would just stop.
“This ain’t the last time you’re gonna see me.” Taking his wrist, Dean presses a kiss to the center of his palm. “No one’s dying here, okay? So don’t give me a goodbye speech.”
Castiel nods, a pressure in his chest. “Where are we?”
“There’s nothing here,” Castiel says, reemerging from the sidewalk. Carefully, he locks the door and backs away, blade still in hand. Dean looks over the room, half-expecting something to have snuck in in the interim, but finds nothing but dark corners and the steady glow emitting from Castiel’s eyes.
The longer Castiel stays with him, the longer Castiel touches him, the more fond Dean grows. That’s what scares him the most.
“Good.” With another kiss, Dean steals a cupcake and takes a bite. Probably not the best breakfast in the world, but it’ll do until they can make it to the next town. “You got the map?”
. Rubbing the back of his neck, Dean looks anywhere other than Castiel. “Put a lot of thought into that, huh?” he says, his heart not in it to josh Castiel around. He stops by a booth selling jewelry and pokes at the rings. Castiel, meanwhile, tries on several bracelets, some made of smoothed gemstones, others from carved bits of wood. Behind the table, a disinterested eighteen-year-old swipes through videos on her phone, laughing every few seconds.
Dean likes him. It should terrify him, should send him into a panic, but it… doesn’t. Not as long as Castiel touches him, as long as Castiel looks at him and
Still, shame roils in his gut. “I wanted to,” he says, his voice wavering. “But if you don’t—”
. The world isn’t ending, his family is whole once again, and Castiel is in his bed. Everything he’s ever wanted, but none of it feels real. “I don’t deserve this,” Dean mutters, still managing to grin despite it all. “None of it, Cas, and you know it. I should be dead in a ditch somewhere. I should’ve been in your place, but instead I’m here—”
, Dean thinks. Leaning in, he kisses the corner of Castiel’s lips, his heart threatening to break free from his chest—and this time, Castiel kisses him back, just a chaste press of lips against his own. Tears spring to his eyes anyway, spilling when he goes in for a second, then a third. Fingers thread through his hair, light, tentative. “Can’t believe you’re gonna make me walk around naked.”
, Castiel thinks.
. Tears flood Castiel’s eyes. Holding his wrist doesn’t ease his pain, nor does touching Castiel’s shoulder. “Dean, what did you do—”
Castiel sighs through his nose. “Basic demographics, followed by questions about their upbringing and religious beliefs, what circumstances led to where they are today. Are they homeless, are they out to their parents, are they closeted with or without intent to come out.”
“Yeah.” Dean chuckles, hiding the flush heating his cheeks. “Offer’s still open, if you’d wanna…”
“I’d rather sit here for a while,” Castiel says, eventually pushing his plate away. Hunger is strange, he finds; one minute, he fears he might pass out, and the next, he can’t stomach another bite. It’ll take time to get used to, Sam told him during breakfast—but how long? Days, months, years? “I’m not feeling well,” he lies, head cradled in his hands.
Dean sighs, so deeply that Castiel wonders if Dean died in his arms. “Long story,” he mutters. “Did you fly here?”
Iofiel’s face softens, a small smile on her lips. “We aren’t allotted happiness, our kind,” she says to Dean. “Please be kind to him. If any of us deserve happiness, it’s Castiel.”
The sun doesn’t set in Sioux Falls until well after nine in the evening, giving it the chance to thoroughly bake the plains throughout the day. By the time they make it to town, Dean’s shirt is soaked, and Castiel is down to his dress shirt, coat and jacket tossed into the back seat. He unbuttoned his shirt somewhere around Fort Dodge, and Dean fidgeted for a long few minutes. Castiel isn’t quite sure what to make of that reaction.
Castiel looks over at the front door, wide-eyed. The oldest home he ever stepped foot into was his father’s ranch house in San Luis Obispo, and that was built in the late thirties. Not the eighteen-hundreds, and with nowhere near the history.
In fact, all Castiel can hear is Dean’s soft pants in his ear and the slick sound of their bodies as they converge. Around their knees, feathers litter the bed. Castiel’s wings fan out, offering themselves to Dean’s touch. And Dean touches them, gripping the muscles of Castiel’s top arch as he sits up, taking Castiel deeper, so much deeper. Castiel’s eyes roll back, his lips between his teeth as Dean lifts his hips, then slides down, engulfing him in warmth.
Turning his head, he spots Dean leaning against the porch railing, dressed in a gray, fraying robe and his hair matted to his head. Sunlight brightens his eyes, the dark circles finally easing.
“Holy shit,” Dean says, and Sam laughs. “How did I miss that?”
A tear seeps free, dripping from Castiel’s chin. Dean wipes it away, probably leaving behind a red stain. “Dean…”
Fingertips trace across his cheek and curl around his ear, sending shivers to his toes. Dean sneaks an arm underneath Castiel’s coat, then the rest of his clothing, in search of the bare skin between Castiel’s shoulder blades. He’s warm, his kiss even warmer as his lips press to Dean’s forehead, his cheek, the corner of his lips. “Stay,” Dean says as he drifts off with a sigh. “Just…”
“Think you want more than that,” Dean adds, and Castiel laughs, breathy.
Castiel smiles and ducks his head. Dean barely makes out the hint of a flush highlighting his cheeks, dying the tips of his ears red. “I think I want something more fitting,” he says, and—Dean can work with that. As long as Castiel’s sudden preference isn’t skintight leather, then he can maybe get by without being uncomfortably hard just looking at him. “I need new clothing as well.”
“You too?” Dean asks.
“Oh, uh.” Dean plugs in the combination to the other two locks and pulls open the doors. He finds two angel blades in the last cabinet, one stained with rusted blood, the other broken in half. “He’s got a smelter in the shed. You know how to make bullets?”
His heart swells, torn between overjoyed and aching. “Not just racing, man.” He pulls away, far enough to look into Castiel’s eyes. “I want… I want you here, y’know, if you’ll… If you’ll have me.”
Doubt, fear, anger, all of it fade away as the soul before him holds him tight. With his other hand, Dean reaches out and touches the space between Castiel’s eyes, his face nothing but cold, formless porcelain. Castiel shudders but refuses to turn away.
. There’s still monsters left, and people are still dying—but selfish as it is, Dean wants to wake up with the sun in his eyes and a warm body close by, wants to sit on his porch in the summer or relax by the lake. Wants to teach Castiel how to fish, just to see if he likes it. And none of those things are available in Kansas without making the effort.
He finds the lake later in the day, a few dozen feet from the collapsed wreckage of the barn. It sits in the middle of a thicket of trees, wide enough to maybe row a canoe in and swim come summertime, and to fish, most importantly.
And Sam laughs, all he can do. “Yeah. But he was there, and that’s all that matters.”
John drinks. Always has, ever since Dean was old enough to know what alcohol was. The quantity, though, has skyrocketed over the years, from maybe a beer to day to a beer to start it off. How he manages to work perpetually drunk, Dean has no clue, but tonight must be bad, for Mary to call him. Their house—his former home—is five minutes from town, down a barren road lined with farmhouses and land dotted with pines and pecan trees.
The noise of the television enters his senses, reruns of Magnum, P.I. now replaced with the Kansas City news. Dean’s warmth bleeds into him where they slot together, Dean’s front to his back and an arm around his waist. His fingers hang limp, resting over the soft fabric of Castiel’s sweatshirt. He must have changed clothes at some point, before they wandered into the ‘Dean cave’ and sprawled out across the couch.
Silence resumes in the wake of the collapse, a rain of dust and hay settling onto the floor. Gradually, Dean makes his way down and kneels in front of Castiel, his eyes still closed, but tighter now, like even in death, he’s pained. Dean can’t move him like this, with his wings mangled and limp. Bits of feathers poke out in every direction, and the topmost arch of each wing has split in two, effectively breaking them in half. His left wing severed close to the base; Dean reaches into the mass and pulls it away, revealing the fresh skin covering Castiel’s back, unlike the rot he expected.
Another minute. Then, a man emerges from behind a curtain, dressed in a black tank top and holey jeans. Ink decorates both of his arms from shoulder to wrist, and a silver hoop hangs from one earlobe. His face looks remarkably the same, his eyes the same vibrant green, his cheeks and jaw solid; a scar stretches across his right temple, silvered and faded. He pulls on a blue flannel shirt, hiding his skin—then stops, his face lifted and horror in his eyes.
Reluctantly, Dean drops his hand. He turns and leans against the wall, arms folded, caught up in how small Castiel looks sitting there, in Dean’s borrowed clothes, his coat nowhere to be found. “I tried to save you, Cas,” Dean says, to which Castiel nods. “You gotta believe me.”
, he thinks as he sits behind the wheel, parked a few dozen feet away. His palms sweat, heart racing. Two years, since he last saw his father, and now, there he is, unshaven and rounder in the belly, and just as nasty. Though the closed windows, he can hear the muffled noise of his shouts, all hurled at Mary as she sits on the front stoop with her head in her hands. Maybe he’ll let it out and move on.
Castiel shrugs. “I would’ve come up with something. I couldn't leave her, though. You saw the forecasts before we left, she wouldn’t have survived if I—”
The scent of bacon wafts in from the kitchen, along with ham and eggs. It clings to Mary’s hair and grows stronger as Castiel wanders through the halls in search of the source. His heart clenches in anticipation—only to stutter when the one he longs to see isn’t there. Instead, Sam mans the stove, pulling a skillet off the burner and dishing the contents onto a white ceramic plate. He turns, his frown quickly brightening.
Swallowing, Dean pulls Castiel’s hand closer. “Me too.”
it. Popping the buttons to his dress shirt with one hand, Castiel pets through Dean’s hair with the other, holding him in place. The thrill of it, of the prospect of being choked on Castiel’s cock, makes Dean gasp and leaves a smear of precome across his cheek. “Take it,” Castiel soothes, removing his hand. He pulls his shirt free, baring his chest—his unblemished, fucking
“And an angel?” Sam continues and looks over to Castiel, who sits before the crucible and waits, patient as ever, for the blades to melt down. “An actual angel?”
But here, the sun is warm and pleasant, and Castiel enjoys spending time outdoors more than staying in his room.
“We know Hell is stealing souls,” Castiel accuses. Martha stops, her eyes narrowed. “We have a suspicion that someone is trying to start Armageddon.”
When they started, the sun had been shining. An otherwise ordinary summer day, with temperatures in the nineties and not a cloud in the sky. The perfect day for desecrating a grave, or so Dean says. In reality, Castiel can think of better days, ones that don’t involve hoisting a shovel in broad daylight, and ones that involve cooler air to take the edge off.
“I know.” Looking down, Dean tries to find his feet. The surf continues to try to wash him inland, but he holds on, fighting each wave as it rushes past. “Just doesn’t feel real. Like there’s some loose string that Chuck’s about to pull just to fuck with us.”
The waitress comes by with their bill, and Dean leaves the entire twenty on the table on their way out. A procession of cars crawls into the parking lot, the noise of slamming doors and chatter inherently setting his teeth on edge. Too many people for one space. “Looks like we got out of there in time,” Dean says, and Castiel nods, avoiding a group of children piling out of the backseat of an Expedition. “What d’you think, wedding?”
“I know.” A gentle hand touches his cheek. Dean falls into it, letting out a shuddering breath. “But I’m here, if you need anything.”
“Hey,” Dean says with a shy smile. “You bring me food?”
Goodbyes are always hard. Leaving the only family he’s ever loved, even harder, but Mary wished him well with more than enough hugs, and a lipstick stain to his forehead to remember her by. If he wants, he can always drive back to see her, or take a plane if he’s absolutely desperate. And Castiel would probably go with him, depending on how this trip goes.
“Let me guess, I got ten minutes?” Dean asks.
Dreams. The last time Castiel dreamt was years ago, when Metatron ripped the life from him and left him broken and alone in the middle of nowhere. Only then, his dreams were nightmares, with monsters looming around every corner, and more often than not, a blade in Dean’s hand, held over his throat. Blinking, Castiel touches his lips, tracing the spots where the Shadow bound him to keep him from talking. It worked—too well, and nights like tonight, he can still feel the jagged bits of his own broken blade shoved into his mouth, sewing him shut.
Castiel goes with him without question. A smile upticks the corners of his lips, his eyes bright in the shade from the overhead awning. It smells like dust and hay inside, and the ceiling fans do little more than stir hot air. His luck, to find his way here in the middle of summer. “Would it shock you that I’m looking for a gift?” Castiel mentions, glancing at Dean out of the corner of his eye.
Low, Castiel hums. “You know that’s not true,” he says, and does something Dean never imagined possible. He touches Dean’s cheek, with the same hand that’s driven his car until the rubber wore off, with the same hand that’ve drawn blood and pulled bodies from burning vehicles. The same hand that Dean’s longed to touch for longer than he cares to admit. “You’re an excellent driver, but you’re smart, too, and thoughtful. Anyone would be lucky to have you in their box.”
Shy, Dean nods. “I’m yours,” he repeats, and just barely, he can feel the shadow of once was and what’s soon to disappear wrap around him, holding him close. Castiel kisses him in their shadow, and in that moment, Dean feels whole once more. “Let’s go home, Cas.”
. A decade, if he wants to be generous. Ever since Aaron slapped his ass after football practice in ninth grade and his dick decided to wake up. “I don’t know,” he says, not entirely a lie. “Long enough for my old man to kick me out.”
Colt still in hand, Castiel touches his bicep. “What is it?”
Sitting back, he watches Dean gather their plates and deposit them in the sink. He returns with the first-aid kit and pulls over the chair at Castiel’s side, afterward motioning for Castiel to face him. “I know you said you haven’t talked to anyone,” Dean says, gathering up several packages of gauze and bandages. He rips them open with his teeth and places two over the wound gouged into Castiel’s side, right through his tattoo. Castiel holds them in place while he unwraps a bandage, stretching it around his middle. “But did you come across anything suspicious? You smell sulfur, find any hex bags?”
Instead, Dean nods, sighing until his lungs ache. “Fucking hate coincidences,” he says.
Grinning, Castiel carries him out of the bathroom and back into Dean’s room, where he deposits him onto the mattress. This time, he locks the door before climbing into bed with him, welcomed back into Dean’s eager arms. Water clings to his throat and behind his ears where Castiel kisses him, sucking fresh marks while Dean pets through his wings, nails raking across the vanes. Shivers run down the length of his spine and spread through to the largest of his feathers, all of them casting light across the bed and onto the floor. Rainbows dance across Dean’s face, the green of his eyes sparkling.
“I know.” Heart thudding, Castiel speaks before he can properly think about his next words. “Can I touch your hair?”
A spark of hope lights Castiel’s eyes. Dean already knows his answer. “I’ll tell you on the morning we leave.”
Dean shakes his head. He covers Castiel’s hand, threading his fingers between the gaps. “I hate you,” he says, his heart not in it. “You left me.”
Castiel curls his fingers around Dean’s ear, letting them slide down to his collar, all the while sending shivers down Dean’s spine. “He’s already proud,” he says, then, “We’re all proud. There’s not a single moment that I haven’t been proud of you.” He smiles, barely there before it’s gone. “I’d been racing for nearly a decade when John brought me on as his driver. I’d been through everything. I knew what life was like before and after Earnhardt’s passing, I’ve raced against people that you’ve only dreamt of meeting. And still, he brought me in to drive alongside his kid, some snot-nosed, bright-eyed teenager that barely knew how to use a gear shift.”
Silence prevails—until the sheets rustle, and Castiel’s weight disappears. Only for a moment, just long enough for him to pull the sheets back and slide under, his weight nestling at Dean’s back. An arm wraps around his waist, pulling him close, keeping him still. Dean freezes, the urge to run flooding his veins, until Castiel sighs against his neck, warm and humid. “Cas,” Dean mutters, fighting the wobble in his lip. “Cas…”
His knees give out. Castiel grabs him under his arms and holds him up, surprisingly strong underneath all those layers. He smells of sandalwood shampoo, and lavender clings to his skin. Dean hides his face in Castiel’s neck as arms come up to surround him, holding him tight, like no man has ever done before. Women, sure—Charlie, all the time—but never another guy. Slow, his fingers trace up and down Dean’s spine, and embarrassment flushes his face. He should find a shirt, should do anything other than stand there, allowing Castiel to console him like he’s a
“Demonic high courts are notoriously under-published,” Castiel offers in condolence. He readies the molding tray and grabs a set of graphite tongs, along with a smaller clay pot. As he gathers up the material from inside, he continues, “and the angels expressly forbid humans from writing about how they handle trials. Which, in your case, would’ve been helpful.”
The Impala’s keys burn a hole in his pocket. They should get in and head back to the safe house, but Castiel refuses to walk, and Dean doesn’t want to leave his orbit even for a second. Dean opens his mouth—but Castiel speaks first, shamefaced. “I should apologize,” he mutters. “You were only doing what you thought was best, and you didn't anticipate my survival. You’re right, if it meant that you had a chance to live, I would’ve done the same thing.”
“That’s good, isn’t it?” Leaning back, Missouri folds her hands in her lap. “I know the last one gave you a lot of trouble.”
The only thing left to take from the cellar is the chest, which apparently weighs close to a hundred pounds. Somehow, Dean and Sam manage to haul it up the ladder and to solid ground, Dean doing most of the heavy lifting despite the twinge in his back. Castiel follows behind as they carry it across the yard and up the two steps to the porch. Sonia wails and claws at the screen, climbing halfway up before they can even get the door open.
“But you do.” Castiel kisses him, and Dean cries, clinging to the front of Castiel’s undershirt. He fits his hand over the brand seared into Castiel’s shoulder, digging his nails in. “You deserve to live, Dean. Not just for the world, but for yourself. Because it’s better with you in it, and I want you to see that.” A perfect mirror, Castiel cradles his scar. A spark erupts in Dean’s chest, and a bright glow lights Castiel’s eyes. “I want you to see your worth. I want you to know you’re worthy.”
“We need privacy,” Castiel says with a shrug. “I needed to create a space where you could be vulnerable. I’ve warded the room to where no one will hear us.” Closing the door, a silver light rips around the frame, sigils flaring to life on the walls, then disappearing. Dean stares in wonder, his mouth hanging open. Castiel kisses him then, capturing his attention in full. “I need you to let your guard down,” he mumbles between kisses, feeling Dean nod. “I can’t heal you if you’re tense.”
Dean holds him closer, desperate for touch, for comfort.
Another wave crests—Dean dives under and surfaces to find Castiel standing at his side. Sam brushes kelp from his hair, soaked and stuck to his face. “Warn me next time,” Sam grunts, and Dean laughs. Bright, Castiel smiles, the joy reaching his eyes.
Castiel always imagined night being full of the sounds of nature, with crickets chirping and owls hooting in the trees. Tonight, all Castiel hears is Dean’s shuddering breaths and occasional sobs. His chest heaves, and his hands shake where he holds onto Castiel’s wrist. “I don’t wanna wake up,” he says, half-muffled into the bedding. “I don’t—I’m so tired.”
“What about exorcisms?” Dean asks.
Through his blurry vision, Dean finds Castiel’s mournful stare. Anger flashes through his gut, but fades. No use getting pissed over it.
, Dean reminds himself, unfortunately.
Castiel waits until midnight to reveal his plan, dragging Dean from his mattress to a room down the hall. Blearily, Dean rubs his eyes, only to open them slowly at the sight. “Holy shit,” he whispers, turning to Castiel. “You did this?”
Sighing, Castiel pulls away from Dean entirely. In his sleep, Dean chases him, flinging an arm around Castiel’s thigh. At least he’s sleeping. After yesterday, Castiel wishes the both of them could rest, but Naomi clearly has other plans. “About what?”
,” Castiel says—but not with his mouth. Eyes wide, Dean hears him in his head, his voice reverberating through his body, in his skull. He sounds heavenly, whispering sweet nothings to his soul as his Grace seeps in deeper, to the point that Dean forgets where he is and how Castiel is holding him, their hands, their legs, everything in between.
Castiel looks down, heat building in his cheeks. Not from shame, but knowing that Dean is admiring him, his hands caressing bare skin. “I was imprisoned in my barest form,” he says, leaning in for another kiss. Dean meets him, a hint of a smile ticking his lips. “I’m sorry I didn't grab my clothes before I was flung into existence.”
, know you’ve been holding out—”
Sam, thankfully, doesn’t speak for another few minutes. Long enough for Dean to walk back inside and pour himself another cup, and Sam along with it. In silence, they sit and rock, watching the sky gradually clear and the reds of the sun fade to bright blue. Cold air seeps in, replacing humidity with a rush of winter all too early in the season. It feels normal, mundane.
. For a few brief seconds, Castiel lays in the mess of bedding, staring at the ceiling with spit drying on his skin and the ghost of Dean’s lips caressing him ever so tenderly. Brief, he reaches down to palm his length, shivering at first contact. If Dean is planning what he thinks he might be, then he doesn’t need to be dressed.
“In my defense, I didn't know she was a witch,” Sam shoots back with a laugh. “She invited me to a study group, only she didn't tell me they were studying grimoires. I’m talking dark magic, and she’s teaching us how to counteract spells.”
It could be worse. She could’ve stabbed him in the throat.
He’s beautiful—absolutely ethereal, and Castiel can’t help but love him.
In fact, Dean hears nothing other than the cicadas screeching, the first sound he’s heard in days that isn’t his own breathing. A light breeze rustles the pines, and on the far edge of the clearing, a doe stares at him, chewing intently.
And he still can’t. A second without Castiel at his side is a second wasted, even in his sleep.
Dean snorts a laugh. “No, I mean, I get it. Took a home ec class in one of my high schools, ‘cause I thought it’d be an easy way to find a date. Teacher taught us how to make aprons, and I had to come up with an excuse for why cleaning my gun hurt.”
Dean joins him in the neighboring stall, whistling under his breath while he washes his hair. Pine-scented body wash permeates the room, easing the nervousness in Castiel’s gut, even further when Dean hands him the bottle, complaining about how he smells like sweat and copper and cheap cloth seats. He finishes first, still toweling off while Castiel stands there, water beating onto his face and chest.
He leaves, the screen door slamming in his wake. Dean lets out a breath and leans over, burying his nose in Castiel’s hair. Castiel palms Dean’s thighs in return. “Hate that I’m asking it, but how do you summon a horde of demons?”
“You know we want you here too,” Sam says in consolation. Castiel wishes it helped him feel more welcome. “What’re you gonna do now?”
Fresh from the shower, Dean pulls on his shirt and a pair of stolen sweatpants and falls into bed. Valiantly, the window unit does its best to cool the room, and the mini fridge in the corner rattles, both noises Dean knows all too well. Noises that weren’t afforded to him in the last… however long it was. He should really look for a magazine. The front office probably has something. He should’ve looked for a newspaper at the gas station, but getting out of there had been top priority, along with figuring out where Castiel is.
The bottom falls out on the north side of town, bringing with it hail and gusting winds, and a horrible noise. Dean pulls off onto a dirt road and stomps on the accelerator. Mud kicks up under the tires, painting the sides of the Impala. A barn comes into view, massive and white-walled with a pitched, black-shingled roof. Slamming on the brakes, Dean sends the Impala into a skid and comes to a stop in front of the swinging doors; he rushes out into the storm and pushes them open, then hops back into the Impala, sopping wet and boots covered in dirt.
, he thinks, leaning against the bannister. Coffee doesn’t help his nerves, but it wakes him up enough to be able to see without squinting against the light.
Something wakes Castiel in the middle of the night. Dean feels the shift in the air before Castiel moves, like someone sucked the life out of the room, replacing it with an existential dread that Dean knows all too well. One eye open, Dean watches the door only a few feet away, and feels Castiel slowly crawl out of bed, his weapon already in his hand. Figures that someone would get the jump on them in their underwear.
“He’s charging me four-hundred a month,” Castiel balks, and Dean laughs. Considering the real estate market, though, it’s probably cheaper than renting. “After you graduate, do you plan on staying?”
“Did he kick you out?” Castiel asks.
“God,” she says—then crumples, and Castiel helps her upright, holding her against his chest. Weak hands grapple with his shirt as she sobs, her body wracked with tremors. She must be strong, to love Dean so deeply, to care so thoroughly, that she would let a stranger hold her and whisper prayers into her ear.
“You been crying?” Sam asks and hands Dean the starfish. Dean looks at the orange-brown mass of it and chucks it over Sam’s head, much to his disapproval. “Dude, I just found that.”
, Castiel thinks. Somewhere along the way, Dean has become less of a task and more of a
“Let’s go,” Dean says, and starts the engine.
“Alright,” Dean tells himself, gripping the wheel. With stinging eyes, he kicks open the driver’s door and steps out with all his resolve. Adrenaline spikes; his heart races, his legs sturdy despite the absolute terror searing a hole into his gut. “Dad,” he calls and rounds the Impala.
Longingly, Castiel watches the tip of Benny’s cigarette glow. “What do you plan to do after?”
“Hey.” With a look, Dean attracts Castiel’s attention, keeping his eyes on him. “I wasn’t gonna let you die there, okay? I care about your sorry ass too much to leave you.”
Dean’s nerves continue to fire even after he grabs his bag from the trunk, slinging it over his shoulder. Having Castiel at his side only helps somewhat, but this is something Castiel can’t truly help him with. For all he knows, Sam is still in Palo Alto, living it up with his friends. It’s probably just one of Bobby’s clients.
Dean rakes his nails down Castiel’s spine, heaving a long, drawn-out sigh. “Probably a lot of reasons I don’t wanna think about right now,” he says, then moans. A beautiful sound—the most beautiful, in fact, all brought by Castiel’s touch. “Cas…”
, Castiel thinks, holding Dean tighter.
“Cas,” he whispers at first. Patting his cheeks, Castiel doesn’t react—doesn’t move, either, unless Dean moves him. No breaths, no noise, just a body. “Cas, c’mon, look at me. I don’t have time.” He shakes Castiel, and his head lolls. “Cas. Cas, I know you’re in there, man. Listen to me, I’m—I need you to come back to me, okay? You can’t just spring the biggest bomb of a lifetime on me and leave without letting me say it back.” A breath; Castiel remains cold. His voice breaks, throat working around a sob. “You gotta wake up, man. I gotta tell you—I gotta say it too, you gotta know.”
If only he could sleep in the first place. “Do you ever wonder what it’s like to fly?” Dean murmurs, pulling his pillow tighter.
“I can only transport your soul in this manner,” Castiel explains. “I can’t move your body. You’ll have to find your way. Remember, call for me.”
—rustling as Dean takes them in. Four of them, solid black and
“Is she…”
“You’re naked,” Dean says.
, he thinks, his heart finally full.
Dean nods, entirely too fragile for Castiel’s liking. “G’night,” he mutters before motioning under the covers. He turns his back, facing the window, and Castiel takes the opportunity to leave, but not before palming Dean’s shoulder. The wrong one, but the only one he can reach.
I'm on
“It’s—” A laugh bubbles from Castiel’s throat, sounding all too foreign. “It’s sacrilegious, offering this to a human. But it could work, given the quantity—”
Rowena runs—or, walks briskly, really—to meet Dean. He can’t stop walking, not now—not until he gets Castiel inside. “Walk, walk,” Dean says, automatic, and Rowena follows.
Sam laughs, half-hysteric and actually amused. “Too bad,” he says, wiping his eyes. “You’re stuck here now.”
Fall comes with not so much a gradual transition, but a bone-chilling shock, the temperatures falling from the summer’s mid-nineties to the fifties over the span of a night. Relieving as it is, Dean shivers at his side, his only warm attire being a single flannel that isn’t covered in blood or viscera. Looking at him, Castiel wants to swaddle him in blankets to keep him safe from the cold.
Sam abandons his empty plate and heads for his room. Dean sets it in the sink along with his own, half-eaten but enough to get him by for a few hours. Castiel hops off his stool and walks around the end of the bar, plate in hand, and—stands there, two inches from Dean’s side, but close. Dean’s hands ache where they hang over the lip of the sink, desperate to touch, to console. But Castiel does it instead, settling his hand over the skin where once, a brand marred his skin. Then higher, fingertips tracing the feathers inked beneath his ear. Into his hair, stroking down to the base of his skull. To his cheek, where his palm comes to rest, cradling him, keeping him whole.
As Dean suspected, Castiel shakes his head. “My sole focus was investigating you, before I descended. I could look—”
He pulls up the lone chair in the room to sit at Dean’s bedside. On the other side, today, away from the heart monitor and the IV stand and whatever else the doctors have him hooked up to. None of it helps to ease the ache in his back, nor does it help him sleep when he needs it.
“The seals can only be broken if certain criteria are met,” Naomi says. “Yes, the first seal involves the death of a pure soul, but the soul has to be sacrificed first.”
Dean huffs a laugh, wiping his hands on his pants. “I gotta do it,” he decides, still not entirely convinced. “He’ll get it, but he’s gonna… He keeps holy water by the front door.”
Because he wants this—
tells him to go outside and meet his dormmates, and to cling to Dean’s side in whatever manner he can. In public, he can get away with scant touches—in private, all he wants is to draw Dean into his bed and keep him there.
Slow, Dean nods. “You know I… I ain’t turning you down, okay? I’m going, I just gotta… get shit straightened out first.”
want this, and every time Dean tries to touch Castiel’s dick over his clothes, Castiel pulls away and makes Dean come so hard he forgets about it for approximately five hours.
Dean lifts a brow. “Where’d you find that out?”
“Some.” Standing, Shiloh paces, finding a way to avoid each creaking panel in the floor. “She and daddy’re getting’ divorced. I told you about her in the paper, he found out she dated a bunch of girls in college. There’s just…” He stops. “There’s so much yelling. I want them to stop fighting, but he keeps threatening her, and I see how he acts around her now, and I’m like, what if he finds out about me?” A breath. “I ain’t even told mama. Whole reason we went to church was ‘cause he probably thought he could fix her, but there ain’t nothin’ to fix.”
Castiel stops typing. Through the sheets, Dean watches his shadow turn. “Does Denny’s count?”
dies on his lips. Tears threaten to spill, and his lip trembles. “I don’t like it, Cas.”
In the shadows of the burgeoning dawn, his eyes glow, drawing Dean’s attention. A steady light pours through his other hand, radiating into Dean’s cheek, and all at once, Dean remembers the heat at Castiel’s core, the blue-white flame that followed him when he ran his hands through it. He can’t feel it now, but looking at Castiel brings him back. Looking at Castiel makes him believe.
Above him, Castiel’s lifeless body hangs, head drooped, eyes closed. At least if he died, then he did it in peace.
Dean plops down into the opposite couch. Dust wafts up, tickling his sinuses. “I texted him yesterday and said you were awake. Haven’t really had the chance to mention anything about…” He motions to the room. “All this.”
The world doesn’t come into focus until Mrs. Moseley turns off the lights, bathing her classroom in darkness. Sitting in the closet Lyle Elementary has designated a ‘teacher’s office,’ Dean leans his head on the desk, just as exhausted as the kids outside must feel. “Does it get any easier?” he asks in a whisper, covering his head with his arms.
For now, maybe. What tomorrow brings, he doesn’t know, but for the moment, he relaxes into Castiel’s hold and takes his hand. Gratitude dies on his lips as he slips under, to the place where his dreams take hold. To the place where Castiel never lets go.
Dean reaches up and pulls Castiel’s hand away. Gingerly, not nearly as roughly as he wants to. “And you’ve got no clue, right?”
“You’re right. I could’ve stayed in Heaven, or I could’ve continued my slumber for the rest of eternity.” Castiel closes his eyes. “But knowing that you were here, and feeling the longing in your chest, I couldn’t… I could never forget you, Dean Winchester. I could never allow myself to ignore what could’ve been, not when it’s right here.” He cradles Dean’s cheek, smiling ever so softly. “What’s the point of having free will if we don’t act on it? We could lie here and ignore how we feel, or we could follow through.”
In his dreams, Castiel walks through the meadows of Heaven, bursting with wildflowers at the seams. Dean wanders with him, their shoulders brushing and their palms pressed flush. A thread of translucent blue emanates from the tips of Castiel’s fingers, winding around their wrists and leaving a mark behind, a small sigil seared into the underside of their wrists.
A creek runs through Lyle’s city center, not very wide at the banks, with water babbling over the smooth stones. Sitting along the edge, Castiel drips his toes in, relishing the cool water. Lyle apparently doesn’t have a public pool.
“It doesn’t feel like it, sometimes.” Long and low, Castiel exhales.
“Dean.” Pulling him in is easy. Dean falls into his embrace, his face tucked into Castiel’s throat. This time, he hugs Castiel in return, wringing his hands in the back of Castiel’s shirt. “I hate this for you. I truly do. And if I could have my way, I’d take you with me when I leave.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hello, Sam,” Jack says, holding up his hand. Dean refuses to lower his weapon. “We need to talk.”
“Yeah.” Dean clears his throat and covers Castiel’s hand. Just barely, a smile curls the corners of Castiel’s lips, his eyes hooded. “Didn’t figure you’d fall for someone like me.”
“I think we’re lost,” Dean admits, the first words he’s spoken in a day.
“You got me.” Dean drapes an arm around Castiel’s neck, sinking his nails into his shoulder. “
The noise Castiel makes, Dean wants to treasure forever. Husky yet hesitant, like he can’t decide whether he likes it or not. But the further Dean takes him, the rougher Castiel’s touch grows. Leaning back on one arm, Castiel holds Dean in place; in turn, Dean wraps a hand around the base of his cock, using the other to fondle his sac, the weight of it so utterly
“You,” Dean answers, his voice wobbling, pitched high. Tears spill down his face. “You.”
Sheets rustle. Dean rips away, suddenly aware of just how close they were, and sees Sam sit up over Castiel’s shoulder, stretching his arms over his head.
Which, incidentally, leaves him naked save for a towel around his waist while Castiel sits at the workbench, staring blankly across the room.
. “Not very long,” Dean says. “Just—think about it sometimes, what I’d do if I stopped racing. Can’t be an announcer, ‘cause I haven’t been around that long, and I can’t be a team owner or anything, who’s got that kinda money anymore? All I’m good at is driving.”
Dean had been so cold, so helpless. Hours since, and Castiel can’t get his face out of his mind, bruised and bloodied, so devoid of life. He slowly flexes his fingers, finding the blood dry and flaky. Too long, then. Dean might be dead, and he never got to say goodbye.
“I didn’t think you were interested,” Castiel accuses, much to Dean’s amusement. “Until now, I’ve rarely seen you outside of a relationship. With women.”
“So what kinda work are you doing?” Charlie asks, looking at him over the rim of her sunglasses. “Like, I know you’re going around interviewing a bunch of kids and stuff.”
“But I don’t have any powers,” Dean adds. “Man, that blows.”
He should be outside. Should be at the library, or patrolling the town to find whatever’s haunting them this week, but Dean can’t bring himself to move. To do anything, really, that doesn’t have to do with the man on top of him, sucking bruises across every inch of skin he can find.
“What, like you’re ace or something?” Dean sits up fully, mindful of the situation in his jeans. The friction is nice, but Castiel’s hand would be even better, if they weren’t
Hope swells. If this was a movie, a chorus would play, matching Castiel’s heart beating a breakneck rhythm against his ribs. In reality, he hears nothing other than the breeze and Dean’s breaths, his throat clicking when he swallows. “Okay,” Castiel answers. He brings their joined hands to his lips, where he presses a kiss to Dean’s knuckles. “Okay, Dean.”
Tucking his charred wings in, Castiel continues his ministrations and wonders if it’s supposed to be like this. If Dean really is special, or maybe Castiel is an imbecile for believing in the first human being he’s ever touched. The infection grows, spreading through his Grace—the spark of doubt. Something angels don’t feel, yet it roils, leaking from his eyes. Dean ceases his frantic movements and stills, dimming to barely a spark.
Castiel smiles, the barest edge of his teeth showing. “I’m sure you’re equally as handsome.”
“Likewise,” Castiel says, forced. At least he isn’t the only out-of-towner here, based in Crowley’s accent.
Not for long, if Dean has anything to do with it.
“More than you’d think,” Castiel says. He gathers up the used washrags and tosses them in the direction of his chair; some of them end up on the curb, while the rest flop onto the Impala’s hood. “How much do you think is left?”
“I shouldn't have said what I did, either.” Long and low, Castiel sighs, the only sound in the room. “It was inconsiderate. Perhaps I’d forgotten the gravity of what happened to you, but all I could think about was your career and not your health.” Castiel turns onto his side; his fingertips dance across Dean’s bicep, entirely too tender for the man that punched Luke Bringer’s lights out at Homestead over a decade ago. “I should’ve asked if you were alright.”
At the bottom of the stairs, Dean finds a short corridor and a door with bars over the window. He reaches for the knob and turns it, his heart in his throat; it gives easily, and a rush of heat greets him, smelling of copper and rot. No blood on the floor, though, just melted wax from candles long-since burned out and pooled water from a leak in the ceiling.
Dean’s heart rate spikes, but for an entirely different reason. The movies make seem so easy and happy, a flash in the pan before it’s over. But Castiel draws it out, pressing his lips to Dean’s finger, like kissing him will ease the ache in his chest. “Cas, what’re you…”
Pulling away, Dean draws his arms around his middle. “A while. Couple months, after you gave me that book I’ve been wanting for years. No one’s ever… No one’s ever been that nice to me.”
And, to his shock, Dean leans against him, lacing their fingers together. “You’re the first guy I’ve ever invited home,” he says, and—
Nodding, Castiel looks over his shoulder and motions for Dean to join them. “Where is Naomi?”
“No.” Again, Castiel touches Dean’s mouth. Dean opens for him without question, relishing the weight on his tongue as Castiel presses down. “It’s a decidedly different method of completion than using our physical bodies. With a touch, your pleasure becomes my own, and we become one.”
“Castiel is gone,” he says—and Dean’s heart stutters to a stop. “He developed a soul, and one of the conditions of the Empty is that nothing human is allowed.”
“I thought seeing some of what God created might give me clarity, but the farther I drove, the… lonelier I felt.” He looks down at the bandage wrapped around his torso. “I’ve grown so used to traveling with you, that all I could think of was if you were there with me. But every time I looked over, you weren’t there.”
“Good.” Dean presses his thumb to Castiel’s lips, only to feel him kiss it, his eyes fluttering shut. “Love you too, y’know. Probably don’t say it enough.”
Castiel shakes his head. “I don’t know. It could just be a medical miracle, or divine intervention, but… I’m glad that you’re here.”
Mary thanks her with a nod. After, Castiel sits, urging Mary to join him. Still, she remains standing, her knuckles white where she grips her dress. “He’ll be alright,” Castiel tells her, struggling to believe the words himself. “Dean is stronger than you think.”
“I can’t do this,” Dean mutters. “I can’t… I can’t, Cas. ‘Cause if whatever you say is true, then I can’t… I should be looking for him, I gotta—”
A familiar mop of red hair stands on the porch, arms folded over her burgundy dress. She looks less than pleased, even at a distance, her scowl more recognizable than her face. “Darling,” Rowena calls from halfway across the clearing. She doesn’t make an attempt to move, and Dean doesn’t blame her. “I was in the middle of my mid-afternoon bath, and you—Oh, Tweety.”
Dean keeps his hands firmly on the wheel, especially as the rain begins to come down. The further they drive, the closer they get to the outskirts of town, formerly house-lined streets replaced with barren fields and barns. “I’ve got machetes in the trunk,” he says. His knuckles blanch, and Castiel aches to touch them and ease his fear. “Do you need one, or—”
. But nothing comes, and Dean crawls into the bed, throwing the sheets over his head.
Regret, Castiel knows all too well, but never as strong as when a group of four men greet him with handshakes and shouts, and a particularly sweaty hug from a man with a full beard. Aside from his students, it’s the most interaction he’s had in days. Part of him wonders if the people here are always this friendly, or if they only tolerate him because he shares a room with Dean. Granted, anyone who can put up with Ash’s constant stream of music deserves a good hug at the end of the day.
For a moment, Castiel closes his eyes and breathes. He frees his arms from under the sheets and strokes up the inside of Dean’s thighs, over the thin fabric of his pajama pants. Heat surges; Dean bites back shame. “I think we met under strange circumstances,” Castiel muses. Leaning back on an elbow, he touches his fingers to Dean’s chin, tilting his face downward. “We kissed in front of a group of people, and you almost puked on my shoes.”
Dean nods, rubbing the back of his neck. “I might take you up on that, actually.”
In the still of the night, Castiel works, stitching together a swatch at a time until he creates a row, roughly six feet wide and a foot tall. He keeps his touch light, pins between his lips and fingers deftly pulling the fabric through while he stitches. If anyone notices, no one comes to check on him, and come morning, Castiel stows away his project for another day.
“Not as many as you’d think,” Castiel says. He wants to rub his temples. Dean turned on one lamp, but the soft, yellow light might as well be the sun in his eyes. Lifting the rag, Dean wipes his forehead; Castiel takes him by the wrist and holds him there, seeking the warmth of his touch. “Dean, I haven’t… I haven’t talked to anyone in days. Last night was the only time in two weeks that I’ve slept. I haven’t eaten, but I’m starving, and all I want to do is sleep—”
“Bobby told me you said you chewed him out,” Sam says. Apparently John Winchester Racing has a massive game of telephone going on when he’s not looking. “Just—talk to him, okay? Oh, and Bobby asked if you’re going to Vegas with us. Bus leaves at six in the morning.”
On the stage, Tammy’s guitar sits. Dean takes it and sits in her abandoned seat, tuning the pegs until he finds a tone he likes. “He’s actually decent,” Donnie mentions offhand, reaching for a bottle of vodka in the top shelf. “Only heard him play a few times, but if he made a demo tape, I bet you Nashville would answer the phone.”
“Starting to think the world wants me to bleed today,” Dean says, thumping his head against the floor. Castiel shakes his head. “Next time, someone’s gonna get me in the throat.”
Typically, Castiel would take advantage of it, but Dean doesn't allow him the chance. Instead, he pulls out and scoots down the bed, settling between Castiel’s thighs. Warm breath puffs against his cock before Dean swallows it down, the girth straining his lips so beautifully. Castiel watches him while he moves, one hand fit around the base, the other where he can’t see, but he can definitely feel. Two fingers curl upward into that same spot again, and all of Castiel’s thoughts cease, his entire existence made up of Dean’s mouth and his fingers, and the want in his gut that refuses to fade, no matter what life throws at them.
? “Tommy’s awake, so time to get up. Stretch it out, c’mon, we’ve got phonics next.”
“But you can sense them?” Dean leans up on his elbows.
“Just—stop.” Palms over his eyes, Dean leans against the Impala. “I know, man, I get it. Heaven’s a bureaucracy and you’re a pawn. Trust me, it ain’t something I haven’t heard before. But I…” Pushing away, he slams his heel into the Impala’s bumper. The clang leaves his ears ringing and an ache spreading up into his calf. “I didn’t deserve this. I didn’t deserve to die like that, and Sam tried to…”
Castiel looks up, his eyes wet. Red drips onto his bandages, to both Sam and Rowena’s interests.
Blessedly, Castiel’s classroom is empty when he arrives before eight, the halls quiet and disturbed occasionally by the muffled noise of a professor speaking through the walls. Key in hand, he unlocks the door and steps inside, leaving it ajar. The only class he has to teach this semester. His other two classes, he attends Mondays and Wednesdays, along with seminar every other Saturday morning.
Night falls, and Dean curls up on the same couch as before, a dusty pillow under his head. His stomach aches from hunger and whatever brand of torment Castiel is subjecting him to, and his stitches pull whenever he shifts. Not the worst night of his life, but it might as well be.
“Yes.” Castiel meets her, taking her hands. “Yes, he’s—Dean’s alright. He’s in surgery.”
“I know,” Dean says. “I know, and that’s what I told Sam, I—I just want you too damn much, Cas. And the fact that I can’t touch you, that I can’t do this”—he sneaks forward an inch to kiss him, fueled by adrenaline and fear—“just kills me.”
Dean could say something cheeky, just to rile him. Instead, he draws Castiel’s cock into his mouth, reveling in the hot, heavy weight. Slow, he sinks deeper and pulls back, a rhythmic motion that Castiel falls into, his hips rising up on occasion to meet Dean’s downward bob. Dean makes a show of it, purely for sport, to see how Castiel reacts.
“I’m sorry,” he whispers in consolation. No matter how many times he apologizes, Dean continues to cry, childlike, the wounds to his soul flayed bare. Castiel offers him whatever comfort he can, feeding him slivers of Grace to sate the scars. Eventually, Dean settles, and Castiel refuses to touch him again, at least for now.
Martha sputters—flounders, really, panic-stricken in the face of Castiel’s blade. “I’m only doing what I’m told,” she says—then grabs Castiel’s wrist, attempting to yank the blade out of his hands.
“You still there?” Dean asks, barely a whisper.
. This is just another way of getting it, and Castiel allows him to kiss his skin, to drink from his body like a sinner seeking Christ. Yet, his mind screams at him to stop, to drive off and never look back. There has to be another way to save Sam and stop Lilith, one Castiel can help with that doesn’t involve angelic magic. Somewhere in the back of his head, Dean can hear his father’s voice, berating him for stooping so low, for letting Sam out of his sight for so long, for clinging to a
Castiel wants to ask why. Wants to know what happened every time that Dean immediately jumped to the next warm body, but the second Dean’s lips touch his, that thought disappears entirely. He tastes like strawberry soda and kisses just as sweetly, his hand coming to cup Castiel’s nape, keeping him close. Castiel pets through Dean’s hair like he’s always wanted, the scar underneath soft and smooth. A memory from a time Dean has struggled all of his life to forget.
Morning comes much too early, dawn dyed in reds and golds through the gaps in the curtains. Given the chance, and Dean would sleep for the rest of the day, or for eternity, if it meant curing the ache in his bones, the gnawing pangs in his stomach. He’ll leave today, maybe. Sam is probably wondering what happened, and he has a seventeen hour drive ahead of him. Castiel won’t come home with him—Castiel is probably gone, and Dean fought to save him, all for nothing.
