If you have not read 'Eosophobia' before starting this, you may want to so you can understand what's going on.
The room he was lying in was cold and plain. He could feel cold sweat breaking out and slicking over that which had already dried earlier.
and you didn't do anything." His face fell. "You didn't do anything, and you knew what they were doing to me."
John frowned. “There’s a difference between practicing out of necessity and practicing out of boredom.”
"Let me go, Mikheia." Sherlock said as evenly as he could manage, taking another step towards the doors. "You know what John means to me. You
Sherlock did not say one word, his face blank and cold. John wanted to ask why, but he didn't need to. Mycroft had the good sense to remain preoccupied with his phone for a majority of the trip save for informing them that Mikheia was in surgery and then again to inquire when he could get a full report from either of them pertaining to the events of the night. John remembered answering vaguely.
He feels himself rising. Feels the darkness shrink away, fall back behind him as it recedes into itself like some whipped beast.
situated opposite a heavily decorated building that screamed expensive living, covered in cream décor and large windows. Lush green ivy and aubergine pimpernel swarmed over the gate and face of the façade, giving the apartment the atmosphere that it had weathered its existence with quiet dignity, letting itself be claimed by the flora and ignored by passer-by until its appearance and old age belied its true worth, which must be in the double-digit millions of pounds considering the area. It was inconspicuous; it didn’t draw attention to itself but stood like a wallflower among its expensive looking neighbours, camouflaged by a door the colour of night stuck between its death and dawn and the pale trimming along its simple windows.
"John?" Sherlock tossed the beam aside and it clattered beside Moran's sprawled form. He heard a rustle of movement, footsteps, and he quickly ducked the pistol whip aimed for his head. "Really?" He scoffed at the guard as he blocked the thick punch aimed for his solar plexus. "Have we been resorted to caveman-like tactics?" Sherlock leaned back to avoid the oncoming swipe to his temple and twisted his weight, sending all of his momentum into a harsh blow to the man's jaw, leaving him to collapse, out cold on the concrete. "Apologies for the indecorum." Sherlock sniffed, straightening his jacket back into place.
His blood had turned stagnant, like standing water, coagulating into a thick gruel in his arms, lungs, chest, heart, head, brain, fucking
Some days it singed; they were too close, yet not close enough. Other days it ran cool but strong, the hidden current in a river, powered by the draw of the fall.
“He said it was a place where you forgot the lightness of being,” he remembers, “where happiness evaporated like water. A place without shade, full of suffering.”
Sherlock glanced down at the board; only a few pieces remained: a king and a rook to each of them, plus Moriarty’s still-centered pawn, unmoved since the game began. He moved the rook up.
He was an idiot. An utter idiot. It hadn't occurred to him because, once again, he proved that geniuses don't pay attention to matters that held no worth to them, such as the solar system or fruitcake or a news broadcast about something trivial like a cold. It hadn't occurred to him that people would be watching the live broadcast and that maybe one of those people was John, who obviously had an interest in new strains of the common cold since he would have to treat it.
“She’s fine and I’m not sure if it was Jim or not.” Lestrade says, hands scrubbing over his face. “Can’t very well send Mycroft a photo now, can I? Neither of them knows what he looks like.”
The Johnson-Haits. Blue-bloods of the highest pedigree, distant relations to the Queen (naturally), and plagued by the personal trouble that comes with old money.  The prodigal son, riddled with drug abuse and social scandals. The daughter, high strung, cold, manipulative. The father, distant, absent. The mother, dependent. It all reeked of melodrama. It reminded him of his family.
This chapter is for the first track, "I Should Live in Salt" (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK-EF9fAHIY). The excerpt above is from an interview with The National's singer Matt Berninger, a wonderful human being and A++ lyricist. The things that voice does to you, man. The things that voice does to you.
It was an ambassador. Clearly the agency was testing how far his morals would stretch. But…it wasn't
John looked at her a moment. She cared about him, about whether he lived or died, she cared that this longing was killing him slowly, that—what had Sherlock said?—that the kindness was bleeding out of him. She cared, and he had to do this for her.
"Nico." He nodded in acknowledgment. "A pleasure. I should warn you now, this is going to be quite painful for you. Perhaps fatal. Do you have anything to say before we start?"
“If it meant finding you, being with you, I would do it.” He says slowly, carefully. “I would walk whatever distance I had to, for you.”
John’s voice comes so suddenly in the silence, that Sherlock thinks he’s imagined it. His gaze snaps up, to where John’s turned to look at him.
His recruiter had stared at him for a moment, as if she couldn't quite believe what he had said. A flash of straight, white teeth appeared from behind red lips.
Although the well had been closed,  some of the water still remained puddled, brackish and old. It was damp, widening into what had once been a small aquifer, the circumference wide enough for the two of them to stand side by side, giving them the advantage.
He climbs the stairs, a coffee in one hand and a bag of sandwiches in the other. His day hasn't properly started, as his phone hasn't rung yet with the updates he's requested Mary to send to him; briefly, he wonders if she misses John, but nothing will come close to the eclipse that Sherlock has cast over the memoriam of the good doctor.
Mikheia said nothing, letting the raging detective rid himself of the steam that had been building up inside him for three years.
“No,” Sherlock shakes his head. “No, I loved him, Mycroft. I did—I do. There will never be anyone else.”
Night in Texas is a special creature. Very different from Iowa, or anywhere else. It's big, and empty. Full of something that you don't really want to put a name to unless you're in it. The rattlers slink down to their holes. The mice come out, ears twitching for the swoosh of predators as they scurry beneath the owls, perched on cacti, waiting. Out in the hills sometimes you can hear men hunting in the scrub for wild hogs, sometimes you can hear them hunting for each other, spoiling to take what someone else's got, gainfully or no. Oil speculators and surveyors sneak out in the dead of night, trying to get a jumpstart on competition as the derricks clink and clank in and out of the earth like birds sipping for water, manned by skeleton crews to keep the black gold flowing by sun or moon.
His heel catches the edge of a puddle as he bolts through an alleyway almost a block from where he suspects the thieves are hiding. Lestrade had asked him to wait until they got a warrant but that was the beauty of vigilantes; they could circumvent the law. Not that Sherlock was looking into trading his coat for tights.
me, he wasn’t supposed to go when I needed him, I was going to come back after Bruges and he was supposed to be here waiting!”
"Told him to sod off. I felt bad about it at the time, but that's what he gets for asking me when I'm getting antiseptic poured on my back by a doctor who was having trouble with English…I feel better about it now, though."
His chin is buried in his crossed arms, leaving his dark hair to cling to his face as water streams over it. Dirt sluices off his bare feet, scrunched against the edge of the tub. His eyes are blank, a thousand miles away.
"I think I saw a small waterway; not quite a river, but it's still something. You'll have to follow it south, to the back of Baskerville research labs. It's close enough that you'd have a good enough chance of a scent overload; Baskerville probably uses it for runoff."
“I left you.” I say quietly. “I understand the consequences, I understood them when I jumped off the roof and made you watch me, and I’m sorry, John, I’m sorry for making you hurt, for making you feel less because I was trying to save your life, but I won’t apologise for the things I did to keep you here, to be talking to you know. If I hadn’t, who knows what might have happened to you? Who knows if you’d be dead, if you’d be shot again or injured or—”
John sits in his chair by the fire, reading some typically inane paperback and occasionally stopping for sips of tea as Sherlock bends over his microscope, the silence only broken by the fire popping or the turn of Sherlock adjusting the microscope.
Moran's face twisted in anger and he banged the metal cabinets, sending a hollow sound through the kitchen that sounded like a gunshot.
"Pfft, humans. Think they know everything. You can't just get rid of me, Sherlock." Jim says with a smirk. "You can't just toss some magic water at me and
Needless to say Sherlock packs up his supplies as hastily as Sherlock can with his anal-retentive nature, flies past a bewildered Molly, hurtles out of St. Bart's and hails the nearest cab.
He turns and Sherlock recognises a shade of himself in this man’s eyes; they are eyes that are watching their lives drain through the sifting, gapped fingers of fate.
“Then allow me to make myself clear,” Sherlock snarls with sudden vehemence as he rounds on her. “You are a commodity, nothing more. I only tolerate your presence because you have latched onto James like a tick, and I need his help, so I must accommodate space for you. This does not mean I want you around, nor do I crave your attempts at what you perceive to be high-class sophistry. To me, you are a body in a room sucking in air, and nothing more. Kindly, leave me alone. Go eat dinner with James.”
As Sherlock's senses begin to return to him, he feels the rough wool of Moran's jacket in his hands. Smells the aftershave, which can't stifle the tobacco must. Hears the leather of his chair breathe as he pulls Moran's weight off it. Sees his crooked smile, charming to most unless they knew of the demon pacing beneath it. He thinks of the kiss that would have been his, his and John's to share, had Moran not taken it away from him.
Their silence unbroken, they had gone to sleep. Or, rather, John had, stretching out on the seat opposite Sherlock and using his stolen jacket as a pillow. Sherlock merely switched from softly watching him to looking out of the window.
was because I thought you had one of my workbooks from our field experiment in Bonn. If I had not needed it at that precise moment, if I was not interested in that particular data, you would be gone by now. I would have come back from the labs, probably hungry – you might have saved me something like you do, or else you might be in one of your moods and demand I get it myself.”
“You’re lying.” Sherlock intones. “This girl Molly, they were best friends. Like sisters. She wouldn’t have gone off with you tonight if she didn’t trust you, and that trust came from Rachel, didn’t it?”
"I was told I am quite exceptional at drawing. Although, with this injury, maybe not so much anymore."
“What? It’s not my fault you have the IQ of an echidna—don’t feel bad, I feel like an idiot for not realising it sooner, although in your case you’ve got to have it spelled out before you have a modicum of—”
Sherlock did as he asked, shifting closer to John as if to shield him. It was the only thing he could do.
. You knew poison wouldn’t work – fine – you had to keep plausible deniability, and you nearly got yourself killed over a waste of blood and bone, a man who would no more thank you than use you as a footstool—”
!" The sheer forcefulness of Sherlock's voice stopped him. "Mary left Bruges because I told her to." Sherlock said calmly, hoping it was enough to stop him, hoping that the information was heavy enough to distract him.
He kicks the dog out of his bed and it circles itself before settling down on the floor. He hasn’t even named it yet. He wonders what John called it. He hopes it wasn’t eponymous; two Sherlocks in one flat would be a nightmare.
"You would have to pay a visit to my brother," Sherlock says tightly, "And I don't suggest or advise it."
“No, he didn’t,” John says, moving away to unbutton his shirt, opening it to smooth skin. “See? He didn’t touch me.”
John can barely keep his eyes open, his mind swimming in heavy relief and fatigue, when he hears Sherlock pad back into the kitchen, the tile scuffing against his bare feet. He feels something heavy and warm drape over him.
He doesn’t remember seeing so many stars in his life. Thousands pepper the infinite sky, passed over occasionally by wispy clouds, and he can’t help but look up into them. They’ve remained the same, more or less, for centuries, ignorant and uncaring to the bloodied, surging tide of life that looked up into them for answers. Amazing.
An hour later, Lestrade had left and they had resumed their walk back to their flat, the day as grey and mild as it had ever been.
He could do nothing but stare at this Not-John that said all the things His John wouldn't and he could feel nothing but conceited disappointment because
"Who said anything about killing you?" Sherlock asks, stepping forward out of the shadows that cling to him like the arms of a desperate lover clutching at a soldier going to war.
"Because sometimes I really don't think you understand what your actions do to people! This?" He says, holding up the phone. "That was
"And do you know how it felt when I thought I finally had control of my life and then you come back and royally fuck it all up?" Sherlock couldn't stop the destruction of the final mirror. "I thought I was the one in charge of my life, Sherlock! Not you, not Mary, not bloody sodding
Bitter thoughts begin to clog his brain, muting the sphere of logic as if it was smothered by a burlap-swathed pillow.
John felt blood rush to his ears as they reddened; still such an odd sensation, so close to a feeding.
"Tell the owner they'll have him back soon, safe and sound. Think of it as collateral." Sherlock said, tossing the pistol back at him and spurring Gladstone onwards.
He took his gloves off and washed his hands, careful not to let the feeling overcome him; water was a difficult vehicle for their kind to handle – its particles, its chemicals, all the material it absorbed as it was processed. It could be a strong conveyor, but this particular tap was manageable, ice cold and nearly clear; he’d learned long ago to compress any overwhelming reactions to his sensitive sense of touch.
“Sometimes I wish Georgiy had never pulled me out of that river.” John admits quietly. “I wish you hadn’t saved my life.”
He reeled back, nearly collapsing into John, who barreled forward, heedless of the eyes. But they did not turn to him, did not look away from Sherlock, and he felt something within him begin to shift, to crumble, threatening to erode into total collapse.
“No, sir.” Mikheia says calmly, with a blank look on his face John has seen once before, in a madman’s eyes underneath fluorescent lights when the air was saturated with chlorine.
She knew how emotions ought to be dealt with. She knew how to counteract them, how to balance them, how to use them.
"No!" Jon shouted suddenly and Sherlock paused. "No, just…stay. Please." God, the way John looked up at him might make a religious man out of him yet. "I can't —if…you can't go again."
Silently, he stalked over to the main switchboard, punched the buttons, and watched as Sherlock came to stand in the middle of the empty room as the machines began to bang and churn around him in a billowing plume of noise and dust. He looked like a mad scientist among his metal prodigies.
"And here, it is the Novgorod Kremlin. Sort of like our watchtower or soldier barracks or fort or what have you…"
John could only listen as the footsteps faded away, impotent rage and helplessness washing through him, buffering him into blackness, the hollow call of silence, the nothing that lay behind the veil…
Funny, really, how once he disengages the emergency brake it only takes one large push before the car begins to roll down the ramp, headed directly towards Moran as it picks up speed.
Sherlock halts the beginning of a rude retort—the essentials of which were telling her to shove off—as realization sets in.
He blinked, and shoved away from the bond, surfacing out of the warm current between them and into the cold, airy isolation of his own mind. Sherlock was speaking to him, but he could not – would not – listen, and he walked past him towards the open window.
Mycroft shuts his eyes. He had been warned of such activities, but there’s a distance about being told of destruction that seems so small upon seeing it first-hand.
“That’s circular reasoning, love. You hate that.” John’s hand moved to stroke his forehead, and he began thinking of the feel of sunshine, a warm wind, the songs of birds, laughter.
"So simple, human touch…skin." Sherlock muttered. "Yet it is capable of so many things. Expansion, retraction, burning, healing, scarring, horripilation, blistering…"
“Sherlock—” Mycroft begins in warning, because this will go nowhere good if he continues, but his brother continues on, undeterred.
Battalion of the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers, had been recorded as a member of the liberating Allied forces at Dachau. When he’d arrived at the field camp near Bergkirchen, he was led to a large bonfire the troops had built in celebration, feeding the flames with swastika flags, fleeing officer’s uniforms, broken furniture from the camp. He had looked across the fire, large and high, right into John’s dark eyes, looking for all the world as if he’d been waiting for him.
He ducked back into the crowd, just barely catching that head of dark curls, that blue scarf, and that pale skin before the man they belonged to rounded a corner.
He was strapped naked to some sort of gurney, which sounded foreboding at first, but when you've been strapped to a cold plate of metal for three hours you tend to become more annoyed and uncomfortable than frightened. The room was empty when he woke, and so it remained until he heard the door open and shut.
"No time for the quality stuff, I'm afraid." John said, pulling a rag from the steaming water to wipe away the streaks of blood covering the wound. "His aim wasn't as neat as it could've been. He missed the jugular, but there's still a fair bit of damage. I'm assuming you must have struggled. He nearly punctured your esophagus..."
He turned the tap off. Heat steamed through the pristinely clean room. The cleanliness of it all made his head hurt.
"It's alright." John murmurs, a slow smile coming to his face. "It's alright. You don't have to be sure all the time. It means you're human."
John considered the request carefully – what might mark this occasion, the most important night, perhaps, in modern history? What they might do, what might go wrong, what might go right, the reverberations felt throughout time…
The vaulted wooden ceiling. The lone spherical shelled light. The plain white walls. The plain, modest bed covered with a soft, welcoming duvet. Modern, but comfortable. It was more accommodating than he had expected.
"Hello, sir." It was the young woman from the front desk. There was something off about her voice, it was too monotonous, too…detached. "If you are at leisure, could you please come downstairs, please? There is a—um—a parcel waiting for you."
He grips his ake-shift mace in his hands, called to him from where it lay on his desk at the flat, the same pipe that he'd grabbed in that dirty alley the night he fought Gladstone, and rises to his full height.
John sits, opening his bag and drawing out a plain folder. He swallows roughly before he opens it, settling back in his chair.
He reaches the platform, stopping in front of their bed. All the windows in the room have been opened, letting in the warm air and outer sounds of foot traffic and cars passing by. Sherlock is sitting at the desk wedged in the corner, naked on the green velvet chair, and hunched over as he stares into one of the mirrors he’s perched on the surface.
As Billy fed, John hobbled towards him. Sherlock could still make out the headlights of his car in the darkened distance; it had been a lifetime since they’d found it, since they’d argued behind the bar, since his biggest problem was Harry knicking blood.
"Did you…were you romantically related?" John said, feeling his face flush although he knew it didn't matter.
John pushed his sleeve farther up to avoid the water and it was then that Sherlock noticed the faint rash on John's arm. It was then that Sherlock began to piece it all together. The significant change in his personality, the maladjusted behaviour, the constriction of the pupils…
“Yeah, well, he wasn’t you, was he?” John snaps and Sherlock falls silent. “I thought…I thought he’d murdered you. You know I never believed in your fake suicide, well, I mean, I did, but not that it was a suicide. I knew that somehow Moriarty had made you jump. I knew it in…I don’t know, in my gut. Moran was the only thing I could get revenge on for what they’d done to you and I guess by default what they did to me.”
He hadn't ever thought of getting married, of being someone's other half, of belonging. That notion had bled out of him long before his sire had found him in the desert, struck through outside Damascus by a rogue mamluk with a rusty spear and a cornered desire to survive, and left to the sun or the thirst or the blood loss—whichever took him first. He'd fell apart from his body, had already come to terms with his own mortality, when the shadow fell across him, and his life—and his death—became tangled together.
After an hour's search, Sherlock found John in an empty men's room, which was normal enough; he believed it was the one he had passed on the way in to meet Mary. It was best that John didn't know, at least not until he could explain it all—
The city had overrun by foreign officers for weeks, scores of Englishmen drunk and stumbling through the streets, chasing women, packing dens and basements and filling the air with poppy smoke. Junks floated in the harbor, their owners shouting at each other to make way, some already anchored at the docks, crews perched on the lips of their vessels, soaking their feet in the water, stacking sugar funnels under the scalloped wicker awnings, ferry owners pouring each other a drink after a hot day.
." Sherlock said calmly, all his anger having been channelled through his destruction of the instrument. Mikheia continued.
Sherlock eyes the still healing scar across the velvety fur of John’s right coracoid, just above where it juts from his shoulder blade. A few more days—perhaps even hours—and it will be as if John didn’t almost die fighting for him.
Mycroft's home was certainly nice enough, but it was the emptiness of it that got to him. It was the lack of John, the non-Johness of it all that sent his head loose with wild ideas and theories that only suited facts to theories and not theories to facts.
She sighed, willing her shoulders not to droop so low, to keep some of her dignity intact. That voice did something to her, made her feel as if she had to listen, and if she were honest, she wanted to. The allure, the mystery; it was hard to say no to someone like him. Underneath the mask, she could tell he was handsome and, well, if she was going to be alone for the rest of the night anyways, company was always nice.
“Because he didn’t give us any relevant information, other than the wonderful fact that he’s now suddenly a cuckold; forgive me if I don’t reach for my tissue—”
The Biblioteca Marciana had stood already for more than three centuries, its horned, whitewashed crown of statues peeking over the horizon at a distance.
A month in, he had nearly been hit by a car as he crossed the street before it swerved and avoided him. He found himself wishing that it hadn't.
It's mundane and ordinary as anything. He decides that he quite likes this. The soft calm night feels like a balm to his soul.
Hopefully, this answers the question of where exactly Mikheia ran off to after John chased him through the factory.
“You are my only friend, John. You are the best by default. You are also my boyfriend, loathe I am to use the term, and my flatmate and my—”
"Perhaps one day." He says tonelessly, leaving the odd doctor, and rounds the corner, Lestrade hurriedly catching up to him.
"Yes, I'll send someone. Head to the south gate. A car will be waiting. Can you find your way there?"
Sherlock stared up at him, his cheeks flushed. John liked seeing colour on his face. It was a nice change, one where he could see it rise to Sherlock's cheeks instead of seeing it spill freely over them, unleashed past split skin like at St. Bart's.
He'd been on plenty of foot chases before, both with Sherlock and without, but this one, this one burned with the clearest purpose.
Kita Seong-Eun, the daughter of a Korean mother and Japanese father, was the second woman to beat him; she had the grace to call it a draw and spare his pride, what little he might still have. She was merely next in line to step up to where he knelt—because who can stand after a fall like that?—and neatly chipped a piece of him up, made him heavier, not lighter, forced him closer to the floor. She had loomed over him with The Woman’s shadow. She had Sherlock Holmes at her mercy, and she had the power to afford to leave him alive.
"I know how it feels." John said sympathetically. "It's just as it was when it first happened, isn't it? It feels just as real, even when you know it's not. Even when you're awake. But you feel the pain and you wish you weren't awake, you wish you were somewhere else..."
"Christ." Lestrade murmurs, running a hand through his hair. "I'll let the fact that you took evidence pass if you tell me what the other substance was."
"I suspect that, yes. It's extremely corrosive—the knowledge of which you've just demonstrated by inquiring about the safety of our cabinets—which would correlate with the deep burn that appeared in her palm."
“For what it mattered it was. I’d been waiting for that moment. I knew it. I knew it was going to happen. I knew you were going to die because of me.” He buries his head in his hands, curls inking against his skin. “Ever since Bart’s. I knew it. I knew it.”
He reached out over the bond, not to touch but to see. Grazing against it, John bristled like a cat, but didn't shrink away.
Sherlock places a hand on the wall, effectively trapping John between himself and the wall. John looks up at him.
John tilted his head up softly and let his mouth graze over Sherlock's. It could hardly be called a kiss, but it was so much more than a show of mere affection.
“No,” John shakes his head, “it wouldn’t look good on his record and his parents would raise hell, probably claim self-defense. Listen, Molly,” he continues, sobering a little, “Sherlock—Mr. Holmes—he said you were there with a biker. I don’t remember much but, if I have it right, that biker was Billy Wiggins, wasn’t it?”
“The fire time I saw you was on top of that horse.” He began. “Do you remember? You looked wonderful, John, like you’d been riding for centuries…I suppose by then you had been. I watched you drink from the stag, and I knew, I was sure that I had been waiting for you. I asked you, do hare hunters have names, and you laughed, and I wanted to keep making you laugh forever. And I promised you forever, John, and you said I can never say that word because it means too much, but here I am anyways, saying it, and you aren’t stopping me. So, forever, for however long that actually is…yes…forever…”
"Hello boys," Mary smiled. "Your tickets out." She said, handing one to Mikheia. "Once you arrive in Leipzig I've asked my sister to pick you up. You can trust her. Just to be sure, ask her what flavour ice cream I like best. The answer's Neapolitan."
John groaned. "Of course." He ran a hand blearily through his hair, messing it up further. "Mycroft was the one that put me in the Kremlin?"
Quiet footsteps, echoing in the dark room. The scrape of a chair on concrete as Sherlock sits across from Moran. His gaze shows no pity, no anger, no disgust, nothing. He stares at him, assessing him over steepled fingers, and Moran stares back.
Moran can wait. Everything can wait. He has to know that John is alive, has to know that he's alright so this shallow pounding in his mind and the wrenches in the depths of his heart can cease, but—
The man responds by tossing a water bottle in John’s direction, striking him roughly on the chest before it rolls into his lap. He closes his knees around it to stop it from tumbling to the floor.
“Oh, don’t be dramatic now. I’m just teasing about the writing, you know. How is it in beautiful Kennedy, Washington?”
send yourself there. We wouldn’t be together; that would be like trying to find each other in the dark with miles of emptiness full of danger in between. You won’t know if your next step is your last.”
"Oh, I'm betting the writer did a quick search on alchemy and decided it sounded best." Sherlock replies. "Journalism tends to fret more about how appealing it is than how informative."
It should scare him, knowing that John can destroy him entirely if he had a mind to. John can smite him where he stands and Sherlock would be alright, but he would be
Georgiy settles back in his chair and drains his glass in one go, but refuses a refill from Mikheia. He and John, already light-headed and fuzzy, deign to do the same, both out of politeness and necessity. They had to be clear-headed tonight if they wanted to live to see the morning.
He stands. For a moment, the light catches his back and Mycroft almost believes that he sees sunlight glancing off smooth dark feathers like polished wood. But the bookshelf is behind him and clearly it was what caught his eye.
An officer approached them from behind the boy. John took one glance and shot him cleanly in the hollow of his throat. Mikheia looked with wide eyes at the body, registered the feathered tail of a tranquiliser, and relaxed.
You woke up. You looked into his eyes. You kissed him and he let you in. You both know what that means to him. You both know that this man almost took you away from him and his wrath would have been of Biblical proportions, an angry and vengeful god set on destruction. You have to stop the grey, erase it, purge it, keep it from hurting him ever again.
She stands loudly, striding out of the dining room and leaving the faceless little lackey to clean up her mess.
“Sherlock said you study angels for a living. I could smite you right here, so stop being such a tosser and you’ll not be a pile of ash by the end of the day.”
Why was he being so hostile about something so trivial? It was about John. John was never trivial. This was poking at a wound still bruised, purple and yellow and not healing, not even close to healing.
"A bit." John managed to bite out through gritted teeth. "If you're going to kill me, just do it quickly."
He still worked out of 221b Baker Street, despite the shadows that clung to it. There were rules however. There were places he would not and could not go.
of self-control? John Watson is the type to hit people that offend him, to wear his heart on his sleeve, and you seem to think that in his absence I will adopt some of his characteristics. You are most indubitably wrong. John Watson is an inimitable man, and I can assure you that all of his mannerisms will remain so. You also stated that I needed to 'think of John', as if it's not occurred to you that I have done nothing else for the past few hours, let alone every moment I can spare since I've met him. Do you really think that I would be so careless that I would risk John's safety? That I would let some rat like
"Right, of course." Sherlock took another drag, if only because he didn't know what else he should say. What else he
And with that, he dropped down into the black, the wind rushing past his ears. For a brief moment, he couldn't tell if he was flying or falling, and then the ground came up to meet him. John's descent was much more cautious. Ever the soldier, he had free rappelled down the side, landing in a fighting stance.
John had sighed in utter contentment, but dried wind swept it away as Sherlock plummeted into a hollow, dry pit that undulated with darkness. Sherlock could taste the bitterness of blackberries bursting in his mouth, even though nothing sat on his tongue. Like clots of coagulating blood sitting in his mouth that he couldn't spit out. He took a deep breath and recoiled. Chlorine. That dizzyingly sharp, stinging, clear scent that was so like Moriarty's cologne to him.
“Now? We wait. Wait, and hope we can do something that will change his mind. Maybe find out more about this Sam Johnson-Hait, follow up on him once the family has been contacted.”
“Who is he?” John asks, grimacing in pain as he moves to sit up against the hay, the bandages tight around his ribs.
Finally, after more than a thousand days, he saw John Watson once more, long enough to last him a thousand lifetimes, and he was worried that it would be the last time.
"I couldn't even endure the thought for two seconds." He muttered, dragging his arm away and looking over at John with a troubled expression. "How? How could you do it for three years?"
"My family owns a manor house. We have one butler, Stanley. He's quite old and we keep him more out of fondness than necessity; I doubt he can carry a tray of china without hurting himself. My childhood and teenage years were spent annoying my schoolmates and exasperating my parents, much like any adolescent who asks too many questions. And no, I was not carried about on a throne by four servants to public school."
and I’m alone with a wet shirt and wounded pride. He reappears shortly and shoves a tea towel into my hands before sitting next to me on the floor. “I should get you a kid’s cup next time. You’ll spill less.”
"I've got Molly's report on the ash you found on Jane's hand." Lestrade says, flipping through the open file in his hand. "We couldn't find a match, obviously, but someone did report a missing urn from a home break-in recently. We think they might be connected, and I've had the new DC follow up on it."
Hands rolling over soft plains, feeling humming skin and damp shoulders. John closed his mouth around one, feeling not only the bone and sharpness but the softness between the two. Sherlock made a strangled sound and insistently tugged his head away to meet his mouth once more and John allowed him a few deep kisses that tasted of a glowing fire late at night, when people slept but others stayed up to watch the flames die.
Sherlock darted through the crowd, reaching a hand out to grab it by the scruff, to incapacitate, to shake out the spine of the monster, when it turned. Behind the plain white mask, the single black teardrop, the eyes were red, glowing, as if staring at the sun through closed eyelids, as if staring at the sun, the sun, burning—
He reminded himself of this fact, however cold it was, as he stepped into the post office, overheated from the packed bodies inside. He waited patiently until it was his turn to step up to the counter and give his name – another false one, like the scores of them before.
“I’m sorry.” Sherlock whispers and it sounds like it’s echoing across a chasm, a void of emptiness that he wishes wasn’t so great and unreachable.
“I’ve been too careful with you.” John continued. “I haven’t treated you as if I trust you. What happened to you, to us, I haven’t been able to get past.”
"You're here, wonderful." Lestrade says, dropping a leaf of papers back onto the gilded coffee table, and Sherlock is unsurprised to see the large tomes underneath that were so common with a vapid high-class culture pretending to be sophisticated. Other than the mess his team was currently making, the flat looked as untouched as the lunch room of a modelling agency. Too untouched for someone to live there…
He shuts his eyes, letting the cart rock him side to side. He should bandage his wound, he knows, but the adrenaline crash is sending him spiralling into exhaustion. The faint fire of the barn flickers behind his eyelids as it fades in the distance.
The voice comes from somewhere away from him, and there’s a great clutter of sound on the far end of the room as new logs are added to the fire.
When he woke, he found himself in that same modestly accommodating hotel room overlooking the Reie River that wove through Bruges like a swirling artery.
death even if it was solely for your pleasure." John shrugged. "Thus, you were lying." He looked over at Sherlock, expecting to see a proud grin at his deduction, but instead Sherlock had thrown a pale arm over his eyes. "Sherlock? Are you alright?"
A wolf rushes at him and he brings the mace up forecefully, hearing the crack as it connects with the wolf's snout. He burns with power, and feels it pulse down his arm as he wraps it around and through the pipe, sending a sound like thunder across the plain as he buries it in the wolf's neck. It has barely time to whimper before it bursts in a spray of blood and charred chunks of spongy flesh.
"How much time have you got?" He asks and she laughs. "Some days I really question that myself, but I suppose it's because—"
"You haven't seen my camouflage skills, have you?" Sherlock replied, taping the gauze around John's arm. "I've gotten quite good over the years. They're more than proficient—"
John paused; Sherlock knew he and Moriarty had faced off in Moscow, but he wasn’t aware of the details. John himself wasn’t entirely sure of what had happened – he knew whatever Moriarty had done involved his training with the Khylsts, but he’d had to make his escape before his research had been complete, and so he was left with best guesses and suspicions.
“Right.” Lestrade says finally. “So you’ve got an angel in your flat. Anything else I should know about? Hm? Vampire upstairs? Jesus Christ in the pantry? Frankenstein’s Monster in the shower?”
No, he's much younger, much more gaunt, and his clothes scream of high fashion masquerading as thrift.
Who was he kidding? He'd been proven to be nothing else countless times before this. He held his head so loftily, looked down on everyone around him, yet judging by the way he felt like he was trapped in an ice floe, cold and numb as his shocked mind allowed raw, chilly fear to pulse through him, freezing him from the inside out, he was no different from them.
“I…I don’t know if I hope he has or if he’s done it already. He knows my time here is limited, but I don’t think he understands. He likes to believe he doesn’t know better about things he cares about. I think his brain’s just waiting for his heart to catch up.” John lets a small knowing smile flicker on his lips. “Humans do tend to be the most careless with the most delicate things. I think he thinks I’ll be around for the rest of his life.”
This chapter marks the beginning of an nonlinear narrative, so buckle in, we're going on a weird ride. I'll try to make it clear what happens when in coming chapters.  Apologies for the wait.
“Ah, not true. When I lived alone I cleaned my equipment, or at least those that were left after the inevitable explosions.”
"Yes you did." Sherlock said, speaking finally. Mikheia and John looked to him. "And you should listen to what I am about to say because I will once say this once for however long we may know each other. You are a good man, Mikheia. You did Darwin a great service when you weeded that primeval lout from the garden."
There’s a pause, as if Lestrade doesn’t want to answer. Sherlock hesitates at the front door as the ground trembles underneath him, as if it’s about to crack and split and consume him.
Sherlock really did feel like he was moulting, he was shedding his skin like some primordial snake peeling off its old skin that it had once thought fit so snugly but now realised it was constricting; it was suffocating him slowly and he hadn't even noticed until sweet air breathed over fresh skin. He hadn't cared. Not until now. Not until John had reached his hand out and begun to pick it off. How could he ever go back? He couldn't. Didn't want to. Not now. Not ever.
"I have to inform you every time I leave a room where I'm going? I didn't know you expected that of me John and I'll try to amend it, but you have to tell me these things you know, I'm not a mind-reader although telepathy has been a long-standing interest of mine—"
after all, his partner, his best friend, the man he loves with every cell in his body, but he’d be lying to himself if what had happened hadn’t unsettled him.  He’d be lying if he thought he was completely safe, if he didn’t expect Sherlock to attack him again. He’d be on his guard, or at least as best as he could in his condition.
. Just him. Always him. Believed in his inherent goodness, in his bravery, his loyalty, the fact that he held a gun as easily as a butter knife smeared in jam or a shampoo bottle if it meant protecting someone. Sherlock had never felt protected until his army doctor, always on his own, always relying on himself since Mycroft had grown into adolescence and found greater and better endeavours than coddling his younger brother.
“Alright, mate, honestly, listen, that thing isn’t going to get you anywhere, you can’t get a good swing in or I’m going to shoot you in the kneecaps or maybe your head if you’re lucky, and then Watson here will have to take your body back to your mum if he’s lucky and explain how you gave your life away like a right cunt, for no reason. So just do us a favour, yeah, and toss that thing away. It won’t do you any good.”
“Not asking you,” John rasps, “I’m telling you. Just this once. For you. Can't be your end, Sh'lck.”
“See, that’s what I thought, when you left. When I was alone. I thought I’d never get past the emptiness of not having you in my life. Turns out, a few bullets solved that problem nicely.”
"Of course." Sherlock says with a flash of a smile meant to be understanding. It falls off his face the moment the manager looks away.
He walks back to John, snow crunching under his boots as he treads a path untrodden. He stops in front of him, tugging a glove off with his teeth and revealing white skin that reddens in the cold. He takes John’s bare hand in his, both chafing in the wind.
Sherlock didn’t think – he reacted, snatching one of the knives on the counter from its holder, appearing behind the couch in the next instant, burying it to the hilt at the hollow of Billy’s neck as the new vampire pawed weakly at his arm. It wouldn’t kill him outright, but the silver would poison him slowly, keep him immobile. He snatched the gun from his hand and tossed it down the hall, though it was useless now.
"Do you know what keeps your organs in place, John?" He asks in the quite noise of the forensic team's investigation.
They sit across from each other in the dining chairs they dragged before the fire, alone in a house with a penchant for quiet. It’s almost midnight. The fog is creeping towards the house, the warm fire not strong enough to ward it away. In the back of the yard, the barn glows with a soft light, mingling with the shadows inside.
Sherlock wanted to roll his eyes and spout theories on just how inbred this man's family must be, or otherwise how uneducated, but if anything that would hinder him rather than help—
Sherlock looked over at him, meeting his curious glance. He wasn’t worried that he had offended him – he was concerned that he had been incorrect. John was proud of his instincts, and he didn’t want them to be wrong.
"Did you really live in a palace with a hundred servants?" John asks as he manoeuvres around Sherlock to put the tea mugs away, tugging Sherlock back into the present from whatever cloud of thought he'd been caught in.
"We have a lot to talk about John. A lot of things to tell you that we couldn't before. That I couldn't."
Moran looked up as the doors opened. "Wonderful, back-up has arrived." He said and John followed his gaze to the two men entering the room, one lightly tanned and blonde, the other bald and dark skinned. "Took you long enough." Moran sneered then turned back to John. "These two are Asad and Isaacs. Been working with them since before Sherlock's fall at St. Bart's. Some of the best of the best, as far as assassins go. The agency's been after them for a while you know—"
Their things are packed by the door, ready for the flight home tomorrow. Together. Rain was predicted for London, so he’d left out their coats. Couldn’t go home unprepared.
He kisses him, and they eat dinner together in bed as they watch night fall. Sherlock sets aside their plates and takes his hand, settling against the duvet as the dark deepens.
“Sherlock.” John is at his side, a hand on his shoulder. “He’s not your brother, Sherlock. He never existed. He’s a demon from Sheol; he disguised himself and killed the other tenants. He planted a false memory on you. Sherlock? Do you hear me?”
Moriarty rolled his eyes. “A dog will answer to anything. I suppose he heard his master calling and came to heel.”
Now newly alone, Sherlock turns his attention to the key in his hand. A deposit box, Mycroft had said. Even if any bank was open, he'd have to produce a court order to retrieve it. Or he could otherwise influence whatever mindless teller worked at the desk. He'd keep his options open.
Moran stepped forward out of the darkness from across the room, hands in his pockets, shadows still clinging to him as if trying to drag him back.
The fountains tinkle in the distance. He hadn’t noticed them before, when he’d made his mad dash here, through the night and silence. His mind had been elsewhere. Funny how that happened. The man whose job it was to notice things hadn’t seen the defining feature of London’s most famous garden. What else had he missed?
"Well, that's lovely and all," John says as he interrupts the stilted atmosphere. "But there's still the question of
John sends him a picture of a shirt crumpled onto the floor of Sherlock's bedroom, along with the text:
, so I can better protect you from him, and to be frank it makes me sick to even think of him; I do not relish his attention or his conversation. Now, do I have your attention?”
John nodded, chuckling at the truth of it, however depressing or optimistic it was. “I suppose it is.”
He opened his eyes to survey the damage; John’s neck was clean, but he could see traces of bite marks, punctured skin, the deeper, bleached purple pallor of the dead. He’d want to eat when he got up, but Sherlock couldn’t be arsed at the moment to detach himself. Neither of them gave off body heat, but despite that there was a certain comfort in the two of them in bed, as if the memory of warmth lingered just by being together.
“Sorry, sir,” The officer says, and Lestrade looks back to them. “But are we expecting Holmes? Should I put him and Watson on the log?”
Sherlock toys with the ring. The meaning of the symbol embossing the stone still eluded him, but he had yet to exhaust either the public library or the internet in search of it.
It had been the first contact with Mycroft he’d had in that new century. The false papers he’d gotten easily enough on his own, but he’d needed a position as far away from bureaucracy as possible, and Mycroft had been too happy to help, in exchange for occasional intelligence from the front; John knew he was indispensable, if not for the information he offered than for his importance to Sherlock, and he wasn’t afraid to use that fact as leverage to swing himself as close to the war as he could get.
The boy stared at him again. John had the odd feeling that he knew everything about him. It made his spine squirm.
? He’s turned himself in to the Yard, he’s killed two people who are seemingly unrelated and who have no value to him, to what end? To send a message?”
John has a date tonight. With that stupidly common DC from the crime scene. Emma Bird. Typical name. Fitting. Dull. Ordinary.
“No,” he said, because it was true – Harry had been abhorrent in Paris, lost to blood haze, wicked, immature, “but that was almost a century ago.”
"I wouldn't know. We're not together." John answers, his voice suddenly a little too civil. "But you might want to leave before he gets any worse and you're not doing yourself any favours as it is."
“Having something good in your life. When you close your eyes and open them again and it’s still there. What’s it like?”
“I don’t know what I would or wouldn’t have done until the last moment before I did it.” John answered, because it was true. Only when he was forced to make his choice would he have been certain which one it was.
Sherlock returns his gaze back to the screen, fingers steepled at his nose. “How many times did he tell you to fuck off before you actually did?”
.” Sherlock scrambles to his feet and advances angrily. “What spectacular idiocy prompted you to think it was just a
He felt like he was about to get sick at any moment, like someone had punched him in the stomach, like some unknown force had shoved its hand down his throat and it was choking him with darkness, with an inky heaviness, and he was dry heaving shadows.
that he’d been turned into. Not that he was a leader, exactly—he didn’t have the fortitude for that—but he was no follower. He didn’t want to answer to anyone, didn’t want rules to keep him under someone’s thumb, and he wanted to do what he wanted, when he wanted.
Sherlock awoke to the sound of a loud knock at the door. He could hear the heartbeat of the man on the other side. From the way blood was rushing through the arteries, he had a good five years left before the hypertension claimed him.
"Feeling a bit peaky, are we?" John asks calmly with a raise of his eyebrows and Sherlock grabs the nearest thing he can find and tosses it at his annoyingly stupid face.
“Promptness is a virtue, brother mine.” Mycroft says in the distance, standing in an illuminated ring before a chair.
A figure began to approach him through the darkness, their footsteps echoing on the tiles, but stopped.
“Zygomatic fracture.” Sherlock growls. “You should feel lucky I felt lenient today. Be comforted by the fact that you have a reprieve today, for once I find him, I will do to you tenfold of what you’ve done to John Watson.”
He looks to Sherlock, who he half expected to treat the information as a joke, a prank of some punk kid maybe, but he had gone still, a stern and pensive look on his face.
He stops outside his window. From the light of his room, he makes out a message seemingly burned into the dirt:
A "click" determines how far you move the sight adjustments of the rifle according to the distance of the target per 100 yards. "One click" will change the point of impact one inch for a target 100 yards away.
He comes in a few minutes later, or at least appears in the doorway. I can see his bandaged hand, stained in spots with red. Smashed plates will do that.
Happy Holidays and a fantastic New Year to everyone! Apologies for the chapter gap, as I was studying abroad and had absolutely no time for anything outside of the library, but I'm back now!
He looked down at John, John who trusted him, John who loved him, and felt as if he had failed, but at what he wasn’t quite sure. Their relationship had been a string of failures of late, ever since Norway, maybe even before that, and a century had not been long enough to set them back on course. Perhaps this was it then: perhaps they were travelling into deeper waters, diverting with the currents that pulled them apart.
The toilet flushed from behind them and it snapped them out of their reverie. Sherlock moved faster than Mikheia had ever seen him, even on then night John had collapsed into a bloody mess in the foyer (was that really only yesterday?), snatching up all four corners of the sheets and balling them up in arms. No sooner had he gathered them up then the door to the bathroom creaked weakly open and John staggered out, stiff with soreness and sleep and pain, dressed in crisp trousers that obviously were not his. This was due in part to Mikheia and Sherlock's shameless dig through Mycroft's clothes while John had been unconscious and their acquiring of some acceptable trousers and a few shirts. John had been too uncomfortable putting on a shirt with his fresh wounds, but he had happily accepted the trousers, muttering something about how at least they weren't women's slacks.
Moran tuts and rolls his eyes. “So fucking noble, aren’t you? Can’t just shoot me here, like a dog in the street? You’ve got to be
!" He burst out then added, softer, "You mean more to me than anything. You're like the bloody earth or some ridiculous, unrealistic simile—but it's true because you're so alive and warm, and I'm just a cold uninhabitable moon circling around you and some days I really don't know what you see in me, but I certainly know what I see in you. You are…everything." Sherlock threw his hands out. "Everything." He said, if only because he didn't have anything else to add.
It’s the most honest thing Sherlock’s seen since John’s fall. The ungilded perseverance through the muck. Once they’d been clean, shining and new, and they are not so now, but still they stand, unclean and unapologetic. Perhaps he was putting too much meaning on a forgotten monument. Perhaps there was a reason he’d never seen it until now.
But he could think of it all he wanted later, perhaps while snogging John some more, for science...and perhaps for himself. Okay, maybe more for himself—
A curse from inside. The oil lamp dimmed, and the house took on a synthetic silence, as if someone were afraid to move.
"I can handle myself." John said, raising his chin to stare at his mate, the two of them locked in a silent battle.
"No, no, he's at the hospital in Aspen. The father, he played possum and attacked when Dick tried to help him. Dick's fine, nothing too serious, but shaken, for obvious reasons. I don't think he'd be up to questioning."
It raises its great head, torn and pocket-marked ears twitching at the sound of his voice, and it turns to him with black eyes void of colour save for the twin miniatures of Sherlock that it reflects. Water pours from its mangled neck into the tangled dread-like fur of its chest as it rears onto its hind legs, which tremble under the strain.
“Whose body? It wasn’t John’s.” The last part comes out more as a query. “John…John died in that hospital. You gave me someone else’s ashes and told me they were his. I have every right to my suspicions on who is or is not dead. Whose body?”
“How, exactly, is being found unresponsive in the snow outside of the Bolshoi handling yourself? What if he comes back?”
Moran rounded the corner to the stairs just as Sherlock reached the bottom and rushed forward, grabbing the closest thing he could find and slamming a shattered beam of wood into his face, sending Moran to the ground in a blur of splintered wood and gushing blood.
“Who’s the one who insists on proof and facts before conclusions?” John countered, going over to his cabinet and unlocking it, pulling out the velvet box.  “I’m not saying it’s baseless, Sherlock, but you’re going to have to give me more than your word.”
“This is Venice—everything has been built upon. And this place it is always sinking. But sometimes that is what we want."
"Oi," he protested, rolling over to face him. "I'm sorry you're saddled with such a dullard," he teased, "But I'm not completely empty up here, thanks."
Sherlock is quiet for a moment, letting Gladstone lick jam off his hanging fingers. “You’re an expert on angels, are you not?”
He spends the cab ride in an unsettled anxiety, drumming his fingers on his knee, silently wishing that desire was a convertible form of energy that could spur the car to go faster. He watches the buildings go by but doesn't see them, his mind on that picture John sent him. That little crumpled t-shirt that conveys so much. Consensual affection and desire. It was too good to be true. He pulls it up again and stares at it until the cab pulls up to the flat. He hurriedly tosses the fare at the cabbie, adding a tip for his more than probable mental nervousness at the fact that he might be carrying a fugitive.
“Or Scotland. We could go back to your home. I’m sure no one would remember you. It’s been…what, seven hundred years or so.”
“Ever the model of propriety, John.” Sherlock answered, and hearing his voice so clear and low sent a warm crawl to the base of his spine. He grasped John’s hands in his larger ones, stripping off the leather and tossing them onto the coffee table. He lifted the newly exposed skin to his face and inhaled deeply; John couldn’t help the bolt of arousal that shot through him – it was considered rude to scent another vampire, an invasion of personal decorum and conductivity. Perhaps that was the ancient chivalry in him; Sherlock had never been one for courtesy, or decorum.
"Ha!" He calls brightly as he feels the edge of the scalpel meet something in the darker recesses of the tender muscle. Carefully, he reaches in and draws it out.
in it again. John pats the space beside him with his good arm. Sherlock recognizes a positive sign when he sees it, but he cannot help the cold fact that John is now hindered to bad arm and good arm and it is because of him.
Sherlock found himself outside 221b Baker Street for the first time in three years on a Thursday. He didn't particularly care for Thursdays.
“Why would I ever want to be in a world you’re not in?” He says quietly, coming to sit up on the bed.
Sherlock didn't give him a chance to respond as he moved and rolled over him, trapping a laughing John beneath him.
he found out. He had been right, as usual, when he had said that John needed a battleground to feel useful. After the abysmal event at Moika Palace, John had helped deal with the fallout between the Tsar and the Grand Duke; he and Felix both had been put under house arrest, and outright exile seemed likely. The abdication in March had been the death knell they had all been waiting for, and they left for the Crimea, where he’d seen Felix off onto the Marlborough with his wife and daughter. He knew that returning to Petrograd would mean certain death, especially considering how close he’d been to the royal family, even with a different name.
Mikheia snored softly on the couch in the library, a book draped over his chest and his hand resting on a pile rising up from the floor.
That serious look was back in Sherlock's eyes, dark and humourless. He laid a hand over the scar, over where the heartbeat had once been, one he would never hear, and a great tide of feeling rose up beneath his touch. The glide of peaceful golden light upon the water, buoyant upon the darker feeling of sorrow.
“But you didn’t know the man. All I’m saying is that…people, humans, they don’t fit into the bodies we want them to. Are they our friends, or our enemies? We came from them, yet we’re apart. We need them to survive, but they don’t need us. They act as one, but are so different when you look closely. How do you reach all, when everyone is only concerned with themselves? It is a hard road to navigate.”
Sherlock stood still, hands on his hips as he looked down at his husband. “I feel…that something terrible is going to happen. Perhaps it’s due to what Moriarty said, or Mycroft’s reports; the war is not going well, I’m sure you know that. This empire is buckling under the weight of what its people need. I will not have you be a casualty to an indifferent history.”
"You stand there and when I say he was an artist, you tell me he was mad. Well, what then of your madman? What then of Sherlock Holmes?"
"John, stop talking." Sherlock said tersely as he and Mikheia gently but quickly carried him to an empty bedroom down the hall.
Sherlock was staring at John, where he sat reading in his chair, unaware and ignorant that Moriarty was now talking in great detail about his hypothetical demise. Hypothetical. And Sherlock would make sure that's all it was.
Sherlock didn’t respond, said nothing, because it was most likely the truth; a two-day long absence he’d thought he could afford was now looking more and more like something perhaps Moriarty had wanted: for him to come running to John when he feared for his life, just as he’d said;
he was, when John walked into the flat and his hair was askew slightly from the wind and Sherlock just stared at him like he normally did and it hit him just how beautiful John was. How beautiful he was when he asked if there was milk left for tea and how beautiful he was when he stumbled into the kitchen for breakfast with groggy eyes and bad breath and how beautiful he was when he stared up at Sherlock that day outside of St. Bart's and how beautiful his voice was when he told Sherlock what they both certainly already knew, that he was clever. It was so simple, that
But…some part of him feels tainted that a stranger has wandered around the place where he felt truly safe, protected from the outside world. Anything could happen out there in London but nothing could harm him
Irene had shut the door on the sleeping creature and led them up to her private rooms overlooking the narrow canal. The parlour was hung with deep green velvet, gleaming dark parquetry, the windows flung wide to receive the breeze, the sound of the water, the unaware revelers below still drinking the night away in their cups as they laughed and talked and gave into what they assumed to be their worser natures. Carnality wasn't all there was to a monster, and they had no idea what kind of evil had been loosed among them. Fools.
"Wanted to see you in a better light." Came the slow response, muttered against the hot skin of John's back.
"You have been threatened with love before, and you ran away because you were afraid. But I know that you are not a coward and that your tail would never be caught between your legs, so you ran for someone else. For who?"
The wood floor was slick with blood, dark and glowing in the moonlight. Two bodies lay breathing, two bodies lay still.
The smile disappears from his face as quickly as it came, leaving this changed, greyer John in its wake.
“I didn’t have enough time to do this last night.” John says calmly. He sounds like a doctor, stoic and concentrated. “I could only stow him here, where I knew he’d be safe, or leave him in the alley, where he’d be a corpse no one could explain. He got a good hit across my shoulder though, so I couldn’t fly him very far.”
Somehow—and he won’t question it—they make it to the bottom of the hill, where Georgiy waits with his cart full of chickens and all his worldly belongings. John and Mikheia tumble inside as the old man spurs his horse forward, his back turned to all he has in the world, burning behind him.
“Sherlock, let him go.” Mycroft repeats, but Sherlock’s grip grows tighter. He’s shaking his head and he can’t stop. More water on his face. Why? There’s nothing to cry over.
What to do what to do what to do—what should he say? John, I love you as well. John, I think of you every day, whether you're with me or not. John, you're better than a caffeinated cigarette, if humanity was finally smart enough to bring that into existence…
"You should be so lucky." John said, breaking the silence. "Coming from Sherlock, that's a compliment."
“Do not mistake me,” the voice says sternly. “I can just as easily change my mind again. You’re a smart man—I’m sure you know that.”
“He cut you open.” Sherlock breathes raggedly into his throat. “He pinned you up like an insect and took you apart.”
Sherlock didn’t respond, shrugging out of his shirt and tossing it onto the bed. John got a brief glimpse of his bare back, ramrod straight, before the door to the bathroom closed.
"I died over five centuries ago, genius. Now who's the slow one?" He grinned, but fell back at the solemn look on his husband's face.
Then he’s being hauled across the table by the hand fisted in his shirt, and John’s other fist is squarely planted in his jaw.
The candles and oil lamps were all lit in their windows, glinting against the green lagoon as their small boat gliding along the canal. A black cat napped in an open sill, the smell of fish and frying potatoes drifting out past it to join the fog rising from the cooling waters.
Artemisia’s tickets had proven rather useful, as her gifts typically did—a cordial invitation to the birthday celebrations of one Ludovico Cadorin, commissioned architect of the Podesta of Venice himself. Festivities to begin after the dinner hour on the deck of the pleasure barge
“Yes, a demon hunter, must we continue this farcical conversation as you repeat everything I say or will you treat me like the adult I am and leave me in peace?”
Man calling significant other, he'll be late for dinner (read: making room for affair). Woman calling her son (read: trying to keep her mind off her other child, whom she never rings). Woman with child, going to see a dying relative. Man and woman, in love (read: sickening), first trip apart.
Some days it even felt like the army again. London pavement turned to Qurya sand under his feet and he could pretend the gravel on the rooftops was a dirt road in the mountains where everything seemed too beautiful to be so soaked in the blood of both sides. If he was being poetic, he could say that London was exactly the same. Yet it wasn't beauty or poetry that his mind strayed to when he was assembling his gun on a deserted roof or parking garage. He never thought of Sherlock or Mrs Hudson or Greg or Molly or Mike. None of them even came into his head.
“No.” Sherlock shook his head, checking the chamber, still loaded with the one bullet. “Harry must have taken it in her coat, put it there when we weren’t watching. She planned this, John.”
John attempts to grab a cup off a shelf he can’t reach and huffs a heavy breath of air as he stretches what Sherlock expects are sore muscles. Nearly falling off a roof and flying over London will do that to a person.
“Someone started a forum after you—after your fall. I didn’t read much of it at first until it started popping up more and more. People other than myself believed in you, believed that you were still out there, and I didn’t want to keep fooling myself. I’d seen the blood and…felt your wrist.” John swallows roughly, taking a sip of tea to mask it. “But one day I found myself browsing it, and when I checked the time it’d been three hours since I started. Then I went back the next day, and the next. People kept saying they’d seen you out on the street or in a coffee shop or playing third seat cello in the London Philharmonic—”
He needs a cigarette. He needs that little insignificant burning wad of chemicals and pseudo-tobacco that tastes like heaven until it turns to ash on his tongue.
Sherlock lets the beast lay its hulking skull in his lap as he absentmindedly strokes the soft fur. His hands are shaking, curled around the small metal pipe he'd grabbed from the water, clung to as he was dragged away from John, from where he disappeared into the water. A low, broken whimper stutters from his lips before he can stop it. He wonders if this is what being broken feels like, a slow crack appearing in a used pane of glass, the final blow that shatters him.
It’s quite hard to talk to John when everything he says sounds hostile, like he’s got a loaded gun on him and Sherlock’s a long-standing enemy who’s getting a morality lecture before he’s shot full of lead.
"Yes, you did, and Ronnette Pulaski's too. I heard you. What you were looking for is not what I am looking for. Kindly refrain from reminding me of your irrelevant protocol for manicures. Thank you."
"John." Sherlock says curtly and John sighs, heading over to the woman. It's not like he's asking him for anything impossible; she's good looking, so John will be interested enough to get her number. Not for recreational purposes, of course. A crime scene is hardly a place to find a date.
Even when he was away fighting in some war or another – and there was always a war to be had – John had been faithful. Sherlock would follow him, or he wouldn't, or they might choose somewhere together, but they understood implicitly that they were a team, and there would only ever be two.
But then John called him and there was something in his voice that made Mikheia stop, made him freeze in his tracks on that skimpy little excuse for a catwalk. Sherlock could see him shaking.
“Ugh, what he saw in you, I’ll never—ha!” She retreats, pulling out a half-full stoppered decanter of scotch.
“To the blood of the madman!” The lawyer called, and John heard himself echo it too, a chorus of them, cheering at the idea:
His walks became longer; once or twice he even risked the rising morning to talk to the postmaster and the stable boys before retreating back into the castle walls, avoiding the wings he knew he would find his husband in, and his husband’s constant companion.
John ignores me. I suppose he’s been without me so long he’s now accustomed to living alone, without interruption, more than he ever was with a life crammed to the gills with me and all the things I asked of him.
There was a knock at the door, sure and steady, and John knew who it was; there were only two people in the world with such a perfectly timed talent at interruption, and the second was on the other side of the world in Darjeeling negotiating on behalf of the East India Trading Company.
The long-suffering look degrades into a long-suffering sigh as Lestrade pinches the bridge of his nose.
"We've just been informed that the greatest threat to our happiness has been resurrected, and you're choosing now, of all times, to inform me that we may have another?"
“You’ve been busy.” John noted, eyeing the draped canvases in the foyer laying in their padded crates, ready to be shipped to their patrons.
The tall man always ordered one black coffee, which he nursed all night and well into the early morning. The staff was perplexed by the order at first – surely, he wanted another? Or got tired of the drink when it went cold? But he never did, and they learned not to ask.
Sherlock hummed, letting his hand fall to John’s chest. They stared out the window beside the bed together, down into the street, curtains rising and falling around women as they stepped up onto the little platforms in the windows, dressed as a fantasy, advertising whatever dream the nearest passing man might have.
"Could you blame me for not telling you? It's not like I've had friends who have cared about my well-being."
Azazel stumbles to his feet and launches off the bookcase, but John has planted his weight solidly and is ready to meet him this time, taking the brunt bodyweight and using the demon’s forward momentum against him, spinning him until he’s pressed against the kitchen cabinets, pinned by one of John’s hands that’s wrapped around his throat. With savage intensity, John rears his strength back and uses it to send Azazel’s head slamming into the cabinets once, twice, three times, until a dent is left and the wood shatters on the fourth impact. Slick blackness, like tar, coats Azazel’s face and he spits at John, trying to blind him momentarily as he brings a leg against the counter and uses the leverage to push against him, knocking John onto the island counter. The demon pins him with his legs, one on each thigh, and straddles him as he wipes the inky plasma from his face. Grappling blindly behind him, he manages to snag something John can’t see until it’s in front of him, above him: the silver flash of light against a large kitchen knife meant for thick meats like what his body’s become. He struggles as Azazel forces one of his flailing arms down, but it’s in vain, as the demon brings the knife down and buries it in his left arm, at the crook of the elbow, so far deep that it embeds itself into the countertop.
to be discreet?" John asks, surprised by the fact that Lestrade beat the most restrained man in the world to the punch.
He had given Sherlock an address, a name, and one sentence on what to do before softly adding that if he failed, he would let Sherlock see just how long his intestines could stretch.
Irene stared at him a moment, one perfect bead of blood clinging to the moue of her bottom lip before she licked it away in reflex.
He unlocked the door, coming into the cool, airy home, a relief after such a hot and oppressive night. The hunt had been uneventful – everyone in his local haunts had been too up to their ears in hookah, hash, or opium to give him the time of day, much less stand up. And to think he used to be worried about alcohol...
As the car rocks to a stop, they both take a long, steady breath in.  Heart beating a crazed staccato, Mortimer shakily reaches down, grabs his tea, and takes a deep sip.
"You let me burn, John Watson." The sandpaper voice came from the darkness itself, everywhere and nowhere. "And I plan on returning the favour."
Sherlock knew instantly what he was talking about, as well as that this was not the incoherent babble of a dream nor the dark dregs of a nightmare. He felt a tinge of jealousy for all the wrong reasons. He had been the one who was going to let John in first, but John, being that brave man that he was, being the soldier, he was beating him to it. But Sherlock's envy passed like dirt swept up in wind as John continued.
"I will." John answers. Soft feathers brush Sherlock's cheek. The kitchen smells warm and sugary. He can hear John breathing.
But, that was impossible…A dead man can't just simply sit up and walk around and stalk through the halls, looking for an obscure doctor with an obscure history in an obscure city. There was no faking the Golem's death, no faking that slit jugular, no faking those death rattles, no faking the light leaving his eyes. That was absolutely, unequivocally
Equally unsavoury, but the prospect of John’s presence back in his life is sorely tempting. The prospect of injury to John’s person is not. The chance of his abduction, torture, or death is high. The risks rival the reward.
"The killer did not take Jane Samson's heart as a souvenir, which was evidenced by them sending it to us. No one takes something out of emotional attachment to gift it to someone else—"
But he wasn't just going to sit here and wait for something to happen either. Shrugging on his longjohns and jeans, he tucks his gun at his side and heads for his shoes.
"Couldn't you have gotten that yourself?" John asks, returning his attention to the opened package of half-eaten raw meat in his lap as he breaks off a piece to feed to Gladstone.
“I’ll call you if he says anything. Go see Molly, although if I catch you nicking anything, it’s on your head.”
He must have sat there looking at the bullet for longer than he thought, because in the next moment Sherlock was coming in, back from the shopping.
Sherlock stares over steepled fingers at the heart, that stiff, tough mass of muscle. It sits on the kitchen table—"On a napkin, please!" John had demanded, although why that mattered when there had been far worse things on the table's surface Sherlock didn't know (John likes small comforts he reminds himself, so he quietly acquiesces)—lonely and dead. The epitome of human existence, laid out on a paper towel in the flat of a stranger it had never beaten in front of. In the deeper parts of his imagination, Sherlock liked to believe it was smudged in ink like it reflected its owner's personality. John's would be something dabbed with something nice and pleasant like heavy cream or laundry detergent or rich earth that fine wine grew in.
“It's gone, John.” He said, unable to keep the disappointment from creeping into his voice, already fermenting bitterly within him.
In the dark, he remembers Victor Hatherley, a man who’d come into the clinic with a missing thumb and a shockingly calm disposition. He said he was an engineer, called out to Eyford to look at a malfunctioning hydraulic press that was so large it constituted a whole room on its own. He was in the middle of examining the machine, too caught up in trying to figure out the problem to notice that it had been turned on. Trapped, stuck with no way out, his only option was choosing his means of death: lying on his stomach so his spine would be crushed or on his back, staring up at the descending piston that was growing larger as it laid itself down to crush him. He escaped of course, at the price of a sliced off thumb, but John can’t shake the feeling that, here in the dark, he must choose how to face his own death.
John mentioning logic and himself in one go made something in Sherlock’s reptile brain spark with nascent pride.
"Mikheia!" Sherlock yelled, and the boy rushed in. "Help me move him. Careful of his arms. I don't know where the blood is coming from—"
Once, he'd even smashed a cup of hot tea in his hand. That had been quite stupid. Sherlock would've scoffed and called him an idiot. Yet no such thing happened and John was left to bandage his burned, bloody hand in silence, which was the worst of all because it meant no one was there to rebuke him except himself, and he said to himself much worse things than Sherlock ever would, even on a bad day.
“He…” Sherlock frowns, trying to raise the dregs of the memory back up. “I don’t…remember. Why don’t  I remember?” He digs his palms into his eyes, feeling the pressure as stars burst.
"How is it you know where we're going?" John asked, wind ruffling his hair. The consecutive whiskeys had sent his brain floating somewhere behind them, head resting against the cool metal frame as they barreled down the dirt roads, heading for a destination he had neither mind nor presence to care for.
John looks up at him, brows knitted in the expression he uses when Sherlock says something unconventional.
A weight holds itself against his ear, and a jauntily happy ringtone buzzes in his ear, mercifully cut short as the line picks up. A deep baritone fills his mind and he feels himself rise through the mire of distorted sound and light. He feels himself again.
His friend looks as if he hasn't slept in a year, haggard and tired in the cold, weakly lit morning. He gestures to Lestrade, "When you're ready."
"John, talk to me. Tell me how to help you. Is this like last time? Do you need water? Talk to me, John."
Tenderly he sits up, looking around woozily to get his bearings while trying to shake off the ache that seems embedded in his skull. He hisses quietly, shielding his eyes from the bright fluorescent glare above.
He looked back to Sherlock as he rolled his sleeves up. A moment later a hand came up through the attic entrance, holding a small canister.
“The sun’s coming soon.” John said, stroking at his beard, the fine blonde hairs. “We need to get inside.”
"Anyways," John continues, sipping his water. "Just because I can't get anything nutritionally from it doesn't mean I can't enjoy it."
Sherlock rushed to the window, leaning as far out of it as he could without risking Mycroft's already spiking concern. He counted the windows up and across until he arrived at the correct angle.
A journal. John's journal. A piece of him, something that Sherlock could hold to, something that means that he had existed when all others forgot him.
Sherlock trails off, finding himself unable to keep talking. It's a cocktail of shame and embarrassment and grief and guilt, all mixing together into a highly-flammable combustion that rises up to the heat of his burning heart. It's going to explode soon, and he doesn't know what he'll do, who he may hurt, whose death he might be responsible for.
, they're that way for a reason, and it's only a matter of time before John's tied up in some hidden sex dungeon in her basement waiting for Sherlock to save him before she gets the ticklers out.
“I assure you, Sherlock, it was not my idea.” Mycroft says, and then adds sourly: “He punched me as well. Damn near ruined a perfectly good shirt.”
Sherlock frowns, lightning snapping through his synapses before being lost in the unstoppable rush of… happiness. Relief, light and soft and warm. John was
In the mirror, from every angle, his eyes are rimmed in red, blurry with irritated wetness. Life continues on in the blue-bruising streets behind him. The castle’s night lights have come up, casting everything in a golden glow.
"Well, she's not subtle is she?" John cracked, taking the doctor's mask and tying it around the back of his head.
“Because Gianni, I care about your happiness, and I’m an old woman with nothing left to do in this lonely mansion but worry over my friends and their happiness.”
"I know this is—it can't make up for what you've lost, but I hope it reminds you that he loved you, Sherlock, more than anything." Quietly, she laid a box in his lap. "You are loved, Sherlock…you are so loved." She said softly, brushing a hand at his temple before standing and leaving the room.
. Apologise for not being able to say sorry when John could hear him. For lying to him. For abandoning him for three years. For leaving him no other choice than the one that led them here. For loving him so completely that he noticed.
Sherlock glances to him, then to the spot of light on the wall, to the point in the corner of his eye that he could see and didn’t want to face. The gyroscope can still spin if he can’t see it.
"You let me follow you the whole day; you came to my home for dinner. Why would you do that if you didn't need something out of me?"
The train exits the tunnel and Mycroft is blinded momentarily by the shining light reflected off the snow.
"You're made of different material than me or Watson, Holmes. Your gloves are too tight to pull that trigger, for one. Too fancy. Too inclined towards looking
He would kill John one day, when he was ready to watch Sherlock burn, but until then he was going to have some fun. He would never let Sherlock forget that every time John went out, he would meet another Moran, another bug caught in Moriarty's web, and Sherlock would know that, with each meeting, John took one more step closer to his own death until finally it was Moriarty himself sitting across from him, ready to kill him, ready to make them both suffer.
you? Do you outsource all your dull and tedious thought processes out to your useless assistants now, or just the incredibly stupid ones?”
"What? You think that won't happen? You think you won't kill me? I know you will, Sherlock. You know you will. You already did, once, didn't you? But you only took my heart then. My brain still worked. And look what I did without you. Look at what I accomplished without you." John stepped back, a mad grin on his face, he was
Mycroft has disappeared. Most suspicious, considering he is tottering on the edge of becoming a suicide case.
He thought he was a better man than bribes, he really did. But after that first month, after that period of observed grief, Mrs Hudson had come to him and quietly, carefully asked when he was going to pay the rent. She had said there was no rush, no rush at all, that she'd understand if he was a little late, but after a month he knew she couldn't wait forever. Paying for a flat was easier with two people than with one, and now there was just one. Only one. How appropriate was it, that the cost of rent was how he and Sherlock met, and that was how he would try and forget him. But he didn't want to. He didn't want someone else in Sherlock's room, he didn't want another Sherlock because of the simple fact that there would
“You’ll deplete Tesco’s stock in two hours at the rate you’re going.” Sherlock says lowly, leaning against the doorway.
let them put their filthy little hands on you so they can carve you up and put on display like the rest of those people because they are not worthy of even being
But they both recognized that it was more than that, more than a minor irritant, more than just something to pass the time while traveling.
The fridge had been left open, the light still on but the rest empty; a crisper drawer had been disturbed. He went to his knees, careful not to disturb the large bloodstain, and looked around the floor of the kitchen, spotting a dark shape below the bottom lip of one of the cabinets.
"It was not my intention for you to receive the awful headache that you will get upon consciousness." He said down to Mary's decidedly unconscious form. "Or perhaps not. Morality has always been sort of a grey area for me." He sniffed, about to head towards the car park before he turned on his heel back towards her, kneeling down and fishing around in her pocket for her mobile, yet he came up with nothing. Knowing her, she would have had one on her person at all times, yet a quick frisk told him that there was no such device anywhere on her.
"Don't be stupid." John said with a simple smile, sipping at the too-thin, piss-poor excuse for tea. "I'll always need you."
"Good." Sherlock pushed up and back to lean against the seat, his legs splayed out under John. He laid his head against the wall and arm rest. John liked seeing the few dark locks of hair that had matted to his head with sweat.
Sherlock lifts his head and lets it fall against the tiled edges of the tub. He smiles a grin that’s almost too nihilistic for Mycroft’s liking as he tilts his face back to catch the drops so they can trickle down his parched throat.
Sherlock would be better off without knowing – at least, not until John had a solid answer for what was happening. As soon as this was over, when they left to go wherever it was that was after here, he would tell him.
“Hey, Jim.” Seb asks, dabbing at his mouth. “You know Moran’s looking for you, right? He called me yesterday. Looking for his half of the cash.”
“Being controlled? Yes.” She answers softly. “I can’t tell you what it’s like. It’s horrible. It’s…I can’t describe it. There’s no pain outside of what you feel. It hurts because you know it shouldn’t.”
“No, I’m sure these three years for me were just a fucking walk in the park compared to yours. Was running all over the globe and having great fucking adventures all the time a little too stressful? Had to take a public flight? Did your five star suite get downgraded?”
“I can’t lie to you, Sherlock.” John says with a smile heavy with sad honesty, a crease of guilt weighing down the corners of his mouth.
The boy's eyes narrowed. She supposed she should see him as a man because of his age, but his face looked so vulnerable, so young—
The yellow turns to an amorphous blue, the colour of light sparkling in clear water. Dots begin to appear in his vision, joining those crystal sparks that warn him of his own dehydration.
"It was to my understanding that you haven't been injected with anything recently, at least not to my knowledge, with the exception of tonight."
John would like varenyky, those little doughy dumplings. John would like the buttery taste. John would ask for seconds. John would accept the family's insistent offerings of vodka and bread. John would do all those things that Sherlock couldn't. To this family, Sherlock was a weird, bitter alien. He supposed he wasn't doing the good name of England any favours.
“You were dehydrated probably. Knowing you and your dietary schedules, I’m pretty certain. When did you eat last?”
He always found it odd that people thought nothing bad ever happened on Christmas. He found it odd that they thought that muggers and thieves and murders would look at their calendars and say 'Oh, well it's Christmas Eve, never mind, I'll just kill you tomorrow'. Of
Nothing had happened after that; they had rejoined the party one by one, though the rest of the men were passed out or close to it. The dogs had taken an interest in him the next day, sniffing at his hands, but he made a show of letting them lick chicken grease off his gloves, and no one was any wiser. The humans hardly noticed that neither he or John had eaten anything, but then again, they never noticed much at all.
“I still do not relish the idea of you returning to Moscow…personal feeling aside, it is a plan not without merit.”
"No, better than lowering yourself to lies for the benefit of other people." John frowned then. "Why do you ask if I'd be alright with a fake fetish?"
“People can surprise you, Sherlock.” John says before draining his coffee. “Right. I’m off to the shower. I still want to go out though. That wasn’t the caffeine talking.”
No answer. More watery blood dripped away from him, onto the carpet. Mycroft wouldn't be happy about the damage, but that was another matter.
"Yes. It was a coded sequence; the numbers corresponded to letters in the alphabet. Easy enough to figure out. To save you the mental strain, it spells—"
“John?” He repeated, nearly tripping over the train of his dressing gown as he shrugged it on, the silk worn and stained and spoiled, pocketed in burn marks, and he burst into the next room, a small kitchen with a coal black wood oven.
"Čovek?" John asked, summoning what little Bosnian he had managed to glean from the pamphlets. "Siva?"
else would've realised that they shouldn't trust an agency that pays in blood…" John let his head fall back into waiting hands. "I must be the most worthless person on the face of the whole bloody planet right about now—"
"Sherlock? Sherlock, what happened?" Lestrade asks, out of breath as he slides to his knees beside Sherlock in a wet squelch. "Jesus." He hisses as he sees John, groaning and squirming as he tries to move. "What do we do?"
It stands on all fours, its paws long and spindling, with crooked, dirtied yellow talons at the ends jutting over its toes. Thin, angled limbs shoot up to support an utterly emaciated body covered in pitifully thin mangy patches of fur and waxy skin that's crusted over with cuts and bitemarks. Its skin is stretched taunt over ribs that peek out from the edges of the thick, matted fur covering its chest and neck, which seems to be the most grotesque part of the whole creature; the soft flesh has been ripped open in claw-like slashes, the deadened skin hanging in flaps over the raw muscle of its still-intact oesophagus, shining a dark pink and red as it swallows down water.
I stare at the kitchen wall. John comes in at one point, with his old pyjamas and his wild hair and his wild cold feelings, and I watch him make tea without a word. He doesn’t offer me any, but I know John filled the kettle full enough for two cups, just in case, or perhaps out of habit.
scraping your palm against rough brick as you use your momentum to propel you into the next waiting adventure; into the waiting hot-red arms of the next chase, the outcome as fragile as smoke in the wind but to you it is just another day, and you know  the wind is only blowing smoke around a windowless room, for there is no real chance of danger. Not to you, and most certainly not to him. This is strange to everyone else, but strange is what you do better and what he does best.
"Will I ever get to decide that for myself one day?" Sherlock asks and sounds more wrecked than he'd like to.
A stray Tenebest lands on the ground in front of them, sniffing and pawing at the dirt before its great head whirls at the sound of Sherlock's voice.
“Yes, Sherlock.” Mycroft answers, his face turning back over his shoulder, yet he doesn’t meet his brother’s eye. “I trust you will find a way, as ever, to get what you want. You’ve always been persistent, and too clever for your own good.”
John tosses back the covers that somehow tucked themselves around him again and staggers to his feet. The room sways and he barely makes it to the bathroom before losing the sparse contents of his stomach into the toilet.
“Melodrama was never your strong point, brother dear. You’d never shown or felt strong affection for anyone, so, naturally, when John came along you mistook dependency for love...”
"No, the host—" Mortimer corrects, rolling the skull in his hands, and then stops. "Oh." He looks back down. "You think it will work?"
“Until later, Sherlock Holmes.” She said blowing him a kiss and winking at John as she strode around them, disappearing out the balcony door into the night.
"No." Sherlock said solemnly, drawing a gun from his waistband and aiming it directly at Moran's forehead. "Actually, I was just planning on shooting you."
“Believe or not, Sherlock, it’s there, and it may not be as much as you’d like but it’s better than nothing.”
The streets were bare and close to empty, but they could hear the faint roar and lights of the gathered crowd. As they rounded the corner onto the grand canal the scene blossomed before them in full: on either shore lines of barges and boats were moored to the docks, torches gleaming from their dark surfaces, illuminating the shouting figures, the laughing women draped in rich brocades, masks held to their faces as they picked at ornate silver platters of food and wine.
as he reached for the nearest weapon—a kitchen knife since he wasn’t armed so early after waking up—and then…blackness.
The scar, however, is new. Right in the curve of his left shoulder, where his arm begins. It’s a jagged round thing, pink and uneven, moreso in the exit wound on his back. It makes him ache to touch it, but that doesn’t stop him from running his fingers over it.
"This here…" Sherlock said lowly, letting his fingers graze over a wound John couldn't see. "It's in Serbian. Looks almost like numbers..."
"Well, we can do nothing, leave it unacknowledged and keep the status quo…we can pretend we don't know—" He looked up at Sherlock and thought better, understanding that the detective disliked that idea as much as he did. "Or, you can let me be the experienced know-it-all, and you can be the confused and constantly awed sidekick."
John grabbed him by the lapel and threw him out the window, following the man down into the snowy street below.
“Because I want you to fall with me. I want you to know how it feels when you pass through the earth and know you can’t climb your way back up. I’ve been dropped to the bottom of the pit and I want to pull you back down just like all our brothers do in their black hole hearts when someone escapes Sheol.”
"Sure. Lots of people are fascinated with death. It's a very human thing, speculating your mortality."
He must seem like a crazed criminal on the run from something with the way the cabbie's looking at him. Hell, he's taking deep breaths to calm himself and he's carrying an indiscreet bag that jangles with every movement, he may as well have been running from the police for all this man knows.
Sherlock sits beside their bed at the inn, watching over him. The water runs in the bathroom where Lestrade is washing off the blood and sticky blackness that Sherlock told him was ink.
No. He shouldn’t think that way. It’s just the pain talking, the physical exhaustion as his body healed itself. This wasn’t him. He owed so much to Mikheia, for helping him, for saving his life, for being here. Sherlock was not the only person that mattered, he was simply the one that mattered most.
Sherlock makes a noise of acknowledgment, but his eyes are still far away, concentrating on something John can't understand. He waits a moment, letting all his thoughts coalesce.
Sherlock leans against the wall and turns his head to stare ominously at the cabinets, as if all the wrong that’s been done to him have been their fault. His curls are starting to take on the oily sheen of unwashed hair and stale sweat. The dawning light creeps through the window behind him, illuminating his face, and the fact that the shadows there have become sharper is not lost on either visitor.
“What, I can come home and climb into your lap and treat you like a life raft, but there’s something wrong with sharing a
He stops suddenly as the door opens. Both boys look towards the noise, squinting against the new light spilling in.
"If you say so." John grumbles, laying an arm over his eyes. A cool hand places itself on his forehead and it takes all his willpower to not grab onto it when it pulls away.
Lestrade puts a comforting hand on the young man's shoulder and he looks ready to descend into tears again. Sherlock frowns, looking the officer over. It was not a weak constitution that was the source of his distress. Something else. Mark it; return later.
It was a miracle that they both weren’t unequivocally dead – silver poisoning was slow but nearly always lethal, and a bullet was even worse, the wood splintering inside the body and preventing the wound from healing fully until it was removed.
,” John continues, “I started looking through all the locations. I told myself it was for a lark at first, and some of the more obviously outlandish ones did make me laugh at the thought of you in them, but some…I don’t know, some had truth to them if you looked logically at it.”
"It was you, but it wasn't. Looked like you at least. He—he told me that sometimes you think what it would be like to leave me one day. Or I would kill you. I don't know which would be worse—I think both would kill me—but I have to go with you leaving because then I would know you were alive."
"Please," He repeats, gaze still fixed on the mantle. "Just give me one day. That's all I want. All I need. 24 hours." He turns his head and John can see his desperation, but also the resolve buried underneath it. Sherlock will use all he has in him to scourge Moran from this world just as hard as he had tried to rid them of Moriarty. John trusts him; Moran, even if judged with proper estimation, was no contender with Moriarty's brilliance.
he was probably thinking of a hundred ways to slit your throat or shoot you in the heart or in your head and then get away without anyone identifying him."
, John, to let someone like me be your end. I’m not worth it, I’m not even worth being near you now, let alone…let alone being the period to the sentence of your life.”
John barrelled through the stone streets, his shoes banging harshly with each step as he shoved aside the bystanders that were in his way.
Where to look? Billy was taken care of for the moment, but his blood was no good, even with the silver infection. Their kind could not drink from each other for sustenance—he patted at his coat, remembering the weight against his breast, and pulled out the flask, shaking it a little.
"Alright, Holmes," He says, placating yet stern, "but you need to let me in on whatever the hell is going on here."
“I keep seeing him kill you. I didn’t look then and now it’s all I see. Even when you’re right here, he’s still cutting you open.”
—"My colleague be employed by an international assassination agency? Did he think it was in my best interest not to let me know that he was murdering people because it helped him process my death? Did Mycroft think it was protecting, letting him be drugged into reliance on a seizure medication he didn't need? By letting him be tortured? By letting him—letting him—"
"I know you've wondered why exactly I left. I've been a bit vague about that, haven't I? I don't think I can really tell you one reason. I suppose the gist of it is that I left you so you would be safe, but you found me anyways. You found me, and now all those three years have gone to hell for nothing because you're more dangerous than I thought you could be. But it's not a bad thing, you know. It doesn't scare me. I think I may actually love you more for it."
Those clear blue eyes narrowed carefully as they watched him beneath dig through his pack for his canteen beneath the shade of the mesquite.
A low groan, a deep baritone that she recognised as coming from the rude skeleton man with dark hair.
“Good.” John nodded. “Now come on – I’m knackered, and you could use a rest. We’ve got a lot of work to do.”
Their first wedding, in London. The second, in Oia – Apanomeria, as it was called then – a rather spontaneous decision after another reunion, John coming off the latest Cretan War and Sherlock traveling through Athens from Rome. He had a fond spot for that wedding in particular; they’d gotten drunk off the natives after a local wedding and had a spontaneous ceremony themselves on the cliffs, over-looking the soft blue sea, watching the night fisherman cast their nets into the water below. The third had been in Prague, 1773, the fourth in Venice, 1854, and the most recent had been in Algiers, 1963, coming out of the cumulative fog of the previous two decades of war and strife.
"Not exactly.” John says and Mikheia smiles, despite himself. Despite the situation. He’s alive and he might die and it’s just wonderful and
to break this monotonous dredge as each hour blends seamlessly into the next, with nothing but sunlight to mark the time.
, John Watson. How could I not constantly consider you in everything I do? How could I not, when you are the bravest and wisest man I’ve ever known? You are one of the few people who mean most to me, and I would not see you ruined because of it. That’s why I spared you from everything. I can’t be your cap any more than you can be mine.”
Sherlock gives him a look and John can tell he's making a list of all the things they disagree on. Violin at four in the morning, binge fasting, what constitutes an experiment versus milk that's gone bad that John has the right to know which is which before he's poured it in his cereal and took a bite (quite the row over that one; it deserved a medal in red-faced shouting).
“He has a great interest in my wife. I met with him recently at Golovina House; he professed to me many times that he wishes to meet her. She’s in Crimea at the moment, but he need not know that.”
John drops the stack of books he'd been carrying from the library and bolts to the lounge, where he heard Sherlock yell.
It was far too early for John to be drunk, not to mention that not enough time had elapsed for the intoxicated state he seemed to be displaying.
“John?” He called out, glancing around the sparse room, tossing back the thin blanket. He wobbled on his feet, head spinning, but bit through the nausea and stumbled from the tiny windowless bedroom – more like a closet than a living space – out into the hall.
art? Ay, there's the rub, and it rubbed him in all the wrong ways. Music had melodies and equations and formulas. There was no science, no useful information to be gained from a statue or painting, and religion even less so than fact. Epiphanies were not to be had looking at smears of colour; one simply did not find God in a painting, even if His hand was outstretched to you.
“‘Resignedly beneath the sky, the melancholy waters lie’.” John repeats, hating himself, hating this weakness that has begun to eat at him.
All of John’s touches, his words, his heart, all of him sat in that little box with his name that meant nothing to anyone else.
Sherlock, so stop treating her like one. She's already saved your life twice, which is more than I can say for what she did in Bruges."
"He's dead. No thanks to either of us," he said, almost with a laugh. "Poisoning a man, then shooting him. What kind of justice is that?"
"In what context?" John replies, voice magnified by the high ceiling. Sherlock hates how his voice echoes through the pool, hates how he must remind himself that
John hadn't moved since his eyes fell on her. Their bond thrilled with roiling jealousy, nausea, blistering anger. Sherlock could not distinguish it from his own.
"So evil that he single-handedly took Paradise away from you, from humanity, because he thought it would be fun."
The roots of his shelves shattered the panes and wrapped around his wrists, around his stomach and chest and neck, pulling him upwards and apart. His heart begins to tear from the strain. He can feel it. Gone through the glass again, shattered completely, of course he feels it.
The sheriff's here—Lestrade—and she couldn't stop crying, so they shot her full of liquid calm. Somewhere, in the back of her consciousness, there's a great, wide gap threatening to swallow her, but for now she's among the clouds, where it's cool and peaceful. Everything's alright.
"I think so. They're shutting down the wings after they search through them. I'll try to get to it before they find me."
"I would assume so. From what I gather, you're very valuable to them. And you're the Golem. As I understand it, you're the
His hands were bloody by the time Mycroft managed to drag him out. Whatever Moran had injected into him made his thoughts blurry, unfocused, drowned in the sound of the drumming. Made him think the stars looked nice instead of the fact that John Watson was nothing more than dust. It'd be nice to think that his atoms were now free to float up into space, nice to think that the stars he was staring up at as Mycroft and another person carried him to a waiting car now contained the last particles of John Hamish Watson.
"Twice?" Sherlock made a sound of annoyance before continuing to wrap the bandages around John's middle once more. "I was only aware of one instance."
live without you." Sherlock said. "I want no part of a life without you and, if given the chance and we can't escape it, I want to die with you. If you go then so do I."
Ishido Shino, mole and next door neighbour, smiles. Yakuza members, after transgressions, are to give the tip of their little finger to their boss, as a sign of repentance and loyalty. Ishido, in his younger days, had overcompensated before his semi-retirement from the gang at the ripe old age of 29. Now, he was benched to the more promising realm of computer hacking and payroll, a business that went hand in hand. Sherlock had the fortune of discreetly persuading him towards his side before Kita Seung Eun had recruited him with that plastic cup of sake and the fake tattoo. A job promised in London through batting lashes was all it took.
"Leo is for birthdays from July to August, if what Anderson said can be trusted, loathe I am to say it."
"Right." He turned to the room, to Sherlock sitting at the kitchen table, to Mary sitting on the chair beside him putting new bandages on Mikheia, who had just woken up and with heavy eyes and flyaway hair. "We've got to get you out of here. Tonight."
“Speaking of,” the lawyer said, turning to Felix, “are you certain they can be trusted? I have a hard time believing that anything occurring under your roof will remain a secret between the five of us.”
Sherlock that he would come back, and he would, even if it killed him. And it almost had. He couldn't even begin to think of what Sherlock must have gone through, seeing him collapse onto the door like that. He hadn't wanted to go that quickly, he at least wanted to tell him what happened, to tell him where he was hurt before he lost consciousness, but John Watson wanted a lot of things that never happened as he wanted them to.
Mycroft stares at him but doesn’t answer. Sherlock sighs petulantly and clatters his fork to his plate.
"In that handwriting of yours, I'm surprised anyone could read it-" John was cut off as Sherlock tumbled him off the hood, hitting the grass with a huff.
Mary had warned him that this would happen. She had warned him about the side effects that would take the piss out of him until his body got it fully out of his system. He was very tempted in fact to run to the lavatory and hurl his dinner up until he felt better, but he didn't want to make a mess for someone else to clean up, much less get out of his warm, cosy seat to toss his stomach up on cold tile.
"I'm serious, John." Sherlock continued solemnly, as if he wasn't currently letting his tongue lave the tip of John's cock. "If you're not acquiring any pleasure I can stop now. I merely wished to reciprocate—"
He grasped the fabric of John's cardigan, the smell of him invading Sherlock's senses, as he pulled the doctor down, off the curb and into the gutter right as the sound of a bullet pierced the crowd. In the chaos of the rushing crowd, as he covered John's body with his own, kneeled uncomfortably over the curb, Sherlock could see the gunman being tackled down much more harshly than he had taken John down (he had been sure not to hurt John more than the situation called for). The man's head snapped back and Sherlock felt a rush of dread and admiration. That man was not Sebastian Moran, but he had most certainly been hired by him judging by the same tattoo he and Moran shared. Moran was clever, cleverer than Sherlock had given him credit for, and now…now the game was back on and Sherlock would win without a doubt this time.
Severe lines under John’s eyes—insomnia, or lack of sleep. The night terrors had returned. The 5’oclock shadow blurring into actual scruff signalled poor personal care, or lack of concern for good appearance. He’d been alone too. His clothes were out of date, as ever, but less so out of fashion sense and more from necessity. He was unemployed, or had no fixed income—remember to question him on that point—and bought from charity shops.
“My life.” Sherlock grins hollowly as he shuts his eyes. “My life is in a godforsaken smoking pile of ash and dirt in Sarajevo.”
Sherlock hissed, moving to snatch it away, but John was faster. He held it out of reach, and when the vampire moved to take it again, he threw it at him, hitting Sherlock square in the forehead.
John would not be coming back. Death was, if anything else, confident in its abilities to ensure its own permanency. As surely as the sun would rise every day, so would John Watson lie still, never to rise again. The thought made him feel like he was drifting over something dark and empty.
“No, he wasn’t," The Diplomat answers, "but we believe his death was criminal-related. May I ask where you’re from?”
For a moment, for one moment, he has his finger on the trigger, ready to put a bullet into any part of Moran he can find, but then he catches a twisted scar—there’s too little body mass, not enough weight, too much hair—and he grabs Mikheia by the arms, or tries to, but the boy is slick to the elbow with blood.
“Not yet.” He said, and Sherlock believed him. “I know you explained it all, that you wanted it to be me, that you felt ignored, that you felt as if I wasn’t—”
He sighed, staring down into the street as he settled against the threshold, crossing his arms. “If you must.”
If it wasn’t for the slow rise of his chest, he wouldn’t be moving and that thought is what terrifies Mycroft more than anything else in this world.
But John was a soldier. He was brave. He let himself feel pain instead of denying it, and he was stronger for it. John was a marvel, the rarest of the rare, and Sherlock loved him for it. There was no use denying it, since that would only delay his suspicions until the moment he confirmed them, which had been a long time coming.
Sherlock nodded. A feeling of peace was overcoming him, nowhere near permanent, but enough for him to accept the totality of their conversation. They had gone both nowhere and in a full circle, excising the unspoken demons that had grown inside them and their relationship for years, a volcanic burst building until peak pressure was reached and it spewed forth, destroying as much as it touched but leaving the spaces clear for sounder reconstruction. He did not feel happy, did not know if happiness was something he could achieve again, but he was content. John was here, with him, and they were together like they were meant to be, however short it may last.
“You sounded to be in severe pain, John, I wasn’t going to sit there idly while I thought—” Sherlock stops suddenly, shutting his mouth. “What happened to you anyways?”
But this was different, wasn’t it? Sherlock must have wondered why his texts went unanswered when the topic they’d been discussing had been so important. John found it hard to believe that Sherlock would ignore a prospective interest in something he previously thought was unrequited, even if it interrupted his research and even if that research involved Moran. Because he’d told John the one thing that gave John faith; the one thing that assured him that everything might be alright, that Sherlock would work with every fibre of his being to find him. He said he loved him.
"Poor little detective. So curious…so eager to know everything…and you haven't even realized that you love him, and he can never love you back." Jim pauses, thinking. "Although, I'm sure he would if he was allowed to, which would have made this adventure
He looks down, scanning the forest, through the tangle of branches and thickets, until he spots what he's been looking for: a thick pack of dark spots, moving at an inhuman speed towards the hollow where he left Sherlock and Lestrade. That's a problem, a very big problem. He needs to get them away, and quickly, but they're too heavy to take two at a time—and there's no way he'll leave one to fight for themselves no matter the chances of it happening—and they need to lose their scents
"That night in Bruges, if you remember, while John was showering, you woke up and I asked you about his actions during my absence. You told me them in such an abridged way that I was left to wonder if you'd shared with me everything that you, as John's closest friend outside of myself, would have felt the responsibility to share. I asked you if anyone would be coming after John for his betrayal and you told me that it depended on just whose orders he had shied from.
"You're feeling underappreciated. Of course you're useful to me, John, you've always been useful and I appreciate you."
Sherlock opens his eyes, catching John's gaze. "I believe Rachel Wilson had a drug problem, most likely cocaine, although I haven't ruled out heroin or a pill addiction."
Head already beginning to loll on her shoulders, she makes a feeble effort to move, but settles for opening her eyes.
She walks by two men, speaking quietly in English. One of them looks to her as she passes. She might say he’s handsome, even beautiful, if it wasn’t for the gaunt face and skeleton body. He looks like Death, living. He is Atlas, crushed. He frightens her, the way he stares at her, at everything and nothing. She wonders who he’s lost, who meant so much to him that make the emptiness she sees in his eyes seem so heavy.
. In one place. We can’t go the rest of our lives under one roof forever; we’d drive each other mad. There’s more to the world than just the two of us.”
take him away from me? At the rate you're going, even Anderson has a better profile of me, and he's the worst kind of idiot—"
“What,” he parroted, swatting away the feeling, “'now that it’s convenient you want to come back inside'?”
“Don’t waste your breath on petty deductions,” Mycroft chided, twisting the cap off. “Tell me what happened,” and, as he passed the canister to his brother, he added firmly: “Feed yourself first.”
if John wasn't there. If he left. John could be a wrecking ball spiked with shards of glass and Sherlock would push him back and forth until he had enough momentum to crush him where he stood. He would do it, too. He would let John crush him. Ensconce him. Consume him.
"Oh, wouldn't that be cool if I was?" He asks excitedly. "Imagine that, alien comes to Earth but its mistaken for a religious icon and the masses latch onto it, call it an angel and a blessing from God, and they don't even know what they're really seeing." He sighs. "Too bad that's technically already happened once. The higher-ups would never let it come about again if they could help it."
And Sherlock understands that he has. He knows he has, he knows right down to the marrow that fills his bones and the blood that rushes through his heart that he is the reason John Watson is now slowly decaying in a cold metal drawer.
Mycroft stares at him, eyes flickering down before he smiles, and Sherlock thinks it may even be genuine. “It is good to see that you aren’t dead yet.”
“No—you…you couldn’t have done it that night. You said Billy gave you the bullet. You didn’t have it before.”
“I don’t think you’re incompetent.” Sherlock says solemnly. “Ineffectual maybe, and certainly unorganised, but not…wholly incompetent.”
It made enough sense, even if John had only remembered being taken. He remembers the smile that grew on his face as he typed a reply to Sherlock, along with the bubbling excitement that what they’d been waiting for to break them out of that weird orbit they’d been in around each other for weeks was about to happen—Sherlock was going to come home and John was going to tell him he loved him too, the mad genius, and then they’d have the shag to end all shags and they could finally just be
“Do I look like I know?” John snaps, before he reminds himself to lower his hackles. “Sorry, I just…Mikheia, if this man is alive, we’re not only in danger—”
"Did you have fun?" Sherlock asked bitingly, buttoning up his coat. "I trust the wafer and wine were as mediocre as anywhere else."
Gladstone sniffs at the cold floor then straightens suddenly, quirking his head before bounding off into a door to their left.
"What culturally designated name do you want to call me?" John asks as he takes another bite of food. "Because they have a habit of changing."
“You have not seen what he sees, what I see.” Mikheia replies, sipping at his drink. “I know you never met me officially in Novgorod, but my life was just as exciting as I thought it would ever be; I did menial work and robbed tourists to buy my bread. I think I was just waiting to be arrested or murdered. Maybe I wanted something that meant freedom. I wanted something…so that I could live a little, on my own. I did not care what it was…”
Sherlock glanced up at him, and he knew what that answering grin meant. “Arty will be gone until dawn. We’ll have to find trouble somewhere.”
“Mr. Holmes?” His assistant asked, coming up behind him. “We still haven’t found any sign of them, other than the evidence downstairs.”
Sherlock frowned. “What’s made you think something’s happened?” He replied in Russian, his intonation just subtle enough to not draw suspicion.
It’s raining again. You know, as it does. It hasn’t rained since John left, but he can’t bring himself to connect the wires between
Sherlock politely doesn’t notice the delirium tremens as Ishido reaches for his drink, his standard fare of seltzer water and cherry flavouring for colour that he’d affectionately called The Hooker Spasm in a moment of self-deprecation.
Mikheia watched Sherlock appear as he pocketed his gun, watched him burst from the main factory and cross the empty yard like the stretched shadow of an invisible man, watched him pull open the large doors to the assembly plant and enter.
In the darkness it was his father. Bleeding from between his eyes. Staring at him with eyes that only stared. Eyes that his fingers had brushed as a child that hadn't shut because rigor mortis had already set in and they were frozen open. Eyes that burned him through that cheap casket that had cost them two days of food and his mother's pride.
—he smelled like Sherlock. That was the best of it all. He'd never expected to smell himself on John and the sheer wonder of it all felt like someone had dropped a ten stone slab of lead on his chest from a great height.
"Did you really think I wouldn't have a back-up plan?" He barked as he wobbled to his feet, picking up his dropped fag.
Sherlock nearly smiles at the deduction, and pride wells within him at the knowledge that the things he’s taught John, the things John has
"There will never be a day when I won't want to be." John says quietly before stepping away and grabbing his coat.
Somewhere in the distance, bells began to ring as the city began to wake. Tonight would be the breaking point. Tonight could be their end. They had but a handful of hours to come up with a plan to match one of the greatest and cruellest minds to ever exist.
Crack in the glass, signifying the bullet that tore through it. And the angle of the wound in his throat—
In his dream, he had been on the banks of the Pech River, dipping his sweaty, dirty feet in the considerably cooler water.
Mycroft warned him not to hope, but since when had he ever stopped Sherlock from doing something when he truly wanted to?
Sherlock nodded loosely, head lolling on his shoulders. John stood, furious, and grabbed him by the lapel, hauling him to his feet.
Something in Harry shifts away, some veneer washes off, and she looks away, out into the rain-painted window.
He snaps it open, the flimsy lock clattering against the table. The page falls open to the beginning.
"Hyacinth—" She coughed, gasped through the sudden lack of air pushed out of her by Sherlock's weight. "What happened to Hyacinth? The human man that came between two gods?"
Severe lines under John’s eyes—insomnia, or lack of sleep. The night terrors had returned. The 5’oclock shadow blurring into actual scruff signalled poor personal care, or lack of concern for good appearance. He’d been alone too. His clothes were out of date, as ever, but less so out of fashion sense and more from necessity. He was unemployed, or had no fixed income—remember to question him on that point—and bought from charity shops.
Tentatively, with more care than he'd ever reserved for anything in his life, he reaches out and touches John's hand.
Dumbfounded, she watched him go, turning back to her work when she noticed a weight in her pocket. Reaching in, she pulled out a large wad of bills, banded together neatly. Willing her lip not to tremble, she shoved it back in.
The agency had been impressed by his 'unofficial' work, that night full of raw anger and blood and mistakes that bruised later, and so they sent a recruiter to pick him up. Fleetingly, he thought that there was a distant woman inside that black car who would take him to Mycroft, but then he reminded himself that Sherlock was dead, so Mycroft had no business with him anymore.
"Well, the car stopped and someone dragged me out, into another car. I didn't think much other than 'okay, they're not going to kill me yet'. If they were, who would change cars instead of just taking me to some abandon field and pull the coup de grace? By that point I knew we were heading east and I remember thinking that at least they were taking me closer to where you were, at least I could die close to you. I blacked out. Woke up a few hours later with what might have been the worst headache I've ever had. It reminded me of this technique I heard the insurgents in Afghanistan use. It's called 'La Corona' in Spanish and in Arabic the 'Hadeed Tajh'. Both mean 'Iron Crown', but I'm sure it's called something else too. The thing about Third World countries is that their torture tends to share similarities. It's crude, it's brutal, and it's effective. But with the Iron Crown—or whatever name it's going by—you're tied to a chair and put out into the sun with a wet rope knotted around your head, which isn't a problem until the water begins to evaporate from it and it tightens and in the pain you forget where you are, what your name is, if you have family…I didn't want to forget anything, I didn't want to forget you or what you mean to me or who I was, but I—but it felt like I was dying, Sherlock…and in all honesty I probably was. Multiple lacerations, dehydration, psychological torture…it can do a number on someone. So I tried to remember, tried to hold onto things that I didn't want to lose. Most of the stuff concerned you, but I thought about my mum and dad and Molly and Lestrade and even some of the Yarders too. I didn't want to overlook anything. And then—" John sighed. "Then I was at the door and you were catching me and I knew that I'd made it back to you and I could die happy. But I didn't, did I? You and Mikheia saved my life…"
, about you. Hell, if I hadn't met Mikheia in the Kremlin I'd have no sodding clue who he is! You're shutting me out, Sherlock, and I—I really,
The halls are empty and hollow, like bones devoid of marrow. It feels off. Sherlock has a presence about him and John should be able to sense it, to know inherently that they are in the same building, sharing the same space.
Silently, Sherlock stares at the space that demon’s face had been before he turns on his heel and follows Lestrade, a shadow trailing softly down the burning hallway.
Was he alright? No. No, he was far from alright. John was suddenly back in his life, suddenly right there in front of him, acting like nothing had happened, like nothing had changed, but everything had changed,
"Was the hunger strike the worst of it, then? Went without dinner some nights like a badly behaving kid in time-out?" He asked with a bitterness he didn't mean in his voice. "I'd say I don't think you know what I went through, Sherlock, but I think you do."
Sherlock felt bile churn in his gut at the memory, at the feeling of being a passenger in his own body.
John's skin was cracked and broken like old pavement, streaked through with a smouldering tarry blackness like the veins of a leaf held up to the light. This was Not-John, some shadow taking his form, but he looked like him, he smelled like him, he talked like him and it was hard—so
“I’m sorry, John.” Sherlock said quietly. “I am, I have always been…a selfish person. I want the things that I want, at whatever price it comes to. I saw you, and I had to have you, so I did. You left, and I felt lonely, so I made you come back. I wanted out, so I found a way. Do you know what stopped me?”
It's as if she hasn't spoken. He keeps staring at the snakes. What else has he been waiting for, if not this moment? What else has he allowed himself to hope for, if not what might happen in the next few minutes? He should be running over there, he should be demanding for the idiots to work faster, he should…he should
"Honestly, Sherlock, we don't really have time for questions." Mortimer says, turning his torch on as they cross the lawn. "Bookmark it, yeah? I'm sure Harry'd love to go into specifics later, when we're not out committing felonies."
"But I was." John sucked in a breath as Sherlock's hand grazed one of the deeper wounds, another mark of the whip that had to be left to the open air. "You can ask me about that. I can tell you've been wanting to."
Sherlock is about to break his fingers one by one until he screams the location of John Watson when Lestrade bursts in.
have already lost before we begin the game, Gianni. If we are to follow your proposition, then you have negated the problem from the outset. If you did want to talk, then you talk with Mr Holmes, alone, and we know you have not. That’s very poor logic for a chess player to use.”
"Oh, bollocks." Sherlock muttered in contradiction. "Yes I did. I faked my death, I deceived you, I ran around the world, and you weren't at my side. I left you in the fullest sense of the word."
. Interacting with them was like watching a cow chew cud, so lost and ignorant they couldn’t even see what they were doing to themselves much less his kind much less the entire planet. They were all going to burn, burn, and take him with them, roasting in perpetuity because they were all too stupid to –
Sherlock thought with a brief flash of pride for John). Now he was fleeing, the cowardly criminal's way out. So he had somewhere or something to flee to, which means he's foreign. He certainly sounded British-possibly-Welsh from what Sherlock could make out through the door. This just increased the likelihood that he was involved with John's agency.
scary. Monster, terrifying, grrr, all that. Even Gladstone looks like a teddy bear next to you. The rest of us are scary because of what we are.
"You're worth more than being Kibbles and Bits to a pack of supernatural wolves." Sherlock says lowly. "You are worth
Other. That was unexpected, although in a way it really wasn't. He had never discussed his religion with Sherlock and so he'd assumed it was Church of England or some other typical venture. Of course he'd still surprise Sherlock; of course he'd still be a mystery. Too uncertain to check the Atheist or Agnostic box on something that would feel so permanent and too undecided to check something more defining. Fascinating.
Sherlock used his aloof attitude to distance himself from an issue, to give him a vantage point and clarity so he could spot and gather facts that his emotions blinded him of, but with John his mind was in constant fog and mist that hung over him like spider web, unable to escape, unable to burn away. He needed space, especially to clear his mind of the previous night's events, and John understood that, at least in essence. John, contrary to appearances, understood many things about Sherlock, like why he had allowed Mikheia to come with him to Bruges and then Leipzig (because nothing was ever just an
“Well it was real for me, so great fucking trick there, one for the books I reckon. I’m going to bed.”
Sherlock did not like snow, so, naturally, he now found himself in the city that was on record as having the highest annual snowfall; 9.3 metres of snow per year. Disgusting. He didn't care for sunny days either, but this,
“So, you’re damning yourself to try and prove a point to me? Feeding off poppy smokers and drug addicts will kill you, and it will kill me too, in case you’ve forgotten the vow you made. And, despite what it may seem, I don’t want you to go. You told me you were changing.”
Sherlock leans back and stares him. Mycroft knows that look too well, the assessing predator lurking in the grass. As if Mycroft were low enough to be counted as
“You—you—” But John seemed at a loss for words, pressing his face in the heel of his palms, striding around in a quick circle.
Sherlock could only stare at it. Stare as John continued running ahead, past the burning assembly plant, to the multilevel car park in the distance, the only place they agreed that Moran could have run to.
He didn’t know what waited on the other side. Immortals did not often think of what came after because it always seemed so far away. He hoped they lived through the night. He hoped he would see John again, wherever that may be.
"After all this time, you're still amazed by me, by the things I do, by who I am…it's like you're never bored with me."
"Well, for starters, for that." John said, motioning to the bandages. "For threatening you at the Kremlin. And for everything else we've put you through."
John was working at a field hospital, that much was clear. But he hadn't seen much action. He had been—what was the term—benched? Deemed unfit, not ready for the real game?
Equally unsavoury, but the prospect of John’s presence back in his life is sorely tempting. The prospect of injury to John’s person is not. The chance of his abduction, torture, or death is high. The risks rival the reward.
His hands are fidgeting, thumb running over the curve of his fingers. Why is he fidgeting? Who does he possibly have to fear here?
"Is this the part where I'm supposed to take you seriously?" Sherlock snaps. "Because you know what it's like to not have one then I'm supposed to appreciate mine?"
He was falling in the feeling of love, hot and smooth, weathered but showing no signs of wear. He could feel the press of Sherlock’s loneliness, all of his solitary nights, his desire for a companion clutched so tightly to his chest it left a negative imprint; the weight of it when it lifted that first time, under the willows on the banks of the Thames, the two of them racing against the sun after a bloody and fortunate hunt.
“Don’t be an idiot. Of course I don’t,” John huffed, and maybe because he wanted to make him suffer a little for the past months’ grievances he added, “but you weren’t exactly making it easy. Every day there was a little less attention, a little less love in all of it, and I told myself that’s normal, right? I don’t expect you to think of me every moment of every day. We’re not like that – I don’t want us to be like that. But I had to start learning how to live off of the scraps you tossed me and pretend that it was enough, it was like you were forcing yourself to be with me, like I was a
John looked to Sherlock, still so close to him, into those silver coated eyes right on level with his. With an imperceptive shake of his head, a slight twitch to most, Sherlock conveyed to John his most immediate, raw thoughts before they could be processed. Don't. Don't go. Stay.
They stood there for a moment, forehead to forehead in a quiet hallway, savouring their moment of peace as a building burned to ash behind them, setting their shadows alight.
"Yes, and I'm sure that much is true. I put the colloquial bee in their bonnet tonight. I want to be there when it stings." He said with a sly smile. For a moment, John thought he smelled gunpowder. He shook his head, almost as if he were trying to clear it.
John smiles then and it is too sad for Sherlock’s liking. It’s the smile of a martyr before they’re put to death.
"Everything that could ever happen because of my actions look like streets, at least to me. I know which ones are smoothest, that will take me where I want to go, and I know which ones are full of potholes that stop in a dead end. But those are only the clearest ones, the simplest decisions. There are some situations where I have to choose immediately and everything is a giant blur, like watching cars rush down the highway. Some paths feel better than others in the moment, but that doesn't always mean they're the right ones."
After Mycroft had attempted to see him to bed like the overbearing mother hen that he was, Sherlock wondered if he'd ever feel normal again. Perhaps, after the drugs wore off, he might feel better. Perhaps then the drumming would stop. But he'd never feel normal again, not with that hole in his heart.
He’d never known John as a human, a fact he regretted when he thought about it. In all of his files, his reports, analysis, great and endless wings of memory he had dedicated to the man, there was that large blank space of his humanity, and it drove him mad sometimes to think that although he knew every other possible facet, he’d never know John in that context. They both weren’t exactly candid about their past lives; he knew John had been bitten sometime during the ninth and last crusade, just outside of Aleppo, and something, the last of his blood in the sand, made him return again and again. He and the desert were as intertwined as he and Sherlock, two halves of a whole.
As he tugs his consciousness back into him, as his mind begins to burn as it wakens, everything begins to come into focus.
Mikheia glances back as he wipes his hands on a towel. “That is rakija, sir,” he says, motioning to the bottle. He takes a place next to John as Georgiy works the cork open. “Grape, according to Georgiy. It is like wine? But not wine. Nor vodka either. It is, um, traditional drink used for big occasions if you cannot have it at every meal. Weddings, baptisms, deaths…at a funeral you are supposed to leave a bottle for the dead, or if you cannot bear to part with it, you pour some over the grave.”
“I didn’t see you scrambling to help me either when you got out.” Azazel says as he arches an eyebrow. “By the way, it’s just been
When I was young, my father would let me stand up behind the great plate windshield, and I'd pretend I was flying, with the bugs in my teeth and the summer wind blowing through my hair, a king atop his throne on the bench seat, the air ripe with the smell of corn stalks baking all day under the sun. I never felt more free than then, standing like I owned the world, except when I was in Texas.
John had never spoken to him of what he had seen during the last world war, in Germany. Sherlock rather suspected that he was withholding it not for his own sake, but to keep Sherlock from confirming his worst suspicions about the human race. The news had gotten out anyways, the secret death camps, the starvation, the genocide, but John had seen it firsthand, and he hadn’t said a word about it, ever.
Birds caw over the whitewashed landscape, dismally searching for their brethren amid the stripped, bare trees, like dark ribcages unfolded and flayed against the silent horizon.
“Apologies, sir, I don’t have a clue what you mean...might I ask, is this the house of Doctor James Mortimer?”
“They’ll be alright here without me.” John answered firmly. “You need protection – he might know about the plan, and I don’t like the idea of you alone in a room with him.”
The gyroscope is on its last turn. It’s starting to falter, starting to slow. It will fall soon if he can’t grab the string.
"Depends on who you ask, sir." Mikheia said, his eyes following the detective before settling on the small bottle he had clenched in his hand. "Mind telling me what you have been consuming?"
The first thing he noticed was the open window, the curtains still fluttering in the damp wind from where they lay, torn off the rack in the struggle.
Mycroft stops by for a visit. This angel is a product of Sherlock's drug abuse, a hallucination at best. He is not prepared for what he finds.
“At the time, perhaps not. I was jealous. I was…resentful that you kept choosing her over me. I’m your partner, your mate – I’m not an accessory, you know? Well, I know you know. But the fact remains that you neglected our relationship in favour of what you wanted, and a part of me had been waiting for that for years, all along, and it had finally come to pass.”
“Of all the memories, brother mine, you pick the dourest, as ever.” Mycroft sighed. “Why you would entertain Irene Adler is still quite beyond my faculty of reasoning.”
“No, has it caught up with you that he sacrificed his life for yours without a safety net, without looking down, because you meant everything to him. That maybe there were greater things than himself, things that seemed better to him than losing you. You owe the sacrifices of a man like that a far better tribute than a life like this.”
human? You know what he’s like. He’ll drop your toy if you forget about it. He just wanted to play because it was yours.”
“And what might this one be?” Sherlock replies groggily, trying to gather his conscious thoughts into something workable, though they keep bobbing out of reach, disappearing into nothingness as quickly as they come.
"I don't know. I don't know I—" Sherlock stops, swallowing harshly. "I—I saw everything, I saw, and I couldn't
Sherlock watches in silent awe as the black liquid drips from John’s palm to the creature’s leathery skin, brushing over the cuts like balm as they seal under his hand.
He could hear the baby move in its suspended anima, and was filled with a sudden and overwhelming love. When he had been human, he had often thought of starting a family, having children, dying an old man surrounded by his wife, his family. He had long ago come to terms with the fact that it would never happen, would only ever be a fantasy, but sometimes he was reminded of who he had been, what that man had wanted, and it filled him with a cold sorrow, a mournful tenderness as he thought of the things he was robbed of, things he would never have.
Wakes. His mind feels like sunlight, warm and everywhere and untethered. Sherlock is yelling. No, not yelling. He's talking quick and low, hushed, but John knows he wants to raise his voice. Someone else is here then. He can feel them, their presence. Doesn't want to open his eyes. Sleeps.
than me, John. You are. I knew it'd take one incredibly proficient coping mechanism for me to deal with that, so I told myself that I didn't deserve your small intellect. Can you believe that? Of course you can…"
. Muscles tightened in on themselves, writhing, shaking. Tremors. John's hand left the curve of Sherlock's hip and drifted to his own lazily, like a lapping tide.
, making me think you were dead, all of our kind that I slaughtered on the shore that day…I never wanted you to see me like that, like the monster I used to be, and it’s like none of it ever even mattered, because you think he’s so
“You’re a man, Sherlock, not a Biblical figure, or a pillar of salt. Just in case you hadn’t noticed.”
In his little chamber, he could feel his lungs burning, the bronchi within shrivelling from oxygen deprivation. He could hear his heart pounding and he wondered just how long he'd have to stay under for it to stop completely.
Sherlock shuts the book and springs to his feet above him in one fluid motion. "What if you don't want a new chair?"
, Sherlock knew his brother acquiesced. He had known when he had dialled Mycroft's number and he had known when they met in whatever broken down building of his brother's choosing that Mycroft would say yes to him.
, have completed this assignment, so I don't know what they're getting at—" John stopped. "But you do, don't you Mary? You knew he was alive. You...you knew, didn't you?"
Not gonna lie, this song was on repeat the whole time I wrote this chapter. I'm not sorry. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVcbIc5yWI
limped his way into Sherlock's life in a Holy Trinity of bad jumpers, psychosomatic wounds and steadfast morality. If he ever truly believed in anything or anyone other than himself, it was
She poured another drink and swirled the contents of the small chalice, interrupted by bits of viscera.
A loud ring suddenly chimes through the flat, and Lestrade reaches for his pocket to answer his phone, excusing himself into the hallway.
“The logical way isn’t always the right one. My kind, we can’t kill. We can destroy, we can annihilate, but we can’t kill. It’s more of an all-or-nothing scenario.”
"It has everything to do with this! But oh." Jim suddenly stops, his eyes widening as a grin comes to his face. "You didn't know, did you?"
Without raising his head, the fool stood, taking no care to scuff against the sleeping forms on the floor as he answered the call of his mistress, disappearing into the darkness where she waited.
"But you stopped praying; you had school to go to, books to read, things to do and people to meet. You learned about the Coriolis Effect, about air pressure and geostrophic wind and things that had nothing to do with angels or theology and everything to do with science. But then one day someone rang you up and told you that your brother was found unconscious in a pool of vomit with his arm bound by a belt you once got him that was now too big for his waist. On the way to the hospital, you prayed. You asked for your lost thing to be found. Some would say you stopped praying because you didn't believe anymore,"—here John smiles warmly—"I think you just never had a good enough reason to with things that didn't involve Sherlock."
She ignored the barb, which was all Sherlock needed to know something horrible was coming. It was as if the fight had gone out of her completely, replaced with something great and hollow and sad. If John weren't so focused on hating her, he would see it too.
John had mourned for it already, cried alone in the back of an alley. Sherlock now cried in his arms.
Sherlock glances at him for a moment then nods. “I found a note at the crime scene, written in what I suspect is blood.” He rifles through the box beside him, producing a small clear bag and handing it to John, who reads the scrawl with a feeling akin to going up the stairs in the dark and suddenly hearing an unexpected noise behind you. What began as irritancy at some high school prank hardened into an icy shrapnel of fear, something he’d not felt since that bloody day in the desert.
"My God…" Lestrade steps back, a hand over his mouth. Behind them, Henry bursts into loud tears as he raises the forensics camera.
"Symbolism, maybe. He was well-off, but a businessman on a downturn, the perfect vehicle for someone wanting to send the message that even gold can dissolve under the Red Lion."
They lapsed back into silence. In the distance a small barge was passing, candlelight and laughter floating over the dark water.
He startles, moving to pull his gun from the drawer beside him, but when he sits back up, there is nothing there but his own reflection. It hadn't been himself that he'd seen—was it?
“When I thanked Georgiy for all he’s done. His reaction had almost nothing to do with what I really said.”
want to come back to you, Sherlock Holmes.” He says lowly. “Never doubt that. There will never be a day where I don’t want to be by your side.”
How do you begin to describe a luxury so lush and dark that you feel as if the air on your skin is powdered gold and silken ivory?
