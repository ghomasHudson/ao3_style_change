My mind relaxes.
“Love you.”

“Guilty.”
Lucozade is a UK sports drink. I think like Gatorade, though my knowledgeable readers can educate me on that point.
“Ocelot. And a sloth. And a ferret. And a mouse.”
Lestrade teased Mycroft’s rim. When he pushed the tip of a finger in, he said, “So wet for me, sunshine.” He then got to his feet and hummed. “I think we’ll…”
“Sherlock’s crop,” said Jim, nodding to the instrument in her hand.
Mycroft buried his cry in the mattress.
“What precisely did you want the leader of the bandits to do to you, Mister Holmes?”
“The day I believe that, Mister Moriarty, will be a very strange day, indeed.”
But her suspicions were unwarranted. Both rolled up their shirtsleeves and set to at once.
“Sherlock, you were unconscious at the bottom of a pit of snakes! I got you out and administered the proper antidote. I didn’t stop to sketch Mister No-Legs for the bloody
hard right now.”
“If we keep trying to spend time together, I expect I will return the favour. Crisis averted, I suppose, if you’re roaming free, slipping through the mist like a Whitechapel murderer?”
“And our hostess claimed to have never met the fellow.”
John sighed just as he was peeling off his soaked briefs.
“But let’s say,” John added, feeling defeated, “for the sake of argument, that I did want to worship you. I’d start by rubbing your feet and kissing your arches and your ankles and sucking on your toes.”
Ensconced in a makeshift sickbed by the fire, I closed my eyes, but no sooner I was kissed good night by the sweet strains of a violin than I was jolted awake by a disarranging of my blankets and a mound, like that of a fantastic mole tunneling through soil, approaching me at rapid speed. And then a head nuzzled beneath my nightdress.
“Not specific enough,” agreed Mycroft. “Perhaps something more formal.”
Later, Mrs. Hudson would admit the whole experience was an upending of expectations.
“Yes, sir.”
Bessie could not speak. She looked from Doctor Watson to Mister Holmes to the other Mister Holmes to the two Scotland Yard inspectors to Mrs. Hudson. Then she sank slowly onto the chair.
“Yeah,” said John with a wicked grin. He uncurled and crawled toward Sherlock. “And now, if you’re amenable, this wet pussy’s going to come all over you.”
The faces of kings and queen and emperors. The faces of poets and artists and composers.
In an instant, the straps were gone. Then there was a loud rusting and a concerned voice.
He grunted.
“I’ve a more fitting compensation in mind,” he said with a twinkle in his eye.
Lestrade groaned. as John helped him to his feet. “You two would find the body of a missing person at the end of the world in a snowstorm.”
Sherlock doesn’t like releasing his grip on John’s dick, but he does like John’s gasp when he shoves down his pyjama bottoms.
Leather.
“Like this?” asked Greg.
“Oh, Sebbie. Side by side. Then you can do us bo—”
“Come with you?” I echoed as I raised both hands in the air. “Hey, I don’t know what you’ve heard, but I’m a gent. With this dick, you come first, sweetheart.”
That much was evident by his rapturous expression.
The plug’s removed, replaced by warm, hard prick.

And the following morning, old Mrs. Whitaker might have had a nervous attack at the sight of him in nothing but a union suit, prancing along a trail of bare floor in a sea of blue shards, had Holmes not pressed a fiver in her hand before dressing and flouncing out the cottage, singing,
“Boss, did you do a trial run with this?”
“I reach a hand back and turn my head.”
“I love you, too. Come for me, your beautiful beast.”
“Yes, bless ‘em. We’ve had a wonderful day. How ‘bout a wonderful night?” She gave John and Sherlock each a chaste kiss on the lips, but below the water, arms coiled ‘round their waists and hardening cocks and the tips to more arms teased tender rims and pebbling nipples. “Like last time? You fill me and I’ll fill you?”
“Yes.”
“Me, too! Let’s toast to fond memories, the binds that tie.”
Mycroft waved a hand. “It’s the heat.” He turned and refilled Lestrade’s glass.
How quick the dark is settling ‘round!
“Oh, dear.”
“Yeah. Seems nice.”
“Yes, bless ‘em. Um, Molly, yesterday at Cecaelia Cove, did you, uh, notice a strange fish?”
He rose and thumped me on the back, saying,
“Please!”
They needed to balance the sweetness of miraculous homecomings and answered prayers with the sourness of reproaches and mistrusts; the bitterness of memories apart with the fluffy, ephemeral promise of tomorrows together.

“Ah. You read it well.”
“Sherlock, it was my fault,” began Lestrade. “I hadn’t eaten all day...”
“Won’t take long. With the long ride and missing you, I’m so ready.”
Mycroft leaned forward and availed himself of the handles attached to the counter, leveraging himself for a series of sharp thrusts. He spent himself, then cleaned himself, then left the chamber, taking the coin from the top of the third stall, no. 23, and slipping it in his pocket.

If Holmes was out there, whose hand was I holding in here?
Mycroft looked down as Sherlock sank to his knees. “Even if I beg?”
Jeanine shifted. Sally slipped her hand back between the seat of the bike and the crotch of a pair of sodden, barely-there knickers.
“You’re right. It’s fucking cool. Come here, gorgeous.”
“MOO-HOO-HA-HA!”
“So he’s watching? Like really watching?’
“Yes!”
Mycroft inhaled sharply.
“Oh!” she cried in surprise when her legs were hooked ‘round John’s shoulders and her arms twined ‘round Sherlock’s arms. Then Sherlock’s hands slipped back beneath her jumper and resumed their fondling.
These thoughts were still with me when Holmes and I returned to Baker Street, he having finally declared the clue-finding possibilities exhausted for the night.
“How would I know? I want a sure thing, though. I can book a nice suite.”

“For what purpose? To inspire me to climb up there and fuck you in front of warehouse full of sweaty clubbers? It isn’t that kind of club.”

Of course, it was. It was the middle of the day. The Detective Inspector was in the middle of a case. It was rather foolish of Mycroft to have even extended the invitation. He hadn’t expected his offer to be accepted.
“Yes, ma’am, but I was wondering what Welsh rarebit had to do with witchcraft?”
Mycroft wriggled his arse, and Lestrade went on pinching until finally he tossed Mycroft onto the bed and plundered his hole with his tongue.
“Every single one.”
“Are you hungry, Watson?” he asked when he was upright.
John shook her head slowly. Then she kissed Sherlock’s cheek. “You’ve got an equation.”
The word was as soft as crushed rose petals, but as Holmes reached for my hand, I glimpsed the sovereign.

Sherlock’s voice, however, was still that tempting purr.
“God, it feels like—”

“I got your note.”
“More?” asked Lestrade. “I can’t believe that you and Sherlock ate that whole loaf of Earl Grey tea bread and a whole lemon Madeira cake with candied peel in two days.”

When the knock on the door came, Mycroft was in the middle of regretting that he was a vampire who lived in a place called the Vampire’s Spire because all he really wanted to do was dig a grave for himself and die.
The relief of the released pressure and the firm caress of Sherlock’s hand and the solidity of Sherlock’s body behind him and the humid cocoon of the bathroom were all mingling.
“Well…”
Mycroft pulled the vest over his head and let it drop. He sighed and then slipped his hands beneath Sherlock’s shirt and jacket. Sherlock shrugged out of the garments, then tumbled to the floor.
“On Lestrade?”
“Oh, God.” Mycroft licked his lips, still tasting sugar and strawberry. “May I call you—?”
“Look at this man, Holmes,” I said, giving the photograph a hard flick of my index finger. “Look at his expression, his posture. He has no idea what awaits him. He thinks that he has seen all there is to see of suffering in his medical training. He thinks that the horrors of war will not overwhelm him. He thinks that the worst that he will witness is violent death. He does not know, he cannot know, that there are changes more violent than dying and that he himself will experience that change. He cannot fathom what will befall him!”
John chuckled. “Slowly? In the nude?”
“What’s this?”
“I’m an interested party,” said the man. “Interested in Sherlock Holmes. Not a friend, of course.”
He let his whole body fall against Mycroft, and their mouths met.

“Strings?” asked Sherlock.
John ran his fingers through Mycroft’s hair.
“Capital. But, be advised, if you show me yours, I might be tempted to put it in my mouth.”
I had the decency to blush.
“Not well, Holmes. There always seems to be ridge or a furrow in my way, and just when I’ve got this mallet tucked away and nicely straightened out, it will…”
“You might. You might not. But I know you, or rather, I know of you.”
“Gaelic Grasshopper!”
“Oh, yes, well, yesterday was a day, wasn’t it? Holmes was in a singular mood, too.”
“Naturally, but only if you feel comfortable.”
Molly trembled. Her bottom lip scraped against her top two teeth as if to make the F of fuck, but no sound escaped.

Molly’s sober expression didn’t change. “I
In the face.
“Not by half. More?”
The smile didn’t waiver. If anything, it grew warmer, so warm that Mycroft felt a bit lightheaded.
“Mission accomplished,” said Sherlock.
Sherlock turned back, wide-eyed.

“Yes, you are seeking relief for the tremor in your left hand and the psychosomatic limp in your right leg.”
My good landlady, whose feathers could not be ruffled under any circumstance, assisted me in removing Lomax from the trunk. We gingerly placed him on the sofa, and she went off for linen and brandy.
“Ooo. Is it Bond night?!”
“Those two have been arrested,” reported Lestrade. “Along with a few others, including Rako.”
Seb eased the straps off Molly’s shoulders. He bent low and kissed each of Molly’s nipples in turn, then said, “We think the prats deserve a bit of mammoplasty themselves—without anesthesia. Heh, heh.” He buried his face in Molly’s cleavage, nuzzling and licking.
John opened his jeans, never shifting his gaze from Sherlock’s trousers. He groaned when he saw the dark spot staining the front of Sherlock’s pants. “You want to wank just like this?”
It was staring at Mycroft intently. It cocked its head to one side and stared some more.
Jim tucked his mobile away safely.
Lestrade rolled onto his back and faced Mycroft. “I gave it and the Swiss roll to John and Sherlock. They asked for it.”
Perfect.
“Patience, my dear man.”
Sherlock was curled round the bee, his eyes were closed, and the look on his face was one of angelic peace.
I gulped the entire drink without pause. It was sweet, fizzy, and damned-near miraculous for at once, I felt body and mind come back to life.
Lestrade took his cock in a slicked hand and stroked himself as he watched the wriggling and wiggling.  He bit and licked whenever a bit of Mycroft came near enough, but it wasn’t often.
Many weeks later, Lestrade slid an envelope across a luncheon table.
Sometimes that’s half the battle, isn’t it, Sherlock?

“Excuse my language, but this is fairy godmother level shit, Mister Holmes. Where in the holy hell did you come by this at this hour?”
They needed something as strong as they were.
“I expected more stealth, Watson. Frontal assault by,” Holmes stepped aside as a one-eared tabby plunged into the fray with its two score brothers and sisters, “feline was a bold choice. How on earth did you manage to get so many?”
“Really.”
“So, Sherlock—”
And so we found ourselves in Strigine Manor. For one night only, Holmes swore. He would visit the church early in the morning, and we’d be on our way back to civilization before luncheon.

“Boss!”
Yours or mine?
I gasped. His grey eyes were full of unspoken anguish.
“I’ll show you biting and barking,” growled John.
“Sherlock’s at the Baker Street flat—with John. I’m, well, I’m here, just, well, you did say, but I should have phoned, terribly sorry, I’ll leave you to your evening.”

“I have sent to Mister Lomax, in recognition of his efforts on the case—”
“Too long.”
“Don’t be silly,” said Sherlock with a sneer.
“That’s my Tiger."
“Yes, please, I’ll need to listen to your lungs.”
“What do you think of Miss Helier’s tale?”
They sipped.
Sherlock came, first then John.
“Turn around again. I think I saw another spot. Bend over and let me see your hair one more time.”
“No time. It was just delivered, but ACME’s never let me down before. All right. Masks on.”
His gaze fell, mine followed.
The lust and admiration in John’s gaze made Sherlock bold, bolder than he’d ever been.
“No, Holmes, not disappointed at all! As I said, first times are always, well, a bit tricky.”

“You want to be fucked in a rubbish-filled alley like the whore that you are?” growled Sherlock.
Lestrade leaned forward. “C’mere, you.”
“Just a ghost,” said Irene, looking at her dead phone. “Just like me.”
“There’s a sofa, there’s a guest bedroom, but there’s also…”
Eyelids fluttered. “You are exquisite, my dear man. Please don’t interpret stoicism for,” he gasped, “lack of regard. Sherlock, please suck John’s prick while I fuck him.”
Sherlock pulled off quickly. “John! I’ve just thought of a novel way that we can work together!”
“There we go,” said Jim. “Nice and full, aren’t you, my dear? With Seb’s cock in your cunt and mine in your arse.”
“You ain’t hearing me, Boss. D’you know what Holmes used on Watson?”
“I’m here, Boss.” He kissed Jim’s neck, then twisted and reached towards the other beside table. He held a third weapon, the one that he would not allow to be soiled with Jim’s spit or secretions, in front of Jim’s eyes.

Then he sank his cock into the hole and pulled at one tail of the red bow, undoing the knot and then spreading both ends of red satin widthwise along the bed.
“Mycroft, tell me the truth. Did you invent Pink Princess Day?”
And with one flick of an Irish psychopathic finger, Seb was on his knees and his mouth was full of cock.
“Fuck! You do know how to appear out of nowhere, don’t you, Mister Holmes?”
“I think they’re making them. Stress baking.”
John laughed.
“Yes,” whispered Sherlock. His wings fluttered. His hips shimmied. “You’ve been so, so good to us.”
“Godspeed to you on your path.”
“Are you under the weather, my dear man?”
Jim’s eyes said everything.
For a ghost, he was very warm and solid.
The pause that followed was as pregnant as one can be between two confirmed Bohemian bachelors who are naked, in bed, and well into their first lovemaking.
“You’re still angry?”
John swallowed a mouthful of toast and said,
“The blue’s done,” said Irene as she waltzed into the bedroom. She turned and let the dressing gown fall. “May I have the red?”
“I only allow myself one glass when I am at work with a needle,” repeated Mrs. Hudson. “Gin and needles don’t mix. It is a lesson I learned as a child from my grandmother.”
“No, why—ARGH! Moriarty!”
And pushed in.
“Ha, ha! Not just hung like ‘im.”
“I fancy that whole jug on my head, but I’ll start with a glass,” he replied, gulping down the liquid. Then he sighed and handed the glass back to Mycroft. “Like you. Impossibly cool on the hottest day of summer. Also pink, in certain places and at certain moments.” He grinned.
“Okay, John, okay.”
“I placed my hands on your person, in a most intimate manner, whilst you were sleeping without your permission.”
Irene pulled off and licked a stripe up the valley of Molly’s cleavage. “Good?”
“Reason for being on the premises?”
The tentacles retracted into Mycroft’s body.

“I thought I’d find you here,” whispered Holmes as he quickly claimed the vacant space beside me on the bench. “Not the animal cages. Or the clown spectacle. Or the pavilion of oddities.”
His eyes changed. It was amazing how he could just flip a switch and look like that.
“That’s what made it even more amazing.”

“Damn, Mycroft, when you said ‘home cinema,’ I wasn’t thinking something this elaborate. Amazing!”
“Good night, Mister Holmes,” I replied.
Mycroft was unbuttoning his suit jacket with one hand when a flash of lightning lit the sky and a swearing silhouette appeared before him on the pavement.
“No, I am going to possess you. Come here, pretty Sherlock.”
Gorgeous.
Sherlock pulled back, frowning. “What?” he asked sharply, his voice thick with concern.
There were sharp tugs on the lead, but Seb didn’t mind. He kept bobbing and sucking the way the boss liked. He brought his hands up to trousers and pushed them and pants down, exposing very pale, very sensitive buttocks to the breeze and the sun and his own kneading grip.
“Yes,” said Sherlock vaguely. His eyes roamed up and down Lestrade. “I think you and I can be a mutual aid society, Lestrade. You help me prove my point, and I’ll help you prove yours.”
“I say I don’t know who I adore more, Holmes, the detective, the smuggler, or the baker!” I cried and closed the distance between us.

“Hey, what did you tell Jim to throw him off the scent?”
Jim dabbed Molly’s brow with a soft flannel. “At your service, my Queen. All night.”
“But it’s over, yeah? No offense, but you look like you could use some…sleep.”
It seemed like they’d been working on it since the very first day they met.
Surely that was not a wink. No, must be some kind of twitch, involuntary unilateral spasm of the—

Mrs. Hudson watched.
“Anything stirring?”
Sherlock turned. “Going out,” she said as she clomped back down the stairs.
“Good, good girl.”
“Kate?”
John curled his arms round Sherlock’s neck.
Sally shook her head. “Bed.”
I step out and greet the day as the air is shedding its night dampness, taking on a delicious dry crispness.
“Boss, you need to get a hold of yourself, keep your hands to yourself, and get out of here. Do you want this bastard’s throat cut or not? It’s all set up. It’s going down tomorrow just like we planned.”
“Sherlock! What are you doing here? What’s all this?”
“Madness, but spared the nutter’s bin.”
Her hands were all over him, desperately confirming that he wasn’t a grief-stricken fantasy.

“Yes, of course. You can’t see yourself?”
While Sherlock nuzzled and licked at the fabric, Mycroft studied Sherlock’s near-nude form, dusted with constellations of gold. He kept his hands at his sides and watched how the gold wig jerked and bobbed with Sherlock’s frenzy movements.
“You’re safe,” she said.
“Enough for a bath?”
Until they didn’t.
“Three more, John, and I’ll repent.”
“Well…”
“Thank you. He was sick for long time. Cancer. It’s taken while get things settled and figure out what I want to do next.”
As Jim raised her, his lips brushed her ear.
“Well, you’ve anointed them,” I said, “kissed them, I doubt you washed them with your tears, but…”
“Indeed,” cried Marie eagerly. She clasped her hands together and sighed at the pale-and-pink bottom with the crisscross pattern of welts.

“Yeah, me, too.”
“A good companion, hm?” I said, taking the stick from his hands and rising to my feet and giving the driftwood a sharp stab.
Jim snorted, and Seb hummed around Jim’s prick.
“By the way, where’s my box of candy corn?”
“John!”
“God, fuck, yes. Harder!”
“No, I don’t mind, what?”
“Gregory.” A hand on Lestrade’s shoulder stopped him from getting to his feet. “It’s all right. The glitter in the cake icing was drugged.”

Oh, no, no, no.
“Quite. But the tension seems to be migrating southward.”
I made a lengthy, absurd notation in my note-book and observed Watson out of the corner of my eye. Red skin became white flesh as he bit the fruit, and my thoughts wandered from the quest for truth to how, were Watson’s teeth to sink into my shoulder ridge, at, say a moment of crisis, they might well turn exposed pale flesh back to redness. And how might I welcome that return, there and other places...
Well, he was still going to do something, make a plan, and the first step was to…
That’s when he met the other toff, a younger brother of the first, who’d been messing about in some kind home laboratory. When the smoke cleared, the mad scientist had rattled off John’s life story as if it were an episode of East Enders and then explained, in wondrous detail, how he figured it all out.
“Am I?”
Their eyes met.
“Synthetic blood without the virus? Extraordinary.”
The reply was a gurgle.
“All right, all right. Good luck tomorrow. You need anything, let me know. Love you.”
“Well, I was once the brightest…”
It was a tiny herb garden, the rest of the area behind the cottage being given over to savage growth. Mycroft was not in residence often enough or for long enough periods of time to dedicate himself to anything more, and it was more about the pottering than the garden itself.
Indeed, it all disarms.

“But?”
My alarm intensified.
“FU-U-UCK!”
“What now?”
“John!”
“You can’t shoot ghosts, Greg.”
“You may scarce believe it.”
“Argh! Sherlock!”
John and Lestrade cried out. Then Mycroft bit his lip.
“Cheers.”
“My jelly,” repeated Sherlock. “Lick John’s out of me. Feed it to me.”
If this were a dream, Holmes never wished to wake. He sank to his knees by the bed and closed his eyes, offering his face for the blessing and as he felt the splashes, he heard Watson groan,
He was cold because he was nude!
The furniture was simple and unremarkable. A chair. A wardrobe. A washstand. A large tin box.

It wasn’t until I had been greeted warmly by the lady of the house and her three children that I turned back to the waiting cab and unloaded all that I had brought with me.

Mycroft’s hands paused in their petting to give a warning tap. His body stiffened, then jerked and he gave a soft, half-stifled groan as he spent himself.
The kitten meowed and bent its tiny head to nibble at the fish.
“I seem to recall you laying chemicals on, and removing, my eyebrows once. That was also without my permission.”
Mycroft had just returned from a grueling fortnight abroad. Poor thing. He’d fallen asleep instantly.

Mycroft’s eyebrows rose.
Seb drew off his vest, and Jim’s mouth was everywhere, Seb’s shoulders, his chest, his neck.
Hours later, Mycroft was standing at the wash basin, studying his reflection in the bathroom mirror. One day, he’d just go grey and be done with it, but, for now, he closed his eyes and shuddered at the memory of that exquisite mouth, he’d keep up the charade.
John blushed. “What do you need me to do?”
“You’re an Alpha.”
I could, but only with the help of Holmes’ lens and his finger indicating the fissure.
Marie sprinkled a bit of dust in the tin.
“A potentially suitable property in Sussex came to my attention via my brother. I had planned to embark on a reconnaissance mission before this case arose. Would you—?”
“Why, Mister Holmes?” he asked sharply.
Jim grimaced. Seb made a gagging noise.
“I’ve got a nice base. It’s a hike but worth it.”
“You’re bored.”
“Yeah, I like those sleeveless jumpers a lot, but I don’t think that something like that,” he waved the hand that held his own mug at Mycroft’s torso, “would look as good on me as it does on you. I just don’t think I could I could pull it off.”

“He is. And despite what you may hear, he’s also very good at his job. Nice dress, by the way.”

“…than suicide chips? Yeah, don’t kill yourself. That’s so three years ago. I have to say I’m a bit envious, Sherlock.”
The licking was glorious, of course, but what he really wanted, yes, there it was.
Lestrade smiled. “Gladly.”
“Some gardening things,” I said, glancing up at the overrun expanse beyond the kitchen window. “Seeds, implements, etcetera.”
Seb’s fingers, quick, efficient. Then, his long, thick, ever-loving cock.
“…the pests…”
“Well, it’s just that yesterday you were rather distracted.”
“And after…?” he asked expectantly.
After some minutes of silent, mutual, and appreciative ogling, Mycroft asked,
My eyebrows rose. “What kind of articles?”
“Pardon me, Mister Holmes, but you seem a bit too knowledgeable and nonplussed about my lamb’s wool.” Wolf looked from Holmes to me and back and nodded. “Indeed, so it’s like that.”
Lestrade turns onto his stomach, looks over his shoulder, and wriggles his arse.
“Good evening, Doctor. Might you put me on speaker phone?”
A twitch. A jerk.
“Why do you say that?”
“You’d lose her jolly quick. So, does that mean you are going to take a turn next door?”
Then I looked upon the garden and sighed heavily.

“It’s impossible,” said Lestrade, his face pink, the vein at his temple visibly pulsing. “First of all, lorries don’t get hit by lightning, and second of all, even if they do get hit by lightning, the bodies they are carrying don’t get up and run away, so I need a better answer and I need it now, understand?”
“Oh, well.” The expression became thoughtful.

“Glitter is a remarkable substance, John. I think one day I will write a monograph on it for the blog.”
“Let’s cool you off,” said Mycroft as he traced Lestrade’s lips with the ice cube; then drew a line down his neck to the open V of the robe.
“I wasn’t above giving old Mrs. Bradley a Christmas peek if the dear wanted one. She didn’t take me up on the offer.”
“Intentions,” mused Moriarty. “Don’t they lead to hell?”
“Oh, you absolute bastard!”
“Thank you and thank you and no.”
“When my knot deflates, we’ll put a plug in you. Keep every drop inside.”
He’d been half-hard from the moment that he spotted the tinted-windowed car turning the corner and had barely slipped into his new-found aphrodisiac and mumbled a cursory greeting before brilliant, beautiful, impossibly elegant—and efficient—fingers were making quick work of his belt and coaxing his prick to full hardness.
I decided to break away from the pack of hunters, thinking, in fact, that I might make my way back to the adjoining rooms that Holmes and I shared on the east wing of the first floor, but in the spirit of the game, I changed my mind and made for the west wing of the same floor.
In the meagre light, I saw the door, a russet brown affair with ironwork surrounded by ticking clocks and clockwork gears.

So, this is what kissing Sherlock Holmes is like, thought John. Fireworks.
“Stop!”
“Finish.”
John rose to the surface of consciousness very slowly, degree by degree, but nevertheless he was keenly aware of the scene in which he found himself. It was an instinctive awareness or, perhaps, a sensational one; whatever it was, definitely not a logical, rational one.

“The committee’s been meeting since April,” said Stanley. “There’s selecting the venue and the theme.

“Resting vampires rise. Risen vampires gorge themselves. Roguish vampires turn as many as might be turned before the cock crows. It’s noisy and bloody.”

She put a finger to his lips and shook her head. He kissed it before she took it back.
“Uh, Boss?”
“What happened last night?” asked Jim.
Seb was slumped on the sofa, looking up, admiring it.
“Sherlock!”
“Tell ‘em to bring a doctor! I’m gonna die of rabies!” wailed the voice. “A bloody fox bit me! That’s why I fell. My leg’s broken, too! I’m sorry, Mister Holmes, I really am!”

Too late, he realises his transgression.
“Casualties in the crusade for the truth, my dear Watson. But, no, my victory is for art, not science. My azure blood is singing!” The last was, indeed, sung.
“You know, Mycroft, I’ve been thinking, maybe between my thighs? Not as tight as an orifice, of course, but still tight and you could thrust completely…”
Sherlock turned his head and smiled as John’s jumper began to purr. Then he closed his eyes and listened to rain against the window pane.
“Last time, I was ovulating, too.”
It wasn’t until Seb felt that curious change, the expansion and lengthening of his cock which never ceased to thrill and disturb, that he eased the gun out of Jim’s mouth and set it on the bedside table.
“’Bringing in the sheaves,’ a hymn of American origin. Another cousin, Andrew Fortescue, happened—”
“She is a beauty and I do adore her and some fine spring day, when I have her top off and she’s purring like a kitten, I want to take you out for a nice, long drive in the country, Mister Holmes.”
Then he presented the test to Sherlock.
“Temporarily. I’ve a bedsit.” Margaret went on to mention an address.
He watched long, elegant fingers toying with his prick as he drizzled the lube. The fingers spread the lube evenly along John’s prick then guided the prick to the cleft of the round arse.
“Detective, remember? Describe the waistcoat while I find the lube.”
Finally, Mister Holmes tapped the side of his glass with his spoon, and the chatter ceased.
In some, ‘the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak,’ but here, by this garden wall, it is the reverse. The flesh has been subjugated quite nicely; it is the spirit that refuses to be tamed.
“What’s the point of a secluded Italian villa if one doesn’t sunbathe topless?” said Irene with a smirk.
Seb dropped his own hand, and Jim passed him the gun.
I interrupt.
But Sherlock had no intention of allowing John to finish by spilling himself on the sheets.
Watson hummed. “A bit macabre.”
“…like when your mother prepared your favourite dish on your birthday, that sort of thing.”
“More?”
He licked my tears, but his tiny form never ceased its quivering.
John paused. “What do you mean ‘today’?”
“Four,” said John.
Eyes fluttered closed, parched lips touched each other.
“Excuse me, Mister Holmes.”
I shook my head.
Lestrade smirked. “Then I’d

Irene spreads her legs. Molly settles beneath her and begins teasing Irene's clit with lips and tongue.
A sandy-haired lad followed, echoing. “Absolute saint.”
Soon he was swallowing and wiping his mouth and sitting back, saying,
“Another time. You’re busy.”
Sherlock put one slide under the microscope and then set another beside it.
Not today.
Sherlock and Mycroft stared at each other. Then they joined the raucous crowd its jubilation.
“Open!”
“This is unforgivable, inexcusable, unpardonable.”
The only difference was John’s cock was out.
“This village’s known both far and wide
“Wow. That’s a fabulous way to ruin a very nice bourbon—and probably a nice cup of Earl Grey, for that matter.”
Sherlock unbuckled Mycroft’s belt and opened his trousers. He sank a hand inside and fondled Mycroft.
Lestrade hummed appreciatively, pressed a kiss to Mycroft’s cheek, and went back to bed.
But Lestrade was not accustomed to
“Too bad. I bet John’d suck a pair of ginger balls all night.” He took one of Mycroft’s sacs in his mouth and then the other. “Like this.”
“Here, following the records trail, tracking down witnesses that might still be alive, or, you know…”
As Sherlock looked up from the microscope, John opened the refrigerator door and gestured to the row of bottles.
“Show me how you’d take John Watson’s cock. There.” Sherlock opened his mouth as Mycroft fed him his cock. “Take it all like a good boy.” He petted Sherlock’s head. “That’s right, suck, oh, a little harder, yes, just like that. A soldier like Captain Watson would not have my sensitivities. He’d want it, well, a bit rough. That’s enough, Sherlock.”
She unbuttoned her blouse and unhooked her bra and leaned out over the balcony and shook her shoulders.
Jim grinned.
Sherlock removed her hand at once and swore under her breath.

“Quite exhausted once, cause unknown.”
Holmes peered into the cottage. “Watson?”
Molly tapped the screen and a butterfly appeared, alighting delicately on the rose and, with the touch of its tiny head to a petal, restoring it to full life and beauty.
“Oh, a retirement trousseau?”
Irene dropped a hand from the edge of the tub, and Toby went to greet it.
“Fortunate, that,” murmured Holmes, aiding his companion in hasty packing of the hamper.
The bed was surprisingly comfortable, surprisingly because the room and the bedclothes, or at least the topmost blanket, resembled a monastic cell.
Coming back late at night, Watson narrowly misses hitting a girl on the side of the road.
“This way!”
“It’s a sensitive point, Tiger.”
“Incompetent sod, you don’t know what you’re doing with that thing,” breathed Jim. His eyes were closed, his head thrown back.
“Let us never, ever attend the May Day celebrations at Midsomer Downs again.”
More than a little tickled at the turn of events and hoping Watson would not injure himself in the pursuit, I abandoned my honey-making armies and followed the two out the back gate.
“You’re calling yourself
“Apart from what we just did?!” I cried, still panting.
It had to be Sherlock’s mouth, John thought logically, but at the same time it wasn’t behaving as Sherlock’s mouth usually did in this scenario.

“If it’s real…”
We found quite many ways to amuse ourselves until the fire bridge finished their business, including, but not limited to, of course, discussing how to pay for the inevitable increase in rent.
The blacking is based on a receipt given to him by a gentleman’s gentleman, a hundred if he was a day, for whom he’d done a good turn. He’d improved upon it with his own chemistry, of course, but only slightly.
“Oh, God, yes.”
“The last test is optional.”
He shrugged and gave his attention to refilling his pipe.
“Nah, your mark’s a much nastier fellow who doesn’t pay his dues.”
With his singlestick and his pugilist fists, he should have fought alongside Openshaw. And saved the lad from his fate.
Mycroft frowned. “Date?”
His eyes shifted to the map.
“I’m yours to be used.”
The message held no words, just an animated graphic: a deep red rosebud unfurling, blossoming, then drooping, then withering, its petals falling.
She drew lines on his chest with the keeper of the crop, circling his nipples and outlining his cock as it hardened and strained against the chartreuse silk. Then she swatted his thighs playfully.
“Waiting up?”
“And so, the shipment which had arrived was! Smuggling goods from the Continent, naturally. The items were distributed from a seamstress shop specialising in pajamas.”
Sherlock did.
The bottle of lubricant is on the back of the toilet. John squirts some in Sherlock’s palm, then in his own.
“Oh, yes. I didn’t want to be late, but the fellow at the front desk was near apoplexy when he saw me arrive doing my best impression of a bog monster. I was ordered a very hot, very private shower. I’m not entirely certain they haven’t burnt my clothes.”
His heart sank.
But the morning is different.
Unadulterated joy mingled with Lestrade’s lust.

“Mrs. Hudson. Molly.”
Mycroft slid his hand between Sherlock’s legs and began to rub along his perineum.
“What?!” cried John.
“Do you doubt? Oh, Gregory, yes.”
“Shopping,” said Mycroft. “I was not anticipating being swept up in a police raid.”
Seb ignored him for the duration of a breath, long enough for Jim to go from impatient to comprehending to reciprocating.
He gave her another squeeze, then stepped away to remove his suit jacket and hang it on the back of the kitchen chair.
“I’m sorry, Watson,” said Holmes quickly.
Not fit for mastering a beautiful pup like my Bully.
“I will still take it, the postcard, that is, if you’ll permit. It'll make a lovely souvenir.”
John smiled and turned his head. “You remembered?”
“I wanted him to open his trousers and bid me service him.”
“Only three days, I’m afraid. Not the rest of the week.”
“Donovan. Jennifer.”
“Good. I’m glad we can agree on the important things. Cheers.”
“Oh, shut up!”
Drip by drip, then all at once, sliding down in a torrent of sludge.
Lestrade didn’t know what to think, much less say, so he and Mycroft took their leave of each other in unusual silence.
Mycroft.
One cold winter’s night, the fox burrowed beneath Mycroft’s pjyama shirt and licked Mycroft’s nipples as his bushy tail swished back and forth between Mycroft’s legs. Mycroft pushed down his pyjama bottoms and let the tail caress his hardening prick. The fox buried his head in Mycroft’s armpit and licked. Mycroft spat on his palm and brought himself off while the fox continued his ministrations.

“Mycroft! Were you watching the whole time?!”
“I said, ‘Let me in, John. Deeper. I want you, everywhere.”
“Problem?”
One of Mycroft’s eyebrows rose. “It would be horribly reckless of me to let you so near my person, Mister Moriarty.”
He pushed up, covering her body with his own, curling his head ‘round hers, the better to flick her earlobe with the tip of his tongue.

Lestrade grunted and reached up, pushing Mycroft off.

The room grew warmer, warmer, and I realised, suddenly, but by no overt cognition of my own, that it was an infernal, diabolical, punishing heat.
“Enjoy the small moments of happiness, Doctor, however distracting.”
“Perhaps, but, it’s magic. One sip and your night will go the way you want.”
I laughed. “Look how hard I am for you, Holmes.”
“Oh!” gasped Molly, her face contorted, her back arched.
“I know, Sally!”
“Not yet, anyway.”

“Of course, I don’t mean to be ungrateful,” said Mycroft. “It’s just that I’m feeling, well, insatiable.”
It was then that I poured out my fantasy.
“This isn’t Long Island Iced Tea. It’s tonic water.”
“Also.” Mycroft glanced at his phone. “Let’s go. After you.”
“Lestrade’s on his way. Ah, there he is.”
I slid behind him and curled my arms around his chest. I licked and nuzzled the nape of his neck.
You smile.
Mycroft nodded. “I know, not ideal, but perhaps worth a try.”
And they talked.
Whack!
“There is a person underneath all that,” observed John as he sat on a rock by the edge of the pond. “What camp are you with?”
His touch was tentative and accompanied by frequent darting glances towards my face, which I kept purposefully open and placid.
I flipped to the final page, where scrawled in a familiar hand, was the question:
John scanned Sherlock’s face; detecting no sign of insincerity, he relaxed.
“Damn!” The tent flap unzipped, and a head popped in. “Hullo! How’d you know there wasn’t a homicidal maniac on the loose?”
But eventually, Irene was nude and sinking into the fragrant water and sighing.

Mycroft blushed. “Open, standing invitation to view it and sample its contents, Detective Inspector. Good evening.”

“Yeah, my turn."
“First, give me the verdict.”
He sighs and sinks further in bed.
Lestrade shook his head uncomprehendingly.
Lestrade recognised that the glow of ‘getting his man’ was wearing off.
Slice of cake.
I closed the distance between us and peered over his shoulder.
“You see? That industrious young man may pay two visits, or he may pay one, accompanied.”
“Back to the Farm, then?”
“Of course, I can,” said Sherlock.
Holmes hummed. “That sounds promising.”
“Oh, God,” groaned Lestrade. “I’ve got time for that.” He buried his face in Mycroft’s crotch, sniffing and nuzzling. “Pink silk,” he mumbled. “Pink lace. Little pearls. Come on, let me suck you, precious. I’m gagged for it now.”
My hands had been caressing Holmes’s torso in an appreciative manner. One of them now reached for the jar of slick on the bedside table.
“Perhaps. Good night, Detective Inspector,” said Mycroft coolly as he sought refuge in the dirty tea things.
“Matchy-matchy,” sang Sherlock as he slicked his hand. He gave Mycroft a coquettish look through his long, curled eyelashes, then struck a pose with hips twisted and chest thrust out. “How do they look?”
“No,” I said, shaking my head. “No, Watson.”
Molly took the latte from Seb and sipped. Then she gave a quick nod toward the freezer.
Jim’s eyebrows rose.
Irish coffee is coffee with Irish whiskey and sometimes sugar and cream.
“Oh, yeah.”
A bust. In wax. Of me.
“There are more things in heaven and earth, my dear Watson, than are dreamt of…”
“No,” said Molly as she leaned forward and looked down at the orgy under way. Then she stood back and released her grip on the railing and unfastened the clasp at her neck which held the bodice of her dress up.
“This is not a roleplay, Sherlock. I’m not your creepy schoolmaster who wears his reading glasses on his head and waxes poetic about Swinburne while he takes a birch to you for chewing gum in class.”
I was setting myself to rights when he pushed me gently backwards into the shed, whispering,
“Since tonight. I fancied a bit of fun.”
Sherlock opened her eyes.
The fingers inside Molly’s knickers had rubbed her bush; the tiny skulls atop Molly’s black skirt imitated the gesture.
The gold coins clinked as Sherlock dropped them.
“More, John. And I’ll throw in a raspberry glaze.”
Then his ankle began to transform as well. Holes the shape of a bull terrier’s incisors emerged. The skin and flesh fell apart like a strange flower in bloom, and it, too, began to bleed.
His eyes were keen, his stare impassive.
“How could I have been so blind?”
John barked.
Lestrade lifted his gaze from his own shoes.
“Fuck yourself well. Don’t spare a single thought for his comfort. Take what you need, as hard as you need it. If you smother him, well, he’ll die happy. I know I would.”
“Persimmon.”
“Someplace cool? Well, my hovel is the temperature of a lit tinder box right now, but I’m betting yours—”
“Not quite, but I’m flattered. How about a bit of ecstasy for the faithful?”
“Bring yourself here,” I ordered.
“Good enough to eat?”
“You don’t want to know.”
Mycroft shivered as they bid their second set of farewells.
“Don’t take me for a sucker, doll,” said Lestrade.
“Such a show-off,” said John with a smirk as Sherlock twirled ‘round him.
“Yeah, that’s right. Suck ‘em hard.”
“Not now. Turn. I want to watch you get yourself off while you grind against me.”
“Speaking of knowledge…”
“Freckles.”
He took it all in, the room and its many furnishings, especially the hooks in the ceiling from which were suspended heavy weights and the knotted ropes laid out in neat display upon an antique sofa.
Once soft, now hard.
“Most kind, Doctor. The leader of the gang caught my attention.”
John released it and whispered, “My treasure.”
There hadn’t been a lounge chair next to his when he’d closed his eyes., but there was now. And it was occupied.
“You’re going to foul your trousers,” cautioned Lestrade, nodding at Mycroft’s knees.
“I’m not going to kill you, Sherlock. Not tonight anyway. I’ll keep my hands at my sides if it’ll make you feel better.”
Mycroft broke away first. “You’re at the point of bursting, John,” he said, looking down. John’s cock was rosy, leaking, and even to the casual observer, painfully-engorged. “Let Sherlock suck you while I tongue-fuck your hole.”
“What ho!” I cried as the squirmy snip of canine flesh in my arms decided to apply his carpet sponge to the Wooster chin. Here was a pup of the first order! No doubt of the breed that followed the Wooster ancestors into Agincourt! A kindly old medico had carried off the black-and-white one, but I much preferred the white-and-black one. Lounging in the second-floor oasis of Northumberland Avenue, I’d spent an afternoon hiding from aunts and daydreaming of a gentleman’s gentleman putting a crease in my blue serge, only to find Wooster’s best friend waiting for me in the lobby.
I patted it and patted it and touch by touch, its form became known.
Moriarty nodded to his guards, then waved for Mycroft to enter the cell first.
I have never moved with more care than I did then.
“Take your time, Mister Holmes. You’re my last patient.”
Stella fixed her with a stare. “Oh, yes.”
“And if I wish to dance in the streets with you beneath colourful explosions of light and sound?” I cringed at the whine in my voice. “Need one preclude the other?”
“It’s a deer.”
They both tasted like the pub, but they were kissing before the door even shut.

The following night, Holmes and I were back in Baker Street, watching the fire, drinking whiskey-and-sodas, each seemingly lost in his own thoughts.
John groaned and made for the bed at once, but Sherlock grabbed his arm.
Then there were lips on her bare shoulders, and there were clever fingers understanding, and undermining, the workings of her skirt.
Jim popped his head up. His face was wet, but his eyes were wide.
“I can’t bear to think of you melting.”
“I am not debating definitions, Sherlock.”
Then he heard a beep.
He circled one nipple, then the other, with the ice, then bent forward and enveloped each bud in the wet heat of his mouth.
“Why didn’t you help?!”
“Yes?” His lips curled in a smile.
“As you wish,” I replied reassuringly.
“Yeah, oh, God, stretching—”
Green eyes meet his and flash bright and wicked.
She giggled. “Too late.” His pad of thumb was teasing her nipple now; slowly circling it, then moving back and forth over the tip.
“Bedroom?”
Mycroft drew out the length of pale pink ribbon from his suitcase, fingering the satin with one hand while he held his mobile in the other.

When one prick spent, she pivoted clockwise, and everyone shifted roles. They each were clever in their own ways, and Molly couldn’t help comparing.
She held the speaker to her lips and growled,
“You’ve still got the only gun that matters.”
And the scent. Not lavender or the usual perfumes, which sickened Moriarty with their sweet, cloying vulgarity. No, the fragrance had also been acquired abroad. It teased. It tempted. Like a far-off dream. Like poetry. And numbers.
“I will, uh,
John groaned. “I thought puns were my department.”
“I don’t know, Holmes. Clue, please.”
Mycroft drank him in, then slid open the drawer of the bedside table. “I’ve got to sod you.”

Sherlock and Mycroft were both well into their cups. Each had arrived expecting to suffer through one cocktail and one song performed, a duet, no less, by their respective Omegas. They did not expect John and Greg to win the first, second, and third rounds of the karaoke competition. Both loathed the venue, but neither had the heart to abandon his mate.

“Of questionable lineage.”
Toby leaps onto the dresser.
“Admit it, John. You were surprised and aroused when you returned home.”
They eyed the quilt with no little satisfaction.
Sherlock smiled and said, “Yes, sir.”
Lestrade looked over his shoulder just as the fog coalesced into a silhouette.
I shook my head.
“So that’s our festive drink,” observed Mycroft.
“It’s a violation of code, but I don’t think you’re going to report me,” continued Mycroft, “despite the oath you took as a fleet security officer.”
“Holmes!”
“Last time,” said John. “You said filthy things. You never say filthy things.”
“You weren’t a young man when I met you, Watson.”
“And you
Let’s pluck one.
“Do you have a hot shower, too, Mister Holmes, in your residence?”
“When you said the pleasures were just beginning, Mycroft…”
And now they weren’t.
To say Mrs. Gilchrist was a nurse and housekeeper and companion is to say that a typhoon is a bit of wind and rain and surf. She is, in fact, a force to reckoned with. She took care of me when I turned my ankle one Christmas, and I can say I’d barely recovered from the experience when she was on my doorstep again, barking orders with all the subtlety of a left hook.
But long ago, in a private hotel room in the Strand, when the states of my health and my finances were in tatters, I said the same.
John stood and opened his jeans.
“I don’t suppose so. Antiquing on a Wednesday night? There wasn’t a more professional reason for your presence?” He narrowed his gaze.
“Elliot Haydon made be found on his southbound vessel and brought to answer for his crime,” said Holmes. “I think it might be wise if Diana Ashely emigrated.”
I watch the water. Ripples, waves, troughs and peaks, bubbles, changes in colour and reflections of light.
Then I caught a second part to the message.
“How good?”
“Really? Did I think of that?”
“John!”
and ever two thousand times
“No, it’s for this.”
Good. Yours is a neck made for licking and sucking and dotting with broken capillaries. Shall I leave my mark on you? Shall we let the world know how much you love to be mauled? I’d rather suck your nipples. Pinch them between my fingers. Scrape them with my nails. Bite them. So very sensitive. Roll my tongue ‘round your pebbled buds. Shiny and wet before I clamp them. Oh, yes, clamped. Look down. Half-hard already?
“Cure,” said Sherlock. “That agent that generates hemoglobin and nothing else is the first step.”
Lestrade nodded. “But I doubt if there’s water hot enough in the world to burn this filth off me.”
And if he noted any incongruity between the note of feminine domesticity in the blue-and-yellow quilt which was draped over the back of the settee and the decidedly masculine atmosphere of the rest of the room, it did not rise to the level of conscious, much less comment.
“I didn’t want to have to do this, Mister Reindeer.”
“You, Boss, just got 70% of my hand.”
Sherlock rakes his eyes up and down John, taking in the sleeveless vest and the loose shorts. He gives exposed skin an admiring glance. “True.”
“Yes,” says Mycroft. It’s what he wants, too, what they’ve both been wanting, through the stop at the German bakery to tap at the glass case and snicker about how hungry they’ll be in the morning, through the journey to the Vampire Spire and the glass lift that rocketed them to this cave high above the city.
“Thank you. And speaking of understanding, please forgive my curiosity, at the time, I observed that you seemed keenly interested in my clenched hands. You gaze never wavered from them.”
The kiss was hot and sweet and as delicious as Mycroft’s dreams. He curled his arms up and around as lips moved against his. A head tilted, a mouth opened, a gentle swipe of tongue as eager hands roamed all over the dark brown cashmere.
Ah, there’s the rub.
I framed that last image of you, smiling, eager, concerned, yes, but, thanks to my enthusiastic reassurances and rallied strength, not worried, and tucked it alongside all the other beautiful memories that I store in the battered tin dispatch-box of my mind. What a life I’ve led! Know that I leave this world without a single regret and wholly convinced that I am who I am for having known you.
“Oh, fuck, Daddy, fuck!”
“What do you mean ‘no’?”
Sherlock nodded. “I’ll prove it if you like, right now.” He rolled onto his knees as John stood.
“I’ll let you get what you were reaching for in the pocket of that robe. You can have it trained on me the whole time.”
“If it’s any consolation, no one will be more relieved to see you come out of it than I.”
Molly bit the inside of Irene’s thigh, then rolled off her and settled on the adjacent lounge chair.
John shot him a wicked grin and growled,
“Turn it off, lad.”
“Release!”
“Yes, here it is.”
He tapped the screen.
But I am also thinking of the path that led me here and the one I miss the most.
“Because you’re too busy daydreaming about Lestrade’s naked, bronzed torso!”
“Would you like some breakfast?” she asked again huskily when her chest was directly before him.
“There are benefits, Holmes, I commend to your attention a recent monograph—“
Molly bends to kiss Irene’s cheek. “We don’t need to start over. This is just the end of Act One.”
Ten minutes later, the client stepped into the room.
“Fuck, Sherlock! In the neighbourhood?”
“Good,” said Kate, who had already silently forgiven Irene.
“What colour are they?”
“We aren’t brothers, Mycroft.”
“You don’t seem like a man who’s just solved an unsolvable case, one that will, with high probability, make you an inspector.”
Sleep was just about to overtake Molly; his body was warm, snugly spooned behind her.
“Mayfair job?”

And with that, Lestrade turned away, straddled Mycroft, and sank down, impaling himself on Mycroft’s prick.

“You let him suck you off?”
“I thought so. Mrs. Turner wears one called Holo Boys! for karaoke night. John, you’d really best tuck yourself in. The removal men are downstairs.”
“And a ripened Holmes is the most delicious of fruit!”
Holmes gave Watson a side-eye and harrumphed for good measure. “Be that as it may, shall turn our attention back to the case? Yes, in the foraging guide found in Hawkriver’s coat pocket the drawings of the two types of mushrooms indicate they are very, very similar, but did you read the summaries?”

Sherlock stared coldly on his brother. His hand formed a fist.
“Please, Sebbie. I want it. That colossal fist—”
The video was muted but he remembered her hollow moans.

Licking, nosing, grunting which grew louder and more demanding until…
When he was gone, John fixed Sherlock with a look.
Suddenly, the tree was in John’s arms. Something hit the seat of John’s armchair.
“FUCK!”
Mycroft’s shudder is the first of many, but dawn finds him sated and curled against Lestrade, who keeps one foot on the ground, rocking them both to blissful slumber.

One bite remained. Mycroft mouthed the final lines.
My heart was warmed by the spectacle. I stood and watched, and then it occurred to me that I could add to the magic of the moment in a small way.
Lestrade then turned his attention back to Sherlock. “I have to drink plenty of cold coffee, but I don’t drink it if I don’t have to, I don’t drink it on my day off, and, most especially, I don’t drink it to please whiny babies who can’t wait a hour to get a proper ‘good morning’ shag!”
I grunted, ignoring the curls of smoke.
“Flying on red wings tonight, eh, Boss?”
“Oh, it’s Christmas!” he cried. “Case!”
“Her part doesn’t concern me. She is the victim in all this, as well as a very comely woman if the photograph doesn’t flatter.”

A television crew had been at The Bates in the afternoon, and Lestrade and John were still in their uniform vests and kilts. They hadn’t washed yet, but there were two large plastic bladders of sun-warmed water waiting on them. The outdoor shower wouldn’t be as pleasant as it might have been. The days were growing shorter, and the filming had been tedious and long, so daylight was already fading fast before they’d had opportunity to remove the day’s grime.

“This ol’ thing?”
“What’ll it be?”
Sherlock pushed his cock into John’s hole. “Someone’s watching you, John.”
“Fuck!”
Moriarty fell on his hands and knees. Sherlock mounted him and fucked him raw.

“Too long this time, Molls.”
Still grinning, Lestrade closes the distance between them. “Room enough for two in there?”
“Indeed.” Sherlock’s voice sounded as wistful as John’s. He disappeared into the toilet and returned with a pair of wet flannels.
“Now?”

I’d stumbled. It’d been folly to involve the police in the examination of the scene. My explanation for the falling brick that narrowly missed me would be no more convincing than that of the whizzing two-horse van which earlier had attempted the same. At best, it was a waste of precious time and energy; at worst, I might be playing into the hands of Professor Moriarty, giving unnecessary advantage and access to one of his many agents, who must be counted in all ranks of society, including the police force.

As in most things, Holmes was right. There were relapses and rows and fits of temper, but looking back, I hardly remember them. I do, however, remember that evening. It did not end as I’d anticipated, but nevertheless, the scene is fixed in my mind. Age hasn’t withered it one jot.

John rolled his hips toward Sherlock and broke away to pant, “I’m ready. Greg?”
Mycroft nodded. His eyes were hooded, his lips bruised. “Georges will take you back.”
The velvet tone softened the blow. I flinched nonetheless, then sat back in my chair and crossed my arms over my chest.
“Doctor Watson?”
It was a little-known fact that lust brought out the poet in Mycroft Holmes, and though Mycroft wasn’t ashamed of the little-known fact, per se, he would’ve endured any amount of Spanish Inquisition-style torture before he would’ve confessed the simile that was consuming his thoughts at the moment.
“What? Oh, okay. Let’s have a drink, then we can have a second go.”
Watson only blushed and grinned.
“Well, in that case, I’m going to give you your gift early.”

Molly leaned back against his chest and arched into his touch. “Sylvia from Accounting saw us last night.”
As the doors closed, John longed to be as invisible in body as she was in spirit. She took a deep breath, the precursor to a self-pitying sigh, then started violently.
On the small screen, there was a blip, and Sherlock was seen in profile. He was leaning forward, towards a pillow, with one hand wrapped round his prick and the front of knickers yanked down to his balls. He was reaching back with the other hand, grasping the protruding handle of the dildo. The back of the knickers was bunched to the cleft of his arse.

Lestrade let the sides of the robe fall apart. He watched Mycroft’s expression melt as his eyes moved up and down, ogling the body and thick cock that jutted out of wiry hair. He took a raspberry between his lips, then kissed Mycroft, then whispered, “Fuck me.”
I am reassured at the twin notch on this side of the wall.

He mewled in protest when the sensations vanished.
“This is working from home?”

Sherlock’s supercomputer brain went offline at the first touch of those lips. He leaned forward and caressed the soft brown fur and fucked the hole and the mouth within the hole.
John smiled. “And this isn’t the first time you’ve watched me train.”
“Mister Holmes I should strongly advise you to drop this case!” Moriarty’s voice trembled from the violence of the assault.

Strings of crystals were arranged in circles around Sherlock’s neck and matching strings outlined his pectorals in triangles, like a stripper’s version of a chain mail bra. He wore heart-shaped pasties covering his nipples and tiny black knickers overlayed with more strings of crystals. He seemed to have no trouble staying upright on the high-heeled shoes while he gyrated and twirled and shimmied. He lifted his face to the ceiling, showing off chandelier earrings dangling from his lobs.
John squeezed hard, and a tiny squeak escaped Sherlock’s lips.
“Oh, Holmes!”
“Peter Evans. Do you think he’s more aggrieved or relieved that his wife is dead?”
Their second first kiss was before the fire, with Kate nude and curled in Irene’s lap. Irene’s mouth was hungry, pressing hard, pausing its assault only to bite at Kate’s bottom lip and lick at her top lip.

Lestrade savoured the anticipation. After all, he wasn’t a lad anymore; all-night binges were the stuff of fond memories. He liked his sleep a bit too much.

Lestrade closed his eyes and leaned forward with arms outstretched. He passed through the water until the scalding spray was running down his back and his hands were flat to the steam-wet tiles.

The only difference was that in my haste to contain the disaster, I fell and hit my head, resulting in the good doctor placing me under his strict supervision for the remainder of the day and the night. I was not disappointed, however. I decided long ago that Watson’s tender care was worth any loss to science. Such care meant that I slept very well and woke to a message on my forearm.

“Yeah.” Seb unfastened his trousers.
Mycroft has a sunny surprise for his dom. Mystrade. D/s elements. Daddy kink. Lingerie. Nipple clamps. Breeding stand/fucking machine. Feminizing language.
John blinked once.
“Mine.”
“Really, Irene.”

“—best suit!”
“You are kind.”
Sally smiled. “What is it? I love it when you get an idea.”
“No, ma’am, but isn’t that Welsh rarebit?”
“Join me, if it suits you.”
“No, it won’t. Tell me, please.”

“C’mon, John, the session’s over. Everyone else has left.”

“Seb!”
Lestrade leaned down and rubbed the front of Mycroft’s trousers, coaxing a bulge to hardening.
Jim makes Sherlock an indecent proposal. Rating: Teen.
“Too small for a whole body, but a piece of one? Perhaps.”
“Perhaps there’s a cursed sarcophagus around here to which you can apply your wit.”
“Goblins like fire, no?” teases Mycroft as he leans in for another kiss.
Indeed, it seemed that the bed itself, with its sensual design, was demanding that its occupant do nothing else, once the body’s need for slumber had been satisfied.
“I am dreadfully sorry, Detective Inspector. I am not certain what came over me. I am not myself at the moment. It’s probably jet lag. I just returned from Beijing. But may I ask what brings you here so handsomely, uh, that is to say, so suddenly ‘cross my humble threshold?”
“You read my mind, Sherlock.”
“Very well,” said Mycroft. He yanked Lestrade’s trousers and pants down as far as fabrics allowed, then circled behind him. He straddling John, then buried his face in the cleft of Lestrade’s arse.
John gifted each abused buttock with a light kiss. “Such a pretty pink.”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow and smiled. “You smell so good.”
Sherlock and John meet on Halloween on a crowded tube car. Gender/cisswap. Sentinel!Alpha!Sherlock/Omega!Guide!John. Alternate First Meeting. Hurt/Comfort with cameo by BAMF!Mrs. Hudson at the end.
He held her gaze for a long moment as the snow fell about them, then he kissed her lips softly and nodded.
“But the cards believe in
“It’s called ‘science,’ Brother Mine, specifically ‘chemistry.’ Perhaps you’re unfamiliar.”
Irene moved closer until she could unbutton Molly’s blouse, then unfasten the clasp of her bra.
She’d coughed as she came, and the tip of a tongue had licked the droplets from the corner of her mouth.
“It was you!” I breathed. “The old beggar was you! I never guessed.” I shook my head, then regretted it as pain momentarily blinded me. I pinched my eyes shut to prevent the flow of tears.
“You silly man. You’ve given me a terrible fright tonight. Thank goodness the one at the other end of the reins had more sense. Barabbas trotted to the cottage, and when there wasn’t a doctor—or a cart—I raised the alarm. Jacob is here. If you still have all your fingers and toes after this, it’ll be a miracle.”
A cock was thrust between Seb's lips. He sucked it between foul oaths.
Mycroft’s face was blank for a moment, but just a moment. Then his expression softened.
I can’t conclude but thus:
“Whatever are you doing in London?” asked Martha.
“Oh, we haven’t tried that.”
“Parasol, Miss?”
The aroma tickles his nostrils and sings in his blood like a heralding trumpet. He inhales, ferrying the fragrance deep into his body, letting every fibre vibrate with anticipation.
The ‘please’ breaks him. He slides up Seb’s body, which is hard in every sense of the word.
John’s mind is blank, then he says,
“Mine.”
I heard shrieks, chains rattling, moans, then silence.
Prompt: Whitsun
“—of what happened to them. Well, good night, dear. Sweet dreams.”
“Well done, Watson.”
Moments later, Mycroft was on all fours, sucking Sherlock’s prick. Sherlock, for his part, was kneeling, leaning backward onto John’s tongue which was lapping the filth from his dripping hole.
“I said, ‘Inside, Sherlock. Come inside me, please.’”
The morning after a chilly case. Johnlock. Morning sex. Anal. POV Sherlock.
“All done? Storm’s not letting up, so, you can stay the night, but in the morning, you’d best be off. Come, I’ll make a nice bed for you."
It was theatrical, larger-than-life, the kind of stabbing they wrote myths about and sculpted statues of and reenacted with taut-strung symphonies in the background.
John pushed Sherlock to the ground, then scented him, nuzzling, licking, every nook and cranny of Sherlock’s body. Armpits. Ears. Backs of knees. Creases of thighs.
“Well. Busy.”
“I knew it! Damn it!”
“And you shall have them, my beloved,” he replied with bow and a gallant kiss of my gloved hand. “Mrs. Hudson is visiting her sister, and we are at liberty to be…”
He appears from behind a hedge, grinning, his eyes aflame with mischief. The hem of his nightdress is peeking from beneath a great overcoat. His hands are curled as if holding invisible reins.
And John can’t help but drop his head and watch and groan. He catches Sherlock watching, too. Beefy red, swollen, leaking cocks. One thick; one long and lean.
My mind floats.
Molly felt her eyelids droop as her body warmed to his wet touch. She took her hand from him and laid it across his shoulder, then laid her head on his chest.
He smiled, sunk into the seat and waited for the line, the first of his many favourites.
“Come on, Sherlock,” said John.
Pam grimaced. “I’ll pass.”
Sawing? Cutting? Slicing?
“Come on, then.”
“Indeed.”

A lie was on the tip of Mycroft’s tongue.
Molly wrapped her arms round his neck and buried her face in his neck.
Mycroft shrugged, then he cast a sly look at Lestrade. “You can make it up to me.”
“Fuck, Sebby!”
“Where’d you get those?”
“Nope.”
“I wish.”
any measure that keeps you
He replied cryptically,
“…it was an effective treatment, sir, that you chose to pour it into your ear instead of ingest is a deficiency on your part.”
Mycroft tilted his head back and rested it on the leather seat. He gazed up at the green-leafed canopy. There was a light breeze, and a few tiny pink petals brushed his face. He smiled.
“I know. I had to queue!”

“I am also honest. And curious. There’s a change that interests me more than difference between John Watson in the photograph and the one before me. That battered dispatch case has been gathering dust in Mrs. Hudson’s lumber room for more than a year, since the very day you arrived, but today, you have not only opened it, but you have elected to share an item of its contents with me. Singular, indeed. You needn’t answer the question, but I must ask it. Why?”
“No.”
Mycroft frowned. “No, I don’t mind…Daddy?”
“Christ, you’re gorgeous. They do sparkle and quite nicely. Sensitive?”
“I confess I’ve been pondering the possibilities too. Researching devices online.”
Sherlock led John to something.
Rating: Gen
“Why do you want me sober?” I asked between gulps of the coldest water I’d ever tasted.
She was mounting Sherlock, pinning her, filling her with a stallion-sized cock, bucking into her, spending seed inside her, snorting in her ear.
“I wonder if there’s anything fun in his drawer.” There was the sound of wood sliding. “Oh, lubie! And, oh, my!”
“What’s the point of this dress,” said Sally, reaching behind Jeanine to unzip and unhook, “if not to force you to buy a hideously expensive, ridiculously-engineered bra? There. Corset-style. Lovely.”
Warm, wet, wide, and soft.
“I had to consider what kind of person would be able to execute such maneuvers. Secondly, the shape of the wounds suggested a certain type of blade. That narrowed the field, too.”
“I wouldn’t go empty-handed,” said Holmes. “In fact, I think I have just the ice-breaking gift.” He rose and hunted about underneath the desk. “It was given to me by a grateful client.”
I closed my eyes and was kissed good night by the sweet strains of a violin.
Holmes strode closer, crowding me, until my back was to the wall. “We have one at Baker Street. It’s only proper we should have one here,” he said huskily. “Shall we christen it now?”
“The things you learn on Youtube,” groaned Stella.
Molly and Jim have a romantic evening. Pegging.
Yes, cake was far superior in every respect, for cake did
“Yes,” replied Sherlock.
Jeanine pouted, then she kissed Sally. “Things might get strange, but just know there’ll be space in the back of a closet in a cottage on the Sussex Downs for a Mimosa, a Bellini, and a Flamingo Piss Punch.”
I turned my head. “And you are thinking of your bees, just waking up from their long nap.”
But that was all.
I shall die with my face to the sun!
“Jigsaw puzzle.”
He shook his head. “No, you are mine to cherish.”
“Very well.”
“You’re a demon?” interrupted Sherlock.
“Come back here!”
“It’s Walpurgisnacht. Something of a feast day.”
At this, he blinked tears that he didn’t not have.
Now for shine.
Lestrade stirred the contents of the paper cup with a red-and-white-striped stick while he spoke.
“You’ve been hurting for a long time, Holmes. I wanted to help you lay the pain of Openshaw to rest once and for all. And conventional measures or advice seem utterly ridiculous. But if it changes anything, I did not pay them to lose. I merely paid them not to kill you. Please,” he said, tenderly brushing Holmes's hair from his face, “you were human. It was a tragedy. And so it goes.”
He frowned. “Really?”
“Well, do it out here!”
“Hello, Detective Inspector. Wonderful to see you this evening, sir.”
“Show off.”
Jim was an Alpha. He could go to an exclusive Milk Bar which catered to a wealthy Alpha clientele and pretend to scratch specific, Alpha itch.
“I am close, but Gregory, it would be selfish, not to say unchivalrous, for me to invite you to dinner…”
And, as Holmes could never resist an experiment, in those nine weeks, he’d obviously been applying the suggested techniques, whatever they were.
“My parents were, in fact, married Jim.”
"Fuck, yeah."
Something in the pile was moving! Johnlock. Zombie Apocalypse AU. Alt First Mtg. Nipple play.
He nudged Mycroft’s legs apart and drew out a small bottle of lubricant from his pocket. Soon he was pushing silk aside and teasing Mycroft’s hole with the slicked head of his cock.
Led by the festive sound of rustic bagpipes,
“Um, have you visited the dry sauna?” asked Mycroft.
“Who?”
“That bedsit isn’t home. My plan might be dangerous.”
“Eighteen.  His orders?”
“Ah. He’s a,” Lestrade frowned, “sexy insect? Bee?”
“Holmes, that’s extraordinary.”
“Yes. Shall I meet you in the lounge in, say, quarter of hour?”
Our hearts beat in irregular staccatos.
apricotic apoplexy
She was sitting on his face, cycling through another orgasm. She lifted herself off him, bracing one hand on the wall. She looked down.
Out of the corner of my eye, I saw their faces.
“Are you always this bossy?” John glanced at the windows. “And messy?”
“John?”
Holmes, for his part as host, took up the cigar box and lifted the lid, presenting the box’s aromatic contents, rows of tightly wound leaf with gold bands, to their guest, giving a bow that was slight but replete with courtly grace.
“Fucking you in the club while I switched the data stored in the mark’s mobile.”
And with that, he forgot all about Chester.
“I know! And I’m dripping all over your nice—”
“Listen, this may be a very stupid thing for me to say, but when this case is over, when it’s all done, I’m going to go home and have a shower and a ten-hour nap and a shave and a meal that I don’t eat standing up with one hand.”
I noted a curl of that same grey mist which had swirled before my eyes in my Kensington study and, were I not already seated, might have tottered on my feet.
“No. Drop your guns first.”
A pair of raindrops struck Lestrade’s sleeve.
As always, John understood. She barked, then smiled and said,
“I’m surprised you made it,” said John.
Three thrusts and he’s being filled.
“I heard you coming.”
You once wrote me a similar letter, and I confess I did not appreciate the agony it caused you until this very moment. You lied for your reasons, and they brought us both sorrow. I lied for my own and expect no less.
Molly looked down at Seb, who was looking up at her and grinning. “When I saw you coming through the ceiling of the lift in uniform…”
They cleaned up and had a quick but hearty meal which ended with another round of John’s spiced hot cocoa and Lestrade’s fondling hand nestled in John’s red pants.
He should’ve called. At first, he’d waited on purpose, thinking he’d seem too eager. And then there was that problem with Sherlock which consumed his attention for the better part of a week. And then, when things had finally settled, it seemed it was too late. He didn’t know what to say. Or what to do. Or how to start. And with every day that passed, and no word from Gregory, either, well…
