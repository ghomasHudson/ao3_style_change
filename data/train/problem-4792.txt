“I’d like you to pitch this idea to Dean while he’s at the summit.  Maybe if we can get a wider variety of Alphas, there will be more of a choice and a better outcome for an Omega to find a scent that helps them.  If it works, we can then test it out on young Alphas,” she said.
“And I thought Bobby was a dick sometimes,” Benny said, blinking a few times.
Mentions of torture, slavery, and non-con elements are present in this chapter.
Castiel groaned at the smells coming from the grills, “Oh God, please tell me someone is making Brahmin burgers…” he said, damn near drooling right there on the spot.
“Are...are you sure?” Castiel asked, eyes going wide and wet yet again.  The number of times he'd cried in front of Dean already was almost humiliating but he couldn't deny how good it felt to have Dean cup his face and wipe the tears away with a soft brush of fingers.  If Dean was willing to stay here with him then Castiel was more than willing to try for him, to go to Sanctuary Hills and meet Dean’s family.
Castiel licked his dry lips and looked over at Dean, a silent understanding passing between them.  They hadn’t even dropped their last bombshell yet.
Dean blinked. “How do you know my name?”
When Cas woke up, it was still early enough that he should have been first, but Dean’s side of the bed was already empty. Cas smiled to himself; Dean had been planning Jack’s birthday since before Sam’s birthday had ended. One had to wonder if he had even slept at all, or simply lain awake with excitement like a child on Christmas Eve.
"Just good?"
Garth's face lit up once again as he nearly guffawed himself out of his seat. "Well of
Cas smiled lightly again, and Dean felt him twine their fingers together. He instantly loved the new sensation of the ring pushing into his hand.
“In a minute,” she smiled. “Jack and I have to get changed.”
Dean brought his own hand up to Cas's cheek, lightly brushing dark hair from his temple again. He stared long, like he always did, and then kissed Cas sweet and firm, which still felt new and holy every time.
This time it was Cas who pulled him in.
Dean stopped so quickly Cas could practically hear a tire screech from under his feet.
I gotta kick your ass in Mario Kart, but I’ll be damned if we don’t get through the droid factory this weekend.”
—he also knew he had already learned the very best thing he would ever feel:
He had always loved being barefoot; it was probably his favorite thing about taking a human vessel. Being able to feel rough stone, soft dirt,
“Heya, buddy!” Garth called up. In response, Jack’s hand- as if by miracle- seemed to double in waves-per-second. Before his eyes could burst out of his head, though, the famed Miss Carlisle took to the podium, cueing the house lights down.
“DeeeeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!” was the harsh but welcome first thing to greet the boy’s ears when he walked in the front door that night.
Dean couldn’t help but let up a smile of his own at the sight of it all, but then he remembered the ring in his hand and practically jumped from where he had been sitting on the edge of the bed.
Dean still couldn't quite believe Garth was a real person, even after all these years; his spunk to size ratio was simply unparalleled.
“Dean,” Cas heard himself beam.
The next morning, Dean was up before the sun. By 5:30, he was at the studio and warming up. He rarely complained about these early mornings, even to himself, because he couldn’t really think of another way he’d rather start the day anyway. The only real downside was that Jo had to drive her and Sammy to school in an old beater from the scrapyard on Wednesdays and Fridays, but they always pretended to enjoy it. ("It's nice to have some time alone to bitch about our dumb big brother," Jo once shrugged). They were sweet like that.
” until they could fall back asleep.)
Dean reached up to trace a finger behind Castiel's ear, almost tucking a lock of hair that wasn't quite long enough to stay put. He would cut it for him soon. Cas smiled- just the tiniest bit- in his sleep.
“Or- I mean- we could let ‘em sleep,” Dean conceded, but his face fell noticeably.
“Thanks,” Dean responded in kind, a little too quickly. He felt a heat creep over the back of his neck and fought the urge to look down. He always looked away when people complimented him, and it was a habit he needed to break.
"He told me to let go of the leash. It's just so hard. Every molecule in my body tells me to protect him, to shield him, but he is not the little boy anymore who wanted piggyback rides or couldn't eat ice cream without smearing his face. He is all grown up and still angry with me", Dean admits to the angel before him.
So when Lisa tells him to go and still be there for Ben, he doesn’t hesitate, hoping that hunting will have him cross paths with his angel again.
Cas head starts bobbing. His tongue flattens and he takes Dean deeper. As an angel he has two big advantages, he doesn’t need air and gag reflex is out of question. Dean feels the head pushing against the back of Cas’ throat with every bob. His hips twitching out of control being stopped from thrusting in his mouth by a strong hand holding him down. Cas’ tongue follows the vein of his cock every time he pulls back swirling the head before swallowing his dick again.
“I’m not stubborn. I’m realistic. It's better this way. He can move on.”
“Ash, go to yellow alert and call every crew member you can to engineering and get my engine back. Jo, be ready to get this ship out as soon as we crash. Sam prep the transporter with Ash for maximum processing. I’ll go down to the Impala and give her one last checkup. Meet me there in 10 minutes.” Dean paused.
“Great ... Well, we’re on the road now; so can you tell me what’s going on. Who was that? ... Why was he ... naked.” Dean replies. Castiel turns, eyes fixed on the rearview mirror.
Castiel flashes back to sitting in the back of the Impala. Dean's hand is on his shoulder.
Space, Cas noted, always had a blue tone to it when there was a funeral. The stars burned a little cooler and the space dwelling specks steered clear of the USS Argenteus. The ship was on course back to Starfleet Command where Castiel’s sister would join him in sending Samandriel off in a proper Starfleet funeral. Dean had been following Cas around when he wasn't on duty for the past few days, bothering him about everything. Really though, Dean wanted Cas to feel something other than guilt. Cas had been pretty mellow since his freak out in sick bay - which is common for Cas - but it was the kind of mellow that made Dean and even the rest of the crew wary. Dean really just wanted to see Cas smile again. Not a cheeky little up turn of the lips, but a full ear to ear smile. The last time Cas smiled like that was when he found out he'd be serving on Dean's ship. That was three years ago. Dean still kicks himself for not taking a picture.
"No, to the potty Sam, yes to the moon."
"Dean!" Castiel yells, his face moving to terror.
“Don’t talk about yourself like that aroud me anymore. I will not allow it.”
"You really think you should take her place?" Cas said, furrowing his brow.
"You know when I first met you, you were just this machine, but you were always ... you cared. Somehow. I never understood why ... not until ... " Dean stops as his eyes flick to Castiel as he licks his lips. "Uh. I was stubborn. It's gonna take a lot ... you know. I'm not the best listener back then."
"We can still use the card like this. Just not very often. One day we may need to resort to other means of acquiring goods." Castiel says.
“Come on, Dean.”
"I'm on my way, keep on them. Get a tractor beam on them if you have to. Do
"Cas?" Dean said. He reached for the silver knob of the door, but just as he touched the cool metal, a scream and another crash erupted from behind the door.
let him leave." Dean said facing Cas, just outside of his quarters.
“Computer, Evassive Manuver Delta Six.” Dean spat out.
“Dad said that?” Dean asked.
"Commander Winchester to any Security personel, report to Castiel's quarters immediately. Set phasers to stun. He may be dangerous."
"Yes you can. Concentrate. You can push him out." Dean said.
"I’m not trying to be a hero. I’m trying to do the right thing. Besides, wasn't it your hero who said 'the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few … or the one'." Dean said biting his lip and raising his brows. Cas lips twitched into a small smile, but it faded quickly as he spoke again, making sure to stare straight at Dean.
“We got us.” Dean said still looking at Sam.
"Finish it," Uriel says, taking a gun from the ground and putting it in Castiel's hands. "End this now. We have wasted too much time on this human and he is a weakness to us. To the future. If you want any part in that, Unit 13. Think of the legacy. We tame humanity in a way no one has and we rebuild the world the way we want it. End this now, Unit 13." Uriel says his hands in front of him punching the air.
Castiel lets the shotgun fall to his side as he moves closer to Dean.
Dean looks at him, sun shining on his face. He notices the way his eyelids droop and the way his lips spread across his face. His throat runs dry as Cas’ last words to him before the empty took him, play in his head. Cas starts to walk forward but Dean puts out a hand, grabs Cas' trench, and swings his arm back. Cas stops in his tracks and faces Dean.
“Shields down to 63 percent and dropping. We’re gonna be dead in the water soon Dean.”
"I am
“Dean!”
"Yes, give it to me," Castiel says.
“Dean. That is not your burden to carry.”
Dean stammered grasping for an answer. There it was again, the voice in his head, prodding him. What could Cas possibly have that would make him better.
The last time Dean had seen his father, their meeting had started as a conversation about duty and responsibility and ended when John had landed a blow that broke Dean's nose. That was 11 years ago when Dean graduated from Starfleet Academy.
- If he could say those words without attaching a job to them, maybe Cas would listen. Cas finally looked up and leaned forward, pleading.
"I am fine." Castiel says, voice deep, tight and balled up like his fists. Castiel reminds himself he could disarm Rufus if he needed to. Easily.
"I don't want - " Dean whispered leaning towards Cas.
say anything?”
Castiel stares back at Dean. It's familiar somehow, standing opposite Dean. Like he's been here before, with just a short barrier between them.
"Dean, I said hold still." Cas said staring down at the tri-corder in his hand. Dean chuckled, looking away.
“Sam, get us away from this planet, and scan for Borg activity.”
“No one else in Starfleet can either, Admiral. Our attempts to deal with them have been hail-mary plays. We barely get out alive. I have the only link to bring Lucifer down.”
“I would like a tour of the ship. A little distraction before the funeral rites would be pleasant. Would either of you mind showing me around?”
There he saw the two brothers, one clutching his leg sitting on a bio bed, the other with a hand on the former’s shoulder. Both looked up. Sam smiled through his pain and Dean let a grin spread on his face.
“Sir?” She replied.
He aims and lets off two shots at Gadreel. One nicks his ankle while the other hit his arm. Gadreel slows to a jog now, not able or not willing to keep up with the vehicle. Castiel knows the civilians, like that woman, leaving their homes for work, seeing a 6' tall naked man running down the street is going to draw too much attention for a Terminator. Castiel leans back in.
just fifty light-years away, and it
“Of course she does Dean, genetically she is Betazoid and Vul…”
-----
"That's not his name asshole." Dean says.
“But, you’re not going alone.” Sam added crossing his arms and stepping to intercept Dean.
“Save him” Sam hears himself say first. “Save him Cas, please.” His voice shakes as his vision blurs with tears.
“This vehicle.” He pauses laying a hand on the dashboard. “A 1967 Chevy Impala that was given to you by your father. You never let anyone drive it and ... you call it 'baby'.” Castiel replies. Dean comes to a stop at a stoplight. He turns his head slowly to Castiel, brows furrowed.
Castiel keeps walking, scanning road signs until he sees a large limestone building that seems to be a focal point of this area. He stops in his tracks in front of the building, scanning and rescanning the title. "Lawrence Library” with a slogan below that reads “ The pride of Lawrence, Kansas”.
“I have a guest coming in 10 minutes, Dean. My sister - Anna. Then I have to meet with Bobby to go over the biological components of his newest weapon for our Borg mission – the colt. I will not have time for a ‘cold one’ before we are in range. As the Captain, you really should not be encouraging drinking on the job.” Cas said as he walked to the transporter.
"I don't have a choice, Dean," Castiel says, turning back, glancing at his bloody hand.
Dean's lips curl down as he cocks his head to one side. His eyes finally leave the tweezers.
Castiel made it to the sick bay door and it slid open. Cas closed his eyes and took a breath. He opened them and looked up.
"Uh ... yeah ... Uh The uh bunkmates, we were like a family. There was this scrawny kid, Garth. Ugh ... He was in way over his head but he didn't give up, not once. Everyone gave him shit but by the end of it, he was the one giving out advice and making an impression. I think he's a park ranger now in Colorado. Got a wife and kids and everything."
"You comin, Cas?" Dean says. Castiel snaps to reality and nods.
"Oh ... thanks Ensign." Dean said, taking the new uniform and hopping off the bed.
"We've found it. We've found the Auruto."
“First, Let me help you,” Cas says as he walks forward and puts a hand on Dean's shoulder. He takes a moment for himself to look at Dean but he can’t look too long before more tears threaten to fall.
"Dean, Dean, Dean. You talk so big for someone who has already lost. As we speak the very thing you are trying to avenge is already losing control."
He’s here to protect Dean Winchester.
"Sam, Cas, please join me in my ready room." Dean said. The two men shared looks as they followed Dean. Once inside Dean's ready room, Dean went straight to the replicator. Castiel strolled to the window and waited while Sam stood with crossed arms in front of Dean's desk.
Dean rolls his eyes and runs his palms through his hair.
Lucifer continued taking steps to Dean stopping inches in front of him.
to talk about. Look, all that stuff is … is just stuff. Okay?" Dean said, still not looking at Sam.
“Who sent you here?” Dean asks.
"It's three simple words, Dean." Sam said tilting his head.
"Captain, we're being hailed. It's them."
“Castiel to the crew, Sam and Dean are alive.”
"Dad wants to see me." Dean said, putting a hand up.
He steps forward, next to Dean as Rufus presses the down button. The elevator is quiet as the lights flicker for a moment. Castiel looks back over his shoulder to Rufus, who isn't taking his eyes off of Castiel. Dean seems to be none the wiser, focused solely on his leg. Castiel slowly looks back forward as the doors scroll open. As they do, the florescent lights flicker to life. The cement hallway in front of them is so similar to the bunkers in the future. Theres a metal archway leading to a large room at the end of the hallway and heavy metal doors on either side of the hallway. Rufus pulls Dean towards one of the side doors and pushes it open. Castiel follows behind but stops short of the door. Looking into the side room he sees a fully stocked home made operation room. Theres shelves full of bandages and first aid kits and a few cots. Anything you could think of. Castiel watches Rufus help Dean up onto a bed. Castiel hears a click to his left, the dark room at the end of the hallway being the source of the sound. Castiel turns slowly and peers down. He moves towards the metal archway and starts to see the gleam of metal on the walls and the smell of gunpowder. He tries to run a scan but gets a garbled reading back.
Castiel fires and doesn't stop firing until he can shove Dean out of the room. He isn't sure if he hit anyone, but he doesn't care. As soon as the two are out of the shooting range Castiel loops an arm under Dean's and half carries him to one of the nearby exits. It's heavily guarded but the gun cuts through the human augmented guards like butter.
"As I said before, as your doctor I must know all there is to know about everyone in my charge."
“Right. Sam you have the bridge.”
The two find themselves trapped between a rock and a hard place while Castiel grapples with things that have not yet come to pass.
It never comes because soon the sunlight shines through the cave and the old Dean is gone. The Dean that runs, hides, and kills during the day is a hard shell, the one that won't crack under the pressure of the apocalypse. Especially the one in his own head.
"Not longer than me," Castiel says.
"Cas." Dean shouted. The name echoed against the window and the walls and returned to him with nothing. Dean scanned the walls of the library for anything and then he spotted it. Not a door or anything that would help him figure out where the hell Cas was, but his own name scrawled onto the spine of a large leather bound book sitting on a black marble table. He looked at the other books around him and saw names, some familiar some foreign, but none the size of the book that held his name.
Then fire.
"It always does," Castiel says, still staring out the glass wall.
"That's so helpful. Thanks." Dean smacks his hands against the blankets and crosses his arms.
“Look Sam. You should stay behind.” Dean said.
"To the moon?" Sam asked.
“I want to fight them because they want to assimilate me and Sam. They won’t stop, Dad. Not until they’re dead. Besides, you just want me to go hunt down the Romulans, because of mom.”
“Atta boy Sammy. Let’s kill us a Borg King!” Dean grinned and turned toward Kevin, ready to open a hailing frequency.
-----
"I've gone on harder missions before."
Castiel stands to his full height and almost makes himself wider but pushing his arms against the sides of his body. Dean looks to Castiel now standing like an immovable force in front of him as bullets rake across his back. Dean can feel his mouth fall open, can feel his hearing go someplace else, to his own heartbeat. Castiel is like a statue in front of him, one that won't budge, even if the bullets tear him in half, even with his face wrenching up. Castiel will not give up, he won't let Dean die.
"It's fine." Castiel slices across his palm width wise, just below the fingers.
“What do you mean you can’t, Cas. Why the hell are you here? I’m begging you, you can’t do this to me.” Sam feels the anger biting at his throat. “Why did you even come back.”
Castiel pulls over and stops, gets out of the car, and opens the backseat. He forgot how much blood had pooled back here. His sensors couldn't pick up the thick iron scent until just now. Dean's covered in it and the smell wafts to him. Dean looks up at Castiel.
"Dean. Wait." Castiel follows him closer now focusing on the phone. "It's not just Sam. You can't call anyone. That phone is useless now. Gadreel will try to access wireless databases to locate you. It's a literal beacon telling him where you are." He finishes.
He wanted to laugh at the word. Dean looked down and then to the ceiling, reeling himself back.
"I can generate extremely close approximations of human emotions," Castiel says, his voice quiet. "It's the best I can do."
"Dean, please stop joking for one moment and tell me why you're doing this." Cas said, tilting his head.
Dean missed this. The playful bantering, the good stuff. And then it dawned on him. He stared at Cas, his saviour, as the whisper in his mind grew louder and louder. Though Dean would never admit it, he knew there was a feeling that was catching like fire, and it had been a slow burn, probably since the Academy days. It was like a burn in his stomach that stretched to every nerve now. He thought back to the staring contests, the telepathy and it all fit into place. It made sense, but at the same time it was terrifying. Two men thrown together by a wagon train to the stars.
“I need a name if I’m gonna give you my gun and take orders from you,” Dean says turning another corner. "This is a Winchester family heirloom, man." He says, slapping the barrel of the shotgun.
“I want to meet her,” Dean said innocently, “Besides you still haven’t answered me. Don’t make me order you.” Cas sighed and entered the transporter room. He gave a nod to the man at the computer. The pair stood at the pads waiting for the communiqué from Starfleet.
“Nothing, Dean.” Dean stared at Sam for a moment before standing and walking to the door.
“Dean, this is not your problem to fix.” John took a few steps around the desk till he was directly in front of Dean. “I don't want to have to demote you.” Dean stood slowly and nodded, not looking at his father. Dean turned to leave, but John grabbed his arm. He pulled Dean back until he was toe to toe with him and tightened his grip. He spoke in a lower voice. “This is your job,
Dean's third year came and Cas got assigned as a field medic on a six-month training mission on Betazed. Dean thought he could handle the ‘seperation’. It
Next to the door is a small doorbell that Dean puts a finger to. A sound echoes in the dark room beyond the door.
The admiral had hidden the specifics in layer upon layer of Starfleet favors. Even Sam didn't know what happened, just the ship name and the basics. Dean was going to come up with a random answer when Castiel spoke from the far end of the room. He had been staring out the window until now.
"I know, you all have worked your asses off, but this is direct."
“This is the Lieutenant Fitz of the U.S.S Argenteus to the shuttle craft Impala do you read me, Captain?”
"Cas, let's go!"
“You're really gonna make me talk about this, huh." Dean asked, forcing a chuckle. Cas raised his eyebrows. Dean huffed and leaned on the console.
"What's the password?" The voice calls back.
“Bad things happen Sam. People don’t always survive.” Dean said peering out the window. Sam sighed and turned back to his console. Another minute of silence passed before Sam spoke again.
"Yes, but we need to move quickly. I can try to mask it in the system but Gadreel could be tracking your card."
Dean thought.
"It's ..." Dean coughs. "It's your na..." Dean struggles to take a breath, gulping hard. Unit 13 could feel the muscles tense under his hands.
"I ... was programmed to kill but I couldn't kill one target. I couldn't pull the trigger. I ... " Castiel stops and whips his head around as he hears the distant revving of a motor. He scans the highway and sees Gadreel, finally wearing clothes. He sits atop a large motorcycle and has started merging to take the exit toward the rest stop.
Dean was silent, but he heard Cas mumbling behind him. He recognized his words as a Vulcan prayer of focus. He tried to heed Cas’ words, tried to push Lucifers words out. He felt a churning in his stomach. Dean watched Lucifers’ stoic face twist into a grin, stretched and pointed, just like his ears.
"Dean, you're drawing too much attention," Castiel says.
“Open a channel.” Dean ordered
"I don't know."
"You can't kill me, you need me. I'm the only one..." Dean says, his voice deeper and ragged.
“Sam stay with me, thats an order! Officer Winchester Wake up, now! Don't you die on me yet Commander!” Dean said, reaching for the med kit behind him, and pulling out a cloth. He stumbled to Sam and tied it around his leg.
"Are you sure you're ok, man?" Dean puts a hand up and almost lays it on Castiel's shoulder. He doesn't get the chance to because a bullet flies past his head, missing by only a foot or so. It strikes the brick facade of the back with a crack. "Shit" Dean yells, whipping his head around. Castiel does the same. They scan the street next to them.
"I am. I'm human there's ... "
“Hailing frequencies open, sir. He’s not responding, but he can hear you.”
“Dean, you’ve seen me at my worst. You’ve seen me scared, you just didn’t realize it.”
Dean sighs and takes another drink.
“I will join you in the mess hall for lunch, Anna, we can discuss the details of the funeral then.” Cas said. Anna nodded and smiled at him. More silence rang between them and Dean craned his neck ever so slightly trying to hear what couldn’t be heard. Cas left the transporter room. Dean turned his attention back to Anna.
“Fine.” Dean figured he find someway to get Sam off the shuttle before it was too late.
“I said, got it?” The man nodded.
Another firecracker went off. Only this time it was outside of the ship, and it wasn’t a firecracker. It was a photon charge aimed directly at the shuttles nacelles. Smaller Borg cubes started appearing just behind Lucifers, and they were closing in fast.
Dean and Cas turned to face the sound and there they saw Lucifer. He didn't look like the Borg he was. He wore a simple white shirt and black slacks. He was the man he used to be, when he was just Castiel's brother. Lucifer’s hard gaze softened a bit when he saw Cas.
Castiel can hear the click of the door lock and Dean's heart rate rises. Castiel turns back to the car and grabs for the handle. Dean rolls the window down only an inch.
“Sammy, don’t you start with the goodbyes.” Dean said putting a hand over Sammy’s shoulder. Sam laughed a bit.
“Cas, shut up,” Dean says. He looks down and feels his face growing redder. Cas’ brow furrows. Dean raises his head to meet Cas’ gaze. “Seriously. Look I know I haven’t always been an open book. I know I haven’t always been good to you. But you, Cas? You’ve always been there through the good shit and the bad. And there was a whole lotta bad. The point is, I … I don’t know where I’d be without you. You changed me, Cas.” Dean's voice was shaking. He lets his arms hang at his sides, putting all energy into his words, putting everything into his words. “I … I love you, too, Cas, of course, I do. I’m sorry it took me this long to say it.”
"I guessed he would be. He was the same when our parents passed."
"I ... your ch... " Dean starts close enough to Unit 13 that they can feel their breath on their synthetic skin.
Dean thought.
"Don't stress your back, and yes. The phaser burns were nearly fatal, but luckily I got you back in time. Now lay on your side and hold still." Dean leaned on his arm, letting air touch his bare back.
“You misunderstand me, Captain. I was like you once. Average, nothing special. Except for my powers. Our father, for some bizarre reason, wanted me in Starfleet. I couldn't stand the monotony. Sure space travel is exciting, but where's the fun in just exploring, when I could just take so easily? So I dropped out. As I experimented with my powers I found my body just wasn't enough to power me. So I voluntarily assimilated. At first, I didn't remember who I was. But, when the Borg Queen died, myself and several other drones were severed from the collective. In a last ditch effort to save our species, we formed our own, and I became King. I have more power than you can imagine. Just imagine if I assimilated Earth, or Vulcan, or Betazed how powerful I'd be. How important I'd be. No one would forget me. No one could tell me what to do. If I assimilated you and your brother, you could be my right hand men. Sam the genius, and you, the battering ram. We'd be the most feared creatures this side of the universe. What's more important in the long run, Dean - feeling like nothing, or feeling like something?”
“I fail to see the humor in embarrassment.” Cas seethed.
"I ... yeah. I ... that was a long time ago, and I never got shot. Sure as hell didn't think my first time it'd be like this." He says wiping his brow. "Guy didn't even buy me dinner first."
Unit 13 tilts their head at Dean and watches as the shaking extends to the rest of him. This human does not appear to have suffered major injuries, but they are still ... showing signs of pain. Crying. Heaving breaths. Elevated heart rate. Excessive Sweating.
"Life is full of no win situations. That doesn't mean you throw in the towel. Screw Dad and his stupid orders, I know you Dean, and this isn't you. You're jumpy. You're on edge. Whatever happened on the Durus has got you wound up so tight, you won't listen to anyone, not even us. Let someone help you for once, Dean." Sam said. Dean, hated to admit it, but Sam was right. This mission, his fathers orders, everything was getting ready to collapse on Dean. He opened his mouth, but nothing came out. He searched his brain for some sort of rebuttal, but came back again with nothing.
Dean sits against a cold concrete wall in a cave that's mostly underground. Castiel sits next to him, shoulders almost touching. There's one entrance into a larger cave system, but over the years, explosions have blasted away at the cave roof. As holes appeared, Castiel would shove steel plates or thick dark bulletproof glass into them, making small makeshift skylights. It wasn’t much but it's all they had.
"You're sorry! Sorry doesn't bring her back! She's dead now!" Dean felt his knuckles crack and bones shift under his fists. The man was slumped over still breathing only barely.
Silence crawls across them. They stare into each other's eyes.
Dean lets out a wince that's muffled by the towel. He slams a fist against the passenger seat in front of him. Castiel pulls the towel back and tosses it into another bag. He grabs another towel and wipes at the wound. Blood has stopped pouring out of it, so Castiel grabs the large tweezers and leans down close to Dean's wound. His sensors still aren't working as they should, so Castiel has to recall as much first aid training as he can. He looks at the wound as he takes a lighter and passes the flame over the tweezers. He takes the tweezers and dives in, moving skin and muscle aside. Dean's back arches and his face scrunches up as he lets out a muffled yell.
“No, Dean. It’s alright. You are my Captain and I will follow your orders as I always have. However, I feel the need to remind you that I am also your friend, not your weapon.”
“I’m not that great of a teacher, Cas. I mean, have you met me?”
Silence hung again.Garth’s voice broke through on the comm.
“Cas, that’s not how this is. You know that.”
He doesn't have time to think about it because Dean is still breathing, still moving, still alive. The bullet grazed his shoulder. There's blood and the twist in Dean's face shows real pain, but the wound isn't fatal. Castiel pulls on the gun still in Gadreels hand and shoves Dean away, putting himself between the two.
“Typical.” Sam mumbled punching more buttons. Dean sighed.
Then the alley.
Dean closes his gas cap and cocks his head at Castiel.
“Yes, I do.”
“I’m … I’m going to get Sam today Dean.”
"Lucifer is charging his weapons, and changing course to Earth." Victor growled from his post. Dean put his hands on his hips and stared at the Borg cube. This was a game for Lucifer. Just a game. Dean connected the dots in his mind and spoke.
“Bingo.”
“I know, but I did the same thing for my Kobayashi Maru test. It worked. Trust me.” Dean tried his best to plaster a look of optimism to his face. Though he had succeeded in saving his crew back in the Academy, there was something he wasn’t spilling. Something he had to keep from his crew, for their safety. Sam turned back and Dean raised his brows in hope. Sam nodded and looked to the crew.
“You need to get in the escape pod, Sam.”
“Guess, Sam. Make sure the rest of the crew is briefed on our mission. Have Charlie run the necessary diagnostics to be battle ready by the time we reach the planet. You’ve got the bridge. I’ll be back when I’m back.”
“It's open." The voice crackles through the speaker one last time.
He stands to his full height and scans his immediate surroundings. He's warped into an alley behind a few small restaurants and stores. His clothes didn't make the jump, so he’ll need something to blend in. He starts walking and notes nothing else is damaged.
"She died because of me." Dean said, as he looked up to stare at the large screen. Cas shook his head and touched a few buttons on the console, shutting down the screen, leaving it blank. No distractions. Cas turned back to Dean and crossed his arms. Dean hung his head and rubbed a hand across his neck. He turned around and leaned back on the console.
"What the hell are you waiting for boy, let's go get the bastards." The crew laughed and Dean nodded as he stood to address each member of the bridge crew.
“I do, I trust you. I just hope you’re as lucky as Ambassador Spock was all those years ago.” Cas said, squinting at Dean. Dean turned away and gestured to the Impala’s console.
He heard footfalls behind him and he turned to look. He saw shadows moving against the hall. He turned back and the stench of blood on his hand hit him, shattering his hallucination. He looked to his hands and to the man barely breathing below him. John's grinning face was gone, and in its place was a bloody Romulan mess. Dean felt his throat close up a bit. He reached down to touch the man’s neck checking for a pulse. It was there, only barely.
"You're one of them aren't you." Rufus says. Castiel hears the click of a safety latch on the shotgun. "A Terminator."
The other Terminator with his body stiff like a missile, careening in from the parking garage. The next thing Castiel knows, he’s throwing himself through the window and sprinting past Dean. He picks up an old muffler and looks back over his shoulder and yells.
"Bite down on that." Castiel goes back in the bag to pull out a bottle of iodine solution, large tweezers, dental floss, and a travel sewing kit. "This might sting." He takes one of the black towels and soaks it in Iodine. He presses it into the wound.
“Computer, locate Commander Castiel.” He said in a defeated voice.
“Cas, I know you hate it, and believe me I agree, it's the craziest thing we’ve ever done. But crazy comes with the job, right?” Dean said forcing a smile and stepping into the Impala. Cas shook his head as he followed Dean. Dean sat at the helm and brought the Impala online and started punching buttons, turning his back to Cas who stood in the middle of the Impala, staring daggers at the back of Dean's head.
"Well, it's creepy. I can't sleep like this. I bet I’d sleep better in the car." Dean says laying on his back, staring at the ceiling. Silence takes the room quickly until the only sound is traffic from the highway a few streets over. Dean opens his mouth a few times, maybe trying to start different sentences and failing to complete the first sound. He finally manages ...
“What do you m … ” Dean hadn’t realized, but they had walked the entire ship and ended up right at the mess hall, and he could see Cas sitting inside waiting. It must’ve been an hour.
"I am ...  I am begging you. Please ... Let me in." Castiel says, the last few words coming out as more of a growl than he intends.
“How are we on shields, Sam?”
“It’s ok Cas, you’re ok.” Dean said quietly. Cas wasn’t much of a hugger (or a crier for that matter), even when it was important, so Dean knew Castiel’s arms would stay slack at his sides as his tears soaked through Dean's uniform. The whisper in Dean's subconscious was there - barely audible, telling him something he probably already knew. He pushed it away again. Cas’ tears had ceased and he slowly leaned back, pausing for just a moment an inch from Dean’s face, before sitting all the way up and wiping his face.
“Dean, for the last time. I’m not going.”
great deal. You are a good person. You can deny it and say that you're worthless but I know at least a solar systems worth of life-forms who think otherwise. Forget what your father says. You are a Starfleet Captain. You put on that uniform and you represent something, Dean. You represent goodness and hope. The very nature of Starfleet cries out for those things. Yet, you still don't believe that you are good. It is illogical to say the least."
So, Dean lied.
Only one other word was printed across the page. One word. A word that Dean knew he had heard before. The whisper that had been stuck in his head for years now. The one that had been a nuisiance.
"It means that..." Castiel looks to Dean. The pained look on Dean's face holds steady. "It means that I'm sorry."
Dean took a breath as he sprinted for the turbolift. By the time he got to the bridge, he figured about three more torpedoes had hit. Dean dashed out of the turbolift to a dim bridge. Smoke was seeping out of a console, and the red alert lights flashed and cast an eerie light on the frazzled crew. Sam was shouting orders as another torpedo blasted against the port nacelle.
Dean stared down at the book. He would be lying if he said that he wasn't a little curious about the sheer volume of the book. It’s not that he wasn't worried. Dean was beyond worried, but this was too much to pass over. Dean saw a red bookmark sticking out between two pages. He raised his brows and reached for the bookmark and pulled the book open. At the top of the page was a date. A familiar one, a date Dean recognized as the day before Castiel returned from his mission on Betazed all those years ago.
“Where are you going?” Sam asked. Dean sighed and turned back.
Silence. A moment passed.
“Not if everyone works together, and even if I go out we take the Borg bastards with us!” Dean said running a hand over his neck.
“Computer evasive manuv…” Before Dean could get the words out, one blast took out the shields, the next struck the shuttle, head on sending it flying backward, and the last struck the left nacelle, causing a chain explosions, blowing out the engine. Sam and Dean were thrown from their chairs and slammed into the bulkheads.
“Yes sir.” Dean said, still not looking at his father. He turned again to leave and was just at the door when John spoke again.
“Why are you following me?”
For years, the word friend sufficed for Cas, but now? Well, it was a little more complicated than that.
Dean blinks again, this time the light is warm and covers his whole body. The first thing he sees is the Harvelle roadhouse. The next thing he sees is Bobby and a few seconds later, Ellen, Jo, Ash, Charlie, Pamela, Missouri and so many others all inside waiting for him.
“Because you told me.” He replies. “7 years from now. You tell me about your life, your parents, about Sam. Everything.” Dean looks at Castiel and doesn't move a muscle until he hears a car honk behind him. He lays his foot on the gas pedal and they merge onto the highway. Castiel watches Dean swallow deep and take a breath.
"If I had any currency, It would have disintegrated in the continuum jump," Castiel says almost shrugging.
Dean rolled his eyes and sighed.
"He is still alive," Castiel says. He can still read the energy core.
Dean's words feel like a hammer and chisel being placed against Castiel's throat. Dean has repaired him a thousand times and for the first time in Castiel's life, he has to be the one to show Dean what to do. Castiel blinks and raises a hand to the back of his neck aiming for the nape. He tugs hard feels a sting of pain as he slowly pulls a long patch of skin up to the top of his head. Dean's eyes widen as he moves to see the back of Castiel's head. At first, Dean doesn't know where to look. The gunmetal skull shines with dark blood. It's thicker here and doesn't drip out, looks more like used motor oil than blood now. The 2-inch strip that's exposed is just enough space to see a small square towards the nape. Castiel gestures to it with his hand before his body tenses again, throwing his head forward.
Dean nodded at Sam.
"You wont get very far, Unit 13. You can't escape." Uriel says, moving forward, flanked by Gadreel and Azazel. Castiel isn't sure why they haven't just attacked, why they look so ... afraid. Sure there's anger, but something scares them. Something stops them. All it takes is Castiel lifting the gun towards them and placing his finger on the trigger for them to stop. Dean makes it to the far wall.
Dean looks at Castiel, silent for a moment.
Dean looked from Cas to his uniform and ran a hand over the dark fabric. Something else occurred to him.
"He will gain a target on his back if we go there, Dean," Castiel says, retaking his place against the wall. Castiel searches his memory processor for Rufus. Nothing comes up, not even a blip.
“I am.”
The Romulan turned in amazement to see Dean grinning through his pain. In one swift motion, Cas was behind him and brought up his hand. He pinched the nerve near the Romulans neck, and he collapsed to the ground. Cas took quick steps and knelt next to Dean. He took out his tricorder and scanned Dean, focusing on his shoulder where he was shot.
lie. It's a part of their programming. Lying makes you more human, which makes you smarter, which makes you vulnerable. It's all part of the act. Looking at Dean now though, Castiel knows he wouldn't be able to look him in the eyes and tell him the truth, even in part. There would be questions, there would be consequences. So, Castiel looks away, stares up at the moon ... and lies.
"I'm as good as new, little brother." Dean said, placing his pips and comm badge back in place.
“Aye.” Garth said. “Capn, we’ll lay down a suppressing fire on the smaller cubes while we get a lock on the shuttle. Stand by.” The line went silent.
"This is a direct order, Dean." John said folding his hands on his desk.
Terminators
"What do I do Cas. Tell me what to do." Dean said, crouching in front of Cas. Dean tried to hold on to some strength, but watching Cas go through this much pain. It was almost too much.
“You really think you can promise that? I’m a doctor, Dean, not a miracle worker. But, if you want me to do this, I will.” Cas said, standing and turning to exit.
"Um. Okay." Dean almost whispers. It sounds more like a question than a statement.
"Dean."
"Woah, Rufus. It's ... We're not." Dean says putting his free hand up in front of him.
Instinctively, Sam reaches for his knife as he whips his head around, still supporting Dean with his other half. Standing there, he sees Castiel. Sams eyes and mouth open wide.
"Get our engine back. Everyone battle stations." Sam yelled. The red alert lights flashed as it finally came into view. The green cluster glowed as it flew towards the Argenteus and the outline of a Borg cube appeared on the view screen. Two more torpedoes flew towards the Argenteus, but were deflected by shields.
Dean found himself at the mouth of a small cave. The entrance was barely big enough for a shuttle to fit through. Dean scanned the area around him. Then he walked for what seemed like hours down it. He turned corners and heard voices. He saw pieces of old bulkheads scattered on the ground and stepped carefully around them as best as he could. After a few more moments of silence, Dean came across a large opening. He crouched near the edge and peered around the corner.
“You know Sammy, a little less sarcasm next time. That’s an order.” Dean left before Sam could respond and was in the turbolift before anyone questioned him.
Not until they landed on the moon. Dean looked out of the window and saw a rocky maroon landscape around the Impala. A rust colored dust coated the air, but Castiel deemed it safe enough to breathe.
"I think you do." Rufus starts, cutting off Castiel. "That handy work you done on Dean's leg'll heal up like nothin happened. It's like a field medic did that stitch job. So I figure you for military. One of my own, but ... Castiel, was it?" He starts moving again this time around to Castiel's right side. "You're not one of my own. I see all that blood, dark and mechanical, I get to feeling like .... maybe you're not even human." Rufus says.
Castiel hears the door unlock. He lets out a breath and pulls the door open. He slides into the seat and reaches for the shotgun and bullets. Dean slams on the gas just as Gadreels front wheel hits the parking lot. Smoke billows out behind them as Castiel leans out the passenger window. He lets off a shot, trying to not hit any bystanders. The shot blows past Gadreels head as he turns to follow the impala.
"My destiny?" Dean laughs hard for a moment. "There's no such thing." Dean throws his arms out at his sides. "That's just your bullshit way of saying, 'You have no choice, do what I say'." Dean closes his hands into fists. For a second, Castiel thinks that Dean is about to swing at him.
"Tell me I don't mean anything to you. Just, tell me I'm just another human. Please, Cas. I'm begging you. Say it. Tell me the truth, man." Dean says with hoarseness in his voice that makes everything sound like a growl. His bloodshot eyes are looking everywhere but at Castiel.
Castiel peeks around the corner and sees Gadreel taking aim. Castiel hears sirens and for a split second, sees Gadreel look back down the street towards the sound.
"It's ok Cas." Dean starts, voice low and quiet. It sounds like he's eaten glass and gargled acid, but it's still his voice. It's still Dean. He coughs a few times, blood splattering forward. He clears his throat and continues as Uriel stops moving. Waiting. "It's ok. If it had to be someone ...." The first tear breaks over Dean's eyelid and falls down the contours of his face to his mouth. Castiel can't look away from it, how the tear clings to Dean's face. How Dean is still here after all this time. When Dean speaks again, it's like Castiel is hearing him for the first time. "I'm glad it's you ... " Dean's eyes lock to Castiel's and never leaves. "I'm glad it's you." He closes his mouth and even though it trembles now, the smile stays.
With that, the trio left in silence. Sam stayed on the bridge as Dean and Cas took the turbolift. Dean could feel Cas watch him as they walked the corridors. Normally, Dean just shrugged of the little staring contests they had, but this staring was different. It was sad, and pleading. Dean hated it. He stopped abruptly at the shuttle bay doors and turned to Cas.
Castiel obliges and opens the passenger door, not taking his eyes off of Dean until he's inside the mart. He turns his head and watches the street. It's quiet, early evening and Castiel breathes for what feels like the first time today. His memory processor is still repairing itself, but looking at Dean, hell, just being around him is ... enough it seems, to jog it.
“Ouch, Cas.” Dean said clutching his chest and pouting. Cas rolled his eyes but a faint smile rested on his lips. Dean smiled just looking at it. It was a small victory … a very small victory, but it was one that Dean would cherish for a while.
"Lucifer." Cas could barely breath. "I tried to … he locked me in here…still out there … he's strong. I can't." Cas fell limp in Dean's grasp.
“Why Cas, using your stupid mind tricks to get at me? Reach in there and pluck out whatever you want, you telepathic bastard!” Dean was yelling now, surely loudenough for the bridge crew to hear.
"It's one of these, the bright red bricks, there's a coke sign on the side of it," Dean calls from the backseat.
The conference room was usually empty, given that the senior staff of the USS Argenteus never really liked sitting in a small room arguing about their next move. They preferred their battle stations to the tall red chairs and the thin aluminum oval table. Nevertheless, Dean had called a meeting to give the new orders. Dean sat at the head of the long table and tried his best not to watch Castiel on the opposite end of the table. Dean explained their new mission – changing course, finding the Romulan rebels and taking them out - effectively abandoning their old mission. Needless to say, his crew didn't like it.
Dean sighed and shook his head.
"Dean.” Sam said relieved and walking to his brother and hugging him.
"Boy, you sure know how to treat a lady," Dean smirks. Castiel watches as the smirk fades away. "Let me guess, you don't have money in the future."
“No, I didn’t. I killed the baddies, and my crew was safe, but I guess Starfleet doesn’t like it when the Captain sacrifices themselves and ends up dead because of a head on collision. They didn’t beam me out in time during the test.”
“Yeah,” Dean sighs with a small smile, “I know.” He turns back to face Cas. “Let’s go.”
“Yeah I’ll be there in a sec, Ash.” Dean stayed for a moment longer as a small smile spread slowly on Cas’ face. It was a simple smile, not spread ear to ear, but it was one that Cas could manage. Sweet and unassuming. Dean stared a moment longer wondering how his name could bring that out of Cas. But there he sat, looking sheepish, like Dean had looked only minutes before. Dean felt his breath pick up and his mouth run dry. He let out a breath and pulled on his uniform before returning to his duties.
"Computer, remove the holo-shields outside Officer Castiel's living quarters - Authorization Code Winchester 0-5-Alpha-2-5-3." The computer beeped and the shield dissipated. Dean took tentative steps toward the quarters. The door had been forced open. Dean peered through the door. The stars outside the far window provided the only light.
"You heard the man. Let's go."
Dean is standing in front of him wearing the grey jumpsuit, his back to Castiel. In front of him stands Uriel, Gadreel, and another Terminator. A242 - EL. An older model, Azazel was one of the first to receive human like emotions. The three stand all with guns pointed at Castiel, and by proxy, Dean. Castiel tries to place the time, this is later, a while before they break free but he feels something towards Dean. Loyalty. Something else, something still growing.
Dean let out a breath and looked to Sam.
“That half-breed doctor.” It took every ounce of Starfleet brand restraint to not knock John out right then and there.
"Don't fucking ... lie to me, Cas," Dean says, pointing the hand with the vodka bottle at him. "Don't you lie to me." Dean glares daggers at Castiel.
Dean stays still and leans back a bit, more in line with where Castiel is standing.
"Cas!" Dean yells, helpless as Gadreel shoves the barrel of the gun against his chest. Gadreel looks back to Castiel and snarls.
"They died natural deaths. Old age. My father was almost 180 years old. That's old for a Vulcan. When he passed, my mother passed soon after that. I don't think she could be without him for any longer. I believe that was a year before Castiel and Samandriel were assigned to this ship.”
"You all are dismissed. Ellen, have Garth set a course for the ship’s last known coordinates." The officers stood to leave but Dean caught Sam by the arm and looked at Cas.
Rufus raises his gun to Castiel's head.
"Aye Captain." The comm went quiet as the pair locked eyes again. Cas placed a hand on Dean’s shoulder and spoke in a low voice.
He watched Cas walk away and held back the fact that he hadn't had a good nights sleep in a long time. The word 'Nightmare' doesn't even begin to describe what happened when Dean tried to fall asleep. Usually it was his mother or Sam dying in some gruesome tragic twist of fate that Dean blamed himself for, but lately, Castiel had taken their places. Without thinking, Dean reached his hand up to where Cas' hand was minutes before. The lingering ghost of Castiel's touch was hot on his hand. He let out a low laugh realizing how ridiculous he might look, and let his hands rest at his sides. Dean turned back to the console and punched a few buttons, turning off the screen and dimming the lights. He closed his eyes and let his head hang low, something he did a lot of lately. He let the darkness wash over him, relishing the closest thing he'd get to sleep anytime soon.
"Just do it. It will distract you." Castiel says passing the flame over the tweezers again.
“What are you doing, Dean?” Cas said, following him.
“Come on, man, you gotta give me something,” Dean says. Silence fills the car as Castiel searches his database for what information he can release, for what he can say that will convince Dean.
Nonetheless, they drive for a few hours before pulling into an industrial part of town in the outskirts of Reno, Nevada.
"Holy shit," Dean says after he follows Castiel's gaze. Castiel whips back to Dean.
June 20, 2016
"Cas? Well he's you know. He was on the edge there for a minute, when they first beamed back. But I uh … we got him back. He's been, well, himself since then."
Castiel blinks a few times before reaching down for Dean's arm. Dean grunts as he pushes himself out of the car.
"A time? What's that supposed to mean?" Dean says opening the door. He lets his body fall into the car and leans in. The thought crosses Castiel's programming that Dean will try to cut and run again.
Dean slept for 13 hours.
"My dad’s blamed me for this for years. I tried so hard to be a good son, but he still holds this over my head. When he gets a few drinks in him he’ll ramble about it for hours. He’d say things like,‘Mary would be an admiral by now ’. She deserves life more than I do. I’m just a cadet with a few extra pips." Dean said looking down at his hands.
"Cas, it's me." Dean gasped for air. Cas tilted his head. "It's Dean, your best friend. Please." Dean coughed out as he placed a hand on Castiel's shoulder. Cas blinked and looked to the hand. He looked back to Dean and squinted.
He was right. Dean could have it easier being a Borg. Dean felt himself slipping. Feeling nothing would be an upgrade to the way Dean felt now. Like the universe was on his shoulders, and on  top of that, the ghosts of the past coming back to haunt him, even though he thought he could shut them out. He could forget the pain, but he'd forget the good too, he'd forget Cas. Dean looked to Cas, hoping for guidance, but instead Lucifer stepped between them.
The last time Castiel was in an elevator, he was holding Dean up, beaten and bloody after a chase. He was barely able to hold himself up, his blood dripping onto the floor.
"How was she killed, Dean?" Castiel asked.
"I do not.” His head tilts “I don't need to defecate." Castiel replies.
"I remember and it is still illogical." Cas said, finally meeting Dean's gaze. For a moment they both froze locked in this light moment.
"Don't worry about me, Ellen, just go." Ellen nodded and helped up some of the crew and hobbled away toward sick bay. Dean punched a few buttons on a nearby console.
“He told me when you graduated. When you went to the hospital after he broke your nose. He fought with you about discipline because he thought he could save you. But, even then Dad knew you were too stubborn to let Cas go. Even though you hide it, he knew it would never go away. He said Mom was the same way.“
"Tell me," Castiel says, wiping the tweezers on one of the black towels.
could have done something! You loved her and you did nothing!
"Yes I did" He replied. Dean took a breath, and tried to keep himself from going balistik.
“What?” Sam asked.
"Dean, what?" Castiel says. “What does that …?”
“87. He lived a long life, he married Eileen and had children. I’m sure he can tell you about it. We should … go for a drive.” Cas says looking outside. It’s been weeks since Dean has seen the old impala. For the most part, they didn’t really need a car here in heaven. Dean hadn’t forgotten about her but he was … busy.
“I beamed them directly to Sick bay. Captain, Samandriel is dead.”
“Sounds fair.” Dean said, taking one last gulp of coffee.
“I know that, and I also know that he’s a soft spot for you. Always has been, ever since you two met at orientation. You have to be strong, Dean, and I know you can be. But he makes you weak, Dean. He also makes you blind. You think the Borg are the only thing out there threatening Federation Space? No, but you want to fight them because his brother was killed in the line of duty.”
"Wait ... " Dean whispers. Unit 13 throws both wrists to his left, sending Dean into a work table. His back hits the edge of it with a crack and he crumbles to the ground. Low controlled laughter erupts from Uriel.
"Cas sure did work a miracle back there, didn't he." Sam said, with something like sarcasm coating every word.
"Dean. Keep. Talking." Castiel looks towards him.
Dean will never forget the look on Cas’s face the first time they went to a real party. Not a Starfleet mandated, dress-uniforms-only party - a real, off campus, alcohol soaked party. Dean will never forget the way Cas refused to leave Dean’s side. Cas explained it away as a safety precaution, claiming that as representatives of Starfleet, they should remain together, just in case any partygoers had ill-intent. Dean was pretty sure that was bullshit and had to refrain from laughing when pure terror flashed across Cas’s face anytime anyone tried to hit on him.
Dean felt something wash over him, everything and nothing all at once. He stood slowly and clenched his fists.
“No, Dean, she has simply not reached that point yet.”
-----
Some days when he looks at Cas; he swears he can see his wings or some glowing blue parts of his true form. He sees the wrinkled vessel that Cas stitched back together all those years ago. He sees the bright blue eyes and the windswept hair. Above all, when Dean looks at Cas, he sees love. He sees sacrifice, loyalty, pride. He sees the man who risked it all for him, over and over and over again.
Darkness.
"Cas, I can't." He whispered.
“I must be getting to my brother.” Anna said as she nodded to Dean and went through the doors. Dean stayed planted in his place, peering into the mess hall again. He watched as Anna reached the stainless steel table and was greeted by Cas. Dean’s heart sped up just a bit. The siblings sat and glanced at each other every few seconds barely emoting. A word escaped Anna’s lips. No, not a word; a name, ‘Dean’.
“Dammit, shifty bastard…” Dean spat, “Cas I’m gonna get close to him, but you gotta give me a weapon. This is your brain. Use it.” Cas nodded and stood straighter, stronger. Dean looked around again and took off running towards the bay window. He figured If he could bash through the window, he could distract Lucifer long enough for Cas to gain control.
Dean nods and looks to Castiel.
flashes across the screen as bills flutter into the cash slot below. All one hundred dollar bills.
"Oh good, we don't need to bother with pleasantries. Let's get straight to the point. I'm going to board your ship, assimilate you and your crew, make a pit stop at Earth, assimilate another 7 billion or so, and then take over the universe, quadrant by quadrant." Lucifer said, dragging his gaze over every member of the bridge crew. Dean exhaled and shook his head.
Castiel pulls the wire out of the card and hands it to Dean. The card is slick with synthetic blood "That ... not so neat. Gross, actually. You good?" Dean finishes taking the card.
was his. This moment, this smile, that was for him. For once in a long time; maybe ever; Dean felt
“It’s the same ship that attacked us thirty years ago.” John paused. “Their last known coordinates are near a planet called Mab-bu. It's about twenty light-years from here." John squinted at Dean as he averted his eyes and stared at the pad.
Dean and Cas look at their family and back at each other. They both let out a laugh. Dean looks at all of them again, scanning the crowd. He knows Sam isn’t there. The only thing missing now.
"Shut up." Dean growled  back.
The slightest upturn of the lips passes over Castiel's mouth before he speaks.
"Dean. Don't walk a...." Castiel moves to follow Dean but stops when Dean looks back, eyes glaring back at him. "You can't call your brother." Dean turns fully facing Castiel now. "I won't allow you."
"Captain, sit." John said, never looking away from the pad in his hands. Dean followed the order and let his eyes fix on the sharp corner of John's desk. John took another few minutes and finally looked at his son.
"Keep going," Castiel says hovering just over his wound.
“I’m not here to heal him. I’m here to take him.” Cas says, low and soft. “I’m taking him to heaven”
-----
Cas said
"Because you're right, I might not come back and I just can't." He said looking away again and leaning back in his chair. Cas looked down, and brought his hands back to his own knees. Still looking down, he whispered.
Had Dean followed his fathers orders, Ejhil would already be dead, but Dean … something else was eating at him.
"I'll be back soon, I hope." Dean felt his back stiffen and his hands started to sweat.
"I don't think he ever would. He's not as emotionally inclined as the rest of my family. He's a lot like my father. Especially when he was a child."
"Can't ever be too careful, kid." Rufus says with a drawl as he makes his way across the room to Dean. He claps a hand on his shoulder. "Sorry I ain't been able to make it out since the funeral, son."
"Dean. You may not believe me, but I don't know how else to make you understand." Castiel says shaking his head.
Sam returns to the barn, bundles of fabric in hand. He stops for a moment in front of Dean's body. He kneels next to Dean and places a hand on his shoulder. Dean and Cas see Sam's back heave and shutter as tears drop onto Dean's blood-soaked jacket.
"The Romulans aren't a threat right now, Dean, the Borg are. It doesn't make sense for Dad to send us like this." Dean glared at Sam until Sam stepped back.
"This is Castiel. A ... uh A friend. Probably wouldn't be alive if he didn't save my ass." Castiel's eyes float to the side of Dean's head. He forgets where he is for a moment before Rufus' voice breaks him out of the moment.
"Let me go with you." Sam said.
Cas said in Dean's head. Dean hung his head as he left the shuttle. As soon as he stepped out the dust, cleared for a few feet around him. Dean looked around and pulled out a tricorder and laid in the coordinates that Garth had given him.
"Cas." Dean chokes out as he reaches up to Unit 13's wrists, prying at them, using all of his strength. "Cas ... Dammit." He sputters. The creases in Dean's face only deepen as his face begins to turn white. "Castiel." He croaks.
At first, Cas seemed a little pretentious and a little out of place. He was older than most of the first year cadets, but Dean felt an inherent need to protect him. Then again, Dean found that much of the time Cas didn't need protecting. He towered over most and talked circles around the younger cadets. Even so, he still was an alien. His father was Vulcan and his mother was Betazoid. He grew up on Betazed, so he didn’t really get humanity and it’s nuances like parties, humor, and pie. So
"Aye Captain." The crew filed out and Cas remained seated at the far end of the table.
"Excuse me?" Dean says darting his face forward. "You're not gonna allow me?" Dean scoffs, turning his back to Castiel once more.
“What kind of malfunction?” Cas asked pacing to Ash’s console.
"Now." Castiel barks.
“Well, these ones aren’t. They’re a rebel group. This is their ship.” John handed the pad to Dean. On it was the layout of a large Romulan Warbird, with the name Auroto below it.
But he doesn't. Dean waits.
"Son of a bitch!" Dean yells. "If he hits my car again, I'll rip his head off!"
"He was pretty nuts there for a while. He took out half my team like it was nothing. I'm not going to shoot at him, Dean, I won't do that. But now, he's back in his quarters. I heard some crashes. I think he's trashing the place. It was a frenzy when you called before, that’s why we couldn’t answer." Ellen whispered.
His own voice rang through his head.
"Open a channel." Dean paused and took a breath. "This is Captain Dean Winchester of the U.S.S. Argenteus. Identify yourself." The view screen switched to a view that made Dean's heart sink. Lucifer. Somehow he had thought that maybe it was just a straggling Borg cube, something they could just avoid. But, there he stood in the center of a black room that was laced with green lights and silver tubing.
“Lucifer. What’d he say, Cas?”
Castiel blinks and for a moment he's back there, back in the 'jump room' as they called it. Dean stands at a console, bloodied and beaten, typing furiously. Lights flash against his face from red to green. He glances behind him as the archway fills with gunfire. Castiel tries to get to him, but the glass door in front of him has locked itself into the jump chamber. A countdown begins.
“So, why can you talk at me?”
“Alright, shoot those off right before we hit the cube. It won’t do much but it’ll at least neutralize the bastards for a second.”
The Impala floated in the light-year long expanse between the Argenteus and the Borg cube. It would still take a good twenty minutes, before they could carry out their plan. Dean and Sam sat in silence, punching buttons. Dean monitored the distance between the shuttle and the Argenteus. The shuttle would be passing the point of no return soon. Dean spoke in a low voice, eyes still trained on the Borg Cube.
"What? Cas ... " Dean says, shaking his head.
“You won't need the shuttle once I assimilate you.” The screen went black and 3 photon blasts came hurdling towards the nacelles.
"Alright, let's do this. Garth, set a course back to Zetar. That'll be our best bet to find him. Jo, warp 7. Ash, scan for Borg activity. I'm sure Lucifer's on the move. We have at least forty lightyears to prepare. Everybody get to work, we gotta get the Argenteus in tip-top shape." Dean sat back down and looked to his brother again. He heard Castiel's voice in his head.
"What!?" A voice yells out from a speaker above the doorbell. The voice cracks with feedback and scratches out.
"Keep talking, Dean."
“Imzadi.” Like a firecracker, something went off in his brain, sparking and sizzling, only there was no pain. There was clarity. As the sparks faded he heard a voice, quiet, and trembling.
"Captain, they're altering course to Vulcan, but we've lost our forward and port shields. Everything else is down to thirty percent, we're venting plasma, and we're almost out of ammo. We just aren't causing enough damage and now we're stuck on impulse."
bottles of Vulcan brandy.
“Keep shooting!” Castiel yells. Dean's eyes focus too much on the metallic craters but he lets off another shot into Gadreel's chest. Castiel can hear the metallic clang and smell the gunpowder but he knows Gadreel is not budging. It’s going to take more to bring him down.
"You still aren't." Castiel retorts. Dean huffs out a quiet laugh. The two are silent. Dean leans back till his head hits the cold wall. His eyes droop to a close. He lets out a low hum as he lifts the half-empty bottle of Kentucky Whiskey he'd been nursing to his lips. Castiel watches as he takes a long swig, long enough that he knows Dean will be knocked out soon.
A rustle in the backseat prompts Castiel to look in the rearview mirror.
“Alright, but remember he’s the ship’s doctor. He has the power and authority to knock you out if he needs to. Right, Cas?”
“Does she have your awesome sense of humor?” Dean said, grinning as he fell into stride with Cas. Cas side eyed him for a moment and scoffed.
Dean mulled over the word in his mind and felt his heart beat faster. Imzadi repeated in his mind over and over again and what used to be a dull echo; now was clear as day. All these years, Cas felt like this and didn’t say anything.
“Son of a bitch!” Dean yelled stumbling to stand. Sam scrambled to his feet but let out a growl when he put weight on his leg. Dean looked down and saw a piece of bulkhead had broken off during the last explosion and launched itself into Sam’s leg. Dean scrambled to Sam and helped him back into the chair.
“What about Cas?” Dean asked.
"To the bridge." Sam answered, trailing behind. The walk was silent until the brothers turned down a hall.
Dean crouches a bit, readying himself to sprint. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out his keys.
"Garth and Charlie are charting a course. At warp 8, It will take us five days to prepare for and reach the Auruto's last known location." Cas said, never looking away from the screen. Dean walked slowly forward and joined Cas at the console.
Dean Winchester was a good kid. He worked hard, he played hard (though mostly he worked hard) and he’d give a stranger the shirt off his back. He spent more time at the studio than was probably healthy, and he loved it. He was, in a word, dedicated. And anyone who didn’t know him would think he lived a charmed life: funny, talented, a tight-knit group of friends. Of course, those who knew him knew better. Dean was fighting his way through this world tooth and nail, and he would come up happy just to spite it.
He placed one hand softly on Dean’s cheek; he loved the way the stubble scratched at his fingertips now. Dean huffed in faux agitation as he started rubbing one of Cas’s feet between his hands, determined to stir up warmth.
Ellen walked into the kitchen with Jo close behind. “Bobby back yet?” she asked.
“Mhmm,” Garth hummed, eyebrows raised sagely. “Did you win?” Jack asked quietly, with an intensity he could only have learned from his papa.
“So,” Charlie eventually spoke up over the clattering of keyboards, “what are you guys up to next period?”
“I’m Castiel,” he added a little too formally, like he wasn’t sure what else to say.
it rang softly.
and you’ve barely even been human, so I’m not gonna let you die of a cold just because you’re
Cas looked over at Dean, watching him take it all in, watching his eyes crinkle as his body shook with abrupt waves of laughter. He reached over to take Dean’s hand, relishing it all. Dean squeezed Cas’s hand, and the next moment he was turning, still mid-laugh, to flash his smile toward his angel (now with a lowercase “a”).
Shit, that was right. So, Dean didn’t have any extra curriculars tonight, but everybody else did.
But no sooner had he let the doubt cross his mind than Cas had sprung back up and swiped the ring from his hand in an astonishing blur of motion. And then he was kissing Dean, still-cold fingers a relief against his flushed skin.
At the sight awaiting them, Sam let out an unironic and positively gleeful, “
It was the most beautiful thing Dean had ever heard.
“Dean, Garth,” Cas said suddenly, nodding towards the stage where Jack’s toothless, six-year old grin was beaming down at them, and his frantically waving hand was threatening to eject itself from his arm. (“I won’t be able to say hi anymore after we’re all sat down,” he had soberly informed his fathers last night. “Miss Carlisle said so, no talking on stage except of if it’s your turn.”)
“Yeah. Yeah, see you around.” Dean offered a final, small wave before Castiel crossed the room and exited into the hallway.
“I know.”
Claire and Jack took the bowls of leftover fruit and retreated to their Lego Star Wars fest as Sam and Eileen hunkered down for some overdue research. Cas, of course, simply aided Dean in his lazer-focus on Birthday Festivities. They spent longer than Cas would have thought possible arranging the trays of chocolates, bowls of chips, and a pile of gifts onto the library table, but in the end, he had to admit that it did look spectacular.
“This is for you,” he gushed, thrusting his hand toward Cas to reveal the ring sitting on his now open palm.
Jack’s smile continued growing impossibly brighter over the next several minutes as he opened a pair of aquamarine headphones from Claire and Alex (“So you don’t have to listen to Dean’s old man music all the time.”) and a polaroid camera from Patience and Kaia (“You’re apparently going to take a really good one later, but she wouldn’t say what of.”)
“Just now,” the boy clarified, snapping Dean out of his weird and hopefully unnoticed reverie. “Is that why you’re still here?”
Dean let out his breath.
“Hey, buddy!” Dean scooped him up. “That was awesome!” Jack peered up through his lashes.
Cas, of course, was in on these top secret plans- which involved arranging an array of fruits (Jack was especially into cantaloupe and blueberries these days) and chocolates into intricately patterned trays. Though, he was just as excited to see Jack’s surprised face as Sam and Dean were, so he avowed himself to secrecy.
"Yeah, well," she quipped back, throwing a duffle bag down onto the table, "I've never been one to follow protocol." Dean rolled his eyes and snatched up the duffle to unpack it. "How'd it go?" he asked, addressing them both.
In the end, Cas was right. It
also.
“Can we-”
of the metal door closing made itself known, but it wasn't quite enough to drown out the greeting.
Cas’s heart melted just a little at the smile Dean fought back.
After several moments, Cas finally drew back. There was an expression of heartbreaking tenderness on his face.
“Whenever you want,” Dean grinned back. “But I get to be green.”
So, it had come as a shock when Cas returned home one afternoon a few days later (he had left in the morning with an implication-heavy “
The bunker was loud, and that was a good thing. There were screams and shouts, people running-- but not because they had to. There was no danger in their midst. Their chaos now was just love, finally able to breathe free.
“Ladies,” he smiled upon seeing Ellen and Jo. “Boys,” he added to Sam and Dean.
Dean paid no real mind to this encounter, instead turning his attention back to his routine, right where he had left off.
“You know what else has one ‘a,’ buddy?” Garth asked.
said report. His chest fluttered.
Castiel’s eyebrows furrowed slightly as he tilted his head gently to one side. “It’s not that big of a school.”
across the front-- and the matching flannel pants to go with them.
beneath his feet… it always made him feel so connected to the earth. It made him feel
Cas chuckled under his breath again as he watched them shuffle together into the hallway. Scooching the duffle bag into a more secure position than where Claire had left it at the edge of the table, he turned and headed for the kitchen.
"And I don't suppose you'd be aware that one Mr. Benny LaFitte volunteered his time for next week, huh? That’s just a happy coincidence for you?"
” moment.)
Jack physically perked up in his seat when she walked in, eyes bright and practically vibrating with excitement. Cas saw her roll her eyes as she laughed, but he also noted how she bounded down the stairs with what he could only consider an objectively unsafe rate of speed.
"Just watch yourself hanging around these mythical creatures, okay?" He popped another kiss onto Cas's cheek and stage whispered, "
They had yet to move out of the bunker, with its old cement and tile floors, and in the summer, Cas had loved the cool stone under his feet. Dean, however, had formed a habit of materializing without warning, gruffly offering socks of increasing volume and thickness. All this achieved, though, was creating small piles of abandoned socks all around the bunker, as Cas hadn’t had the heart to refuse them outright, and also didn’t want to put them on. Though as winter approached, the stone had started to bite at him with each step, until he learned what it felt like for toes to go numb. But still he refused the infinite wool socks, which now seemed to appear almost on their own, preceding him into rooms with a nearly alarming frequency.
, Dean had pretended to tease once. But Cas had only smiled in that way of his, radiant even in his sadness.
Dean's gaze snapped up to meet Cas's, eager on instinct.
Garth nodded again. “It’s the downfall of champions.”
"Good," Cas murmured. Then he nodded firmly toward the cushion on the floor. "Kneel."
Cas smiled fondly as Dean pulled him over for a kiss on the cheek. Jo feigned retching even as her eyes sparkled with laughter.
-- Dean might never understand.
Should he say something? Castiel deserved to be told how talented he was—not that he didn’t probably know already—but Dean decided that would just make this whole accident even weirder. Then again, Castiel would have to leave the auditorium eventually, and Dean would most likely be around when he did.
He felt more than saw Cas fighting a grin next to him as Jo struggled violently against a blush.
Dean sighed. “Fine, hot shot, lemme think… okay, here’s the deal. You’re gonna want to take home ec, because that’s where all the girls are. Just don’t steal ‘em from me,” he added with a wink.
Dean already had them posing, full Vogue style, for pictures on his phone.
"You did spelling bees?" Cas asked.
“I guess not,” Cas answered playfully, and his voice was so full of love, Dean knew he could never have dreamt it. He turned to rest his forehead against Castiel’s and felt his hand get squeezed gently in return.
“Dean!” Sam whined.
"But I feel compelled to remind you," Cas went on, "that it will be
"That's good," Cas responded, and Dean could tell, somehow, that he was referring more to Dean and his
“Biggest dick you’ll ever meet in your life,” Dean answered, shaking his head.
I’da known to put all those dashes in there. You musta studied like nobody’s
When Dean opened the door, he heard music. It was faint, but it was definitely there.
"Watch it, mister."
And as they headed out together towards the car, they all took turns naming all the single ‘a’ words they could think of.
given-up-to-be-with-you-for-as-long-as-we-both-shall-live
Dean kneaded the soft material in his hands.
At that moment, Mr. Fitzgerald came in and announced that they would be having a free work day. Dean, Ash, and Charlie, along with a majority of the class, all got up and went to their computer stations. Dean was no slouch at comp sci—he had a fairly technical mind—but he had nothing on either Ash or Charlie. The things they could do just instinctively were incredible, and sometimes Dean just liked to watch them work.
Dean doubled back into the choir room, leaving the doors as he had found them. He hated to shut the one; the music was gorgeous, but he needed to be able to focus on the music in his head.
when he heard a soft fluttering sound to his left.
He quirked a small smile at the memory and headed for the back door and his work boots. His flannel pajama bottoms scrunched up weirdly into the tops of his Caterpillars, so he tugged them loose as he plodded down the back steps and into the scrapyard. Dean set his sights on a rusted 1987 Chevy C/K and hopped up onto the front hood; he hated 80s cars, but not everything out here was load bearing. Plus, he told himself, at least it wasn’t a Ford.
"No, Castiel. This one was my favorite."
The boy’s back was turned, but Dean recognized him as Castiel . . . something. They were in the same grade. Dean couldn’t place Castiel’s last name, but then again, he hadn’t known the boy could play piano, either. Or had he?
Dean chuckled, rolling his eyes and reaching for the burningly over-salted popcorn. "Gimme some of that."
Cas grinned again, sweeter this time. "Good, good boy." He placed his hand back across Dean's cheek and mouth, and Dean closed his eyes, smiling into it. This always grounded Dean in a way like nothing else Cas had ever tried; it left him in constant awe of how it worked equally well as both command and praise.
More intense, but sweeter, too.
“Cas?” he repeated slowly, like the sound was alien but not unwelcome.
"Good," Cas smiled. "Kneel."
“I was going to suggest some dinner,” Sam smiled, “but I’ll just bring out some sandwiches, since I can see there’s clearly very important business happening here.”
They cleaned up the worst of the mess in contented silence and headed to bed. Tomorrow, after all, was a big day.
Dean chuckled, and there was silence.
”) and marched right up to Dean with his fist clenched tight and a sheepish smile on his face. He had looked different, somehow, Dean thought. Softer, maybe. Or like his eyes had gotten brighter, as if that were possible.
Cas’s mouth partled slightly in surprise, but he didn’t otherwise move or speak. He just stared at the ring, frozen. Dean felt a heat creep over the back of his neck. Had he misjudged this?
"I had the same trouble with ‘pandemonium,’" Garth frowned. Then, almost immediately, it flipped into a smile that could have powered the building. "Darned a's."
"Mm," Dean hummed, but when he looked up, Cas was giving him the
"Aww, it's no trouble, now!" Garth beamed. "Anything for my little man. And," he added, shaking a paper bag towards Cas, "anything for some good old fashioned concession stand popcorn."
“Why?” Sam asked.
Once Cas got past the brightly colored feather boas and absurdly large plastic sunglasses the pair had donned, he also noticed their t-shirts-- emblazoned with the words “
They had been through so much so quickly in the last few years that their new change of pace was almost unbearably welcome. With Cas becoming human and he and Eileen both moving into the bunker full time, the group had slipped into quasi-retirement without ever really meaning to. Garth had actually called to check in before any of them realized that weeks had gone by without taking a hunt. And now that the decision was conscious, they were all still on call for phones and research, but Eileen was the only one actually going out into the field. They were happy this way, though. They had, as Dean had pointed out, “damn well earned it.”
Enjoy! x
“Okay,” Dean practically buzzed, “I’m gonna go get Jack.” And he was already halfway out of the room by the time Cas was able to interject, “Candles?”
"It was nearly empty," she shrugged with defiant nonchalance.
Dean crossed the little room slowly, quietly, the music growing louder and clearer with each step. He carefully nudged the door open just enough to see out onto the dimly lit stage. The house lights were all off, but one strip of stage lights shone down on the old baby grand currently sitting off to stage right. That is to say, shining down on both the piano and the dark-haired boy who was playing it.
“What about you, Winchester?” Charlie asked.
“Is everything okay, Dean? You seem… startled.”
She hadn’t even set her bags down before Jack announced, “I have Mario Kart set up, but our spot’s still saved in Lego Star Wars, and Dean also said he got a new game that we can all play together but it’s a present, so I don’t know what it is yet, but I bet we could open it tonight if we ask.”
Cas was thoughtful for a moment, then said, "Put it on the ground." Dean obeyed without hesitation, dropping the cushion at his feet.
“Shall I grab them?” he asked. Claire had missed her last regular visit for a “rugaru situation,” and Cas knew Dean had been missing her extra for it.
“It’s from when you were young,” he said fondly, no hint of a question.
“Nothing much,” Ellen answered with a tired but contented sigh. “Just the daily report.”
Jack stared at them for a moment, and then looked up at Dean like he was seeing the sun.
Cas grabbed Dean's chin lightly with his thumb now, tilting his face up just enough to meet their eyes. "I love you," he said back.
“Yeah, I know, right? But anyway…” Sammy continued as he followed Dean to the room they shared. “Anyway, I was wondering if you had any advice?” Sammy looked up at Dean with such admiration. He was always doing that. Dean couldn’t understand what the kid saw in him, but he still thought it was sweet. “I am the
!” Garth hollered, scooping Jack away from Dean and raising one of his little arms in triumph.
“I didn’t even finish.”
This morning, like most mornings, Dean woke up before Cas. Cas's face was wrinkled from sleep and still shadowed in the semi-darkness of early morning, but Dean stared anyway. Twelve years they had loved each other. And, for most of those years- if Dean was being honest- they had known. But
Cas felt the grin split across his face. “That you do.”
“…Noted,” Sam said as they heard the back door slam open and shut.
wax for that one, huh?” he added with a wink and a poke to Jack’s tummy. Jack giggled into Dean’s shoulder as Cas ruffled his hair again.
Another flash and Castiel is sitting on that same cold metal table that he first woke up on. His pain receptors are off the chart, and he can tell, even with his sensors slightly malfunctioning that he looks even worse than he feels. His reflection in the glass wall is mostly metallic and grey. A jagged gash runs from his right ear down across his face to his jaw. It would have been worse had Uriel not finally called Gadreel off. Dean swooped in and started in on repairs, slowly synthesizing new skin and muscle fibers.
A signal runs down Castiel spine. Castiel starts to remember, this ... Dean between him and a gun. It's familiar. Castiel's programming surges electricity through his processor. Pain blasts through his artificial nerves. It's too much, this is too much. He reaches up to his head and as his sleeve passes his face he feels his memory shift to someplace else.
“Dad, I can stop the Borg once and for all. Their queen died when Voyager came home. These are the last Borg in this quadrant. They’re weak, I can do this.” John stood and leaned over the desk.
Cas knew, after all, that there were many things to feel in the world, and he looked forward to learning them all. But now, in this moment—warm and soft and
He opened his eyes with a start to see the piano boy—Castiel—sitting on the other side of the bench. He was wearing a light blue button up with a beige nylon jacket—Dean heard the fabric rustle again as the boy shifted his weight.
“Dean, at least say something to the crew.” Sam said. Dean turned on his heel. He let his eyes pass over the crew and nodded. He didn’t want to linger too much on his feelings. He touched his badge and spoke.
"Aye Captain." Garth said, punching buttons.
Castiel kicked the shortest one square in the jaw and used the palm of his hands to shove the another back against the stone cave wall. Cas stepped around another Romulan and jabbed him somewhere in the middle of the back, causing the man to spasm and fall to the ground.
Castiel is frozen before the last words Dean says even reaches his ears. The singing voice coming from the radio is just a vibration, translating itself at a snail's pace as Castiel rolls over Dean's voice again and again.
"Yeah, I'm sure it is." Dean says, jaw set, as he turns the key in the ignition. "Look. You won’t let me call. Whatever, but I'm driving to California to get to Sam first. If you want to try to stop me, that's fine. You know, I got no problem dying over this. I won't leave Sam to that. I won't."
"Usually?" Castiel accesses his database. "Anything molten, explosions." He replies. "The whole unit has to be destroyed. For the future's sake, nothing can be left behind."
"Jesus christ, Cas." Dean tightens his hand around the towel as Castiel goes deeper with the tweezers.
June 19, 2016
"Already took care of that, besides I don't know if they really want to see your face again."
"Don't ... " Dean points the shotgun at Castiel, "make me regret this." Dean finishes as he opens the door, leans over, and unlocks the passenger side door. The engine roars to life as they hear glass shatter inside the shop. Castiel slides into the passenger side and shuts the door. Dean floors it and backs up just as they see Gadreel leap out of the window.
“It’s too late Sammy. The chances of Ash getting us out in time …”
“He’s with Samandriel, but Dean, he needs you. You had better get down there.” The comm went quiet. Dean nodded.
"You wanna know a little secret Castiel. That right there?" Rufus gestures with the shotgun to the metal framed doorway. "That's a silent metal detector. And when you stepped through it." Rufus pulls out a small phone in his hands. A notification bar blares on the screen. An X-Ray image appears once he clicks the bar. It shows Castiel, his metal skeleton and mechanical core. "You're whole body's a machine isn't it. If you got any proof of the alternative, be my guest. The way I see it, ain't no human gonna look me in the eyes like you did. I saw nothing starin' back at me, no soul so heart no nothin'. It's cause you ain't got one."
Dean sighed. He couldn’t tell Sam why he didn’t want him to come with. Not in front of the crew, not with everyone watching.
Dean thinks.
you tell me? About the future."
“Jack let this one slide. Who takes you to heaven doesn’t matter, just that you get there. I’ll be taking Sam and Claire too when their time comes. Which thankfully won’t be for some time.”
Months later, when Cas returned, a second voice haunted Dean's mind - a whisper. At first, Dean thought it was Cas messing with him, but this voice was different. It was an echo of a familiar but distant voice. The voice repeated one word over and over when Cas was around, but hard as Dean tried, he could never quite hear or make sense of it, and over the years he managed to push it away and ignore it.
"You're not gonna stop me?" Dean says squinting his eyes. Castiel shakes his head back and forth. He watches the way Dean gulps down air, the way his muscles in his neck tighten, how they tightened against his hands when he was first booted up. He looks back to his hands, now curling into tight fists. His programming works overtime to correct, reroute, to dig deep into his base.
“Sam. No. You stay here.” Dean turned feeling his heart sink.
While Dean’s always thought a bank heist would be cool, Castiel hacking into an ATM for cash, isn’t what he had in mind.
"Good to hear." Sam said. He looked to Cas who now had his eyes trained on Dean. “Cas, you’ve gotta be the best doctor this side of the quadrant.”
Castiel starts moving and Dean moves with him, like a shadow. Gadreel turns back to face the two and bullets start flying again. Castiel picks up his pace and Dean adjusts too. One bullet lands on Castiel's arm, sending his arm swinging back. Another bullet lands in his low stomach forcing him to turn his body inwards.
"Cas, that's a friggin rifle. You sure you can handle that?" Dean says leaning forward, trying to get Castiel to look back at him.
"They're a friggin pain in my ass. It's hard work putting you back together all the time, Cas." Dean says, trying to put some lightness in his voice, a hint of laughter but it comes out hollow and lifeless. Castiel looks to Dean and back out the glass wall.
“No, Dean. What is your problem? It doesn’t make any sense for you to go alone. What if Lucifer scans the shuttle and sees you’re the only life sign and our whole plan falls apart. You said this would work.”
Castiel sees a flash of Dean standing in front of him, a vodka bottle in hand. It's half-empty and leaking onto the ground. The only light comes from a small campfire in the center of their concrete hovel. Dean's voice breaks.
"How? Don’t skimp on the details.”
Dean looks ahead and puts the gear into drive. He smiles as he presses the gas.
“Of course Cas! I’d love to.” Dean said tilting his head, smiling and offering Anna an arm. Cas glared at Dean. He didn’t need telepathy to tell Dean to cool it.
He put an arm around Castiel's waist and pulled him toward the door and down the long hallway. Dean glanced out the bay window and saw lighting flashing across the sky. That’s when he heard it - a laugh echoing in the library.
“He would have understood.” Cas pleaded.
"I'll be fine," Castiel says, a dry tone in his voice, taking the flap of skin and folding it back over. Blood oozes out the sides of the cut, but it doesn't seem to bother him. "Let's go." He says as he moves past Dean.
He fires two shots. The first hits Gadreel square on the side of his head. It sends his synthetic skin flying and reveals his gunmetal skeleton underneath. The other nicks the front tire. It’s a small bite but it's enough to grip the pavement. Gadreel tries to break but the rubber burns beneath him and the bike flips back over front, sending him headfirst into the trunk of the car in front of him. The crunch of metal and glass is loud enough to hear for miles. Cars behind the wreck burn rubber trying to brake before hitting the stopped car.
"Any. I don't ..." Dean starts, sitting Castiel down in a chair on the far wall. "Uh ... Cas, hey." Dean waves a hand in front of Castiel's eyes. He can sense that at least as he follows Dean's hands up to his face. Dean lets out a breath of relief as Castiel finally makes eye contact with him. "Hey, Cas," Dean says, taking a knee in front of the chair. "Tell me what to do. How do I fix you, man?"
Dean had lost officers before, but this was Castiel’s little brother – barely an ensign, assigned to the Argenteus so that Castiel could look after him. Dean picked up his pace and jogged to the sick bay. The door slid open. There was never this much blood in sick bay. Even after battles, sick bay remained clean and grey. Now, blood dripped to the red stained floor. Dean stared at the drips and followed them upwards to find Samandriel on the bio bed. Castiel stood over him with his head down. He was shaking. The two medics were standing on the other side of the bed, waiting for Castiel's order.
“We made it.” Sam winced. Cas reached up to his badge and spoke.
"The crew of that Romulan ship are responsible for the death of Commander Mary Winchester. 30 years ago they attacked the USS Durus and the crew. Our Captain and First Officer were children aboard that ship." Dean stared at Cas. He felt rage and fear start to boil in him.
Dean's right. He shouldn't feel. Anything. Period. But, after all, he does have the fastest learning computer in history. Could he learn to care, to show devotion, to love ...
“I’ll take the demerit then.”
"Please … I don't …" Dean sputtered, feeling blood stain his mouth. He closed his eyes expecting another fatal heat wave, but felt nothing. When he opened his eyes, the group of Romulans were back at the opening. Dean strained to see what they were looking at, and his eyes widened when he saw a figure running towards the Romulans. The figure knocked two of the men down in one swift shove and made it past the opening. Dean squinted and wiped his face with his free hand, trying to see who it was. A lab coat flashed and he knew.
May 3rd, 2023
"Now, We have some diagnostics to run before we get you on the shooting range," Uriel says, turning his back. Unit 13 turns to follow the orders easily and makes it almost past the glass doorway when he stops. He turns his head barely, just enough to see Dean still on the ground, one knee now pulled to his chest. He won't take his eyes off of Unit 13.
The two men land against a car parked in front of the Impala. Castiel stands and turns his back to Gadreel.
“Thank you, Cas. For everything.” Sam says as they both stand.
Red fills Unit 13's vision. As the red goes from a crimson to dark maroon and then to a cool grey, their surroundings settle into place. They see a grey concrete room and thick dark cables running towards them along the ground. Words flash across their vision.
"Lemme guess, no Lethal Weapon in the future?” Dean says. Castiel’s blank stare answers the question for him.
Castiel grabs a sleeping roll and shoves it slowly under Dean's head, careful to avoid a freshly bandaged cut on Dean’s neck. He pulls a blanket up over Dean and places a pistol near his hands. Dean feels safer that way, even in his sleep. Castiel stands, picking up the rifle as he moves to the small triangular opening to the cave. He leans against the cold concrete and scans down the cave corridor. Nothing comes up. Just darkness, with the occasional shift in the moonlight through the skylights. His time at night is spent staring down the cave and glancing back to watch Dean sleep. It's the best he can do these days.
“What should I have said Cas, ‘By the way while you were being ripped apart nerve by nerve by your own brother, I snooped around in your memory. Sorry!’ Besides, that entry was during the Academy, why didn’t
"So, Captain, we obviously have no reason to fight these people. What's our move?" Dean looked at Sam. He knew what he had to do. He couldn’t let Lucifer get away, no matter what his father said.
"Well, what's the ship complement, who are we dealing with here?"
“Yes.”
Dean turns back to face Castiel. Their eyes meet. Castiel can't help but scream his name.
“You came all this way from sick bay to discuss hyposprays? And you didn’t even take the extra shore leave I gave the rest of the crew after the funeral. Cas, what’s going on? If it’s still about Samandriel, it’s okay. The funeral was only a few days ago. It's ok to feel sad. Talk to me…”
"Did you see a woman. Blonde, yellow uniform." Ejhil looked to Dean and took a few tentative steps away.
“We have to leave, now.” Castiel turns back to Dean. Dean slowly looks to Castiel and then back to the rubble.
“Computer, Evassive Manuver Theta” Sam said.
“God dammit Cas!” He growled. He rested his hands on his hips, not bothering to check if he had injured himself.
Castiel looks at him, now with moonlight shining over half of Dean's face, the light illuminating the green in his eyes, and the light freckles on his face. A flash of an older Dean, in the same position, in a similar moonlight blinks into Castiel's memory.
“Got it Garth, we’ll see you soon.” Dean said.
Dean blinked at Cas. Sure, the guy had had some crying fits in his time, but they were few and far between. Dean never thought Cas was scared.
“You don’t have to tell me twice,” Dean says grinning as he swings his arm around Cas’ shoulders. The pair walk into the roadhouse and the place erupts into booze, laughing, and singing.
He remembers bits and pieces, literally being welded together by Dean's hands. Other humans helped but it was mostly Dean who did that. He programmed and put Castiel together. Piece by piece.
“Captain, it’s Ash, we found them.”
Dean made his way to the transporter room after stopping at his quarters to change and shave. Dean soon found himself being transported back to Starfleet Headquarters. He greeted old professors and made his way to Admiral Winchester's office. He stood in front of the sliding door and pulled at his uniform, and ran a hand through his hair.
“Really.” Lucifers eyes trailed over every inch of the bridge. “How can I be sure this isn’t a ruse?”
“Castiel.” Dean said, firmer. Cas blinked and looked up. His lips quivered and his midnight blue eyes were pierced with fear.
“How are you, Cas?”
“Letting my emotions get in the way.” He mumbled. “You remember Cas is the Vulcan and not you right, Sam?” Dean said as Sam chuckled and went for the door.
Dean looked around and shook his head. He crossed his arms and cocked his head to one side.
"Well, you heard her. We go after Lucifer. Sam you have the bridge. Damage his cube as much as possible, but don't destroy it until Cas is safe. Use everything we've got. Keep working on the engines. We need top speed in case Lucifer decides to tuck tail and run. I'll get Cas." Dean said. He jogged to the turbo lift and stepped inside. He knew he probably was the only one who could get through to Cas but how. What the hell would stop a Vulcan on a mindless rampage? Dean could try knocking him out, but if half the security team couldn’t do it, he probably couldn’t either. He stepped out of the turbo lift and sprinted to Castiel's quarters. Just before the turn, he spotted Ellen, and several wounded security Officers.
"Ship’s files. The name of the ship was well hidden, but it is the duty of the Chief Medical officer to know family history. This is yours." Castiel said simply. Another moment of silence and stares passed. Dean spoke again, never looking away from Castiel.
"Let me look at Unit 13." The other man says. He wears a similar dark grey jumpsuit, only he has a red band across the chest with the number 0943 plastered across it. The red band pings a line of programming in Unit 13, telling them they must do no harm to this man. The man moves into the room and regards the other man with a disjointed look, washing his eyes over his posture. Unit 13 runs a scan on the second man.
