But now, Sherlock stared back at John, checking in with him, taking care of him. John met his eyes and nodded more confidently than he felt.

He didn’t need silence. That wasn’t why he stayed here anymore. John listened to Sherlock’s deep, perfectly even breaths, and knew he was awake.

Sherlock peered at the man, finally faced with a puzzle he could solve. What had changed, that John would share this with him now? Whatever secret

"I'm working," Sherlock replied, climbing over the railing to balance on a stone wall. John tried to ignore how the usually perfectly balanced genius
John got up slowly, blowing out a heavy breath to join Sherlock standing in front of the staircase. Sherlock stared down at him, waiting to be crushed.
"Clearly. Go and have some more," Sherlock said, stalling for time. Mycroft smiled at him. Trusting him now, now that he was listening to John? That was

Sherlock unguarded. But then… it didn't seem right to abuse that, to get answers to questions Sherlock would keep private, if sober.
John exhaled and pushed his head between his knees. He was risking hyperventilating. Sherlock had faked his death. And never contacted him, never told him.

“And where have you been?” Mrs. Hudson asked, scowling at John's sodden skin shoes as she drew him into a hug. “Those are not coming into my flats, you know,” she stated, wagging a finger at him. John couldn't care less. “And -who?” she asked, blinking down at the dog, apparently just noticing the huge animal by John's side. John laid a hand over Gladstone's soft head, wondering what he'd do if Mrs. Hudson rejected the animal. Live elsewhere in London? That felt impossible.
"So, Janine. That went well, looked like," John started, not wanting to sit in silence. Sherlock didn't respond. "Well, except for the mugs, or the

The police coming for them. There was something wrong about that. Something bad. Something about John. Sherlock pried himself up from the white carpet,

John woke up to a bright light flashing over his face. He blinked up at it, blinded for a moment, to see Mike holding a camera before the light flashed again. John tried desperately to think of any clue he could give and just rolled out of the way so the white line on the floor was exposed before Mike took another shot. He tried to think of some fancy clue, holding up four fingers to mean...something that Sherlock could use, but he still hadn't come up with anything when Mike stopped and walked away.

Sherlock chuckled and smirked as he walked past Donovan's gobsmacked face to duck through the restaurant's broken doorway.

John walked across the room to flick on the overhead light and stood over his desk, staring at the maps and papers and names spread across it.
"-Children -taken?" John reminded him. Sherlock lowered his head again to concentrate on scraping at the floor. John sighed and got back up.

"I checked with the landlord and the man who lived there died," she pronounced dramatically. John blinked, trying to catch up. Whose landlord? Which man?
The grip tightened. John rolled, letting his back scream in pain and his hair snag against the man's grip. Mike was leaning down, one knee almost against

John stood up from the pelt suddenly, catching Sherlock's attention. He crossed the kitchen to the table and climbed up onto the chair. Sherlock frowned,
February came too slowly. The sun began to break the horizon again, only to dip back down too soon in every afternoon. The snow stayed deep and drifted over the door within hours of clearing it. Sherlock redid each of his experiments as the winter began to fade, until he could tell John the exact temperature from the ice around the door, the mouse turds inside, the way the smoke pulled up through the stove pipe, and how quickly a meal froze up again if left uneaten by the window.
"It's fine," he said instead, turning away. He didn't want to think about anything else. John was going to die, at this rate.
"Excellent," Sherlock declared and spun on his heel. "Let's ask Mycroft to let us steal his laptop 'upon which depends the safety of the free world'," he
"You're a bit gay, John," he said easily and John laughed. That made it easier. This was something they could joke about, homophobia in all its forms.

"I'm lying to her, John," Sherlock blurted, just before the door to the bedroom opened. John opened his mouth to speak but nothing came out.
"No, I mean… how do you know about him? I don't think I've ever mentioned him," John backtracked, shaking his head.
