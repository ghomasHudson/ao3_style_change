“Jake, look, this isn’t going to be easy for you,” she sighs. I wonder whether we should give them some privacy but as we’re all still standing in the doorway, I don’t know where Sherlock and I could go. I look at Sherlock who doesn’t seem concerned.
Now, they’re on their way back to the Inn. Despite all the events taking place in the last hour, John hasn’t forgotten the incident at the lab earlier. He’s still pissed, to say the least. Once they arrive back at the hotel, he storms out of the car, leaving Sherlock to pay the ride for once. It has gotten too late for the Inn to still be open, so John fishes for the front door keys in his pockets. The yard is empty and quiet, and apart from a tiny street lamp there’s only the moon adding light to the scenery. After half a minute of unsuccessful searching, John can hear the car driving off into the distance and large footsteps approaching from behind.
We say our goodbyes and the situation manages to get awkward when I stretch out my hand while she tries to hug me. As I turn around to resume my walk, I hear Molly’s voice from behind once more.
“Sherlock, there’s nothing wrong with being afraid.” John shifts forward in his chair again. “We all are, sometimes.”
“We need bomb disposal,” John says. His face is white as a sheet and Sherlock silently curses himself for not sending John off with Lestrade.
“Even though I could talk about Scotland Yard’s incompetence all day, tell us about your case, Mr. Simon,” Sherlock says while stirring in his cup.
“Fine, but you need to fill out some paperwork later,” the man tells John before pacing towards the building behind them.
“Do you really... you mean...  are you sure?” Was all he was capable of saying. His heart was beating too fast and for a moment he forgot to breathe.
“No, I meant on this day. You know, the 29th of January.” I clear my throat. He has probably forgotten about that. It’s not even important, and why would someone who deleted the solar system remember the day he met his flatmate?
“Because,” Dr. Watson grunts, levering himself back to his feet and glaring at them both in turn. Mycroft blinks, mildly offended by the accusatory look. “I’m not in the mood to watch you two bitch at each other over the threshold for the rest of the day. At least do it in the flat, for God’s sake.”
There is a long silence in which Mycroft stands completely still, wary of any wayward creaking floorboards which might give away his hidden position behind the door. Then, Dr. Watson chuckles in a few nervous sounding puffs of breath, breaking the silence. “Go on and embarrass yourself a little more, John,” he mutters self-consciously to himself. He sighs heavily and looks at the floor before continuing, but his voice is still clear and strong. “Yeah, okay. Not that you don’t already know this, but, simply put...you’re amazing, Sherlock. I think you’re probably the most remarkable human being I’ve ever known if I’m being completely honest. You must know that.”
He pushes the intrusive thoughts aside, and reaches into the side of his coat, grasps the files. “What I
Sherlock’s soft lips pull away from his too soon and John wonders if it really was just a tactic to shut him up or if Sherlock had actually wanted to kiss him. Sherlock’s forehead leans against his.
When John wakes in the morning, his face is stuck to his pillow, and from the uncomfortable stillness of his muscles he knows he must have spent several hours sleeping in the same position, unmoving. He stretches carefully, trying to coax his body into movement, and promptly remembers the night before with cheek-reddening clarity; hoping frantically that it hadn’t just been the most realistic dream of his sad, sad life. His eyes fall on the wet, tattered old flannel still laying on his nightstand, and he sighs his relief. The last thing he vaguely remembers is the sensation of it against his stomach, wiping up their mess. He hopes he hadn’t made too much a fool of himself in his post-sex delirium.
The other paramedic approaches from the front with a penlight, but John easily blocks the poor bloke’s path and snatches the light out of his hand. “Dr. Watson,” he swiftly introduces. “And
Before his sleep addled brain can catch up, John is on his feet, propelling himself forward. And then he is wrapped around Sherlock, gripping him tight, as if he's afraid he'll somehow disintegrate if he lets up on his hold. He's here, he's
feel things that way. And it’s that knowledge that makes him realise what he should’ve seen all along. He’d choose Sherlock over and over again – no woman could ever reach the same level of admiration and love John feels for the consulting detective in front of him.
“Mmh, that’s quite correct.” For some reason Sherlock feels heat rising to his cheeks. Maybe Angelo should regulate the restaurant’s heating every once in a while.
“Look, Sherlock, I hope you understand that this, er, thing between us isn’t easy for me. I’m a married man and I haven’t even told my wife what happened the other day. I think it’s best if we don’t see each other again and forget about the whole thing. But an hour ago I was on my way back from work when I suddenly felt –“.
The air has gotten a bit chilly and Sherlock feels a goose bump crawling onto his arms. He mentally curses himself for not bringing his Belstaff..
“John,” Sherlock says, his voice even deeper than usual. His eyes that currently shine dark blue in the dim light of the hallway stare at me, before he adds “We should leave.”
In retrospect, I should’ve known that this was bound to happen. She refused to call him Sherlock because he’s like a father to her. I briefly wonder where she picked up the expression. She’s always called me daddy. Sherlock takes her back to the bench and I follow them. I haven’t really seen his face, and desperately hope that he won’t freak out.
Later that day, I decide to take a walk to the park. It wasn’t really a conscious decision. Sometimes the room just gets a bit too small, and I feel like the gun in the drawer stares at me. So I go out. I like to watch other people, strangers. Watch them enjoy their lives. I envy them, because they do not realise how lucky they are. However, when I actually reach the park, I always want to leave as soon as possible. I don’t like walking around with my cane. I feel like people are staring at me.
Back at the flat, we eat our meals on the sofa. The take-away boxes are spread out in front of us on the couch table. The food is delicious, I can’t deny that. Sherlock talks more about the case, probably simultaneously explaining his theories to me and deciding which one is the most probable one to himself. I listen and try not to interrupt his thought process too often. Even though we are stuck with the case, he seems content. His now blue eyes are gleaming with anticipation.
“We’ve already done the standard tests; his brain indicates normal activity. Considering his traumatic injury and the brain surgery it’s completely normal for him to suffer from temporary amnesia. Your husband is most likely going to wake up tomorrow and you’ll laugh at his confusion together.”
John narrowed his eyes at Sherlock, who shrugged at him apologetically. “But we’ll bring Daddy some ice-cream,” he added.
A hand reaches up to clutch the side of his neck as they rut against each other, and before he knows it he is being pulled down to rest his head somewhere between Sherlock’s chest and his shoulder. “I’ve got you, John, I have you. Let go with me, it’s alright,” Sherlock pants in his ear, pulling him somehow closer against his body to prove the validity of his words.
. Hadn’t it? They had both needed the comfort; like how a kid sleeps in their parent's bed during a thunderstorm. To know that they're safe.
Mycroft shakes his head politely in response, though his feet are throbbing from his extra time on the treadmill that morning. Sherlock scoffs, “You sit, John. Trust me, he doesn’t need to sit on his fat arse any more than he already does. I suppose if he really had to, he could sit on the floor like a dog.” He chuckles dryly at his own joke as he sips at his lukewarm tea.
When Mycroft steps out of the town car and onto the pavement thinly veiled with snow, there is the tempting smell of cinnamon and apple coming from the cafe just in front of him, and a young, frayed looking violinist playing “Joy to the World” just up on the corner of Baker Street, his case open expectantly at his feet.
He narrows those piercing eyes on him. “What we did last night. You’ve done that before.” His tone is on the edge of accusatory, and John knows why, obviously.
Probably assuming he isn’t being watched, the doctor pauses a moment in his ministrations. He cranes his neck slowly downward to look more closely at the other man’s face, and Sally sees a very soft smile begin to grace his lips. He lifts a hand and uses one finger to brush a soaked curl off Sherlock’s forehead. Her eyes widen as she watches them, nearly transfixed. Lestrade clears his throat and Sally rapidly averts her gaze from the mirror as John’s head snaps up in surprise. She catches Lestrade’s pointed gaze on her as she looks away, and they share a look which is silent but packed full of meaning. “He gonna be alright?” Lestrade asks, careful to keep his voice at a lower volume in regards to the sleeping detective. Sally shakes her head just a little, as if to clear it.
“What about you, then?” Lestrade asks, glancing away from the road momentarily to look in the rear view with concern. “Hypothermia and all that? You were in the water, too,” he informs, as if the doctor isn’t dripping wet enough to tell that for himself.
“Jameson,” he says to the driver, and the young man glances dutifully back at him through the mirror, as per usual. “You can expect me back in…” he glances at his watch, allows a sigh at the expectation that he will be chased out of the flat fairly quickly. “Oh, ten minutes, at the most. I shall call to inform you if I will be needing any longer.”
“No, don't be,” Sherlock says, and his tone is compassionate in a way John has only ever heard him be with Mrs. Hudson—though it's different, somehow, with him. “Just tell me. I don’t want—” a stuttered, frustrated sigh. “—I don’t want you to hide yourself from me. You know it usually doesn’t work, anyhow.”
“No, Sherlock. Sorry—I was just,” he sighs, clenches his eyes shut and focuses on making a coherent sentence come out of his mouth. “I was just...looking at you. I l—” he catches himself, amends what he almost let slip. “I
The smell emanating from the flat now is much different, though, and thankfully there is no obvious shouting or stomping to be heard among the various other noises coming from inside. Sherlock must not be in a strop today then—or if so, it’s a blessedly quiet one. He glances at his watch as he pushes the door open—God, was it really six already? No wonder he was losing it—he hadn’t eaten anything since nine o’clock that morning.
As a surly teenager, Sherlock still did not resign to their efforts, and instead began with a new approach, resorting to vindictively scraping his bow across the strings with purposefully earsplitting discordance when faced again with their unrelenting requests for
She’s broken out of her frustrated thoughts by the sounds of a struggle, followed by an indecipherable shout, then the cacophonous sound of a splash from a bit further down on the river. She stands straight up, heart stuttering in alarm. She fumbles for her radio, holds it up to her mouth. “Boss? All right?”
Nobody argues this time around and Mycroft takes a seat, opening up his file and starting in on the case he’d brought them. John chooses to lean against Sherlock’s chair instead of any other surface, which Mycroft notes with a bit of intrigue. Sherlock stays otherwise quiet, only rolling his eyes when Mycroft mentions the amount of legwork involved. Dr. Watson nudges him good-naturedly, and Mycroft is quite astounded at the level of comfort present between the two. Sherlock especially had never been so lax and adjustable with anyone; not with anyone Mycroft had ever met. Hell, he thinks, the last time mother chastised him, Sherlock had ignored her calls for seven months just out of spite. With John Watson, though, they were back to laughter and secret looks within minutes. Very, very intriguing, indeed.
“Oh, that’s not just my doing,” John said and smiled after Rosie and Sherlock. “So, another year gone by?”
“I’m teaching there. Yeah, bright young things like we used to be. God, I hate them,” he replies. I have to laugh at that. I can’t really imagine Mike being a teacher kind of person, but I think he secretly enjoys it. He’s always been more of a down-to-earth type of guy.
“I can shout however bloody much I want to,” I yell. “Has it never occurred to you, that I –” I stop myself before I say something I’m gonna regret.
The leader of the trio, clearly a dim-witted man from the Southern states with a bad temper, demands Sherlock to open the safe. He keeps up a polite charade, but when that doesn’t work, he turns to stronger measures.
Sherlock does as he’s told and fills the mugs with the tea John prepared. His eyes wander to the Christmas tree and he freezes upon seeing a wrapped up gift. This can’t be from Mrs. Hudson, or from Molly, or – he has to smirk at the very thought of it – from Mycroft. These people will only come around later for a (predictably boring) Christmas dinner that Sherlock would much rather exchange for a calm evening with John alone. So the present must be from John. And it must be for him.
“I’ve told you that I won’t be at home tonight, haven’t I?” John asks, taking a bite from his buttered toast.
When Sherlock examines me I can see the worry clear on his face. Is he worried I can’t take this? That it reminds me of everything I’ve lost? Well, he’s right, to be fair, but I need to get myself together. This is our first proper case in ages and I want to get it right.
John says nothing. Sherlock feels humiliated. What was he thinking? Did the proximity to John shut down his mind completely? The worst thing is, he can’t even see John’s face properly, can’t deduce what John could possibly be thinking right now. Maybe the only way out of this is to finally confess everything to John. John is going to be mad, he probably won’t admit it right away, but eventually he’ll want Sherlock to sleep elsewhere. He’ll probably refuse to talk to him for a week, but can it get any worse than this?
Half an hour later, after the medical tests, John has calmed down enough for Sherlock and Dr. Molder (who told Sherlock that he had already introduced himself three days ago) to enter his room again. Sherlock called Mycroft to inform him about John’s state, and asked him to inform everyone else. He can’t deal with that right now. The room is humid and hot, but the window is open enough to let in a warm summer breeze. John is still lying in his bed, brows furrowed and arms crossed, looking up at Sherlock and the doctor expectantly.
“Gauze, thermometer, gloves,” John rattles off, and the paramedics rush to do his bidding. Sally has the thought that little Dr. Watson in his fuzzy jumpers can be quite commanding when he so decides to be. His presence has changed almost completely, his posture distinctly different. She supposes this is the Captain John Watson that the military knew, not the one that follows Sherlock around like a lost dog. He presses the gauze firmly to a spot on the back of Sherlock’s head, then grabs the wrist of the paramedic standing behind Sherlock and places it there, like a human paperweight. When the thermometer beeps and John pulls it out of Sherlock’s mouth, John curses again, more vehemently this time.
When Rosie was all tucked in that night, John needed something stronger than tea. He opened their last bottle of wine and filled two glasses with the white liquid. Sherlock was tidying up the living room table when John pressed the glass into his hand. He sat down at the table and pinched the back of his nose.
Sherlock ends up calling Mycroft from the train. As usual, his plague of a brother deduces everything he needs to know within the span of 20 seconds.
“Wow, John, you really shouldn’t overdo it before we actually get married. Otherwise I will have too high expectations.” She smiles at me and takes the coffee mug out of my hand.
Reluctantly, Sherlock stands up. John is right. There is a cyclist approaching the inn, coming from the direction of Mr. Saltire’s mansion. The mansion has a direct access to the inn, a small path that is otherwise unused. The proximity to the mansion was the main reason why Dr. Huxtable had picked this inn for Sherlock and John. The cyclist leaves his bike outside and enters the backdoor of the inn.
“Where’s the carriage?” John pants. He comes to a halt next to Sherlock, standing way to close and certainly not close enough.
Sherlock isn’t sure he understands her request correctly. Surely she can’t mean that. When he doesn’t reply, Mary continues.
Sherlock replies without a second thought. With John’s life on the line, there’s nothing he wouldn’t do. “I’ll come back and I will find your underground terror cell.” His voice is firm, but he’s shaking inside.
He keeps kissing my erection and simultaneously rubs his fingers over my balls. God, this isn’t gonna take long.
“Yeah, but you usually refuse to watch it with me.” Sherlock can feel John’s eyes resting on him. He can also feel the side of John’s arm almost touching his. He decides that he doesn’t mind staying in this position a bit longer.
“… cause Henry found them; so did the tour guide bloke. We all heard something… Maybe we should just look for whoever’s got a big dog.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I didn’t forget it – I deleted it. You know how my mind works, John. I only keep the important data.”
What had Mummy once told him about panic attacks? ‘Take a deep breath – in through the nose, out through the mouth. Close your eyes if it helps. You’re going to be okay.’ Sherlock tries following through with the steps, but his mind is still swirling.
He can see the detective’s mind slowly returning to the present. “Y... yes, John. I felt it, too. That was – “
“Better?” he asks after changing into his only black shirt. It sits a bit too tightly, considering John bought it ages ago, but he doesn’t really mind.
26 minutes later, he arrives at Baker Street, his heart hammering in his chest. He uses his key without caring to knock first, and breathlessly storms into Sherlock’s flat. He doesn’t have the slightest idea of what he’s going to say, but he knows this is the only place on earth he wants to be.
He clears his throat. A woman sitting across from him gives him a gorgeous smile. She raises an eyebrow expectantly, probably trying to flirt with John, so he politely returns the smile before looking away. His divorce has gone through a couple of months ago, in May, feeling even more rushed than his marriage, but he’s certainly not looking for a new partner. He knows that he’ll never be as happy as he was with Sherlock, and he has no desire to be with anyone else.
Sherlock wants to close the distance between them and hold John till the world ends. He closes his eyes for a second and fights the impulse instead. “I missed you, too.”
And just like that, the moment Sherlock desperately longed for, feared with all his heart and was sure would never occur, has arrived. He stays in the courtyard with his phone in hand, and for a moment he sees himself in a different courtyard with John; a moment he has replayed a million times in his mind already, but instead of the usual pain he feels something a lot more dangerous blossoming inside of him.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. Obviously not many people share his skills of deduction, but even Angelo should be able to see the gold wedding band on John’s finger that’s notable in its absence on Sherlock’s.
Sherlock takes a deep breath, and begins. He tells John everything, from their meeting back in 2010, the next one and a half years of wild chases through London, his faked suicide, his return in 2013 and how he found John engaged to Mary. John only interrupts him with short questions occasionally, but his expressions change back and forth from wonder to amazement to disbelief to sadness to curiousness. Sherlock also tells John about his and Mary’s wedding and how he found out Mary was pregnant, even though the memories never fail to hurt him. He tells John about Mary’s past vaguely, and when he explains that Mary shot him John’s expression turns into horror.
Sherlock has to swallow hard. He should tell John that he’s got no reason to thank him. In fact, John should yell at him, beat him, hate him, if he knew the truth. But something is holding Sherlock back from confessing to John. They’ve made such good progress this past week; he doesn’t want to ruin what they’re carefully starting to rebuilt.
“Oh is that so? Because last time I checked, I was the expert on, I quote, ‘emotions and these dull human things’.”
“Look!” Sherlock interrupts. He holds up the container for me to see the violet colour vaporising in it. I can’t help but be amazed. Sherlock carefully extracts the phone from the container and takes a closer look.
Oh for heaven’s sake. “No, Mike’s great, but he’s not my best friend.” Who would’ve thought that Sherlock could be so slow? He gives me a long look, probably trying to invent some other friend for me. I should definitely enlighten him before he suggests Mycroft.
Once the tea is prepared, they sit down on the two armchairs facing each other. Sherlock realises that John hasn’t even seen the flat, yet. And he never will, he reminds himself.
They enjoy their breakfast together, talking about this and that. Obviously John still has a lot to catch up on, but it seems Greg did a pretty good job at providing him with information during the three weeks Sherlock wasn’t in contact with him. After the last toast is gone, Sherlock retrieves his gift from the pocket of his dressing gown. He thought about this for quite a while, but still isn’t sure whether John will like or even accept the gift. It’s a risk he has decided he’s willing to take.
“I didn’t know how. I wanted to wait until you remembered, but now I know that you might never gain your memories back; and that’s okay, because you’re still my John; but I needed to tell you. I’m sorry.”
Sherlock’s legs moved automatically. Once he stood closer, John took Sherlock’s hands into his own and let them hang between them. Sherlock’s mind started swirling.
“John,” Sherlock said, taking John’s hand into his own. “There are so many words I meant to say all those years ago, and I still do. You would not believe how many times I had to hold words inside this past month. I wanted to tell you that I loved you, that I never wanted the month to end, that meeting you was the best thing that ever happened to me,” he paused, feeling his voice break. John looked at him encouragingly with nothing but love in his eyes.
“Isn’t that a bit fast for a definite judgment?” Sherlock hears John asking. He needs to smile. In this way, John has always been the same.
“Yes, of course, John. Yes. You know that you’re the only person I’ve ever loved, and you will be until the end of my days.” He reached up to John and pulled him close with his hand on John’s coat collar and the other on his back. Sherlock kissed John like they weren’t on a swing in a park in the rain; like they were the only two people in the world.
With a content smile on his face, John follows Sherlock back into the car. They arrive at the client’s house and John gets to know the person who’s responsible for his weekend trip. Albeit being an intelligent and nice fellow, Henry seems to be always on one’s guard, his eyes scanning his surroundings constantly. Being in his presence makes John feel weirdly paranoid as well. Over a cup of coffee, Sherlock reveals his plan to return to the moor at night, causing Henry’s already pale face to lighten a few shades.
Deep down John knows that he can’t only blame Mary for the fight. He should’ve been more understanding, but then what? The hard truth is that he’s not willing to sacrifice his friendship with Sherlock for Mary. So what else is he supposed to do?
He saw Sherlock’s eyes widening and was pleased with himself for evoking such reaction. Even though they had been living together for so many years, the two of them had never had that type of friendship where one would just undress in front of the other, even though John had seen Sherlock inside the flat with no more than his bed sheets on more times than he could count.
It has become a routine of theirs, reading the newspaper during breakfast. For lunch, they’re both at work most of the time, and during dinner they usually watch whatever’s on the telly. Mary looks up from the local news with a raised eyebrow.
“Why do you even care? I thought you’d be glad! You don’t have to feel bad for fucking Sherlock, now that you know I’m off enjoying myself, too. Would you rather wish for me to be alone, whilst you’re having the time of your life with your soulmate?”
did a wonderful job not only betaing this fic but also helping me with the sex scene. As you might have noticed, I'm not a native speaker and was very insecure about this part, so her help was greatly appreciated.
“There’s more in the cab,” I say, panting and placing the bag onto the floor. I return with the second and third bag full of supplies and heap them into the living room, as well. Mary seems amused and frightened at the same time.
“If you want to get better, you need warmth – especially around your throat. Where do you keep your jumpers?”
“It’s a piece that I wrote for our wedding. It’s called ‘The Vow’.” He slowly places the violin back into the case and sits down in his chair. John’s eyes follow his movement, but he doesn’t sit down himself.
Sherlock starts to think about the way John cares for his patients, about how he treats victims’ bereaved with a kindness Sherlock could never imitate, how he saved Sherlock’s life over and over again, risking his own in the process, how he’s the only person in the world willing to accept Sherlock for who he truly is. Words don’t seem to do him justice, but Sherlock tries anyway.
On the plus side, they – or rather Sherlock – finally solved the case. As usual, he was able to put the pieces together using his mind palace. Apparently Bob Franklyn, a scientist at Baskerville who participated in a secret military project called ‘The  HOUND Project’ some twenty years ago, used a drug to fill Henry’s heart with fear after killing his father. The project, in trying to create an anti-personnel weapon to use against American enemies, accidentally created a drug causing hallucinations, paranoia and frontal lobe damages, amongst other things. The experiment was dismissed, much to the displeasure of the enthusiastic Bob Franklyn, who decided to continue working on the drug on British grounds.
After Mike and I say our goodbyes, because he had to return to one of his classes and I had to pretend to have an important appointment, I take the tube back to the flat. On my way, I keep thinking about the guy I just encountered. Sherlock Holmes. It’s a silly name, actually, like from another century. He was quite arrogant, now that I’m thinking about it. The way he told the woman that her mouth looked too small, and how he basically told me that my limp was psychosomatic. That’s not something you normally say to someone you just met. He’s probably mad. But he was also strangely likeable, somehow. I keep wondering how he knew so much about my life, I’m usually very closed off when it comes to the relationship with my sister (at least he got something wrong). It’s intriguing. I will definitely look at the flat with him, tomorrow. I think we could work as flatmates. Sometimes you meet someone and you just know that you’ll get along, and, for some reason, I think we will.
Henry joins John in trying to catch up with Sherlock. They must be looking like two fools, attempting to follow Sherlock’s large footsteps in the dark.
After a shortened version of the last decade is packed into three hours of talking, John decides that he wants to get some sleep. He wasn’t very eager to find out the details of his proposal or their wedding, so Sherlock decides to leave that for another time. Maybe it’s best to tell him all about that while they’re at the places the events happened, so that John can remember more easily. After showing John the rest of the flat he follows him into the bathroom where they brush their teeth in silence. John is understandably not hungry and Sherlock couldn’t care less about his transport at the moment. Once ready for bed, they emerge from the bathroom and Sherlock holds the bedroom door open for John. When he follows him, his husband is standing in the middle of the room looking utterly lost. He looks at the bed with the two pillows, two bed sheets, two night stands and the other obvious signs of it being occupied by a couple.
Sherlock can’t keep himself from slightly blushing at the compliment. “Oh that. Well, there are no cows here, as you made me realise yesterday, so I figured they were accomplished by shoeing the horses with shoes shaped like cows’ hooves.”
“You had no right to make that decision for me… for us! You didn’t give me a chance to explain, not even a single minute to stop you, to talk to you!”
“Do you have any idea how hard this is for me? One day I come back from the war in 2010 and the next day I’m married to a man I don’t even know and it’s ten years later. I’ve missed a decade of my life, Sherlock! I was married to someone who’s dead and who I can’t even grief because I don’t remember her! I lost a child I don’t even remember having in the first place! And that’s not even it; I also feel guilty towards you all the time. I know what I said earlier, and I mean it, I really am thankful for your patience; but don’t you think I realise that you’d rather be with the old version of me?! That you’re upset with me for not remembering you?” John is now screaming.
Finding your soulmate is something most people longed for growing-up in John’s infancy, making it specifically hard for young teenage boys to encounter a meaningless love-affair. John grew up with only a few persons in his immediate environment – neither his parents nor his grandparents were soulmates – and he didn’t feel like he was missing out. By the time he joined the army, the Western world’s perception of love had already changed significantly. Less and less people found their significant others, leaving them lonely and depressed until they decided to screw the universe and find someone suitable off their own bat. Trying to stop a major wave of depression, the government finally declared that two people who aren’t soulmates can get married without the previously obligatory psychological consultancy, basing their change in course on a scientific study from 1986. The new law caused a flood of marriages between non-persons who finally found the convincing reason to unite in spite of not being told so by the universe. After that, cases of soulmates kept getting rarer and rarer, despite the efforts of several “old-fashioned” online dating sites proclaiming to be able to find your person within fourty-eight hours.
John looked up from the instruction of the foot-and-handprint set he had bought a couple of days ago, still not having found the part that told him how to remove the colour from human bodies effectively.
“Okay, that’s…good.” John can’t hide his grin on his way inside. He only manages to take a step forward before he finds himself pressed against the wall by Sherlock.
He opened his eyes and found Sherlock blinking at him, something close to vulnerability in his features. His curls were a blue mess and there was a streak of orange on his face where John had touched him mere seconds ago; and he looked almost achingly beautiful.
“So how did we get... together?” John finally asks. Sherlock can feel that it’s making John uncomfortable. He reminds himself that, to John, he is a complete stranger at the moment, who tells him they are married and engage in all sorts of activities together. It still hurts more than he could have ever imagined.
All of a sudden, a million pieces I never understood come together in my mind. I can see the images clearly. Sherlock claiming being married to his work. Irene saying ‘Look at us both’. Sherlock playing sad music on Christmas. Mine and Sherlock’s dinner at Angelo’s on our one-year anniversary. Sherlock being jealous of my girlfriends. Sherlock calling me his conductor of light. Sherlock saving my life over and over again. Sherlock’s words before he jumped. Sherlock begging me for forgiveness. Sherlock’s expression when he realised he was my best friend. The stag night. Sherlock calling me the bravest, wisest and kindest human being. Sherlock leaving my wedding early. Sherlock shooting Magnussen to save my wife. Sherlock’s look when he said ‘Sherlock is actually a girl’s name’. Sherlock forgiving Mary for shooting him. Sherlock helping me set up Rosie’s nursery. Sherlock allowing me to hit him because he thought he deserved it. Sherlock treating Rosie like his own daughter. Sherlock pointing a gun at his own brother and not me.
“Wait a second, I got married twice?! My wife passed away? When did that happen?” John asks. There is pure horror on his face. Sherlock briefly thinks about jumping out of the window. How is he supposed to tell John all about Mary and their baby? How is John supposed to believe him any of it?
John’s voice is all no nonsense and limitless patience, as if he’s talking to an unruly toddler. “Leave. Greg. Alone. Stop harassing him, and
Eventually John rolls himself out of bed and puts on a fresh pair of pants and pajama bottoms, and finds himself following the smell of sausage and warm, buttery scones downstairs. His stomach growls alarmingly.
“Well, gents,” Lestrade sighs, leaning his elbows on his knees. He tries to avoid the abominable glare Sherlock has directed at him. “It’s regrettable to say, but I
He holds it out to him and Mycroft takes it with a tense smile, opting to stand over next to the mantle lest his brother attack him like some kind of feral dog defending its territory. But John doesn’t sit, just stares at him quizzically.
Sherlock had discovered the definition of the word “sociopath” at age ten while hiding out in the library from the other children, latched onto it like the desperate mask which it was, and had never gone back. And he does a convincing enough job of proving it to everyone but Mycroft; but he has always seen through him, and always will be able to.
There is complete silence for a moment before Dr. Watson sits forward with hands cupped over his mouth in a gesture of some kind of awed wonderment. When he moves his hands to rest under his chin, there is a wide smile turning up his lips. “Sherlock, that was just...yeah. Wow. It was absolutely beautiful. Thank you...so much, for playing it for me.”
Fortunately for the sake of the entire family’s entertainment, Mummy had made it an immediate rule for both of them to learn at least one musical instrument and one foreign language in their primary years, while their neuroplasticity was still spongy and elastic. So while the family wasn't as enthralled with Mycroft's piano playing as they were with Sherlock's violin, Mycroft would end up obliging them anyway by tapping out a mechanically perfect rendition of some church hymn or another just to hush them up. And even though Sherlock seldom acquiesced to their requests, not once did they fail,
Dr. Watson groans and holds the bridge of his nose between thumb and forefinger, as if he has developed a sudden headache. “We’ll call as soon as we have something. Thanks, Mycroft,” he calls, and Mycroft waves over his shoulder. He passes the threshold and leaves the door cracked as it had been before. His phone vibrates in his pocket, and when he looks at the screen, sees there is a brand new text message from Jameson.
for me, Sherlock, and it’s okay if you don’t feel the same for me, it really is, I just can’t keep this to myself any longer, and I—”
Please review to let me know what you think, it adds fuel to my writing fire. Constructive criticism is always welcome!
John chews his food, swallows with a little difficulty before answering. “Had sex?” he asks, purposefully ignorant. “Yes, Sherlock, you know I have—”
John winces, but he still can’t help his own physical reaction to the words, and the way Sherlock speaks them; slow and accurate, voice deep and gravelly with sleep. John’s pants instantly start to tighten again just at the sound of it, and he hastily reaches out to cover himself with a blanket, face turning scarlet.
Sherlock had always refused to play the violin when they were younger. At least, he had refused to play for an audience. Whether it would be even remotely believable to anyone whom hadn’t grown up in the same household with Sherlock, there had been a time where the boy would have hidden under any number of tables to avoid having to face spectators.  As a small child, when Mummy or Aunty had asked him to put on a performance, he’d mulishly decline with a firm shake of his head and reproachfully narrowed eyes from beneath his mop of constantly unruly dark hair. Usually, as Mycroft remembers, this had happened at family gatherings like Christmas and Easter when both of them had been forced to “celebrate” while stuffed humiliatingly into obnoxiously festive jumpers. As if that hadn’t been bad enough in and of itself.
brother—Mycroft almost glimpses the one from before; in an instant he is shockingly redolent of the frightened, shy, and altruistic little boy who refused to tell Mycroft the names of his schoolyard bullies in fear of drawing too much attention or causing a fuss.
“Please, God,” Sherlock intones monotonously, quoting him. John breathes heavily, in and out, in and out, loud in the silent night. Sherlock has never confronted him about the nightmares before; though John always knows that on those bad nights there will inevitably come the melodic strains of what he thinks is Moonlight Sonata, being expertly coaxed from the violin to ease him through his residual terror.
do, because it would be both immoral and impossible to do with Sherlock sleeping like dead weight on top of him. The arm around John's chest tightens infinitesimally as if he can sense the direction of his thoughts. Maybe the maddening genius actually could, somehow.
The next time it happens, a week later, John wakes up with a jagged gasp, tears staining his cheeks. He takes a shaky breath in, lets it out on a long, unsteady exhale. His heart pounds like a jackhammer in his chest. It had been one of those horrifying dreams that felt just real enough to leave him trembling when he startled himself awake, a part of him unconvinced that it was actually just a dream.
In truth, Lestrade never would have minded. It’s Sally who’s making the sacrifice. John cocks his head at her as if confused by the offer, but doesn’t refuse it. She uses the radio at her hip to inform Lestrade, and he pulls the patrol car conveniently right up next to the ambulance. The paramedics, probably feeling rather useless, hand over a pile of extra shock blankets, and Lestrade hops out of the driver’s seat to help her line the backseat with them so as not to ruin the upholstery. She looks over to see that John’s gotten Sherlock standing now, though the detective still looks completely gone. Her eyes wander to John’s hand, which is vigorously rubbing the other man’s lower back, suspiciously close to his bum. She arches her eyebrows at him, and John flushes, mouth gaping open indignantly. “Oh for Christ’s sake—it’s for a medical purpose! Grow up.”
. Mummy had not been at all pleased, and eventually she had given up on it, and ceased asking either of them to play on holidays. For a time, Mycroft had wondered if Sherlock's prowess with the instrument was not what his music instructors claimed, and if that was why he so determinedly refused to play. But even though Sherlock was rarely known to practice outside of his music classes, on those nights Mycroft would hear him playing the songs alone in his bedroom when he believed the house to be asleep, a distinctly comfortable expertise in the way he coaxed sound from the violin that proved he had no difficulty at all with the instrument itself. It was perplexing even to Mycroft that his little brother had no issue showing off when it came to his intelligence, but kept his musical aptitude so wholly to himself. Soon enough though, Mycroft had gone off to Cambridge while Sherlock had fallen down a rabbit hole into drugs, and he had seldom had the inclination or the wherewithal to wonder over it since.
He really has no idea, John thinks in awe. He really doesn’t see the distinct interest in people’s eyes as they watch him swan around the city in his great big coat, and with an arse so distracting that it could make a nun stop to ogle at it. All Sherlock must glean from those looks are the accusations people like Sally Donovan and Arsehole Anderson spit at him.
The door to 221B sits slightly ajar, an unexpected warmth of light and sounds and smells drifting out into the hall. Lestrade hasn’t really been inside the flat very many times—and usually when he is there it’s only to pop in, tell Sherlock to get his arse to a crime scene—and pop out.The occasional drugs bust occurred only when he
“Greg!” John exclaims, looking surprised. It only takes a second for his face to split into a welcoming smile, which he reciprocates to the best of his abilities. “Well, come on in, don’t just stand there like a dunce.”
“And then that night, at the pool,” Sherlock’s hands tighten around his middle where they’d come to rest, voice lower now, more serious.
Mycroft feels his ears go hot with instant rage, but before he can open his mouth Dr. Watson has already taken control of it, and his posture and demeanor morph into something else, in a way Mycroft has not yet seen. His spine goes ramrod straight, and the look of calm disbelief he shoots Sherlock not only makes Mycroft himself want to take a step back, but has Sherlock looking at the floor in a rare display of instant regret.
Mycroft brushes snow flurries off the shoulder of his waistcoat and cocks his head to the side, listening closely. The song is slow and sweet, but he racks his mental inventory and finds the melody completely unfamiliar as he flicks through all the classics. Not Bach, or Vivaldi, or any of the other numerous artists he has filed away in his library. He’s aware that Sherlock composes occasionally, though he has never had the personal experience of, or much interest in, listening to such a creation. Even so, the music coming from the flat upstairs seems entirely too sweepingly romantic for his callous little brother to have put together himself.
“No,” Sherlock states crisply just before his bum hits the cushion, and Mycroft gasps indignantly, mouth floundering unattractively for a moment.
Sherlock sits in his customary spot at the kitchen table, hands clasped demurely over each other on the tabletop. He is gazing contemplatively into the distance, but when John walks in his focus shifts to meet his eyes unreadably. John recognizes the posture as one of Sherlock’s more troubling thinking poses. “Morning,” John greets, unsure.
over the roof of the car, so she relents, grumbling to herself as she gets in the passenger seat. John loads them into the backseat, and they’re off towards Baker Street. Once the doors are closed and they’re all boxed in, Sally catches a whiff of the wet-dumpster stench of the Thames coming from the back and cracks her window just enough for a few breaths of fresh air so that she doesn’t gag.
“Uh—no, I don’t trust him not to choke on it in his state. Probably couldn’t wake him up to drink it, anyway.” Sally nods and turns back to face the front, wondering what the bloody hell had gotten into her. Yesterday she would have said
Sherlock stares at the ceiling, but John sees—he isn't sure how but he sees the defensiveness starting to recede from his eyes, the metaphorical bridge being lowered over the metaphorical moat. John restrains himself from reaching out a hand to grab Sherlock's, settles for brushing a bare foot against his under the covers and passing it off as an accident. “Come on, I
Greg steps in cautiously, case files still hidden against his side. John passes the spoon in his hand over to Sherlock as he moves away to wash his hands in the sink. Sherlock stirs the sauce on the stove once more before covering the pan with a lid and turning the heat down. Greg has the passing thought of how odd it is to see Sherlock in a domestic setting like this. He’s even got a bloody kitchen towel patterned with butterflies slung over his shoulder. Most likely a borrow from Mrs. Hudson, he guesses. John comes up beside Sherlock and casually uses a corner of the towel to wipe his hands on before he claps Greg amiably on the shoulder. He opens his mouth to speak, before seeming to remember something. “Hang on.” He glances over his shoulder. “Sherlock, could you—”
“Mm. Yes, just as you are an unbelievable idiot,” Sherlock snaps, but his voice lacks the usual scorn.
Sherlock's face finally deigns to turn towards him, slowly. John shudders under the focus of his gaze. “I don't think we're any regular pair of “blokes”, do you?” he affects a goofy accent on the word and John snickers, unable to help himself. There's the hint of a smirk on Sherlock's face now, and John watches as he shakes his head and turns his face away, trying to hide the way his grin is expanding across his cheeks without his consent. John feels slightly victorious—
Sherlock was withholding evidence for a case. He would definitely do it more often, just to mess with the bastard, but his team (Sally) had outright refused to come back last time after finding a decapitated fish’s head wrapped in aluminum foil and hidden in a shoe box under Sherlock’s bed, with a meat thermometer sticking out of its eye socket. The mad detective had yelled up a storm as his “experiment” was tossed into the garbage by a very pale, suddenly very quiet Sergeant Donovan. She had spun away down the staircase with a hand held haltingly over her mouth (and looking distinctly green) as Sherlock indignantly filched it out of the bin and shouted insults after her.
? John blushes deeply at the connotations, aching to reach a hand down his pajama bottoms; which he distinctly
John clicks on it, and the comments section for The Case of Extraterrestrial Espionage pops up, displaying the message
This time the eye roll is a little more realistic. “Of course, you idiot. Similar to you, I knew very soon after we met that I would be lost without you. My blogger.” His voice softens favorably on the last word, and then John is being kissed again, but it is somehow sweeter this time than all of the others. A chaste brush of lips. He’d never figured Sherlock would be so inclined towards physical affection, but John is only happier to find that he is.
The next week, they work a particularly thrilling case involving a midnight chase through a corn maze and extremely convincingly fabricated UFOs. John had agreed with Sherlock that they keep their new relationship status on the downlow for the time being to give them a period of adjustment, and enough time to heedlessly enjoy it for awhile before the press got involved. Though Sherlock insisted that the lot over at Scotland Yard had an ongoing pool on when exactly they would give in and get together, and he was loathe to let Anderson win this month. How he knew was beyond John, but he didn’t doubt that he was more than likely spot on with it.
Mycroft sputters at the sheer indecency, wishing again for a moment that Mummy were there to reprimand him. He briefly shuts his eyes and takes a deep breath. Sherlock is always able to bring out the most childish parts of his personality, and Mycroft always, always lets himself get caught up in a futile argument, which only ever serves to entertain his brother’s juvenile hunger for conflict.
John, unbothered, smiles against his throat. “I don’t think I’ve ever heard you say please once since I’ve known you,” he chuckles, and pulls back to see the flushed discontent on Sherlock’s face. God, he never thought he would get to see him like this.
After what feels like a lifetime, they round the corner, all three of them looking particularly worse for wear.  Lestrade totes the handcuffed art thief, yanking harshly on the cuffs as he shoves him into the back of a squad car. Sherlock (who looks practically unconscious) and John are slower in their arrival, both sopping wet, John practically carrying the former as he supports his weight. The paramedics rush over to help, but the doctor brushes off their attempts and instead begins barking orders at them. The squad car holding the thief pulls out, the siren
” Sherlock hisses venomously, and Mycroft feels the uncommon urge to run. Oh, Lord, the car must be back, he thinks frantically. It had been at least ten minutes since Jameson had dropped him at the curb and Mycroft had let himself be distracted by his brother’s touching little concert. He had wasted time being stupidly inquisitive over trivial matters and hadn’t even made it into the flat yet, let alone thought to let poor Jameson know he would be needing a few more minutes.
He glances up through the crack in the door and sees Dr. Watson toss the case file down on the coffee table before walking over to roughly ruffle Sherlock’s hair. Mycroft blinks in astonishment. Sherlock tugs his head away in annoyance and tightens his arms over his chest. “You’re an utter arsehole, you know that?” Dr. Watson comments casually.
“Goodnight, John,” the ghosting pressure of lips on his temple makes him smile. John feels the fingers of Sherlock’s other hand lightly, absently caressing his cheek. John mumbles something sleepily into his shoulder.
They are both stock still for a moment, just staring at each other across what suddenly seems like far too much empty space between them. Sherlock’s breathing is just as labored as his, and there’s something almost desperate in his eyes, the faded blue t-shirt he wears hitching with every breath. John isn’t sure how much time stretches on before it happens, or who starts it; but suddenly they’re locked together, lips sloppily slotting against each other in a heated kiss.
Watson,” his voice dips low on the official title, and something funny happens in John’s stomach, like a tsunami of butterflies. Though Sherlock’s tone hasn’t noticeably varied from every other time he has casually spoken the name before, John discovers that while they lie in bed speaking in hushed voices, bodies close together, it sounds like Sherlock is saying something distinctly different.
is evident in his countenance, even if he doesn’t say it. “A world without you in it would be a miserable place for me, John.”
They actually end up having a fairly lovely meal, and Sherlock even behaves himself for the most part. He participates in the better topics of conversation, like John’s old medical journals, John and Sherlock’s past most riveting cases (and the newest NSY gossip), but doesn’t complain as much as he usually would when it turns more towards small talk; like the weather and what they had read in that morning’s newspaper or watched on the news.
Mycroft lets his mask slide into place, and gives his brother a typically unctuous smirk. “Ah, hello, brother mine. How courteous of you to answer the door,” he drawls. “May I come in?”
John shakes his head. Sherlock hasn’t deduced it yet, then. Good. There's no way he's exposing himself any more than he already has. He's already been crying in front of the man, for God's sake.
After a moment, Greg forces himself to stand from the sofa, preparing to excuse himself. The thought of going back to his flat seems less and less appealing as the seconds pass. Maybe he’ll just load up on coffee and go back to his office at NSY; after all, there are still two more stacks of unsolved cases to work through waiting for him on his desk. He opens his mouth to bid John a goodnight, but the doctor beats him to it, an eerily knowing look in his eyes. Seeing it reminds Lestrade that John is just as perceptive as Sherlock, but in the opposite way. Sherlock is a master at his craft like none he has ever seen, but John Watson could sniff out emotional turmoil three-hundred yards off with a pillowcase over his head, and that was a unique talent in and of itself.
That morning, over tea and toast and watching Sherlock fiddle with his laptop, (“Don't be silly, John, of course I've figured out your new password”) John realizes with a contemplative pause as he’s reading the newspaper, that he's more well-rested than he has been in years.
He finds watching Sherlock and John interact at crime scenes intriguing, but watching them interact at home gives Greg a whole new perspective. They work in tandem here just as they do at work. John butters a bread stick and passes it over to Sherlock, while Sherlock sprinkles a precise amount of salt and pepper over his bowl as well as John’s. When John stands to rip a paper towel off the roll, and Sherlock opens his mouth as if to request one, John automatically rips off two and hands one over without even having to glance behind him. They are so attentive to each other, and don’t even seem to notice. Did they not realize that their behavior reached well beyond the limits of “best mates” status,  or did they just not care one way or the other? Having watched them interact in the comfort of their home all night, it’s even harder to believe than it was before that they aren’t a couple.
He responds quickly, and she lets out a breath in relief as static ripples through the receiver. “M’fine, Donovan. Make sure the paramedics are ready!” And then he clicks off, offering no further explanation.
When he wakes in the morning, sheets rumpled on both sides of the bed, Sherlock is gone. John tries not to feel disappointed.
With the first indulgent tug of Sherlock’s long fingers buried in his hair, he feels a surge of delightful surrealism which makes him drag Sherlock impossibly closer still, lips searching frantically, hungry.
“Heat,” John requests—demands, really. Not willing to protest, both Sally and Greg wordlessly direct their vents back towards the pair. After a few moments of silence, Sally glances in the rear view mirror and tries to school her expression into indifference. John has his arms around Sherlock, and Sherlock’s head has lolled onto John’s chest, his mouth hanging open in sleep. John alternates, one hand still holding pressure on the gauze, the other trying to rub heat back into Sherlock’s arms and legs. His gaze is distinctly protective as it moves back and forth between the top of Sherlock’s head and outside the window.
He ensconces Sherlock’s face between his hands, suddenly desperate to convey to this man how important, how
“What the hell are you doing?” He isn't annoyed or angry when he says it—he thinks his voice is actually rather intimately quiet in the darkened bedroom.
And just like that, Sherlock explodes with a round of raucous giggling. John doesn’t even pretend to resist, and soon they’re gripping each other and shaking with shared laughter. John can’t help but think it’s exponentially better, to laugh with Sherlock in his arms rather than leaned separately up against the wall of an alleyway. At least here so close to him, he can feel the bright laughter rippling out of Sherlock’s mouth to course right through John’s chest, as if that was where it had belonged all along.
He presses a palm reverently against Sherlock’s cheek, smiling down at him and letting the love shine through in his gaze, even if he’s too cowardly to voice it just yet. He shakes his head. “Silly man. I like you like
ever go his sodding way? John wakes sometime before the sun to a silent flat—all except for the sound of the slow, heavy breaths coming from the man beside him. Warm air tickles John's ear, and he cranes his neck carefully to see Sherlock sprawled over him—head on John's shoulder, arm slung over his chest, and one pajama-clad leg wrapped snugly around both of his. John's own arm is somehow fitted closely over Sherlock's lithe waist, fingers grazing a pale sliver of skin where his shirt has ridden up. Though that isn't what startles him the most in his post-sleep observations.
“Ouch! Um, no, Mrs. H, not that I know of. Had a stack of cold cases that were piling up on my desk, is all. Thought I’d pop in and drop some off for ‘im. Figure he’s probably climbing the walls by now.” He gently pries the kitchen towel from her hand and sets to work on wiping the wetness from his hands and face. Mrs. Hudson tuts as if he’s somehow doing it wrong, but doesn’t protest. “Do you know if they’re in?”
wake the sleeping detective if he raised his voice above a whispered hiss, but in the moment it seems physically impossible. He clenches his teeth down on his bottom lip, and it takes genuine effort to keep himself glued to the bed. Sherlock's hand moves into John's hair at the nape of his neck as if he's done it a million times before, and John feels the gradual change in his breathing as it goes from deep and soft up into a lighter, panting rhythm, and with it the rutting of Sherlock’s hips comes to a slow, until finally it ceases, giving John a moment of blessed relief.
?” he spits the last word, and leans against the doorjamb in a deliberate fashion as to block his way through.
? Well, then maybe you’ll listen to me next time and not run off on your own after a criminal, you twit. And I’ll have you know—” the rest of his rant is cut off as the door slams closed, and Sally watches them walk away, pressed impossibly close together, towards the front door.
The exhaustion of his most recent nightmare suddenly bears down on him again, and he sighs. John settles down in the mattress, staring at Sherlock staring at the ceiling, one arm crooked behind his neck. The dream
“Just what?” Sherlock asks lowly. His mug lands with a dull clunk on the desk as he straightens his posture, and Mycroft sees his hand tremble very, very slightly as it comes away.
Of course Sherlock wouldn't have been sleeping. John is surprised he was able to himself, however restless it had been. He attributes it less to actual tiredness, and more to his own unavoidable adrenaline crash. Now that his body has recovered slightly from the wild hormone spike, he doubts he'll be able to fall back to sleep as quickly as he had earlier in the night.
Sherlock observes him stoically for a moment, as if making a decision, and then huffs exasperatedly in lieu of an actual response. He proceeds to pull back the sheets with a deliberate flare, and then he just—
Sherlock’s eyes are half-closed, and his head seems to tilt loosely forward and backward on his shoulders, like an infant trying to hold its head up. She’s never seen him seeming so...weakened. It’s odd and disconcerting, seeing the overbearing arsehole reduced to this. John pulls back Sherlock’s eyelids, moves the light methodically back and forth over his gaze from a few different angles. He tuts disapprovingly at whatever he finds, but doesn’t seem too overly worried.
Sherlock lowers himself into his chair without a word, soft leather sighing beneath his weight, and once again the world no longer seems to exist to him, as John watches his eyes focus on some random point across the room and stay there. He's sequestered himself away in his mind palace, and John knows from extensive personal experience that his flatmate will be catatonically unresponsive for hours to come, if not for much longer. Because, as John has learned from some careful deduction of his own (take that, you wanker), this is Sherlock's preferred form of escape, second only to the drug-induced obliviousness of his past. This is the way that he handles the situations, rare in occurrence, that are too much for even his superior mind to process with that same unique, lightning-quick clarity to which he’s accustomed.
Again, John simply shakes his head and Sherlock sighs but continues to hold him while he evens his breathing out and tries to gather his wits.
he thinks as he trots down the steps. He emerges at the bottom of the stairs with his head high, unashamed. Even if Sherlock regrets having sex with him, John doesn’t and he won’t pretend he does. Whatever their respective feelings, John is confident they’ll work through it somehow. They always do.
“Like conjoined twins, aren’t they?” Lestrade comments, and there’s a smile on his face like he has a private joke with himself. She shoots him a thoroughly perplexed look, feels her world view tilt as she watches John turn his key in the lock and stumble with his lanky detective through the doorway.
Why?”  Sherlock cocks his head as if actually waiting for a valid reason. Good God, he should’ve just slipped the file under the door and been done with it, Mycroft thinks.
John is breathing a tad faster now, pupils dilating. Sherlock’s own typically light eyes look nearly black themselves as they flicker over his face trying to detect a reaction. He’s still holding John’s hand, and slowly, giving him plenty of time to pull away if he had wanted to, he brings his hand to rest lightly over the erection tenting his pajamas. He presses their linked hands harder against himself, encouraging him. “See?” he says softly, hardening under John’s touch. “It’s all fine.”
John takes a breath, and his posture relaxes. He shakes his head exasperatedly, but it’s obvious he has put the Captain away, his service no longer required for this particular conversation. Mycroft swears that past the residual anger, he can see the reluctant beginnings of a smile on the doctor’s face. “It’s like having mental patients for children with you two twats, I swear. Mycroft, just sit already for God’s sake.”
John startles awake with a sort of undignified half-snore-half-yell, jolting at the sight of the wild haired consulting detective hovering over him, arms outstretched towards him and long fingers clutching firmly to his shoulders. The bedside lamp has been flicked on, and John squints against the assault of dim yellow light. There is an unmistakably troubled expression on Sherlock’s face, made even more panic-inducing by the sallowness cast by the lamp, which makes his face look gaunt and drained of color. He must have been trying to wake him for some time now. John’s heart stutters alarmingly in his chest as the memories of earlier that night begin to flood his mind; Moriarty, the pool, the explosion. He blinks owlishly, trying desperately to rouse himself from the vestiges of sleep. “Sh'lock? What's wrong?”
“It’s perfectly save as long as we avoid touching the rails,” he replies, stepping further into the darkness. In the corner of his eyes, he can see John shrugging at Lestrade before they both jump.
I turn around and see a dog approaching us. It’s very tall, but definitely not a monster. I exhale and start to laugh with relief. There’s no way this harmless dog would’ve been able to kill Mrs. H. All of a sudden, the dog increases its pace and runs towards me. It opens its mouth to let out a loud bark and its eyes sparkle with anger. It has definitely gotten bigger now that I can see it up close. Before it has a chance to run me over, a tall figure pushes me aside and lets the dog run towards him instead. I can only watch as it attacks my friend. It sinks its long fangs into his neck and scratches his arms with its dark claws, going over and over again until the belstaff coat is covered in blood.
“Do you have – “ John starts, then smiles up as Sherlock hands him an aspirin and the glass of water.
“Thanks,” Dr. Watson replies, the confusion still present in his features. The two of them head out, leaving Sherlock with an unknown sensation of having missed an important opportunity. He stays in the lab watching the door, waiting for something to happen, until the coffee Molly brought has gone cold.
It’s a lame excuse for not phoning his friend but going by their current situation he wouldn’t have minded dragging out their encounter even further. John feels guilty at the realisation but having small talk and trying to break the ice with acquaintances is something he never enjoyed attempting.
John laughed and looked up at Sherlock. He was running his hands through his hair, and the silver ring shined bright in contrast to his dark curls. When Sherlock’s eyes met his, he gave him one of his rare bright smiles before glancing at his watch.
“I asked him to meet me here for assistance. He’s a doctor. Don’t give me that look, Lestrade, you know Anderson won’t work with me.”
Even though he thought it physically impossible, it’s even better than the last time, because now there’s nothing holding them back. There are no unspoken words, no guilt, no regret. There is only love, and Sherlock pours it all into the kiss. He tells John with his lips that he missed him so madly, and that he longed to kiss John again the moment their lips parted all those months ago.
“It turned out rather nicely indeed. I just have to make one small addition, and it should be perfect.”
“Er, honey, you know we talked about this, right? Sherlock and I are your parents, but we’re not… like other parents. We’re not –”
“Well, yes of course. I like the dramatic touch of the location, don’t you agree?” He didn’t object to the name, so at least Sherlock knows who he’s dealing with.
Sherlock stares at him, and for a second John believes to see guilt in his features. “It was all under scientific, laboratory conditions. You were never in any danger.”
“You need to be respectful with it,” John says. He takes a step forward and slowly strokes the animal’s nose bridge. “See?”
He remembers how beautiful John looked in his black tuxedo that day, a warm autumn day in early September. How John held his hand in the garden of the beekeeping club; their closest family and friends surrounding them. How he slid the golden wedding band onto his ring finger. How John smiled when their eyes met. How his blue eyes misted when Sherlock played this song. How John kissed him afterwards and how Sherlock wished to be able to live in that moment forever.
Greg Lestrade pulls his coat collar up against the rain, stood half-sheltered under the awning of 221 Baker Street. Holding the stack of pilfered case files safely under his coat, he reaches out to bang the door-knocker again, but before he can, the door swings open and Mrs. Hudson is ushering him inside with a flurry of frenzied admonishments for failing to remember his umbrella. Out of nowhere, she produces a kitchen towel, and uses it to pat dry his dripping hair, muttering about the inevitability of Greg catching cold.
Greg wonders when it became customary to refer to John and Sherlock as a “they”, as if the pair of them were one entity with two different heads or something. A funny picture of the two as conjoined twins pops into Greg’s head and he has to fight hysterical laughter as Mrs. Hudson confirms that yes, they are in fact in their flat, and permits his passage up the stairs. In his head, conjoined John and Sherlock topple in a violently bickering heap to the ground, both having been trying to run in different directions at once. He really has to lay off the caffeine and get more sleep, Greg thinks to himself, shaking his head; he’s turning into a right basket case.
Dr. Watson scoffs disbelievingly, leans back in his chair and crosses one leg over the other as he shakes his head. “Well—yeah, Sherlock, of course.” He looks befuddled. “Of course I think it’s beautiful. It’s amazing. You’re just—”
to do anything which I do not please to be doing. And it isn't uncomfortable for me, John. With someone else, yes, probably. But not with you.” He shrugs nonchalantly, as if he hadn't just made John's heart jump into his throat. He knows this isn't normal, not for them, not for Sherlock. God, but this feels so natural, so utterly right—laying in bed with this man and having whispered conversations late into the night, until they are lulled into sleep by each other’s steady presence. So what if they deviated from their normal routines on these so unusual nights? John had left the prospect of “normalcy” behind already anyway, the moment this insane detective sprung into his life, stole his limp out from under him, and then never gave it the opportunity to sneak its way back in again.
“John,” Sherlock whispers, and John can sense in his tone the confusion, the questions, the deductions dying to voice themselves and take over this perfect moment. But above all else is the yearning and the unfiltered lust present in his breathless baritone. For both of their sake, John decides it can wait.
A few minutes later, as John is taking the bread sticks out of the oven, Sherlock emerges from his bedroom and wordlessly clears off the dining table, carting microscopes and notebooks and other various things back into his room without comment. Neither of them exchange a word or even a look, but when Sherlock comes back into the kitchen, John hands him a cloth and a bottle of spray cleaner. Sherlock dutifully wipes down the table while John makes up their dishes, and soon they’re all sat in their respective seats and tucking in. Greg notices that John and Sherlock have sat directly next to each other, even though there is plenty more room to spread out at the sizable table. Greg has taken his seat on the other side of the table, directly across from them. The food is even more delicious than it smells, and he has to restrain himself from literally moaning at the taste of his first home-cooked meal in over six months. (Needless to say, he ends up having more than just the one bowl).
