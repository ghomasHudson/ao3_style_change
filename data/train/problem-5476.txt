Tony studied him intently, like he was looking for something, and then he shoved his hands in his pockets and smiled, a small, wistful kind of smile.  “You’re not afraid of anything, are you.”
“Of course I can hear you,” Steve said, grabbing a towel and scrubbing his hair with it.  “You’re a figment of my imagination.”
Heading out of the apartment, she pauses and looks back, noticing approvingly that he hasn't moved from his frozen position. "Think about it," she says.
“You heard him,” Sitwell says, and Steve looks from the car to Sitwell and back again.  Sitwell tightens his grip on his pistol.  “In.”
“You know, this might surprise you,” Steve says, leaning in close to Tony, “but I actually kind of like hanging out with you.”
“Peter once went out with a girl whose dad was trying to kill him.  Like, unrelatedly, though.  Long story.”
"It's so interesting, Tony," Killian says.  "For someone who doesn't get his hands dirty himself, you sure never have worried about putting others in harm's way.  Boys?"
“No, Steve, I told you I’m in love with you because Thor dared me to,” Tony said, throwing up his arms.  “Jesus.  Of course I meant it.  I should have said it a long time ago but I blew it then and I blew it now and so it’s officially fully blown, can we get back to baseball?  I don’t actually care if we win or lose, either way I have an excuse to spend the evening with a bottle of scotch but we have to finish before I can get to that part, so can we pick up the pace a little?  Great, thanks.”
“Oh,” Bruce said.  “Uh.  I’m thankful I’m no longer technically an internationally wanted criminal.  I’m thankful Tony invented clothes that stretch and shrink with the other guy.  Oh, and I’m glad they decided not to put the Hulk balloon in the parade after all.”
Pennsylvania’s quiet - still quiet, even with the other half the world back in the picture.  Pepper doesn’t want Morgan to grow up in the city.  It just wasn’t the life they’d pictured for themselves, when they’d shut down most of the company and moved away.
There is a long silence.  Banner clears his throat.  "You know what?  I agree with you, in principle.  So here's a question.  Have you considered the possibility that
“I noticed,” Steve says, and gasps as Stark pinches his nipple through his shirt.  “You haven’t exactly been -
"Just a little accident," Natasha calls out soothingly.  She steps in front of Steve and meets his eyes.  "I need you to pull it together.  The optics of this are already pretty bad.  Do you want to make it worse?"
Steve shuts him up, backs him up against the wall and pushes his jacket off his shoulders, rips the buttons off his shirt in his rush to get it off.
.  And all these people who are mad at me about it, about that and everything else I’ve ever done - Beck, and Jameson, and all of them?  I don’t blame them.”
“So you’ll take what you can get,” Tony said.  “Man.  You used to hang out with actual gods.  Aliens.  You know a talking raccoon!  Bob from accounting has gotta pale in comparison.”
Everyone else waits patiently while Tony and Fury stare each other down from opposite ends of the table.
“Don’t keep saying they needed you, Tony,” she says.  He hears the quiet sound of a drawer opening and closing.
of you move, he’s dead.  Be a shame for one of my agents to get caught on the wrong side of a bust, but the bureau can weather the storm.  I won’t hesitate.”
“I think we can agree that by all accounts Tony Stark is profiting from the misery and suffering of the American people,” Beck says.  “And we know that he’s managed to collect a group of people who are powerful, and often dangerous.  The world is a chaotic place, and the Avengers are fully funded by a man who is making money off that chaos.”
“I mean I think you got the wrong kid,” Steve said.  “You should be out looking for - for the real kid.  You don’t have to worry about me - I can take care of myself.”
“You’re right, you’re right,” Tony said, sliding into the elevator with Steve hot on his heels.  “Hey, pipsqueak, what did I say, don’t follow me.”
“There he is,” Tony said.  “Old Man Cap.  You walked uphill both ways in the snow to school too, right?”
“That would be pretty nice,” Tony agreed.  “I’d like to get my hands on you.  All over you.  God, I’ve thought about touching every part of you.  All that muscle, strung tight, so tense, just for me.”
“No, I usually have to come twice to take the edge off,” Steve said, and winced.  “I’ve never told anyone that before.  Not even the doctors at SHIELD.”
“Man, the 40s must have been boring for you to consider this ‘company.’  I’m serious, I don’t need to be coddled just because I just got divorced.”
“Believe me, I don’t want to be here,” Tony says.  Around them, Jameson’s lackeys are setting up equipment all over the penthouse, bright stage lights and multiple camera angles; J. Jonah himself is across the room having his face powdered.  “But it’s my house, so, you know.”
“Oh, Cap, I saw an autotuned version of your interview with J. Jonah Jameson,” Scott says on speakerphone from San Francisco.  “It was hilarious, I’ll send it to the grouptext.”
“Rogers!”  Odinson careens out of the crowd and throws an arm around Steve’s shoulders.  “Hell of a party, isn’t it?”
Outside the window, the Bronx rolls by; Steve tries, without much success, to determine exactly how much trouble he’s in.  Finally, Pierce says, “You ever think about balance, son?”
“Enough that even you’d be welcome, Mr. Stark,” Coulson says, and Tony snorts.  “We’d like to ask all of you to maintain your discretion about Pierce and the other agents who were involved in last week’s incident.  In exchange, we’ll agree to look the other way about any low-level illegal activity going on in the building, and we hope that we can look forward to a further partnership with all of you.”
The Santa Claus stared at him blankly.  Presumably standard Mall Santa training did not cover what to do if a national icon asked to sit on your lap.
Peter asks, once, when they’re in the workshop, and Tony’s teaching him how to reprogram Karen because really, he should have taught the kid this a long time ago, and they’re both looking at the screen - well, Peter’s looking at the screen but Tony’s looking at Peter, because he always wants to have his eyes on Peter these days - when Peter says, apropos of nothing, “It was pretty bad around here, wasn’t it?”
“I see that,” Steve said.  He busied himself in the fridge, which Tony was almost sure he was doing just to avoid looking at him, which honestly was fair.  Tony was gonna let him do that, and then, like an adult, he was going to gently, carefully edge around the topic of Them, and then hopefully it would all be resolved immediately and no one would ever have to speak about it again and Tony could crawl back into bed until Christmas.
Steve watches the kids play for a while.  Across the playground, Morgan pops out of a slide with a shriek.  “It’d be messy,” he says finally.  “Keeping my head down.  Or creating a new timeline, more likely.  I’d have to be pretty desperate.”
“Anything you want in particular?” he murmured, backing them toward the bed and pulling Steve’s shirt off at the same time, because efficiency.  “And since I know you’re gonna tell me, this is an opportunity to learn and I am going to be the world’s best student - ”
Tony leads them to a bedroom and spends a good thirty seconds figuring out Steve's belt, and Steve's settling in for what promises to be an enthusiastic if somewhat sloppy blow job when Tony holds up one finger, runs into the bathroom, and locks the door behind him.
“The team is - look, I’m grateful for it, real grateful, but we both know this isn’t sustainable,” Steve says.  “We’re not - we’re not
He wants more than a call, actually.  He wants Steve to be here right now.  Even though there’s nothing Steve could do, really, except just stand next to him, wrap an arm around him, maybe, if things are like that with them, not that Tony’s entirely sure they are. He wants it so bad, and that makes him angry, makes him
Steve smiled, and Tony tried not to swoon.  “I think it’s pretty obvious, Tony.  Hey, I’m going to grab a drink, do you - ”
Bruce slams a hand down on the table, and it crumples under his fist.  His arm is throbbing, shot through with streaks of green, and when he looks up at Steve he's baring his teeth.
Peter sighs but pops it out and hands it over, and Tony decides to give him a Maserati for his upcoming birthday.
Tony shoves his hands in his pockets as Steve steps up next to him.  “Yeah, he is.  He’s a great kid, actually.”
“I was actually thinking about how I’d prefer not to perjure myself in a court of law, if it ever came to that,” Rogers says, and throws back his moonshine.  “Criminy, Miss Romanov.  This is strong stuff.”
There’s nothing else to say about that, so they don’t try.  Tony glances at Steve and then away, back to the skyline.  The silence should be awkward, but it’s - not, actually, and on the bench, the back of Steve’s hand brushes his; his little finger rests on top of Tony’s, not pinning it, just resting there.  Tony waits for him to murmur an apology, move away, and when he doesn’t, Tony realizes he’s holding his breath.
“I really didn’t think I was that hard to read,” Steve says with a wry half-smile.  “I know what I’m getting into, Tony, and I think you do too.  If we’re making a mistake, we’re making it with our eyes wide open.”
“Science, mostly,” Tony said.  “Pushing the limits of what we know about time and space.  Oh, I went to Peter’s wedding a couple months ago.  He didn’t know I was there, of course.  Happy cried the entire time.”
“Well, alongside all the freedom-loving, god-fearing Americans you brought back, you brought back some pretty bad people, too,” Jameson says.
“You’re looking for Emil Blonsky,” Stark says abruptly.  “You’re trying to use Banner to get to him.”
“Oh, come on,” he says, sliding a hand around her waist.  “A pretty little thing like you shouldn’t be alone on a nice night like this.”
It’s chaos in the joint: seasoned patrons run for the hidden back exit, Thor urging shocked-looking ladies and too-drunk gents along with the crowd; Clint dives over the bar and grabs the sawed-off shotgun they hide behind the whiskey, and Natasha runs to bar the front door with the heavy oak table they keep nearby for just this purpose.
Take Banner.  A few days ago he showed up looking for a place to stay that didn’t ask too many questions, and now he’s tucked in a corner with Tony Stark, heads bent over a piece of paper covered in scribbles that might as well be in Greek as far as Natasha can tell.  She wonders what Stark’s talking him into.  He can be quite persuasive, when he wants to be.
Tony choked on a chip.  Coulson, to his credit, didn’t even blink.  “I don’t get involved with coworkers.  Even when they’re of age.”
“He stops by sometimes and asks if you’re home.  Says he’s on his way to Miss Maximoff’s quarters or the gym, usually, but sometimes he leaves if you’re not here.”
“ - not fair, that’s cheating,” Steve was saying when he emerged, and Tony was so busy thinking about force and angle of attack that he didn’t realize anyone else was around until Clint’s voice rang out, clear as a bell, “So this all seems normal.”
But he hears it now.  “I think I’d better get going in the morning,” he says, and the hand threading through his hair falters for a second and then resumes its steady rhythm.
“Wait,” Steve says, a catch of uncertainty in his voice that he wasn’t expecting.  “You just - that’s it?”
“I’ll buy you a new one,” Stark says, starting on his buttons as the jacket falls to the fall.  “I’ll buy you ten new ones, god, I’ve wanted to get my hands on you since the first time we met - ”
“Like a log.”  He looks away as Nicola drops the towel and slips into her dress from the night before.  “No need to walk me out or anything, I can find my way.  I’m used to it.”
“Tell me about it,” Barnes says, and they settle into silence, punctuated only by the beeping of Steve’s heart monitor in the room.
going to get tired of that mouth,” Tony breathed, and then Steve’s thrusts went erratic and he came in hot spurts over Tony’s hand and stomach, and that was pretty much that as far as Tony was concerned; his vision went black around the edges as he fell over the edge, Steve’s groans still in his ear.
“The day you left,” Tony says.  “It was a normal day, right?  Except you decided to leave.  Any interest in sharing with the class?”
Tony’s eyes widened - until he realized Steve was holding back a smirk.  “That was a lie, wasn’t it.”
“I’m sure,” Rogers says dryly, and Natasha allows herself a smirk.  “Having a good night, Dr. Banner?”
“Yeah, I think I can probably accommodate that,” Tony said.  He pulled Steve up onto the bed and went about relieving them of all the rest of the clothes that hadn’t yet been discarded, ran his hands up Steve’s ribs and his pecs and his shoulders, looked at all the parts of Steve that he’d stared at many times before but always tried to pretend he wasn’t.  He pushed Steve down on the bed and kissed him, wet and sloppy, and then licked a path down to Steve’s chest, swirled his tongue around first one nipple and then the other.
"Yeah, I know."  Banner takes his spectacles off, rubs the bridge of his nose.  "Who do you think helped Blonsky with his research after the Army cut him off?  I thought - I thought I was helping.  I thought, maybe if they could control those boys - "
“You don’t have to stick around,” Tony says after Morgan runs off to take possession of the jungle gym, as is her due.  “Seriously, no offense, but she won’t even notice if you leave.”
When Natasha whirls around, her bar is almost empty, except for - “Stark, what the hell are you doing?  Get out of here!”
“We have a team working on an analysis, but no.  Not yet.  Not that it’s anything to worry about,” he added, just in case Bruce started to go a little green.
Tony steps onto the sidewalk and texts Happy.  He wants - well, he wants a lot of things, but right now what he wants is to get in his car and drive.  He’s not sure where, yet, but things seem a little clearer than they did before - not wide open, not brand new, but a little brighter, at least.
“So how do you afford this place?” Tony said.  “Wineries are notoriously unprofitable, and I know whatever SHIELD was paying you before it went belly up couldn’t have covered it.”
“Hang on a minute,” Banner says.  “I never said I was interested, I said you were crazy for even thinking about it.”
, Tony thinks.  He always thought his marriage - when he’d imagined having one, which he mostly didn’t - would fall apart because of something dramatic, something spectacular, something
“You heard it here first, folks,” Clint said.  “Captain America officially endorses not doing your chores.  Children of the world rejoice.”
, that voice and those eyes and that smile, and Tony hasn’t earned any of it so he gets to work trying to.  Tony tends to keep his eyes open during sex, he’s a visual guy, he likes to watch, and he doesn’t think there’s anything in the world right now that would make him close his eyes to Steve, sweat gathering at his temple, head thrown back, biting his lip to stay quiet, and Steve is the most controlled person Tony has ever known and god, all Tony wants is make him
“You have Hulk breath,” Tony said noncommittally.  “You only brush your teeth in your own bathroom, right?”
It didn’t surprise Tony, because he was old as fuck and knew better, but he was already drunk enough to forget that lesson and anyway it was worth a shot.  A big shot, first of the scotch he kept behind the spare soldering irons, and then, once Clint’s yelling over the comm systems became so loud they couldn’t avoid it, with a bottle of wine that Clint opened because it was “a good year” and it “went great with yams”.  Which,
Natasha shoved the plate in the microwave and picked up her wine glass.  “Or sell mini arc reactors at Best Buy.”
Natasha smiles bracingly at the boys - her boys - and nods, just once, at Clint.  “That sounds all right to me, Director,” she says, and stands up.
“I’m sure it will be,” Stark says.  “You think Banner can be convinced to help out?  I’ll invite him to dinner.”
Steve shrugged modestly, as if throwing a two-ton car was no big thang.  “Still.  It’s pretty windy out there.  And the balloons are much bigger than they were before, so - anyway, I just came to see what you were up to.  Upstairs is, uh.  Crowded.”
“Oh, no, I mean, of course we could,” Scott says quickly.  “You could handle it alone, probably, who needs me, I’m backup at best, but like, these are the Avengers.”
Steve pressed his lips together.  Considering it was coming from his subconscious, this line of questioning wasn’t exactly a surprise, but it
There was the pause of a man who had been dealing with Tony Stark’s shit for more than 30 years and was perhaps about to decide that his shift had been long enough.  “Excuse me?”
Steve hesitates for a moment at the door.  The room’s dark, and he has no idea what could be in there; more than that, he has no idea if he really wants to be alone in a dark, locked room with Tony Stark.  He doesn’t trust the man, and - even worse - he doesn’t trust himself.
, he chides himself, not Stark - how’d that go and happen?  And anyway, it’s not so much that Tony is still there; this is Tony’s bed, after all.  It’s that
"Suit yourself," Stark says, and waves at Odinson for another drink.  "So, you still trying to get something out of Banner?"
He watches the guy in the helmet and the cape swoop and dive, his actions smooth and calculated.  He looks like somebody who’s used to flying, used to fighting, and Tony wonders where he came from.  Between Fury and Strange, wasn’t somebody supposed to be keeping track of all potential extraordinary types?  It’s not like new superheroes hadn’t come out of the woodwork over the years, but -
It was kind of hard to follow - they all used slightly different slang, and wouldn’t stop talking over each other, and anyway Tony was only on his first cup of coffee so his comprehension skills hovered around 20% at best - but eventually he heard Steve snap, “Shut
“I’m probably teaching you all to fight,” Thor said smugly.  “Your weaponry on this planet is extremely basic.  You’re in desperate need of my expertise.”
“Way ahead of you,” Stark says, climbing into the driver’s seat.  Natasha throws the bags into the back and crawls into the front seat next to Thor.
“Hey, now, fellas,” Steve says, bracing himself, “I’ve got no beef with you, so why don’t we just - ”
The rest of the Avengers turned to look at Tony like they were at Wimbledon and it was, very obviously, his move.
"I feel like I've been pretty clear that I'm not interested in talking about this with you," Steve says.
A lot of stories start with "a man walks into a bar", but these days a lot of stories that start that way end pretty badly.
“I mean, you thought I’d believe adults sit on Santa’s lap,” Steve said with a smirk.  “Anything is possible.”
“No,” Steve says.  “First of all, we don’t even know what would have happened if we’d tried to take everybody back five years to the moment of the Snap.  Maybe it wouldn’t have worked.  Maybe we would have made things worse.  And even if it had worked, that’s a big decision to make for half the universe, wiping away five years of their lives.”
“Yup.”  Morgan barely glanced up as her dad appeared holographically next to her at the dining room table from 150 miles away.  Kids these days, honestly.
"Let's get a hotel room," Tony said, like that was that, and somehow - and Steve never could explain how, not then and not now and not later - it was.
- and it takes him a second to realize that they’ve surrounded him.  That’s why the sun’s been blocked out; the drones aren’t just in the sky anymore, they’re around
!” Clint snaps, and Stark puts his foot on the gas so hard that they all slam back into the leather seats.
“You don’t know how your best friend’s criminal past is relevant?” Jameson says skeptically.  “Here’s a question, Captain: did you know that there is legislation being introduced to have James Barnes - who if I’m remembering correctly you fought to have posthumously pardoned for the crimes he committed while working as an assassin for HYDRA - brought to trial?”
"Rogers?" Thor says, pulling out a match and striking it on the bar.  His arms gleam with sweat and ropy muscles; Natasha allows herself a very blatant moment of appreciation.  "We get plenty of that sort in here, the lawman turning his nose up at the law, but he seems..."
They set up in Bruce's lab, with Natasha on standby in case they need to talk the Hulk down and everybody else behind the glass to observe.  Steve's got his shield on his back, just in case.
“Shut up,” Steve sighed, but the worst part of it was that Tony was his subconscious, and that meant he already knew that Tony was right.  “It was my fault.  I didn’t - I don’t have any friends, I don’t care about my job, I don’t - all I have is her.  And that’s too much to put on any one person.  I should never have put her in this position.”
“We don’t fight, kiddo,” Tony says, holding his arms open.  She runs into them and buries her face in his chest, right where the arc reactor used to be.  “We never fight.”
Tony scans back through the evening and winces.  “Did I really throw my dad’s ‘thanks for helping us end World War II’ present from President Eisenhower off the landing pad?”
“I wouldn’t fight back too hard,” Pierce says.  “These boys work for some of those friends of mine I was mentioning, and some of them have spent some time in the lab, if you know what I mean.  Not to mention, they don’t have any of the same rules dictating their conduct that we’ve got at the bureau.”  He smiles at Steve, and it makes Steve’s stomach curdle.  “Just a little helpful advice.  Take him, Sitwell.”
“Um, maybe?  I might skip the reminder about how you used to hate each other, but other than that - ”
While this did have the intended effect of getting the team out of their rooms, it also had the unfortunate byproduct of creating a scuffle at the table as each of them tried their damndest
Steve shrugs.  “Lot of things bother me.  I try not to waste too much time on the ones I can’t do anything about.”
nothing.  Steve walked away from the ship.  The landscape, if you could call it that, felt like it went on too long.  It was the horizon, Steve realized, or rather the lack thereof.  Whatever he was on, it wasn’t a sphere; with eyes like his, he could see in every direction for - well, longer than a person was supposed to.
Steve didn’t say anything.  He shifted, his waistband pulled tight around the swollen head of his cock.
“You don’t get a vote because wine doesn’t get you drunk,” Tony said, poking a finger into Steve’s chest.
“It wasn’t about anybody,” Steve says irritably.  “I was supposed to be trying to make him angry.  I was saying the worst things I could think to say about - ”
“It maybe freaked me out the absolute tiniest bit,” Tony admitted.  “But what freaked me out more was that I might have messed up and missed a step somewhere.  I don’t want to miss anything with you.  I’m kinda trying to get it right.”
“A therapist once called it an irresistible draw to self-destructive tendencies,” Tony says.  “I fired her immediately, obviously - I didn’t call you because that’s who I
And sees Natasha Romanov, on her back, stretched out over the length of a lacquered black baby grand, her red silk dress rucked up over her hips, Bruce Banner's dark and curly head between her thighs. He has one dark, tanned hand braced against the piano, the other wrapped around her creamy thigh, and he’s pulling her close against his mouth as she moans and bucks in pleasure, yanking his hair and guiding his motions. Her eyes are wide open, and as Steve freezes in horror, they lock onto his. Her expressions of pleasure don’t change.  Her blue gaze burns. Then, she winks.
Tony wipes his feet on the mat at the front door.  He hadn’t noticed much about Strange’s weird, dusty brownstone last time he’d visited, what with Bruce back and Thanos on the way and the world about to, you know, end.  He’s about to comment on how weird it must be to live in the lobby of a haunted hotel from the 1920’s when he’s hit with what feels like a very strong but very localized tornado.
“Hey, guys?” Scott says, poking his head around the corner.  “Uh, just so you know, you’re being kind of loud.”
“Oh my god, you guys bought weed at the mall,” Tony said.  “You are truly living the suburban American teenage experience.”
“I mean with you,” Peter says.  “Are you ever going to talk to me about things?  Are you ever going to trust me?”
“I’m gonna fucking kill you,” he growls, lifting the gun in a shaking hand, and Natasha’s weighing her options when the man’s face goes slack and he falls forward like a sack of potatoes.
Here’s how it happened: there was a call to assemble, and there was a guy doing magic, and there was an explosion.  So, you know, typical.
Tony steps out of the armor in the garage and dawdles, notes the repairs he’ll have to do, tinkers with the chest plate for a while.  Eventually exhaustion wins out and he walks in through the back door.  Morgan’s listening to music in the living room, and he pauses on the steps for a minute, listens as she sings all the wrong words.  He smells coffee from the kitchen and considers it, but crawls into bed instead, Morgand’s clear voice carrying from the floor below.
“Did you feel me?” Tony said.  “You were - it looked a shitty dream, so I was trying to wake you up, I was shaking you and everything, and finally you -  ”
He gestures to a dusty armchair.  Tony sits down and wonders, distantly, how long its been since it was reupholstered.
Bruce clapped a hand on Tony’s shoulder.  “I’d love to stay for moral support, but I absolutely do not want to.”
"Oh," Tony says.  "Nothing.  Might go check on one of the plants tomorrow, but Pepper mostly manages things on this side of the country."
“At any rate,” Steve says, pulling on his jacket.  “Well.  Thanks for - for a fun night.  The party, I mean.  It was great.”
hope he picks something noisy enough to draw attention, rather than just waiting for the smell to be his death notice.
“If I wanted to see you dead I would have done a lot of things differently the past few days,” Steve said, snatching the bottle from Clint’s hands.
Steve opens the sixth door in the second floor hallway. All he’s trying to do is find some towels for the girls down by the pool, and so far he’s interrupted three menage a troises (is that how you said the plural of menage a trois? Steve’s never even seen one before tonight, and now he’s having to remember French pluralization rules), one encounter between two men that looked.... urgent, and a tuxedo'd man throwing up into a writing desk. It’s been an eventful search. He opens the sixth door.
From the first floor, there’s a smattering of gunshots.  Steve takes another out man at the knees.  “Get out of here, Stark,” he grits out, holding firmly on the back of the goon’s neck; he writhes and scrabbles at Steve’s hands, but Steve holds him tight.  “Find Miss Romanov and
“Hi,” Tony said, waving to some guy who was probably live-tweeting their enormously suspicious conversation.  “Just a little charity shopping trip.  Are you interested in making a donation?”
still sticking your nose into things that aren't your business?" Steve says coolly, taking a sip of his drink just for something to do.
"You served in the science division during the war," Steve says.  "You were involved in weapons testing."
“How can you not do Thanksgiving?” Clint said, still looking aghast, and not, as far as Tony could tell, about the baster.  “This is - we -
“It’s actually on Long Island,” Steve said from the front of the jet.  “You sure you’re okay with this, Clint?  If anybody notices us…”
had to play against the Hulk, who hit a lot of home runs but also created a lot of work for the bat boy, or Natasha, who was so good at stealing second that there was ongoing debate about whether she should be officially included on the "powered" list.
Because why the fuck not. It’s private, and it’s even emptier than the rest of the world, thanks to a series of oil refinery fires that have darkened the horizon and emptied out the estuary and totally fucked the local micro-economy of oyster bars. It’s difficult to get to these days from the nearest commercial airport, requiring a drive of over four hours of stop-and-go traffic through ghost towns. Or a QuinJet.
“You’re kind of a wild card,” Tony said.  “Maybe next you’ll start crying over an entire box of pizza rolls.”
As Tony knew well from the battlefield, Steve was a quick learner: he gathered data, formed strategic insights, and applied his learnings.  Steve was
Tony, whose mouth and brain had apparently shaken hands and went their separate ways a while ago, said, “You know when I said the thing about liking you, I think it’s possible people took that the wrong way.”
He always ignored the voice, because he didn’t need to have run a support group in 2022 to know that hearing voices wasn’t a great sign, but sometimes - well, sometimes, he'd swear he saw a little bit of Tony out of the corner of his eye.  Not like a ghost, or anything - Steve knew magic was real and aliens were out there, but he didn’t believe in
Steve shrugs, stuffs another bite of taco in his mouth.  “That fight back there felt like the kind of thing I used to get into growing up.  Except I won.”
: he grins when Tony runs his hands up Steve’s abs, he chuckles when Tony sucks a bruise into the spot where his jaw meets his throat, he gasps with wide-eyed pleasure when Tony finally gets a hand down his pants.  Tony’s seen Steve a lot of ways but never like this, and Tony wants to savor every second because people don’t tend to be this blissfully happy in Tony’s presence for long.
Steve throws back the rest of his drink and slams the glass down.  "Thanks again for the hand back there."
Tony used to work all the time because he didn’t have anything better to do, except party and sleep with supermodels and jetset around the world and whatever.  Now, he has a lot of better things to do, like hang out with his kid and help Peter with his physics homework and tool around with his ragtag band of crime-stopping hooligans, but he works all the time anyway, because he is, in the words of the Washington Post, America’s #1 Job Creator.
,” Tony said, and sat down heavily on the edge of his bed.  “Come on, you gotta warn a guy before you do something like that.  I have a bad heart, that kind of move could
“Nothing,” Steve said, which was a lie.  He lifted the lid from the nearest jar and grabbed a handful of cookies.
“Well, I wish we could answer that, but we can’t,” Steve says.  “But he existed, and now he’s dead, and the whole universe is a better place for it.”
They stared at each other.  Tony got the feeling Steve wasn’t understanding the magnitude of the situation.
“Hey, come on, don’t get your tightey whiteys in a twist,” Clint said.  “There’s nothing wrong with liking dudes, and the way he looks at you, I think he probably has a crush on adult you, too.”
Steve set his fork down.  “Well, I guess I’d have to say I’m most thankful that New York is still here.”
“Yeah,” Tony said mindlessly, angling his hips to meet him and scrabbling at the bedside table for lube.  “Let me - there we go.”
“Oh, no, I’m pretty sure I’m stuck with you guys,” Peter says.  “It’s just - well, it’s not always easy, right?  Being this, but also - normal.”
Clint pulls the slip partly up as he kneels on the floor behind her, one hand now loosely tangled in hers, the restraint a matter of trust rather than force. He runs his fingers up the inside of her left thigh, making an appreciative noise when he gets to the top of the fawn silk stockings and encounters nothing but creamy white skin, framed by chocolate brown garters. His fingers just brush over her wet, red curls, then keep going down the inside of her right thigh, ending at her ankle, which he wraps warmly in his hand.
“Well, Jonah, I‘m not the only one thinking it,” Beck says.  “In fact, I’m announcing exclusively, just for your viewers, that the Department of Justice is about to announce that they have opened up an investigation into Tony Stark’s involvement in the Blip.  And frankly, Jonah, I think a lot of people are going to be very surprised by what they find.”
The muscle looks him up and down, and Steve looks at him right back.  "Welcome to the Black Widow," the man says finally, and steps back into the shadows.
“Right,” Steve said.  “Totally reasonable.  It’s been a good run, anyway, no need to, uh, mess things up - ”
“I’ll take that as a yes,” Stark says.  “All right, get back to work, my taxes aren’t paying for you to stand around and talk on the telephone!”
Except, of course, for the mid-afternoon delivery of a dark blue Maserati with red and white interior.  It even had a bow on top.
Miss Romanov doesn’t speak as they walk to the subway, and she waits until the near-empty car is clanging down the track before she leans in and murmurs, “I think they trusted you.”
Barton and Odinson supervise the men's speedy exit - Odinson throws Banner's opponent over his shoulder, hauls him up the stairs, and drops him at the door without ceremony - and Romanov pours a round of top shelf whiskey as Banner eases Steve's suit jacket off him and inspects his wound.
“It’s not just about food!” Clint said, pointing at him with the baster.  “It’s about - it’s about the whole - everything!  Pilgrims!  Football!  We live with
“And you’re a good little government flunky who doesn’t hang around with war profiteers,” Tony says.
"That's actually why I'm here," Steve says.  "Word on the street is your loyalties have... shifted."
There was a beat of silence, and then Peggy laughed, and Steve realized that was his cue: he laughed too.  He figured that Bob and Shirley
“Maybe I just don’t want to get killed trying to do the impossible,” Steve says, and his voice echoes through the bar.  He looks around at each of them, taking in confusion, their anger, their disappointment, and steels himself, because he knows what he has to do.  “Think about what I said, all right?  It’s been nice knowing you all.  Best of luck out there.”
"At the door," the bartender says, nodding toward the muscle.  "Sees everything.  Doesn't talk much, until you get to know him - then he never shuts up."
“Interesting,” Pierce says.  “Because the records department let me know this morning that you recently took out
Natasha smiles up at him. "I think I can do that." As the song ends, she pulls him off the dance floor, leading him first to the gigantic crystal punch bowl, where she spoons out two glasses of liquid the pale pink of a peony. "Let's drink these somewhere less crowded," she says, and pulls him by the hand to the staircase. "What's wrong with the first floor?" Bruce asks when she passes it without even slowing down.
“I can imagine,” Bruce says.  “Have you considered talking to him about it?  I mean, I’m no relationship expert, but - ”
“Try me,” Steve snaps, and heads down the hallway.  “There should be another door at this end, if we could just - ”
“Thanks for coming,” Steve says, and Tony looks around as Cap lowers himself into the next seat over.
“Ugh, don’t say that in front of her,” Tony says.  “It’ll send her ego through the roof and she’s already genetically predisposed to that so we have to watch it - the other day I caught Happy telling her she’d make a good CEO just like her mom.  Which by the way, excuse me, I was also a good CEO.”
“It was a little cavernous for just the three of us,” Stark says.  “Well, four if you count Jarvis, which I do.  And the maids, of course.  Plus the governess, well, for as long as they lasted, and the drivers, and the stable boys, and - ”
The tactic works--he tightens his grip on her threefold, slamming into her violently now. "Were--you--now," he says, his voice rough.
Scott and Hope come to New York for a visit the next weekend and it’s as good a reason as any to get everybody together.  Wanda cooks something that smells vaguely eastern european, and Peter makes a playlist that the rest of them hate, and Happy buys way too much beer, so, you know.  It’s pretty standard.
“Not sure what you expected,” Sam says.  “Did you think you could convince him not to be a bigoted, conspiracy theory-believing asshole by
“Yeah, Stark, what’s got you all riled up?” Clint said.  “You should chill out.  Like, really chill.  You know.  Just go with the flow.  The flowwww.”
“I was literally a wanted criminal for several years,” Steve said.  “The bar is apparently not that high.”
“I didn’t say that’s what I wanted,” Steve interrupts.  “I said I’d take that if that’s all you want to give.”
He goes directly to the landing pad, plugs in the coordinates and doesn’t look up from his holopad during takeoff.  Pepper texts him twice while he’s over the Atlantic, and he forgets to respond.
“Weapons, mostly,” Stark says.  “Some chemical stuff.  No hooch that we could see, so your business should be safe enough for now, Miss Romanov.”
“That’s pretty bold coming from a guy in a cape,” Tony says.  “You got cocky, Beck.  Going on Jameson’s show was too obvious, it led me right to you.”
“Nothing about you has ever been normal,” Steve said, opening the fridge and waiting for Tony’s retort, but when he turned back around Tony was gone.
The data from Fury is interesting, and the videos from Twitter and surveillance footage from every angle fill in a lot of gaps; before long he’s reconstructed the entire scene in miniature and is walking through the action in slow motion, almost every detail perfectly rendered in holographic 3D.
“All right, who wants to hear Baby Got Back?” Clint yelled.  “Just kidding, one vote is enough, let’s do this!”
"Heard you the first time, Cap," Stark says, standing superfluously at Banner's shoulder as he cleans the wound with moonshine.  "You get stabbed often?"
“Good luck with that, I won’t be able to get rid of these people til dawn,” Stark says.  He grabs two glasses of champagne from a passing waiter and presses one against Steve’s chest.  “I wasn’t sure you’d make it.”
But there was food in the fridge and his ma had taught him you could make a casserole out of anything, so he pulled out everything that hadn’t already expired and decided to test her wisdom.
.  “Your commentary isn’t helping,” he says, jumping out of the way of a Colt .45 and knocking the gun away with a roundhouse kick.
They stand side by side, watching Peter give the official statement.  Someone coming out of a nearby Starbucks takes a picture of them.  A taxi honks at a pedestrian staring at a tentacle-induced hole in the road.  New York keeps moving.
“And I really shouldn’t be talking to a figment of my imagination,” Steve said.  “Sam would be reading me the riot act.  I can hear him now.
Natasha inspects her nails.  The last man in the room takes a step closer and rests his hand on the arm of her chair.  “You know,” he says, looking down at her with a smile, “if you’re looking for help, I might be able to be of some assistance.  That is, assuming you’re amenable to - ”
The man who’s suddenly leaning in too close smells of whiskey and cheap cologne.  “I’m all right, thank you.”
"So here's a question," Clint called from shortstop.  "Which one of you is pitching and which one of you is catching?"
They started on the first floor and worked their way up.  Steve stared at everything in awe and kept getting distracted by escalators; Bruce seemed hyper-aware of the way the crowd parted for them (well, for Tony) and tried to disappear into his too-large jacket; and Clint, bless his soul, was the only one brave enough to accompany Tony into Victoria’s Secret.  Tony was going to buy the kid a Lambo when he got old again.
“Good, good,” Pierce says.  “Now, I have a question for you, and I need you to think very carefully before you answer me.  What do you know about Aldrich Killian?”
“That’s - okay, wow, not fair, I can’t do that,” Tony muttered, heading back into the dining room to take the stairs down to the ground level like a normal person.  “You know, Cap,” he called as he jogged out the door toward the pool, “you are a really annoying drunk, you can’t just run away in the middle of a conver -
hiding, thank you very much) in the workshop later that night when Friday murmured, “You have a visitor, boss.”
“ - and Cap found out, and I think he was upset, but now he’s not anymore, and honestly, Bruce, it’s complicated.”
"On your left, Rogers," Banner calls out, and Steve looks up just in time to see the fourth bodyguard approaching him with a switchblade.
“Well, I think it’s important to really dig into what motivates people,” says the man across from him, a dark-haired guy with a chyron along the bottom pops up that identifies him as Quentin Beck, former Stark Industries employee.  “And that means getting past the obvious and really asking ourselves - who
Peter has only had the one beer, but everyone else, as far as Tony can tell, has had significantly more.  Or at least, Tony has, so he has to assume everyone else has too.  It’s a party, after all!  Or, well, it’s a party
“Of course I care,” Steve said.  “I’d change all kinds of things.  I’d start with rooting HYDRA out of the SSR.  I’d tell Peggy to get our defenses up and pointed toward the stars, stop Loki in his tracks.  I’d get Bucky out of the Soviet Union and stop him from killing your parents - I’d change
of data points, and a lot of experience analyzing that data, to generally very positive effect.  And Tony was an engineer.  He believed in data.
“That may be true,” Steve says, “but making the decision not to do so would be unconstitutional and wrong.  Who are any of us to be the sole arbiters of justice?  It would have made us no better than murderers.”
If Steve thought he missed Tony when he thought Tony was a hallucination, it was nothing to the way he missed Tony now that he knew Tony was alive.
?  You're no good to anyone here.  Is it because you don't know how to kill yourself?  Is it that you're not sure you can even die because of what you did to yourself, what you made yourself into?  Because of the
Steve feels his false smile slip a little.  "I wouldn't mind having a chat with him.  Do you know where he is?"
“Okay, so come on,” Steve said, kicking off the edge of the wall.  “The water’s great.  Isn’t this the kind of dumb stuff people get up to when they’re drunk?”
The neighborhood was quiet this late, just the occasional car backfire or snick of a window shutting to keep out the mosquitoes, but Steve didn’t hear any of it for blocks over the rushing in his ears and the pounding of his heart.  He didn’t hear anything, really, which was why he nearly jumped out of his skin when Tony said, “That sounded pretty terrible.”
“I think I’m probably as close as we get to IT,” Tony says.  “Which, wow, lucky for you all, have you ever seen an IT guy who looks like this?”
Steve surges forward.  He twists the front of Stark’s shirt in his hand, pulling him in until they’re pressed together, chest to chest, and Stark’s tongue is hot in his mouth and Stark’s arm is wrapped around his waist and -
“Wait,” Steve says, grabbing Tony’s shoulders and pushing him away.  “Just - wait.  This’ll never work.”
Bruce and Steve looked appropriately uncomfortable; Thor looked dubious; Clint shrugged as if to say,
All of this to say that the very first game was a complete disaster and ended in a brawl that subsided only when Steve threatened to bench everyone from duty for a week, which he yelled despite being in a headlock by an apologetic but resolute Peter Parker.
“Never paid a bribe to the mob,” Clint corrects, coming around the bar to drop a tray full of empty glasses into the sink.  “We bribe police officers regularly.”
He tried to whirl back to home plate, but Steve grabbed his arm mid-whirl and totally ruined the dramatic effect.  “What?” he snapped.  “I don’t know about you, but I’d actually rather get back to baseball than continue this conversation, and you
Stark yanks up the sleeve of his jacket to show the shiny metal threaded around his arm.  “Come on, you think I’m about to walk in there without an insurance policy?”
Stark’s standing in the middle of the room, fiddling with one of his God-forsaken armbands.  “You think I’d leave just when the party’s getting started?”
“She likes him too, clearly.”  From upstairs, they hear Morgan giggle.  Pepper turns to Tony.  “So, is this a thing?  You and Steve?”
Steve laughs and reaches for Stark’s undershirt, but Stark grabs his wrist.  “That stays on,” he says, and Steve loosens his grip.
Thor brightened, and Steve looked away; he’d nearly forgotten how delighted Thor used to look at everything.  “A feast before battle!  So you admit it’s a crucial component of any fight?”
“He’s very loyal,” Clint said.  “Nat, remember that time that contractor tried to get pictures of you sunbathing?”
Steve’s blood turns to ice.  “Director Pierce?” he says, peering into the dark car.  “What’s going on?”
“Not at all,” Tony said.  “As soon as you’re eighteen you can sleep with anybody in New York, hell, you can sleep with
Steve puts them all on a grouptext, which Tony finds hilarious, and before long they start having team meetings.  They just eat pizza and talk, mostly, find their footing with each other again, figure out how to work together after everything that’s happened and everything that hasn’t.  T’Challa holos in from Wakanda, and somebody sets up their phone with Scott on FaceTime, and Nebula and Rocket and Thor check in from space sometimes, and every once in a while Carol drops by, all blonde and alien and larger than life, and drinks them all under the table.  Tony knows that Steve only has meetings because Natasha used to, that he probably wouldn’t be doing it at all if Natasha was still alive, but nobody calls him on it, and Tony thinks that she would probably like it that way.
They brought everybody home, sure, but - well, but some people came home to spouses who had remarried, and kids who had grown up, and homes in neighborhoods that had been abandoned.  The economy booms, but it leaves plenty of people behind.  There are too many lives that can’t be put back together again, Humpty-Dumpty style, and even though nobody knows for sure how they did it, everyone wonders: did you have to do it
"Rogers!" Odinson booms as Steve slides in between a couple of ladies who are sipping martinis.  "Good to see you!"
“That’s exactly my point!” Steve snaps.  “I know what that feels like!  I know what all of it feels like, and pretty much nobody else does.  And I thought after everything, maybe we could deal with all of it
“Yup,” Tony says, holding out the shield.  “I used my dad’s original specs.  Let me know if the weight doesn’t seem right, or if the edges are off, I can always - ”
“You didn’t,” Tony said.  “Not at all.  Never been less uncomfortable in my life.  Dictionary definition of comfortable?  See: Tony Stark.”
“Look, just admit it,” Tony interrupts.  “Your job is more important to you than we - than our mission is.”
,” Steve groans, and the way he looks down at Tony makes Tony feel like he just hit altitude.  It’s a
“You’re an agent for the federal bureau of investigation,” Natasha says.  “Let the right people know that you’re looking for secondary employment, and Blonsky might come to you.”
“I’m sorry,” Tony says, because he’s an adult and he’s trying to be better about this kind of thing, he really is.  “I should have talked to you, about the thing with Beck.  And I shouldn’t have jumped out of the plane when you called me on it.  That’s - there’s more to apologize for, I’ll think of it later, probably, but I really - I just want to say I’m sorry.  And that’s it.  That’s why I came, I wanted to make sure you knew about the universe thing, and about that.  And now that I’ve covered it, you can go back to never talking to me again.”
“It’s funny, actually,” Stark says, looking around at all of them, “Schmidt’s men showing up here, just a few days after Killian.  It seems like the Widow’s got a target on its back.”
Steve knew it was a dream.  He always knew he was dreaming; ever since the serum, his dreams had a slightly fuzzy quality to them, blurred at the edges and a bit unreal, nothing like the crisp view from his 20/20 eyes.  In dreams he thought fast and moved slow, and big band music mixed with holo-screens, and it all made perfect sense until it didn’t.
But Bruce wants to be ready in case there is, someday, and so he drops weights on his toes, reads pre-Decimation anti-vaccination articles, watches TV coverage of the politicians who are clearly only in it to fill the power vacuum,
“So, what,” Steve said.  “You think I should just leave her?  Go back to 2023 like none of it ever happened?”
“These deletions,” Tony said.  “To our shared server history, what are they - oh.  These are things the kids looked up and then asked you to hide, right?”
Steve glares at the buttons on the panel next to the doors.  A servant with nothing to do but drive, six automobiles, an automated elevator - Stark clearly spares no expenses, and wastes plenty, too.  Steve can’t wait to give him a piece of his mind and then turn around and go straight home.
Tony lets out a breath.  “Got it.  That, uh - okay.  I think I understand what you’re saying.  What did he tell you?”
Steve rebuckles his belt and decides to make the best of it.  The kitchen's fully stocked and the backyard's full of expensive-looking furniture, so he makes himself a sandwich and spreads out on a lounge chair next to the pool.  It's breezy but not cold, and LA's been subject to rolling blackouts for two years but it's all lit up tonight, twinkling yellow lights as far as Steve can see in every direction except west, where the ocean spreads out dark and endless.  This would have been an okay place to vacation, back when they still did things like that.
“It’s a flyover,” Tony interrupts.  “That’s it.  Cap’s gonna be on the ground, if he needs backup I’ll be there and if he doesn’t, they won’t even see me.”
“Oh, I’ve been skinny dipping,” Tony said, edging toward the pool.  “I did spring break in Cancun in the 90s.  There were Victoria’s Secret models involved.”
Stark shrugs.  “It’s both.  And neither.  Hey, do you want a drink?  None of the expensive stuff, though.  No offense, but I don’t want to waste it on you, considering you won’t feel it.”
standing against the wall.  “Nothing much?  It looks like - like some sort of clockwork man.  Or like some sort of… armor.”
“Friday?”  Friday speeds through the scene again, then narrows in on one moment.  “Frame by frame, baby.  There we go.  So, this is more detailed than the human eye can perceive, but if you look here - yup, there.  See anything?”
When he called Fury to ask for advice, Fury laughed, hung up on him, called him back just to laugh some more, and then said, “If nobody’s dying, Stark, I really don’t care” and hung up again.
“It’s perfect,” Steve says, in that irritating, uncomfortably genuine way he has, and Tony busies himself with finishing an entire glass of scotch so he doesn’t have to make eye contact.
weird it is, but instead it’s just not weird at all, period.  “Okay, you have to stop with the hands and the mouth and all of it because I really do have to leave.  What are you doing tomorrow?”
She leads Bruce up the stairs, down the hallway past five closed doors, and into a room which turns out... not to be a bedroom. It's Tony's library. Two stories tall, circular, a wraparound balcony halfway up, accessed only by a spiral staircase. There are red velvet couches. A globe. And, sitting in the center of the central column, a baby grand.
.  It feels a little bit like I’m taking advantage of you, are you sure I’m not taking advantage of you?”
“I’m honored,” Tony said, pressing his lips to Steve’s collarbone.  “But that said, you should really be honest during your examinations.  God, Steve, you look incredible like this.”
“Touche,” Tony says, and kisses him.  It should be weird kissing Steve whenever he wants, or at least weird how
"Your call," Tony says.  He slips on his shoes and crosses the room, presses a hard kiss to Steve's lips and then pulls away quickly, like it was an accident.  "Drive safe."
“First of all, I’m thankful for these yams, obviously,” Tony said, helping himself to the last of the yams.  “Okay, what else?  Uh, I was all prepared to be kind of a dick about Thanksgiving, because as you know I don’t really do Thanksgiving.  And when I said I didn’t do Thanksgiving, I meant that I don’t do Thanksgiving on purpose, because I don’t like Thanksgiving.”
They crawl into a bed with a heavy quilt that looks hand-made and Tony fucks him, clutches his hips so hard that Steve thinks there might still be bruises the next day.  Steve passes out immediately afterward, and when he wakes up in the afternoon Tony is sitting up in bed, still naked but engrossed in some kind of diagram on a StarkPad.  "You weren't sleeping when I texted you," Tony says, not looking up from the tablet.
“You talk too much,” Steve says, wrapping a hand around Stark’s neck and pulling him closer.  Stark grins against his lips and does something with his tongue that Steve finds
There’s an awkward silence.  “Okay,” Tony says.  “That’s fine.  I just - so you’re not staying, after dinner?”
“Okay,” Tony said as they began to devour the food as if they’d been starving in the desert for three months, “so here’s the thing.  I have literally zero experience with kids, and - ”
"Never heard of him," Banner says, and Steve slumps a little, because he can tell the man's not lying.  "But then, I don't expect I heard many real names in five years on the inside.  I never meant to - there weren't a lot of options left to me, after the war.  Peacetime doesn't call for a lot of chemical weapons specialists, especially not after what we - Blonsky was willing to pay.  If I kept my head down I could just about pretend I didn't know what he was doing."
"Oh, I don't care about the password," the bartender dismisses, his heavy Scandinavian accent not masking his amusement.  "I'm just here to make sure everyone has a good time.  The Hawk's the one who steps in when someone's having a
It wasn’t like the other times they’d traveled through the quantum realm.  Those had been fast - a flash of light and color and nothingness, and then feet firmly on the ground in a new place and time entirely.
It’s a good feeling; in fact, it’s a better feeling than Steve’s had in a while.  Ever since the war, there’s been work, and searching for Bucky, and looking over his shoulder, and not a whole lot else in between, and now all of a sudden there’s Romanov and Barton and Banner and Odinson and -
Peter dives to the floor in the center of the room and catches, at the last possible moment, a priceless porcelain vase that Sam’s thrown for him to catch.  “That was a close one,” Sam says.  “You getting tired, Parker?”
Steve swiveled toward Bruce, clearly against his will.  “A few months ago some tourists got a picture of the Hulk completely naked and Tony destroyed the photos remotely and never told you.”
Enough plates survived the juggling for each of them to claim one, and soon they were seated around a table piled so high with food that even Thor said, “I think we may have overdone it.”
Stark turns to him with a faint smile.  “I like that,” he says, and then, to Steve’s utter shock, he leans in and kisses Steve.  His lips taste of whiskey.  “I like that a lot, actually.”
The next time Tony texts him an address it's in LA.   It's already 1 am in New York and he's pretty sure Tony's drunk, if the number of typos and the wide variety of emojis is any clue, but Steve wasn't going to sleep anyway and it's not like he doesn't have access to a Quinjet, so.  He texts Tony back a thumbs up and Tony sends him back a bunch of things that he's pretty sure are meant to be inappropriate but that Steve doesn't think would be decipherable even by someone who hadn't grown up during the Depression.
. The floor he’s arrived on looks like it’s one large room, brightened by light bulbs that hang from the ceiling and cluttered with - well, with what looks mostly like trash to Steve: hunks of concrete, all kinds of tubing, sheets of glass and twisted up metal.  Strewn across one large table is the wreckage of what looks like an entire automobile.
“We would have done more than that if Papa Stark hadn’t interrupted,” Natasha said, putting out her hand to high five Thor.
"Can somebody just hold still for a second while I reload?" Stark calls out, and as Steve spins away from a punch he sees Stark fiddling with his armband.
“If you really think I’m a figment of your imagination,” Tony said, “why do you think your brain picked
“They’re growing boys,” Coulson said blandly.  “And girl,” he added as Natasha stuck her head around the corner, followed by the others.  “Wow.  This
“Always - I keep telling him, you know, the girls really go for the superhero thing, just one little social media slip-up and they’ll be lining up at your door…”
"Would you like to watch that?" she asks. "Watch his big Nordic balls bouncing as he pounds me? See him pumping his white load all over my ass?"
Tony settled himself on the floor and leaned against the sofa.  “You’re not that good at hiding things, you know.  You
“Well, I think that’s it,” Steve says an hour later.  “Pizza’s up in the penthouse if you’re staying for dinner.  Tony, can you stay back for a minute?”
Steve stares over the bar into the cracked mirror for a minute, then turns back to Banner.  "Dr. Banner, forgive me for saying so, but you're... familiar with Blonsky's work.  Intimately familiar, even.  Am I correct?"
“Oh yeah?  Well, I am.”  Stark slams his glass down.  “You and Barton still planning a run to Harlem tomorrow night?”
“You’re with me,” Director Pierce says, striding out of his office with several agents, including Sitwell.  “Now.”
“We’re not kids,” Steve interrupted, an assertion belied by the fact that his voice hadn’t dropped yet.
“And no one at SHIELD is willing to provide a remedy for the good Captain even though he inhaled this noxious substance while rescuing people from
“Jeez, I can’t wait until I can see him too,” Peter said.  “I have so much to tell him.  Wait, has he been, like, watching over us?”
Natasha didn’t lift her sunglasses, but Tony could tell the look she was giving him could best be described as
“See you in the morning?” Tony said, shoving his hands in his pockets and walking backwards down the hall.
“Well, I told you to fuck off a while back, so how could you?”  Steve threw his keys down on the table and flopped down onto the fraying sofa.  “I thought I’d gotten rid of you, actually.”
Tony let out a breath.  “So.  First time in this body.  That’s, uh.  Well, I’ll admit it, that’s hot.  For a number of reasons.  Not in like a weird popping your cherry kinda way - okay, maybe a
“Because the way it looks to me,” Pierce interrupts, “is that you’re trying to punch a little higher than your weight class.  That you’re angling for a promotion.”
"I was," she says, panting as she thighs tighten in anticipation of the waves of pleasure threatening to swamp her. "I was thinking he might take me on the bar."
"Might've worked if Rogers was here undercover, but considering he's off the clock, that'd raise a lot of questions," Stark chimes in.  "Anyway, Aldrich's paid off half of City Hall.  He could have somebody stabbed in front of the Chief of Police and he'd walk out with his nose clean."
Bruce pulls a holo-screen up from his tablet with more force than Tony is used to seeing from the recently gentle giant.  “This was just uploaded on J. Jonah Jameson’s site.”
“Not quite,” Steve says.  “I got shot at Cambrai.  I would have bled out, but the wound closed itself up before I got to a field hospital.  Still wasn’t much fun.”
“That’s right.  Just me.  Because this city, it’s in a bad way.  Our politicians are either anemic or they’re corrupt.  Our people are lazy and false; they demand abstinence out of one side of their mouths while they pour whiskey in the other.  New York City is the best America has to offer, and it’s
But the biggest barrier to Steve becoming a better cook was that he liked the microwave.  He liked the microwave
Steve’s already waiting when he gets there, Wilson and Barnes hovering behind him.  It’s a little melodramatic, Tony thinks, coming to see him off when he’ll only be gone five seconds on their end.
“Little to the left, maybe,” Tony said.  “I took one of these apart when I was a kid, you know.  I made the parts into an semi-automatic spitball gun.”
“Okay, first of all,” Tony said, “I’m so glad I died and then came back to life so I could hear you say those exact words, it was all worth it, and second of all, no, you don’t have to go back to the future.  You live here now.”
“Okay, a few things I’ve learned that’ll save you some time,” he said in place of a greeting.  “One: do
“You picked the wrong side in all of this,” Steve says.  “The city may be sick, but you’re what’s making it sicker.  We won’t let you get away with it.”
And as it turned out, having a roommate who liked to cook had major benefits.  There was always something in the fridge to eat, and it was actually kind of nice when everybody sat down to dinner together.  Plus, Tony had once come home to find Clint making pasta by hand from, like, flour and water and time, which was fascinating, because Tony, who was Italian, genuinely hadn’t known that pasta came in “fresh”.
“Might be efficient during grape-stomping season,” Clint said thoughtfully, and pulled out a small, unusually-shaped, tightly corked elixir bottle.
“Must have missed that one,” Steve said innocently, collecting a few more plates and dropping them into the sink.
of suction and spit.  “Yeah, look at you.  I’m going to fuck your face, is that - yeah, it seems like that’s okay,” Tony said, as Steve groaned again, his hand working furiously between his own legs.
“Jesus,” Tony muttered, and if that wasn’t permission then he didn’t know what was; he dragged Steve forward by the hair and thrust his cock all the way into Steve’s mouth, and Steve just took it, making his mouth into a perfect
Steve sighed and dropped his head back, stared up at the ceiling.  There was a water stain in the corner.  “I guess it makes sense that you’d come back now.”  He chuckled.  “At least I have my hallucinations to keep me company.”
“You could argue that, but I think you’ll find that Tony Stark has managed to build a company that is
?) was at least better than his other options, were were: listening to Tony and Bruce agonize over their equations for the thousandth time, standing pointlessly off to the side while Thor and Carol argued about the likelihood that what they were planning would cause in a tear in the fabric of the universe, and watching Scott play Rock Band.
But it turned out Tony was none of those things, and so as they got to the top of the stairs Tony turned around and said, “Do you - ”
“I mean, not that we know of,” Scott says.  “But do you ever think we should have, like, a second headquarters?”
Pierce smiles.  “Now, come out from behind that bar, won’t you, doll?   My good friend Mr. Killian will be taking over your joint starting tomorrow, and he’d prefer to to keep the clean-up to a minimum.”
He pressed his lips together and pounded his way down the back steps.  Just another thing to add to the list.
Steve leans back in his chair and tunes them out.  He’s pretty sure they can count it a success, all in all: Banner has a black eye, Tony’s wrist is singed from his armband, and Miss Romanov lost her hat in the commotion, but they got nineteen girls out of one of Vanko’s establishments.  Miss Romanov’s got them set up at a ladies boarding house across town, and Tony’s offered them all bus tickets home or jobs in one of Stark Industrial’s typing pools.
“Stop lying,” the other man says calmly.  “You’re not going to save them with your bullshit, Rogers.  Now tell me: how many do you think she has back there?  I promised a lot of heads to a lot of people, son, and you know I never break a promise.  I don’t, do I?”
He considered staying in bed until his headache went away or until the heat death of the universe, whichever came first, but was eventually lulled downstairs by the memory of Gatorade in the fridge and the scent of bacon in the air.  He assumed he’d find Edgar in the kitchen, so he was mid yawn when he walked in and found a very, ah,
Steve pauses outside the next door, but there’s nothing for it.  He cracks open the door and, squeezing his eyes shut, calls out, “Begging your pardon, but are there any towels in here?”
“I think he thought he could reason with them.  Most people are happy about what you guys did, but not everybody, you know?”
“What?” Steve frowned fetchingly.  Oh, god.  Did he just think the word “fetching”?  Tony mentally upgraded his crush status from “probably” to “definitely, you embarrassing fuck.”
, Tony was maybe a little drunk even by Stark Family Holiday standards because instead of getting ready for Steve to walk in the door Tony had just
In the dim lights from the warehouse they’re standing on top of, Steve’s jaw works; he’s holding himself stock still in a way most people can’t.  Tony knows him well enough to know that he only does that when he’s trying to hide something, trying to conceal what he’s feeling.  It’s a move Tony’s familiar with, but he’s not used to seeing it used against him anymore.
Third floor, the heat building as she climbs, Natasha hears the clamour of the Krajnc family with their six daughters and fox terrier, all of whom, by the sound of it, are future opera singers.
“If you say so,” Steve says, slamming a fist into the man approaching Natasha from behind.  “Everybody else okay?”
Rogers looks around at each of them and sighs, resigned.  “I’ve got a friend who works for them.  Or at least, he
“Okay, none of that,” Tony said.  “We’re off the clock.  We’re sitting by the pool.  We’re all aware of the massive mess waiting for us, but right now we’re in hiding, so can you lay off me for like, five minutes?”
A lot of people think Tony Stark can’t possibly want for anything.  The rich boy, the genius, the guy who has fourteen cars and knows the President’s cell phone number and can
Dopey is, technically, outrageously illegal, but then so is flying a manned aircraft without the express authorized permission of the FAA, so, you know.  It’s also
much smaller than his Project Rebirth file had indicated, who challenged Thor and his Steve’s-head-sized biceps for the last donut, who watched
“I’m sure,” Steve said.  “I’ve wanted this for a long time and also I’m physically incapable of lying right now.”
“Volume zero,” Tony says.  He watches Beck talk silently, his mouth twisting around bitter syllables.  “Hey Dopey.  Can you do me a favor and filter the current list of potential targets by people I’ve personally met.”
“Peg,” Steve said, and took a deep breath.  “I just couldn’t sleep, all right?  Go back to bed, I’ll be there in a minute.”
do is take all the data that exists pretty much everywhere (yes, even you, people who shared that Facebook post about not allowing Facebook to have your data) and spit out scenarios and probabilities.  It doesn’t analyze them, doesn’t lay out any conjectures or think for itself, which is fine, because Tony is perfectly capable of doing all the thinking for it.
“Nope,” Tony said while 90 pounds of future supersoldier windmilled in Clint’s general direction.  “He could crush you like a bug if he wanted to.  Luckily for you, Clint doesn’t hit people when he’s not getting paid for it.”
“Not just at the moment, thanks, Jarvis, just leave it on the cart,” Tony says, looking amused.  “Skittish much, Cap?”
And then he comes, his back arching off the bed, and Stark kisses him through it, swallowing his bitten-off moans and never slowing down, until a moment later he’s spending himself across Steve’s stomach, his hips juddering to a stop.
permanent residents,” Tony said, getting out of the elevator and making for Thor’s door.  It was closed, but the handle turned under Tony’s touch, so he took a deep breath and opened it.
“Whatever you say,” Stark murmurs, burrowing into his pillow, and Steve’s gonna slide out from under his arm and find his clothes and head for the subway in just a moment.
“A bunch of fucking iPhone screens,” Tony says, throwing his phone onto the table.  “I don’t know what this is, but it’s not some long-buried demon.  It’s tech.”
Steve grabs his shield off his back and spins, throws it at the side of a shipping container.  The container crumples like aluminum foil.  The police officers in the warehouse turn toward him, and Steve senses rather than sees weapons drawn on all sides.
"Not really," Steve says, waving down the bartender, Odinson.  "Another whiskey for me, and whatever my friend here wants."
Strange walks him back to the front door.  When his hand is on the handle, he pauses.  “Tony,” he says, “it doesn’t really mean anything, the fact that we’re not the first.  First doesn’t mean anything.  No universe is first; they all exist simultaneously, because and in spite of each other.  And every choice, every single action opens up new branches full of new possibilities.  Fate doesn’t tell us what to do.  Sometimes things happen, sometimes they don’t.  Today, you get to keep making choices.”  Strange smiles at him, one of the few genuine ones Tony’s ever seen on the man’s face, and it’s gone just as fast as it appeared.  “Try not to waste them?”
“Honestly, it would be great free marketing,” Clint said.  “Things have been a little slow this season.”
They walked quietly for several blocks.  If Tony had really been there, the silence would have been almost companionable.
Steve crawls forward, edging toward a dropped pistol and trying to sort out which feet belong to Pierce.  “I don’t see what’s smart about going into business with criminals.”
“How can you possibly be surprised by any of this?” Tony says.  “I’m selfish.  I’m reckless.  I do whatever the hell I want to do regardless of what it means for anybody else.  I mean Christ, it’s not a secret, they say it on TV!”
“Could be so many things,” Tony says.  “I was an asshole for a long time.  I’m still an asshole, actually.”
"What do you think?"  Tony throws back the last of the cheap bourbon they found in the liquor cabinet downstairs.  "You want a ride anywhere?"
Stark sniffs and then pulls back.  "Funny," he says.  "You've been drinking all night, but I can't even smell it on you."
“I’ve been thinking about that myself,” Steve says.  “And nobody’s said a word at the bureau - they told the office that Pierce decided to retire, and he was replaced the next day with some guy outta Washington.  A couple of the other fellas disappeared too, including Sitwell - the official word is they’ve been transferred, but some of the other agents are suspicious.”
“They all seem happy and healthy and alive,” Coulson said.  “Seems like you’re doing pretty well.  Any of them calling you Dad yet?”
Tony flips them until he’s pinning Steve to the bed.  He’s grinning as widely as Steve’s seen in a while, and Steve can’t help but grin back.  “That’s only if you drive under the speed limit.”
“You didn’t wake me up,” Steve snapped.  “I woke myself up.  And now I’m talking to myself.  Because you’re
Bruce’s cheeks turn faintly pink, to Natasha’s delight.  “You could dance with any fella here tonight, Miss Romanov.  Why are you so interested in me?”
“Lies, all of it,” Tony says, shoving a drink in Rhodey’s direction as Steve walks up to the bar.  “Hiya, Cap.  Can I get you anything?”
“Strong?  What’s - oh my god,” Tony said as it clicked into place.  “You’re drinking Thor’s Asgardian booze!”
He's about to hop in a cargo plane that'll get him most of the way back to New York when he gets a text from Tony.
The next thing Tony knows his head in is a toilet bowl.  A very expensive, state-of-the-art toilet bowl, sure, but still.
“Most of them look like Blonsky’s scientists have had their way with them,” Thor says.  “It may not be so easy.”
“Anything you want,” Tony says, waving his hand at the walls and nearly spilling his glass.  “All yours, pal.”
experimenting with the Quantum time machine, because they destroyed it, it never existed, whatever your particular clearance level indicates, etc.  Wanda takes 102, and Wilson moves into her guest room.  One weekend Tony visits and finds that Steve has re-done the gym with the kind of supersoldier-tolerant weights they had back at the base, even though he’s still living in Brooklyn in what Tony can only assume is a sad, asbestos-ridden bachelor pad.
“Good morning!” Clint said, bursting out from around the corner and thoroughly ruining what was becoming a very nice and suddenly very
And here was the thing: Tony knew what it looked like when someone was coming onto him.  He had experience - he had a
"As always, miss," he says under his breath, and she presses an air kiss to his cheek and heads for the back stairs.
Happy, who hears stranger from Tony on a regular basis, just nods and gets in the Audi.  Admittedly, the air in Manhattan isn’t particularly fresh, but after days spent holed up in the workshop with only Fox and Friends for company, it feels good to be outside.
Steve didn’t think that Sam would have anything good to say about fighting off PTSD-induced hallucinations by
Dopey doesn’t reply, because Tony hasn’t given Dopey the ability to hold a conversation.  His drives are all too busy copying every piece of data uploaded to the internet on a sixteen picosecond delay.
"Aren't you going to offer me a drink?" she says, and sees from his startle reflex that the question was entirely unanticipated. Interesting.  For a man with lips like an Italian poet and a frame like a Nebraska farmhouse, he acts like he's Quasimodo.
“I love Peggy,” Steve said.  “And I - thought I’d belong here.”  He looked out the window, watched the first grey light of dawn trickle in from the east.  “But sometimes I think that maybe I don’t belong anywhere anymore.  How’s
“Have you considered the possibility that you’re overestimating how much you want to know about what’s on my mind?” Bruce says wryly.
does, and so he’s torn: is it setting a better example to blatantly lie, or to tell your twenty year old mentee about your utter failure to have anything approaching a normal human relationship?
“Right here,” Natasha says smoothly, appearing out of the smoke at his elbow and slashing at one of Killian’s men with a pocketknife as he lunges at her.  “I’m sincerely hoping you’re not about to tell me this is no place for a lady.”
When he opens his eyes again, he’s pretty sure it’s been more than five minutes.  He sits up with a frown.  “Friday?”
“Girls,” Barton spits.  “They go after kids who show up in the city with nothin but a suitcase and a dream, offer ‘em jobs and places to stay, and then - ”  He shrugs, his face twisted.  “They’re moving a group of ‘em tomorrow night.  Out of state.  From there...”
“He couldn’t be drunk!” Bruce said.  “The other guy.  His metabolism is like - it’s a hundred times - it’s
“She thinks I might be able to do some work for the SSR, in a few years,” Steve said.  “Nothing at HQ, but ops, maybe. Get a group of specialists young enough that they don’t remember my reels, wait until beards come into style, it might be an option.”
“Jesus,” Barton says, sounding stunned, and the few goons who can still move of their own accord stumble to the stairs to escape.  Steve doesn’t even care: he crashes across the room, the blast still echoing in his ears, and falls to his knees beside Tony.
And that means that just when Tony thought he was laying the bait, he was actually walking right into the trap.  God, how could he have been so stupid?
“If you say so,” Steve says, and without another glance back, he walks to the edge of the warehouse and jumps down, lands on his feet and walks toward the road.  Tony watches him, but just for a minute, and then he flips the face plate down and shoots into the sky.
“Hey,” Tony says, because now that anger isn’t burning bright in his chest he feels sick, like maybe he’s made a mistake, maybe he’s made a
“Not my problem,” Tony said, pulling his finger out of Steve’s grasp and burying his face in his glass.  “Should we turn some music on?”
"No, not at all," he says, glancing up at her and then away quickly, like he's afraid she'll catch him staring.  The poor thing; she already has.  "I was just, uh.  The shower."
They all pointedly do not look at Natasha, who's staring at Bruce with her arms folded across her chest.
“I wasn’t sure you’d remember,” Steve said, and he sounded… cautious.  Nervous, maybe.  Tony didn’t like him nervous, he decided, especially not when it was
Tony shrugs.  “Can’t change the past, remember?  So they’re creating infinite alternate universes.  We’ll worry about it when it starts impacting us.”
“The thing is, though,” Tony said, sauntering across the room, “I’ve really got my heart set on one in particular.”
Tony pretends to look thoughtful.  “An interesting idea.  I can think of a few other ways to get ahold of
“If there’s one thing the future got right, it’s mattresses,” Steve agreed.  It was crowded in the bed, the space between them barely a hair’s breadth, but the half of Tony’s face that Steve could see in the dim light looked happy enough.
In New York, Steve stays on the base and Tony stays in the city and when they talk, which they don't often do, it's about the UN, or the latest message from Thor, or where the hell Carol Danvers went after she somehow brought Tony and Nebula back from that spaceship that was almost their graveyard.  They don't talk about Bruce's experiments in rage, or Natasha's silence, or where the fuck Clint is, and they definitely don't talk about why they disappear for days at a time off to Florida or Toronto or Cincinnati and break into abandoned homes or check into mid-tier hotels under fake names and fuck until Steve can finally fall asleep, for a little bit, if he's lucky.
become part of the night.  Steve can see acres of tree-dotted land in every direction, and in the distance, Long Island Sound.
"Take notice," Thor whispers into her mouth as Clint begins to edge her panties aside, "you have an observer."
.  “I think it may actually be very much my business.  You and me, I think we might be looking for some of the same things.”
“I don’t know, some kind of DNA project?” Morgan suggested.  “There are a lot of cool applications of very small amounts of DNA.  Ooh, are you growing a clone of me?”
And Steve turned back to the mess in the kitchen, took a deep breath, and... started loading the leftovers into tupperware.  Because, hey.  You never know.
“Name’s Hogan, by the way,” the man says.  “Pleased to meet you, sorry for strong-arming you back there.”
Stark grins at him, and Steve finds himself grinning back before he can stop himself.  “At least if I crash it, you’ll have five more to spare.”
“Captain Rogers is approaching the lab,” JARVIS said smugly, and Tony groaned, because, in fact, according to Tony’s Official Guide To Shit You’re Allowed To Interrupt Me For, Steve
“You should get up there,” Tony said quietly, and Steve looked up.  Tony was still in the corner, watching him.
“Not exactly,” JARVIS said.  “Agent Romanov and Mr. Odinson have just left the tower.  I believe they’re hailing a cab.”
“Just dandy,” Barton says from where he’s perched on the bar, taking aim at a mobster’s kneecaps.  “For a minute there I thought we’d have to take you out too, Rogers.”
Fury glares around at all of them, presumably just because he can, and then pulls out a scratched up smartphone that Tony can politely describe only as
“A couple backroom deals here and there, sure, but nothing major that I’m aware of,” Steve says slowly.
Steve is that Tony has bothered to not only find him, but to walk into the only bar in Wall, South Dakota, sit down at the next barstool, pull off his sunglasses - which he’s wearing
The address is up in the hills.  He parks next to a bright red Lamborghini and pushes open the front door, which is unlocked but doesn't look like it was recently picked, and Steve wonders vaguely if Tony stills owns property on the west coast; he's considering poking around looking for clues when he hears a crash.
Tony could see it coming a mile away: she was inching forward, then inching forward again, and Steve, bless his heart, was absolutely
“I’ve heard,” Steve says.  “You know, when I went over to the tower today, I thought the worst thing that could happen was that you really were passed out drunk at Borgata.”  He shakes his head, gives a brittle laugh.  “But I was wrong.  This is so much worse.  Because if you don’t want to be with me, hey, that’s fine, I can take it.  But this?  This means you don’t trust me.  This means that after all we’ve been through, we’re not even
Steve’s hips bucked a little helplessly.  “Tony, I’m going to lose it if you keep teasing me like this.”
“True, you might have to fight off a few of those girls,” Stark says, joining him at the railing.  “They won’t want to let you go home alone.”
Everyone looks at Barton expectantly.  “What?” he says finally, staring around blankly.  “I go where Nat goes.”
“Do you think if we dosed you with truth serum, anything would even change?” Steve said with a smirk.
“Sorry,” Tony said, but he didn’t sound it at all.  “Didn’t mean to catch you in the middle of the night.”
Stark blows out a breath.  “It’s not that often I meet people who want some of the same things I do.  Most of the people I know - they’re around because they want something from me.  They like me for what I can do for them.  Gets tired, you know?  It’s kinda nice to be around somebody who actually
“It sucked,” Tony says.  “And the shittiest part is that I can’t promise I won’t do it again.  I want to but I - well, I try not to make promises I can’t keep.”
She leans in close, until her voice is just a breath in his ear.  “I like to think I know myself better than that.”
to outrun that, just like you don't deserve anybody's forgiveness, like you don't deserve for Natasha to even
The elevator doors slide open silently, and the penthouse is bathed in bright morning light.  “Hi Daddy,” Morgan calls out.
“There’s going to be another time?” Steve said, dropping his head back against the door and closing his eyes as Tony began to stroke him through the denim of his jeans, sucking at the spot right below Steve’s ear until he squirmed.
“Sorry to bother you, Agent Rogers, but do you have those reports for the judiciary committee ready?”
Pepper smiles fondly.  “It was ugly between you two once.  I don’t want you to get hurt like that again.”
“You’re welcome to stay, I’m just gonna go back to, you know - ” and here Stark gestures around the cluttered work space, “all of this.  I’m serious about taking one of the cars out, though.  Next weekend?  I’ll teach you how to drive if you don’t know how.”
“No, it’s not a murder winery,” Clint said, rolling his eyes.  “It’s a breaking and entering, grand larceny and, like, brief kidnapping winery.”
“I’m too old for some of the types of good times we used to have,” Tony says, pulling on sweats and t-shirt.
“Cool,” Tony says.  “The second one is, uh.  Well, it’s a little more complicated.  You know how, with universes, there’s more than one?  Well, I found out that we aren’t the first universe to beat Thanos.  We’re a branched one.”
"At one of Tony's parties?" says Natasha. "Every bedroom on the first floor will have long since been occupied. We're going somewhere a little more private."
“You know from personal experience?” Tony said, and then winced, because of course he did, everyone knew he did, Tony’s 3rd grade
“Well, believe me, I’m the expert in riding out bad press, and getting yourself beat up by a bunch of maniacs?  It’s not going to win you any sympathy.”
“Oh, you’re on, kid,” Sam says.  “Tony, you got any more junk lying around that we can throw off the tower?”
Not that this is easier than marriage, though.  Leaving Morgan half the time, waving to Pepper from the car while Morgan runs down the front steps with her My Little Pony backpack, keeping the smile on his face until she’s out of sight when Happy drives away with her again a few days later - no, it’s not easy.  Tony made the first Iron Man suit in a cave with a box of scraps, Tony fought aliens and robots and gods, Tony
Pepper reaches out, puts her hand on his.  “We have to move forward, Tony.  I know you feel guilty it happened in the first place, but if you feel guilty about the way you chose to fix it, too, you’ll never move past it, you’ll never - ”
At least, that’s what he thought.  Steve wasn’t always sure, anymore, if he knew what the real Tony would do.  Sometimes, the real Tony seemed at risk of disappearing, fading out of focus underneath this fake Tony that Steve had dreamed up.  Steve didn’t want him to disappear; the real Tony had been brilliant, and infuriating, and arrogant, and brave, and not Steve’s at all.  This Tony was almost a different person entirely.
And the very next night at dinnertime, the elevator doors swung open to reveal a massive, fully-decorated Christmas tree, complete with twinkly lights and rows of ribbon and a Swarovski-bejeweled star at the top that just barely cleared the elevator door from where it was balanced on Steve’s shoulder.
Steve thinks about everything, and he wants so badly to think about nothing, just for a second, so he packs a bag, leaves his phone on the bedside table, and gets on his bike.
“There she is,” Pierce says warmly, like a man greeting a dog.  “Our busy little lady.  You’ve gotten yourself into all
to be the last one to sit down, a sort of violent musical chairs that ended only when Natasha grabbed a plastic fork and aimed it at Clint’s crotch so pointedly that he held his hands up in the universal sign for “I give” and accepted his fate.
Steve turns closer to the wall and cups his hand over his mouth.  “How’d you even get this number?  We’re unlisted.”
"Perhaps he believes deeply in temperance," Odinson says seriously, and then throws back his head and laughs.  "I've no idea.  He's a man of mystery."
“There, was that so hard?” Tony said.  “You can go back to your meeting now.  Thank you for your service to this country.”
“I don’t know,” Tony said.  “I don’t have all the answers.  But I’m not - she cares about you, right?  She wouldn’t want you to stay when you’re so unhappy.  And you don’t want to make her unhappy anymore, either.  Neither of you deserve that.”
“I’m also thankful for the fact that the Packers are decent this year and, relatedly, for Tony’s 90 inch TV.  I’m thankful that I only broke one of my toes two weeks ago when that robot turtle thing showed up in the Village, seriously, fuck that thing, how was it so slow but also so graceful?  Oh, I’m thankful for another year that Nick Fury pays me to shoot people.  And I’m thankful for having a bunch of assholes to cook Thanksgiving dinner for.”
Four men walk into the warehouse; Steve’s stomach flips over, but none of them are Bucky.  Steve counts seven guns between them, and that’s just what he can see above their clothes.
“It might be,” Stark says.  “But I’m sick of sitting around watching Killian and all the rest of them get more and more powerful every day.”
And that’s when Steve shuts the door behind Sam, crosses the room, hauls Tony up by his t-shirt and kisses him.
"So what's important enough to make you want to come in here and risk all that?" Stark says.  "Or maybe it's
“Of course it’s not,” Odinson says, and winks, and Steve follows him back into the bar, that good post-fight feeling disappearing as fast as the gin in the glasses of the Black Widow’s best customers.
Tony sighed.  “Look, I know it’s hard to understand, but I’m okay.  I see my kid sometimes, I see Peter and Rhodey.  Pepper, too, once in a while.  But, you know, it’s been almost ten years in the future too, so.  Some ships have sailed.”
"So," Stark says after Romanov's disappeared into the back room of the Black Widow, Barton hot on her heels, "I noticed you still haven't left, even though everybody here knows you're the fuzz
“Timelines branch out from every decision point in the universe,” Strange says.  “Every series of events, every possible path where Thanos triumphed, that was a branch I saw snuffed out.  But once we won the one we did, it opened up a new set of branches.  A whole tree’s worth, you might say.  All of those were obscured to me at that moment, because they couldn’t exist without the first one.  But once the one existed, the others opened up.  They were free to happen, or not happen.”
The elevator doors slide open silently, and when Nicola turns toward them she stops, startled.  “Oh.  Hel-
Steve straightens his shirt and hangs his shield on his back calmly.  “Kind of sucks when somebody you care about does something stupid, right?”
They look at each other.  The mood in the car goes taut, like a finely-tuned bowstring.  Tony swallows.  “I don’t know if you want to, uh…”
Tony took a swig of champagne and raised his eyebrows.  “You really think I’m gonna mess up my hair with one of those things?  Dream on, Capsicle.”
Tony would have guessed it would be weird sleeping with a guy you’ve known for years, a guy you’ve punched in the face (repeatedly), a guy you never thought would sleep with guys at all and especially not with you, but Tony can admit when he’s wrong and he’s
“We’re getting there,” Hope said from where she was bent over the console.  Across the room, Hank and Janet were doing final checks on the quantum realm ship.  “You ready?”
“Aw, jeez,” Clint said, reaching out and grabbing Steve’s elbow to pull him up, because Clint, it turned out, was the only one of them who was truly a good bro.  “You okay?”
“I’m always telling him he should go more often,” Shirley said.  “Maybe you two could go together one day!”
“It’s too bad,” Peter says, “you know, that the stones couldn’t just - take us all back five years.  To right when it happened, so it didn’t have to be so hard for all the people who were still here, you know?”
It’s past midnight on a Thursday in March when Steve looks at his phone and realizes it’s Sam’s birthday.
the right term for hooking up with a friend and colleague you were currently on the run with.  No pretending not to recognize each other in the elevator after this, that was for sure.
“Such confidence,” Tony said, settling himself at the table across from Steve.  “This is a game changer, right?  Man, people say dating long distance is tough, but dating from different points in the spacetime continuum, now
But, curiously enough, that Friday night Twitter lit up brighter than the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree with reports of Santa himself flying around the five boroughs distributing presents at shelters, and if his reindeer and sleigh seemed powered more by repulsors than magic, well, none of the adults were going to mention it.
It’s frustrating as hell being stuck in a partially-functioning suit, and even moreso once his comms come back online and confirm what Tony had known, in the pit of his stomach, was true: that Beck was three steps ahead of him and long, long gone.
“You have no idea what that’s supposed to mean,” Tony echoes.  “So all that shit you said, that was how you feel about Bruce?”
He goes to Bleecker Street once, makes it all the way to Strange’s block, considers walking up and knocking on the door and asking the question he doesn’t want to know the answer to -
.  And anyway they’ve texted, and Steve sent him that meme that’s going around with the elephant and the banana (which, for the record, it’s adorable that Steve thinks he might be far enough ahead of the meme game to be the first to send it to Tony, bless his elderly little heart.)
Steve straightens up slightly, keeps his breathing shallow.  He'd prefer not to make a scene, but he will if he has to; he can't lose out on yet another potential lead, not now, not when he's so
Steve came marching out of his room, stood uneasily at Tony’s side until he looked up, and then said, “I don’t think I’m supposed to be here.”
; the whole thing was a projection.  Beck’s projection mapping is even more advanced than Tony suspected; he knew once he realized who Beck was that what they were dealing with was a more advanced form of BARF, but this is some next level shit, a fully-realized and definitely-weaponized version of everything they’d been trying to do in 2016.  It was horrifying.  It was
Strange looks at him for a while.  Just when Tony is about to give up and head for the door,  he says, “Are you sure you wouldn’t like some tea?”
“Well, you’re continuing it,” Tony said, splashing him back and then dunking under the water to avoid the counter-attack.  The pool was lit from below and the view under the water was, not to put too fine a point on it, very worth the cost of admission of over-chlorinated eyeballs.
Strange sighs.  “You say you feel like there’s a man alive in the world who shouldn’t be.  But should or shouldn’t - that’s beside the point.  Because there’s another man, a different man, who decided that man
“Fuck,” he murmurs into his pillow.  His head hurts and his mouth is dry and yeah, the sex was great, sure, but god he hopes nobody saw them leaving together, for a number of reasons, including Pepper, and Morgan, and Rhodey, who will probably yell at him about how he’s too old to be sleeping with actresses who used to be ten years and are now fifteen years his junior, and, he thinks with a wince, oh yeah  -
Stark reaches forward and yanks open the door to reveal a carpeted room with weights along the wall and several balls of different sizes lined up on the floor.  “Calisthenics.  Were you expecting something different?”
“Something big full of something small,” Tony says.  “A truck, maybe an RV.  They got here so fast, they must have some kind of mobile lab.”
“I hope you’re not about to tell me off for what I said back there,” Steve says, folding his arms across his chest.
Morgan, who was nine going on nineteen, rolled her eyes.  “It’s just algebra, Dad.  At my age you were doing calculus.”
“And I never agreed to work with you,” Rogers says.  “I’m running my own op, if you want in you’ll have to go through me.”
“Sometimes,” Steve said, writhing under Tony’s lips and his hands, tracing a winding path up Steve’s inner thigh.  “Sometimes I’d probably just tell you how much I want you.  I think about it a lot, I don’t want you to know how much I think about it, please kiss me so I can
Natasha freezes.  She spins toward Clint, in his usual position by the door, and sees him cock his head toward her.
“Well, give it a rest.  You’ve done enough, Tony,” Steve says, and it’s the biggest load of bullshit he’s ever heard but Tony doesn’t bother to call him on it.
Barnes seems to consider it, but opens the door wider and lets him in.  He crosses his arms over his chest, and Tony can tell he doesn’t want to move from where he stands now, between Tony and Steve.  “Whatever you did, I sure hope you can fix it.”
“It isn’t, really,” Tony said.  “But the thing about the Infinity gauntlet is that it kind of changes the meaning of
Strange leans back in his seat and considers Tony.  “When I told you on Titan that we only succeeded in one outcome,” he says, “it was because that was all I could see at that time.”
Tony thinks of the bed in the penthouse that he sleeps in more and more these days, when he stays in the city late or has early meetings or, well, just because, and he smiles bracingly at Peter.  “Sure.”
“No, we can’t drop it,” Steve said angrily.  “I would have preferred to talk about it last night, but you turned around and
“I asked him once, he said no,” Tony says.  “But I think he’ll change his mind.  Maybe you could pitch it to him, kids always love you, what kid can say no to Captain America?”
“I give up,” he said, and then, because everything apparently hated him back, he accidentally hit send on a single letter “p”.
Steve flops back against the pillows and surveys the room.  It’s spacious, just like everything else in the house, classy and elegant, but also a little… empty.  It doesn’t feel lived in, and it
One of the thugs behind Killian steps toward Stark, and what happens next is a blur: one second Stark's standing still, and then next his hand's up.  There's a
than crazy, to close your eyes and lean forward and try to kiss a hallucination, but Steve had been crazy for a long time by now, so -
Tony snorts.  “What, no backup projectors?  That’s pretty weak, if you’d asked me to come on as a consultant I could have told you - ”
The house is set back from the street, hidden behind trees and shrubs, and as the car gets to the end of the driveway Steve whistles between his teeth.   “I know, right?” Happy says, shutting down the car.
“I guess I’d have to list them all out to know for sure,” Steve continued, his eyes slowly widening as he realized that was exactly what he was about to do.  “The worst thing that ever happened to me was waking up in 2011 and finding out pretty much everyone I’d ever known was dead.  The second worst thing that ever happened to me was when Bucky died. The third worst thing that ever happened to me was - ”
"And what's even more galling," Steve says, hearing his voice rise, "is that you think you have the right to somebody like Natasha."
work,” Bruce said.  “If what Steve’s been… told by Tony... is true, it’s a little different than, you know, anything that’s ever been done in the history of the world.”
“He cares about you,” Peter says.  “And you care about him.  That’s obvious even to me, and you literally tried to hide it from me.”
Steve, who is sitting as far from Tony as he can get while still being at the same table, says, “I’m not anybody’s boss.  I’m more like a supervisor.”
“I must have missed my invitation, but luckily for you all I don’t mind party crashing,” Tony said, coming around the corner carrying a bottle of wine in each hand.  “Red or white?”
Natasha stills as she realizes that, without noticing, she has picked up Banner's hat. Damnit. Clint will have noticed that. She sets the hat back down, feeling the stillness behind her that means that Clint and Thor have both finished locking the doors and wiping down their counters, and are waiting on her to go. Natasha is suddenly, desperately antsy, as fractious as a teenager. She wants, badly, to be drunk; to be pummeled; to be locked in a barrel and thrown over a goddamnned waterfall. Anything to free her of thought, of caution; anything to be fifteen again, and as carefree and heartless as she was the day before she lost everything. She feels like she just might vibrate out of her skin if she has to control her face for one more moment--to pretend to be some man's property for one more moment.
They walked a few more blocks, and Tony almost ran into him - or would have, if he was corporeal - when Steve stopped and unlocked a door tucked in next to a laundromat.
The men are efficient and not exactly gentle as they pat down first Steve, then Banner; Steve holds his breath when they get to Tony, but the man moves on quickly.  One of them turns toward Miss Romanov with a leer, but she steps closer to Steve and he throws his arm around her.  “Not my girl,” he says firmly.
Steve hears it before he sees it: a blast louder than a bullet, louder even than the smoke grenade, and before he can move there’s a hole in Pierce’s chest the size of a fist and he’s falling, limp as a rag doll, the tommy gun clattering to the floor.
Natasha wonders for a minute if Stark’s about to storm away, but then he throws back his head and laughs.  “That’s a good question, Barton, a very good question, and the answer is they’ve got plenty on me.  More red on my ledger than I can ever get rid of, in fact.  If any of them ever decide it’s time to come for me, I’m looking at the inside of a jail cell if I’m lucky and the bottom of the Hudson if I’m not.  So sure, maybe I’m talking about a pre-emptive strike.  Show them that not everybody’s just gonna roll over.”
When Tony woke up the next morning he remembered exactly three things about Thanksgiving: Clint’s absurdly perfect yams, the look on Steve’s face just before he kissed him, and the taste of Clint’s absurdly perfect yams as they came back up.
Sneaking up on the guy doesn’t go super well, and Tony is extra glad he made Steve a new shield because otherwise he would have been looking at a face full of tentacle, but three against one are tough odds even for enhanced mutant maniacs and it’s not long before they’re stuffing the guy and his remaining tentacles into the back of a police van.
When Tony woke up a few hours later, it was still dark out, and Steve was propped up on one elbow and staring at him.
“Uh, did you guys forget this is my place?” Clint said.  “You think you can just skinny dip in my pool, use about a million of my towels and then eat all my nachos?”
?” Bruce said, emerging from the main house and looking around in confusion.  “I was trying to find the kitchen.”
“And it’s all yours,” Stark says, tossing it to him.  The shield is impossibly lightweight, all smooth rounded edges and shining surfaces, and Steve loves it immediately.  “Couple other things here for the rest of the gang - Odinson seems like he’d be into blunt force objects, and Barton could use a holster or four.  Natasha is knives, all knives, like a scary number of knives, but I can’t figure out what Banner wants, what do you think Banner wants?”
Steve takes stock of his surroundings.  The bar, he realizes, is nearly empty - in retrospect, people started filtering out sometime after his altercation with the Hawk - and it's just him, Banner, and Stark, grouped together in front of the bar.  Even Odinson has disappeared.  There are four of them, though Steve has a feeling Killian himself won't get his hands dirty; it won't be easy but he should be able to take at least two of the bodyguards at once, and if anything he's heard about Banner is true, then -
, including known enemies of the United States. For all you know, you brought back members of HYDRA.”  Jameson leans back in his seat.  “But then again, it’s well known that you count HYDRA operatives among your closest friends.”
Steve smiles back as she sashays to the other end of the bar to murmur something in Barton's ear.  The room is packed full of people - people dancing, and talking, and laughing, and suddenly Steve feels like he sticks out like a sore thumb.
“Indeed, it would have been most unfortunate if you had chosen the other side,” Odinson rumbles as he grapples with one of Blonsky’s big men.
By the time they pull up to the cabin in Pennsylvania, they’ve learned that Steve went to P.S. 3, that his best friend’s name is Sam, and that his favorite color is (shocker) blue, same as Morgan’s.  “Wanna come see my dollhouse?” Morgan asks as she clambers out of her booster seat.  “Me and Daddy built it together and it has an elevator Friday operates just like at the tower.”
Tony nodded mutely, because he didn’t think he’d ever had a one night stand make him breakfast before.  Their chef, maybe.  He poured himself a cup of coffee and hunkered down at the counter with as much water as he could carry.  “How are
Not that he’d ever really thought about it.  Ever since he could remember, there had always been other people to deal with food, or if for whatever reason there wasn’t, there was always the equally simple option of Not Dealing With Food.  Tony could make a mean smoothie, and Tony could boil water if it was needed for some kind of experiment, but beyond that Tony’s various kitchens were more or less decorative.
“I almost died,” Stark confirms.  “Had to get pretty creative not to, actually.  I didn’t have any immunity serum to help out.  I shut down my weapons plants the day I got back stateside.”
“He did mean all of us, you think?” Banner says hesitantly.  “I just - if they knew my background - ”
“We can always hope.”  Tony pours a glass of scotch and holds it out.  Steve reaches for it, and as soon as their fingers brush Tony blurts out, “Is this a date?” which, look, isn’t his
“That’s both terrifying and a huge turn on,” Steve said.  He dropped his forehead against Tony’s.  “This isn’t how I pictured this happening.”
If you’d asked Steve a few weeks ago, he would have said that he thought they’d all be too nervous to eat that night.
But Banner's already grabbed his hat.  "Night, ma'am," he murmurs to Miss Romanov, and disappears up the stairs.
“Not without you!” Bruce hisses, grabbing her elbow as Thor hits the light switch and the whole place goes dark.
“I wouldn’t mind,” Steve says sheepishly, thinking about how he’d asked Miss Hill to get his coffee just this morning.  “Well, I don’t see that I have much of a choice, but I think I’m in.”
