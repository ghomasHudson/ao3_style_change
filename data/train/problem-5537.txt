He shot a pointed look Natasha's direction, but she just shrugged and said, "It's about time we got some more estrogen up in this bitch."
Tony turned so that he could kiss the top of Steve's head. "Cheer up, old man. Just remember everyone kept telling me you were dead at the time, so, of the two of us, I think you got the better deal."
He shrugged, smiling at him. "Yeah, well," he replied, as though he couldn't find anything better to say.
Tony burst out laughing like he'd just heard the funniest thing in the world, and Steve waited for him to calm down before he added, "I might not say it
"…and I thought, how hard could it be to make waffles?" Steve asked as he capped off his tale later that evening, shrugging as Tony took in the sight of a man that had clearly had an altercation of some sort with a box of pancake flour.
Tony sat back and pulled up the article on his tablet. "Sex, babe, and lots of it. Something about some compound found in semen that helps to soften the cervix or something like that. Oh, also, nipple fondling. I know you're a big fan of that. Says you've got to go at it a while, but I'm pretty sure if there's one thing I
"—nant doesn't mean you have to get married in this day and age. No one will think less of you. I know none of us will."
"Don't mention it," she said with a blasé shrug, but there was a quirk of a smile to her lips, and Tony smiled a little in return and reached out to nudge her a little in solidarity and camaraderie.
Fuck, he couldn't believe how horny he'd been the past several weeks. He wasn't sure he'd make it if this kept up.
Sam nodded at the monitor. "He's over in the atrium with Nat and Potts. Seems to be more interested in whatever's on his phone than whatever Nat and Potts are discussing."
"Good. Because this body is mine. No one else gets you like this. No one else gets to see you like this. No one else gets to have you like this. This is something for me and me alone. No one else can have you, and no one else is going to get their hands on you. I promise."
“How?” Stark asked, smug, sarcastic, a little too cocksure for his own good, lips twisted in that smarmy way he sometimes had about him. “What are you going to do?
"Yeah, don't think he'd be willing to give any of it up — even to you, Brucie. Sorry. Think he's afraid of it falling into the wrong hands. Evidently, he's not wrong to worry about that going by what almost happened to
"Yeah," he'd said with a choked laugh when this realization had first hit him, tears blurring his vision, "you're Steve's all right."
Tony shrugged. "Honestly, you're not wrong. Which is why we use the rest of our lives to make up for that shit."
So, Tony sat on the couch while Steve, at Tony's urging, plopped down on the floor and let Olivia have at the enormous pile of beautifully-wrapped gifts. As Olivia, with Steve's help, ripped at the paper on the first gift, Tony went about slicing and slathering bagels, and he handed one half over to Steve, who smiled and mouthed a quiet, "Thanks," to him then turned his attention back to the toddler, who was now busy trying to yank off the ribbons of a box larger than herself. She lost her balance and went tumbling back onto Steve's legs, and Steve held his breath a moment, fearing she would start screaming, but she just giggled and rolled off of him and got back to her feet before going right back over to the present.
Fuck's sake, they'd be hashing this shit out until long after he and Steve really were dead, wouldn't they? They could be married for forty years, have two kids, half-a-dozen grandkids, and be one of those couples that die within minutes of each other because they couldn't stand to be apart from one another, and these assclowns would
Bruce gave him a knowing look, but he scowled and waved him off then turned his full attention to his daughter.
"Well, it was a stupid dream that has no basis in reality. Hydra wants either of us, they're going to have a fight on their hands, and I've been known to play dirty."
— go again, and I'd be so full of it, so full it would hurt, and you'd make me hold it, make me keep it inside me, like you were trying to mark me, and you wouldn't let me come, and you— and you—"
Steve made another strangled sound in the back of his throat. "Her fingers are just so small, though."
"This," he said and motioned down at himself just as Steve stuck his head under the shower head to wash the remaining soap out of his hair. Steve didn't ask him anything more, and he didn't say anything as Steve ran gentle fingers through his hair, no doubt getting himself soaked in the process. Instead, Tony opened his mouth and let it fill with some water before he sloshed it around and then spit it down toward the drain, doing what he could to rinse out the acrid taste of bile.
"Please," Tony begged in his ear, straddling his hips as he ground their erections together, making Steve moan and shove his head back into his pillow, "
Once the bottle was done warming and he'd judged it not too hot to feed his daughter, he picked her up from her highchair and, baby tucked in one arm and bottle in the other hand, went back into the living room to settle down onto the couch to feed her. As he'd just crossed halfway through the room, stepping aside of bundles of wasted wrapping paper gorgeously-decorated presents, the elevator 'dinged,' and Thor strode off wearing only a white undershirt and a pair of festively-decorated boxers, Mjölnir, of all things, in-hand.
As he stepped back into the hallway, Tony called out after him, "Yeah? Just remember what happened the last time some space nut decided to intervene in our lives!"
"Breathe, honey. Look at me. Breathe. You're not alone. You have me, and you have the team. We're not going to let you fall or get hurt."
"They'll take care of it," he said, though Tony could tell he was attempting to convince himself of the truth of the words as much as he was trying to assure Tony. "But I—" He shrugged. "I guess it's not the worst thing in the world. If you don't mind me hanging around, anyway."
yet — volunteered me, as second-in-command, to talk to Steve about not being so…blunt…in his  assessments."
Natasha watched him motion then gave an easy and blasé shrug. "Don't have to nurse if you don't want to. No one's forcing you to."
" he yelled as they all pinged off various surfaces, and he stared at the board with the few remaining beans — untouched by the tenderizer, of course — and said, "OK, we're going to blame this on me being pregnant and not in my right mind."
Steve nodded, clutching the photo, and Tony patted his arm and said, "Come on. You can buy me dinner now. Hopefully, this kid isn't a vegetarian because we're totally finding a Shake Shack."
Tony must have been pretty far gone with want if he didn't even put up a fight. He just lifted his ass off the bed and let Steve shove a pillow beneath him, and he adjusted himself and preened a little and said, "You think about that a lot, don't you?"
And now some sort of sharpness slid over the mask, and there was an almost dangerous look about him as he said, one eyebrow raised, "Yeah? Well, no offense, but you kind of haven't been around me the last several years, so you're not exactly the best person to ask about it."
Tony eyed him over and hummed a little like he was considering the earnestness of Bruce's words before he said, "Whatever," and pushed away from the table, the lightheadedness having abated. "Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find something to eat before this parasite tries to mutiny or something."
Tony swallowed, trying to read between the lines of her rather poetic words. "So, this is a permanent thing, then? You're not going to change me back? I'm like this forever?"
"He tried to cook for you," Barnes said, his voice a little broken but seeming to possess some amount of strength and awareness to it — a little more so than yesterday, even. "Told 'im it was a bad idea."
But then there was Steve. Poor, darling Steve. Steve didn't get hit, and he didn't get hurt. Steve got something worse than that.
"So, yes, she pulls some shit, and it's only going to get worse the older she gets, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't defend her with every fiber of my being. Not one thing I wouldn't do for that little girl. You'll understand someday."
, but Pepper piped in and said, "She really is an absolute doll of a woman, and she remembers you fondly."
"Evidently," Barnes said, and Natasha made to swat at him again while Tony rolled his eyes. "What?" he asked. "He's been at it a while. You don't see the kid falling out of him, do you?"
"Mmm…let me think about it, yeah? For the moment, I'm going to say yeah, probably, but…I don't know. Let me think about it."
Thor grinned, and he focused his attention on Olivia for a second before he said to Steve, "They are real to the children of Midgard. It is a shame that Midgardians lose their sense of wonder as they age. When you are young, the world is full of possibilities—"
He groaned and rolled his eyes, and DUM-E lowered his arm and went back to rolling the ball of paper on the desk.
"Yeah, well, it's not like we're going to need the girl's name anyway. I think it's more important that we agree on a boy's name."
Steve lifted Olivia out of the highchair and tucked her into his arm, and with one hand, he uncapped the bottle and, after testing a few drops, stuck the nipple of the bottle in Olivia's mouth.
Tony was already there, lying on his side of the bed, on his side, his arms folded in a pout like he thought this was completely stupid but he was humoring Steve regardless. Steve smirked at him before he went around to his side of the bed and climbed in, and he shuffled around a bit before he scooted over and spooned up behind Tony, throwing an arm over his side and another above his head.
He grabbed his joe from the table and took a swig of it, and he padded into the living room and said, "Hey, kiddo. I don't know what you think you're doing over there, but you're going down for a nap now."
Steve thought about this a moment then said, "Sort of. This is a bit... We never had much money to go around. Some years we didn't even have a tree. We never had lights. They were too expensive. When I was really, really young, I can remember one year Ma put candles on the tree, and we had to stand there with a bucket of water and keep a watch over it just in case it went up in flames. And wrapping paper? Forget it! Completely useless and too expensive at that. And I got... I never got much. I remember one year I wanted a Lionel train set. Every kid my age did. But I knew they were expensive, and Ma couldn't afford it, so I, ah, wrote a letter to Santa asking him if he could bring me one because I knew my ma didn't have the money for it. And I asked him to bring something nice for my ma, too, because she deserved it for all the hard work she did."
"Yeah, no, I don't think so. I think you're only saying that because you know there's absolutely no chance of you being in this position, so you can offer to switch places all you want. It's not going to happen. I, however—"
"Yeah, I know. Language. I know. What'd I tell you about hanging on my every word?" He began to search through the cupboards. "I'm sure we've got some herbal brew around here."
"Anyway, who's left?" He frowned and looked at everyone, pointing at each person as he silently mouthed what he'd said about each one then said, "Huh, it's my turn. OK, well,
"But it wasn't anything that wasn't a long time coming!" He pointed the stylus at Bruce again and added, "Incidentally, once that actually hits me, I'm going to go through my cache of liquor pretty quickly, so…"
"There's no way he survived that," Barnes said with a shake of his head. "Not even Steve could have survived that. I know he's— Look, I know Steve's stubborn.
"Yeah," he said and rubbed his hands up and down from Tony's hips to his waist and back again. "Don't get off much, do you, unless it's handheld and vibrates."
Tony stared at the tiny infant cradled in Steve's arm, her eyes focused up on Steve, who was smiling down at her as she slurped on her afternoon bottle. Tony watched father and daughter a moment longer then squinted his eyes as he tried to see, tried to find the similarities, tried to make the comparison between the infant cradled in Steve's arm and the little firebrand that had stumbled into his workshop once upon a time.
"I was mistaken," Thor said, sounding a little too sure for Tony's liking. "I had thought perhaps it was simply a timed spell, but it was not. It was one that has done exactly as was intended."
Steve nodded, slowly, and set the Santa cutter down. "I see," he said, not really sure how to take what Tony was saying.
"No!" Steve defended, loud and firm, perhaps to counter the little voice in the back of his head that said yes. "No, not because... Because, honestly, you're a little possessive of that baby, and sometimes I think I'm not good enough to pick her up."
It was not difficult to see how he had fallen in love with this man. What he felt for Peggy — and he'd known her for a good year-and-a-half now — felt forced in comparison. Oh, he did like Peggy, and he knew, given the time, he could love her, but he didn't even have to try with Tony. He felt more at peace, more at home with himself with Tony than he'd ever felt with anyone. He didn't have to pretend. He had woken up in a world where he didn't have to hide who he was — quite obviously
He nodded. "Yeah. No offense, but I'm not really sure why I'm here with you in 2015 instead of them. Shouldn't I be with them?"
Steve just growled and reached down as though to rip it off of him, but Tony cried out, "No! Don't rip it! I may want to wear this again!"
"Mmm...mortal — human — like the rest of us. You were almost a mythical creature or a legend — like King Arthur or Robin Hood or Paul Bunyan. I mean, I know you and Aunt Peg kind of had a thing for each other, but it was just...hard to picture you as someone's husband or old man — like you were removed from that sort of thing."
of us have actual jobs to do and can't just take off time in the middle of the week to go to a wedding that should have been over and done with six months ago.'"
"Like a fucking lead balloon. Kept insisting Bruce wanted to know and that wasn't something that should be hidden from the guy. I said, yeah, I understand that, honey, but you don't have to be so…
"Even Daddy does. He says it's sack-a-lidges," she said and stuck a piece of waffle in her mouth with her fingers.
Steve opened his mouth to say no, he didn't, but Wilson just continued, "So, where exactly did you get pulled from—Or maybe I should ask
"I won't tell anyone. I promise," Tony said, and Steve looked up at him, not even bothering to hide the tears.
He knew Tony harbored some insecurities about their age gap. Physically, Tony did appear older than he was, and to be honest, Tony did have quite a few more years of lived experience than Steve did. Steve would always and forever consider himself an old man that had taken a very long nap — he supposed like a non-aging Rip Van Winkle — but Tony did have some reason to insist that Steve was his boy-toy and not the other way around.
"Hey, Flo!" Wilson called out to Barnes, who glanced back at him as he tended to his hash browns, a half-confused and half-annoyed look on his face.
Overall, it was a relatively benign affair. Maybe too many were too shocked by what had just transpired or maybe they just didn't believe it, but there was nothing that altered the fabric of reality. He had several more questions shouted at him, and he answered them all with his trademark charm and wit. He even got the assorted journos and photogs to chuckle a few more times.
"No, but I'm pretty sure we've reached a level of intimacy that only Rhodey or Pep or Steve have ever achieved."
"Yeah? That's sweet," Tony muttered as he struggled with the stupid contraption. Pepper grimaced and stood up to help him, but he jerked away and said, "No! I have to learn how to do this myself."
this Tony Stark that he, thankfully, wouldn't be expected to work with. This Tony was a self-described lone gunslinger (Christ, one of
Tony huffed and rolled his eyes. "Seriously?" he asked like he couldn't believe Steve wasn't following his train of thought.
you're going to paint my toenails. I think hotrod red would look nice. You're going to make me a sandwich that would make Dagwood Bumstead come in his pants—"
"I suppose. You can keep your spot as the clan alpha for another day," Tony said while Steve sat down and helped himself to the steak sauce. He smirked a little at Tony's comment but didn't say anything to it, but he did point at Tony's salad and wordlessly implore him to eat it.
"What do we do now Steve?" Bucky knew that they had underestimated Tony too much they needed to work so much faster.
"Fine, it was me I sent it to help Buckeroni." Ouch that was not his best nickname but he was practically shaking having them both here he could barely think. "I don't see how it matters."
"It's okay, I had a feeling anyway." Despite the fact that at one time they were friendly Tony always knew that Clint had certain issues with Tony's wealth. He did tend to make comments regarding Tony being born with money.
After all, they had been allies during his fight with Steve that people were now naming the Civil War.
Vision wasn't blood and bone like Clint and Wanda so for him to still be offline while Clint woke up is more than a little strange. "Was Clint attacked first?"
"Maybe we're getting a little ahead of ourselves, you've only just got here Tony we should have let you settle in and get something to eat before pushing all this on you." Steve said gently.
Never underestimate Tony Stark, it's a mistake that will cost Steve dearly. His plan isn't going as flawlessly as he hoped it would, but then again he always knew that getting Tony on his side wasn't going to be easy.
"Tony I know your work when I see it, T'Challa refused to tell us where it came from and come on, BARF? Only you would make something like that and call it something like that." Steve said inching closer to where Tony was sitting and all Tony could do was pray that he didn't come any closer.
"I did know, I didn't want to come here because I knew you'd never turn your back on us when we needed you. I didn't want to force this on you before you were ready to see me, but Tony I don't think the Avengers will survive long enough to wait until then. I really am sorry I have to do this now, if I could have I would have waited." Steve said and reached out for Tony's hand giving it a light squeeze and Tony isn't sure if his heart skips a beat because he's afraid or because he still loves Steve.
"Tony likes to poke people so he can see how far he can push them before they snap." Natasha explained to Sam with a smirk.
Tony knew he was the only one that could help them, they were listed as was criminals there wasn't a person out there that would be able to help them. Not unless they wanted to be known as accomplices to fugitives. Tony though did have previous ties to Wakanda, it would be slightly strange but not unusual for him to visit the king.
"Did Hawkeye mention anything about the attack?" It made no sense to him, Clint was strong sure but for him to be awake first when he was attacked last made no sense, it suggested that perhaps they went easy on him which isn't a line of thought he really wanted to go down.
Tony never could deny him when he sounded like that, but he wished he could sometimes. But Steve was right they didn't have the luxury of waiting to talk this out, Tony didn't have the luxury of figuring out his feelings and being hurt and... whatever it was he felt. The sooner he figured out who was behind this the sooner he could go back to his normal life, and if they were gonna work together he should at least talk about things with Steve and Bucky right?
"It matters, even after everything you still helped me." Barnes said softly and Tony did look up at him but for once he had no idea what to say.
When they were far enough away that it felt safe to speak Bucky turned to Steve shaking his head. "Jesus Stevie, I know you said he was smart but that was way too close."
"That is true, but at least we're not attacking each other. Plus at this point I'd take any new face." Sam said not taking the bait.
"Steve's right, we can try to do this without you. After everything that we did to you no one would blame you for not wanting to help us." Bucky said coming closer to Tony and Tony couldn't stop himself from feeling a little anxious at having the two of them so close.
"What if the Winter Soldier is like, one of his kids?  And that's why you think the smell is familiar?"
"Tony..." Steve whined his name on instinct, eyes rolling back in his head as he moved to where Tony lead him. He was pliant and responsive to his alpha's touch, cheeks flushed a pretty pink and lips parting. He gasped; a soft sound escaping his lips as Tony's tongue darted out and made him shiver. Made him feel so much. Steve already knew he was getting hard and wet and he could feel Tony's very own arousal rubbing against him. Steve wanted so much things at once. His fingernails scratched at the smooth surface of the floor uselessly as he arched up, letting drag down his jeans, his long legs exposed inch by inch. Sometimes they were so much of himself he wasn't quite what to
He forced himself into a state of exaggerated calm confidence.  Tony had spent his life trying to be the same sort of Alpha his father and Obadiah had been.  Even though he generally felt inadequate, no one else seemed to notice.  Tony was an exceptional actor.  He grinned at the cameras, throwing up peace signs and reaching out to sign photos, occasionally flinging an arm around Steve just so that everyone could get a good look at him.  People expected Tony to be seen with beautiful people, and Steve really was gorgeous.  On top of that, he had the case and everyone loved Iron Man just as much as they loved Tony.  Tony had discovered that the mere presence of any suit component was enough to get the press to cream their pants, and he used it to his advantage as much as possible.
let Barton know.  I personally-- I had no idea.  I personally tried to help him track down Charles Barton.  We had no idea we were being sabotaged. But..." There was a pause.  "It's not Barton I'm worried about. It's Romanoff. Steve. If either of them hears about this, you realize we won't be able to stop them from murdering Gideon Malick?  And that while you and Stark may be famous enough to get away with a hell of a lot... they aren't. You and I have to keep this a secret, because-- because if we don't--"  Phil sounded like he was literally choking on the words.
Tony sipped his shake thoughtfully.  He'd never noticed. He wracked his brain and, yes, sure enough, all the clientele had always been Alphas or the rare beta.  Tony couldn't believe, now, that he'd never noticed. Until Steve, Tony had never spared a glance toward omegas, never given them much thought.  Like poor people or Sokovians, they just weren't part of Tony's life.
He grabbed a small bottle of liquor from the bar on their way to the garage.  He was practically vibrating.  Steve had seen Tony manic plenty of times, but every time was a little unsettling nonetheless.
"Damn it, Stark, he was going to kill himself anyway," snapped Natasha impatiently, eyes darting between Tony and the computer screen in front of her.
He almost felt like he were watching a conversation between mother and child, which was odd. Steve knew Tony was technically a lot older than him, but he didn't often feel like the more mature one.  Tony was looking at Pepper with a hurt expression.
Tony hovered outside Steve's door, unmoving, waiting.  "Yeah, well... it's the truth." He paused. The truth.  "Nick. Can I talk to you?"
It was too late; Tony has gotten up, crossed the room, and laid down on top of Steve protectively, a low growl in his throat.
"Oh hey." Steve smiled on instinct when he heard Tony's voice behind him. He glanced over the back of his shoulder at Tony, blue eyes bright with energy before he turned back and put the weight down easily. His hair was a little damp and stuck to his forehead.  "Sorry I left you, but I figured you needed to sleep," Steve murmured and ran a hand over his face before pushing his hair up. "And I have to get back into a routine." He needed to get back into his rhythm again- back when he'd been running with Sam every day and then training with Nat in the afternoons. He also wanted to make time for Tony too; he was a big part of his life. Steve was going to work training around his Alpha; his schedule was flexible. His bond wasn't.
Steve's shoulder tensed suddenly under Tony's hand.  Tony knew why. He squeezed reassuringly. "...this looks really good, Steve.  It's awesome. Seriously," he said.
"Something that will surprise me?" Steve suggested with a soft smile and pushed himself up onto his elbow so he could see Tony's face. "I don't know. I've never really done presents. I'm not very materialistic. I'd rather have a home-cooked meal than something flashy." It felt funny to say it, but it was true.
It was a scary thought...what was he going to do now? He thought about the eighty-four omega conversion camps out there and what had happened to Ty-- no.  Nott now. Not today. Steve could afford distractions for a day.
He was glad Steve was feeling fulfilled, but he thought about the mission with dread.  He wasn't a soldier. Wasn't an assassin or spy or... whatever the fuck Fury was. Tony was a businessman who'd taken to wearing a suit of armor for fun.  And it was great fun, because he was invincible in it, and because he didn't care about his own well-being very much. But having someone he cared about, someone made of very mortal flesh instead of a gold-titanium-samarium alloy... that was different.  He didn't want people shooting at Steve and he didn't like how eager Steve seemed to be to be shot at.
"Alrighty," said Richard, who was between Donner's legs and couldn't have been more disinterested or submissive at the moment.  "Well, Donnie. You're fully dilated. You're just about there."
"Captain.  You're obviously not thinking very clearly."  Rumlow's voice dropped so that it was quiet. "You're in preheat and you're emotional.  You need to come with me. You can't just sit out here; people are noticing. And if you lash out, you could hurt someone.  Come on, I'm on a STRIKE team with Agent Romanov. You can trust me." He gave Steve a very gentle tug, them repeated, "It's not just for your safety or for the safety of your image, Captain.  It's for the safety of the people. You've already got about a dozen civilian onlookers, and you're going to attract some Alphas."
Gail recovered from the shock and leaned into the microphone with a smile.  "Well, ladies and gentlemen, good news! We weeded out the bad ones for you already, so all the rest up here are
Steve frowned and stepped out into the darkness. He took another step, listening intently. The blue, ghoulish light didn't stretch far enough to sit. The floor beneath them felt cool - almost like Steve were walking on water. He turned his head, focused on the sounds around him. He could hear 'Steve's' breathing, and his own, but that was it.
"...a triangular cross-section with the face plates soldered together and secured by a C-shaped binding strip," the docent was saying.
"...yeah.  I miss it too.  But it won't be the same, you know.  It'll feel different for both of us. And... and I'm worried it's going to burn you," said Tony.  "I don't want to hurt you and... and what if you have a flashback or something?" Supposedly, being force-bonded was extremely traumatic.  Although Steve hadn't seemed too fucked up from it. Maybe because he didn't even remember. Or maybe because it was Bucky.
Tony stood up and put a hand on Steve's shoulder, unhappily noting that Steve was taller.  "Steve." His voice was stern. "Sit down."
He glanced up to the clock on the wall. "We have twenty five minutes until we need to leave," Steve said, brain accessing quickly. They had time. Just...if they were quick about. He smirked subtly, a mischievous glint in his eyes.
When they landed it was early morning and the first thing Tony noticed was that it was overcast, drizzling, and horribly cold.  Well, in the forties, which he, a long-time resident of Malibu, considered uninhabitable. He tugged his coat on, grumbling.
"--and there was an omega who was angry at her Alpha for distancing himself.  She said she couldn't feel him anymore. Alphas should always be able to feel their omegas."  Bucky's eyes glazed over a little. "But I couldn't. After we got captured at Azzano, he took us and he injected us and I got sick.  And I stopped feeling him. I thought he was dead. Then he came for me. And I was happy. And then I saw the mark was gone. I thought it was that stuff they gave him to make him bigger.  But I couldn't feel him anymore. I was empty." His stormy grey eyes refocused on Wanda's. "...I fixed the mark. I bonded him. But I can't feel him very well."
A few of the regular omegas were watching this discussion; Waffles suddenly blurted, "You're dangerous."  He was talking about Steve. "You're going to get us all Trickshotted!"
Steve curled into his touch, tucking his head under Tony's jaw and against his shoulder. It was their usual position and allowed Steve to pretend he wasn't taller for a brief space of time. It was oddly comforting. He could practically hear Tony's thoughts. The man never turned his brain off but Steve could tell when his Alpha was getting lost in his own head.
He didn't say it but didn't have to.  Tony was borderline feral and had been since attacking Malick.
"You'd have to have multiple hostels," Phil pointed out. "That's too many kids to fit in one place. And they're scattered all over. Would be hard to make a single hostel accessible to everyone."
"They told me I was probably infertile from the ice, too screwed up. That I wouldn't have heats, so I didn't need to worry- and suppressants wouldn't work on my metabolism anyway.  Look, I didn't mean to have a heat, I thought-- and I'm not supposed to goddamn kneel for anyone!  I'm Captain America!  Jesus Christ." Steve ran a hand over his face.
He squinted at the photos on the fridge.  One of Steve and Natasha, Natasha looking deadly but a hint of a smile in her eyes.  One of Steve giving a cheeky thumbs-up next to his own gravesite.  One of Natasha and Clint giving each other bunny ears in front of the Washington Monument.  Clearly, Steve and the other Avengers were more than just work friends.
It was important to him to give kids like James a chance when he hadn't gotten one. It was as if that made it all okay... that it had been worth it, going through all that shit, to get here so James didn't have to.
He gave himself a few yanks but it was hopeless.  Accidentally objectifying Steve after everything that had just happened made him feel like the lowest piece of shit on the planet.
"We should get you back in on the simulator," Sitwell mused, half to himself. "It might help us...work things out."
"So he's ninety-two?  Awesome," said Tony.  A look of realization crossed his face; his eyes widened.  "Wait a second.  You were born on Independence Day?
An hour passed. It was tense and stressful. Natasha had her safe houses checked (the ones that Steve knew about in the area, anyway), but there was nothing. SHIELD intel had nothing either. She'd trained him too well.  That, or it was the Winter Soldier's skills.  Perhaps a deadly combination of both.
Kate crossed her arms over her chest and narrowed her eyes at Tony. "Drop the omega and let me do my work or I swear to
.  We won't be leaving the premises, we're just going to my other residence, we'll just change houses... come on, there's not even a Christmas tree here, there's no snow or anything.  Pierce wouldn't want to ruin our first Christmas together, would he?"
"It's because of my line of work. It doesn't...mean anything..." Steve let out a quiet sound of approval as Tony's fingers rubbed shampoo onto his scalp. He was still too good with his hands. He blushed at the compliment, but the steam from the shower meant his skin already had a pink tinge to it. He whined low in his throat and quiet as Tony massaged at his shoulders, easing away all the stress after talking about Fury.
Tony let out a small noise of protest; Pepper ignored him, handing Steve a tablet and a couple of folders.
Steve noticed Tony winced but didn’t comment on it.  He stored the concern away to check up on later.  “...most of us,” Steve agreed quietly.  “But not all of us.”  Certainly not in all countries.  Still.  It was nothing compared to the forties.  The forties had been hell, especially for someone as sickly as him.  Luckily, though, Steve had usually been too sick to even have heats.  His body just hadn’t had the energy.  And even then, when things got tough, he’d always had Bucky. But it wouldn’t do Steve any good to think of him now, a man seventy years dead.
What it meant was that Cap and Tony Stark were the most disgustingly saccharine couple he'd ever in any way borne witness to, and he was starting to develop diabetes from their cuteness. God, he could even see that exchange in his mind. Goofy smiles, soft voices, and probably ending with a kiss.
"Evidently not," Bruce muttered, and Tony and Rhodey turned their attentions to him. He looked between them and chewed his bite of waffle. "The butter," he clarified around a mouthful of food. "Tastes really good."
Was he in the Alps? Somewhere in Switzerland? Austria? Germany? Italy? He had to still be in Europe, no matter how good Tony's English was or how good the English was in the movie on that rectangular wall screen. He scooped up the little girl into his arms again, ignoring her whines as she reached out for the gifts under the tree, smacking him in the face with the colorful plush toy in her hands, and went over to a bookcase on the other side of the room. She began to babble in his arms, and Steve rubbed her back in an attempt to quiet her and turned his attention to the books on the shelves, most of which seemed to be titles having to do with history or…engineering, he'd guess. Some literature, but very little. He took another look around the room, and again, it seemed odd that
He stared at Steve a moment, seeing the twinkle of challenge in those blue eyes of his, and knowing that deciding between those two names would be as much of a dead end as deciding between 'Sarah' and 'Maria,' he did as Steve suggested, closing his eyes and fanning through the pages before he stopped and pointed to a part of the page at random.
Tony heaved out a breath. "Yeah, I guess so," he said and looked up at Steve. "Kind of think it's amazing either one of us had the nerve to actually say anything."
"Wow," Tony said, impressed to hell with Steve's effort. "I actually feel a little embarrassed here."
Steve stayed quiet a moment before he nodded and gave Tony's arm a gentle squeeze. "I know," he said. "I know all that. I just—"
He watched as Steve swallowed, his Adam's apple bobbing up and down, and his jaw did that clenching thing it did when he was tensed up and wasn't quite sure how to expel that tension.
"Steven, my friend!" he boomed, a broad smile on his face, his hair somehow neat and kempt even from just waking. "A joyous and merry Christmas to you and yours!"
The elevator door opened, and Bruce called out, "Hey, Tony, I was talking with Dr. Foster, and I think I might have something—"
He came, tremors running through him in areas he still wasn't used to, gasping lightly lest anyone overhear and think he was in distress. God, if this was the way things were going to be until the end of this pregnancy, he wasn't sure he'd be able to handle it. There was being horny and there was needing to be fucked silly. He wasn't sure even Steve had the stamina for the latter.
Tony huffed and sighed, and he grabbed his underwear and his shorts and slid them back on. "Yeah, I'm not letting you go down there yourself. It'll be nothing, but you'll still be gone for hours because something
Steve really didn't know what to say to that, so he just said, "And what about…?" and nodded in the direction of the nursery upstairs. "I mean her name...?"
Steve shot a smile at him and went back to inspecting the television. "I'm going to pretend I understood half of those words."
"All right, Tony," she said and smiled at him, and again, Tony suspected it was intended to comfort and put them at ease, but Tony felt nothing short of jittery and couldn't in any way sit still.
"Round six-hundred-and-sixteen of the pissing match," Tony said and picked up his glass to take a sip of the watered-down concoction through the little red swizzle stick. He swallowed down the taste and smacked his lips then said a breezy, "Come to apologize?"
Steve moved his hand from Tony's hair to cover Tony's mouth. "Don't even. You're a good person, Tony. Maybe you haven't always done good things, but you're a good person."
"They were friends that tried to make a romantic relationship work but realized they were better off as friends."
Steve sighed a little and murmured, "How am I going to get you to believe me?" though it sounded like he was more asking himself than Tony, and that was the moment JARVIS asked, "
"Nah," Wilson said, still watching things through his phone, "we'll allow it this time. We'll need it for the highlight reel for your fiftieth."
Pepper pinched the bridge of her nose, and Tony all but threw his hands up in the air in defeat, but Bruce just said "Uh, I don't think so. Your Daddy has to stay down here and have a talk with…Pepper."
Steve didn't know why he did it — or maybe some deep-down part of him did — but underneath the table, he slid his right foot over to Tony and rubbed his foot against Tony's. Tony seemed perplexed at first, frowning and cocking his head, before knowing spread over his face, and he murmured, "Playing footsie with me, are we, Captain?"
"Don't have to," Tony said quickly. "Don't— Look, this isn't a game of one-upmanship. This isn't a pissing contest. I'm not going to sit here and say it didn't hurt and I don't still struggle with the fact that my parents were murdered, but I can't change the past any more than you can. And I know you'd like to. I know you'd like to undo what you've done. Nat calls it having red in her ledger. The only way you can wipe it out is by doing the most good you can and avenging the ones that need it the most."
"How do I feel?" he asked, struggling to his feet, his joints cracking and something throbbing in his knee, but that was fine, whatever. That was his voice. That was
Tony frowned at him and was about to tell him he didn't have to do this, he didn't have to go back to them — they could fix this,
Steve nodded again and squeezed the hand on Tony's knee just a little bit tighter, Tony squeezing right on back.
He stopped talking, suddenly realizing what an asshole he sounded like. Cap hadn't even been the one to bring up Howard. Come to think of it, Cap almost never mentioned him. Only once in the time they'd known each other, and even then, only in passing.
"—but do we actually possess the technology to even begin to try to figure out where she comes from never mind
Bruce shrugged and took another bite of pizza. Tony figured he was just stalling for time, so he grabbed his own slice and shoved half of it in his mouth, grease running down his chin and his fingers. He saw Rhodey making a face at him out of the corner of his eye, and he raised his eyebrow at him as though to ask,
exactly did this happen again?" Barnes asked and looked between Steve and Tony, still sounding confused as fuck. Poor bastard.
that came with him as well — as though Steve's place was with this man wherever that might be. His mind again postulated that perhaps this wasn't some nefarious Hydra plot after all. Maybe Tony was telling the truth. Maybe he had somehow woken up in the future, and future-him was married to Tony and they had a daughter and a house upstate. How he'd even got to the future was anyone's guess, but would it really be the weirdest thing he'd ever seen? It could happen. It wasn't just that he
Tony just reached up and began to smooth back the soft wisps of bangs from the kid's head. He didn't know why he was doing it, but it seemed an almost…natural motion to him.
He pulled away, maybe a little sheepish, and he met Steve's gaze then glanced to the baby on Steve's shoulder and said, "Yeah, maybe we should watch what we do around her?"
That was when he heard the voices — or maybe 'voice' was the better term. Willing himself to forget about his pain, if just for the moment, he took two difficult steps to the right and looked around the furthest support pillar over to where the fire exit was. He saw Barnes standing there, nervous, face scrunched in a mental sort of anguish, finger on the trigger but somehow unable to squeeze it. There was what Tony took to be a Hydra agent facing off with him, and he took several calming breaths and made slow, measured steps over, hands still at the ready as he listened in to what they were saying.
Olivia just scoffed as Tony ushered her onto the car. "No, he can't! Friday can do everything. Jarbus can't even call me the right name!"
"Oh," she said, brightly, smiling. She turned to Tony, and she held her hand out and said, "I don't believe we've met. Ella Greenburg."
It wasn't. As it turned out, he needed shoes, which they picked up at the same department store (white again; good god, was this a joke?), and then he needed the proverbial old, new, borrowed, and blue. The 'new' constituted the dress; the 'old' was a birdcage veil that Hill had produced from…somewhere; he figured it was best not to ask from where; the 'borrowed' was a pendant necklace from Natasha; the 'blue' was the stupid and cliché garter.
" But instead, Tony just did as he was told, sitting up on his knees as Steve got up with him and then maneuvered him into position, Tony leaning against the headboard, legs spread, and Steve pressed up behind him. He gasped when Steve stuck his fingers inside of him, stroking him, dragging slickened fingers up to his clit, and Steve, naked faster than Tony had ever seen him, pressed up tight against Tony and all but growled into his ear, "Good
He shrugged. "I don't know. Maybe Esmeralda will show up in the nick of time and say, 'OK, you've done what you needed to do,' and snap her fingers and poof! I'm back to normal."
Barnes still seemed a bit unsure, but as Tony carefully cradled Olivia so as to hand her over, Barnes cradled his arms, and satisfied that Barnes had enough control of the situation that he wouldn't accidentally drop her, he placed her in his covered metal arm, which allowed him to reach up and stroke her cheek with his flesh-and-blood fingertip.
But Steve shook his head a little and said, "Not sure I want to imagine what might have happened to Buck had you not."
Tony went to open his mouth to respond, but he blanked at the last moment on the answer and, instead, glanced back to Steve, who just shot him a look that could only be read as
"You're like a child sometimes," Bruce muttered. "Steve isn't here, and I can't carry you up the stairs, so, Thor, if you'd do the honors?"
"There's always the Mets," Tony offered with a shrug, but Steve looked upon him like Tony had, well, insulted his firstborn.
"It's official.  I turned in my retirement, and twisted some arms, and this fall, the show is yours," said Boswell.  He checked his watch; it was past midnight. "Happy birthday," he added gruffly.
"Fuck!" he squawked at the crimson liquid blooming in his palm.  He sucked on the cut, looking around for a pair of car keys.
Across the room, Steve was shaking President Ellis's hand.  "Thank you so much for the invitation; it's been lovely. The food was unlike anything else I've ever tasted," Steve said honestly. Ellis's smile was warm; he really wanted this to work out well. He probably wouldn't be impressed when the election came around and it turned out Steve was probably voting democratic but they didn't need to talk about such things now. Cooperation would work in everyone's favor.
him.  He needed someone he could trust to be there for him before he faced what had just happened and then melted down.  Because he felt like if he didn't have some sort of anchor, he'd start screaming and screaming and never, ever be able to stop.  He was teetering on the edge of a precipice, on the brink of ferality.  He'd heard of Alphas going crazy; now he understood.  For a brief and beautiful moment, a singular glistening moment of time, Tony had been happy.  Then it had been ripped away from him and he was left empty and broken.
"I know, but I'm a renegade like that," said Tony breezily, pulling out his phone.  "I'm going to go make a quick call... can you make sure Steve doesn't--"
He sat on the floor of the shower and crossed his arms, pouting.  Tony had a remarkable ability to use passive resistance to get what he wanted.  Steve had witnessed him do things like this with Pepper all the time.
The dog walked over to Steve, having finished licking the floor, and set his chin on Steve's knee, looking up at him lovingly, clearly hoping for more toast.
Then again, being alone meant valuable shop time.  The suit needed work.  And he knew Steve could handle himself.
He spotted Hal's friend, Abby, chatting animatedly with a sandy-haired boy who was smiling nervously next to the girl Piper was talking to.  Without Eric around, Piper, as usual, had perked up, and she and the other girl seemed like they were getting along very well.
, Steve, but it doesn't affect how I'm going to approach working with you.  Seriously, Steve. This is a big deal, sure, but also not my business. I think coming out with it as soon as possible is sensible, personally. Scarves really don't suit you."
"Steve?  You still in there?  ...you're not mad at me for shutting you off, right?" asked Tony.  "Sorry, I just hate emotional talks. I'd rather just have angry sex.  That's sort of my go-to method for dealing with negative feelings."
"I'll get back to you before December," Gleason promised. He offered a small wave and then he was off, seeing himself out of the door.
"It's a pity the Winter Soldier's already left.  You just missed him. But I'm sure you two will get to catch up soon, especially if you insist on coming to us.  It's actually easier this way, really..."
Steve, in his undershirt, attracted more attention than he would normally be comfortable with.  Surprisingly, it was generally not negative. The omegas were fascinated by him, and even the older ones were curious; they wanted to know what it was like to be a tall omega, a strong omega, how his bond worked, if he could have or wanted children, what he was like before the serum, what it was like fighting a war.
"Er-- well.  It's pretty late.  Are we all spending the night?" asked Banksy, who didn't look a bit tired but knew when to throw in the towel.
Pepper sighed fondly. "Those kind of Alphas. They're a different breed. You're going to put in a whole room full of Malicks, where no one respects you as a person, Steve."
"Maybe someday," said Steve, staring at George's little flat where he and Luke had once lived.  "...maybe someday."
"Steve? Steve, buddy?   You okay?" Lola poked Steve, who looked like he was frozen in time. His left eye twitched. He felt.. oddly powerless. Steve was strong, agile, an expert tactician. And yet he was lost here. He was useless. Steve couldn't change these people. He couldn't make them see that betting with your own omega's life was fucked up, or that a public bonding made every single person in that goddamn room complicit. He felt like he was going to be sick. He felt like he was curled up in the bathroom all over again with Bucky yelling through the door, saying what Steve knew were well-meaning lies.
"Okay.  We'll call you Doug, then," said Tony firmly.  He looked up at Steve. Steve looked concerned.
Kate started prodding Steve's ribs, he winced. "And we have... I'm guessing four broken ribs. You were thrown against a wall huh? By one of those?" She nodded to Tony and his suit.
"--Bucky," said Tony hoarsely.  He could feel bile rising up in his throat.  He might throw up, after all.
?  Oh my God, Tony, the world doesn't revolve around you!  You want to know what the difference is between you and Happy?  Happy
He grabbed a glass of water from the bedside and dumped it over Steve's head; Steve shook himself out, sputtering.
..." he gasped as he twitched on top of the blond.  He had the presence of mind to reach down to fondle Steve's balls, stroke his length; Tony had always been a selfish lover but things with Steve felt different.  What they were doing felt... intimate.
He and Happy flung open their doors at the same time and Tony dragged Steve out of the car after him.  The effect of Tony's appearance was immediate; the crowd swamped him with shrieks of excitement, asking for autographs, chanting about Iron Man, shoving microphones in his face; Tony was laughing, waving, jostling good-naturedly into the crowd as Happy shoulders away the worst of it, and Steve suddenly understood the sunglasses; a lot of cameras were going off.
Steve opened the window and Tony was glad he was wearing the helmet, glad Steve couldn't see his face, because Tony felt like he might cry.   He felt so much affection toward Steve.  He could still smell his post-heat.
He frowned at the mention of Natasha.  "I don't speak Russian," he informed Steve with a hint of annoyance.  "She giving you private lessons?  ...is she aware that
"Bucky Barnes," repeated Tony, testing the words out.  Still kind of a dumb name.  "...It's obvious, right?  He's still guilty about the guy's death.  Which isn't fair, at all, because... because you tried to save him, right?" said Tony, holding Steve's hands in his.  "War sucks, right?  Not your fault.  Whadda they call it, uh... survivor's guilt- yeah!  Kind of obvious that he'd think back to that.... That's why you didn't want to talk about him, right?"
"--the cloaca is self-cleaning so, Alphas, don't douche your omega.  Omegas, don't let your Alphas douche you. And ladies, the same goes for your naughty bits.  No douching. Very unhealthy. Now-- next diagram, Rex--
"Hey, Steve?  ...I know you guys all have a lot to catch up on, but... I wanna... y'know, spend time with you.  You wanna go hang out on the pool deck for a while? ...just us?" asked Tony quietly. Pepper, Aria, Jeff, Boswell, and Banksy were comparing notes for Friday, while Brent was talking about the babies to Tiberius, who had the same gooey look on his face as Pepper had while she was holding the baby.  Tony still didn't get it. Fortunately, he assumed if Steve kicked out the babies' handlers, then the babies would also be leaving.
to make him better in every way- it was a perfectly logical side-effect. But Steve still couldn't shake away the self-consciousness that come with being underweight and ill for most of his life. He was still the little guy inside. He might have had the looks now but he didn't really have the swagger to go with them.
He remembered where Tony's bedroom was but still walked slowly, eyes on his Alpha almost the whole time. When they reached a door Steve lifted his leg up effortlessly and opened it with his foot on the handle before he carried them on through.
"Hi, Mr. Stark?  John Jameson." The man stuck a hand out.  He was extremely dominant; he had a brash New York accent, Queens, Tony suspected.  He had a mustache and pepper-grey hair cut in a style that implied he might, at some point, have been a marine.  There was an unlit cigar in his mouth and, between that and the mustache, Tony was strongly reminded of his father, even though they didn't look very similar.  Maybe it was the dominance thing. John's aura shut both Tony and Malick down in an instant. His was a incredibly powerful, aggressive bearing. "My girls here wanted to meet your omega.  They're fans."
Tony had no reply to any of this.  He was pretty sure you couldn't change a person's status, but then again, there were certainly plenty of omegas who overdosed themselves on suppressants and tried to pass as betas.  And some were successful. And their lives were probably easier for it.
He wasn't aware he was remembering until morning.  He'd been sitting in the bed, head in his hands, making a keening noise.  He looked up; light was coming in through the window. He could still feel weird pangs of arousal, and he didn't know why, and they were so intricately mixed with guilt that he could hardly stand it.  He pressed his forehead against the window with a groan of misery. He didn't understand. That was the worst part. He didn't understand these memories or these feelings. They were foreign, without context, but they haunted him like ghosts.
Tony decided to ignore that and focus on Steve's last statement.  "Sure. I want you in the bed. But you don't have to, okay? Steve, I'm always gonna want you.  The one time I thought I didn't, in January... that was a mistake. I don't know what it's like for you.  But for me, your scent, it... kind of makes me crazy, you know? I'll always want you in the bed."
Gideon laughed, the sound rumbling up from deep in his throat. "You've been spending too much time around Romanoff, I see."
"Call Gleason," Aria murmured to Pepper with sudden urgency as she sank back down onto the heels of her feet. "Pep, call him now."
Tony remembered the smile on his father's face when he spoke to the real Jarvis.  How the two of them had gazed adoringly at each other on the film that was now burned to ashes in his basement.  How, for just a brief moment in time, he'd felt that from Steve.
But the blond was offering him something (information?) with no clear motive.  The soldier had not been ordered to kill him. He'd been ordered to take him alive and he had.  The objective was complete. He could not compromise the mission; the mission was over.
Tony flopped onto a stool and put his elbows on the counter without looking at Steve.  "Who's coming?" he demanded.
"Till the end of the line, yeah," Steve said, his eyes glazing over a little with the threat of tears. He swallowed down the lump in his throat but didn't dare look aware from Bucky, as if he might lose him if he broke their gaze. "I thought I lost you twice. Turns out both times I was wrong. I'm so sorry I left you down there in that ravine; I'll never forgive myself for that, Buck..."
"No," said Tony, hoarsely.  Most of his answers over the last week had been monosyllabic.  Steve's name had become a forbidden word; he was simply "him."
Steve's body wanted his other Alpha.  His more powerful, dominant Alpha. Bucky, even-attuned to Steve, had woken up because of Steve's heat.
his mate was bursting into dinners covered in blood saying that Barnes was alive and their baby was dead, and it wasn't supposed to be like this at all, they were supposed to be safe, Vanko was dead now, they were supposed to be in a stable fucking relationship and this wasn't stable at all.
He turned around. He could still hear DeSoto shuffling about in the living room. "You won him for the night. The nights over. What the hell is he still doing here?"
Aria continued to ignore Tony.  On her phone, there were six calls from Clint already.  Clearly, he'd been spooked by Tony's text about his having a family and wanted to figure out what was going on from Steve.
"Can I look yet?  You're not unpacking everything, are you?  I want my gift," said Tony stubbornly; he could still hear quiet movements from Steve and he wondered if Steve was drawing this part out on purpose.  If he was, then he had no right to tell Tony to keep his expectations down, because every second of anticipation gave Tony more than enough time to picture every crazy thing imaginable, from Steve having a tattoo on his ass to Donner popping out of one of the suitcases or something.
The man was staring at him, and Donner looked down to the floor respectfully.  He wasn't supposed to look Alphas in the eye, and he was a
Steve laughed weakly at that, warmed at Tony's attempt at humor. He slid down into his touch and leaned his head on his Alpha's shoulder. "It's actually pretty hard to pee on.  The stick's so little.  No goddamn clue how girls manage it." He fell quiet after that. Steve just focused on keeping his breathing even and steady whilst his gaze remained fixed on tiny stick in his hand.
was in trouble for having a crush while Steve was off gallivanting with his other Alpha?  Was Tony just supposed to be okay with Steve having Bucky on the side like this?
"Shit. Sorry." Steve frowned a little. The last thing he wanted to do was make Tony feel uncomfortable. To Steve, the arc reactor was beautiful. It was Tony's own creation, proof of his genius and creativity. And not only that, but proof of his endurance, too. Tony wouldn't be alive without it. He resisted the urge to lean forward and trace his tongue and lips around the rim, knowing it would make Tony shiver.
Steve tucked his phone into his back pocket and then left his hotel room without a second glance, going to take the stairs up to the roof. But when he stepped into the stairwell he heard a voice he recognised. The woman, the witch, who'd made their minds swap.
Most of the conversation had been muffled by the door but Tony and DeSoto heard the last part loud and clear.  Steve sounded like he had gotten fairly worked up.
When Tony began licking at him, mouthing at where he was stretched over the toy, Steve cried out, his whole body going tense as he trembled with a sweet kind of pleasure. "Fuck. Tony. O-oh my God.  Fuck, yes, fuck--"  When Tony pressed the knot in, too, Steve practically wailed, his cock hard and leaking against his abdomen. He whimpered loudly, his blue eyes glazed over and focused on nothing. Steve rocked back on the toy with small undulations of his hips. "A-alpha...please..."
Steve had lingered too long.  The girl was pointing at him and pulling at her 'mother's' arm.  Tired of being ignored, she tottered over to Steve.
"Easy boy. Drink." Aria said and shoved another glass in his face. Steve drank it slowly this time. Downing it had made him feel queasy before.
"You have very interesting friends, Captain," Gleason said. Even in a preheat, it seemed Clint was eccentric.
"Well, she hasn't got an Alpha, if that's what you mean," said George.  "I'm afraid she was bonded during her last heat by some boy at her current school.  But she's really a model omega, and even though she's already marked, she'd be an excellent addition to any household."
Sam nodded. "Sure thing pal." He disappeared to go grab both those things, going to pick up sandwiches too for good measure.
Tony reached out gently to take his sketchbook and set it gently on the beside table, where it wouldn't get damaged.  Steve had rolled onto Tony's papers when he'd reacted to Tony's lunge, but it didn't matter if they got a little crumpled; when they got home, Tony could have them digitized anyway.
"Okay, America the Beautiful... hands on the bed," commanded Tony, still touching himself.  Steve's cheeks were tinged pink but he also looked thoroughly pleased with himself for getting Tony so wound up.
good.  Steve, you're the best guy I ever met.  All the stuff you stand for, the other omegas you try to help, the whole... all-American justice and equality thing... you're so good.  You're such a good boy..."
"Mr. Stark, Captain Rogers. My name is Agent Mackenzie; it's a pleasure to finally meet both of you."
"Who are you?" Steve asked. The soldier's reply was muffled by the glass; it was hard to make out. But Steve was pretty sure he got the gist of it.
Steve felt his heart break a little. "Because I was trying to get him to say what he did, to show you what an asshole Gideon is. That you deserve better. It was a weird and creepy conversation, and I didn't want to have it. And, by the way, Gideon still thinks he can orchestrate this to get what he wants. He tried to call this morning and he left a message. He's still prepared to give you up for one night with someone else Donner."
Steve's phone rang in Rumlow's hand; he silenced it immediately.  Steve's eyes were still unfocused and unseeing. Rumlow patted his arm again.  Steve was clearly tense, probably from feeling vulnerable, but Rumlow was relying on his natural charm to calm the omega.  He had very specific orders. "Don't worry, Captain. We're taking you somewhere safe," he promised.
"Did you say you want a smoke?" Kerry said, offering out a packet of cigarettes. "I'm just about to take one outside."
"Steve," said Tony hoarsely to the back of the couch.  "Can you leave your sweatshirt, though?  Please?"  Tony wanted that smell now.  That smell that was supposed to mean comfort and home.  He just wanted to lie on the couch and smell Steve's sweatshirt and try not to think too hard about what it was that he had almost had and then lost.
The week passed quickly after that. Steve did one out of three of his army base speeches. He'd felt weird dressing up in 'Cap' uniform again, almost like an impostor... but it was what the graduates wanted to see. And once Steve was there with them, it was almost like he'd never left. The crowd was all betas and Alphas, and he was used to that. Back in the forties he could go a months without seeing a single omega at all. It was war and it appeared they had just... vanished. When Steve had gotten home after the speech he'd stripped the uniform right off and hung it up perfectly at the back of the closet, making sure there were no creases, aware he'd need it again for the next speech.
Steve slipped out of bed, heading downstairs to grab some juice. He spun around as he opened the fridge.
"...Steve, about Bucky... I'm sure... look, he's fine.  They can sedate him and... and he's too far gone to know what's happening anyway," offered Tony awkwardly.  "He'll go back to sleep when this is over and probably not even remember. Let's just get through this, okay?  I won't... I won't leave you again. You mean too much to me."
"...I also worked on getting Rhodey a good bodycam.  One word, Steve: contact lens. Wait, no, two words. Anyways, my idea is to put a chip on a contact lens and have it transmit whatever he sees to us in real time.  It'll be like we're there!"
It wasn't okay.  The idea of Steve losing his virginity to some other Alpha was revolting.  The idea of Stark with his paws all over Steve made Bucky feel sick.  The idea of another Alpha trying to bite over his mark felt like a very personal violation.
"Hi, guys," called Tony.  "Natasha!  How's my second-favorite redhead?  ...didja send us an orchid yet?"
" exploded Tony the second they were in the car.  The last time Steve had heard Tony use that sort of tone, it was it exclaim that someone didn't like cheesecake.  Tony clearly thought the king was insane for not wanting Iron Man. "It's
Tony disagreed but he thought it would be rude to say so in front of Steve, who was still grinning like a loon over the pictures.
He felt at least a little better having read the files of Steve and Nat and Clint and Coulson and a few others.  It had been interesting, if not a little confusing.
The foyer was as disappointing to Tony as the outside of the place.  It had tile floors, a tall ceiling, some bland oilpaint landscapes on the wall.  There were two wooden doors with windows on either side of them, one with a plaque declaring it OFFICE and another with a plaque declaring it HEADMASTER.  There was a short wing that went left, and a longer one that went right, and right in front of them was another heavy wooden door labeled CHAPEL that had opaque stained glass windows on either side of it, emphasizing the feeling of a private religious school.
"Beats me, Tony," said Tiberus wearily.  "He lasted for five years at Boulder Hill, so clearly, he's a fighter.  I can't exactly call up Zephyr Hill and ask about him, can I? Anyway, we don't know if he's still Bullseye or if they would have renamed him.  The trail ran dry at Zephyr Hill. But I think there's a chance and that's certainly better than no chance."
From under the water Steve reached up a hand, the backs of his fingers grazing over Tony's cheek. "I love you," he whispered, voice trembling a little until he let his eyes slip shut as he just savored the sensation of the water. It was probably around one in the morning but Steve had truly lost all sense of time.
Then again, lately, Tony had been hauling around helmets and gauntlets and things to work, as if convinced he might get kidnapped again.  It had only been two years since his ordeal.
There was a pause, then Fury said, "...no, there's no SHIELD activity in southern California right now.  There's one STRIKE team that was deployed directly by WSC but since they bypassed SHIELD, I assume that must be an international incident, outside our jurisdiction."
"...Tony?  ...I can barely hear you, I think we have a bad connection.  Is it true you're at the AU convention? You're pissing off a lot of your fanbase.  What can I do for you?" asked David pleasantly, without any hint of judgement.
"You know you sound like an evil madman, right?" asked Tony.  "I mean, you don't live in like, an active volcano or something, do you?"
MAJOR CONTENT WARNING FOR THIS CHAPTER.  I don't want to give spoilers to our tiny but dedicated fanbase, but I want to warn you that Steve gets hurt in this chapter and there is some medical/physical trauma.  THIS IS ABOUT AS BAD AS IT GETS.  The angst machine is going full-tilt and we offer no apologies.  You have been warned.  - T
, Steve.  Ceramic-carbon brakes.  Sixty to zero in thirty meters... you pull about two G's if you brake this bad boy all the way.  You can get it up to 150 in ten seconds!"
Steve was a little self-conscious about photos being taken but he also could never tell what people were doing on their phones.  Maybe the clicking noises weren't a camera shutter.  Maybe they were just playing... what was it? Candy crash?
"Huh." Steve processed the information curiously. His mind drifted a little. He knew Tony's securities were rooted in a lot of issues, some of them relating to Howard. But it didn't help that Steve was a super soldier, who was kind of huge and made of muscle and intimidating to most Alphas out there.
"So I, uh, I gotta go to New York in two weeks," said Tony, examining his neck closely in the mirror for any spots he might have missed.  Tony often got micro-focused on whatever little task he was doing when he had to say something serious. The more casually Tony mentioned something, often, the more serious it was.
The way Tony was looking at him was overwhelming. Steve felt something seize in his chest and swallowed thickly. Before he knew it Tony's fingertips were tracing over the bow of his lips and he felt something flutter in his chest. On instinct Steve nipped at his fingertips lightly, playfully, his own blue eyes darkening a fraction.
Tony climbed out of bed and approached Steve instead to get a better look at him.  He ran his hands over Steve, down his arms and down his sides, drinking in the sight of that uniform.
"Look it up. It's trending on Twitter. #StandWithCap. People have made little badges that look like your shield. It's cute. They're wearing them to show their support, not just for you...you know, for what you're standing for."
" he emphasized, catching Steve's eye, snickering.  "She burst into my office with Happy like she owned the place.  It was great.  And after she left, I turned to Happy and I said,
DeSoto was wearing a loose, sleeveless shirt and a pair of shorts; Tony felt even more confused now.  Were they going to play basketball? The idea was so ludicrous he began laughing. DeSoto gave an indulgent smile at him, even though he clearly didn't get the joke.
Tony made a face.  He rose, and made to scoop Steve up, but realized almost immediately that he couldn't.  After a moment, he said, "Er, I guess you can walk now on your own."
He threaded their fingers together.  There was a flash and a shutter click as someone took their picture.  Tony gave Steve a gentle tug toward the bar. He felt the slightest bit peeved that Jane had had to ask that.  Jane was a beta; she clearly did not understand the ever-present, looming sense of inadequacy Steve had. He was an omega, one raised in the twenties and thirties, one who had been small and sick to boot.  Steve may have been perfect, now, but Steve was still vulnerable to moments like this, where he didn't feel good enough. Tony wasn't an omega but he could relate. Growing up under the influence of two Alphas who were both far, far more dominant than him had given him the same sort of self-esteem issues.
His legs curled around Tony, allowing him to sink in deeper as Steve was almost bent in half. He was flexible, he could do it. The serum had allowed him to push himself easily. He could even do the splits. Clint often told him he should do yoga but Steve wasn't sure all the sitting around and focusing on breathing was for him.
"Y'know how omegas have scent glands behind their ears?  Is that... is that like a... pressure point type deal?" asked Tony.
"To be fair, it's not like she couldn't have guessed.  Howard had a reputation," said Fury, crossing his arms.
"That's just his normal look," Tony said. "He probably has gas or something. All right, tell us what we're looking at. I mean, I think I can kind of figure, but you're the experts here."
"Ten weeks? That's practically the end of the first trimester. Did all that shit really go down over two months ago?" He shook his head and pressed his face into his hands. "Jesus," he muttered. "How is this my fucking life?"
He spun around to see his over-seasoned friend standing beside him, and Tony sighed a little and said, "No, just…checking things out."
The first man looked at the vial in the hands of the second man and the sachet in the hands of the third. "But what will this
Steve nodded, and Tony shot him a pointed look and added, "I mean, it was a little weird having your one-armed friend there instead of you—"
Tony shrugged, but Barnes said, "He's really only upset because the birdman model would be the bottom-seller."
God, he hoped this baby was completely one hundred percent Steve's. Fucking movies. Fucking stupid movies.
"Honey, if Thor said it was a ruse and she was full of shit, you know I wouldn't care. But he is a hundred percent positive that she's telling the truth—"
He shrugged again, and Bruce turned to him and asked as though he was genuinely interested, "You flip houses?"
It had been Hydra. They'd found that out back when they'd been on the run. Hydra had had his parents killed — or at least his father. His mother was the quintessential innocent bystander caught in the fray, but his father was the target. For what reason, he didn't know and wasn't sure he'd ever know, but Hydra had been the ones to do it. Not Howard.
Steve would notice that, and Tony knew which moles in particular Steve, the pervert, was thinking of.
Prototype lightweight gauntlet for travel purposes? Check. Hey, he was an Avenger pregnant with the child of the world's first super soldier. It didn't hurt to be prepared, especially since everyone knew who he was now.
Steve frowned and took gentle hold of Olivia's hands to pull the cookie away from her mouth so that he could get a better look at it. She whined and tried to pull it back, but he just held her hands and looked over the shape that looked more like, well…
"So, why the fake name?" Ella was the one to ask that, and Steve, surprisingly, was the one that chimed in with a response.
"Go to sleep, honey," he said, a gentle hand on his forehead before he scooped up the discarded towel and vanished.
"Make a fist," he said, and Tony followed his instructions and watched as Bruce tied the band the proper amount above the elbow and then turned Tony's arm. He pressed some more just to the side of the inside of his elbow and nodded his approval. He put the gloves on, grabbed an alcohol wipe, and wiped the area to sterilize before he turned and grabbed a syringe.
It was weird being in this body. It was his, and it wasn't his, but he couldn't deny that having the control over where to touch and what to touch and how much to work it was, to some degree, better than having to explain it to someone else. He'd even heard it said that some women had to finish themselves off after having sex with their partners, and he'd thought it an urban legend up to that point. Not that he'd ever had that problem with Steve, but if Steve wasn't so good, wasn't so attuned to what Tony wanted, and wasn't so willing and able to fulfill all of Tony's wishes and desires… Yeah, he could see having to do the job himself and enjoying it more than any man could ever possibly hope to give it to him.
Bruce just shrugged, kind of embarrassed and kind of like he was ashamed to admit he'd had a good time, and Barton said, "I'm sorry. Did you think we said the New School? No! They were from NYU! The spoiled little shits had it coming to them."
"Not really. Doesn't take a genius to figure out the guy probably prefers to take it that way." "But you seem…awfully detailed about it. Like you've definitely thought about it before."
There was a funny look that came over Tony's face at that, a sort of bemused perplexity or maybe nervous wariness. Like he wasn't quite sure how to answer his question without spoiling too much for him.
"Powdered?" Steve asked, and Tony heard the telltale sounds of a bag of delicious Italian being unpacked, savory scents wafting into the air.
Tony again heard something muttered in Russian, and he was able to fly the suit over the battlefield in time to see Barnes get up from where he sat crushing Steve's chest and simply walk away. Tony did a three-point landing beside Steve just as he'd begun to sit up, and he kept the kneeling position as Steve sat and stared forlornly in the direction Barnes was currently walking. Not running, not sprinting, not darting like he was trying to evade capture. Just walking, slowly, like he couldn't be bothered.
, out of his clutch and shoved it at Steve, saying, "Here hold this," and then grabbed the tube of lipstick out of the clutch as well.
…about what's going on with me and Tony. They don't need to think it's affecting the rest of the team as well."
Without bothering to wait for Bruce's answer, he hiked up the hem of the shirt enough to get at the hook that held up the cup for the bra.
Bruce looked like he was honestly trying to fight the smile that was fighting to stretch over his lips. "Actually, no."
But Rhodey just blinked at him and said, "No, seriously, where'd the food come from? You order out? I would've gotten something."
He grimaced at the slobber, but he wiped it off with his hand and then put it up to his ear and said, "Hello? Yes?" He held it out to her. "It's for you."
friends — people to rely on or depend on or just call up to bullshit with every so often. So many of the people he'd come into contact with over his life had only ever been interested in him for what he could give them — what he could provide for them and nothing else.
Steve nodded just a fraction and said, "Well, maybe she recognizes my voice? They can, you know. Recognize voices they heard while they were in the womb. Supposedly anyway."
"Yeah." He shrugged. "Anyway, it…didn't take long for it to get around to the other girls in the chorus line, and—"
They exited, Tony wobbling some on heels that had been borrowed from Hill, and he shook Natasha's hand off his wrist then grappled onto her arm as tight as he could. She met his gaze for only a moment before she looked down and caught sight of the way his legs shook in uneasy balance.
it. And maybe that sounded like the ravings of a mad person in complete denial over what he'd just been told, but for some reason, that felt important to him. He didn't
And you'd pump into me so hard and so fast I'd feel it for days afterward, and every time I sat down, all I'd be able to think about is you plunging into me and telling me if I don't come on your cock, I don't come at all. Because I'm yours. I'm yours to do with whatever you want. And then you'd come in me. So much, so much and I'd barely be able to take it all, you'd come so much. But you'd make me take it. You'd come and then you'd plug me up and make me keep it all inside me, make me hold it, keep—
His radio crackled, and he jumped and went wide-eyed as the others turned in his direction, and he slid out of the atrium and moved into another room before he grabbed it and said a snappish,
"'Old man' is your pet name for me," Steve muttered and shot a knowing and somewhat unimpressed look at him.
But Tony just pulled up the tablet and began to read off the words he'd highlighted. "Mucus plugs. Blood. Gushing fluid. Shit— I could
"Yes, you do. You don't say anything unless you mean to say it. I can't tell you, Steve. And now you're doing that thing with your jaw where you're tensing it up because someone's telling you something you don't want to hear and you're thinking hard about what you're going to do next to try to convince me to tell you."
Natasha insisted that Tony really try to 'wow' Steve, and at the last store they ventured into, she picked out some rather eye-popping lingerie especially for the evening. Tony had to laugh as she showed it to him and said, "Why are you encouraging this?"
Tony just glared at him. "I'm ashamed for you that you even feel the need to ask that." He pointed to someone two rows behind him. "You."
He left the room again, the wet towels and the remnants of Steve's cup in hand, and he called back, "Go upstairs and get changed! You're going to be miserable the rest of the day if you don't — and don't give me any of that shit about 'back during the war'! War ended a long time ago!"
"Ah, come on," Barton said, pulling Tony out of his imagined picture of Bruce and Wilson standing on a hilltop and singing 'I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing.' "Don't you want your little Starkling to grow up in a world free from pollution and other environmental hazards? Remember the crying Indian? Don't make the Indian cry."
Tony looked to the doctor. "OK, I want you to bear witness to this. This, right here? This is what I put up with all day, every day. I don't want you leaving here under the assumption that this guy is as wholesome as apple pie. No, he's a jerk. He's a sarcastic pain in the ass. He is the very definition of a troll."
Rhodey grimaced a little and put his hands up. "Yeah, but I really don't need you two getting your everlasting happiness all over me." He paused in thought a moment and added, "OK, that sounded pretty bad—"
No, the serum merely amplified what was already there. Captain America was who he was because Steve Rogers was who he was. Because he was that earnest, that steadfast, that honest and cunning and intelligent and detailed and precise and caring and charitable and—
They both finished their business, toilets flushing and doors slamming open, and they continued their chatter over by the sinks but they had moved onto some other subject that was more personal and so Tony tuned it out and waited for them to leave before he departed the stall and washed up.
He yawned and sat up a bit and took in his surroundings, and he saw Steve checking his mirrors as he drove up the pathway.
"Could not pay me enough to trade places with you," Barton said with a laugh, and Romanoff smacked him. "Ow! Nat! Quit it!"
They stayed like that, swaying in time to the gentle rhythm, cheek-to-cheek, bodies flush with each other, and Steve didn't even realize the song had ended until another voice said from somewhere in the distance, "I can come back."
"Oh," he said with a nod and sipped his coffee. "Yeah, Barton's pushing for a laser tag arena. Think he has Nat on his side. Probably Wilson. Barnes was probably an easy sell. Thor, I'm sure, has no clue what it is, but he's game for pretty much anything. Bruce, I'm sure, would like to, but he's afraid the Hulk might want to join in."
Steve hummed a little, and he took Tony by his hips and pushed him up against the wall of the elevator as the doors closed behind them. “You think I don’t?” he murmured into Tony’s ear, and he felt Tony practically melt in his grasp. He brushed his nose against Tony’s jawline and rolled his hips some to push his still-hard shaft into Tony’s hip, Tony’s rock-hard dick pressing into his thigh.
Steve got that sour look on his face like he knew Pepper was right but he just didn't want to admit it, and Tony turned to Steve and, swizzle stick to his lips, said, "So, did you have fun with Helen?"
Cap held Tony's gaze for just a moment longer before he turned to Olivia and said, "Tell you what. I bet if you close your eyes, the next time you open them, Papa'll be standing right there with us."
Tony flashed a tight smile at him. "Yeah. You sure you didn't just plan this all at the last minute because JARVIS let it slip that I was maybe a little upset about it?"
could fix this for him — when the crack of a bullet just grazed past his temple, and he heard the telltale slump and thump of a body hitting the ground behind him, presumably the son-of-a-bitch that had stuck him with the needle.
"Yeah? Well, what are we supposed to do about it, Steve? There's no way to— There's no easy access, which doesn't make any sense, or I guess it does because why would there be easy access? Why didn't this whole thing just go away when I changed back? How in the ever-loving fuck is this my life?"
"Sass-bot," he muttered and found the doors opening to the 59th floor. The lights were down until he stepped out onto the floor, and then they came up, illuminating with each slow, painful step that he took. The 59th floor was an unused floor at current, and the construction of the Tower allowed it to be a relatively broad, open space with the exception of expertly-placed support pillars. He glanced around, hands at the ready, and looked for anything out of the ordinary.
He got upstairs — he'd actually never been up here; this was Tony and Pepper's…OK, probably now just Tony's domain, and he hadn't felt right about intruding — and tried to follow the sounds of a four-year-old on the loose.
Tony rolled his eyes as Steve began to poke at his belly, watching as the little creature within reached to each prod and jab. "What have I told you about believing everything you read on the internet?"
Cap just shot him a flat look. "No, you're right. The Hydra weapons from the war, the Red Skull, the Tesseract, waking up seventy years in the future, Loki, the Chitauri… That makes sense. Nothing strange about any of that. Meeting an alternate universe version of myself?" He exhaled a heavy breath. "Yeah, don't know if I'd be able to handle that. Might be just a little much for this old soldier to take."
The muesli wasn't the most awful thing he'd ever eaten, and he was able to finish the bowl, and when he went to stick it into the dishwasher, he found the damned thing fully-loaded but unwashed. He rolled his eyes and found a spot for the bowl and the spoon then dug out a soap tablet and said, "It's two fucking steps, Steve. Put the soap tablet in, close the stupid thing up, and hit the button. OK,
He drummed his hands on the tabletop in anticipation, and he glanced up and looked ahead of him to the fridge, frowning at the little square piece of blue paper he saw there. He got up and went over to inspect it. It looked like one of Steve's stupid stunts, but if Steve stuck a piece of paper somewhere, there was usually a reason for it — and maybe, in this circumstance, something on it. This, he realized as he came upon the slip, was blank.
"Eh, I've got this—" He motioned over his figure. "I might as well show it off for as long as I can."
He groaned once again and opened his eyes, and he glanced to the side to see a small face and big, dark eyes staring back at him.
Natasha just shrugged, but Hill said, "Nothing wrong in pointing out his quite obvious physical attributes."
He adjusted his position somewhat to try and find a comfortable spot, and as the other Commandos quietly sang an off-key rendition of one of Bing Crosby's Christmas hits, Steve drifted off into a lonely, fitful sleep.
now. This was all his. This — this man and everything that went with him — belonged him to him, legally, free and clear. He belonged to Steve, maybe, but Steve also belonged to him. They belonged to each other.
He shot a pointed look at him. "I'll be fine. We'll both be fine. Go see if they need help. I can— I'll manage."
Tony shrugged. "I don't know. Barton's an ass, but he's a good fucking shot—" He pointed a finger at Barnes and added, "I
So, they ate and they chatted and mingled with the crowd that Tony realized in a moment of reflection when Steve went to get him a glass of non-spiked punch was the best and truest group of friends he'd ever had in his life. In fact, except for Rhodey and then Pepper and Happy (even if they'd begun as paid assistants to him), he'd never really had
A somewhat hysterical part of him wondered if DUM-E's claw would suffice for forceps. You know, just in case. Not that he wanted DUM-E, of all 'bots…down there…doing
"Yeah, well, he's gonna need all the help he can get for that," Barnes said, a little too smug and cocky.
Tony blinked at her, blanking on the info. That…was probably something he should have been made aware of.
"Hey, not your fault. Don't worry about it. Shit happens. We'll manage. You sticking around? We giving this Avengers-thing a shot?"
Tony shared a look with Bruce, who looked like he was trying desperately hard not to laugh. "She's an honest one, isn't she?"
But unless he'd just been had — which was always a possibility — the gulf between them would grow no longer. Yes, he was sacrificing a lot of things for this, but the very thought of staying young while he watched his family grow old and die before him was something he just couldn't bear to entertain. So, maybe it was selfish of him, and maybe — no matter what Esmeralda said — he did still owe a debt to those that had done this for him, but he wasn't an automaton. He wasn't a machine. Maybe he had been created as a weapon, but he was a human with feelings and wants and desires. He was a man that had been alone for far too long and was terrified of being left alone once again. He had never really meant for the Army — for Captain America — to be a permanent thing for him. There was a war on, and he had signed up to do his part. Maybe he would have stayed in after all was said and done — made a career of it — but that had never been his intention going into it, and he wasn't sure that he would have even kept up the 'Captain America' mantle after the war. He would have just gone back to being Captain Steven Rogers. Maybe a major. Maybe a colonel. Hell, maybe they'd make him some one- or two-star general. But 'Captain America' was never meant to be permanent. It was never meant to last beyond the war.
Pepper snorted into her drink, unable to keep from laughing at how disastrously this conversation was going.
"Of course, SHIELD will arrange more security than last time. We aren't prepared to take risks again," Nick said.
She offered him a hand, and helped pull him to his feet.  He swayed but walked out, straight-backed, still blinking a little, disoriented.
"...fine," said Tony quickly. "Replaced the palladium cores with a badassium one and everything's good now.  Don't worry about it.  It's none of your business.  ...lemme go get a towel."
Tony leaned down to nose against Steve's neck; collars were no longer designed to "protect" the bonding gland, and Tony could see the mark just above the rim of the silver-plated vibranium; without thinking, he bit, sinking his teeth into flesh, aggressively, animalistically; his fingers were digging into Steve's hips, probably bruising them; he was already balls-deep but still pushing, pulling on the back of Steve's neck with his mouth like maybe he could tug Steve further onto his cock, which was throbbing so blissfully inside him--
"...you know she knows we fuck, right?" asked Tony, rocking against Steve's body.  He leaned down to murmur in Steve's ear. "You know I could never love her like I love you, right?  You know you're the only omega in the world for me, and I love you?" He nipped Steve's earlobe. In his hand, Steve's shaft had gotten hard; Tony could feel it throbbing.
Once Tony got down on his knees properly his brain stopped producing coherent thoughts anyway. Steve let out a quiet, pleased sound and tilted his head back, eyes fluttering shut as the wet heat of Tony's mouth enveloped him. He was getting wet too; he'd need to change underwear before he headed out again.  They were definitely going to be late.
--" Steve panted, his breath hot against the other's left cheek. He could still feel the other's knot nudging against him and struggled to comprehend how he once used to take all of it. "Tony. Please, I need-"
"Wow," said Steve.  He lapsed back into thought while, on the television, one of the two beta men staggering around the desert in his underwear.  What a time to be alive.
Steve refused to face Tony; Tony rubbed his back soothingly.  Tony couldn't help but feel a little bit hurt because he understood why Steve felt so confused.  Steve wanted to be good for his Alpha, but subconsciously, that was Bucky.
His smile faltered as JARVIS continued.  A lump filled his throat.  Change the world for good?  Him?
"I love dismantling security systems," said Tony gleefully.  It was true. To Tony, fences made bad neighbors. He spent a lot of time hacking just for fun.  A way to fine-tune his skills and also to get access to information. The more forbidden the information, the more exciting it was.
"...you never asked how mine was," said Natasha.  Her voice was cool, measured, but Steve knew her well enough to know she was joking.
"Of course." Steve kissed Tony's cheek and then pulled away to rummage through the bathroom cabinet. He found some non-scented lotion and went back to kneel by the bed. He gently rubbed it into heated skin, hoping it would ease some of the irritation. Steve didn't know why he felt so bad for it-- it wasn't like he'd made the omegas wear collars in the first place-- but still...
Steve felt a tug in his gut and he looked up at the ceiling. Aria tugged on his hand. "Come on! Steve! Get up on stage… let’s go!"
Steve moved to make pancakes. His ma had taught him to cook growing up. It meant that when Bucky worked and Steve hadn't been well enough to, he'd always provided
Tony turning his back on him was like a knife to his gut. Steve screwed his eyes shut again as his whole body trembled.
Tony shifted his weight uncomfortably.  "Is the bedroom okay to... look him over?  Steve already ruined the sheets there.  No offense, Steve.  It's okay.  They were cheap sheets."  (They were worth $17,000 but Tony felt it was the wrong time to tell Steve that.)
gonna have to fight them?" She asked. The idea was laughable. Only Maria was professionally trained. She turned to the SHIELD agent. "Please tell me you have back up. Or something."
He shoved past her roughly and stomped up the stairs.  In the kitchen, Steve was sitting on a stool, hunched over the counter, picking at a sandwich.  Sam was sitting on the counter, hands clasping in front if him.
"And win wars," Steve cut in, talking breezily, still smiling now. It was strange, that an argument was cheering him up... but maybe he really did need to oppose things to feel accomplished sometimes. And arguing with Gideon felt a lot more productive than bickering with Donner over how he saw himself. That kind of change could only come with time.
"You just mated me, for real. You're not seriously gonna run off to go just get a drink now?" Steve asked, sounding almost timid as if he were afraid of the answer.
Those three things were all that mattered but he didn't even know where to start.  He kept his head down and walked briskly, avoiding people, all too aware of the blood all over his face and leg.  He keeled over a few times, ducking into alleys to clutch his stomach and retch a little.
"Steve.  Steve, it's gonna be okay," he said.  There was blood on Steve's face and Tony could feel himself shaking inside the suit, literally shivering.  The blood was his, from the cut on his lip, but he wasn't thinking clearly; the mere picture of Steve with blood was terrifying, the worst thing ever; he stomped into the ER in the suit, clutching Steve like a ragdoll.
. This has gotten way too personal.  This isn’t a SHIELD thing. This is a Steve Rogers thing.  And I figure, right now, it's easier if you come to me."
"You're not getting away that easily," said Coulson.  Tony sulked the whole elevator ride down, his arms awkwardly crossed over his chest, armor gleaming.  He tried to look dignified as he opened the door to sub-level three and let his bots peel away the suit's interlocking plates while everyone stared.  He would have preferred to leave the armor on, but he could practically feel the palladium core of the reactor disintegrating inside him and he needed to preserve it at all costs.
It had taken Tony a year to get comfortable with this but now that they were doing it again he was unsure why in the hell he hadn't tried it sooner.  Steve's reaction alone was enough to get him uncomfortably hard. He kept one hand on Steve's skin, flicking his tongue over his inviting little slit, and reached down with his other hand to undo his pants and  ease out his erection. He stroked himself slowly, hungrily licking at Steve's entrance, which was getting wet and juicy and quivering with an unspoken desire to be filled up. Tony's other hand continued to massage Steve's ass; Tony heard himself growl quietly with satisfaction.  Steve was a bundle of nerves; his muscles were coiled up with the effort of not moving and Tony liked the feeling of Steve's desperation under his fingers.
"We're working on it, remember, Gleason said before Christmas..." Tony tried to reassure him.  He didn't add that he had doubts. What if Gleason came up empty? Steve was a singularity; everything about him was in direct violation of what nature said was normal.  Who knew if anything worked on him?
Steve gasped in surprise when Tony came all over his face. He was surprised by the immediacy of it, the sensation...but also how hot strangely turned on it left him. His own cock was hard and trapped beneath the sheets, his thighs shiny and wet. Steve swallowed.
He was glad to hear Steve talking about something other than the tesseract, or the Winter Soldier, but frowned at Steve's words.  "Oh.  Really?"  He took a second to assess himself.  He didn't feel different.  He felt the usual overwhelming urge to writhe on top of Steve.  Protect him, mate him, maybe punch and/or fuck something.  The yooj.  "I think I got maybe two or three more days, but it's not as bad as it was at the beginning," he reported.  "Let's enjoy this, okay?  We can worry about the hypercube later.  Look, they'd had it for months, and nothing bad has happened.  It's not going anywhere.  C'mon, let's hit the pool.  Some sunshine will do you good."  He tugged Steve's hand.
"And this is Lila.  ...who's normally not shy, actually.  Lila, what are you doing down there? Say hi to Steve."
"...not very dominant.  I know," said Tony. "Naw, according to Stark family legend, I was born with my eyes open and my hackles raised.  There wasn't any doubt." Tony didn't know whether this particular detail was true. However, he had seen an old photo from the early seventies in which his mother and Ana were laughing themselves senseless at a four-month-old baby Tony growling at Goofy at Disneyland, hair spiked and lip curled.  (Presumably his father had taken the picture. A contemporary of Walt Disney, his father had often referred to him as "damned wasted talent," and Tony saw it as a rare sign of affection that he had taken his infant son to Disneyland.)
"Okay, okay, we'll dance, but I swear, if he tries to come in here--"  His hackles stood up again. Banksy walked back over and smoothed them down.
Tony shrugged a little.  He didn't really know Clint or Natasha.  Both seemed okay.  Clint had answered some of his questions about bonding, and he'd trusted Nat enough to run a test simulation for him.  They were going to be on a team together soon anyway.
"Right. Stronger for its diversity. Got it," Steve breathed and moved to get back up, his hair only a little neater than it had been before. Aria moved to straighten out of his jacket collar and then they were walking. The back of Steve's neck wasn't even red anymore and the scarring had all turned the shiny pink- white color it should be.
Steve sucked in a soft breath as Tony's fingers explored. He swallowed thickly. He knew he was touching Bucky's mark. He knew it on instinct. And he felt gross, for a moment, before he pushed that doubt away. Steve felt dizzy, almost, and let his eyes slip shut.
He met Phil's gaze and couldn't help but smirk a little. The agent gave him a fond look. "This might hurt a little," he warned before pressing the needle into his skin, squeezing the blue liquid into his veins.
"So... let me just be clear, here... you want me to go to a sleezy motel pretending my name is Richard
"Kneel."  He barely even whispered it.  It was so quiet that it was gone as soon as he'd murmured it, a beat of moth's wings toward a flame.  Maybe he hadn't said it at all.  Maybe he'd only thought it.  Maybe he'd only remembered how Steve had looked when he was down on one knee earlier.  The word, tiny and fragile, had already evaporated, all evidence of it wiped from existence.
"I'm gonna hold you to that, Tony!" called Elon, pointing; Tony pointed back cheekily and then offered Steve an arm.
Howard dragged a hand across his face and said something, but the film was skipping again, and his words were indistinguishable.
"...call off your drones.  You're putting people's lives in danger.  It's me you want, isn't it?" demanded Tony, one metal arm wrapping around Jack's neck. "Call them off.  Let everyone go."
Her voice dropped. "You're a good omega, even if you're not very well trained." She gave him a deadly smile, then turned away, a nonverbal dismissal.
"Maybe Tony should go home," Aria suggested gently. "Considering what happened earlier too. He still looks pretty... merry." She was pulling a cigarette out herself and she couldn't find a lighter. Bethany offered her one. She smiled in thanks.
"No one," said Karpov, pointing to him with the cigarette.  "I programmed you. You belong to me. There is no Winter Soldier without me.  If I ever retire, you listen to no one."
Steve wasn't sure what she meant by 'gooey' but he took the offered phone anyway and held it to his ear. "Nat? Hey.  Are you okay? I'm afraid I won't be able to see you till after Christmas now, I think biology is catching up with me... we could do New Year's, maybe?"
"...you know, people wanting to sleep with you isn't a bad thing," said Tony, taking a shot and immediately gesturing for another.  "Just... throwing this out there... if you wanted a threesome I would be very, very down for a threesome. Shit, is that--"
"Can I get you anything?" asked Tony eagerly, feeding Steve another ice chip.  He was desperate to please Steve. "Do you need any more pillows? Water? I brought your necklace. Do you want that? Are you warm enough? I can turn on the air conditioning more.  Do you want me to turn on music?"
"Tony.  I just got off the phone with the Secretary of Defense.  We apprehended Hammer," announced Rhodey.
But first things first.  Bucky tilted Steve's head a little more and Steve complied, moving gracefully under his hands, and he leaned forward to bite down on the back of his neck.  The scar there wasn't right, didn't fit his mouth at all. He bit down harder, needing it reshaped, needing it to fit. Needing to fix it.
Bucky stared curiously at the omega.  He felt like he might have spoken to this man before.  He seemed vaguely familiar.
reasonable, Obes," and then closed them again.  It took Steve a moment to realize that Tony was still asleep.
Tony glanced up.  His eyes met his green ones, and slowly, his body went limp under Happy's.  "No.  No, you're right," he said, panting.  "I don't want him... you're right, Pepper..."  Oh, God, but he
Karpov waved at him irritably.  "--do you have any idea what I've been dealing with these last few weeks?" he hissed into the phone.  A beach ball rolled past him. "And now you're telling me
There was another omega there.  The one from the base in Cuba. He was in a light windbreaker that seemed completely inappropriate considering the weather.  The snowflakes were powdering his long, silver-blond hair; he shook them off, watching Steve.
He thought about the chances of Tony getting attacked...Steve guessed being mated to each other just made them a bigger target; two birds, one stone.
Tony grinned and walked over to offer him a hand.  "Yeah.  We are.  It's the future, Steve.  We can do anything we want to.  Now come to bed."
"A singer type of artist. Last I remember you guys were yelling about Pitbull. Because if you still need someone I might have something, I just wondered...you know," Aria said, not looking at him as she tapped away on her phone, replying to all of Steve's emails.
," said Natasha in warning.  She'd seen too many interrogations go south because of bickering between interrogators.
He was inside one of the canvas tents, looking sheepish as people squeezed his biceps and cooed over him.
Natasha nodded, stroking Clint's hair mindlessly.  "Tony is a selfish asshole but... I think this was a good wake-up call for him."
Downstairs, Tony punched his code into the keycard on the door and yanked Pepper inside.  Relief flooded him when the heavy door closed behind him with a click and a beep.  The glass was bulletproof and always had been, since before Afghanistan.  The keycard on the door was top of the line, designed by Tony himself.  Here, he felt safe.  Saf
"But maybe it does. Maybe it matters but you don't realise it in your head. You have three hours to account for, dude, and not all of that is buying phones and talking to Fury."
Seeing  as HYDRA had heat-inducing technology it had seemed best to leave the omegas back. But now Steve was apparently in heat with Bucky with him... considering both Natasha and Sam were Alphas too, things could get messy.
From the living room, Phil was playing the Dave Matthews band at full volume, loud enough to make the orchid petals tremble.
Bucky's reaction was immediate, but probably not what Karpov had expected.  He let go of Steve and slammed against the glass door, clawing, snarling, instantly feral.  The threat of another Alpha to his omega had broken whatever last bit of consciousness was holding him together.
"Thanks Rhodey you're the best, hey, Steve, c'mon, gimme some sugar!"  Tony flung himself at Steve, wrapping his arms around his neck and nuzzling into his chest affectionately.
"I know," he answered her innocently, moving to make coffee and grab a croissant. "We're waitin' on Tony."
Ian picked at his salad with a loud sigh. "You guys wanna get lunch somewhere? Unless I eat some wheat-heavy product soon I think I'm gonna faint."
He kept staring at his hands.  He wasn't sure whether they were telling him to stand or not.  He wasn't sure who they were or where he was or whether or not this was real.
no, it’s right, it's always right-- then we'll get our newest, latest, greatest element in here, right out of the kicker, into this stripping chamber, and then we can just shoot it right over there to that sink, right, it's based on the arc reactor's old design, right, we still got the ten acceleration modules and particle bottle ring but there's no longer a reaction chamber since this element, in theory, anyway, has a ridiculously long carbon life.  Good news for me because, being honest here, this little tabletop science fair experiment probably isn't safe. I mean, the stripping chamber is a little closer to the carbon ring transfer line and the voltage terminal than is probably safe so everyone's gonna need shades.  When the particle beam is gonna hit that ring over there--yes, I know it's a triangle, asshole,
Donner was apparently content to stay at George's for now. Although if Gideon found him there Steve didn't know what he'd do.
"I have to stay with Steve," said Tony, still clinging to Steve uninjured hand.  "He's my mate. Rhodey-"
"Just some fruit and bread, you know, light... I'll just leave it here.  Steve, you should eat. Those pills on an empty stomach'll make you ill."
.  He wanted to demand to know what Steve had done to him but he didn't want Steve to know how susceptible he was to Steve's suggestions.  His body had tuned itself to Steve's frequency; every emotion Steve felt was communicated to him via scent and Tony felt almost like a mind reader.  Worse, he was pretty sure it worked both ways and Steve could sense what he was feeling.
Tony didn't bother offering to take the large crate of supplies Steve had heaved up.  It looked heavy. Steve was handling it with ease, but Tony was willing to bet it was at least a hundred pounds.
"MIT?  Yeah... yeah, okay, call them for me... but first I need you to read Steve's report, I'm too drunk... Steve... Steve, did you send that report?  I'm only reading it 'cause it's so damned important to you.  I hate reports, I hate paperwork, you know that..."  He hiccuped, but nothing more came up.  He felt slightly better.  He took another swig of his gin, forcing himself to keep it down.
"Did we get omegas all their rights back yet, or do we have to keep attending this conference?" asked Tony blearily, sniffing tentatively at the coffee.  "...can you carry me into the living room?" he asked plaintively, clinging to the sheets around him with one hand and reaching for Steve with the other. Tony had no intention of going downstairs to the convention any time before noon.  He wanted to pick at some breakfast, shower, and maybe nap some more. God, he'd really gone through the wringer...
"You got it.  Mushrooms and pineapple.  JARVIS! Order us two larges... Steve, will that be enough?  I know you eat like a freakin' bear. JARVIS, give preference to Domino's, tell them there's a nice tip in it for them if they get it to us through that mob.  And throw up
"No take-backs, Stark!  I won him fair and square!" said Malick with delight, reaching for the collar.
His whole display was blinking red, as if he might have missed getting a grenade thrown at him and then bouncing off a couple of concrete walls.
Tony had to admit, he was relieved.  The nurse's comment about "bouncing back" rang true with him.  His body had recovered from the palladium poisoning; a month ago, he was certain he'd be dead by now, but instead, every test was showing him that he, like his father, was going to live a good, long, shockingly healthy life.
look great?" he asked with a coyness he hadn't known he was capable of.  He was still buzzing off of his run and Tony was naked in front of him. He was only human. Or, only super human. Whatever. He was almost stood between Tony's legs now, his Alpha taller than him like this. If Steve tilted his head up just right he'd feel Tony's breath on his cheek. "Because that's not very nice, if you are..."
"I have that preheat interview thing for that documentary," Steve pointed out. "We could bring it up then. But that isn't supposed to be broadcast live so...maybe we'll have to prerecord something," he sighed, clearly disappointed at the thought of missing it. "Shit."
She jogged across the field.  She was wearing jeans and boots as well; her breath came out in little puffs of steam.  "Hi, Steve! Long time, no see! Here!" She shoved something into his hand. "Here's your mission patch for Yemen.  Unofficial, of course." The patch she had handed him was an ankle bracelet with an American flag background. It definitely wasn't something Steve would be able to wear on his uniform.
He was pining for his omega.  He had to find him; he had to fix this.  Everything was wrong; everything was weird.  Ever since they had tried mating, Tony had been acutely aware of how different everything was now.  Steve had promised he wouldn't leave, but he had. Of course he had. What omega could resist the draw of their primary Alpha, of their first bond?
Now, a year after replacing it with the badassium-core RT node, Tony felt like a new man.  So far, there hadn't been any ill effects. He still needed to clean out the chest socket once a week; it produced a discharge, as any power source would.  But there didn't appear to be any toxic effects and the discharge wasn't radioactive or anything. That being said, he was still a long way off from ever commercializing the technology.  It was still too new, and the reactor that powered his heart was tiny, compared to anything needed to power, say, a car, or a building.
Steve felt like he was floating, half aware of his physicality and Tony's touch and half lost in his own mind. His body buzzed with bliss and a low thrum of contentment. He could stay like this forever, he figured. And Steve didn't think this feeling was uniquely 'honeymoon' either. It was just loving and safe and secure. No one else had ever seen Steve like this before and they never would. He was in pieces, broken up and exposed by pleasure until the very barest of instincts were put on display for just Tony to see.
Tony looked down and his heart nearly stopped.  There was a bandage around his chest, stained brown, blooms of blood around the edges, and trailing from it, wires--
"Access.  Right," repeated Tony.  He lacked a comm but it didn't matter; anything wireless was something he could jerry rig and pick up in the helmet.
Tony let out a half-sigh, half-groan of satisfaction.  He glanced down when he felt Steve pull away; Steve was smiling up at him, his lips still wrapped around the end of his member.
"Oh, it's easy," said Tony, who was holding his injured hand out of the shower to keep the bandages from getting wet.  There were, by Steve's estimation, a billion jets in Tony's shower, and he was getting water all over the floor by having the glass door open.
"Dad wasn't an idiot," said Tony.  There was no bite in his words. He sounded flat and distant; his ample brain power was being used up to keep a vice-like hold on his emotions.  He lapsed back into silence, staring at the stones still. An hour passed; Tony didn't move, still lost in his own mind, oblivious to Steve and to the light snowfall that began to come down around them.
Steve gave her a sorry look and then sprinted upstairs. He saw two figures tumbling into one of the bedrooms and ignored them, walking past towards where he could feel Tony. The feeling of panic and tightness in his chest wasn't his. Or, at least, it wasn't his alone.
"You're right.  Rogers, you any good with the metro?  Can you get on a train and disappear if we hold them off?  Create a choke point?" asked Fury.  His eye never left the road; they were coming within inches of hitting other motorists, and being greeted with a lot of angry honks, but slowing down would only mean that the black vehicle behind them would catch up, and you didn't have to be a genius to know that it was not filled with any well-wishers.
Tony nuzzled Steve's neck.  It was so weird to see him, the familiar Captain America from the posters... yet also to smell him, undeniably omega, not the dominant Alpha Tony had always assumed.  It was paradoxically strange, seeing Steve as his childhood hero, as opposed to his mate.
Lydia was already pulling the silvery collar out of the case and handing it to Tony with a sort of reverence.  Tony examined it. It was surprisingly heavy in his hands; he wondered if Steve would be okay with that. Most collars were heavy; he didn't want Steve to feel burdened by it.  Personally, Tony couldn't care less; he was willing to wear whatever. To him, the whole thing was a joke, like going in drag. But he knew this had a lot more weight (ha!) to an omega like Steve.
"Last I heard you were being attacked, not sure that qualifies as nicer circumstances." Tony said with slightly more sass than was really necessary but he couldn't control his mouth during the best of times.
But the idea of being alone with them, it just... panicked him. It felt like it did back in his hotel room, all he wanted was to be as far away from them as possible.
"This makes no sense." Tony had built Vision his abilities shouldn't make him such an easy target, to make it so Vision is out of commission for this long would take someone that had an idea about how he worked and even he was surprised by how Vision acted, and he had helped create him.
"Shouldn't you have a glass at least?" Barnes asked eyeing the bottle with more emotion then he'd seen from the man last time they met which meant BARF must have done some good for him at least.
"No one would blame you if you didn't do this Tony, you've already helped us so much with BARF it saved Bucky. Shuri said that he would be no where close to where he is now without it. I can't thank you enough for that, for giving me my best friend back." Steve sounded so sincere and happy that despite himself Tony couldn't resist smiling a little.
"I have no idea what you're talking about." Tony said not even looking at either man his head still in his hands, he couldn't look at either man.
"If I close my eyes will you be gone?" He said hoping that this was all just a product of his messed up brain.
Tony could hear the pain and hurt in his voice, it caused his own eyes to water with tears but if there's one thing Howard ever taught him it was that Stark men don't cry. "What's going on Steve?"
"We made a mistake with Clint, doll's gonna work it out too soon." Bucky knew Tony would have worked it out eventually but within hours of getting there was too soon they needed more time.
"We aren't gonna hurt you Tony." Steve said softly and with way too much care in his voice than he had any right to have.
"And neither of those possibilities are good, either there were different attackers or for whatever reason they went easier on Hawkeye." It did make him wonder about why an attacker would go easier on one man and not others. The reasons why weren't exactly good to look at though.
"Okay I'll come round tomorrow with Bucky, I should let you get some sleep it's getting late." Steve said getting up.
When the door closed behind the two of them Tony didn't know what to do. He wanted to drink this whole night away but he had arrangements to make if he was going to make it to Wakanda by tomorrow.
"Tony I didn't leave you to die, I thought you'd be able to get home, I thought FRIDAY would have known to send you a jet or help or something." Steve pleaded, which at least sounded a little bit better than his non-apology, apology letter.
"I know sometimes it's out of your control but you really should try Tony." Steve said reaching up like he was about to touch Tony but then stopped and put his hand back down. He wished he didn't feel guilty about that, it wasn't his fault, it was Steve's and Barnes but Steve always had this kicked puppy look to him and it brought this weird feeling to see it directed at him.
Steve shrugged. "As has been drilled into my head the last two years, we do live in an area that allows for same-day delivery."
"No," Steve replied and nodded his head at the digs that surrounded him. "I'm gonna poke around here for a bit. See what I've got."
It was right before Christmas. He was home, lying on the couch, dressed like a bum in a Mister Softee t-shit and wearing a red Santa hat on his head. His mother, dressed so impeccably in her blue suit, hair and makeup done, sat at the piano. She was playing that song from
Steve just passed her off and turned to his plate to get back to serving himself his dinner, and Tony held a suddenly fussy Olivia and went to put her on his shoulder—
Natasha nodded, hands on the gurney's side-rail as she watched Tony tend to his newborn, Barnes standing beside her.
"Look, it's already set up. I've got the cake ordered, the guest list finalized, the decorations ready to fill the room from one corner to the other, I even asked the city to put on a nice fireworks show for you—"
Steve stole a quick glance at him, the amber of the passing streetlights reflecting off his face. "How'd you guess?"
Steve opened his eyes and frowned at Tony, but Tony just dipped his finger in the come again and stuck it in his mouth.
Steve motioned to the tree. "Those lights. What are they? I've never seen anything like them. They're so…small…and like a
"Didn't go very far," he said and went over to set the box beside Tony. He tried to take Olivia out of Tony's arms, but Rhodey got there first and said, "Oh, not so fast. You guys get to hold her all the time. It's my turn to hold this spoiled little princess."
He didn't even want to know how or why Steve had suddenly fashioned himself an authority on morning sickness during pregnancy. "Of course it won't. I'll be dead from vomiting before I even have the chance to go through the whole...you know—
The Council members, chastised by a woman they dared not cross, filed into the small room, the last member of which closing the door behind him.
Pepper pointed over to a table across the way, and Tony looked over and spied an older, petite woman with a dyed perm and a pastel gown that was standing there leaning all of her miniscule amount of weight on a quad cane. She looked harmless enough, and so Tony patted Steve's arm and said, "Go get 'em, tiger."
"You know," he said as she moved the coffee table away from the couch and pulled the matching ottoman over, "I'm not supposed to have that much caffeine."
The only light being the moon high above, Tony watched as Steve grinned at him and said, "Yeah, some asshole took down the whole system last year. Really screwed a lot of things up."
"Not really. Only because it's like shooting fish in a barrel. Not really much sport or fun in it. It's too easy," he said, but there was a weird crackle of energy to the air, and he frowned and looked around. "Do you feel that?"
"Yeah? Well, don't get mad if they end up black and charred," Barnes muttered and pushed at them with a spatula.
"Yeah?" he asked, hands on his hips as he leaned over her. "Well, tough shit. The Iron Man suit has more safeguards and protections built into it than all of your armors put together. I'm safer in the suit than out of it. That witch may have taken away whatever choices I can make over my own goddamned body, but she is not taking Iron Man away from me."
credit cards — including an Iron Man red and gold American Express with absolutely no limit that they made special for me — my Blue Cross insurance card, and last but not least," he slapped the last one down, "my Avengers' ID card."
He shrugged and picked his fork back up. "We can always attempt to do something about the marriage-thing."
"Whatever," Rhodey said with a sigh. "I guess I shouldn't be surprised you'd have something like that on the brain when we're talking about Cap."
Tony put his hands up. "I didn't make up the phrase, Steve, and yeah," he admitted and dropped his hands again. "They do. I mean, I guess it would be worth looking into."
"Whatever," he muttered then slapped down the collected trinkets on the island countertop. "Here, I don't actually want these."
"Six weeks, babe. No sex for six weeks. Actually, given how quickly I'm healing according to Brucie, maybe a little less than that."
, I guess," he continued, pretending like he hadn't seen the momentary shift of Natasha's countenance, "but trust me. I can feel it. I can feel everything. I can feel something growing inside of me. I know it's alive, and I know it's A-OK. I don't need to drink a gallon of water and have Bruce poke me in the gut with some medieval torture device in order to know that."
And speaking of Christmas, they were halfway through January already. Wasn't it time for Romanoff and Barton to pull the decorations down already? It didn't matter how festive Thor thought they were. Who wasn't even there and hadn't been since New Year's, anyway.
There was a series of pictures after that, one a stunning portrait of those two young women with the familial resemblance standing back-to-back in front of a solid white background, long hair perfectly coiffed for 1967, makeup done and giving the camera their most beguiling looks. Below that was a series of photographs that showed them in various stages of cracking up or making funny faces at the camera. The last photo was of them standing close to one another, grinning as they held a toothy-smiled toddler between them, cheeks pressed together, the little girl's dark hair pulled up in little pigtails. Tony stared at the photo a moment then turned to read the caption beside it.
Tony just nodded and slumped against him, closing his eyes and thinking that he was so lucky he had Steve. Steve had the market on comfy super-soldier shoulders to rest on.
She laughed and let her hand fall from his face, her fingers lightly tracing over his cheek as it did so. "You still have so much to learn," she said, but there was an odd note of fondness to her voice. "All right, Man of Iron," she said and stepped away from him. "If you wish it to be so, I will change you back. I only ask one thing of you."
He was finally allowed to go back up to the penthouse once Bruce felt that the threat of hemorrhage or anything of the kind was over. He'd thought it would be a relief to be able to go up there and relax with his newborn in his arms, but upon being wheeled onto the floor (Bruce had snagged him a wheelchair for transport like the good doctor that he was but kept insisting that he really wasn't), he felt Steve's ghost — for an entirely different reason than his supposed 'death' — like a weight on his chest.
"Steve's the kind of guy that can't always see the forest for the trees, you know? He doesn't see something that's right in front of him at times. I used to think the bastard wouldn't know happiness if it bit him in the ass, and what I see with you two, I
"Yeah, I get that," Sam said, turning to face him. "But I'm just saying you can buy a kid too much crap in theory. But, I mean, it's different when it's your cute little niece."
"It wasn't so much the initial hit as the fight he got into afterward," Natasha added, and Tony groaned and rolled his eyes.
" Steve murmured in insult behind him, but Tony scowled at Barton and the rest of the quickly-departing moochers and was about to open his mouth to tell them he was happy to see the backs of their heads because they spent too much time up there eating him out of house and home anyway, but they all left the kitchen, talking amongst themselves as they headed for the elevator.
Thor shook his head. "It is not that simple. The Goddess Esmeralda cast the spell upon you to turn you into that form. Only she can reverse it to turn you back into the form that you once were."
He groaned and rolled his eyes. "Fucking moochers," he muttered then glanced back at the fridge, remembering why he'd even left his seat to begin with — the one Thor had currently settled his regal ass into. "Hey, any of you know why there's a blue sticky on the fridge?"
He shrugged. "Wasn't sure why anyone would care that much. I'm just a kid from Brooklyn. Nothing all that interesting about me."
He was sure someone had tried to dig up some information about how he was really locked away in some facility, hooked up to machines that were keeping him alive — either because of a botched suicide attempt (
He yawned a little and sat up, and though he was content to lay in bed a little longer and take advantage of the peace and quiet, he got up and stretched a little more, feeling sore and used but in the most fantastic way imaginable. There was much to be said for a good round of sex, but a good round of sex with someone you loved more than anything?
But separated from those, sort of on their own little branch, were the two that were supposed to look like Captain America and Iron Man, facing each other, almost looking like they were supposed to be kissing. He didn't know who had done the decorating, but he had to believe they'd been put this way on purpose, and it was kind of cute, if he was being honest with himself. He wasn't sure if hanging them right above the 'Baby's First Christmas' ornament was intentional or not, but even if it wasn't, he had to believe there was a reason it had been done that way, why all of this was...
"You stay home with me 'n' Maddie, but if the 'vengers need Iron Man, then you go down in your lab and you do it 'motely, 'n' Maddie 'n' me hafta be real quiet 'n' not cause trouble when you do that 'cuz y' hafta concentrate."
Because he knew through it all that that asshole Barton was right. He was Steve's princess. He had Steve wrapped around his finger, and whatever baby wanted, baby got. Maybe Steve idealized him or revered him too much — maybe he put him on too much of a pedestal — but he hoped that if there ever came a time that he suffered a fall from grace that Steve would still be standing there when the dust settled, ready, willing, and able to help him back up and brush the dirt off.
"Always," Tony said, not exaggerating in the least. He held out his arms, and Natasha carefully handed the baby over, smiling softly and cooing at her yet again as she made the exchange.
He went to make his way over to the elevator, and Tony called out, "What if it starts coming before then?"
She just shrugged, her gaze cast down to her sandwich, but Bruce could tell the words had gotten through and had been much appreciated by her.
In any case, he was not ever being put into a position to deal with Tony Goddamned Stark, that was for damned sure.
, if you get my drift. It's cool. I get it. I don't blame you. Sink your teeth into some of that nice,
"Well, it's such a welcoming atmosphere," Barton said. "It's like a birthday party you never want to leave!"
Tony groaned. "Babe, believe me, you didn't take advantage of me. I wanted it just as much as you. Clearly we were idiots about the whole thing, but we've been known not to be able to think straight around each other from time to time — no pun intended. It is what it is, and we can't go back and change time, as far as I know, so we have to figure out some way of dealing with this."
"As I have said many a time, it is the bond that they share," Thor said, but that was all Tony heard. He leaned forward into Steve, his hands on either of Steve's biceps, and opened his mouth, allowing Steve to sweep his tongue in. He moaned a little at the force with which Steve pressed in and plundered his mouth, taking and claiming him for his own like he had so many times in the past, and it wasn't until he heard the tiny burp of a baby that he was startled back to reality.
They got down to the nitty-gritty after that, the nurse or whatever she was bombarding them with information — god, so much information. In fact, Tony was 99.99% certain he now knew more about the birthing process than he'd ever wanted to know.
"I just want to stress that," Tony said as they walked, hand-in-hand, along the side of the country road in one of the bumfuckiest parts of New York State. If he was being charitable and objective, he would say it was a gorgeous spring Saturday with blue skies and fluffy white clouds and the sun shining brightly above them. The trees and overgrowth that lined the roadway were budding and blossoming, shocks of bright green overtaking the last vestiges of winter brown. Birds chirped in the near distance. It was as quiet and peaceful and contenting as could possibly be, and maybe under better circumstances, he could enjoy it a little more.
"I thought you said 'together,' Steve? You and me, together? You said that's how we would deal with this. You promised, Steve."
Tony made a face at that. "They're not going to make me wear frilly shit and get frilly drinks all night, are they? I mean, don't get me wrong. I'm totally intrigued by the idea of a girls' night, and I'd like to see how one really goes down, but they both know I'm still a guy, right?"
The elevator dinged and the doors slid open, and as he put one foot out, he heard the unfortunately familiar voice of someone that he was totally going to lock out of the floor one of these days.
from an alternate universe — a universe where Steve Rogers wouldn't just be attracted to a man but would actually
"It looks like it hurts," she said and turned his wrist over to inspect it more fully, but he shrugged.
Steve's heart thudded hard against his breastbone, but he was able to get control over himself and scowl at Natasha. "Don't say it like that."
"We have those pajamas," he said. "Clint got them for us. I remember you said you went out and bought a dozen pairs so we'd never run out."
