“This is so cool! Is this your only car or...no wait, you probably own thousands of cars! What’s that like? Are they all like this? Do they drive themselves? Do they-”
He plops down in a chair at his workbench and turns in it, brows furrowing as he slips the paper out of the envelope. He skims through it, reading through the printed words until he finds what he’s been waiting for.
“You okay?” Tony asks, his voice capturing Steve’s attention and he peers up at him, forcing a smile to hide his hurt.
His death was sudden. There had been no warnings. No one had a chance to prepare for it. Tony can only imagine what his son’s suffering through. He wonders if Peter at least got to say goodbye. Probably not. Steve wouldn’t allow him to tag along on dangerous missions. He wonders if Steve held on just long enough to say goodbye. God he hopes so.
Tony sighs and glances down at the crumbs decorating his shirt and rug. “Well, that failed,” he mutters.
“Hey.”Steve places both hands over Peter’s shoulders. “I’m coming back. I promised. Do I ever break my promises?”
The drink burns as it goes down, but it doesn’t compare to the discomfort he’s already suffering through. Tony takes another drink from his glass until it’s empty. He tells himself just one for tonight, but it’s a lie. Pretty soon he’s going to drag his ass off the couch and toward the bar.
Sam smirks. “Were you a mess? Did you actually cry for me?”
“I should’ve known. And here I was thinking I was just a skilled foot rubber.”
But the kid is gone now. And Tony only has himself to blame.
Steve sniffs and nods again. “Okay.”
He wanted everything with his dad to be perfect. He wanted to have movie nights with him, train to one day become a part of the Avengers, go to Disney World. All the things he had done with his papa was what he wanted with his dad.
Sam offers Tony a beer and he accepts it. Sam cracks one open for himself and takes a sip, his eyes never leaving Tony.
The bruises and wounds sustained from the abuse healed over time, but the damage from the emotional and mental abuse never does.
“But not everyone experienced what we did.”
“Hey, kid, what’s up?”
Clint was on the boy side which of course earned him a smack from Natasha. But even that wasn’t enough to convince him otherwise.
After everyone leaves and it’s just the two of them again, Steve surprises Tony by remaining on the sofa instead of retreating back to their bedroom. Tony sits down beside him and pulls him close.
Steve huffs and takes the sunglasses off, slipping them over the front of his shirt. “I just...what if someone sees us?”
“Maybe.”
“God, honey, I’m so sorry. I never should’ve left.”
Tony smiles and cups Steve’s face. “You were in control.”
He gets scared again. He wasn’t prepared for his son’s arrival and he only had a few more weeks until Peter would be blessing them with his presence.
Peter clenches his fist until he’s sure he’s drawn blood from hard he’s digging his nails into the flesh. He glares up at the stone face of his father.
“Yeah,” Tony nods and sets the tablet to the side. “We should.”
“He’s all yours, Pete,” Happy says, making sure his hand squeezes Flash’s shoulder. “He knows not to try anything.”
Peter takes a deep breath to calm himself, then as casually as he can, makes his way over. He stops when a larger man comes out from the building to greet his dad. They’re talking about something Peter can’t quite hear as they make their way up the steps and toward the doors.
Steve brings her close, unable to hold back his tears of happiness. She was finally here.
Peter shakes his head. “No. I don’t want them to. He left it this way and I don’t want to mess it up.”
She huffs out a small laugh and hangs her head, shaking it in a way that makes Steve believe he did something wrong.
I’ll update soon!
“Being an Avenger is tough,” Tony agrees and he leans against the island and folds his arm over his chest. “A lot of sacrifices need to be made. He sacrificed Disney World I guess.”
“Papa, stop talking about food,” Peter groans when his stomach grows queasy again. He groans again and wraps his arms around his midsection.
“Remember that party?”
Tony grumbles a response Steve can’t quite decipher, then with a heavy sigh, he’s laying down his tools and turning around in his seat to face Steve. Steve smiles softly at him and reaches out to wipe away the bit of grease on Tony’s cheek.
“But alphas are supposed to knot…”
There was only one way to find out.
“I didn’t know.”
Peter giggles happily and stretches his arms out for his daddy. Tony takes Peter into his arms and cuddles him close while he talks about his day. It’s Steve’s turn to stare and smile at the scene in front of them.
“Great. I’m thinking pizza. We don’t even need to leave the house. Hey, J, place an order will you? You know what I like.”
“Don’t ruin it or I swear to God-holy fuck!” Tony cries out, his fingers wrapping around the plastic snack bag and squeezing the contents until they’re a blue mush. He groans and tips his head back. “Fuck, that one kinda sucked.”
There’s no pictures of the funeral service, but the news footage shows the heartbroken citizens mourning the loss. A few of them are holding gifts and lit candles to place for a memorial.
“It’s just for a few minutes.”
“I’m going to check on them again,” Steve says, rising to his feet and adjusting his shirt before heading toward the door.
He’s having a pup. A pup Hydra wants to use and control. They would treat it like some sort of puppet. This pup, like the others, was in danger.
He can make out the sound of Tony’s voice but he can’t comprehend the words. Steve tunes the voice out completely, too engrossed on his current task. The baby inches closer and more of her head appears. Steve places both feet on the dash and spreads his legs as far as he can.
Tony growls and props himself up on his hands, leaning in to nose around Steve’s neck and tease his bond mark. Steve moans louder, his body shuddering when the sensitive place on his neck is touched. Tony bites down on the mark, and Steve comes with a scream, his body growing taut and his cock spilling between them.
“About time,” Bucky tells the god. “And would it kill you to have a normal entrance? You’re scaring my kid.”
A pent up rage ignites and burns inside Tony. He struggles against the firm grip Bucky has on him. Bucky doesn’t even fight back, his hold still strong.
Peter stands awkwardly in the doorway, his cheeks pink with embarrassment. “I can go…”
“You told me no more babysitting!”
“Ah. Where is he?”
The alert from JARVIS is what jolts Tony awake. Tony grumbles and buries his face back into the pillow, inhaling the familiar and comforting scent of his husband. He had grown used to sleeping near Steve to the point where he required him if he wanted to get any sleep. Now that he was pregnant and falling asleep before eight, he didn’t rely so much on his husband’s presence, but he still missed the warmth and security only Steve could give.
“Stop, stop I don’t need to hear it.”
I’m so glad you all are loving this story! I know Tony’s a huge pain in the ass but this chapter isn’t about him this time haha. Steve gets to be with his son and move on from Tony. Tony’s missing out 🤦♀️
“This is Peter, Dodge,” Steve explains, “don’t worry. He won’t hurt you.”
“Morgan needs you.”
Steve can only nod and he searches for the spot on Tony’s neck that releases the most of his scent, nosing around until he finds it. He inhales deeply, finding comfort almost instantly. It’s crazy how the small hint of coffee transports him back to the days when it was just the two of them, spending early mornings in the kitchen and being close to each other. Life had seemed so simple then. Back then they had been free.
Happy is busy at the island preparing a plate, and he peers up when he notices Steve’s presence. “Hey. I ordered some food in case you were hungry. Also Tony called.”
Tony rolls his eyes. “I’ve cut back, believe it or not,” he says as he makes his way toward the kitchen and begins searching through his fridge. He returns with two bottles of water. He tosses one to Peter and chugs from the other.
Steve pulls the blankets off himself and turns his body until he’s sitting on the side of the bed. He stops himself from going any further. He didn’t know where Tony was or if he even wanted to talk.
“I’ll protect you,” Steve whispers, leaning down to seal that promise with a kiss.
“I did. I want us to have a family.”
“Which is why I’m so...so fucking angry!”
“Good,” Tony shoots Steve a small smile. “If you need anything just ask Jarvis. I’ll make the meeting quick.”
“I’m fine. It’s nothing.”
Steve doesn’t give up. Everyday he’s writing a new letter and sending it off. He waits for a response, only to receive nothing in return. It’s more pathetic than waiting for a phone call.
“So what now?” Clint asks again before they’re left in more silence. “Who’s taking the shield?”
“I will take care of you. Both of you mean the world to me,” Steve says.
A small groan escapes him when his belly tightens again. The pain is getting worse. The omega gasps, eyes shooting open in surprise when his pants grow wet. His pup would be here soon.
“I’m still happy. Darling, I’m more than happy. I have you and our beautiful kids. That’s all I need.”
Tony steps into the room, a bright smile on his face and a sleeping Peter in his arms. Steve’s face immediately lights up at the sight of them. He had his whole family surrounding him now.
“Steve!” Pepper cries and rushes toward him, embracing him in a tight hug. He hugs back and inhales her scent. Pepper pulls back, leaving her hands on his shoulders as she studies him. “Oh my God! You’re alive!”
“Seem what? I’m exhausted, Tony. So excuse me for not being more cheerful this morning.”
“How did you not know! He was there and you blew up the base anyway.”
Steve is currently in the living room, sitting on the couch and eyes transfixed on the bassinet beside him. Morgan is sleeping peacefully. Steve hasn’t made any contact with her since that night of his latest outburst. Tony’s been having to do a majority of the caring. He was fine with it, but at the same time he hated seeing Steve so distant with their daughter.
“Please, Pete?” Steve turns to begging his son, even though he knows his words have no effect on him. “I don’t know what to do.”
“Strip,” the alpha orders, a smug look appearing over his face. This time Steve does glare at him. “Come on! Hurry up!”
A soft sniffle captures Tony’s attention and he turns in its direction, finding Steve hunched over with his face buried in his hands. His body wracks with sobs. It’s painful to witness.
The doors open and this time the corridor is empty. Heaving a sigh of relief, Tony pushes forward. He keeps the gun raised ahead of him and ducks behind a corner when muffled voices reach his ears. One peek around the corner shows two more alphas and what appears to be a woman in a white lab coat.
His hands roam over Steve’s body, exploring every inch until he’s right where the omega wants him. Steve gasps, back arching off the bed when Tony plays with his cock. No other alpha has bothered to touch him the way Tony was now. They never cared about pleasuring him. They were only takers.
Steve hates the image he sees of himself these days. He doesn’t see the skinny kid from Brooklyn or even the big, tough Captain America. He barely recognizes himself at all.
Steve sighs and rises to his feet. “You’re giving me a lot of breaks.”
Tony helps more, too. With Steve finally giving him an opportunity to help with feedings, he’s able to relieve Steve for a while. It’s difficult to get up throughout the night, but he ignores the exhaustion and cares for his daughter. He wishes he had done more before, but he was doing it now.
“You let me sleep in yesterday,” Steve reminds him, his eyes fluttering open and a tired smile forming over his face.
No one greets Steve the second he pulls up to the house. With a disappointed huff Steve shuts off the ignition and leans back in his seat. He keeps his eyes on the lit up house, hoping that at least one of his pups would run out the front door to greet him.
If such a thing even existed.
Steve almost whines at the idea of having to comply. His body was aching and begging for rest. He pushes himself a little harder, not wanting to disappoint.
“Hey, you okay?”
Tony stuffs the rest of the cupcake in his mouth, then he allows Steve to lead over to the couch where a large pile of gifts is waiting for him. He can't help but whistle at the sight of them all.
Tony can only watch as their friends comfort him. The guilt washes over him again. This was all his fault.
“I don’t want to wait anymore. I love you and I trust you. You’d never hurt me. You’re one of the good ones,” Steve says, his lips forming into a small smile.
His screams of anguish end the heavy silence. He clings tightly to his father, screaming and begging for him to come back. But it was too late. He was gone.
It was going to take a lot more than one training session to get Peter ready to fight along the Avengers. He was just a kid, inexperienced and lacking any of the proper skills to be a part of the team. But Steve knew with the right training that his son would be ready to take his place beside the best.
“Hey, it’s okay,” Tony soothes. “Papa is coming back.”
A cold hand is caressing his cheek, the touch sending shivers down Steve’s spine. He should be grateful Alpha is being kind to him, but deep down he wants nothing more than to stop being touched. He knows what it usually leads to.
“I just need some space.”
“Pep’s good, she says hi. And Happy misses you like crazy. I think I have some serious competition.”
The alpha chuckles. “Is that it? That doesn’t scare me. I know you won’t hurt me. You don’t have it in you.”
“So what did you have in mind, Pete?”
A knock on the door cuts through the retching sounds. Another knock follows not even a minute later, and then the door is opening.
“How did he do last night?” Steve asks, glancing down at Peter for a moment when he squirms, then his eyes are back on Tony’s.
“Hi. Wow, I don’t think I’ve seen you this tired.” Pepper teases. Tony can’t help but roll his eyes. “It’s hard, isn’t it?”
There’s a moment of silence before the lock clicks and the door opens. Sad, brown eyes are staring up at Tony. It’s a heartbreaking sight.
He knows the kitchen still has boxes that need unpacking, but spending time with Peter felt more important. Steve hadn’t decided if he wanted to hang up the shield and pass on the Captain America title to someone else, but the more it crossed his mind, the more he found himself leaning toward the idea of retiring.
Tony could only guess. He had missed so much, and he only had himself to blame.
Tony turns back to his daughter, making sure she’s calm enough before gently placing her back in her crib. She doesn’t stir or fuss and Tony feels he’s able to walk away to give his husband attention.
At the sound of the unfamiliar and disembodied voice, the three pups react fearfully and rush to hide. Harley crawls into Tony’s lap, climbing up the alpha until he can hide his face in Tony’s neck. Sarah clings to Steve tightly and hides her face as well. James shies away behind Steve’s legs.
“You’re not doing anything stupid,” Happy hisses. “I won’t allow it. No more stupid things. You’re banned.”
“You’re not fine! You’re having a baby!”
Panic begins to set in. Tony wonders what he did wrong this time.
“I’m sorry. I’m being weird aren’t I? Put me to work. I’ll do anything.”
“You need to rest,” Steve reminds him and he steps into the room. Tony peers up at him and sighs. “I mean it. How do you expect to get better?”
His smile quickly falters when his belly tightens again. He places one gloved hand over the area, eyes squeezing shut in discomfort. He breathes steadily through it until it’s tapering off.
“Alpha or omega?”
Steve makes himself comfortable anyway. The small bag Tony packed for him needed to be unpacked. It only takes a few minutes considering he had only had a few items in it. Tony promised they would do a proper shopping trip for both himself and the baby.
The mansion didn’t compare to the penthouse back in New York, didn’t even come close. It’s too big for Steve’s liking. He felt too small inside of its large walls. For a split second he begins to miss the penthouse.
Not a day goes by when he’s not thinking about him. Steve never said where he went or what he’s doing. Tony understood. If the roles had been switched, Tony would choose to hide away too. He was a monster. A killer. Just like Steve said.
“I thought I’d find you two here,” Steve says. Tony turns around and smiles. Steve steps into the room, his eyes scanning around the space his son would soon call his own.
Tony places another kiss to the sensitive area before backing away to kiss Steve’s lips again. His hands explore Steve’s body, feeling every ripple from the firm muscle underneath. Steve’s chest is softer and more sensitive; just a small touch is enough to have him moaning and his back arching.
babies. Jesus. What are we gonna do now? We didn’t buy double of anything. Where’s this kid supposed to sleep?” Tony asks.
Tony leaves the room and shuts the door behind him. He leans against the wood and a large breath blows past his lips. It takes him a moment to compose himself and wrap his mind around the exchange that he just had. It was hard to believe that his son loved him. How could he after all the hurt he’s caused? Tony still didn’t understand it. And he probably never would.
“Submit!” Brock growls and presses Steve’s head against the wall. Steve struggles against the weight pinning him down, refusing to obey the order. He screams when nails dig into the side of his head. “Do it! Now!”
“Anything?”
He jumps when he senses someone else with him and his head snaps up in the direction of the doorway. His aunt smiles at him.
“You’re an omega?” Steve finds himself asking. “But I thought…”
“Tony, I swear if you’re-” She begins to say, only to stop herself and peer up. Her eyes go wide in surprise. “Oh my God!”
“Listen, kid-” Tony begins and Peter cuts him off.
“So far everything they’ve done screams good guys. Pepper helped them.”
“Don’t get any ideas. You already knocked me up,” Tony teases and begins stripping Steve from his uniform. He starts with the belt, his memory playing back the scene of them struggling with it just this morning. “I don’t know why you have to be so stubborn,” Tony complains as he works on removing the dirty boots. They hit the floor with a thud.
“Fuck…” Tony’s body seizes up, his hips stuttering as he fills Steve up. He continues to thrust until every last drops has been released.
“Stop. Sam, you didn’t know.”
Maybe it was time he spoke with Alexander Pierce again.
Tony sighs and pauses his work. “Sorry. I just couldn’t sleep. You know me, always building instead of sleeping like a normal human being.”
Steve smiles and comes over, then he leans down to greet Tony with a kiss. “You miss me?”
“Daddy, again!” Harley exclaims, his eyes full of excitement. He’s not the only one. His older brother is just as excited to see their father blow up something else.
“Obviously.”
Natasha’s eyes fill with tears and she shakes her head at his command. A hand is reaching out, fingers wrapping around her wrist and she glances up, meeting soft, blue eyes.
“Trouble probably. He definitely looks like that type.”
“True. You already have one invisible Stark. You don’t need another.”
“Did it mean anything?” Steve asks.
Peter is still sitting on the sofa when Tony returns, and he jumps up, a smile forming over his face at the sight of Morgan.
Steve makes another painful sound and rolls over onto his side, hoping the change of position would alleviate the pain in his back. Bucky reaches out to rub along Steve’s lower back, emitting a small moan from his friend.
“What happened?” He asks, the worst coming to mind.
“No, worse than that. It wasn’t just daily beatings. Steve was treated like property. The pups he had were forced.”
Tony remains silent.
“He’ll need this, right?” Steve asks, gesturing to a white and gray bassinet. He flips the price tag around, brows furrowing slightly at the large number he finds. Leave it Tony to spoil their son with the best baby items on the market.
“Swing?” Tony questions, his brow raising.
“Yeah, I know. I just don’t want Pete to turn into a spoiled brat. Not that I was one or anything.”
Peter starts walking, then he turns around to say, “Just make sure you text back.”
Tony sighs and leans forward, clasping both hands together and rubbing them for a moment. “He does. I hate to admit it but he does. He’s not the same anymore. And I missed all the signs. How the hell did I do that?”
“Didn’t we already establish that we didn’t know how to break up?”
He drums his fingers on the steering wheel as he waits, an exasperated sigh leaving his lips when the traffic barely moves. He sends a quick message to Steve, hoping FRIDAY would relay it if Steve was too busy to answer.
Tony keeps a close eye on him, not wanting to blink and find that he’s lost his husband too. Deep down he knows Steve won’t end it all, but he’s still cautious and always hovering just in case.
Tony rocks slowly against Steve, pressing his body even closer. One arm is wrapped around the omega, the palm of his hand cradling his belly. He presses kisses and tender bites along Steve’s shoulder, trailing higher until he’s reaching the sensitive skin on his neck. Steve whines when his bond mark is nipped at. Tony smirks against the marked flesh and places soft kisses there.
“You won’t,” Sam assures.
Natasha refuses just like he knew she would. “I’m not leaving you.”
Tony had been ready to stop ignoring the calls and letters and go back to Steve, to tell him how he really felt and see if there was a chance of them starting over. But that had all come crashing down when he discovered Steve had chosen Barnes.
“And then we drove around in this really cool car! But that’s not even the best part! We went to his tower! I know you said it’s a big ugly building, but it’s so cool! We went inside his penthouse and-oh my gosh he has everything!”
“You don’t have to say,” Tony says, sensing his son’s hesitation. “I know he probably hated my guts.”
“Not like this,” Steve winces again, “it really hurts. I think something’s wrong.”
“Don’t mention it. Come on. I’ll show you where you’re sleeping.”
“The time is currently 5:10 PM. Mr. Stark has also sent you a message.”
“Nah,” Sam disagrees. “He’s going to talk to Steve.”
But now that he has it and no AI on his side, Tony feels even more lonely than he did before shutting himself in his penthouse.
“Do I get to be a part of the next mission?” Peter asks, unable to keep the giddiness out of his tone.
“Fuck.” Tony grunts and fucks Steve through his orgasm, his own approaching. All it takes is a few more deep thrusts until he’s reaching his own release and spilling inside Steve.
“Okay,” Peter nods and he follows his dad to the door and grabs his backpack. “You don’t have to drive me. I can...swing.”
Tony rises to his feet and bends down to give his son a kiss on the head, then he leaves the room in search of his missing husband. That uneasy feeling in the pit of his gut returns, and despite Tony’s best efforts to push aside the feeling, it can’t be ignored.
Tony groggily lifts his head. “That’s it? Fuck you.”
Bucky snaps his head up at those words, the color from his face draining and eyes going wide. “What?”
Peter sighs heavily and pulls out his phone, his heart sinking when he finds his inbox empty. Would it have killed his dad to at least send him a birthday text? Surely Peter didn’t screw up everything that much.
So when Sam gathers both Peter and Bucky into the living room, he silently prays that their talk goes smoothly. He keeps his fingers intertwined with Bucky’s, squeezing his hand gently to offer assurance. Bucky nods, affirming that he knows to keep cool.
“Tony,” Steve takes the alpha’s hand. “Was it true? Is this too much?”
“Bye. Love you, too.”
“Fuck!” Steve cries out suddenly when that spot inside of him is touched. Tony does it again, this time adding more pressure and rubbing along the bundle of nerves. Steve’s cock twitches and oozes at the tip, creating a trail of precum down the shaft. It’s one of the hottest things Tony has ever seen.
Peter sighs. “We have to talk about it.”
Peter nods and continues to eat his breakfast. He hopes his papa is right.
“Ta-da!”
“Oh,” Peter’s face heats up and he glances at the doctor. “S-sorry. I’m okay I guess.”
“And Iron Man?”
And that’s when Steve notices the words printed on the identical t-shirts his pups are wearing.
“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it. I love you.” He purposely doesn’t say he loves the baby. That would be lying.
Peter does his best to stay calm and hide behind a mask, but his mask has cracks and he knows his papa can see right through it.
“Yeah? You don’t sound so sure.”
“Huh. I never thought about that. I mean I dressed up as Cap when I was a kid. I told you this!” Tony says when he catches the amused look on his husband’s face.
Tony sits up and grabs Steve’s pillow, then he leaves the bedroom and goes downstairs, deciding the couch would be more comfortable than the large empty bed.
Steve turns to glance at the killer that is
Tony rolls his eyes playfully. “Hilarious. Nah, I think I was alright. I was a kid so I wasn’t perfect like you.”
“Over my dead body.”
“Wait, wait. You offered him but not me?”
Peter sighs sadly. “Okay. Do you have to go? I hate when you leave.”
No. Steve wasn’t going to think like that. Not all alpha’s are bad. This one wasn’t like the others. He had already proven that the night of their mating and then again when he offered Steve a place to stay.
“Did he turn green?” Bucky asked with a frown. “You need to just stop at McDonald’s when he wants some. Trust me.”
“Papa?”
They’re both lounging on the sofa in Tony’s lab, stuffed from pizza and soda and no energy to continue any more projects.
“I’m okay.” Tony forces a small smile. “You two have fun. Be safe.”
“I guess. Fine. What about a baby shower? That’s really for Peter so you can’t say no.”
Once the children are in their beds and goodnight kisses have been given, Tony and Steve settle outside on the porch, wrapped in each other’s arms as they enjoy the peaceful evening.
Steve remains locked in his room, curled up on his bed and one arm wrapped protectively around his belly. Tears gather in his eyes at the thought of losing another pup. He’s lost too many in the past and every day he’s forced to live with that pain and guilt. He should have tried harder to keep them safe.
“What? No. No, Tony, you look amazing.”
“This doesn’t look half bad.” Tony smiles proudly at the work they’ve accomplished. The table is set with two dinner plates, utensils, two glasses of water and a bowl of salad in the center. Steve joins him at the table with a plate of garlic bread. “I thought you didn’t know how to cook, Cap.”
“Honey, what’s wrong?” Tony asks, coming over toward his husband and laying a hand over his shoulder. “Morning sickness?”
Steve huffs. “Sometimes I think you’re just a child. A really big child in a man’s body.”
With Happy gone, Tony decides to get more information out of the omega. Steve hasn’t bothered to sit down, and instead he waits quietly for Tony to return to him. It’s not until Tony is offering him a seat again does he carefully lower himself down on the sofa. Tony joins him.
Bucky rolls his eyes and gets up from the sofa, stretching and groaning when his back pops. “I don’t know about you idiots but I’m starving.”
“Look!” Peter quickly pulls out the photo, making sure to glance around his shoulder to make sure no one was paying them any mind. No one was. They were losers and easily got lost in the crowd. For once Peter doesn’t care.
“Pups are good,” Bruce says while he gently feels around Peter’s tummy.
“I know.” Her fingers are in his hair, gently threading through the locks to help calm him down. “It’s not fair and I’m so sorry, sweetie.”
Steve smiles and climbs into bed, his heart fluttering when Peter curls up against him and lays his head on his chest.
Tony sighs heavily. “Five.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He gets as far away as he can from view before firing a string of webs and pulling himself up to the top of the closest building. He takes a moment to compose himself now that he’s away from the tower.
A scream followed by giggles fills the apartment. Steve has to pause preparing breakfast at the sound. He was used to his boys roughhousing, and every time he had to take a moment to give them his undivided attention in case their play fight turns serious. He can recall too many late night emergency room visits.
Steve can’t help but smile at that. “Yeah. This kid’s gonna be spoiled,” he says this with one hand falling to the bump that’s beginning to show.
Peter whips his head in his dad’s direction. “Can we visit him? I always go after school to talk.”
Something about his encounter with Pierce didn’t sit right with him. He thinks about the omega currently waiting for him upstairs, and he wonders that maybe, just maybe he was the one Pierce was looking for.
“Just to make sure everything is okay. Do you know how far along you are? When was the party?”
“We did say when Peter was out of diapers…”
“Allow me.” Alexander rises to his feet and takes the empty glass, crossing the room to get to the bar that is set up. “Would you consider yourself an exceptional alpha?” He asks as he pours the drink.
Tony makes his way over to help. He struggles a bit at first and he curses quietly to himself when he sits down. “Giving birth sucks,” he complains. Peter is still fussing, his face growing red. Steve tries to reach out to calm him, only to retract his hand when Tony gets him in the right position to nurse.
“No, you’re not. You’re not supposed to present or let me take control. This is about you. You’re in control now.”
“They’re resting now but one of the physicians wants to look over them. I need to be there to calm them down,” Steve replies with another sniff.
Tony nods in response to Bruce’s question. “I know it’s horrible. I’ve been kicking myself all morning for thinking about it. He wouldn’t hurt her. That’s not Steve.”
“And I said I’m coming with you. Pete’s old enough to be left alone for a few days.”
Steve doesn’t need him
“Yeah, me.” Tony reaches out to pull Steve back when his boyfriend makes an attempt to get up. “Just ignore him. Or better yet, kick him out.”
Before Tony can ask what Steve means, the door is opening and Happy is stepping in with two cups. He sends a glance in Steve’s way, eyes narrowing.
“I am home.”
Steve nods and continues eating the ice cream. He’ll regret it later, but Natasha was right, ice cream does help. And so do friends.
Thank you so much for the wonderful feedback! The kudos and kind words never fails to put a smile on my face! I wish I could see these two stop being idiots but...yeah that's not happening. We love them anyway :)
Steve crouches down in front of the alpha’s face. “I know you want this,” he says and the alpha’s eyes widen with fear. Pierce struggles again. “Don’t disobey. You want this. You’re only good for one thing.”
Steve blushes and turns away to hide his red face. Tony never failed to give him butterflies.
Peter’s stomach twists uncomfortably. Did his papa know something? Was Peter that obvious?
By the third time Peter wakes them up, neither one is prepared to answer their son’s cries. Steve groans into the pillow when he hears Peter’s crying through the monitor.
“I know. And I know you’d never abandon him. That’s not you. You’re doing the best you can, Tony. No one said any of this was going to be easy, and I hate to say it, but it’s only going to get worse before it can get better.”
“Shh. It’s okay.”
Then he sees him.
“Sounds fun. Wish I could’ve been there but Bruce needed me for something.”
“And risk being punched?”
All Tony can do is awkwardly watch as Natasha comforts his son. He wants to swoop in and console Peter too but he stays back, deciding to let Natasha take this one.
“Fine. Then I’ll punch him. Punch him until he feels like how my best friend felt for the past 15 years!”
“Hi, Petey,” Steve coos. Peter kicks again, this time a little stronger.
“Give up?” Natasha smirks down at her nephew. Peter shakes his head and pulls himself to his feet. He was just like Steve. Defiant and stubborn as hell.
“Tempting, but I’m starving.”
“Of course,” Pepper nods and leaves the room.
And of course she was the most badass spy that ever lived. Peter was lucky to have the famous Black Widow as family. Well, when she wasn’t kicking his ass.
“Hi,” Steve says softly and Tony smiles.
“Daddy!” Peter giggles. “I’m too little to go to work!”
“What?” Tony questions when he catches the bright smile on his husband’s face. The smile Steve wears grows and he comes closer, dropping the lube down beside Tony and placing his hand over the bump. “Ah okay. Junior is making you giddy again.”
Steve punches him again, this time in the eye and the alpha cries out in pain.
“Is this what you and Clint would do?” Steve asks and he helps himself to a big spoonful.
Tony checks on the other pups and then returns to bed. He can’t even be upset about the younger alpha hogging Steve. Their bond was special.
“Yeah,” Steve eventually replies and he lifts his head to shoot Tony a reassuring smile. “That felt so good.”
“‘M close.” Tony presses his forehead against Steve’s, his eyes falling shut. “You feel so good.”
“Thanks.”
“Stop!” Tony yells, fighting again with his own restraints. He goes ignored.
“Yikes.”
“Just don’t tell him he was named after ice cream. He might hate you then.”
“I know, I know. This one is pretty wild.”
“Baby steps. I think we can manage that. We don’t have to start over. We just need to take it slow,” Steve says.
“Can I think this over?” Steve asks, then he quickly adds, “I just want to be sure.”
“They don’t know you.”
Steve has turned away, not wanting to stare into his alpha’s eyes as he is taken like this. But the man above him disapproves of his behavior and forcefully holds his jaw tightly, urging him to look at Tony.
“You missed...never mind.”
“I need you.” Tony leans forward until their foreheads are pressed together. “I want you so bad. And it’s not just because of my rut.”
The front door opens and her papa comes in from his morning run. She never used to understand why he would get up before the sun and workout when she herself would rather sleep, but then she started to get it. She would want an escape too.
“No it is! I swear. He never told you-well, he tried but you didn’t listen. It’s all right here!” Peter quickly removes his backpack and digs through it until he finds the letter. He holds up for his dad to see. “He left this for you.”
“Samantha?”
“Yeah.” Tony nods, then he points at the image of their pup. Steve’s eyes follow and he gasps again, this time because he’s able to see the fluttering of his baby’s heart.
“Maybe you can,” Steve says and he glances back down at Morgan. She’s asleep. He crosses the room and carefully places her down in the crib, then he’s turning toward Tony again. “Maybe you don’t need me as much as you think. What have I done that’s been good? That proves that I’m what she needs?”
Natasha offers to help bake the cake with Peter while Bruce and Sam decorate the common room. Bucky disappears the moment the banner that reads ‘Happy Birthday Steve’ goes up.
I’m so sorry this chapter took me forever! I struggled with it for a while but now I finally got to it and it actually ended up being one of my favorites! Steve gets to kick butt! I’m so proud of him 🥲
There’s a hint of a smile on Steve’s lips, but it never completely forms, and instead Steve is sighing and pulling his hand away. Tony is confused at first, then he hears Morgan.
The thought of calling him again enters Steve’s mind, but then so does the idea of a letter. Steve was old fashioned, there was no point in denying that, and maybe it was time he reached out to Tony in a way he was more familiar with.
But even if his words weren't what Steve wanted to hear, Tony still stood by them. He was still hesitant to be in a romantic relationship with Steve. They had their moments when everything between them was good. But the bad days they had were too much.
“Can we just...do this?” Steve gestures between them. “I like being close to you. And once the baby’s born we won’t really get any time alone and…” Steve’s cheeks are heating up. Was he really suggesting they have sex right now? He had been fine with the cuddling but now he wanted something entirely different. He blames the hormones.
Sam winces. “I’m sorry, man. I get worked up when I hear about assholes like him. It makes me want to kick their ass. I won’t because that’s unprofessional but it doesn’t mean I don’t think about it.”
“I love you, too, Papa.” Peter hugs Steve tightly. He pulls away and gets a good look at his papa’s face, frowning at what he sees. “Why are you so sad?” he asks, reaching out to cup Steve’s cheek.
Peter slips his hand with his father’s, their fingers interlocking. His eyes roam over the wound Bruce is frantically trying to get under control. The blood keeps flowing, and Peter has to turn away.
Tears gather in Steve’s eyes at those words. He’s heard them before.
Steve nods. “Thank you.”
Going on a mission is the last thing Tony wants to do. His son is almost three weeks now and Tony hates the idea of having to leave him and Steve behind.
“She helped, yes. SHIELD has been looking for you for a very long time.”
Steve rises to his feet and moves toward the other toddler bed adjacent to Peter’s. All he can make out is a small form under the pink comforter and messy blond hair. Steve smiles and pulls the blanket back to expose his daughter’s face. He kisses her goodnight and then leaves the room, shutting the door halfway on his way out.
“Wait...Tony-”
Tony had made it clear that he was on board with whatever decision Steve made. The last thing he wanted to do was push. It took time for Steve to stop blaming himself; Tony had to remind him every day that he had nothing to do with their loss.
“It’s not this place,” Steve finally says. The tears continue to fall from his eyes and he frees one arm from around Morgan to reach up and wipe them away. “It’s fine. It’s just...I can’t be here. I can’t.”
“Yeah? I guess they went from enemies to lovers.”
The frown on Tony’s face only deepens. He sets the dish in his hand aside, no longer worried about the mess he created. Steve was more important.
“No,” Steve finally answers. “This wasn’t it. Goodbye, Tony.”
Sarah wakes up, her cries blending in with Steve’s screams of terror. Tony scoops her up and moves her closer to his side of the bed while he attends to his mate.
There was never really a time when Morgan didn’t like her family. She loved them more than anything. They had their moments like all families do. They were far from perfect and some days their imperfections showed, but she loved them nonetheless. Family was important. It was what she was taught.
The closet isn’t all what he expected, but he shouldn’t be surprised either. The ‘humble home’ as Tony liked to call it was anything but and it made sense that his closets would be just as extravagant. The large space reeks of the alpha; it’s impossible to choose what Steve wants to smell first.
“JJ. Jarvis Junior.”
Tony nods. He had another question ready, but he’s afraid to ask it. He’s afraid to know the answer.
“He’s dead, Tony. That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you.”
Peter grows even more excited now that the chocolate has been added. Steve takes the bag away and sets it to the side.
Just a heads up this chapter has some angst but the fluffy stuff is coming!
Bucky sighs and leans against the entryway of the kitchen, crossing his arms over his chest as he watches his nephew color quietly on the floor of the living room. He’s surrounded by a few of his stuffed animals, but it’s the newest bear that he holds close.
The message ends.
Steve smiles brightly and kisses Tony. “I’m gonna make breakfast and then plan this out,” he says the moment they break apart.
No one speaks. If they have something they want to say, it gets lost and the silence wins out. What could they say? Steve was gone and he wasn’t coming back.
“You’ve been well cared for I see,” The alpha says as he carefully examines the omega. “Not a single scratch or ma-”
“Okay…” Tony says slowly. “Is that a good idea?”
He’ll remember her brown eyes forever.
Peter is snapped back to reality when his phone rings. He quickly reaches into his pocket to retrieve it, cursing to himself at the familiar name and picture that appears on the screen. His uncles were going to kill him.
Moving on from Tony was still something Steve found himself struggling with. He hated to admit. It should have been easy after all the pain Tony has caused, but he couldn’t help himself. Tony meant something to him. And maybe that was because of the child they created, but it was deeper than that.
Steve brings her closer, doing everything he can to soothe her. Nothing works. She continues to cry.
Steve huffs. “Pete, please? I’m so tired. Just eat.”
“Doctor, I’m fine. I can’t miss the birth-”
Peter nods. “Okay.”
“I hate them.” James whimpers and tries to pull the blanket over his head, but Tony stops him and lowers it down.
They hadn’t decided on a name for her. Tony liked the name Morgan whereas Steve wasn’t sure what to name their daughter. Tony insisted on calling her Morgan whenever he spoke to her, and eventually he created the nickname and began using that.
The security footage appears, showing a black SUV pulling up the tower’s entrance. Alexander Pierce appears first, followed by a very drunk and stumbling Tony. The image of him is cringe worthy, but he’s seen worse.
“I know and I’m sorry but I figured you guys would need help and-”
“Sorry,” Happy apologizes, but he doesn’t let go. Steve grips his hand tightly when another contraction washes over him. “Squeeze as hard as you like. I can take it.”
“He’s a kid!”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve snaps out of the haze and blinks a few times before glancing down and finding a large puddle of blood. The alpha he’s holding has stopped fighting, his arms limp against his side. Steve removes his hand from the bloody, smashed in head, and Rollins hits the floor with a thud. He was dead.
“He’ll be fine.” Tony assures. He knew how much his boyfriend worried when Peter wasn’t with them. “We’ll be back soonish.”
“Just trust me on this okay? I know what I’m-I kind of know what I’m doing. Right now everything’s good and I’m working on finding him a safe place to lay low. Obviously he can’t stay here forever.”
“But you said you weren’t leaving anymore,” Bucky says.
A gunshot rings out and Tony grunts, staggering forward and finding purchase in Steve’s t-shirt. Steve screams out for him and quickly frees one hand to hold Tony up.
Someone is approaching him, but Peter can’t bring himself to look. A part of him wants to tell them to go away, but the words never form.
“I’m sorry, Alpha.”
It’s hours later when he’s free to go. There wasn’t anything that could be done for him. All he could do was go home and rest.
“Hey,” Tony takes on a warning tone. “Steve was not there. All he did was call me for help and I helped.”
Bucky chuckles and shakes his head. He comes over, making himself comfortable on the cushion beside Steve. “You and your books.”
Steve’s head tosses and turns, his chest rising and falling rapidly. His heart is about to burst out of his chest.
“Out? Like in public…?”
Tony scans the machines and the wires, feeling slightly overwhelmed by it all. He didn’t want to screw up and his son forced to suffer even more. His frustration must be evident because the beta woman is coming closer and assisting with getting Peter free.
“Kinda wishing I didn’t,” Flash says.
“I can’t, Tony.” Steve backs away to put some distance between them. The look on Tony’s face breaks Steve’s heart. It only makes him feel worse. “I’m sorry,” he whispers.
“Maybe now you’ll actually stop drinking. I can’t have you coming home like this.”
“Any bleeding?”
“You did.”
Steve sends Tony a reassuring smile before turning back to his pup, hugging him close and nuzzling him affectionately, drenching the pup in the familiar and comforting scent. James responds with another soft purr.
“I know.” Tony presses his forehead against Steve’s, eyes falling shut and enjoying the closeness. “We can’t.”
“Yeah!” Peter tries to be hopeful. “You’re already the best uncle so being promoted to best dad would be awesome!”
“Well, no but-”
“Sweetheart, you don’t have to ask. I’ll give you whatever you want.”
“Tony…”
“I get that. Then why do this?” Tony gestures to the decorations and the banner, his heart sinking at the words displayed.
He decides to ask those questions later, instead focusing his attention on getting the baby and Steve some care. The facility isn’t equipped for babies. It never occurred to Tony that the team would need such resources. Having children in their line of work was risky and not something that crossed his mind. It was impossible to juggle both.
The omega jumps at the sound of his name and he peers up, finding Tony lingering in the entryway.
He blames his alpha side for the sudden urge. Steve wasn’t just any omega, he was an omega carrying Tony’s pup. They were connected. With or without a bond.
“Okay. I can get that started.”
“Nat,” the man comes back and Steve growls again. They lock eyes for a moment before he turns back to his partner. “Nick ordered a medivac. ETA ten minutes.”
“Okay…” Tony frowns. “I’m sorry, what exactly are you talking about? I don’t remember us meeting at all.”
He doesn’t get very far in the book. He’s exhausted from running on very little sleep. His eyes are beginning to hurt and he catches himself reading the same sentence over and over.
He pulls away and lets his lips hover over Tony’s. It’s tempting to kiss him again, but he holds back. He kisses Tony on the cheek instead and pulls back.
Tony sighs harshly. His usual morning had taken all of the wrong turns. He should be in his conference call right now and then preparing for the new interns to arrive. But instead he finds himself in an isolated conference room with an omega he’s never met.
“One day they will be.”
“Fuck…” Tony moans and his eyes fall shut. The sensation and the sounds of having Steve pleasure him this way is too much. He’s not going to last long.
“I can only go so fast. Do you see the traffic out here?” Happy gestures to the line of cars in front of them. “You’re going to be late. Later than you already are.”
It’s tempting to put her to bed and he gets some sleep, but he’s capable of running on just a few hours of it. He doesn’t disturb her when he gets up to retrieve his tablet, and she remains asleep while he works. It’s difficult to work with only one hand, but he manages.
Steve smiles at his son and reaches out for him, wrapping his arms around his tiny body and bringing him down so that he can kiss his messy brown hair.
“Honey, it’s okay. It’s your body. I’ll support you no matter what.”
See Steve doesn’t need Tony at all! He has his friends and that’s enough.
Morgan doesn’t fuss when Steve straps her into the car seat. He lays a blanket over her tiny form then rushes around the room to grab her diaper bag. He doubles checks the contents and adds a few more items, then he takes Morgan downstairs.
“P-please?” The omega’s voice snaps Tony out of his thoughts. Tony’s not sure if the omega is begging to be touched again or for Tony to leave him alone. The alpha in him decides and Tony finds himself reaching for the omega again, this time placing his hand directly over the omega’s leaking cock. Another gasp and a jerk of his hips has Tony pulling away.
Tony responds by popping open the lid of the lube and covering his fingers generously with it, then leads his wet finger toward Steve’s hole and presses the tip against it. Steve’s body grows taut and his legs struggle to remain open.
“Not exactly,” Sam replies and Peter frowns. “Don’t worry, Pete, you'll get there. But I think you’ll need an outfit first.”
“Uh good. Auntie Nat said I’ll train with her later,” Peter replies. His eyes travel to the other person in the room, growing more and more uncomfortable under the steel blue gaze. “Am I...in trouble?”
Steve groans softly and leans forward to set his tea down, but Tony is faster and urges him to take it.
March 17th, 1983
“The asset’s been secured on base when you’re ready. Currently still in the process of revival, but we’ve got a heartbeat steady, and the equipment is ready.” The awe in the agent’s voice was clear. After nearly forty years frozen in the ice, no one had truly expected such strong life signs to remain, serum induced alpha physique or not.
Tony’s head whipped towards the door that had just been rocked on its hinges. A door made of inch thick reinforced steel that suddenly had the outline of a fist ominously bulging from its smooth surface. God did they-were they using a battering ram?! For a moment nothing else happened, Tony watched with baited breath, hand fumbling to get a firm grip on the wrench. The next hit had the door flying clear off the frame, smashing into the back wall in a cascade of shattered glass as it took out his chemical station. Based on the force needed to wreck that kind of damaged, Tony was expecting some kind of mechanized ram, or at least a team on men the size of Texas. What he hadn’t been expecting was one lone alpha looming in the doorway with bloody knuckles and familiar blue eyes staring right at him. Rogers, his mind supplied as their eyes locked. Those were the eyes of a predator, and Tony was starting to feel distinctly like a rabbit caught in a snare.
“A creep with a line, and some grabby hands. Seemed to know
“Come on eat already, you’re starting to make me feel self-conscious here.” And that was an order. The asset lifted the fork to his mouth reflexively, and was surprised by the sweetness that rolled across his tongue. It must have shown on his face, because Tony smiled with a snort of laughter as if he’d done something funny. Warmth bloomed in his chest at the sight, unfamiliar but pleasant. The asset decided he liked that look. And pancakes. He finished those with militant efficiency, and Tony scraped a healthy portion of eggs onto his plate with a raised brow. Those were soon added to the list of things he liked as well.
“Why?! Because this is
“Hah, I knew it! You work for my dad.” Tony snapped his fingers, sitting back in satisfaction with his assumption. “That getup you’re in, military cut, tight lipped and brooding. Are you on loan from Homeland Security or SHIELD?” Tony guessed with narrowed eyes.
, it is literally freezing outside.” Tony squawked. Was this guy for real? “Look, Ty’s an asshole, but we can’t just leave him here to get hypothermia either.” The alpha turned a skeptical gaze on Ty’s prone figure, but didn’t argue as he knelt to sling Ty over his shoulder…like he weighed nothing…neat. Not what Tony had in mind, but it’s not like they could call the cops. “Gee officer, my on-again-off-again tried getting real fresh with me! Yes, I am aware its late sir. No I don’t think what I’m wearing is relevant sir. I feel the “no” was implied when I told him to fuck off sir.” That conversation would go over real great. More than likely they’d book Batman here for assault before they’d do anything about Ty. Most would probably agree Tony had it coming, known slut and all.
I've got this chapter about as good as I think it's going to get, so hopefully it's some semblance of decent. Steve in particular was kind of difficult the write, so any comments on your take with the characterization would be appreciated. Tony's dialogue is more entertaining to write, but there is a lot of conflicted internalized sexism he's processing that I'm not sure always comes off how I was intending. Regardless, I hope those who choose to read this enjoy. Thanks to everyone who left comments and kudos for the prologue! I love getting feedback, and it definitely motivated me to get this first chapter finished within a week. I hope everyone enjoys.
“Oh I can think of a few ways to encourage him.” Rumlow leered at the other alpha. “I bet he’d beg for it too, with those doe eyes and pouty lips he’s always showing off. God just look at him, his ass is just asking for in those jeans.” He picked up the photo of the target sprawled out on a tiled floor. The position left his shirt rucked up to his midriff, and had looked distinctly uncomfortable for his neck. The asset’s orders were not to be seen, but as the target was clearly unconscious, he had not noticed as the asset lifted and rearranged him in the tub. That left his neck properly supported. The asset also locked the door before climbing back out the window. It would leave the target more secure before extraction. Rumlow made a noise deep in the back of his throat, something rumbling and vaguely possessive. No, the asset did not like Rumlow, he thought, a sharp hot flash sparking in his chest, violent in nature.
Peter shrugs. “I guess. I ate a little bit this morning.”
Though Steve nods his head, there’s still some hesitancy. Tony gets it. There were points in his life when he had been told similar things, only to not believe them. How could he when he felt there was no hope for him?
“The baby,” Steve quickly explains. “I think he just-he just moved! Sam, he’s moving.”
“Okay, okay. No need to get defensive. I just thought it was weird. I mean what else can it be? You don’t gain weight.”
“Just like that?”
“And here I was thinking it was blue.” Steve smiles back.
“Mama’s not gonna be happy,” Tony tells his son and adjusts Harley in his lap. The toddler smiles and claps his hands happily when Tony boots up his computers. Tony smiles and kisses the top of Harley’s messy, gold hair. “You better sleep good tonight then.”
His upper half is mostly clear from any bruises, but his middle is what captures his attention. The small curve of his belly is discolored. Steve brushes his fingers against one of the bruises there, hissing through gritted teeth from the tenderness.
“Yeah. We don’t have to talk about it. It’s not a good time.”
Tony is snapped out of his thoughts when the car behind him honks. He hadn’t realized the traffic was moving at a faster rate and there was now a large gap between him and the car in front. Tony moves forward, pleased to find that the heavy traffic was clearing. He still would be late, but not as late as he originally thought.
“Why? Tony, what’s going on? What does Jarvis mean?”
“I feel good.” Steve smiles and digs into his pancakes.
“I thought the party was for Pete?”
Peter nods.
Now...Tony wasn’t sure what was going on inside his husband’s head, and if he was still truly excited about their daughter.
“Bye, kiddo,” Tony ruffles his son’s hair on his way out.
Steve waits to continue, only his body has other ideas and it bears down against his own volition. He whines through gritted teeth when the burning sensation between his legs worsens. His palm is still cupping the small head. More of his pup emerges, sliding out to its shoulders. Steve tilts his head back and pants, desperately wanting a break from the excruciating pain.
Thank God for the damn cat.
“But I am, Tony. Me not being there means I’m missing important milestones. What if I miss her first steps or first word?”
Peter nods and chews slowly, then once his mouth is clear, he goes back to eating. With his son fed, Tony moves on to cleaning up the kitchen, not wanting Steve to wake up to it and scold him for it.
Tony doesn’t want to listen. He wanted nothing more than for Steve to still be alive. Maybe things would be different if he were. Maybe Tony would’ve came back sooner and made amends. He wonders if Steve would’ve accepted him back so easily.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I don’t want to talk about this. Can we-please?”
Sam whistles. “I forgot how strong you are. I didn’t study you as much as Riley did but I know some things. It’s a serum, right? It makes you this really big, strong dude?”
Tony slept more these days, which was to be expected. His body was working hard to care for the life they created. Tony of course wasn’t used to being this tired. Staying up for hours came easy to him when he was working in the lab. But now that he was pregnant his body was constantly drained and demanding sleep. Steve was pleased because it meant Tony was finally going to bed at a decent time.
“Did you-you’re-we’re ...we’re having a baby?” Sam asks.
“Love you more!” Peter calls after her.
“You didn’t mean it. That wasn’t you, remember? That version of you doesn’t exist anymore, and she knows that. Look how happy she is now that you’re home. If you never came home…” Tony pauses, a shaky breath leaving his lips. He couldn’t even begin to imagine Steve not being around anymore. He thought their separation was difficult, and it was, but losing Steve for good would be worse. He was thankful Steve’s attempt at taking his life failed. He needed Steve. Morgan needed him more.
The meeting is cut short when Tony’s phone chirps in his pocket. He fishes it out, trying to hide his grin when he sees Happy’s name and face over the screen. He answers the incoming video call, already expecting Happy to yell at him. Sure enough, the beta’s irritated voice fills the room.
Steve had done everything for Peter and had been there for most of his life. Tony’s only been in the kid’s life for a few days. He didn’t compare to Steve. He never would.
“Thanks,” Peter smiles weakly and tries to stand. Steve is faster and helps him up to his feet, and leads him over to the vanity so he can freshen up.
“All the time. Pete will be with me.”
“Do it,” the alpha urges.
“I’m sorry! I’m so sorry! I- I didn’t mean it. I swear I didn’t mean it. Alpha, I’m sorry!”
“Which was?” Steve raises a questioning brow.
“I do,” Tony repeats. “I thought I could pretend that what I was feeling for you didn’t exist, but I can’t deny it anymore. I love you. I’ve always loved you. I was an idiot and I’m sorry. I should’ve been honest with you up front.”
“Oh.” Steve frowns and glances down at his lap. He places a hand over his swollen middle. It doesn’t go unnoticed by the alpha.
“She is. Oh wow. Can I-” Tony trails off and Steve nods.
“He’s losing too much blood,” Bruce says, the words bringing Peter out of his seat in seconds.
Anyway! I will update soon!
It’s a little over a year when they decide to give it another try. Steve had been hesitant at first, and honestly he had every right to be. He was the one who experienced the severe trauma and guilt from the loss. But time and support had aided in his healing. He was never going to fully heal from the experience, but he had to try and move on.
“Yeah!” Peter lifts his head and exclaims. “Lots and lots of chocolate chips!”
The Stark-Rogers household is in chaos. Tony is running late for a meeting and both kids still need to get dressed for their first day of school. It was a big day for everyone; Tony would be signing over his company to Pepper so that he could be at home more and the boy’s were taking the first steps on the road to independence. It was bittersweet.
“Why?” His head cocked like a confused puppy. The move was kind of adorable with bright blue eye exaggerating the move, but Tony was too incensed to acknowledge the wayward thought.
I also want to take a minute to thank all the lovely people who left comments and kudos! The comments in particular are addictive creative crack that kept me motivated to find time to write for this, even when other projects vie for attention. I really enjoy hearing your thoughts and predictions for the story, so please feel free to keep them coming. :)
“Uh no, see here’s where we’re gonna hit a bit of a snag big guy. I’ve hit my fucking quota this week for being yanked around and manhandled, so I’m not going anywhere until I get some damn answers. Understand.” Tony bit out, digging in his heels and trying to pull his hand from Rogers’ grip.
“Oh course Sir.” Jarvis replied warmly. “Now let’s open at least one birthday present before your guests arrive shall we? We can pull our public armor on afterward.”
was different. Tony still remembered Gary Ullen, a boy he’d grown up rough housing and playing Captain America and the Howling Commandos with, trying to lead him on the dance floor in a spectacularly awkward waltz. Gary tried to cop a feel, and Tony may have stepped on his toes. Accidentally of course.
“Shit!” Rumlow cursed, foot lifted from Tony once again. Tony didn’t see the other agent go down, so much as hear the bone crunching as he hit the wall beside him. The sounds of a scuffle raged around him as Tony tried to crawl out of the way. The snarls of the alpha brawl growing more feral until someone screamed. Tony twisted up to his knees in time to watch Rogers, hands bloody, pound Rumlow’s skull one, two, three times. Tony caught sight of Rumlow's battered mess of a face before Rogers dropping him like a sack of garbage. Blue eyes searched out Tony once again. This time they reminded him of the photograph in the bar.
“Nope.” Tony cut off quickly, in no mood to talk to Obie about the trash fire that was his love life
“And the roommate?” The handler, Garret he remembered, pressed.
Author's Note:
Blue eyes flashed as the alpha turned around to look at him, scenting victory, and for one terrifying moment, Tony was gripped by an involuntary fear that this new alpha was about to try and take his turn. He’d heard stories about that kind of thing, Alphas high on their own hormones after a fight and grabbing the closest omega they could find to go to town. Tony had always thought it was a load of shit. Who would just stand there and let themselves be used like that right? In that moment though, Tony thought he understood. The urge to kneel and bare his neck in pacifying submission was overwhelming.
DUM-E’s recovery time ended up being better than Tony’s. His stupidly brave little bot rolled right up to the intruder, dousing him with CO2. Those sharp eyes finally left Tony to look at the offending bot, and for a moment, Tony watched in horror as the alpha reached his hand out toward the bot. Oh God, was he about to rip DUM-E apart with his bare hands?! “Leave him alone!” Tony shouted before he could think it through, chucking whatever he could get his hands on from the prep table at the alpha trying to attack his bot.
parents for Christmas. Omega liberation was all well and good at charity benefits for Howard Stark, but heaven forbid his own omega son start spreading his legs. What would people say? Needless to say, both of their families were pretty convinced Tony and Rhodey’s apartment was some kind of covert love nest, because obvious an alpha and omega could never be just friends or live together without banging.
“That’ my dad. Call me Tony or you’re gonna make me feel old.” Nothing on the man’s face changed at Tony’s jibe, so he dropped the pleasantness and jumped straight to the point. “What exactly is this about?”
“Alright come on.” Again with that bewildered look. “I’m hungry, and entirely unnecessary or not, you just punched out my ex. Therefore you get pancakes. The kind with blueberries.” Tony insisted, his scent screaming
“Yeah, I took a look at it, but the weight distribution is all off. You’ll never get that thing to launch properly with that configuration. I’d say you need to change the casing alloy at least. Tungsten's too brittle, but you might try mixing in magnesium.” Tony suggested offhandedly. “And getting someone competent in for your R&D if that’s the best they’re giving you.”
His instincts cried, the air around him reeking with it, and Tony hated himself just a little bit for that weakness.
“You’re in danger. I’m going to protect you.” The alpha rumbled as he hovered into Tony’s personal space. His body language wasn’t threatening exactly, but the sudden closeness left Tony feeling lightheaded. The protective pheromones coming off this guy could drop a fucking horse, and Tony had to fight against his own biology as his muscles tried to relax into jelly.
“I insist.” He replied flatly, tightening his grip as he flashed a badge. “For your own protection, you need to come with me.” SHIELD, Tony registered as he looked over the photo ID and familiar logo. Tony narrowed his eyes, but didn’t protest as the alpha, an Agent Rumlow according to his badge, led him to a secluded table in the back with several other alphas in dark clothes and doing a poor job of masking the scent of their tension.
“Wait, what are you doing?” Tony called out in alarm. He reached his arm out as if Tony could somehow physically keep him there, before dropping it at the ludicrousness of the notion.
“ –the button on the top maybe? Is it working? Okay, make sure to get the floral arrangements in the shot. Tony stop pouting in the corner, or your face will stick that way.” Maria Stark’s voice could be heard before the camera panned away to an utterly miserable looking version of himself at fourteen, tucked and groomed into a three piece cream colored suit accessorized with a pink tie that matched the cake.
“I’ll pass.” The grip wasn’t strong, and Tony tried to pull it away to create some distance between them at the bar. “I’m busy tonight, maybe another time.” Tony added, softening the blow with a tone as close to regret as he could stomach. That part was important though, safer.
“No.” Rogers said sternly instead, deftly dodging Tony’s projectiles, and gripping his hand around the nozzle with the distinctive whine of crushed metal. DUM-E seemed confused by his weapon’s change of state, and chirped nervously as the alpha’s gaze shifted back to his maker. Tony could relate. Wasting no more time on the bot, Rogers stalked forward, and Tony backed up as far as he could until his back hit a wall. “What do you want?” Tony hissed, trying to keep his voice sounding more confident than he felt.
“Who?” Steve blinked, as confused by his own swirling thoughts as he was the direction of this conversation. Steve…no. He was the asset, a weapon. There was no Steve his mind reeled.
There is a scene this chapter with some attempted non-con. (Not between Steve and Tony) Originally, that was not how I'd planned for that scene to go down, but the muse has a mind of it's own.
“Jarvis, cut feed!” Tony choked out abruptly, and the screen went black. Tony wished they hadn’t started with that one, but it had the least corrupted audio, and frankly there just weren’t many Stark family home videos that were unscripted enough for Jarvis to be in them. And wasn’t that just a farce. Jarvis had been the central core of their family, the axis that kept all the wheels in place and turning. The Starks could never have function without him; maybe that’s why they weren’t speaking now that he was gone.
“Yeah, seems to be the popular line today, take a number pal!” Tony growled, shifting to try and put some distance between them. Not that Rogers seemed to be getting the memo, as he nuzzled his head forward to scent Tony neck. It was an incredibly intimate gesture that should have disturbed Tony far more than the embarrassment currently painting color on his cheeks. This was really not helping with the whole jelly thing.
“Why don’t we just grab him already then? It’s not like he’s gonna be much of a challenge.” One of the Alphas on the strike team piped up. Rumlow, the asset’s memory supplied. The asset wasn’t sure he liked Rumlow, which was odd. Weapons did not have feelings or preferences. He was sure he’d been told that before.
, it said
“Let’s see it then.” Pierce rose from his desk, not bothering to waste time with any more idle chatter. He wanted to see for himself the impossible.
Heavy footsteps echoed in the hallway outside his office, the only warning before a winded agent was throwing his door open with a quick saluted. “Sir!” He bit out quickly, chest heaving. Betas didn’t normally give off a strong enough scent for an alpha’s nose to pick up on, but he reeked of excitement. Not that Pierce could blame him. “Report.” He said shooting back the rest of his drink before setting the glass neatly back on the desk.
“Where were you last night, I missed you…” The he slurred into Tony’s ear, clearly intoxicated. It wasn’t a new look on Tiberius Stone, but it was a lot less endearing when Tony also wasn’t plastered.
So this is my first foray into actually writing fanfic, though I'm definitely an avid reader where Stony is concerned. I had this idea a while back that I posted on a prompt thread on tumbler. It had some positive responses, but this idea turned out to be one of those niggling ones where the characters start talking to you, and I just had to start writing it. The first chapter here is a prologue of sorts. I do have a rough outline of of plot with an ending in mind, so I'm not super worried about finding that endpoint, but I'm definitely going more "gardener" than "architect" in my approach on this one. I know tagging is important, so I'll add as I go if anything jumps into the story that I wasn't expecting when I first started this. As for the ABO dynamics, I'm definitely going lighter on that aspect, exploring the more subtle side of sexism in this world. Bonding and heats are definitely a thing in this world, but I'm not sure how prominently I plan to have that come into play here given the plot. Comments and feedback are always appreciated. Hope you enjoy my super indulgent story full of tropes I most enjoy. I don't have a beta reader, so any of the inevitable mistakes here are mine.
“J, cut the music.” Tony called as he slid into his wheelie chair and started pulling open files labeled audio samples. Jarvis complied with the request, and a text box popped up on his screen.
“That should be illegal.” Came a smoky rumble on his left. Tony’s eyes roamed over the tall alpha leaning against the bar, their shoulders not quite touching, just close enough into his space for Tony to guess at his intent. Large, and undeniably attractive with his dark stubble and mischievous eyes, Tony suspected it was a move that often worked for him.
“I sent it a month ago.” Obie deadpanned, and yeah...that was hard to argue. It just felt weird when Obie sent him gifts. The thought was nice, but it always reminded Tony of the same kind of expensive designer label trinkets Howard’s secretary picked out for his mistresses. Last year it had been Chanel perfume and a pearl strand necklace which...yeah the implications were a bit awkward. Tony just didn’t know how to tell that to the man who was like family to him, so mostly his smiled and moved on. It’s not like Obie meant it that way, so there really wasn’t any harm. “I’ll open it soon.” Tony promised weakly at Obie’s sigh.
“…Okay.” The alpha replied, posture suddenly uncertain now that the threat was gone. He made no move forward, and his eyes shifted about, almost as if he were nervous Tony might walk over and try to touch
“Hail Hydra.”
His mind reeled, trying to find a rational explanation.
“Cut me some slack boss, look at him. I’ve had to sit here watching him parade around for months. You can’t lay a piece like that out and not expect to get the blood pumping south.” Rumlow grimaced, obviously chafing under the order, but not dominant enough to counter the other alpha. Instead he turned his sly gaze toward the asset. “I guess you don’t really worry about that any more eh Rogers?”
“Rumlow.” It came out more as a growl than anything else. “He’s bad.” Blue eyes found Tony’s again, imploring him to understand that essential fact.
“Aw J, you know me so well.” Tony grinned. Whatever pain he felt in the process, it would be totally worth it to hear Jarvis snark again.
“Come on, it’s just two weeks. It’ll be fine. I
“Back off man, he’s my O. We’re working some shit out.” Ty was either dumb or drunk enough to growl as he stumbled back to his feet in a stance that clearly signaled ‘fight’. The other alpha just regarded him coolly before gritting out an icy “No.” His body shifting more clearly between Tony and Ty, as if even the drunken alpha’s gaze on Tony was unacceptable.
“You said you were handling it.” The alpha replied, almost wary as he stopped his retreat midstride. He didn’t turn completely back to Tony, as if ready to bolt at any moment, and for some reason it kind of pissed Tony off. Who the hell was this guy, swooping in and out like he was goddamn Batman or something?!
“Not when we’re there together asshole!” Tony hissed back, trying to get around Ty’s arms as they moved to cage him against the wall. “Knock it off Ty, I’m not in the mood for your bullshit tonight!” Drunk or not, Ty was a lot stronger than he was. In another context, Tony might find that a turn on, but right now it just pissed him off as he tried pushing the willfully oblivious alpha away without success.
“C’mon, it was a mistake, I’m sorry! Don’t be like that. You know we’re not exclusive, no labels no fuss right?!” Ty jogged ahead again, this time crowding Tony up against the brick wall of the building behind them.
“Mr. Stark.” The alpha clearly in charge here greeted as Tony was led to a seat he didn’t choose, so much as was encouraged to take.
“Yes, I gathered that.” Tony replied dryly. “They said the same thing about you, so color me confused here.” Tony pointed out curtly at the alpha as he…did he just…no! He
“Garret won’t like it.” The agent who’s called on the radio said nervously, looking around the dark street corner for sight of the van.
“The process should take another twelve hours Sir. With that time line, we should be ready to begin treatments by 1500 hours tomorrow.” The nurse suggested softly as she adjusted the thin sheet that hid the asset’s modesty. Pierce took a moment to examine it more closely, hand reaching out to brush a stray blond lock from a perfectly chiseled cheekbone before venturing lower to rip away the sheet. The nurse’s nostrils flared with a nervous glance at Pierce, clearly uncomfortable, but said nothing as he discarded the fabric on the floor. The asset was not a person, it would not do to treat it as such--even in small gestures meant to spare them any discomfort. A weapon had no need of such things. The nurse might need to be replaced, a beta would be better.
“Yeah, work on that for now J. Add all compatible files to your servers.” Tony said clearing his throat and wiping sweaty palms on his pant legs. No matter how much it hurt hearing Jarvis’s voice again, Tony craved it like a hit of whatever colorful pills Ty used to pass around at one of his house parties. Not that he’d be going to anymore of those in the near future, he thought bitterly. Tony’s vices these days veered strictly toward sex an alcohol, but occasionally he’d still feel this itch to be out of his head for a while in a way even tequila couldn’t replicate. Ty used to be Tony’s go to guy for that particular triple threat, but seeing as how things ended last night, Tony was more likely to punch Ty than fuck him. Probably.
“Just try not to go on anymore horizontal adventures today, okay? You’re heavier than you look.” Tony took the mug and patted his arm gently to show all was forgiven. “Nap time.” He added, pointing to the bots’ charging station, before turning on his heel back toward the computer.
The pounding electric thrum of the guitar solo of
, another phantom voice whispered, soft and feminine.
“Yes of course, very beautiful. You’re going to turn all kinds of heads at your party tonight.” Maria agreed as she ran her hand up to Tony’s hair to try and fix a rebellious curl that had sprung free of his coif. “Alice Tate had her son in the most darling powder blue for his coming out party last fall. That color would have looked so much sweeter on you dear, but people would just say I copied her. Oh well, we work with what we’re given.” She sighed, giving up on his hair.
“Did the pancakes say something about your mother, or are you just psyching yourself up there big guy?” The target--Tony, asked with a raised brow as he popped another forkful of scrambled eggs into his mouth. The asset watched, strangely transfixed by the movement of his throat.
It was strangely comforting, and Tony felt the tension in his shoulders ease just a bit. At least they did until the alpha turned on his heel suddenly and started to walk away.
“Absence confirmed. Extraction window should open by 1700 hours.” The Asset complied, tossing down the photographs from the last 12 hour watch. Surveillance was key for the mission’s success.
“I just don’t like thinking of you stuck here alone. Tell me at least you’re not going to go on a binger while I’m gone? I can’t come pick you up from Virginia.” Rhodey said pointedly. Tony normally would have taken more offense to the insinuation, but he
“But I don’t want to have a coming out party. Can’t we just stay home?” Tony turned to the camera, pleading to his only ally in the room. The first birthday after he’d presented as omega had been the hardest to adjust to. Before then, he’d been Howard’s heir, a beta like his father they’d all assumed. Tony had never shown any of the early signals or tendencies those stupid pamphlets at school proclaimed with their patronizing illustrated guides. Tony most certainly had
The text popped up on the screen, offering an out that Tony jumped to take.
“Their team’s not in place yet. If we jump the gun here with the kid, all we’re going to do is spook Stark. You want to be the one to tell Pierce why he won’t get his serum samples?” Garret shot back absently as he shuffled through the photos.
Something feral inside him snarled. They can’t have him. I won’t let them.
Some attempted non-con here, mostly for Rumlow's grabby hands, but there's a scene with some heavily implied threat as well. Also be aware there is more graphic violence this chapter, as you can guess how Steve will react to this. This chapter is exclusively from Tony's perspective (after some trial and error, I realized that was the only way to get this chapter to flow the way I wanted it to), so the next one will be from Steve's to compensate.
“Your safety.” The alpha replied dryly, flashing his badge without missing a beat. Agent Garret Tony noted before shifting his gaze back to the older alpha.
“Come, we need to leave.” Sarcasm, along with bubble space, it appeared was also not a thing where this guy came from, as he nodded along with Tony as if his rant was perfectly insightful. The Alpha then started pulling Tony with him across the lab, careful to steer them away from the broken glass.
“No Obie, I’m sure. There’s no reason for you to fly in from Malibu. You’re on vacation.” Tony insisted to the phone DUM-E was holding up above his work station. He was arm deep in the guts of a ‘69 Firebird engine he was cannibalizing for parts when the call came in, and Tony shot his over excited bot a pointed glare to try and get him to hold the receiver still.
back at the omega! Where did an alpha in this situation get off on pouting like Tony had just stolen his puppy!
“We’re better off without the merger.” Obie agreed. “Did you get my present in the mail?” He asked, suddenly shifting gears. Tony’s pause must have been telling. “You haven’t opened it yet.”
“Shut up! He ain’t here, and you ain’t gonna tell him.” Rumlow growled. “Go stand watch if you’re getting squeamish on me Sitwell.” Whatever Sitwell might have replied though was cut off with a wet squelch, a knife suddenly sticking out of his throat. The man collapsed to the ground in a convulsing heap making soft gurgling noises as his hand fingered at the knife.
“Wrong answer.” Tony grunted, as disappointed as he was angry. Curling himself into as much of a ball as possible, Tony covered his ears and squeezing his eyes shut. “J, light it up!” The effect of the flash bomb was immediate, dropping them both to the ground in a tangled heap. Tony scrambled up, still a little wobbly from the grenade’s effects on his balance, but he’d shielded himself better than Rogers. He didn’t have time to look at the downed alpha, dashing out the demolished doorway, and down the halls as quickly as he could.
punched Tony’s movements as he finished tightening the last loose bolt on Dum-E’s arm after his very convincing imitation of Humpty Dumpty. “Seriously, why do I bother with you? You can’t tell the difference between a drill press and a drill bit? It’s literally attached to the table!” Dum-E hand whirled down in apology, trying to pick up Tony’s mug off the desk to hold out as an oil spiked olive branch. Tony took it with a sigh of resignation, long since given up on getting Dum-E to tell the difference between creamer and motor oil.
“I’m not moping.” Tony hissed, hands clutching around his 22 oz cup of gas station coffee. Was it French press, no, but it made the little stars dancing on the inside of his eyelids slow down just a smidge, so for now it was the heavenly nectar of the gods. “Look, I love your mom, I really do, but if I keep showing up with you at every holiday break and family function she’s gonna expect you to pop a ring. Which considering you’re bringing Stephanie--”
I've also been seeing a lot of chatter and art lately around Regency Era Stony, which got some plot bunnies stirring full of some of my favorite trashy romance novel tropes. I've got some ideas jotted down for a fic, so if that's also something you'd be interested in reading, let me know. I hope you all enjoy!
“I think your mother is quite keen on it. The party should only take a few hours, and then we can come straight home. We’ll make popcorn, and watch whatever you like in the den.” Jarvis offered in a quiet conspiratorial tone.
“Lindsey.” Rhodey corrected patiently with that long suffering friend squint that just pinched around the eyes.
, pretty well.” Tony deflected, suddenly desperate to be free of that gaze. He tried to squirm away, but there was no getting around the bulk of this guy.
“If you’re not coming home to visit, at least tell me you’re spending the holiday with someone. Your mother worries. You still seeing that--?”
“Sorry.” Tony winced. “It’s at my apartment, I just haven’t had time. In my defense, it’s not even Christmas yet.” Tony shot back feebly.
, Tony thought at first glance. Undoubtedly the eyes of a killer, and utterly unlike the ones Tony remembered belonging to the man he’d shared pancakes with the night before.
“I wouldn’t worry about it Obie. If I had to hazard a guess, that new bodyguard the old man hired already sent off a very thorough report on that particular subject.” Tony grimaced as he tried not to think about the unfairly attractive alpha his father had sent to spy on him. It wasn’t as if this was the first time Howard had done it, but this was definitely the first one who set all of Tony’s inappropriate urges firmly to
“It’s possible.” Garret replied. “We think it may have something to do with your own research however. We’ll have to take your files with us when we leave.”
“Jarvis!” He called out the second he was through the door, sliding the dead bolt firmly in place. “Open a line, try Aunt Peggy.” Tony ordered, even as his stomach clenched in rising dread. It was ten o’clock on a Saturday night. Who the hell was going to be in the office to pick up?  The phone rang out as Tony scrambled about the lab for potential weapons. Pipe wrench, welding iron, copper coil, Tony tried to take a quick inventory as DUM-E came whirling off his charging station with a fire extinguisher.
Something crunched beneath his hand. The metal lip of the table bent around his fingers. His mind rushed to cold medicals rooms, injections, pain, the chair. Rumlow. They were going to hurt Tony, he felt the certainty of that in his bones.
, the first voice was back, more urgent this time.
“He’s an assassin, possibly KGB affiliated. Most of his hits have been in Europe so far, but he was spotted in town two days ago. The chatter is, his next target is you.” Garret started, throwing down a few grainy photographs that show a familiar head of blond hair. Tony couldn’t see his eyes in the first picture, but the build definitely looked like Rogers. The gun in his hand was a new addition though, along with the lethal looking intent Tony could read coiled in that powerful frame. Tony’s mind flashed back to the last show of power he’s seen those muscles display, the warm heat coiling low in his own body as he’d watched. A shiver racked down Tony’s spine at the memory. Garret must have misinterpreted it for fear, since he barreled ahead.  “We’ve got men of the ground hunting for him now though, we’ll keep you safe.”
just spent a sizable chunk of his morning passed out in some guy’s bathroom, so his position was a little undercut. Party hardy Bacardi and all that...
Slowly he stalked forward, chest heaving, and Tony was left frozen in place as he watched, chin lifting to bare his neck without conscious thought. Blood pounded in his ears as it rushed south, and Tony in that moment was absolutely terrified, but also incredibly turned on as wet slick began creeping down his thigh. It was so wrong, the flutter he felt as Rogers picked him up in his arms, the swoop in his stomach as the alpha buried his face, stained with blood, in the cradle of Tony’s neck.
“I think you look quite trim master Tony, very handsome.” Jarvis, the human one, said primly from somewhere out of view. He was probably the one holding the camera, Tony thought numbly. God, it had been over a year since he died, and it still hurt hearing his voice.
“Uh no, you break it you buy it pal, you can’t just leave him here like this!” Tony insisted, arms crossed in his best imitation of his father’s “And that’s final!” voice.
They ended up leaving Ty inside a laundromat which, all things considered, Tony felt was fair. They hadn’t had to walk too far to find it, but that was all the time needed for the adrenaline to ware off and his stomach to roar back to life with the reminder he hadn’t eaten any of what Rhodey would call ‘real food’ in the better part of two days. Apparently vodka was not part of a balanced breakfast. If Tony was feeling a little shaky in that moment, obviously that was why.
“So I’ve heard. Your guy here was pretty light on the specifics.” Rumlow was looming behind him, but Tony didn’t need to see the smirk to hear it in the huff he let out.
“Just promise me you’ll stay out of trouble.” Rhodey grumbled, hands shoving into his coat pockets in a classic Rhodey sign of surrender.
“But why do I have to wear this mom, it’s so tight!” Tony’s little doppelganger grimaced as he pulled on the offending tie. The getup made him look like the poster child for Easter brunch in the Hamptons, and the fabric clung to his body in a way Tony distinctly remembered as being hot and uncomfortable.
“Go watch the door!” Tony barked at the bot while he tried to jury-rig his supplies into a weapon more useful for long range. Those guys were built and military trained. If they could get close enough to put hands on him, it was game over. Tony couldn’t win a contest of brute force against a pack of alphas. The phone line went to voice mail again after the third call. He’d already left an encrypted message on her personal line trying to explain the situation, but that wasn’t going to help him now. Every fiber in Tony hated the idea, but if he couldn’t get a hold of Aunt Peggy, there was one other person he could try who was deeply entangled in SHIELD’s web.
“Surprised you noticed Ty, what with that undergrad’s mouth wrapped around your dick.” Tony’s tone was clipped as he successfully wriggled free of Ty’s arm and tried to keep walking. “Go find him if you’re lonely.” Tony bit out as he shouldered past. Tony’s standards on fidelity these days were admittedly pretty low, but he liked to think he had at least a little more self-respect than to crawl back to Ty after a clear snub like that. Doing pity jello-shots and passing out in the bathroom was much more dignified.
This was perhaps what his ex-therapist would call a prime example of his masochistic tendencies, but Tony had spent the better part of his adult life ignoring her little kernels of wisdom, so he wasn’t about to start doing anything about it now. In his defense, this was the same woman who’d told him his manic depressive episodes were being caused by a hormone imbalance from his heat suppressants. Apparently the key to mental health was knotted bliss and babies. Who knew? Apparently the Federation of United Citizens for Keeping Integrated Natural Genders, for which she was a card carrying member. Tony could almost forgive them if they were more self-aware about their acronym.
“Look, if it makes you feel better, the only binge I'm planning to go on is in the lab. I’m making a lot of headway on that learning algorithm, but the server is too limited without a proper portable network interface. He’s building data connections as fast as he can, but the rest of the web hasn’t caught up yet.” Tony lamented to his coffee, though the grin belied how delighted he actually was with having a puzzle laid before him to solve.
“Did you get those specs I sent you son?”
lie, and Tony got the distinct feeling these ass clowns couldn’t tell the difference between a dummy data cache anyway. Come hell or high water, no one, SHIELD or not, was getting their hands on his work unless he damn well wanted them to.
“Well good…that’s obviously well thought out.” Garret hesitated, eyes clearly scrutinizing. “What I need to know from you now though, is if he’s tried to contact you yet.”
“Hey, what do you say we get out of here?” The alpha barreled forward, grabbing Tony’s wrist, thumb circling his pulse in a bid for his attention. “Find a quiet place we can talk?”
“T-thank, but I didn’t need your help okay, I was handling it!” Tony managed to get out, his voice steadying out by the end. He pushed himself off the ground to put a little distance between himself and the alphas, as frankly the position was making him feel a little cornered.
Tony was being carried again. This time it barely registered through the haze, and he was too tired to fight back against the hold. Tony’s body melted like jelly against a warm hard chest. He was safe now, Rogers promised.
“Star Wars?” Tony asked with a sidelong look.
“Nope, gonna have to pass there sourpatch.” Tony gritted out, sunglasses firmly in place to shield him from the insufferably cheerful sunshine that was currently making his hangover pound his head like a jackhammer. If they happened to look out of place with his bundled winter coat, hand knitted blue scarf, and ratty jeans that might have been a teensy bit worse for the ware after last night’s festivities, morning Tony had zero fucks to give before 9 am. Crashing in some dude’s bathtub had definitely not been one of his smarter moves, but then thirsty Thursday was rarely known as an occasion for pique decision making skills.
“Get. Off.” A voice growled behind Ty, the only warning Tony had before the alpha was ripped bodily off of him and tossed what looked like a good fifteen feet away.
“That was years ago Tony. Besides, he was too much of a pup for you. Did you hear Hammer Industries dipped another ten points this month?” Obie purred conspiratorially. And this was why Uncle Obie was the best.
go that long without a keeper you know.” Tony shot back as they rounded the corner. Neither man noticed the blank stared blue eyed alpha that followed on their tail a few moment later.
“Ahhh.” Obie mused sympathetically. “Suppose I should let Howard know.”
Normally, he might find drinking alone in a dark office a bit maudlin, but tonight Alexander Pierce was willing to make an exception. Fate was a funny thing, he couldn’t help but muse thoughtfully to the scotch in his hand, ice clinking against the side as he raised the glass to his lips for a deep swallow. It burned down his throat in a smooth slide the way only good alcohol really can. It was pure, cleansing the stale taste of failure left behind after years of dead ends and dashed hopes. So many missed opportunities, years of resources lost to a fruitless search that they could never quite quit. Howard Stark alone had vested a neigh fortune into the venture, hands always coming away empty; save for the bottle of course.The potential reward was just too high, no matter how many times he watched his hopes dashed among the waves of the Atlantic. All that money, man power, and cutting edge Starktech useless...and then one fishing boat gets blown off course. It was sheer luck one of their agents was the one to pick up the chatter, otherwise there was no telling whose hands their prize might have fallen into. Order, security, a real chance for world peace. For the first time in years, Pierce felt like he’d glimpsed sight of a path toward that shining city on a hill.
“Honey, there’s no stress. Weddings are supposed to be fun. At least all the ones I went to were.”
She transformed the communal area for the party. The theme wasn’t the typical blue like Tony had inspected. She surprised him by taking his theme idea into consideration and following through. The space was decorated like it had come out from a page of a comic book. Tony’s plan had been to have a superhero themed shower. It made sense since they were heroes and his son was going to be no different.
“I love you, too.” Steve kisses him again.
“What pups?” Clint asks. “I thought it was just the one?”
“You forgot? You? Every year you’re always doing something and this year you forget?”
One glance in the nursery shows a peaceful scene, and knowing that Morgan and Steve were okay, Tony leaves them alone to set up coffee. It’s a few minutes later when Steve is entering the room with their daughter in his arms. Tony sends a small smile his way when their eyes meet, only for it to be replaced with a frown when Steve doesn’t smile back.
“Okay.” Tony nods and he rises to his feet. “I’ll find the nurse.”
“So you are going through with it?”
“I am. But before any of that, I was just a little guy from Brooklyn. I never used to look like this. I was born sick and small; a pathetic excuse for an omega. I’ve never been bonded because no alpha would ever consider me as their mate. I was tired of the abuse and mockery. I wanted to be better. I wanted to prove myself.”
Steve is quiet for most of the drive into the city. He keeps his gaze out the window, barely participating in any of the conversations Tony tries to have. Tony brushes it off and takes Steve’s hand, rubbing his thumb along Steve’s knuckles.
“Well done,” Alpha praises and he steps into the room. He strides over until he’s standing in front of the omega, his smile widening when he reaches out to touch him. Steve can’t help but flinch from the contact. “You did good. There should be no reason for this to fail.”
The conversation stops there.
“My ma and I used to stay up to watch the fireworks. She always said they were for me, but it knew she was just trying to cheer me up. I never really had any of this. She scraped just enough to get me something every year. Honestly I preferred just spending it with her. She did her best.”
“You’ve done so much for us. Let me do something for you. I promise nothing big.”
Steve didn’t know the first thing about raising a pup. He only knew how to carry them and eventually birth them. After that there was no reason for him to stick around. Hydra made sure he was kept away. The pups didn’t belong to him.
“Buck-” Sam tries to protest, but he goes ignored.
“He’s your brother,” Steve explains and adjusts Peter in his arms so the older pups can get a better look. “His name is Peter.”
Steve rolls out of bed, brows furrowing when the sensation doesn’t let up. It doesn’t hurt, the feeling was odd. He shrugs it off, deciding to pin the blame on dinner. Tony’s cravings were getting to him.
“You have any?” Steve asks, all while trying to get Harley to leave his hair alone. The pup stops and lays his head on Steve’s shoulder instead, blue eyes fluttering.
Tony sighs harshly and follows Peter’s gaze. “I gave up on those a long time ago. I’m not Iron Man anymore.”
“Congratulations, sir,” Jarvis says. “Master Peter is beautiful.”
Peter does his best to force a smile and accept the condolences given to him. He’s happy to have all of the Avengers gathered; it’s been years since they’ve been together like this. Peter just wishes it had been for a different occasion. Maybe Christmas or New Years. Not a funeral.
His stomach is churning, threatening to show him the breakfast his Uncle Bucky had made him this morning. Peter fights the urge to vomit, but he can’t fight the urge to cry.
“I can’t believe you had a baby,” he tells Steve while he works on birthing the one he’s been tasked to have. Now wasn’t the time to discuss their surprise baby, but Tony can’t help but bring it up anyway.
There’s a sense of relief that washes over Tony once they’re back in the city. He feels as if he’s been on a vacation that lasted longer than he intended. Of course what kind of vacation was spent locked in some unknown base, beaten, shot, forced to watch the love of his life be brutally raped and tortured. Yeah. Some vacation.
Tony swallows every moan and whimper Steve makes while his hand trails between them, stroking the omega’s cock and smearing the precome at the tip. He eases off Steve’s cock, his questing fingers traveling lower until he meets wetness. Tony rubs one finger along the tight ring of muscle, teasing the area before pressing the tip of his finger against it and dipping inside. He drags his finger out and then slowly thrusts it back in. Steve moans, his head tipping back against the pillow.
“You mean the story I don't even know about?”
Peter can barely bring himself to look at his uncles. It’s been a little over a week since the party and the huge blow up that resulted in violence and mean words being shared. Apologies for that night have yet to be given, at least not really. Bucky and Peter weren’t on speaking terms at the moment.
“I know someone who can.”
Suddenly the door is opening and Peter gasps in surprise. He backs up until he’s pressed against the wall and away from the crowd of students coming out of the room. He scans the group for one in particular and once he finds him, Peter reaches out and pulls Flash back by his backpack. He didn’t intend to do this, but he’s nervous and panicking.
“T-Tony,” Steve chokes out, his eyes filling with more tears. He tries to speak again, only for another sob to escape him. Tony is at his side in seconds, dropping down to the floor beside him to hold him close. “Tony!” Steve cries, clinging onto him tightly and burying his face in Tony’s chest.
“Are you suggesting I find ways to cope?”
For a moment Peter considers telling his uncle where he’s really been, but he holds back. His uncle would kill him for sure.
Ever since Peter’s birth, something shifted between them. They hadn’t fought once since they learned about their son. Even when they should be during those sleepless nights. Instead they’ve managed to work together. They’ve even grown a little closer.
But Flash never does. He appears concerned, a look Peter has never seen on him before. Flash never showed an ounce of sympathy for Peter before.
“Tomorrow? Tony, we just got back. I’m not...I don’t want to go...outside is…”
“Oh of course you did. You can’t keep making excuses Tony. And using your son? That’s pathetic.”
Alpha is extra caring and attentive.
“Okay. You know, mommy has bad dreams too.”
Peter nods and tries to speak, but only a small sob comes out. Tony holds him tighter, comforting him with soft words. He can feel Natasha’s eyes on him, but he doesn’t turn her way.
“Could you? I have to finish packing up our room.”
Morgan finally gets the chance to work on her science project and tries going on morning runs. She hates them and vows never to do them again. She helps build Peter’s new suit and she’s asked to help with the next one or whenever a new upgrade is needed. It makes her feel special.
“Are you sure you’re my kid?”
“Who do you think? Who’s been acting so odd lately?”
“Good. So no sleeping in at all this year?”
Sam chuckles and glances down at the swell of Bucky’s stomach, knowing that his daughter was probably up to no good. Both of his kids were going to be a handful.
His prayers are answered when the door opens and Steve is being wheeled into the room by a nurse. Tony’s never been so happy to see him.
“He won’t be running the team. I’ll train him and when he’s ready if he wants to lead the Avengers then he’ll have the experience.”
“I’m gonna fuck you,” Tony promises and presses his lips against the sensitive skin on Steve’s neck. Steve sighs and tilts his neck to the side to offer more access. Tony places kisses and bites along Steve’s neck, marking the soft flesh. He trails one hand between them, rubbing Steve through his jeans and eliciting a moan from him.
“Why! Dammit, Tony you better tell me right now or-”
“Get up.”
“I ruined my shirt.”
When Flash doesn’t respond right away, Peter fears the worst and waits for Flash to turn away and leave. But then he surprises Peter by gripping him tightly by the arm and dragging him toward an empty hallway.
He’s happier now that he has a steaming cup of coffee and a change of scenery from his tower. He doesn’t get to spend too much time in the cafe. Happy makes sure to drag him away when he starts flirting with the pretty omega behind the counter.
“Yeah, but she has Steve’s attitude.”
Instead he casually walks the trails of the park a few blocks from Steve’s new home. He takes a break on one of the nearby benches to enjoy his cup of coffee and the warm sun.
Steve whines in protest and tries to pull back, only for the alpha to grab him by the back of the neck and bring him back. Their lips meet again, this time the kiss rough and desperate.
“Yes!” All four pups cry in unison.
“Yes!”
“Guess you just got a knack for calming crying babies.”
Steve huffs and glances down at the costume he’s been forced to wear. When Tony had said he’d make the costume, Steve had assumed it would be more adult friendly. Instead Tony had recreated their son’s onesie. It’s red and blue with spiderwebs and a large black spider on the chest.
“Tony, fuck, please!” Steve yanks Tony’s hair harder, bringing him closer and grinding against the alpha’s face. “Oh fuck. Gonna-gonna come!”
“Wait until I get their rooms together. Tomorrow we can go shopping,” Tony says.
“Yeah J, let’s see what survived through the digitization process.” Tony agreed as he watched the screen fill up with a truly horrendous looking floral three tier cake that read
across Rogers’ shoulders in an embarrassing fireman carry, the son of a bitch!
Obie had speculated, insisting emphatically the guy wasn’t on Howard’s payroll. It was a chilling thought, but it didn't really square either. What kind of stalker tries to flee when they had their victim practically cornered in a deserted alley? Weren’t they supposed to have delusional attachments? For god’s sake, Tony took the guy to dinner, he should be on some kind of drugged up honeymoon or skinned into a lampshade by now if that was this guy’s angle.
“Good. Then we have time to move.” Garret abruptly cut off his train of thought, standing from his seat with a tense look at the alphas around him. They obviously didn’t want to linger now that they’d found Tony.
Alright, so he lied. Rhodey would forgive him, Tony thought morosely as he downed the shot of cheap whiskey that was tonight’s special. It burned with a god awful cinnamon aftertaste as it settled sour in his stomach, but anything was better than the flush of humiliation he felt just thinking about the fool he’d made of himself last night. It was stupid to make assumptions, Tony knew better, but damnit, usually he was right! What other reason was there for some quiet super-jacked alpha with an obvious military bearing to follow Tony around and take orders without even a peep of complaint? The idea just didn’t compute without money involved, and it wasn’t like the guy had denied the charge.
It was a standoff at that point, conflict inevitable with two alphas pumping out as much aggression as they were. It ended up being a two hit fight. Ty lunged first with a haymaker. The other alpha just kind of,
“Think that was a real slick move huh? Taking off like that.” A smoky voice husked into Tony’s ear as the alpha’s body shifted on top of Tony’s in a manner that was most definitely
“Okay.” Tony lied after a beat. “Just let me grab my coat.” He said quietly, eyes carefully downcast in a submissive gesture and pumping out fear scent that had every alpha at the table sitting up a little bit taller. “Thank you for protecting me.” Tony said with a watery smile to really sell it as he slipped out of his seat toward the coat rack. He hadn’t bought himself much of a head start, but it would have to do. Coat in hand, Tony didn’t break stride as he slipped out the emergency exit, sprinting the second he hit the street.
Peter straightens up from his crouched position to get closer, leaping over the small gap between the two structures to touch the art. He runs his hand over his papa’s face and down to the shield held securely in his papa’s arm. Peter lets his hand linger over the shield, for a moment wondering what it would be like to wield it.
Peter rolls his eyes. “No.”
“Hang on, hang on.” Tony pushes the glasses back in place. “Trust me on this. It will help you.”
“Yep! I’m officially retired and a free man. Well...at least for another five months.”
The smile on Steve’s face falters. “I’m sorry I haven’t made things easy. I just...I haven’t felt like myself since Morgan was born.”
“Yeah.” Tony nods in agreement.
The lock on the door clicks and Tony takes a small step back when the door opens and Steve appears in the doorway. It’s obvious that he’s been crying. His eyes are red and slightly swollen, and his face is blotchy and stained with tears.
Tony blinks. He hadn’t realized Steve had said anything. All he could think about was killing-
“But a wedding needs to be planned and I don’t know if two months is enough time. Next year-”
“I disappear for 5 minutes and you boys can’t play nice?”
“Uncle Bucky got a cat. Her name is Alpine and she’s so sweet! Uncle Sam says he doesn’t like her but I’ve already caught them taking naps on the couch. I wish you could be here...we miss you.”
The scream Steve emits is startling, forcing Tony to push aside his panicking to assist with the birth. That thought alone is enough to get Tony’s anxiety rising again, but he doesn’t allow it to take over him completely. Steve needed him.
Tony swallows hard, eyes transfixed on the light blue ones he gets the privilege to stare into every day. “I want you to do something else now,” he says, earning another chuckle from the blond.
The tears in Steve’s eyes escape, a few rolling down his face. Tony is there to wipe them away.
“Right.” Tony frowns and brings his coffee cup up to his lips. “Just like the medication.” Those last few words were supposed to have been mumbled against the coffee mug, but it’s clear by the look on Steve’s face that he had heard.
Steve gets dressed and makes his way downstairs, and that’s where he finds Tony casually sitting on the couch. Tony smiles and rises to his feet when he notices Steve and he takes the two glasses of champagne in his hand.
Tony scoffs and rolls his eyes. “I’m sorry that I’m such a screw up.”
“Yeah,” Bucky nods and glances in his husband’s direction, smirking when he catches the annoyed expression on Sam’s face. “I think I will.”
Peter nods. “Got it.”
Steve’s fingers tighten around the wheel until his knuckles are turning white. He takes his eyes off the road to glance at Peter again, hating the hurt and angered look he finds on his features.
“What? Hanging up the shield? You gonna hang up the suit?”
But the anger he’s feeling right now isn’t just from the mission going wrong, but because Steve was the most stubborn, most infuriating man in the entire universe. He not only refused JARVIS’s scan, but medical help altogether. Steve was two things: stubborn and stupid.
“It’s a good thing,” she assures. “A strong, healthy pup is always a good thing.”
Flash is heading toward his car when Peter catches up to him. He makes sure to reach into his pocket and make sure the sonogram picture is still there. His life would be even more fucked if someone else stumbled across it.
Yay Peter is here! And now he gets to meet his papa and uncle Bucky. Of course the other Avengers, but that's in the next chapter. Tony missed it but that's his own damn fault.
“Don’t let him fool you. He might not walk or talk yet, but he’ll let you know when he’s had enough of you.”
“Pa-pa!” Morgan cries.
Bruce steps forward to get a better look. For a moment, Steve almost forgot he was there.
So that’s what he’s trying to do now. He was young and he still had a life worth living. He had told his papa he’d get good grades, get into a good college, and maybe-if he was lucky- find a girlfriend.
“It’s fine. Apparently I’m not the only one you’ve brought up here,” Steve says dryly.
The door opens and Peter’s face lights up. “Your lab!”
At the sound of the familiar voice, Tony is scrambling to his feet and quickly wiping his tears. He takes a deep breath to compose himself before facing his son.
Tony is gripped tightly by the two alphas and escorted out of the room. He glances over his shoulder, managing a quick peek at his mate before the door shuts and locks into place.
Tony doesn’t miss the way Steve’s eyes shine. There's no candle light to blame for the brightness in Steve's eyes. Tony nods and cups Steve’s face, leaning down to kiss him softly.
Steve eyes him closely before turning and leaving, reminding him that dinner would be ready in an hour. Peter closes the door again and rests against it, blowing out a deep breath.
Tony holds Steve, gently running his hands down his back. “Don’t pull a stunt like that again,” he says softly.
It’s the lack of warmth and an empty bed that jolts Steve awake. He gasps and sits up, eyes scanning around the room for the alpha that had been with him during the night. He’s greeted with an empty room. Tony’s scent still lingers on the pillows and sheets, but it’s not enough; Steve needs him.
“That doesn’t mean anything. Steve’s wishes were-”
Steve sneaks out the front door. The corridor is empty, but he knew better than to trust that he was alone. Guards were constantly roaming through the compound. Though they didn’t come up to their leader’s private floor, they lurked around and monitored the lower levels.
“It’s not. I was a jerk. I guess I panicked and...said some stupid things.”
It’s 7 A.M. when Peter’s alarm blares. He wakes with a groan and rolls over, stretching out his arm to grab his phone off the bedside table and shut off his alarm. With his room silent again, Peter shuts his eyes and tries to go back to sleep.
“Give him a chance? Steve, I don’t do animals. Why do you think I’ve never had one?”
“You see it, too? I thought it was just me,” Tony says followed by a sigh. “I don’t know what’s going on.”
“That’s not true! I got in a fight at school once and the guy was pretty messed up.”
“Guess it’s just you and me tonight, squirt. Papa is...he’s...he’s okay.”
“He’s sleeping with us,” Tony explains, crossing the room to lay his son on the changing table he put together. He adjusts the blanket around his son, securing it tightly until Peter resembles a a baby burrito. “I have a bassinet in there. I figured it would be easier when he wakes up during the night.”
The alpha nods. “I figured. I can assure you there’s no reason to get defensive here.”
The smell of the omega smacks Tony in the face and the alpha growls. He pulls off of Steve’s chest and continues kissing his way down the rest of Steve’s body. He gives extra attention to Steve’s belly, caressing the bump lovingly and placing a kiss right above Steve’s navel.
Steve stumbles for a moment, quickly catching himself and moving toward the door where the other alpha is waiting.
The brief session that’s been called should only last twenty minutes. Thirty minutes at most. The team is already gathered, ready to start the discussion regarding their newest assignment. All of the chairs are filled. All but one.
“You okay?” Steve asks and he sets the soiled trash can down on the floor. He makes a mental note to clean it out.
But all of the outgoing calls never get returned. Steve’s lost count of how many times he’s called Tony during the span of a day. If he’s not putting together missions and going over training tactics, then Steve was on his phone.
“I mean it,” Steve smiles and leans in close to kiss Tony’s lips. “You’re perfect.”
“No no. Harley, no. It’s a bad word.”
“James?” Steve whispers and the older pup glances up at him, growling and snarling. Steve ignores the warning the young alpha gives and steps further into the room.
“The caterer should be here soon so I better finish up,” Tony says and removes his hands so he could put them back to work.
Steve smiles at those words. “Yeah.”
“Right. I guess I missed that part when you went off and got yourself nearly killed. We both feel taken care of,” Tony scoffs with a roll of his eyes.
Alexander chuckles. “We need someone like you, Mr. Stark. With your help we could change the world. We just need one thing from you.”
“Yeah. Wanna do it again?”
“I forget you’re not from this time period. It’s a tablet. A little computer,” Tony says when he catches the confused look on Steve’s face. “This is one of mine,” Tony turns the tablet around to show Steve the familiar last name engraved in the back.
Not much is said about Tony after that. The comfortable silence that falls between them doesn’t last long, and soon Peter’s cries of distress fill the once quiet space. Steve is quick to try and calm his son down, only for his attempts to fail.
“Tony? Tony!”
But it was only Pepper and Happy who greeted him, and judging by the broken looks on their faces, they had already heard the news.
“I promise. You have my word,” Tony assures.
Steve forces a smile. “I’m always up for this.”
I feel so bad for these two. All Tony wants to do is help Steve because he hates seeing him in so much pain, and poor Steve just sees himself as a risk. They will definitely get their happy ending with their beautiful baby girl! They deserve it!
“Why?” Peter asks.
“You should see what she's doing now,” Tony says and rises to his feet to cross the room and grab the diaper bag from off the bed. He pulls out a fluffy blanket and sets it up on the hardwood floor. He pats the center of the blanket and Steve catches the hint, laying Morgan down on her stomach. Tony drops down to his own belly to be at her level, smiling when she lifts her head to meet his eyes. “Hey, Maguna. Wanna show papa what you’ve been doing?”
His hands have gone idle, just like they had for the past few years. As much as he tries to distract himself with his inventions, he can’t find the motivation to do it.
“Morning,” Steve mumbles and he frowns. “What time is it?”
Tony doesn’t know what he’s supposed to say. He feels another apology will only upset his son even more.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I can’t. I know it’s my pup but I can’t. Tony, it’s from him and-and I can’t do that again. I can’t. I’m sorry.”
“But?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes, Dad!” Peter huffs and tries to take the picture back, only for Tony to turn away so he can keep looking at it. “It’s just really tiny!”
A few minutes later, all three pups are gathered on the large sofa downstairs with warm milk and a plate of Oreo cookies. Steve can’t even find it in himself to be upset. Tony was just trying to help.
The driver gets out to open the door for Steve while a small group of security come over to assist with leading the omega into the tower. Despite knowing they work for his mate, Steve is hesitant to allow them to get so close to his pups. It’s not until a familiar face emerges from the crowd does Steve instantly lower his guard.
“Get him on the table,” The beta instructs, gesturing with one hand toward the bed.
Her smile falters immediately. “Steve? What’s wrong?”
“Tony-”
Steve comes over to help. “A tablet? Tony, you’re not working while in labor.”
He gets Peter into a clean diaper; it’s not so bad. But then the hard part comes. Steve doesn’t remember the little buttons on Peter’s pajamas being so damn difficult. Peter is still crying, the sound painful to hear.
His sons whine softly and Steve has to calm them by letting them nuzzle his neck and inhale his scent. He holds his babies close, happy to have them back in his arms. They were safe now.
But now he was granted that opportunity.
“How...I’m not...I don’t even…” Steve stumbles over his words.
“Big?” Steve smirks.
“So which one…” Sam gestures between the two babies.
“Come on, daddy!” Peter cries and tugs on his father’s hand, urging him to hurry up. Tony chuckles and leads his son to the bed. Peter is lifted up and placed down beside Steve. “Papa, he’s here! Look!” Peter points excitedly at his sleeping brother.
“I’m not going to hurt you. They want to take you. I’m going to protect you. I promise.” The alpha murmured earnestly, like he was saying a vow.
. Something deeply primal that Tony didn’t often like to acknowledge purred at the word, which was just embarrassing for a lot of reasons.
“Is this about my father?” Tony asked carefully, picking up another photo of Rogers off the table that had a better angle of his face. The eyes were visible in this one.
The room they kept it in was cold, both in temperature and in its clinical utilitarianism. That was fine, their new asset would have no need of such comforts. Pierce strode to the bed the asset was laid out on, pulling a chart out of the hands of an omega nurse who was fussing with his IV and breathing tube. The medical equipment they had the asset hooked up to was designed for a controlled assent, it shouldn’t regain any semblance on consciousness until they were ready for it. Just in case though, the heavily reinforced shackles eliminated any illusion that they were in a hospital, and would keep the asset succure.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Oh I have been waiting for this!” Rumlow’s boot pinned Tony in place on the ground as the omega tried to belly crawl away. Tony couldn’t see Rumlow’s face, but the telling clink of a belt buckle being undone was enough to send Tony spinning into a panic, frantically trying to buck free of the hold. Rumlow just dropped more pressure on his foot until Tony’s lungs felt like they were being crushed.
“Fuck you!” Tony bit out, spitting in Rumlow’s face in a supremely stupid act of defiance he couldn’t bring himself to regret. He didn’t get to enjoy it long. Tony’s teeth rattled with the backhanded slap, the blow sending him sprawling to the cold pavement, landing hard on his left shoulder that ripped a groan from his split lip.
“I don’t keep those kinds of records agent. Anything of consequence on my private server is encrypted to the gills and incomplete. Even if you could find someone to hack through, the data is rigged to purge without my biometric code. Safety first.” Tony smiled tightly without humor. It wasn’t a
in bubble gum pink frosting. Tony saw there were little white butterflies accenting the pearly trim...and sprinkles.
A small petty part of Tony thought with vicious satisfaction, even as he began to discard the notion. For starters, being ditched at a diner was a pretty clear signal that tall, blonde, and beefy was not interested, and even Tony wasn’t enough of an asshole to lose the guy his job just to spite Howard. Some perfectly innocent flirting on the other hand...Tony mused thinking of blue eyes and an adorably wrinkled brow, no harm in that. The silence on the other end however, began to stretch on uncomfortably.
“Remind him who’s in charge,” Pierce orders, then he leaves the room and shuts the door behind him.
“That’s not true,” Tony stands, ready to reach out for his son in case he tries to leave. He couldn’t let him go. Not after everything they’ve been through. “Pete, please? I didn’t know he was there.”
“Are you kidding? I could never get tired of you two. I love having you here. It feels...right.”
Tony checks each room, searching for the one his son had been in. He remembers being in an elevator at one point and searches for that instead. Once he finds it, he presses the button to call it and hopes none of Pierce’s men are inside.
She decides to do it anyway. If Peter could talk about his crush then so could she.
Peter frowns and peers up at his dad. “No you didn’t. I didn’t see you at the base. I snuck inside and you weren’t there.”
Steve sighs harshly. “What happened to the other approach?”
“I don’t know. I don’t know.”
“No, it’s okay. You two have fun. I’ll entertain myself the only way I know how.”
“So do I.”
“But you’re not-”
Peter shakes his head again. “My uncle Bucky was right. You did kill him.”
Tony sets the frame down so that he can pull Steve into his arms. He kisses him gently, lovingly, their lips moving perfectly in sync with each other. Tony pulls away and rests his forehead against Steve’s.
Flash was clearly suffering, maybe more so than Peter and the chicken. He keeps his gaze down, as if he only had eyes for the food and nothing else. His plate has barely been touched. The mashed potatoes have been pushed to the opposite side, but otherwise his dinner remains intact.
“He’s going to help,” Tony assures while he rubs soothing circles along Steve’s back, “and then pretty soon you’ll be okay. You’ll feel like yourself again.”
“I still want you. Steve is comfortable with you. Honestly, I think I scared him a little bit back there. He’s used to people.”
“I love you, sweetheart,” he whispers, bringing her up again to give her another kiss.
He doesn’t put up a fight. He doesn’t scream, scratch or kick. He lies completely still, letting the alpha use him however he wanted.
“I’ll do my best,” Steve says.
“Let him go,” Rumlow orders.
“Yeah well blame Stark.” Clint rolls his eyes and gets up from the couch. “It’s his damn fault.”
“Is it okay?” Peter asks, this time panicking for a whole other reason. He can’t help but feel like he’s already screwed up somehow.
Tony needed him.
“You don’t need him. I honestly wanted to kick his ass when I found out what he did. You’re my best friend, Steve, and I’d do anything for you and this kid. I promise to protect him with my life. And unlike Stark, I’ll keep my promise.”
He never gets the chance. The urge to fuck is overwhelming. He doesn’t waste any more time and he thrusts a finger inside. The omega moans in delight, his back arching off the bench. He’s so tight and wet; Tony can only imagine how great he’s going to feel wrapped around his cock.
Steve somehow finds the ability to force aside the thoughts of their future child and focus on his tasks. He has a team to run and protect; a world that is always needing saving. Thinking about the family he desperately wanted to have would have to be put on hold.
Steve was being dramatic, but it was true. Tony wasn’t coming back.
“Because this is when I run. Now come on.” Steve pats his son’s leg and gets up, shaking his head on his way out when Peter groans again.
“Bye!” Harley practically screams and waves his hand.
“You didn’t have a choice. You were chosen-”
“Well, it was,” Tony answers. “But then someone else liked it a little more and the rest is history.”
“Must be all that super serum,” Sam jokes as both he and Bucky finally catch up. Bucky glares in his direction and elbows him hard in the ribs. “Ow! What was that for?”
“You should go,” Natasha tells Tony.
“I can’t wait to meet you,” Steve says softly to the bump and he presses a kiss to Tony’s belly. He traces the dark line that’s starting to appear, eyes flickering up when Tony shifts. “You’re beautiful.”
“It’s not your fault,” Bucky tries to assure.
“You can sit where you like,” Tony says, waving his hand around the room. Steve nods and takes a seat in the first chair he sees. He curls in on himself, making him appear smaller than he really is. Tony had never seen someone so broken. “You want something to drink? I have water, juice, coffee. I think even some tea.”
