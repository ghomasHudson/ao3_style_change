Sam shifted uncomfortably at the doorway. So this was Daphne, the wife of the amnesiac Cas. She seemed to be a kind woman, even though she was anxious right now. But her reaction was understandable. Everyone would be confused in a situation like that. And she was worried about her husband too. He was glad Cas had been found by her and not by someone else.
The younger man’s eyes widened with shock and made an attempt to say something but instead he chocked on his own blood and fell on the floor.
“Sariel, Beelzebub, Abaddon, Mammon, Belphegor and Asmodeus were the six most powerful angels that followed Lucifer” he explained. “They ruled Hell together until Lucifer was locked inside the Cage. Without their leader they went on separate ways, hiding mostly, blending in with humans.”
Elisa sighed and a smile appeared on her face. The first after man long days.
The portal was gone.
Cas sighed and sat down. He rubbed his forehead with both of his hands.
“The truth” Sam had said, leaning a bit forward, searching for Dean’s eyes. “Because every time Cas leaves or Cas dies, you’re always like this. You’re drinking, you get angry when he’s mentioned, and you try to avoid the subject like it burns you. And do you know what that reminds me of?”
“My Grace is not corrupted.” Hannah swallowed hard. She felt dizzy. All these confusing questions… Shouldn’t she be the one interrogating Metatron? Why was
’ Sam asked with concern.
“I’m sorry, I’m busy right now” Castiel said without looking at the angel and walked through the portal.
“Sit down already.” Meg grabbed his arm and pulled him down on the chair next to her. Sam unwillingly but let her do it. “Now. Tell me, how do you plan to stop the ripple?”
“Yes?”
“I heard about a virus around the area” he said. “It causes high body temperature. Maybe you should get your daughter checked by the doctor.”
They had no destination as they walked. They made their way through the small woods and arrived to a meadow. It was a warm afternoon, a gentle breeze moved the leaves behind them, and the only sound was the insects all around them.
Coldness ran down Bobby’s back. That stupid,
Now it hit a sore spot in Castiel. He didn’t want to remember that night.
“Do you trust me?”
Castiel nodded.
“Okay, so, your enemy is my enemy?” Dean pointed at the angels. “We take you back to the bunker and keep an eye on you. Then decide if we can trust you or not. But first you give us your blades.”
Dean leaned in, touching his forehead to Cas’.
No, no, no.
Leaving the Cage locked meant no possible cure for Dean. Dean would stay a demon controlled by the Mark, sinking into darkness deeper and deeper. There may be an other way to help him but the ripple was getting closer and there was no way he would leave his brother behind. Cured or not, he would take him with them.
“Cas?”
“I… met with some difficulties but I’m fine too.”
In the mirror Gadreel could see Dean staring at the back of his brother’s head. There was something in his gaze that reminded the angel to a cracked window. Still dividing the inside and the outside but the forces of nature and humans already frayed it. Either the wind or a careless human could break it if one didn’t take care of that crack.
But I won’t give into it. I won’t give it the satisfaction to be in charge again. I am the master of my own body, not that piece of crap! Once this timeline gets erased I and the Mark on my arm will case to exist. It will happen in a few days or weeks. I can’t wait. I’m a bigger threat than the Leviathans. At least the Leviathans can be destroyed. Me on the other hand…
He had to find a solution because what Cas had suggested was insane. They couldn’t kill Dean and hope that in the past everything would be the same. No. Dean wouldn’t be the same. Everything he had learnt and went through would be for nothing. What if they go back to the day when the angels fell? Dean would make the same mistakes again. Or what if they go back further? The day when Dad was on a hunting trip and he hadn't been home in a few days? Those ten years of growing would be garbage. They had to cure Dean first and take him back with them.
While he was doing that with the small portion Kevin had previously translated, the prophet tried to translate the rest of the tablet too. Pain was hammering his brain but he ignored it. He was too excited to stop now. Symbol by symbol, word by word, he wrote the Enochian into Elamite.
“What is it?” he asked.
“Did something happen?” she asked.
Dorothy exhaled a long breath and from the dead goddess she looked at Charlie who was so pleased with herself her eyes were twinkling like stars in the light of the blue flames.
Hannah placed two fingers to the man’s temple and wiped his memories. It was drastic, she knew that, but the human deserved it. His soul was so rotten she was surprised it wasn’t a demon. But he would be. With a soul like this he wouldn’t go to Heaven.
Cas put a hand on his shoulder and looked into his eyes.
“It’s my concern, Dean. You’re my partner in crime. But.” he places a finger on my lips when he sees I’m about to interrupt him. I make a step backwards. “I respect your wish. Back to business then?” He leans forward like he wants to share a secret. He’s too damn close in my opinion. His voice is low when he continues. “There are some unwanted individuals I want you to get rid of. Good friends of Abaddon. Might cause some problem in the future.”
Timmy’s mom in all her ghostly ugliness.
Castiel shook his head.
“Hang on” I tell him even though he can’t hear me. It’s mainly for keeping myself calm. “I zapped with a passenger only once. And poor Gavin threw up.” I laugh but it quickly fades. “Poor kid… But I think you can handle it. You know how it feels. You flew around all the time when you had wings.”
Sam, Jody, Charlie and Dorothy all turned to the source of the voice. It was a girl with long dark hair and blue eyes, looking like she had been walking for days in the wild. But despite the dirt that covered her face, Sam could easily recognize her.
“Cas?”
Thomas quickly noticed him. He frowned at the angel.
“Do you…” Castiel’s eyes observed every part of the library before they settled on the woman. “Do you hear that rumble?” When Daphne shook her head he turned to Becky who too looked at him questioningly. “Is that just me?”
Dean saw the eyes of that woman again and he almost couldn’t fight back the shiver that threatened to shake his whole body.
worse.”
“Yeah.”
Sam sighed and rubbed his nape. It was still just their dead allies coming back but it wouldn’t take long for the first Leviathans to show up as well. And Sam didn’t want to wait for it to finally happen.
“Sam Winchester is a curious case, but he’s not my concern.” He looks deep into my eyes. “It’s you.”
Castiel blinked and he was back in reality again. Nora watched him carefully, like a mother would look at her child. How foolish of him when he hadn’t noticed the signs. But he had been human only for a few weeks back then. No wonder he hadn’t recognized the purely friendly way she had been looking at him. Like now.
“Dean?” Sam asked, looking at his brother like he just grew a second head. “You sure you’re okay? Not that I mind the company but…”
“Why do you collect pain?” Sam asked. “What does Sariel want to do with it?”
Before I can react, my lungs become flat all of a sudden. I gasp for air but not even a little amount gets inside me. I grab for my chest and start chocking.
“How?”
“What is it?” Hannah asked, walking to his side and peeking at the phone. “What is this location?”
“Crowley? You were with Crowley?”
“I apologize for frightening you like this” he explained. “Sam told me that while he is dormant I should take a look at your translation. I saw that the Demon King wasn’t a great help previously.”
But after two days there was still nothing.
finally left the building. The goddess looked around and once she was in her car she drove away. Charlie followed her.
“Uh.yeah. Me too?”
Sam blinked at Becky for a few times. Was she always that smart under the layers of crazy fangirling? He was positively disappointed at her.
Cas nodded and after a last squeeze he pulled back. Dean immediately missed his touch.
He didn’t know why he called Ed. Maybe because he didn’t want the guy to end up like him? Or it was only an impulse. But it gave them the lead they needed. And now he was sitting in the Impala with the most uncomfortable company ever.
She reached the door successfully and knocked loudly with urgency. She heard someone walking up the stairs and the door opened. Hannah didn’t even wait for it to open properly.
“We split up” Dean said, turning on his flashlight. “I look around upstairs, you two here.”
I turn around and just then open my eyes. Dora is still chirping happily in the background while the smell of blood enters my nostrils.
I look at the table again. There are a bunch of O type blood bags, stolen from some hospital probably. I wonder what the priest had thought when Sam asked him to make it holy blood. And what about those who needed that blood? O is the universal blood type, it can be given to anyone. What if there’s a big accident and nobody knows the poor casualties’ blood types but can’t give them any because Sammy stole it to give it to a demon. Yeah, great.
He thanked the man for his help and walked around the building.
Sam watched the hand. The time, the only time, he had held Hannah’s hand resurfaced in his mind. The soft white skin. How good it felt in his hand. The memory warmed up his cheeks and giving in to a strong impulse he stood up too and took the angels hand.
Dean watched him silently for a while. From a certain point of view they went through the same thing. Cas had played ‘God’, Dean had been a demon, and both of them had been taken over by the power those things had provided. And now that he thought about it, the same thing had happened to Sam too with that whole demon blood thing.
“Where is he?” the older man asked.
Castiel had so many questions to ask, but a sudden weakness took over his body. The warmth from all around his body travelled down to the palm that was touching the Empty.
they get back, they can join us. Who else?”
It was painful. Her whole being trembled and burnt and she almost pulled back. But then she remembered Castiel. How great was his pain. Was it like this? Or greater? She couldn’t turn back because it hurt. If Castiel could go on with a constant pain, she could bear this short time.
He heard Cas sighing then a hand settled on his forearm, his right forearm, right where the Mark used to pulse and send angry demands to him. Cas’ hand was warm, his grip firm but gentle. It was something he could hold onto. A stable point in his life that would never leave him.
Castiel’s hands curled up, crinkling the fabric of his pants under them.
Sam had to realize that this hellhound was stronger than the one he had wrestled with. It towered over him like an elephant, its muscles were like stone, and the weight that pressed on his chest was unbearable. He had to fight to inhale, even though he shouldn’t have to breathe with the angel in him.
“Actually yeah, Bonnie” Charlie started then quickly added with worry. “Can I call you Bonnie?”
Castiel’s eye twitched. If his Grace was still out there somewhere and hadn’t been destroyed in the spell…
“She was on her way home when the angels took her” he continued. “They didn’t tell her anything, nor asked.”
“Just hear me out!” She held up her hands in defense. “First I went to Metatron because I thought he somehow controlled me. I remembered what you had told me about Naomi so I feared he was doing the same with me. During our conversations I heard some information from him he normally shouldn’t know about.” Hannah paused to lick her lips. “Like the Colt incident between you and Dean.”
Hannah observed the female’s soul. She found it unsettled and by the mention of ‘Chicago’ her soul shivered.
“Now what?” Charlie asked. “We call Dean?”
“Wait…” he asked with disbelief. “You knew Henry? Henry Winchester?”
The future where Lucifer had Sam, nine out of ten people was a croat, and I was a jerk who let his men – including Cas – die.
At this Dean finally turned to look at him. His eyes were narrower as he watched him.
(See the end of the chapter for
But he couldn’t finish. And unknown force grabbed the angel and ripped him away. Sam tried to reach out towards him but he was too far away already. And as soon as Gadreel was gone a burning wave of pain spread through Sam’s body and he couldn’t help but fall on his knees and hope that a tree would stop him from rolling down to the road.
am my own man. For the first time in decades
Castiel was stunned. Dean had never been so open regarding his feelings. He was a man of actions, not words. He showed by gestures and care his affection, but never said anything.
Muriel, Malachi, his car. If the universe was a person, it had a bad taste of humor. Was somebody trying to make fun of him? Or was this a cosmic sign? Were these clues leading him on a path? But where would it take him?
“Like you cared” Dean murmured but it was easily head by a human’s ears too.
There was literally nothing at all.
Sam, thankfully, didn’t say a thing as he wrapped him in a bunch of warm towels. It was somewhat funny how now he was the one to be taken care of like this. It had been Dean who always treated Sam this way. Drying him when he had been a kid, warming him up when he had felt cold… It was his role to be the caretaker, not Sam’s.
“We talked a lot the day you ‘arrived’! You had the perfect opportunity to inform me!”
“It’s just a place I imagined in my meditative state” the reaper explained.
He just now realized how much he missed his Baby. As a demon he could appear anywhere around the world, he had just needed to think about it, so why would he sit in a car? Slow, frustrating, monotone. But now he regretted those thoughts because that had been one of the many proofs that he hadn’t been a human. The Impala was always his home, his shelter, and he had left it behind for the ‘
“It’s not that I trust him or not” Sam explained. “But isn’t it strange that he comes here and tells us we were followed? Just think about it. If the whole world is a play of chess, we’re only the dust in the air. We’re unimportant in the big game. I start to understand what Meg meant.”
Being in his body alone again felt scary all of a sudden. His body was only his again but somehow it felt too empty. He became good friends with Gadreel. The angel helped him a lot and was a really good company. Sam was sincerely worried about him. Where was he now? Back in his previous vessel? Was he injured? Or worse?
“What is it?” Cas asked with a faint voice.
“The Mark came from Lucifer” Hannah continued. “He gave it to Cain who then became his Knight. Following that logic he’s the only one who can take it back.”
“Let’s go then.”
’ Gadreel said. ‘
“And why isn’t he here instead of you? Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad to see you alive and everything, but why am I not talking to the big guy if he wants to talk with me?”
The teen glanced at her warily.
While Sam and Meg continued throwing insults at each other, Castiel turned his attention back to the text, but his mind wandered away.
Castiel was observing the spine of the books on the bookcases. The printed documents were in alphabetic order, sorted according to the period of time of their creation. It fascinated him how many books the Men of Letters could collect. They had dictionaries on different languages from different time periods, the oldest one from Mesopotamia, translating Sumerian to Hebrew. He also found maps in one storage room. The paper was so old it almost melted from his touch. He wished to read all the documents but deep down he knew he wouldn’t have much time and every minute he had he would spend looking for a cure for Dean. That was his top priority. When – because he was always hoping – they turn Dean back to a human and if – because he was a realist regarding himself – he was still alive at that time, he would just then take a look at those books as entertainment. He was certain Dean would look at him with bewilderment because who wants to read a dusty dozen thousand pages long codex for fun?
Bobby took a deep breath to calm himself down. He glanced at Becky who understood his silent request and quickly left the area with Lucy in her arms. When the two of them were out of sight he looked back at the hunters in the library.
meant God disowning their children, not loving them anymore and casting them out of Heaven.
The Winchester laughed lightly.
That was the moment when she woke from her mysterious daze. Her hand froze and her eyes widened. What was she doing? Because she had no idea. Her vessel was doing unexplainable things on its own and it was effecting her Grace too. And losing control over herself scared her. Castiel had once told her how an angel named Naomi had controlled him and other angels too. What if she was under someone else’s influence? What if… What if
“I love you too, Dean.”
“Dean…” Cas started with a warning and worried tone but Dean pointed at him.
This place. This was the beginning of something new.
“Oh! Aren’t you so adorable!” he said, ruffling Dean’s hair, who in return giggled with his mouth full.
Sleeping was never my friend. The wall I built up around my darkest thoughts and memories crumbled and flooded my mind at its weakest. Alcohol helped, if only there weren’t any headaches in the morning, but sometimes it wasn’t enough. Those times, after days without sleeping properly, I took a pill and fell unconscious for a few hours. I tried to avoid this as many times as I could. Maybe sleeping pills were good for giving me a dreamless night, but it also prevented me to be aware of my surroundings. With a pill I wouldn’t hear if somebody sneaked inside the room to kill me. I only took pills when I was sure it was safe. For example when Sam decided to do research all night, sitting at the motel table with his laptop open. Those times I swallowed the pill in the bathroom then went to sleep knowing that my brother was there guarding me, even though he didn’t know about it. Those nights sleeping was comforting. I felt safe. I could trust Sam, unlike my father.
Dean smiled at him.
He shouldn’t have come here. He should have known Crowley would just play with him, bruise his heart and soul more with his words. He had better to do than to listen to the demon.
A challenge. I just realize how much I missed it. Now that I can kill anyone and anything with the First Blade fights became too easy. Soon they’ll get boring. But if I can’t have a challenge in those then I’ll have with women.
“He’ll come around” Dean patted Sam on his shoulder. “So? When are we going?”
“No…”
Attached to the document there were some photos. The years didn’t make any good for them. The edges were torn, the paper yellow, but he could still clearly see the people on them.
“The female vampire changed her name because she had a daughter named Alex. So, you went there but the vampires found you and took her away.” Sam looked down at Jody and smiled. “You saved her then adopted her.”
“M&Ms?” Dean pulled out the little package and looked at the former angel with raised brows.
“Dean” Sam had started with a careful tone. His hand had been back on Dean’s arm. “Do you remember what Jack said? Chuck got too involved and that’s why he failed. If Jack brought Cas back, he would be the same as Chuck, meddling with all of our lives. Jack doesn’t want to influence us at all, he’s giving us the choice to choose our path ourselves. He wants us to earn every small and big victory we can have. To earn it on our own.”
I take a deep breath. Then an other. And a few more. I didn’t want to kill him. I didn’t. I wanted them to leave, to leave me alone and leave the feathers here. Why couldn’t they understand? And look what happened! He attacked me and my killer instincts took over. And now the Mark is laughing at me, sending sharp waves of pain through my body, glowing and burning and I can’t help but grab my arm and try to fight it back. I could fight it back once, I can do it again.
Castiel jumped and turned to his right. Not far away from him in a dark corner a man was standing with his back turned to him. He immediately recognised him. He put him together after all.
“No dirty shoes in the building!” a female voice warned them from below. The three stepped closer to the rail and looked down. Next to the map table stood Linda Tran with her hands on her hips, daring them to not listen to her. She was wearing some ill fitting cloths, probably Kevin’s. The jeans were rolled up and the shirt hung on her shoulders in a funny way. But the woman wasn’t in a funny mode. “I just cleaned the hallway.”
The other man furrowed his brows.
He would do it even if it would mean he would be lost forever. Or for a timeline.
“Here!”
The angel uncomfortably shifted from one leg to the other.
Dean looked up, confused.
He thought about the bunker and the life they could, no,
“What is it?” he asked but didn’t wait for the answer. He was already looking through the contents of the bag. He found a lot of apple, a few bottles of mineral water, a yogurt, oat bran bread, a package of grape sugar…
Metatron smiled at her like she was a fledgling who was still too young to understand the world around her.
“Why?”
About five days after I killed Mammon, I feel someone summoning me. Sam. I’m in a surprisingly good mood and I don’t mind my brother calling me to the bunker. Without disturbing Gavin’s ‘watching the great screen of sorcery’ time, I appear in the dungeon of my old home with a wide smile. And black eyes, of course. I always made sure Sam saw me with black eyes, so he would give up on me in time. That time hasn’t come yet.
Because yeah, the two of them were a pretty good team and she could kick any ass. A chastity group thing was an easy challenge.
Dean smiled widely. After quickly getting dressed they made their way to the kitchen for supper, Dean holding Castiel’s big hand with his tiny one.
“Out.”
Sam was about to start laughing when suddenly Dean reentered the library. He had two plates in his hands and he put one before Sam and the other before Castiel. Each plate had a sandwich on it. Sam looked at him with a frown.
Crowley leans on the table on both hands, mirroring me, and looks into my eyes. We’re almost just an inch away from each other. I can smell the sulfur on his skin, and see the flames of hell in his eyes.
shaking. The Mark was
“What have you done to her?” he hissed.
“You’re not useless.”
With a sigh Elisa’s soul left her body.
“You’re a sentimental fool, you know that?” Castiel swallowed back a little sob. “The barn where we met? Really?” Dean shook his head. He was now showing the angel his back. “Remember that I stabbed you in the heart? And you just looked at me with that ‘I can’t believe you were that foolish to do it, I’m an angel of the lord, you ass’ look. Ha! Good old times. You came in like a wrecking ball through that door. Now I don’t think you can lift a feather.”
They said goodbye to Sonny. Sam thanked the man’s advice and sat behind the wheel.
Fortunately, the roads were dry and the traffic was light, so they entered Colorado Springs almost forty minutes after taking the car. Castiel sped down I-25 like a madman, passing slower cars without stepping on the break. Next to him Muriel held on to the seat, her eyes wide with fear that they might crash. But Castiel didn’t slow down. He couldn’t. Susie’s chances to survive lessened with every passing minute.
“If you ask me, I don’t think we can trust Death” Meg said and crossed her arms.
“Oh, I won’t be alone. I’m taking Toto with me.”
“I can’t leave, Dean.”
Sam shivered at the thought. And it was just a thought. What would have happened if he opened the Cage for real? He didn’t understand what he had been thinking at that moment. Lucifer would help him? Really? Was he mad or something? Where had that thought even come from? How could he think it would be a good idea? He should have dropped it immediately…
“Remember that I stabbed you in the heart?” I smile as I recall that memory. “And you just looked at me with that ‘I can’t believe you were that foolish to do it, I’m an angel of the lord, you ass’ look.” I chuckle. “Good old times. You came in like a wrecking ball through that door. Now I don’t think you can lift a feather.”
Also. Same like Sariel, I have never heard of Samael and Raziel. The book says Samael was an angel of death too and Raziel was the Archangel of Mysteries. No ‘where they are now’ epilogue for them. Why weren’t they there during the Apocalypse? I have to ask Ca…
“Of course you don’t.” he swayed his head. “Then who’s the cause of your corruption? Poor fallen Castiel? I doubt that.”
Polysexual Sam was inspired by this art http://bluesilktie.tumblr.com/post/89824320089/at-last-i-finished-sam-done-in-the-polysexual Then I did some research and that was how I found the Crossroad Demon thing so I decided to use it.
- Headcanon: Dean liked Frozen because he could relate to Elsa. I've seen a lot of Supernatural/Frozen crossovers where Dean was Anna just because Cas could be Kristoff then. But no. If Dean is Elsa, then Sam is Anna. And Ruby is Hans. And Elsa's uncontolable power is the Mark of Cain.
In chronological order:
Hannah narrowed her eyes. Becky’s soul was shining, she had no bad intentions, but there was that grabbing motion it made towards Sam. It felt greedy and lustful as she reached out to it with her Grace then quickly pulled back when she sensed these. And Sam’s soul was pulling away from it too.
“Okay?” She turned to the two women but glanced back at Sam a few times. “Hi, I’m Jody Mills, sheriff of Sioux Falls, wants nothing to do with the wackadoo stuff but it always just happens.”
The old hunter turned around. Tamara stood at the top of the stairs of the library, looking at him with other hunters behind her.
I look down. The foot I stepped forward with is now outside the circle of blue flames. The fire is licking the back of my leg but I feel nothing but a gentle brush. There’s no heat, no burning.
This immediately swept away her rancor. Hannah felt cold spreading out in her vessel and her brain becoming numb.
The other Dean was pushed against a column and the nail sticking out of it impaled him through the back. There was a startled grunt coming from the other Dean.
Daphne was sitting next to the armchair where Castiel was seated. The woman looked up at her, eyes glistening with unshed tears.
“What I was planning with you? I tell you what I
“By going inside the Cage?” Ariel crossed her arms. “That would require greater power than an angel’s. Was this Alice really a human?”
Cas sighed on the backseat and looked down at his lap. Dean was sleeping a dreamless sleep. They had given him a sleeping pill earlier which he swallowed without protesting. That never happened unless the eldest Winchester brother had serious problems. It was a red alert sign Sam couldn’t help but notice.
“They never controlled” the Empty said. “They only…
fight against them because it
The sight broke Sam’s heart. He placed and arm around Dean’s shoulder and squeezed his arm.
“Of course I did! Everything was so dirty I can’t believe you didn’t get sick yet. Have you ever heard about the vacuum cleaner and the mop?”
Sam fought too with everything he could. He felt Gadreel drifting farther away, making way to the pain of his wounds caused by the trials. It was getting more intense with every passing second. His body was burning from the inside and he couldn’t concentrate. His reflexes were slower, his movements were shaky and powerless. He luckily managed to stab one of his attackers who approached him from the front, but a second one appeared out of nowhere and hit his head.
When the silence between them stretched out too long Gadreel glanced up warily. He was expecting to find anger on his brother’s face but instead he found thoughtful eyes watching the road.
I shudder and continue picking out the interesting parts.
Meg frowned at that.
“Here.”
“What is your destination?” she asked back when she finally managed to tear her attention away from the machine.
I’m about to zap out when I notice something. The parquetry is worn next to one of the bookcases. I step closer and examine it. Yes. Something is constantly sliding on the floor there. And that something must be the bookcase.
“We do stupid things” the younger woman said. “We all do. But we can’t let those drag us down. Your father knew how dutiful you are, the same as he was. He knew that you were out there, searching for the Wicked Witch, hunting her down. He died knowing you were a hero, protecting the innocents.”
Castiel quickly blinked a few times before he looked to his left. He hadn’t heard Daphne approaching him and now he was surprised to see her sitting next to him. He hoped she hadn’t been watching him for too long.
The angel’s head shot up and he locked eyes with the man. Cas’ eyes were wide and desperate.
“You’re not supposed to know that!” she protested. “You’re not supposed to make references!” She then frowned, glancing questioningly at Sam then back at the angel. “Or… Did Dean make you watch the movies?”
But Dean didn’t stop. He pulled the blade out and stabbed again. Then again. Again, again and again, until everything he could see was red, red and red everywhere on the ground, on the demon’s meat suit, on his blade, on his hand. He yelled out animalistic sounds, letting anger take over his body and mind, letting bloodlust awake inside him, losing the purpose of killing the demon in the storm of rage.
Castiel stepped closer.
The woman looked average. She was short, thin, had a pale colored hair and wore black cloths. But the relatively normal outside hid a twisted inside. Castiel had never seen anything like this. Her true form was a combination of light and dark, coexisting within the same being. He couldn’t tell what she was exactly but she was powerful. Just like Theo had said, Malachi refused her offer then the woman simply touched his forehead. Castiel saw Malachi’s Grace slowing down, sinking a little.
“Sam!”
I stand up and start pacing while I try not to look at the couch. There are many possible ways to go back in time. No, I correct myself. Just two that I know about, not counting Cronos. Angels can go back in time for one. But for that they would need wings, right? Without wings you can’t fly through time. Let’s hope they can’t.
They crossed the road, jumped across the ditch and made their way up the slippery mountainside.
beautiful thing he had ever
She repeated it like a prayer in her head as she left the prison.
“Then… thank you for warning me, I guess.”
On their way back to the bunker he thought about the woman and Cas’ stolen Grace but never about what had happened between the two. Namely killing all those angels. But if he had done so, he would have realized that the thought of that butchery didn’t scare him. Quite the opposite.
’ Sam insisted. ‘
“We’ll figure out what it is” he reassured him.
“I am sorry, Dean.”
“You drove Baby?”
Normally Dean would have been annoyed by this. Cas was treating him like a kid. But nothing was normal so he soon found himself walking on shaky legs towards a bench under the shadow of a tall tree. The former angel walked right next to him, ready to catch him when needed.
Oh. He didn’t want the same to happen to him. This was actually… nice of him? Strange.
As Dean left the office he swore he could hear the nurse muttering about how stupidly stubborn he was but he resisted to turn back and say something about nurses. He was glad that he could finally leave. He wanted to get back to the bunker as soon as possible and start planning. At this time Abaddon and some very crazy angels like Bartholomew were still alive and Metatron was not rotting in jail. They had to be careful to not attract too much attention.
I didn’t go back yet and I’m not planning to. I didn’t like it downstairs. It smelled. Crowley sent a few of his goons after me but I cut them down with ease. He must have realized that he wouldn’t gain anything with me killing his men so I haven’t seen any of them in a while.
He was back. He was really back in the Gas’n’Sip. They did it. They managed to get back before the ripple could reach them. Castiel took a deep breath and tried to feel the stolen Grace inside him but there was nothing. He was human again. It was fantastic. Being human was fantastic.
He snuggled into the chest. “I
Dorothy smiled and leaned closer to give a peck on Charlie’s lips. The younger woman stopped talking, then raised a brow, taking on her ‘seductive face’ as she usually called it.
Sam closed his eyes. So Dean
“Look, man. Sam will tell you everything. I’ll be back tomorrow or the day after.”
He saw Dean’s body freezing as he heard the click. For a moment none of them moved then Dean looked back at him. The black eyes first met his then his gaze moved lower to look at the gun in his hands.
“The angels freed me. I killed Metatron and brought this.”
held him in place.
Sam swallowed.
“Well, that Father Time you’re looking for exists. I could feel his presence the moment I appeared here.”
“Know what?”
forward with ease.
Castiel looked back at the room. He didn’t know if it was just a coincidence or a nasty joke of the universe.
worry.”
I look down at my leg, not believing what I see. Are Devil’s Traps completely ineffective on me? Good to know.
Hannah took her phone and called Nicole. Nicole was the only human she could trust. The only human she would ever trust.
“You’re right. I can’t leave. My Grace is yours. But I won’t go back to sleep.”
God, he was such a coward… If there was a competition for ‘World’s Most Emotionally Incompetent Person’ he would win it without a doubt. He couldn’t deal with emotions, especially fears that scared the living shit out of him.
The demon to my right chuckles.
The 'covering eyes' moment was inspired by this beautiful artwork by Euclase http://euclase.deviantart.com/art/Mercy-485632954?q=gallery%3Aeuclase%2F12012864&qo=6
“The brothers still hold many grudges under the surface” he agreed. “I hope they’ll talk.”
That was when he saw them. About two or three hundred meters ahead of him stood the Rit Zein angel with his back to him, assumably facing Cas, who then slowly raised his hand towards the others head…
Dean didn’t seem to hear his words, nor see his reaction. His eyes were fixed on the gun like he was hypnotized by the sight.
And he found himself face to face with Daphne.
The body against him suddenly disappeared and he fell on the ground, shaking as he cried.
“About a month ago a woman appeared” he started. “We didn’t know where she came from or who she was, but… she
Dean sat down next to the angel and put a hand on his shoulder.
“There used to be seven archangels created by God at the dawn of time” she started. “But not all of them served under God. Two of them, Sariel and Samael, got their orders from Death too. Death is the personification of a primal force, like Life and Time. This world is too small for him to pay too much attention to it, so he named Sariel and Samael as the guardians of death here, and the leaders of the reapers. I was under Sariel’s command, until…” Tessa paused for a moment, eyes dropping to the ground. “Until ze followed Lucifer.”
Dean had a long and relaxing sleep in his room. Finally. Knowing that everything was fine around him and his family was soothing. He didn’t have nightmares – neither normal dreams but he didn’t miss them, – he didn’t have headaches, didn’t feel dizzy. Once or twice his ears rang when he turned too quickly or leaned too low but it quickly passed. He felt great.
Dean cowered smaller.
The skin was healthy.
Just when his friend pointed out he realized that he was breathing rapidly. The world started to become a big blur and his head felt dizzy because of that. He was hyperventilating. He did as told and tried to calm down. He didn’t want to faint again like so many chicks in those cheesy movies so he took one slow deep breath and exhaled with the same pace. This lasted for a few minutes and Cas didn’t stop holding him.
“You, Dean, Cas and Hannah” she answered. “That moment back in the library? It raised some questions. I don’t think you know what happened to Dean and what that glaring contest between Cas and Hannah meant. I’ll ask Dean later. But you.” Charlie looking properly at the man. “What’s going on with you?”
Dorothy held back a breath and closed the file. She found a box with her name on it in one of the storage rooms for unsolved cases. She was just looking for some information about that mysterious woman. Instead she found this and here she was now, reading her father’s long reports of his missing daughter.
“What is this supposed to mean?” I ask, pointing at the flames around me. I’ve never seen anything like this. The fire is blue and has a unique kind of power radiating from it. The demon side of me tries to move away, while my human side wants to get closer.
Crowley gets over this quickly and continues with renewed enthusiasm. He even tosses me once more, the decoration now bruising my spine.
open up a little.
I’m laying on my side in the grass for a few minutes now. I’m miserable, I know it. If others could see me now, they would laugh their asses off, I’m sure. But I can’t pull myself together. I can’t stand up and go back to the cabin and…
Jody turned away from her laptop and leaned back in her chair while she folded her arms.
Metatron slowly stood, leaning against the wall for support. He wiped his face, looking at his bloody hand instead of her as he answered.
“How do we stop her? And how do we find the vics?” Charlie’s eyes brightened as she got an idea. “Do I have to do the dirty with Suzy?”
“So…” she started with a low voice. “We’re going for Castiel.”
Sam turned to look out the window. Darkness covered the land around them, only the headlights and a few billboards giving some light. Gadreel drew back, waiting patiently for Sam to calm down and collect his thoughts. He found the brothers’ arguments pointless. The protection of one’s own kin was praiseworthy and Dean did everything to protect Sam. Gadreel had thought that showing Sam his memories would make him understand. It seemed he had been wrong.
Castiel was dying.
Cas is not dying.
Home, sweet home.
“Metatron can help us” Theo explained. “He can stop this madness.”
There was a light in Castiel’s eyes Gadreel couldn’t explain. It was a human look, so distant from an angel’s but Castiel was not an angel for a long time now. And it didn’t have any connections to the loss of his Grace.
“Don’t get into unnecessary fights, got it?”
He sighed and looked behind him. Sam nodded and Dean showed him a thumbs up with a smile. Castiel took a deep breath and walked up to the door.
This Bonnie Fuschau annoyed the hell out of her. Her voice was annoying and her toothy grin was annoying. Not just that but the way she looked at her and Charlie creeped her out. She had seen more horrible creatures in her life but somehow this woman stood above all.
“What…?”
“Charlie!” He hugged and lifted the sister he never thought he’d have. Damn, he missed her so much. “Good to see you!”
with you.”
“We should act as we do on any other case” Castiel agreed, turning his attention away from the window. “Investigate.”
“I already did it.”
Castiel smiled at the man thankfully. Knowing that his friends would be just on the opposite side of the road while he was inside gave him strength to get out the car and walk to the front door.
The angel touched the human’s soul and entered is dream. Gadreel found himself in the bar. It was a rainy day and many people entered to find shelter until the sun was shining again. Thomas was busy with the glasses, refilling them with hasty movements. Gadreel felt the dream shifting slightly towards a nightmare, Thomas probably feared that he would fail at his job. The angel walked to one of the empty chairs and sat down.
Dorothy looked at Charlie. Her vision was a little misty so she rubbed her eyes.
“I’ll accompany you” Hannah was heard from the backseat. Glancing at her, Castiel saw the look the other angel was shooting at Dean who didn’t even bother to argue as he got out of the car.
Castiel stepped into the room and closed the door behind him. Dean’s living quarter looked… nice. Unlike Sam’s room, this one felt like a place someone could call a home. The weapons on the wall were carefully arranged, one of them being the blade Dean wielded in Purgatory. There weren’t a day he hadn’t thought staying in Purgatory would have been better for all of them. There wouldn’t have been any spells to banish angels from Heaven, no war between his siblings. He would gladly go back if that would make everything better.
. Because he had never seen Dean like this. This genuinely happy, open and honest. It was like the last day hadn’t left any scars on him. Or if it did, Dean managed to work it out himself. But the how was a mystery.
The demon returns the smirk then sinks his hand inside his pocket.
“By Metatron and I don’t know why. He shouldn’t know about you.”
“And I’m going with you” Cas told him. The two of them looked at each other for a while and it was nothing like Charlie had read about. Not even like the ones she had seen since she came back from Oz. Dean and Cas were looking at the other like they were hiding a painful secret.
“If we can go back in time Dean would be the same again” he said.
“Look out!” she yelled.
Dean was happier than ever.
“I still don’t believe it’s Sariel” Hannah said after Dean fell asleep. “Yes, ze had fallen but ze had never been a problem as a demon. Ze wasn’t there with Lucifer when Michael cast him into the Cage unlike the others. What changed?”
Cas looked at the closest clock, rubbed his eyes and narrowed them to see what time it was.  He groaned then, not understanding how he could be up so early. It was just eight.
The ripple growled around him, mocking him for his misery. Sam took a few deep breaths. He knew he had to go. He had to go to Father Time and try to fix everything. But it was so damn hard to move! It was so
“My uh… nerdiness.”
“I’m still waiting for my brandy” the scribe complained, not paying attention to the shocked Gadreel next to him.
“Dean.”
Dorothy sighed and moved her hand so they can lock fingers. She didn’t look up but she could feel Charlie’s warm gaze on her.
“Don’t…” Dean protested but it was already too late. The pain left his body and he was sure his face was as healthy as ever. “Don’t waste your Grace.”
He wanted to kill him.
“I’m fine” the angel insisted but then Hannah, mimicking Sam, put a hand on his other shoulder.
“Earlier you didn’t mean the entirety of humanity.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Like the nightmares. He hated those with a passion. Every time he woke up he felt so vulnerable, because what if those monsters were real and were in his room and right under his bed waiting for him to get out of bed and grab his ankle and yank him into the shadows. He knew these were foolish childish fears but fuck… He met monsters every day since he had been four. Of course he was afraid of them!
They stayed silent again for a few minutes but unlike the previous one it was more comfortable. Castiel relaxed more into the chair and looked around curiously. All the medical equipments were fascinating. He admired humans for their creativity too. Inventing so many things in so little time seemed so impossible but they managed to do so. It saddened him how most of his sibling treated them. They called them ‘mud monkeys’ and underestimated their intelligence. In a way they were their siblings, the creations of their Father too. Like in Tolkien’s works. The Elves were the immortal children of Eru Ilúvatar, connected to this world till the end of it. And Men, the Secondborn bear the Gift of Men, which allowed them to shape their own future, not bounded by fate, and after their death they could leave behind this world.
“When I was volunteering to help the medics this summer” she started with a low voice, like she was about to fall asleep, “I read a lot of books, you know? I want to be a doctor one day so I have to learn a lot. You know what was really interesting? Blood loss. Five liters of blood circulates inside our body and the more you lose the less chance you have to survive.” She looked down again at her wound. “One liter of blood, twenty percent of total blood volume. Full pulse, heart rate elevated, blood pressure and respiratory rate are normal. A liter and a half blood, thirty percent of total blood volume. Anxiousness and confusion. Weakening pulse, blood pressure decreased, respiration rate thirty breaths per minute and increasing. Two liters of blood, forty percent of total blood volume. Very confused and lethargic. Pulse is very weak, heart rate above one hundred twenty beats per minute, breathing fast and shallow. Good chance to die at this point. Two and a half liters of blood, fifty percent of total blood volume. Unconsciousness. Pulse is absent, heart rate is one hundred forty beats per minute or higher, blood pressure very, very weak, breathing very fast and shallow. No chance to survive.” Susie laughed weakly. “I think I lost two liters.”
Castiel recalled that night. How Ephraim had attacked him, how much danger Castiel had put little Tanya in… No. He couldn’t do that again. And now that he was thinking about it… He knew where Ephraim would strike next. He would kill that poor high school student. What if he would get there before him? What if he could save the girl from a meaningless death?
Poor kid…
“Now he feels useless.”
They decided they wouldn’t open debates about these small things, but agreed that Charlie was probably right.
Dean turned back to his food with a smile.
I'm so not ready for the mid-season finale...
Sam narrowed his eyes, glancing between the mirror and the road ahead. The van honked again, getting closer to them.
“Remember Gavin?” Sam continued after Dean nodded. “His presence in our present caused a ripple effect. Bobby couldn’t summon him, we couldn’t change the deal and Bobby didn’t die when Dick shot him.”
“I’ll start from the beginning and please, no matter how much you want to cut in, don’t. It’s… difficult to talk about for the three of us.”
I crouch down and look at him. Really look at him. His dark bangs, the stubble dusting his jaw and cheeks, the dry lips, the circles under his eyes and the crinkles at the corners. I look at them, burning everything into my memories because maybe this is the last time I see them. This may be the last time I see
so hard it almost knocked him out? He was a human and he had only gotten an aching shoulder. Or… Was he really a
Hannah looked up. Sam stood before her, looking down at her with worry and she noticed his temperature rose a bit. And seeing him being this close… Her Grace was getting hot as well like the surface of a star. It spread through her vessel, but at the same time she shivered. Opposite sensing again.
– tongue but Sam didn’t think they gave the knowledge to other demons. Especially to the ones who were against Lucifer.
Dean’s voice was muffled by his scarf so it took Sam a moment to realize that yes, Dean had really said what he had heard. He suddenly didn’t know what to ask first. He gaped for a few moments then finally pulled himself together.
Silence fell on the bunker. Every eye turned to the door, everyone waited for the reveal of the arriver.
Castiel had a favorite sibling, yes. Just like every one of his siblings. Those who were rational and thought duty was above all followed Michael everywhere he went. The ones seeking knowledge spent their time with Lucifer. Castiel loved the archangels but one stood out from them. Or maybe… one who drew back to the shadows, never looking for a way to be in the center of attention. And Castiel, kind of a black sheep too, always found himself in hir company.
Dean froze under her hand for a while then got rid of the tension with a sigh. He put an arm around Charlie’s shoulder and pulled her into a side hug.
At least she now knew about Metatron’s plan. How he wanted to get his hands on the angel tablet and make himself a god. She could use that piece of information. She just had to make her own plan.
Dean crossed his arms and pouted.
through his body
“I’m getting too close to a human.”
“Hey, Sam.” Jody stepped back and looked at Charlie and Dorothy again. “You replaced Dean with the ladies?”
“I feel humans that way. One of them has weak vital signs.”
“You’re boring.” He turned around and walked back to the other end of the cell where he took a seat. “You can’t ask anything, just repeat this again and again. You can’t give me the right question.”
“It’s a long story.”
“No” Sam disagreed. “She used Enochian symbols. Altered ones, like at the vampire nest. Just two types of supernatural beings can use it. Angels and demons.”
“I’m not going anywhere, Dean” Cas whispered into his ear, rubbing Dean’s back with one hand while the other pulled him closer.
Ohoho. So many things are going on here.
Dean turned back to the ceiling and put an arm – his right one – over his eyes.
“And!” The prophet finally stopped and looked at the hunter. “There’s an angel named Gadreel in you who saved you from certain death without your knowledge who then killed me but it’s okay! He’s a good guy! Metatron just tricked him!”
Castiel closed his eyes and concentrated. He recalled a familiar face in his mind and focused on it.
“Whenever you’re ready” he said. “I’m listening.”
Meg threw her head back and laughed. The sound gained a disapproving glare from Tara and scared Daphne who just passed through the main area. She left in a haste.
“Alice wrote in her diary that Sariel needed to wait until Elisabeth was old enough to say yes to her. And only angels need the vessel’s consent, demons don’t.”
He didn’t notice when Tessa stepped closer and put both of her hands on his shoulders.
Metatron had said Hannah was getting closer to a human and that her Grace was developing a soul. Maybe the same had happened to Castiel. Maybe spending so much time with the Winchesters created a human soul next to his angelic Grace.
“I’m not a monster, Sammy…”
“That’s good then, isn’t it?” Dean asked. “Bobby’s alive.”
He shouldn’t have done that. Hannah was an angel and angels didn’t touch anyone just like that. Only if they healed or fought or flew with someone else. For them giving comfort was probably through talking or something if not a completely foreign act.
“Don’t call me that ever again” he whispered.
Named angel, the one in the male vessel, stopped. His companions did the same. The other two had female vessels, and while Hannah didn’t know one of them, the other one was familiar. Ariel, she remembered her name. She had met her a few times in Heaven.
What if Sam and Cas go back in time to stop Abaddon take Gavin?
Hannah slammed her clenched fist into the wall. Damn it! It was Metatron’s fault. He had kept her in the prison on purpose so she would be locked here. She had to find an other way. Sam and Castiel were in danger. If she could get there in time, they would both die.
Charlie didn’t expect Dean to say anything. She knew he would brush her off, saying she was just seeing things. She was honestly surprised when Dean put down the tools and sat down on the floor with his back against the car. Charlie quickly joined him, waiting patiently for him to start.
Cas shifted.
“Yes, and it’s getting closer.” Sam nodded. Ha was miserably hopeless. The ripple they had been trying to stop so much was now at their doorstep, knocking impatiently. He didn’t think they ever had a chance at all against it.
“I asked him to not listen.”
much he begged them to just
Hannah turned her head towards the south and frowned. It was Castiel.
And he felt the stab and the
“No, Dean. Everything’s good. Go back to sleep.”
“No” he answered. “There’s
“That wasn’t all, right?”
It took Vesta by surprise. She turned around to look at Charlie who already struck down with her stake. Dorothy did the same as soon as the goddess stopped paying attention to her and stabbed the deity in the lower back the same time as Charlie’s stake entered the goddess’ chest. Vesta’s mouth opened to a scream but the only thing that left her mouth was blue flames. It covered the entirety of her face which was still burning when her body hit the ground.
“I don’t know if I should laugh or be horrified that you know memes from the last decade.”
“Come out, come out, wherever you are!” I yell with a sweet tone. “Come on, Sammy! Let’s have some fun! Some brotherly bonding! We have a lot to catch up to! How long it had been? Three months?”
“Becky, I think the others are in the library.”
“I’m sorry” he said and looked at the woman. “It would never happen again. And Kevin’s staying alive, I’ll make sure.”
“Damn it, Cas. You hearing yourself? There's a war on, and it's on you. There's thousands of them out th…” Dean must have realized this was leading nowhere so he changed the direction of their conversation. He hardened his voice when he continued. “You said you lost your Grace, right? That means you're human. That means you bleed and you eat and you sleep and all the things you never had to worry about before.”
“How much longer do I have to see this? Wasn’t it enough the first million times?”
The hours passed slowly. Time was a heavy weight, pulling Castiel down by his arms. He moved with difficulties, had to reread sentences at least ten times before he finally understood the meaning. The words swirled before his eyes and soon he found himself dizzy. The angel rubbed his temples, trying to fight back the ache.
Castiel started walking towards the Empty. On his way he took a glance at the frozen forms of that nightmare he had to leave through millions of times.
Without saying anything Dean took the key, opened the door and got out the car. Sam followed him, frustrated.
Dean swallowed and tried to push away the thought.
“Apparently controls both angels and demons” Hannah muttered. She still had a hard time accepting this.
Working with Crowley is something I’ve never thought I would do. I still remember the anger I felt when I found out Cas was plotting with the demon behind out backs. But, as I already decided, Dean was weak. He didn’t understand the possibilities a partnership like this meant. And when he did, he only just scratched the surface. An information here, a little manipulation there. Dean never saw when Crowley was using him. I on the other hand do.
He hurt him. Twice. The first time because of a rush of emotions then because of some misunderstanding. Or maybe distrust. He remembered Dean acting weirder, more violent those days. The way he had beheaded that vampire… The things he had said to him after they left the Angel HQ… Dean hadn’t been himself. Or… He had just ignored his silent pleas for help?
“If he starts remembering, he will only make countless mistakes” Castiel interrupted her before she could finish. He didn’t want to hear about Emmanuel’s dreams again. “He will want to redeem himself and by that make everything worse. Just look at me.” Castiel put a hand on his chest. “I broke Heaven. I caused pain for my family.” He grabbed his shirt, hand shaking. “I even thought about killing myself. Do you want Emmanuel to think about this too? He was given the chance for a clean start. Don’t take it away from him.”
“What’s wrong?” Sam used his gentle voice. He talked to victims and relatives like this, reassuring them to share their pain and suspicions, he would listen to them. He didn’t know though if it was effective on Hannah. She was an angel after all.
“Meg?”
Castiel looked at her with wide eyes. An angel visited Daphne. One of his siblings wanted her as a vessel. Had she said yes? Was an angel in her now? Was he talking to an angel? Who was it? Friend or foe? What would he do if she attacked him? Would he hurt Daphne?
“Later I took some library books and bought a few used ones” he continued. “I got some children books too and gave them to Sammy. He never asked where those came from and I never told him. I just…” he paused. “I just wanted him to know the tales Mom used to read me. That, of course, never bothered Dad. Sam was a kid, he always told me. He needed protection and peace. But I always had to be an adult. And adults never read stupid fairy tales in their free time, right?”
“What do you mean? I should neither trust you? But you helped me.”
The same why he hadn’t told them anything specific about his time as a demon. The things he had done… They wouldn’t understand. They would only accuse him for being lazy and stupid for not looking for an other way. For not asking for help from them. They wouldn’t understand the struggle he had gone through. They wouldn’t understand that everything he had done was for
Bobby stepped closer.
“No” Dean said quickly, rubbing the back of his neck. “You’re right. You’re all grown up and everything. I shouldn’t forget that. Sorry.”
I hear his breaths. He’s muttering something in the distance. Maybe he’s praying? I snort. No use. There’s nobody up there to listen to him. Metatron hates us all. Why would he listen to Sam from all people?
Jody glanced at Sam.
“Let me finish!” The angel coughed a little then continued. “If I don’t survive this, please, don’t let my other self go to Crowley. Don’t let me abandon you two. Don’t let me take Theo’s Grace. Don’t let me forget about Claire and Daphne and who I really am.” Castiel bit his bottom lip then licked it. “Don’t let me go down that path again.”
Thomas paled a little.
Dean finally processed what the two of them were talking about. His acting and face was a split image of Kevin’s.
Sam felt the blood draining from his face. Werewolves never went for the arm, always the heart. Even if Dean had injured himself in a fight with one, there would have been scars not marks. And what werewolf? Hadn’t been John hunting a rugaru?
It only made Dean angrier.
“I got Sam’s number from Gadreel’s mind, which was the most I would willingly take for the pain that has to be endured, and called him.” Then he continued with the voice Gadreel had when he was in his other vessel. “It wasn’t that hard to do. Poor Sammy. First Zachariah tricks him to think you hated him, and now I did the same.”
Kevin laid down in the grass with his hands folded behind his head. Castiel sat next to him, watching Dean’s every move. He was not far from them, kneeling in the grass and observing something with deep concentration.
Castiel jerked his head up. He didn’t notice when Daphne walked up to him. She was wearing a gown above her nightdress indicating that she had been about to sleep or had been already asleep. She had an ice pack in her hand that she carefully touched to his nose. The ice burnt his skin and he closed his eyes. He welcomed that pain too.
Dean drove like he was high. The grin on his face couldn’t be wiped off by anything. Sam hadn’t seen his brother like this in a long time. Or ever. Dean’s genuine happiness was so rare he sometimes doubted it existed.
The woman’s eyes widened then a worried expression appeared on her face. He didn’t want to scare Nora but it was the truth. Maybe if the doctor catches that sickness in an early stage, Tanya wouldn’t have a fever.
Sam turned away and closed his eyes tight to distance himself from the scene but he couldn’t shut out the whispered apologies.
But he couldn’t just turn his back and run away. He came all the way here to save Cas and he wouldn’t leave without him. They leave together or Dean would die trying. There was no other option.
so would you
? Was that the right description? She was at a loss for words to tell exactly what she experienced whenever she was in his company.
Cas started coughing again. The grey puffs came out from his mouth with every cough. After a few steps he had to stop as the shaking of his whole body became too violent to move any further. Then the angel took a deep breath forcefully and his form bended forward.
His heart was hammering in his chest with both fright and a sudden surge of excitement because finally,
they didn’t expect it.
Castiel sighed and sat up too, slowly.
“We were different people in the past” Dean said thoughtfully. “No use going back and blaming yourself for those things. Just… Let it go.”
Cas looked up at him. His eyes softened and a smile grew on his face.
The other’s body was
I walk closer to the couch. The furniture is spotless even though there should be a lot of blood. It’s like nothing happened here.
“So angry he would kill his own brother?” Gadreel asked, still confused, to which Cas just shook his head.
They walked down the stairs to the door and Sam opened it with the key. When they were inside however, Dean immediately knew that something changed. Something was different than when he had left.
Sam coughed loudly, putting an end to the argument.
“I don’t believe you.”
“Some can possess extraordinary gifts” Cas explained.
So once an angel or not, she could neither trust Castiel. He was human, and humans were selfish and always lied. Muriel was blind to see it.
Daphne frowned. Curiosity was written all over her face.
The room was dark and chilling, just like he remembered. The only source of light was a single light bulb hanging from the ceiling that he turned on with a switch outside. The air was sickeningly dry. The Men of Letters couldn’t let any wetness ruin the devil’s trap on the floor. He had had a nasty and painful experience with one like that.
Sam took his phone from his pocket and the shotgun from the truck.
The angel smiled at Castiel. It lacked the kindness, promising a lifetimes long nightmare. This sadistic behavior reminded Castiel to Alistair. Even while captured he had used his words to injure and torture his captors. If he were created, Malachi would have followed Alistair to Hell and joined him in torturing.
hide under his blanket – and listened to music so loud his ears ached for hours.
“But we’re not dead” Charlie stated.
“Are you alright, Kevin Tran?”
(See the end of the chapter for
But when an innocent was bleeding out just a few steps away from him, he couldn’t help but struggle with the waiting.
Cas had his eyes fixed on the scene before him, the other Dean telling the other Sam to let him go, to not bring him back to life, then him taking his last breath.
Dean was about to get really sick.
I groan internally and close my eyes because I know this voice too well.
Charlie spun the stake in her hand, showing Dorothy her trademark grin.
Bobby watched the angel for a while. It was strange to see him acting like the angel he was and not just a human who somehow had angelic powers. Well, that wasn’t entirely correct. The last time he had seen him he still had that stick up his ass but now he was acting more like a human. The way he talked, the gestures. He was losing his holy rigidness.
“Hannah…”
“Interesting” the reverend said. “The only Winchester I knew was a Man of Letters.”
The Colt part is where I started NaNoWriMo this year :) I'm at 27300 words (the fic has 97634 words, oh my Chuck, this never happened before) and I haven't written in 3 days. My afternoon shifts in the daycare are tiring.
?” he asks with one raised brow.
Dorothy laughed.
Charlie put her free hand on her hip and looked at the ground. While she was thinking Dorothy looked around again. The world changed so much in the past decades. Charlie had warned her that outside the bunker nothing would be the same but she had never imagined this. Technology evolved into something she had only read in a few sci-fi books. Or more. Or less. It depended on how you looked at it. The cars couldn’t fly but they were nice, at least.
His hair was brushed back
Daphne bit her lower lip.
She had met Muriel outside Denver, having a quick conversation about Castiel’s intentions but neither of them could come up with an explanation. All Heaven knew about Castiel’s ties to the Winchesters, maybe they had set a trap for them? But getting closer to the diner, they hadn’t seen anything out of ordinary. No suspicious human was around so they decided to enter the building.
I lick my lips. Maybe I should… Maybe I should drop the act. Tell everything to Cas then Sam and come up with a solution. Together. Just the three of us like in the old days. We stopped the Apocalypse, right? We can stop this too.
The other day when he had been stomping back to his room he had almost tripped over his own leg, losing balance caused by dizziness. And that had never happened before. He had had to admit that the others were right. He had to wait to get better before he’d go hunting again.
“Hey!” Dean looked at him huffily. “Just one more day!”
“What?”
Finding Mammon was a bit of a challenge. Demon of greed, I thought he would probably be in a five star hotel surrounded by expensive food and fancy furniture. Or some exotic island drinking a cocktail with those paper umbrellas. But nope. Son of a bitch possessed a bank manager.
Sam’s heart skipped a beat. First he slowly walked down the stairs before answering.
I drop the Blade and fell on my knees. I dug my fingers into my hair and grip it like I want to tear it out. I killed an innocent kid whose only crime was to be the only one who could fix time. And I killed him.
When Bobby had first held his daughter in his arms he thought it was a dream. Because how could a miracle happen in a time like this? How could an innocent soul like hers come to this world? Bobby had never wanted to be a father. He never wanted to turn into his own father, and after Sam and Dean died he didn’t think he deserved to be one. But looking down at Lucy who smiled up at him with so much happiness and love he couldn’t believe he had almost missed this out of him life.
They walked inside and stopped at the desk in a line. It was like they were three disobedient students who stood before their principal. Well, Crowley would make one nasty principal.
From the corner of his eye he saw Ms. Tran’s eyes widening.
“But we can’t go to Oz and ask to be blessed” Cas pointed out. “We have to find an other way to…”
“Thank you, brother. Sisters. I’m grateful.” He stood up. “It’s getting late. I’ll show you rooms where you can rest, then tomorrow you can go.” There, he looked at Dean, challenging him. But Dean just shrugged. “We’ll find you a vehicle in the morning.”
“Trapped?” I ask back.
He had said that after they locked Metatron away. Hannah remembered the unshed tears she had seen in the angel’s eyes and the way his gaze seemed to focus on something invisible to everyone else. The thought that Dean Winchester was dead had shaken Castiel so much he had wanted to become an emotionless angel again. Then he had found out that Dean became a demon and he was quickly lost in the sea of desperation.
“Sam.” Sonny’s deep raspy voice turned very serious. “Yes, Dean was sad to leave but the moment he looked out the window and saw you… He had a great time here but there was always something missing from him. Like the last piece of a puzzle. And that puzzle piece was you, Sam. Dean was a kid back then and every kid needs his family. Even though what his father did, he couldn’t stay because you were his family. He was not ready to let go of you.”
An other punch silenced him. He doubled over from pain and lack of oxygen in his lungs. Only Theo and the other angel prevented him from falling on the ground.
Nothing.
“Really? You would give up your Grace for a human?”
because he didn’t deserve it
“Stop it, Cas…”
after all he had done.
He hadn’t thought this innocent question would trigger his doubt of his identity again. He was not an angel anymore but was he a human? He had a better understanding in regards of a life as a human but was he considered one? If not then who was he? What did the Winchesters see him as? A sorry excuse of an existence, part of nothing, drifting where life carried him?
He felt so useless…
“Nice try, Sammy!” I shout after him. “You have to wake up earlier to capture me like that!”
He put away his phone.
I had fun writing Kevin. And I love writing Hannah. We know little about her so I'm fleshing her out my own way. Expect more from her in later chapters.
Sam made a face as he turned to look at her.
“You listen to me, you son of a bitch” he started with a stern voice. “Yes, you fucked up many times. Yes, I was angry at you many times. But don’t you ever wish to die because of these, you hear me? You always wanted good. And it was not your fault I died.”
“You’ll see why.”
“But it’s not about me now. It’s about you” she told him, looking into his eyes without blinking. “Stay close to Castiel. Let him and Sam protect you. Let them keep you safe.”
“Yes, sir” Dean nodded.
“No. You?”
like the fire he felt when he
When he jumped to him the blade was already at his stomach.
” he heard the ang… former angel’s voice. “
Dean shrugged. He avoided the teen’s eyes as much as he could.
“This just started. And the warding.” Dean looked at the walls with wide eyes as Gadreel continued. “I'm afraid I'm weaker than I thought.”
“I’m not a baby!”
The town where Thomas lived.
“He can’t come back” he said. All that sadness he’d felt inside him had been about to spill over and drown him in it. “He made a deal with the Empty. Jack’s life for his own. It would take him the moment he felt true happiness.”
“Also, you can’t smoke or drink any kind of alcohol or caffeine for the next month.”
Dean raised a brow.
“You can speak.” He heard
Familiar metallic smell entered his nose. His stomach twisted and in the sudden fear that he would pass out and would drown in his meal he had an hour ago he leaned against the shower wall and looked down.
“Talk?” he shook his head. “I don’t know, man. Neither of them is into the touchy-feely stuff.”
He felt Cas’ intense gaze on him. He was too embarrassed to look up so he fixed his eyes in the box, counting the books.
He left Heaven in a few minutes. It was nighttime, the stars decorated the dark canvas of the sky. In the distance he could see black clouds approaching. It would be raining in a few hours.
“Cas, what happened?”
“Jody, they are Charlie and Dorothy. It’s a little complicated to explain but they’re going to solve this case.”
Jody smiled at him.
on Earth, it had shaken him to the depth of his soul, giving him the kind of understanding that he’d always lacked in the past more than a decade.
The same thing happened to my family. We were on our way down to Lake Balaton when the engine got overheated. My father remembered how racecar drivers would cool their cars so he turned on the heating and we rolled down all the windows. And it happened this summer so you can imagine how hot it was inside the car.
Un-beta'd.
Gadreel did as he was asked. This experience was new for the angel. His first vessel Thomas, who worked as a bartender, had been dormant the whole time he had occupied his body. But now Sam controlled his own body and Gadreel was just a…
Hannah didn’t listen to him. Passing Metatron’s cell, she sent a powerful wave of Grace towards the guards. The angels let out a startled cry before they hit the wall at the end of the corridor and passed out. She took the key from one of them then walked back to the cell.
“It happened.”
“I can’t not think about it” he admitted. “I feel my life wasting away.”
“Wha…”
“Don’t know, don’t care” Dean answered instead of the angel and leaned on the table with both palms and looked at everyone. This gained a disapproving glare from Hannah. “But there are monsters out there who are friends to us. We can’t let these demons kill them.”
Becky quickly excused herself and continued her way towards the kitchen. Sam stood there for a long time, staring at the nothing in front of him. And as he stood there he heard his brother’s broken voice as he said:
“Sorry, angel, Dean’s not home right now. Do you want to leave a message?”
“That creature is Sariel?” Josiah added.
Dean felt anger erupting inside him. He hit the table with his fist which startled everyone around him. Cas almost dropped his mug.
Charlie grinned at her proudly.
“What do you mean?”
Dean shook his head.
This is the end of Act One. Starting with the next chapter every third or fourth chapter is going to be from a special point of view.
Gadreel frowned at that.
Bobby frowned and nodded. Sam, Dean and him had been on that Amazon case. Then Emma had showed up to kill Dean and before Sam could have ended her Bobby had stopped him. Which later had turned out to be the best decision of all. Emma had turned out to be a nice kid, and Dean had liked her a lot and vice versa. It was a shame it had ended so soon. Bobby knew Emma was still mourning her father, lighting a candle every night for him.
He just stepped out of his room when he heard a voice calling him.
The other Dean laughed with his head thrown back and he raised his empty hand, showing his palm to Sam.
Maybe it wasn’t even a warding. There had to be something else in it. It was strange how the humans lived through the greatest pain of their lives.
Castiel took one last breath and waited for the death. The final death.
And so horrible.
“Do we have any other choice?” Sam asked.
I’m about to zap downstairs when I feel a powerful pull. It’s like the one last time but somehow it feels different. It’s coming from the bunker again. A part of me wants nothing to do with that place. I have to keep myself away from there, remember? But then I find myself blinking away the green, putting away the still bloody blade and I allow the power to pull me away.
Castiel’s heart ached more with every word. He remembered everything like it was yesterday. The first time he had seen the Righteous Man in person, not just his soul. Good old times.
The relief that washed over Dean was so overwhelming he had to lean against the railing not to fall on his knees. He pulled a hand down his face. He wasn’t a demon. He wasn’t a monster.
“I failed you, Dean.”
“No, you didn’t. You should have changed the flower to a carnivorous plant eating a bug.”
“Sam” he started as he walked closer to the two men. “It’s him.”
Dean took a look around, trying to find any indication that it was some kind of a trap. But everything was the same wound him. Nothing was there but the door standing in the middle of darkness. He could hear grunts coming from the other side of that door, like somebody was fighting.
Dean stopped and tried to spot the owner of the voice.
Becky looked away.
“Oh.” A wide smile grew on Metatron’s face. “I think I found your kryptonite.”
shifting around him.
“But then… then you said all those things and I—”
He had a dreamless sleep fortunately. Or unfortunately. He couldn’t decide of he wanted to see Dean in a dream again or not. As comforting as it would have been, waking up to find out it wasn’t real would have hurt. Just the thought of it made him feel a thousand pains.
Bobby turned back to the table. He pulled out a chair and sat down, watching the broken angel who fixed his gaze on his hands.
“An unlikely ally gave me” Castiel answered.
Castiel sighed and looked at the warehouse he was standing in front of. Previously that day he had called Dean.
But first I have to do something with Gavin’s body. Poor kid deserves something better than laying headless in an old cabin, slowly decaying. I think a hunter’s burial would be perfect. Simple and quick. So as soon as I enter the cabin I make my way to the couch.
Kevin soon stepped away.
The change came in an instance.
“Release me, Hannah!” Castiel shouted with desperation. The struggling made him weaker and soon Hannah found herself holding the angel’s whole weight. But his voice didn’t waver. “I’ll kill that bastard!”
“I don’t remember that timeline just like the one you three came from” Hannah added. “And neither our other siblings do.”
“Yes. Yes, I’m okay. Just a thought, that’s all.”
Castiel smiled and on his way out the car he patted Dean’s shoulder.
“This is all I could do for now” he said with a tried voice. “I must keep some of my energy to heal Sam and myself.”
Dean blinked. Then blinked again. As the warmth spread through his body, everything changed around him. Instead of the solid wall, he felt a soft pillow under his head. Instead of a cabin room, he saw his own in the bunker. And instead of a high Cas standing in front of him, the real Cas was above him, knees next to his hips, hands pinning him down in the bed.
“Yes, I did. And I still do.”
“What do you want, angel?” he asked. “There’s nothing for you here.”
“I’m so sorry, Cas…”
“Dean?” Cas asked all of a sudden.
Before Sam could say anything Hannah put her fingers on his forehead. The world darkened before his eyes and he drifted into a peaceful and safe oblivion. He had the best sleep of his life.
Sam took an uncomfortable breath.
followers?”
Sam had nothing to say. They really should have visited the psychic a long time ago. But Sam knew well that Dean hadn’t wanted to go back to Lawrence ever. The memory of losing their mother and the fire had still affected Dean, and Sam respected his brother’s silent plea when they had left the town.
you must know him better.”
Next time two characters will be added to the list :)
“You have very unusual allies” she commented, disapproval easily detectable in her voice.
No matter how many times she asked, Castiel just shook his head and walked forward without stopping. Hannah could see every step was a torture for him so she stayed close to him to catch her brother the moment his legs give up. But somehow Castiel kept going, like he had a hidden source of power. Maybe it wasn’t his Grace but something unknown to angels.
“Come in!” Sam stepped out of the way and after closing the door behind them he quickly stepped to Cas’ other side to help carrying him. He knew the other angel didn’t need his aid, but he wanted Cas to feel he was there to support him.
The only thing I can do is to stand up, walk to the cabinet and pull out a bottle of whiskey and the glasses.
“Can you just… shut up for ten minutes or more? Or can you just leave me alone?”
“Welcome to the bunker, Ms. Tran” Sam said with a smile as he turned the key in the lock and opened the door.
Sam’s face darkens.
“Kevin? After what?”
“So” he said when he finally stopped laughing. “I can’t annoy you with references anymore because you understand everything?”
“Are you sure?” Sam asked once they were standing outside the dungeon.
Sam’s smile was quickly back on his face too. He was about to say something when out of nowhere a woman appeared in the library. Both he and Hannah looked at the confused lady who looked around then fixed her eyes on them.
At the center of the chamber stood a throne on a tall pulpit. Just like the shapes on the wall, the decoration was moving around too. At the foot of the platform flowers were growing, blooming, dying, then a new started to grow again from the ashes of the previous one, all happening in mere seconds. It was fascinating but what drew away Sam’s attention was the figure sitting on the stone throne.
Kevin’s eyes rounded. He sat up with his mother’s hand still on his head and just stared at the woman with disbelief.
They worked in silence. Dean glanced at the former angel a few times, looking for some kind of answer in his expression. But as always, Cas’ face lacked any emotions like every time he hid something. Dean could figure out that the memories of that sibling were painful. But as curious he was, he couldn’t ask. Hurting Cas more? No way. He could only wonder who that sibling was. The one who followed Lucifer or one of the two he knew nothing about?
He held Cas’ gaze for a while, willing him to understand how much his words to him meant to Dean. How it impacted him and shaken him to the core of his very being. Because while his whole life was orchestrated by Chuck and his sadistic plans, Cas and the bond he had with Dean was the only real thing in all of that.
“Why would you help me? I took away your angel. You are his happiness and I took him away from you.”
They packed their things in the car. Sam turned to Jody before he sat behind the wheel of the Impala, saying a quick goodbye, but the woman’s stern gaze stopped him.
“What?” Lee looked from the hunter to the angel then back. “What Cage?”
Castiel went to the door and opened it.
” an other voice was heard, a very deep one that somehow sounded familiar to Ed.
Still, he started thinking about other options. Maybe if Sam and Dean returned to the diner and didn’t see him, they would look for him. His phone was still in his pocket, battery charged, sound turned off. They would find him by it. But what if that would be too late?
Give it some time
“And you will look out for him here or I’ll find a way to break you.”
Packing the books on the shelves one by one felt relaxing. Movements were methodical, he didn’t have to focus much on what he was doing. His mind could wander miles and light-years away while his body was still present in the now.
Just a miracle could help him now. A miracle she couldn’t make.
Castiel saw his vision blurring as he kept looking into the black eyes, unable to look away.
Cas’ eyes widened in horror.
Kevin was right. There were not only good things in travelling back in time. They had to do a lot of things again, like kicking those bastards once more.
Poor Lee didn’t take it well. He immediately wanted to call Krissy after he found out his daughter was elsewhere. Bobby talked with him for hours, convincing him that he shouldn’t do that. In the end Lee locked himself in one of the rooms – which in the other timeline was probably his – and was just rarely seen.
Sam wanted to slap some sense into his brother.
Un-beta'd.
“Seriously? Non-gender specific pronouns? Come on!”
“Is Gadreel…” he started but Sam answered before he could finish.
She started feeling like a human…
This thought sobered him. He should focus on the task ahead. Finding friendly monsters. Saving them from demons and angels.
“You have too many irons in that fire, don’t you think, Clarence?”
. But Theo was an angel. He can still be dangerous.”
The next few seconds lasted for a lifetime until finally Dean’s eyelids parted and Castiel could see…
The other’s forehead was
Sam sighed and rubbed the back of his neck.
Sam woke many times during his sleep. He had dreams. Countless dreams he couldn’t remember. Maybe they were nightmares because he could swear he heard screaming at one point. It was around noon when he finally decided to get out of bed. He took a quick shower, got some food from the kitchen and made his way towards the library.
On the bright side he was finally making progress with the tablet. He translated half of the next line and Gadreel was doing good too. The thought that maybe next week or the one after that they would read the final English version made him optimistic and he was eager to continue. And that Gadreel guy wasn’t that bad. He was an angel and every angel had that awkwardness but he was friendly and didn’t want to kill him. Always a plus.
“That’s a figure of speech” the former angel explained. “It means Dean will be very angry.”
“My top priority is to see you to Father Time in safety.”
“You serious?” She gaped for a moment. “But... Pagans use blood. Are you pagans?”
“That’s good, isn’t it?” I ask. “Bobby’s alive.”
“From who?”
Sam sighs and I see his shoulders relaxing. But then Death puts his cane under his arm and pulls off his ring, offering it to Sam.
“If we can’t rely on our strength we have to be clever. Using tricks and traps is our only option.”
Sam sighed.
“You knew this would happen and you came anyway? Are you out of your mind?”
Sam opened his eyes. He was back in his room and according to the clock next to his bed he spent just a few minutes laying there. The man sat up and rubbed his eyes.
Sonny led them to the living room. The three of them sat down on the sofa and the older man turned to a woman. She looked up at them from cleaning a table.
“Of course you won’t. You’re still depending on me, Dean. You’re my little angry dog. And you’ll always be. You will always come back and sit on my lap waiting for my orders. Or you were hoping to sit on someone else’s? On a former angel’s lap maybe?”
Dean nodded with a smile and Cas just stared at him. Sam bit back a smile then leaned on his elbows.
Maybe he was on a break, he thought. It was lunchtime after all. Or his shift hadn’t started yet. Maybe he was somewhere back in the storeroom sitting on his sleeping bag aaaand he didn’t want to remember that. It was his fault after all. He was the one who had sent him away.
“Why are you playing here, Timmy?” he asked. “Aren’t you scared? Jack died here.”
Again, Kevin could just blink because wow. That sounded awesome.
chest and he let himself be
“You know something!” I hit the table with my palms, almost breaking the furniture, but it didn’t faze him. “I’m a demon, aren’t I? Then why is this keep happening?!”
“Like when Balthazar unsunk the Titanic?” Sam asked.
The bunker.
- After me the show is (supposedly) making referances to games (http://yana125.tumblr.com/post/110729354428/half-life-3-confirmed-okay-unfortunately-not). Though which game I've been referancing from the begining, I won't tell.
And I’m reaching out towards it.
Dean stopped and looked at Castiel with widened eyes. Castiel stopped too. A few meters separated them, a greater distance than they were used to.
Dean rubbed the bridge of his nose and opened his eyes to have a look at his surroundings. He seemed to be in a nurse office and he was laying on one of the beds. There was a needle in his left hand. The line from it was leading up to an IV bag that was hanged on a pole. To his right a white curtain was drawn, blocking the view to that side of the room. The voice was coming from behind it. It was a girl. Mainly she spoke but he could hear that others were there too, trying to ask questions but the girl didn’t let them speak.
Charlie knew the feeling, her words came from her heart. Her never ending optimism never cased to amaze her. Even though she still blamed herself for her parents’ death, she only looked forward.
What could I do? Leave poor kid in that vault? Let Mammon’s goons kill him? No. I took him with me, out of harm’s way.
when the world started
Just like Sam. He keeps talking and talking about how he’s going to cure me and how good it will be and how happy we will be…
Sam paced up and down next to the Impala. They arrived fifteen minutes ago. They had found the entrance of the cave easily, it wasn’t even hidden. The question was: Was Father Time really here? Sam wanted to go inside and check but he feared once he went inside he couldn’t come out.
Sam gripped Castiel’s elbow and pulled him away.
“Yeah, pumpkin” Bobby nodded. Maybe he understood every sound.
“No. It was James. James Winchester. He was a great man. He helped my family when I was bitten at a young age. Thanks to him I can hold back the beast in me.”
Dean shifted in his seat.
Charlie nodded quickly.
“The only thing I need now is…” he started finally but the voices from the corridor interrupted him. He heard scared screams and angry yells and someone was shouting not far away.
He froze.
“I’m sorry…” he mumbled as he looked away.
Maritza shared a confused look with Larry then turned back to Dean.
I’m touched by Cas’ words.
She grabbed Tammy’s wrist, turned it so her palm was up, took a knife from her jacket and cut a long wound on the hand. Tammy was too shocked to scream and just realized what was going on when Charlie already wiped off the blood with a cloth.
“I… accept your offer” Castiel continued but quickly added. “But not here in front of everyone. And you let her live.”
But he couldn’t recall hir name… Not even the gender ze had indentified with like almost all of their siblings.
The color runs out of my face, my eyes widen. Crowley smirks, but it quickly turns into an angry frown.
and the scared look on their
“Let’s give them some privacy.”
And everywhere the two of them went, they dragged Castiel along with them.
“Impatient as ever. A true Winchester trait.” Then he turned to Hannah. “I’m warning you now, lady. They’d have a bad influence on you if you’re not careful enough. You may also get yourself killed, probably in the near future. Regarding what happened to the majority of their female companions.”
“Can’t you Winchesters just sit down and think before you jump into the unknown!?” Bobby continues shouting. “How could you sell yourself to something made by Lucifer himself!? Didn’t you learn your lesson last time when you sold your soul!? And don’t you dare telling me that you had no other choice because I’ll kick your sorry ass back to Hell! There’s always an other choice, you brat! Why do you always have to sacrifice yourself, Dean!? Last time Cas saved you but what if there’s no way out of this!? Idjit!”
“How is she?” Cas asked, pacing at the end of the stairs until he saw Dean coming out.
But to her surprise Metatron didn’t explain her
“What? Why?”
Then Hannah let her Grace invade the other angel’s mind.
Dorothy nodded. Charlie wasn’t far from the truth.
Agnes was ten when she died. The school bus got into an accident on its way a few mornings ago. A truck ran into it after the driver fell asleep and didn’t stop at the red light. The bus was filled with children. Four were still alive today. Her daughter was not one of them.
And where everything would end.
A successful case always made him feel happier, knowing that they saved innocent lives. That… was rare nowadays. There was always something going wrong and even if everyone survived there was that bad taste in his mouth because something was not right again between him and Dean and it poisoned the happiness.
Dorothy sighed and looked around. Bonnie was scolding a woman at the table with her back to Dorothy. She decided it wouldn’t be wise to talk to her right now so she turned around and started talking to the first person she saw.
because it burnt his veins and
” he heard Cas’ voice. “
Hannah closed her eyes and exhaled a long breath. Yes. He had wanted to intentionally hurt himself.
Just Dean.
Then Castiel would have to tell him that Dean had somehow taken that stolen Grace.
“Believe it or not, no.” Dean took his bag too and started walking towards Sam. “I can eat chocolate.”
“Castiel. Hannah.”
“Does… Does Father Time exist?” Sam asks then adds: “I’m not asking for his whereabouts. I just… I can’t trust Crowley. He manipulated us so many times in the past. It’s because of him that Dean…” Sam pauses to take a breath. “Please, tell me. Does he even exist?”
“You just act like every eldest sibling.” Cas pulled away and dropped his gaze. “If only it was true for eldest siblings.”
Did that mean… he wasn’t
“And that means you have to die?! The fuck’s with you, Cas?!”
Castiel took the paper a little confused then took a look at it. Swirls and lines of many colors decorated the paper. There seemed to be no plan or thought put into it, nor anything recognizable in the drawing. Lucy just went with the flow, leaving her mark everywhere she could. It was… inspirational. No matter what one did, it would leave something behind, little or big. And in this case the result was a beautiful artwork. And the girl gave it to him.
“And you’re a hunter.”
survival. Everything he did
“In a minute or two, yes.” Lee sighed and shook his head. “I have a feeling you’re running out of time. At first how was it? One person a week? Now look at this. That ripple is getting closer.”
“Is it so unbelievable that I help you hunters?” she asked with one raised brow. She folded her arms, looking up at Sam challengingly. “The Leviathans are Hell’s problem too. They could swallow a Knight of Hell without breaking a sweat. I don’t know what you think, but in my opinion it’s a good reason to work together.”
Tammy’s eyes widened. She looked from the serious Dorothy to the grinning Charlie.
“I’m looking for my family” Hannah answered. “Something… unexpected and horrible had happened to our home and now my siblings are scattered around the globe. I want to find a solution to our situation.”
Castiel had squeezed her hand and when he stood outside with Sam and Hannah at his sides he looked back inside the bunker, searching for Meg’s eyes. He wanted to believe her. He wanted to believe that Dean was not lost yet, that there was still hope to save him.
Dean smiled at the ground, putting his hands on his hips.
“Evening?” Thomas glanced at his watch. “It’s barely past noon.”
“Now we have to find the center of it” Cas agreed.
” Cas was in his usual protective mode, regarding everything and everyone that approached the brothers as a potential threat.
“Yes, I know it from Sam’s memories. And it just adds to my concern.” The angel turned back to the building. “Our plan needs to be changed. Sam can’t cross the warding with me.”
“Hello, Cas.”
“Then who…?”
The one who gave me back my life will take it away. We come to a full circle.
The older Winchester turned around and when he saw the two a wide grin appeared on his face. His eyes were two dark pits of emptiness.
And he stopped breathing for a moment.
(See the end of the chapter for
I look up again and I see Crowley’s reflection. He’s leaning on his elbows, watching me with expectation.
Castiel frowned.
Sam froze and from him he looked at Hannah then back. Not getting an immediate answer made Dean impatient.
“Shut up!” Cas’ finger shakes on the trigger.
Garth gaped for a while until he could finally say ‘balls’, then he leaped forward and hugged Dean. Dean patted the guy’s back.
. For the first time I don’t want what the Mark wants. It can go to hell, seriously. It annoys me.
Hannah frowned.
“What did you find?” Sam cut in before the King of Hell could continue this nonsense.
A smile appeared on his face.
“It will be over soon” the
Hannah pressed her lips together, barely holding back an angry yell.
There was a pause.
Dean shook his head.
“It’s a test” Death interrupts him. “Take the ring and open the Cage. Let Lucifer out and let the world burn. Save your brother if you can. Or don’t open the Cage.”
“Of course I’m coming” she said and as soon as those words left her lips Sam let out a heavy sigh. And Hannah’s tiny little new soul sighed in relief too and warmed her body up.
“You put out an open prayer like that...”
He couldn’t shake off the feeling that he should have prayed to the angels earlier. But so many things had happened, they all needed to rest. But he couldn’t wait longer. Outside everything was in motion. Metatron, Abaddon, Bartholomew, Malachi, and that mysterious figure who used those altered Enochian symbols. They had to make their move too. Quickly. Before it was too late and they couldn’t do anything to stop the storm approaching.
“Be careful with that. You’ll cut yourself.”
“Not enough.” Of course not. “If this Father Time exists and he can send you back in time you take me with you.”
The self-restraint was short-lived. The blade was again in Cas’ hand and he was about to attack the demon when Sam and Hannah stopped him in the last moment. The hunter and the angel grabbed the other angel on both sides who struggled to free himself from their hands.
It hit something painful inside Dean. Something related to his own big brother instincts and the many occasions he had failed to protect Sam. He could relate to what Maritza felt.
I wasn’t thinking about a place, I just wanted to get away from the demon and that’s how I find myself in a forest. I land on my knees and I take a few deep and loud breaths until my body calms down. Nothing can kill a Knight of Hell, but if someone can that would be Crowley. And he almost did.
Nicole had sighed.
“She’s a good kid.” Dean ducked his head so he could look the other in the eyes. “She knows she shouldn’t blame you. You saved her after all.”
“Can I help you?” she asked.
Sam put him on speaker then handed the phone to Charlie.
Dean nodded but didn’t say anything. He
Dean rolled his eyes.
I want to do this for you.”
“I told the angel to leave. It was not the right time to give myself to any of them. My life is… changing.”
“You serious about this?” he asked. “Because it’s a…”
When Castiel stepped away, he would have fallen on the floor if not for Sam who caught him just in time.
“I’d like to disagree but I don’t know how it went last time” said Cas as he finally could have a better look at his back. Dean saw Cas moving, maybe he touched his back but didn’t feel a damn thing.
Charlie let out a high pitched squeal. Castiel rubbed his aching ear.
Hannah looked around and when she noticed the sun’s position she turned back to the human, anger waking up inside her.
But here he is, stepping closer to Death who drops his ring in his open palm.
She sighed then looked back at Dean.
“Death, sir?” he said out loud. “I would like to borrow your ring for a while if it’s possible. It’s-uh… important.”
lead. He tried to move them
“That idjit…” Bobby muttered under his mustache and pushed his hat higher. “So? What do we do now?”
’ The angel was silent for a moment. ‘
“You’ll be safe soon.”
But who am I to judge him? I made the same thing just like him. Crowley approached me when I was at my lowest and used it for his advantage. Did he do this in Cas’ case too? How exactly did that alliance begin?
Sam rubbed his forehead for the millionth time in the last ten minutes. He hoped it would stop the painful thought in his head but he should have known better. Once the thought settled in his mind, there was no way it would go away.
And his partner in crime, who had no idea about it yet, entered the kitchen at that moment. Dean tried to hide his smile. In the past few weeks he discovered that Cas was not a morning person. He could he slept in, no matter how early he went to bed. His hair was untamable every morning, and had the grumpiest mood ever. He had a big mug he filled with the strongest coffee possible and sat on the other side of the table.
Hearing his voice, Dean turned to Castiel, calming down immediately. However, the silence didn’t last for long. A drop of water rolled down his forehead, right into his left eye. Dean cried out.
Charlie finished.
“I’m sorry” he apologized quickly. “But this whole situation is so ridiculous. It’s like the worst joke of the universe. I’m sorry if I offended you.”
“To Lawrence” he answered. Why should he lie about that? If everything would go as he had planned, it wouldn’t matter anymore. “I have a few things to do.”
So the angel stood up. Every movement was a torture which just grew in the past days. Being on Earth was bearable but in Heaven the Host wanted to reject him like a human body would reject a transplanted organ. He didn’t show his pain but whenever Hannah was around he could feel the worried looks she was giving him.
I look around on the ground and once I see the key I pick it up. I quickly detach the rings and keep them in separate hands. Better to keep them away from the other. The Devil’s not sleeping.
I take a step back, but I can’t turn away. Crowley locked my gaze with his.
“Hi…” he said shyly and quickly pulled away.
Was that so common? An angel spends time among humans and suddenly has a soul? Did the other angels know about this? She certainly hadn’t heard about it before Metatron told her. She had to ask her siblings if any of them knew about it.
“I’m not okay” he admitted to his feet that bounced up and down and were steadily getting a bluish shade as they were getting cold. Looking Sam in the eyes was more difficult than any time before. His brother didn’t know many things and Dean was too troubled to share anything. He was not ready to talk. Not before he figured out what the hell was going on with him.
He was so useless. He couldn’t help Dean. He couldn’t ease his pain. He couldn’t
fighting against what the
Asmodeus takes a few steps closer to me. Her grin is wide as she watches me with amusement.
The hunter sighed and carefully got up. He made his way back to the ladder but Castiel heard him stopping before he started climbing down.
He loved to see his hands
“You don’t mind if I keep an eye on him, do you?”
“Take care of them, okay?”
“Wha…” she started. “What?”
“But no beer I guess.”
With one last deep breath she made her way towards the view of the human world, breaking her way through the crowd of angels.
“Don’t think so.” Bobby sat down next to him, his knees cracking in the process. “Sulking won’t solve anything.”
I love parallels.
On the picture he saw Dean as a young child and his mother. They both smiled happily at the camera and it clenched Castiel’s heart. He had never seen Dean smile like this. The horrors of the world hadn’t reached that boy on the photo yet and Castiel wished they hadn’t covered his life in darkness. Some would say it was all part of the Plan with that big capital ‘p’ and it was for the greater good. Killing a four years-old boy’s mother was the evilest thing anyone could do. It ruined Dean for a lifetime.
“Because you’re a kid.”
“You think gods want to help us?” Dean asked skeptically.
“Mornin’…”
“We should learn from them” Lee said suddenly. Bobby looked up at him as the man continued. “Good or not, at least they do something.”
“Damn it, Cas! You said it yourself! You kill me, you stop the Apocalypse!”
With a smile on his face, Castiel hugged him with his right hand, leaning his forehead against Dean’s hair, mouth close to his ears.
“You look scared” the woman said with a blank voice and tilted her head. “Why are you so scared, Dean? You know the day of your death is approaching. I can smell it on your soul. You shouldn’t be afraid of it. You have experienced it many times in the past.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I think I found something. Get this…” Sam pushed the book to the center of the desk and all three of them leaned above it.
Sam looked up when he heard his name and his heart skipped a beat. Hannah was approaching him with long steps. Lee was standing next to his car, watching them.
“Oz? Really?” When Sam sent her an apologetic smile she shook her head. “What’s next? You gonna tell me that Doctor Who exists?”
Kevin looked at him like he just sentenced him to death.
Dean opened his mouth to say something but his phone started ringing. Castiel moved away as he answered the phone.
The demon snaps his fingers and I’m not in my room anymore. I stand in the middle of an office surrounded by kitschy furniture. I don’t see any windows, just the flames in the fireplace provide any light. I know I’ve never been in this room before but it still feels familiar. The heavy scent of sulfur stings my nose. Or would sting if I wasn’t immune to it somehow. I know I can smell it, my brain registers it but I still don’t…
“But Dean, what about the…”
Dean pushed himself up to a sitting position and rubbed his eyes with the heels of his palms.
“You too” she muttered into her shoulder. Dorothy squeezed her then stepped away, letting her sit in the Continental when Dean told them it was time to go.
The demon tensed but he was relaxed again in a surprisingly short time. One corner of his mouth curled up as he looked past Sam’s shoulder. The hunter felt a chill running up his spine. Something or more things were approaching him with a lazy pace. He heard something touching the concrete. Something very familiar to
his neck. He screamed
After seeing countless past events, after seeing countless familiar faces, after fighting off countless obstacles along their journey down memory lane, here Dean stood, all alone in the eternal darkness. Sam had held back their attackers, urging him to go on without him.
. But it was too late now. Thinking about those
How to reopen Heaven?
“What is it?” Bobby asked.
Then he noticed it. Dean’s eyes. They were green. And the honest sadness in them…
She was blessed by the Good Witch back in Oz, yes. But magic from Oz only protected against magic from Oz. That was why the Wicked Witch had used Sam and Dean to kill Dorothy. Maybe… Maybe there was something from Oz in this ‘warding’? She had to find out.
So not having any other options, they turned all their attention to research. They had to find an other way before the boys would cease to exist. They hoped that the Men of Letters had a codex or lexicon somewhere about that. They just had to find it.
“No.” Kevin turned to the closest clock. “Six?”
“Yeah, and let’s assume Sariel knows about it” Dean told him. “You come with us.”
To become a human in the end.
“Did Missouri tell you to say this? So I would do what she told me?”
An idea came to her mind.
“You’re not going to kill me?”
I raise my other hand too and cup his face.
“No one asked you, demon!”
“Dean…”
“It was” Sam looked into the man’s eyes with desperation. “He was happy here. Then he left because of me.”
“Castiel prayed to me two hours ago” Hannah informed him. “Said that he and a friend of his were taken by Malachi.”
Timmy nodded but before he could say anything the barn opened and Sam and Cas rushed inside.
“Meg?!” He looked at the demon behind Cas with wide eyes. “What are you doing here?!”
“Where we came from, our time was merging with an other timeline” he started carefully. “In that timeline Dean, Charlie and I died and Bobby was still alive.”
Dean gripped the jacket tighter, nearly tearing the fabric under his fingers.
Dean had steeled himself and threw the jacket into the fire.
Sam quickly pulled his phone out his pocket and called the angel. He didn’t pick up.
“Dude, I’m not a baby” Dean argued, halfheartedly, because he appreciated Sam’s concern. “I’m okay. Let’s get this over with.”
“They shared the same fate. Brothers in arms, you might say. Off you go.”
“Sam is right, Castiel. We still have much to do. We need you at full strength.”
Before the ten seconds pass I’m out off Hell, appearing in a cave entrance high in some rocky mountain. I have no idea how I came up with this place but now that I’m here I don’t really care. The place is far away from any civilization as long as I can tell. The cave is unapproachable from every directions and the area deep under it is a forest with some exotic trees. Maybe I’m in the middle of a jungle.
Shortly after departing from Nicole, Hannah found out how true her words had been.
“Honestly, I don’t know. Both of them were upset after their fight…”
The girl, Lucy, cupped Bobby’s face when she leaned away a little, looked deeply into his eyes and started explaining something on her sealed-lips way. Her face was beyond serious and Sam couldn’t help but smile as he stood up.
That was the moment when Bobby walked in and muttered a shocked ‘
“Just a little more, Cas!” Sam called back to the angel and tightened his grip around the other’s wrist. Cas didn’t have much Grace left. It leaked out from his body as if he was bleeding from a thousand wounds and he barely had the energy to stand. But Sam couldn’t leave him behind and let the last living member of his family die. He would keep him alive no matter what.
“Sorry. Did I wake you?”
“You okay?”
“I stay, Hannah.”
’ he started then added ‘
And Hannah was honestly sorry, he saw that in her eyes. Just like him, Cas and Bobby, she was researching upstairs with some other angels regarding the Father Time question, while the others were looking for the ingredients of the spell. With no luck. It was in everyone’s best interest to repair time before it was too late.
Hannah felt offended by this. She raised her chin and narrowed her eyes.
“I’ll… I’ll tell you later” Sam said and turned his back to them.
“Why did you stab her?!” he yelled. “I came, didn’t I?! Heal her and let her go!”
“You’re stupid, you know that? Stop risking your life, damn it! You’re human again!”
Nicole rolled her eyes.
“No, it’s not true.”
because of them! Because they were a bunch of idiots who ruined Heaven! Who has to suffer in Hell is not me but
Everyone looked like they tried to hide their problems and failed at it. Sam was a combination of a lovesick and a kicked puppy. Cas was acting very human – which to be seen after the books was a great shock – and hid his frustration poorly. Not to mention Dean. He acted too happy to be truly happy.
“Short?”
“So this was the guy who tricked you. And maybe he’s trying to do the same to me too.”
“Fuck you… Do whatever you want…” he muttered and walked away. Sam guessed he didn’t want to run away but it sure as hell looked like that.
“There are.” Benjamin nodded and took a notebook in his hands. “About a million new souls appeared and their numbers are rising rapidly. Some of the angels have wings again and possess no memories of the Fall.”
Dean turned to his left. Little Timmy peeked out a door, looking at him cautiously but with curiosity. Dean’s features softened at the sight of the boy. He crouched down and smiled at him.
Dean sighed and nodded too.
Bonnie’s smile grew and Dorothy thought her lips would rip apart soon.
Daphne turned in her chair to face him properly. She put one hand on the table, the other on the back of her chair and leaned a little closer.
Elisa Connors used to work as a nurse in a hospital. She loved her job. Taking care of people always felt to be her duty from a young age. Helping the old, guiding the young, supporting those in need. Working in a hospital was a dream come true. Of course she returned home exhausted after a long day and she always felt sorry for those who couldn’t be saved. Like that poor boy who had a heart attack due to an electric shock. She didn’t know what happened to him after he left the hospital. He just wanted to go back to his little brother. Sometimes she found herself thinking about them, but why, she didn’t know.
Dean looked at him like he couldn’t decide if he was joking or not. From him Dean looked questioningly to Cas who shrugged.
“Will you go back playing with them?” Castiel asked.
“And?” Sam turned back to them, the dark circles under his eyes were more outstanding on his pale face. “Our problem is the present Dean. What do we do with him?”
The angel nodded.
Castiel felt Dean’s questioning eyes on him but he couldn’t find the courage to look at him.
Dean didn’t pout when he looked at Sam. No. Dean Winchester never pouted. He just glared huffily.
. That was what he had said. They were going
Why can’t Cas understand that not everything bad happened because of him? That me and Sam fucked it up too, so many times I lost count? I’ve thought about giving up, the last time wasn’t long ago, but Cas shouldn’t give up. He has to fight and go on. Because he’s Cas. And I won’t be able to live with the thought that his death was because of me.
It happened.
“We hope you enjoyed the tour. Any questions before we get you girls registered?”
“You broke the connection, Dean.” The angel repeated. Somehow this confession lightened his soul. He was sure now he could face death peacefully. “Thank you for everything, Dean. You may kill me now.”
The two went back to their cars. Dean eyed the Continental, taking a note of every detail that should be fixed in the future. He should take a look at the engines after they get back. He didn’t trust that car without him fixing everything he could.
Dean looked down and rubbed his palms slowly.
“Dean” he called out with a stern voice he forced not to sound too weak or shake. The safety clicked and waited.
Everything will be fine now.
“What is it, Winchester?” he asks mockingly. He brushes down his perfectly made tie like it was moved from its place. “Giving up already?”
Castiel sighed. He had to get out of here. He couldn’t wait for Sam and Dean to arrive. He had to free himself and take Susie out of here as soon as possible.
eat. He didn’t need to do
-“I changed my mind” she said. “I’d like to look for an other mean of transportation.”
“Hannah” he started and squeezed her hand a little. “Anything that happened was not your fault. You’re a greater help than I can ask for. Thank you.”
“Heaven rejected him” the angel said, eyeing the demon suspiciously. “Hannah asked me to bring him back.”
Hannah took a deep breath.
“I’m sorry on his behalf. Emmanuel is still more like an angel than a human. He doesn’t know the things I’ve learnt so far. How to interact with humans and how to deal with emotions.”
But he was weaker than he thought. Just a few minutes in Heaven drained him completely and the next moment he opened his eyes he was back in the bunker again.
The woman waited patiently but maybe seeing how lost he was she asked something else.
“Hey there! Look, he’s up!”
Sam quickly got up and walked up the stairs to answer the door. With a gun ready in his hand, he carefully opened it. And he immediately lowered it when he saw the comers.
“Yeah? Watch me.”
Dean actually jumped. He spun around, looking for the source of the voice, then he found a figure sitting right next to the door with their back to the wall.
Them calling me this hits hard. I know what I am. A demon, a killer, a monster. But angels used to call me something else. That, though I hated much, still felt somewhat right. It gave me hope that maybe I wasn’t a lost cause because why would angels risk their lives for someone not worthy?
Suicide passed her mind many times since Agnes’ death but she couldn’t carry out her plan. There was always somebody with her, looking after her so she wouldn’t do anything stupid. Elisa endured it without a word but now that an angel visited her for some reason she couldn’t help but ask. An angel could grant her wish, right?
Just in time. The ripple entered the chamber. Sam turned around and locked eyes with Dean who still held the unconscious Cas tight to himself then everything faded to black.
Kevin was about to stand up when a human shaped form emerged from the shadows. The teen shrieked in a very unmanly way and fell on the floor along with the chair. That hurt.
Daphne shook her head.
Castiel panted. He threw away the other half of the pen and buried his face into his palm.
“Of course you can” he said. “She’s just afraid you’d get hurt if she’s not with you. But you have to understand. You have to let her go.”
Gadreel nodded thoughtfully.
Sam sighed mentally. He had to agree with Gadreel. Their plan was flushed down the toilet.
The former angel’s features were like stone, unshakeable, but his eyes moved restlessly, examining every part of the man’s face.
Sam made his way closer, stepping over pools of blood and bodies until he finally entered the room.
“Yes…” he breathed out with a higher pitch than usual.
“When Dean came here… Did you notice anything? Anything strange?”
“What should I do?” he asked.
“Until now he was killing demons and monsters but as I heard some angels became his victims too recently. Don’t you think it’s time to put an end to this rampage of his?”
But Dean shook his head.
With a last light brush on his arm the woman left the angel alone at the table.
“Stopping the ripple is not only Heaven’s best interest.” Hannah’s low whisper didn’t promise anything good. “The humans want to do that too. And if that means I have to take every written document down to them, then I will. I and every one of us will work with them to find a way out of it. If you don’t like it, I won’t judge you. But don’t stand in my way.”
From now on there will be chapters from a special poin of view. They won't be long, around 1200-2000 words.
Lucy patted Bobby’s shoulder to draw the man’s attention back to her.
“Once I told Dean this and now I’m telling you too.” Cas’ voice hardened, maybe it reminded him to times when things had been more simple and not that twisted. Times when Dean had been still the Dean they knew and loved. “You did it for the right reason and that’s all that matters.”
And that was when Cas woke him up. He couldn’t finish talking with Tessa, he had a fight with Sam, and they wasted all of their holy oil to now take those angels back to the bunker because the shared enemy made them allies. Just fucking great.
, he couldn’t. It was like his teeth were glued together, he couldn’t open his mouth. His mind was a blank canvas as he stared into nothing then his eyes travelled down to his hands.
“I’m so sorry…” she whispered.
The former angel bit his lower lip. He didn’t want to talk about this without any of the Winchesters. It was their story to tell, not his. Both brothers had their own part in the prophet’s death.
“Good.”
They jumped away from each other. The scene of the other Dean and the other Sam froze like a paused movie and in the middle of the barn stood Meg. It took only a moment for Dean to realize it was not the real Meg. She’d been a bitch for sure, but not even she could make a maniac face like that.
Sam wanted to stay like this longer, enjoying the closeness of the other but the rumble in the background reminded him that they had other things to do first. But then… He would see.
Sam pulled a hand down his face and took a deep breath. He didn’t open the book that afternoon.
Annie flexed her jaw and didn’t say anything so Jody continued.
The once again former angel took his cell into his hand too. He still didn’t decide what he should do. He didn’t want to call Dean. He was still uncertain about him. And he feared nothing had changed. For a while it would be better to stay in oblivion, as cowardly as it sounded. Should he call Sam instead? No. Informing him about Dean would be his first thing to do. He was in this alone. Tomorrow when he wakes up, he would go to that school and wait for Ephraim.
The door of the corridor closed with a loud bang behind her.
I watch the kid as he falls into a dreamless slumber then rub the bridge of my nose. Do I still idealize my father because he died for me? Does it erase all the bad he did?
“And I noticed how you look at her and how she looks at you.” Becky sighed and shook her head. “The Winchesters and their angels with blue eyes. So many parallels.”
“Okay guys.” He stood up and stretched his arms. “Let’s rest now. It was a long few days. We need to sleep before we do anything useful.”
Sam quickly took Cas out of the dungeon. When he was sure the demon wouldn’t hear them he turned to the angel.
“Uh-yeah… In an accident…”
Kevin frowned. So… The same had happened to the Liddells like to the Winchesters? A demon visited a six months old baby then burnt down the house? What was that demon called? Azazel? Had he given demon blood to Alice’s sister too like to Sam? The report says Elisabeth had died in the fire, but Alice said the woman had been her sister. Woman. That doesn’t sound correct. If Elisabeth had survived, she should had been twelve. That was far from being a woman.
“I honestly have no idea.”
Sam dismissed the demon who left him alone with his thoughts.
?” the younger Winchester asked with disbelief. “
“I want to heal your vessel” she explained. “You have to stay alive. We didn’t find Father Time yet.”
“You needed to rest.”
Meg gently bumped her fist against Castiel’s shoulder and jumped off the bed.
“Dangerous?” Robin pulled her hand out of his grip. “It’s just a barn, Dean! If you’re so afraid to tell me the truth then just say that!”
He crossed the state line when he decided it was time to stop for a while. He parked the Impala and glanced around. It was a rest area in the middle of grassy fields reaching beyond the horizon. Dean thought about the diners he had been to longingly as he ate an apple. A month without pie or burgers… It was a torture. But if he didn’t want to faint again he had to take a better care of himself. He had to admit he hadn’t had the healthiest life so far. Hunting meant stress and running and sleep deprivation but he should have compensated it somehow like eating healthy or find time to relax. Like Sam did. With rabbit food and morning jogs he balanced out the bad. And what Dean did? Drank himself to oblivion, ate junk food, avoided physical activities if he could. It was a wonder he hadn’t gain a few pounds yet. Or got a heart attack.
