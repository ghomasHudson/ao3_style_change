Since childhood, he’s been a poor sleeper. It's in the blood, Mummy said. Sherlock could set his watch by Mycroft's insomnia. After years of sharing a room, he has learned to filter out the sounds of him waking, but on the night of the memory, the creak of the door causes his eyes to open. Not wanting to give himself away, he lies still and watchful in his bed. Light shines in from the hall and in the smudges of darkness he detects the outline of their father, leading Mycroft by the shoulders, as if he’s caught his brother sleepwalking. As the sound of Father’s footsteps fades in a slow decrescendo, Sherlock hears the original source of the echo: Mycroft, crying.
"I have an in. Just leave it to me." Sherlock answered looking smug. John attempted to get him to elaborate on the drive but hadn't gotten anywhere. Instead, John had attempted to turn the conversation to Greg.
"I-I was just thinking." She stammered as her cheeks flushed with embarrassment at being caught daydreaming. Greg must think that she was a fool.
John moved closer, his earlier caution now forgotten. He pulled back the man’s eyelid and Sherlock’s unique eye color greeted him; a mix of blue green and grey.
"Oi, Mr. 'omles, 'oes the bloke in your flat?" The boy asked in a thick cockney accent, which was characteristic of south London.
"Something's veiling them." Mycroft said in a worried voice. If he and Anthea couldn't see through it, then whatever it was very powerful. "Sherlock, show yourself!" Mycroft ordered.
"Sherlock, how did he know about…" She trailed off hoping that Sherlock would explain further without needed to put the question bluntly in front of the doctor.
No, it hadn’t always been like this. Their kind had been revered. Alpha and Omega bonds had been encouraged and most of the aristocracy had Alpha and Omegas within their bloodlines. Sherlock recalled his mother fondly describe the courting rituals between Alphas and Omegas from introduction to bonding.
She was the only one who knew the whole story. Sherlock had been so traumatized that he had sublimated the memories and replaced them with something else. Redbeard. Their sister, Eurus, had been his greatest failure. She had been different from the start, smarter than both himself and Sherlock. If it had only been her intelligence that had set her apart, things may have been different, but it had been much more than that. She was a powerful pyrokinetic. She never learned to shield properly. She had nearly killed the entire family when Musgrave was burned to the ground after she had been overcome by a fit of rage. That, at least, had been an accident. She wasn't the same after that. The guilt caused her to go mad. She retreated deep into her own mind becoming even more powerful. Her thoughts grew dark and vindictive. When Sherlock made a friend, a boy named Victor Trevor, she became furious. Overcome with jealousy, she had downed the boy.
Surrounded by miscellany and red thread, he lays his memories side by side. He can’t help but be repulsed by the disorder of his little magpie nest, but the longer he spends there, the more things begin to converge. New angles appear in old snapshots. Shadows begin to take form. Sounds and smells and sensations that he thought he had forgotten echo back at you anew.
John's eyes narrowed in suspicion. Mycroft was up to something. John was sure that he was hiding something, but had no idea what that might be. He was always bollocks at deduction at everything besides medical diagnosis and military strategy, which were both skills that he had honed through years of training and clinical experience. John debated whether to call Mycroft on his bullshit and decided to let it go. If there was one thing that John had learn from living with Sherlock, it was that Mycroft Holmes never gave up information without getting something in return and John had nothing to barter with. So he got to the point, hoping to cut the conversation short and go back to Baker's Street where he still had his gun safely hidden.
"Yes, I knew that. I should have confiscated both of them." Mycroft recalled. "But all of my wards were pulsing strongly warning me not to test him. I couldn't take the chance." Mycroft reluctantly admitted.
John ran through the drills easily. Sholto shot him wary looks throughout the entire exercise, particularly during the target practice. John couldn't understand why. One thing was for sure, however. The rumor was at least partially true. James Sholto was horribly scarred. The entire side of his face was disfigured by burns. They could not take away from the intelligence and determination in his blue eyes. John wished, not for the first time, that he had Sherlock's gift of deduction, so that he could get an idea of what the man was thinking. The thought of his friend caused John to pause for a moment as his chest tightened. He quickly recovered and proceeded with the drills. "Watson!" John broke formation and approached as ordered with confidence despite the sideways glances that he had been given by both his commanding officer as well as his fellow soldiers. His performance had been flawless. He didn't know why he was being singled out but there was no basis for a reprimand and John wasn't about to be scolded for nothing.
Henry Knight sat in front of them telling his story. Sherlock couldn't stop interrupting trying to hurry him along. "What killed your father?" Sherlock asked bluntly.
"Sir, bad news. John's unit was ambushed and there were no survivors retrieved. Those that were not immediately killed were taken as POW's and we have been unable to locate them." Anthea said. "I'm sorry." Her voice shook with emotion. She knew how serious this was.
He stepped out of the shadows revealing himself, his thick Irish brogue breaking the silence. "Irene said you might call. Is that a British army Browning L91A in your pocket, or are you just pleased to see me?" Moriarty goaded. The great detective approached him as he scanned the scene taking in John Watson who had a red dot of a sniper scope aimed at him.
"Meet me at the barracks at 2100." Sholto ordered in sotto voce. "Dismissed." John nodded sharply and moved back to join his troop a bit confused and on edge. He would evidently be learning more in regards to the officer's opinion later tonight, but for now John needed to focus on the task at hand and returned to the drills mindful that of his every move as he was mercilessly scrutinized.
"Wouldn't kill you to take one for the team for once. I know Mycroft can be a condescending ass, but he is not as you seem to believe the embodiment of evil." Greg insisted with a wink allowing a teasing note to enter his tone. Sherlock only scoffed in reply. John watched the two of them banter feeling relieved that whatever wedge had been driven between them now appeared to be forgotten. The sound of a siren broke the banter and the panda car came to a halt and a woman stepped out.
"Couldn't risk it." Greg replied. John had to agree with him. Physically touching a sex demon was ill advised even to those with powerful wards.
The ritual that Greg would try was very much an unknown. There was a good possibility that rather than strengthen John's grace as intended, it could either kill John, or worse yet, fail completely leaving Greg's soul opened to the darkness. Greg frowned as he considered the options. There was still a chance, albeit a slim one. Greg had promised Sherlock. John deserved a chance. He turned to Mycroft, Sherlock, and Anthea. If they were going to do this, they needed to be on the same page. "I need your word. If his wings turn black or disappear completely, it means that all of his grace, which is the angelic equivalent of a soul, has fled meaning that the ritual has failed. If that happens, then John must be killed and his body buried on hallowed ground. I am giving a up part of myself, my light, my soul, in order to do this and it will leave me vulnerable to the darkness, if these steps are not followed." Greg warned gravely.
Greg lit a cigarette and took a deep inhale and releasing a plume of smoke before adding in a contemplative tone. "Now that I think about it that soul eater that I banished kept talking about a vampire. He wouldn't say his name. Just kept referring to him as 'the spider' and the succubus, she referred to someone named Jim Moriarty. It makes me wonder if they are one and the same." Sherlock's eyes closed for a moment as he digested the information.
Rather than admit defeat, the vampire had redoubled his efforts and this was how Irene had found herself running from the hunter and the priest. Irene's thoughts moved briefly to the unassuming man named John Watson. There was something off about him. He hadn't been affected by her spell of seduction in the slightest. She paused a moment to regroup. She should never have agreed to help the vampire, but the notion of feeding off of Sherlock Holmes had been too much to resist. The decision had proven to be her down fall. Now she was running for her life and hadn't feed in days. She was pulled from her thoughts by the hunter's smooth baritone voice. "You should never let your heart rule your head." She looked up in shock to see Holmes, Watson, and Lestrade standing in front of her. How had they found her so quickly? She was trapped. She needed to bide time.
Greg took a deep inhale on the cigarette in an attempt to calm his shattered nerves. He still couldn't believe that he had gone through with it. The ritual had been a last ditch effort and it hadn't worked as anticipated. Greg may have unknowingly made things worse. The darkness in John remained and was fighting against the light. It was dangerous to allow John to live, yet Greg had seen the light in him and couldn't bring himself to lose hope. Greg was pulled from his thoughts by the sound of Anthea clearing her throat pointedly with questioning look in his direction. Greg merely raised an eyebrow in response. He was determined to give Sherlock and John a fighting chance and if Anthea had her way John would have been staked before the ritual had even begun.
She slowly began to stir with a groan. "Greg, watch her. I don't want her attacking John. I need to explore a few options." Sherlock insisted as he picked up his mobile and dialed. "Molly, I need a favor. Can we meet you at Bart's?"
"Mr. Holmes is not currently available. I am sorry that I cannot be of further assistance." She replied coolly. Harry seethed and snapped.
"We're hunters. Lestrade is one of the few remaining knights of the honor guard and I'm Sherlock Holmes and I've been hunting for nearly my whole life. We are very good, but we are always on the look out for those willing to help; those that choose the light over the darkness." Sherlock replied finally answering her question.
Mycroft sighed and gripped the handle of his umbrella tracing his thumb over the fine wooden grain. Mary Moristan. The alias for the AGRA agent was still a hard target, but not nearly as difficult as Moran. She just may be the lead to chase which could lead him to John and by extension, Sherlock. He couldn't quite suppress the quirk of his lip as he found what he sought. It was time for more legwork.
"Aye, I never had much of a filter, I've been in the brig more times than I can count; but make no mistake, I've got the skills to back up my mouth. How about you, old man?" John couldn't hold back a laugh at the man's teasing.
There had been more to the conversation than that, but Sherlock was not about to go into all of it with John. The Succubus, the same one that had enchanted the weeping statue, was now targeting priests. Lestrade had been furious when Sherlock had approached him about it.
"I owe you one, crack shot." Small murmured as they passed each other and Small was given his rifle as John attempted to fade into the background. The hunter now became the hunted. John's eyes his focused on his target; the mock barracks. His goal was to make it by the sniper without a hit.
“Then why would… are you saying that this is something you did a long time ago?” Silence greeted him. “Right, you won’t say. You’re sure it’s not just because you’re afraid I won’t agree with what you did?” Greg didn’t even realize that he was baiting him.
"I can't tell you the how's and why's of it, but it has happened. Don't shoot the messenger. Do you want the number?" Greg replied not about to listen to a lecture from an absentee family member. Where the hell had she been when John was suffering after Sherlock's death?
"I suggested you listen to him, witch or you will end up much worse off than your lover." John claimed in a voice that was cold and detached. It lack any form of emotion and was without inflection. Sherlock could not repress the chill that ran down his spine as he looked at John's flat affect. "Sleep!" He commanded and Anthea dropped unconscious to the ground besides Mycroft. Sherlock looked down at the three of them. Mycroft, Lestrade and Anthea all unconscious on the floor, and completely helpless. John moved towards Lestrade stooping over his supine form. He sniffed the crook of his neck and sighed as his fangs elongated. "Hungry." He whispered. Sherlock felt his heart race as panic overtook him. No! He had to stop it.
"Gregory Lestrade, contrary to what he may claim, has true faith. He was horribly traumatized by his mother's death, but rather than destroy him, it only made him stronger. He is the light. It is so rare to find that these days. I cannot find fault with him. He is his own worst enemy, his greatest critic is himself." Mycroft explained.
"It's too late Sherlock. He's turning. We simply cannot allow this to happen. Can you imagine what he will rise as? Something more than a mere vampire, something dark and very powerful, of that, I am certain. He's already gone. But that's the deceased for you, late in every sense of the word." Mycroft quipped.
Sherlock and John took a cab to Westminster. Sherlock's phone rang and he smirked as Lestrade's name flashed across the display. "Perfect timing." He murmured under his breath. He answered it. "Lestrade, are you safe?" Sherlock asked.
"Mangia! You're too thin a strong gust would blow you over." Angelo claimed pulling one of the rolls from the basket and placing it in Sherlock's hand with an expectant look. Sherlock took a bite to appease him and slipped the remaining uneaten roll into the basket with the others.
"I always here punch me in the face when you're speaking, but it's usually subtext." John said still unsure if Sherlock was joking.
"Take her home." Sherlock said into his mobile. "Don't bother denying it I know you're here with her. Take her home Lestrade. You are both in over your head."
"Isolation during the first round of treatments, over 50% die after the first round. No use exposing him to the general prison population if he dies immediately." The man murmured in Pashto. "I don't understand why Moran has taken such an interest in this one, he's old, injured and the chances of him surviving are slim to none."
“I think you’re taking it for granted. My willingness to overlook things that violate my personal morals for you. It was one thing when it was about keeping Sherlock out of trouble and keeping your secrets but….” Greg trailed off wondering if he had finally gone too far.
"How could you? How could you even suggest…" Sherlock asked in a pained voice. "I expected as much from Mycroft, but not you Greg." Mycroft opened his mouth to reply but Greg beat him to it.
Hungry, John had never felt hunger like this. It was raw, gnawing, and all consuming. John felt an unfamiliar ache in his mouth as his newly formed fangs lengthened and the urge to feed strengthened. John breathed heavily trying to force it down. John opened and shut his eyes quickly and tried to focus. He could feel the darkness within him urging him to attack and gorge on as much blood as he could find, but there was still light within him as well. The enchanted tattoo on his back pulsed allowing John a brief reprieve from the hunger.
The military record was exemplary. Watson began as an RAMC physician serving as a trauma surgeon on the front lines treating battle injuries, after serving in that capacity for several years and saving countless lives, he then volunteered for officer's training at Sandhurst. After completing the rigorous training, he then re-enlisted as a full combatant and was deployed to Afghanistan during the height of operation HERRICK. Watson once again proved himself. He was skilled in battle and a true crack-shot, he rose quickly to the rank of Captain and was awarded the Victorian Cross for his service in Helmand during operation Achilles. His service was cut short, however, due to a near fatal shot to the shoulder during battle leading to a medical discharge. Mary's brow furrowed in confusion as she read on.
They had eventually caught the Kelpie and since then Molly had lost track of the number of cases that she had assisted with. She was pulled from her thoughts by a text alert. Be on the lookout for a succubus. More information to come-SH
It turned out that John Watson was a fighter. He had survived against all odds. The gunshot wound had become infected and John had fallen into a coma after battling septic shock. Miraculously, he had started to rally and slowly improved. The rehab had been hell. A second surgery had been required to try to remove some of the thick scar tissue, which had formed and severely limited his range of motion. Finally after months of treatment he was released on a meager army pension with nowhere to go. John had gone back to London, and rented a small bedsit. He had been applying for jobs, but people were reluctant to hire a surgeon with an intermittent tremor in his dominant hand. He was running low on funds and getting desperate. He nearly called his sister but decided to wait until his funds ran completely out before taking that option.
"Thank you." Sherlock whispered in tight voice. "You need to go back to London, both of you, Mycroft has eyes everywhere." Sherlock then pulled his phone from his pocket and made a call.
"Molly's a skilled necromancer. She can conjure without fully raising the dead. I've witnessed her do it." Sherlock assured causing Molly to flush with embarrassment. Sherlock was right it would be faster and much more effective. She could not only find the cause of death but the facts leading up to it. Greg would never forgive her though. She never quite understood why he was so averse to her conjuring, but he loathed it.
"Obviously, I can straighten up a bit." Sherlock placated. John's expression morphed to one of confusion and then to suspicion as he moved about the flat, picking up a wooden stake and the jar of holy water beside it.
John groaned as he finally regained consciousness. There was a dull throb in his head and he hissed as he attempted to open his eyes only to slam them shut again as the light caused the dull ache to magnify into a relentless stabbing pain. He was most likely concussed. If he was being completely honest, John was surprised that he was still alive. He had fought like the devil as his captors carted him away, fully expecting to be killed for his insolence. However, instead of a fatal shot that he had expected, he had received a blunt blow to the head with the barrel of a rifle, knocking him unconscious. John took a few steadying breaths before trying again. This time he was more cautious as he slowly opened his eyes. It took a few seconds to focus as his vision tunneled for a moment then blurry images slowly sharpened. He was lying on his right side on a hot dirt floor in a holding cell. There was a single bulb dull yellow bulb burning that barely illuminated the surroundings.
"I don't know. They are spread out." The man replied. Bloody hell. She had not come this far only to hit another dead end. She pressed on.
Mycroft then handed Anthea his wand and whispered softly. "Hold the spells," before approaching Lestrade's unconscious form.
"I don't know why you're here, but I suggest you go back to where you came from, Father. There's no savin' him." She continued undeterred by the scathing look Greg pegged her with. "Strange place for a confession, eh?"
In its place, he finds a rather curious fact. No matter how loud he screamed or how many schools he managed to get expelled from, he has no memory of ever having heard Mycroft excuse himself with a migraine. The words are always their father’s. Somewhere along the timeline, the migraines simply disappear, along with Mycroft’s insomnia. Your own sleep patterns never normalize, but Sherlock has picked enough locks to know that Mycroft sleeps through the night, every night.
The sand was everywhere. John coughed into his elbow and squinted. He heard Colonel Sholto over the radio ordering him to report. Before John could answer, the sound of one of his soldiers groaning after another round of gunfire caught his attention, McKay. First tour, only 24 years old. He clutched his chest before falling lifeless to the ground. John felt the rage building. He channeled that anger and let it fuel him without allowing it to control him. They would pay for that. John sighted the enemy, aimed, and pulled the trigger. He shot to kill and felt an almost sick sense of satisfaction as he watched their bodies drop one by one to the ground. John sighed once he heard the tell tale click of an empty magazine. He took comfort in the fact at that at least he had managed to take out 10 enemy soldiers, but it hadn't been enough. It seemed as though nothing he ever did was enough. John froze and dropped to his knees when he felt the metal barrel of a gun dig into his neck with a hard shove. He met the man's gaze coldly. This, it seemed, was it. He was about to meet his end.
Mycroft murmured a spell under his breath allowing his magic to peak. He would need all of his skill to accomplish this. "Sherlock, get out of the way." He ordered. Mycroft could feel the magic building as his wand pulsed; the colors wavering erratically resembling a kaleidoscope. Mycroft took a deep breath and let the magic flow through him. It heated the blood in his veins and buzzed ominously in his ears drowning out everything else, including his brother's protests. Mycroft rarely allowed his natural magic free reign, but this time, he deemed it necessary. He caught a glimpse of Anthea's shocked face, a mix of fear and awe, for not even she had seen him wheeled his full power. Mycroft could feel his brother's magic peaking as well, but it was a pale comparison and was no match for him. Mycroft raised his wand and cast his spell. The magic hit John at full force, but rather than kill him as expected, it ricocheted right back at him, plowing through his wards knocking him unconscious.
"Doesn't look like it." Sally answered still staring at him contemplatively before continuing. "You're not his friend. He doesn't have friends. So who are you?"
"Wait! There may be a chance to save him." Sherlock pleaded with a gesture towards John's back. Mycroft looked down and peered at it with a frown. There was a tattoo. Wings, they were beautiful and so realistic that they seemed to move, shifting and glowing ever so slightly. Mycroft squinted and realized that it wasn't shading and spatial relativity that was causing an optical illusion, but actual movement. What in heaven's name? There, before them lay a fallen angel, a creature so rare that many believed them to be a product of lore. Mycroft was struck speechless. The pieces fell into place. That was why John Watson had set off his wards. The fleeting sense of satisfaction related to having his questions about John answered faded quickly as Mycroft wracked his brain trying to gather every bit of information that he had read on the subject of fallen angels. Too Late, John Watson's light was fading and there was nothing they could do to stop this.
Anthea frowned as she looked down at her phone's display. Someone had sent her a text from an unknown number. Need your help involves Sherlock Holmes. Anthea bit her lip in anger. Dr. Molly Hooper. She was the only one besides Mycroft and herself that knew that Sherlock was still alive. Anthea had urged Mycroft not to involve her. She was too emotionally invested in Sherlock and couldn't be objective, but Mycroft had vetoed her suggestion. Now, it appeared that his decision may come back to haunt him, much like his brother always seemed to. Mycroft's baby brother, the now infamous Sherlock Holmes, was one of Mycroft's few weaknesses. Despite their constant bickering, and constant posturing in a never ending power struggle, there was a genuine, if not love, then minimally, respect and brotherly concern. Over the years, Anthea had attempted to get the whole story of their difficult relationship, but to this day she only knew bits and pieces. Sherlock Holmes was truly an enigma, yet not nearly as mystifying as Mycroft Holmes. Her eyes drifted to slim gold band on her right ring finger.
"You know your brother, darling. He does as he pleases. The harder you push, the more he'll refuse." She then murmured into Mycroft's ear. "He uses magic, just not to its full extent, yet he doesn't even realize it. What he doesn't know won't hurt him, though. Stop fretting. Fay blood runs through both of your veins. It's diluted enough for both of you to pass as completely human, but gives you both a bit natural magic." Anthea reminded him. Mycroft frowned deeply at her obviously upset at her mentioning it. It was a topic, which he had forbidden any discussion of, and for once he and Sherlock had agreed. Though there were rumors amongst the Fay, they were never to be confirmed and as far as everyone was concerned Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes were completely human; Sherlock a hunter and Mycroft a powerful, albeit self-taught mage.
"No…Please…Greg. I can't. Isn't there something, anything, which you could try? If it doesn't work, then Mycroft will do it. You have my word." Sherlock pleaded.
As of sensing his thoughts, Molly spoke in a soft voice. “We choose our own paths. Look at me, my kind are nearly always dark, but I  chose the light. Do you consider me damned as well?” John grit his teeth.
“You’re not fighting alone, and there is power in numbers.” Sherlock promised with a nod from Molly.
“Mike, shut it! It’s his first day. Let him get settled. Lay off the third degree. Sorry, Watson, as you may have noticed he has no filter.” Bill said with a sigh. John was beginning to like him more by the minute.
John slowly tried to raise himself up, his left shoulder ached in protest. He only made it a few inches before he came to an abrupt halt. He could only raise his wrists a few inches off the ground. They were cuffed and chained to metal stakes in the ground.
"You're too hard on yourself." Anthea murmured likely sensing the direction which his thoughts had drifted.
"Giardia, cholerae, salmonella, typhoid, and amebic dysentery, just to name a few." Molly quipped in reply causing Sherlock to laugh and Lestrade to groan.
"No. Cold turkey, we agreed." He insisted with a glare in Sherlock's direction. "Besides no one will sell you any. Have you spoken to Greg about the case?" John asked changing the subject hoping to distract Sherlock from his boredom. Sherlock hissed out a frustrated curse under his breath that John didn't quite catch as he continued looking for his stash.
"I'm getting tired of talking to the skull." He explained. "He didn't scare easily in the morgue, even with the riding crop. I've got a good feeling about this one."
“Sentiment? Really, Sherlock? You’re just breaking everyone of your tenets.”  John felt his anger begin to melt away and in its place came grief. His grace was nearly gone; he was destined for the bowels of Hell. He was worse than Fallen; there was no name for what he had become. Damned, that was what he was.
"Just as I thought, they're enchanted with demonic wards which hide their true meaning. I'm sorry I can't tell you more. Only the demon who made them, or someone skilled in black magic can break the enchantment." John Watson said as he leaned on his cane as he got up.
Mycroft never touches him again after that, not in anger, not in affection. Not even when he is seventeen and vomiting on the floor of St. Bart's casualty departments after his first overdose. Sherlock’s sobbing and sorry and all he wants is for him to reach out and hold your hand in his, but he doesn’t.
He had gotten sloppy. The finish line was within sight. Sherlock had been rushing in order to return to John. There was only one thread left. Sebastian Moran. Sherlock had used every resource available to him. He had called in favors, even going so far as to utilize some of Mycroft's contacts, though he loathed being in his brother's debt, John was worth it. John, Sherlock thought as he let his eyes slip shut. Mycroft had confirmed that he had begun training with SAS. Sherlock's chest tightened at the thought. It was bad enough that John had reenlisted as a full combatant, but SAS was even more dangerous. The likelihood of him being injured or killed was now exponentially higher.
It was then Sherlock's turn to sigh. "I don't know exactly, but there's more to the story than he'll admit. As for the rest of it, it's complicated. Sentiment." Sherlock reluctantly admitted.
After so much denial and wasted time, it was now too late. The pain of seeing Sherlock dead had been worse than being shot. He could never make it right. He would never have the chance to tell Sherlock the truth. The pain had been crippling and John had decided almost immediately that he was ready to join his friend in eternal slumber. Ironically, it had been Mycroft in the end that had saved him. John wondered what Sherlock would have thought of that if he were still alive.
"The darkness, Sherlock. I can sense it and so can you. Otherwise, you would be looking at John with terror in your eyes. John's not the same. He never will be. I tried to warn you…" Molly insisted as she trailed off as Sherlock shook his head in denial. No, Sherlock needed to see the truth. He needed to see the risks. He was nearly exsanguinated a moment ago. "Don't turn a blind eye, it's more than just the hunger, Sherlock. The darkness in him is strong, much stronger than his grace. Its pull is powerful and will be difficult to resist; lust, avarice, envy, gluttony, sloth, pride, and wrath. What's more, we still don't know what he is capable of. What the true extent of his supernatural abilities are, as well as his strengths and weaknesses. Whatever he has become; he is extraordinarily powerful. He broke through your brother's wards. I fear John Watson is fighting a losing battle. He had already fallen before the bite and was trying to earn redemption and with it his place back in heaven…" Sherlock held up a hand to silence her before she could go on.
"Sherlock, did Gregory offer any guarantee of success?" Mycroft asked. Sherlock shook his head unable to meet Mycroft's gaze. Mycroft sighed wearily as he took in his brother's haunted face. He would go along with this, but only on one condition. "I was there for you before and I'll be there for you again, but I need your word that you'll let me end this if things go south." Sherlock nodded numbly. "Let's go." Mycroft said with a glance at Anthea who looked fit to be tied but held her tongue. Mycroft mouthed thank you and she nodded looking as hopeless as Mycroft felt.
"I can't." He answered truthfully catching a glimpse of John who stood off to the side looking wary, but fully in control of himself. Sherlock kept his face neutral, but wondered how John could do it. If Sherlock was honest with himself, he was having trouble resisting her and his control was paramount. It was another piece of the puzzle that didn't fit in regards to John.
"You could have phoned me, on my phone." John snapped not willing to play nice. Whatever this mage wanted, John wasn't about to give it to him.
"No." She confirmed. John wasn't surprised. Of course, she would know to never give your true name to a stranger.
"Sorry about that, mate, but I had to be sure." Greg begrudgingly apologized. The man glared at him as he wiped the water off of his face.
"I tried to tell you that it needs to be fresh from the vein." Molly insisted looking at John warily. "I understand you both wanting to try the bagged blood first, with time and proper weaning vampires can adjust to it. I have to say John, I've never seen this level of control in a newly turned vampire." Molly admitted looking perplexed. John closed his eyes as his stomach twisted painfully, he couldn't wait much longer. Even with Greg's help, his control wasn't endless. The darkness was still within him and with it came the hunger. It would not be ignored any longer. Seemingly sensing his thoughts, Sherlock spoke seriously.
"That man is a miracle worker." Lestrade replied unable to mask his surprise. "Has your brother had a go at him yet? I still remember the first time I met him after working our first case. I've seen some disturbing things, but your brother is something else."
Molly moved like a wraith as she finally approached Sherlock in the market. Her eyes widened in surprise as she took in his haggard appearance. It was the first time that she had seen him since the fall and he was barely recognizable. His hair was dull and limp; his normally lithe frame was now emaciated. Dark circles stood out under his eyes, but the most striking change were the eyes themselves. Gone was the cold calculation and in its place was pain and heartache. John Watson had done what Molly had thought impossible capture Sherlock's heart. Her jaw dropped in shock as she glanced beside Sherlock and staring back at her was Irene Adler.
"How do you know? You can't see it. You can't feel it. The darkness, it's eating me alive! I'd rather be dead than become that! I need to know! What am I?" John's aura shimmered and shifted from white to a muted grey. "I'm bloody starving!" John took a few deep breaths and his aura shifted back to white and his eyes lightened once again to their normal sky blue as his eyes met Greg's desperately. "Greg, please. I know what you've done already and the risks that you've taken to try to help, but you didn't ask. You didn't give me a choice. Now, I stuck like this, in limbo, I need to know. It's my soul and my choice, give me the information I need to make it."
He watched, sickened, as Moriarty taunted Sherlock using John as a pawn before biting him. Rather than draining him dry and leaving him to die, Moriarty had done something much more vicious. He had fed John his blood ensuring that he would rise a fully turned vampire. Sherlock had shot him but it had only slowed the vampire down. Sherlock was lucky to have lived, if the sniper's bullet had moved by an inch, then Sherlock would be dead instead of receiving a flesh wound. Desperate, Sherlock had even resorted to alchemy, but he was unable to stop the vampire. Moriarty had left John's body after transforming and escaping leaving Sherlock helpless and horrified. He would pay for that and Mycroft vowed in that moment that he would track that creature down and kill it slowly.
"My brother. He is an arrogant, interfering, fat git. He is also prone to kidnapping any close acquaintances of mine. Lestrade experienced something similar, I assure you." Sherlock explained. John's jaw dropped in shock.
"Greg, do you know this woman?" Molly asked sounding quite angry herself. Greg shook his head in denial, but before he could get another word out the woman turned on Molly.
Greg took a long drag off of his cigarette holding it for a moment in order to savor the familiar burn feeling his tension lessen before releasing a plume of smoke into the air with a tired sigh. He really should quit. Bad habits had a way of catching up to you. He was getting too old for this. Greg let the comforting weight of the relic around his neck soothe him. It was no ordinary necklace for inside the small pendant was a chip of bone belonging to St. Jude the Apostle, the patron saint of lost causes. It served as one of his most powerful wards, an ordination gift given to him by his long deceased mentor, it had been passed down amongst their order for centuries. His eyes drifted over the blood stained church. Those words were too familiar, eerily familiar. The words on the church's floor haunted him bringing back memories that he would rather forget. How had he gotten here? How had he become a wayward priest? It had been a long journey with many twists and turns that had led him here. He was an unlikely savior, a priest whose faith was tested daily, yet he still remained one of the last of his kind, one of the few trained and able to fight the darkness.
By the time he settles; the cries have faded. He closes his eyes and lets the memory pull him under. Memories from a childhood long forgotten; when Sherlock still had a bit of innocence and naivety.
"Don't be too impressed John. The vampire that she was working with is still at large." Sherlock pointed out although his words lacked their usual condescending tone.
"You're about to find out." She promised before pulling the trigger. Sherlock sucked in a breath as pain exploded. His last coherent thought was of John.
Mycroft sighed in relief. It was a reasonable request, especially considering that it was Sherlock. "Very well, I'll offer you an olive branch. The Succubus that you've been hunting." Sherlock grinned knowing he'd won this round.
The memories then came flooding back. Moriarty, the pool, and the bite. Turning, he was turning. But John was missing something. There shouldn't be any grace left in him, he should have fallen to the darkness completely. John looked up and met Mycroft's steady gaze. He was still holding Greg's bloody rosary. It hurt John's eyes to look at it directly; he could only peer at it for a moment. John caught a glimpse of Greg's still form behind him. What had happened? Everything after the bite was a complete blank. For a moment, John thought the priest to be dead, but when he concentrated he could hear Greg's steady heart beat. "John, do you understand my words?" Mycroft asked for a third time as he held a wand, which pulsed with magic and power ready to strike him down. Let him do it, part of him thought. John would never earn all of his grace back now. He wasn't quite a vampire, yet no longer an angel. He was something else entirely. A strange unnamed creature stuck in limbo between the darkness and the light.
“I know you can’t always talk to me about your work. I don’t expect…. But it’s just the way you act, like if you think something needs to be done, then it’s done. Because you’re the authority and your word is final. You never consider that you might be wrong. And sometimes, Mycroft--like that whole fiasco allowing John to re-enlist--you’re bloody wrong!”
"You could have solved it, Sherlock. You would have tested the blood. It would have just taken you longer. I only saved you some time." John said ignoring Sherlock's question and turning to Greg.
"Don't worry, Bill. Though it's been a few years, I still have my skills as you saw during the drills. I'll be fine, this isn't my first time in combat and it won't be my last." John said with a wink of his own trying to assuage some of Bill's worry. Bill looked at him seriously before answering.
“So that’s it. This was all a ‘venture’ for you, and now you’re cutting your losses.” Greg said unsure of the magnitude of the event to which Mycroft was referring to.
Rudolph scoffed. “Certainly not! You know me better than that. What have your parents told you regarding courtship?” Mycroft couldn’t hold back a laugh.
Greg looked away unwilling to say more. Anthea huffed in frustration. "Tell me." She insisted as her crystals shimmered with magic. Greg's relic pulsed warding him against her magic.
"What about Greg? Not to mention Mycroft and Anthea? What do they think of this?" Molly pressed on. Sherlock mirrored her sigh and replied.
"I would relish the opportunity, Mr. Holmes." She replied with a professional smile and it was true this was a once in a lifetime offer and she was not about to turn it down.
"Should stop once he is back on solids." The other man predicted referring to the diarrhea. "Up!" the man ordered in Pashto and John was hoisted off the stretcher and onto his feet forcing him to stand for the first time since he was placed in the prison. John's knees buckled too weak to hold himself up and he could not hold back a scream as excoriating pain in his hips and pelvis nearly took his breath away. Broken, something must be broken.
"Water," John pleaded in a voice hoarse with disuse and to his shock an ice chip was placed between his lips. John sucked on it greedily and it dissolved almost immediately. The men sat him up which caused a wave of vertigo to overtake him causing him to retch and vomit up a small amount of the enteral feedings, which had been infusing into the NG tube. John couldn't stop the moan that escaped as his stomach gurgled ominously and the foul smell of feces once again permeated the room. Before John could say anything more, the diaper was replaced with a clean one.
"Baskerville? Are you really planning on going? I've heard rumors about that place. Government facilities. Projects are all very hush-hush." John said.
"I understand why his parents abandoned him, but he should be in an orphanage or foster care." John insisted. Sherlock then pegged him with a look that screamed. What are you an idiot?
"Mycroft! Don't kill him! The wings, they're white. It worked." Sherlock pleaded. Mycroft glanced in his direction briefly meeting his stare with a wary look, before turning his attention back to John.
"You of all people should know that just because there was a body, doesn't qualify as airtight evidence." Sherlock snapped. Molly bit her lip knowing that Sherlock was referring to her role in faking his death. His tone then shifted from accusatory to desperate and anguished "Give it to me, Mycroft's report. Don't you see? We're running out of time. Molly, please!" Molly felt her resolve waver in the face of Sherlock's heartfelt plea.
"I upset her? Me? It wasn't me that upset her Mycroft! Try not to start a war before I get home you know what it does to the traffic." The man snapped before turning his back to them and stomping away angrily.
"He could be the making of my brother or make him worse than ever." Mycroft whispered sounding haunted.
"You will?" Henry Knight asked unable to mask his surprise. Sherlock nodded quickly showing the man out.
"Enough, both of you. This has gone on long enough." Not nearly, Irene thought as she scanned the room. Watson. He was the easier target. The bloody priest was good, too good. He was about to take her down. She stared Watson down putting all of her power into a seduction spell, but the man merely looked at her remaining completely unaffected.
He knows why he would not come out from the car at Father’s funeral. He knows why his headaches stopped after Father died and why he was never allowed into the room when Mycroft felt ill. With absolute lucidity, he sees every gesture, every word, every instance that he has ever regarded as evidence for their father’s favoritism. Every excuse for the resentment he’s harbored toward his brother. For the first time, he feels guilt for feeding Mycroft’s hatred of his body, for mocking his weakness, for antagonizing him into striking you and demanding that you never compare him to that man again.
"Nice try, but you won't entice me. If I wanted to look at naked women, then I would borrow John's laptop." Sherlock assured her.
"Bloody Necromancer! Were you trying to raise those babies from the dead? You make me sick. Did you kill them too, or are you just trying to make them do your bidding." A rough voice hissed in her ear. Molly looked up at her assailant and her eyes widened in shock as she took in a handsome man with dark brown eyes and silver hair in a cassock and roman collar. Priest? What was a priest doing here? How had he known what she was and that she had been conjuring the dead?
Molly moved towards the first priest's body and picked up her scalpel poised to make the distinct Y-incision to begin the autopsy. Just as she started to cut, a familiar baritone filled the air. "What have you found?" Sherlock asked as he came up behind her to peer at the body critically. Molly huffed and put down the scalpel not about to let Sherlock lurk over her shoulder during the autopsy. She turned to glare at him.
"You were right. I'm not OK." Sherlock whispered in a voice that shook with emotion. "I need to know what happened to John. I have to look, but I think I'm going to die. I need you, if I go missing…"
"Gregory, Run! Get into the church, it can't touch you there!" The familiar voice of Father Tragillio warned. Greg didn't think twice and for once did as the old Sicilian priest ordered without question. As he crossed the threshold of the church, he looked back and was shocked by what he saw. The priest came at the creature head on and as it lunged at him making a grab for his throat with its dark claws, Father pulled a wooden stake with a sharpened tip from under his cassock and plunged it into the creatures heart. After a pained screech, it disintegrated to dust as if it had never been. Greg heard Father whisper. "Misereatur tui omnipotens Deus." May almighty God have mercy upon you. Father had then crouched down next to his mother, after checking for a pulse, he shook his head and sighed deeply and murmured in a pained voice "Pax Domini sit semper vobiscum" May the peace of the Lord be always with you. Greg began to shake and his breathing and heart rate doubled as the reality of what he had just witnessed hit him fully. His mother was dead, killed by what appeared to be a vampire.
John, however, could take comfort in the fact that in his most recent 18 months of active military service, he had managed to save more lives and take out more enemy combatants than in all of his previous tours of duty. While he was still occasionally called upon to use his medical skills, medicine was no longer his main focus of his job. He was no longer enlisted with the RAMC. He was now a full combatant, at his own request. He wanted to be on the battlefield fighting alongside his men. He longed to get his hands dirty, and not to be stuck in a field hospital. Though the healer in John was satisfied as he still treated battlefield injuries until help could arrive if there were no other corpsmen available. He accomplished more in these 18 months than he had in all of his previous tours of duty. He had been promoted to the rank of Major within his first six months back on active duty and was due for another promotion to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel after completing his supplementary SAS training which he had been hand selected by Sholto to complete the elite training. It seemed that he wouldn't live to see that promised promotion.
"John, I know you're with Sherlock. I want you to give him a message. I need Sherlock to let me handle this. For some reason, he trusts you. Maybe he'll listen to you." Greg insisted. John frowned as he adjusted the phone bringing it closer to his ear. Why didn't Greg talk to Sherlock directly? When John posed the question the priest snapped at him angrily. "I talked to him until I was blue in the face. He refuses to drop it. Molly gave me the autopsy results. I have enough to go on. I can handle it." John grit his teeth at the revelation. Molly had yet to get back to Sherlock. She was likely withholding the information on purpose. The question was why. Much as John could understand Greg's frustration with Sherlock's methods and attitude, John couldn't deny that he had a valid point. Greg was a target. The priest was right when he claimed that it was personal. That was the precise reason that he should allow Sherlock to at least assist, if not completely take over the case. He couldn't be objective.
Mycroft’s head snapped up and his nostrils flared. He cut Sherlock off with a command. “Attic! Now! You’re presenting, lock the door and don’t come out until it is over. I’ll be in the basement.”
John Watson was dead. The weakest and most immoral part of himself was still there, because he was still alive, but he was just an empty shell, a former shadow of the solider and physician who had protected the crown. He had fallen and was now defeated and powerless. He should have ended it when he had the chance. A pair of blue eyes opened in a pitch-black room, but there were not any emotions in them. Those eyes were empty. He was empty. Death, he prayed for it, yet it still remained elusive.
"There are many." He ground out between harsh breaths. Not good enough. They hadn't come this far for more evasive answers.
"Afghanistan." John replied looking confused. "How did you know that? You told him about me?" John asked Stamford looking bewildered.
"I know." Sherlock said in a soft voice. Molly hummed happy that Sherlock was willing to make that concession. "Molly, can you…" Sherlock trailed off his words heavy with implication.
"Father…what was that?" Greg asked looking the old priest in the eye and shivering at the intense gaze, which the man pinned him with.
"It started with Moriarty. He forced my hand. He threatened everything that I held dear, including John. I had to fall, and then I became a ghost and began to take apart his web piece by piece, until there was just one thread left, but I was too late." Sherlock murmured.
"You know why he's here? He's not paid or anything. He likes it. He gets off on it. The weirder the crime the more he gets off. And you know what? One day showing off won't be enough. One day we'll be standing around a body and Sherlock Holmes will be the one that put it there." She replied confidently.
Sherlock smiled and pulled something from around his neck handing it to John. John looked down at the necklace. It was a small stone carving in the shape of the Eye of Ra. A protective ward, John slipped it around his neck with a nod of thanks. "One more thing, John." Sherlock insisted. He then pulled something from his pocket and placed it into John's hand. "For your Browning." John looked down and three silver bullets lay in his hand. John shook his head in awe of both Sherlock's deductive skill and his gull.
"I knew you'd talk to the people know one else would bother with." Sherlock admitted. While Irene gathered her intel in the bedrooms of powerful men, Sherlock had been leaving a trail of breadcrumbs throughout Kandahar hoping to catch a lead. It now appeared that his efforts had paid off.
John looked around the training camp causing a bittersweet pang of nostalgia to overwhelm him for a moment. Though he was sure that Mycroft could have had the requirement waived, for some reason he had refused to do so. Perhaps it was just bruise John's ego a bit, but John had swallowed his pride and done it. Truthfully, it hadn't been as bad as he first expected. Put in your penance and you shall be rewarded. He thought to himself. While the new recruits were wet behind the ears, they were eager to learn and John had even mentored a few of them. He had managed to make a few good friends in the process. The one thing that had gotten tedious were the basic drills, that was one thing that he could have lived without. He could have run them in his sleep.
Sherlock was speechless. He knew his brother admired their Uncle, but had no idea just how much. Sherlock had never been particularly close to Uncle Rudy. He admired him but he could be cold and ruthless. Mummy, on the other hand, was warm and kind; gentle and loving. Yes, she was submissive, but as an Omega, it was in her nature. Sherlock once again felt fear for what he would become when he presented. It seemed that both Alphas and Omegas were cursed, just in different ways.
"Greg won't appreciate you stepping on his toes on this one. He says it's personal." Molly confided. Sherlock scowled at her and retorted.
Sherlock sniffled and replied. “Not funds, Myc. We are descended from Lords and nobles. Of course they had money. I meant I’m a minor; who will be my guardian? Mother and Father are both gone now. Uncle Rudy died a year before them.” Mycroft scoffed.
“It’s your Mum, John. She’s in a bad way.  She’s in the operating theater at King’s after a car accident.” John shook his head. No! It couldn’t be. His Da was gone killed in action in Belfast during the troubles when he was just a baby and Harry a toddler. He and Harry were just 10 months apart. Irish twins his mother had always joked. His father’s parents had passed away long before John and Harry were born and his mother’s parents had disowned her when his Da presented as Alpha. It hadn’t mattered to them that he had presented in his twenties which was almost unheard of. Nearly all presented by the age of 18. They had married young both just 18 and his mother hadn’t known that Da’s father was an Alpha who married a beta. “There’s a cab waiting to take you to the hospital, son.” His coach said softly pulling John from his thoughts. John nodded numbly as he was led away from the pitch.
The gory story notwithstanding, he also had a reputation almost prohibitively strict and by the book. Insubordination was simply not tolerated. Punishments were often severe, even for simple mistakes. He possessed a commanding presence and had a way of speaking to you as of you were under intense interrogation. You didn't reply to his inquires…you gave up information. That said, however, he was fair. If someone performed admirably, he didn't ignore it. It was acknowledged and often led to promotion. John could understand that. If there was even grain of truth to that story, then policy and procedure should rightfully be the man's top priority and as for commanding presence, that was par for the course in the military. John could deal with it so long as he was fair. High expectations were not a negative in John's mind; they were a requirement.
She hated to impose on Johnny again. Despite their strained relationship, Johnny always offered to help, even when she didn't deserve it. He had been trying to look out for her for as long as she could remember and in the past she hadn't thought twice about accepting his help, but things were different now. She wasn't a kid anymore; what's more, her brother had been through hell. Harry felt her chest tighten as she recalled how Johnny stood in front of their Da and took the beatings without making a sound while she hid in her room hoping and praying that she wouldn't be next. Johnny would provoke him on the nights when he was drunk so that he would go after him instead of her. Da had been a mean son of a bitch and had only gotten meaner after their mother had died of cancer. After she died, the drinking had gone from bad to worse and the more he drank the more abusive he became. Johnny had taken her in when she was a teenage runaway despite the fact that he had enough on his plate with medical school. He had paid to put her through rehab when the drinking got out of control even though he had been deployed in Afghanistan at the time. It had been a very one-sided relationship. He gave and she took.
"Your work is impeccable as always." Mycroft assured and he meant it. Anthea is more than just his personal assistant, so very much more.
"Not a kill shot?" Moran demanded unable to keep the anger out of his voice. He breathed a sigh of relief as Holmes was confirmed to be in serious but stable condition. Holmes needed to live. Moran wasn't done with him, not even close. He had gone to a lot of trouble capturing John Watson and forcing treatments on him. Much to his surprise, Watson had lived though it and transitioned to Omega. It was the one unknown with the experimental treatments and a source of constant frustration. They couldn't control which subjects transitioned to Alpha and Omega. Much to their annoyance there seemed to be an equal chance about 51% of subjects transitioned to Alpha while 49% transitioned to Omega. Pity, Watson would have been a spectacular Alpha. With his military training, he would have been a perfect soldier for their growing ranks. Not the point, Moran reminded himself. Watson was the lure for Holmes. Sherlock Holmes was the end game and the ultimate prize. James Moriarty's death would be avenged.
He caught a glimpse of himself in the reflection of river, and after only three months undercover he could barely recognize himself. He looked emaciated and dirty. He hadn't looked this bad since he was a fully blown drug addict in the peak of using. Sherlock sneered at his appearance. It didn't matter what he looked like, so long as he could complete his mission and make his way back to John, nothing else mattered. He cared nothing about himself. All that mattered was that John was safe. He had done it all for John and Sherlock was not about to let one thread of Moriarty's web escape him and leave John opened to attack. He had been used as a pawn in order to get to Sherlock at the pool then again on the rooftop of St. Bart's and Sherlock intended to be certain that was never allowed to happen again. Sherlock felt his phone vibrate in his pocket. There was only one person with access to this encrypted line. Sherlock was sorely tempted to ignore his brother after his refusal to give him any information regarding John.
Rather than soothe him, as he was sure Mycroft had intended to do, the words only served to increase his guilt. Too late; he should have said something sooner. Sherlock cared about him, but John would never have a chance to find out just how deeply Sherlock's feelings for him went. "I…you can't give me what I want…no one can…It's too late…He's gone. " He choked up and felt the tears that had been threatening to appear slide down his cheeks. He wiped them away quickly. He didn't want Mycroft to see him like this. John wanted nothing more than to go back to Baker's Street and end it all. No more pain, sorrow, regret or guilt. "I have to go." He said as he moved past Mycroft slowly. His leg has been giving him trouble since Sherlock's death and he has been forced to use his cane again.
Much to Greg's surprise Mycroft not only answered but also addressed him by name. "Detective Inspector Lestrade, to what do I owe the pleasure?" Greg smirked for as polite as the words were the tone was glacial. Greg took a deep breath praying that he wouldn't live to regret this.
Harry was fuming when she hung up the phone with the DI. Re-enlisted! Of all the nerve! How the hell had it happened and why had Johnny ever agreed to it? One thing was for certain; she was going to find out, one way or another. She punched in the number to Mycroft Holmes office and was greeted by a posh sounding female voice. "Mycroft Holmes office, how may I assist you?"
John could sympathize. Civilian medicine could be unbearably dull. John had only lasted a year in private practice right out of medical school, before enlisting with the RAMC. That was part of the reason why he had started picking up shifts at the A&E in between cases in addition to working at the surgery when he come back to London and began living with Sherlock at Baker's Street. Some people thrived on predictability and routines, but John wasn't one of those people, and evidently, neither was Murray.
"This isn't just another case, Sherlock. It's personal. Stay out of it. I can handle it." The priest had claimed. Looking back, Sherlock probably should have kept his mouth shut and let Lestrade cool down. With a little time and consideration, he would have come around and Sherlock wouldn't be forced to do this the hard way. But Sherlock, as so often happened when he was chasing a lead, had continued to push. Sherlock then had suggested that Lestrade wasn't able to do it alone and that if he didn't want help he should leave it to Sherlock.
“No. Just to…. I don’t know. I just wish you would someone in.” Greg murmured softly wondering what went on in the all-powerful man’s head.
Irene’s  voice joins the chorus. “Emotional context, Sherlock.” Sherlock chokes back a sob as he recalls John’s horror as he took in Sherlock’s words as he stood on the roof of St. Bart’s. “That’s what people do, isn’t it? Leave a note?”
Now was the time to press him. He wasn't thinking of anything besides getting to completion and he would speak without thinking. Irene gripped his erection tightly, effectively halting his orgasm momentarily. "The POW camps, where are they?" She demanded.
They fell into silence as they arrived in front of Baker’s Street. Sherlock got out with John close behind. “Mrs. Hudson?” John asked as they made their way up the staircase.
Mycroft nodded in acknowledgement but frowned as his gaze drifted from Greg back to John who was still unconscious with Greg's relic glowing brightly around his neck. "Gregory, I hate to press you when you are already overexerted, but this matter must be addressed." Mycroft explained as he pointed his wand in John's direction before continuing. "What have you done to him? What has he become?"
"What do you want?" He asked bluntly looking down at Sherlock's grave and felt his throat tighten at the sight. He would never see his friend again. He was too late. There would be no second chances.
When he was very small, Father had explained to him that Mycroft suffered from horrible headaches. That the pain and nausea came close to crippling him at times. Only once did he try opening the door to the room you shared with Mycroft after Father had laid him down for a nap. He can still hear the anger in their father’s voice over your protests that you had only wanted to comfort your big brother. For years, Sherlock had blamed him for driving this wedge between the two of them, for making him feel like he was always underfoot, for locking you out, but seen through the lens of the last week, he feels none of what he felt before.
"Thank you," John murmured feeling relaxed and replete. His eyes started to drift shut as exhaustion overtook him seemingly unaware of how close he had come to killing his friend.
“How did you find me?” John cut him off abruptly leaving Sherlock speechless with the sudden change of subject, his head pounded and he felt dizzy as John took in his gaunt appearance.
“Come here, scent but make it quick.” Sherlock didn’t need to be told twice as he hugged Mycroft and buried his nose in his neck taking in the comforting scent of kin. It was a calming balm to his frayed nerves. He could now pick up subtle notes in his brother’s scent as well as his powerful Alpha pheromones. Their intensity surprised him considering Mycroft was on suppressants. Mycroft took him by surprise again when he returned the gesture burying his nose into Sherlock’s neck and scenting deeply before pulling away. “Go! Now!” Mycroft insisted as his brother bolted from the room headed towards the basement staircase.
Sherlock shook his head causing his head to spin. He hadn’t wanted to but Moriarty had forced his hand.
"I think you're damaged, delusional and believe in a higher power, in this case it's yourself." Sherlock's eyes darkened with emotion and Irene wished that she could take the words back, but she couldn't. So she went on attempting to explain. "The masks that you wear, the ones that you believe hide your pain; they are nothing but a self portrait." Sherlock sighed seeming to accept the words without further comment. Irene struggled to read him. In many ways, it had been easier before the fall. The masks were easy to see through. Now, she stared at the man behind the mirror and he was a complete mystery to her. "How did John Watson do it? Capture your heart?" Sherlock looked at her blankly for a moment before he replied.
"I know," Lestrade taunted, "and this is just losing." He took a deep breath and pulled a silver rosary from his cassock. He made the sign of the cross and it pulsed with holy magic as he began to chant. "Libera nos a malo, quaesumus, domine, ab omnibus malis, praeteritis, praesentibus et futuris. Da propitius pacem in diebus nostris: ut ope misericordiae tuae adjuti, et a peccato simus semper liberi, et ab omni perturbatione securi." Deliver us from evil, we beseech thee, O Lord, from all evils, past, present, and to come. Mercifully, grant peace in our days, that through the bounteous help of thy mercy we may always be free of sin and safe from all disquiet.
"You're type II. So am I." Murray ground out in a choked whisper. "I don't have long, I think it starting. Neither will you…if you're type II, you disappear, but not before. Oh God…" He trailed off unable to calm the panic, that was quickly overtaking him as John interjected.
Sherlock had met Angelo, as he did with so many people, on a case. He had cleared Angelo's name. The man had been wrongly charged with murder by the Met when his wife went missing. When her body showed up in the Thames, Sherlock had known that an Undine or Water Elemental had been responsible for her death. It was one of the few supernatural cases of his, which was still unsolved, and it vexed Sherlock to this day. Though he was unable to find the elemental, Sherlock was sure to give Angelo an alibi. He could not have killed his wife because he had been house breaking at the time. While Angelo had been convicted of house breaking, the man had nevertheless been grateful to Sherlock for clearing his name in regards to the murder.
"He's as good as it." Anthea interjected as she eyed John's pallid, motionless body staring seemingly mesmerized by the white shimmering tattoo. "Would you like to do it or shall I?" She asked with a look in Mycroft's direction.
"Are you flirting?" John asked looking confused. Sherlock raised an eyebrow knowing that she was just playing with him now. It was a game to her.
"No, John's not gay." Sherlock claimed. Irene sighed wondering if she had just made a fatal mistake. Some things were better left buried and this may have been one of them.
Greg had felt hurt and angry. No gratitude. Not even a thank you, only prideful anger at having missed something about Greg's past. "That was me saving your arse! Why didn't you come to me? I could have helped. That's what friends do!" Greg had shouted.
"Lestrade, stop!" A deep baritone voice called. Molly looked up and saw most beautiful man that she had ever seen. He was gorgeous with porcelain skin, high cheekbones, full lips, with grey-green eyes and inky curls, tall and lithe. Molly stopped struggling and stared at him unabashedly. "She's telling the truth. I've found the hoof prints."
"Come on, then. I'll show you the scene." Greg acquiesced. He turned and led them through the entrance towards the bloody statue and the alter. Greg watched Sherlock scan the scene with his eyes without moving a muscle. "Demon."
John had been walking down the street after another fruitless interview when he had passed a man on a bench who called him by name. John looked at the man, but didn't immediately recognize him. It was after speaking to him that he realized that it was Mike Stamford. Mike had been friendly and offered to recommend him for an interview at the A&E at Bart's and when John had mentioned that he was looking for a flatmate Mike had eluded to knowing someone who might be appropriate.
Sherlock came down hard and fast. As he came back to himself, the sight a woman greeted him, blonde with porcelain skin and blue eyes. She stared at him with an unreadable expression. This was her, the woman mentioned in Mycroft's report. AGRA agent. True name unknown, alias Mary Morstan. She was the missing link to John. Sherlock had taken a gamble and won. She had shown her hand when she had surfaced. John's disappearance could not have been a coincidence. It was connected to him some how and Sherlock was determined to find out how.
“It is different for each couple but the Alpha needs to show he can provide. Once he has proven himself a worthy provider, the Alpha will preen and allow the Omega to scent them. If the Omega approves of the Alphas scent, then they allow the Alpha to reciprocate. If the scents are compatible then the courting continues. The Alpha and Omega will go on outings and begin to appear in public together. Once the Omega is comfortable, they begin marking each other with their scents to let rivals know that they are spoken for. The last step is bonding which is achieved during heat which will trigger rut in an Alpha and bond bites are exchanged.” Mummy explained pointing to the scar on her neck.
Mycroft moved down the corridor quickly. As he opened the door to the indoor pool, nothing greeted them but the smell of chlorine and the gentle hum of the pumps. Their footsteps echoed across the titled floor. Mycroft pulled out his scrying stone from his vest pocket. "James Moriarty." He commanded. Anthea peered over his shoulder as the stone glowed eerily and the tragic scene played out in front of their eyes.
"Most definitely." Sherlock insisted. "But what was the motive for the vampire? There are easier ways to feed and enslave thralls. You don't need a succubus and soul eater for that. We're missing something. We should have taken the pendant that she was wearing. It might have led us to the vampire."
After enduring half an hour of bumbling questions from Donovan, Sherlock had been released. "Not enough evidence to hold you yet, Freak." She had claimed not bothering to hide her disgust with him. Sherlock hadn't been concerned. He had nearly refused to go in for questioning solely based on the principle. After all, he had nothing to do with the boy's death, but he had wanted to get more information on the murder and this was a quick and easy way to get it.
"John, there's nothing until we have those results. Molly is moving at a snail's pace. I can't take it. Get me some. Get me some now!" Sherlock demanded. John frowned at him and replied crossly.
The first time that she informally met Mycroft Holmes, he was a senior agent at SIS. He had worked within both MI5 and MI6 moving effortlessly between the two departments and had developed a flawless reputation. She had been an intern just out of University. She had nearly tripped as she stared at him not paying attention to where she was going. He had been stunning; impeccably dressed with wavy auburn hair and dark blue eyes and though his aquiline nose was a bit severe, it only emphasized his regal presence and air of authority. She knew at that first moment with just one look that she was hopelessly smitten. Try as she might, she never saw him again at Vauxhall. He transferred into a high level position in parliament. Though if one were foolish enough to ask what his job involved, his reply would be simple servant or minor position in the British government, though nothing could be further from the truth. Mycroft Holmes soon became one of the most powerful and influential people in all of Great Britain. There were rumors that he was untouchable, cold, calculating, and ambitious to a fault earning him the nickname iceman. Despite it all, she never forgot him though. She worked her way up at MI6 as an agent developing a number of invaluable skills.
Mycroft frowned as he looked down at the contact number and he peeled off his gloves and sent a quick text to Anthea, asking her to send a car, then stood on the curb to wait. His fingers twitched against the black wool of his coat. He was desperate for a cigarette. He knew precisely where this conversation would lead. The detective could be a stubborn as his brother and that was saying something. “Detective Inspector, how, may I inquire, did you obtain this number?”
"Thank you, Greg…your light, it's so pure and so rare for a mortal. I want to give you something." Greg opened his mouth to refuse, for John owed him nothing. Greg had merely granted his request. "No, take it." John said firmly digging deep into the pocket of his jacket and pulling out a perfectly formed pure white feather. "What's left of my wings…I want you to have it. It will act as a powerful ward and conduit for your holy magic." Greg shook his head.
John took the blood bag from Molly gratefully. "Thank you." John murmured softly. His voice echoed in the nearly empty morgue. Molly nodded stiffly moving to stand behind Sherlock. They watched anxiously as John pierced the bag with his fangs and sucked taking a large swallow. It tasted wrong, cold for one, but even more off putting than the frigid temperature was rancid taste. His stomach cramped and John couldn't help but heave as he vomited up the blood. John whimpered in frustration as the hunger rose once again. Blood, he needed fresh blood. "Please, I'm so hungry." John pleaded staring at Sherlock unable to tare his eyes away from his jugular. John knew he must look monstrous with his fangs fully elongated and his mouth stained with blood. Sherlock stared at John seemingly considering his options.
Anthea's voice pulled Sherlock from his dark spiraling thoughts. "You don't have a choice. You have to push him. It was the priest's his holy magic and light which saved John from falling to the darkness completely, Greg's the best chance we have at keeping him in control." She insisted looking his brother squarely in the eye. Mycroft grit his teeth, obviously conflicted as he stared at John looking worried and a bit awestruck.
"No need. I deduced all of that from your appearance and behavior." Sherlock said without further explanation. The man came closer and whispered in Greg's ear. "Give me the crime file and I'll solve it. The name is Sherlock Holmes and the address is 221B Baker's Street." He then turned on his heel and left as mysteriously as he came leaving Greg more than a bit confused and bewildered.
He then laughed but it was hollow. "Yes, the bravery of the solider. Bravery is by far the kindest word for stupidity, don't you think?" He goaded. John's eyes narrowed as he tried to figure out who this man was and what he wanted with him. He would have some of the answers sooner than he thought.
Irene's words echoed in his mind palace seemingly mocking him. I think you're damaged, delusional and believe in a higher power. In you case, it's yourself.
Sherlock had sneered at him with a harsh retort. "I don't have friends! Alone is what I have. Alone protects me." Greg had seethed and replied in a heated voice.
John chuckled softly before responding. "No, I haven't heard anything. But I doubt we'll be assigned together. I have requested to serve as a full combatant rather than serve with the RAMC. I haven't been assigned a regiment yet. Though I suspect that when I am assigned, it will be the with Fusilier's as I served with that regiment during my last tour in Afghanistan." John explained. Bill's eyes widened at the admission clearly taken by surprise.
"He knows Molly. He knows everything; that I am a hunter, that Greg is an honor guard, Mycroft a mage and it is very likely that he knows that you are a necromancer, even though I had yet to tell him so." Sherlock replied. Molly blanched before stammering.
Greg took a drag off of his cigarette. He was still waiting for the other shoe to drop. He and Molly had made it out of Afghanistan alive, but there had been complete and utter radio silence in regards to Sherlock and John. Greg had expected the information to be scare but it was as if anyone involved had dropped off the face of the earth. Greg had been calling on contacts and chasing leads without success. Greg wasn’t stupid, he knew that Sherlock and John, assuming he was still alive, had gone to ground in Afghanistan, but so had everyone else.
There is little reason to stay but something makes him twist the long, brass key he keeps stuck in the doorknob of the Shadow Room. The room is cold, as it always is, and unlit. From his pocket, he pulls out a torch to light the way to the small chest of drawers that sits in the center.
"What do you think, Sherlock?" John prompted although John already had a good idea of what creature had caused the man's untimely death.
Greg played the voicemail back a second time unsure if this was some kind of joke. Greg knew that John had a sister, but didn't realize that they still spoke. John had never mentioned her. Greg did recall Sherlock making a deduction about John rationing his alcohol use because of his sister. Though Greg had never asked John about it directly, he had assumed that his sister's drinking was the reason that they weren't close and why he never talked about her. Now Greg gets a phone call out of the blue asking for John's contact information. Even if he believed the lady, who wasn't sure about, he had no idea how to get a hold of John since he had re-enlisted. The only one who might have a shot in hell at getting a message to John was Mycroft Holmes. Greg toyed with the idea of pointing the woman in his direction just to see what would happen. It would be entertaining, that much was for sure. Then again, that might be cruel and unusual punishment.
"We have a case. We're looking for a succubus. Will you contact me if you come across any information on its whereabouts?" Sherlock asked. The boy nodded warily staring at John. Sherlock glanced in his direction and then quickly reassured the boy. "John knows I'm a hunter, he knows quite a bit in fact, not a goldfish. You can speak freely."
His eyes flickered up as his new troop assembled for the first time. Sholto stared them down daring them break protocol. If there was one thing that he was unyielding about it was SOP. Policies were in place for a reason, and barring a complete and utter clusterfuck, they were never to be ignored. He could easily pick out the officers amongst them. Jones, with his bloodhound by his side, stood tall and unwavering. The man had dark hair and eyes with an impressive build; the picture of an officer. Sholto's eyes then moved over to Watson. The man was at first glance was unimpressive. He was only about 5'6 with sandy blond hair, just beginning to grey at the temples with a compact build. But if one looked beyond the obvious, his eyes hinted at something much more dangerous hiding behind the unassuming appearance. They were the eyes of a man who had seen too much, a man on the edge. There was a story there and he intended to do some digging to find out more.
"I…" John trailed off as he began to consider the option. He had to admit that it was tempting. He thrived on danger, always had. He already had a death wish, if he were to be killed in action, then at least he would be serving crown and country and his death could mean something. Perhaps he could save a few lives along the way. If he didn't enjoy or if didn't work out, well there was always suicide, which he had already been planning on. "All right, Mycroft. I think I'd like to give it a shot. I'll take you up on your offer." John admitted with a ghost of a smile as the irony of his words hit him.
"Not a goldfish." That was all the explanation that she received before Sherlock promptly brought the subject back to the priests, which lay dead on her slab. "Well, are you going to get on with it?" Sherlock asked with a gesture at the bodies. Molly shook her head refusing to allow Sherlock to watch her work. Sherlock rolled his eyes then offered an even more outrageous suggestion. "There's a much faster way. Conjure. Let them tell you their stories." Sherlock insisted.
"Billy, Toby, what brings you here?" Sherlock asked as the little boy made himself at home in Sherlock's chair and began to eat his way through all of Mrs. Hudson's scones and biscuits. The large dog leaned against Sherlock wagging its tail furiously as Sherlock scratched behind its ear obviously enjoying the attention. The little boy stopped when he caught John staring at in confusion.
"He is currently away from his desk. He is out on case, but you can leave a voice mail. I'll connect you to his desk extension." Before Harriet could reply there was a beep and an outgoing message asking for her name, contact info and a brief description of her inquiry. After leaving her number, Harriet went on to say.
"I've got the bodies in the morgue. I haven't done the autopsies yet." She admitted. "Have you called Sherlock?"
Sherlock studied his biology book with increasing unease. It was an old book which was no longer published that had been passed down within the family for several generations. It contained a wealth of information regarding Alpha/Omega biology. According to the text, Alphas were born at higher percentages than Omegas. The vast majority of Alphas were male. Female Alphas were nearly extinct as they were sterile unable to bare or sire children. The vast majority of Omegas were female. The male Omega gene was recessive making male Omegas rare. Male Omegas were a bit of an anomaly in that they were in a true sense hermaphrodites. They tended to be less submissive than their female counterparts and more independent. They had a functioning set of male and female organs and could bare or sire children. They tended to run in families as the recessive gene must be present. Though they could breed with Betas, their heats could only be satisfied by an Alpha making the chances of them siring offspring much less likely than baring children. They were highly sought after by Alphas as they were slightly more fertile than female Omegas and more likely to produce Omega children making them highly prized by traffickers.
"Keep your eyes and ears opened, Sherlock may surface in order to call in favors from a any number of his contacts. Watch your step, there is still one thread left in Moriarty's web left unaccounted for."
John swallowed before he answered in a soft voice. "I've seen heaven and hell and just about everything in between. I'm just trying to earn forgiveness." John admitted. It wasn't the whole truth, far from it, but it was the best he could offer.
"Sure," John replied handing it over and the man had murmured his thanks under his breath before asking.
"You have any open cases with the Met right now?" Greg asked. Sherlock shook his head. Before he could elaborate further, the woman approached Sherlock looking him straight in the eye. She had dark brown eyes with mocha colored skin and dark curly hair. She sneered at Sherlock not bothering to hide the contempt in her eyes.
"Yeah, he's always like that." John shook his head wondering what he was getting himself into. "Come on then, I'll introduce you to Sarah, she's the head doc in the A&E. John followed as Mike led the way.
"That's what Greg said. Lost cause, yet the ritual worked. Not fully, but enough to save John's grace." Sherlock retorted. Molly sighed unwilling to argue. They would know soon enough.
"You have my word, nothing in that report will be disclosed. I need to find him Molly, even if he's dead. I need to bring him home." Sherlock promised sincerely. Molly sighed praying that she wouldn't regret this. Mycroft Holmes was not to be crossed.
“You shouldn’t have done it. None of it.The ritual was madness and it backfired. Rather than cure me, it only went half way.  It nearly killed Greg, who is a bloody honor guard, for God’s sake, what were you all thinking? Now I’m stuck in limbo. I’d be better off dead.” John hissed as his fangs descended with his anger.
Sherlock followed his brother into Musgrave leaving the private cemetery in which all their relatives were buried. They weaved through the halls stopping in the music room. Mycroft sat at the piano bench facing away from his beloved grand piano and Sherlock sat opposite him in the chair near the music stand next to his stradivarius. Sherlock couldn’t wait any longer and blurted out. “How? How will you look after me? You just turned 18 last week and you are still in University...” Sherlock trailed off trying to keep his voice calm and steady as he looked into Mycroft’s determined face.
"Because he's a psychopath and psychopaths get bored. Stay away from Sherlock Holmes." She warned before turning away and slipping into the crowd leaving John angry and frustrated. He turned around and left the way he came intending to go back to Baker's Street.
When the assignments finally come through, John's official letter read Royal Regiment of Fusiliers. It had come as no surprise and had caused a rush of feelings to come forth ranging loyalty and nostalgia, to eager anticipation, and if he was completely honest, a hint of anxiety. John had grown used to the flexibility of civilian life. While the phase 1 training had allowed him to brush up on the basics and begin to acclimate back into active service, training was not the battlefield. John could take comfort in the fact that so far things had gone smoothly. It was surprising how quickly the routines had come back to him. It was amazing how much his body remembered, often before his mind questioned or responded. Some things became so deeply ingrained that they could never be forgotten, but this was no longer training. He would be back in combat soon.
"Mycroft will be down for a while John, it would be best left alone. You may do more harm than good. Anthea, on the other hand, you must release your command. I must warn you though, she will likely not be pleased with you." Sherlock explained with a haunted look in his eyes as he looked between Greg and John. Greg could understand why Sherlock appeared so shaken. Soul gazing was an intimate act causing a temporary intertwining of mind and soul. Greg had been very lucky. It could have gone horribly wrong.
"I'm not implying anything. I'm sure you came round for a little chat and just happened to stay over and I think it's safe to assume you scrubbed his floors going by the state of your knees." Sherlock had then turned and walked out of the Met without another word leaving Sally Donovan both speechless and humiliated.
“You’ve long suspected the truth about my vocation for some time. Understood, at least in part, my responsibilities.”
"Suicide is a mortal sin." The response slipped from Greg's lips without thought a tenet so engrained within him it came naturally. Greg caught a ghost of a smile on John's face before it slipped away as he murmured softly in response.
The room was silent but for the tapping of fingers across the keyboard. Mycroft scanned the encrypted files quickly noting the audit trail. It had been years since he had hacked into complex data bases but he was getting desperate.  Sherlock had vanished deep underground into the Afghan desert and none of Mycroft's contacts had come through. He was still flying blind and he was not about to lose everything that he had worked to protect, legality be damned. He had been walking a tightrope since Sherlock's fall, but despite the best intentions and meticulous care nothing had gone according to plan. Mycroft had basic information. Sebastian Moran was James Moriarty's second in command. Sherlock had been positive that he was behind John's  disappearance. Mycroft was inclined to agree. The man was a mercenary and meticulous. His name was whispered amongst criminal and official circles but he was never seen or heard. The only proof of his existence lay in the trail of death, but it was so random it bordered on untraceable.
"Aye, no thanks to you." The priest snapped in an irritated voice. "I had a run in with the succubus."
"Do you see the camera, Dr. Watson?" The voice continued. John looked up and watched the camera move and focus on him, before turning in the opposite direction. "There's another on the building opposite you."
“I think you keep things to yourself when you might be better off getting advice from other people.” Greg hedged unwilling to admit the truth.
The name sets off alarm bells in John's mind, but he calmly replied. "What are you talking about? I don't even know you." But that was a lie, John knew quite a bit about this man. There had been whispers throughout his training with SAS about blackop agents that had gone rogue. They were loyal to no one and faded into obscurity becoming ghosts. A name that had come up again and again was Colonel Sebastian Moran. AWOL for years, leaving no trace of evidence, besides a path of destruction in his wake. He was wanted by multiple government agencies for everything from murder to treason to espionage.
