Sherlock hasn’t spoken in thirteen hours. Hasn’t acknowledge John in the last seven, despite his being in the same room for more than half that time, and the three times John has left the flat and come back directly in his view.  It hasn’t happened often, but whenever Sherlock gets in these moods, John feels superfluous in ways he hasn’t since he’d first met Mycroft Holmes in an abandoned warehouse.
Sherlock is hooked, addicted; and he knows addiction well. He thinks it is probably obvious, to anyone who knows him at least. Lestrade has asked him twice what’s been keeping him so busy; a look on his face that is part morbid curiosity and part terror. And Mycroft has been full of jabs and insinuations.
Later that evening, after John has made a makeshift dinner and they’re lounging around, Sherlock speaks up.
Three days later and Sherlock was hoping Mrs. Hudson was not regretting her decision to let to Sherlock. There’d not been a case since the green ladder solution, and Sherlock had moved from bored to dangerously bored. His brain was rebelling and the nicotine patches were a poor substitute for the real thing, but he’d smoked the few he’d found at SIS already and the rest of his stash hadn’t made it past the move. He was just contemplating the merits of changing out of his pajamas and going on the hunt when Mycroft walked in.
John tensed at the entire exchange. He’d known he wasn’t supposed to interact with the SIS employees, but he couldn’t seem to resist the pull of Sherlock. And Sherlock certainly hadn’t resisted.
Sherlock’s chuckle, deep and rare, follows him as he walks away. John stares at the pair for a moment before turning on his heel. “Don’t think I won’t be back to hear about this,” he turns and adds quickly before following after Sherlock. Sal only waves his arm lazily at him in return.
“Like I’m turning down caffeine after having to deal with Mycroft,” John replied with a snort and reached for the cup with a J on it. The silence settled between them habitually, days of riding to and from the SIS coming back to both of their memories.
“Jesus, Sherlock. You didn’t misread the situation. Or me!” He yelled, trying to get him to stop moving, to stop hiding.
“Will he come and save you? Time is counting down. Where is the great Sherlock Holmes? His fan has so much to say about him.” She yelled out, voice lilting.
“Probably not,” Sal responded. “Some are allowed, but not many. But most people won’t say anything to him—he’s made even some of the seasoned agents cry before. Trust me; it isn’t pretty when he does it.”
They started off like that, then; casually. It wasn’t until they’d ordered and settled in that Sherlock started to look nervous suddenly; there was a little tick to his eyes and he has his phone out on the table next to his hand instead of tucked away where it had been. Nevertheless, he had been making small talk while they’d drank their wine and John thought it was wonderful. He could and would stare at his mouth and hands as he talked all day long, enthralled. Suddenly Sherlock trailed off as he glanced at the newest message on his phone and leaned in close across the table.
The car pulls to a stop and the driver opens the door for them, standing guard as he ushers them out. Anthea wishes them well before the door is shut quickly behind them. They are just outside Larvotto Anthea had informed them, barely inside the border, and they are on a slight hill. John imagines he can see the lights and almost hear the sounds of Monte Carlo from here; he’d never pictured himself there as he’d heard colleagues doing, and it seems almost crass to be thinking that now. He clears his throat and rotates on his heel, following Sherlock in silence towards the small building they’d been dropped at.
“You just happened to be in The Landau at the same exact moment as our suspect?” Lestrade asked with a barely repressed sigh. “And got yourself shot?”
“Queen and Country, Sherlock. This explicitly violates multiple statutes in place, and you are well aware of that. Plus, I am, as always, concerned about you.”
“I’m saying you and me. That you didn’t misread it, and I wasn’t confused!” John tried to rein his voice in, but it still came out almost as a yell. Quietly, he added on, “And I thought maybe you were thinking that as well.”
The midafternoon rush was dying down and John was watching the few agents and other workers who were milling about, when a man strolled up, talking on the phone animatedly. John remembered this bloke from the other day—hard to forget a posh git like him, especially with a drink order like that. Where he put the calories was anyone’s guess, though I suppose with 4 shots, he probably burned if off through pure energy. There was something about him though, and John was fascinated as he half-listened to the one-sided conversation.
Adrenaline was high between them again as they took a cab back to Baker Street. It reminded John of their last case together, and he wondered if this would be the tipping point yet again, if they would cement some weird pattern between them. There’d been relatively few physical interactions between the two, and John couldn’t decide where they stood or how he felt about it all. The air seemed to spark when they were in too close of proximity to each other though, and John’s mind often drifted to those kisses they’d exchanged, of the words Sherlock had whispered, half in promise and half in threat.
John stared around in confusion unable to process immediately what was going on, save the giant arrow still pointed towards him, or who this woman was.
Sherlock stopped and turned. “Really? That seems a bit unlikely. I’m not sure any of those words were ever included in any Byronic type prose.” His face turned thoughtful, as if he were going over the words and searching for them in his mind palace, cross referencing them against the few romantic texts that had somehow avoided deletion.
His latest words may have finally worked though, if Sherlock’s suddenly horrified face is anything to go by. He angrily plucks his phone from its perch on the desk and taps out a short message; all jabs and brash strokes across the screen.
He phoned in his order at their now usual Thai place before he caught the Tube and it was ready for him once he’d exited the station, popping directly into the conveniently located restaurant. Once back at the flat, John ate his food quickly. Sherlock herded him along the entire time and it was all John could do not to choke as he shoveled the food into his mouth.
John has just started to laugh in reply when they are both brought up short by the sudden appearance of a black sedan, and John pulls to parade rest in one fluid motion. John watched carefully as Anthea, followed by Mycroft, climbed out of the backseat.
“Pretty famous, John? If he were merely ‘pretty famous’ then I would merely be intelligent. Hardly likely,” he says with a snort.
“Really, Sherlock, it’s fine, it wasn’t necessary,” John interrupts. Sherlock pins him with a glare that he can’t quite decipher.
“So how is life out there treating you?” Sal asks as he rings up the two drinks. John doesn’t say anything, only smiles, when he adds the employee discount on the till.
“Pretty sure I didn’t do much of anything. You figured it all out yourself, talked that guys’ ear off until he was so confused he confessed, and found where he’d hidden the rest of the money. Incredible.”
They talked particulars for a few minutes and Sherlock agreed to move in as soon as his current landlord would let him out of his lease. He reassured Mrs. Hudson that it wouldn’t be long. After all, there was no love lost between him and his current landlord, especially not since that small incident with the experiment Sherlock had unfortunately, and quite by accident, blown up the week before.
John can’t help the slightly besotted smile that spreads across his face. He wouldn’t trade Sherlock for anything, forgotten sometimes or not. “It’s almost one, Sherlock. Come lie down for a couple of hours. Your brain needs a break.”
Sherlock continued to text for a few minutes, longer than he usually maintained with Mycroft, and suddenly announced they had a case. (“Only a six, John, but Lestrade is begging.”) They were out the door and had hailed a cab within minutes.
“Bastard,” John chortled softly. “I was thinking of writing up the cases–wondered if you’d be okay with that? What you’d think of it.”
Sherlock hesitated. He wanted to ignore him, wanted to scream in frustration at the sheer idiocy that seemed to surround him. But he couldn’t. Lestrade was... he was one of the good guys and Sherlock respected him, despite his somewhat slow nature. And he’d had done a lot for him over the years, even though it was somewhat against regulations to sometimes have Sherlock at the crime scenes.
John, still red from the last comment, grabs Sherlock by the arm and tugs him towards the door. “Ducky, Sal, we’ll be seeing you!”
He is surprised when he walked out a few minutes later with a job. It wasn’t exactly the worst interview he’d ever done, paled in comparison to the one with Mycroft in fact, but he’d certainly got odd vibes from Dr. Sawyer.
John sleeps until eight, a feat which surprises him, despite the late night. Sherlock is gone when he wakes, bed cold next to him, despite the sun shining onto it. That part doesn’t surprise him. He heads down to make breakfast, to force some food on Sherlock, and whistles as he goes.
The week passed in a blur though as he slowly began to get the hang of the different pieces and parts of the job and equipment. London was apparently more caffeine deprived than he realized as the steams of people never seemed to fully lessen throughout the day. Most people were also quite pleasant. This shop had regulars and the baristas often chatted with them and knew some by name and even more by their drink. It was almost like a neighborhood and John could see why Ella would recommend a job where he interacted so frequently with such normal, everyday kind of people. John had even felt better enough to attempt to chat up a female customer. It didn’t amount to anything, but he felt more like his old self than he had since before he’d been shot.
Sherlock spends almost twenty minutes at the scene—the jewelry store that was the third location. He is meticulous in a way that, though not unusual, seems a bit off to John. It takes him a moment to realize it is the quietness; not just Sally it seems is on their best behavior tonight. After that it is three days of chasing leads, both figuratively and literally. The odd connections between the robberies—each house had a poinsettia from the same florist, each family had a daughter between the ages of 5 and 7—are examined and investigated from every angle.
“Oh, please, as if Anthea’s schedule was that hard to manipulate,” Sherlock responded with a put-upon sigh.
The sun may have been shining outside, but inside, Sherlock Holmes was a veritable tornado storming through the corridors of the SIS building on the way to his brother’s office. Sherlock may not have officially been MI6, but having been given clearance to rival any agent years back, it was not unusual for him to storm into the building intent on crossing paths with one Mycroft Holmes. He even technically held an office, as a sometimes consultant, should he have need of it, but was rarely inside of it, especially during ‘normal’ business hours. It was still a cluttered mess of research, paraphernalia, and data however. Sherlock had worked twelve or so cases for MI6 in the last 3 years, and every time refused their offer for a full time position. Most of the directors were pleased by that turn of events, as few could stand to work with Sherlock outside of the few day or week long stints they’d each been subjected to for the cases. He’d proved his worth each time though, to the grudging acceptance of Mycroft’s underlings.
“Crime scenes so different it’s almost comical. Almost intentional.” Sherlock adds on slowly, eyes narrowing as they meet John’s.
The corridor was lit and led to a small room that had two wooden desk chairs separated by a table. It reminded John oddly of an interrogation room and it did nothing to ease his heightened awareness.
John sat at the table. He thought about making tea—he was good at that. No screwing up there. But, as he stared at the take away cup that still sat on the table, he decided to reheat it and drink that instead. A small showing, even if Sherlock may never know about it.
John decided that he and Sherlock must have been giving off vibes. Mycroft was one thing, but now it had spread. They were at the crime scene when Lestrade approached John to quietly inquire about ‘just what the bloody hell’ the two of them were doing.
“We’ve been seeing you a lot more around here, Sherlock, and I can’t help but wonder why?” Mycroft said it with a smirk on his face, as if he already knew the answer.
“If you can call four individuals ‘adults’ whom, in turn, court predilections for infantilism, alcoholism, chocolate HobNobs, torture, daytime telly, unicorns, and cross-dressing.”
“Don’t go expecting that every time,” John replied with a sigh, not even sure which question either Sherlock or he was addressing. Because, really, what else was there to say at this point. He didn’t think Sherlock was ready to hear some of the words that had threatened to graze past John’s lips. And John wasn’t sure he was ready to same them, even if they were true. Even if he wanted to.
Once, the man held his phone out for John to see. There was a picture of a bruised and bloodied neck and upper torso displayed on the screen.
And so when John Watson opened the door to the usual black car that took him home, Sherlock put on his most pleasant smile.
“Several violations have been committed, Dr. Watson, and we need to discuss them,” Mycroft began in a drone.
The third time John saw the mysterious posh man was the day that everything stated to change. It wasn’t life altering, but a slow path, as if plotted out by the universe. He watched him covertly as he approached the counter. It was during a lull in the early afternoon, close enough to lunch still that the mid-afternoon caffeine rush wasn’t upon them yet. The man had a very different attitude and demeanor than the rest of the workers they saw around here–a combination that was both more flamboyant and less social.
John sets himself down in his chair with his doctored tea. “Aren’t you coming in?” He asks with a smile. Sherlock makes a slightly distracted sound but he can hear him shuffling his papers into a pile. There hadn’t been much to John’s small stash of gifts under their small tree; he’d picked out small things for Lestrade and Mrs. H as well as presents to take tomorrow for Sherlock’s parents, Mycroft, and Anthea. He’d purposely kept Sherlock’s at work once it was ready and, thanks to the last minute case, had been able to sneak it in yesterday without any notice or suspicion at all. He can tell the moment Sherlock notices it though, his steps slow and his mug shakes slightly.
They enter through a back door entrance John hadn’t known existed (“Honestly, John. Did you really expect all of the agents to walk in through the front door or the service entrance?” Sherlock had all but sneered at him) and navigate a complex hallway system before ending outside an office door.
And Sherlock’s bloody lucky John thinks so fast on his feet. He’d seized the second wine bottle, still full, just before Sherlock had upset the table and his aim was perfect, even if his timing wasn’t. The chef fired the gun milliseconds before the bottle impacted with his head. John managed to startle him enough to throw off his aim, but John still threw himself down to Sherlock the second he was done.
He needed a phone. A phone that wasn’t his, with a number that wouldn’t be recognized. So he sent a text. Then another. Then he paused, thought a moment, and sent one more. He needed John he’d decided, wanted him, and he wasn’t going to let there be another option. And intrigue and danger were the way to get there. He’d pegged John the moment he’d laid eyes on him fully—adrenaline junky with a side of protector. Sherlock couldn’t have ordered a better companion if he’d tried. But it wasn’t just those things. Having spent even just a limited amount of time within John’s presence, Sherlock felt drawn. From the moment the word ‘fantastic’ had left John Watson’s lips, Sherlock was hooked. And he was prepared to do anything to keep John in his life—including going up against Mycroft and the entire SIS.
Anthea is holding the car door open, fingers flying over the keys of her phone quickly, despite the darkening sky, obviously impatient for them to climb in. How she can appear at once both completely blasé and over important is just one of her many mysteries to John.
Lestrade had even made it in time for the exciting conclusion and confession drawn from having the twenty-something son held at gunpoint by a furious John. The young man had swung a random piece of industrial wood at Sherlock, nearly rendering him unconscious. John had not been pleased. He figured the man should be lucky that Lestrade arrived when he did. The father may have confessed under duress while John held the gun, but only the combined efforts of Sherlock and Lestrade had convinced John to lower the weapon.
Two days passed in similar fashion. Sherlock seemed to dart off and disappear the moment John was awake and down the stairs. It was frustrating and John couldn’t figure out what he’d done to annoy the man, other than his apparently loud typing. Hardly seemed justified—though Sherlock’s world vision was decidedly different than John’s.
“A job, John,” she replied in that same maddeningly steady voice she always seemed to use. “I think it will help you, help regain some stability and routine in your life.”
“I know, John. You don’t have to make a career out of it, but it could be a good start. Will you at least go for an interview? I set one up for you this week. You don’t have to, but I think it might be good for you.”
Sherlock had sent John a text mid-day telling him to meet him and The Landau at 18:30. He had also instructed that John wear the contents of a package to be delivered that afternoon in lieu of one of his usual jumpers.
“Sherlock, that may have been the single most romantic thing anyone has ever said to me,” John replied with a smile as he stood up and headed towards where Sherlock was still standing rigidly in the kitchen.
The moment of clarity was now. Or, it normally would have been. It was a three-patch-problem and Sherlock had three patches on his arm. And he was in his second favorite position in the flat—laying supine along the couch. These factors should have ensured that he was engrossed in thought on the case—her case. But his thoughts kept straying. John Watson. Doctor John Watson. Captain John Watson. The words, the titles, danced around in his head as he tried to focus.
Glancing down at himself, Sherlock seems confused. A bemused look crosses his face. “Oh, well, in five minutes we’re going on a walk then.”
It is two hours in the small, dark room before Sherlock makes a humming noise that John has learned means he’s satisfied, if not happy, with whatever he’s found. Sherlock stands, and the only indication he remembers John is with him is the very slight hesitance as he pauses at the door, not quite waiting for John to catch up.
It was late enough in the afternoon that the line was only slightly more than a handful of people deep by the time they made it to the resident Starbucks. Sherlock minded this Starbucks slightly less than the rest throughout the city. It still had the slouchy chairs, tacky décor, and horribly annoying soundtracks; but the baristas were efficient and their chatter was slightly less inane than elsewhere.
He heard a soft ‘Ta’ and looked up quizzically to meet the eyes of the barista who’d taken his order and handed him his drink. Sherlock gave him an odd look before continuing his conversation with Lestrade and striding off.
John was sitting at the desk in his small office at the clinic, thumbing a text response to Sherlock as he ate a quick lunch between patients (leftover Thai appetizers and crisps—not his healthiest choice ever he’d admit). The date on his phone caught his eye for the second time that day—December 1
John was still cane less—a feat that was making him feel more and more acclimated and upbeat each day. He made his way towards the tube and to the Baker St exit with an efficiency he’d thought he might never find again. After a brief knock, the landlady, Mrs. Hudson, let him in. He made his way quickly up the stairs, more excited about what lay ahead than he’d realized. He knocked gently on the half open door and poked his head in as he started to enter.
Less than fifteen minutes later John is grabbing a muffin and a tea from Speedy’s as Sherlock hales a cab outside. The drive to SIS isn’t as long as John would like, still attempting to both wake himself up and calm his nerves by ingesting too hot of tea in large gulps.
They sat in silence the entire ride back to his bedsit. When the cars stopped he didn’t get out, confused and waiting for either information or instruction. When it was obvious that her eyes were not leaving her phone, John coughed loudly.
John spent the next three hours reading and signing papers, feeling as if he’d just signed his life away even more than we’d he’d joined the bloody army.
The Thai place was good, as always. John ordered Pad See Eu, spring rolls, and dumplings. Sherlock ordered his usual Pad Thai and stole bites of John’s extras.  The conversation came easier than either of them could have imagined. Sherlock was used to feeling unsure around others–social conventions usually either escaped him or he just felt no need to lower himself to worry about them. Something about John though made him want to try.
John stares at him for a moment. He knows he’s been complimented, if in a completely odd way, but he isn’t sure what to do with it.
John watches as he heads over to his coat and checks the pockets. He pulls an envelope out of the inside breast pocket. His eyes light up slightly as he pulls the tickets out.
“Always so aggressive. Did it never occur to you that you and I belong on the same side?” Mycroft said in response to Sherlock’s extended step even further into his space.
“Cold case, a few years back, reminds me of this one. They may have been amateurs back then, there might have been mistakes. Pictures could be important.”
John started and his hands fumbled a bit trying to get a grasp on the phone in order to reply. He resolutely did not look at Anthea whom he was sure could have typed six texts in the time it took him to fumble with his phone. It chimed again before he could even start to tap away.
“Dr. Watson,” the smooth tones of Mycroft’s pervading voice greets John as soon as he’s accepted the call.
“Of course not, but I can hardly go around not calling her anything, so it works as best as it can. I took to calling her other things for a while; but she is trained in almost as many martial arts as true SIS members, and is infinitely more annoying and persistent, so I gave up.”
Sherlock stared at him from his almost upside down position on the couch, “Brother.” He said calmly as his mind worked to name the five closest shops that sold cigarettes.
John, like any good British male, knew how to make a perfect cup of tea with his personal kettle. But, he soon learned that tea and coffee from a Starbucks were a whole different level of beverages. Overwhelmed was an understatement after his first day. His trainers made slight accommodations for his limp (his cane not feasible behind the counter with all the gadgets), but it was still awkward getting used to faltering around behind the counter. He’d been an experienced and highly trained military doctor and to suddenly be a trainee was hard to get used to.
“Oh God, yes,” John practically whispered. SIS provided some excitement, but nothing like what the war used to bring. It didn’t matter that he wasn’t sure this man was particularly sane or safe, that he had no idea where they were going or what they were doing, or whether he should even be around him. It was better than sitting alone in his tiny bedsit and simply waiting for the next day.
With that, he and Anthea disappeared once again into the car, leaving Sherlock and John standing on the pavement.
“I’m not even going to ask how you know about any of those, most especially Dresden,” Mycroft bites out as he waves a hand at Anthea, who steps forward with a stack of file folders. “But if I find you’ve been mucking about with clearance outside of this building, they’ll be an inquiry; I’ll make sure of it.” Sherlock’s smile just widens as he swipes the folders out of Anthea’s hand and spins towards the door, coat flapping behind him.
Sherlock weaves past Major Smith’s office and beckons him without breaking stride as he continues on to Mycroft’s, growing antsier and more upset with each step.
“Ugh, Sherlock. That image may never leave my mind again and you may have effectively turned me off sex. And, no, you finally responding to your brother does not ‘turn me on’. Though you listening to me does wonders for my ego. Mostly it’s you flouncing about half dressed with sex hair that is doing the turning me on.”
“Wait, what?” John asked to Sherlock’s back; the detective had already moved to grab his coat off the hook. But John had begun to move as well, already stood up, excited and hopeful at this turn of events.
pathetic, the pair of them, dancing around this for so very long. That was twice now they’d snogged each other senseless and they’d still had yet to have a real conversation pertaining to it. John was turning it over in his head as he walked through the kitchen door and Sherlock’s sudden appearance and voice startled him.
An hour later, and John hobbled off a crime scene in Brixton, alone, and torn between confused and dejected. It’d been amazing to see Sherlock at work. Sure, he’d seen him deduce things about John that had left him astounded, but this was even more fascinating, a completely different level. He’d picked handfuls of small details off the body and turned them into clues. Hair style, clothing color, jewelry, coat…the swirl of data had been incredible. Sherlock was practically his own tropical storm.
Typically, John liked to lose himself in the holidays, swept up into good cheer, festive jumpers, and presents. It’d always been a time when he could ignore the bad things happening around him and simply partake in the joy. Sherlock was the antithesis to all of that however, and that made John slightly wary. John wondered if Sherlock would be okay having a party in the flat. John wondered if Sherlock would leave to spend time with his family for the holiday. John wondered if they should exchange gifts. John wondered if he should invite Harry over. John spent a lot of time wondering these days.
“I could only hope so,” Sherlock says, surprisingly subdued, before tugging him softly into the bedroom and onto the bed.
The moment his bedroom door had slammed behind him last night he’d stalked over to his small, personal desk and had begun to organize. Papers, experiments, pens; anything he could find was meticulously dealt with. Sherlock didn’t like cleaning, but his mind needed something to do and there was little else in this small enclosure.  He attended to them with a force and vigor that would have surprised anyone. But he refused to deal with anything else, shutting it up and locking it away in the recesses of his mind palace. His brain was still aware of the noises in the flat, and he tracked John as he sat outside his room, left, and came back. He heard him call about dinner, but ignored him. Some might have called it a sulk, but Sherlock preferred to see it as a tactical retreat.
“Ugh, Mycroft,” he exhales as he tosses the phone across the room onto the sofa. It rings twice more as it sits on the cushions. John is pulling his out of his picket before it even begins to ring, knowing the drill by now.
“Not a thing,” the man replied with a small smirk. “Your service records were impressive, impeccable one might say. The job you would be working would require security level clearance not too far above what you’d previously been granted and an understanding of why secrecy can be necessary. As well as the ability to be around people.”
Thank you everyone for sticking with me (and probably having to re-read the first 5 chapters). I honestly hadn’t realized it had been so long since I updated. Life kind of attacked me (full time single parent, full time job, full time back to school, plus, life in general) and this story was in the back of my mind the whole time, but I just kept putting it off. It is finally here though. I’m not sure this is the end of this series completely, but this part at least has come to its conclusion.
“You do realize that ignoring him is just going to make him show up here,” John tries, a last ditch effort to reason with
He steps just to the side, touches Sherlock’s shoulder. He’s met with Sherlock’s entire body tensing and almost recoiling away before his eyes, grey and pale in an almost translucent way as he loses himself inside his mind, focus on him. Three blinks later and the fog seems to clear.
“You do hire idiots,” he states before pivoting sharply and heading the office door. He hears both Mycroft and Major Smith following behind him, but pays them no mind as he heads off to find John.
“Jesus!” John had exclaimed, glancing around furtively. He was pretty sure he was not supposed to see whatever that was, despite whatever meager security clearance he’d been granted.
John was tired; it was after midnight and he was still adapting to the slightly random schedule they’d been keeping. He drained the rest of the tea and stood up from his chair.
“Tox reports,” Sherlock says to Major Smith as soon as they’re both through the office door. Mycroft stands abruptly.
“Not that much,” the man had said vaguely as he turned away. John’s eyes narrowed but Sherlock reached out for his wrist before he could press the issue.
They took a cab back to Baker Street, Sherlock having told Lestrade he’d gotten all he could from the scene and needed to think.
The car pulls onto Baker Street just as Sherlock is glancing out the window for the fifth time. John has just barely had time to pack a bag, relieve himself, and grab his gun. Mycroft, or Anthea more likely, is efficient if nothing else. And John really doesn’t like to think of the everything else.
It’s his luck that the woman who answered sounded a bit desperate, and she asked if he could come in today for an interview.
“We’d love that, Mrs. H.,” John responds, just as Sherlock had opened his mouth with his own retort. John elbows him. “I don’t have any, got rid of them all when I joined the army, and quite sure Sherlock here has never considered them.” The look on Sherlock’s face affirms John‘s statement, takes it a step further even as to why he would ever consider them. That he doesn’t rattle that off to Mrs. Hudson is practically a Christmas miracle unto itself. Or possibly the gentle reminder of John’s elbow against his sternum, one could never quite tell with Sherlock.
And with every case and every day that passed them by, they settled themselves more and more into a routine that John was beginning to feel would be near impossible to dig themselves out of, a routine of evasion and perceived normalcy. They shared cabs together, they ordered food together, and ate both in restaurants and at home almost always just the two of them. John may have been going to work three to four times a week, but it seemed, amazingly, to not decrease the amount of time they spent in each other’s presence. It both enraged and encouraged him. But they seemed unable to move beyond and John couldn’t find the words, or the nerve, to start the conversation.
“Grande Cinnamon Dolce latte with caramel and 4 shots,” Sherlock said, hardly breaking steam on his conversation, and not looking up as he handed over the notes and walked along, well used to the system and efficiency here.
“Oh, this is just Yard stuff, not SIS, no one around here could care less about this man I assure you. And, please, ‘doctor’ is written all over you. Quite literally in fact,” he added with a smirk and a nod towards John’s uniform.
Muttering to himself as he wandered the halls towards his makeshift office, Sherlock reviewed his options. Yes, his apartment on Montague Street was a disaster, but it was cheap and had fit his needs at present. Perhaps that was no longer the case though. A small rare smile graced his lips as he recalled the offer Mrs. Hudson had made some time ago about a flat she might have available. He’d stop round that afternoon he decided. She’d probably have some biscuits and tea available as well, he decided with another small quirk of his lips. After searching three of his hiding places in his desk, he managed to find a half empty packet of cigarettes he’d left there at some point. He tucked them into the inside pocket of his coat and headed out.
“Okay,” John responded feebly, but he was already talking to empty air as Sherlock had so quickly spun around and huffed out the door.
Sherlock had begun to remove his gloves, pulling them off slowly as words began to tumble out of his mouth. “Anthea may have enlightened me to the fact that, despite our “somewhat surprising success after we finally took our heads out of our asses” as she so wonderfully puts it, we have not actually participated in the traditional “first date” model, nor any kind of actual date in fact.”
John looked at him askance, eyes pulling up his body slowly, for a moment before it sunk in. “Assistant?” He replied indignantly, trying to hold back his anger.
John, unsure of what to say, but ready to defend himself, opened his mouth to talk when he was cut off by Sherlock.
“Not that I actually want to know,” he had hastened to add on. “Bloody hell. But, you’re good for him, you know? He isn’t quite as… as fractious as he used to be.”
The case itself, a break-in where nothing was stolen and the entry route was a complete mystery, has John confused but Sherlock practically humming in glee. The yellow characters spray painted on the wall meant nothing to John, but Sherlock had all but danced around as he dug for information on the trading floor and his phone simultaneously. Once more before having left, John was surprised, this time by the check Sebastian handed him that Sherlock all of ignored. John wasn’t about to turn it down though, not with that many digits on it and all of the awkwardness between them that had stemmed from his decision to get a job.
“Grande Cinnamon Dolce latte with caramel and 4 shots,” Sherlock relayed when it was his turn, laying down notes without breaking in his conversation.
“We’ll be in touch,” he adds with a flourish as he exists. John nods his head at the three occupants of the room and follows suit, if less dramatically.
“Hello, Dr. Watson. Thank you for joining us. Please, take a seat.” The voice seemed to come from nowhere until a man materialized in the corner. He wore a perfectly put together three-piece suit and carried an umbrella, despite being both indoors and that London was going through an uncharacteristically dry spell of weather.
Sherlock simply shakes his head in response as he heads for the back entrance and digs in his pocket. John rolls his eyes when he pulls one of Lestrade’s badges from an interior pocket and waves it over the reader.
“Mr. Wilson stated he worked for ‘The Red-Headed League’ from nine to twelve every day. We’ll meet here tomorrow at nine thirty. I’d better text Lestrade.”
It is after they visit the site in Lisbon, sun shining high in the east, that John makes the connection. It hadn’t clicked when they were in Monaco or Dresden, or even when looking at the maps of all the sites, including Cardiff, where the agents were both found and/or reported out of. But a Starbucks in Lisbon was slightly more conspicuous than in Cardiff, at least to him.
He’d stood up and nodded briefly to Mycroft before he hurried after Anthea, more than happy to exit the situation and the building.
It is after the fourth time that John cannot help himself. “What are you?” John asked, not quite a whisper, not quite reverence, as he handed the always constant drink order to him. And the grammar of it seemed wrong, yet John didn’t know how else he would, could, have asked it.
Sherlock looks from his cup to John’s face with a look in his eye that makes John feel like either a very interesting puzzle or a particularly shocking crime scene. He can never quite decide if it is a good feeling when Sherlock looks at him like that or not. But Sherlock is suddenly kissing him and texting at the same time, smile wide. John decides it must be an okay look.
Thursday bled into Friday for John as he continued to slowly acclimate himself to his new schedule. He spent Friday shadowing Sal and Sparks, another barista that was part of their now eight person team. It was another long day—both weary and strangely satisfying. John had been afraid that seeing all the active agents might make him miss the military even more, but so far he’d only felt a vague sense of gratitude towards them and one of accomplishment towards himself.
“I think you are the only one in this building who holds that opinion, possibly in the entire Commonwealth” Sherlock added with a pointed glance around the room.
They’re back home before it is fully evening, stuffed full of turkey, mince meat pies, sweet potatoes, creamed corn, fruit, rolls, and pies. He’d dozed against Sherlock’s shoulder on the car ride home. Now John is puttering around, attempting to clear space for the espresso machine. It isn’t large, but space is at a premium between actual kitchen appliances and Sherlock’s mess of experiments and case notes.
They’d only been part way through their salads, but all the way through the bottle of wine, when said sous chef had realized Sherlock Holmes was in his restaurant.
“Excellent question, John!” Sherlock exclaims as he grabs the file he’d just set down as well as his latte and hustles out the door.
John is reading the case files, hunting for small details that could mean something. Sherlock’s been through most of them already, and John doesn’t have near his skill level, but he has learned enough of Sherlock and his methods to be able to highlight suspicious or odd statements. Sometimes he dislikes being relegated to research monkey, but the cases are often interesting and he always feels a spike of pride and adrenaline when he can pinpoint something based on medicine or trauma knowledge. Sherlock is pacing in front of the sofa and John knows enough to realize he won’t be sleeping tonight. He finishes up the file he’s on and hauls himself off to bed alone.
“Hungry?” Sherlock asked as soon as the man was gone. “We need to check on a few leads and Mr. Wilson’s office is right by this nice little Thai place I like.” John nodded in reply, still somewhat lost on what exactly was going on.
Suddenly, in a movement so quick, John barely had time to register it, Sherlock had him pinned against the counter, arms braced to either side of him, tea cup still in hand. John could hardly breathe as his body responded, filled with tremors, anticipation, and excitement.
Mycroft sighs as he unlocks a bottom drawer and hands over 7 green marked files. Sherlock practically lunges at them and scans through each one quickly.
“Well that was boring,” Sherlock intones as they leave the scene a few hours later, climbing into a cab.
John stared for a moment. “Starbucks?” He asked, incredulously. “Security clearance to work at a Starbucks? I don’t know whether to laugh or be offended.” He started to stand, but the man beat him to it.
“Boring?” John asks. “Three parents all stealing the same toy from each other in attempt to have the best present under the tree, two of them ending up dead?”
“Good morning,” he said cheerfully to the seemingly ubiquitous Anthea and her equally ubiquitous phone. She merely exhaled in reply.
“Afghanistan.” John finally answered after a beat. The man hummed; just a slight noise, but one that seemed to have said, ‘I thought so’.
John stood for a moment, thinking of his bank balance, his nightmares, the beige-ness of the bedsit, and the gun tucked away in his drawer.
“Of course he’s my brother. What else could he possibly be?” Sherlock added snidely with a glance thrown towards Mycroft.
Schooling his face, Sherlock looks at the floor before returning his eyes to John. “You’re like espresso to me, my dear Watson. Hot, addicting, energizing, sustaining.”
Sherlock’s eyes twitch from the paper in his hand to the wall and back again several times before landing on John. He can almost see Sherlock analyze his stance, the set of his shoulders, before he sighs and pins the paper back up haphazardly.
“Half the reason.” John said with a shrug as he brushed a tender kiss against Sherlock’s now exposed neck on his way to the kettle.
Sherlock was distracted and he despised that. Normally able to completely switch his brain to and from what he wanted to concentrate on, to the exclusion of all else, the fact that he now couldn’t was making him agitated. The case, an 8 at least, should have been commanding the entirety of his attention. It was what he did—zeroed his mind in on something and solved it. Instead, his mind was wandering and wondering as he too stalked the streets of London, restless and roving.
“Boring and adrenaline rush? That go together well?” Ducky asks as she hits the buttons on the register.
Snogging the heck out of Sherlock and sharing the best mutual hand job of John’s life hadn’t seemed to actually solve any of John’s problems—in fact, it seemed to only make them worse. Whatever he’d been feeling before was now exponentially worse and also laid frighteningly bare. Every second of their time together John was painfully aware of Sherlock—aware of his presence, his movements, his possibly conceived thoughts and feelings. John wasn’t prepared to hold on much longer. He may have been trained in the art of war, but not in the art of love.
John nodded. “Okay. But you have to text Lestrade, okay?” Sherlock looked like he was going to argue, or pout, but in the end he nodded. As John returned back down the stairs Sherlock was just returning his phone to his pocket. John raised a questioning eyebrow and Sherlock nodded grudgingly.
The odd look that Sherlock threw him maybe shouldn’t have surprised him; it really was a lame question.
“Our job is to serve coffee and to serve it well. Like most Starbucks baristas, we’re to provide beverages with a side of happy and comforting as a break in our customer’s day. Unlike most though, we do not ask for names, we do not ask or provide personal details, and we do not use loyalty cards or bank cards—cash only. Also, your phone is not allowed on the premises. If you stick to these rules, you’ll do well here. Most people don’t know it, since most people don’t know we exist, but we’re the busiest Starbucks in the nation, and the best paid baristas as well. It can be a great place to be in if you stick it out; I heard you were personally recruited though, so I’m sure you’ll do fine.”
He’d left Sherlock just before noon, stretched out on the couch in his thinking pose. He worked his five hours at the surgery and came home; left and brought back Chinese. Which Sherlock ignored right along with him. He’d gone out for a beer and come back, still no response. It is after midnight now, and John isn’t sure if Sherlock slept yesterday or not.
“Dull. Dull. Dull. What is it, John, with people and their presents? This is our second case in as many weeks centering on presents.”
“I press the issue only because the two of you seem quite incapable of… well of anything, honestly,” Mycroft added almost absentmindedly. John tried not to stare at him, but it was hard to resist. Was Mycroft actually being encouraging? Or at least his version of it?
Two and a half weeks later, after tying up a case with Scotland Yard (it was the brother, honestly, how anyone missed the green ladder connection was beyond him), Sherlock was in the midst of moving his things to Baker Street. Mycroft’s minions not only returned his microscope freshly polished and with new slides and bulbs, but also moved the majority of his affects, and delivered a new set of furniture. Sherlock knew that meant his brother wanted something from him, a consult at the very least, but he was almost too happy with his new accommodations to much care. Placing his skull on the mantle was the last piece to settling in, and Sherlock looked around with a sense of accomplishment. He sent a text to Lestrade about a cold case he’d been contemplating and busied himself setting up a new experiment.
John thought about hissing back angrily, he really did. But he figured there was no point in it. A moment of panic passed though and it turned out he couldn’t quite let it go.
The plane lands outside of London almost 17 full hours after they’d taken off; John dead on his feet as he shuffles onto the tarmac, having just awoken when the wheels touched down. Sherlock doesn’t allow them a moment’s more rest though, as he herds John into the waiting car.
“Well I just want you to know we’re all very happy that you’re here. We’re happy enough for you and Sherlock in general, everyone knows we weren’t sure he’d ever find someone who would put up with him, bless his odd little heart. But we’re even more tickled that you came up with him. Not always easy to walk into the lion’s den, eh?”
“The mouth and the area around it. See that coloring? Stab wound located there and that serious, would have bled out in less than a minute. Not enough time for cyanosis due to lack of oxygen. There are these strange marks near the bottom of her ears as well–almost look like marks from a strap or a tie of some kind. The wound was definitely sustained while she was still alive, but just barely I’d guess. The wound is fairly straight, no wiggling, so she wasn’t moving when it happened. Though, by the looks of her wrist, she may have been bound as well.”
Despite knowing he was not being picked up until 08:00, John awoke with near military precision almost two full hours before that. Not quite sure what to expect, he washed, dressed, and prepared for the day carefully. He’d been given a uniform, a full ensemble really, by the head barista at the shop he’d trained at and had washed it in preparation for today. However, the SIS location must have had other ideas as a small brown paper package sat on his table when he went to switch on the kettle.
“I can't make you one of those fancy peppermint lattes you like this time of year but did the best I could. It
He was about to grab his drink from the barista when suddenly a connection came to him. He froze, searching his mind palace quickly for something he knew was stored there.
Finally, on the third day after ‘the incident’ as it had been labeled in John’s mind, Sherlock stalked suddenly out of his room and towards John, who was sat on the couch, eating toast and half-watching the morning news on the telly.
Finally, right on the dot Tuesday morning, yet another black car pulled up in front of his building, and he shuffled in to head off to another full week. Somewhat surprisingly, John thought, he was enjoying the work. It wasn’t quite as mind-numbing as he’d been afraid that it would be. There were always at least two of them working and a steady stream of people queuing up, so there was always chatter of some kind or another. It wasn’t always hectic, and there were plenty of small tasks to keep him busy during the slower times—cleaning, stocking, and refilling. Slowly his leg was becoming used to the near constant standing. He still used the cane as much as he could, but often behind the counter he could stay in almost the same spot so it wasn’t always necessary.
“Boring.” He would simply state when John asked. Or, John’s favorite, “Trivialities. I haven’t time for them. This,” he would continue, tapping his head, “is my hard drive, and it only makes sense to put things in there that are useful ... really useful. Ordinary people fill their heads with all kinds of rubbish, and that makes it hard to get at the stuff that matters. Do you see? Why should I waste my time on anything that isn’t important?” John had heard that speech three times already. Three.
The package isn’t overly large, but it is noticeable. John knew a simple wrapping job would be over too quickly for Sherlock, so he’d made a game out of it.
The sergeant at the scene had been less than helpful when John had asked after a cab, so he slowly made his way out to the main road. Less than a minute later he heard the sound of a slowing engine as it pulled up next to him. The back door of a ubiquitous black sedan opened and Anthea stepped out.
Instead, the next thing John remembered was groggily coming to, tied to a chair and facing an arrow. He was obviously in an underground tunnel, perhaps the very ones he and Sherlock had traversed the days before, but outside of that John can't seem to place what is going on. The Chinese acrobats from the circus pop out of the woodwork and the pulley system facing John is nearly identical to the one he'd seen this evening already. That gave him more than enough clues to know he didn’t want to be here.
Sherlock doesn’t respond, and neither John nor Anthea really expected him to; but John has seen the slight tightening in his shoulders and knows he’ll comply. He exchanges a quick nod with Anthea, letting her know he’s vouching, before he, too, turns to face the window.
Mycroft pointedly looked around the flat before standing up. “I’ll see you in the office by Friday at the latest, is that clear, Sherlock?”
“Well hello, brother mine.” Mycroft responded coolly. “Can’t you have Anthea schedule your tantrum in later, the grownups are talking now.”
“That’s it! John, let’s go!” He yelled. They both grabbed their coat when Sherlock suddenly turned again.
“Until other arrangements are made, you will be escorted to and from work by an assigned driver and myself or a fellow colleague. We will pick you up each morning at 08:00 and return you each evening at 18:00. As I’ve been informed, your work days will be Tuesday thru Saturday.”
“I hope this wasn’t too odd for you, we always eat about this time. The husband and I always go into town for the Christmas Panto they hold this evening, so we like to be done in time to make an event out of it.”
“Mycroft says I’m to congratulate you. There are wine and flowers en route to Baker Street,” she says, eyes never leaving her phone. John splutters slightly.
“I’m packing a bag. Grab anything necessary that you want. And I do mean necessary,” John calls over his shoulder as he pounds up the stairs, knowing already that the detritus he’ll find in Sherlock’s case is unavoidable.
He crouched down and attempted to survey the damage. John’s suit was ruined. Sherlock’s right arm was bleeding and John couldn’t tell how bad it was, other than that Sherlock was criticizing the man and the case rather than the quiet that usually overtakes him if he’s actually hurt. John had a scrape across his left cheek from where a small piece of the bottle grazed him. Said bottle of wine, their second, not yet opened, was on the floor in pieces, where it’d rolled after cracking over the head of their suspect. The burgundy of the wine blended in odd patterns with the blood splatters. John had been unable to tear his eyes away once they’d settled on it. He eyed it once more as he stood; once the ambulance was here and he could breathe just a slight bit easier.
He hates to admit he is a bit surprised by what is there. The estate, while large, is rambling and homey rather than stuffy. It reminds John slightly of their flat at Baker Street and he smiles to himself when he realizes that Sherlock’s messiness and unique decorating manner must be an inherited trait. In similar vein, their parents are warm and open and they tut over John and Anthea, who is apparently staying as well, though also apparently already known to both Mr. and Mrs. Holmes. John feels immediately welcome and at home.
“I could use an assistant,” Sherlock spoke suddenly as he leaned against the side of the building, all tight lines and expensive clothes.
Standing on the edge of Waterloo Bridge staring out over the Thames, with one last sigh, Sherlock looked around at the city that he loved before hailing a taxi and heading home.
Lestrade attempted to lecture them on conduct once they’d stood up and released the man, bruised but alive, but they were both giggling and already turning from the crime scene.
But, really, that would only cause it to blow up that much worse when it came to head–which it undoubtedly would.
I have no excuse for my complete lack of updates outside of the fact that life sometimes gets in the way of itself. :) Forgive my tardiness and I'll try to do better as this story wraps up in the next few chapters.
It had been almost two weeks since John had moved into 221B. The move itself had been short and relatively uneventful. While he owned a bit more things than he had when he was first home, it still all fit nicely into only a handful of boxes and two suitcases and took only one trip in an Anthea-provided car to bring it from the bedsit to Baker Street. It had been rather anti-climactic all around.
Well not anymore. He’d invaded Afghanistan, for Christ’s sake. And moved in with Sherlock Holmes. He wasn’t sure anything could stop him anymore.
And Mycroft was either more of a softy than he’d realized, or Anthea was a genius; but she was waiting for him outside a car when he stepped out of the building.
“That you are more than a barista, more than coffee. That I said danger and you came running. My mind lights up when you’re around. Can you imagine what we could be together? We’d be unstoppable,” and he deliberately lowered his voice on the last sentence. It was heady to hear those words, breathed out in rich tones so close to his ear and John didn’t think anyone in the world could have resisted the situation. And so he gave in.
“No patience for the weary, eh?” John mutters with a sigh as he grabs their bag and prepares to throw it in a trunk of yet another ubiquitous black car. They speed through the small, winding country roads and John is glad it is too dark out for him to watch out the window, not wanting to know how fast they’re passing over curves and ledges.
Mycroft raised one elegant eyebrow at him in an obvious mock. He did, however, nod succinctly and signal to Anthea, who stood abruptly and walked away.
‘The victim’s shoes were not hers. They were hastily placed on her feet and the wear on them did not match her arch. Find their owner and you’ll find where the suspect frequented. SH    ’
A case comes up on the twentieth. John’s been to the shops, has all his presents bought and wrapped. Despite how hard it was to find something for Sherlock, he’s glad for it now as they sleep little over the next handful of days. Three different robberies throughout London, not usually Lestrade’s division, but the oddity of it, and the random and unexplained death of one of the robbers at the third scene, means it is dropped on his desk. He calls Sherlock not minutes later. Everyone at the Yard wants this wrapped up quickly and done with before Christmas, so even Sally barely makes a comment when they step on the scene.
Major Smith comes out of seemingly nowhere and approaches them just as they start towards the counter and Sherlock veers his course, already off on a tangent about the case details before the Major is even within proper hearing distance.
“I’m not eating,” Sherlock says to him before he even fully enters the room. John stops the moment he can see him and stares.
The next day, they need information from Major Smith again. Sherlock wakes John up as the sun is just peeking over the horizon amid a flurry of words and hand gestures that have him stumbling, practically falling, out of bed in confusion and shock. Some day he is going to be used to being pulled out of bed at all hours, but that day is not today. He’s supposed to be on at the surgery this afternoon, and he reminds Sherlock of this, but simply gets a disinterested wave in response.
“Just about,” Sherlock replied with a mysterious smile. A smile that did funny things to John and his ability to concentrate. He decided he might like that smile even more than the other one he’d been trying to induce. John must stare a moment too long as Sherlock nudged him along suddenly.
Somehow it turned out that the sous chef was involved in Sherlock’s current case; which hadn’t been solved by this morning like promised and had turned out to be more than the simple smuggling Lestrade had thought. John wasn’t sure if Sherlock had known or not, the coincidence seemed too handy, but he’d suggested this yesterday and had seemed genuinely bored of the simple case at that point.
Sherlock himself had straightened to his full height and stepped closer to Mycroft. “Keep your oversized nose out of my business, Mycroft.” He snarled.
“Connections, John. We need connections.” He takes a gulp of his coffee, making a small face as he swallows the hot liquid quickly, before shuffling folders and papers dramatically on the desk.
“Seriously though, Doc, one day you were here and the next you weren’t. And you were a good employee so we don’t think you got yourself canned.”
“And you invaded Afghanistan,” Sherlock responded with yet another small smile. John was starting to feel proud each time he made one of those appear.
John doesn’t reply to either of them–too shocked mostly. Sherlock doesn’t seem to notice his lack of responses though; the questions just keep coming until Sherlock’s voice eventually fades to quiet. They’d circled Regent’s Park twice before taking a sharp turn and suddenly John realizes they’re headed for NSY.
The thought of his leg made him notice that he didn’t have his cane and it seemed to break the spell and he suddenly faltered. Sherlock seemed to reach out a proprietary arm, but John regained himself.
“The plane is slated to leave in thirty minutes. The pilot has instructions to take you to a secure landing just outside of Monaco and wait. An agent will meet you there and take you to the scene. Depending on what you find there, and Mycroft is trusting you on this one Sherlock,” she adds sharply, “the pilot has permission to take you to Lisbon, Dresden, and Cardiff. However, with utmost care and discretion. They already know we’re looking into it, but the less we can advertise, the better for you two to work, and for the safety of all of our remaining agents.”
It all blurred together into an incomprehensible picture that left John only more bewildered and intrigued. John knew he shouldn’t have, knew he shouldn’t even know his name. This Sherlock apparently may not actually be an official SIS employee but John was pretty sure it still violated practically every document that he had signed prior to employment. For some reason it didn’t seem to be enough to make him want to stop though.
“Sherlock? I’m going to head up to bed, you coming?” He tries the casual approach first. Sherlock grunts in response, remaining as-is, standing still in front of his working wall, now covered in pinned up pictures and case files relating to the murders.
Ducky is about to tease him more, he can just tell, when her face blanks slightly and she stands up just a bit straighter behind the espresso machine. John looks over his shoulder to see Sherlock, Mycroft, and Major Smith headed towards them. Sherlock’s smile widens when he catches sight of John.
“Don’t show me stuff like that around here, I’ll probably get fired. And how do you know I’m a doctor?” John hissed out.
“You two are too nosy and living way too vicariously through me.” John responds with a smile. “And you both also know that I can’t tell you much; I’m here, that should tell you enough about what he’s working on to know its seriously under wraps. I do have a couple of questions for you though, Sal.”
John hesitated for only a moment before sitting on the chair on the side of the table closest to him. The man sat down only after John had.
Ten minutes later, John has finished his toast and is just contemplating between a shower and laying out on the couch for a bit, when Sherlock stands up.
Sherlock had offered to simply sign his name to the gifts he had, but John wanted to do something little of his own, so had small ones for Anthea, Mycroft, and both Mr. and Mrs. Holmes. He’d been surprised actually that Sherlock even bothered with gifts, but he’d waved his hand nonchalantly and said he always stole Anthea away for a few hours and had her do it for him.
Sherlock purposefully did not show his face at SIS on Thursday, if only to spite Mycroft. He didn’t ignore the case though; reading and researching from his newly acquired couch in his newly acquired flat had its own nice ring to it for now. Kidnapping and espionage—most of Mycroft’s cases were the same. And while generally a slightly higher caliber than the personal or police cases he received, they often were all spurred by the same thing—perceived civic loyalty. An utterly boring motive, in Sherlock’s opinion.
“I find you are not taking your duties as seriously as you should,” Mycroft added on, stretching himself taller.
Overall, when John left for the day, he was content. His purpose in getting a job had not been, as Sherlock had apparently thought, to distance himself from the detective. The idea of some space was not a bad thing, but John wanted to feel needed–it was what he was best at. And medicine was what made him do that. And he had loved helping Sherlock on his cases, and God, he hoped he would still be allowed; because he felt so alive during those times and Sherlock was incandescent. John didn’t want those times to end. But, he was a doctor, and he wanted to be a doctor, and he loved being a doctor. Locum work seemed to be the best solution as it left him generally available to Sherlock and his whims. He just needed to get Sherlock to see that, to understand that. And for them to maybe talk about the other thing between them, the other elephant in the room.
Sherlock’s phone dings again just as he turns and wraps his arms around John. “I’ve agreed to assist him, but what do you say we make him wait a bit longer?” He asks with a smirk as he leads John towards the bedroom.
The man chuckled slightly. “You’ll get used to it. One of the rules around here is no names. You can call me Sal,” he added, pointing to the stitched on name on his shirt. “We’ll spend the morning briefing and then I’ll take you in and we’ll have you shadow the afternoon shift. Sound okay?”
“Yeah, well, he wanted to have a little ‘talk’. Hard to say no when the car follows you for a few blocks and everyone is staring at you.”
They’re on the curb outside the entrance to SIS not even 10 minutes later, despite what should have been mid-day traffic. John’s latte is gone but he’s not feeling any more awake than he did before it, and the yawn overtakes him before he can attempt to hide it. It’s noticeable enough to draw Sherlock’s attention, and John is expecting some type of diatribe thrown his way, but the glance is all that comes before a brief hand at the small of his back nudges him forward.
“You find what you need in those reports?” John asks, already knowing the answer, Sherlock’s smile just this side of smug. He hands the highly caffeinated drink to him as he approaches and takes a sip from his own.
In the end he nodded, unable to think of a convincing enough argument. He took the small business card with an address and a time written on it, and slowly headed out, even though their time wasn’t up yet for the day. Ella seemed almost over the moon with his small acceptance of the card and let him go early with a slight wave.
. It was creeping into the Christmas season. That thought, and the thought of the impending New Year, made John pause for a moment and sum up his life over the last few months. His life since meeting Sherlock. Some days it still amazed him how much had actually changed since that day he’d left his bedsit to meet Mycroft Holmes for an interview. There’d been a few ups and downs, but overall John wouldn’t trade it for the world. He’d been so lost, so alone, and Sherlock had fixed all of that. He owed him so much and John wanted to show him that.
“Right,” she began, still typing away. “We’ll be back here at 08:00 tomorrow to pick you up. Prepare yourself. Your first week’s wages will be in your account Friday morning. If you make it until next Friday there will be a bonus as well. Sleep well, Dr. Watson, you’ll need it,” she said crisply as she looked up at him and almost smiled. John nodded at her and climbed out, trying to decide if tomorrow would be more or less daunting than Afghanistan.
Mycroft may have been aiming for pompous, but he realized his mistake a moment later as Sherlock’s calculating stare took on a more vengeful look and he turned his gaze from Mycroft and swept the rest of the room. Sherlock’s voice cut off any recant Mycroft was formulating.
“I’m going to go and get the full tox reports from Major Smith, not just the garbage summary Mycroft’s minions gave me. You go talk to your former colleagues, see what insight or knowledge they might hold. Sal in particular, he’s been here a while.”
John tried not to scream, he really did. But when faced with the sudden close and physical presence of the peculiar man he’d been serving coffee to, in the small enclosed area of the back seat of a standard issue assassin car, he was feeling a bit overwhelmed.
He glanced at Sherlock’s door, still firmly shut, before he reached for the package and tore the paper off. It was a small box of business cards. He opened them. The cards inside were plain but elegant. And John had clearly misread the situation, or Sherlock, or possibly both.
Both SIS and DGSE had already sent their initial medics and agents, but both Sherlock and John do a quick but thorough run through of the body, everyone involved wanting to speed up the release of the remains as much as possible. It is one of the worst scenes that John’s been at with Sherlock, and it is only through sheer willpower that he doesn’t lose his stomach. His medical expertise is hardly needed, the amount of blood on the floor makes the cause of death easy to establish. There are small things he notices though, little notes he jots down on his pad. Within ten minutes though, Sherlock has sent off a text for the all clear sign on the body.
him. Sherlock has been ignoring Mycroft for over a day at this point, and John is being driven insane by it. Nothing he has said for the last twenty-four hours seem to have broken through Sherlock’s stubbornness. John thinks most days the only things to break through Sherlock’s self-imposed mind block is a corpse or sex. And John resorts to both of those far often than is possibly healthy.
“You smell like Mycroft,” Sherlock had sneered before seeing the cups and relenting slightly in his glare.
For some reason Lestrade’s words hit home where none of Mycroft’s words or John’s  thoughts quite had. Sherlock was not a people person; no one would have said that about him. He also didn’t suffer idiots, and he often called John one, though sometimes with a small hint of what John hoped was care or indulgence. Therefore, the very fact that he seemed to not only allow John’s presence, but actually welcomed it, was more telling than most people’s words would be. It gave John a new confidence as he mulled that over, watching Sherlock tear the crime scene to pieces, and Anderson with it. Maybe it wasn’t words so much that they needed; though John wasn’t going to let them get away with none—they’d had enough confusion between them already.
“You’re my new hero, Doc!” Sal calls over the whir of the espresso machine. “You’re missing your cane as well I see.”
They were still laughing as they entered through the door of 221B. It was the most alive John had felt his whole life he decided. The adrenaline coursed through his veins and a smile erupted on his face unbidden.
“You’re nutters, the both of you,” John says with a laugh. “I need a Grande Cinnamon Dolce with caramel and four shots and I’ll try the same, but with only the normal two shots.”
“And you wonder why both suicides and domestic murders increase this time of year, John, honestly. It’s that kind of drivel that causes it.”
“Well, not exactly. Santa’s fun if you’re a kid. And Mum tried to make us go to church some when we were small, but it didn’t really stick. Haven’t been in ages. Doesn’t mean I can’t appreciate the season. It’s about friends, and family, and celebrating the goodness. That can be centered on religions if that’s your thing, but it can also just be about being human, about being happy.”
John pauses but Sherlock simply brushes past him and into the office where both Mycroft and, presumably, Major Smith wait for them. Both Major Smith and John salute each other as introductions are done, despite John not being in uniform.
And, so, with much trepidation, John began the slow journey to the address on the card at half two on Thursday. Confused at coming off his tube stop in a dilapidated part of town that seemed to house no offices, he opened the file folder containing his CV and the appointment card stapled inside and was just double checking the address when a black car pulled up in front of him. The door opened and a striking and impeccably dressed young woman, only a few years younger than John himself, stepped out. Her eyes were on her phone but she beckoned towards the open car door. John stopped, unsure of what was going on.
“Case, John.” Sherlock intoned at least four times in the ten minute window, as if John had somehow forgotten.
“Told him where to shove it and walked out. There’s kind of a lot more to it than that, backstory involving his nibs over there but that’s the quick and dirty of it.”
The sky is black as the small plane lands at some undisclosed and falsely innocuous landing strip and seemingly abandoned warehouse. John had nodded off twice on the short flight, less than two hours in the air, and shakes his head sharply trying to clear the fog as they taxi to a stop. There are still papers scattered all over the small table in front of Sherlock’s seat and his hair is even more twisted than usual, evidence of his ongoing thinking and exasperation. John brushes his fingers absently over his shoulder in an attempt at reassurance, though it seems to only irritate him more. He’s stood up abruptly and stalked over to the exit door before Anthea’s even properly unbuckled.
“Simply a perk,” she replied with a raised eyebrow, eyes never leaving whatever she was tapping away at. John laughed quietly in response and her eyes dated quickly to his before returning to their task.
Once John got off work at the clinic, five and a half hours of covering the morning rush, lunch breaks, and the early afternoon rush, he’d headed to the flat to clean up. As promised, there was a delivery in the hall, a garment bag hung over the railing carefully and a stick-it on it with a hand-drawn wink on it. Meaning Anthea had delivered it. John grabbed it on his way up and tried not to goggle at the return address that proclaimed its origin to be closer to Saville Row than he felt comfortable. He showered and shaved before pulling the suit out of its hanging place.
Sherlock seems to have lost his words as he glances up at John, a look of surprise still on his face. It is warring with awe and a hint of what John wants to hope is love. He tears his eyes from John’s and plucks the last piece of paper from atop the container holding fresh lungs and a stomach from a sheep.
The case wasn’t quite as interesting as their first together, but it involved smuggling and a chase around one of the seedier business districts in the city. Sherlock, pacing and muttering, had his epiphany moment inside the warehouse and he’d sprinted out the back entrance, John hot on his heels. They caught the suspect as he was attempting to escape under a chain link fence and tackled him to the ground, threats abounding. John’s limp really was just a distant memory at this point; and he couldn’t be happier about it.
John had even helped on the latest case Sherlock had been recruited for. Just a few days after the move, the Detective Inspector from The Yard, Greg if John had remembered correctly, had stopped by looking for Sherlock’s help. Not ten minutes prior, Sherlock has been complaining about boredom, but he immediately feigned disinterest as the case was explained. John’s eyes had hurt from the effort of not rolling them mercilessly; sometimes Sherlock was like a little kid, or a puppy you had to convince to go outside even though it had to wee.
There was a crash from the kitchen as the man came roaring out and the entire restaurant turned in silent shock. Until a knife came whizzing into the table, imbedding itself perfectly between John and Sherlock; then pandemonium broke out. Sherlock had the table flipped up within seconds and he and John were on the other side. Sherlock’s fingers were flying across the screen of his phone as he looked around.
“If I might offer a bit of advice…?” Mycroft trailed off. John, apparently, was destined to spend this entire interaction with his mouth agape. His eyes darted to Anthea, standing slightly to Mycroft’s right. A smile twitched at her lips, as if she could read John’s incredulous thoughts. John couldn’t fathom Mycroft having any practical experience in this area—in fact the thought mildly terrified him. He coughed.
Sherlock stalks over to grab his beverage, eyes on John. As he reaches to take the outstretched cup from Sal’s hands his eyes dart up and move rapidly between Sal and Ducky. A smirk spreads across his lips.
“Yes. Of course it’s a yes. And for the record,” John had said, “though I am excited about the prospect of an official date with you, I was just fine doing cases with a side of take-away and the couch with you.”
Afraid to actually echo the question, John blinks slowly and tries to bring himself under control, slow his breathing like Ella had taught him what felt like forever ago.
“You’re doing more than anyone else has, that must mean something, especially for him,” Lestrade had said, an odd look on his face.
‘Despite that I have grown fond of you in them—and out of them.’ Sherlock had added to his message in a way that had made John smile and blush while he’d snuck a look at it between patients.
The night was both amazingly successful and an unmitigated disaster John thinks privately to himself. It had all began about three weeks after they’d finally sorted themselves out when Sherlock flounced into the flat one evening.
“Or would you prefer the more colloquial, ‘I just solved a case the British Government was too lazy and incompetent to solve, let’s go have congratulatory sex’?” Sherlock adds on after the pause, causing an immediate hoot from Ducky and a laugh from Sal.
“There are cameras situated throughout 221B Baker Street’s main entrances to ensure the continued safety of my brother.”
It was now or never, and by the following evening, John couldn’t take it anymore. The newest case had just been solved and their heated snog and tumble had been almost two days ago.
Minutes later, John’s mobile vibrated softly as Mycroft continued on his spiel. John had long since stopped listening. He pulled the phone out blatantly and looked at it, a small smile playing on his lips as he read the text.
Ten minutes after he’d heard John head out, ‘to his new job,’ Sherlock snarled in his head, he crept out of the bedroom. The covered plate on the table was met with mixed feelings, but he was hungry enough that he ignored them as he dug in.
“I misunderstood the situation and incorrectly deduced you. We both seem to be a bit confused actually. End of story.” He bit out.
John trudged slowly up the stairs to his bedsit late Friday evening, his leg throbbing. It had been a long hard week of standing, but it was a good ache—one that meant he was getting out and about. He only wished he could convince his body of that. Still, he took three paracetamol, hoping to dull it slightly. He was feeling hungry and didn't think tinned beans were going to cut it tonight. Being that it was his first payday so he decided to treat himself. Grabbing his wallet he headed back out, intent on hitting up his favorite Indian place not too far away. Checking the balance on his account made his eyes boggle slightly. Sal was right; they must be the best paid baristas in the nation. He wasn't going to become rich off of it, but it’d be steadier income that he’d hoped for when he initially accepted it. At least enough to get him out of the bedsit hopefully and tide him over while he decided what to do with his life.
“A treasure hunt, John?” He drawls out. John smiles. He may sound snarky but he’s playing along and that is almost more than John had hoped for. He’d only done three clues, knowing even that was probably pushing both his luck and his abilities.
They were parked directly in front of a door that appeared to be the side entrance to a warehouse of some kind. The door opened mysteriously from the inside and the woman held it open.
Sherlock stared at him a moment, eerily reminiscent of their last interaction, before stalking into his bedroom and slamming the door.
“I’ve been remarkably fond of him lately,” Sherlock replied enigmatically. Both John and Lestrade stared at him for a moment until Sherlock turned away and hailed a cab. Lestrade’s eyebrow rose towards John, but John was just as flummoxed and merely shrugged in response as he hurried to catch up with Sherlock.
“Good job, John,” Sherlock chirped, almost proudly, before starting on a long-winded explanation to Lestrade as to why this murder was actually more important than the previous, yet similar, ones and why that, therefore, meant this was the true intended victim the entire time. John lost him about four minutes, and two exclamations of ‘amazing’, in, but still watched it unfold. John wondered what it said about him that he could envision standing next to this man for years listening to him spout his work. In their current situation he didn’t want to analyze it too closely.
“Jesus, John. Where the hell’d you get that thing and what are you doing bringing it where you know there’ll be police? I can’t turn a blind eye every time the two of you get up to something you shouldn’t.”
With a slight snort of derision, Sherlock waved him in. “Dr. Watson, this is Mr. Wilson. Mr. Wilson, my colleague, Dr. Watson.”
John receives two jumpers, of much nicer quality than any he currently owns, and some odd coffee accouterments that he smiles automatically at, despite his confusion. Sherlock too receives clothing items, more sets of nearly identical bespoke suits. Anthea finally goes to open her own gift from Sherlock and her obviously staged smile morphs into first confusion and then faint aggravated warmth. There is a small set of pearl earrings and an official Scrabble dictionary. John quirks his eyebrow at Sherlock, insisting that he get an explanation later.
John headed off in the morning for his first day at the clinic. He’d awoken after a night of restless sleep and readied himself quickly and efficiently. Out of habit he’d cooked enough breakfast for two so he left a covered plate on the table, hoping Sherlock would emerge and eat at least something. The leftovers from last night were still in the fridge, neatly labeled and obviously untouched. John sighed. The detritus on the table seemed to have shifted and minimized though, so Sherlock had at least left his room at some point it seemed. He hovered outside of Sherlock’s door for a moment, debated knocking, but turned and left with yet another sigh.
Thank you for reading the second installment in this series, I hope you enjoyed it. Reviews, as always, are appreciated!
And so, later that afternoon, once Sherlock has disappeared for some thing or another, and John has busied himself as much as possible, he fetches a box from Mrs. H. filled with fairy lights, mistletoe, cranberry garlands, and miscellaneous decorations. There’s a small tree as well, just a table-sized one, but John places it on the coffee table and strings fairy lights and garlands around it. He doesn’t even want to think of attempting to make room for a full sized evergreen so is thankful for its size. And then there are still enough leftover lights that he covers the mantle as well. After he has hung the decorations and unearths his box of jumpers, John is at a loss. Just as he is contemplating making tea, Sherlock bursts through the door of the flat.
Saturday was only a half day for John, and then he had Sunday and Monday off. He tidied his small bedsit and looked halfheartedly at new flats before realizing he still couldn’t afford anything decent, not yet at least. He lazed around and it reminded him of how passive and near depression he’d been just two short weeks ago. On Monday he did his shopping and laundry and it all felt very civilian, even if it was a bit disconcerting.
John had stared at Mycroft for a second before he’d blushed bright red, visions of their interaction on the stairs the day before running through his head.
“Wonderful, John. Their minions can take it from here. Time for your attempt at getting me to eat and sleep. Mycroft, I’d say it’s been lovely, but it hasn’t. Sal and Ducky, best of luck on your new romantic endeavor. For John’s sake, I hope it doesn’t crash and burn too badly. John, are you ready to go? I’ve a particularly interesting specimen in the fridge yet.”
“Oh, god, John. You aren’t going to start on about the birth of a fictional Christ figure or possibly questionable antics of a rotund old man now, are you?”
“No; mundane is good sometimes. Mundane works.” He might be trying to convince himself more than her, but it could be true. A touch point away from Sherlock may be necessary.
“Sherlock,” John says quietly as he slows his steps. Sherlock, lost in his own thoughts and the screen of his phone, takes a second to process that John has spoken, and the tone of his voice, and strops abruptly a few feet on from John. They’d been walking the streets for almost an hour since they’d left the last scene, despite John’s repeated pleas to hop the plane back to London.
“Latte for old time’s sake?” John asks with a nod and a smile towards the counter where Sal and Ducky are pretending to be covert as they watch him approach. Despite having obviously planned it, Sherlock’s eyes light up slightly, probably not enough that most people would notice. But John isn’t most people when it comes to Sherlock Holmes.
They took a cab to the office and Sherlock spent a few minutes eyeing the outside, before they walked around and inspected the building and those around it. Sherlock randomly poked at places or stopped to stare, even measuring a brick at one point. John couldn’t figure out what he was attempting to prove or locate most of the time, but he stood by him and watched thoughtfully. It was less than a ten minute ordeal before Sherlock stopped abruptly and smiled.
And, like the majority of their cases together so far, it ended in both a chase and an arrest. Though this time there were two arrests. Sherlock had correctly deduced the killer was a father/son team hell-bent on retribution for the wife/mother they’d felt had abandoned them. They’d killed two similar women first before their actual target, attempting to hide it as a serial killer.
“No gender connections, no physical similarities, sustained injuries all different, time of death varies, body position varies, familial connections aren’t traceable, but seems unlikely so far” John rattles the list off from memory, having spent way too much compiling it the night before.
For all of John’s concerns, they settled into a rhythm fairly easily. Sherlock was manic–going from high to low far quicker than John thought possible–but he was also captivating. John, while at once used to the unpredictability of the military, was not generally one to make rash decisions in his personal life. Sherlock seemed to be the exception to that rule, if John’s quitting and subsequent move was anything to show for. He’d been afraid this move would result in a complete takeover of his life, and while not completely true he’d also not been disappointed by the overall exposure and involvement Sherlock seemed to have integrated into it.
