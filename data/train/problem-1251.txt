They blew around frantically in the wind, dancing uncontrollably, and lost. Particles brushed up onto the cement, flew into his face, got caught in his hair. The rush and mayhem continued. He kept his eyes determinedly open, unblinking, watching John’s last remnants fade away until the urn was empty and light.
He lowered it into the crook of his elbow, letting his head drop forward, forehead pressed into the metal beams. The wind sighed against his face, a long, continuous exhale. He breathed, ignoring the chattering seagulls and pedestrians around him, ignoring the never-ending rush of cars and zephyr, and focusing on the roaring gush of the gulf below.
He then asked about my name. I wasn’t sure what to say. I haven’t connected with the name Rosie for a long time, but it’s not something I’ve thought about much. I quietly told him I’d get back to him on it.
Yester day Scottie told me that she is not cuming back to school with me next year. She said that her family was taking her back to Ustralia and that she was sorry because she didnt want to go away.
He pocketed the notepad, grabbed the urn and stood up, feeling his legs sigh under the relief. With his free hand, he reached up to his hair, brushing away a few stray ashes, his eyes trained on the sea. He lingered for a moment, feeling the wind brushing against him, waving his coat collar frantically against his neck like a flag in the wind. He breathed in and smiled to the ocean.
I don’t know what to do or who to turn to, and I think that maybe… maybe if you came home everything would be better. I’ve tried to tell myself that you’re not coming home but I feel like if I lose hope, you never will, and I can’t bear the thought of you never returning.
When Greg stood up from his place next to John and begun his speech, John smiled up at him gratefully. The speech was simple, conventional; everything he'd expected from his friend.
It was weirdest feeling. I felt vulnerable and exposed. But at the same time, I just wanted to curl in tighter and be comforted. And eventually, we stopped crying. And all of a sudden, Dad was laughing, and I started laughing, too.
I think Dad needs someone to talk to, but I know I can’t be that person. Broken things don’t fix other broken things.
I seid I was working on a new experyment like you do. I showed her all the peeses and she said that she was empressed. I dont know what that is but I think it is good. I tried showing Daddy but he seid he had to use the barthroom and then he left and didnt cume bac out again. I wish I coold show you the experymint. I dont remebmer how long it has been but I think you hav been gon for a few days and I miss you.
I told him that I didn’t want to and he said that was okay, but to keep it in mind and come to him if I decided for it.
I keep telling myself that if I moved and did something it might get better, but I keep coming back to my bed and closing my eyes and staying here for hours, letting the same thoughts play over and over in my mind so that all I can think about is how I know it’s not getting any better.
It’s been a week since I started secondary and it’s hard. I can’t admit it to Dad though, because he seems stressed enough as it is without my stupid problems piling on top of that. At least the school work is dull and easy, but it’s not fun and it means nothing about that stupid place makes it worth going to.
I’m starting secondary school in a few days. I’m two years younger than everyone else, but it doesn’t make me feel that different. I think I’m smarter than them anyway, and I’ve learned how to avoid the bullies, so it doesn’t matter that I’m smaller.
Before he can comment on that, she's standing up and kissing his forehead. It feels strange, but he doesn't comment. Instead, he watches her as she walks out of the room, and he can't help but wonder why there are tears in her eyes as she does.
I know there is nothing wrong with it, but I get the impression that it would only cause further problems, and I don’t think that either Dad or I need that. However, I also see that talking about it could make it better, but I don’t want to have to think about that because thinking about it takes away all the energy still left in me, and I’m so tired of being tired.
I stil dont know were you are but Daddys talking again a little bit. Mrs Hudson came to drop in she said because she wonted to see how we were.
Dad doesn’t speak to me, Mrs Hudson’s dead, I have no friends, and I barely met you. I’ve heard so many things about who and what you are, mostly stories by Mrs H when she used to babysit me regularly, or by reading through Dad's old blog, but reading and hearing stories about you doesn’t mean I really know you. I’ve considered you a friend -my
It’s sort of funny. I imagined it would be something symbolic or significant. Or something heroic. But it just seems so anticlimactic. Of all the ways you could have died, I didn’t expect it to be a fairly regular road accident. Sometimes life is just ordinary, even for the extraordinary.
I pretened to be playeing with the toys in the class room so that Daddy and the teecher wooldnt know that I was lisening. The teecher said I was angry and that i shoold see some one and I dont understand why I woold becos I see peeple all the time and they are all stoopid so I dont need to see any mor. I also dont think that I am angry I think I look angry becos the uther students are always meen and I do something Daddy said is caled insalting them. If what I am doeing is insalting then they shoold be insalted.
Well, technically I didn’t fail; I got a B. But it feels like I’ve failed. I feel like I’ve failed myself. I feel like I’ve failed you.
I dont know were you are or why you left but daddys been siting on his chair all day and he lookes sad and he wont tell me what is rong. I hope that you are okay because I relly miss you and I want you to cume home and I think Daddy dos too.
After I asked Daddy if we coold go to unother parti with mor chooldren and he seid that we coold later. He seemd sad and I thort that mabe it was because the parti was boreing so I gave him a hugg and then I ran up stars to my bedrom and playd with the stuff in the box that seys chemestry kit.
I do not know if you woold be empressed or disaponted like Daddy but i went to the prinsiples ofis today and i was in truble becos i seid sumething to another stodent and i made them cry. Daddy seid i was not alowed to tel peeple i knew they wet the bed becos it was meen but I didnt tel him or the prinsiple why I seid it becos they did not ask and I dont wont them to know. I think I got in truble becos the othar stodent cried and I didnt.
The teecher and Daddy talked today and they said that I coold moove up like the teecher had said to me. They discused a lot of things as I walked around the room. I liked the room after school becos all the stoopid students are gon and it’s quieet and I can moove arowned eezily.
Shifting slightly, he pulled out the notepad once again, feeling the rough, worn cover under his fingers. He flipped it open, pulled out his pencil, and slowly crossed out the last line.
The days at school feel long and slow and boring. My mind is fuzzy like I couldn’t focus on anything if I even wanted to. My chest feels heavy and sore. Everyone avoids me. It feels like there’s some invisible barrier around me and no one will cross over it. Dad never speaks to me anymore, and Mrs Hudson is getting too old to climb the stairs and visit anymore. I’ve thought of stopping by on her sometime but I never feel like I have the energy or the will.
It’s cristmas soon and I am exited because I know that you will cume home, because you and Daddy always made shure to be home on cristmas. I remembar when you were not back until late at nite on cristmas eve and Daddy got verry mad at you and made you promis, that you woold never mis it again. That is how I know that you will cume back home and that makes me hapy.
I reread the letters I wrote to you a few years ago, and it was strange. I had forgotten about Scottie, Redbeard, and expecting you home for Christmas, and I’d even learned to ignore the married bumblebees and let them fade into the background like everything else in my room that I used to play with.
I wasn’t going to worry about writing anymore of these letters, seeing as I still haven’t figured out where you are, and I don’t want to bring it up to Dad and break our unspoken rule about not talking about you. I thought of asking Mrs Hudson, but she usually changes the subject when I speak of you so I suppose, now that I think about it, that the rule extends to all family, not just Dad.
Eventually he told me that I should see a therapist. He clarified that it wasn’t because he thinks I am broken for being trans, but that I might just be hurting. I honestly don’t know if I’m hurting. I don’t remember feeling anything but this.
The ache in his chest eased minutely and he leaned back, feeling the heaviness of the urn weigh down his arm.
Before bed time he came into my room again and sat down on my bed and asked me what was rong again, I said that Scottie was leaving and that I wouldnt have another frend again and he said that it will be okay but I know that it wont. He asked me if I wanted to cry and I said no and he said that its okay to cry when Im sad but I said that I didnt want to cry and he said that was okay too, and he asked me if I wanted to sleep with him at nite and I said yes so we went to Daddy’s bed insted.
I started scool today. I didnt like it there wer lots of peeple and they all lookd exited. I didnt know what to do and i didnt takl to any one. Sumone askd my name and i told them I was caled Richard. He lookd at me werd and went away and i dont want to see him agen. I dont know why I did that becos my name is Rosie. I think i wantd him to go away. I was glad that he did.
After about 4 sessions with him I finally managed to pick up an old book and read a bit. It’s been seven weeks now and I managed to start a new chemistry experiment a few days ago. I still haven’t been able to answer his questions about you, but on the whole, I’ve been talking more both inside and outside of therapy.
It's not like he could blame her. He knew it was a difficult job, taking the place of a long-lost partner. They really were doing the best that they could.
I heard Mrs Hudson talk to him late at nite and so I went down stairs quitly so they would not know and I lisened to them. Mrs H said things like you need to be there for her and Daddy said that he couldnt do it and I wanted to go to him and hug him and say that he is good at everything like I remember Daddy saying to you all the time that made you smile but he walked out of the room and to yur room and Mrs H tried to walk down the stairs and found me and she looked sad and I asked her what was rong with Daddy and she didnt answer and told me that I had to go back to my room so I did.
The instant the light died in Sherlock's eyes, it died in John Watson's too. It had taken months before John had been able to force himself back to the working world to retain some façade of his life of
I was sitting in the living room when the phone rang. Dad got up to answer it and I sat and listened. I deduced it pretty quickly; any ordinary person could have figured it out, so there wasn’t really much point in him coming in to tell me. I suppose it is customary though.
John's son (formerly 'Rosie') is going to see a clinical psychologist/counselor for psychotherapy because, for now, his symptoms are mostly based on the environment rather than biological factors. John, on the other hand, I think would (should) see a psychiatrist by this point in order to properly treat his depression/PTSD. (The main difference between the two is that psychiatrists can prescribe medication, and counselors can't.)
I think I’m starting to be okay again. I know that there are holes in this family, but they don’t feel so massive or isolating anymore.
’ he whispered, the change piercing the static air around them, charging it with near-frantic energy.
I haven’t been focusing on school these days. I haven’t been speaking, either. In fact, I can’t remember the last time I did.
When the first serious symptoms occur, he's on his way to work, and he realises he doesn't know where to go. He falters, stopping right in the middle of the street, almost hit by traffic before he has the sense to keep moving towards the pavement.
I wunder if i woold be les sad if you came back but I dont think I feel sad. i want you to cume hom thoe.
The sunlight had their bodies bathed ethereally in gold. It reminded him gently of infinity; all the stars and planets he’d never see.
He presumed she'd never forget the look on his face as the glass shattered and he marched out without another word.
When he'd made the call to deliver the news, Morgan was off in some undisclosed position in the Middle East.
But I suppose part of me has been holding out hope all along that you’d return because I missed you. It also meant that the fact that I kept writing to you seemed less weird if I pretended to myself that one day you’d actually be on the other end, reading everything. Other kids had a diary and friends; in the meantime, I was all alone as I wrote to my dead father.
It was like a spell had been put over us. We laughed so hard we cried again. I was so happy. It was so painful. It was painfully real.
We laughed for about ten minutes, thinking about everything we’d lost and everything we had left. I was so happy. I’ve never felt lighter in my life.
She cried as she huged me and said good bye and I watched her go into the car with her mothers and drive away.
I talked to Dad about you today. I told him that I realised that you’d died and he seemed shocked. He hugged me and started crying and apologised, more profusely than I’d anticipated, for not telling me earlier, and that he’d always assumed I had figured it out long ago and never spoke about it because I didn’t want to.
I’ve thought of trying Richard. I used it once instinctively when I was younger to get someone to go away, but I’m not enthusiastic about it. I’ll keep thinking
n, and he’s nice, and he specialises in LGBT+ people. Dad sees a psychiatrist now, but he told me that when he had first come out he’d visited Iv
When he blinks his eyes, the world comes back into focus and his memories offer themselves back to him. He doesn't smile when he remembers where he is- what he's doing; why all of this is happening.
Every day felt like a battle. And John knew better than anyone what that meant. He was reliving his life as a solider; marching back and forth through the heavy fog of mourning, depression, grief, or whatever it was that Ella had liked to call it.
(I'm sorry I haven't been replying to comments for a few chapters. I generally read them within roughly 2 hours -unless I've been asleep- but I'm usually unsure how to respond. I always will eventually, but until then, know that they are all, always, monumentally appreciated)
I then got sume red on my skirt and I coold not see it much because it was black but I was scarred I woold get in truble so I hid it under the bed and I hope Daddy wil not find it. I am teling you becos I do not think you woold be angry with me becos when I climed on to the counter and acsidently droped a glars you did not get angry but Daddy did. You only got angry at me when you were leting me be your asistent in reeserch and I broke a long glars thing and spilld the thing you said was asid on the floor. You woold not let me go near it and made me go to my room for all aftanoon. Daddy came in after he got home and told me that wen you get angry it is not for long and that it wood be okay. He seid he was serprised that I did not cry becos of you but I hav never cride becos of you becos you always make me hapy. That is why I wannt you to cume back Papa.
I never let myself think about it properly, but I realise that I just didn’t want to face the truth. Despite all the evidence, I’d let myself believe you’d left us because you gave up and walked out one day. But you didn’t, and I know that now. You left your clothes, you left your violin, you left your science equipment; you left everything behind.
The next time people come to visit him, he can't move his arms. There are a few of them this time. He doesn't know who they are, but they seem nice. When one of them asks him how he is, he has trouble talking. Trouble breathing too. With some difficulty, he just manages to say it.
He knew he loved her. He really did. And as he looked her in the eye, reciting his memorised, traditional vows, doing his best to keep it from sounding robotic, he really did try to ignore the hollowness of his words as they fell through his mouth and tumbled onto the carpet below him.
Dad’s started drinking again. I never see him, but I can tell because these days the beer cupboard door hangs ajar like a permanent fixture whenever I see it, as if he felt like a change in decor the way he did when you left and he moved your armchair permanently out of sight.
My Health teacher asked me to stay back after class to talk to them, today. They said that they had noticed I had been acting differently for the past few months. I half-expected a dry, sarcastic retort to come out of me, but instead my mind was blank and I said nothing.
John smiled, warm and pleasant, his body ghostly and non-tangible; an aching reminder of the impossible, unreachable dream. John reached out his hand, and Sherlock’s own twitched by his side, itching to take it.
I’d already had this letter planned since the day I started the series, but the day I actually wrote it (5th March), I really did get my chemistry test results, and I got a low score. It turned out to be the average - above average for the class because it was a hard test, but at first this was kinda how it was to get that mark, actually.
He chooses the restaurant before the ring. He doesn't really know why. He guessed it was more important, somehow, to choose the right venue for the question.
When he reopened them, he looked up slowly; watched the red beams strike blindingly against the sunlight. The cool breeze wafted by, and his hand trembled.
However, I suppose I don’t have to worry about holding onto that hope anymore, because as I see Dad and I recover, I realise more and more that I’ve finally got something and someone tangible to hold onto.
I barely met you, but I know enough about you that I know you’d never have done that willingly; not if killing a man for Dad is anything to show for that.
We had a day of scool today becos the teecher wanted to talk to all the parints. Some of the uther kids had mothers thoe. I think one of them was not a mother or a daddy but Daddy was in a hury when I asked him so I desided it was a parint but not a mother or daddy. I dont think I hav a mummy. Daddy and you said she diede when I was very litle but I dont miss her at all becos I did not know her. I think I only hav you and Daddy and that is okay becos I dont want a mother anyway.
I havent got in truble or in any fites with any of the students in the class and my old teecher said that they were impressed and hapy that I was hapy.
I am going to tell Daddy not to yel at you when you cume home because he shoold be hapy and not angry that you finally cume home again.
It's done now, though. I'll be posting the final chapter up soon (and trying not be overwhelmed by that concept). But I really hope you enjoy these last few chapters.
Sherlock watched the hand swirling slowly, silhouetted in the beam of Eastern sunlight streaming from the window, in between the plain, white curtains dripping from the rod. The shadows danced and flickered on his face. His eyes were lazy, tired, he breathed out slowly, swimming in contentment, the corners of his mouth turned up in an easy smile.
I told him I was transgender. For a long, long moment I held my breath, terrified and waiting. But then he moved in to hug me and he whispered that
Daddy arived at school to pic me up and I didnt speek the entire way home or at dinneer. Daddy asked me what was rong but I did not want to tel him so I didnt say anything and I went to my room to be on my bed by my self.
By the time all his children are well into their twenties, one has transitioned (John had found it kind of funny to watch him throw his mother's name choice to the side and reclaim himself), one has followed in his footsteps to become a doctor, and the other has shipped herself off to join the army.
Then there was a smile- a woman by the name of Mary Morstan. She seemed lovely. John supposed this meant it was time to really move on.
His life exists in an ocean, he thinks sometimes. It's like he's wading through fog, waiting for it all to end.
Today I actually read an old letter of my mum's (she sent it to her grandmother), and it was funny. I haven't actually read a child's letter for years, because I'm never actually around children, but I remember seeing the massive worksheets of prep schoolers on the windows of their classrooms at my primary school, and how many errors there were, as well as years ago, reading my strange stories done during primary school classes, and noting their incoherence and terrible spelling. So those memories were what I had based the writing style of these letters on. So, when I was reading the letter today, I was surprised to see that she really did make spelling mistakes such as adding extra letters, which I've included in this series, but wasn't fully sure was a thing. The example I noticed, was writing "feell" instead of "fell".
There were other similar occurrences and parallels between the letters and my life right after I wrote them, as well. It's like I somehow foreshadowed future misfortune, which is weird af
I talked to the nice student again today and she was stil nice to me. Her name is Scottie and she said she was born in Ustralia which is the cuntry at the bottom of the map in my bed room. She told me about ustralia and said it was nice there and that there werent as many peeple and that Lundon has a lot of peeple.
I can’t think of anyone to say this to, and I know that it’s pathetic to have to say it anyway, but you’re not here and I guess that’s probably why you’re my only friend. So I suppose you, my only friend, will have to be the one I share it with, because I have no one else, and what feels like no other choice.
When Jacob had told them all that he was changing his name legally, John had one appeal; one contribution.
It's not long before John quits his job and spends his days at home. It's only months after (he thinks), when he's transferred to an aged care facility.
The teecher said that I am verry smart but that I do not get along with the othar stodents. I thort Daddy woold be disaponted again but he smiled and he looked impresed and that felt good becos I do not want to be frends with the uther kids.
Daddy seys that I start scool soon. Mrs H came up to giv me sume new clothes to wer. She seid I woold look good and i was giftid and that I would do amazeing at school. I showd her my leters and I thort she woold be empressed becos I found out that word and insted she just fround and did not torlk as much after. I dont think I will sho any one the leters anymor. At leest no one exept you.
I'd like to issue a forewarning for the next few chapters, specifically Ch 28 (the next one). If you're likely to be triggered by any kind of very bad depression, and related themes, I advise you skip the next chapter. The chapter itself is not essential whatsoever to the plot, so if you have any concerns, feel free to do that. Alternatively, if you don't want to skip, I advise to proceed with caution. Stay safe, please
Daddy has been going outside and leeving me with Mrs Hudsn and Mrs Hudson said that he is going to see a theropest. I don not know what that is but I hoap that looking at it will make him les sad. I asked Mrs Hudson wether if you came home Daddy would be les sad or not and she sed that she thort so. I asked her if she thort you were cuming home and she didnt anser she got up and made sume tea.
He smiled, tears gathering in the corner of his eyes, blown away by the wind like the meagre drops of spitted rain, never amounting to anything. They faded away into the cement.
The reception was lovely. Bright yellow wallpaper and a beautiful garden. It was everything John could have asked for, and more.
Again, I've read every one of your comments, and I'm so grateful to you for all of them. However, I've never gotten this many before, and I'm used to replying as soon as I see them, but usually it's hard to reply because, well, I'm always grateful... but not so skilled at saying so.
Some days felt lighter, like somehow the mist had cleared and he was back in the clear again; ready to move forwards in his life. Other days, it felt as if the fog was so heavy, he couldn't breathe, and all he could do was wait.
Sherlock looked back up again. He watched the sunlight dance on the metal, licking down the frame, desperate and clinging before its inevitable end.
I’m really into chemistry. I thought that would make you proud because you were the one who introduced it to me when I was so young, and I think you really enjoyed it as well.
I’m starting to think that you may have gone through this too, and I wish you were here so I could talk to you about it, because I don’t know what to do.
One particularly bad day, he had sat down in the armchair across from her, his mind so exhausted that he didn't bother to mask the grimness he knew burned sharply on his face. That day, his therapist had decided that maybe he was truly, finally ready to talk things over.
But in the end they hadn’t, though, and Dad agreed that the name William was suitable for me. I didn’t mention that I had considered choosing your chosen name, Sherlock, and then reconsidered when I thought of the pain that might cause Dad.
One day, a woman comes to visit him. She holds his hand, and he tells her she is very lovely. She looks about the same age as him.
Today I had my ferst day with the older students. The teecher said he was amased by my riting and maths skils. I think I am beter even than the older peeple.
Dad still drinks sometimes, we still don’t talk very often, and I still can’t get out of bed some days; but, the cupboard door is closed whenever I see it, we talk more than we have in years, and those days are getting less and less frequent.
"And they're absolutely right. I'd be terrified, too." She returned to the document with a yawn. "Although we have been here for nearly five hours. I'm missing so many good programs on the telly for you."
"But maybe I didn't let you know this before and I should now. I've come to develop . . . lapses in coherency for you, John. Stirrings."
"Not much better, but my condolences for trying and flopping. But, again, this is far off track. You're avoiding actual conversing." Sherlock snorted.
Well, it's certainly an interesting love story, for sure, if not a slightly disappointing commentary on her matchmaking skills.
"Let's hope not. We skipped the teenage rebellion phase, so bypassing 'jaded towards life' in its entirety shouldn't be too much to ask for."
"You know, I think I need to send a card to your grandparents," the blonde man sighed, reacting much as if the revelation had hit him right between the eyes. "A thank you card. And a very long one, at that." The teenager cocked her head.
"That we've unveiled the lucrative schemes of a faulty historian hoping to make money off of a supposedly lost Shakespearean play?"
The bottom line is, Rosamund loves learning. She's been looking forward to school, unlike the many bedwetters of her age. She had been ecstatic to go to the academy this morning.
"Aunt Molly, are you okay? You spaced out for a second," Rosie questions, nose scrunched up. Her smile loosens, though, when she realizes the pun. "Spaced out. Doctor Who. I'm a genius." The brunette shakes the confusion out of her skull and ruffles Rosamund's hair.
This very likely wouldn't happen. She knows that she isn't the prettiest, or the smartest, or the strongest, and that hasn't ever bothered her. She wanted to get married and have children and start a family - preferably a big one, so that nobody would ever be alone, so it would never go back to her and her mother and nothing - but that was simply not how it panned out.
No, in such close quarters her trusty revolver would do her little good, after all. She had to resort to something else.
She can't recall most of the fine details (she was tearing up dreadfully, alright?), but she had watched patiently as the service began.
"The only other spot next to Molly would be a tight fit for both of us, John. Maybe I should just stand over here." Playing into his daughter's hands, Watson shook his head.
As much as she couldn't see it before, perhaps the reason his heart could never be occupied by such notions of romance was because he had already found his version. It came with compositions at sunrise and picking up takeout, stealing jumpers for experimentation and purposefully doing unspeakably disgusting things with pieces from the morgue in the kitchen sink, just to get a reaction.
"Close indeed," the detective managed dryly, and if Molly didn't know him better, she would dare say that he was starting to blush, pressed up against his best friend.
"I really wish I could ground you, somedays," John finally said, glaring at his daughter without much effort. He sounded exasperated. "Unfortunately, Sherlock's gotten to you, blast him. You're just as likely to unhinge your door or slip out the window or blow holes in the wall as retaliation. Grounding doesn't really work, does it?" As Rosie shrugged, actually taking that comment seriously.
, for a change. You'll just have to tough it out for two hours." "Why are we getting married again, Watson?" "Hush up, you're the one who proposed.") the entire event would be concluded.
"This reminds me of that football movie, for some reason. Sherlock, what was the one about the Indian girl who wanted to play football?"
dating and becoming remarried. We're all over the map. I am an absolute mess of a human being. When I first met Sherlock, I had no idea why I was even still alive. PTSD, bullet wounds, no real connections and a very vague concept of where I would be staying - that was me, when I walked in. I needed a fresh start, but I didn't have anything to believe in. And yet, you, Sherlock, took one look at me and knew everything there was to know. You were absolutely brilliant. You have no clue what you did by just giving me a purpose, by allowing me to be your best friend. You gave me back my life, and from that day onwards, my world started to center on yours. Thank you for being here, for not giving up on my ordinary self through everything - through every argument, every injury, every struggle in raising Rosie. Thanks for choosing me." Molly didn't quite know how, but she had started to clap. A glance over at the other guests confirmed that they were doing the same, though, so she didn't feel too out of place.
"No, seriously, why are we married? How did we even remain civil for this long?" The consulting detective shrugged.
These qualities served her well, making her the beloved of her school without much effort. Rosie couldn't give a flying fig about popularity, honestly - her loyalties lied with her friends and family, her interests in academics, and her heart in the detective work her parents performed. And, at age seventeen, she was eager to start taking up the Holmes-Watson mantle.
. He brushes a few strands of ebony out of his best friend's face and gives him a small squeeze on the shoulder. "How's that for an answer?"
"Here you are," John interrupted neatly, holding out another steaming cup towards Mycroft, the spoon bobbing along inside. "Do you still need me to leave, or are you done conspiring yet?" The dark haired man nodded.
"I'll try," she said determinedly, already grinning again. "Can you teach me after I get home, though? Until it gets interesting."
So here is, as promised, the next installment of Elementary, My Dear Rosie. I've already had this up for a while on my fanfiction.net account, but this gave me the chance to comb through and edit out any small errors, which was helpful.
"It was great," is all John chooses to reveal on their night out, and frankly this is all that Molly expected he would share. He's found some sort of solace in whatever relationship he and Sherlock have cultivated, and giving out all the details might spoil the effect. It's all so new, an official romance, and he's reluctant to mess it up yet.
"I don't think you can make that choice as a ghost, Holmes. It should have been me. It should have been
Rosamund adored her family dearly, but one thing was for certain; she was going to change things, and she was going to change them whether her fathers wanted it or not.
"Aren't you a little old to ask me to babysit?" Molly questions as she settles down next to her. "I mean, I thought you'd hate having someone watch you. You were always so independent, you know." Rosamund shrugged.
"Quite something, indeed." Rosie clambered into his lap, frowning at the lack of his usual confidence. Still, she remained calm and quiet, waiting for her father to give her an answer. "You're right about it, you know. I think I've made you a little too clever."
"Watson-Holmes? You're actually using that ridiculous name?" he asked, brow furrowing. "I honestly thought you hated it."
"So you admit that you managed to scheme your way into pestering me this afternoon? You probably had to pencil me in before the Prime Minister - I suppose I should feel important."
was on their side, silently trying to instigate an intervention without actually instigating an intervention.
It's simply impossible to be hard and distant when you live with the Watsons, he has deduced, because they are the most compassionate and stunningly brave people you will ever hope to meet. As his best friend, John had clearly proven his use over and over and over again - he was
"I see," the small blonde said simply, looking back at her puzzle - the english countryside, today - and snapping another piece into place. She wasn't quite sure if she did or not, but she wanted him to feel better. Daddy always had a way of making other people feel better, so if she could do it, do this one small thing for him, then maybe it was as if she was returning the favor. For a long stretch of time he grew quiet, silently assembling the jigsaw with her, before he turned up his chin again.
"When I was hanging out with Dad. When I was talking with Aunt Molly. When I was baking with Mrs. Hudson." He nods, ever so slightly, a spark of understanding that she can almost perceive hanging in the air.
"Sherlock's still Sherlock," he says, clearing his throat and giving his daughter a sideways glance. "It doesn't necessarily mean anything. It's not exactly a full blown
"Bloody hell, Ro, slow down a bit," the brunette grumbled halfheartedly, shrugging her away with little force. "I'm here, aren't I?"
certainly not sweating or anything. And the documents my friend procured are definitely up to snuff with your so-called originals. Tell me, you
After three hours, she was seriously considering ordering food out - for the second time today - when the child she was babysitting began to cry.
Well. Rosamund Watson did have a flair towards the dramatic, even when there was nobody around to notice.
"Lestrade decided to come along, this time," John mentioned passingly. He was washing dishes in the flat and Molly was drying, as she had been invited over for dinner. "Rosie practically begged him to come see after he said he played a bit of rugby in uni, so now he's pretty much guaranteed to arrive." At this she smiled.
This is why he is so confused when the little girl that calls him Dad is looking so out of sorts this afternoon.
," Reyna deadpanned, crossing her arms. "Aren't we supposed to be looking for something before a certain man stirs and comes out to investigate?" Rosamund frowned slightly.
"I wasn't informed, either," Sherlock answered, still pointedly looking away from his relative. "How peculiar."
However, there was one person she knew who was enamored with writing, clever, and would be more than happy to partner up with Rosamund on this endeavor.
"I have no clue what I'm supposed to be doing," John said the instant they arrived at the thai place on their first date (yes, an actual date, Sherlock really wishes everyone would just
"Of course. Wasn't that the idea?" the man replied, smirking. "We're waiting, Watson." The blonde took a deep breath.
And then there's her Aunt Molly, and Aunt Molly is the absolute best. She's always kind, always sweet, and always taking care of her. Rosie and Molly watch telly together when her guardians are off on 'work business', journey to the supermarket to buy groceries when the fridge is running low, and take walks to the nearest playground and the park whenever Rosie wants to. Sometimes, when she's with her aunt, Rosamund wonders if this is what having a mother is like. She's never really been sad about not having her mother (
"We'll see, in the morning, long after John has recovered from his perpetual stupor and Reyna has something on her rather horrific bruises." They all piled into the back of a cab together, and Rosie reached out and squeezed Reyna's hand. The runner squeezed back tightly, and they held hands in the dimly lit vehicle while looking out the window. London at night, lit up like lanterns, was stunning; it glittered like gemstones, and you could see bridges and buildings and sidewalks and streetlamps and
"Rosie, just go and set up the telly, won't you?" She pouted viciously but did as she was told, walking into the living area and slipping a Doctor Who disc inside of a player. John watched her leave, frowning in a way that didn't quite reach his eyes.
"There are twenty other students in my class. Eleven are girls. The teacher is nice, about fifty I think, with light blonde hair and blue eyes. She's happy, and she has a ring on her finger. That means she's probably married." Rosie stared back at Sherlock sheepishly. "Am I doing okay?"
"I was a wreck, even then, Holmes. If you died now, there would be nothing to put back together." The blonde brushed a thumb over the detective's knuckles in a tender fashion, skimming the skin with a quick swipe. "Bloody hell, mate, I have no idea what I'd do without you." At this point, and perhaps it was due in part to the drugs racing through his system and the brief charge of contact and those
"Sorry, but I don't have any cash on me," Molly said, sidestepping the table. It was a shame, though. Hot chocolate would be more than welcome at the moment.
Rosie has a phenomenal father named John Watson, and he's the perfect dad. He's patient and gentle and
"Here's your tea, Molly," he said, dropping off a tall cup. It seemed odd, being out of the morgue and the labs and not being the one to
"Well, I seriously doubt she'll be able to find a gun and shoot at the wall, so I'm presuming we'll be safe," he sighed, but a grin was already quirking at his lips.
"Nonsense. We have a capable doctor on our hands - you would survive the shock," he intoned, dismissing the thought as though the very notion was preposterous. "And in the unlikely circumstance that you needed resuscitation, I have the necessary implements for the procedure on hand. You'd be absolutely fine." she glared fiercely, anyhow.
The next thirty minutes until the police actually showed up were a blur. They both pretended that tying a man up in his own bedsheets and locating and cracking a private safe ("It's super easy if you set your mind to it, Rey." "No it's not, how did you
"Do you remember Reichenbach?" Suddenly, the doctor is far more awake. His arms, despite their apparent heaviness, wind around the genius' back in a comforting way, drawing him nearer.
You see, it wasn't exactly hard to notice the subtle shift in the dynamic of Watson and Holmes. There had always been lingering brushes, unwavering eye contact, and communication without speaking a word, and these notations only increased in their frequency and potency when the Watsons moved into 221B. However, since their clear foray past the lines of friendship and into the realm of an ominous, rather ill-defined 'something more', something had slipped. John had the rather embarrassing habit of flushing whenever anybody brought up the nature of their relationship, and Sherlock treated him with an air of closeness that wasn't there previously. It was an odd, if not tender change, the addition of warmth in the air. It's the way he carefully examines John after a particularly trying chase, making sure he is still alive and still
Rosie didn't panic. She had seen many a gun in her life, and though this threat was clearly valid, it had ceased to scare her past the age of ten. Besides, they had the advantages of numbers, nimbleness, if his middle was anything to go by, and her hidden revolver.
. Indeed, this was what she aspired to be, and she took a great pride in her achievement of that grand title.
Somedays, Sherlock wonders if this is the closest he will ever get to raising children of his own. He'd never really given the notion much thought - who would endure marriage to him long enough to produce offspring, after all - but Rosie had long ago started calling the strange man she lived with 'Dad' once the proper syllables were established, and really, Sherlock never bothered to correct her. If it helped, John was referred to as Daddy. Far more use of sentiment, he's certain.
But she also understood that she was torturing herself by staying fixated on the most incredible man she's ever known. Sherlock Holmes was wonderful, but he was simply not right for her. He would never be who she needed him to be, never fall into her arms like a missing puzzle piece, never comfort her on her worst days.
There were only a grand total of fifteen people at the ceremony, positioned on wooden benches beneath the rickety pergola. Mycroft, the one exception to this rule and number sixteen, stood up, refusing to sit, and remained off to the side, watching the proceedings with a casual fondness. In the left wing, there was Mr. and Mrs. Watson, Rosamund and Reyna, as they were inseperable, Mike, Sarah, Harriet and Clara (they had, miraculously, been available at the last possible moment and had flown in just for the wedding - Harry even seemed to be sober this time, and Molly didn't doubt for a second that this had to do with Clara coming back into her life), and another two friends from the hospital. The right side, containing the smaller Holmes party, lied Ms. Hudson, Mr. and Mrs. Holmes, Billy Wiggins, and then, of course, Greg and Molly Lestrade themselves. A sparse population, save the officiator, but it worked. Only those who were immensely important were present, just the way the two men would have wanted (Rosamund herself had wanted another guest, Bailey the malamute, but John had firmly turned her down - the dog would have been an absolute nuisance in a cab). The only music came from classical violin recordings, many of those directly from Sherlock's endeavors in their own flat, and as the garden was already filled with flowers - it was a
"Your vocabulary is worse than Shakespeare's in terms of ornamental, Rosamund." She snorted back, reluctantly laying back onto the bed and continuing with her reading.
John remained silent for a good thirty seconds after they pulled apart, blinking rapidly. Holmes, as always, appeared unphased by this or by anything.
But surely she can't keep him confined to such an oddly shaped role forever. She has to find a more permanent place for Lestrade, somewhere, and in the past few months it has messed with her mind, not being able to pinpoint a spot that someone so dear to her should be occupying.
Jamiarty glanced at the Count, who left the chapel with four other warriors, Anderson among them. “Please, Bishop, can’t we skip to the end?” Then he took Sherlock’s hand and kissed it. “I must wed my beloved. Since his own is dead.”
It had been seven years since the last time, but she’d never forgotten. She was in America, and she’d just beaten the local wizard. She was relaxing at the tavern, refusing ale (oh, the time before alcohol) but happily drinking the sweet raspberry juice the barmaid offered her.
Molly and Janine’s gift was a beautiful picture Janine painted, with the sun high over a wintery day. It was framed with one of Molly’s beautiful frames, made from silver. Molly made beautiful things from metal—never swords, but almost everything else. Janine was wearing one of her necklaces, and Waverly had a small metal statue of a bird, decorated with red gems.
Grezzik set John down gently just beside the castle wall. Molly was calmer now, and that scared him. “Shouldn’t we wait longer?”
“You two are…never mind. What was Sherlock’s idea?” Greg listened for a moment, then laughed. “Oh those hopeless romantics…”
“Not to hear this. But I  know his style. He’s not as effective as the Count once was, but he learned some tricks.” John had to stop for a moment, to collect his thoughts, to stop his mind from running screaming into the darkness of the past.
Mummy was also very understanding when Billy came creeping into her room at three in the morning that night, asking if he could stay to make sure nobody stole his necklace. Daddy was away, after all. He had to protect her. And her necklace.
Another man stood behind them, a bit shorter than the Greg he knew, but it was the same familiar face. “Hello, Greg,” he said cheerfully, offering his hand.
Mycroft was standing in the library door. He wasn’t in night clothes, but he was wearing a rich purple dressing gown over his regular robes. “May I speak to you for a moment?”
The only sounds were Sally’s quiet sobs. Sally, who still couldn’t lift her child easily, who was still taking painkilling tea every few hours, who’d spent her whole life believing any child she would bear would belong to someone else, was crying, bent nearly double in a chair. Unlike the night of Waverly’s birth, Anderson wasn’t crying. He sat beside his wife, both her hands in his, and stared straight ahead, staring at nothing.
“That’s a start,” Molly said. “Or it could be the end. You know, you don’t have to learn to love people to be kind. I didn’t love anyone but my father for most of my life, but I knew how to be kind from my father.”
Disclaimer: I know zero things about Naruto, so it won't be discussed in detail. Also, Gruner is a weeaboo who likes Naruto, not everyone who likes Naruto is a weeaboo.
Sherlock lay back in the grass. It was rather sunny out. Perhaps it was making his ears too hot to hear properly.
“They took our mothers and fathers away,” Eria said. Her eyes were dull. “Jamiarty said that he wasn’t sure if they were involved in the treason, so they needed interrogation.”
"Where's your boyfriend?" Donovan asked. Her lips were twitching, like she could see the last hider in Hide-and-Seek but didn't want to give the game away just yet. "Shouldn't you be attached to his hip?"
“Is…” John stopped, but it was the question on everyone’s mind. If Riley hated Anderson, if she could defy Jamiarty…was the child alive?
Sherlock realized he was gripping John’s hand too tightly. He tried to loosen his grip, but John hung on more tightly.
Lestrade’s eyes widened for a moment before he laughed. “You would think that I’d be used to such magic by now from a Holmes. Yes, I’m going to join my Maggie. She’s had another baby, and her husband is ill. I may be able to help with the children.”
Billy listened intently as his sister skipped around. She hadn’t stopped moving since the day she was born, and Watson was sure his granddaughter would be dancing across a stage when she grew older.
Sherlock really only needed five to master the technique, and it was nearly thirty minutes before Mycroft and Greg showed up.
“You’re assuming something,” Moran said. He looked…almost ashamed. Mycroft was surprised; he didn’t think the Lord was capable.
The only distraction was Waverly, who clearly wasn't sensing the tension and demanded to be played with. They took turns with her, holding her and playing horsey. The only one who couldn't hold her properly was Grezzik, so Molly sat next to him, holding Waverly up as Grezzik made funny faces with her.
Post 'Adventure of the Three Garridebs', Holmes and Watson return to Baker Street. Watson thinks he's fine. Holmes knows that he's not.
But not the kind that Max did, where he coaxed plants and medicine to their fullest potential. No, this was the kind that scraped at bones and souls, the kind that was drawn from deep caves and high mountains.
“I could give that a try,” Ireni said. “The idea of being kind has never really appealed to me, but then again…people can change.”
Mike proposed to Molly in the middle of the night, when he woke up from a dream that involved licorice, pink elephants and a rather large tuba. To this day they can’t figure it out, but those all made their way into their wedding favours.
The whole place looked like luxurious relaxation. The sea was warmer here than on any of Florin’s coasts, the gulls flying overhead came to nest, and the Royal Family brought their entire retinue here once a year.
"We're married now," John explained. "And it's not that marriage itself changes it, it's just that we've committed today to being together forever, and we could, and this is something I never thought I would have."
Moriarty sneered at him, all hilarity gone from his face. "I want you to suffer, John Watson. I want Sherlock Holmes to suffer. You let him think he could be happy with anyone other than me, and he believed it."
Was she angry with him? Sally struggled with that one. It wasn’t the lack of crown that bothered her—the Carriers were all given a lovely house and ate as well as the royal family, if not with them. She had an education, pretty dresses, and a family that cared about her. No, she had never suffered for the material wants.
"The firsts have always been good, with you," Sherlock mused. His voice had dropped almost an octave. "I think we should make love now."
Fear seized Holmes as the deckhand came up to them. Could this man be trusted? Then a wig was removed, a mask slipped to the side and Stanley Hopkins stood there grinning. “Good evening Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson,” he said happily.
Holmes was the first one up the next day. He smiled as John snored next to him; he hadn’t lied to Billy exactly. He knew that John snored, but it never bothered him.
Watson's head was spinning. "I believe we should go to our room, Holmes. I may not know much about this...method, but if it's anything like the other a bed is infinitely more comfortable."
Moriarty sighed. “I knew you were going to be difficult. Well, time to pull out the big guns.” Surprisingly, he didn’t take out his gun.
They were in the rowboat again, after Grezzik had climbed down with the three of them strapped to him. They were slower going back, partly because of the extra people onboard, but London was approaching. Molly had knots in her stomach. Ireni had always made her feel that way, and now, when she’d returned from the dead…what did she want?
Moran was still tied to a chair, but he wasn’t exactly trying to get out. He was slumped in his bonds, the same position he’d been in since Stam had brought him up.
The worst night wasn't the last. The worst night was when Watson didn't recognize his husband and shouted for him, sobbing about the Falls, and Holmes was too weak to even reach a hand over, too weak to call out.
He was reclined on some sort of sofa, but the material was utterly unfamiliar. The clutter in the room was ridiculous—piles of unrelated objects on every surface but two chairs by the fire, a violin case propped against the windowsill, a strange box on the mantle.
“As did I, John.” Sherlock pulled away, looking intently into his eyes. “John, I thought this would keep you safe.”
“Listen to me very carefully, dear,” he said, slowly and calmly. “This is not your fault. This is my choice, and if I could make another one I would, but I can’t, so please…try to forgive me? I love you so much, Sherlock.” John swallowed hard. “You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me, and loving you was the best adventure I’ve ever had. And I’m sure I’ll see you again someday, somewhere. Just remember that no matter what, as long as part of me exists I will love you, alright? Even if that’s only in your memories.”
Holmes doesn’t know the word ‘demisexual’; he thinks asexuality is a plant trait, not a human one, and he considered himself a broken man for a long time. In the end he didn’t need the words to explain things; he got Watson instead.
"Hello," she said cheerfully. The twins ran to John, who picked them up and slung them over his shoulders. "How's everything going?"
The other man took it, shaking his head. “It is good to meet you, Dr. Watson. This is—well, it does beat all, doesn’t it?”
I find myself writing again as a continuation of the previous entry. Kitty Watson has found an excellent boarding-house and has made several friends. She has even acquired a job doing some typing for Scotland Yard (entirely on her own, I may add, and none the wiser so far as to her true identity). She visits at least once a week, and I have found myself caring for her as dearly as if she were my own niece. Sherlock adores her too, and has begun training her in the art of observation; she is a far better student than I could ever hope to be.
"Seven." Worse than a broken bone. When John used to get migraines they would last for days, but the pain rarely reached more than a four.
Knowing a task, however mundane, could keep Holmes grounded, Watson patiently talked the detective through the bandaging of the wound. It had been hastily bandaged at the Yard, but Watson hadn’t quite trusted the police doctor. Either way he knew that Holmes would have insisted on redoing it.
“You’re up, thank goodness! The hot plate just went.” Mrs. Hudson put the tray down and drew them both into a tight embrace. “I’ve been so worried. Is that reptile gone for good?”
Twenty years after Watson returned from the war, Holmes finds William Murray, the orderly who saved his life. Murray brings his son with him, named for the bravest and finest doctor he’s ever known. John Murray doesn’t understand why the Doctor cries.
friend- for so long that I’d forgotten that the part of you that lives inside my head, especially when I’m writing here, isn’t real, and that whoever you really are is still a mystery to me. There’s only one picture of you on the mantel that hasn’t been removed. It was of all three of us on a picnic I don’t remember, only a few months before you left. But everything else is gone, along with all the photos of Mrs H that Dad took down a few weeks ago. I can barely recall the wedding photo I used to stare up at every day from the living room rug. You’re so absent.
I cannot say that conversations with Dad have been wonderful. While more frequent, I don’t think either of us have fully adapted to the sudden influx in communication. But I don’t feel as isolated, and for once it’s like I’m not alone in facing the world.
It was dark and cold, like the weather had somehow appropriated the atmosphere of the wake. Or of me.
When the vicar asks for his child's name, he's about to announce it. Then Mary cuts in before he can say anything.
It’s almost tempting to take something from the cupboard and down the bottle at once. I’ve read -when I used to read- about the buzz, and how emptying it can feel, and it seems like maybe it would be such a relief to stop everything and be numb. Temporarily. Or forever.
When he notices the ring on her finger, he asks her who she's married to. She smiles, tells him it was to a lovely, tragic man.
After a wile Daddy stoped talking so I played with redberd instead and it was fun, I think Daddy was angry again because you didnt cume home when he was expeckting it like I was and so he was waiting until you came so he coold yel at you again. I dont want Daddy to yell again like he yeled at me when I broke the glars because that was scairy and I think you woold be sad if Daddy yeled at you like that because I was. I didnt mean to brake the glars and you dont mean to be away so I dont think Daddy shoold yell because it isnt nice.
In a completely unanticipated move - surprising, as Sherlock takes great care never to give into bodily impulses - he runs a tongue tip over Watson's teeth, finding the surface warm and smooth and somehow mesmerizing. As he leans in further, he finds himself moaning - an actual, full-bodied, rather embarrassing moan, and this is when he finally notices that John hasn't pushed him away for kissing him out of impulse, for enjoying the kiss fully because he figures it'll be the first and last chance he'll get to do so. Instead, John had closed his eyes and let it happen, leaning further over the side of the ridiculous hospital issue bed.
"Just a flesh wound?" Watson sprang up, walking to the side of his partner's head in two short strides. "Just a
The other is her second father, Sherlock Holmes. He's mysterious and brooding - she rather likes that word, and she's fairly convinced she's the only girl in her class to know what it means - towards clients and officers alike, but never to her. To her, he's smiling and clever and the most incredible person she knows. She wants to be just like Sherlock when she's older, and she's getting there, she knows. She can recite several lines from the periodic table, and her skills of deduction are improving every day, he says, and whenever she says something particularly smart he beams at her as though she's done something amazing. He is not John Watson - he is perceptive but clueless in the way of feelings, and he cannot always say the right thing like Daddy. But Dad is something else, someone very special, and she loves him for it.
"Consulting detective, actually. An easy mistake, really, but he can be very particular about it." The thought of Sherlock Holmes, deerstalker and all, made the blonde smile.
"Want da," repeated Rosie unhelpfully. Frowning, the consulting detective came a few steps closer, and Molly unceremoniously dropped the young girl into his arms without a hitch. The child instantly grew quiet, lightly pounding on Sherlock's chest as though it were an interesting new toy.
"He's an idiot. He got it wrong when he called me the brilliant one, back when we first met - clearly he didn't realize how brilliant he was." Sherlock blinked, scouring his memories briefly. "He still doesn't see it, some days. But he stays, anyways." Mycroft stared at him. No condemnation, no joy, no twitch or give in his movements. For once, Mycroft was the superimposed British government - cold, analytical, and absolutely unreadable. This made him dangerous.
"Of course I do. I can't miss one of your matches. When you become famous, you better send me tickets, alright?"
Sometimes Lestrade would accompany - Mrs. Hudson, too, once or twice, but mainly Lestrade. Molly still hasn't decided where to place him in the grand scheme of things. She adores him - he's a wonderful companion, kind, and genuine, and that's far more than what she could say for most of the other men she's encountered - but has no idea what to make of his presence. She loves being around him, and hanging out with him and Rosie while Watson and Holmes were away was great, but she can never quite decipher her feelings on the matter.
But eventually, as they are simple organisms at their heart of hearts and they require oxygen for biological sustainment purposes - how dull - they end up pulling away, gasping for air. John's lips are puffy in a way that they haven't been in years, since long before his wife died, and it gives the detective an inexplicable wellspring of pride to know that he was the one kissing Watson senseless.
"Of course, Rosamund." It's a promise the boisterous and far too clever five year old will hold him to, he knows, but it's one he's willing to keep.
"It's a contact sport," the blonde explained to her unofficial aunt one day as they went shopping for bras, something Moll would definitely not trust the boys to handle. She loved her friends fiercely, but Sherlock would almost instantly blurt out some fact about the materials or the fit that would make the whole affair unbearable and John would simply feel awkward the entire time, and thus she had wordlessly volunteered to buy the garments herself. "And I think that the exercise would be beneficial, and I could get an additional scholarship to university if I'm any good. The female teams have less people to pull from, after all, and it's a way to meet new girls my age, anyhow. Perhaps the constant running will give me practice if I ever decide to take up the family business."
"John . . . " Predictably, the detective lost that battle and ended up snatching the glass from his partner's hands in a fit of annoyance. Lestrade shot Molly a glance that said 'you're seeing this, right?' while they bickered.
So this was the bulky first installment of the ending scenes. I'm trying to do the conclusion justice and I really hope I'm succeeding thus far, even if it is total fluff at the moment. Sorry, by the way, if it seems overly sappy. I just wanted to produce something happy, as it's universally acknowledged that for every one happy conclusion there is a dozen ones off screen that aren't nearly so good. Real life isn't nearly as kind to its characters as the media would like to let us believe, but here is my little corner of sanity. I can do as I please, and so I choose to give them something sweet, something reasonably intelligent and intriguing but without the pitfall. It's not so much a 'happily ever after' as it is the promise that they lived, and that's sometimes better. After all, normal is boring.
Then Molly realized how cramped the available seating was behind her, how the men would have to be practically breathing down eachother's necks on this cold evening in order to sit together, and then a lot of things made perfect sense.
In less than five minutes, both girls had gathered their essentials - phones, wallets, credentials, a set of lock picks, a revolver and a pocket knife, so yes, the run-of-the-mill necessities - and were trampling downstairs.
"I have. And one day, you're going to be far better than even him." And really, if Rosie blushed in the back of the darkened cab while they rounded the corner, that was nobody's business.
"You sound surprised. Perhaps all the sugar you consume on a daily basis is finally giving you a stroke."
It's clear, to those who knew where to look, that Sherlock Holmes was letting his guard down for once, allowing the world to know he was smitten as opposed to stashing away his feelings, and John Watson was just as pleased. Of course, it was easy to follow and observe this change in dynamic - many of them had guessed at its romantic inclination over the years, and the fact that it was just now coming to light did little to affect that fundamental. However, their efforts to 'take things slowly' or 'keep it under wraps' seemed to pale, due to this longstanding commitment, but this was their business. Let them handle romanticisms how they will.
After two hours, she looked out Mrs. Hudson's flat's window, wondering whether or not the boys upstairs were aware that it was growing darker.
"I like asking you to come over when they leave. It's nice, spending time with my aunt." And damn it all if that wasn't such a good answer. Molly nearly cried for no reason.
There is a murderer at large - isn't there always, though, in this crime-riddled city - and he's been pouring over the case files for the last half hour. His Watson (Watson-
Even Rosamund's intense prying couldn't shake their matching grins, though, and as she fires questions at them, John and Sherlock exchange glances in an unspoken communication. Molly can't tell if they're bemused or annoyed or, just possibly, a healthy mix of both, but reading people has never been her strong suit. She will leave that to them.
"Sherlock . . . " John pulled back to look at him, searching his face for something unreadable. Sherlock, for once, was incapable of thinking anything. John had never subjected him to such scrutiny before, and certainly not this late - even full nights of sleep, something he had come to see the usefulness if not the enjoyment in, were rare, and he would often climb in and out of bed at three hour intervals. Actually staying in bed, being wrapped around his partner and slipping into unconsciousness long enough to become drowsy before reawakening, was new. The detective was not accustomed to so many irregularities at once. "You never said it out loud, you know."
Rosamund didn't consider herself an expert on the human condition. How could she be, at only thirteen? And although she adored that age - not too young to be treated like a child, not too old to be underestimated, which was often a great asset, and a prime number, made for mathematical appreciation - it didn't come with the perks a long, lucrative life did, such as wisdom. Humanities alluded her, though general cleverness couldn't. While this may be true, however, she was a fair sight more observant than the majority of the population thanks to her upbringing, and that came with sensibilities that would have otherwise flown over her head.
The detective is entirely certain that this cannot be. It contradicts everything he's known to be true about himself in relation to others; he recognizes that he is careless with word choice and very good at offending people, makes great messes all around his flat and would be swimming in filth had it not been for his roommate and Mrs. Hudson, is prone to the insatiable and the dramatic when it comes to annoyance, and has a very nasty habit of driving everyone in a thousand foot radius far, far away with his general disposition. Sherlock is not compatible with the world, nor its inhabitants, and this has simply been a fact of life before John and those who followed.
"You're both okay, right girls?" Greg asked, worry leaking into his tone. "You said you undermined a vicious plot to produce forgeries of plays?"
"She thinks I'm her dad?" the detective asked in wonderment, staring at his best friend's child. John, after a brief minute, grinned softly.
It's odd, trying to get your fathers, the men who raised you side by side, to fall in love, but their family was never anything less than odd, anyhow. And this really would tie up so many loose ends nicely. John and Sherlock already shared the same room and had a common job and routine, and her dad already admitted that he loved her father, so half the work was done. And the tall, brooding - yes, it really was such a wonderful word,
) because she never got to miss it, but perhaps this was all because Molly made sure that she wouldn't have to go without anything. Molly is safe, and loving, and
" - this couldn't have been an original manuscript," Rosamund completed, face brightening. "Do you know what this means?"
"Of course I am, idiot, what would make you think otherwise?" The relief across Watson's face was palpable.
Frankly, the brunette had just finished an excruciatingly long shift at work, walked back home through an unexpected fit of rain, accidentally emptied her take out onto her feet when she opened the flimsy styrofoam container, and she had been called over to 221B Baker Street in a matter of 'utmost importance', according to Sherlock, immediately after changing clothes.
After one hour of watching Rosamund assemble and re-assemble a puzzle, she was starting to yawn again.
"I was wondering . . . " Sherlock Holmes set down his newspaper as Rosamund stood next to his chair, gazing at him with intent.
Sentiment. A peculiar instinct, he knows, but some things are not meant to be evenly cut and dry. Some things are simply inexplicable, like how people appreciate John's damned blog, why Molly puts up with their antics repeatedly, and if the police force is purposefully dumbing themselves down in order to keep his slot as consulting detective open - it's mind blowing, how oblivious Lestrade's team can be, most days.
In the meantime, it is large and bulky and inordinate, as well as unnecessary. He had grown used to 'Holmes' - it had an acceptable atmosphere of mystery while still being solid, relatively brief and to the point, and easy for most people, the imbeciles they may be, to spell. However, he did not need to be called 'Watson-Holmes' in order to officiate his marriage. Everyone they interact with already knows that he belongs to John, anyways, so there was little use in adapting his given name.
John, as in all things, strained at the confines of these new rules. He invaded house and meals and work and even, eventually, the detective's bed, bringing a child along with him. It was Watson's fault, though, in the end. The doctor was just
But she’d been delayed several seconds. Several seconds, just long enough for the Count to grab a sharp, three sided dagger and be ready.
“Am I? You’ve beaten my giant which means that you’re strong, and therefore would risk putting poison in your own goblet, which means that I cannot choose the wine in front of you. But you also bested Maria, which means you must have studied, and in studying you would have found out that man is mortal, which means I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me!”
Then Waverly screamed. Grezzik bent forward immediately, worried that they might be the kind of ants that bite. To his horror, he saw that the ants were catching fire one by one, all down the line.
That was all he ever said, “as you wish.” No matter how unreasonable the request. He even wrote the name of the flower when he presented Sherlock with the bouquet.
“That’s your only option, if you don’t want war.” Riley smiled. “Sherlock, at least, knows how important Seb and I are to Jamiarty. Why do you think he sent us? It would be harder for him to argue if he sent Lord Woodley or Lady Hope. They aren’t that close. Come now, Princess, don’t be stupid.”
Then the man in black cut under her Agrippa, and Maria started. She’d worked hard on that defense. She backed away, switching techniques, but the man in black’s dancing blades kept finding weaknesses, kept pushing her backwards. Backwards towards the Cliff’s edge.
To his surprise Holmes narrowed his eyes and pushed so that Watson was pressed against the wall of the cottage. "I suppose I'll think of something, won't I?"
elp John and Sherlock with their private cases. Stan calls it double-dating. Greg calls the Holmes’ a bad influence.
Billy didn't bother to knock, and simply burst into the room, nearly tripping Mrs. Hudson in his haste. "Hello!"
“I found this when I first arrived,” Lestrade admitted. “And I wanted to look for you; I wasn’t sure if you were dead yet but even when I knew you were I…I couldn’t find the courage.”
Then the song changed into a lilting, waltzing melody after a dinner and chase of a criminal, played by a man fairly giddy with joy and a sense of pure rightness, that for once he belonged with someone. Someone so remarkable as his flatmate, the best man he'd ever known.
Greg laughed. “Of course he is. This is going to be brilliant.” He paused. “Congratulations, by the way.”
It was nearing midnight now—nearing dawn in London—but John no longer felt tired. He felt curiously invigorated, like the time difference hadn't mattered.
I have to. We have no time, and I won’t let anyone languish in there any longer. They don't have Stam."
“It is in the eyes of our society,” Watson reminded him. “But that…that fear is nothing compared to what I lived with for years.”
Raz, looking weary and angry, was standing at a desk, flipping through a dusty book. The pages were edged with silver—a legal book, then.
“That leaves the Sicilian Crowd,” Ireni crowed. Her smile faltered when Grezzik and Molly looked at her. “What? It was a good name. We can go to the South and find the King and Queen. Do we know where the Palace is?”
He knew he’d have to say it again, maybe a thousand times before John would believe it, but he’d say it every day for the rest of their lives if he had to.
“Damn it, Jefferson!” Lord Gruner snarled. “Get that foul-smelling—” Then it hit him too. “Jamiarty? Are you a father?”
"He's going to be completely incomprehensible at first," John warned. "I'll translate as best as I can."
The day that Watson told her about his love for Holmes he was on morphine from a stabbing, and he doesn’t remember. Mrs. Hudson immediately hunted down the detective and demanded he take care of her boy. She also begins a rumour that gives Holmes a mistress, which few believe but it gives Watson a good laugh.
When they got there Greg opened the door for them and John helped Sherlock out. The night was fair for once, and you could almost see the stars, but John didn't comment on that. Greg looked at him a bit helplessly.
Watson drew him close again, his own arms shaking with the force of his fear. “I’m here, Sherlock.” It was all he could say. “I’m here, and I love you. Let me feel your pain, let me take it on myself. Let me give you comfort.”
“You are wonderful!” Maria exclaimed. It was all she could do to keep him from cutting her, all she could do to keep her blade moving. It was
He dropped to his knees and placed his hands on the young woman’s shoulders. She was still asleep, her wail getting shriller.
“I won’t kill you,” the count said. “You’re very brave. But I will give you a reminder to respect your betters.”
“I thought it was a few weeks later,” John said quietly. “We did a raid close to Florin, and one of the treasures was an engagement ring. I questioned one of the sailors and he described…well, you. Said it was for the Prince’s bride to be, who loved him beyond measure. And I believed…oh, my dear, I’m sorry, I believed the worst of you. I just—I’m—”
When Molly Hooper was twenty eight, her Dad was diagnosed, too late for any treatment to make a difference. Molly went home and looked after him with her Mum, arranging for the most beautiful flowers she could find for the funeral when it was over. She thought about changing her name back to Mary—after all, she must be grown-up enough now, but she hadn’t had the courage to ask Dad and after all, she was much more used to being Molly.
“And who are they going to believe?” Janine asked, her voice like silk. “A Prince that no one loves, or the word of several honourable men and women?”
“Move?” Sherlock said in a daze. Trembling, he reached his hands up, put them on John’s shoulders. They were solid, real, his hands didn’t go through them as they often did. “You’re alive. If you want I can fly.”
“I checked the birth announcements,” Sherlock said. “Sally’s birth was included twenty-five years ago. No father was named, but the announcement was written in the king’s own hand.”
Somehow Mycroft Holmes had gone from the-posh-man-with-a-brolly to brother, and if the man was unaware, John had always been good at explaining the obvious to geniuses.
After supper they went into the sitting room. Billy deliberately took one chair and threw his feet up on the other, barely managing to reach. It left his grandfathers on the sofa. Billy sighed as they sat on opposite sides of the sofa, doing everything they could not to touch.
The Zoo of Death was designed by Prince Jamiarty and his most trusted ally, Count Magnussen. It had five floors underground, each with its own category of prey that could be released at the whim of the Prince. Floor one were creatures of great strength; floor two contained creatures of great speed. Floor three (the first without windows) had creatures of the night, for when Jamiarty had insomnia. Floor four were poisonous creatures, especially spiders. Prince Jamiarty loved spiders; they were his official crest.
“Then why…” Holmes struggled to articulate what he meant. “We have new worry lines, but we do not worry as much. And that is correct, but I worry…I worry deeply about the consequences of this love, John. Why do I appear less anxious?”
Watson kissed the top of his head. “Dear boy, we will miss you. But we’ll see you again someday. And I expect many stories, you understand?” He drew back. “The cottage goes to your parents, Billy, but my garden is yours.”
“Ah, little brother.” Mycroft was dressed in ceremonial robes. “May I present Princess Janine of Guilder.”
“I love you,” Sherlock said at last. “And sometimes I’m worried—I’m worried that it’s just the dream. That it was all that made you care.”
Moran held up a scroll. “Prince Jamiarty has drafted this royal announcement, that Princess Sherlock’s true love came back in the end, and the Prince let him go with blessings upon their love. He also discovered that the Princess was not kidnapped by warriors of Guilder, and that the kidnappers are all dead. He would like your approval.”
“And we need to do it smartly.” Philip tapped his arm. “Sherlock, you and I could go to Florin. If we keep Moran and Riley here, it should be safe enough, and I can disguise you.”
Now...there will be a sequel, but it'll probably take a couple of months to go up, because I don't post unfinished work. I'll give updates on my progress (when there's any to speak of) on tumblr, so keep an eye out!
Sherlock led him into the room where they’d looked over their first dead body together. The room was empty other than a bright light clearly nicked from Scotland Yard and a chair with a folded up newspaper on it.
Greg’s never been too keen on sex (that was part of his troubles with his ex-wife). To his relief, Mycroft isn’t either. When they do sleep together, it’s passionate and loving and everything it’s supposed to be…but honestly, one time can hold them for months.
Watson was the farm boy. He was a slave, an orphan his parents had taken in to work the fields since it was clear that their precious
“She is not our concern,” Grezzik replied. He was trying to keep his voice calm; Waverly was scared, and he didn’t want to scare her even more. “Riley, we will let you go. You can build a life far away from here, on your own terms. We won’t come after you. You have my word.”
To his alarm, tears started rolling down Kitty's cheeks. "I want to believe you," she sobbed. "I want to, I do, why can't I?"
“Sherlock?” John sounded utterly surprised, and Holmes didn’t blame him. He’d never done that before. He did it again, and John placed his hand over Holmes’. “I slept well, yes.”
“Nothing, love. Nothing.” John kissed him again. “I’m…I’m so happy. I’ve loved you so long, and I never thought you’d hear me.”
“We have to get them out,” Sherlock said when he could speak. “Jamiarty knows that one of them must be Carla or Sally’s mother.”
"There's a traveller's store in the main Square," Ireni said. "I've been to it before. Just buy traveller packs for everyone."
It took a long time to get to Angelo’s by foot, but they managed it before close. Angelo smiled when he came up to them. “Table for two, boys?”
Mycroft Holmes gestured to the chairs, waiting until Watson took a seat to sit down himself. “That, I’m afraid, was a falsehood on my part. The necessary evidence has already been collected by Scotland Yard.”
John discovered he was bi because of a boy named Victor Trevor. He never shares the story with Sherlock, or he would know that Sherlock solved his murder.
He left Maria covered by his Brute’s cloak and went hunting for buckets. He filled one with icy cold water, and heated a kettle near to boiling to fill the other. Then, as gently as he could, Grezzik began dunking Molly’s head, first in one bucket, then another, making sure he gave her two seconds in between to breathe.
“It's the only way.” Mycroft's voice was gruffer than usual, and John wondered if the Iceman was actually moved. “Moriarty won't rest until he's destroyed Sherlock completely. Once he believes that done, he won't suspect our next moves. You must keep up a strong act, John.”
But then Watson beckoned to her, and Kitty's heart broke when she heard him ask, "can we see the children one last time?"
They climbed on and on, and the distance started to close between the four of them and the strange, silent man in black. Sherlock closed his eyes. He wasn’t sure who he wanted to win. He definitely didn’t want to fall.
Holmes took the basin from her and set it on the night stand. Removing his waistcoat, he tore at his shirt until he had a long bandage. Ignoring Mrs. Hudson’s squawk, Holmes wet the bandage and approached the bed.
“No need to be snappish.” John took a deep breath. “I’ve felt you afraid, Sherlock. Remember when we were hiding in that closet two months ago?” It was so small they’d stayed pressed together for hours, waiting for their target to fall asleep in their stupidly large mansion. Not that John had particularly minded.
But why not make the guest room a regular bedroom? Was it because of him, or his parents? Billy wouldn’t mind sleeping on the sofa, and Mum and Dad could get rooms in the village—it wasn’t that far, after all.
“I don’t know if I’ll be a very good husband,” Holmes admitted as he reached out for his lover’s hand. “But if you’ll give me the chance I’d be grateful.”
John cleared his throat. “Sherlock, I can offer you only my promise to be your partner in all our life together, whether we are hunting criminals or cleaning the bookcases. I love you…more than words can say.” He put Holmes’ ring on, voice thick with tears.
Grezzik shook his head again. There was fire on all sides now, and he wanted to scream with hopelessness. He wasn’t afraid of the pain of burns, but Waverly…could she survive that?
"It'll take some getting used to," David said kindly, "but you can enjoy yourselves fully now. You can do whatever you want and feel completely in the moment."
It had been a blessedly quiet, slightly frustrating month. No crazy spiels of deduction, no awkward 'they're-kissing-behind-the-crime-scene again' moments, but also not nearly as much progress on the more baffling cases. Some would say that the detectives were well due back, but nearly everyone was a little fearful. What would post-honeymoon Sherlock Holmes and John Watson look like? Act like?
Holmes stomped up all seventeen stairs and opened the door with a bang. Watson looked up, startled. “Hello, Holmes, what on Earth?”
Holmes had already dashed up the stairs and Watson took a moment to prepare himself. The last six months had seen great progress in his quest to wean Holmes off the needles, but this kind of case, and the horrible ending were exactly the kind of events that promised a setback.
And since his mother was busy ignoring her children and his father was busy arguing with his wife, they agreed to make Watson do the work.
Two of the soldiers grabbed John and began to tie his hands behind his back. John barely noticed the pain as they wrenched his shoulder. He was looking at something else.
“And France is allied to neither side,” John said. “Which means she can settle in and they won’t ask questions.”
A wave of remorse swept over Billy. He was trying to trick them, but he hadn’t done anything to show that they…well, that they were safe. After all the times they’d protected him!
The rest of that night, long hours in the dark, passed slowly. Quiet, broken reassurances, and careful kisses were exchanged. Watson didn’t let go of Holmes, and Holmes didn’t let go of Watson.
Ireni laughed. “You only think I guessed wrong, that’s what’s funny! I switched glasses while your back was turned! You fell victim to one of the classic blunders. The most famous is never get involved in a land war in Asia. But only slightly less well known is this: never go in against a Sicilian, when death is on the line!”
“Watching you get to enjoy our family…being so open, not being afraid…I’ve never seen you quite this happy. This free. And I was thinking about how lucky we are that we got this in the first place…”
His surprise deepened to see a Christmas tree in the corner, partly decorated with baubles. There were two wrapped packages underneath, one quite small and the other large. Out of habit, Holmes began to deduce what they were, then stopped. Watson wouldn't have wrapped them if he'd wanted Sherlock to know what they were.
Interesting. They hadn't seen the girl, which was peculiar. It was quite dark, but there were streetlights still, and someone climbing down (or up? still wasn't positive on that point) a building should have been noticed. But on the other hand, there were no sirens, no yelling outside other than Andrew, and if it wasn't for the broken window he wouldn't have guessed there was anything amiss outside.
Anderson joined Sherlock, and suddenly they were separated, all of them, into three groups. Three chances, three quests to bring Jamiarty to justice for good. Sherlock could almost see the delicate balance between them, the knowledge that failure meant not only the death of their hopes, but possibly the death of the group. The deaths of people who were family now.
But he couldn’t swim back even though he wanted to, because an Eel was charging him, and there was nowhere to run, and the wail nearly pierced his eardrum—
Sherlock rolled back, away from the Snow Sand. He looked back to see an enormous rat leap at John and bury its teeth in his right shoulder.
The voice was familiar, but Watson couldn’t distinguish it, muffled by the fog as it was. A thought struck him. Could it be...?
“She died on the road. She was buried at the palace, but because the King was married, he didn’t want to hurt his wife with his by-blow, even if she was born before their marriage. He asked the gardener to bury her, and tell no one about her resting place.”
“I believe they’re returning from Regalia, aren’t they?” Uncle Mycroft asked. “John wanted to see the caves.”
on John’s laptop. That was all they could do, because the Internet seemed to be down. Sherlock explained that he didn’t feel like fixing it, and they had all of those discs, so why not?
“No, Sherlock.” Mycroft's voice was sharp with alarm. “I was calling to inquire why the good doctor abandoned the plan of joining me here. I thought he went with you.”
Molly watched in horror as Jamiarty changed, as he started to fight his chains with vigor, his face stretched in a horrible grimace.
I was worried about this one, since explicitness isn't really my thing, but I realized that it was an important time to cover, so thanks again to merlynnllwyd for the request.
John bustled around the kitchen, trying to finish the last of the food amongst Sherlock’s latest experiment. “You’d better clean this up, love.”
But he was swooping up, and up, and he still felt warm, and he could feel Waverly in his arms. Had she died too?
“Spring is eternal in our hearts,” Janine retorted, making a fist above her heart. “Besides, we needed cloaks. We’ve got quite a few dignitaries among us.”
Watson didn't look entirely convinced. He stood, pulling Holmes up with him. "Go to bed, Sherlock. Christmas can wait until we've had some sleep."
"Have you ever been scared?" Billy asked, wide eyed. His grandfathers were brave and clever—surely they'd never be afraid.
Holmes looked him directly in the eye. "Of course I wondered about it. I decided I didn't care. And you?"
I joined him at the window, watching the two walk down the street, walking so close they almost seemed to be one figure.
One last time, MAJOR CHARACTER DEATH. This is pt. 1, and if you want to wait until pt.2 is up tomorrow, feel free to do so.
Though he never talks about, Watson sometimes wishes he could have taken Holmes’ name. Then Holmes will say ‘Watson’ with the same tenderness he uses in the rare moments he says ‘John’, and he’ll change his mind.
“Of course.” Sally fumbled with the strap. “Her name is Waverly,” she added as she laid the child in Queen Bella’s arms.
It was still child’s play once he got inside. The secret passage off the scullery led directly to the library. Perhaps some king or queen in times gone by was a voracious reader, and wanted easy access for servants and food while they read.
I'm sure some of you have caught this, but Jamiarty's first murder is inspired by Moriarty's first murder in the show, when he was ten.
“We’re fine, your Highness.” Sherlock put his arm around John. “He didn’t succeed with us, anyways.”
Once everyone was seated, they started to ride. John had removed his over shirt to make a bandage for Molly’s wound, and his bare arms were almost glowing in the moonlight. Sherlock traced the scars on them; some old, and some so recent they broke his heart.
“That’s how it is when you love people, Ireni,” Molly said. “It makes you happy when they’re happy, when you can give them things.”
This Saturday night was being spent at the Yard's spring party. Why was this party being held? John couldn't tell you. Greg had sent them a text, and they were going. That was all Sherlock would say.
There was a deathly silence in the chapel. The shouting had stopped outside, and no one clapped. No one said a word.
“Jamiarty, Jamiarty, Jamiarty!” Martha cried, beginning to chase Miracle Max around the room, who had his hands over his ears. “Jamiarty, and he’s the reason you’re letting true love die!”
John shuddered. That was it, that was the piece they hadn't considered. “It was me,” he whispered. “This whole time, you've been targeting me.”
“I swear it will be done,” Prince Jamiarty said. He gestured to Sherlock. “I apologize, my love. I thought he was your captor. But of course, he is free to go. Thank you, sailor, for saving my precious darling.”
Jamiarty shook his head sadly. “Too soon, angel. Perhaps tomorrow? It will take at least that long.”
and Molly and Mike brought fresh flowers from their garden, strewing them everywhere in the room. Stan had gone shopping with John to find the perfect suit…and Greg had taken over, which meant that Stan looked halfway decent. Sherlock hadn’t said anything about Kitty’s dress, just that it was taken care of.
Holmes took Watson's hand and kissed it. “If I am worth remembering at all, John, it is because of you, you and your insistent need to show me my own humanity. That gift alone is worth more than a thousand titles.”
Grezzik blinked a few times, but it was definitely a bird. Large enough that he sat comfortably on its back. It was bright red, its feathers shining in the sunlight, and was clearly carrying them to the top.
It wasn’t really Mycroft, Sherlock’s older brother, general stick-in-the-mud and awkward dinner conversationalist that came in, though. This was the Duke of London, and one of his people—his youngest subject, in fact—had been taken. He was furious.
Mycroft stifled a smile. Kitty’s children had inherited their mother’s spirit and their father’s earnest, innocent eyes. It was a powerful combination.
When their daughter Martha died at three months from the influenza that swept the city, Mary was almost relieved when she woke up with a deep ache in her bones as well as her heart.
“Excellent point,” John agreed, not letting go of Sherlock’s hand. “Right let’s say this—we’re both willing. We should probably do some tests of our own, make sure that both of us are able.”
But it didn’t matter, Holmes realized, and he could tell John knew it too. They were married now because they loved each other and they had a family who loved them enough to make a special effort to see them together. That was more than enough proof that it had happened.
Without question, John's life started going odd again the moment a girl came crashing through the front window.
“You just saved Grezzik and Waverly from falling.” Molly kicked Riley’s shoulder. The kidnapper was stretched out along the bottom of the boat.
Three days ago Hopkins asked the two of us—dear fellow, he knows what we are—for Kitty’s hand in marriage. It is rather sudden, but Hopkins promises that they will not wed straight away. “I just want her to know that I love her and will forever,” he said earnestly. Of course, Sherlock and I agreed, provided that Kitty herself assents. Sherlock considers that a foregone conclusion.
There was someone waiting for them at the dock, someone John had honestly never expected to see again.
But Grandfather Sherlock kept looking sideways at Billy. Billy tried to smile back, but he knew something was wrong.
“Goodnight, Waverly.” Grezzik kissed the baby’s head, and handed her back to her mother. “I will come and wake you in the morning, Sally.”
The count came back the next day. “It’s alright. Not worth the two hundred I promised. I’ll give you a quarter.”
Watson took a clean rag from a pile by the door—old shirts, Sherlock noticed. He wiped the blood from Sherlock’s foot, then wound the rag around it, tying it carefully. “Not too tight, right?”
Sherlock was befuddled. He glanced at Mycroft, hoping he would have answers, but Mycroft looked confused for the first time in his life.
“I will. We’ll all be home, and we can sort out all this mess.” Molly squeezed her lover one last time, smiled at Sally and Anderson encouragingly, and turned to Grezzik.
“And what about when you promised your group that you would make sure they got back, no matter what it cost you?”
And here we have the first part of John and Sherlock's wedding! It's a day early to mark the 2 year anniversary of the first gay marriages in the UK. I'll update every other day for the next three chapters since they're all connected. Cheers, and happy reading!
Sherlock kissed him. “It’s perfect,” he said when he let John go. “I just don’t totally understand yet.”
That bothered him, but he couldn’t let it. If he did, he would start to panic, and he couldn’t panic…
Just as an aside, all migraines are different, and you should definitely not take medicine without consulting someone other than a fanfiction writer, but the remedy John gives Sherlock (Gravol instead of the Cinnarizine, I'm in Canada, eh) as well as the migraine symptoms are typical for my migraines.
John shook his head, not bothering to wipe his tears. “Give my love to everyone. Goodbye, Sherlock.”
Eventually Molly wriggled away, her hair dripping. “That’s ENOUGH!” She shouted. Her eyes were clearer now, and there was a fire in them Grezzik hadn’t seen in quite a while. “Where is he?
There was something about the promise in his voice that made John shiver. He did his best not to show it, but by the amused look in Sherlock's eyes he hadn't succeeded.
An almost immediate response: Good. Moriarty en route. Go to a bar and text Lestrade. He'll provide good cover.—SH.
“You’re not stupid, love.” John pressed a kiss into his damp curls. “That had to be one hell of a drug to knock you over. If anything, we should be grateful, because if it was me I don’t think we would have noticed anything unusual.”
Sherlock winced. “That's why I'm telling you now. I'm trusting you, John, you have to keep this a secret.”
What on earth was wrong with his grandfathers sharing a room? They were best mates, after all. And they were getting older, so wouldn’t it make sense? If they were sick or something? (Billy pushed the idea violently aside—his grandfathers weren’t that old, were they?) Anyways, the cottage was small, and they needed room for the study, for a guest room…
“Honestly, love, I’m not sure what the problem is. You know we’re all safe, you know that we have the upper hand…”
And the woman did, and screeched louder, in defiance of the past, of the horrible dark moments where she'd known, not thought,
"I ran. But I couldn't get away forever. All of a sudden no pimp wanted me, no escort service, nothing. I kept getting chased through the streets by his goons. Finally he called me, said we were finished now but I could work for him if I liked. And I went back to him." Suddenly Kitty looked up, and her eyes were burning fire. "But I've not once stopped trying to find a way to ruin him like he's ruined me. And now he's got my friend, and I will be damned if I let him hurt her!"
“I don’t believe so,” Mycroft said carefully. “Goodness knows Louis the Fiftieth believes in the Right of the Crown, but he values France’s neutrality, especially if all of us support the action. And if we can prove the murder…”
Sherlock shrieked—really shrieked, the way Mrs. Hudson did when they watched horror movies. He slammed the door shut and yanked John back ten feet.
“Watson—well, the Dr. Watson I’ve known—he’s explained bits of it. I understand your marriage was out in the open?”
"Then let's go to bed," Sherlock said, his deep voice carrying a new note, the same promise from the party but made much stronger. "There are many ways of showing love in the…
"No," Ireni said, and her eyes softened. "You won't be able to do anything with them until the spell ends, but we can get there quickly."
“And then at the end of that year, Roberts called me into his room in the morning. I was sure that was it; he’d been more than fair. But he closed the door quite carefully, and told me his greatest secret. ‘I am not the Dread Pirate Roberts. My name is Murray.’”
“I don’t think they’ll let that happen,” Jamiarty mused. “No, I think it might be best to keep that a secret. Just comment on how lovely the baby is and leave. Then I can send a message expressing my shock and disbelief at your report.” He looked at Riley. “You can control yourself, right?”
“Woohoo!” Miracle Max rushed to a shelf and crammed on a hat that looked as old as he was. “That’s what I call a noble cause!”
Watson reached forward and Holmes uncrossed his arms, holding his hands out from habit. Watson took them, his face completely serious. It was a very different kind of intensity in his eyes now.
“We’re going to stay in, order Chinese for lunch and Thai for supper, watch crap telly, catch up on Cabin Pressure and invite Mycroft, Greg, Molly and Mike over for tea.”
“He’s the nice one, isn’t he, Grandfather Sherlock?” Rachel asked, preoccupied for the moment with a picture book.
“If the princess isn’t legitimate, it might not matter what Jamiarty has done,” Queen Chessa warned. “She’ll need to be the Heir.”
The plan was perfect, of course. Mycroft's people were going to have a difficult job proving that 'Richard Brook'—Rich Brook, Reichenbach, aren't you so clever Jim—wasn't real, but the damage done to Sherlock's reputation was going to be harder still. Even though this was Sherlock and Mycroft's plan (though Moriarty didn't know it yet), John could see the pain in Sherlock's face as Kitty gloated.
When Molly Hooper was thirty, she met Sherlock Holmes, who was plenty exciting and not at all romantic. Still, that was half the equation, which seemed to satisfy her heart, and she helped him as much as she could, hoping that he would think she was good enough.
Holmes stared at him, stunned and Watson laughed. “I would never have known it!” he said, shaking his head. He glanced up into the sails. “I see you now though, Wiggins! Who’s that with you?”
“Darling,” she called out, loud as anything, “why don’t you go and fetch your brothers? We should have a family party.”
Stan is hired by the Foreign Office during the Great War. It’s enough to keep him from the battlefield, and he knows he owes his life to the last deed of an old, childless man trying to save his brother heartache.
The line of fire grew, and Grezzik watched it stop at the feet of an unfamiliar statue. The statue moved, and it was a living woman who stepped forward along the line.
“If I’d seen you,” Sherlock interrupted, “I would have explained. But we can’t live on ifs, John. We’re together now, and everything’s going to be fine.”
Sherlock put a hand on John’s arm. “Anderson, John’s right. If you don’t talk to each other, you’ll begin to drift apart. Life will give you reasons to separate, don’t make up reasons of your own.”
Sherlock joined him next to the girl, who was now trying to raise herself to her knees. John bent and picked her up bodily, holding firmly even as she struggled. "Now, now, you don't want to get yourself more cut up than you already are." He half-carried, half-dragged the girl to the couch, placing her down as gently as he could. Sherlock had followed, and he now perched on the chair, frowning at her.
“And...what? Say that again? We want this to happen?” John glanced between the brothers. “Funny, because I don't want that. Did 'we' discuss this when I was at work?” He was trying to keep his tone light and failing miserably, because Mycroft looked sympathetic now and Sherlock wasn't meeting his eyes and dear God something was wrong, something was horribly wrong...
Sherlock called John again—twenty seven times, but who was counting—and listened to it ring, his heart pounding in his chest. Nothing. Still nothing.
“He’s out looking for feverfew,” Martha explained in a low voice. “She’s getting much hotter than I like.”
Yes, I know there's some overlap in what people are finding out, but that's what happens when you split the party :)
From a distance, he heard the sound of footsteps…heard shouting…was that someone calling his name? John opened his eyes and looked up. “I think they found me?”
Sherlock reached out hesitantly to touch John's face. “I knew it would be awful for you,” he admitted, “but I tried to tell myself that you thinking I was dead was better than me really being dead. Or you being...either is unacceptable.”
“No,” John said firmly. Greg wasn’t surprised. “Sherlock said I could have what I wanted—I’m fairly certain he’d be willing to rent Buckingham Palace—but I just want something small.”
“I couldn’t stay,” Molly said. Her arm was around Janine’s waist still, and Janine was playing with her loose hair. “I had to find Count Magnussen.”
The baby’s skin was just as dark as Kitty’s but her eyes were teal, the same shape as John’s—and oddly enough, Stan’s as well. And her curls…if John didn’t know better he could have sworn they came from Stan as well.
Then the violin itself fell silent for years, kept in a case, holding the secrets of the weeping visitor and the absent master alike. The song followed the master wherever he went, haunting him, strengthening his resolve to return and put it to rest, one way or another.
“What do you…want?” Sherlock gasped, more from shock and fear than exhaustion. “If you want ransom, I give you my word you’ll have it if you let me go.”
It had gone brutally, quickly downhill from there. They couldn't work together; it was as simple as that.
And now Grezzik had a dilemma, because he didn’t want to confront the witch midair. Not only was it far more dangerous for Waverly, it was more dangerous for himself and Molly. But if he let the witch get too far ahead of them, she could lay traps.
Sherlock was so wrapped in his own misery that he didn’t hear John come downstairs in the darkness, long after tea had been forgotten.  Didn’t notice him at all, in fact, until he was standing in the doorway of their room.
Well...okay when I said I would never hurt a smol I meant one you had met. It's...yeah. Sorry about that.
Just as she was about to leave, Hopkins burst in, having run up the stairs. He clutched a woman’s bag in his hand and he was breathing hard.
It resurfaced a few nights later in an utterly different mood, a few low arpeggios in the dead of night as faint moans of pain and terror filtered through the firmly-locked door. The scales softened into low melodic chords, and the nightmare faded.
“And even if you’re not, it’d be much better to have you as a Queen than Jam—sorry, Grampy. Better you than the Vomitous Mass.” John patted her hand. “I think it’ll be great.”
I exchanged a quick glance with my husband. “It’s lovely that you two are getting along,” I said finally. “Hopkins is a friend of ours.”
The wind was still howling outside, and Rachel’s birthday would be stormy every year, but that little room was quiet as the family took in its tiny, newest member.
"Better hurry back to him before he gets bored," Donovan called, just loud enough for John to hear over the music.
John looked over at his husband. There was no mirth in Sherlock’s eyes, and his jaw was clenched tight.
Sally covered Waverly’s face with kisses as Philip put his arms around them both. Waverly finally began to fuss, and Sally opened her dress, letting Waverly nurse. Only then did she look up to Grezzik and Molly. “Thank you”, she whispered. “You saved her.”
John turned pink. His lips moved for a moment, then he bent over Greg’s desk, scribbling on the corner of a notepad. He pushed it over, lips pressed tightly together.
“Sally isn’t alone. The others will be there, and Sherlock and John can fight well. And Philip will protect his wife no matter what.” He wasn’t a particularly good spy, but Mycroft was sure of that much.
John's explanation of how 'better than sociopathic' didn't mean 'acceptable for public consumption' was interrupted by a shout down the hall. Exchanging glances the two of them sped up.
“You shouldn’t have to,” John said quietly. “Don’t you get it? There’s supposed to be talking and…baring of feelings, in relationships. You’ve told me about your family, and your nemeses, some of whom you think are your family" (Sherlock rolled his eyes)…"hell, you shared your whole world with me.”
The King followed her gaze. “You’ve brought friends, too. How splendid. We can have a feast!” Then his eyes fell on the bundle tied to Sally’s chest, and his eyes softened. “Oh my…”
Mike never thought he’d be a good dad. His seventeen children, two blood and fifteen adopted, say otherwise.
“Fear of letting you see how I felt,” Watson said simply. “Fear of your reaction, your rejection. Fear of the woman I loved, fear that I betrayed her in thought if not in deed. Fear of losing you…though that fear remains.”
"I don't believe so," King Lotharon said. "There are a lot of travellers in the Capital, especially since the 500
Ireni helped her off the drink and picked her up. She offered her a job, where she could travel and fight and have some purpose.
“One of your children is dead. If you want to save the other, keep your son as your only heir.” The King’s voice cracked. “So I buried Carla in a grove instead of the Mausoleum and kept you a secret from the world. If anyone asked, I told them that I was letting the Carriers have the love they wanted, provided that there was at least one woman available to give a child at all times.”
He passed Waverly to her. Sally drank in the sight of her baby—still wearing the same clothes, still the same smile, still
In terror, and hopelessness, and helplessness, and agony so great he still couldn’t quite catch his breath, John sobbed.
“Prince Jamiarty of Florin, you are charged with the murder of Carla, daughter of the King. You are further charged with treason, and the attempted murder of the King, and his Heir, Sally, Princess of Florin.”
When she found Janine, it felt like the room became empty. And as she took her lover’s hands, the same song started to play, the same one from ten years earlier.
“Yes, I do.” John was serious. “You’re my best friend, Greg—well, after Sherlock, but I can’t very well have my husband as my best man.” He started. Clearly hadn’t said the word yet, Greg thought fondly.
Billy Hopkins, aged five, was perfectly delighted by his mother's suggestion he go to visit his Grandfathers while Daddy was away. Mummy took him up to 221b early that morning, and Billy could already hear the playful argument over the last bit of toast.
"That sounds like an idea for later," Sherlock answered. His hands slipped under John's shirt, and John felt Sherlock's ring against his hip. All of a sudden, he understood, and laughed.
Everyone in the capital heard that scream, from Sherlock in his room who shuddered and wondered at the source, to the nearly-deaf King, to the youngest baby who wailed right back…
“Fine.” Ireni glared at her. “You want me to stop, pet? Grezzik, pick up the Princess. Maria, if the man gets up here, kill him.”
“The same. I can do more than they can with my strength. It should give them time to run away. Do I have that wrong? I sometimes do.”
John pressed a kiss to Sherlock's forehead, wishing dearly that they were in a fairy tale, and his love could soothe Sherlock's anguished brain. "What number are you at?"
John didn’t let go of Sherlock the entire way up the single flight of stairs, and once they were in their room he settled Sherlock into the chair.
"Well then why would I be scared?" Billy really didn't understand, and he was tired of that. "Please, Grandads, can't you just tell one story?"
“Sally!” It was Philip, and when Sally looked up he was there, Grezzik carrying him, Waverly in his arms.
“Of course not.” Lord Moran looked faintly horrified by the notion. “Now, your Highness, your Grace, will you agree?”
By evening their fevers had broken, and Kitty dared to hope that it was over. Lucid now, her fathers were able to sit up in bed, and they even drank some tea.
“Why?” Sally repeated. Something was twisting in her stomach as she saw Molly and Grezzik exchange a despairing look.
So...yeah? Sorry about that. I was listening to Human by Christina Perri for inspiration, and as such it got hella depressing. I promise some more cheerful stuff next week.
Sherlock wrapped his arms around John’s neck. “Why not?” he replied, dropping his voice an octave. “Could be rather fun.”
Sherlock curtsied. He was surprised that Molly didn’t; she didn’t even bow. She was staring at the Princess, eyes wide with shock.
And of course a librarian helped them out; I'm two days away from finishing that degree, librarians are powerful!
Careful to avoid stepping on glass (and really, Sherlock would probably give him hell for being in bare feet but it was a hot August night and he had no reason to expect shards of window to be an obstacle) John picked his way to the girl. He stood looking down at her for a moment.
“Lords and Ladies.” Prince Jamiarty smiled with all his teeth. “Riley’s done it again, and this time she’s discovered something actionable.”
Holmes choked on a sob of laughter. “Oh, I forgot, I have managed to hide that from you. Yes, John, the cocaine is a distraction, a game when I’m bored, but it also makes me think…and that’s all I can do, think and puzzle and deduce until I am too exhausted to feel.”
John knew better to ask questions, but there were several burning on the tip of his tongue as he pulled on the clothes Sherlock had laid out for him— jeans, a dark shirt, a cream coloured jumper, and his old leather jacket. Sherlock was dressed in a white shirt and a black blazer, and he pulled his coat and his old scarf on as they went out the door. A cab was hailed in an instant, and they were off.
“Why wasn’t that listed among our assets?!” John snapped. “That will do. And…well. I don’t know where we’d get a holocaust cloak.”
"So you already know," Donovan said. "Or at least you suspect." She moved closer. "John, why would he want to be with you for the long term? You're nothing like him—you can't keep up with him any more than we can. What can you possibly give him that will keep his attention? He's no Prince Charming now, that's clear as day. What's he going to be like when he realizes that you're boring?"
“Jamiarty does have allies,” Savira agreed. “Archenland borders one or two. We can talk about that.”
