‘Dean.’ He said more forcefully, as to make Dean look at him. When their eyes finally met, he confessed one more time. ‘I love you.’
Sleep, right. Dean took a deep breath and slid under the covers next to him. He turned off the bedside lamp. They laid there facing each other, not touching, but very close.
The first night was the hardest.
Sam, with all his bear-like glory, interrupted their moment when he pulled them both into his arms.
Dean didn’t let him finish. ‘No, listen, Cas. Let’s just sleep, okay? I mean, all of this’ he motioned with his hand in the space between the two of them, ‘is still going to be here tomorrow. We can talk until we’re blue in the face.’
Dean was suddenly too aware of how every movement caused him pain. He felt it deep in his bones - it was seeping in slowly from the exhaustion. He wanted to lie down, curl up with the blankets and sleep until the end of days.
After a long moment, Dean regained his footing, but didn’t move away, instead he gripped the angel’s shoulders tightly, almost painfully.
‘Why?’ Dean wasn’t sure what monsters were there left to be scared of.
The hope in his chest grew bigger. ‘You want to have me?’
He nodded and reached for Cas’s hand, holding it in place. It was warm and it was familiar and goddamnit, it was home. The first night was the hardest. But Cas was here. Cas was not in the empty anymore. Dean was gonna be okay.
Jack understood wordlessly and released him with all his restored powers and grace.
‘Cas, you’ve gotta help him!’ Sam pleaded with desperation and moved out of the way as Cas stepped in his place and pulled Dean away from the pole. The angelic grace seeped into his damaged body and Dean sagged in Castiel’s arms, his injuries disappearing.
Cas heard his prayer as clear as the first time it happened all those years ago.
‘Cas’ he moved his hands up to his face. ‘You came.’
He touched the side of his face. Touched their foreheads together. He breathed the air that Cas did. It was new and also familiar and he wanted to drown in the moment. He really needed Cas to stay. Really needed it, more than Castiel could possibly imagine, because he didn’t know what kind of broken sounds were leaving Dean when the Empty took his best friend, right before his eyes, he didn’t know that Dean hated the sobs and the pleas and how he begged God to bring him back and how God said no - he didn’t know and he should know, maybe if he did, he would never, ever leave again.
Dean looked terrified, asking Sam to tell him it was going to be okay.
‘Cas’, Dean’s voice was weak, but he’s never heard a sweeter sound in all his billions years of existence.
Dean solved the dilemma for him when they stopped at the gas station. Cas stepped out of the car to get some air while Dean went inside the store to get some food for the rest of the ride. Sam was still sleeping soundly. Cas never understood how he did that. Even as a human, he found falling asleep to be a tricky task. It seemed he needed the perfect setting for it - quiet, soothing, warm. On the other hand, Sam fell asleep just about anywhere.
Dean turned to him fully, in the faint glow of the gas station light, the most beautiful thing Cas had ever seen.
With horror, Castiel realized that Dean was dying. His mind rapidly analyzed the surroundings and calculated the lingering threat. It must have been a hunt gone wrong. He wasn’t there to help them and his heart clenched with guilt.
He slumped down on the edge of the bed. ‘Hell, Cas, I’m just so exhausted.’
Castiel followed the trace of Dean’s plea through the space and dimensions separating them. He knew he called out of habit. It was the same ‘Cas, buddy, a little help here,’ it always has been when they needed the angelic back-up. It must have only been a few weeks, but he missed their connection terribly.
It was only moments after Jack rescued him from the Empty and up to his new version of heaven and began to fill him in on the events that transpired after his sacrifice. But as soon as Dean’s voice broke through his consciousness, he tuned Jack out and focused on the words echoing inside his head.
Well, this is not awkward at all, thought Dean as he watched Cas balancing the pieces of clothing he just took off in his hands. "I'll give you some spare PJs of mine." He decided, at last. “Thank you.” Cas kept his tone quiet, almost apprehensive. After Dean threw him a pair of clean pants and T-shirt, they both changed in their respective corners. Cas kept getting further and further away in the room.

The music disappeared with him, leaving the smells of ozone and salt and sage. (They couldn’t pick out the honey.) The Jeep's door closed. Their phone speakers cut off. They could hear the music pouring from the sides of the Jeep.
Dean started to feel something like grass brush the edges of his jeans; enough to cool the air around him, not enough to make them uncomfortably damp.
Dean doesn’t ask.
Completely dumbfounded, Dean could do nothing but stare back, unable to turn away from the knowing gaze Cas seemed to have trapped him in. Had Cas just told him that in his own fucked up ‘Angel’s shouldn’t feel’ way that he was... in love with him? He knew there were feelings there. More than brotherhood, or comradeship. But love? True love. It was... it was so far beyond huge that it was dizzying, yet the look of intrepid awe and reverence he was getting, somehow made it impossible to deny.
“Don’t!” Dean’s softly demanding voice interrupted his turbulent thoughts and Castiel’s head shot up, surprise widening his regret filled eyes.
Dean just stared back at him, blinking slowly in confusion.
He swallowed, breathed, calmed his stomach. “Cas, I don’t know how many sex ed classes you played hooky from in Angel school, but two guys can’t make a baby.”
Cas stood behind a sturdy looking wooden work bench. He watched closely as Dean approached, his eyes scanning over the hunter’s worried features, his lips parted loosely, before his searching eyes found Dean's, locking on in a gentle realization. His brow puckered, “Dean?”
"I thought you were dead."
“Screw them,” Cas replied, his voice soft but demanding. “Their opinion of you is of no import to me.”
Castiel waited, counting down the seconds in the requested minute, wondering what Dean could possibly hope to accomplish in such a small measurement of time.
At the time, everyone who knew them had heard the official story. Dean had lost the money John had left for him and Sam in a card game, and then got busted stealing food for them to eat. That much had been true, but no one seemed to piece together that John Winchester’s cover story didn’t make much sense. But Dean knew his Father better than anyone and Dean’s punishment did not fit the crime. John wouldn't have abandoned his eldest for simply losing a card game, no matter what the stakes. He had taught the boy how to hustle in the first place. That and credit card scams was how they survived. And hell, he might even have been proud that Dean had tried to right his mistake by taking the five fingered discount to feed his brother. Protect Sammy, that was the number one rule. As long as that was followed, everything else would be forgiven. So, with the bruises on his forearms a reminder of his Father's disappointment, the teen had gotten the message loud and clear.
Cas’ head tilted questioning to the left. “Exploding the bedroom?”
“Well, I think I’ve done enough soul searching for one day.” Dean announced, reaching across awkwardly so he could slip the impala into drive without releasing Cas’ hand. “What’s say we get this tofu monstrosity that has no business being called a burger, back to Sam before it gets cold.”
“Which would be fine if I asked for a facebook update,” Sam continued regardless. Ignoring Dean’s obvious aversion to the subject. “But I’m your brother, you don’t have to hide things from me.”
Cas didn’t need to be told twice. He was out of the nest and had the mentioned notes in hand quicker than Dean would have thought possible - Humanly possible, anyway - before the angel stroad speedily from the room, presumably to find Sam.
As if to prove her Uncle’s point, the Nephilim let out a loud demanding cry, muffled from the confines of the car interior. Just like her Dad, the kiddo wasn’t about to let anything make her late for a meal.
Sam let out a weak-sounding chuckle. “Well, we’ll have to bear that in mind for next time.”
Before something snapped inside of him, as his brain suddenly surged to life, lunging to a new clarity, as if it had been under water his entire life and was only now breaking the surface, breathing for the first time. Nerves shattered and disappeared, leaving behind only a pull on every instinct he had, lurching his mind forwards into confident resolve. He didn't know where it came from, and in that moment he didn't care, all he knew for absolute certainty was that whatever this was between Cas and him, it was meant, it was pure, it was mutual. In that moment he knew that more completely than he knew his own name.
Bobby and Charlie's dreams had been bizarre and pain filled, but this was a whole nother level. He glanced left and right, at the sheer amount of doors left yet unseen to him, dreading to think what lay behind each of them. If this is what his Angel dreamed about it was no wonder the guy didn’t sleep.
‘Castiel’
In what felt like the thousandth door, the Angel’s head turned towards him at the sound of his name and Dean quickly stepped into the room. Until then he hadn’t considered the surroundings, he was only looking for Cas. Where he found the Angel was irrelevant, as long as he found him. But now he had, he checked out where they were.
“Yeah, I’d say,” Sam agreed. Finding out that Dean’s pregnancy was only going to be five months and not the expected nine had been more than slightly shocking to all, but growth spurts on top of that... “Could it be something they were giving him?” Sam asked, hopefully. “To speed up the pregnancy.”
“Nephilims are extremely rare,” Cas explained, not looking like he shared Dean’s shocked disappointment, quite the opposite in fact, he looked impressed at the array Sam had brought in. “The one you now carry is only the second one conceived this century.”
“So?” Sam tried to keep his tone casual, side glancing briefly to try and gauge his brother's mood. “You and Cas, huh?”
Castiel jerked his hand out of the hunter's body as if burnt. "Did I do something wrong?"
John’s angrily disappointed face flitted across his mind
"No, it wasn't. And don't apologize." His voice was confident, husky as he closed the small distance between them.
Choosing the back row had definitely been a wise choice. Not only did it mean that Dean was comfortable risking some more public displays of affection during the trailers, but it also meant that nobody except Cas noticed when he nodded off halfway through the movie.
He reined in his wildly escaping thoughts before they could escape him completely and make it all the way down to the gutter. That wouldn't do him any good and there was already a stirring down south that wouldn't go unnoticed if it was given any more stimulation. He'd fantasied about Castiel in far more compromising position than just bare-chested in his arms (He's sure that some of the ones that he'd had indulged in would earn him a one way trip to hell if Heaven ever found out just how he'd imagined an Angel of the Lord inside his head - If the dicks even cared) and knows just how quickly mere thoughts can have a physical effect on him, and that had to be... inappropriate or something. It was definitely crossing some invisible line at least, especially since the dude clearly needed comfort.
The hunter huffed in frustration. Dammit, how did Cas do that? See through all the bullshit right to the root of what was troubling him.
Just wanted to take a quick moment to say the biggest thank you to everyone who messaged their support and understanding. We're all in this together fam and together we'll get through this dark time. Let's prove that 'family don't end in blood'
Sam gulped fearfully, not liking the sound of those odds. Not when it was his brother who’s life was on the line.
"No, Dean." he heard the other whisper back to him, close by. "I'll watch over you."
“What can I do?”
Having learnt from the night before that Cas took far too long to get naked, Dean quickly started stripping him, pleased when the Angel caught on and toed off his shoes before helping to rid himself of the remainder of his clothing. Without breaking their eager kissing, Dean presses his palm flat to Cas’ chest, guiding him backwards until the Angel’s calves hit the bed and he sat heavily, looking up at the hunter with wide, excited eyes. Tugging his towel from his midsection Dean threw it aside, draping one leg over to straddled the Angel’s lap. He wrapped his arm around Cas’ shoulders, closing his eyes at the feeling of their bare chests flushed against each other.
“Maybe we should get back to the bunker,” Sam said softly, after a beat. The concern for his brother, so apparent in his voice, as he spoke hesitantly, as if addressing a spooked child. “Or maybe we can find a motel nearby,” Sam continued, passively, “and we can look again in the morning.”
It wasn’t that the bed was uncomfortable, Dean had slept in far worse with no problems. Throughout his hunters life he had trained himself to be able to fall asleep at the drop of a hat, getting his required four hours whenever he could. Hell, he could probably sleep standing up if he needed to.
A comforting hand gripped his thigh, a second cradled his jaw. “Cas? ... Baby, what is it?”
Hesitating, Dean turned his eyes to Cas, an apprehensive look on his troubled face. Castiel gave a half smile and nod to the hunter as he gestured with his head and eyes, out of the room. Reassured by his silent conversation with Cas, Dean hefted the petite woman over his shoulder and strode from the room with Sam hot on his heels despite his slight limp.
At some point Cas’ eyes had dropped closed, or maybe Sam had closed them when he had checked him over. Dean didn't know which, either way he was grateful. There had been something very unnerving about the Angel’s unblinking, unfocused stare. Cas had lived for countless millennia, seen creation, survived holy wars. His touch could heal or kill as he chose. Yet the heavenly Angel broke after the touch of Dean Winchester.
“So that’s what you were in your head for?” Dean asked.
“You tried to visit my dreams?” Dean quizzed, unsure why he found that information surprising. Castiel would have done anything he could to get to him, Dean knew that.
He only knew that it had to have been at least a week, if the amount of meals he had been given was anything to go by.
He shoulder barged past the Angel as he strode hotly from the room. Cas calling after him, his voice near begging, “Dean...Dean, please, listen...”
“Dean?!” he shouted, between swings, his older brother jerking round looking surprised to see them both standing there. “What are you doing?”
Cas hadn't done this before. He had, but he hadn't. He had been human at the time. The Angel had never had sex, as an Angel.
“We’re wasting time.” Cas kept up his one-sided conversation, his tone growing more desperate, as Dean scanned the shelves. “We need to get you back to the bunker as soon as possible. You’re warded, but I have no idea how much of that applies to the Nephilim.”
Castiel’s fingers closed around the glass as he slowly rotated it over the smooth surface of the bar, his eyes hypnotically focused on the bronze depths within. If their roles had been reversed Dean may have been grateful for the drink in this dark time and oddly Castiel found some small comfort in the tiny connection, a small subtle link to the hunter he was missing past the point of being unbearable.
“Fuck it!” He pulled Baby over to the side of the road before he could give himself the chance to chickenshit out. Leaving the car idle, he turns down the music so he can hear himself think and turns to Cas who’s watching him curiously from the passenger seat.
Dean's smile grew wider, he didn't need to open his eyes to work out that, despite the Angel having no need for sleep, Cas had stayed with him all night, and unless what Dean felt was deceiving him, was very much still naked.
A small smile tugs up at his lips, while his hand subconsciously grazes under his shirt, palming protectively over his stomach. Their child.
“Amara!” Dean all but shouted in realization, snapping Sam’s attention back to his brother who had frozen just inside the doorway, as if afraid his closeness would hurt the Angel further.
“Wait wait,” Dean said, pausing to swallow this time without immediately replacing his mouthful. “I am
“I know that Cas, but it’s not the point,” he said, shaking his head dismissively. Yes, over the course of the day he’d been sugar dipped in more worry than he cared to remember, but the root of Dean’s anger ran far deeper. Cas couldn’t play fast and loose with his life anymore. Neither of them could, because it wasn’t just about them anymore. There was another life that they were responsible for.
Castiel sagged against him. It didn’t change how the angel felt about his involvement, but Dean’s words - knowing that Dean wasn’t going to hold it against him - helped ease some of the tightness in his chest.
Dean frowned at the disarray of the bedroom that had been hidden from him before with the light being off. Everything he owned it seemed was thrown about the place, as if a tornado had swiped through the room while the pair of them had been distracted with each other. He'd been pretty out of it, but he thought he would have noticed if they had had an earthquake. "Cas?"
“I’m not asleep Dean, I don’t sleep.” The huffiness of his tone sounded to Dean like a parent patiently addressing a stubborn child. “These aren’t dreams. You’re in my mind. These are my memories.”
His face twists into a fierce resolve. He moves gingerly, trying to cause as little pain to Dean as physically possible, as his hand tightens, closing in around the tiny spark of life.
“After the movie we go get pie,” Dean smiled. He slammed the door and hurried round to the drivers side, trying to keep himself from skipping in his excitement.
To start with, those among the hunters that hadn’t required medical attention had stayed behind to help search for their missing comrade. What was left of the compound had been surrounded with people calling out to the angel, until the fires died down enough for them to start searching more thoroughly... That had been hours ago.
SGsVamp xXx
Dean had never been a believer of the whole 'love at first sight' thing, that was something that was reserved for chick flicks and garbage romance novels, as far as he was concerned. It just didn't happen in real life. So he had assumed (in the beginning) that the feelings that had bubbled up inside of him, under Cas' penetrating gaze, was some kind of Angelic reverence. Some hypnotic pull that could draw humans to the celestial beings, that had caused that new and unexpected feeling. But that assumption had been thrown out the window when he had met the other Angels and that experience had been nothing like meeting Cas. Quite the opposite in fact, he thought the rest of them were dicks and that was putting it mildly.
“We need to get you back!” Cas said panickedly. He was warily glancing all over, as if searching for some unseen threat, as he hooked his hand under Dean’s armpit, practically forcing the hunter up to his feet and into the car.
He scrubbed his hands through his saturated hair. It was no wonder that his shoulders were knotted together tighter than the box of jumper cables in Baby’s trunk.
"Cas?"
“Yeah. So anyway, Schwarzenegger is this kick-ass killer robot called the Terminator. He gets sent back in time to kill this woman, Sarah Connor, before she can have her son, John, who’s due to grow up to become the leader of the human side in the war against the machines. With me so far?” Dean let Cas sit first so the hunter could take the aisle seat.
He was alive. He was home.
For now all Sam could do was stall, hopefully to give his brother the time he needed, and try not to bleed out in the meantime.
Cas hummed in agreement, watching as Dean eased the final bullet free with the tip of his blade. “I think it’s love, Dean... Not Family or friendship, but... true love.”
“‘Cause the fact that you’re empathizing with him only proves how different you are. You’re actually feeling, Cas. He just mimicked people.”
“Got it.” Dean snatched it up the elusive root and was already dashing from the storage room, before Sam could say anything more.
Despite the anger, Sam was absolutely certain that the threats Dean was throwing around were empty. His brother just wasn’t seeing straight right now. The day had been too much of a whirlwind of emotions for the pregnant and hormonal man to fully process.
He could hold it back for the short journey home, so not to taint their first date, Cas’ first ever date. So he tried not to think about the swaying, rocking motion of the car, or what he could have eaten (The burger that may have been a little pink, possibly. The popcorn, the soda with a little too much syrup, a little too flat,
However pure Dean's intentions were, it seemed Castiel was not on the same page. He dove into the kiss hungrily, claiming and surrendering. There was a hand combing fingers in the short hairs at the back of his neck, holding him close as if worried the kiss would disappear if given the chance. Another gripping his hip with strong fingers, keeping their lower halves flushed just as tightly together as their waltzing lips and Dean felt the ground slip away from beneath him, before his back slams against something hard and solid. Jaring their lips apart on impact.
Rubbing absently at his chest, the Angel looks up to the taller man. “I never intended for this to happen, Sam.”
Dean turned angered eyes up at his younger brother. “You’re taking his side?!”
Castiel sighed and carried on. “It’s not about power, Dean. It’s about you being our Father’s most precious, made in his image. He gave you everything, freewill, dreams, hope, love. Angels are nothing but pawns. We follow orders and even if we are perfect soldiers, abide by every commandment, complete every mission,” Cas shook his head, dropping it slowly, “after billions of years of our faith and our service we became second in our Father's eyes to humans. It made most resentful.”
Showered, shaved and feeling more or less back to as carefree as he had been when he’d first woken, Dean sauntered into the kitchen. He found Cas and Sam huddled at the small table opposite each other. Both had wide eyes fixed on pages from Silverman’s files, while Sam absently munched his way through what looked like to Dean something that would be scraped out of the bottom of a guinea pig hutch.
“Cas?”
, and everywhere agrees that caffeine just isn’t good for you.”
After his first had made an abrupt and messy reappearance, the masochistic doctor had deemed it necessary that he was fed ‘by other means’. He hadn’t known what that had meant, until he had woken with a tube taped to his cheek. He’d only had the chance to rip that thing out of his nostril once. After that, every one of his ‘feedings’ had been done while he was unconscious, Dean only being aware of it after the event because he woke with a tender throat and a full belly.
“Because it came from Amara,” Cas interjected, “so I doubt it was a spell. And even if it was, we didn’t cast it, so the price would not be ours to pay.”
Cas’ eyes bore up to Dean’s own, fear, sorrow - so much sorrow swimming in those blue pools. Cas was terrified. Sadly he broke the gaze, unable to look Dean’s way as he spoke, “To the best of my knowledge, only one human has ever survived birthing a Nephilim.”
With a wearily troubled look Cas approached, stepping up close into Dean’s personal space. Bringing his hand up between them, he gently cupped the hunter's cheek. “It doesn’t work that way, Dean.”
“How were they so damaged then?” Dean asked. He'd seen the Angels fall, with their wings burning up into nothing as they hit the Earth. If Cas hadn’t fallen the same way then his wings shouldn’t be the tattered mess Dean knew them to be.
Cas had been fine, of course, completely indifferent to the whole experience. It was natural to him, maybe even therapeutic. But what Dean had seen in the Angel’s memories had shaken him, more than he would ever admit and he knew it would haunt him for a long time to come. He would never forget how Castiel’s so-called ‘family’ had treated him. Nor would he forgive, but Cas seemed to be unfazed about it all, or had put it all behind him. Whichever the case may be, Dean would try to do the same. He most certainly didn’t want to bring it up and risk Cas having to relive some painful memories in the process. There was nothing Dean understood more than choking down traumas until they don’t hurt anymore. If that’s what Cas wanted to do, or had done, who was he to judge. Dean could keep up the charade if that's what his Angel wanted, but that wasn’t the only thing that was currently making his stomach turn uneasily.
Reassurance hadn’t worked, but maybe a healthy dose of tough love might, Sam hoped. What else could he do? He had to try. “You’re a father Cas, and you need to start acting like one.”
When Dean had first learned about Castiel’s part in the nephilim killings he had been compassionate, sympathetic even. Recognizing that Castiel had little to no choice in the matter. He had been a soldier, it was a mission and his rebellion would have ultimately changed nothing. He had refused to put blame on Castiel, but this was not the same. Akobel wasn’t just another angel who had broken the law that Castiel had been ordered to kill. This was the angel - the only angel, as far as Castiel was aware - that had the knowledge of how his mate had survived birthing a nephilim.
Getting to sleep was proving impossible.
Naomi leaned closer over her subject, studying closely, eyes cold, like Cas was no more than a lab rat to her.
Before he could respond, or do anything more than simply glance Cas’ way, Dean found himself encapsulated in a tightly clinging Angelic embrace.
“You, Dean,” Sam continued, after giving Dean a chance to answer and realized  he wasn't going to. “You’ve always had his back. Even when maybe you shouldn’t have. You’ve always believed in him, just like he has with you... and I know you don’t wanna hear this right now but Cas isn’t the bad guy here.”
“I mean, look at this,” Sam said, jabbing his finger to some of  the papers he was reading from. “This gibberish is your vitals, blood pressure, temperature excetera. All of which were elevated. Which he puts down to your - I assume that word is ‘agitation’.”
Sam quickly tried to mask the horrified confusion Castiel’s words caused, grateful that the Angel had quickly looked away so he wouldn’t be able to see. He waited, sure that there must be more to that statement, a reason that didn’t sound as bad as he was thinking it was right now. “Cas, you can’t- ...She’s innocent. You can’t blame her for what happened.”
The Angel had never been on a date. Not a real one. Cas had tried to once before, when he was without his grace, so Dean knew it was something he had wanted.
As much as Sam knew he would be dying to give his brother hell about it all, there was no way he was going to...
He turns his attention to planting open mouthed kisses along Cas' jawline, so he can attempt to take some control and slow things down, while giving his uncoordinated, overexcited fingers a chance to loosen Cas' backwards tie and give his head time to stop spinning. Because he's losing his mind. Being naked, being pressed down into memory foam by the Angel, a highly aroused Angel if the hardness grinding into his hip is anything to go by. An Angel he's wanted so badly, fantasied about so often, for years, it was hard to believe, impossible to believe that this is actually happening.
“Fine!” Dean spat out through clenched teeth. “Sam will go with you.”
Sam silently chuckled at his brother's unperturbed dismissal. It was just Dean's way. He laughed off the seriousness, made jokes out of the dire and it was comforting to know that Dean was back in every sense. With a mental shrug Sam tossed the now not needed book onto the table along with the others.
“So how did this happen?”
But he honestly didn’t think she would.
As I keep having the same comment repeating on each chapter I've posted recently, I would like to state that I post chapters as soon as they are finished. I will never make any of you wait for longer than necessary. So any comments that only state "can you do another chapter" without anything else, will not be approved in future, as I am finding them frustrating and that does not help the creative flow and is actually slowing me down. I hope that makes sense and you can understand.
He hoped with everything that he had that he was not making a mistake, or playing Russian roulette with the lives of the people he cared about. Because it was too late for him, he was in too deep. From the second Cas’ lips had met his own he knew he was a lost cause, but it wasn’t until the Angel’s confused confession that it had really hit home for Dean. It wasn’t just a roll in the hay, for the Angel either. It was the real deal. Something he had also wanted for a long time, but never thought it would be possible.
“I was never going to act on it,” Dean admitted, trying to make it sound like the apology that it was. Because he was sorry. Sorry his feelings had gotten between them. Sorry that he had dragged Cas into this mess. Sorry that he had risked their friendship because of it all. He was just sorry.
Without realizing, Dean’s smile mirrored theirs as he took in the little window into their lives. Something about their body language told Dean that this was a familiar scene between them. Despite the husband's frustration and the wife's inability to help him understand, the couple were comfortable, putting each other completely at ease with a simple gesture of affection.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Please stop calling my Father's name,” Castiel murmured, nudging Dean’s knees apart further as he crawled up over the hunter. “It’s very disconcerting.”
“Are you saying this is my fault?!”
Dean stared up at the movies available, trying to decide what Cas might like. He was drawn to the new released action flick that was showing, with Samuel L Jackson and that Deadpool guy, that looked engaging and with humor, but he knew Cas would ask a million questions throughout, so he decided against it and went to check out what ‘oldies’ they were playing instead. At least that way he had a chance of answering the Angel’s inevitable queries.
The Angel had stared into the fire, copious amounts of tears spilling down his shaking cheeks, until his legs had given out beneath him. Then he knelt in the dirt, till the flames died and turned all to ash. Still Castiel had stayed.
Briefly, Dean wonders how Cas was able to speak without moving his lips, before realizing that the kiss has ended. Cas isn't pressing into him anymore and Dean's frozen with his lips still pursed against nothing but air. He's panting, with his eyes still lightly closed, the taste of Cas still lingering on his oversensitive, tingling lips and he missed the feeling already. Brief as it was, it was intoxicating, leaving Dean craving more. The kiss of his Angel was worryingly addictive.
Dean and Castiel. He smiled with a shake of his head in almost disbelief. He had seen there was something between the two of them for a long time, but never really expected anything to actually happen. Dean was too deep in his denial and Cas was just plain clueless.
Sam pursed his lips with a skeptical shrug, “I have no idea. I don't even know if Angels dream, but it’s all we got and we should have everything we need right here.”
Wishing all the SPN Fam a happy Holidays
“And while we’re on the subject,” Dean carried on despite the lack of participation from his angel. “Get off the damn train, Cas. Because news flash for ya. You’re not who you were back then.”
Dean turned his back to him, so not to have to see the pain on Cas’ face. Okay, he hadn’t meant that. Not entirely. Not the way it had come out. What he had meant was that he didn't care about the risks. All pregnancies carried a certain risk, right? Maybe his was a much riskier one, but they were used to insurmountable odds and it didn't mean that the kid deserved to die.
Cas had been silent the whole drive, which in Baby was fine, Dean could play his music and tap his fists along to the beat against the steering wheel or hum along to distract himself and not acknowledge the almost intrusive stare he was getting from Cas in the passenger seat beside him, but here, with nothing to do but wait the silence coming off the Angel was deafening, and making Dean feel a little on edge.
Sam blinked his own tears away at the sight. He couldn’t cry. He needed to be strong right now, for his brother.
Dean's teeth chattered, in a way that had nothing to do with being cold. Hesitantly, he opened his eyes and took in the cell he had woken up in. Despite his nerves, the room was definitely the lesser of two evils, if he had to choose...
“Mates, huh?” Dean mused the word around, testing the feel of it. The Angels, of course, would choose a term that dehumanized the whole thing and make them sound like nothing more than co-workers, or at best a pair of penguins on Animal Planet. “What do you think your family will say with you getting together with - what was it they called me? A mud monkey?”
“Great plan. Hell of a plan,” Dean snapped in angered sarcasm. “Much better than your previous one of leaving Cas behind to get blown up!”
Stepping out, he grabbed up a towel and dried quickly. Wrapping it low on his hips he went to leave. But as he passed the mirror something in his reflection caught his eye.
A deep chuckle escaped Dean. He should have known that, with as literal as Cas could be, he would need a more direct approach. He leaned down, keeping his Angel’s gaze in his sight, his eyes sparkling with mischief, as he whispered huskily, “Did you like coming in my ass, Cas?”
about it.”
He waited, hoping his prayer would work as Cas had said it would. He could not handle another trip down the Angel’s memory Lane right now.
“And you didn’t?”
Hey guys, so so sorry about the how long it's taken me to get this chapter up. I knew it was going to be a tough one, but I wasn't expecting the series finale to put me into such a depressive mood that I didn't see the point in carrying on (no pun intended) with the story at all. The only reason this is even continuing at all is the kind words some of you have left and I also felt awful that I left it on a cliffhanger on the chapter before.
He heard Cas’ deep voice rumble out an explanation, and Sam’s responding laugh, which falters and dies in the air, being replaced after a stagnant silence by a bewildered question. It may have been something along the lines of ‘you’re not kidding’, but Dean couldn't be sure. He tuned them out, the words were lost to him anyway, like he was hearing them from a distance, or underwater. All he could hear with any clarity was one word, resounding through his head like a persistent heartbeat.
It felt like coming home.
He pulled his flannel tighter around himself as the cooling April evening started to nip at him, grateful that the emergency duffel he kept in the trunk of the Impala had a spare set of clothes so he hadn’t had to search dressed in that damn backless hospital gown. Ignoring the remaining tears, Dean stared out across the rubble. Scanning for any sign of his Angel, his eyes darting to any movement, as his imagination played cruel tricks on him, turning the flickering shadows into wisps of dark hair or charred clothing.
The expression he found when he could finally see his friends face is not one he likes. Castiel looks emotionally wrung out. So many expressions crossing the Angel's features, like he just can't decide how he feels, or how to express it; the fear, pain, longing, barely marked behind weary eyes, that peer up at him like they can't quite believe what he is seeing. It was endearing and heartbreaking in equal measures and the hunter couldn't bear it. On anyone else that expression would be terrible to witness, on an Angel... it was just plain wrong. He had to fix it. So, without giving it much thought, if any thought at all, Dean brought his hand up to gently cup Cas' jaw, closed his eyes and pressed his lips to the front of the Angel's cheek. Intending nothing more than to prove to Cas that he was here, he was safe. Trying to ease that worriedly pained look that is completely dominating the Angel's features. Nothing wrong with a peck on the cheek to give a friend some comfort, right? That's all it was, a friendly peck.
Cas gave a small half nod of understanding. “And why is he in a nutshell?”
“What bit shall we cut off first?”
Although Dean had never admitted it, Sam had known Dean was bisexual for years now, and suspected it for even longer. Dean had just tried too hard, put on too much of a macho front for it not to be over compensating for something. And even if all that bravado hadn’t given away his brother's secret, his siren becoming a man certainly had. There was no denying that Dean was into women, but he definitely had part of himself locked and barricaded away in the proverbial closet, as far as Sam could see. So tightly locked away that Sam was sure that door would never be opened.
“Oh we can,” she corrected almost cheerily. “We already are. Troops were deployed a few hours ago. All of the American hunters will be annihilated... and, of course, those with ties to them.”
"You won't..." he said wearily, barely getting the words out, "You won't go anywhere will you?"
As Dean spoke, Castiel slipped his hand down, taking the place of Dean’s own to gently cover over where Dean was showing, gently running his thumb in a tender stroke of the bump of their baby. The subtle movement, soothing some of Dean’s inner turmoil and he lent against his angel’s side.
Castiel used to have patience that would make the holiest of Saints jealous, even if envy was considered a sin. When time went on for as long as it had for him, the smaller amounts of it had held little to no meaning for the Angel. He’d waited thousands of years through the evolution of man, just to see whether it would be homospapiens or homoerectus that would survive. He’d waited for wars, for apocalypses, without concern or anxiety. He’d be perfectly content to wait quietly, barely moving, for hours, days on end.
Leaning against the cool tile, Dean bowed his head under the hot spray. Letting the pelted droplets cascade down his face and pour in a steady stream off his chin, while the steam rose off his too tense shoulders, fogging up the already well fogged bathroom. The bunker really did have amazing water pressure and there was nothing like a piping hot shower for washing away all the stresses the day had brought... and it had been a long day full of panic over people he cared about, right from the moment he had opened his eyes.
It was a perfectly reasonable and logical argument.
It was an ultrasound photograph.
“Yeah, I’m fine,” Dean replied reassuringly. Though he had been feeling lethargic recently. A side effect from housing and then being stripped of thousands of souls no doubt. Storing that much raw power, even for a short time, had to take a toll, right? Not that he was going to share his thoughts. There was no need to worry his brother when there was nothing anyone could do. It’ll fade, he was sure of that. “Taking a bit longer to get going this morning is all.”
Satisfied, and not wanting to stress his brother, or deny a pregnant person a meal any longer than was absolutely necessary, Sam nodded in agreement.
He didn't need conscious thought, or the ability to speak, to instinctively lean into the hug. Bringing his arms around Cas, pulling his secretly coveted Angel that bit closer, he hid a secret grin as Cas' soft hair caught on his stubble and tickled his cheek.
“You have to eventually. Now’s as good a time as any,” Sam said, pausing in hope that he wouldn’t have to continue what needed to be said. He wanted to remind Castiel that it had been Dean’s choice to keep the baby, even knowing how unlikely his chances were of surviving a Nephilim birth. But he already knew what the Angel’s response would be.
Twelve pages. One for each day he’d been there, Dean realised, as Sam continued. “And this. Took me forever to work out that what I thought was F.X. N and V was actually S.X N and V. Side effects; nausea and vomiting. Which isn’t exactly a revelation, given that-” Sam cut himself off, looking up to his brother. “Did you throw up on the doctor?”
“You sure about that?” Dean asked, “‘cause you just spent hours inside your own head trying to figure out how you feel. So how can you be sure?”
Castiel was grateful for both. It made what he had to do much easier.
Like the Angel himself, Dean was not coping well.
When he reached and then passed sixty seconds, he shifted his weight from one foot to the other. Considering if he should follow, or remain where he was. Dean had asked him to wait there for a minute, but not stated what to do when that minute ran out. Was it a hypothetical minute or a literal one? Should he follow Dean to ask him? But doing so would go against the ‘wait here’ part of the request.
having to go to Heaven.”
Dean paused, his frustration abating some, turning to his younger brother. “You mean that dream walking thing we did with Bobby and Charlie?”
Castiel looked up as Dean elbowed open the door. If the hunter was surprised to see the Angel sat on his bed, patiently waiting for him, he hid it almost flawlessly... almost.
“Same thing that happens to anyone who gets too close to us. They end up getting hurt ... or worse,” Dean barked, hoping his outburst would shut up his little brother. He didn’t want to get into this at all, but least of all now, when his Angel was in trouble.  Right now he had more important things to consider than Sam’s need for a chick flick moment. That could come after, if it had to at all, once Cas was alright. And not one moment before.
“Then what did I just say?” Sam challenged as he crosses his arms, not believing Dean’s claim for a second. He had been snoring for God’s sake. And Drooling.
And Cas was still wearing far too much clothing.
Dean’s busy search stopped abruptly. Slowly turning to face him, an annoyed questioning glare upon his face. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
Sure, Cas had always been his Angel, in a way. Cas would say Dean was his charge, but now it was more. This wasn't something either of them had been obligated or ordered into, it was their choice, their want and need for each other, and Dean didn't understand why they hadn't done all this years ago.
Needed most - the words repeated around in Dean’s head, triggering a recent memory.
As he looked down at their joined hands relaxed together on the tabletop a stab of self-hatred hit him. That was the level of support he should be able to give his Angel, instead he’s evading the one simple question Cas had asked him.
“And what can I get for you, Handsome?” the waitress purred out at Cas with a flirtatious smile.
“You're late,” Castiel griped, as the witch slid gracefully onto the bar stool next to him.
Dean gave him a look like he wasn’t comprehending what Castiel was saying, so the Angel explained further. “I studied you, how you reacted to the situation and copied them.”
Castiel shook his head, looking doubtful. “There’s no reference to anything like that and this Doctor seems quite methodical. It would be highly unlikely that he would neglect to mention something that important.”
“You don't have to look, Sammy,” Dean replied casually, “But keep this to yourself, yeah? Cas doesn’t know yet and I want it to be a surprise.”
“I will need your assistance with the extraction.”
Dean was up in a flash, kneeling over the Angel. Panic in his braking voice as he shook shoulders, cupped cheeks, pleading. "Cas?... What's wrong? Cas?... Come on man snap out of it!...”
SGsVamp xXx
Dean followed the Angel’s gesture, surprised to find himself holding aloft the last bullet in his red stained fingers. “Oh... Oh, yeah. Try it now.”
Dean is content to wait until they’re alone, before getting out of his seat and offering his hand to his Angel.
Snatching up his body wash, he scrubbed harshly at his skin. Trying to scrub away his more troubling thoughts, wash them away down the drain and focus on the positive. Trying to force himself to realize that despite the shaky start, all three of them, Sam, Cas and himself, were now all well and healthy. After he had taken the last bullet from Cas, the Angel’s mojo had instantly returned. He’d healed himself and then Sam with no trouble. In fact, apart from the Bond villainess currently residing in their dungeon all was right with the world.
“Do I need to do something?” Dean offered, a smirk crawling playfully onto his lips. “Tell her to back off my man and defend your honor?”
The nervousness in Castiel’s eyes vanished as he glared back at the teasing hunter. “I don’t think that’s necessary,” he snipped, squinting in annoyance.
“Dean,” Sam interrupted quietly, the stunned tone to his voice, louder than if he had shouted, had both turning to him immediately. “Did you know this was in here?”
“Well, that’s an understatement, but yeah dude, it’s improved.” He leaned into Cas, dropping his voice as if confessing a secret. “It was actually kinda hot.”
Naomi.
“More fellatio?” Cas asked innocently, causing Dean to giggle once more.
But Dean was right there with him on the precipice, ready to leap, together. "Cas... I got ya. Just let go."
Despite what Dean had said, Castiel would not be accompanied by Sam.  The idea of taking Sam with him and leaving Dean completely alone was out of the question. He would not be leaving Dean on his own. Not after what happened the last time.
When he didn't get a response, Sam looked up and his eyes nearly bugged out of his skull. "Dean?"
“Then I’ll get him to heal my fist, so I can break his nose as well.”
"I'm sorry," Cas sighed, apologetically, "It was an accident."
Castiel’s words were a whispered promise, no hint of uncertainty and relief washed through him. A breath hadn't been aware of holding escapes, uncontrolled honest words chasing after, "Me either," before their lips locked together once again, in a near urgent eagerness.
On the fourth day, Dean was woken to lips on his forehead and gentle touches to his side, the ‘good morning, Dean’ softly whispered into the air, before the hunter had even opened his eyes.
“It would appear that the coffee didn’t have the effect he desired,” Castiel mused as he watched over his slumbering mate, who was slumped over the kitchen table, his head resting on his folded arm and wondered at what point had drooling and snoring stopped being curious human behaviours to him and had become something the angel found endearing. On Dean anyway.
before he shoved it out of his head. It was years ago, he was over it, he hadn’t thought about it in forever.
“I would do anything to keep you safe,” Castiel finally speaks up sadly, under the hunter's intense watch and Dean doesn’t doubt for a second the sincerity of what the Angel is saying, but he can also see the conflict brewing beneath the surface. He knew that despite Dean’s misgivings, Cas was capable of anything if he believed it was the right thing to do.
Castiel recognized the depowering sigil straight away, but he’d never seen, or heard of it being carved into bullets this way before. It was almost genius. Almost. With a slight tweak in the design they could have created something far more deadly to an Angel than simply rendering a celestial being impotent.
“Dean, I’m so sorry. You were a child. You shouldn’t have-”
“CAS!” Dean called out and the angel’s messed haired head appeared back around the doorframe.
“So that’s how many now?” Dean asked absently, staring into his coffee mug, trying to decide whether it was worth drinking it cold just to get some caffeine in his system. He decided against it. “Twelve?”
“Whoa, back up a few pages.” Dean floundered on the bed, kicking off the sheets that tangled around his ankles. He scrambled up, blocking the angel’s path as Castiel was flapping the coat over his jacket onto his shoulders. “What’s goin’ on? What did I miss?”
Dean quickly closed the small distance between them, pulling Cas into his arms. “I told you before, get off that damn guilt train, Cas,” he said, his breath puffing against the angel’s neck. “What happened way back when... you gotta let it go, man. Or else it’s going to eat at you.”
The whole thing was so pointless and unnecessary. Why in the world was he standing in a cramped service station bathroom waiting for results of a test that’s impossible to have any result other than negative? That damn Angel was making him crazy. Part of him wanted to give up on the whole thing, throw the stupid test in the garbage where it belongs and just walk out, but he knew just how stubborn Cas could be. So stubborn in fact, that Dean wondered if the test would be enough to convince the Angel. What if even after it’s done, with the proof in front of them Cas still refused to believe the outcome, still maintained his ridiculous notion that they could conceive, what then? Wait nine months for a baby
“This is pleasant,” Cas' voice broke the silence just a few short minutes later.
“That’s how easy it is when you know them. Even if I were to mix it with another color, or add a million other shades, you’d still know that was yellow.”
Stepping stones of flannel, cotton and denim made a pathway to the bed. All ripped and flung from the hunters body by a very eager Angel on a mission. With every new inch of skin that is revealed, Castiel marveled. Dean Winchester was a work of art. Out of everything he'd ever seen in all his father's creation this human was the most beautiful, in Castiel's opinion. This soul, so pure, so bright, completely flawless, with a pull on the Angel to match the gravity of the sun, housed in a body that mirrored it's perfection. He had rebuilt this body for Dean at his resurrection, he had rejoined it with Dean's soul. He knew both, down to the most minimal detail, knew the precise placement of each and every freckle - every cell, every molecule. But to know it intimately, to be able to touch, to feel and stroke. To caress him, bare beneath his hands, unmasked from the coverings of inferior clothing that were not worthy of touching such beauty. That was a deeply coveted treasure of delicate hardness he had been sure he would never get to fully discover.
“Everyday without fail.” Dean scoffed. He hadn’t answered a single call. Nor did he plan to. “I’ve heard of stalkers that were less persistent.”
Amara’s magic had challenged that. Dean didn’t believe in fate or destiny, or any of that other Hallmark crap, but he believed in coincidences even less. And mere moments after he had pulled Cas from his self-induced mind trance both Sam as well as Cas had been hurt. There were only so many times and so many signs that could be thrown in his face, before he had to sit up and take notice.
Even if everyone of those remaining assisted, they would still be outnumbered, but they would have the element of surprise on their side. With the warding Dean had warned them about the men of Letter would not be expecting Castiel to be able to get in. That gave them an advantage that the British would not have anticipated.
On his left bicep, right up by his shoulder, was a handprint. He twisted to get a better view. The mark was the exact same size, shape and placement as the one Cas had left on him from dragging his ass outta Hell. But that one had faded away to nothing years ago, not even leaving a scar and at no point did he remember it looking like this. Before it had been harsh and raised, like he had been branded by his saving Angel's hand. This one wasn’t. It wasn’t raised, it didn’t look burnt. It was smooth with a faint silvery shimmer to it. A ghost of what was. And unlike the other, when he gently ran his thumb over it, the marking didn’t hurt.
Castiel rounded on his mate, a telling look glinting in his eyes. “Can’t you?” he asked, a single eyebrow raising.
Sam expelled all the air from his lungs in one long aggravated huff. Yes it was interesting, but it still hadn’t answered the main two questions; How had Dean gotten pregnant in the first place, and most importantly, How was he going to survive it?
Denied his two most relied upon choices to vent out his anger, the unlucky door in front of him was kicked open with the full force of the heel of his right booted foot. The lock splintered off leaving a gaping hole in its wake, falling to the floor heavily as the rest of the door was smacked open, colliding loudly with the wall inside and splintering the hinges from the frame.
“And we’re having to look up every other word because half of it is written in abbreviations and medical jargon,” Sam added, waving to his laptop that was propped open between them both, though Sam seemed to be the only one using it.
But if he didn’t go - if he didn’t try for every opportunity presented to him and Dean died because of the nephilim, Castiel knew he would never forgive himself - never - no matter how long he lived for. And for an angel that could be an exceedingly long time.
With the purr of Baby’s engine a calming buzz in his ear, Dean reached out and took Cas’ hand in his own. “So to answer your question, I don’t know what label to give us. Boyfriends? Lovers? Whatever you want, Cas. And if you wanna call us mates, I’m cool with that too.”
“No, Cas. We both know that if you’d refused to follow those orders they would have given you another optical lobotomy and sent you off, all reset to factory settings, to do it anyway. You didn’t have a choice.”
“Dean!”
Dean swallowed and when he spoke again his voice had somehow found the strength he needed it to have. “That’s not an option!”
Tonight that need for each other that bonded them profoundly, yet distanced them in mutual silent understanding had shattered, exploded and all but consumed the Angel. The internal barrier that had kept those emotions at bay from his constant thoughts, kept them distant, faded, blurred, yet not forgotten, had disappeared the moment Dean's lips found his. An all new consuming rush forced itself to the forefront of Castiel's self, it's overpowering brightness casting every other thought, feeling and most relevantly doubt, into shadow. Racking up the volume of his need in a new way that made it impossible to ignore. Completely impossible.
Dean peeked at him, pausing for a second to admire the sparkle of his Angel’s eyes that were shining with delight, making the stars above them seem dull and lifeless in comparison.  “Yeah, it is.”
“Thank god for that,” Sam smiled, “You two have been so sickeningly sweet around here recently I was in danger of catching diabetes just watching you two.”
“Did you figure anything out?” the younger Winchester asked, dumping a small stack of books and files onto the table top, pulling out a seat opposite the couple and sitting down.
“How many kids do you think I’m having?” Dean asked dismayed as Sam brought in yet another box, while Cas frowned over instructions for something called a baby sling.
But none came.
Again, Dean ignored him as he stormed inside, twisting and slamming the door in Castiel’s face, before the Angel’s encroachment into Dean’s personal space could give him the opportunity to follow him inside.
As relief at hearing his Angel’s voice washing through him, Dean couldn’t help but let out a chuckle at the absurdity of Cas’ question. He had just spent the best part of the day potentially searching for the Angel’s corpse and the first thing he’s asked is if
Whatever the cause, Dean now couldn’t sleep without his Angel.
It wasn’t a question, Cas was stating a fact, but Dean nodded anyway, slowly. “Where are you going with this Cas?”
For once, everything had gone without death, or leaving them all in a far worse situation than they had been to begin with. He hadn't had to give his life to save the world. It was a win - in every way. Which may have been a first for the brothers and certainly the closest to a happy ending a Winchester was ever going to get.
Decision made, Dean spoke, “Okay, so, what’s that then? How can I help?”
Dean was leant against the wall staring off at nothing, his bloodied fist resting on his one raised knee, when Sam found him.
The last two weeks had passed in a mass of pleasant days and pleasure filled evenings for Dean. Apart from a few salt and burns, there had been no hunts, no matter how much Sam searched. Seems the hoards of evil had taken to hiding as word spread that the Darkness had fled because of the Winchesters. So, aside from a handful of ghosts, who didn’t seem to have gotten the memo, all was quiet on the hunting front. And Dean was more than happy to devote the extra free time to his new mission in life.
Dropping his voice to barely a whisper, Dean turned the tables back onto the Angel. “What are we to you?” It wasn’t the total subject shift that he wanted, but it was the best his panicked mind could conjure at the time.
“Shut your face!” Dean snapped, shouldered passed him and stormed out of the store. Half tempted to drive off and leave the Angel behind.
“Alright! Alright!” Sam slammed his palms over his ears before his brother could overshare. He’d walked in on enough tender moments between the couple in the last two weeks. Luckily, they had kept the heavy stuff for the privacy of what was now officially their bedroom, so Sam had escaped the worst of it, but he still didn’t need the mental image. “TMI dude!”
While he skinned and diced the fruit into bite sized portions his eyes flittered, repeatedly, to the pot of coffee that Sam had evidently started up not too long before. Watching with disinterested interest as the near black liquid dripped steadily through the filter, collecting in the glass jug below. The aroma it created wasn’t holding the same appeal as it would usually, but it wasn’t aggravating his stomach either. And maybe, he considered, maybe it would ease off the tiredness that had been stubbornly plaguing him recently.
It hadn’t changed.
, but he had been with a woman. He wasn't a virgin. He'd had sex when he was...
The look Cas was giving him sure looks like he’s trying to work out how Dean knew about the damage, but after a beat he regroups. Either letting it slide or not wanting to delve into it, Dean isn’t sure which and both would make sense to the hunter. He was an expert on pushing down the bad memories until they don’t affect you. Or at least he thought he was, compared to what he’d seen in Castiel’s head the Angel trumped him in every way.
It wasn’t the closed in and watched feeling he got in the cell, he had always managed to get the rest he needed while remaining on high alert before.
Cas sighed, his sight still locked on the road ahead, unable to meet the hunters eyes. “Nephilims are conceived when an Angel’s grace impregnates a human soul... and souls are genderless, Dean.”
With his order placed, Dean slid into the booth opposite Cas, dropping down a coffee for each of them on the plastic tablecloth. The diner was already getting pretty busy for so early in the evening. They had been lucky to be seated.
Though part of him wanted to protest, Dean didn’t say anything when Cas slid him across into the passenger seat, taking Dean’s usual place behind the wheel himself. He hated anyone else handling his baby, but right now, with the waves of nausea washing through him, making him lightheaded, Baby was probably safer in the Angel’s hands. Even if Cas was acting super spooked right now.
The expression on Sam’s face when he looked up chilled him. He knew that look. It was the same one Sam always wore when he was reluctant to say something Dean wasn’t going to like, but was going to say it anyway.
But that was before.
“I’m really sorry I got you involved in this, Buddy,” he whispered over Cas’ sleeping form. And in one last moment of weakness, he leaned over and pressed a lingering soft kiss to the Angel defined cheek bone. Kissing goodbye to the idea of ‘them’. He’d been foolish to think for even a second that what he and Cas shared could be anything more than a close friendship. The guy was a freaking Angel, he deserved so much better than the messed up, broken hunter, with so much blood on his hands, so many scars on his soul, that Dean was sure not even a crossroads demon would have wanted the tattered mess anymore. It wouldn’t be worth a worn nickel, let alone the love of an Angel. Worthless. Hell, the demon would have probably charged
When he had first started feeling he had believed that he couldn’t share his burden with others. His brethren would have viewed him as an anomaly in need of fixing and the humans that had become his friends could never understand.
Castiel chuckled at Dean’s wide eyed expression. “I could, but I’m not going to.”
Sam looked over to where Cas was indicating. The date read less than two weeks later. The day they had rescued him. “Seven out of twenty-three?” Sam questioned with shock widened eyes. “How is that possible?”
That was the first time Dean had found himself caught in the most penetrating stare from the bluest eyes, that even the darkness of the barn hadn't dulled. He would get used to being looked at with such intensity over the years, but in that first time he remembered his stomach flip flopping in nervous excitement, his heart pounding 'til it was all he could hear, in a way that had nothing to do with fear, and thinking Castiel was the most beautiful thing he had ever laid eyes on.
Eventually he started tuning out what he was seeing, only glancing in long enough to call to him and see if that Cas would respond in any way. He didn’t want to see more than that, but he couldn’t stop what he heard. The magnitude of voices, sometimes hearing Cas’ own, but mostly others. He heard his own voice more often than he liked. “You can’t stay.” “Nobody cares that you’re broken, Cas. Clean up your mess!” “You’re the famous spanner in the works. Honestly, I think you came off the line with a crack in your chassy.” “Top of the Christmas tree Castiel, no more than a doop.” “Next time I won't miss!” “You are expendable. Weak.” “I just followed the sound of your pain. You have no idea how loud it is.” “You don’t even die right, do you.” “I ask you to help me. Please. Save me from doing the worst.” “I’m sorry Dean.” “I don’t care!” “You are broken, Castiel.” “How many times have you tore into my head and washed it clean?” “Frankly, too damn many.”
“What can I say,” Dean grinned mockingly, arms wide as if to show off his very much ‘not dead’ status and goad her for believing Sam’s clever bluff, “it never seems to stick.”
“Okay, okay, bad choice of words on my part,” Sam said passively, holding his palms out. “But come on, man. This is Cas. Do you really think he’d do this to you, without telling you, on purpose?”
"Okay. Lose the pants," Dean instructed quickly, nodding down to the Angels lower half. Cas followed his gaze, frowning as if confused how the remaining clothes had out lasted all the others.
"We don't have to, Cas," Dean said in a reassuring whisper. The Angel had said he wanted more, all of it, but if he was now thinking it was too much, too soon, Dean wasn't going to push it, wasn't going to force Cas into anything he wasn't ready for, as if he could. "If this is-"
“I am,” Cas confirmed, as Dean got himself comfortable. “I’m finding the android very compelling. How being around humans showed him the value of life. I can relate.”
“We will,” Cas promised, his words as solid as a vow, eyes shining in sincerity that only Dean’s angel could muster. “I’m not going anywhere, Dean.”
“He called out in warning to a specific group of us,” Cas explained, his words flying out in anxious excitement. “The same angels I was with when we found the human parent that survived.”
Or could Heaven be responsible? The sudden thought had his stomach twisting up in dread. Would they have done something to Cas for lowering himself to being with a worthless human? Would they think it blasphemous? Would they punish Cas for it? Is that what was happening right now? Was that only Cas’ vessel laying in Dean’s bed? Was the real Cas in Heaven getting punished...or reset? His throat seemed too small at the thought of it, chest too tight, the air too thin.
Trying to mentally will himself to pee proved to be the hardest part about taking the test. Not only did he not need to go, but holding the test in one hand and his dick (literal proof that he was a man!) in his other just looked fucking absurd and made his bladder go shy. Or maybe it just didn’t want to be part of this insanity.
“You could have prayed,” Cas stated, matter-of-factly. “I would have heard it.”
“Can I get you anything?” The woman repeated, speaking more slowly, looking at him curiously as if she was trying gauge if he was drunk or simply distracted.
“Itches a little,” Cas replied sounding a little irritated, but definitely not in pain. Which Dean suspected was more to do with the Angel losing his mojo than anything else. Hell, Cas hadn’t even noticed he’d been wounded until Sam had pointed it out to him.
With a sharp nod Cas’ hands came up to bracket Toni's head in a vice like grip.
“It’s too late for explanations now, Cas!” Dean growls out, his face reddening by the second. “You should have warned me
“Oh-kay.” she droned out slowly, raising her brows, before sliding away.
“Sam,” Dean sighed grumpily, leaning forward and turning pleading eyes up to his younger brother. “I’ll try everything from lobster to fish sticks if it’ll get you off my back and allow me to eat my breakfast without you nagging my ear off.”
It nuzzled innocently against his palm, happily buzzing away in recognition of the grace of its Father, that perfectly matched its own. The hunter’s voice seems to be stubbornly stuck in Castiel’s head,
Castiel let out a relieved breath, causing a trail of goosebumps to prickle across Dean’s overheated chest. “So, what I did was correct?”
It was true. The young Nephilim did look uncannily like Castiel and was only getting more so as she grew. Sam was convinced that once she reached adulthood you could put her in a trench-coat and a backwards tie and pass them off as twins. But when it came to her expressions, and mannerisms, that side of the Nephilim she had inherited, one hundred percent, from Dean. The more the child's personality developed, the more apparent it was becoming. Yet because Castiel had kept himself away he hadn’t seen it.
If the woman who served him thought anything of him ordering a popcorn and soda large enough to share and seats on the back row she didn't comment on it.
(See the end of the chapter for
A ball of guilt gripped at his stomach. He’d behaved like a dick to Cas all day because of his own misgivings, and at a time that Cas had already admitted was intensely confusing for him. Cas had told him he loved him, he hadn’t used those exact words, but the meaning was clear as glass and Dean had said nothing, just ran off like a little bitch at the first opportunity. After years of mixed signals and friend-zoning, the Angel deserved better.
“Leaving no witnesses to share the info.” Sam concluded. “So if they find out about Dean-”
With a snappy nod, Dean dashed from the room. Sam heard his speeded footfalls growing fainted as his brother made for the supply room. A man on a mission. He rose to follow after him, but as an afterthought, paused to pluck a couple of hairs from Castiel’s head. They would need them later. Pocketing the strands, he left to catch up to Dean.
Sam hid his pleased smile, not wanting Dean to see just how happy he was that his plan was working and Dean was actually cooperating. He already knew that burgers, bacon and eggs, were on the ‘don’t even mention them’ list, as they had already been rejected - literally - before. So he stirred clear of suggesting those. “You want to try some chicken?”
“One?” Sam gasped out, his face crumpling mournfully as his eyes flit back and forth between Cas and his brother worriedly. “Out of how many?”
Ten days, eighteen hours and thirty-two minutes. Time was passing both far too quickly while all too slowly for Castiel. The plan for Dean’s rescue, while simplistic in outlining proved far more troublesome in execution and had eaten up far too much of both his and Sam’s time. While Castiel had focused his efforts on a way to counter the warding in order to get Dean free, Sam had begun tracking down other hunters that might be able and willing to aid them and increase their numbers and therefore their chances. Both had proven more problematic than was ideal.
Sam swallowed nervously, “...And Dean?”
“Because I can’t look at her!” Cas shot back, fresh hot tears spilling free as he rounded on the Winchester.
’ He scoffed at the thought.
(See the end of the chapter for
“He said it shouldn’t have happened. He’s just as surprised as you are.”
Dean could feel Cas’ smile as he brought their lips together and couldn’t help but match it through their kiss. “And, for the record, you’ll never need mojo to get me horny.”
They were sat on the hood of the Impala, the cooling and fast disappearing pie between them. Dean had driven them to what he had called a ‘make out spot’, whatever that meant. The Angel hadn’t questioned it. Regardless of what it was called the location was beautiful. Open landscape scattered in wild flowers for miles around them and far enough away from any major roads and cities that the sky was clear of any pollutants, making the stars above them appear that much brighter. Not that the Angel was paying much attention to the scenery.
Before he could accuse Cas of doing just that, his second thrust skimmed over it's target sending another just as powerful jolt of pleasure coursing through him, and another, and another. He loses all thought. "Ah Cas!"
So so so sorry for the long delay on getting this chapter up. It was a battle and I've lost count on how many times it has been re-written now. Your comments and support and knowing that people are waiting got me through it and stopped me tossing in the towel.
“Please, don’t!”
... and
Castiel nodded slowly, his gaze fixed on Dean.
It felt right, that Cas would be his first time receiving, that Cas was going to be the first inside him.
“The only way to guarantee your survival would be to-” Castiel paused, like he was struggling to find the words, or he knows the words but was reluctant to voice them. He bows his head, staring at the table top so as to avoid looking at either of the Winchesters. Sucking in a sharp breath he powers the sentence out. “We would have to terminate the pregnancy.”
“What the hell was that back there, Cas?” Dean glared, intermittently jumping his eyes to Cas’ while he worked, earning himself a confused head-tilted squint in return. “You can’t go charging in like that. You could’ve gotten yourself killed.”
“That’s all I need.”
The first brief read through had brought light to some procedures that Dean had been subjected to and led to Castiel storming off in what Sam would accurately describe as an angelic temper tantrum, dragging a protesting Dean behind him. Sam hadn’t seen what followed, but enough of Dean’s voice had echoed back for him to get the gist.
Cas’ arms were raised high above his head, chained to the warehouse ceiling, leaving him defenceless. His trench, suit jacket and tie stripped off, leaving him in only his dress shirt which was sliced open in multiple slashes and bloody.
Cas’ head tilted as the Angel frowned in confusion. “Why?”
He tried to ignore the growing uneasy feeling in his stomach that hadn’t started that long ago, but was stubbornly staying put, causing his mouth to water near constantly. But he wasn’t about to let a little nausea ruin things for Cas.
“What happened?” Sam was already leading the way, back towards Dean’s room, as he asked, Dean following briskly behind him.
“I can’t anymore,” Sam said, shaking his head adomently. “Reading about Dean like he’s nothing more than a damn lab rat. How can you stomach it?”
He lost count of the amount of doors he opened, shouted into, calling to the version of Cas he found there, not daring to actually enter. The action became repetitive, a habit. And that somewhat helped him to distance himself from what he saw there, reminding himself over and over, it wasn’t real, none of this was actually happening, it was only a dream... Before he finally - FINALLY!- got a reaction.
“Does it hurt?” Dean asked, pressing gently to the side of the wound on Cas’ left pectoral, gauging his reaction. If Cas had been human they would be fatal, but his Angel was barely bleeding and only seemed mildly annoyed by the whole ordeal.
His voice wavered and he broke off to stare skyward, chewing on his lip while he got back hold of himself. When his eyes drifted back down he found Castiel’s mouth had fallen slightly open, his eyes turning remorsefully wide. “It was not my intention to cause you worry.”
Sam side-eyed him with a weary look of annoyance, but the look he found when he did gave him cause to pause and reconsider. How long had it been since either of them had pulled a prank on the other? Okay, it hadn’t been that long, but this wasn’t something Dean would normally be comfortable making jokes about. Sam’s surprised he’s even talked about it at all.  Making jokes, didn’t fit.
But Cas had been following Heaven’s orders without question back then, like the good little soldier he had been at the time. He wasn’t the same Angel anymore. He made his own rules. Yet Dean knew Cas would still do whatever it took to protect those he cared for. Terminating a pregnancy to save Dean’s life? There would be no question from the Angel. No hesitation. No doubt and probably no regret.

“They’re not supposed to be. Their pictures were on FBI’s most-wanted lists for a few years before they died.”
Castiel felt like his insides were going to combust with admiration for the hunter sat across from him. Dean would no doubt downplay it, but the Angel knew just how difficult what he had done would have been for him.
“That’s not going to stop him,” Dean warned, raising his voice to be heard over her panicked whimpers and watching her twist and turn pointlessly, struggling to free herself.
“Very similar, yes,” Cas agreed, his tone growing more confident with Dean’s understanding.
He was just pouring his first mug of coffee when his older brother skidded into the room on bare feet, wearing only jeans and a startled ‘deer caught in the headlights’ expression.
Castiel’s hands kept fisting and opening nervously by his side, like he didn’t know what to do with them.
“Your healing mojo must be off,” Dean grumbled as soon as it felt it was safe enough to open his mouth. “I still feel like crap.”
They had been searching the bomb site for hours now. The day had edged passed and the sun had started to set. Most of the fire had gone out, but a few still smoldered amongst the wreckage, providing only dim light for the ongoing fruitless search for the missing angel.
“Green.”
Cas had kissed him.
to come for Cas to see reason. Maybe he should have brought more than one test, maybe Cas will argue that the results can be wrong with just one. Still it was too late for that now. He’d cross that bridge when he got there.
“Cas?” he asked knowingly. “Have you killed a nephilim?”
But he has to do this! For Dean, to save him. To save the life of the man he loves more than anything else.
Though Sam hadn’t really known what to expect to find, his brother taking a sledgehammer to an interior wall of one of the bunker's many bedrooms was not on his list of possibilities.
The second Baby came to a jolted stop, Dean was out, leaving the door wide open and the engine idle. He strode towards Cas in long purposeful strides and clamped his hand firmly down on Cas’ shoulder, fisting the material, holding the Angel at arms length.
It made no difference to the angel. He would probably be able to consume everything on display behind the bar and still feel little to no effects.
Dean stormed through the bunker, on a warpath, a fit of hot angry rage. He needed a drink, a strong one, to calm down and sooth his splintered nerves, or make him forget this day happened, or allow him to pass out in a stupor of blissed ignorance. He’d take any of those options right now, But he couldn’t.
He snatched up the instructions. His eyes scanning over the text, searching for something he’d misread, or skipped, or done wrong.
“Just because the nephilim isn’t one-hundred percent human, doesn’t change the fact that you
“Will your wings ever heal?” This time Dean knows he saw a look as Cas double-takes.
“What? What’s wrong?” he gasped out in sudden panic. He was sure the needle hadn’t gone in far enough to reach the baby, let alone hurt him... but what if he was wrong? The sudden stunned expression that had completely taken over the angel’s features wasn’t filling him with confidence that he’d had only moments before. “Is he okay?”
“What makes it your style?” Cas asked, as he slid into the impala.
“Cas?”
He had stopped trying to guess how long he had been in this godforsaken place. There was no real way to judge the passing of time. He had been sedated often, with no way of knowing how long that sedation had lasted and there were no windows in either of the rooms he’d seen in this place, so he couldn't even track the passing of the days and nights.
“I think you need to look again,” Sam said sincerely, quietly catching Cas’ attention, dragging him briefly away from his guilty wallowing. “Yeah, she’s definitely gotten her looks from you. You two are practically a mirror image of each other... But everything else, Cas, that’s pure Dean... and I'm not just talking about the bowed legs and chewing with their mouths open,” Sam laughed, trying to lighten the mood, in hope that he would get a smile, even a ghost of one to break the tension that was so ripe, he could almost taste it.
The mere memory of it caused Deans insides to twitch excitedly. In his wildest fantasies he hadn't imagined anything close to the reality.
Absolutely any other words.
He took back up the charm and striding from the room towards the medical bay he called to Sam over his shoulder.
Castiel keeps his eyes forward as he talks, not wanting to see the pity he knew would be on Dean’s face. He didn’t deserve any sympathy, he had caused the fall. His brothers and sisters would never fly again because of the Seraph’s misguided trust in the wrong person. “I didn’t have my grace during the fall.”
“There’s nothing to talk about.”
What if he was?
Giving his Angel the answers and support he needed in their solitude, with no one around to make judgments, assumptions or sneered whispers, was an empty victory, but Dean took it all the same. It made Cas smile and that was good enough for him.
Dean was sitting forward in the seat, stoney-faced and on edge, his eyes solely focused on the part of the road that Baby's headlights plucked out of the darkness.
Castiel nodded in agreement. “Usually,” he emphasised, “it is not a simple process.”  Weeks on and they were still none the wiser as to how Dean had conceived. The angel was still firmly of the opinion that it shouldn’t have happened how it did.
Slamming the door shut behind him, Dean hunched over, gripping his knees and trying to drive the image from his own mind. He was sure that if he was actually here, actually in his body and not a mental projection, he would have thrown up.
Color flushed Cas’ cheeks and seeing the blush, Dean mentally upgraded Cas from his 'dorky Angel' to his 'adorably dorky Angel'.
Castiel should have known he would be too stubborn for his own good.
He’d made Baby for his baby
“Hm-hmm,” Castiel hummed in agreement, before pointing out another part further along in the log. “And this here.”
With the ringing of the explosion dying down in his ears, Dean looked up and watched as the dust settled to reveal a doorway shaped hole in the wall, exactly where he had wanted it to be.
“Yes, Sam,” Castiel responded, freeing his hand from Dean’s light grasp and quickly healing the hunter's wounded knuckles before he could have a chance to object.
Cas nodded sadly. “But the nephilim, whose lives we ended had done nothing wrong. They were innocent, Dean. As innocent as our own.”
While they searched, Sam waited. Waited to see if Dean would bring up the subject. He doubted it, it was not Dean’s way to voluntarily open up, he was more likely to bottle everything up and never let anyone see that side of himself, but he gave his brother the chance anyway...
Picking a direction at random, there was no difference between the two, he had a fifty-fifty chance, he hurried down the corridor calling for the Angel at the top of his lungs. He hadn’t ran long when something caught his eye and he came to a skidded halt. The door to his right was slightly different to the others. It was the same spotlessly clean white of all the others, identical really in every way, but it was just
Dean glanced over to the viewing window that the asshats hadn’t even tried to disguise as a mirror, just left it clear for anyone to look in on him, like a fish in a bowl, as they passed by.
That’s what Gabriel had said. He was an archangel. He should have known. But he had said plenty of untrue things.
Now, he’d gotten out of the remade Impala to walk towards the stars. Dean was pretty sure he could get himself there, if he kept walking; he had forever. As much as he liked Heaven’s front entrance, Dean was pretty sure he couldn’t trust himself until he saw behind the screen. Sammy wouldn’t even miss him.
“All I can do is write my thesis about it.”
“So, uh...yeah.

It's also fortunate Dean's existence is entirely contained, in that moment, in his soul. Castiel's professional Enochian "I love you" splinters cracks through the stones of Hell and makes demons shrink, blacken in their pursuit. The calling-card would have likely caused Dean to bleed from any extant ears.
Spill a little blood.
