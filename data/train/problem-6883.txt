indoor sprinklers, but that was the only explanation that made sense. How else was he supposed to explain it, magic? Later, he would make terrible jokes about the two of them being so damn hot that it just started raining to cool them off, and his jokes would make Steve shake his head fondly before he dragged him up to bed. Later, he would actually rationalize it raining inside the house in a way that made
As soon as the meeting ended, Steve left, not wanting to hear anything else Rumlow might have to say. Tony kept pace with him, following him all the way back to his office. Neither of them said a word. Steve suspected it was for the same reason—they didn’t want anyone to overhear them.
“They’ve been all over this station for almost three weeks,” Steve said flatly.
“I don’t know yet,” he says honestly. “There’s a lot in the Accords that I don’t agree with, that I can’t, in good conscience, sign. I wish I could. I want us all to be able to stop hiding. But I can’t compromise my values.”
to go out with him, let alone someone as incredible as Tony. But it should have been obvious. He had been nervous. He’d asked him to a
“It’s not like I’m doing it on purpose,” Janet snaps back.
Trying to defuse the situation, Steve says, “You know, Tony, there’s a lot of product here. You’ll want to be careful, you don’t want to spend too much money up front. You need to be prepared to survive twelve months without a profit.”
“Sure, just didn’t know you were riding around with Tony again.”
really. He carefully picks Tony up, carrying him like a koala so he can tuck Tony’s face into his neck, and walks him into the room Steve is sharing with Sam. He places him down on the bed, slides his shoes off, and pulls the blankets up around him before texting Sam to stay in Natasha and Wanda’s room when he gets back later.
Steve chuckled. “Best act of the night. I’m glad Dottie got over her dislike enough to give them the award.”
miss you. And Rhodey. And—” He stops before he can say Vision because, after all, Vision spends a lot of time with Wanda, and he’s sure that Tony knows that. “We miss you,” he repeats. “That’s all I wanted to say.”
Oh fuck, Bucky was
“—to make them friendlier to those who have risked their lives to protect us from those who see this world harmed. The Accords are meant to protect all people, including superpowered individuals themselves, and that is why, effective immediately, the Accords will include protections for the individuals we call superheroes, both powered and not.”
uncomfortable by hitting on
“What are you doing?” he asks curiously, pushing aside the curtain that divides the rooms. He stops dead in his tracks as soon as he sees what Tony has done to the room. Tony must have had an insomniac episode last night and come in to work on this because it’s been
think she would have the wherewithal to realize that there was an angry mob gunning for her head.”
“Okay, now that’s just rude,” Tony teases but he’s grinning as he says it, so Steve counts it as a win.
“What do I think about Tony?” Steve asked, sitting back in the couch. He glanced over at where Tony was standing in the kitchen, blinking slowly at their calendar. Steve smiled fondly at the sight, looked down at his folded hands in his lap, and then back up. “I like him a lot. I’m—uh—I’m very happy I met him.”
something whispered to him out of the darkness.
“Never.” Bucky clearly knows it’s a lie, given his snort, but he doesn’t press, just gives Nat a warm hug, murmuring something in Russian to her, and nods at Sam. Sam nods back, and Steve thinks that’s the end of it, but then he catches Bucky giving Sam a shy look from under his eyelashes when Sam’s turned to thank their pilot, and
If DUM-E could talk, Tony bets he would be asking what good a bedtime story would do.
He climbs out of his bed, gently nudges Tony awake, and says, “Hey, Tones, budge over.”
And Steve
Tony yanked Steve into his office as soon as he arrived. Steve nearly stumbled over his feet, but quickly caught himself and followed Tony inside, glancing curiously at him as Tony closed the door behind them. They hadn’t really spoken since their argument last week, and their show on Monday had been so stiffly polite it had left their fans puzzled over what could have happened. Steve wouldn’t say that he and Tony were
Steve is looking him in the eyes, the only time he’s ever done so while Tony was naked. He doesn’t even insist on Tony magicking up his clothes, though Tony does anyway. He likes it when Steve is looking at him. He doesn’t want Steve to look away just because he doesn’t want to wear the clothes.
Steve was furious, furious and heartbroken all over again. He’d
Tony sounded odd, almost worried, and Steve looked up from his vacuuming to see him staring at the window behind him.
“We have things to do today, Tony. Important things.”
He thinks about it for a moment, then begins, “Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tony—”
“And I’m not your mate.”
He turned back to the bed just as the lamp on the nightstand clicked on, revealing Tony leaning up on one elbow, his other hand sleepily rubbing his eyes. Steve bit back a wince. He’d always thought Tony was adorable when he was tired—and he probably always would—but that line of thinking led to trouble.
“What?” Tony asked from the couch.
Tony looks up at him with big wet eyes. “What are you doing? You didn’t like him anyway.” He immediately clams up, eyes getting even wider, as he realizes what he just said.
“I—well played.” Tony glares at him; Steve gives him a lopsided smile. “Still. He’s not something we have to worry about anymore. And, uh, and Carol’s back now too. Decided she was gonna take a break from saving the universe or whatever so she’s back on Earth, turns out she’s friends with Nick Fury, so that was weird. I didn’t know the man had friends.”
He brushes Tony’s hair away from his forehead and leans down to kiss his red nose. Tony’s face scrunches up, but he slowly blinks his eyes open.
Uncle Grant coughs. “Yeah, kiddo. I’m sure you will.”
“Sweetheart, you’ve been called many things, but subtle isn’t one of them.”
“Apparently, when I clicked on the text, it ended the call? Which, I didn’t know phones could do that, so I will be fixing that just as soon as we get out of this hellhole. Also, I have some thoughts on the name—”
Bucky nodded solemnly. “Ashamed.”
He sighs. “You are. All of you. I can’t sign when you three can’t.”
“No,” he says firmly. “It wasn’t. You did what you felt you had to.”
“Tony—”
“You know we’d love to have you,” Uncle Grant says immediately. “But—”
“Not sex,” Tony said immediately. “Just—this is what people do when they get fired, right? They go out and they get a drink and they talk shit about their fucking awful bosses?”
He taps the phone against his chin, thinking. It could be a trap. If it had been Steve planning a message like this, it definitely would have been a trap. But the house in Sweden…he doesn’t think Tony would compromise that, compromise the best memories of his mother, just to catch Steve.
“We’ll just have to find a better one,” he says quietly. He shifts back into his salamander form and scampers off into the brush.
“Thanks.”
“You’ll always be a kid to me.”
“Tony?”
He wraps up his phone call with Pepper and heads into Morgan’s bedroom, where Steve has apparently given up on their daughter’s bath and is now trying to wrestle her into pajamas. Steve shoots him a desperate look as he walks in. Tony nods back with a reassurance he doesn’t feel, places a hand on Steve’s shoulder, and leans in to kiss his cheek.
Her voice says she’s just curious but there’s a glint in her eyes that says she’s definitely going to judge him based on his answer, so he takes a moment to think it over. She’s tiny with something like coiled energy already in her so probably not too much caffeine but she scents
” Tony shrieks from the backroom. A moment later, he shoves back through the curtain. Steve sighs. Great, now he has to deal with this on top of trying to figure out what had Tony so upset only a few minutes earlier, and knowing Thor, it’ll be all over the town by lunch that Stark Apothecary is going under, even though it’s not true at all.
“I’m sorry,
Steve has a feeling that he probably wasn’t supposed to hear that, so he says instead, “You really think this could work?”
“…Howard?” Steve asks.
“Uh, hi?” he says, confused by Tony’s continued appearance. Vaguely, he wonders if he’s dreaming.
, and he doesn’t know if he’s ready for that. He wants to be. He wants desperately to ask Tony out for dinner and hold his hand while they eat and kiss him when he drops him back off at the motel. But—
that he thinks Captain America is his soulmate. It doesn’t make sense, for one thing. This Steve Rogers—if he is the original—has been in the ice for seventy years. He couldn’t possibly have met Tony when he was an infant.
He looked up at the grey sign reading
I’m Mr. Right—"
“Yeah.” Steve grimaces. “We’ve been talking about signing the Accords.”
They’d spent the rest of the semester in relative peace, even if they weren’t exactly friends, before separating for the holidays. That had lasted for a whole two days before Tony called him, told him he’d been disowned, and asked if he could join Steve for the rest of the break. Steve’s answer had been to drive all the way out to the Hamptons himself to pick up Tony and his belongings.
… well, Pierce might listen. Steve didn’t want to think that Pierce would bow to their whims, not with the show as popular as it was, but Pierce had cancelled shows in the past because of a lack of financial support, and without talking to him, he just didn’t know what would happen.
“Look, man, I’d sign in a heartbeat if I didn’t think we’d get screwed over the moment we had another Lagos.”
when you started asking us our opinions on the Accords, but I thought it was T’Challa or something, not Tony.”
“He’s on probationary status as an Avenger, which means he can’t be on complete house arrest or else he’ll never be able to train with the team. So, he’s confined to either his home or the Compound with the possibility of a lighter sentence depending on how he works with the team, to be evaluated at the six-month point.
Steve fought back a wince. He and Tony hadn’t chosen this topic. Every couple of months, Pierce came to them with a list of topics he wanted them to cover at some point during the quarter, and this was one of them. Both of them had pushed it off as long as they could, neither one wanting to relive their explosive breakup, but they’d apparently pushed it off as long as they could since Pierce had brought it up at the last staff meeting.
“Do you think that Mr. Barton or Mr. Lang abandoned you?”
“You look,” he murmurs, leaning down to blow cool air over Tony’s nipples, “so beautiful.”
And then, as night fell, Tony let out a sharp cry, staring wide-eyed at their backyard. Steve didn’t need him to tell what had upset him; he could easily see it: the shimmering scarlet wall that reminded him of what they’d seen earlier when Wanda and Agnes had fought. It was coming toward them, slow and creeping and foreboding in a way that felt like the barrier in his mind.
“What?”
gone outside, then it was silly for Tony to be standing around in the kitchen calling for him like a nagging housewife.
“How about I fly over for Christmas?” he offers. “I can make it a surprise for Aunt Peggy.”
“Ah—” the god begins, and Tony immediately powers up the gauntlet, pointing it at him.
“Nope,” he says. He opens the door into his studio and ushers Tony in. Tony looks around curiously, taking in the airy space lit by the sunlight streaming in through the windows, the sofa in the middle of the room, the soft pillow beside it. He wonders what Tony is seeing. Steve had chosen this apartment specifically for this room—it’s perfect for his art—but for all he knows, it looks shabby to Tony, who, as a billionaire’s son, probably lives in a gilded mansion. “No toys, no sex.”
“Yeah. Come back here.”
But Tony is already pulling the framed receipt out of the bag, gasping softly when he turns it around and sees it. His eyes are shining in the lights from the fair, making him look even more beautiful than he normally does.
There’s a man in a black suit standing on the other side of the door. He gives Steve a tight smile and flashes an FBI badge. “Hi, Mr. Rogers? I’m Agent Jimmy Woo. I’m here to debrief you and Mr. Stark on the Westview Anomaly. Can I come in?”
Caller: Yes.
“But then, why—” Thor begins.
Okay, he has to stop thinking about this or he’ll drive himself mad. Oh, he hadn’t even thought of that. What if one of them has a mental breakdown and destroys the shop in a fit of insanity?
“Come on, Captain Crunch. Put your back into it.”
She stands, kisses his cheek, and leaves. And Steve is left alone with his swirling thoughts.
Tony shrugs. “I wanted to talk to Sam about some things.”
Tony neatly dismisses him, focusing on Janet instead. “We talked about this,” he says flatly. “You can’t just enthrall—”
You’re on air, how can we help you with all your relationship woes?
Steve frowns. “I thought Howard Stark was on the council. Shouldn’t he have—?”
“Of course I’ve thought about it,” he lies, not very well if the amused look Nat gives him is anything to go off of.
“Oh, so cruel!” Tony laughed. He kissed Steve again. “Thanks for the reminder about the florist. I’ve got such a smart husband.”
Steve is capable of facing down bullies and insane gods alike, but this legalese might actually do him in.
Tony sneers. “I can take anything you want to dish out.”
He plops down on the couch after checking to make sure he wasn’t about to sit on Dummy. “Where’s Dummy?” he asks, unable to spot the familiar anywhere.
“You do.” Again, not a question. “You do realize I’m living in a motel because I can’t afford anywhere else, right?”
Steve, Tony: Hi, Charlotte!
let alone a bed, but there it was.
“I take it you like it then?” Tony purred, running his hands up Steve’s chest. Maybe, if he was lucky, Steve would be so distracted by how he looked and take him upstairs and then they wouldn’t have to worry about any kids coming up to their front door. Tony could see the porch light from where he was; Steve hadn’t gotten around to turning it on yet, so no one would think they were supposed to be passing out candy.
“Half the congregation expects us to skip.”
“Tony,” Steve says warmly, heartened by Tony’s babbling. He hadn’t realized how much he misses that. Tony stops. “Scott Lang is Antman.”
Steve glares at him.
“Right.” Tony smiles crookedly at him, a little bashful, a little excited, and a little nervous all at once. “Are we ready to do this?”
Bucky just raises an eyebrow.
Morgan drops off to sleep before he’s more than a few sentences in the story, which he’s grateful for, since he only barely remembers the story. He stands and kisses her forehead before leaving, reaching over to turn off the light as he goes. Steve is leaning up against the hallway wall opposite Morgan’s door. He brightens as soon as he sees Tony and holds his arms out. Tony willingly goes to him, tucking himself under his chin.
Steve frowns. They’d been planning on him doing some of the unpacking at the store while Tony handles the vendor runs. Tony’s better with people anyway and knowing himself, Steve would probably manage to somehow talk the vendors into upping their prices, despite only needing to do pickups today. “Tony…”
They rearranged themselves exactly how they’d been before they’d gotten up, Steve’s arm slung low over Tony’s hips, Tony’s leg over Steve’s waist. There wasn’t any urgency though to move on from there. They kissed, slow and sweet and lingering, for long minutes as time passed them by, marked only by the slowly brightening sunlight coming in through the window.
Tony’s eyes went dark and heated. “Hmm that you are,” he purred, fingers petting lightly over his chest, slipping between the buttons of Steve’s nightshirt to stroke warm skin. Steve’s breath hitched, and he reached up to catch Tony’s wrist in his hand. Tony pouted at him.
Steve scoffed. “Come on, Tony, don’t you know better than to listen to that asshole?” It drew a reluctant chuckle out of Tony, and Steve couldn’t resist grinning at him. “Rumlow’s jealous he’s still stuck in the sound booth after all these years. Ain’t no way Pierce would cancel us. For fuck’s sake, we made talk show radio popular again.”
“No dog is potty trained,” Steve pointed out.
looking when it comes to Steve. He doesn’t like Steve avoiding him. It means no more cooling snow drifts, no more long runs through the Forest, no more hugs, no more
“Excuse you, I’ll complain about whatever I want.”
Steve presses play on the next message. “Hi Steve, it’s Tony. Just wanted to apologize for that last message—I think I called you Tony? And that’s not your name!” Tony awkwardly laughs. “You can just delete that message—voicemail? Sorry, um, I just wanted to give you some background information about my—

prepared for an interview—it had been one of the biggest fights he and Tony had ever had, including the explosive arguments during the final days of their relationship, and he’d never made that mistake since.
“As well she should,” Tony said archly. “I’m glad they moved here. It wouldn’t be Westview without them.”
blue eyes.
“Supposedly? Don’t you think it would be nice to be in love with your best friend?” he asks curiously.
Tony glares halfheartedly in that direction. “I’ll believe that when it happens.”
Well.
“And normally only mates get to see each other naked.”
To his further surprise, Tony was as docile as a lamb while turning out of the lot. Steve almost said something, but managed to keep his mouth shut at the last minute. He hadn’t ridden in a car driven by Tony in fifteen years. When they occasionally met up after work, it was always at one of the bars by Tony’s place, close enough that they walked back to his apartment building. He had no idea how Tony’s driving habits had changed over the years, and he doubted Tony would thank him for pointing out the change.
Steve chuckled and steered Tony in the direction of the door. “Better go make your phone call. You don’t want to be late for work.”
Steve, seeing an opportunity to tease his husband a little, says cheekily, “So you were downstairs trying to fix this whole mess? Which means you
Tony. Do you have
Dinner with Sam and Bucky was always nice. Steve liked to find supposedly “authentic” Cajun restaurants he could find in New York (not that there were very many) and drag Sam to them so he could listen to Sam, whose parents owned both a shrimp boat and a restaurant in Louisiana that Sam also worked at, rant for the entire meal about the inauthenticity of the restaurant. It was a fun game that Steve loved, and since Sam was never too put out by it, especially since Steve would always make sure to take them out the next morning for the best bagels in Brooklyn, he saw no harm in continuing the tradition.
Tony’s “lair” (as Clint calls it) is located at the very bottom of the ship. It’s here that Tony holds his court, making sure that the engines that run the ship are still intact and running smoothly, tinkering with other projects that the other crewmembers give to him, and designing improved systems for the
“You just like me for my body,” Steve accuses. It isn’t the truth and he knows that. Tony loves him for many reasons; Steve’s strength is only one of them. But it’s fun to tease his lover and Tony is always happy when he does. He frequently worries that Steve is too serious.
“A partner?”
there.
“Can’t make me,” Steve teases. He goes back through the curtain to grab his bag and then returns. “Do you mind if I hang out here today? I won’t bother you.”
It’s something about the dried nightshade, isn’t it? No, that can’t be right. There’s nothing wrong with the nightshade. Steve blinks into the darkness of his bedroom. Maybe if he goes into the store himself, it’ll help him remember the checklist. And maybe, if he checks on everything, he’ll be able to relax enough that he can fall asleep and at least catch a few hours before he has to get up tomorrow to open the store.
When he woke back up, the first thing he noticed was that Tony had moved away. Not very far, though, just far enough that his now-awake husband could take all of him in at a glance instead of only being able to focus on what part of him. And that was exactly what Tony was doing, eyes tracing over his face like he was trying to memorize every inch of him. Steve knew the look, he’d given it to Tony himself often enough.
“Yeah,” Tony said heavily. “I get that now. I—I’m sorry, Steve. I wouldn’t have asked about the fireworks if I’d known you hadn’t realized I was asking you out.”
“Oh,” Steve murmurs. That’s right; Tony had mentioned new team members during their last meeting. He just hadn’t thought it would be so soon.
“Yeah, I’m thinking about making a program that’ll help me with this.” Tony sits back and rubs his eyes. “Going through thirty thousand people isn’t easy. Last time, it took me four days, and I’m pretty sure I missed a couple people I could’ve crossed off.”
“Thanks,” Steve said sincerely. He and Tony always sounded good—they’d worked well together back in college—but it was still nice to hear. “So how about some dinner?”
“Maybe you should mention them,” Natasha says. “I think he’d like to know what you’re thinking. He values your opinion.”
He heads down into the belly of the ship, pausing once at one of the portholes to look out at the stars flashing by them. It still amazes him that humans have achieved all of this (and horrifies him that they achieved this but left their own planet behind).
superior. He and Pierce had a strange sort of friendship—though Steve wasn’t sure how much of a friendship it could be, considering Pierce only seemed to treat Rumlow like the employee he was—and it wouldn’t be the first time Pierce had told Rumlow something confidential before he told everyone else. But those times had always been for small things like the company holiday party, never for something like
“The most precious thing I’ve ever seen,” Maria says honestly. She stands, barely noticing as Ana slips from the room, and crosses to Tony’s crib. Her bright boy is asleep on his back, thumb firmly stuck in his mouth. She smiles at the sight. Howard has been trying to get him to stop sucking his thumb, convinced that his teeth will grow in crooked, but Tony hasn’t taken to his gentle admonishments yet, too little to really understand anything other than that his father is talking to him.

“You go get dressed,” he says. “An’ if you come back and want to snuggle up, that’s fine. If you decide you don’t want to, that’s fine too. Or if you decide in the middle of the night you’ve changed your mind either way, that’s also fine. But don’t let someone else decide that for you.”
“Since I asked nicely.”
“Oh, well, let me welcome you to town! Westview is a wonderful place to settle down, especially if you’re looking to raise a couple little ones, eh?” He winked. Vision looked awkward for a moment, then made a sound of understanding and winked back. Well, maybe he was from another part of the country and didn’t understand the joke at first. He’d heard some strange things about people from California; not everyone could be as wonderful as people from New Jersey. “Now, I’ll just go over a little bit about what we do here and then—”
tomorrow.”
“Because that
“Then we’re right back where we started,” Sam complains. “Split on this issue.”
There’s the faint scent of iron in the air as Tony’s emotions override his control, making the lights on the dashboard of Steve’s car flicker wildly for a moment before settling back down. This means a lot to Tony, Steve realizes. He doesn’t know how long it’s been since Tony and Justin dated but it must have really mattered to him when they broke up. He reaches out and squeezes Tony’s bicep comfortingly.
had Tony picked up a coffee for himself but not for Steve if he was running late anyway? Well, nothing for it. He placed an order to the coffeeshop down the street—not nearly as good as the place Tony went to, but acceptable—and groaned at the estimated delivery time. It was going to be a

“So, uh, don’t take this the wrong way—”

“Mmhmm. You’ve seen how he dresses, right? Suits and t-shirts?” She scoffs. “No.”
Maybe the night isn’t ruined after all.
He heard the front door open and looked over from where he was lounging on the couch, mindlessly watching some show he didn’t recognize. There was an odd look on Steve’s face that Tony didn’t like—troubled and worried all at the same time.
because of that. But that wasn’t all of it. I knew it was going to be a lot harder for him to run than it was for the rest of us. Tony isn’t someone you just hide. But he really seemed like he wanted to help, so I took that chance and told him where you and Barnes went. Clearly, that backfired on all of us, but my point is—I did trust him too.”
“Sure,” he said, sliding his hand into Steve’s. “Sounds nice.”
For those of you who have been absolutely lovely in your comments, thank you! Your comments have been delightful to read and really lifted my spirits over the last few weeks 💙
He holds out his arms, hoping for a hug. Tony all but collapses into him. Steve rests his chin on top of Tony’s head and holds on tightly, hoping that it could go on forever. Tony smells like sandalwood and magic and it’s so
“Hey, I’m gonna take Dodger for a walk

to be Tony.
to rub it in Tony’s face that he had moved on when Tony hadn’t?
“Hey you,” he starts to say, only to stop when he realizes that Tony doesn’t just look good in Steve’s clothes. He looks
Tony smiles softly and takes the card, rubbing his thumb over Steve’s name. “That’s pretty cool. I don’t know a lot of those.”
It’s time for a question of his now. “Are you still angry?”
Steve ducks his head to hide a blush. He ignores Tony’s words and instead says, “I think it’s a good idea, what you’ve got here, your whole plan of rebranding local potion ingredients and making and selling your own potions. There’s a lot of hedgewitches in the county, plenty of people to grow the plants needed for potions, but the closest alchemist is in Elmdale and they don’t have formal schooling, not like you. Very inventive, I think it’s got promise.”
Well.
“Okay.” Steve turns to hide his grin. He’s got a
They head back to Tony’s little work area, Tony eagerly chattering on about the project he’s working on for Natasha. Steve listens, fingers itching for the drawing tablet he’d left in the galley with Natasha and Clint. Tony is lovely when he’s animatedly talking about his inventions. Steve has half a dozen folders saved on his tablet, filled with nothing but different poses of Tony.
“What are you and Wanda up to today?” Tony asked. Steve took advantage of Tony’s distraction to grab the items on their list. Maybe they’d manage to make it through this grocery trip without going over their budget. He set off down the aisle, Tony and Vision trailing along behind him.
Tony ignored the second half of her statement, instead exclaiming, “What a coincidence! I’ve been following
Tony pauses in the doorway, looking back at him with a hopeful expression. “What are you having?” he asks, shifting from one foot to the other.
Tony curled up beside him on the couch, breaths coming shallow as they watched the wall bear down on them. Somewhere in the house, Dodger was whining. Steve remembered what he’d read about animals knowing when something was wrong, and he wondered if Dodger knew that something had happened.
That evening found the two of them at home with their two new pets, a little brown and white puppy and a grey kitten that had grown up together. Tony hadn’t been able to bear separating them, and Steve hadn’t been able to bear disappointing Tony, so they’d gone home with both. Besides, the dog had very obviously latched onto Steve (named Dodger, of course) and the cat (affectionately named Dummy for the not one, not two, but
But still…
“No, I get it,” Sam agrees. “It was a bad situation. I’m just saying that she won’t go back if it means getting locked up again.”
He thought about turning him down. He really
It was a quiet, awkward car ride. The only time Steve spoke was to tell Tony which hotel Sam and Bucky were staying at. For his part, Tony seemed about to speak a couple times but he always glanced over at Steve and shut his mouth again. By the time they pulled up to the hotel, he was more than ready to get out of the car.
Tony takes a bite out of a cracker, chews, and swallows before saying, “He’s good. I’m working on a set of leg braces for him. If I can get them to a reasonable cost, I’ll add a new division to SI, medical tech and all that, you know. It’s kind of a racket and I don’t want to add to that.”
That was when it started raining.
It’s like a switch flips in her. “Oh, well isn’t that the cutest thing?” she coos. “I’m Janet, Tony’s sister and fashion coach. I’m currently studying business too.” She holds out her hand for Steve to shake, which he does. “Sorry if my hands are too soft. I’ve just been sampling a lot of product and Tony’s got this Baby’s Breath Skin Cream, it’s supposed to be making your skin as soft as a baby’s so…really soft.” She winks at him.
He laughed nervously. “That’s not possible. Everyone has a home here. We’d know if she didn’t have a home, wouldn’t we?”
“And you fought back. Were
“Don’t look at me like that, it’s definitely a word.”
“Not long,” Tony told him. “A few minutes at the most. What do we have to do today?”
Well, Tony was supposed to do that but he’d forgotten. It’s okay though; Steve learned how to wire the lights himself so that’s all good.
“Right,” Steve replies faintly, staring down at the huge grey cat glaring back at him. “Um, enthrall?”
Well, there goes his evening, he decides. The paperwork’s going to have to wait. This is more important than the paperwork and a luck spell requires a lot of time and concentration. He texts Luis not to worry about the sandwich and heads upstairs, license and frame in hand. This’ll be an all-night affair.
Steve panics. That’s the only explanation he can give for blurting out, “They all come framed.”
“Yes,” he snaps, wincing when it makes Tony flinch.
“Please.”
dog is able to do a trick like that. We, however, have Dodger, and he’s not nearly smart enough to figure out the bathroom.”
Steve gives him a filthy smile. “Let me show you how much.”
“And, Steve?”
“We’re going
“Tony, that wasn’t your fault. Zemo was—”
Tony looked at him oddly. “…Yes?” he said slowly, brow creased as though he was trying to puzzle something out. “Why do you care?”
“It’s clean,” Steve informs him. He’d made sure to do a thorough cleaning right after arriving, knowing how much Tony appreciates a clean house. He grabs two mugs—old novelty Avengers mugs that Clint had found at a garage sale—out of the cupboard and pours some of the coffee he’s kept heating into them. He adds cream and sugar the way they like and hands one mug, the black and red one for Natasha, to Tony as Steve sits down at the kitchen table.
“JARVIS, lock the door, please,” Steve asked politely, wincing a little when he heard the noise made by a body bumping into a metal door. “I’m going to cook us something to eat. Anything special you would like me to make?”
“No, I CAN’T! I have to finish this now. It’s my job, or you think everything you see here, everything the team uses, everything you use is paid magically?! Of course not, I pay for everything with the money I get from my company which happens to sell the things I do here. So, leave me the fuck alone once and for all! DON’T I KNOW WHEN TO STOP!”, his fists hit the desk in order to emphasize the last sentence.
"Where are you going?" Tony insisted as he sat up.
Short chapter, I know, I'm sorry. I promise next one will be longer.
After that odd entrance of Tony, he had remained glued to Steve, and he had refused to let go of him no matter what. Steve didn’t really mind, there was no way he was going to leave Tony unattended, especially when he was crying; though he had to admit that dealing with Clint while he had all Tony’s limbs around him almost strangling him wasn’t easy. It had been an odyssey just to get Tony to let go so Steve could dress Clint, and Tony had only agreed to be put down on the floor, but not to get away from him.
“I already told you the two ways you can leave this room,” Steve said calmly, not moving at all.

“You gotta be kidding me!” Tony exclaimed when Steve took the book once more. “if you’re going to continue reading, why are you keeping me here?” he complained.
“I can’t, I have a lot of work to do,” Tony stated, trying his best to look as he was busy with something. If he could just remember what that something was, his act would have been more realistic.
At the beginning, Tony was emphatically determined not to make use of the cameras for that purpose, and focused hard on trying to think of something else he could do. But as days went by, that seemed to be the only option and temptation became harder to resist, until one afternoon Tony finally succumbed, finding himself having JARVIS show him on one of the screens placed in his workshop what Steve and Clint were doing. Five seconds, enough time to see they were simply training, and Tony had JARVIS vanish the footage, feeling extremely guilty for violating their privacy and promising he would never do it again.
The scene Phil witnessed when he entered the kitchen made him want to laugh out of frustration. Clint was standing in front of the kitchen island with both hands on the jar blender, blinking non-stop trying to keep the milk that ran down his face away from his eyes. Phil didn’t even need to ask what had happened, the mess around Clint, as well as the forgotten lid next to the blender, showed perfectly well what had come to pass.

"Well, for instance,
“N’body,”
Steve stood there with his mouth half-open, his brain trying to comprehend what just had happened.
Infantilism, that was the term they used, and he surely had no idea what it was back then. The books in the library had no information about that topic, and the Internet wasn’t completely available back then.
“Yeah, I’m still here. Yes, a large pizza with extra cheese, that correct,” Steve said into the phone, “are you sure you don’t want peperoni?” he said into Tony’s ear, but Tony shook his head as the grip in his shirt tightened. The small frown on Tony’s face told Steve he was still a bit resentful for being put down on the counter while he made the phone call, so Steve refrained himself from insisting. “Okay, thank you so much,” he said before hanging up.
“No, I didn’t. JARVIS would have already warned us about it if I had done it. Here, let me see.” Steve took Tony’s hand into his hands and looked carefully at it. The knuckles had already started to swell up, but Steve couldn’t feel any broken bone when he tenderly touched the hand. “Some ice will have to do. Come on, let’s go to the kitchen.”
“Apology not accepted,” Tony replies primly. Steve grins at him and for a moment, it’s like nothing is wrong. They could be back home in the Tower or at the Compound, joking around with each other like any other night. But they’re not, and Steve’s grin fades as he realizes that nothing will ever be the same again.
“Slowly,” he admits. “But he’s out there. I’ll find him eventually.”
“The whole—” Tony makes some sort of wavy motion with his hands that Steve doesn’t even remotely understand. “—Attraction thing.”
He goes home that night, exhausted but happy. They’d gotten a lot of work done today. The store is really coming together, and he’s bizarrely proud of that fact. It seems ridiculous. It’s not his store and Tony has made it abundantly clear that he doesn’t want Steve’s help unless he’s forced into it, but Steve is still really pleased with everything they’ve accomplished.
“I still have reservations,” Steve tells him. “I don’t feel comfortable signing anything while there’s still the possibility someone other than a superhero has access to the list. But I can see why you thought I’d be willing to sign.”
“Kind of had to in order to piece them all together.”
“You’re coming home,” Tony whispers, and the words sound so right coming out of Tony’s mouth that Steve has to kiss him again.
“Yeah, no, I—I looked it up last night. I know it wasn’t deliberate.”
Good for her, Steve thinks approvingly. It might be too little, too late, but at least one of Tony’s parents is standing up for him. As if she heard the thought, Maria glances in his direction and smiles at him. He nods back before Carol stops in front of him with a small handful of Poison Detectors (they glow blue if something is unfit for consumption, which, if he’s being honest with himself, is definitely something that the café needs).
It was a gamble. He didn’t know if Tony would understand that he was teasing and not genuinely being mean. Fortunately, Tony did seem to get it because he shot Steve an amused look. “He’s lying, Betty dear, you can’t believe a word he says. I’m wonderful.”
“Then you can take the ice without complaining, can’t you?”
“So those are just business dinners then?”
“Hey, sweetheart,” Steve replies. “I brought you some soup.”
Tony laughs harshly. “I’m really not.”
Steve winces. “Has he seen a doctor yet?”
“You haven’t even seen what’s inside. You might not even like it,” Steve says.
“That one on YouTube is.”
“You didn’t bring a present,” Steve points out.
Steve nods thoughtfully, turning his notebook with his notes on the Accords over in his hands. He doesn’t know if he agrees with her that this is accountability, but maybe even just the illusion of it is what people need to feel safe.
He nodded and got back to work, leaving her to head backstage on her own. Or, no, not alone; Geraldine was there with a comforting hand as soon as she reached the stage. Steve smiled and ducked his head, grabbing the next couple chairs Dottie wanted moved.
good side to this is that I think I’ll have enough leverage now to push for the arc reactor project.”
“Fair enough,” Tony agreed.
Tony shifts again.
—you tell me what I don’t want to hear but need to anyway, and Steve, I really hope you can hear what I’m trying to say here because—”
“Yeah but I would have gotten arrested for punching him, so maybe I’m not the one to emulate, huh?”
“I know that
“You should be. It’s gross what I—”
Don’t just put them down any old place; they should be magical!”
Steve had always had a more than decent grasp on military strategy. “That paints a target right on our backs.”
“Alright, come on, you useless bag of bolts. I need you next to the computer so I can plug you in.” He glances at the repurposed microwave that he turned into a fabricator last month in the corner of the room. There’s about an hour left on the fabrication time for DUM-E’s new strut. That’s more than enough time to finish the coding and install the new strut before Rhodey’s ROTC thingmajig (some sort of awards dinner, he thinks, but he doesn’t like to think about Rhodey and the Air Force so he didn’t listen when Rhodey told him about it) gets out in two hours. He might even have enough time for a trip to the laundry downstairs.
to get there early. His face isn’t betraying anything other than disdain as he wrinkles his nose at the shabby safehouse.
“Yeah,” Steve replies. He crosses his arms, trying not to hunch. He has no reason to be defensive. Tony should have been expecting this all along. He couldn’t really have thought that Steve would just leave him frozen. “Shuri and one of the Dora Milaje have been working with him.”
It’s the most hesitant Steve has seen him since the first time they talked after Siberia, but at least Tony is agreeing. Tony drops off his bag in one of the bedrooms, which heartens him a little bit. It means that Tony is staying the night, right? He busies himself preparing a small snack of cheese and crackers—Tony has to be hungry from his long flight—and pours two glasses of water before carefully balancing all of it on a tray and carrying them out to the living room. Tony joins him a few minutes later, accepting his plate and glass with a small nod.
“You’ve had a second,” Tony complained, but his hips stilled.

on his overheated skin.
Oh. Wow. That’s—that’s actually pretty impressive. “How did you find her?”
“Okay,” Tony says, letting out a humorless laugh. “Yeah, Steve. Things are just
He aches to give Tony a hug, soothe his mind until it quiets enough to let him sleep. There had been a time once, a time before Ultron, before the Civil War, before Siberia, when he knows Tony would have welcomed his touch. He would have let Steve pull him into his arms and take him upstairs and tuck him into bed, maybe even curl up under the blankets with him until Tony finally dropped off to sleep. They had never moved beyond the shy touches and quiet words, but Steve had held out hope for the two of them. But then Ultron had happened, and then Bruce and Thor were gone, and then Tony was leaving too and that had been the end of whatever they’d been building up to.
circus. Right, he’d forgotten that one had rolled into town earlier that day.
Tony: It wasn’t?
“They’re not in Europe,” Pepper says patiently.
“Going through the census data again?” Uncle Grant asks him, carefully nudging Tony with his elbow (Uncle Grant is always
“Darling? Everything okay?” he asked. He glanced down at Steve’s empty hands. “So Agnes didn’t have any buckets, huh?”
“Hmm, yeah?” Steve asked, trailing a line of kisses down Tony’s neck to the open vee of his shirt.
As soon as the “On Air” light came on, Tony affected a bright smile, even though none of their audience could see him, and said, “Welcome back to
It’s desperation that drove Steve here.
“They’re not even properly homophobic!” Tony complained.
“And the Registration Act is a compromise?”
Steve did know what those groups were like. And he knew that it didn’t matter what they were like as long as Pierce stood up to them, but that was never going to happen. He and Tony had both known that.
It sounds kind of nice actually, although Steve does wish that the packaging was a little different. Still, it’s a neat set of enchantments and positively gorgeous craftsmanship, so he has to admire the vendor’s skill, even if the name leaves something to be desired.
“Of course,” Steve says automatically, holding the door open wider. He refuses to think about the possibility of this being a trap, even though he knows what the rest of the team would say if they knew Tony was here. Tony’s had plenty of opportunities to bring him in before this. “Is everything okay?”
“Jim Rhodes,” she’d told him. “You two boys better stick together. You’re gonna need each other, being as young as you are.”
“I like it,” he says honestly. “I wish I could be there to support you.”

“I get that you’re worried about me, and I appreciate that, I really do. But I know better now. I’m not going to let myself get hurt by Tony again. He’s just—he’s convenient, that’s all.” As soon as he said it, he winced. He knew how that sounded and it didn’t make him look good. It wasn’t even really what he thought. Sure, Tony
“That’s as good as playing them for the whole town,” Tony argues.
To his surprise, the phone isn’t ringing, just lit up from a text message. He frowns. He supposes that he knew, somewhere in the back of his mind, that the phone didn’t necessarily have to be used for emergencies but somehow, he’d always thought that that’s what Tony would use it for. He hadn’t thought Tony would use it to send texts, especially not less than a week after Steve nearly… nearly… well, especially not less than a week after Siberia.
The next day, he heads back to the store. Tony is alone in there this time, other than that monster of a cat, no sister in sight, which makes him breathe a sigh of relief. For all his years in New York, he’s never met anyone with succubus blood before, but he’d done a little bit of research last night. It’s entirely possible that Janet had been telling the truth yesterday. If her ancestor is far enough back in the family tree and if she really didn’t get any formal schooling, it’s possible that she really doesn’t have any control over her abilities. She sees someone she’s interested in and she wants them to be interested in her too and her powers respond to that. It’s simply biology.
trying to prepare for him. And now he’s gone.”
The flip phone, sitting on the nightstand next to his bed, lights up.
“She’s a regular Wicked Witch of the West,” Tony agreed. “You really think she’d notice if we weren’t there?”
“For what?” Tony gaped at him. “Oh! For the glass. I must have forgotten. Of course, you get that broom and I’ll finish up here.”
as disorganized as Tony is. He can’t quite figure out if Tony just decided to lease the apothecary on a whim or if he actually had a plan and something just threw him off his rhythm before he came in here, but either way, none of this is an actual description of his future business.
Not anymore, at least.
That’s—
He follows the two women out, stopping to murmur lowly to Bucky, “Don’t make him do something he doesn’t want to. This isn’t like me and all those women you kept trying to set me up with.”
“Well, there can be only one.”
“Oh, Steve, darling.” Tony pats his arm condescendingly. “It’s cute that you think that would work.”
“Yeah, you said it was some kind of project for an art class?”
It’s a low blow and he winces even as he says it. Their life is rough enough without him begrudging Wanda for finding what little happiness she can and fighting to hold onto it.
“Never,” Tony declared, poking him again. That time, though, Steve caught his wrist and reeled him in, wrapping one arm around Tony’s waist. He bent Tony backwards over his arm, kissing him deeply. Tony hummed happily and wrapped his free arm around Steve’s neck, letting his mind go blank as Steve kissed him quiet. He’d called Steve down to the kitchen for a reason. What was that reason? He tried to think about it, but Steve’s kisses were terribly distracting. Well, if he couldn’t remember, it probably wasn’t important. He’d probably think of it later when Steve was down at the gallery.
“No.”
He doesn’t want to admit that he’s getting worried. He knows it’s destiny—everyone meets their soulmate eventually—but he’s almost thirty-eight years old, and he still hasn’t found his, and he doesn’t
“I don’t think that matters to people like them,” Steve pointed out.
“You’re firing us instead,” Tony said, hands clenching the armrests of the chair so hard his knuckles were turning white. Steve was almost surprised he couldn’t hear the wood creaking under his grip.
“He doesn’t have it,” Natasha chimes in. “I already checked.”
“A whole year away?”
“—but he had a heart of gold too, and he made the princess feel less lonely—”
at me unless I’m wearing clothes.”
Rhodey eventually has to go, called back to his pointless war in the sand, and Tony calls Uncle Grant.
“…And then what?”
Steve: Some stranger than others.
Steve tells himself he’s not disappointed by that.
” Natasha mutters disgustedly.
“I like pizza,” Tony says with a small smile. “With sausage?”
Jarvis is the only one who knows about this particular hiding spot, which is probably why it’s Tony’s favorite. Tony does like his sulking, and he gets frustrated every time he has to give up a new one because everyone else has found it. But this one is just for the two of them. They’ve spent hours up here sometimes, watching clouds drift lazily across the moon. The boy is laying on his back, staring up at the stars, though Jarvis doubts, from the glazed look in his eyes, that he’s really seeing them.
“No, that just sounded bad,” Steve protested half-heartedly. There really wasn’t any saving himself from what he’d just said. He would just dig himself a deeper hole, but he tried anyway. “I’m convenient to him too.”
He doesn’t know how long Sam and Bucky spend talking—hours, possibly. He passes the time by talking to Tony, who is currently in an early morning board meeting and doesn’t want to be. Tony’s complaints make him smile, and he can’t resist gently teasing Tony about his inability to pay attention the way he should be. Tony’s rapid response is that he shouldn’t be encouraging him the way he is, and that’s true enough, but he likes talking to Tony too much to stop responding.
Tony hesitates. Steve can practically see him ask himself if he should just turn around and leave.
“You’ll tell me if something is uncomfortable?” he checks. Tony nods. “You can talk. We’re going to be here a while an’ I won’t be taking any pictures of your face.”
“You know me so well,” he jokes.
“But then everyone followed you to help you take down Hydra’s soldiers. Tony and I thought that we were still fighting about the Accords. I realized differently during the fight; that’s why I changed sides, even knowing it meant breaking the Accords and going on the run. But I don’t think Tony knew until he talked with Sam at the Raft.”
“I get it,” Tony offers. “I know what it’s like to be underestimated.”

with him, like he thinks Tony will break if he’s not gentle enough).
He wants to insist on knowing what happened to the Sentinels—he’s seen what can happen when Tony hides things from him—but he knows what will happen if he pushes the issue. They’ll argue, again, and he’s so very tired of arguing with Tony. And after everything that happened in Siberia, he doesn’t think he gets to judge Tony for keeping secrets.
She speeds through her bath and brushing her teeth. Normally, Tony would insist that she go back and brush them again, but at this point, almost an hour past her bedtime, he’d just like to get her to go to sleep.
Tony tilts his head so he can look at him through one eye. “He doesn’t want me here.”
“Please.”
Steve: Fair enough, you’re terrible at planning.
Steve has the most beautiful blue eyes.

“I really think you have something here, and I want in.”
Aww, that’s adorable!”
“No.”

“Such a charmer, you,” Tony teases. He stands and promptly sways on his feet. Steve makes an executive decision and scoops him up, ignoring Tony’s protests in favor of carrying him to the bed where he dumps him on the expensive sheets and stands there until Tony stops protesting, pulls off his shirt (no, Steve does
Steve resigns himself to spending the rest of the afternoon listening to the entire story about Luis and his cousin Ernesto.
It gives him a little thrill to think that Tony thought
“What’s not okay is ghosting your partner—”
Tony breathes out a quiet sigh of relief, almost too quiet to hear over the phone. “Thank you.”
about rising.
Tony smiles at him and nudges Steve’s side with his elbow, laughing again when Steve makes a fake wounded sound and clutches his side. “I know. Thank you.”
“But that’s a good thing, right?” Steve asks desperately, not sure what else to say when Tony looks so distraught.
Steve; he’s
Steve’s never had a familiar before—enchanters don’t need them the way witches do—so he hadn’t known before this that familiars need shots just like regular pets. Bucky has a cat back in New York—Alpine, a gorgeous long-haired cat. Bucky always takes video footage of Alpine after a trip to the vet, laughing as she bonks her head into her cardboard boxes and falls over her own two feet, a far cry from her usual gracefulness. And now he can’t stop picturing Dummy traipsing around the store, high on whatever anesthetic they gave him before the shots. It’s a pretty fantastic image and before he knows it, he has his sketchbook out, drawing a picture of Dummy.
And they had indeed. Getting Clint in the shower hadn't been easy, Phil had had to chase him all over the kitchen, only catching up to him when he slipped on a puddle of milk and fallen down, landing on his butt. Then, Phil had had to comfort him before coaxing him into taking a shower. And because there was no way he was going to leave Tony by himself, he had taken him into to the bathroom with them, sat him on the toilet and asked him to wait for them. Tony had disliked the idea, since he still wanted to go to his room and put on something to cover the pull-up he was clearly not comfortable with showing. A huge pout appeared on Tony’s face while he continued pulling down his t-shirt, his eyes fixed on the door.
"That's what I've been fucking telling you all this time! It's obvious the serum didn't improve your understanding ability!" Tony exclaimed before pushing Steve away from him. Steve let it happen.
It was okay, it wasn’t like Steve was complaining. He loved cuddling with Tony and he didn’t really mind spending a few hours doing that. But that didn't mean that was all Steve wanted to do. The fact that Tony hid like that meant he wasn’t comfortable with all this yet. He was still getting stressed by the situation and he was supposed to be doing the opposite.
“I… I can’t.” Tony whispered. And it was truth. Tony had to admit that he could get a bit childish, but he had never completely slipped into his Little mindset in front of anybody. Never. And just the thought of doing it made him nauseous and uneasy. The feeling of being doing something incorrect took over him without being able to do something about it. Steve sighed deeply.
“No buts,” Steve warned, and he hurried to continue in order to avoid giving Tony the chance to argue any further, “and I don’t want to hear you say anything more about it if the only thing you’re going to do is disagree with me.”
“Clint?” Steve called, "what's the matter?"
“NO,” Steve denied, maybe a bit too loudly, because Tony shuddered a little. “No, Tony, it wasn’t your fault,” he continued, calmer.
Tony didn’t want to be little right now. He couldn’t. But the more he tried to get rid of those mental pictures of Steve hugging and cuddling him, the harder it was to keep his little self at bay.
And please, as usual, if you saw a typo or some incoherent sentence, please, let me know.
Tony turned a little bit and reached a pillow that was next to him, hugging it and burying himself deeper into the fleecy blanket, which was incredibly comfortable – did he own a fleecy blanket? Right now he couldn’t remember. He moved a couple of times more in order to find the best position to let himself fall into unconsciousness again, and cursed when his foot hit one of the bars. Damn bars, why were they so close to him? When Tony woke up again, the first thing he’d do would be getting himself another bed, one whose bars weren’t that close to the edge and wouldn’t be on the way when he tried to move and stretch.
“I DON’T KNOW!” Tony shouted, more for fear than bravery.
“Everyb’dy does.”
The dreams that were automatically forgotten when awakening were the worst ones. Whether they were good dreams or bad dreams, it didn't matter, Tony would like to know what had caused the smile or frown on his face. Feeling uneasy without knowing the reason just made him feel worse, that make it impossible to reduce the impact.
Anyway, let me know what you think, and as usual, if you see any mistake, please let me know. :)
Despite his stubbornness, Tony had to admit that the captain was a freaking genius in his own way. Steve had given him everything he had always desired but never dared to get or ask for, and now he had taken everything away, leaving Tony with a sensation of emptiness. Truthfully, Tony had been the one who had asked Steve to stop doing what he was doing, but that wasn’t the point here. The point was that this whole situation was pushing Tony to the verge, he longed for Steve’s attention and care, and the absence of it was making his mind unstable, making it difficult to stay in his adult mindset.
First, Steve hadn’t really been reading the book, just staring at it lost in thought – there was no way Tony knew that, though. And second, Tony had been the one ignoring him, that had been why Steve had gotten the book.
“JARVIS, is he OK?” Steve decided to ask the AI, knowing that the chances he could understand Tony were almost non-existent.
“No! It’s mine!” Clint shout, crushing the sippy cup against his chest.
Yes, no turning back now.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I know you know what I’m doing. I told you what I wanted to do,” Steve confirmed, confused. Tony’s jaw dropped almost comically.
Steve drew a breathless sigh, too tired himself to continue pushing Tony. “okay, okay, you little blackmailer,” he consented as he dropped a kiss on the tip of Tony’s nose, “but only because you were such a good and brave boy today,” he praised. Tony’s face crinkled in confusion. “Yes, you were. It takes a lot of courage to speak up the way you just did. Daddy’s so proud of you, sweetheart. But don’t think you’ve gotten out of this one,” he hurried to clarify when a small mischievous smile crossed Tony’s face. “we’re gonna go back to sleep, and when we wake up, daddy’s gonna do nothing but pamper you. But the next time we play, I expect my baby to tell me what he’s really liked so far.”
“Boarding school isn’t so far,” Jarvis offers, not sure if he’s trying to convince himself or Tony more. “It’s only a few hours. If we’re staying in the Hamptons, we can even come visit you. What do you say to that?”
“Right,” he says, because he doesn’t want to argue with his maybe soulmate. “SHIELD. I can talk with SHIELD.”
Okay, so maybe going right into the business details was a bad idea.
“Edwin’s got this really nice watch, right?” Rhodey continues, grinning down at Tony as the boy settles deeper into his side. So maybe most people don’t realize how special Tony is when they meet him. That’s okay, because Rhodey’s there and he’ll make sure no one else ever hurts him again.
“What?”
"OK Tony, if that's what you want, I will," Steve said as he left the room, leaving Tony with a nasty taste in his mouth.
It was very likely that Clint was somehow taking advantage of the situation, and even if Steve knew he should do something about it, he couldn’t bring himself to do it. Besides the fact that Steve didn’t want to risk driving Clint away, after his conversation with Phil earlier that day, he felt a bit guilty for not even realizing how he had been making Clint uncomfortable. And the worse part was that Steve would have never become aware of the way he was treating Clint if Phil hadn’t pointed it out.
“Come here, kiddo,” Steve called Clint, holding a hand out to him. Clint shook his head before hugging his knees and hiding his face behind them. Steve was starting to get really frustrated because of how many times he had been told ‘no’ that day. “Come on Clint, come here, come here sweetheart.”
Tony began to take deep breaths as an attempt to slow his breathing down, but after endless seconds, it became obvious he couldn’t. Something was wrong. After a nightmare, uneasiness was what he usually felt, sometimes anger and disorientation too, depending on what he had dreamed. However, what Tony was feeling now wasn’t any of those things, but fear. That was definitely not right. He couldn’t even remember when the last time he woke up and felt scared was. Perhaps when he was still a kid, or maybe a teenager. And yet, right now, Tony was sure he was frightened.
“Then just lie down with me for a while, you do need to rest,” Steve said as he stood up with Tony in his arms. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck and his legs around his waist instantly, showing Steve that way that he certainly didn’t mind spending some time as little. “But first let’s change you into something more comfortable,” he announced, earning a grunt from Tony. He knew for sure what items of clothing Steve thought as comfortable.
Wait. Daddy?
Except he couldn’t.
“Are you going somewhere?” Tony asked when he saw Steve replacing his t-shirt with a plaid shirt.
“What is it, sweetpea? Don’t you wanna change?”
In other circumstances, Steve would go back to the living room to find out where Tony had gone to – Tony wasn’t the only one who experienced anxiety due to separation – but not this time. Besides rubbing his eyes and yawning, Tony had also been squirming, so imperceptibly that Steve wouldn't had noticed if he hadn't been paying close attention to him. That squirming told Steve that Tony was heading to the furthest corner of the room now, and he would stand kind of awkwardly there for a moment. Just as he had been doing lately every time he needed to pee.
Now the only thing Tony needed to do was get used to that little headspace, because his first experience with it had been quite scary. Tony had never needed someone as much as he had needed daddy right now, and he wasn’t sure how to cope with that. Daddy had been there today, but what would Tony do if he needed him as badly as he had now and daddy wasn’t there?
“Hey, baby,” Steve greeted when he was sure Tony was listening to him. Tony’s face twisted into a pout before his eyes slipped shut again, making Steve chuckle. For someone who was always so reluctant to go to sleep, Tony sure had a hard time waking up. “No, come on sweetheart, it’s time to wake up,” Steve repeated, shaking Tony a bit more.
“Downstairs. Coffee,” Tony muttered, already leaving the kitchen. Steve hurried to catch up with him, placing a hand on his shoulder to stopped him from continuing walking.
“I wonder how it ends,” Tony wondered out loud, his mind already picturing himself on Steve’s lap, leaned against his chest, listening to him while he read the words in a way he brought the story to life. Tony never told Steve, but the nights he had read to him, Tony had had such peaceful sleep.
It hadn't been the first time Steve's departure went unnoticed by Tony, the mission hadn't been a life-threatening one – not as far as Tony knew – and it was only going to Steve a day to go back home; yet, Tony hadn't been able to cease the crying. The scene of him sobbing hard as he called for his daddy while Phil tried to soothe him was utterly ridiculous. Phil shouldn’t have had to explain him that Steve couldn’t go back yet. Tony should have calmed down and waited patiently for him, without making the fuss he had made; but his brain had refused to listen to reasoning, and the only thing he had been able to focus was on the fact that his daddy wasn’t there.
“Hold tight, honey, daddy’s gonna get the supplies,” Steve asked once he had put Tony down on their bed, patting his left tight affectionately. By the time he made it back to the bed, Tony’s face was lost behind a pillow. If Steve had thought nothing could embarrass Tony more than being diapered, he had been mistaken. Being changed out of a wet diaper could totally make him reach a higher level of embarrassment.

“Does it really bother you that much the fact that I want to express my affection by looking after you? By coddling you?” Steve asked, voice serious. Yes, he wanted Tony to agree to age play, he wanted to show him how things could be, but what Steve didn’t want was doing something that Tony wasn’t comfortable with. Even if Tony had argued several times that Steve shouldn’t, he will always put Tony’s needs before his.
Yes, Phil was right. Steve wanted to try that so badly. The problem was he didn’t know if Tony would like it. Because, even if in Tony’s mind things looked the other way around, he was the type who needed to be looked after. Needless to say Tony wasn’t very keen of the idea, all the times Steve had tried to persuade him to do something to take better care of himself had already left a bad taste in his mouth. And Steve would feel very disappointed if he was turned down when he finally decided to tell Tony about the Age Play.
The following morning, his mind was a total mess. In the first minutes after Tony woke up, before he was fully conscious, he curled into a small ball and allowed himself to enjoy the sensation of complete safety and comfort that surrounded him. Unfortunately, only a few minutes later, an awful headache started pulsing at his temples – because, okay, he’d had way too much alcohol and his body wasn’t as resilient to the substance as it had been twenty years ago – and all that feeling of peace vanished in a flash, his heart skipping a beat when he got a glimpse of the bars around him.
It had taken Tony an embarrassing amount of time to calm down. Steve had ended up sitting down on their bed, where they currently continued, Tony curled on Steve’s lap, the trail of tears still fresh on his cheeks. Tony’s mind was still a mess, trying to understand what had just happened but getting distracted by Steve’s caresses.
“Yes,” Steve agreed without taking his eyes off the book.
“Did you wash your hands?” Steve asked when Tony reemerged from the bathroom. Tony nodded shyly while he pulled his t-shirt trying to cover himself. What for? Steve didn’t know, he had seen him naked more times than he could remember. "Then let's go back to bed," he suggested, stretching out his arm so Tony held his hand.
“Can,” Tony babbled again.
If Tony had chosen to go without diapers, Steve wouldn’t have tried to talk him out of it; though he wasn’t going to deny he was glad Tony hadn’t. Besides the fact that he thought his baby looked extremely cute in them, Steve could swear diapers helped him to remain in his Little headspace more easily.
“Do you want to give it a try?” Steve proposed, being ambiguous on purpose. “Come on,” he encouraged, gently grabbing Tony’s arms and showing a warm smile when this one looked up at him.
“No, I haven’t. At least not more than I usually do,” Steve stated, enjoying how Tony bit his earlobe and played with it.
“I know sweetheart, but we have to,” Steve said. The wriggling that endearment caused didn’t go unnoticed. “Why did you push Clint that way?”
The more he knew about the topic, the more clearly he could explain it to Tony.
“Noted, Sir,” JARVIS confirmed, a blatant tone of disapproval in his voice that Tony preferred to ignore.
“I wanna go,” Clint informed, taking Steve aback.
“That’s not what I meant, JARVIS, and you know it,” Steve argued. Even though JARVIS had told on Tony a few times before, it didn’t mean the A.I. did it all the time. There was certain information Tony forbade to share no matter what, and Steve was afraid this fell into that category. “Has Tony been sleeping in this room? In the crib?”
“C’mon, you can’t sleep here, the couch isn’t that comfortable,” Steve lied, it’s was more than obvious that Tony had furnished all the Tower with the finest and most comfortable furniture on Earth, but there was no way Steve would let him sleep there.
Clint had been in a horrible mood when he arrived home. Catching up on reports tended to have that effect on him, and since Fury found out that Steve was writing Clint’s reports for him, he had forbidden it. Now, Fury made sure Clint had definitely been the one who had made the report, and if he failed to hand three reports in a row, he was called into the headquarters and wouldn’t be allowed to leave until he updated everything. Today had been one of those days.
Except that, in Tony’s head, they had.
“I’m fine,” Steve assured, and it was almost true. He wasn’t going to deny he was in pain, but it was nothing he couldn’t handle. It seemed that everybody tended to forget he had the super soldier serum in his system. His injures might be serious, but it would take him only two or three days to heal completely. Most of his wounds had already started forming scabs.
But obviously Tony wasn’t going to do fulfil his request, not when he had been trying to get out of this for more than an hour now. As soon as Steve moved away to grab the diaper, Tony stood up fast and walked away, totally forgetting the fact that his jeans were around his ankles. He tried to keep the balance, but by the seventh step he took, he fell down flatly on the floor.
His hunches usually turned out to be true.
Kneeling down gracefully, Steve leaned over enough to be able to kiss his baby on the temple as he placed a hand on his tummy. Tony scrunched up his face a bit before slowly slitting his eyes open, blinking several times and yawning as he slowly came to his senses.
Daddy wanted to be a daddy and he had never denied that, quite the opposite, actually. If Tony wasn’t willing to let Daddy take care of him, he couldn’t really blame Daddy if he looked for somebody else who did enjoy and did need his attention and care. Tony couldn’t blame Daddy if he wanted to replace him, and what better replacement than Clint? That outcome shouldn’t be shocking, not really, Tony should’ve foreseen things would turn out that way. Clint was much better at age playing than Tony, and even though Clint’s headspace was a bit older for Steve’s liking, they got along pretty well.
“No, you don’t,” Steve affirmed, “you love me.” It was true.
Except Tony was afraid he wasn’t, not really.
“Fuck!” Steve heard Tony murmur a curse after feeling a slight shove in the bed.
“It was certainly one of the shows I’ve been to.”
He isn’t surprised when first Scott and then, a few days later, Clint come back with signed copies of the Accords, ready to go home. He takes both copies and calls up T’Challa to let him know.
He knows Tony’s been seeing someone. Tony won’t tell him who, which makes Rhodey suspect that they’re probably much older than Tony’s underage ass. And if Rhodey knows anything about Tony, it’s that he tells Rhodey everything, which means it was probably whoever his partner was who convinced him to keep it a secret. That alone would be a red flag, even discounting the age difference. He’d tried a few times to get Tony to give up the name of whoever he was seeing, but eventually gave up after Tony lashed out at him in a screaming match that resulted in their RA getting called on them. Looking at Tony’s black eye now, he wishes he’d tried harder.
Tony’s rising cock is tenting the front of the romper, leaving a small damp patch on the silk. Steve leans forward and nuzzles it gently, smiling as Tony moans helplessly, before rising to his feet, hands trailing up Tony’s legs to his hips. They stay there as he guides Tony back to the bed and gently pushes him to sit down on the edge. Tony takes the hint and lies back, shifting so his head rests on the pillows.
to kiss him then, so he did, nuzzling Tony’s lips open with gentle kisses, then licking into Tony’s mouth when it parted on a soft gasp. He drank in all of Tony’s noises as he rocked against him, letting out quiet moans of his own every time Tony’s cock slid against his, the touch muffled through two layers of fabric, but no less potent for that. Tony was intoxicating, he always had been since the day they met, and Steve was more than happy to get drunk on him.
“I’m going to get you the money, Tony,” Steve says, far more confident and assured than he actually feels about the grants. But when he sees the way Tony’s face softens and his eyes shine, he realizes there’s not a thing he wouldn’t say or do to keep Tony smiling like that.
Tony blinks at him.
birthday.
“Are you out running?” Tony asks.
“I’m terribly sorry, Mr. Stark.”
As soon as he’s gone, Steve dials the only number programmed into this phone and raises the phone to his ear. It only rings once before it goes straight to voicemail. He lowers it, frowning at the phone as though it’s the machine’s fault Tony ignored him.
“Both?
She waves her hand airily. “Love is for children.”
Oh. And that’s when it hits him—a way to solve both his crush and Tony’s clear misery. He clears his throat. “You, uh, you hear about the fair down in Elmdale tonight?”
Tony: Exactly. Anyway, grand gestures! These can really make or break a relationship. You don’t want to be like that guy who followed that girl around with a trumpet until she agreed to go out with him.
Well, this at least puts them back on familiar footing. Somewhere, in the back of his mind, he wonders if Tony did that to put him at ease again because it’s so easy to tease, “No, no, what you’re supposed to say here is that you’re glad I invested in your business because of all the things I do for our store.”
“Au revoir!” Luis calls out as Tony leaves. The door swings shut on Tony’s loud swearing.
He chuckles and slides his hand behind Tony’s back to hold him close while he moves the ice in smaller and smaller circles, watching Tony’s nipple pebble. “You don’t have to buy it,” he murmurs, wondering how fast he can get Tony out of his pants and into their bed. “You just have to take it.”
. At the café this morning.”
try to discourage any sort of close relationship between them, platonic or not, but he
“Steve?” he said into the darkness. Steve hummed sleepily. “I love you.”
“Hmm,” Tony hummed, but he didn’t look convinced. Steve flashed him a quick smile, as reassuring as he could make it when he was so discombobulated, and took off in search of Dodger again. Hopefully, he hadn’t gotten into Tony’s lingerie drawer. They might have just gotten the dog, but Tony would pitch a
“Do you think I could get away with ‘it was certainly one of the shows I’ve been to’?”
“Ah, sorry, no,” Vision said.
“Wow, Tony Stark admitting he can’t jury-rig a solution from his lab. Hell must have frozen over,” Steve comments, grinning when Tony turns to scowl at him.
Steve blinks at him.
Tony, trusted him not to pull some stunt like he had today, trusted him not to remind him of what they could have had if only Tony hadn’t taken that job. Instead, Tony had done just that and taken what few pieces of Steve’s heart weren’t shattered and stomped on them.
“Hmm?” she asks, though he’s sure she knows what he means.
Peggy, to put it simply, frankly adores her godson. Before Tony, she’d never held much interest in children; her mind had always been consumed with work, with the mission, with the agents who already looked down on her, never mind if she’d ever paused long enough to get pregnant. With Steve, she’d allowed herself to briefly entertain the thought, but even then, she’d had so much trouble even picturing the end of the war that any thoughts of life after that had been nebulous at best. And, well, she’d never really thought of herself as the mothering type. She would never judge any woman who decided a family and children are the best choice for her, but for herself? Out of the question.
“You’re just saying that because you don’t want me to take off for Europe and leave you with the company,” he replies, reaching across the desk to steal her wineglass. Without looking, Pepper bats his hand away.
“You missed dinner tonight,” he says quietly, taking care not to startle Tony. Tony just huffs and rolls over onto his stomach so he doesn’t have to look at him. Jarvis sighs and sits down next to him, running a soothing hand down Tony’s back. “Ana made stroganoff, just for you. You know how much your father hates stroganoff.”
Tony comes hard, shouting his pleasure. Steve swallows every drop before pulling off, eyeing the way Tony shivers.
“We’ve been working together for five years. If all else fails, maybe it’s time to think about moving on to other shows.”
“Oh. That was nice of him to do for the store.”
Tony was snoring quietly, his dark curls tickling the bottom of Steve’s chin. Brown, he thought, but that wasn’t right. Tony’s hair was a dark grey. It always had been. Steve always said it made him look distinguished, even though his young husband was still struggling to grow a beard. He liked it when Tony’s hair looked like this, when it was riotous curls instead of the slicked-back style he usually wore when they were leaving the house. But maybe today, the day of the talent show, Tony wouldn’t bother with styling it.
“What, nothing for me?” the redhead asks.
“I just think that’s cause to celebrate, don’t you, sweetheart?”
“Okay,” Tony says simply, and Steve loves him for how much Tony trusts him. His eyes turn mischievous, and he smirks. “But I want you to know that I’m buying the DVD. We’re going to watch it every year on your birthday because, really, this horror can’t be lived only once.”
“What, throw popcorn at movies every time they mess up a translation?”
As Steve is heading out to meet him, Natasha stops him just inside the front door. He bites back an impatient urge to tap his foot, even though he
“Sounds good.”
And when he walks in to find Tony seeming both triumphant and shattered, a nervous frenetic energy to him that has the air smelling of iron and things randomly flying around the store, he thinks that he’s right. Tony’s here because he can’t be at the motel anymore, hoping that the work will calm him down.
Hmph. Tony pouts, crossing his arms. Natasha smirks at him, and he glares at her. How dare she make fun of him? All he wants is Steve’s attention.
Steve thinks fondly—and he gapes. “No. Steve, you can’t be serious. Absolutely not. That’s going nowhere
“Good idea,” Steve praises, making Tony blush, which is… interesting. He sets that reaction aside to think about later. Today is just for his art, but Tony isn’t exactly ugly to look at it, exactly his type though Steve had been too caught up in his age earlier to notice, and if he’s as pretty tied up as Steve thinks he’ll be, well, it might be fun to revisit that contract at a later date.
not paying us at all.” He glanced at the clock above the studio’s door. “And we’ve still got two minutes to air. Ward’s still running his mouth about sports statistics, so calm down.”
doesn’t seem so impossible. It’s okay that it took him this long to figure out he’s attracted to men, cause it led him right here, to this moment.
And he hadn’t told Steve.
Tony points at the two cauldrons in use. “That one’s Liquid Luck, figured we could sell it, and that one’s Wolfsbane.”
He opened the door with a loud, “Honey, I’m home!” the way he’d heard on the show they watched a few nights ago.
He raises an eyebrow.
“I thought most of the team was going to sign. Honestly, I still think most of us would have if it hadn’t been for Zemo and the threat of the other supersoldiers. Wanda was really shaken by what happened in Lagos. I think it would have been easy to talk her into signing if she hadn’t tried to leave the Compound. Clint was retired anyway and he rarely thought through things like this. If he had, he probably wouldn’t have saved me.”
“Shuri said you wanted to talk?” Bucky asks as they’re walking back to the village.
That—that may well be true actually. Gracious knows Howard has never truly looked at his son unless it’s about something that Tony made or did for him. Anything else—like the boy’s truly excellent aim during his Little League games—flies right over Howard’s head.
go to other implications of that phrase. “I’m sure you’re just fine to—as a bedmate,” he says, stumbling over the words.
“Then I guess I’ll just have to distract you when we leave, won’t I?” Steve growls, bending down to give Tony a kiss. His phone chimes, distracting him. He tries to ignore it, but then it chimes again and then a third time.
“I can’t talk to you about this right now,” Tony says abruptly, standing. His chair screeches along the floor, making Steve wince. He leaves, one of the Dora Milaje following him at a glance from the king.
like that, not scrawny and sick Steve Rogers, although—
“Tony, I think the whole world saw that.” Uncle Grant pauses, then continues hesitantly, “Everything okay? I know it’s frustrating having to wait so long for your soulmate, but I’m worried about you. Out there all on your own…”
“The mutant you’ve been telling me about? What if he took Wanda in? You said he works with mutants of all ages at all level of ability. Wanda’s not exactly a mutant, but maybe he’d still be willing to train her. Or find someone who can,” he amends.
Surprised, Steve raised his head from his hands, staring blankly at Tony.
bed, even if it’s entirely platonic. Then he stands and starts to leave, only to stop when he’s less than halfway to the door when Tony quietly says, “Stay?”
“Help us understand. You worked with Dr. Stark on the amendments, yes? Why are you going back on them?”
Tony perked up. Steve did as well. Westview had never had a magic act in their talent show before. “You two can do magic tricks?”
“Yeah, I’ll get right on that,” Steve says awkwardly, glancing away from Tony who’s bright red.
“Then I was serious when I made it.” His voice lowered to a mutter that Steve suspected he wasn’t supposed to hear, “Just didn’t expect you to actually say yes.”
“This? Oh, it’s—it’s a flight stabilizer,” Tony says.
“But that Stone is in Vision’s head; there’s no easy way to extract it.”
“Tony, it’s
had been perfect. For the next three years, they had been inseparable. In their second year, Tony changed his major to mass communications, same as Steve. They moved out of the dorms before their third year and into a shoebox of an apartment that they could barely afford, both picking up extra shifts at the college radio station just to make rent. By the time they graduated, they’d both received offers at multiple radio stations across the country, but they’d agreed upon a local station that had accepted both of them. He’d thought they would be together forever, as cliché as that sounded.
He never forgets what his mama told him the last time she gave him a hug on move-in day right before she left. She’d leaned in close, eyeing his new roommate behind him. Rhodey knows what she’d seen; it’s the same thing he’d seen when he first met Tony a few hours earlier: a boy just barely into his teens looking a little lost and a little lonely because he’d had to move himself in since his father wouldn’t allow anyone to come with him.
Steve looks down at himself and realize that whatever they’ve been through has forever changed him. He can
“Got a mind for these things.” She passes the order off to the cook, whose name Steve still hasn’t caught, and then asks, “How’s your morning going so far?”
He groans and casts a quick enchantment on the spoon to keep itself stirring—he doesn’t normally like to use magic for simple things, but this could be an emergency—and lunges across the room to grab the phone in the last second before it stops ringing.
, really. Wideawake’s been shut down. Yes, we have the Accords to answer to, but we hold the reins. Isn’t that what we wanted all along?”
Steve. This is the best job I’ve ever had. I’m not going to give it up.”
Tony popped up so quickly he could have been a dandelion in another life. “Darling,
“It’s okay,” he says. “It wouldn’t have happened if I hadn’t told you about my suspicions about your parents’ murders. I swear, I didn’t know it was Bucky—I would have told you if I did—but I shouldn’t have let you find out that they were murdered the way you did.”
Steve was abruptly glad they didn’t know he’d been sleeping with Tony for the last three years. “I am,” he said. They exchanged one of those looks that married couples were infamous with, the ones that compressed a thousand words into a single glance. Steve sighed and insisted, “I
“So, I had a name but then Howard—my dad—”
“Oh?” Tony asked politely.
,” Steve stammers.
“Hey, Stevie, do you think me and Sam could have a minute here?” Bucky asks.
PLEASE READ - just as a quick note before you go any further, there's a part that could be taken as very mildly dubious consent: Janet is part-succubus and inadvertently uses her powers on Steve when they first meet. Nothing physical happens and all Steve does is seem more interested in her than he normally would be, so I've chosen not to tag for that, but I just wanted to give you all a warning for anyone who might be uncomfortable (and if you feel like it's something that I should tag, please let me know in the comments)
Steve nodded. “I was just thinking about her this weekend, not sure why, and wondering how her relationship was going. You know, if she was still with her husband or if he dumped her.”
He hates it when Tony looks like that, when he looks like he’s got the weight of the world on his shoulders. It wasn’t Tony’s fault Rhodey crashed. If anything, it was Steve’s for running.
Caller: No!
“Okay,” Tony said eventually. “We really need to talk about this now. That was too specific to just be a rumor.”
“But then I’ll have two.”
“No, I’d love to,” Steve urges, sounding way too desperate, and then blushes. “I mean, I want to.”
“No,” Tony said, shaking his head. “We both had some unusual dreams, but no noises.”
“Hey,” he says again, softer this time.
“Yeah?”
“And we never have to do this again.”
Luis shrugs. “Suit yourself.”
and wasn’t just a hasty explanation.
Tony was the one who eventually managed to extract them, saying, “Betty, it’s really been a delight talking to you, but Steve’s running late to pick up his friends from the airport. He’s just too polite to say so.”
“You’re from an
“Wanda’s not going to go back somewhere she’s just going to be locked up again,” Sam points out.
“True, but this time I really mean it,” Tony said.
“I wanted to talk about the Accords,” Steve says, instead of waiting for Tony to say something. He has a feeling they would have been waiting a while.
“Yeah,” Tony says with a small laugh.
Pepper’s irritated about the back-and-forth between Malibu and New York, but at least she’s not getting fiery about it now that Extremis is stabilized. Once he’d settled into the Tower, Tony had spent more than a few weeks working on that. Anyway, it’s been almost a month since the mansion fell into the ocean, and this is the first chance Tony has gotten to fish his bots out of the ruins.
idea what I went through after you left? How heartbroken I was? And now you want to get back together like nothing ever happened?”
“Yeah, I like him too,” Tony agrees. He grins and climbs to his feet. There’s a few feet between his bed and Rhodey’s, plenty of space to pull DUM-E up and avoid his own feet if he’s careful. He braces himself on his bed and hauls the bot up, using all his strength to pull DUM-E off the bed. He’s only had DUM-E for a few weeks, but he can already tell that the bot is going to end up giving him some impressive arm strength if he keeps tripping over things.
Tony shrugs uncomfortably. “I know he didn’t mean to do… what he did. And I’m sure Wakanda has thoughts on how to help him. So, you know…”
“That can’t possibly taste good,” Tony says breathily.
He’s not expecting it when Steve suddenly rips his cowl off, but he can’t find it in him to be upset, not when he can see every inch of Steve’s beautiful face, not when Steve is smiling shyly at him and muttering that he wants Tony to see him, just as he can see Tony.
and she isn’t there to help him, and—
Tony smiled at him. “Well. I guess you could get started on your debt now.”
Tony shrugged. “I did, but you know me, I fall a little in love with everyone I bring home. I’ll get over it. At least this way, I can get dicked down while I’m getting over them.”
She pats the bed encouragingly and smiles at him. Tony’s face brightens, and he scrambles across the room, leaving the door open in his haste. No matter, she can always close it again once Tony’s fallen asleep.
He thinks about his secret meetings with Tony and how they were able to rationally discuss the Accords during their last one. She’s half-right at least. He’s not ready to sign yet, but a few more conversations with Tony and he might be. He thinks he might do just about anything to be able to go home and have Tony smile at him the way he used to.
Tony hummed. “It’s just such a shame that you were too busy to pay attention to me the way you should have.”
The next message is an address, one that Steve recognizes from one of the team bonding exercises he’d held back when he, Nat, and Clint had left the remnants of SHIELD for the Avengers. It’s one of Tony’s houses, the one in Sweden, originally built by Howard to be off the grid so that the Stark family could escape the press. According to Tony, only he and Maria had used it, Howard too caught up in his own brilliance to want to get away for a few weeks.
For TSB square K2: Fabrication
on the other hand…
to see Tony again.
, but unlike his usual bullshit, this got a lot more specific than the average rumor.
About an hour after the apothecary opens, the front bell chimes, announcing Howard and Maria Stark’s arrival. Tony is busy helping Thor and his wife with a product and doesn’t even notice them arrive, but Steve does. He has a free moment from ringing people up, so he whips out his phone to take a quick picture of their astonished faces so he can show Tony after they close.
“What if he comes in with a purple… thing?”
Steve grinned at him. “You just want to watch that for Sarah Jessica Parker.”
“Yeah, Tony, we were.”
“And then we’re no worse off than where we started,” Tony agrees. He looks over at Sam. “Would that be enough for you?”
And that—that sounds pretty damn nice actually. “Okay,” he says, kicks off his own shoes, and climbs into the other side of the bed. Tony rolls over to face him, gives him another small smile, and closes his eyes. Within minutes, he’s asleep, soft breaths puffing out from his slightly open mouth
“Sorry for the misunderstanding,” he says, handing the ID back to Tony. “I’m really stressed about this project. It’s been impossible to find a decent model.”
were the one who said we should break up.”
So yeah, Steve had incontrovertible proof that Tony wasn’t interested in getting back together. Bucky was wrong.
Steve and Tony shared a look, then, as one, opened their mouths to talk.
Before either Steve or Betty could respond, the intercom in the studio came on with a loud screech, making all three of them wince. “You’re late is what you are,” Rumlow snapped from the broadcasting studio. Steve bit back a groan. He didn’t like to say that he hated working with any of the sound technicians, considering they were the ones who made sure they made it to broadcast, but he hated working with Rumlow, who was arrogant and easily irritated. “Are we paying you to talk or to work?”
Sam is quiet for a moment, his face unreadable. Eventually, he says, “Yeah, you should have said something. I figured you were talking to
“I’m sorry, was that English?” Tony teased.
There was still a strange look on Tony’s face. Steve couldn’t read it. Tony had changed a lot in the ten years they hadn’t seen each other and even though they’d been working together for longer than they’d been in a relationship, he’d worked so hard on maintaining the boundaries he’d set that he didn’t know what was going through Tony’s head.
Tony doesn’t even have to think about it before he says, “Yeah, I am.”
Steve repeats.
By the time Steve makes it back across the street to the office, he has almost fifteen missed calls from Tony. He has great intentions of calling him back just as soon as he sits down and eats something but then Luis has another client for him and then he’s got a phone conference with another business licenser in Elmdale and then it’s already late afternoon.
“Well, what about Sam and Wanda?”
At that, DUM-E whirrs excitedly, his lone strut spinning uselessly in the air.
“Yes, I’m sure,” Tony says impatiently, even as he shivers, hips twitching as the ice melts. “Get that gorgeous cock of yours out of your pants and come on my stomach.”
Steve chuckled. “Knowing her and Vision, they’d probably figure out a way to turn it into a cute couple’s costume for
“Yeah, but heaven forbid Captain America be gay. Anyway, you haven’t left this place since Thanos died. I don’t think you can keep saying you’re from Brooklyn when you live in the middle of nowhere.”
“Hey, about—” he started, right as Tony blurted out, “I wanted—”
“You make a decision about—”
fingers were sure and swift. Tony had a brief thought about what else Steve could do with those fingers—starting with
Tony hated that look on his face. He got up and moved around the couch, taking Steve into his arms. “Stop worrying about it, darling,” he said, stretching up to give Steve a quick kiss. “Geraldine is fine. Agnes was probably just jealous that Wanda’s been spending so much time with Geraldine so she made up some silly rumor. You’ll see, it’ll be gone by tomorrow.”
“Tony did all this?” Maria Stark asks, voice just loud enough to be heard over the bustling crowd.
“They know that supervillains won’t necessarily play to their tune, right?”
He’s not sure what possessed him to sign up for Dr. Carter’s Erotica in Art class—Clint’s nonstop teasing, maybe, that Steve’s art, while good, is too wholesome—but he had and now he’s coming up on his final project and he hasn’t been able to find a model because apparently, all the models in the department have
“I’m not—” He stops, wondering why the thought of Tony assuming that someone is there for his sister and not him makes him sad. Objectively, of course, it is sad, but there’s no reason it should make him want to bundle Tony up in a blanket and feed him chocolate chip cookies until he feels better. “I’m not here for your sister.”
He pulls into the parking lot next to the motel and puts the car in park, suddenly hesitating. He’s never felt this nervous on a date before. Does he say something about it being a date? Does he lean over and kiss him? He wants to. He
“I can’t leave my team,” he says again. It’s different when it’s him. He’s the team leader. He knows that they’re all more than capable of taking care of themselves, but he shouldn’t just abandon them because he’s in l—because he’s lonely and wants to go home.
Before he can think better of it, Steve nods, then adds, “Yeah, okay. Of course.”
Steve had been ignoring him up to that point, just as he’d been ignoring all of Bucky’s lectures about his relationship with Tony for the last two days, but at the idea that he didn’t know what he was doing, he turned and hissed, “I
Tony’s smile is sad as he says, “You.”
As soon as he gets in, he sits down at his desk and pulls up the files on business grants. He’s been thinking about all that product Tony has that he needs to sell and how Tony is actively losing money every time his sister uses one of his products. There has to be a way for Tony to get more startup money, he knows it.
“I’m warning you, Jarvis, you’re not gonna like to be the answering machine of the Avenger’s phone line.”
It took Tony some seconds to recognize the room where they were in, and Tony blinked at him in confusion as if he still didn’t understand what they were doing there nor what gift Steve was talking about. Steve stepped aside so Tony had a clear sight of the room, and he couldn’t help feeling a little uneasy when Tony’s expression turned blank at the realization of the new acquisitions Steve had gotten for the playroom. Slowly, Tony got closer to the crib, and placed a hand on one of the sides as he took a careful look at all the room.
Steve crossed the living room in a few strides, and he got a bad feeling when he couldn’t spot Clint as soon as he stepped into the kitchen. Had Clint gone away? Where? He wasn’t supposed to leave the room by himself when he was little without the permission of Phil or him. Unfortunately, little Clint wasn’t very good at following rules, so Steve wouldn’t be surprised at all if he had indeed left.
“I… I just… decided it… without… without any reason.”
The bed and the crib might be parallel in some ways, though the most evident dissimilarity was the thing that was causing all this turmoil inside Tony’s head. The sides surrounding the crib, instead of triggering some sort of claustrophobia or feeling of confinement as logic dictated, caused an unusual sense of protection and coziness that Tony couldn’t understand. Somehow, his mind had linked that unique characteristic of the crib to the fact that that night, where he ended up there accidentally, Tony had slept better than he had in a long time; he had woken up well-rested, calm – or as calm as it had been possible taking into account the hangover and the initial consternation, which were inevitable giving the circumstances – and, best of all, without having experienced nightmares.

Thanks for your comments and kudos!
No, Steve wasn't going to take action. He couldn't. If it turned out Tony had changed his mind, Steve would have to wait until he said so himself.
After taking a deep and steadying breath, Tony crept into the living room and made a beeline for the couch, feeling extremely relieved for having reached it without tripping over. He’d been able to feel Steve’s gaze on him every step of the way, and even though that would’ve made Tony swagger a little bit in other circumstances, right now it was just making him more anxious than he already was.
And why was that? After a lot of thinking, Tony had come to the conclusion that it was his own fault. Steve was doing a terrific job as a daddy, and even it was obvious he wasn't afraid of pushing things a little, Tony was afraid they would never move forward if he didn't learn to let go, if he let Steve do everything and he didn't do his bit.
It would be hard for Tony to get over the Captain-America-had-already-known-about-this-dirty-little-secret fact. His mind would be totally focus on that, preventing him from coming up with an excuse to get out of the second talk Steve will surely want to have with him. Tony had been told to go and look for him whenever he was ready – whatever that meant – and he obviously wouldn’t do it, so that would make Steve come and look for him instead, and Tony wanted to be ready for that. Still, he didn’t hide or tried to avoid Steve this time, that would have reduced the time it would take Steve to bring the topic up again, and Tony needed that time. Although that didn’t mean he was trying to spend time with Steve either. If there was no reason for them to be in the same room at the same time, Tony didn’t think twice about leaving. But if it was something that had to do with a total different matter, Tony manned up and dealt with it.
Saw any mistakes? Please let me know :)
“Have you ever wondered why all the pop-up ads seem to show you just things that you could really be interested in?” Tony questioned, head still lowered, but his eyes finally looking up at him.
Or, had that particular characteristic of Tony had something to do with his sudden decision? Perhaps it had. Maybe all the attention and love Steve tried to give Tony every time they age played had sparked off that habit of his of rejecting everything that was good for him. Instead of soaking all that affection like a sponge – as he definitely should – Tony might be running away from it. That certainly sounded like something he would do.
“No, I’m not. I’m
For that reason, Steve hadn’t wanted to go down to look for Clint’s pull-ups, Tony would have never agreed to stay put while he rode the elevator to Phil’s floor, and taking Tony out of their floor while he was in his little headspace wasn’t an option either. If Tony got all jumpy and uneasy when they were in their living room, Steve didn’t want to imagine what going anywhere else in the tower would do to Tony’s nerves.
- - - -
The room was a mess. Yes,
“Clint’s bigger, you can do more things with him than with me. I’m boring,” Tony kept muttering.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Just for a while, champ. I’ll have JARVIS order some pull-ups.”
“Well, it’s your choice kiddo, no mac and cheese, no cookies.” Phil gave him an ultimatum before eating a couple of bites of his own lunch.
A shame his brain wasn’t good at letting things go just like that. So, Tony wasn’t really the one to be blamed for what he found himself doing days later, his fixation was. And he couldn’t really control it.
“Alright, alright, I’m going,” Tony grumbled as he stepped back into the elevator, this time staying there long enough for the doors to close.
“No, daddy!” Tony blurted out, retracting more.
"I don't recall you asking me anything," Steve assured, trying to get rid of Tony's grip.
Tony shook his head as if that would help him to get rid of those thoughts. He was giving this matter a lot of thought, which only stressed him and that was exactly what he had promised Steve he wouldn’t do. Besides, even if Steve wouldn’t hesitate to go all out for him, he was also the kind of guy who liked to keep things simple, so he might not have done any of the extravagant things Tony was imagining him doing. Steve might have as well planned something more mundane like watching a movie together, so Tony was getting all distressed for nothing.
"So, all your gestures and coddles weren't a way to make me get interested in this Age Play thing?" Tony asked, glaring at him.
Without being able to say how or when it had happened, Steve knew Tony had made that transition, he had passed from pretending to be little to genuinely be one.
“Are you working on a watch?” Steve asked from where he was suddenly standing over him, startling Tony into falling out of the chair. When the hell had Steve arrived?
“I-I got wo-work to do.” Yeah, that was the lamest excuse Tony could think of.
____________
"Well, kind of, but–"
Hum, not such a big reaction from Clint. I guess I wanted to show he already reached a point where he's comfortable with his little side, he's not struggling with any of this anymore.
“No,” Tony hurried to deny. Steve refrained himself from telling him he knew that was a lie.
“Are you really rejecting me?” Tony asked, moving his head away a little to be able to see Steve’s face.
“I would have told you,” Steve says again. He has to believe it’s true, has to believe that he would have done the right thing if he’d known the full truth and said something, that he isn’t the ass who kept this quiet to benefit himself.
Tony sighs and tilts his head back, staring at the ceiling for a long moment. “Come on,” he says eventually. “These chairs aren’t the most comfortable. And I think I’m going to want something to drink if we’re going to talk about this now.”
“Hey, Shellhead,” Uncle Grant says warmly, and Tony smiles. He’s never figured out why Uncle Grant calls him that, but he likes it. “How’s the search going?”
Steve winces. “Point taken,” he says. “And that’s a really long headline.”
“It’s not the middle of nowhere, it’s upstate New York. And it doesn’t work like that. I’m still from Brooklyn, no matter where I live currently. And, for your information, I go into town all the time.” Admittedly, the last time had been a month ago, but still.
“Are you sure it’ll be okay?”
“This is slow,” he whines to Rhodey over the phone. Rhodey’s too nice to sigh, but not nice enough to stop himself from pointing out that Tony could just wait instead. “I don’t want to wait. I want to know where they are.”
Uncle Grant scoffs. “With all the fun you’re having in Monte Carlo?”
“Don’t worry, I’ll get another one shipped in for your birthday.”
Steve ignores the reluctant tone in his voice and asks, “Any fun plans for today?”
“I found you,” he whispers, reaching out to run his thumb over his name on Steve’s wrist. Under his light touch, he can feel Steve shiver. He wants to know what else makes Steve shiver, what makes him moan, what pretty sounds he can draw out of his mouth. Underneath his fingers, Steve flips his hand over to thread his fingers through Tony’s, drawing his hand up to his mouth for a soft, chaste kiss. “
“I’m Steve,” he says cheerfully.
“Or cheating on them,” Steve finished.
“Hmm? Oh, sure. You look like you have a clean mouth,” Tony mutters distractedly, more focused on setting the store back to rights than he is on Steve.
“Yes,” Tony agrees, because it’s true and he knows it.
“So what’s different about my sparkly rock and your sparkly rock?”
He does know a few things about Tony, not much and all of it could be a lie, but he knows that Tony attends MIT and that he’s working on his second PhD, so he’s expecting, when his doorbell buzzes, that Tony will be a few years older than Steve, who’s working on a PhD of his own, though it’s only his first. He’s not expecting, when he opens the door, the—the
Before he can steel himself, the door swings open and Tony leans up against the doorjamb. “You gonna stand out there all night?” Tony asks him. “Don’t get me wrong, you’re more than welcome to but the forecast is calling for a storm tonight. Wouldn’t want you to freeze to death. Again.”
Steve turns the phone over in his hands. Tony hasn’t texted him since they saw each other in Wakanda. Steve has reached out a few times, but never received an answer. “I want to sign,” he says, surprising himself. He hadn’t realized he’d finally reached that stage of wanting to sign the Accords. He’d thought he was still deliberating with himself.
live under a rock—he doesn’t have the money for a StarkPhone or one of those fancy drawing tablets they released last year—but even he knows about MIT’s golden boy. Kinda hard not to hear about him when they both live in Boston.
Steve took a lot longer to get back than he was expecting, a couple of hours at least. By that time, Tony had decided the rain wasn’t coming back so he’d uncovered everything, wiped it all down, called the insurance company,
“You didn’t want to be. You kept complaining.”
It wasn’t enough, but it was all Steve could stand.
“I bet you did,” Tony replied. His husband would have been a Boy Scout if not for the fact that he kept picking fights with the bullies at school.
“What?”
pretty.
“Maybe,” Tony agreed doubtfully. Didn’t television programs run at night? But just as he thought it, he blinked.
if he wanted to. “I just want to find them
The thing was, Steve didn’t know why it so upset him that Tony had made that joke about finding a different show. He liked Tony, and they had a great show together, but it wasn’t like he hadn’t had partners in the past that he liked just as much as working with Tony. It wasn’t like he wasn’t getting tired of Pierce and Rumlow’s bullshit. It wasn’t like he couldn’t easily find another job—he’d gotten several offers while he’d been employed at Hydra. But that sort of visceral reaction to hearing that Tony was thinking about leaving, even if he wasn’t serious about it…
Steve slung his arm around Tony’s shoulders, pulling him close. He pressed a loud, smacking kiss to the side of Tony’s head. “Yeah, you are.”
Caller: Yeah, that pretty much sums it up.
Tony tilted his head up to eye him dubiously. “Is there a time for it to be too early to start thinking about Christmas?”
Later, Tony would rationalize it as the indoor sprinklers turning on—not that they
The ending is worse than he’d expected.
“Then we should skip it.”
Tony was already waiting in the production studio with their interviewee, Betty Ross, more commonly known as Dear Elizabeth. He looked up when Steve entered the studio, offering him a tight smile that felt in line with how Tony had been acting that morning. Clearly he wasn’t over whatever had him acting odd earlier. Maybe he wasn’t feeling well. Steve felt a brief urge to see if Tony would let him bring over some soup—Tony had always liked his Ma’s chicken soup recipe—but brushed it aside as quickly as it appeared. They weren’t like that anymore, and besides, he’d told himself he wasn’t going to get further entangled with Tony than he already was. That was the ground rule he’d set for himself when they’d started sleeping together. No feelings, no entanglements, that was the best way to avoid setting himself up for getting hurt again.
he exclaims.
“The way we run it,” Tony stated, eyes narrowing. “We don’t run it any differently than any other relationship show out there.”
And somehow, they never quite untangled themselves after that.
“Natasha.”
“No,” Steve protests, “I wasn’t trying to—”
And he knows that the UN isn’t like SHIELD, isn’t a single government easily capable of corruption—capable, yes, but it’s harder, he thinks, when there are so many more countries to keep track of. But in the heat of the moment, with SHIELD on his mind and then Peggy’s text distracting him, he had only been able to refuse to sign. He remembers Nat at the funeral, how they’d still been able to be cordial despite being on opposing sides of the Accords, and he wonders if it could have been like that with Tony, if they could have entirely avoided a fight if it hadn’t been for Bucky. By the time he got to the airport, he hadn’t even been fighting about the Accords, it had all been about getting to those supersoldiers, though now, looking back on it, he wonders if Tony had thought that Steve had been willing to go to blows over the Accords. He thinks, if he’d been in Tony’s shoes, that might have been exactly what he thought, and he sees suddenly where everything had gone so wrong—when he had let Sam talk him into keeping things from Tony, when he had let Tony think the fight at the airport was about the Accords instead of the supersoldiers.
just so he didn’t have to live with Tony.
“Really? I don’t remember hearing a please in there.”
He turned back around and nestled closer to Tony, sighing contentedly. It was a Saturday, he and Tony had nothing to do today; if they wanted to just laze around in bed, then they were more than welcome to. And honestly, that sounded just like what Steve wanted to do. He closed his eyes and drifted back to sleep.
“We’re not—”
“Yeah,” he said heavily. “Sorry, must have imagined it.”
“Yep,” Steve crosses to the closet and pulls out the ropes he’d specially ordered for this session. He has another set that he uses when he’s Domming, but for this—for his art—he’d wanted something special. He eyes Tony critically and sets aside the blue ropes. They’re pretty, and would probably look great with Tony’s skin color, but not flashy enough, he thinks. The red, though, and the sparkly gold, those will do perfectly.
“Well, loose lips sink ships,” Steve quotes.
Five minutes later, when he still can’t sleep for the heat, he finally adds, “Fine, but we’re leaving tomorrow. And you have to promise never to break our A/C again.”
So yes, he knows perfectly well that at the hottest point of the summer, Tony will deliberately break the A/C in the penthouse (and he knows it’s being done deliberately because the rest of Stark Tower is just fine) so that Steve will have to wander around their apartment without a shirt on for a few days while Tony pretends that he doesn’t know how to fix the A/C. He could get a hotel room, but honestly, Tony’s shenanigans are adorable, and anyway, the trade-off is that
“Is it a tease if I still intend on following through?”
“Magical?” Wanda suddenly asked, a worried expression crossing her face. She’d been pacing for the last twenty minutes, wondering aloud about where Vision could be. Truthfully, Steve was wondering that too; the neighborhood watch meeting had ended over an hour ago, most of the men now helping Dottie set up for the talent show, but Vision was nowhere to be seen. He gave her a reassuring smile before quickly averting his eyes, not wanting to come across as lecherous. He only had eyes for Tony, of course, but Wanda looked very lovely—and slightly inappropriate for a fundraiser for the children—in a glittery leotard and he didn’t want to be cause any problems by looking too long at her when he didn’t know how Vision would react.
“Oh please, I’m not nearly as bad as you,” Tony said, apparently missing Steve’s slip. Well, if Tony didn’t think it was that big of a deal, then Steve wasn’t going to worry about it either. “I keep thinking one of these days, you’ll bring home a puppy.”
Tony laughs, bright and beautiful, and leans over to rest his head on Steve’s shoulder. Steve smiles and lays his head on top of Tony’s. It’s nice, sitting like this, even though he has to remind himself that this is all he can ask for. This is enough; Tony’s friendship is enough.
Their cab driver was looking between the two of them like it was a tennis match and Steve wanted to snap at him to mind his own business. But that would be rude and his ma had raised him better than that, so he kept his mouth shut. He’d pay him a higher tip than he normally would when they got to the airport to convince him not to say anything about this conversation on Twitter.
And that’s… a problem.
“You’re not—we—I thought we should do this as a team,” Steve says, looking at Sam for confirmation.
Vision looked between the two of them, clearly not in on the joke, but before Steve could clue him in, he thanked them again and left. Tony just shrugged and continued on with the grocery shopping, but Steve looked after him a moment longer. Strange noises, huh? Well, he hadn’t heard any yet, but he’d keep an ear out.
Definitely not his morning.
“Nuh-huh. You’re gonna have to sit up.”
Steve cringed just thinking about it, but short of asking Pierce—who notoriously did not like to be questioned—he couldn’t see a better option. He didn’t want to be left wrong-footed if it
“Then we’ll offer a refund and laugh once he leaves.” Tony grabs the mister for the sun orchids in the front window and then pauses. “Here’s an entirely hypothetical question for you that you shouldn’t read too much into: has your family ever forgotten your birthday?” There’s a very subtle emphasis on the way he says “your family” that makes Steve think his instinct was correct: it’s Tony’s birthday and his family forgot.
him. Steve’s breath catches, and a gorgeous smile spreads across his face. Tony wants to kiss that smile off, wants to know what it tastes like. Does it taste like sunshine? He bets it does.
Steve nods understandingly. “Me too.”
only friend too.”
—both because of what Steve can help him with and because of what the serum means for scientific advancement, though Steve hasn’t let Bruce or Yinsen take any of his blood yet.
precious, isn’t he?”
They both stopped.
Steve: Is your marriage really so unstable that the rumors a jealous coworker is spreading are enough to destabilize it entirely? Cause what I’m hearing here is that you’ve just decided that your marriage is as good as over, and maybe it is, and maybe that’s a good thing because if that is what you feel, then clearly your marriage wasn’t in the best place anyway.
Steve looks at him sharply. “As in—”
, maybe?”
Tony scowls. “I’m only seven. I can’t take over the company until I’m at least eighteen.”
And the plot thickens! Please remember to check the updated tags for anyone who might have a problem with outside homophobia.
So, he forwards the copies of the Accords to Clint and Scott, telling them that the copies came from T’Challa because he knows that none of them will ever forgive him if they find out he’s been talking to Tony without telling anyone, even though he knows Tony wouldn’t use their talks to track them all down and arrest them. It’s probably fine; he’s sure the king already knows to expect Clint and Scott’s signatures and will probably know to go along with whatever story Steve gives them, and then he sits down in his room with his own copy.
Tony grins at the phone. Rapidly approaching his forties and still treated like a—what had Uncle Grant called him that one time? Oh, right—a young whippersnapper by his uncle. “I miss you guys.”
Soon, Tony was cracking up under Steve’s hands, who knew all the most ticklish places in his body. Steve asked Tony a few times if he was ready to give in and get ready for bed, but his stubborn partner shook his head effusively as he tried to get away from him, ineffectively. It was until Steve lifted Tony’s t-shirt and pressed his mouth against his belly, blowing raspberries, that Tony couldn’t take it anymore.
"The fuck! Are you even listening to me?!" Tony accused as he threw his arms to the air in frustration.
“No! Let me go!” Tony demanded, but Steve had already walked toward the rocking chair and sat down on it, placing Tony on his lap before he could hold onto something to stop Steve. “Let me go, you asshole! How the hell did you find out this room? Why the hell did you this?! How dared you! Let me go this instant!” he kept demanding, trying to loosen Steve’s grip, but he wasn’t strong enough to achieve it.
“No, it can’t. I gotta finish this today.”
Even if it didn’t happen very often, whenever Steve had needed to babysit Clint, he had noticed that Tony fell into his little headspace almost immediately in his presence. But that was not the problem, Steve didn’t deny it was a bit complicated to look after two littles at the same time, though it wasn’t something he dreaded doing either. The problem was that little Tony seemed to truly dislike little Clint – and only little Clint, because the playful relationship they had when they were in their adult mindsets was still intact.
The mere thought of that happening was horrifying. If Daddy left, the Avengers would be the only thing that could keep him afloat. Tony didn’t know what he’d do if that happened, and knowing all that had occurred because of him made things even worse.
No more feeding, no more bathing, no more reading a story to bed, nothing that could be considered childish in the slightest. Nothing that could give an indication that Steve was still trying to get him into age playing. Not even the topic had been brought up. Steve had respected Tony’s decision of not wanting to give it a try, and Tony was more than fine with that.
Indeed, it had been too soon to claim victory.
Nonetheless, Tony would never say it’d been Steve’s fault, or that they both shared the blame, because the one who was stuck in medical right now was Steve and not him.
"But right now I'm ordering you something else, and my suits are not anyone!" Tony fumed, how come nothing work out the way he wanted lately? Had he broken a mirror and he hadn’t even noticed about it or what?
“Yeah?” Steve expressed, not knowing what else to say as he didn’t know where this conversation was going.
"Why have you been acting weird?" Tony questioned, hand firm.
Steve breathed another quiet sigh, mentally trying to cheer himself up. You had to hit rock bottom before you can bounce back up, right? He had to be optimistic and see the bright sight in all the tribulations they’d been through, after all, they’d provided him with a clearer idea of what Tony truly wanted.
"What up?" Tony heard Steve slurring, finally picking up the phone. Tony kept his ears open so he could hear who was on the other end of the line, and the silence that reigned in the room let him make out Phil’s voice. "Yes, yes, no. I’m awake now. It's OK, don't worry, I really don’t mind, I'll check on him," Steve finished saying, his speech getting clearer.
“Tony, buddy, why don’t you come out of there?” Phil suggested, peeking under the bed where Tony had hidden. He had reached the door just in time to prevent Tony from locking it, but he hadn’t been able to stop him from crawling under the bed. “It was just an accident, you don’t have to worry about it. It happens,” he consoled, stretching his arm so he could caress Tony’s leg, but that only make him curl in tighter.
“And you will let me skip SHIELD’s stupid checkup.”
"Are you sure?" Steve asked, raising an eyebrow.
That was where Tony found them a couple of hours later, and it stung Steve that he didn’t react at the scene in front of him. No anger, no jealousy, no confusion, no longing, Steve could literally not detect any sort of emotion on his face or movements. Tony just greeted him, asked what Clint was doing there, nodded in understanding when Steve explained him what had happened, and made a beeline to their bedroom. That had been it. That was the attitude Tony had adopted lately, as if age play was the most normal thing in the world but it had nothing to do with him, as if it had never had to do anything with him.
It was a fact that Tony didn’t want the captain to leave him, but if he decided to do it, Tony at least hoped it didn’t happen right now. Right now he just wanted Steve to come and help him, because the lack of air was making him dizzy, and he had broken out into cold sweat, and holding his teddy’s arm wasn’t helping at all, and he thought he would pass out, and he was literally freaking out, and the only person who was capable of helping him in this kind of situation was Steve, but Steve was going to kick him out of his life right now, and he didn’t know what was going to happen then, and he didn’t know why he always had to screw thing up, and…
“Oh, so you know the difference. Now, tell me why you seem to need them, ‘cause this is exactly what I need now, a son who can’t even control his bladder!” he said, as he threw the package against the wall.
A hand on his shoulder made him jump for the second time that day. Apparently, he had dozen off again while trying to figure out how to get out of there. Was he really that exhausted? Falling asleep like that wasn’t that common in him even if he hadn’t closed his eyes for more than twenty minutes in a week.
“How many times do I have to tell you I’m not fucking hungry?! The serum really messed up with your mind, you retard, because you just don’t get it!” And now he was digging his nails into Steve's arm, seriously?
That was the problem. Tony had no idea what he wanted to do exactly. He didn’t even know what age he would pretend to be. A kid didn’t seem like the right fit for him, though he felt a bit uneasy when he imagined himself as a baby. Perhaps a toddler like Clint?
"JARVIS, do you know where my tablet is?" Tony asked after having checked, and not found it, on the places Steve usually placed it.
“Captain Roger’s schedule is clear for the day, Sir,” JARVIS notified matter-of-factly, making Tony glare up at the roof. The A.I. had been informing him about Steve’s activities and whereabouts all day, and it was starting to get annoying.
“What is it, sweetheart? Didn’t you want juice?” Steve asked, confused. Tony shook his head and pushed the bottle away.
There was a long pause before Phil answered, the kind of pause that told Steve Phil was trying to find the right words, “look, I get why you do it, okay? I know you’re having a hard time right now and you’re not doing it intentionally, but Clint doesn’t really like being babied, and he’s complained a few times because he says you do that a lot lately.”
Wearing diapers had not been discussed, Tony had never agreed to wear diapers. Yes, there was the fact that they hadn’t actually discussed anything, when Steve had asked Tony about what he wanted to do or not to do he had been clueless. Thus, Steve wasn’t really overstepping any boundaries. There weren’t any. It had been decided that they would try different things until they found something they both liked and enjoyed, and if there was something Tony dislike, he was more than free to use the agreed safeword.
“Promise,” Phil assured, turning Clint around so he could sit down on his leg. He reached for Clint’s bowl and held it in front of them so Clint could grab the fork, as being fed was something he considered too childish. Hesitantly, Clint ate some of the pasta, and judging by his expression, Phil knew he didn’t dislike the taste of it. “We can watch some TV after you finish,” he suggested, deciding not to make a big deal of what just had happened.
"OK," Tony agreed, surprised of how tiny his voiced had sounded.
No, Tony needed to put an end to this. That nursery had showed him Steve was willing to go further into a territory Tony didn’t want to risk stepping in. If he let this continue, going down into that headspace could stop being something he did at will; his little self could get more attached to Steve – and vice versa – and the separation would be worse. Tony couldn’t allow his reasoning be blinded by how good and fulfilling it was when he was Little and Steve was around.
Steve would have liked to stand up immediately and get them both ready to bed, but when he tried to move, Tony groaned. So, he just stayed there for a little while, enjoying the moment, cooing him and rubbing his back waiting for him to stop calm down. Steve was sure Tony would throw another tantrum when he saw the diaper and bottle he would pull out from the drawers, but this would be more like a fuss than a tantrum, much easier to deal with. And it would totally be worthy when he placed him on his lap one more time and Tony fell asleep after being feed with some warm milk.
“Yeah, because you never start another project before you finish the one you were working on first,” Steve remarked, not amused. It had taken him quite a while to realize that Tony’s ‘I’ll be there as soon as I finish with this’ promise was just another way to dodge Steve’s attempts to take him out of his workshop.
By the time Tony finished reading the last one, he was too tired and too hungry to go back to his workshop. So, he opted to rest for a while and have something to eat before resuming work. Steve would arrive soon and he would surely bring some food with him.
“Oh, sorry,” Steve apologized, loosening his grip. “Are we OK?” he asked after several minutes, placing his hands on Tony’s upper arms and pushing him slightly away from him, wanting to see his face.
“So, when the RC car, that
"I don't want to."
“Sit down,” Howard had ordered, and Tony walked to the chair in front of him, sitting down unsteadily. “What’s the meaning of this?” he asked, straight to the point.
"Because you deserve it," Steve felt a stinging sensation in his chest when he saw Tony's disbelief expression. He squatted in front of Tony, placing his hands on Tony’s arms, leaning a little to be right in front of Tony, forcing him to look directly at his eyes. "People may say a lot of bad things about you, you may think a lot of bad things about yourself, and I regret it now, but at the beginning I thought those bad things were truth. Now I'm completely sure they're not. You're such a great person Tony, behind that façade you insist to hide yourself, there's a man who's always more concerned about the others than his own self. You always try to give us whatever we need, want and desire, no matter how difficult, expensive or dumb it is. But when it's about getting what you need and want, you refrained yourself? That's just not fair."
“Daddyyyy,” Tony whined.
Steve sighed. "Clint, even if it was bigger, which it’s not, why would it matter? If you're still hungry when you finish that slice, I'll give you another one,” he reasoned, voice a bit tense. He held up the fork in front of Tony’s mouth, waiting for him to finish chewing the last bite.
After a few more minutes of silence, Tony spoke in a tiny voice. “You’re gonna leave, and… and I… I won’t have a daddy anymore.”
“That’s not true. I love spending time with you, it’s fun,” Steve assured.
“I’m sorry honey, but daddy doesn’t want you to get all cranky because you’re not able to fall asleep tonight.”
“Yes, you are,” Phil stated with a warning tone of voice. “Clint, I told you to stop that,” he ordered firmly when he heard Clint continued kicking the books. "Tony, I need you to tell me, does something hurt?"
“You–,” Tony trailed off.
“Rocky? Really? I thought you’d already watched it,” Tony commented as nonchalantly as he could manage, making a mental note to include the movie theme song in Steve’s playlist before the next time he went running.
“Where are you going? I said dinner was ready!”
“Hey, hey, hey, what do you think you’re doing?” Steve asked Tony when he was halfway through sitting at the table.
In less than a few minutes, Steve was already lifting Tony’s hips to slide the diaper under his butt and pulling it up to smooth the straps into place after a quick dusting of baby powder between his thighs. He smiled at the pattern of the diaper, baby dinosaurs, and wonder which of them would disappear once Tony made use of it.
Hesitantly, Tony opened his mouth. He was already wearing a diaper, so drinking from a bottle wasn’t any better or worse. Shortly, a silicone teat settled on his tongue, but Tony didn’t suck until Steve gave him an encouraging squish. His taste buds detected delicious strawberry flavored milk, unconsciously making him continue sucking and swallowing. Some milk spilled down his chin at first when he sucked harder than necessary, but soon he got the hang of it. Tony didn’t know whether to feel proud or mortify about that.
“It is! It can be very relaxing, Phil and Clint do it and it seems to work for them, it seems to really help Clint deal with bad days,” he spilled out before he could stop himself, even covering his mouth with both hands, but it was already too late. That information wasn’t something he should shout to the four winds, Clint might have said he wouldn’t mind if someone found out about it, but he had said he’d rather they didn’t. How could he screw more things up when the thing he wanted to do was fix this misunderstanding?
“So, are we good then? Are you sure you wanna be my sweet little baby again?” Steve wanted to verify before he moved the conversation to what hopefully would be the last part. Weariness was slowly crawling up on him and he would much like to catnap before he had to go find Bruce so he could check his injuries; besides, the signs that Tony was slipping deeper into his headspace were becoming more obvious, and Steve had no desire of delaying his much-needed Little time any longer.
“The whole age play thing, I don’t wanna do it anymore.”
“Just the first night,” Steve remarked, and he couldn’t help smiling when Tony’s cheeks acquired a cute shade of pink.
And of course Steve was there.
“I want a glass,” Clint whined pitifully for the fifth time in less than five minutes, pushing away the sippy cup Steve had placed in front of him just a few seconds ago.
But as he grew older, things started to get weird. Abnormal. Often Tony would find himself sucking his thumb without even realizing it – thank God that happened when no one was around, kids could be really mean at that age. There were other times when he just didn’t feel like himself, he felt so vulnerable and fragile that all he wanted was to be held and cuddled. Sometimes he fantasized about one of his admired teachers holding him on his lap and just comforting him, but obviously that would never happen – could never happen – not to mention that those thoughts were very odd. And it was on those days, when he was feeling kind of off, that Tony was afraid of going to bed, because on those nights especially he would wake up in the middle of the night with wet sheets and pajama bottoms stuck to his skin. Not only was it humiliating, but dealing with soiled sheets was a pain when living in a boarding school.

“Tony, eat, please.” The last word wasn’t necessarily pronounced politely. “And stop with the swearing once for all.” And the tone of his voice should have been taken as a warning, for the soldier was very patient, but his patience wasn’t limitless.
“Why are you still mad at me?” Steve asked, and when he got a shrug for an answer, he didn’t hesitate to land his hand again on his partner’s butt, who yelped. “I told you I want verbal answers.”
“Dinner’s ready. C’mon” Steve announced, gripping Tony under his arms and lifting him so his feet supported him, the latter still too sleepy to be able to restrain.
“Today,” Steve had told Tony when he kissed him goodbye before leaving for SHIELD’s headquarters. Tony still didn’t understand why Steve insisted on updating Clint’s mission reports, nor how Clint had managed to fall

"JARVIS!" This wasn’t supposed to sound like a whine, but it kind of did.
“Sorry, baby, but it’s dinner time,” Steve said, leaning down and managing to slide his hands under Tony’s armpits so he could scoop Tony up off the bed.
But of course, there was a day when Tony couldn’t bring himself to ask JARVIS to turn the screen off. Or rather, a night. Steve hadn’t been in their bedroom when Tony had gone there well into the night, which made him wonder where Steve could be, since it was incredibly rare he went late to bed when not being in a mission. Tony thought about not making too much of a fuss about it and go straight to bed, and he would have done that, if his brain hadn’t reminded him about the possibility of Steve being with Clint.
They had talked, of course they had talk, they never went without speaking to each other for more than five days. Steve was positive that that was the time required to cool off and waiting more would make things worse.
“Tony?” Phil called. He stood very close to the door but he didn't open it, afraid that only caused another attempt to escape from Tony.  "Tony, are you okay?" he asked, receiving no answer. He pressed his ear against the door, and the only thing he could hear was Tony's heavy breathing, so uneven that there was no doubt he was trying not to cry, but he was failing miserably. “Tony, please, answer to me, I just wanna know if you're okay,” he insisted.
“It’s midnight already, you didn’t finish, so you might as well rest and keep on working later.”
But first, Tony needed to climb out that damn crib, which he was going to destroy too as soon as his feet were back on the ground. He stood up and staggered a little, the mattress was too soft to be able to stand still on it, so he held onto the side of the crib in order to maintain his balance. Once Tony could keep straight, his breathing stopped abruptly. The diaper had felt squishy when he tried to close his legs. No, this couldn’t be happening to him. With hesitation and dread, Tony took his hand down his diapered crotch and squeezed it. Yes, he had definitely made use of it.
It took Tony several more minutes to be able to control himself. To be honest, Steve’s reassurances didn’t help a lot, Tony did hear them, but he wasn’t really paying attention to them, he was more concentrated on the fact that Steve knew about his Little side, which meant everything would change from now on.
“One more, Jarvis, one more,” Tony hissed, increasing the pressure in his forehead.
“Come on buddy, let’s just put this on you so we can go and do whatever you want. We can watch a movie, or play something. Are you hungry? I bet you are, I can make you whatever you want to eat,” Phil offered, hoping any of those suggestions made Tony change his mind. Tony kept shaking his head. “C’mon kiddo, come with me, let me diaper you,” he insisted, taking Tony’s hand in his.
“Of course we can talk Cap! Don’t thigh you star-spangled ass. What do you want to talk about, huh? Do you want to ask me for an improvement on your shield? Do you want a color change, I don’t know, something a little bit pinkish? Do you think your pants need to be tighter? Because let me tell you, your fans would totally love that! Or maybe you want my help to steal Fury’s eyepatch! I know you’ve been thinking about that too! But let me tell you something here Gramps, we are definitely going to be benched after that, are you…”
Tony threw his hands in the air as he exclaimed, “oh, c’mon!”, before letting himself fall backwards. “I hate you,” he muttered behind a pillow.
Sorry for the delay. I hope you enjoyed it.
I wasn't in the mood of working today, so I wrote instead (I didn't have a lot to do anyway, so no regrets).
“But it’s boring to play Mario Kart with no one,” Clint had whined.
“No problem, Cap,” Bruce said, pulling his torn pants so they wouldn’t fall down. Seriously, where were his spare clothes?
“Then why are you stealing them? What kind of fucked up thing are you doing now?”
?” Steve wanted to know, pointing at the white diaper.
If adult Tony was reluctant to take medication, little Tony proved to be much worse in that aspect. No matter how much Phil insisted, asked, begged, threatened, blackmailed or tricked, Tony wouldn’t agree to take ibuprofen. Phil had to crush the pill and dissolve it in water to get Tony to take it. Everything would have been okay after that if Tony hadn't refused to drink from anything that wasn't a glass, and if Clint hadn't picked that exact moment to kick his legs in annoyance because Phil had stopped reading the book.
“You know, couples tend to start acting like each other after some time,” Phil commented, his eyes holding a disapproving look. Steve felt a flush prickled his skin, and he hurried to put in the leg he had already swung out of the window.
“I wasn’t,” Tony denied, unaware he was pouting.
"No!" Tony yelled, smacking a hand over his mouth right away. It was too late, Steve had already stopped and turned around to look at him.
Steve hadn’t gotten a wink of sleep all night. Breathing was uncomfortable, broken ribs tended to be more sensitive and the mere act of inhaling and exhaling was putting too much pressure on them; his left arm was terribly numb, the splint becoming more constricting by the minute; the scabs were itchy and unpleasant, and that was kind of a big deal when there were more than a few cuts and wounds in various stages of healing all over his body; his head was throbbing, a full-blown migraine threatening to emerge; and, to top it all off, the lack of mobility had made his joints get sore.
Steve stared at him for a while, as he started to rocking them both back and forward, until Tony couldn’t stand his sight and hid his face against his chest, snuggling closer. Steve chuckled before he began to hum, tightening his grip. His heart always melted whenever he saw Tony trying to hide, still feeling too ashamed about this whole situation. Letting his eyes closed, Steve kept rocking and rubbing Tony’s tummy with his thumb, enjoying the moment of serenity.
If you saw any mistakes, please let me know :)
Steve could have taken Tony to their room and change him there, but there was no way he was going to leave Clint alone, especially not when the latter would take any opportunity to try to go and look for Phil. So, Steve ended up deciding to wait until Tony fell asleep to remove the drenched diaper, and it took him only ten minutes to regret that decision. With everything that had been going on with Clint, Steve totally forgot about how much juice Tony had drunk. The diaper couldn’t hold that amount of pee, and it ended up leaking. That only distressed Tony even more.
Fury had been more than furious, and he would have kicked Iron man out of the team if he had known what had really happened. Bruce had been devastated when he saw the result of transformation and had stopped talking to Tony for more than a month. Tony had felt worse than crap. And Steve, well, that was when Tony found out Steve would not hesitate to put him over his knee and stop him from sitting comfortable for a week at least. And at the end, Tony had slipped into his Little mindset anyway. So, everything had been incredibly futile.
“Ooh! I never thought you mentioned it! You finally made up your mind! You want to stop being a virgin! Let me tell you, it was about time, being a 90-year-old virgin is just not correct! So, you tell me how you want to deal with this, I can get you a…”
“I wouldn’t do that if I were you JARVIS, I don’t think Tony wants to get the glass replaced for the sixth time” Again, Captain America never backed away when he wanted something, especially when that something was making him leave the workshop. Tony hadn’t found a glass resilient enough to take one of the cap’s hit with his shield.
“I can’t say anything about something I don’t even know what is,” Steve replied, “Really Phil, I’m completely lost here.”
Dropping a kiss onto the tip of Tony’s nose, Steve pulled his thumb away, action that earned him a protesting whine. Steve smiled fondly at that; not long ago his baby would be quite ashamed of sucking on a pacifier or his thumb, so it was nice knowing he was starting to seek comfort in those kind of things without giving it much thought.
“And you will write my reports for the next fifty missions,” Clint added.
“Just tell me what things you want to do, and leave the rest to me,” Steve encouraged.

The problem was Tony couldn’t be with daddy if they weren’t age playing. Steve was the one who usually decided when to have a play date, and Tony just went along with it. Whether that was because Steve tended to choose the moment when Tony was too overtired and overworked to fight back, or because Tony was starting to enjoy it, Tony couldn’t tell yet. The only thing he knew was that it was somehow easier to let Steve make that decision. It was easier for his mind to believe someone else was prompting him to do something he still wasn’t sure he should do or not. He should like or not.
“Very good, baby boy, only two more and you’ll be done.”
I'm sorry if it's going a bit too slow right now.
“Yes. Why do you sound so surprised?”
"I'm sorry sir, but you asked me not to let anyone until you finish, no matter what," The A.I. answered, causing Tony’s smirk to fade.
However, when Steve recovered a week later (and Tony couldn’t help feeling a bit jealous of the serum healing properties, since the last time he broke one of his ribs, it took him five long weeks to recuperate) Tony was left without any excuse. Fortunately, on the following days, some board meetings, as well as various unfinished projects and a few calls to assemble hadn't allowed Tony to even think about that issue.
Jealousy, it had to be jealousy. How else could Tony explain why he hadn’t been able to get rid of that mental picture of Clint snuggled on Steve’s lap?
“Nothing is broken Tony, but you sure hurt your hand,” Steve informed as he placed the ice on Tony’s hand, making him flinch. “How on earth did you think hitting me was a good idea?” Steve asked as he wrap an arm around Tony’s waist.
The first thing Steve would have to do was get Clint to stop playing video games, he might have disliked the fact that he had to play by himself, but taking into account how he was yelling at the TV now, he had long forgotten that and he was really enjoying himself. Taking away a toy which Clint was playing with was never a good idea. Steve could blackmail him, there were some chocolate cookies in the cabinets Clint loved, and he would do whatever Steve asked if he got one of them. But, if Steve’s purpose was to put Clint to bed, giving him sugar wasn’t the right way to proceed.
“As tempting as that idea sounds,” Steve managed to say during the lapses Tony let his mouth free, “the only thing you’re going to do tonight is to eat, to take a shower and to sleep,” he informed.
That made sense, after all, those kind of mindsets were usually used as a way to relax and forget about all the problems, at least for a while.
“I’m OK,” Tony lied, rubbing his chin.
“You’re gonna give yourself a tummy ache if you continue drinking like this,” Steve warned as he opened the fridge and reached for the bottle of apple juice. Tony kept shaking his head and pressed the sippy cup against Steve’s chest.
From that moment on, Tony’s life was invaded by people who told him he had to get rid of his Little side. Howard didn’t hesitate to send him to numerous psychologists where he had to put up with endless hours of therapy, trying to explain something he didn’t even understand himself. But he wasn’t stupid, quite the opposite he was a genius, so he never told the truth to any of the psychologists, he just said enough so his father would be satisfied when they reported back to him about his sessions.
“Steve?”  Tony repeated as he sat up and yawned behind his hand. Perhaps Steve had gone to the bathroom. Tony went as quiet as possible so he could hear any sound coming from the bathroom, unconsciously hugging his teddy bear to his chest when the silence told him there was nobody else in the room but him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Don’t wanna wear diapers,” Clint repeated, trying to quell the sobs.
“Don’t you like Clint?” Steve blurted. If he allowed Tony to continue talking, he would never stop. He tended to do that when he got nervous, and serious conversation always had that effect on him.
With the intention of giving him some space to cool off, Steve had waited a few hours before going to look for him. He shouldn't have waited that long. When he went to the workshop and didn't find him there, he started to get suspicious. Then, when he had looked in all the places where Tony usually hid when he was sulking and didn't see him there either, he started to get anxious. And when JARVIS told him where to find him without having to ask, he started to worry for real.
Tony’s stomach clenched. “That’s not possible, he didn’t tell me anything. He never leaves without letting me know he’s going on a mission.”
- - - -
And from then on, Steve had soaked up everything JARVIS helped him to find about Age Play on the Internet. What a headspace was, the age ranges it covered, how some people liked to pretend they were children of the opposite gender, and so on. The more Steve knew about the topic, the less likely it’d be to mess things up when hanging out with little Clint.
“Sir, this is the second time I have to ask Dr. Banner to use to stairs instead,” JARVIS informed, and Tony could’ve sworn there was a hint of amusement in his voice, “if I have to deny him the access to the elevator for a third time, he might think it’s broken and come looking for you, which would only ruin your plans for the afternoon.”
So, today, when Tony walked into their living room and told him he wanted to play, Steve couldn’t deny he’d been a bit taken aback; thrilled, but taken aback. Truth be told, he’d been expecting Tony to take more time, to resist a little more, to try a little harder to get out of this dilemma, but he hadn’t. That was something good, wasn’t it? Steve wanted to believe it was.
Over the last couple of months, Steve had been hanging out with Clint every once in a while. With
“I don’t want to do it.”
Tony didn’t even bother to sit up. “Go away,” he muttered, not in a mood of being around anyone.
Even if there had been no scolding, Clint had begun to cry as soon as Steve asked him what had happened. Before he could stop him, Clint ran to the bathroom and locked himself in, calling for his daddy. Steve knocked on the door persistently, assuring Clint he wasn’t mad at him at all, and promising he would order another pizza provided Clint let him in first, with no luck. In between sobs, Clint had told him that he didn’t want another pizza, he wanted his daddy and he wanted to go.
It took Tony around twenty minutes to gain consciousness, during which time Steve took advantage to stroke his hair in a reassuring way as he hummed; anything that helped him to prevent a flare-up so early in the morning was good. It apparently worked, because Steve saw a slight smile flicker across Tony’s face before confusion washed over his features.
