“John.” Sherlock praised, rocking his hips in his seat as a warm hand slipped through the opening of his boxer-briefs and took hold of his swollen cock.
“Talking and
“John.” Sherlock began. “There’s something I’ve wanted to say....”
John paused and turned his head from the cushion to stare at Sherlock's face, struggling to read him and contemplating just what it was Sherlock wanted from him. This was another test.
“And you invaded Afghanistan.” Sherlock teased, smiling slyly.
"Jesus fucking Christ."
~~~~~~~~~~~~
“I… uh… I’m going to a local art exhibit and I… Would you like to come?” John bumbled, but eventually managed to ask what he truly desired.
"John." Sherlock murmured, dropping his bags and moving towards the vibrating alpha and wordlessly wrapped his arms around him.
“I—that’s all fine.” John reassured warily, not liking just how detached Sherlock seemed about all this. Surely he could open up a little. John wouldn’t dream of asking for too much so soon, but some…
Sherlock needed to do more research. This wasn't working in the way he wanted. He wanted John to stare at him with something other than acceptance.
Sherlock was surprised by John’s lifestyle, his interest in playing rough sports — he didn’t fit into the norms of an omega. And yet, somehow Sherlock found it all rather delightful. As Sherlock read on, his face tensed into a deep frown, the alpha within him displeased to find records that John had been and was still being bullied in school. Dozens upon dozens of school fights and evidence of hazing, all started the same way: a group of peers initiating it and John struggling to defend himself.
“Going to.” John exhaled shakily, rocking his hips up and aligning their cocks. Pressing down and against Sherlock’s chest, John buried his arms under the taller man’s back, and in this new position their cocks were tightly compressed together against their stomachs.
"Sherlock." John sighed warmly, pressing an affectionate kiss to the omega's brow.
Knowing he couldn’t hide out forever; John exited the bathroom and met Sherlock halfway through his pacing in the hall.
John did as he was told, shuffling back and pressing his back in the gray chair, Sherlock's knees bordering his sides as he kneeled there.
“You’re being relocated again. Poland. Someone will be there to pick you up in twenty minutes with your new information. Pack what is necessary, I’ll handle the rest.” Mycroft informed.
John wasn't sure how Sherlock could have deduced his intentions, but then Sherlock spoke, explaining.
“Sherlock, go on without me. Harry texted earlier, I think she might be drinking again. I wanted to go see her after lunch.”
"No. He... I didn't mean to lead him on. You were right Sherlock, this wasn't going to end well. You were right."
"What about Mary?"
John sensed the topic wasn’t one Sherlock desired and that he should stop it there. He should allow this particular conversation to end where it had, but… John needed to clarify, clarify a paining thought within.
Sherlock glared at Mycroft, knowing his brother would follow his threat with action. No hesitation. The idea of being locked in
They flirted, shamelessly in front of John. Sherlock didn’t seem to notice him during these times and that was far more paining a realization.
“You mean me.”
“It means this marriage…is real in every sense.” John defined.
John's hands lowered and clutched to the globes of Sherlock's buttocks, fingers seeped into the cleft, dampening in the remains of slick that was there. His poor Sherlock had been suffering alone, producing so much slick in preparation, and yet he'd been unable to seek the attention John would and was eagerly giving. He'd give more than his attention and care, he'd give all of himself for his Sherlock.
"Felt good."
John met cerulean blue eyes, flecked in silver and green, so beautifully singular. It amazed John that Sherlock’s eyes always seemed to change in shade, intensity and color depending on the lighting and the clothes he wore. It was always a welcomed surprise.
"I... The very reason I started spending time with Victor was because he understood me in a way not many can. I... When we married, you weren't the kindest or-"
“I will.” Sherlock swore and grinned toothily, butterflies swarming in his stomach.
"Breed."
"Sorry. I'll give you more of a warning next time." Gregory promised and turned to nuzzle his mate's pale hand when Mycroft stroked a thumb over his cheek.
John was married, and he loved his mate, though Sherlock could be a right ass, and their marriage was more pretense than anything else. John was a faithful alpha submissive, and although he was flattered, he’d never accept anyone else.
Sherlock glared at him. "Your penis is..."
“Sherlock…” John’s voice broke, so weak, so soft, and barely audible; saying that name tore John’s bleeding heart to pieces.
in a crack house, John lost it. He yelled and berated Sherlock, and damn his mate for lying to him. Pretending he wasn't high off his kite. As if John was going to take Sherlock's word that he was clean. No. John had dragged Sherlock out of that crack house, arguing all the way to the car. He'd even gone as far as shoving Sherlock's protesting form inside the car Mary was waiting in. Once they were all inside they went straight to the lab, because he was going to test Sherlock's urine.
John nodded and wondered where these questions came from? Did Sherlock, perceptive as he was, sense John was truly going to open himself up to this marriage and see where it led them? Was he trying to infer if John’s feelings were different from what he’d demonstrated during his heat cycle? John didn’t know, but he wished he did.
Sherlock palmed his mouth, stilling any words from escaping.
Lestrade wasn’t lying. Mycroft knew how to spot a lie. There was only sincerity in Lestrade’s eyes, but still.
Sherlock growled with displeasure and disgust, as if he would take the polygamous alpha's words to heart.
Sherlock rested his head on the pillow beside John’s head and grumbled a string of curses as he released John, hissed a breath and slipped out of the bed before storming out to address the continuous pounding of a fist to their door.
Mycroft winced at the comprehension that this care he held was strong, and even as he’d denied it to himself, this pain compared closely to the pain he’d felt at the loss of Gigi.
Sherlock's nose crinkled with revolt at that notion. Many true mates, upon first seeing each other fell in love. It was a thing Sherlock had wished for when he was a child, but now found hard to believe.
“Mental is strictly reserved for you.” John murmured lovingly. Sighing happily, John palmed the hand Sherlock used to stroke his cheek.
“Get some rest John. You have to go to work soon.”
carrying a rather large litter of pups for them.
“I… I’m pregnant.” John wheezed. It was difficult to breathe without the oxygen mask.
“Sherlock, I’m sorry.” John finally spoke with great remorse. He’d take Sherlock’s rants eagerly, knowing he’d fucked up. “I understood.
"Another one of your bloody tricks."
“Fine then,
Sherlock needed to defuse the situation and quickly, or his omega would start another scene. This one would be far worse, in front of his entire family. John was an omega and he was to be an obedient mate. But since Sherlock was ten, he suspected his omega was the farthest thing from obedient. Sherlock didn’t mind. John could be as aggressive as he liked, if he wanted to control their marriage, Sherlock would follow his omega’s lead. But this couldn’t stand. Sherlock really didn’t mind John snapping at his parents, he’d rather enjoy hearing what the man had to say, but this was different. Sherlock didn’t want his entire family to despise John for being disrespectful to Sherlock’s status as an alpha.
John stilled his movement for one brief moment, his mind was fogging over with lust, but still a part of him was begging his omega instincts to stop, to not go further, that this was
Mycroft swallowed thickly, nodded jerkily and bolted.
"Oh...
John laughed softly and received an arched brow and a flash of questioning sea-green eyes.
Twisting in his seat, John looked out of the window.
"Yes." John gritted out burying his head in the cushion of the couch in a desperate attempt to keep his face from view of the camera.
The silence started once more and as they turned left, John glanced over to Sherlock, still three feet behind him, seeming to give him the distance he wanted. He loved keeping their distance, but if he wanted to make an effort, he’d have to go outside of his comfort zone.
"Come here and kiss me. Please John? Come here." Sherlock pled, unbelievably exhausted, though he hadn't done much of anything.
Mrs. Watson stood and hurriedly went to her son’s side and Sherlock felt a pang of soreness claim his heart as his omega whimpered, whimpered for his mother’s comfort because he was afraid of Sherlock.
Tears fogged John’s vision as Sherlock’s other hand joined the one caressing his belly. Then Sherlock’s lips were there too, and his hands slid to his sides as Sherlock kissed wetly along the welt of his surgical scar and John whimpered, pained and heartened by Sherlock’s kind—almost loving token.
“John?”
John blinked up at him, mouth parted slightly, yet words did not come forth. Sherlock knew that look. It was a look John gave him when Sherlock surprised him so much he was stupefied.
That next morning at breakfast when John asked where Sherlock was, Mycroft had answered. Apparently, Sherlock owned a flat in the city and would be staying there for some time, solving a case or something of that sort, though John wasn’t sure about that. Maybe it was the way Mycroft spent each meal glaring murderously at him, seeming to blame John for Sherlock’s absence.
John belted out a scream of horror as his heart stuttered in its beating, before pounding harshly alone and John knew Sherlock was gone. He couldn't feel his presence at all. Not even faintly.
“More.” John sobbed, tapering his grip on dark tresses, drawing Sherlock the closest that was achievable.
Mycroft's outstretched hand dropped much like his head. Staring at their feet, Mycroft merely released a noise of agreement, and that seemed to be enough for Gregory to understand.
“I do. I… You have
"Good to know you knew you were."
he could do and Sherlock would only ever do the least for John, never more than it. Ever.
John's brows furrowed, wondering if Sherlock was giving him an invitation. When Sherlock's lips parted slightly, his eyes slowly shut, and he tilted his head down and near, John hesitantly leaned in to press his lips against Sherlock's. The moment their lips touched, Sherlock jerked back. John didn't have a moment to prepare before Sherlock slapped him across the cheek.
Still, after his phone call, Sherlock thought it best he restock their food supply as they were running low and he wanted to make sure that before he started back on his Sex Holiday, they had supplies to last. So Sherlock left a slumbering alpha in bed and hurriedly went grocery shopping.
"Sherlock." John gasped, eyes gleaming in the light of the room.
"Exactly how many people did you sleep with?!"
Sherlock never considered John would reject him. He had wanted John for so long, fallen for him over the years of secretly spying on him. He should have known better. How could John fall for him so quickly, knowing next to nothing about him? Sherlock had thought… expected that once John realized he would care for him, John would love him in return. He’d been a fool for thinking it possible.
Raising his hands up, Sherlock gripped John's ass cheeks and yanked him closer, taking more of John's cock, gagging as he adjusted to the fullness of a little more than the head, and exhaled shakily from his nose.
“So you date?”
“Go.” John broke out in a harsh breath, raising a hand to his chest and rubbing at the soreness that lay beneath.
“You won’t touch yourself. I won’t let you get off that easy.”
Those dark blue eyes had shed more tears. The alpha shook his head and his blond hair tossed about. Sherlock thought it looked silky-soft, but he'd never admit that aloud.
“Good alpha.” John complemented, twirling fingers of one hand in the alpha’s hair while his other took hold of Sherlock’s hand currently stroking his stomach, and brought it to his mouth, showering kind kisses on long slender fingers.
“Please.” The alpha breathed despairingly.
Sherlock blinked within the silence of the flat and reread the letter, blinked again, then reread it four more times. Standing dumbly within the living room, the ticking of the clock within the living room being the only sound, other than the harsh panting becoming all the more rough and rabid projecting from Sherlock’s parted mouth.
Sherlock pushed back, working through the four agents’ resistance and stared red eyed at Mycroft who looked apprehensive, and he should be, because Sherlock was going to obliterate him.
“No, John. I… I told you I didn’t want this. Why did you stop your suppressants!?” Sherlock’s omega was quickly taking notice to the bitter fragrance of come filling the room, so thick, so…
Sherlock was too preoccupied with wiping away the irritation from his eyes to see that John had joined him. Not until the alpha groused out his name with barely-contained anger.
"To hate myself, every day of my life."
“John.” Sherlock eagerly tucked his head alongside John’s scent gland and inhaled noisily.
They'd... copulated. Repeatedly, a surprising amount of times for only three days. Sherlock could remember each time, each thing they said. His entrance was sore. Sherlock could feel it now, a dull pulsing that was another reminder that he and John...
There was a brief pause on the other end, before Mycroft spoke again, voice filled with incredulity and uncertainty.
John broke and laughed, enthralled by Sherlock’s eccentric sense of humor. Sherlock chuckled heartily, eyes sparking with mirth.
“I want to know. Tell me… Please.”
“Don’t say that John.” Sherlock implored despairingly, standing up and moving to stand before John.
“John.” Sherlock spoke insistently, standing from his chair and staring alarmed when John raised a hand to his mouth.
“Piss off.”
“Just like that. Pull that trigger, Mr. Moriarty, and we both go up.” John snarled.
Sherlock squirmed in his seat, his heated wetness becoming unbearable. John's scent was changing, the sweetness was being drowned out almost entirely by the heavy musk of -
However, John did see Victor. It was less than before Sherlock discovered their secreted friendship, but he knew it was far more than what Sherlock would have wanted. None, would be most pleasing for his omega. John always told Sherlock when he was going to meet up with Victor, and where they were meeting. He always felt guilty when Sherlock's eyes turned soft and directed their focus on anything but John's own. He didn't like it, but John was not ready to give up this friendship. He needed a friend in his life right now.
.” Sherlock hissed, fraught and John was bewildered.
"Going to, just wait."
"I love you."
"Captain, tell me how much you like being dominated."
John glared at Mary from across the kitchen table.
John laughed nervously and pressed Sherlock’s hand over his chest, allowing the silently panicking Sherlock to feel his racing heart.
Apparently, though Mycroft was John’s mediator, he didn’t care enough to find out why it was John texted him during his heat for Sherlock’s address. It was obvious the older alpha wasn’t pleased with him. He could only imagine what Sherlock had told him. Nevertheless, John didn’t care enough for Mycroft to think too long about it.
"Wait until after everyone has their cake in hand, then we'll go outside for some fresh air, since by then you'll be suffering from a hot flash. After, we can sneak out of here and go home."
Sherlock's vice-like grip gradually loosened, allowing the alpha to continue, growing limp-like in his arms. Face turning away to stare at the wall, because he knew John didn't understand. True, omega's were known to be smaller than alphas and betas, but Sherlock wasn't even the average length of a typical omega.
Not guilty was the unanimous verdict. Not guilty. Moriarty was free to go. Moriarty, the man who’d killed their children. The man who’d almost taken John’s life was found not guilty for his crimes—though there was
Mycroft shut off his computer, downed the rest of his scotch, and rose from his chair. Intent with seeking his own rest in his cool bed sheets within the bleakness of his room.
“You can’t imagine how much pain it caused me to… I’m so sorry John, but I couldn’t lose you. You would have died if I didn’t.”
What was there left to say… Sherlock didn’t want him. John’s heat was burning through him and he needed to care for himself because Sherlock wouldn’t. As John staggered up the stairs, his clothing clinging to him by sweat, his lungs burning by harsh panting, he felt rejected and unwanted by his much loved mate. Sherlock didn’t even care for the love John was offering him.
John tensed, the action pure aggression, and if anyone else but his mate had done so to him, it would be in his rights to attack the wolf. One did not flash one's canines if one did not wish to battle. Death for one of the parties usually followed the action. For a mate to do so to their counterpart, an omega to do so to their alpha, was a challenge for power. John had long ago accepted that he held no power within their relationship. He'd relinquished his rights to be any kind of alpha to his mate when he'd broken him. Sherlock did such to show that he was the one in power and it should be John's place to give, submit to Sherlock, an omega. Humiliation to the extreme for an alpha, but that was his intent, to humiliate and shame John.
John grumbled with dissatisfaction. Figuring his feelings were far too confusing to understand at this very moment, he decided to sleep on it. John just needed to sleep this off and things would hopefully make sense later.
“I don't know, maybe.”
Sherlock palmed his face in his hands and groaned. God, this pregnancy was torture. He couldn't do eight more months of this.
“I’m glad.” Sherlock ducked his head shyly, staring up at John bashfully.
." John rasped, planting a chaste kiss to his lips before licking away a bit of his own release that managed to slip past Sherlock's lips and stained his chin. Sherlock hummed pleasantly at the action and rolled onto his side, facing John.
“I’m fine Sherlock. I’m sorry to have caused you trouble.” John brushed past the omega, making sure to never meet Sherlock’s eyes directly, and quickly headed for the kitchen—because he was actually starving.
If he took what could clearly be his now, he wasn't sure he'd be able to treasure and nurture it. There were so many things wrong with him. He'd been emotionally, mentally, and physically abused as a child. Those betas had destroyed his fragile mind to the point where he couldn't love Sherlock in the way he wanted to. The way he knew his husband deserved.
“You want to share my room. Make yours into a nursery.” Sherlock deduced and John went red in the face by the alpha’s frankness.
"What?"
“This is your alpha’s older brother, Mycroft Holmes.” Mrs. Watson established, and placed a kind hand on the quiet gentleman’s shoulder. “He will be the mediator. If you need anything, just ask Mycroft and he will do all he can to make you comfortable.”
“What is it then?” Sherlock barked, hating how he felt lightness that John wasn’t like other alphas who appreciated the looks of omegas like Victor.
Inhaling a deep breath, Sherlock held it in his chest for a long pause. Exhaling it heavily, he moved to open the door and entered the well-lit room. His gaze hardly met John's own before the alpha was on him. Hands shot out to palm his battered face. Dark blue searchingly took in the damage, lips parted in a breathless gasp as John took notice of the bandaged gash on his head, the bandage already turning red.
Sherlock’s soft sea green stared at John full of sentiment and John wasn’t sure if love was a part of those emotions, but he hoped it was.
“Just the usual stuff.”
Family, kin, finally everything lined up perfectly. Moriarty, Magnussen, and their followers were all gone and they didn’t have to worry about their lives. At last a weight had been lifted from Sherlock’s shoulders and he could finally please his alpha. He no longer had to feel any guilt for denying John pups, for denying them a family.
Secretly, John liked how Sherlock touched and spoke to him within his act, but another part of him couldn't fully enjoy it knowing it was a lie.
Sherlock clamped his eyes shut, bit into his bottom lip to hold back a whimper of need and shakily carded his fingers through John's hair.
Why would Sherlock possibly still want such an old discolored thing? It was well past the time in which it should be thrown away and John could tell it certainly wasn’t a brand made towel. He had towels similar to this one, but even he would have thrown them away if they’d gotten
“I’m sorry!” John choked out, part fear, part horror.
And yet...
"John?" Sherlock pled. John seriously needed to let him know if he wanted this, or if he wanted to never have this conversation again.
"Do it now."
The soft tapping of fine leather shoes echoed from outside the room. John tensed, rolled back on his side, facing away from the door, and threw the covers over his head. Tensing when the door creaked as the alpha entered the room and he shut the door noiselessly behind him. John strained to hear the alpha as he moved within the dark; the alpha was making it a point to remain quiet, and it was hard for John to hear much. However, he heard the door to the closet open, the dull clacking of hangers moving, shuffling of clothing, the shutting of the closet, then another door opening — the bathroom, before it shut.
Lying down in his bed, smiling softly to himself as his eyes fluttered shut and he drifted to sleep, John felt sureness in this.
Sherlock's defined cheekbones were round and soft, and nearly always flushed with the great work it took him to move about. Sherlock spread open his shirt, revealing himself fully to John's sight and -
John flinched regardless of his desire not to. He was nearly infertile and Irene was merely stating what he’d already contemplated. Irene
Sherlock walked passed Anderson and Sally and entered the building. John spared a moment to glance at the two, then down to Sally’s knees before entering the building himself.
John watched Sherlock and Mycroft converse. Sherlock wanted to leave and Mycroft wanted him to change and agree to help on a secretive, but apparently important case.
Jean started coming home later than normal and working every weekend. When this happened, Gregory knew it wasn’t work that was taking Jean’s time. Especially after one night Jean came home smelling heavily of another alpha. She wasn’t even trying to hide it in the end. They’d finally decided this marriage wasn’t working for them and filed for divorce.
"I don't care to hear your despicable excuses. Now then... Remove your clothes." Sherlock's voice was clipped and to the point.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
John and Sarah went out for lunch sometimes and John enjoyed their conversations. Sarah was a sweet woman and John did hope that one day she would find someone to fill the emptiness in her heart, but that could never be him.
“No. No, no, no. Too assertive.”
“Fuck you.” John growled, hands shooting out and grabbing the collar of Sherlock’s purple shirt and bringing him in close. “I
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sherlock's eyes snapped open, not realizing he'd shut them. Panting heavily, Sherlock stared up wildly at the John before him that wasn't the John of before. The John of before wore day clothes. This John of now wore a gray t-shirt and black sweats, hair no longer combed neatly - no, this John of now hair stuck up as if he'd just woken from sleep. John's eyes were just as wide and full of fear, searching Sherlock's with confused wonder.
" Sherlock's voice wavered, his chin trembled, and he angrily blinked back the wetness in his eyes.
Bowing his head in shame, Sherlock couldn't fault John. His alpha had a big heart and only ever wished to comfort others. That's why he was such a good doctor, friend, and mate.
Sherlock couldn't control his breathing, not enough so to breathe through his mouth, and so he was helpless to take in the scent of his mate. The scent he'd tried so hard not to and as he took in his scent he felt a calmness consume him, relaxing in the alpha's arms and feeling his eyes close drowsily.
“John, oh God, breathe.”
“Two weeks left.” John whispered to himself.
"I'm done with you, for now. You may shower or whatever it is you like. I have a video to edit." Sherlock turned his back on his mate and headed for his computer.
Only two hours earlier Mycroft came with a car to pick him up from his apartment. As soon as they arrived at the mansion, John was led to a room and given a fine wedding tux and shoes. He was then left to prepare himself.
"John." Sherlock sighed, dabbing the cigarette out on his saucer.
Sherlock shook his head, unable to accept the truth of John’s words.
This could all work out perfectly if John monitored their first meeting, steering their conversations appropriately. John had to lie to Sherlock and Harry in order to make this work, but it could. He had to make it work because in the end, he’d protected the two people he loved the most. Lying was wrong, he knew this, but in this situation John found himself in, lying was what saved both Sherlock’s and Harry’s life. That, John concluded, was what mattered and there was no shame in it when one understood that.
. I want this."
“I think maybe I’ll just drop by.” Sherlock’s voice lacked the previous energy.
“Are you all right?” Sherlock asked and John knew it was a strange question to ask, being Sherlock was the one who’d been in immediate danger, but he knew why the alpha was filled with concern. John was pregnant and the stress from this night alone could cause a strain for him.
“After, you say my scent is divine.”
“No.” John shook his head, “How?”
"Yes... Yes, must have been, through that window."
~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Naturally not. They all spy on people for money.”
“I have no forgiveness to lay out. I am exhausted. I’m so very tired of this marriage. Please, just go. I’m sure that… over time, your love will fade. You will find someone else.”
“Mm.” Sherlock mumbled distractedly and crunched a bite of bacon.
“Yes. I’ll head home to her now. Here’s my cell number. Please call me and let me know how he’s doing, and tell me when Sherlock arrives?”
John released a sorrowful whimper.
John gripped the horse’s reins firmly, body tensing with nerves.
“No, Anderson’s my sniffer dog.” Lestrade retorted, nodding towards the kitchen.
Sherlock shoved the drawer closed with more force than was necessary when he looked up and found John’s gaze focused on the towel within, pain clearly written upon his face.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Shut up." Sherlock huffed with embarrassment.
John wanted purpose, a job, and Sherlock bowed down graciously. Omegas once married off predominately stayed at home; their single duty was to care for their home, children, and alpha. Sherlock wanted more for John. If John wanted to work, he wouldn’t stand in his way.
“I don’t.”
Then it was time to give John the bond bite and he cautiously drew in his omega with an arm around his waist. John voicelessly tipped his head back and revealed his tan neck and scent gland. Sherlock found mild comfort in inhaling his omega. Through the fear, Sherlock could scent his omega’s true scent as it calmed him enough so that he began to find enjoyment in gliding his lips over smooth skin, and located the perfect place for the bond bite.
“I could give him what you cannot.” Irene answered coolly.
that was his enemy in every way.
John smiled fondly as the DI exited the room and he laid himself in Lestrade’s bed. Shutting his eyes, John tried to work beyond the omega within roiling angrily as his scent mixed with Lestrade’s alpha’s scent, thickly layering the sheets.
“Open your eyes, John.”
“Mm.” John hummed energetically now, smile broadening, “Our pups.”
Sherlock was still three feet away from him, but John grew nervous with how intensely the alpha stared at him and spun around. Without another word, John led the way. Sherlock followed after him, always remaining three steps behind him. The silence was killing John, though his focus was on trying to find his way out of the maze and part of him couldn’t tolerate the quiet.
“No, but—”
John saw the disbelief in Sherlock’s eyes, the sense of betrayal and his stomach roiled, unsettled.
John was then transferred to Afghanistan and his life changed forever. He’d been shot and sent back invalid. He gained a tremor in his hand that destroyed his life as a surgeon and was left with no means of the life he’d once had. His only friend was that of his cane and limp.
“Thirty-six.”
Sherlock tuned out of their conversation then. He didn't care to hear what they had to say. Instead he quickly began gathering all the voices that still dwelled within his mind, intent on tearing them to shreds.
Sherlock rolled his eyes again.
“Do you know the big problem with a disguise, Mr. Holmes? However hard you try, it's always a self-portrait.”
“Sorry, it’s just…um, nerves, I think.” John explained to a curious Donovan.
" Sherlock's vulgarity was more than a turn on for John, but he was done in by the lustful silver eyes that devoured his soul.
“Shhh.” Sherlock cooed in John’s ear.
“I didn’t want a mate, and this gave me time to develop a plan that would ensure I didn’t need to bond. Then I met you…” Sherlock looked up at John, hopeful to receive something in John’s stare; he didn’t find it and pursed his lips in a frown.
“So no redheads and less muscular alphas?”
was an alpha to do this.
They'd been living together for two weeks now and John hadn't slept in the spare room since that night. Sherlock amended his command and now the two shared a bed, but the coldness of that bed was a stab to John's heart. A reminder of what he'd done wrong and all the ways he was failing. Sherlock only allowed John to hold him close and scent him until he fell asleep. After which point John was told he should release him and sleep on the edge of the bed. Sherlock didn't want to touch John longer than he had to.
A shuddering whimper pierced the silence of the home as the omega collapsed on a nearby chair and palmed his head in his hands."
“John… I do believe you are a gentleman tonight. Good heavens what would Mycroft say!” Sherlock smirked.
“No. Sherlock. I will never get over this.”
John lifted a hand up and gently palmed Sherlock's clasped hands, causing the omega to raise his head up and stare on with hesitation.
John huffed as if the notion were ridiculous.
Mrs. Holmes shook her head, smiling unhappily.
John’s eyes wandered the expanse of Sherlock’s long lanky body, porcelain smooth skin, and toned lean muscles.
“No, but I'm not the world's only consulting detective.”
"Answer me, damn it!" Sherlock yanked at John's hair. The alpha's neck jerked awkwardly and sent pain piercing his neck and scalp.
"Maybe... Maybe we should take him back to the hospital?" the alpha warily suggested.
“John.” Sherlock rasped faintly.
John knew it was juvenile, but couldn’t stop the laughter from bubbling out of him.
“Where’s he going to be tonight?”
“One time! That was one time and it was because your bloody alpha pheromones messed me up.”
“I would like it if we…” John bowed his head and stared at his feet, unable to look in Sherlock’s eyes when asking him this.
“Do you perhaps… like me?”
John wasn’t the best of cooks, but he was acceptable and he did have signature specialties. He was also great with grilling meats. John typically cooked all their meals and remained sitting eating alone while Sherlock left him after the bites of his meal to occupy his time with something else.
Sherlock's eyes were still shut and his hands still gripped the bed spreads as John muscled his way out of Sherlock's clamped thighs. Sherlock, panting weakly, shivering with the aftershocks of his orgasm, felt his legs fall open in an inelegant sprawl.
"Tell me you're my bitch."
Sherlock's brows furrowed with confusion. Unable to comprehend why... how... John would even want to? They were already bonded. There was no need for courtship. How could John ask him after everything? Sherlock wanted to laugh at the very idea of it. He wanted to chastise John for even thinking for a moment he'd actually say yes.
“Has he forced himself on you?”
“Sofa, Sherlock. It was the sofa.” Mycroft intervened, sensing the tension and in his own way, trying to amend it.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
“I don’t wish to hurt you.” Sherlock declared, raising John’s hand to his mouth and pressed supple lips to the wedding ring that was there.
get a colleague? What did he follow you home?”
John smiled weakly and gave a brief shake of his head.
Sherlock noticeably swallowed and inhaled an uneven breath before nodding his head and took three steps forwards until he stood to John’s side.
“What do I think of you?” John repeated, mildly surprised by the question, it seemed to have come out of nowhere, but then those piercing eyes were looking at him with earnest need, John couldn’t
John didn't hold back, not anymore, he couldn't as he pummeled Sherlock's wet, red entrance. Sherlock was unable to do much anymore, his thrusts grew weak as he drew inwards on himself, gurgling hoarse nonsense, more open vowel whimpers and whines, destroyed by the power and momentum of John's consuming throbbing cock.
“Sherlock… Please.” John gently pleaded, not wishing to physically force Sherlock down; worried he might end up hurting Sherlock even more so in the process.
John knew it bothered Sherlock, but he also needed someone for himself. Someone he could talk with. John had gotten closer to Victor. They'd begun to tell each other more personal things about themselves. John still hadn't told Victor about his marriage to Sherlock yet, because Sherlock hadn't yet decided on when he'd be open to having another wedding ceremony for John's sister.
Mycroft strode through the quiet halls of the hospital, his stride swift, his mind spinning with worrying thoughts.
"I fucked up. Sherlock." John's voice wobbled, his eyesight blurred. He'd hurt Victor - a man he cared for, who was a close friend. He'd just destroyed Victor.
“Sherlock.” John hitched.
“All this time…
They drank their tea in moderate silence. John’s eyes closed, mug held in his hands near his mouth, poised to take another sip while Sherlock continued to analyze the omega.
John knew Sherlock was bored. After such a lengthy string of interesting cases, it would be hard for Sherlock to deal with the dry spell. Sherlock was more than disappointed that Lestrade hadn’t called requesting his assistance.
“John Hamish Watson, do you commit yourself to William Sherlock Scott Holmes, to love, honor, respect each other, to communicate with each other, to look to your own emotional health so that you can relate in a healthy way, and provide a healthy home for children if you choose to have them; to be a support and comfort for your partner in times of sickness and health, as long as love shall last?”
"Mycroft..."
John hated himself more and more, the clearer his mind became after each orgasm. He regretted his confession so much so, and the embarrassment of his behavior, grew and grew, until the very last orgasm of his heat passed.
The hardest of things to allow was separate rooms, but John wanted it and he’d bitten his tongue in acceptance. But…
“You’ve never been the most luminous of people, but as a conductor of light you are unbeatable.”
John didn’t believe him.
“Sherlock.” John stressed, tired from lack of sleep, and attempted to make his way up the stairs to his room, but Sherlock blocked his path.
Sherlock shook his head. He needed his work; he’d have to make it work, on his terms. He’d agreed to marry, but that didn’t mean he agreed to change. What was marriage really? Some papers that said you were recognized as legal partners, a sharing of possessions that was all really. Sherlock could do that. He’d still take his suppressants; he’d be civil with his alpha, but he’d make it clear to the man that their union would be on paper only, and that there was no need for any more than that. If this alpha submissive decided he couldn’t wed under such conditions, the alpha could call off the wedding, than Sherlock wouldn’t have broken the rules of the contract he’d signed and he’d be free to live his life as he’d wanted to, alone.
John followed Mycroft in complete silence, holding the laptop and DVD’s with a lost expression across his face. He hardly heard what the man said, but he noted they’d finished their tour facing the familiar door leading to the bedroom he now shared with the alpha.
John was able to detect the man’s scent clearly: raspberries, caramel, and toffee. It gave off an astonishingly pleasing scent. The pungent raspberries softened the sweetness of caramel and toffee. An omega — one, most would consider stunning, assuredly. The slimming suit the omega wore could not hide the curve of his hips and thighs. Most definitely a specimen that fed into every alpha’s dream of the perfect omega, and if John had to be honest, if he wasn’t assuredly and irrevocably in love with Sherlock, John would find himself a bit flustered in this omega’s presence.
John tucked his head under Sherlock’s chin and inhaled his scent, content that Sherlock smelled more like him than anything else and he knew he must smell heavily of Sherlock.
“John, we need to talk before I—”
“I thought you understood John? I thought you
John didn’t want to talk. His body was burning. Without pause, John reached around him, took hold of the alpha’s cock before he guided Sherlock deep within him.
“And now?”
“Where?”
. We don’t need a mediator. Tell me what it is you require and I will provide it for you.” Sherlock insisted considerately, turning to lean in close.
"I had to promise dinner out with you and your mother, to get her to drop shopping with you." John had the dignity to sound slightly apologetic.
Mary stared at John silently, calculating his features, her blue eyes were ever sharp.
"Sherlock." Mycroft called.
Sherlock’s icy blue stared John down with such revulsion that John felt sick to his stomach. Rising from his chair, Sherlock pressed his hands against the edge of the table and leaned in across the table. John stared warily up as Sherlock’s eyes betrayed the anger that was there and tears gleamed in the alpha’s eyes.
A loud thud sounded and Sherlock's eyes snapped open, his body froze, hands still cradling his bollocks and cock, all while he stared up at a very flushed and shocked John standing at the door. His work satchel lay at his feet and suddenly Sherlock realized the creaking he'd believed to be the bed had actually been the door opening, which meant, John had seen it all, heard it all, and well...
Sherlock hummed weakly, seeming put out and John bit the inside of his cheek with nerves. The alpha ignored his unease and nuzzled his neck affectionately, seemingly amorous post release. John bore it until his eyes fell shut and he drifted back to sleep in the warm arms of his alpha.
“Sherlock.” John reprimanded, pursing his lips and turned to stare at the eager alpha.
.” The traitorous tears managed to escape and John sobbed out his concealed confession.
“I’m going to kill you, Mycroft!” Sherlock shouted as the newly arrived agents helped the tiring four in removing Sherlock from Mycroft’s office.
"...It scares the hell out of me. You could destroy me, but I can't stop loving you... I'm sorry I couldn't say that before everything happened."
Sherlock’s legs stuttered in their movement, hesitant, shaky, frightened and eager. A terrifying need and longing consumed his heart. Sherlock was scared, scared about what he would need to do, scared by his own instincts, scared because all of this was new to him and he didn’t know what was right. He liked knowing things. He liked being aware of the unaware, but this was something that far surpassed all of his knowledge.
Mycroft, however, did promise to talk with Sherlock and get him to take on the appropriate role as his husband. John didn’t think it would hold very much weight. Sherlock didn’t like Mycroft and wouldn’t willingly fold to Mycroft’s will.
His mind palace no longer felt like a safe place, more like a taunting reminder that there was something within that was hidden even from him. That didn’t make sense, because it was
Mrs. Watson smiled softly at her child and palmed his rosy cheek.
. You have a dirty mouth."
John directed his sights to the table and raised his glass of water, drinking a large amount, trying to settle the churning in his stomach.
“I really do care for you Sherlock.”
know.”
“More. Love, I need more.”
fault?  I was
Whatever the reason, John found Sherlock looking at him more than before and he couldn’t understand why. At first he thought he’d had something on his face and even asked Sherlock if that was the case. Sherlock said he didn’t. But then Sherlock’s eyes were back on him after a short while had passed and stayed fixed on him. John was truly confounded.
Two more weeks until John left Sherlock. Three more weeks until Sherlock was to marry the omega.
There was shuffling on the other end and a curse. "Are you okay? Is it the pups?" John rushed worriedly.
“Thank you will suffice.” Sherlock sighed, disappointed in the omega’s response.
Sherlock knew John must feel relief without him there. He must feel safe without him and so when Sherlock received a text from Lestrade about a double homicide case, he’d joylessly taken it.
Only Sherlock had been shot and everything began to unravel. Janine was merely a means for Sherlock to get close to Magnussen. Sherlock explained how Janine and he were acting a part, that they had to make it look convincing so Sherlock could further investigate Magnussen. John's relief that it had all been an act was short lived, because he'd soon discovered who'd shot Sherlock.
Two weeks came and went and during that time, John couldn’t understand why, but his thoughts continuously and frustratingly drifted towards Sherlock. The pained look of those eyes that had stared at him with such want and need, and the memories of each time he shot the alpha down, pushed him away, heartlessly.
Sherlock raised his head, face flushed, his scowl hard and unforgiving. Sherlock knew just what John was implying and he most certainly was not... that, damn what those pregnancy books said.
John raised his head and flashed Sherlock a smile that was all teeth, and that flush that still lingered on John’s face—well, Sherlock didn’t like what it did to his chest.
“I’m obedient to you… Only you.” Sherlock added and John’s eyes widened.
Sherlock was soaked to the bone; his fitted clothes clung tightly to his body, a pool of water circling around him when he’d managed to exit the fountain.
John stood in front of the Holmes’ mansion—it looked more like a medieval castle - and bit the inside of his cheek. What the hell was he to do if his intended was an entitled prat? No, John shouldn’t think so negatively. He might be a kind, understanding man. Someone John could grow to love.
“John.” Sherlock exhaled with reprieve as John bore down and owned him.
“Please, Sherlock. God, please.” John was begging. Even knowing how wrong this was. How he shouldn’t be laying on so much for Sherlock. But he had three AMF’s coursing through his veins and his cock leading his actions. His sense of logic had gone out the window in the wake of his arousal.
John wanted to protest. To tell the Holmes’ that wasn’t what happened, but he couldn’t seem to work up the courage to speak aloud. The meal continued in relative silence. Mrs. Holmes did most of the talking, reminiscing on how beautiful the wedding was, how she was pleased to see everyone who’d been invited had attended, etc... John tuned her out.
Sherlock let out a broken sob, released John’s wrists and wrapped his arms around him, holding John tightly against him.
When John finished exploring downstairs he went up to the east wing. The north, south, and west wing carried no interest for him. He had no real reason to go to them, but for Mycroft’s office in the west, except he knew where that was already. Sherlock gave him permission to look through the east wing already, so John didn’t feel guilty when he went into each room.
Retrieving a red leather-bound wallet from his pocket, Victor took out a white card.
Sherlock hesitated. His requirements were rather difficult…but still. The likelihood of finding an unbound alpha submissive of that age wasn’t… it just wasn’t probable. There was less than a handful of alpha submissives in the entire world and he was most certain he’d read somewhere that they were all bonded.
“Mycroft.” Lestrade called as the gentleman opened the front door on his way out.
Sherlock scoffed at the aforementioned ‘friend’, but John respectfully shook Victor’s hand.
John would care for their children, stare at the clock, knowing Sherlock should be there with them, but instead he’d be with that beta.
"Say something, please, Sherlock." John's eyes looked pained and for whatever reason that didn't sit well with Sherlock.
“No.” Sherlock appeared upset by John’s inability to follow his meaning, shook his head hotly and clarified, “Could you ever see me as a man and not an alpha?”
“I know.”
Victor, whatever Sherlock said,
John Watson had hurt Sherlock deeply and still, he attempted to move on. He'd let the alpha in, and in so doing, opened himself to having his heart trampled on. Of course John couldn't perceive just how much Sherlock's heart broke. True the alpha's abandonment had broken his heart long ago, but now... now those pieces of his heart that had remained were effectively broken into smaller pieces, and there after pulverized.
Sherlock waited and watched, part of himself didn't think the alpha would stoop so low. A part of him believed this would be the alpha's breaking point where he would rise from the floor and curse Sherlock for his games and cruelty. If that were to happen, Sherlock wouldn't care all that much, it would just send him into a rage and that rage would lead him out of this house, looking for another fight that might possibly end his life.
“No.” Sherlock whispered and stroked at the tender flesh.
"If I ever touch you..." Sherlock's anger from that hallucination was driving him to speak in such a way, but he found as the thought entered his mind he liked the idea of it. He would degrade John in the worst way possible for an alpha to be. He'd humiliate this alpha in recompense for John's infidelities. But just to be certain of how cruel and far he would go, he'd first need to know just how deep John's betrayals ran -
"I wasn't laughing at you... Well, I was, but not like that. You're just so adorable. You worry about the most silliest things."
“Don’t Sherlock.” John pleaded, because he didn’t need Sherlock’s cruelty right now.
. No, they'd become family and their loss was deep. But even through their loss, Sherlock would never forget or regret having Redbeard.
Sherlock broke the kiss to stare down at John with a heated gaze, fangs protruded from his lips as he panted above the beta. John moaned under him, bucking his hips up, his hardening length pressing against Sherlock’s twitching, new-found arousal. Then it was all tongues, hands, and keening for more.
Standing up from the ambulance, Sherlock began his deducing, “The bullet they just dug out of the wall’s from a hand gun. Kill shot over that distance from that kind of a weapon… That’s a crack shot you’re looking for, but not just a marksman; a fighter. His hands couldn’t have shaken at all, so clearly he’s acclimatized to violence. He didn’t fire until I was in immediate danger, though, so strong moral principle. You’re looking for a man probably with a history of military service…”
“I know. I know that now. I just… I spent the night at Lestrade’s to get away, but we never… I could never, Sherlock. I slept in his bed while he took the couch, that’s why I smelled of him.”
"You read my letter?" Sherlock asked stunned.
“Apparently not.” Lestrade snarled and spun on his heel to exit the flat, but then caught sight of John. His eyes scanned over John’s form, taking notice he wore the same clothes he’d worn the night before and raised a questioning brow.
. What?” John fought back the laughter while Sherlock tried to control his own.
The voices were so relentless. Some calmingly supported him as he remained outwardly cool. Others reprimanded him. They wished harm to the alpha. It was so confusing. Sherlock struggled to remain ever present to his conversation with Moriarty, while still waving away the persistent voices that wished harm on John.
John pulled away then and moved to seat himself across from Sherlock and started eating his own meal. Sherlock didn’t eat for a while after; his attention was completely focused on John, considering his behavior.
Whatever he found on John’s face must have kept Sherlock from calling him on the lie and refusing his request, instead Sherlock merely raised an inquiring brow, but gave a nod of acceptance.
Huffing a sharp breath, Sherlock closed his eyes and attempted to claim sleep once more. It took several measured calming breaths and thinking of Mycroft before his arousal dwindled to not and sleep finally claimed him.
The priest smiled at the witnesses and at John, eyed Sherlock wearily, and finished with, “By the power vested in me by Saint Agnes Cathedral and God, I now pronounce you two wed.”
Everything went black.
"Want you to fuck me. Make my omega hole sore and red, soiled." Sherlock shivered, a pleasant wanting chill ran through him. He wanted to taste John, have him fuck and bruise his mouth, but he wanted to be filled again.
John tried to go back to sleep, but then Sherlock’s hand lowered to caringly run over his round belly. John hummed sleepily, the feel of Sherlock’s hand running over his shirt and belly felt wonderful. The softness of John’s cotton shirt gliding delicately over the sensitive skin of his stomach was a pleasant sensation.
"Oh, breed..." Sherlock whimpered, eyes shutting tight, lips parting in a wet exhale, a painful emptiness wracked through him, as if reminding him of what his body needed and he knew.
"Stop patronizing me." Sherlock snipped, when he finally felt his stomach settle.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
, you wouldn't believe how many police officers he's pissed off because of his arrogant brilliance." John laughed and Mary giggled amused.
Lestrade's eyes widened in disbelief, much like the others who were pretending not to be listening but were.
— he didn’t know. He didn’t know anymore.
"He's alive, John. He was on a case, my agents lost track of him and when they found him he'd been stabbed in the chest. I'm sorry. I tried to call you. When you didn't answer I had men go out to get you and you were brought back to London. Sherlock's here, he's awake and-"
John could recall how his parent’s were reluctant in allowing him to continue going to school, especially after his first concussion, but John was adamant he could take care of himself. He couldn’t, but he’d learned how best to cover the cuts and bruises; concussions and broken limps were less easy…
Sherlock kept close to John on their way through the maze, but after several hours passed and John still hadn’t found their way out, he turned to the amused alpha.
Clutching tightly to his cane, attempting to steel himself with resolve, John stared at the cane through the mirror with hate. Hating himself. When John was sent back home invalid, his parents had given him four months to recover before they’d begun to plan his wedding with his intended’s parents. John couldn’t stop them; knowing there was no way out and he’d grown tired of trying to fight the inevitable. He’d been sold long ago and now was the day he’d pay for it.
"Don't touch me!" Sherlock screamed, outraged that the alpha would dare try to comfort him when he was the reason he was suffering so deeply.
Mycroft ended the call and took his empty glass to his in-home bar and poured himself a double of scotch this time. His day just kept getting worse.
was a cruelty which sent John leaping out of his chair and directly at the unprepared alpha.
“But—” John strangled out, voice an octave higher than was natural.
The CCTV videos had shown many unsettling things. John spent the night at another alpha’s home. Sherlock stayed up all night waiting for John’s return. When John returned, Sherlock had hidden in his room.
John heard the dull beeping of a heart monitor, something so familiar and strangely soothing, as its beat was stable. Closed eyes squinted as he came to the full awareness of his body and the throbbing pain of his abdomen grew agonizingly stronger.
"Good?"
“John?” Sherlock’s brows furrowed tensely, making little sense through the ranting of what appeared to be a crazed Mrs. Hudson.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Who do you think you are to come to my place of employment and tell me what to do?” John sneered at the pompously smirking gentleman.
Lesson 3 was a part of the series of the documentary he’d been watching. The same alpha and omega couple were shown once more. Though this time, the documentary spoke more in depth about the omega’s heat cycle. John knew this documentary well, he’d lived it twice, but it was helpful to hear the scientific outlook. When the DVD ended, he paused on the fourth and reread the title again.
“What?” John blanched.
Sherlock stared suspiciously at him for a moment before the clattering of heels neared and both Sherlock and John turned to find Mrs. Holmes entering the living area once more, grinning like a complete nutter.
"I... I'm sorry Victor. I've only ever seen you as a friend.... a great friend. You are a wonderful omega, Victor, and I believe you will find someone who will love you--"
"How many people were you with?"
John smiled up at the sheer concentration marring the beautiful face of his Sherlock, “More, Sher… I can take it.”
"I love you!" John gasped through sobs, burying his head against the neck laying open in reach for him.
The moment his heat fizzed out there had been a knock at his door and Sherlock’s wits having returned to him, knew it was his intrusive, but well meaning brother, Mycroft. He was always watchful of Sherlock. Sherlock knew Mycroft set hidden cameras in his flat and he’d removed them every chance he got, but knew they’d just be replaced by more well hidden ones.
John gripped the back of Sherlock’s cotton shirt, never wanting to let go, never wanting to part from the alpha that possessed his whole heart.
Sherlock ate his breakfast slowly, not really hungry, but knowing it would upset John if he didn’t eat. Still, his eyes wandered to John every so often, brows tensed with bewilderment.
John glanced away from the screen, stared down at the empty spot on the mattress where his husband lay the night before. Biting his bottom lip, his face burning red when the omega keened wantonly, John looked back up at the screen and watched the alpha suck on the mark.
“If I said I wanted to make this marriage work, would you be willing to try again?” Sherlock contemplated aloud.
"Don't." Sherlock cut John off, raising his hand up in a halting manner as he shook his head. "Please stop. Don't talk like this. I'm only your husband in name."
“But… You said -”
John continued to walk, but his heart filled with affection as Sherlock laid on praise.
The car ride was made in complete silence. John was thankful for this and spent the drive staring out the window, seeing but not comprehending. The alpha did the same and John thought if their marriage was spent in stillness, it wouldn’t be all that bad. Sure, every three months he’d have to endure his heat with his alpha, but the rest of his time could be spent like this. During these times John could live his life as if he weren’t married. That was a pleasant thought.
Moriarty’s face twisted into an expression of unhappiness, “
"I read them all." John admitted. "You've become like this because of me."
“Too much history between us, John. Old scores, resentments.”
John growled hungrily, gripping himself tightly, watching Sherlock stoke his belly again when he deduced just how much John liked it.
.” Sherlock said, voice tense, on the verge of sentiment.
He could only wait until he reached his wing of the house before removing the still slightly damp towel from out of his pocket and pressed it up against his nose. Sherlock inhaled the first deep breath of his omega. Sea-green eyes opened wide, Sherlock’s legs buckling slightly under him and he was forced to slap a hand against the wall near him for support. He stilled his movements, removing the cloth from his nose and struggled to calm his suddenly uneven breaths.
“What do you mean?” John asked innocently and it irked Sherlock.
“Don’t listen to those idiots. You are highly valued son. They are jealous of your status.”
They’d been pursuing their criminal when Sherlock slipped on a discarded empty bottle of water and effectively twisted his ankle. John refused Sherlock’s demands for him to catch their criminal. John wouldn’t leave Sherlock — it was a thief and they knew who he was now. Lestrade would have to finish up this case without them.
Victor would not have come if he did not have something to say. He deserved to curse the alpha for what he'd done. John would hear him out. This, he knew, Victor had every right to do.
“I want… I want to…” John couldn’t say it. Sex… It was such a very new thing for them and talking about the lewd desires swimming in his mind was far too much for John.
“You could come covered in pig’s blood and I’d still marry you.”
John knew, even though Sherlock rejected him and refused to share any part of his heart with him, that Sherlock’s omega acknowledged him. If Sherlock’s omega had refused him after the claim bite, Sherlock would have died immediately, but that was extremely rare. Sherlock’s omega was lonely and needed an alpha and John was the perfect partner — an alpha submissive. This knowledge gave John some comfort, but not enough to soothe his aching heart.
Sherlock bit his tongue, squirming uncomfortably in his seat, arousal kindled and growing ever strong.
"Sherlock." The amazement in the alpha's voice did not go unnoticed.
“I feel jealous.” John pouted, mumbling his words against Sherlock’s skin, hands roaming his hips.
Sculpted arms bent back, biceps tightening, firm, so —
“Worthy.” John thought aloud opening his eyes and smiling when Sherlock looked at him with question, “Worthy to be my alpha."
” Mrs. Hudson screeched with both frustration and relief.
John smiled nervously and stepped before Sherlock, hesitating momentarily before wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s waist and leaning in close to his lips.
“No!” Sherlock slammed his hand against a nearby table, and focused on calming his erratic breathing. “That was low, John. That… I told you no intimacy. A bite was all I would allow.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Glaring at the ceiling, Sherlock inhaled a deep breath, held it for several long beats, before exhaling it heavily.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The moment they drove off the Holmes’ estate and began the long winding roads of the countryside, John felt an immediate sense of relief. No more pretenses forcing them to behave in a manner that unsettled them, no more indulging in Mrs. Holmes’ wishes.
“Please.” John was begging now, slowly dragging his thumb along the slit of his cock, catching the droplets of cum sticking to his spout and stroking it over his crown, smearing it lovingly, following Sherlock’s example. “You’re hard enough, please. No more waiting. I need you.”
Victor laughed heartily, amused by the battle of wills being so evidently fought before him and in doing so attracted two pairs of eyes.
” The alpha implored brokenly.
The blurred Sherlock before him nodded his head.
John didn't release him right away. His hands stroked at his back and upper arms, before Sherlock's pulled away slightly, enough so John could look up at him with that ridiculous look. That look that said he needed him. Wanted Sherlock's care as if he deserved it. John deserved to be slapped, but Sherlock held off on that desire, because what he had planned was far worse.
” John felt dampness soak his lashes and Sherlock curled an arm around him, and held him close.
John felt as if he would die from the pleasure that was building, filling him so completely he’d die from the sensory overload. Pleasure was a formidable weapon.
Sherlock began defending Mary to Mycroft, explaining her reasoning for lying, and that with her help they could capture Magnussen, and in return free her from his threats. John couldn't see how Sherlock could do such after Mary had been the one to shoot him and he'd almost lost his alpha again.
“Hmm?”
John didn’t feel happy most times, but this was one of the few times John was truly happy. Ever since their trip two weeks ago, John had been sleeping with Sherlock in the alpha’s room. It was starting to feel like their room once more and John was sure Sherlock cared more for him each passing day.
John paused to glance over to Sherlock’s back and stared on wearily.
“I can save her life if you agree to bond and marry this omega.”
“Yeah, it’s for shock.”
John’s eyes snapped open and he gradually took in his surroundings; he was in a dimly lit hospital room. Lying on his back gave him the freedom to turn his head and observe the dark sky out the window. It had been late at night when they’d met Moriarty, John didn’t think he’d be waking so soon after… A day or so must have passed.
“Hmm? Not sure, I must have lost myself in my mind palace for some time, but when I became aware of my surroundings I was in a cab, heading back to Baker Street.” Sherlock explained, entering the flat and moving to the bedroom.
“No.” Sherlock glanced over to him curiously.
“He’s an omega; too much could send him on another drop.”
“Yeah, but some of the guys want to take photographs.” Lestrade joked.
"Get off the road!" an irate driver screamed from out of his vehicle's window.
“It’s a valid question, brother.” Mycroft reasoned.
Mycroft stared with consideration, eyes softening.
“Bloody hell, that felt good,” Sherlock said to no one, staring in a daze up at the ceiling, feeling all kinds of right just lying in his bed. His cock, stomach and thighs were covered in a thick layer of cum.
Eventually, Sherlock would warm up to John again, realize he was just being sensitive and taking his frustration out on John because he loved Sherlock enough to allow his omega to vent it all on him.
"No. I guess not."
The view was amazing as it looked out the three visage points of the yard and outer lands. The full moon shone brightly through and casted a blue glow outside.
Sherlock suffered. The years he spent without John fighting Moriarty's network, distroying it, had left him scarred. He'd been just short of ruined when he returned to find John with someone to love.
"How's married life treating you? Seen the magazines. You two look like the perfect couple. Going on dates after a case, celebrating your accomplishments, flaunting it to the whole world." Victor mocked.
“I could carry you?” John offered, and bit back a laugh at the look Sherlock sent him.
John was a horrid liar, but nevertheless, he tried, “Yes. Yes, must have been, through that window.”
He wished he could do everything to please Sherlock, but it seemed that he couldn't even give Sherlock the status of his husband, first and only mate, because of his choices of the past. He could legally divorce Mary, yes, but not now. She was pregnant and she needed their bond to carry their child safely. It wasn't that he would never divorce her. He'd need to help Mary through her pregnancy and after she'd had some time to adjust, they would divorce. It wouldn't be a surprise for the beta. They'd talked about it before and she knew John wouldn't break their bond until after she gave birth. It was the best he could offer her.
"Sl-Slow." Sherlock panted, throwing his head back onto the pillow, fisting at the sheets, knees parting wider, hips rising to meet the alpha's strokes.
“What would you like? My
Next time I’ll make an appointment at the clinic to save you the time coming home and handling me.”
Sherlock pursed his lips unimpressed when the alpha snarled a feral cry. John might be impressive for an alpha submissive, but he wasn’t different from any other alpha. They were all animalistic in their mating and though he’d never feel it, Sherlock knew John would be so if they ever spent a heat together.
“Thank you.” John said, appreciative.
large pregnant omega.
” Sherlock repeated dumbfounded.
John’s life had once been simple, yet now he found himself living in lies, lies for his sister Harry, lies for his husband Sherlock. Lies he himself had to live. It was all so hard to handle, given, John prided himself on being an honest person and now, he lived in the guilt of his lies and fear of being discovered.
John laughed deeply, it vibrated against his chest and pleasantly against Sherlock's own.
That wasn't how he planned on confessing. He wanted to wine and dine John. Romance him slowly. Although music played in the background, his deliverance was lacking the finesse he'd imagined in his head. But there it was. His stupid mouth and hormones too impatient to make grand gestures and romance John into his confession.
“I am calm!” Sherlock sniped; spinning around to glare down at John, but immediately after, Sherlock was rushing to his side guiltily and taking hold of his hand.
John felt as if he'd been punched in the gut. Why? Mary? John felt sick. Sherlock thought... How could Sherlock think him to be unfaithful? He'd never... Even now, knowing Sherlock had lied to him, there was no way he'd betray their bond. Sherlock had betrayed their bond with his lies and that was why John was so angry and hurt, but even with his betrayal, John couldn't...
Sherlock’s girth swelled passed what John thought he could handle and it seemed to only be growing all the more. It first came as a dull throbbing, but several moments later the throbbing became prominent, the stretching of his walls felt all too much to handle, it burned, searing and yet, John’s omega needed this, needed it so much more than anything else.
“It’s not a choice.”
Before Jean, he’d only been in three other relationships, and those weren’t anything that lasted more than six months. The first was in high school, Brittany Walsh. She was too gentle for Gregory’s taste and after two months of dating, he’d ended things. Then there was Amy Jones. He met her in his freshman year of college, she was beautiful and popular. His friends pushed him into going out with her as she’d shown an interest in him. She was an intelligent woman and Gregory found that he enjoyed their talks. Her views on life and current world issues were fascinating and they could talk for hours. He’d lost his virginity to her and he was happy for a time, but slowly realized he saw her as a close friend rather than a future mate. They broke up after six months. Maria Hernandez was technically his rebound, but out of guilt and shame for using her to get over the funk of breaking up with Amy, Gregory dated her for three months.
John didn’t raise his gaze to meet Sherlock’s. Not sure what he’d find in those cold, unfeeling eyes. Several long moments passed in silence and John refused to raise his head. He was done trying. Done being hurt. Done seeing Sherlock pull away anymore.
"I want to come in your mouth. Will you swallow? I would swallow your seed."
Swallowing loudly, Sherlock glided one of his hands to John's neck again, and subtly took John's erratic pulse. Noticed the flush growing to fill his face. Then he watched fascinated as John's intense blue turned to thin slivers, his pupils dilating as he leaned just a fraction closer to Sherlock. His face tilted up invitingly.
When John finished cleaning up the mess in the kitchen he entered their room, body tense, and warily glanced over to Sherlock who was now laying in bed, tattered towel resting on the alpha’s nightstand. John quietly moved about the room, collecting his nightwear before entering the bathroom and showering. When he finished readying himself for bed, he wordlessly slipped under the sheets and curled up into a tight ball, wrapping the comforter around his form.
He was so happy. Drunk on sex and grinning from ear to ear.
Gregory laughed heartily, pressing another kiss to Mycroft's hand before placing it to palm his own cheek.
“Can I see him? I can bring my toys with me so we can play?” John merrily pleaded.
“Many blessings my dears!” Mrs. Holmes blubbered, crying into Mr. Holmes’ shoulder.
Sherlock's blush deepened, but he felt no shame for desiring his alpha's body, preferably his lovely cock.
“The next time Gregory Lestrade leaves his flat, terminate the surveillance.”
." John pleaded.
When they entered, a cluster of people were bustling about the room, chatting to one another. Sherlock walked over to DI Lestrade and the older man glanced over to John in question.
“He calls himself a consulting detective. He made it up.” Mycroft huffed the last part.
“No you don’t. It’s the heat. It’s making you—”
“You care. You care more than you like to admit. I know you care, John. I see it in your eyes. You like me still.”
John couldn't believe what he was hearing. The things Sherlock was asking of him, no alpha should be asked to endure. If any alpha had experienced such as recompense for their crime of marrying another, those alphas never spoke of it, for it was a deep shame for an alpha. John
Sherlock’s lips parted with surprise and he gawked at John as he pulled away to seat himself at the table.
There were also the times John would bring him tea and biscuits while Sherlock worked on a case or his experiments. His omega wanted to roll over and expose its underbelly to his alpha, submit to its provider. John would be a wonderful provider as he made all their meals and always pushed Sherlock to eat. Sherlock yet again struggled with his inner-self, unable, unwilling to bend.
Releasing a pained holler of grief, John cried out, “
Sherlock gave in to the darkness that swallowed him up whole, but not before he heard the alpha belt out a wounded cry.
"Taste so good. John." Sherlock keened, sloppily giving kitten licks to that round bulbous head and hungrily swallowing away John's pre-come.
Arousal kindled, his cock throbbing and highly sensitive. When John shifted slightly in the bed, his cock jolted from the tight confinements of his pants and his ass cheeks slid against each other wetly. John moaned a mixture of pleasure and pain. Even such a little friction as that was still felt too much to withstand, and yet his anal hole needed more.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
A doctor and a handful of nurses were rushing to his side now, the EMT’s were delivering his stats and condition and John knew it wasn’t good. He was a doctor, he knew the risks and outcomes of such a case, but he still had to try.
"You're hornier than the most horniest of teenagers, do you know that, Sherlock?" John mumbled, wrapping his arms around Sherlock's waist and drawing him against his chest.
“With you, I can do this.” John murmured and Sherlock turned his head to meet John’s gaze then.
John’s eyes welled with tears, emotions running on a high through heat. Yet... John’s omega needed to get out all the feelings he'd kept within.
John was seated at the kitchen table staring down at the baked rosemary chicken, homemade mashed potatoes, greens, and tomato salad he’d prepared for Sherlock and grimaced. When had John ever put so much thought in preparing meals for his friends? Never. Still… He never lived with his other friends. This was just…being civil. No underlining thoughts or feelings with such actions.
"Give me pups." Sherlock cooed sweetly, hands moving to stroke John's muscular back, feeling the slick glide of sweat.
"Er, no, no, no. They were just leaving," Sherlock shot out.
" John asked of the omega, the moment he realized Sherlock had entered the room.
“Molly isn’t my mistress. She works at the morgue and I met with her today because of a case.” Sherlock said with a smile on his face and leaning in close to inhale John’s intoxicating scent.
"You want to... With them on?"
“And proving a point.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, shifted his feet, and glared murderously at John for a long time. When John’s eyes remained open, vulnerable and insistent, Sherlock exhaled a long breath and flicked his hand in the priest’s direction, giving an evasive gesture that the priest could continue his speech.
fine.”
. You're not like them, Sherlock. It really would be a shame to end you, but I'm going to have to if you keep getting in my way."
“Calm down.”
“Sher...” John shuddered violently at the thought of Sherlock leaning in and pressing their lips together.
for me, but only at my flat. I refuse to live in that house, much less see that beta."
John smiled as he pushed open the alpha’s silk blue robe and sat himself on Sherlock’s long, hard cock and rode him, wild, unbidden and zealously. Sherlock squirmed under him, head thrashing against the pillow, broken pleading whimpers ripping past thin pale parted lips.
“Sherlock told me.” Mrs. Hudson answered, already moving about the home, cleaning it up as much as she could, but the place was a right mess.
, there would have been a possibility that I might have been able to persuade Sherlock on holding back. It is far easier to control a young alpha than it is a fully grown and matured one.”
“Sherlock.” John’s stomach lurched with nerves.
“Mrs. Hudson?” Sherlock quizzed, taken aback she would be calling him at such an hour, “What’s the matter?”
“Slow down.” John called as Sherlock broke into a jog.
Sherlock remained still and John stared off behind the alpha to the open door where he knew the D.I. was waiting down the stairs.
“Sherlock.” John sighed softly; this wasn’t appropriate behavior, but Sherlock wasn’t socially appt to appropriateness.
“Such a sweet omega.”
Clanging his fork against his plate, Sherlock's posture straightened in preparation, and he voiced his dissatisfaction in his demand, "Alright, tell me what's wrong?"
"Touch yourself, soldier. Jerk yourself off like a little bitch desperate for release." Sherlock cooed softly, almost lovingly.
” Sherlock paused, exhaled a heavy breath and palmed his face.
"I don't care. I never wanted perfect. I want you, flaws and all."
“It’s okay. You’re safe.”
Sherlock wanted more. He wanted to taste John, not himself. Breaking their kiss, Sherlock peppered several messy ones to John's cheek and jaw, before laying himself back onto the bed, feeling comfortable where he was.
"I did!" John exclaimed, catching sight of the jar before Sherlock could hide it, and sudden understanding flooded through.
Shutting his eyes and mind of contradicting thoughts, Sherlock blindly leaned forward and pressed his lips firmly against the corner of John's mouth. Pressed there for several long moments, Sherlock felt his own heart give to pounding in his chest, his body vibrating with nerves, before he broke away and leaned back to stare up at the shocked alpha.
Sherlock glared at the sympathy in his husband's eyes and he felt far more pathetic.
Sherlock angrily wiped his eyes dry, and caught the scent of alpha permeating his hand from where the alpha had held it. Drawing it away from his marked face, Sherlock contradicted the turmoil within and wrapped his arm around the alpha's waist, taking hold of one of John's hands and shuffling himself up close to the man's back. Close enough so that he could nuzzle the nape of the alpha's neck and inhale his calming scent. John didn't rouse awake, simply hummed sleepily and slipped further in the fog of slumber.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“As your second.”
Mycroft smiled and nodded.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“I’m happy…” John breathed weakly, tears brimming the lids of his eyes, “but I can’t accept what I’ve done to you.”
“Sherlock.” John growled, the alpha within displeased his omega thought him disloyal. John was a faithful alpha submissive. So what if Sherlock’s friend — peer — whatever, was attractive, John wasn’t attracted to him in the least bit. John found Sherlock the most beautiful of anyone and that was what mattered.
“Sod off, you—” Sherlock halted, his words fell away as his nostrils flared and he snapped his cold gaze in John’s direction, a look of pure and utter disbelief marring his features.
When they’d finished breakfast, John took their plates and began cleaning up while Sherlock prepared some tea. When the tea was finished, John assisted Sherlock in pouring their cups and even preparing Sherlock’s tea the way he liked it.
Grinning toothily, Sherlock hesitantly moved and brushed the snow scattered in John’s hair off. John smiled thankfully and wordlessly did the same for Sherlock. When there was no snow left, Sherlock’s eyes drifted down to John’s lips.
“You can’t. You’ve already agreed to work the case. Lestrade needs you.” John smiled weakly.
“What in the bloody hell was
got out of their lives. Sherlock could not do for John's pain and grief at losing his children.
“Right now… I hate you.” John whispered, voice sore, his shaky hands taking hold of Sherlock’s hands and removed them from his face.
Omegas were fiercely monogamous and only mated once. Sherlock was his mate and there would never be anyone else for John, but Sherlock was an alpha. Alphas didn’t just mate with
“An arrangement.” Sherlock repeated, obviously disliking the phrase.
“What if I spoke to Sherlock?”
John stared numbly at his alpha's outstretched hand and raised his own to grab hold of it.
Sherlock hopped off the couch and hurriedly grabbed his mother’s arm, pulling her up.
Their first night, they'd arrived at Sherlock’s—their flat. Sherlock had given him a brief tour, ending with John’s bedroom. It was already furnished. Sometime during their wedding, Mycroft had movers transport all of John’s belongings, placing them within the room. Apparently, Mycroft knew Sherlock well enough to know John wouldn’t be living a married life with his husband.
“Exactly what you’re thinking.”
"I told your mother we made plans to shop together for our pups, she won't take you shopping. Now, would you please get out of the bathroom and go talk with her?" John laughed happily on his end.
“It’s not hard to guess the common denominator, is it?”
It took his parents another year and a half of arguing and reasoning with one another until they’d agreed upon a future bond mate for John. One night as John prepared himself for bed; his parents came to tuck him in and began to tell him about his promised alpha bond mate.
“Mmm—Sherlock.” John pled, shivering with want, his cock pulsing and swelled.
Sherlock looked away from the dead body to flash a withering glare at the sniveling excuse for a man. How that man had been born an alpha was a mystery.
“You smell so good.” Sherlock huskily admired, nuzzling the trail of dark hair leading south and nosed deep in a thatch of pubic hair, breathing in perceptibly.
"No... You aren't." Sherlock sighed heavily.
“We’re almost there!”
“Molly.” Molly interrupted.
, I have claimed you as my mate. I meant it when I said I would cherish you.” Sherlock’s words sounded close… Too close.
“Get on with it.” Sherlock rushed.
"A case. I need a case." Sherlock told himself - or the voices, he was unsure. Maybe both. It had been so long since he'd worked a case.
Mycroft's lips pursed in a way that gave Sherlock the impression he wanted to say something, but after a brief pause the gentleman looked away. Sherlock interpreted it as Mycroft's acknowledgment of his words.
John gave a weak smile, "I agree, meeting you, it has been one of the best things that could have happened and you've helped me so much Marry. I thank you for that, but-"
John stared in wonder up into those beautiful eyes of his Sherlock. Unlike the silver blue they’d been at dinner the night before, they were clouded cobalt, so warm and murky all at once and
"I'm not angry with you." Sherlock announced, slipping on a pair of pants, realizing he smelled of sex and stale heat, but that didn't matter right now. He was going to kill Mycroft. A shower was not important, as it did nothing to progress the reality that he would strangle that pompous prick to death.
As John recalled these last three days he’d spent with Sherlock, he smiled fondly. Sherlock wasn’t one for enjoying lying about and doing nothing of significance, but he’d done so to please John. This had to mean Sherlock was growing attached to John, and there were some feelings there. John didn’t think Sherlock loved him yet, but he appreciated his assistance when working and he seemed to care about John’s feelings.
“Not the back, you might break the tree of the saddle. Grab the reins and the pommel; use them to lift yourself up.” Sherlock recommended.
“Bend low and bare down.” The alpha finally spoke, voice hoarse, thick with want.
"Yes, love."
"What's wrong?" John cooed sweetly, petting his damp silky hair.
“I promised I’d grant you one
"Such a minx. I want to shut that mouth up." John's lips trailed around Sherlock's neck, along the curve of his jaw, near his chin and ever closer to his lips.
"I want sexy time with you, John."
How would that work when you’re pregnant with my pups?”
“I…” John began lowering his eyes almost guiltily. “There is something I must confess to you. I haven’t been honest with you, Sherlock.”
John choked on his tea mid-sip.
before registering for me. You impregnated that witch with what should have been
“You like Victor Trevor?” Sherlock meant to ask, but his question came out more of an accusation and it startled him that his voice was set in a deadly tone, one he’d only used when deeply incensed with Mycroft.
Sentiment was a foreign matter to Sherlock. He knew this, but he also knew that what he felt for John was far more sentimental than anything he'd ever felt for anyone. Sherlock didn't want to place the name of what this was out loud; it felt too brittle to voice. As if... If he were to say it, his whole world would crumble to pieces, because he'd lived a life of science, not... debilitating sentiment such as this.
“Yes, John. You do look rather flushed.” Sherlock repeated Mycroft’s observation, a sly grin on his face, goading the omega.
“I can’t help it. My kind… Our lives have been chosen for us.” John smiled sadly, not knowing why he was opening himself up
So Sherlock left. He’d left to give John the peace he much desired and to protect himself from the ever constant rejection. Even so, Sherlock missed John. He missed him so much and felt himself desiring the numbing peacefulness he’d once used to endure John’s absence when he’d been in the army. It was a secret he’d kept from John. His parents and Mycroft had tried breaking him of his habits, but after two years of John’s second tour, Sherlock slipped into the usage of drugs, whatever he could get his hands on he did, heroin being his first drug of choice though, and it’d helped for a time.
"You sick little fuck!" the alpha raged, moving to straddle Sherlock's waist. He took hold of his collar, raising him up halfway to meet his punches.
John raised his hand up and took hold of Sherlock’s left hand, lowering it to rest over his own head and Sherlock’s once tensed features relaxed. John was horrible. He’d left Sherlock in a rather vulnerable position for an alpha and that wasn’t right.
“John!” Came the familiar call of his name.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Eventually, John moved under the covers and turned to face Sherlock’s back, and for long moments in time he just stared. Sherlock never moved, he remained still, his breathing regular and John knew he was awake, but refused to converse with him and it pained John. Sherlock held no desire to know him. He had no care for John and it was destroying his heart to see this.
John set his half eaten apple onto the table, exhaled a trembling breath and looked back up at the expectant gaze of the alpha.
Sherlock staggered on unsteady legs to the sofa where he collapsed heavily upon it, and dug his phone out of his pocket with his free hand. Sherlock's trembling hand dialed for help.
“John!”
“Lay diagonally. I want to see.
A warm hand took hold of Sherlock’s and gripped tight, even when Sherlock tensed and stared at their joined hands, never looking away from them.
“No.” John couldn’t believe it. Not Sherlock. No. Not someone so intelligent. Not his alpha.
“Sorry?” Lestrade was at a complete loss.
Sherlock’s lips pursed and he nodded his head in confirmation.
“Aw, just like your mummy.” Mrs. Holmes giggled.
John looked up to see distress in the alpha’s eyes and lowered his phone onto the table.
John was Sherlock’s omega, his husband. It was one of the many duties he’d taken on at their union to take care of his husband. Taking care of John now, meant more physical requirements of him, but he was willing to provide for him. Making John happy made him happy and if John wanted him, then Sherlock would give him what he needed.
John sighed heavily, raised a hand to comb through his disheveled hair he’d spent tussling while drinking with Harry.
Lestrade turned, and only then did the gentleman take notice of the D.I.’s state. Scratches marked Lestrade’s face, neck, and hands. The worst were along the left side of his neck. The silver haired man’s shirt was a tattered mess and stained with his blood.
“Mm.”
“I only care about you and our pups.” Sherlock answered sincerely, surprising John with the softness and conviction of his words.
“Yes, but he is your husband now.”
John's back was facing the camera's eye, so those who'd view this video couldn't see the pain and sadness in those blue eyes.
“Hang on; you were saying, ‘Sorry’ a minute ago. Don’t spoil it. Go on: what have I done that’s so bloody stimulating?” John smiled honestly then, this Sherlock was kinder, more acceptable, John never wanted that savage Sherlock again.
Time… Everyone said all John would need was time and things would get better… easier. It didn’t. John struggled to maintain his weight, losing more than was healthy. The doctors Mycroft sent him to weekly were never pleased with his efforts - apparently they weren’t good enough. John hardly slept at night, he’d be lucky to have four hours of undisturbed sleep. Maybe it would have been easier if he hadn’t been there… hadn’t seen it with his own eyes. But he was and he did. Because of it he had nightmares, almost daily, and that horrifying sight would forever haunt him. Time… Time would not heal these wounds.
John's eyes fluttered closed, his breathing scarce as Sherlock nuzzled his brow and audibly inhaled his scent. John knew it was an act, but his alpha wouldn't accept it, so desperate for a mate such as this one willingly displayed before him. His alpha wanted nothing more than to embrace the omega and show him just how loved he could be, if only Sherlock would let him.
John’s breath stilled in his chest, unable to breathe when hearing such a familiar, hauntingly beautiful voice.
Staring at Sherlock as he raised his head and stared at him with a look of loss, John felt his heart give way to care. Because Sherlock's eyes never looked as vulnerable as they did now.
"No, I didn't. It was just sex. It meant nothing. They meant nothing to me. I don't think about them, all I want is to start a life with you. Sherlock, please let go of the past. Let me love you."
When Sherlock came to a sudden halt, John actually began to take in the room they’d entered. The walls of the three corners of the room were absent and in its place were large windows. The only wall was behind them leading out and back down the north wing.
John indulged in affectionate touches, nothing too extreme, not wishing to push Sherlock away, but enough so that Sherlock never questioned John’s sincerity. Things such as sitting close beside Sherlock, laying his hand over Sherlock’s, leaning over Sherlock’s chair as the alpha focused on his experiments and pressing a kiss to his brow, standing in Sherlock’s personal space when the alpha surveyed a crime scene, brushing his hand over Sherlock’s arm when the alpha retreated within his mind palace to organize his thoughts and seek out important information.
His parents reassured him that his omega wanted this arrangement and that he wanted to marry and mate with him, and Sherlock was desperate to believe them and so he did. During the time John was on tour Sherlock dedicated himself to his studies.
Today was no different. Mycroft reclined back in his leather chair at his desk, palming his shut mouth with his hand as he watched Gregory reading an open file placed in front of his own desk. The DI’s eyes were heavy with sleep, but he stubbornly blinked them with purpose, attempting to remain awake. Gregory spent another forty minutes reviewing the case file, jotting down notes and researching things in relation to it on his laptop before finally calling it a night and putting everything away.
“Feel better?”
"Not when you call me a
Sherlock wordlessly forked a piece of his own cake and offered it up to the alpha. Watching calculatingly as John stared at his raised fork, then met his gaze, holding it as he took the mouthful of cake. The flash of a pink tongue swiped the bottom of the fork and flicked up at the end, jerking Sherlock’s hand slightly.
I would try to convince you, but everything I have to say has already crossed your mind.” Moriarty said, reentering the room.
Sherlock mumbled out indistinct words of aggravation when one hand loosened its grip on the bottle of the alcohol and sent some of its contents spilling into the sink.
Sherlock was married now. John winced at the reminder. Sherlock had married that omega… bedded her… Was probably living at Baker Street with her now. Sherlock must want him as his second if he’d gone through the trouble of tracking him down. Worthy to be Sherlock’s second, but not worthy enough to be his mate?
.” Mycroft warned.
“No.” John hurriedly wiped a stray tear and inhaled sharply.
“He’s arrived!” Mrs. Holmes giggled cheerily, standing from her seat, and rushing for the door.
." John whimpered piercingly and that sound, the pain, joy, and love circulating the utterance of his name tugged at his heart.
“You know what.”
John waited for an answer, but Sherlock said nothing. His eyes breaking away from John’s seeking ones and when Sherlock stepped away to sit in the chair beside the bed, John felt his worries double. He gave Sherlock another long moment to collect his words, but when a flash of pain filled those pale eyes and they didn’t dare meet his, John felt his patience wane.
The love John had for Sherlock could not be housed within. Something this powerful overwhelmed him. A love like this lasted for ages. A love like this only existed in romance novels, because no one in real life could possibly feel this strongly about another individual, but John did. John truly felt this devastatingly intense love for Sherlock, a love that verged on painful, because it was just too much to take, too much to own, but he did. He had to, because without it, he’d be lost.
, John thought to himself and then noticed a thin layer of dark hair that led from the alpha’s navel to a thick patch of pubic hair and lying in the thatch of hair was a porno worthy cock, beautifully flushed, deep red at the circumcised head. Sherlock’s cock was extensive and fat, dauntingly so. Sherlock was engorged, teasing John cruelly so. Seeing such a beautiful alpha cock made his hole constrict around hollowness, needing it, needing to be filled. It would be heaven to have it in him. So
John should have felt relief when he drifted off to sleep as the sun rose, but all he’d felt was forsaken. The pained soft whimpers that broke through clenched teeth as he forced himself to sleep were little comfort.
The stale scent of heat jogged his memory that he'd started his cycle soon after John left to meet with that ridiculous omega. Then... What happened?
John refused to release Sherlock’s hair from his grasp and fondly stroked the alpha’s scalp, feather-light hair tickling his fingers each stroke he made. His other hand trailed at the nape of his neck, fiddling with the short hair that was there as he stared up into beautiful blue depths with such care.
" John's love was so thickly laced in his words, in the tenderness of his smile, there could be no doubt that love Sherlock, John did.
John didn’t want him. Sherlock didn’t like the fact NSY would know of their true relationship. He worried about how they would respond. It was no secret that although they appreciated his talents of deduction, they weren’t friendly. Sherlock stressed over how they would treat John because of Sherlock’s relationship with them. Would they be judgmental because John was an omega and Sherlock’s husband? Would they say hurtful things and further destroy his fragile omega? John was physically strong, even mentally so, but not where his status was concerned. It was clear that John hated his status, felt helpless because of his identity as a Captain and omega, and he was suffering from an identity crisis.
John never broke eye contact with Sherlock as he pressed their chests together, but still it wasn’t enough for his love because he husked, “Closer.”
“Your smell like… I can smell….
Mycroft inhaled a deep breath, preparing to make his argument, but John cut him off the moment his lips parted in the starting of speech.
“I must recommend this nanotechnology bathtub. It has the best thermal ability of all the other brands out there.”
Sherlock ate little, but John didn't let that disturb him, having grown used to Sherlock's lack of a normal appetite. John enjoyed his food. Even going as far as making soft noises of pleasure when taking bites of his food. Complimenting the abilities of the cook who'd made their meal.
“You need to get it out.” Ella explained what was so obvious, but something that seemed terribly difficult.
John's stare didn't waver from his own. Sherlock's heart thudded against his chest loudly, his veins strumming with feeling.
"Don't what?" John deviously asked and Sherlock's eyes flashed open to glare down at him.
“This is Angelo.” Sherlock jumped in.
“Goodbye, John.” There was finality in Sherlock’s voice and John’s heart throbbed painfully. Sherlock’s couldn’t.
John smiled up at Sherlock as the taller man shifted and sat himself on John’s thighs and began to touch himself once more. John stared up at Sherlock watching with fascination as Sherlock’s chest rose and fell with every sharp inhale and exhale he made, a choked strained whine lodged in the back of his throat as his strokes became rapid and frantic.
Sherlock snarled angrily, suddenly fueled with rage, the omega leapt out of the bed and hurriedly entered his closet and looked for something to wear.
“Not really, John’s scent is affecting my alpha instincts.” Harry palmed her forehead, wiping the sweat from her brow, breathing heavily.
“Oh Christ.” John gasped, his legs shaky and no longer able to support his own weight. John collapsed to the ground, pressing his back against the wall and taking in deep breaths.
“Please hurry, Sherlock. I’m drunk and horny. I couldn’t help but think about you on the cab ride back. About our first time together, about your arms around by body, the way you touched me, our first kiss—
“Oh no, please. You've got the rest of your life.” Sherlock answered derisively.
“—Ave ur hups.”
“But your family...”
John stared on grimly as Sherlock shouted, “Put those back!”
~~~~~~~~~~~~
John had thought about what it would be like when he finally returned home, how his alpha would treat him, and he spent many nights up worrying over such things. He never expected for things to turn out this way. Returning home an invalid caused him to become more pessimistic. John didn’t know Sherlock like he knew his comrades.
Mycroft inhaled deeply and threw Sherlock a look.
John just continued to smile sadly down at Sherlock and briefly massaged his scalp, before removing his hand from out of Sherlock’s hair and kneeling beside him.
Sherlock immediately left the crime scene, ignoring Lestrade's calls for him to come back. Instead of focusing on the case, Sherlock went home, sat in his chair and waited for John's return. John came home at 11:15PM and when Sherlock asked how his time with Lestrade had gone, John smiled widely and said it was good.
Sherlock said nothing, but the hurt flashing in his pale gray eyes confused John.
“What word?” Sherlock’s lips grazed the shell of John’s ear and John bit back the whimper that wanted so much to be released—damn his omega side, he wasn’t going to let Sherlock trick his omega into keening like a wanton bitch in heat.
Sherlock had never, not even once, felt attracted to another individual. His sexual drive had only ever been spurred by John. Before he’d scented John through the towel he’d stolen, he’d thought something was wrong with him. John…
“Hello. I’m sorry for not introducing myself properly. I’m Victor Trevor-”  Victor stuck out his hand for John. “—Sherlock’s friend from Uni.”
"Okay." John chuckled breathlessly and grasped a hold of himself with one hand while his other held the back end of pink panties wide enough to make room and then the bulbous head of his cock was pressing into his entrance.
“You’re perplexing John. Has anyone ever told you that?” Sherlock mused, a faint grin tugging at the corners of his lips.
John suddenly thought of one person that would cause Sherlock’s hesitation.
” Sherlock shouted, hands snapping out and gripping to his arms as John felt himself sway.
John used to tell himself that wasn’t true, because why would Sherlock knot him, why would Sherlock never date or sleep with someone else, why would they both commit themselves to this arrangement for three years and reject every flirtatious man or woman to cross their paths if this was just simply a friends with benefits arrangement?
, John was going to barf.
“Please. Sherlock.”
.” John stuttered frailly, eyes blurring with unshed tears.
There… laying on his bed was his omega. John rested on his stomach, bed sheets drawn back to his hips, his head twisted so that John faced him. John was flushed, sweat layered thickly over the skin that was exposed. But what surprised Sherlock the most was that John’s dark blue eyes were glassy, unfocused, and full of tears. John whimpered a desperate sob, tears breaking and falling, mixing with beads of sweat.
John said nothing, directing his stare to the table; he mulishly sipped at his water, refraining from speaking
“Oh, right. Do you have a boyfriend?”
“I think you need to sleep.” Sherlock observed after a lengthy silence.
…” John felt his anger rising as he spoke and stopped himself before cursing his husband, knowing that this was his alpha’s brother he was talking to. No matter the sibling rivalry that might be there, the two were family, and he knew how much alpha’s valued kin.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and continued to eat his fruit while their hands under the table battled.
“You heard me.” Lestrade cooed sweetly and Mycroft remained voiceless.
.” John’s voice broke at the last of his statements and he cursed himself for how hurt he’d sounded.
Why on earth would the alpha submissive still want to marry Sherlock after he’d made the terms of their marriage clear? John should have refused. Laughed in Sherlock’s face and wished him luck on finding an alpha that would agree to an absurd marriage. John should have called the wedding off.
"I know." Sherlock knew well enough John found it hard expressing his feelings.
“Shhh, John. I told you, this isn’t your fault. This was my decision. I don’t regret it, John. I swear, I don’t. It’s… It’s going to be different, but I will grow accustomed to it.”
"Mm." Mycroft trembled against him.
“Stay by my side and you’ll have given me all I could ever dream of.”
Sherlock swallowed audibly as he rested a hand over John’s jerking hip and stilled his movements.
.” Ella breathed sensitively. “Have you talked with him about it?”
The doctor handed over a binder containing the agreement in which gave him permission to terminate the pregnancy, essentially removing their pups in order to save John’s life.
“Why are you still up?” Sherlock called to John as the omega mutely followed after him to the bedroom.
“You won’t take it, seriously Sherlock?” Lestrade answered, baffled.
, Sherlock couldn’t forget gorgeous. It was very important. He watched with interest and excitement as John won his team point after point—he knew that much at least. When the crowd surrounding him sat up and roared in triumph, Sherlock realized that John’s team won the game.
“Who is she?” John graveled.
A marriage that wasn’t a marriage? John didn’t like the terms of which Sherlock was forcing on him. John wanted to bond, to mate and love his omega. To be bound to an omega that didn’t want him was a cruelty unmatched by anything else. John wanted to refuse, but then an image flashed in his mind’s eyes.
“Not exactly… I’d gathered information about them before, but seeing them in person… It made things ever clear. I knew it was love, because I couldn’t see myself being without them. Love… To me, love means you can only be yourself when you’re with them, because they make you whole.”
“I don’t need a second.” Sherlock answered promptly, features void of any emotion.
“None of which is your concern.” Sherlock leaned closer to the table and John was reminded of an animal going in for the kill, “He’s my husband.”
“No.” John whispered hoarsely, but the wobble of his chin told Ella all she needed to know.
“I’ve been searching for you this whole time. God, John, why didn’t you talk to me?”
“Naughty.” Sherlock rumbled against John’s mouth, nipping at his lips with insistency.
"You're not dreaming. I love you, John. I've loved you for a long time, but I was just too stubborn to admit it to myself. It... It's terrifying, but unbelievably thrilling to say it. I know you love me, and I just wanted to confirm that I love-"
Ignoring Sherlock’s obstinacy, John stepped to Sherlock’s side and took hold of the bottle of alcohol and cotton ball.
, Sherlock wasn’t a barbarian. He’d first drag John to his home before bonding.
“Come closer.” Sherlock repeated himself, a twinkle in his pale blue eyes.
Sherlock could still hear John's footsteps outside of his bedroom door, and he himself couldn't lay himself in bed, no matter how many times the nurses urged him to rest and wait. Sherlock paced the room thinking, stroking his belly and contemplating everything. All that had happened and what was to happen now.
“John.”
“John, dear!” John recognized the voice as Mrs. Holmes and the woman bounded down the steps of her home to reach him.
Sherlock nodded unsteadily, releasing himself and grabbing the bottle to squirt more lubrication, this time on his fingers, before setting the bottle on the mattress and shifting closer to John.
John reluctantly woke at one in the afternoon and slowly slipped out of the bed where he then enjoyed a hot shower, his skin stinging slightly from the heat of the water and his head felt light from the steam building. John exited the shower and slipped on a pair of loose gray sweats and a plain brown shirt before padding his way to the kitchen and preparing himself a hot cup of tea and two slices of toast.
“It’s going to rain.” John bitterly thought. His last day with Sherlock and it was going to bloody rain, how very poetic. John bitterly laughed at his pathetic life.
“Go.” John spoke gently, wondering if Sherlock needed more support on his part, and willingly giving it.
“Stop saying weird stuff.”
Sherlock spent hours —
“So what were we doing there?”
John thought about it and tried not to laugh. The smile he endeavored to frown away fought its way through. “They’d think, ‘They’re completely daft’—or something like that.”
Mycroft scented the alpha's dissatisfaction, it was bitter to his senses. So much so, Mycroft needed to right it if he wanted to get back his sleep.
“You can’t bond a beta man, Sherlock. You need pups!” Mrs. Holmes protested the absurdity of Sherlock’s intentions.
Mycroft sat at his desk, his mouth parted in voiceless wonder, brows furrowed in confusion, unable to understand the alpha's reaction. Upset, he'd expected, but not this.
"It could be a girl." John cut in.
"What happened?” Mycroft demanded.
“Sherlock!” Mrs. Hudson sniveled noisily.
It was later that evening when Mrs. Hudson came with dinner made and waiting for him in the kitchen. She knew better than to enter the room where John dwelled. An omega wasn’t territorial with most things, but they were most certainly territorial with their pups and with their alpha’s—John… had no alpha, but he still had their den and that was off limits.
“Okay?” John whispered on edge, not sure what Sherlock was consenting to, but his senses told him it was nothing good.
Silver blue met oceanic blue and John quickly broke their stare to focus on their task, cutting the cake. More cheering erupted, followed by flashing lights of cameras as they sliced two pieces of cake and set them out onto separate plates already placed before them.
“Ooh, did I hit a sore spot?” Irene smirked arrogantly and crossed her legs, revealing smooth pale skin.
Sherlock waited and watched as John's features turned tense with frustration and a helplessness that made something within Sherlock churn sickeningly. Swallowing back the sense of unease, Sherlock pulled through. He would not give in to his inner omega's need to stop, to comfort the alpha that was quickly turning pale.
to stop this from happening, but John couldn’t. He was so enthralled by the alpha’s scent, it made everything spin.
His omega rejected his wish to pull away and countered those feelings by letting go of the alpha’s hand to instead wrap an arm around Sherlock’s back, drawing him ever close.
One month and two weeks had passed, and in that time John became all the more conflicted. Each day that came and went, was another day in which he’d spent taken aback by Sherlock’s startling kindness. Every morning John woke alone, met Sherlock for breakfast, and then the alpha would give him his space for several hours. What Sherlock did during that time was beyond him, but John suspected he was working on cases as he’d head in the direction of his office. Regardless, John spent most of his time reading in the library, wandering the outer grounds of the estate, visiting Axel and the other horses, walking around the gardens and the outskirts of the forest nearby. Sometimes, John would go to the greenhouse, taking a book from the library with him so he could read there for a change of scenery.
It was a known truth that omegas were the first to come into being. Alphas came second and were the intended bond mates to omegas. Omegas were held in the highest esteem, for they were the producers of kin, giving birth to their alpha’s pups. As time passed, betas were born and they too, like omegas, bonded with alphas. However, unlike omegas, beta males could not produce their alpha kin.
the police don’t go to private detectives.”
Sherlock withered; head jerking to the side where his teeth bared into the side of the pillow under him, forced and all the same needing to lay back, open and pliant to John bucking wildly into him. In,
Sherlock suddenly recalled that same look in Mycroft's eyes and all at once he knew. Inhaling a sharp breath, his omega recoiled in despair, howling a wounded cry. This was too much. Far more than what he felt he couldn't bare. This was heartbreaking.
"Oh John. Sweet, wonderful John!"
“Sherlock.” Mrs. Holmes began, but Sherlock rose his hand up to silence her.
Sherlock looked to a man.
John sat himself on the bed and bowed his head low; clasping his hands tightly together he gave a curt nod of acceptance. Biting at his tongue, John choked back the sob threatening to be released.
Sherlock snarled ravenous for more. He wouldn’t kill Mycroft—at least… he’d try not to, for their mother’s sake, but he wanted to see Mycroft bleed just a bit more. He wanted to see Mycroft on the ground much like the two agents, and he would have, if not for the four agents pinning him against the wall, and not letting up on their pressure.
it hurt. Why did he have to say this?
“Alright, then… I’ll leave you to it then and… if you need anything—”
“You have a police force of sorts, even a marginally Secret Service. Why come to me?” Sherlock rationalized, obviously still not fully committed to taking on this case.
"It's a boy." The doctor told them and offered him up to one of the nurses, who took him off to the side to take care of him as the doctor seated herself back down.
Lestrade was quiet for a moment, gratitude in his eyes and finally said, “Okay. We’ll bring you in tomorrow. Off you go.”
"Give me another moment of rest and then I'll clean us both." John said finally and Sherlock gave a nod of assent.
“You cheated.” Sherlock’s upper lip curled in a soundless sneer, the whites of his teeth flashing through his grinding.
“What time is it?”
Most betas envied omegas, whereas alphas worshiped omegas. John was raised with betas, in an all beta school. Alphas were educated separately. Sherlock wished things had been different back then. That he’d taken an interest in his omega sooner, and stopped the hazing earlier. There was no telling what these betas had done to make John believe Sherlock was a monster. Nevertheless, Sherlock was now to pay for their hateful lies.
“So you’ve got a boyfriend then?”
"I love you, Sherlock... and..." John proclaimed without thought, his mouth moving, his words coming freely from his heart. Once he'd broken the dam, all his feelings were flowing. It hurt to keep in, and it hurt worse to say. It was frightening to show a part of himself he'd kept protected. He didn't want the pain. He didn't like showing himself for what he was because he was now vulnerable.
Sherlock wasn’t anywhere in sight and John knew it was still early for the alpha to be up after he’d spent the last four days working on a case he’d just finished. As John moved about the kitchen quietly preparing breakfast, John smiled to himself again.
Sherlock’s shoulders tensed and finally he turned around to face him. Piercing blue eyes stared at him incredulously.
“Found who?” Sherlock stammered, his stomach knotting with nerves, not knowing what she was talking about, but unsettled by the possibility of what it might be.
“What’s that?” Sherlock’s curiosity sparked.
John's heart jumped a beat, his mouth suddenly felt dry, all as his face felt cool of blood flow.
“Too muscular.”
“Right then.” A nasty snarl broke the silence and John recoiled when the front door opened and slammed shut. The distant pounding of Sherlock’s angry steps down the stairs beyond the door thundered and John furiously threw his book across the room and gripped his hair with frustration.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Mary, please,"
“Have you ever loved…someone?” John whispered out the last part with trepidation, hating how his voice wavered.
John pursed his lips, shifting his hips where he sat in his chair inside a wooden gazebo where vines with red and white flowers coiled about the building, giving them the much wanted shade, and tried to read his mystery novel.
Sherlock bowed his head and soaked up the blood from his nose with the cloth proxy alpha Mary had given to him, a painful throb claiming his heart, and he had to wonder... Was this what a breaking of a heart felt like? If it were, Sherlock wasn't sure he could survive this.
Sherlock's mind palace shook. All at once a migraine having stirred to life and the voices.
The vibrant laugh that filled the air made Sherlock's heart swell and he found himself looking back at the alpha and watched as dark blue eyes twinkled with mirth.
John didn’t care that they were now hiding out from New Scotland Yard’s, and that the world turned on them, because Sherlock needed him and John would be there for him.
“If this was Moriarty we’d be dead already.”
John shook his head, unsure how their relationship could possibility strive when Sherlock's mind was a mess.
“Oh, really? You regret it, but you wouldn’t have changed your mind?”
Sherlock's hand rose, and John's eyes caught sight of it, watching it intently as it neared, until the tips of Sherlock's fingers brushed his cheek, John tried not to flinch, and when Sherlock cupped his face, the alpha within could not be silenced of the soft whine that escaped.
John seated himself on a cemented bench, overlooking the beauty of Sherrinford’s garden. Crossing his arms over his chest, trying to keep warm, John looked up at the full moon, smiling softly to himself.
Sherlock paused and slowly turned to meet his panicked gaze. John took a half step towards the alpha, licked his suddenly dry lips and tried to speak again.
“No!” Sherlock denied, lips thinned in a grimace at his own outburst. “I don’t care enough to be angry.”
"I've decided to move to Ireland. Not too far away, close enough that at least mother and father can come visit."
John despised Mycroft, but right now he needed Mycroft’s help. He couldn’t risk meeting Sherlock again. His location was compromised and he knew it wouldn’t be long before Sherlock came to him.
John flashed a reassuring smile and lovingly stroked Sherlock’s swelling ankle.
John stared at his chair warily, the last talk they'd had there was a horrid one. He could still leave, but John could see the thought of him leaving had unsettled the omega enough. John couldn't leave, even if all he wanted right now was to get away from the omega.
. Come along honey.” Mrs. Holmes smiled happily, coming up with her own reasons as to why they were so jovial. She wrapped her arm around Mr. Holmes’ and walked off smiling.
Then there was the way Sherlock was looking at Irene… John grimaced at the open bewilderment, fascination, and wonder in Sherlock’s eyes. John’s greatest fear was happening. He was losing Sherlock to a beta and there was nothing he could do to stop it, because Sherlock didn’t remember the love he had for him.
John’s face was blotchy, cheeks flushed, eyes red and puffy, lashes dampened from tears and deep blue staring at him in a way they’d never stared at him before. John stared at Sherlock with wonder and such warmth.
John needed Sherlock and was rejected. Sherlock was always rejecting him. John looked away and stumbled his way to the stairs leading to his room.
“I will.” Sherlock took a half step to John, only inches separating them now and palmed John’s cheek in his hand. “I love you.”
“It might help telling me. I’m your mediator. If Sherlock has done something to make you uncomfortable or feel unsafe with him, I should know. I could assist in reconciling the two of you.”
John shook his head, face flushing with the voiceless sobs shaking through him, “No… You don’t love me. You can’t. How could you when you’ve ruined me?”
"That I'm fat! I'm a cow - No, worse, a whale!"
John had
John tipped his head back and to the side, exposing his bond bite, and hummed in contentment the instant Sherlock viciously sucked the exposed bond bite. John’s moan was positively porn-ish and he’d be mortified later, but right now, everything felt so marvelous.
John wouldn't ask though. He couldn't, because he knew it wasn't his place to. This was Sherlock's body and it would be Sherlock's decision alone. The only hope John had was that his husband was intelligent and capable of reading what others hid. Sherlock would deduce all of John's wishes and needs and hopefully take it into account. Then again, Sherlock hadn't discovered he'd married him for other reasons than he'd confessed to so... There was that disheartening realization.
“With a psychosomatic limp, of course you have a therapist. Then there’s your sister: I saw your mobile was on the living room table.”
Sherlock grimaced, a mixture of enjoyment and focus, movements amplifying, and with each propel of hips John felt himself curling in on himself, coiling in all the stirring pulses of ecstasy.
"Jesus, Sherlock! What happened?"
“I know you’re angry. I don’t know why, but I can hear it in your voice—Was it something I did?”
Glancing back to John as she continued her path to Lestrade, Sally asserted, “Stay away from Sherlock Holmes.”
Again, John drew out to the very tip than came back in gentle and rough all at once and-
"I know we haven't known each other for that long, but I--we get along so well..."
“Why would you say that, John?” Sherlock contemplated.
.” He cooed sweetly against John’s sensitive left ear, smile thickly laced in his voice.
“Does it hurt much?” John worriedly questioned, wondering if he’d been too rough, but he didn’t think he had been.
John was… John was formed perfectly. He was full figured, muscular, but not overly so. There were fleshy parts to him, but there was also the tension of muscles and they flexed with each movement John made to get himself into the bed.
John released him of his hold and took two steps back, his head bowing, pain filling his features and Sherlock realized laughing maybe wasn’t the best thing he could have done.
Most nights Gregory would prepare a home cooked meal, meant to feed two and eat alone within the silence of his dining room. He’d then work on some open case files within his office, or fall asleep on the living room sofa while watching the late night news.
“You should have come to me John.” Sherlock snarled once more. “You should have trusted me.”
"You feel nice to the touch, dear pet." Sherlock cooed affectionately, lifting his face to nose the line of the alpha's jaw.
“You… You inside… inside…” John clutched Sherlock’s hip firmly and groaned, “Don’t make me say it.”
John moaned and gave a nod.
Turning his phone back on, John hurriedly dialed a number as he rose from the bed and began retrieving his go bag and a pair of clothes he could change into.
Mycroft stared quietly at Sherlock, calculatingly, worry growing at whatever he saw.
“Are these
John shook his head.
"You just wait." With that Victor stormed towards the door. Sherlock stepped to the side and watched cautiously as the distressed omega passed by and ran down the stairs and out to the cold night.
When John looked away from his stare, Sherlock wondered if the omega felt embarrassment by the look of hunger clearly written on his face.
John flushed by the insinuation. Of course the always intrusive Mycroft was keeping watch over them; he was after all the family appointed mediator. That, and Mycroft was highly observant much like Sherlock and could surmise the two were lacking in that area of their married life. Not to mention, John’s scent was heavily laced with suppressants. John knew their marriage was unconventional and they were suffering from so many different problems, but it gave Mycroft no right to pick at it.
Only… When John arrived a trembling mess, evidence of having cried and began sobbing uncontrollably, Sherlock couldn’t ignore it. Even if John ended up rejecting his comfort, he wouldn’t stop trying. He’d never thought John would clutch to him desperately and accept his comfort so willingly.
who was the other woman, not him. That beta wasn't meant to be with John. It was Sherlock's place she'd stolen and he had half a mind to launch himself at her and stab her bulging belly, kill her and her pup.
“May I…” Sherlock began raising a hand out and it hovered near John’s neck, near his bond bite.
"Shut up! You don't get to talk. You don't get to lie some more. Why'd you do it? Why did you do this to me?" Victor furiously wiped his tears from his eyes, but it was hopeless, more came, quicker still.
Nuzzling the warm flesh, scenting the alpha's scent gland, being overwhelmed in the scent of his mate, John crumbled. Holding himself as tightly as Sherlock held him, he slipped from his chair to the floor. Sherlock followed him down. Beyond the heart wrenching sobs, John could hear the words Sherlock spoke into his ear.
“Thank you mother for this
John’s body at last set into motion, but not forward and towards his intended. He stepped back and away, the sharp gasps that sounded drove the fear in him to double and John took another step back. The smile across his intended’s face fell then, replaced with a raised brow of confusion. John wanted to run. He wanted to leave. He couldn’t take the ridicule, the embarrassment of being an omega. Everyone knew he’d been bought. Everyone knew this wedding was a sham.
John shook his head, his mind spinning, but he needed to say this, “Don’t sign the consent. Please. Whatever they say, don’t sign it. I’m begging you. You don’t have to forgive me for my cruelty, but I beg you, don’t sign it!”
"One time is
"Then what shall I call you in return?" Sherlock pondered.
"Don't you think you should resolve this?"
~~~~~~~~~~~~
John’s groans, shifted to soft breathy moans as Sherlock dragged his teeth delicately over his flesh and lower still to his stomach once more and placed caring kisses over the tender flesh that was there.
"You mean to make me suffer."
Sherlock said nothing for a brief moment, seeming to consider just how it made him feel. John suddenly felt Sherlock relax in his hold, shift his head back and closer still to John’s scenting while his arms folded over John’s wrapped around his waist.
John shut his eyes to keep the dampness from being released.
“Why?”
John waved his hand in a gesture that said as much and shook his head. He couldn’t and now Sherlock would never know.
“What of my lips?” Sherlock growled directly into John’s sensitive left ear.
All the while John calmed from his powerful orgasm, Sherlock spoke, and slowly John began to understand his words.
John was careful, especially now that they were in the public eye. Every time they went to work a case or they spotted the press, Sherlock and John removed their rings. They started doing this just after the first few publications of their work. It was John’s idea. John explained it would lead to more questions about their personal life and deter from
Sherlock raised his head and the look of pure anguish and love that was there...
He’d allowed the pale gentleman into his home and taken to seating himself in his gray leather chair, lounging comfortably on it in his sleepwear. Watching Mycroft carefully as he moved to seat himself across from him on the red chair, and inhaled the stale scent of a recently in heat omega. Brows furrowing with annoyance, Mycroft glared back at Sherlock.
A voice rang out and Sherlock stilled mid-stride.
John's hand pressed between Sherlock's two, and the omega opened them up, unsure what John wanted. When the alpha took Sherlock's left hand in his own and raised it to his face the omega took a sharp intake of breath. Sherlock stared wide eyed as John raised his hand up to press against the alpha's rough cheek and nuzzled it as if it were the most treasured of things, and it was. Anything of Sherlock's would forever be treasured by John.
John laughed heartily, not even offended by Sherlock’s outburst and wrapped the startled genius in his arms.
“If it’s only a scratch, let me have a look.” John bit back a curse and exhaled his frustrations, knowing arguing would get him nowhere.
John stilled, the deepness of his blue searching Sherlock’s face for a hint of anger for having hidden this from him, but found none. Sherlock really didn’t understand John, why would he condemn John for keeping their relationship from a sister who—from what it sounded like, wasn’t close to John at the time. A recent reconciliation between the two siblings could give cause as to why John wanted to introduce him to his sister, and it even explained why he was hesitant on revealing the marriage John hadn’t allowed his sister to be a part of.
John confessed as good as telling Sherlock he loved him.
"He loves you, sacrificing everything to ensure you lived, even if you can't see it as living. Sherlock... He must truly love you."
So tonight after they finished a case, Sherlock became rude and arrogant, rough and cruel, vindictive, and John would not call his omega on it. Sherlock was insecure and hurt, this drove him for his recompense and John would answer it without refusal.
John should have known this past lover was better than him in every way. Why else would Sherlock keep the towel? Sherlock kept the towel because that lover was so important to him. Even now, the ghost of Sherlock’s past love was intervening in their marriage.
Mycroft then moved to stand before John, explained in detail the case he wished Sherlock to take and hoped John would convince the genius to do so. When Mycroft was gone, he was astounded to find Sherlock had lied, but Sherlock and Mycroft had a sibling rivalry going that was both fascinating and ridiculous.
"Shut up!" Sherlock hissed, raising the hand that wasn't aiming a gun at the mad criminal to his head. He gripped to his hair, willing his mind to quite itself.
Mary was back and Sherlock...
"Swallow me? That is."
“I asked for a certain type of alpha submissive. The likelihood of which should have been impossible to match. They found you though.”
