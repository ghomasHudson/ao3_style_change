"Perhaps later," came his enraging retort.
"Sherlock-"
"And a soldier, yeah. Why do you... why is it that you antagonize him all the time?"
"You'll what?" Sapphire eyes widened expectantly, brows up nearly into his almost long fringe, a maddening smile on his kiss-swollen lips.
"You're a bigger arse than your brother is, and that's saying something, but yes of course. You all may not have been physically present but I made sure you were in every other way possible. One of our few bags is full of dvds and pictures she demands to see constantly."
They walked to the lifts as carefully as possible, barely brushing arms, but fell on each other as soon as the doors began to close. He thought to at least mention the cameras most likely present, but Sherlock's declaration that cited how the figurative meter with which he measured his ability to provide metaphorical congress was no longer operational, easily pushed any negativity out of John's mind. It wasn't as if they had their cocks out or anything, though before they got to their door, it was an extremely near thing, the way his was straining against his flies. He noticed Sherlock in the same predicament, and took special note of how his kisses grew impossibly deeper when several others from the reunion showed on their floor. Sherlock fumbled with the key card and bundled him into the room as they attempted to quiet their giggles between kisses, John grabbing the front of the man's expensive shirt and yanking him inside. The consulting detective then allowed a few more seconds, during which the new and titillating element of grinding a bit was implemented, before breaking off to make his way to the bedroom whilst John retrieved a few £10 water bottles. What the hell, this was all on Mycroft anyways.
"I'm not actually trying to be funny."
"I'll withhold sex," he smiled back triumphantly.
"But... I'm... not the... bride."
"Is that why you take every opportunity to wind me up?"
"Mycroft would have kept her safe." John's heart smiled at the faith Sherlock always had in his big brother, despite the constant bickering. Better was the same Mycroft had in him and, strangely, in John. Yes, the ex Army doctor had been a stalwart companion and caregiver from the first, but there was a certain ease of his rather freckled countenance when John was around. Probably because he was the only person in the world that could get the excitable man to calm down long enough to explain himself sometimes. "I had no idea what impact my absence would have until I returned and you were... gone. I couldn't even look for you myself because.... Damn it!" His hands went back into his hair and John eased them down again, passing his thumbs over their backs. It seemed to sooth him into being able to continue. "It was horrible and aching and I couldn't... function. It was missing, do you understand?"
For a moment he thought Sherlock was going to at least touch his shoulder but he instead asked, "Would you feel comfortable inside? With me?"
Loving Sherlock Holmes was not for the faint of heart. Discounting the more enjoyable bits, it was basically measured in an endless mountain range of frustration. The good parts were an early Summer stroll about the base, all serenity and surrounded by the natural order of things, which always included a defined, yet chaotic trail for balance, in the form of a surprise experiment in the bath, or the adrenaline rush of playing The Game. Sometimes, however, Sherlock would lead him to a series of crags, shoving him farther and farther up to the pinnacle and either unable to see(fat chance), or ignoring the increased agitation in him. The joke seemed to be on John, however, because he still needed Sherlock to be able to breathe. Not for the first time that trip, he considered seeing a therapist more regularly to try and suss out why that was and, yet again, he dismissed the thought. Why they worked didn't matter. They just did.
"Found what?" Sherlock was pretty sure John knew already but was willing to draw it out to please him. And also because John was afraid he actually had found a way, which was more clear now.
"Be nice, Sherlock." He scoffed, striding over to the plush arm chair that was positioned to look out the window and used it for its intended purpose. For about three seconds.
"You have a sexually sensitive... arm pit?" he brought himself to ask finally.
"You added shots to our beers. I smelled them immediately. But, you know, anything to make sure you were having a good time. And don't look at me like that. I'm not a puppy."
"Come along, John," he called as he moved swiftly through the sitting room as he completed the look with a black leather bomber as opposed to his now more recognizable Belstaff.
"Oh, God, Sherlock!"
"Because of the circumstances of the child's conception, he knows that you feel that returning would put all of you in danger, and that everything is his fault. He wants your forgiveness."
"Yes that is so. For example, ever since our talk behind the tree, you've only initiated touch when others are approaching and you let go as soon as they're off . You even did it in the cab, not to mention all evening here whenever I tried to engage with you in some way. And don't think I didn't see you answering emails and texting in the spa."
He hadn't thought he was in any terrible danger of being unable to control himself but here he was, obsessively licking his lips and trying to keep his breathing at a reasonable level and his hands on his thighs, though they began to slowly glide back and forth without him realising.
"Sherlock wanted you found as soon as he'd returned to find you'd run off. He'd left it up to me." He claimed John's ancient overstuffed armchair as he seemed to do everything.
"Shawn," John tried out the pronunciation of the Gaelic spelling. "That's lovely," he commented in his most soothing tone. Sherlock's smile turned a bit odd at that bit of information, but like the rest of it he hadn't time to work it out just then. He had to explain in the least alarming way possible that little Sian was coming feet first, if he could get to her left leg to essentially thread it through the vaginal opening to join the right one. The hard-labouring woman of course began to sob about how this was her only girl and her last chance. As John hushed her, in search of proper words, Sherlock suddenly spoke up.
"Will you just-"
John of course needn't have worried. He should have known that the one emotion Sherlock couldn't have faked was whatever attracted him to John. He'd seen something like it with Irene Adler and a slightly different yet equally similar thing with Janine, but this was too raw, as if it actually caused the man physical pain to express it, though he could under no circumstances re-cage it once it was properly free.
But John brought in the telly he'd specifically hauled onto a rolling trolley so they could watch all the terrible programs from the comfort of Sherlock's room. Only this time, John was in bed next to him, refusing to spoon feed him now that he was well enough to 'fuck him bowlegged'. He had Sherlock honestly questioning his sanity because he was certain he hadn't said that bit aloud. John teased him by bringing a spoon to Sherlock's mouth but, snatching it away to take the bite himself. Sherlock threatened and cajoled, but never got anywhere, nearly falling asleep from his medication before he could eat his fill. He lay comfortably in John's lap after he finished and dropped right off to the sensation of John carding his fingers through his hair and complaining about someone whose accent was clearly fake. Well, not clearly to John, but that was per the usual.
He felt delicate, warm fingers around his bindings, the action of which dissolved them. Both wrists were rubbed gently as they were brought  down, then  his shoulders were rubbed from somewhere to his left, John's hands a balm to his seared essence.
"Aaand there's all my money back and then some. Good show."
"You two look nice and loved up," Margie cooed. "Get over your little tiff, then?" John just laughed and shot Sherlock a fond yet somewhat irritated look. Truth be told, it was his natural state around the man.
"Your dog tags, John," Sherlock said, seemingly unsure of what else to say.
"Nope. Not... for... a... very long Oh shit!"
"Or high... Or having sex...," He took longer than usual to think. "But usually I was high during the sex bit, so-"
Not that he normally wasn't. The entire planet was in such a state that caring about individuals was too exhausting. He liked to think that he was just going through the motions, that doing so allowed him more time for the pursuit of the basic truth he so desperately needed to remain an active part of the world. The unmitigated farce of it all was what mostly kept his addiction active. At least when he was high, he wouldn't have to deal with people...
The noise it made when manipulated thus was a resounding, "
"Too far?"
"Oh... oh no your money's no good, sir. This is so much more than I ever hoped..." He stopped speaking in order to gather himself a bit, holding up the cards. He then cleared his throat and, with a short bow left the room, tucking them into his inside jacket pocket.
"Sherlock, you shouldn't give a little child-"
"I can see it now," John continued in a wistful tone. "Matching coats..."
"Should I take it down or change it or something?"
"But John, the experiment-"
"Got that right," Sherlock replied as if he was merely thinking out loud instead of a rather juvenile attempt at innuendo, then stopped and smirked bashfully at John, confirming it being inadvertent. He whipped his eyes back to his phone screen when John gave him a lascivious wink.
It all frustratingly and abruptly stopped when Sherlock seemed to disappear into thin air. Of course John's eyes being shut had a little to do with it, but when he finally opened them, Sherlock was standing by the cold fireplace, in full blown disarray. His carefully controlled chaos of a hair style had descended to mere chaos, his flies hanging open in flaps with just the very top of the base of his hardened penis peeking out from beneath the hair there, slightly coarser than that on his head. Only a small section of his completely unbuttoned shirt on his left in back was tucked in and that was because John had his hand there, pushing it past his waist band in order to grab hold of the fantastic roundness that kept turning him on further with the reminder that it was bare under his trousers. John could only imagine how he himself looked; probably like a Hobbit with a hard on compared to a majestic dragon, sizing his losing prey up for round two of their fight to the death.
It turned out, Margie was a rapid deliverer. All of her children had come within minutes of her waters breaking and this one was to be no different. She was already crowning by the time everything was situated and he was extremely surprised to find that what he thought of as the top of a little bald head was something else.
"All I can
"Nooo!" Sherlock stepped a little closer. "Our partnership, like all great partnerships, is based on knowledge of self and each other."
"And strong," he stated with a kiss. "And brave." Another kiss. "And kind." Another. "And clever." The last one was long, drawn out over minutes. "I want to see," he said again. "Please."
"You broke into my room in the middle of the night."
Sherlock bolted upright, stopping inches from his face, suddenly in full daylight. The sun, softened by the filmy curtains of his picture window in his old room in Baker Street cast a light on it that enhanced its natural glow beyond measure. He'd skipped one, no, two haircuts, so the ashen blond picked up the tiniest hint of a wave and could now look properly sleep-tousled. John was ethereal and in tact.
"I was fine. Mostly."
"Like all... wistfully... There was little chance we would have met earlier because as often as possible, I avoided areas outside my rooms and the campus altogether during holidays."
John watched the rather textbook show of the stages of grief play out right before him. He turned on the interior light, fog obscuring the falling snow outside, and basked in the 'No no you can't do this to me's. He then let the string of expletives and berating pour over him like a refreshing wave of cool water after an afternoon of manual labour in the sun. Sherlock's speech turned into the sticky sweet tone of bargaining, begging that he would try harder to control himself if John would '
"Well, you're all... tall and graceful and... unique looking."
"What does one thing," John laughed, "have to do with the other? And really, he's not fat. At all. I would know. I'm a doctor, you know."
and there he was, Sherlock's supposed best friend yucking it up.
"I... You made this?"
"I was fifteen before my voice even began to change instead of the others who started perhaps two years earlier. I tried to get it to do so prematurely with the smoking. Of course, being an addict, it didn't really matter after a while."
"But-"
He should have known better than to allow himself to go this far. He was an addict, and his current drug of choice was John Hamish Watson. He just had to figure out how to go directly back to 'normal' and never tell John.
"I was always yours, Sherlock."
deigned to actually let the small staff they kept, as they were elderly and it was rather a large place, cook the meal. They all stared expectantly, trying their best to keep quiet, lest they somehow miss the announcement. Mrs. Hudson had even joined them, in order to give her a bit of a holiday from her sister whilst Baker Street went through its transformation.
"I think, erm... I think will go in after all. Sorry, you'll be bored, Sherlock. Perhaps it'll help you finish quickly." John then fled everything, unable to stop thinking about how very...
A familiar tune permeated the quiet in a way that only seemed to enhance the comfort of it, like a feather cushion or fleece blanket, though he hadn't any idea why it was so known. It soothed and only gentled the path one was already on, whether it was to sleep or to wakefulness. He would have gone the former direction if not for the tiniest of nagging sensations in the tightest corner of his mind. He tried to attribute the strangeness to the dream state, but that wasn't quite it. Yes, his bladder was full, but that was much more blatant. Before he got to the point where he could properly question the situation, there was an answer in an already deep voice, gruffed further and slightly slurred with sleep.
"I'm hardly doing anything," John said soothingly, sitting up as Sherlock resumed properly impaling himself over and over again. "You're doing all the hard work."
"You can do better than that," he said, referring to the kiss. John gave him a sideways glance, behaving as if he was puzzled.
"What?" John queried, edged with confusion. Lestrade didn't answer at first, only steered him through the sliding door between the sitting room and the kitchen. He heard John's breath catch at the sight of him and didn't care for that either, as it was most likely in a negative way, not at all the same as when he first touched his lips to his endearing face. Now Sherlock had to fight not to groan as well as stay still.
"Sherlock..." John was frowning sympathetically and, it seemed, Sherlock's reactions to his visual emotions were amplified as well. This. Sucked. Then, the worst part. "Please," he begged and Sherlock's usually genius brain was flooded with images of him doing so in different situations.
"I'll just say thanks and not question anything." Sherlock gave a curt, satisfied nod, then intently watched John use the large spoon to put some of the concoction from his left onto his plate so he could take his first bite. It was incredibly pungent, but, as the smell indicated earlier, the flavour was just as intense, the play of herbs and spices balancing perfectly.  John nodded and gave Sherlock a reassuring smile even as his face grew reddish and he reached for the Lassi. "This is delicious. Even better than Sultan's Palace, I'd say." Sherlock returned a brief grin before digging in himself.
It looked like a country cottage the size of a sprawling mansion. Sherlock was concerned for a moment that the littlest Holmes would be restrained around his grandparents. John assured him Willa had been wanting this since she could express it. She would do just the right thing.
to apologise to her for." He instead followed John the short distance to the table, though it took a bit longer to navigate the chairs to the specific spot at which Margie wanted to sit..
"I've never in life done more than just play around in that particular area until now and it has been quite some time since I've done even that. There was bound to be a little... exuberance fallout. I'll take some ibuprofen and soak in the tub and I'll be fine. It's time for your medication anyway." He pulled himself to a sitting position on the bed, John's appreciative glances not going unnoticed.
"I should have... given her up... when I found out. You... I knew you didn't actually want a child and you... you didn't actually want...
"Oh I... I did beg." It was definitely a blush now, deep pink and adorable as his eyes darted about, landing on anything but John's. "I'm not proud of it. Perhaps I was more affected by the wine than I'd thought. However, whatever our desires, they lost to alcohol, as you passed out before we could even... properly start. Although I did rather like witnessing you having a little less control than usual."
"The only reason you come up here is because you know I'm more likely to listen to you bitch and moan until you fucking make me attempt to entertain you. Do you need a swab of my arm pit or something before I shower?" Good idea, actually. Perhaps he could find out what was so alluring to him about John's scent in particular. Interesting. He meant interesting, not alluring.
"Sorry?"
Later on, after they'd awkwardly finished the evening part of the daily exercises they agreed to take on in order to look their best, Sherlock burned the pad of his left index finger, his yelped "Ouch!" the first actual word uttered in the flat since they got home. The awkwardness of their experimental reveal falling away, John was immediately there, running it under cold water and speaking soothingly as Sherlock hissed in pain. He applied some salve and a flexible plaster and gave the wound a little kiss.
"You sort of grabbed me... in your sleep... and wouldn't let go."
"Close enough," John murmured into his skin, settling again. Sherlock felt the slight downturn of the corners of his mouth. His normal way of speaking often shocked in a negative fashion but John usually knew what he meant. How could he not know? He'd just told him. Of course, he had always been so logical about sentiment, just in a different way than he was. It wasn't really his fault, but he should know Sherlock never let his heart get the best of him, never lay himself absolutely open, unless he felt safe to do so, which was almost never anymore. Even with John at first, he hadn't put his
That Skype call was the last time he'd let himself weep until... Sherlock.
basement of influence, if that was possible, yet he still didn't think he could do it. "Wait no. No no no nyooo wait! This is just.... It's... We're too..." His sentences kept getting cut off by a suck on the neck here and a brush of the nipple there. It was frustratingly erotic, the way Sherlock seemed to be extending everything. But it at least gave John time to attempt to sort things out in his head a bit.
Sherlock even tested him, teasing his exposed neck with the tip of his tongue and grinning, being sure to fill his eyes with sex whenever they were facing each other and not touching. It was the only way he could stay in control of himself. Because, not only did John smell like a hot Summer night in a field, all musk and heat and soft earth, he tasted like pure fornication. It was doing Sherlock's head in.
"Very long what, John?"
"And if you say that you can get people to replace them, remember first that my leg is in the perfect position to do you great injury."
"How do you know? You're not the doctor here." Sherlock sighed deeply, still neither one moved an inch. He was acutely aware of his hips between John's thighs and how bloody hard he was. Not that he was concerned with size or anything so asinine, but didn't John
"Good." He finally turned, seeming to have steeled himself and plastering his masking smile, the one he reserved for patients, to his face. It made Sherlock feel horribly weak to have succumbed to his desire for him, regardless of the enhancements. "You really should get some more rest. I understand if those couple of hours were all you needed though."
"Not that you were scared. Of course not," John said soothingly, thankfully returning to fondling Sherlock. "Just the truth. I want to hear the truth."
John started touching Sherlock's hairline, pushing up into that gorgeous mass of dark curls, tugging gently at the root just to hear him whine involuntarily. He trailed them down the length of his neck, stroking a bit more firmly the places he planned to mark. Over his collarbone, once more through the chest hair, only this time, he didn't skip over the nipples which were wonderfully sensitive. He circled them, spiraling inward and speeding up the soft contact until Sherlock seemed to be doing everything in his power not to whimper, a task easily defeated by a nice rolling pinch to one, the other, then both at once. He'd almost gotten Sherlock to come like that a few times, but could never resist touching his cock during the experimental process, therefore making the results inconclusive.
"Sorry. I'm sorry. Look, you don't experiment on his things or break into his laptop without permission nearly as much as you used to. And you got a separate fridge for your... experiments. If that doesn't say 'Sherlock Holmes is in love' I don't know what does."
"Thought you weren't gay," Sherlock stated breathily.
"Well then I suggest you either get a new mascot, or, better, don't put your faith in superstitious trinkets."
one extremely fitful week during a London heatwave where his attic-dwelling flatmate and best friend pranced about the building in very little, his scent powerful to Sherlock's sensitive nose. There was almost an incident when he brought home ice lollies and had the nerve to eat one in front of him. John had grinned cheekily at him, but it did little to keep Sherlock's eyes off of how the former Army doctor's thin white cotton vest clung to his lean torso. Or how John's scarlet football shorts seemed to conform to every move of his pleasantly muscled thighs. Sherlock was well aware of his own literal and figurative assets, but John... It was obscene in the most glorious way that always left him frustrated and distracted, which all of London, including John would pay for by bearing his moodiness.
Sherlock hit a particularly tasty patch of skin as he trailed kisses over a combination of material and displayed flesh that derailed that. Without yet touching any important bits, he got back to John's mouth, his cunning, dexterous mouth. He sat up, straddling John's thighs, still not taking off John's top, but unable to resist running his hands over anything he could reach, almost disbelieving he was now allowed to do so. He resolutely avoided the more distracting areas. John needed to be as present as possible for this part of information exchange.
"John never could just take the compliment," Marceline added, still laughing. "It's very British."
"Honeysuckle. Of course it is," John grinned.
He'd not only survived, but thrived after the lowest he'd ever been, getting exactly what he needed in the way of adrenaline and genuinely helping people beyond his medical training. It wasn't exactly the war he missed. Mycroft wasn't precisely correct about that. No, it was the aspects surrounding it, the rush of helping fix a human being who may have had much more to offer the world than his or her life at the time. As long as there was a tomorrow, there was always hope for anything, from curing diseases to mending relationships on a minor/major scale.
"You're perfect," Sherlock blurted, heart running away with his mouth. "Your scars, your skin, your mind... you... are unfathomably beautiful." He made sure to have John's eyes as he spoke these absolute truths.
"If you don't stop talking about yourself like that-"
"Okay so masturbation didn't work. Fine. I'll just... help you eat then."
"I can help you," John offered without looking at him, still helping him with his drink.
"Really,
"And Willa?"
"Sod the experiment. Or figure out what you want to know in other ways. I'll let you know when you get to something I'm not really up for. For instance, I'm not really... sure about the, you know...,"
"The... wanking thing." He nearly choked.
That was the last straw as he, as organically as possible, took John's hand and lead him back in the direction of their booth, John taking lead once more as soon as he realized where they were going. Sherlock had him order two more drinks and two shots for them, the message delivered through Trevor who still sat there, a biological woman on either side of him, watching. John tipped the server another twenty for good measure and once more assumed his relaxed posture, Sherlock allowing himself to snuggle in a bit more now.
He made the decision like he made most of his decisions, within a scientific construct of facts and figures. He made up spreadsheets and filled journals with all sorts of information from past and current things John said and did, to how he smelled and looked at various times. All of the information present and organized still didn't tell him whether or not the man would be open to... having him. He knew he couldn't just have sex with him, that if ever he was to convince him of it being a good idea, it would be for life, at least in John's eyes. Since Sherlock refused to break his heart, it would have to be so for himself as well. In that aspect at least, as he couldn't promise his normal behaviour wouldn't inadvertently hurt his potential lover. John had often even said it, playfully to him, but more seriously to other people when he thought Sherlock couldn't hear or wasn't paying attention, usually whilst in his cups. "He[insert incident here]and it just broke my heart," he would say, usually followed by, "D'you know what I mean?". It would have done the same to Sherlock, supposing he had one, figuratively speaking.
"Yes," he answered without hesitation, despite the vague description of feelings. "Mostly how I felt except for needing to be there for Willa. That was a bit of peace at least." He fully grasped Sherlock's hand then. "I wish you could have seen her as a newborn. Photos just don't do her any justice. She was this perfect, tiny thing..."
"Oh my God, Sherlock, they're £200 each!"
Sherlock radiated that same overwhelmed new-parent vibe by barely restraining the nerves in his voice as he asked if those were the kinds of questions that needed to be asked and if he should be asking questions, too. Then he went on to ask questions anyway as they slowly climbed two staircases and passed several heavy-looking wooden doors with a dark finish. John saw one open at the end of the hall, the voices coming from it distinctly Willa and her grandparents happily conversing on the merits of alphabet blocks. John shook Greg's hand, thanking him for his concern and turned to Sherlock who caught him off guard with an unidentifiable look. Then he figured it out.
"I'm a master at concealing my emotions, you remember."
"Don't be ridiculous, John. She was a baby. Babies don't actually
when stating that he was offended too, just fyi and laughed some more about it. John had no idea how close he'd come to being ravaged, had a history of
"S-sorted?"
"Oh God, no," Sherlock exchanged a smirk with him. "I'd have to train someone else and it would all be terribly inconvenient. Besides, imagine how dull your life would be without me."
"That so?" Sherlock's head popped up indignantly, though he lowered it again to talk so he could be properly heard over the music.
"Yes. regardless of the amount you'd consumed. And I didn't object to your sleep-grinding against my own to both of our completions as I was mostly asleep as well. But we never actually engaged in all the activities you must have dreamed." John sighed once more. He hadn't harmed Sherlock with over-zealous drunken passion and had still somehow managed to get off in a manner in keeping with their rather juvenile approach to maintaining an air of sexual closeness. Snogging and dry-humping were the go-tos of his own youth at least. He'd no idea about Sherlock's but perhaps that was a conversation for another time. Now was a time for a bit of inner celebration. He hadn't harmed Sherlock on accident.
"Exactly." John accepted his apologetic kiss and slipped Sherlock's phone from his jacket pocket to put into his hand. Sherlock kissed him once more and sat back down to begin texting Lestrade.
"Fine. Whatever." He waited until he'd rung the bell, completely silent from the outside. It must have been heavily sound-proofed. He waited until the last moment to whisper into John's (rather good-smelling) ear.
"It's alright, Honeybee. We're safe. I'd like you to meet someone." She padded over on tiny, chubby feet, clad in her pyjamas, patterned with her nick-namesake, and stood slightly behind John. It was the only indication of her nerves, as she didn't clutch at her father's leg or turn her head away like most children did when being bashful. She was actually nothing resembling shy if there was something interesting to examine. She was her other father's daughter in more ways than one. It was completely silent but for the sounds of the water on the rocks below and the wind in the eaves. Then she stood her straightest, approached the strange man, and stuck her hand out.
"What turns you on?"
So when Sherlock committed suicide, John witnessed his own breaking this time, felt everything, strangely, even more keenly than when he was shot, as he was mostly in a drug-induced state in those early days. But there were no proper medications to dull the pain of Sherlock's absence, and still his mother's voice sounded off. But then, there was another, smaller one. It whispered and teased with unclear motive and strangely pronounced words. He practically ran back to his therapist, just
"Right. I'm going to go and, uh, freshen up. See you in a bit, yeah?" Sherlock didn't reply.
"What?" John's frown was annoyingly adorable.
"Daddy?"
"I rather like you this way," he smirked devilishly before licking a stripe up the side of Sherlock's neck. "Trussed up and almost incoherent." By the time he
"Not even a half truth," he promised. "Now hurry up! Her Highness is bellowing for a royal dresser."
"That was lovely, Sherlock." John couldn't help kissing him, tasting the partially consumed candied fruits in his mouth and slightly unaware he was backing him toward the bed. "Truly... lovely."
He shut his eyes and turned his head as John lifted the pillow, hearing a hitch in his breathing and a quiet, "Oh." John cleared his throat and he could feel him unable to take his eyes off of it in a way that superseded medical curiosity. That only served to further aggravate things. "Did you try a sedative?" he inquired, only a little tremor to the silken voice he used as a means of comforting his patients.
"Well it has to have you written all over it. You're not the simple flowers and chocolates type. That is, unless the chocolates are shaped like human hearts and the flowers are lethally poisonous." They both chuckled at that. Mostly because it was accurate. "Erm... buy a fresh chemistry set and conjure up a nice dinner served in lab equipment?" That actually wasn't bad.
"Will I or Mrs. Hudson be disturbed by these images?"
"Sherlock, I haven't even showered yet."
"You've joined a gym," he said without opening his eyes, sitting up, or moving his hands, palms pressed flat together and poised just below his chin.
"Sherlock, no! Don't think you're fully forgiven for that missing Wednesday thing. John told me all about that when he found out. I could still have you arrested." Touché.
hurt you, then."
"So you tried-"
"You're forgetting one thing in that."
"Yes I recall a bit of a friendly rivalry going on," said Sherlock, in a tone that denoted a playful nudge without physically doing so. He did lean toward her a bit, just not in the looming manner he used to intimidate people into giving him the information he wanted.
True to his word, he didn't overdo it, as he did when pretending with others that John had seen. The only indication anything had changed between them now, was the fact that he openly sought John's touch and that of the child they shared. After explaining to Willa what was going on, that they were to be married, they went down to the delicious smells of lunch being served, taking each other's hand and Willa allowing herself to be carried by Papa("It's much higher when Papa carries me").
"What a ridiculous question."
"It's a female form of William," Sherlock sniffed, concealing his awkwardness with arrogance. Those magnificent eyes darted around as if they couldn't deign to settle anywhere for any duration.
"You're not drinking your water," he said lightly, though his tongue was a bit too big for his mouth. He decided, in his rather slowed mind, that it would probably be more easily contained if shared between two mouths. John pushed the little pain relief pills between those shapely pink lips, took a long pull off of his water bottle, and lowered his mouth onto Sherlock's. Once their lips were properly sealed together, he slowly pushed the water into Sherlock's mouth until his tongue was in there and the water, pills and all were swallowed. With another deep kiss, he sat back a bit, satisfied with Sherlock's erection indicator going off, and pulled the silver chain, the only other thing John wore besides pants, from around his neck over his head. He looped it over Sherlock's and indulged in digging into the raven coils and waves for a bit whilst he kissed him once more.
John opened his own shirt the rest of the way and slid it partially off his shoulders, for once not thinking about his bullet wound. He undid the rest of Sherlock's buttons as well, pushing aside the soiled flaps and using his tongue to clean up the rest, lingering on Sherlock's neck moles as the man continued to writhe and mewl in a most enticing manner. He kissed and licked and gently brushed wet curls back from Sherlock's reddened face, not quite reaching it for a kiss he desperately wanted.
I think this is the longest chapter even without the epilogue. But I kind of didn't want it to end.
"John... May I see her?" John gave a great heaving sigh, swiped his hands roughly over his face, and blew his nose before making use of the hand sanitizer. John stood as if preparing to face an inquisition and entered the small bedroom they shared. As before, she wasn't in the bed. Mycroft gave him a curious look and he couldn't help the little smile of pride as John pulled out his own mobile to text a happy face emoticon. Slowly, a panel, the hinges of which were hidden by the curtain of the window set deep into the logs, opened noiselessly and a giant dark eye crested with tousled curls not as dark as Sherlock's, cautiously peeked out.
"Touche." Sherlock had at some point gotten to his feet, automatically following him down into the kitchen. John lay his acquisitions on the chair closest to the stove, extracted a plastic grocery bag from the fridge, and Sherlock stood, leaning back against the lip of the sink to watch emphatically as John placed it on the worktop.
"Try what?"
Greg gave nervous, lop-sided grin and a little wave as he caught up. Outwardly, Sherlock seemed perfectly calm, steady, as if he was facing danger, but john knew he was worried to death. Behind Sherlock's blank mask was blatant fear, the kind of dread usually reserved for situations in which death was imminent but one hadn't yet resigned one's self to the fact.
"God no. Just because you can't keep up with it, it doesn't mean the route isn't direct, just that I get there faster. But it's okay, almost everybody can't..."
"I told you already. It's an experiment." He was stirring mechanically but held deep blue eyes with verdigris ones. He never really understood the world's obsession with eye colour. Well, not until John's eyes, that were the colour of ripe blueberries or sapphires glinting in firelight and reflecting snow.
disaster, even if he wouldn't find amusement in it until later.
Before that deadline, however, Sherlock reached across him and released his seat back so it fell to a much a wider angle. Before he could figure out what was going on, Sherlock had John's trousers open and his flaccid cock out through the slit of his pants. Well flaccid wasn't exactly correct. He frequently went to half mast when he was expressing passion toward Sherlock, his body not seeming to be able to differentiate between positive and negative emotion, only that his blood was up and Sherlock was interacting with him. Definitely more therapy because that didn't sound right at all.
"Of course you do, because you are a six foot three year-old." He gasped in over-dramatic shock. "And you don't have many friends because you don't want any. We had to kind of bully our way in there and endure your lashing out born of uncertainty-"
"Jesus Christ, Sherlock, I'm fine."
"That's fine. In what was apparently a dream, I've had enough to last me a while." John gave him a sideways look he wanted to kiss off of his face.
"What?" Came the almost purred demand from the bench.
"Hm, let me see... something along the lines of, this never has to happen again, you can learn to be satisfied with just this once, and you love me beyond all measure and would have me any way I wanted you. Close enough?" John sighed and tensed slightly, about to pull away, but that was the last thing he would allow until he'd finished. He insisted on talking now, when words were still so few, so they would talk.
Finally, all Sherlock could do was take up a book he'd been reading, a German volume regarding brain chemistry, and wait for John to be finished. As he heard John exit the kitchen door and take the steps up to his room two at a time, Sherlock loudly reiterated that he would have to dress appropriately for a nightclub, emphasis on the 'No jumpers or knit ties' rule he implemented on occasion. John didn't respond, only pausing to hear him out before continuing on his way. Sherlock was pretty sure he heard John's eyes roll. He was well into his book when John came back down, Sherlock deciding to linger on his page for maximum dramatic effect when he began his tirade on all the things John would get wrong.
Right so... here's some more fluff and angst and smut.
"It's a different world out there in a desert wasteland of a war zone. There were extremely few women and they were in separate areas most of the time. The number was halved by the dead and those that got up the duff simply because we didn't really have the luxury of birth control and everyone was lonely and upset." It was difficult for Sherlock to be offended when it was something associated with such a painful time in John's life, but he was nothing if not clever and managed it just fine. Especially when John continued with a casual sniff, "No, I'm not gay. I don't even consider myself bisexual because even when doing that in Afghanistan, I had to picture women."
"Molly Hooper says I love it really."
"Yes." John gave him another long look before turning and continuing his way up.
"I lost you too, you know," he said, just as John was thinking of abandoning the idea of a nice hot Jacuzzi bath and just popping into the shower for a quick scrub down and taking some pills in order to sleep through the rest of their time there in order to avoid further discomfort. He was, as usual, unsure of what Sherlock was getting at.
When John texted him that afternoon to the effect of he would be home within two hours, Sherlock had accepted a case, showered, shaved, and gotten into one of his nicest suits before he even realized what he was doing. Again, out of objection to John's absence, he didn't bother tidying up. However, when John showed up, he gave a cursory look about the place, sapphire eyes twinkling with expectations being fulfilled regarding what state the flat would be in upon his return. He'd said, "Well, at least it's still here." His eyes had lingered a moment longer on Sherlock's outfit as Sherlock berated his appearance, before John just asked about the case and went about tidying up whilst listening.
"The same world in which you can just look at him and tell what he had for breakfast two days ago."
"Oh, John! I'll show you." Wait, what?! Before he knew it, Sherlock's mouth was on him, making filthy slurping sounds between brief, vague instructions on how John should handle his underarms. Sherlock had him just fiddling about there, the hair not very thick or plentiful, just like on the rest of his body. He repeated any action that elicited a more severe reaction naturally, even as he grunted out his own pleasure at Sherlock's expert fellatio. It seemed like it should have been more strange than it was, that he was forgetting something important, but that mouth opening wide to admit his member, the throat muscles wrapped around a good portion of him, made it impossible for him to think of anything else besides what they were doing, what else they were going to do. Sherlock sucked cock with a relish he'd hardly ever seen outside of the internet. He seemed born to it, probably practicing a lot, though there was very little that didn't come naturally to him.
Although he complained, John was more often amenable to most of his experiments than people would think, infinitely more logical than everyone else seemed to be, having little to no objection to a hair, nail, or blood sample, cheek swab, random odd questions as long as he knew about them. Sherlock only mentioned the ones he didn't know about in an environment about which John wouldn't soon remember that minor detail. It was a good sign that he hadn't yet brought it up, even after moving back to Baker Street.
"Yes, sir." Her legs were going before she was set down again, in her usual manner, and she bolted off through the adjoining door.
"We'd have never done it if we weren't."
"Kisses."
They took their time with the tea, going over plans of action, playfully arguing over some of John's phrasing in some of his blog entries or whether or not they were going to return the gorgeous and expensive full dining set or give it to Mrs. Hudson to help replace all the dishes of hers lost or otherwise contaminated. They took turns with long, hot showers John coming out from his to an impeccably dressed Sherlock and what could only be his clothes laid out. Only they were a brand new Navy blue button up with pearled buttons and a pair of the most comfortable dark denim jeans he'd ever experienced, though a bit snug-fitting.
For once, Sherlock was asleep first. They managed one more orgasm apiece before he had to clean the two of them up, as Sherlock drifted off before doing so whilst John was in the bathroom. After lovingly wiping him down and covering him with the sheet, John opened his laptop to quickly jot down a few things about their rather remarkable evening as he finally got to enjoying a glass of champagne. He found himself opening and staring at an entry he made many weeks before.
"She smelled horrid," Sherlock sniffed, as if remembering. "It was the main reason I handed her over."
"My God. Sherlock Holmes are you
"What? I can't believe there's nothing in that massive brain of yours?"
"This way," John puffed with his own effort not to meet Sherlock's up and down motions with his own, "You'll come all over your own shirt instead of mine. It probably costs more than everything I have on, including the pants."
"Sherlock, I can't just... try," John said softly. "You'd have to either be with me or not. I have to have-" He cut him off with another searing kiss, during which he tasted the salt of a tear he had falling. It made him kiss John harder, more deeply, because his pain was unacceptable to him in this situation. And there was the rub, wasn't it? That situations did exist in which John's pain was acceptable to him, more situations than he wanted to admit. It was the foundation of his entire scheme to bring Moriarty down.
"We've only just begun, and that isn't what I've brought you in here for." With a heated kiss, he corrected himself. "Not the initial reason, anyway." John smiled through another kiss before he allowed himself to be walked to the foot of the bed and his attention directed to the wall above the headboard. Four seemingly empty 11x17 frames were hung in a row and, just beneath it, a long, rectangular frame housing a continuous piece of paper with zig-zagging markings on it from one end to the other. On the bed itself was a letter, on good stationary, John's name written with a flourish on it in forest-green ink. Sherlock then left him alone, shutting the door and seating himself at the kitchen table to wait the amount of time he estimated it would take for the letter to be read, its instructions followed, and to gather himself after.
"Which is?" John had to look at him again now. Really?
During one particularly steamy bout, he attempted to get more control of himself by conversing with John between kisses, genuinely trying to work out what would get him to finally agree.
"I see..."
"I... I want..." Which apparently still didn't work.
"And apparently I was always yours." John blinked at him, not really surprised. For Sherlock, to fall in love was the most inconvenient thing ever to happen to anyone. John understood. He really did. But it still hurt a little.
"You're a doctor, ex-military, and semi-famous," Sherlock listed. "There are legions that would give their right arm to accompany you to your school reunion." The consulting detective turned his laptop around and handed it to John, a site open which contained profiles of girls making themselves available to date him specifically. John supposed he shouldn't have been surprised that Sherlock knew exactly what he was talking of, but he couldn't help being amazed at the dichotomy between the man's insight and ignorance. He could tell a potential client what he had for breakfast three days ago, but not think much wrong with, say, keeping a human foot in the crisper, even after repeated discussions regarding respect for common areas and related things. John was properly surprised by this website. There were literally hundreds of women, virtually(literally) throwing themselves at his rather high quality size 44s. As children, Mum always made sure that if nothing else, they had a good pair of shoes, a good coat, a church outfit that fit, and a good jumper, all fashion staples that made their way into his adult wardrobe.
"Because you do it anyway. Repeatedly. Though you
"Women are actually meant to give birth in a similar position," he explained lightly. "Gravity makes everything easier for you. Do you know if it's a boy or girl?" It was all more distraction tactics, as he could already see the answer.
There were maybe a hundred more before they even left the house the next day, and many more as they walked around, Sherlock visually attempting to control his pride as he promenaded his fiance and child in the sights of many who swore he would die alone and very young... probably at one of their hands if not one of their animals, or as a result of an experiment gone wrong. They certainly didn't think he'd find someone who cared nothing for anything he could offer them personally, but who he was. John was extremely surprised to encounter, in this rather close knit farming community, extremely little prejudice out loud and even less in the form of sideways glances and head shakes when it came to their both being men.
"You're staying hard for me." Sherlock didn't seem to be able to lift his head or open his eyes. He just mindlessly rutted as John got well back to his arm pits. The truth was, in this position, it was much easier for him to control his orgasm, a habit of making sure whomever he was with got as much as they needed paying off once again.
Kissing Sherlock was an unexpected pleasure, the way his mouth was shaped, the way it felt, the different techniques they shared back and forth both through conversation and demonstration. Sherlock expected to experiment with it often and John was only too glad to help. He would always realise just how long it had been since he'd had a proper snog session, with no expectation of anything further at the moment and it fueled his fantasies in an almost aggressive fashion. He would only wank in his room, when Sherlock wasn't in, as it was still a bit strange that he now almost had to think of a bloke whilst doing so. To be fair, it
"So I have to officially say the words or it doesn't count?" He was just teasing at this point and felt an abiding guilt at Sherlock's near panicked expression.
"You didn't think I'd not tell her about the most important people to me on the planet, did you?"
The sweat on his brow wasn't just a reaction to the drugs. It really was that warm. The sound the door made when John kicked it shut behind himself was amplified by Sherlock's thoughts. It was as the closing of a jailhouse door, sealing his fate, whatever it may be, in his prison cell. John stood in only blood red football shorts and a deep blue tee shirt that made his eyes pop. He'd had an unexpected bout of extra grooming. He'd clipped his toe and fingernails and had shaved again. His silvered honey hair feathered comfortably into its usual military cut, and he smelled of his most sparingly used, more expensive toiletries. Sherlock could hardly breathe for the sight of him, his lizard brain causing him to nearly drool for just a taste.
"You wouldn't?" John seemed more surprised that Sherlock wasn't averse to sex than afraid he was going to hold him to some unspoken agreement.
"I just said so, didn't I? I can cook, John, it's simple science. I just usually have more important things to occupy my mind."
"I'm fine, Sherlock." he leapt out of bed over to his gingerly walking new lover and got on his knees behind him.
"Everything's tickety-boo. Hey, why don't we take up this table here so poor Margie can get off her feet."
"Uh, yes. She was breech."
"They're only words, Sherlock. This is me. It's okay." He searched John's face for a lie and, satisfied that there wasn't one, inhaled deeply to speak.
Sherlock slowed everything, languidly kissing him and caressing him back once more to a calmer state. He wanted to taste him when he reached his peak and told him so, earning himself a delicious swear and a filthy command with John's fingers tangled in his hair tugging hard enough to stay just barely in the pleasure zone. Ever the caregiver, John released his hair when he got close again, explaining breathlessly that he didn't want to tear it out by accident. Sherlock didn't say anything as his mouth was otherwise occupied.
"Oh John," she laughed softly. "You still have the same exact character. What's a few wrinkles or gray hairs?" He couldn't stop smiling or looking at her. Just as Sherlock came out of the bathroom, John realized they hadn't yet released each other's arms and did so at once.
"You sort of... kissed me. Like, a proper snog." Sherlock frantically combed through all of his memories, down to the details of how John's skin felt and tasted, the weight of him in his lap... three powerful orgasms. There was no way that couldn't have been real. Yet... "I'm sorry."
"Not if you won't mean it."
"Oh God, do I really smell that badly?" God, no. He meant yes. No.
"Yeah but... Never mind." George showed mercy then, picking up a file and holding it up in front of him to read so there was an illusion of privacy. Like the confessionals at church, Sherlock could express his feelings without feeling like he was being watched, with a solution in sight. "So what's the problem?" Sherlock sighed and fiddled with the arm of his chair.
"Tell you what? What the hell should I tell you?"
"Poor Janine," John reminded him, crossing his arms and looking away but not moving to leave at least.
"When I... came back, I didn't know whether or not you still cared. You refused to see me again, even after your attempts at throttling me and your successful head butt. Even Mrs. Hudson only hit me once."
"That show," he blurted. "The one with the rather genius, alien with the old police box for his space ship. It's not terrible."
"A social experiment," he murmured. "Won't happen again." John sighed and was going to be a man about this. He got up and walked to the sliding kitchen doors, stood open.
singing talent, despite the inane popular drivel they had her covering.
John finished with a generous dollop of raw honey, gathering some that had dripped and sucking it off of his finger as he put the lid on and started it up. Sherlock's mind unhelpfully supplied flashbacks of his fantasies when he was Away, in a manner not unlike the headache one gets when one consumes something extremely cold too quickly. Pulsing images of sucking honey off of bits of John and vice versa caused him to press the ball of his hand to the center of his high forehead. John's immediate concern didn't help. And by didn't help, he meant was exactly the right thing to make the thoughts continue.
doing much better." Sherlock noticed that, more often, John always threw in a kind word. "I'm just... I'm just giving you permission now. And it's on a case by case basis, so don't think this is how you're to behave all the time." They looked at each other for a long moment before Sherlock finally took the seat opposite, finding a bit of comfort in clearing the area between them of his work as he began speaking, keeping one eye on John's lovely, healing hands as they fiddled with the grain of the wood and stealing glances at Sherlock's face.
Willa sat almost primly on the bed, in her little coat, lightly swinging her little feet. John asked her if she was ready after informing her that they had to wait a little while longer to go meet her grandparents. She nodded hard, black coils bouncing, smiling widely. A knock sounded and the door opened.
"It is selfish to have you all or nothing."
"Oh, right." John's eyebrows suddenly shot up into his hairline once he realized what Sherlock was talking about. "Oh!"
"Bisexual with more of a propensity toward men. I told you, I'm a four, do keep up. If you don't find men sexually attractive at all, how do you explain this?" He grasped John's cock, pulling a distracting little moan from him. Sherlock's indignation took a very short holiday when confronted with the heft and circumference of it, as if it was formed specifically to be handled by him. "Because you certainly are aroused by the sight of me." John thought about it for an endless moment.
it amusing.
"Please." It was almost a whisper and John froze for a moment. "You weren't just meat. You cared. You loved me. I took advantage of that as I always do, but I didn't know it was going to be that way. You shouldn't have allowed it. My friendship, I mean. You shouldn't have allowed it, but you did and it shouldn't... it shouldn't have been like that."
Sherlock scoured Youtube, finding several videos that were nothing but clips of kisses from movies and shows and transferred them to DVD. Christmas preparation always began early and they would be having a few more people over than usual. Being one of the most motherly(read: guilt inducing) people on the planet, Mrs. Hudson recruited volunteers wherever she could. John really hadn't a chance, as she was still a bit sore about all the time that passed since Sherlock's 'death' in which John made no contact with her. It would have been out of character for Sherlock himself to help beforehand, but completely in character for him to barge in on anything they were doing, render it unimportant, and try to speed it up once they insisted it needed to get done. He inwardly groaned over the fact that he'd have to do inane things like hold containers and fetch things whilst presenting his experiment at a mile a minute and brought the disc to the expected baking excursion.
"Look at me," he commanded. Everyone present did so, though John's eyes went back and forth between Sherlock and the nearly newborn lightly wrapped in a towel and hanging from her, the head still inside. It was imperative he not handle her too much lest she take a breath before her airways were clear of the birth canal. "I trust very few people in this world, especially with my most intimate aspects, but I trust John Watson with all of my heart and, if there is such a thing, soul. He always gives his best effort even when a tenth of it is more than adequate. He could do this in his sleep with one hand tied behind his back but he is fully present, aware, and more than competent. I believe in John Watson."
"Am I not supposed to?"
"Not naked. And not like...
Sherlock made The Sound.
"Your mind is shouting," Sherlock murmured. "Kindly shut it up."
"I'm hiding from the wedding-hungry beasts. I'm almost positive they've bought out the local shops of anything wedding related." John smiled a bit at that.
"You must really fancy me or something, all this blushing you're doing..."
lack manners? How about showing up where you know for a fact you're not wanted and not getting to the point?"
"No, Sherlock, absolutely not." He brought his book back up in front of his eyes but Sherlock could see he wasn't reading the words. Then, "Are you... actually serious?"
"Of course."
"I'm very glad to meet you as well."
"Look, I don't know what you're doing, Sherlock," he said finally, dropping his arms as a symbol of doing so with his guard. "I have no idea what your end game is. But then, I'm not to know the nature of the experiment. Look," John actually lay both hands on Sherlock's arms that he'd crossed in a mirroring fashion, "The experimentation is supposed to take place within the confines of the established relationship. The relationship itself isn't supposed to be the experiment. Not at this point." Sherlock's arms itched to go around him but he held them fast to his chest. "For instance, you're not one to say, 'hey let's go have sex to see if there's anything there'." He couldn't help a tiny smirk, at which John narrowed his eyes.
He was unmistakable. An unlikely predator of willing prey. Sherlock refused outright to admit to himself that he was extremely jealous. This John Watson could have convinced those women to come to his bed with no problem. All at once even, if he was of a mind. Sherlock had no rules for his own sexuality. He liked what he liked regardless of the genitals. But he'd abandoned it to celibacy long before in order to properly focus on The Work. But this John Watson, having before just poked at Sherlock's sexual appetites through the keyhole of the chest inside the cage he'd locked his libido in, had broken the lock on the chest, the carnality now straining against the bars of the cage, snarling. This was much more than a bit not good. He had to do something to counter this before the cage door was weakened enough to break as well. Then where would they be? He'd most likely be friendless once more. Well except for the drugs.
"I... don't know, actually."
"Then how do you identify?" How did he classify himself? What additional label could Sherlock affix to him to make him easier to process, to read?
"You have." John opened and unzipped Sherlock's trousers, tapping the narrow hips in an unspoken command for them to lift. They did so, seemingly of their own volition and he began working them and the deep grey boxer briefs down those creamy thighs, peppered with dark hairs, past sinewy calves, using a bungee he'd found in the boot, accessible from the rear seat to bind delicate-looking, dark sock-clad ankles until Sherlock could do little else but let his legs fall obscenely wide or expend effort keeping his knees closed, uncomfortably twisted to the left. John made sure that 'closed' wasn't an option, keeping his weight on the binding, his body between the now bare legs, bare legs that were, he was pleased to note, already quivering a bit with anticipation. John shed his jumper and tossed it in front where he'd been sitting.
"Perhaps, but is that not part of a relationship? Especially one in which sexual activity is implied?"
"Anatomically correct hearts on Valentine's Day..."
"I... need a bath as well."
"Oh but I did. And anyway, I think you'll find it serves as a wedding gift as well. Two birds, one stone and that."
As they lay with the sheet draped loosely over their cooling bodies, limbs tangled, John contemplated the madness that was not only the past few weeks, but their entire life. He had a thousand questions, but very few seemed important enough to actually ask just then. He wanted to know precisely when Sherlock first fell for him, or at least realised it, because it was certainly long before this particular adventure, if memory served as to how he behaved toward someone he had more than platonic feelings for. He wanted to know if Sherlock was actually attempting a seduction or if he was just planning on never doing anything about it. Most likely the latter, going by his track record regarding emotional entanglements. Above all, he wanted to know what exactly Sherlock saw in the older, greying, broken ex-soldier, and if he knew that he'd saved John's life, for what it was worth, just as much, if not more than he talked of John saving his...
It was, hands down, the best he'd ever had.
"Sorry," he said, pushing off his fine shoes, even using his long toes to remove his own socks.  "Pigs are actually as clever, if not cleverer than dogs," he said, words nervously speeding up the closer he got to his being completely bottomless. He nervously attempted to go into a lengthy explanation about animal behaviours humans also exhibited, which, according to him wasn't actually that interesting since Humans were also basically animals, and was momentarily cut off by John just going for it in his attempt at his first ever blow job. Apparently his thought became a bit more basic and random, but when he got to the bit wondering about if Mrs. Hudson would allow them to keep a few pigs on the roof of the building, he was kissed thoroughly when John suddenly reappeared over his face.
"You have no idea what this song is, do you?"
"I was just wondering... I mean I'm not you, so I have to ask."
colour again. His charming lips were slightly parted, and he could practically see John's heart rate rise in his neck.
Now, however, he was in over his head. They'd cut out his tongue and were carving into his flesh and mercilessly manipulating nerve bundles, but it was nothing compared to what they were doing to John. The others they'd already shot upon confirmation that Sherlock still lived. Such a small thing was a bullet, to completely eliminate everything that was these remarkable people, genuine spirits, if there was such a thing, released into the ether, never to acknowledge him again in the forms which he could recognize.  John was the only one left.
"And what do
"You look beautiful. You've hardly aged a day. Unlike myself," he chuckled.
They also had packing to do, which translated into John had packing to do whilst Sherlock had lounging, directing, and complaining to do. Both men took their jobs very seriously, Sherlock not even removing his shoes as he lounged like the Queen of bloody Sheba, John responding to the various grievances his love had regarding the daytime telly programs with the appropriate noises as he concentrated on getting everything into the garment bags and cases in their proper places. They were more easily unpacked if he took a bit of care now. Whenever he slowed, Sherlock would pipe up with something which caused him even more interest, the discussion of which would distract him into speeding back up.
"Yes, I believe you care for me a great deal," he said. Then, surprisingly, "And I you, and, according to, well almost everyone, it seems we're practically married now. " John's jokes had much more of an hysterical edge when he was trying to keep some sort of fear of Sherlock's ignorance at bay and talk the rather socially inept man through something important. John really was a marvel, often pushing aside his own great discomfort in favour of making sure Sherlock understood a piece of knowledge. "But it's not the right
"Are you alright?" Sherlock questioned, frantically looking him over, laying his hands here and there, checking for all they did.
"Just ask. I promise you won't offend me." Well... that was the truth at least. So he just went for it.
of love." John sat almost perfectly still but for hand gestures and all was very quiet for a long time as the genius was given time to study the situation from within.
"Good lad." The whole thing was probably inappropriate and definitely tragic, but in a way, they were in the business of inappropriate and tragic, as further proven by Sherlock returning to his side just behind him and reaching past him with a business card in hand.
A flustered, blushing, stammering, and aroused Sherlock Holmes was just about all John could stand and he began undoing the rest of the buttons on the other man's shirt. For some reason, it was imperative their skin was touching as soon as possible. They did have the room for another several hours if they wanted it and it would be grand having a little more time in that lovely bed before having to go.
He wasn't wrong.
"That's ridiculous," Sherlock snapped, still trying to hold on to that last, tiniest bit of hurt for as long as possible. "What the hell does that even mean?" John, however, remained unaffected by his sour tone, his smile still evident in his voice. That, mixed with just the memory of actually seeing it as well as his eyes caused the negativity to disperse completely. Sherlock was now angry that he was no longer angry. An orgasm from John apparently drained all sense.
"Well, I've taken the liberty of purchasing these. We'll have them anyway or I'd never hear the end of it from my parents or Mrs. Hudson or Lestrade. It would be a bigger nightmare than having informed Lestrade of my decision to ask was." He reached into the pocket of his dressing gown as John gaped over how much Sherlock had gotten done in such a short period of time. He was positive he hadn't been in that tub for
Seeing chinks in Sherlock's armor was always thrilling, but John wasn't quite prepared for a fully exposed one. It seemed Sherlock wasn't sure if he was for such complete exposure either, but John made absolutely sure in any way he could, that no matter what, Sherlock knew he was always safe in the circle of his embrace for as long as he lived. It seemed to open the floodgates and what came pouring out was a heart-rending, toe-curling, full-body quaking passion that left John unable to breathe, and frankly uncaring as to whether or not he did so again. He never knew what it was to completely surrender until then. Not everything came naturally, of course. But John had done many things in his life with which he was unfamiliar, and the base hunger for everything about each other prevailed over any awkwardness.
"You didn't tell me Babe was an anthropomorphised pig." What?
They tried almost everything except for anything sexual. There were heads on shoulders or in laps, lingering squeezes or pats of limbs as they'd pass each other around the flat, and even chaste kisses on benign places such as temples or foreheads or hands. Sherlock would wrap his arms around John's waist as he made tea or a bite and sweetly rest his chin on John's right shoulder. John would do the same, except for on his head whilst he was bent over and experiment. They even found it much more convenient to sleep in Sherlock's room when they shared a bed, John going so far as to kip in there whenever he needed to, whether or not Sherlock was in.
"Mm, sounds lovely."
"If you're going to be bending over like that, the least you could do is take off your shirt the rest of the way so I can see properly... John, I've hurt you."
"Not fair," Sherlock huffed. John let out an even louder groan as Sherlock panted a series of what sounded incredibly like whimpers as he licked and gnawed at the exposed flesh.
"I... I'm not. It's just... you're making these sounds and..."
"Fantastic!" Sherlock's eye roll was purely for show, a motion to mask how much he'd missed such praise from this particular person. So much so, that it gave him an absurd thrill that sometimes manifested outwardly. This time it was goose bumps. Absurd. "Besides, you always swear more when you've been around military people in a casual setting," he said with a reluctant little smirk, to cover his defensiveness. "So crass."
"How?" More sips of the now saturated tea ensued.
"Sorry you- What...?"
"Papa let me put the chocolate on the toast." There it was, that familiar stress storm after the quiet of placation. John hadn't missed that at all. Well... Perhaps a bit.
"It's okay, Sherlock," John quirked a tiny smile and he almost dove back on him again. Instead he sat in the chair John had previously occupied and pulled him onto his lap. He needed a moment to rein in that flash of fantasy he'd had earlier about this very position, which seemed a little easier when John held his head to his chest and he could hear his racing heart mirroring his. John wanted him, too, but he
John in throes of orgasm was a feast for the senses. The way he arched and moaned, how he undulated sinuously, how tightly he squeezed his eyes shut, then opened them in wide surprise, looking at him with a plethora of meanings all fighting mercilessly to be seen. Sherlock kissed everything he could reach in order to give him a moment's respite, but, at the look on John's face, eyelids at half mast, lips, slightly parted, he couldn't help diving back down for more study, and a repeat tasting and viewing of this phenomenon. He often accomplished the improbable. Rarely did it give him this level of satisfaction.
"It's pointless," he hissed.
"It was... difficult to see you try not do anything about it."
"I'll free you," he said cryptically. "When you feel my touch on your wrists, you'll be free and safe."
"Do try to contain your excitement about it." John pat his jaw rather hard and gently shoved him up and off.
Sherlock was incorporated into Willa's bedtime routine, her Papa staying a bit longer with her after lights out. John emerged from a luxurious bath to a freshly showered and dressing gown clad Sherlock, the familiar blue one that did things to his already remarkable eyes. John had been provided with a brand new matching one in a deeper blue, which flowed silkily, sliding pleasantly over his skin as he moved toward the other part of his heart.
He still won the wrestling match.
"It's not really anything, I promise. I just... would prefer it if you weren't so annoyed by being in love with me." He glanced quickly over at his fiance(?!)who stood in one of his usual poses, his hands clasped behind his back. Sometimes he'd lean forward just a bit in order to properly loom, but that was usually reserved for flirting and intimidation for cases.
"What do you mean, 'is that all'?" His Sherlock impression wasn't nearly as spot on as Sherlock's John one, but he only ever used it when he was agitated.
"I probably won't be able to go as far as we want right away," John admitted, regret permeating every syllable. "I've never gone past manual and oral... stuff."
"You're avoiding the question."
"Alright."
"Of course not, John. Now with modern advances however, it's only a matter of time and I wouldn't be surprised if it happened in our lifetime. But, in the mean time, your sister shares your genetic make-up, more or less. I can probably have some formal agreement drawn up between us, and kill two birds with one stone. She'd have to become the healthiest she's ever been in order for us to harvest her eggs-" He was only half joking, as he was slightly panicked at revealing to John and himself that he'd actually spared thoughts about what their children would look like. The doctor finally looked over at him and it was an unexpected struggle for Sherlock to keep his mask in place.
"Closely," they corrected her absently in unison.
"You're... thinking... too loud. What were you going to say?" Sherlock was making an effort to enunciate, his slight speech impediment showing up despite his best efforts.
"Not at this. If I say the wrong thing-"
"Yep." Sherlock got back on his phone, but still continued the conversation.
"Well,
"What? No."
"John, Please!"
"You can ask me anything."
"I love you," he said quietly, almost under his breath. John stiffened a moment, causing him to do so involuntarily in response, but he never let go, and relaxed almost immediately.
"Not much I can tell you that I haven't yet or you haven't already deduced or found out other ways." John's little smile made Sherlock's belly quiver, but he had to get on with this so he could get off with John.
"I found it."
"If anyone could do it, don't you think it would be me?" he asked. John had sighed then, and walked over to the bed, arranging himself so he all too closely resembled a corpse in a casket in the soft light that filtered through the curtains. So he made sure to involve John in his own pleasure, not needing every word he asked for, but allowing as many of them as John needed to feel relaxed. It took a considerable amount of time to find the precise pressure and motion, but, once found, it was a matter of moments before John was crying out confused questions about how Sherlock was accomplishing this, the strongest orgasm of his entire life, and that was saying something.
" accompanied the filling of his mouth. He stopped the sucking and just lapped at it after swallowing until John began weakly tugging on whatever he could reach of him, panting for him to rejoin him at the head of the bed. "I'd be jealous that you're so brilliant at everything, if I wasn't so satisfied," he mentioned once they'd thrown the duvet over themselves from the waist down. He'd noticed Sherlock's prodigal erection and, giver that he was, began sluggishly stroking it with small kisses to Sherlock's lips and face. "You're brave as well," he said.
"It's human nature," Sherlock explained in a whisper, his breath humid in John's ear, though not unpleasant. "Still appalling, though." He settled back again in his seat after a playful lobe nip, John probably making his own sound, this one more surprised than anything else at how quickly he went to half mast at that small action. Sherlock had surprisingly drunk every glass of wine poured, and John grudgingly admitted he had a hard time keeping up. They slipped out just before the end of everything, including right before the last of the alcohol hit John's system.
"I don't need anything! Go away!" He listened for a moment, heard John turn (
long. Of course, with Sherlock's propensity toward experimenting with memory manipulating chemicals, one couldn't rightfully be certain. It was a wooden ring box, carved intricately with what looked like perhaps lilies, but weren't quite right to be. Inside, nestled in what had to be a silk pillow were a pair of rings that espoused simplicity and glamour. They should have been gaudy and cumbersome but they weren't somehow. The bands were silver, probably platinum if Sherlock was the purchaser, and each had a discreet notch, and were etched with the likeness of a plant. The one that was obviously John's was immediately recognizable as a thistle, referencing John's Scottish blood. Sherlock's matched the carving on the box.
. Sherlock leaned back as John balanced the computer on his thigh. He then proceeded to watch a Youtube video forwarded to the bit where a massively muscled 'actor', obviously from Southeast Austria, was having issues dealing with a classroom full of small children.
"Yes! A social experiment!" Sherlock's excitement was a bit contagious, even when John wasn't quite sure what it was over, which was usually.
"I do know a few things that could probably tide you over."
"Is that so?"
"To be honest, I didn't think I was ready for it," he confessed.
"Wait! Wait, hang on a tick. Three and then go? Or one, two, and go on 'three'."
The car pulled up in front of the familiar black door the knocker jauntily to the left meaning Mycroft hadn't visited. Sherlock didn't really touch him more than usual, well more than what had become the new norm which was loads more than before, but then he was almost never one for unnecessary public displays. He did allow John's hand on his thigh, even putting his hand on top of it and absently moving it up closer to his groin when John tried to show a bit more decorum and initially just pat his knee. He said little other than confirming his older brother wasn't laying in wait for them, poised to give them an earful about their relationship.
"Eight minutes," Sherlock stated nonchalantly.
Challenge accepted.
"Sherlock," he stood almost involuntarily. "Are you... do you think if I was gay-" he quickly reworded the question at a short, sharp glance from his friend, "If I was... romantically inclined toward men in any capacity, that I wouldn't want to be with you?" Cleverness was his only security. Other than his mind, Sherlock was just as vulnerable as anyone else, if not more so. It was why it was such a big deal when someone mentally bested him, however briefly. It was all a bit heart-breaking.
"Oh look, he's blushing," Margie pointed out, sparking another round of cackling that cut off dramatically just as John turned and raised himself from his seat in order to flee the table.
"Sherlock you didn't have to-"
"Well see? There you are. I mean following your logic, it sort of makes me partially to blame for the time you were gone because-"
To Sherlock's utter delight, John was actually returning the volley, reaching up to wrap his skilled doctor's hands loosely around the base of Sherlock's skull as he tried his best to keep his on John's face or hips so as not to scare him into thinking something more was going to immediately happen. Just as he was figuring that this was all he needed ever, John sighed contentedly, the initial tension draining from his compact frame, and melted into his arms, before doing some sort of... thing... with his tongue, and Sherlock was almost instantly erect. He tried his best not to actually devour John, though he wasn't sure how well he was doing, as the tension returned in a slightly different form, the need to get him somewhere, anywhere horizontal, or at least able to straddle him in some way. He had a flash of a fantasy of John doing so in Sherlock's chair, that (he imagined) glorious chest dripping with sweat as he pounded up into him, attempting to clean it with his mouth. The thought made him groan and lift John nearly onto the sink.
to distraction for years now. I crave your happiness, your approval and attention, but I hurt you anyway, and that... bothers me." He pushed himself back up to his feet to pace the kitchen and part of the short corridor that lead to his bedroom once the area was cleared. "Logic dictates to go back to how I was before, but then everyone will suffer, I believe, unnecessarily. The worst bit, is not that everyone will pay for my cutting off the distraction that is my feelings for you. Some would actually benefit from my being able to remove myself further than ever from what I suppose you'd call empathy. No, the worst thing is that I would be without you and I'm too damned selfish for that." John took in and released a deep breath.
"Don't worry about it ending quickly," Sherlock stated. "We've had enough alcohol to delay the ending and, if you're still reluctant, you probably won't actually remember anything tomorrow until I begin telling you about it. Which I may or may not do, depending on what I think would be best."
"You're alright," he said finally.
"Please don't talk about Mrs. Hudson right now," John pleaded.
"Shut it."
In my head, the club owner looked exactly like Jimmy Carr(Too much 8 Out of 10 Cats, I think)
"No."
"Mycroft informed me that isn't entirely true."
"But John, we're over halfway there."
"Thanks," said Greg. "You-" Sherlock stepped toward John again, much closer than outside and Lestrade fell silent.
got home, he wasn't the least bit surprised to find Sherlock stretched, out on his bed in his pajamas and thinking pose. Sherlock had long since discarded his dressing gown, John's higher quarters gathering heat from within and without, despite light blocking curtains. Before laying down, Sherlock clicked on the fan wedged into the open window and that helped. A bit.
"Please say something."
"Don't make any plans between activities tomorrow," Sherlock mentioned. "There's an official brunch, but we won't be attending. We will instead order room service. A bit of brekkie in bed for the lovers." He briefly waggled his eyebrows in a cheeky manner to match the tone used in the last sentence and John grinned, now sipping his own water as he finally experienced the opulence of the bed as he usually did things, side by side with his best mate.
John clutched at him with all his might, crying harder when he orgasmed, yanking him over the edge into his own, where the world went white in a combination of catharsis and lightning. However, his body kept moving of its own accord. There were no more words, and very few tears now, just the music of the electrical storm and their damp bodies, mouths on skin, grunts and groans and gasps. There was no telling how long it was, but when they orgasmed a second time, Sherlock was on top. It seemed to be the maximum of their endurance and he rolled to the side, refusing to release or even pull out of John by his own doing. John only adjusted to lay in his arms, on his shoulder, for easier access to his mouth. He dragged the fingers of his occupied right arm over John's temple and cheek, giving and accepting lazy kisses.
and it couldn't be the main part of the experiment. He told the DI that the final aspect of the experiment would be carried out at their annual Baker Street Christmas party, the first since his return from the dead. It would be perfect. He'd worked out the gift he would give, exactly what he himself would do and say, knew what he would be wearing would compliment John's attire as he would make sure and choose something for him. He would have the mistletoe hung just inside his room, and ask John to come privately help him with something he was normally rubbish at so he wouldn't suspect anything. Like an appropriate gift or how to apologise properly. John was nothing if not wanting to be helpful when it came to Sherlock attempting to behave like a normal human being. Then Sherlock would announce its presence in a playful manner and... Wait! How did John want to be kissed? He'd almost wished he'd paid attention to those wretched rom-coms John had a badly kept secret yen for. He could have slapped himself for not thinking of the simpler solution more quickly.
