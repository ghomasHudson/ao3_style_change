When Cas rolled his shoulder again, he latched onto his movement. “What's wrong with your back?”
“What? No, that... Cas...” Sam sighed.
“Actually, I thought we could watch the fireworks together.” Cas looked shy again, looking up at him through his eyelashes.
“Oh? Oho? Is it official then?” Gabriel waggled his eyebrows at them, grinning. “Now I understand why you're ready to take the fall.”
“No! But maybe you could... I don't know.” Cas sighed, then muttered: “Maybe I should have asked the High Enchantress for an incantation against her.”
Dean sighed contentedly as he wrapped his arm around Castiel. Tentatively, Castiel returned the hug.
For a moment, Dean just stood there, too surprised to act. But then he dropped the present on a table and followed after Cas.
Cas traced patterns on Dean's stomach. “I will sleep here every night you want me to.”
“You are disturbing the employees and making them uncomfortable. I do believe there is a clause in all of their contracts that they do not need to endure such a thing. So I do, in fact, have the right and the responsibility to call the guards to-”
“Princess, I've checked him thoroughly. Twice.” MacLeod pursed her lips. “If that is not sufficient for you, may I suggest finding another sorcerer who will provide you with more fanfare and smoke and mirrors to make you believe they're doing something more complicated and glamorous than they actually are.”
Dean rolled his eyes. “Come on, get on your stomach.”
Castiel struggled to get up, and Dean whined, but eventually let go.
“Exactly what I said. I would like to... hug you, I suppose.”
It wasn't a bad base, really. But at the same time, Dean was surprised at how careless the wolf had been, leaving traces everywhere for any hunter to find, leading them straight to the warehouse. Well, he was less surprised when they were jumped by not one, but three werewolves as soon as they entered the building. They had probably felt secure, had maybe gambled on drawing in hunters to kill them, too. Let the prey come to them.
“Are those hearts?” There were a lot of shapes, but somehow, this one stood out to Dean. He hadn't thought it would be possible to make something with both sharp angles and curvatures with the same enchantment.
“Look at that. My little android's learning.” Dean huffed out a laugh. “How long was I out for? I mean, after...”
Another huff, and Dean was pretty sure Cas was rolling his eyes in the dark. “Don't test me.”
“I've been called a lot of things, but sweet is rarely one of them.” Dean grinned. “So, dinner and a walk afterwards? Wait, is dinner a family affair or something?”
He was nervous. Oh fuck, was he nervous, almost as much as he had been before their first time together. Which was stupid, because they had already done it a few times now, but then again that had been months ago and maybe Cas had gone along with it more out of curiosity than out of passion, and what if he didn't want it, what if he didn't want Dean anymore, what if the thought of sleeping with the vessel of his brother-
They didn't have much time before Sam came back, and someone could have entered the room at any moment, so all they did was hold hands and talk. But for the moment, that was enough.
“You're beautiful,” Cas told him, using his other hand to grab Dean's arm, tug him down enough to kiss him. Dean let it happen, and he didn't protest the compliment, because no matter how silent they had tried to be before, it had never stopped Cas from babbling nonsense, praising Dean left and right. Dean had tried to argue against it in the beginning, but Cas had always maintained that he meant every word, and eventually Dean had given up on trying to silence him.
“It's that bad?” Dean asked, because he didn't know what else to say. A lot of angels had died over the last years, sure, but he had never considered that they could eventually die out. It had always seemed like Heaven had an infinite supply of angels, spewing them out and into the Winchesters' way all the time.
“If it makes you uncomfortable, it makes no sense to do it. Given your latest... experiences, it is no surprise that you are reluctant to give up control or have something inserted into you.”
“I do.” Cas craned his neck so they could kiss. “Can I stay here tonight?”
He probably had an even better bed, Dean realized, suddenly feeling stupid.
Dean made a face when he remembered the books. God, he hoped Claire hadn't read them. Especially the sex scenes. Jesus, please let her not have read the sex scenes. (And not just because the writing had been awful.)
“'m still sleeping,” Dean mumbled, burrowing closer into Cas' chest.
Dean's heart skipped a beat, and he had to tell himself that this probably didn't mean what he thought it meant. Back in the city, watching the fireworks together with someone outside your family usually meant you wanted a relationship with them, but Cas probably didn't know that. And he was a prince. Gods, he would probably laugh in Dean's face for such a silly notion.
“Okay, breathe.” Dean looked him straight in the eyes. “It's fine, alright? I'm not a kid, you don't gotta organize food for me, I can get my own. Well, at least I can get a servant to bring me some, which... how awesome is that? Anyway, I was thinking maybe you could show me around a little after dinner if you're not too tired, so I'll know how to get to the front yard and stuff.”
“About what?” For the first time since coming, Dean opened his eyes.
What was he doing? What was Cas doing? Was this even real, or some kind of fever dream? Had he died and gone to one of the Heavens? He pinched himself, and it hurt, then pinched himself again for good measure. No effect. He was still staring down at his measly belongings that were apparently destined to be brought to some rooms in the palace.
Sam rolled his eyes. “You know what? You can explain the lawn and the guinea pig to each other. I'm going to bed.”
Lady Margaret barely looked at Jacky, but her eyes roamed Jerry and her smirk became even more predatory. After a moment, she glanced at Dean and said: “You can leave now.”
The whole room could probably see Castiel's feelings on his face, but he couldn't have cared less. Dean had kissed him. In front of everyone. This wasn't just a good day anymore, but a great day. An amazing day. The best day of the year, in fact – bar the one on which they had gotten Dean back and it had been clear that he would survive. And the moment Dean had woken back up. And – okay, maybe there had been a lot of great days these past few weeks. The point still stood.
“As long as you like it.” Castiel shrugged, walking over to ring the bell for a servant. It didn't take long for them to appear, and they ordered dinner, then sat down at the dining table together. When Castiel's eyes landed on the half-empty plate of pie, he raised an eyebrow. “You ate half of it?” he asked, surprised.
Why was Gabriel sitting so close to him and where was that hand that he couldn't see behind the table?
Cas grimaced. “In her own way.” He let go of Dean's hands and sat down on the bed. Dean joined him. “I had hoped that everyone would be too busy with the preparations for the coronation, but apparently my sister's mind can handle multiple sources of rage at once.”
So. Uh. I don't really have anything to say in my defense on why this is so late, except that life, depression and writer's block got in the way. Anyway. Hope you still enjoy it.
Dean didn't know if he meant Sam and him, or just him specifically, and he didn't dare to ask. He turned away, still grappling with this new information. In the end, he went to join the others by the tree to see if he could help them, and he and Cas didn't talk about it again that day.
“I take it you haven't been in the palace for long... your highness.” The baker's voice was calm and relaxed, but the slight hesitation betrayed how careful they still were.
But Sam didn't get the chance to muse on it any further, because Dean chose exactly that moment to walk into the kitchen. “Morning,” he called cheerfully, making a beeline for the fridge. Cas was trailing behind him, but stopped next to the fridge, not bothering to look inside. No wonder, since he didn't need to eat.
Dean's hand froze, his fork hanging in the air midway to his mouth as he tried to get more of what the lady was saying. The TV was still muted, though, and he couldn't read lips. Now he really wished Eileen was here. Or maybe not. After her last run-in with a hellhound had almost resulted in her death, maybe she wouldn't be too big on dealing with anything canine.
Dean sighed. “No. It's just... all so unreal, you know? I hardly know anything about the palace. Hells, Sam probably knows more about etiquette and how to address people properly and all that stuff than I ever will. He's far better suited for this place than I am.” He scratched at a barely visible stain on the table.
Sam raised an eyebrow and looked like he wanted to argue (probably along the lines of Cas not having to sleep and therefore being perfectly able to drive them back at any time of night), but before he had the chance, their mom came over.
“Dean?” That was Cas' voice, coming from beyond the bathroom door. He didn't trust himself to reply just yet, either. “Dean, are you alright?”
“I just figured that you two didn't like to be public about it. But everyone's making comments about you either 'finally getting your shit together' or them 'never having guessed in a million years' and now I'm confused.”
He just had no idea how to do the whole coming out thing, had never actually done it before, and he was scared shitless thinking about how everyone might react.
“Y-yeah. Let's just... try, okay?”
“Egregious!” The guy glared at Cas, but turned to leave. “How you could sink so low. I had hopes for you, nephew, but alas, it appears you have lost the last shred of-” He kept lamenting all the way to the door, but Cas just rolled his eyes and turned back towards the table.
“Cas, come on. If you really don't wanna do this, just tell me.” Dean gestured between them helplessly.
She stepped closer, putting the child down so she could yank his arm, inspect the bracelet. Dean held back a yelp as she almost dislocated his shoulder. After a moment, she was apparently satisfied that the bracelet was real, and stepped back, her eyes cold.
“Cool.” Dean turned the knob and sighed in relief when the cool water started streaming over his hand. He glanced at the person still standing in front of the doors, looking stricken. “Dude, it's fine. Just don't drop any of the pies, okay?” He was both glad and mildly frustrated when they left through the doors, taking the pies with them.
“Oh,” Dean said when he saw her raised hand, that was shivering slightly, soap water dripping onto the floor. Then he whirled around to point an accusing finger at Sam. “The hell you been teaching these kids?”
When he downed his glass of wine in one go, one of the employees lifted the wine bottle, a questioning look on their face.
“I'm an angel, not a cleaning service,” Cas rumbled, in that deep, throaty voice of his. “Better get used to me not using my powers anymore.”
The playground was mostly deserted at this time of night, though when they stepped close to the sandbox, a child poked their head out of the wooden structure that was meant for climbing and had a slide on the other side. Of course Castiel knew that this wasn't really a child, at least not just, though he also wondered who the angel's vessel was. Did they have a family, parents who loved them? Had the angel taken the child from them, or did they let the child take over by day and only used them this way by night? Castiel shook his head at the thought, flashing back to when he had possessed Claire for a short while, back when she had been a child. That wasn't something he was proud of, but he also couldn't really blame any of his siblings for doing the same, he supposed.
“I don't know. Maybe- I dunno why Claire gave you that, I mean why would she- she couldn't know-”
Sam seemed surprised, to say the least, but he couldn't exactly argue against it when about half a dozen people were already rushing towards putting something on that list. When he heard that they would take Cas' new car instead of Baby, though, he seemed alarmed.
“Your – you – your soul. So bright,” Cas started babbling, and Dean knew he wouldn't be able to stop himself if he was already talking souls. “Your eyes. Your strength. You – when you blush. Your – your stupid movie references...”
to hold Cas' hand in front of his family and friends, he
“Of course. You are allowed to leave your rooms any time you wish. You're not an employee anymore and you're certainly not a prisoner.” Castiel frowned at him. “Wait, I almost forgot.” He went back into the rooms proper, fetching the golden bracelet from the reading table. “You should wear this. It identifies you as a Royal Companion.”
Dean sighed. “Alright. Try not to get mugged. Your rich boy robe is gonna attract attention.”
Sometimes, in moments like this, Dean imagined what it would be like to be somewhere else, to live just with Cas – maybe a house somewhere, close to a beach or at least a lake. Shit, a lake would be nice, he could go fishing there...
“Honestly, I just want to kiss you all night.” Cas said it like it was the easiest thing in the world, like it was normal for a prince to say that to a commoner.
“The archangel blade,” Cas explained, and when Dean looked down at himself, he added: “I healed the wound. It took... two healing sessions, because I used a lot of my grace in the battle against Michael, so all I could do at first was to keep you from bleeding out. But now it's all healed up.”
But the Prince was smiling. “I find it rather refreshing.”
“He did this. Michael. Not you. He was using you at the time, but he would have done this regardless of his vessel. It has nothing to do with you,” Cas told him with a hard voice, obviously trying to keep down his own anger.
It was the middle of the night, and Dean hated waking up to nothing but darkness when it reminded him so much of his time under Michael. Whenever it hadn't been blood and fire, it had been darkness, swallowing him, drowning him. But at least right now, Cas was there, warm and solid against him, a reminder that he wasn't alone, that he hadn't drowned, that he was back. That he was okay.
Then there was another knock on the door, and Dean opened it to find the same butler from before, once again looking stoic. “Your food, your highness.” They bowed and started to push the little cart they had into the room, but Dean took over from them.
Dean stepped closer, but waited for Cas to initiate the kiss. He wasn't disappointed. When they stepped apart, Dean realised this was the first time they had kissed in front of other people, even if no one was paying particular attention to them. It made his heart soar for some reason.
It was so nice and warm in Cas' arms that Dean was out before he could be self-conscious about the loud moan he had let out when coming.
Dean sighed, grumbling under his breath, no actual words but definitely a statement. Then he shifted, draping his whole body over Cas, who huffed beneath him. “Go ahead and try,” Dean mumbled.
“Sue me,” Dean grumbled automatically, stuffing his mouth with bacon. “If it's bacon that kills me, I win.”
“Go ahead.” Castiel was curious what Dean wanted that would make him shift in his seat like that. Was this about money? But Dean must have figured out by now that Castiel would buy him anything he wanted.
“It's alright. There are many of us and few enough clients that I can go for weeks without one. Besides, there are safeguards. Clients can't technically make us do anything we're uncomfortable with.” There were even guards to ensure this rule.
Dean snorted. Maybe Star Trek night hadn't been the best idea, after all. “Okay, Spock. So long as you live long and prosper.”
Time for more people being assholes. Because let's face it, this is the Royal family, aka the angels, and most of them are dicks. (Can you tell I hate most of them? :))
Castiel tilted his head. “Is there... a sexual connotation to 'holding someone' that I'm unaware of?”
Castiel sat back on the couch, all too aware of the two employees who had stayed behind with him. This was ridiculous.
“Please?”
Castiel smiled, remembering the little time he had spent with the Winchesters as a human and how Dean still had apparently memorized what he had liked back then.
Dean rubbed a hand over his face. “I just-” He stopped himself, or maybe he couldn't go on, his voice shaking and sounding like he was choking.
But before he could answer, Thomas poked his head into the kitchen and said: “Chief?”
“Nothing.” Cas looked guilty, aborting all movement.
Dean stared down at where Castiel's hand was resting on his exposed skin, the sleeves of his robe still bunched up at his elbows. Then he looked back to his toe, really seeing it for the first time in several minutes. He really was picking it apart. Dean stilled his hands.
Michael looked at him in surprise, as if he hadn't realized that he was still there.
Perhaps then his sister would calm down a bit, he thought without much hope. Really, the best he could hope for was that at least Hester wouldn't be sneering about Dean's attire anymore. And at least Dean would finally get to wear clothes that befitted his natural beauty.
Dean was holding the vial, having put the cork in, staring down at it with an unreadable expression.
“We're here to do shopping. I'm sure Sam could spare a team of hunters to-”
“Kiss me first?” Cas asked, looking at him all bright-eyed and innocent.
“So you ran out of options and made the kid do it.”
Dean wondered if Prince Castiel and Gabriel had such different job descriptions, or if it was just that Prince Castiel actually took his job seriously. Possibly both.
Castiel hummed. “She might have been trying to tease us. Perhaps she has noticed my feelings for you and aimed to embarrass me.”
Prince Castiel pressed his lips in a thin line. “Do you... do you actually give massages, or was that one of my brothers euphemisms?”
They glared at each other. The High Enchantress cleared her throat, and Castiel realized she was smiling at him slyly. “I do believe that is enough payment. Now, my dear boy.” She held out her hands over the coffee table. “Come on, don't be shy.”
make me very happy. These are pretty good, too, though.”
A tension that Dean hadn't noticed before bled out of the Prince's shoulders. “Yes, please.”
Dean was still marvelling at all the plants, some of which he knew, others he had never seen, when someone called out behind him: “Can I help you?”
It wasn't quite like that, at least not literally, though Jack beamed at him and came over as soon as Dean entered the room. Cas had gone a bit earlier, and Dean had felt bad as soon as he had left the room. This was how they usually did it, leaving the room at different times so people would maybe, hopefully not connect the dots. But it kinda sucked, and Cas deserved better than to be Dean's dirty secret, not to mention that Dean
“No,” Cas told him quickly, and he pressed a kiss into his hair. “No, but Dean... There is little love lost between my siblings and me and I told you that I am tired of feeling responsible for Heaven or fixing it. And if I am to live under humans, I would rather do it as one of them. As one of you.”
Gabriel looked at him thoughtfully. “So it's true that he barely ever fucks you.”
“'m still sleeping,” Dean mumbled, burrowing closer into Cas' chest.
He only lasted a couple of seconds before he got up again, moving around the rooms, opening drawers and wardrobes, which, to his surprise, had stuff in them – not much, but it seemed like Cas had bought a couple of things for him. Or maybe they belonged to the previous owner of the rooms, whoever that had been.
That obvious, huh. “Yeah. But I'm a Royal Companion now.”
Dean didn't mind the comfortable quiet, but apparently Prince Castiel had places to be.
“Thank you,” he said, surprised at how rough his voice sounded, finding it suddenly dry.
In an entirely serious tone, Cas said: “I was, and always shall be, your friend.”
Dean put a bookmark on his page and got up from the bed. “So you did chose the books here. I've been wondering.” He walked up to Castiel. “Interesting choices you made.”
“Cas,” he repeated, seemingly trying the word on his tongue. “Huh. I don't hate it.”
“Well, it's not her choice.” Cas had gotten loud, and his eyes widened when he saw the frown on Dean's face. “Apologies, I didn't mean to yell at you.”
“What?” Sam asked, a little confused at the turn in the conversation.
Dean had never been so close to the fireworks before. People in the city usually did their own thing, shooting up a few rockets, but he had never seen anything like this. It was colourful, but not chaotic, a strange rhythm to it that Dean couldn't quite decipher.
“Anna,” Cas said, a sad smile on his lips. “Their world's version of her.”
“If you think for one second that you can seduce the prince and manipulate him, then you are sorely mistaken, you sorry excuse for the son of a whore!”
“You- Are you still drunk?” Dean frowned down at their hands.
“Yeah.” Dean nodded, slowly, then patted the mattress beside him. “Come on, let's watch some movies. I snagged Sam's laptop earlier.”
“Uh, it's just... Let's sit down.” Dean marched towards the bed, then sat down on it stiffly, his fingers digging into the fabric of his jeans. Cas sat down beside him and put a hand on his back.
“Ugh. Can you believe this guy? He's sooo formal. Everything has to be exactly the correct way. So boring.” Prince Gabriel reached for the bottle of wine that was standing in the middle of the table and Sara got up to fetch him a glass. She also put one in front of Prince Castiel.
Dean bolted out of the shower as soon as he had rinsed off all the shampoo and showering gel, then scrubbed himself dry with a towel. There was no point in getting himself worked up over this when it might be nothing. Cas wasn't like that, he told himself, and if anything he was even more affectionate towards Dean than before the possession. They had even talked about retiring together, about spending basically the rest of their lives together, and here he was, getting upset over Cas maybe not wanting to touch him when he had been touching him so often in the last few days. Not like during sex, but still. He didn't seem repulsed by Dean, didn't seem like he minded that up until a few days ago, Dean's body had been moving against his own will, had been made to do things he never wanted, to kill and torture and-
“Yeah, well. Good try.” Dean wanted to shake his head, but also didn't want to move it from where it lay on Cas' chest. So in the end, he raised a hand and patted Cas' cheek, a little clumsily. “So if I hadn't tried to settle down, if I had kept hunting. You would have come to me?”
When Cas noticed him, he glowered at him. “I thought I told you to-”
“Cool. You want me to ring when you can get it back?” Dean gestured vaguely towards the bell, still entranced by the food.
“Uh, can I touch you?” he asked, seeming nervous.
(See the end of the chapter for
“They still make you very happy?” Dean teased him after a particularly big bite and Cas needed some time to chew before he could speak without half a burger falling out of his face.
“Can we talk about... have you changed your mind yet?” Castiel asked. “About me.”
“He has taken a commoner as his companion,” Hester spat out, still fuming.
When people started coming in to get their stuff, Cas elbowed Dean lightly and pointed at someone.
“Is this really necessary?” Dean asked for the umpteenth time.
“We can do that.” This time, their kisses were calmer, sweeter, though they still made Dean's heart beat faster. They ended up lying on the bed, Dean on top, rubbing against the hard lines of Cas' body. “Did you happen to wake up horny today?”
“What are you waiting for?”
“You guys are such snobs.”
“Like what?”
“Right. So.” Dean's hands were sweaty and he tried wiping them on his jeans, but it didn't help much. “You threw me on the bed. And stuff.”
Dean was glad to be rid of the tailor. They were just doing their job, he knew, but their job was a real pain in the ass, and Dean had sighed in relief when they had finally packed their things and left. He already dreaded the day that his new clothing would arrive, and he was sure he would hate his appointment with the shoe maker the next day, but at least for now he was free to do what he wanted again.
Castiel started on a story about how Gabriel had once tried to steal the King's crown, and Dean let him talk a while before he asked: “Why do you always say 'our father'?”
Oh, by the way, Benny is in this chapter. :)
“Hey, C-” She stopped and stared, then threw open the door and came rushing in. “Dean!”
“I want,” Dean said, putting his hands on Cas' sides and rolling them over slowly, “a piece of that ass of yours.”
Dean thought it over for a moment, then figured that if Castiel wanted to mock him, he wouldn't need his life story for that. “I was born in the Marigold district.” Not one of the noble parts of town, but still respectable. “But after m- we moved to the Oxwell district when I was five.” Even the Prince must know that that was a step down. “It was my father's decision – not that he had much of a choice, I guess – but he wasn't happy about it. He expected us to do better. But he also...” Dean pressed his lips into a thin line. “He used up most of our money. Tried to take Sammy out of school.” He gritted his teeth, trying not to think of how he had dropped out of school himself, so he could earn some additional coin. “He thought he was better than everyone around him, and he wanted us to be better, too. But he didn't do anything to help us. Didn't so much as lift a damn finger in the house.”
“Just do it again,” Hester hissed. “I command it!”
Eileen obviously tried and failed to suppress a grin and even Cas huffed out a laugh.
“It's beautiful.”
“I like you. I merely tolerated the silly hat.”
After getting the rest of the groceries, they picked up a tree, then strapped it to the roof of the car, because it was just a little too tall to fit all the way into the car without turning down one of the front seats. And even then, it would have been a close call. While Cas seemed to worry most about the paint job on his car and eventually pulled out a mat to put under the tree, Dean's biggest concern was to get it fastened to the roof so it wouldn't fall off and crash some poor bastard's wind shield (and/or head).
Castiel stared at him for a moment. “Dean, you wouldn't need to work another day in your life.”
“You should go and make sure that they don't come here,” Eileen told him. “Someone will probably want to come look for us soon, but they'll listen to their Chief.”
Ezekiel looked like he wanted to say more, but then he straightened and turned, opening the doorway to Heaven. They had discussed this on angel radio, though not in great detail. It had been more of a 'Hey I want to do this, see you in a couple hours' kind of thing.
Everyone was staring at them now, and Dean's eyes were wide like the proverbial deer in the headlights – though perhaps an impala would be a more fitting allegory for him. An impala in the headlights of the Impala, he thought as he shrugged, shuffling on his feet a little.
“Stories of my demise are vastly exaggerated.” Gabriel waved them off. “Trickster, remember? You don't think I have a few tricks up my sleeve? Oh, and these people are-”
When Dean asked what he had gotten, Cas said it wasn't important.
Dean raised an eyebrow. “You want me to pay for your ass? What, like rent? Alimony? Help me out here, pal.”
“Yeah, well. I hope you'll feel connected to me when we get burgers.” Dean grinned as they both got into the car. “I know a place that should still be open. There's also this waffle place, but they're probably closed right now. We should go there some time, though.”
“Them.” Prince Castiel pointed to Dean, who froze, eyes wide.
Castiel blinked at him, then frowned. “Of course. Why would you...”
“Do you have another question?”
Yeah, I know, my update schedule is... not a schedule. It's really random. But I won't be home this weekend so I thought I'd give you the new chapter now.
Apparently, the kiss was all it took for Dean to settle down. “Hm-kay,” he mumbled, sounding content, and soon Castiel could hear – and feel, because they were connected that way, grace to soul, and this was probably the one thing Castiel would miss the most as a human – his breathing even out.
“Dean, there's no need to be nervous.” Silence. “Except if you've made some kind of deal with a malicious entity or otherwise endangered yourself or another member of our family. That would make me furious and you would have every right to be nervous.”
“I have a time piece,” Dean said, gesturing to it.
Jack frowned again. “No, you're made of opaque matter, actually.”
“Your presents not big enough for you or something? Come on, old man, you're holding up the line.” She grabbed one of her own presents and sauntered off.
“Uh, yeah. Haven't really left the rooms yet, to be honest, but lunch was so much, I took a nap afterwards and then it was five o'clock and well I tried writing a letter to Sammy, but after about an hour of staring at the paper I- are you alright?”
“I believe that's quite enough. If I have to hear one more word about this harlot-”
Sam scoffed and gestured inside the kitchen, where Maggie and Ryan were the only women. “So you're gonna let the men cook for you.”
Cas shuffled closer, leaning against him. He was still sensitive to the cold and didn't own winter clothing yet, hence the blanket over Dean's hand-me-downs. But he had adjusted to being human surprisingly quickly, even if he sometimes fell asleep at odd times and forgot to eat.
Dean took a sip of his coke. “Yeah, it was kinda silly. We should get you a better one, a Stetson or something. And some cowboy boots.”
Castiel chuckled, but before he could say anything, there was a knock on the door and then Jack stepped into the room.
“Dean.” He pulled him into a kiss, then kept beaming at him. “Everything is prepared, are you ready to go?”
Sam nodded thoughtfully. “You're probably right. Still, I'm gonna tell the others to be careful. We've been getting used to these things being reckless, but we should be prepared to deal with them even if they're not leaving obvious traces. You know, don't expect a weaker opponent just because they're being stealthy.”
Jack was still in the War Room, but he was slumped over on the table, the cookies and milk untouched before him. When Castiel came closer, he realized Jack was asleep, and he felt a rush of affection run through him. The boy had never had the possibility to really be a child, but he had kept the enthusiasm and joy of a toddler, despite everything he had seen, at least if Sam's and Mary's descriptions of little children were anything to go by.
“It's alright, Dean.” Once again, Castiel wasn't even sure what he was referring to – something that had happened, or the fact that he was crying? Dean always cared a great deal about seeming strong to other people, and though Castiel thought that they had come a long way with each other in that regard, he could imagine that Dean still felt ashamed about his tears. “Shhh. Tell me what's wrong.”
Dean came screaming while Cas sucked a mark into his skin.
“They're making it for everyone. You could ask if they still need a hand, but I think Maggie might implode if she has to coordinate any more people in there.”
“No, but...” Cas frowned. “I'm surprised. The only nickname I ever got is, well...” He glanced down into the courtyard, probably at where Gabriel was currently enjoying himself with his posse. “I like 'Cas'.” He made air quotes around his own nickname. Because of course he did.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Get over here.” He pulled Cas into a kiss by his shirt collar. It started out sweet enough, and Cas seemed happy to keep it that way, but then Dean slung his hands around Cas' neck and pulled him down with him. Taking the hint, Cas shifted so he was on top of Dean instead of half-way on top and half-way next to him at an awkward angle, and he intensified the kiss.
Dean chuckled. “Yeah, I'm kinda glad to have me back, too.”
“I know.” Cas ran a hand through his hair, messing it up even further than it already was. “I'm sorry.”
“What's going on?” Sam asked in confusion, and Cas repeated what they knew, signing for Eileen with one hand tightly wrapped around his angel blade.
Holy Heavens, he was getting cussed out by the King's brother.
“Do you wish for me to set your table, your highness?” they asked, for the first time sounding insecure.
“Cas,” Dean croaked out, hiding his face in Cas' neck even though they couldn't see each other in the dark, anyway. “Who the fuck cares about that? You don't have to fight, you don't have to be useful to us or some shit, you just... I don't want you to rush into this only to regret it afterwards.”
“Oh. No, nothing like that. I'll eat pretty much anything. Not big on fish though.”
“I love you.”
“Alright, you sap,” he said, trying to chase the tears away with a smile, “are ya gonna kiss me all night, or are we gonna fuck?”
“Shut up and tell me what you wanna watch.”
The person – Cassie? - sighed. “We didn't agree on anything, Gabriel. You told me that you knew a way to relax and I was foolish enough to follow you, but now that I know what you had in mind-”
Dean hesitated. He had had a variety of jobs, none of them glamorous, and none of them had paid enough to support Sam's studies. “This and that.”
“Cas,” he whispered when they broke apart, their faces still close, still able to feel each other's breath on their lips.
Cas looked at him in shock. “Uncle, contain yourself. Heavens.” He turned to Dean and the other employees at his table. “I am terribly sorry, I do believe he might be drunk-”
Castiel nodded. “Goodnight.”
“Tell me more,” the High Enchantress demanded, but Hester cut them off.
“Sure, sure.” Meg put a finger over his lips to silence him. “Forgiven and forgotten. Under one condition.”
“What do you mean?” he asked, stepping around her to walk to the meeting room.
They managed to track down the werewolves within a few hours, locating their base in a seemingly abandoned warehouse easily. The surrounding warehouses were full of stored meat and fish, so if it stank a little like rotten flesh around there, people would just assume a cooling device had failed. And if someone transported a few hearts, well, some people thought those things were a delicacy, and really, who would be able to tell that they were human hearts?
“Okay, but first of all, we're not even living in a desert and-”
“Cas, come on,” he whispered, sounding needy to his own ears, but Cas just smiled again and gave him what he wanted.
Dean rolled his eyes.
Cas did as he was told, wrapping a hand around his cock and pumping, looking at Dean the entire time. That might have been what dipped him over the edge, that intense stare, laser-focused on Dean, this wavelength of celestial intent looking at him, only him. Whatever it was, Dean came, cursing through it, and Cas followed him over the edge shortly after.
“Uh, like...” Dean frowned at them.
“You'll tell me if you want to stop.”
MacLeod regarded her over the rim of her cup. “Would you be terribly disappointed if I told you that I'm not omniscient?”
“You're beautiful,” Cas whispered as he slid a second finger into Dean.
“Hey guys,” she shouted to the room, “guess who's standing under the mistle toe.”
Well, maybe not the world, since Dean was officially dead and all. But still.
Mere seconds later, he had found the source of the delicious smell. Around a corner and down a sloped plane, someone was loading pies onto a big wooden table outside a set of plain doors. The pies were still steaming, and from the way the table was surrounded by a stone wall on three sides with no chairs to be seen, Dean thought they must be set there to cool.
“I'm sure you have better things to do than to... please me.”
“Wine, my prince?”
Castiel sighed into his glass. “I could probably use it. That's not why I'm here, though.”
That evening, Castiel knocked on the door between their rooms, and Dean called him in almost immediately. He found his companion once again lying on the bed, which seemed to be one of his favourite places, a book lying next to him.
“Are you sure you wanna do this?”
When he came back, he held the present out for Dean to see. Dean just shook his head, seeing Claire roll her eyes as she watched them from where she was standing with Alex and Patience. She was probably pretending to be annoyed, while secretly being pleased, that Cas liked it.
The baker raised an eyebrow. “You are free to take whichever you please. Those pies are meant for the denizens of the palace, after all. I would just humbly ask you to leave a few for the others.”
Gabriel snorted, and even Dean seemed amused.
“I can do that,” Dean called after her as she hurried back out into the corridor, leaving the door wide open.
“Fuck you, we both know you would've.”
Alright. There's a brief sex scene in here, but it's really just... two sentences or whatever. The rest is them being disgustingly sweet on each other. As it should be.
“Because of lunch...”
Castiel ran after him, fearing he had gotten hurt or that something displeased him, but he was just gaping at the tiled interior of the room.
Dean glared at him. “What high praise.” His heart was still beating a mile a minute, but that didn't stop him from being a little shit.
Dean stared at him. “You don't have to.”
Dean was a bit disappointed. “I see. Should I... I can call someone else who would please you more.”
Dean laughed. “Can't love 'em if you think they're stupid.”
“No. It takes more than a distorted tradition like this to be considered a worshipper. And unless we perform some intricate ritual or sacrifice, there is no reason any deity should take interest in us,” Cas told him.
“Yeah, that's part of what makes him sexy.”
After all this time, Dean thought that the sight of Cas practically naked should have been more than enough to get him horny, but all he really wanted was to be held, to be enveloped by those strong arms, to be protected. To feel safe.
“Dean, are you alright?”
“Uh. If you're... if you'd have sex with me.” Dean pressed his face against Castiel's chest.
“Pretty sure it was more for my sake than for yours, but yes.” Cas kissed his cheek.
“Marria-” Dean drew in a sharp breath.
“Hey, I didn't say anything.” There was a sparkle of humour in Dean's eyes, though.
“I'm not asking you to marry me right now, Dean,” Castiel assured him, and Dean instantly looked a bit calmer. “But I wish to share more of my life with you than just these few nights and whatever stories we can tell each other. I want you to be an integral part of my days.”
What he found made him stop in his tracks. There were a
“Yeah, sorry for almost bumping into you,” Dean said.
He thought for sure that Dean would be angry, or at least annoyed, but he only looked surprised.
“We both know it is hardly a surprise to find me here.” Gabriel waved his hand dismissively. “As I can see, you have already acquainted yourself with one of our fine employees. I figured you had an exquisite taste.”
“Love,” Cas managed to get out despite his moaning and heavy breathing, “y-you.”
After a moment, the baker answered: “Benny Lafitte. Also 'he'. It's nice to meet you, your highness.”
Dean hesitated. “Like I'm the prettiest thing you've ever seen.”
Dean blinked at him. “Because... well, I wouldn't dare try to liken the great warriors of the Heavens. My Prince.”
“Yes, it's me,” he whispered back, content when Dean turned the safety back on and put the gun under his pillow.
Then he remembered why he was on that couch, and he scrambled to his feet, only to find his bed empty. The covers were bunched up at the foot of the bed, and when Dean put a probing hand on the mattress, it was cold. So Prince Castiel must have left some time ago.
Then Cas stiffened, pushed him away a little and said his name urgently, a sure sign that there was danger nearby, probably behind Dean. He should have whirled around, should have fought or fled, but his body barely reacted, turned around oh so slowly, and before he knew it, the werewolf was almost on him. In the last moment, Cas pushed him out of the way, and Dean just so managed to catch himself on his hands. By the time he got back up, Cas had already decapitated the werewolf, but there were holes in the arm of the trench coat, blood pouring out of the bite marks where the wolves' fangs had pierced his flesh.
After closing the door, Jack sat down on the bed next to them, an open, expectant look on his face.
“That sounds... very nice, actually. But Dean, you don't have to do this for me. I know this life means everything to you, and-”
“That sounds good. I've never had waffles.” Castiel had eaten a variety of food in his time as a human, but most of it had been scraps of whatever he could find, whatever the shelter he had been at or the Gas 'n Sip had offered. Some of it had been warm and nourishing, and he had been grateful for all of it, but it hadn't exactly been something he had chosen.
“Well, some people only just got up, so for them, it's morning,” Gabriel replied, waving his hand dismissively.
“You didn't seem inclined to do it that way and I don't care which position we take in our sexual inter-”
“They do appear to share a bed quite regularly nowadays. I'm not sure why they don't simply move into a room together. Eileen still shares one with Maggie.” Cas tilted his head as Dean worked off his jacket. “Everyone knows about their relationship, anyway, so I don't see the point.”
Cas thought about it for a moment, and Dean's mood fell immediately. Why wouldn't he want to come along? Was he getting tired of being in bed with him? Actually, that might be true, considering he didn't sleep, so he would just be lying there, awake, not able to move or do anything, really.
Castiel pressed his lips into a thin line, but nodded. “There is precedence, you know. For a prince to settle beneath his station.” He had actually expected to have to cite these precedences, to convince his brother that this wasn't a complete disgrace to the crown.
Cas must have seen his look, because he gestured him over, so Dean took a seat on the floor beside him. “Sam is right, you know,” he started, back to concentrating on the lights, “Christmas doesn't need to have something to do with... God, or angels, or anything like that.”
It had still been a relatively new thing before Dean's possession, this... whatever it was, between him and Cas. After Jack had brought him back from the Empty, Dean had been able to keep it together in front of his brother, but when he had retired to his room and Cas had followed him to talk some more, something inside Dean had broken. He had held on to Cas as if his life depended on it, still hardly able to believe that this was real, that Cas was really back, and when he told him exactly that, suddenly there were tears in his eyes and he couldn't stop talking, couldn't stop telling Cas what it had been like, all the pain, all the hurt and grief.
“No. I've never been attracted to a single person in my life.” Castiel bit back the defeated sigh that almost slipped out of him.
“What?”
“No promises,” Dean answered slyly, and the baker's lips twitched upwards.
Dean considered him for a moment. Had he just called him hot? And had he suggested he become an independent sex worker? “You flatter me. But... Whatever I would make outside, it wouldn't be enough.” Dean bit his lip, thinking about Sam and his stupidly prestigious school. With the stupidly high fees.
“Woah, wait. Why am I the girl in this metaphor?”
“Right.” The frown eased a little.
“Alright, bucko,” Gabriel said teasingly, but not unkindly. “So, how are we gonna do this?”
The Crown Prince saw through the papers that Castiel had prepared, each word in it carefully weighed against the next. Michael strode over to a little table with a quill on it, made a few changes here and there, though overall less than Castiel would have expected.
“Can I go to the city, too? I haven't really been there in a while.” Dean hummed around a piece of meat. “Wait, could I visit the Academy?” He seemed to marvel at his own idea.
The next day, Dean told Cas that he had forgotten to pick something up and told him to go ahead with getting the cooled and frozen stuff while he would make a quick run to another shop at the mall. Instead, though, Cas argued that he needed to pick something else up as well, so they both went their separate ways and met in front of the grocery store about half an hour later. When Dean asked what he had gotten, Cas said it wasn't important.
“Yeah,” Dean said at length, watching the others instead of looking at his brother.
“Wh- what do you... There's a word for that?” He pulled back a little, staring down at Dean.
“You're more tense than I thought.” Dean bit his bottom lip. He really needed to be more careful with what he said to a literal Prince. This wasn't Gabriel, who seemed to take life as a cosmic joke. Dean wasn't sure what to make of Prince Castiel yet, but he was definitely more serious than his brother.
Dean sighed. “Yeah, but it's even more indecent than the others. Sorry. I'm just...”
“Eight years?” Dean gaped at him. “Wait, that means Gabr- I mean Prince Gabriel is thirty-four?” He had thought that they weren't that far apart in age, but Gabriel was ten years older than him. Holy shit.
“Yeah, well. Guess I'm getting old.” He stretched, hearing something crack in his back, and he scowled at himself. On the one hand, he had never expected to even get this old. Thirty-nine, forty in a month, that was an age most hunters never saw. Of course there were the exceptions: his dad, Bobby, Rufus... But most hunters, especially if they started young, didn't live to see forty. That was just simple maths – the more hunts you did, the higher the probability that one of them went sideways.
She stepped closer, putting the child down so she could yank his arm, inspect the bracelet. Dean held back a yelp as she almost dislocated his shoulder. After a moment, she was apparently satisfied that the bracelet was real, and stepped back, her eyes cold.
“If this is a dream, can you just give me a sign? I don't know, turn into a fly or breathe fire or something?” Dean pleaded – fucking pleaded – with Gabriel.
Shit. A few of the other employees giggled, but Dean snapped his jaw shut. Prince Castiel turned to him, for the first time sparing him more than a glance. Dean's eyes were fixed on the table top.
Castiel waved him off, not turning around because he didn't trust himself not to fall if he looked over his shoulder instead of the path in front of him. Maybe the thirst was what caused the light-headedness, or maybe it was just the drastic change from angel to human, but he stumbled more than once on the short way to the Impala.
“Ask you to be my companion.” Castiel took one of Dean's hands in his. “I know your answer probably hasn't changed, but I still need to try.”
Dean laughed, then put a hand in front of his mouth. Shit.
Dean turned to him to check: “Who?”
Dean moaned when Cas twisted his wrist, and he clamped a hand over his mouth to stifle it, bucked his hips to take Cas deeper, wanting, needing,
Dean nodded slowly. “Okay,” he said, sounding a little choked up, and Castiel leaned over to kiss his cheek.
“Yeah, whatever.” They watched as the angels filed out of the garage door one after the other, then zapped off. One of them threw a last, thoughtful look at Cas, who waved at them a little awkwardly.
“That's one word for it,” Dean muttered, earning some chuckles from the others. He had known that not everyone in Cas' family might agree with his visits to the Harem, but he hadn't thought it to be quite that bad. Most people nowadays were relaxed about this sort of thing, but Good Heavens, that man was clearly not.
Dean was beaming again. “Okay, but I gotta tell you, after that lunch my expectations for dinner are kinda through the roof.”
He kind of wanted to try something, but he wasn't sure if he was up to it and he didn't want to worry Cas in case he freaked out or something. Maybe they should just go to sleep.
Cas laughed. “I'm not sure he needs that, but it is a sweet idea. Though I'm afraid he will just hold it against me that I 'owe him one', as he would say.”
“No, Dean.”
That made Dean blush so hard it probably went all the way down to his toes, and he needed a moment to pull himself together before he could answer. “Oh, uh. Okay. Sure. Yeah. We can do that.”
Castiel didn't meet anyone, though he saw a light here and there in some of the bedrooms. He knew very well that some of the apocalypse world hunters barely slept, plagued by nightmares or their restlessness, and he had spent many a night working beside them on research, often trying and failing to take his own mind off Dean.
“You're a commoner.” It wasn't a question. She glared at him.
Dean hadn't seen Prince Castiel for two weeks, might have almost forgotten him if the others didn't constantly pester him with questions. Somehow, they couldn't believe that they hadn't fucked, thinking that Castiel must have either bribed or threatened him not to talk about it.
“Now that I have answered your questions, would you allow me one, too?” Dean asked, feeling bold.
“I couldn't possibly do that to you again.” The Prince frowned, sitting up. “I already feel guilty for last time.”
They didn't tell anyone about their plans for retirement or Cas giving up his grace right away, and no one seemed to have picked up on that thing between them yet, either, even if Dean's mom kept looking at them with a curious glint in her eyes. But Sam seemed to get more and more worried about Dean spending so much time in his room, and Dean was afraid he would try to get him out of his shell sometime soon, probably with a hunt. So before his brother could come up with anything interesting, Dean announced that him and Cas would drive over to the next big town to do some Christmas shopping, and asked everyone who needed something to put it down on a list. Cas added that they should write down their names next to the items so they could make sure to give it to the right person. Later, he told Dean that it might help him remember the people's names if he saw them written down.
So Cas really did know what the plan was here, and he hadn't protested.
Castiel regarded him thoughtfully, then said slowly: “Well, I haven't met him yet, so I can't really give an informed opinion about that. But whatever his suitability regarding the palace, I highly doubt that he's better suited to be here-” He gestured at the rooms about them - “than you.”
It was a smell that made him stop, sniffing the air like a blood-hound picking up the trail of its prey. Sam had often likened him to one whenever he caught this familiar scent, teasing him relentlessly. Dean had never cared, his mind too focused in those moments. He smelled freshly baked pie, and he wanted it.
Dean laughed. Or maybe it was more a bark. “'We', huh? You and Sam? Or is everyone else in on this, too, Jack, mom, the other hunters... They are, aren't they? Couldn't let them talk about it by accident, spoil the surprise. What the hell did you think would happen, I'd just never face a monster again, would never find out about what Michael did?”
Dean's hands were already clenched into fists on the couch, and he had to bite his lip to not cuss the guy out in revenge. He would have liked to punch him, too, break his nose and make him take back everything he had said. But he couldn't risk his job, so he kept as still as possible while trembling from anger.
Dean grinned at him. “No promises.” When Castiel frowned, he retracted: “I mean, of course not. Sorry. Uh, sometimes I say things without thinking and, uh...”
Cas moaned, his hips bucking ever so slightly off the bed, and he put a hand into Dean's hair again, as he often did during sex. “I don't care where your penis is, Dean, as long as you're close to me.” But his breathing was hard, and it hitched when Dean kissed his way down towards his hips.
“We know you killed your own counterpart in our world. This has caused some displeasure within our ranks, but I for one am grateful for it. No offence, Castiel, but your other version was a fanatic. He would no doubt have tried to stop us from leaving.”
“Oh, I dunno. Maybe you could tell Cassie here all about the pleasures of the flesh.” Prince Gabriel was grinning mischievously.
A knock startled Castiel out of his reverie. He had made the same calculation three times, resulting in three different figures, and he rubbed his eyes wearily, hoping Dean was back. He had told him not to disturb him until lunch, but at this point, Castiel could really use some distraction.
“Goddammit, you dork.” Dean pushed into him with one swift motion until he bottomed out.
They got everything that didn't need to be cooled or watered that day, then went looking for a motel. There was one relatively close to the shopping centre they'd been in, and it didn't even look half bad, so they booked themselves a room. To his credit, Dean only blushed mildly when Cas told the lady at the reception desk that they would only need one bed.
“Almost. Perhaps we could stand on the railing, we should get a good view from there,” Cas suggested, and Dean nodded. When they went outside, there were already a few other people on the railing in front of other rooms, waiting in twos or threes, sometimes more.
Not that Cas was 'someone new', thank you very much. But Sam never seemed to have connected the dots, never thought of them in a romantic setting. Maybe Dean had played straight so convincingly that Sam had never even questioned it. Then again, lots of people seemed to have figured him out long before that mistle toe thing. It just seemed odd that of all people, his brother would have been fooled the most.
“M-hm,” he made, already dozing off. The last he knew was that Cas pressed a kiss to the side of his face.
“No.” Prince Castiel gritted his teeth. “No, I just...”
“Okay,” Sam said, nodding. “That doesn't mean we can take you in or anything, we- we have the hunters from apoca- from that world here, they're not going to like the angels from their world barging in.”
“The what?” Dean stared at him. Who was getting crowned? Had something happened to the king? No, it must be a coronation in a different kingdom. But why did they need to prepare anything, then?
“Oh. Another gender then?” Dean sounded curious.
He pulled the first string. All the lights went out. Another pull. All the lights went on again.
“What are you looking at?” Dean asked with pretend gruffness. “Shouldn't you get to your own presents?”
Castiel smiled. “Maybe.” Then he leaned in, but stopped before their lips touched. “Can I kiss you?”
“Thank you, by the way.”
“I'm sorry.” It sounded genuine.
“Gabriel and me are eight years apart. Is that an aeon to you, then?” The Prince's face still looked serious, but there was a amused tone in his voice. He had rolled over onto his side, propped up on his elbow, head in hand.
Ezekiel shrugged. It looked almost comical, this great warrior confined to the small frame of a child. “It's not exactly a task that will bring glory, but it is necessary.”
Dean had half-expected some commentary from the sidelines, but when he looked at the others, he found that even Claire's eyes were shiny, if not wet yet.
Or soft and sweet, like right now. “Perfect,” he groaned, because Cas with sweat glistening on his body, his hair damp and clinging to his head in messy strands, and smiling up at him? Yeah, that was very much perfect.
“You don't like it?” Cas asked, and Dean didn't even protest when he took away the carton, which still held a last slice of pizza, and placed it on the bedside table.
Cas sighed. “Do we have to?”
“They can wait another day. Let's just... stay here and watch whatever crappy soap opera is on TV right now. I'd even endure Dr. Sexy for you right now.”
“I understand.” Dean reached out with his hand, gingerly touched Cas' face. “You look tired.”
“Sam has been taller than you for years,” he dead-panned, making Sam and Mary laugh while Dean turned to scowl at him. Though by the time he turned back to his plate, Dean was smiling, too. Huh. Sam had expected him to give Cas far more shit for that comment. But maybe he was too tired, or too glad to finally be back.
“You're lucky I don't actually need to breathe.” Cas sighed. “You know I could just easily throw you off, right?”
Cas was moving his mouth, probably saying his name, but all Dean could hear were his own thoughts, screaming at him, images so close to breaking through the surface that it was almost painful, and he could feel himself starting to drown again...
A slight smile tugged on Dean's lips. “Yeah? Not getting tired of me yet?”
“No,” he said thoughtfully, and Dean frowned until he continued: “
“I don't know,” Dean whispered. “I just- it's so much. I don't know.”
Castiel sighed. “You don't have to... No, never mind.” He opened his eyes. “It's silly of me to think we could speak as equals. I'm a Prince. You would probably be polite to me even if you hate me, just like everyone else.”
“Well it is a hundred percent more.”
“Dude, I can't believe you actually kissed Cas.” Sam huffed, looking more amused than anything when Dean came over to him and Mary. “You know you could have gotten away with a kiss on the cheek, right?”
In Dean's absence, Mary had sometimes talked to Castiel about his childhood, on those nights were she was one of those plagued by insomnia. They had been tales of a happy child, who had loved hugging people and could rattle on about the stones and flowers he had found outside for hours. Jack didn't talk about those kinds of things, but Castiel thought it was similar to how he could go on about a show he had watched, or even whatever lore he had discovered or learned from Sam.
“Yeah.” Dean turned to him and they kissed again to the background of colourful sparks forming more hearts.
Cas kissed his knee cap – the sap – but eventually his finger found home, sliding slowly into Dean. At first it was weird, an intrusion more than anything, and Dean probably would have tensed if Cas hadn't continued to cover him in kisses, even placing an open-mouthed one on his cock, making him gasp. And then Cas' finger was all the way in, moving in him gently but with determination, and Dean remembered why he liked this. It didn't take long before Cas found the right angle, brushing against that sweet spot and yeah, he
“She's amazing, full stop. I think Jack loves her just as much as he loves Sam.”
Taking a deep breath, Dean forced himself to take one of his presents, weighing it in his hands with wonder. Under his name, in small writing, the tag said 'From: Mom'. He got actual fucking Christmas presents from his mom now, apparently, wrapped up all nice and tidy. (Well, okay, maybe not tidy. He might have to give her lessons on how to wrap presents properly, though at least this told him that she had definitely done it herself.)
“You've been sitting at your desk too much. Time for another massage, huh?”
“Ah.” Dean nodded as if he completely understood how magic worked and how that might be possible. “Cool. Thanks.” He ducked back into his rooms.
“Cas, if you still feel that way tomorrow... Ask me again, okay? It's fine if you don't, but... if you really mean this...” He didn't dare end that sentence.
The guard glanced at their companion. “Pretty sure it's magic.”
This time, Dean smiled. “She's good for him.”
There was a long pause in which Dean covered his eyes with his hand. He didn't really want to see Cas' reaction.
Prince Gabriel put a hand over his heart in mock shock. “But Cassie. If I can't even call my own beloved brother by a nickname, then what has this world come to?”
“Uh.” Dean bowed. “Your highness?” It was a question, because he had no idea who she was or what her status was. Her clothes seemed fancy, though.
It did nothing. When he pierced the werewolf with the knife, the thing only laughed and sent him flying again, and this time his shoulder hit a metal edge, sending spikes of pain through his arm and back.
He closed the window again, turning towards his rooms. There was one door he hadn't explored yet, but he had an idea where it led. When he opened it, he saw another bedroom, almost a mirror image of his own, even similarly decorated. Dean smiled, then closed the door again. He wouldn't go through Cas' room when he wasn't there, that just felt wrong, despite how curious he was.
Cas complied, grabbing the lube, though not before pressing a lingering kiss to Dean's lips. Before long, one of his fingers was tracing Dean's hole, just drawing tighter and tighter circles.
“It just seems unfair to me that human children get all the wonder and mystery while he gets none.”
“Oh. So what, she's like, Mrs. Chief now?”
“We'll keep this around,” Gabriel called after them, holding up the vial. “Just in case you need it at some point, after all.”
The lady had her elbow on the table, and propped her chin up in her hand. “Does he come with a recommendation, then?” She smirked again.
He had read a lot about parent-child relationships before, and also after, Jack's birth, and several sources had pointed out that children generally didn't like if their parents started dating someone new. And event though Dean had been close with the Bobby of this world, this was a different version, from a world where Sam and Dean never existed, one who didn't have much history with the brothers except what had happened in the last few months.
But before Sam could leave, Dean asked: “Wait, what about food? I haven't eaten in, like, half a year.”
“Thank you,” he mumbled.
“Really?” he asked, once again looking entirely serious. “Because I haven't seen any money exchanged for this purchase.”
“Oh no, it was my fault, I should have watched where I was going. H-how is your hand? I am so sorry about that, I-” They winced.
Not a single muscle betrayed any emotion on the butler's face as they bowed again. “I'll see what I can do, your highness. Are there any specifications to your diet I should convey to the kitchens?”
“You know, you haven't told me yours yet.” Dean should just let him leave, shouldn't rope him into staying with him. What good was there to it? It wasn't like they could become friends, not with Castiel being a gods damned prince, and he was certainly not interested in Dean. But knowing that didn't stop his tongue from acting up. “The expectations placed on you?”
“Sure, sure, Prince Castiel, primrose of the desert isle, brave warrior of the morning Sun-”
“What, no minutes?” Dean joked, and felt warmth rise in him when a humorous glint appeared in Cas' eyes.
“You know, it wouldn't be greedy to stay.”
“Hey, buckos. Miss me?” Gabriel smirked. Glancing around the library, he added: “Still living in an underground cave, huh? Very 50's.”
“The wh- you mean Santa?”
Cas brushed his lips behind Dean's ear. “I would never do something you don't want.”
“Alas, then I fear that on top of being a snob, I am also a hypocrite.” Castiel turned back to his notes, drew up a sheet with price comparisons, wrote down a peculiarity he had noticed. His head had still been running through the numbers, even when talking with Dean.
“No, my Prince. It is nothing quite that... distinguished.” His first instinct had been to say fancy. “It is meant to depict a simple hunt, featuring nameless hunters.”
Gabriel grinned. “Fine. Under one condition.”
“We can eat later and I'm sure your work can wait a couple minutes, too. You said you don't have any meetings today.” Dean had already moved on the bed, sitting behind Cas' back now, kneading his shoulders.
Castiel let out something that could have been a snort. “I'm not going to break. It's alright.”
“You liked it,” Dean told him, stealing a fry off his own plate that stood in front of Cas.
Before Dean could reply anything, another person came through the rift. And then another, and another. It didn't seem to want to stop.
“Then let us hope it will be enough for him, too. For your sake.”
Now Cas craned his neck to look at Sam, too. “We have a lawn?”
“I'm the youngest. I hardly hold any authority as it is, I can't make my siblings do anything.”
Huh. However the fuck that worked, he thought, shaking his head at all the strange magic that was apparently totally normal around his place. And why where there so many lights for just one single room? It filled him with a buzz and his skin prickled, as if the air around him was charged with energy. Not that it hurt or anything, but he had taken a while to get used to all the magic lights at the Harem, and he was sure it would take some adjusting here, too. He pulled the second string.
“Hm?”
more.
Now it was almost midnight, the big finale of the festival inching closer, and Castiel had finally managed to extricate himself from the crowd and the awkward conversations about petunias and the latest robe fashion. He checked on a few people before leaving, seeing the Crown Prince engaged in discussion with a minor noble and her son and Hester tending to her children, in a corner as far away from her husband as possible. Then he stuck his head into the kitchens, getting confirmation that yes, my Prince, everything is according to schedule, no we are not out of flour, yes there are still raisins, before he finally made his way to the Harem.
“Some people do not eat meat, or only certain kinds, or have an aversion to certain foods,” the butler listed patiently.
The hand on his knee was travelling higher, up his thigh, when Gabriel appeared next to their table.
Life was weird.
“Then we have half the age difference that you two have. Does that mean I get to consider you a baby, too?” Castiel asked with a straight face.
Not that he thought that was going to be a problem tonight.
Dean's heart missed a beat. “Yeah?” His voice sounded raspy, his throat suddenly dry.
Dean turned away, probably to hide his red-rimmed eyes, and Castiel squeezed his hand, letting his grace speed up the recovery of the slight swelling.
Cas sighed. “Sometimes it feels like I planned everything, though I know that others helped.”
“Yeah. Like. From hunting. From the life, you know. Get off the road, find a place to settle down. I hear California is nice. We could... go to the beach, drink cocktails all day, just you and me... uh, maybe Sam and Eileen too, or mom or Jack, if they wanna.” Dean bit his lip, fearing he wouldn't stop talking otherwise.
“Are you attracted to men?”
“That's right,” Sam said, frowning. “I'm actually surprised you were patient enough to only ask now. Knowing you, I would have thought you'd be crankier.”
Thomas' eyes lit up and he thanked him about a dozen times. Judging from the way he glanced over at one of the other hunters sheepishly, Dean was pretty sure their intuition had been right.
Cas snorted. “Okay, fine. But I would have put up more of a fight.”
Castiel thought about it. “Yes.”
Cas looked torn, then sighed and ran a hand over his face. “Unofficially... no one has any clue as to his whereabouts. He might be alive somewhere, or he may indeed be dead, but we haven't heard from him in ten years.”
Cas averted his eyes. “Hester, yes. She came to me.”
Okay. So. I know it's been two months. And I don't really have much to say in my defense except that life's a piece of shit (okay, more like depression is a bitch, but, ya know).
“Thank you.” Cas did something with the blanket so the hand was mostly wrapped up again while still holding the glass steady and Dean sat down next to him on the hood of the Impala. It was still a little warm, but getting cooler every minute it stood there on the gravel path. Well, if it got too cold, they could always resettle inside the car.
“Nameless?” Prince Castiel finally turned all the way towards him. “Why?”
Dean's heart missed a beat or two as he struggled to understand what Cas was saying. He hadn't seen anyone who looked like him over there. Though maybe he had been wearing a different vessel. “You... Are you sure?”
The moment Castiel's eyes found Dean, he froze. Dean was sitting on a couch, awfully close to the person next to him, pouring them wine and smiling sweetly. Castiel felt his heart crack, realizing once again that this was Dean's job, that he was paid to be nice to everyone. Castiel wasn't special.
“Yes, Dean, I know. I was there.”
More confused blinking. “Because it needs to be done.”
“So what do you think?” Dean asked, making Cas tilt his head in that cute way of his. “Your first taste of alcohol as a human, right?”
The room was still mostly silent, though the whispers grew a little bolder, the giggles a little louder. Castiel was staring at Dean and Dean stared back, feeling his own nerves acting up.
“Okay. Just checking. 'Cause we could still go back, you know.”
“Or we could make the best of you still having them. No? No. Okay.” Dean got up with a sigh to fetch a towel.
“We need to get you some beer later. That'll be better,” Dean told him, and Cas smiled.
“We're talking about you, Dean. When I first met you, you were barely able to see your own worth. I had hoped that had changed over the years, but obviously you need to be reminded every now and then.”
Dean's room was through the yard, up a flight of stairs, a few steps down a corridor. It wasn't far, but his skin was full of goosebumps, and not all of them from the fresh winter air. Though it didn't help that he was only wearing a robe.
“Um,” Maggie made, raising her hand tentatively. She had been part of the last grocery run, and now she looked terrified as she glanced at Sam, probably praying for help.
“Ah, yes.” Castiel hesitated. “It does appear unfair that only you 'spilled your secrets', as it were.” He made air quotes again. What a dork. But he also laid back down, on his back this time, and Dean counted that as a win.
Dean froze in his arms. “Huh.”
Why was Gabriel sitting so close to him and where was that hand that he couldn't see behind the table?
“Apologies, we're not here to discuss my sister's marriage. Perhaps she did, at one point, love her spouse.” He frowned. “Anyway, as I grew up, I realized that whatever I did, however much I worked and succeeded, it was never going to be enough. Certainly not for our father. But also not for my siblings. I think they were all so used to giving their all that... Well. Maybe I also just didn't register with them very much. They were all older than me and they all seemed to think that I was someone else's problem.”
“I mean, Castiel. Uh, my prince.” Dean bowed, almost knocking his head against the glass in Cas' hand.
“What? Never seen a nice ass before?” That was a lame one, he had to admit to himself, especially considering Cas had seen his ass before, and a lot more naked than right now. Hell, he had been inside his ass before.
She waved a hand dismissively, reminding him, of all things, of Gabriel. “You can drop the charade now, I know Castiel would never do something this... inappropriate.”
“Castiel!” She sounded scandalized. “Are you mocking me? You mean to tell me that
“You should have seen me cross it, and I wasn't there.” Castiel nodded. “Again, I am so-”
“Hester, I think you will find that once you get to know Dean, you will-”
“Look, there's something you probably don't know, because you didn't know him before, well, before he knew you. But he's always been kind of distant. Some might even say cold. There's few people he's ever smiled at, and I mean really smile, not the fake thing he plasters on his face for guests. It's not like he was emotionless or anything, but his only emotions seemed to be annoyance and anger.”
“Oh? My mistake.” There was a trace of laughter in Cas' voice as he carded a hand through Dean's hair. Shit, that felt nice. “I suppose then I must get up alone to celebrate Christmas with everyone else.”
The baker blinked at him in surprise just as the other person – Lily – came rushing back. “I'm so sorry, but there was this-” Seeing Dean, they shut their mouth immediately.
Dean noticed him standing in the distance and gave him a small smile. Castiel clenched his fists and walked away.
“Aw, they grow up so fast,” Dean teased, and Cas frowned.
“Do you speak from experience?”
“Yeah. Whatever.”
“Come on, I'm not gonna break,” Dean teased, even though he didn't really mind the pace. This felt nice, making his body tingle with anticipation.
He didn't try anything on, though he felt a little underdressed for his surroundings in his plain yellow robe. Not that there was anyone else around to judge him, though, because these were his rooms. Holy fuck.
When they were both spent, Dean pulled out and flopped down on the mattress next to Cas, face first. When he peered up at him and saw the dopey smile on Cas' face, he was once again struck with the truth of those words: Love of his life.
“You just did,” Dean replied cheekily.
“Thanks, Data. Almost seven months ago. So, yeah. Do you have like a book with their photos and all the names, or do they have name tags or...?” Dean raised his eyebrows, looking at Sam.
“What? No.”
“Cas,” Dean groaned, feeling himself harden in the big hand wrapped around him.
Some guy was bothering Dean and he didn't even know who he was.
“Like I could sleep for a week,” Castiel mumbled.
“Ah, you talked to Uriel. He loved that expression.” Gabriel shook his head. “Anyway, let's not argue about semantics. I think Castiel might die from thirst otherwise.”
Dean was silent for a while, but when Castiel wouldn't calm down, he said: “Stop laughing at me.”
Castiel rolled his eyes. “This is not just because of my relationship to Dean.”
Now that wasn't exactly helpful in calming Dean down. His heart still worked extra every time Cas said that, and Dean could feel his face heat up.
“Here. You should drink something, you probably haven't had any water since-” Cas bit off his own words and helped Dean take a few sips, then put the bottle back down.
“Right.” Dean could feel himself blush, not even sure why he was reacting that way.
“Good day, my prince. Give your boy my regards.”
“Seven, almost,” Cas corrected him, and Dean huffed out a laugh.
“That would be most thoughtful of you, your highness.” The butler bowed again and Dean remembered to bow back, then he was alone with the food.
Cas fiddled with some heart-shaped decorations for a bit that seemed to be made out of straw, but then he put them down again and pulled Dean further aside. “The Charlie from apocalypse world... She took off pretty much as soon as she got to this world, remember?” Dean nodded. “Sam managed to convince her to come back, to work with us, at least every now and then. I think they became friends. I suppose it is thanks to him that her behaviour towards me is civil.”
“He's fine. There was a moment... After he stabbed you, well, Michael, and it looked like you were... For a second, we weren't sure if you would make it.” Cas turned to him with those puppy eyes that Dean both loved and hated, just because they always made him feel mushy inside. “He was devastated. He has never killed someone deliberately before, and if you had died along with Michael, I'm not sure...”
Dean's head snapped up so fast that it almost collided with Castiel's chin. “What the hell? I-” He glared at Castiel. “Listen, I know I'm shit about this kind of stuff and- and you deserve better, but... You know this is just my own bullshit, right? It's not because of you. And I
Dean had followed him and was now staring at the bracelet. “Is that solid gold? Holy hells.”
“Well, I can detect no meddling, magical or otherwise.” She took another sip from her cup. “Unless you count the unusually high amount of caffeine in his system for such an early Sunday morning, but that is hardly my metier.”
Cas stayed silent for a while, and Dean thought that was the end of it, but then he suddenly said: “Not entirely. It's true that healing you took quite a bit of my grace, but it was low in the first place. And not just because of Michael.” Again, there was a stretch of silence, but Dean didn't dare say anything. Eventually, Cas continued: “It's Heaven, Dean. It's... There are only few angels left, and even down here on Earth, I can feel it. It's... draining me, for lack of a better word. Heaven runs on the power of the angels' graces, and with only about a handful up there...”
“I did.” Cas got up from his chair and walked over to him slowly. “You didn't mean to pray.”
“You know what I love?” Dean asked, managing to only blush slightly, “When you smile.” Because he really did. As much as he loved all those faces he pulled, the best were always his smiles. Big, wide, gums showing, the corners of his eyes crinkling.
It wasn't that he didn't understand where Cas was coming from with the clothes and the shoes, and even he had to admit that what everyone in the palace wore was far more elegant than anything Dean had ever owned. But even just the few pieces in his wardrobe that Cas had apparently ordered to bridge the time until he got tailored clothing made his stomach clench when he thought about wearing it. It didn't suit him. He was a simple man, and he neither needed nor wanted all that frippery that people around here called fashion.
“Dean. You need to let go so I can get up,” Castiel told him, but Dean just grumbled something unintelligible.
Cas frowned. “Does it matter? Well, perhaps it does to you. That's my third point, actually. You humans seem to care so much about gender, both in terms of roles and regarding romantic and sexual attraction...”
“Dean?” he asked, after his knocking hadn't been answered. When there was still no reaction, Castiel opened the door just a crack, stuck his head inside the room to check if Dean was there.
“For the moment, yes. Have you eaten yet?”
Castiel was so lost in thought that he almost ran into Dean when he stopped in the doorway. Glancing over his shoulder, Castiel saw Claire, leaning against the table with a smirk on her face, apparently waiting for them.
“Then all that is left is for me to wish you a good day.”
“But you do get horny?” Dean's grip tightened on Castiel's robe. “Shit, I'm just constantly putting my foot in my mouth today, huh? Forget I said anything.”
The sex scene is pretty well announced I would say, starts after they kiss in the motel and lasts 'til the end of the chapter – just in case you wanna skip it. :)
“Undoubtedly.” Prince Castiel looked at him for a long moment. “Can I ask you for something... indecent?”
Dean kissed him. Mean princesses aside, he was really starting to like his new life.
God, that was an awful way of describing sex, but... “Yeah. Yeah, uh. I wanna try, though. I mean, it's just sex, there's nothing bad about it. And sure, it hurts, but in the good way.” Again, Dean blushed deeply at the admission that being fucked felt good for him.
“Hey.” Dean decided to face the music, get it out of the way. He tried to sound jovial, but probably failed miserably. “So I met your sister this morning.”
“That's stupid,” Dean said without thinking, then frowned. “I mean. Didn't she die from tetanus?”
“You want to move up in the world?” The Prince's face said 'through this'? It annoyed Dean even more, reminding him of his father.
With that, he was off the couch, and striding towards where Dean was.
Dean hadn't been too pleased with how detached that sounded at the time, but now he was wondering what Cas would think about it without his grace. As a human, would he still be so nonchalant about a finger in his ass?
“I can only assume. I haven't been invited yet and haven't asked if those tea parties include mad magicians and heads being chopped off.” There was a twinkle of humour in the baker's eyes, and Dean laughed.
Cas did end up eating two burgers, though only because Dean let him steal his. He wasn't actually hungry anyway, definitely not as much as his freshly human boyfriend, and he figured he could pay him back for all the times he had stolen fries off Cas' plate, even if Cas hadn't needed to eat at the time.
Dean considered that, then pressed even harder into his back.
Before he got under the covers, Cas pulled a time piece out of his robe.
“Well, that's a surprise. Didn't think you had such a low self-esteem.” Gabriel hummed. “I think he sees a man who is honest to himself and others, which I can assure you is a refreshing change of pace from the palace. And I think you inspire him to be a little more honest, too, even if it's just in little ways.” Gabriel smirked. “He also probably sees you as a hot piece of ass.”
“What about what you want?” Dean placed his hand over Cas' on his stomach. “You'll get tired of me if you see me every night.”
His mom and Bobby – the other Bobby, as Sam had to remind himself – were sitting at the table, eating breakfast, while Maggie was busy doing the dishes.
“I'm not sure if he requires any porn, considering the frequency of Eileen's visits to his room.” Dean almost dropped the tie at Cas' words.
“Smells good in here,” someone suddenly said behind Sam, and he jumped a little, whirling around to find Charlie grinning at him, with Rowena trailing behind her. “Do we have to help if we wanna eat, or...?”
“Where is he now? Still in the city?”
“I was going to say you were being awfully cocky, but you'd just go ahead and make a bad pun about that, too.”
“I suppose it
“Ladies, Dean, this is my brother Cassie,” Prince Gabriel introduced the guy.
“Aren't you?”
Dean shrugged. “They didn't say. Let's find out.”
He hadn't had time to visit Dean for two weeks, and it was probably obvious to everyone who knew him even a little. His whole body was tense, his back hurting, though that may be because he had fallen asleep at his desk a couple of times. And yet, after all this work, after the meticulous planning and the shouting matches with Crowley, he was still not free. Today was the worst part, actually. After everything, now he was expected to socialize.
“Hey, has anyone seen Cas?” Sam asked as he walked into the kitchen.
“And how old are you?” Castiel frowned. “Either you are much older than you look, or you have no right calling your brother a baby.”
“Cas.” Dean's voice was unsteady. “Don't say that. What the hells.” He grabbed one of Cas' hands, barely registering that it was still full of lube. “Did you have too much wine? Is that why you're saying this?”
Still, seeing the scowl on Dean's face as he tried hard not to move, Castiel decided to indulge him once more. “There is nothing wrong with your clothes, Dean, but they are hardly fitting for the palace.”
“Ah, yes. Meeting yourself can be... difficult.” Castiel shifted on his feet. Ezekiel followed the movement with several of his eyes – not the human ones. It was one of the countless habits Castiel had picked up from the humans over the years.
“I know. There's precedence for kings, even.” There was a far-away look on Michael's face, but he shook out of it quickly. “If that is all...”
“Of course. I didn't mean to keep you.” Dean bowed slightly, not getting very far with one knee hugged to his chest.
“Can,” Cas argued, squinting at him, and Dean couldn't help but think that yeah, maybe you could love something you thought was stupid. Just like he loved the way Cas tilted his head when he was confused, or this very squint when he was angry or pretending to be angry, or his stupid ass jokes and sarcasm.
That actually managed to get a laugh out of Dean. The first of the night. “True. Should've thought that one through.”
“It's okay, Dean. You need to sleep.” He leaned back down to kiss his head and landed somewhere around his ear. Even though he still had a better sense of orientation in the world than most humans, especially in the dark, it wasn't what it used to be. With Heaven's power fading, he supposed that giving up his grace might at some point be more of a symbolic gesture, at least if no one did anything about it. He shuddered when he thought of Heaven's gates closing, or, worse, Heaven ceasing to exist. What exactly would happen then, he didn't know – Heaven had existed since before he had been created, a constant in his life as much as the 'mysterious ways' of their Father. But it couldn't be good. All those souls would need to go somewhere, and Earth was the closest dimension, in a sense.
But Mary had either not heard Sam, or ignored him, because she went over to the tree without further comment.
“Ugh. What high praise.” Dean let his finger wander to Cas' hole regardless, just drawing smaller and smaller circles there without breaching the ring of muscle yet.
“You say that as if I couldn't do that in reality,” Gabriel scoffed, then grinned at him. “If it's any consolation, I think Cassie is doing the right thing. Or at least I hope so.”
“Ah, ah.” Prince Gabriel grabbed his arm, pulling him back. “Come now, Cassie. We agreed that you need to relax and the best way to do that is with some good company.” He gestured to the crowd of Harem employees.
“What?” Cas sounded confused. “Oh, but I- I know you don't see me that way. I'm just another client.”
He was almost sure – almost – that he was of the Royal Family, what with the crest on the pin on his chest. Cas had once explained to him that all the princes and princesses wore it, but this guy seemed a bit too old to be the king's child. He looked more like a bureaucrat, though with the temper of a drunken sailor.
“No, we only have family dinner once every two weeks, and that's still another week off. So we're free to do as we please.” Castiel kissed him again, just because he could. “So we can eat here and then I'll show you around.”
After one and a half weeks, though, the others had mostly grown tired of bugging him and had turned to other, even juicier gossip. Dean encouraged it, not really caring about any scandals, but glad that he wasn't the centre of attention anymore.
“Uuuuh, something edible? I'd really like something warm, but it's cool if the kitchen's closed or whatever. Is the kitchen ever closed? Anyway, a snack would be amazing, too, if you know what I mean,” he blabbered, feeling more inadequate by the second.
Dean took his time chewing and swallowing, his mind suddenly drifting to the future. Once Cas was human, he wouldn't be able to heal anything anymore. And if they really did retire, they wouldn't spend their time chasing after monsters, either. Instead, they would probably have a routine, maybe have three proper meals a day. Perhaps even home cooked? If he wasn't a hunter anymore, he might get to be... wow, he might actually get to be eighty years old or something like that. Which would mean another forty years, spent in peace, maybe somewhere at the beach, or in a little cottage somewhere. In any case, with Cas.
Dean put a hand on his shoulder. “You work too much.”
However, Cas didn't seem to get the memo of 'we should hold back', because he kept kissing Dean all over, his mouth grazing Dean's nipples, as he whispered endearments into his skin that made Dean's ears flaming red.
“Hey,” Dean replied with a smile, and Cas immediately mirrored his expression, except a million times brighter. It was a miracle that his face didn't split in half with that wide a smile.
“Yeah, well. I have faith for the both of us.” Dean grinned when Cas raised an eyebrow at him. “What? I have faith nowadays. Not in God or angels or whatever, but in... in us.” He blushed, tried to cover it up by taking a drink from his glass. “In you.”
“Jack still awake?” she signed, knowing he could understand her perfectly without her speaking.
“Eileen likes it.” Mary wiggled her eyebrows and Dean whistled.
Most people ignored them as they came in, some smiled when glancing in their direction, others frowned. Unfortunately, the last group included Sam, who looked to Eileen with an uncertain look on his face, as if he still couldn't quite believe what was going on. Eileen just rolled her eyes.
“Yes, yes, I'm here.” She stepped out of another chamber, holding a cup full of steaming liquid. Whether it was some kind of potion or a simple tea, Castiel wouldn't dare to guess. “Sit down, sit down, we don't have all day. I have a visitor in twenty minutes.”
“Uh, yeah. Peachy,” Dean replied, but that only served to deepen Cas' frown.
Dean was standing in front of the bed, on which lay a book. “Cas!” He came towards him, beaming.
Dean was actually kind of glad that the Prince's back was so full of kinks, because at least that distracted him and kept his blood, mostly, in his head.
That evening, as they lay snuggled in his bed, Dean asked: “Are you gonna sleep here every night?”
“With Lisa.” Dean closed his eyes. Remembering Lisa and Ben had been painful for a long time, especially after he had asked Cas to erase their memories. But now, he found that he could think of them fondly. He was grateful for the time with them, even if it hadn't lasted.
He supposed from now on, Castiel should think of them as 'other people' instead of humans.
Then it was fully gone, and he blinked a few times before looking down again, feeling light.-headed. The cut on his throat hurt, he realized, touching it to find blood on his fingertips. His mind was blank and yet a whirlwind, and he wasn't sure if he wanted to sing and dance or fall to his knees and cry.
“Yes, of course. Now that you're here.”
Dean looked at her in surprise, then saw Gabriel winking at him and got up quickly.
Prince Castiel sighed contentedly and stirred when Dean let up his ministrations. It must have been at least a half an hour, and his arms were getting tired.
Well, without Sam, because he hadn't been born yet.
“I don't mind. Do you want to lay down?”
Dean hadn't seen Prince Castiel for two weeks, might have almost forgotten him if the others didn't constantly pester him with questions. Somehow, they couldn't believe that they hadn't fucked, thinking that Castiel must have either bribed or threatened him not to talk about it.
“It's good.” Dean wiggled his fingers. “No harm done. I'm just glad we didn't lose any of the pies.”
“Well, I'm not sure this is part of your job. Also indecent might be the wrong word. Rather... invading?” That sounded awful, and Dean raised an eyebrow. Castiel sighed. While he had liked that Dean hadn't initiated any unwarranted physical contact last time, Castiel had found himself wondering the last two weeks. “Can I hold you?”
They lay like that for a while until Dean started to drift of, one of Cas' hands in his hair and the other one on his hip.
“You think my puns are bad?” Cas asked with a pout.
“Fuck. Cas, touch yourself.”
“Would you like another massage then?”
“He does have his charm. In a very weird, and often very gross kind of way,” Castiel agreed, staring off into space. Then he shook his head and smiled at Dean. “I'm glad you're not mad.”
Despite himself, Castiel began to laugh.
Hester turned a furious shade of red.
“Uh, not really.”
“I'm not convinced it will, but we can try.”
Gabriel. The Harem. The... what had Gabriel called him?
“Hey bro,” Gabriel said, stepping closer. “So you're really gonna do it, huh.”
The person arranging the pies ducked through the doors, only to come back out with several more plates full of baked goodness a few moments later, depositing them next to the others. When Dean came closer, the person looked up briefly, but then continued with their work, going back through the doors.
“You could say that.” Castiel snorted. “I barely ever saw him as a child. All I knew was that he was constantly having meetings, and that a lot of my siblings were invited, but I was too young. I think that's part of why I worked so hard, trying to get into those meetings. Of course nowadays I'm part of them, but he is...”
“Hm. The sight of me inside your ass will do that to me,” Dean replied with forced cheerfulness.
“Sleep, my Prince. You can worry about the appropriateness again tomorrow.”
“Hello, Dean. What are you reading?” Castiel stepped into the room, closing the door behind him.
“There's a door between our rooms. You can lock it, of course,” Castiel hastened to say.
Castiel frowned. “Have you lied to me?”
“What about your... do you have another parent?” The Prince's voice was soft again, and Dean wondered how such a deep voice could sound this kind.
“Oh.” Dean winced. “She really hates me, doesn't she?”
This time, Dean was almost sure that Cas was just teasing him, because when he sputtered something about his back, and claimed that he couldn't sleep in the car, the corners of Cas' mouth curled up into what looked suspiciously like a grin before he said: “I understand. Those are of course grievous concerns and I apologize for ever doubting your reasoning.”
“The High- holy sh- I mean, yeah. Of course.” Dean nodded, looking dazed. “Uh, where do they reside? Just to know what place to avoid.” His smile was a little crooked.
“If anyone should be paying alimony, it's me. Considering you're housing and feeding Jack.”
“Did you?” Cas took one of his hands, brought it to his lips. “Do you want me to help you with that?”
“Well, someone has to do it.”
“Technically.”
The grumpy guys from before were still brooding in a corner, though, and now they were glaring at Cas. “What's their problem?” Dean muttered.
“Yeah, I ate a couple more after you went back to work.” Dean ducked his head, looking at him through his eyelashes and looking utterly adorable.
Cas' hand settled between Dean's shoulder blades, and he immediately felt better. Whether Cas had used his grace, or if it was just the comfort of the touch, Dean didn't actually care.
“You're a commoner.” It wasn't a question. She glared at him.
“My gorgeous righteous man,” Cas murmured as he kissed Dean's shoulder, right where the hand print used to be, and Dean wanted to cry, wanted to fuck himself on Cas' fingers harder, let go and just come unravelled, screw everyone else in the bunker.
He was exhausted. The festival was always difficult to plan, but this year the bakery they bought from when the kitchens couldn't handle all that they needed had changed their menu, taking a couple of things off of it that were absolutely crucial to the festival, being the favourite foods of some of the guests.
“Yes?” The butler raised an eyebrow. “Your highness called, didn't you?”
“You're gonna cite your sources?”
Cas leaned up to kiss him then, taking his hand away to press it into the mattress. There was a brief moment of panic in Dean's chest, but when Cas' lips met his, it melted, turned into something different, something hot and heady, going straight to his dick.
“Well, we could spend the night thinking things through.”
In the meantime, though, it was once again time to bullshit his way through life. Dean Winchester's special talent. “Yeah, uh, I was trying to decide how much to put on, you know.” He put away his dirty clothes, bending down beside the bed, hoping – praying, maybe – that Cas would be checking him out. When he got back up, Cas was looking at him with a mixture of surprise and amusement.
Cas had shown him around just the evening before, but Dean chose that morning to retrace their steps. It was easy enough for him to remember the way with a conscious effort, but he wanted it to be even easier, become muscle memory. Maybe he was being paranoid, but he liked knowing where all the exits were.
“No, haven't seen him since Dean woke up,” Mary said, then looked over at Bobby.
“Come in!” Dean heard himself say, as if he owned the place. Well, he supposed he kind of did.
Dean wasn't so sure about that. In fact, he believed he hardly deserved Cas at all, let alone to be treated kindly by his family. But Cas looked at him like he had hung the moon and the stars, and Dean decided to indulge himself, just for once, in the feeling of being wanted for more than his body.
Sara still smiled at him, looking a little smug. “Alone.”
“And you've been watching over me the whole time?” A few years ago, the same words might have carried anger or reproachfulness. But now, Dean could only feel a flutter in his stomach, and a slight blush on his face at the thought.
“What? You will go back to going up the wall? What's next, tearing the wallpaper to shreds with your fingernails?” Prince Gabriel poked their face. They must have been really close, Dean thought, surprised. Could this be one of his siblings? Dean knew that he had several brothers and at least one sister, and he had seen one or two so far, but not this one.
“You met them all. In fact, you led them into this world, remember?” Mary asked, looking amused.
Prince Gabriel pouted. “I'm always serious, Cassie. Dean, tell him this is my serious face.”
Castiel thought about lying, but couldn't bring himself to do it. “I'm not attracted to women.”
“You're not a thing, Dean. But yes, you are extremely pretty and I like looking at you very much.” Cas hummed. “I like you very much.”
to come out, fuck, I've been thinking about this for like twenty years, but I just never knew how and- and it didn't seem to matter when I never had a stable relationship anyway and what did it matter if I fucked a guy now and then, it wasn't like Sam
“Yes,” Cas said, gripping him by both shoulders now. “We're not sure what exactly he did to them, but-”
“Seriously?”
“I suspected you might need more than 'your four hours' every now and then,” Cas said, making air quotes.
Dean looked duped. “You don't have to... I'm supposed to pay for it!”
“Uh, no. That's okay. I can do it. Do you need the cart back right away?” Dean was already pulling lids off plates, trying not to salivate the sight of freshly cooked meat and all manner of side dishes. Then he found a slice of pie.
Jack went last. He seemed shy, not that Dean could blame him. They had started to get along a lot better before his possession, but they were still nowhere near as close as him and Sam, for example. And then there was the little matter of Jack stabbing him. Well, Michael. But also, by extension, him.
“Mom died in the fire. When... It's why we moved.” Dean gulped around the lump in his throat. Thinking about his mother always made his eyes sting.
“I know. We can be dirty together.” Cas sounded satisfied, even though Dean could feel his erection against his hip.
“Did us dressing up as cowboys not count as a date?” Cas asked, looking unimpressed. “I certainly wouldn't have agreed to it if you hadn't kissed me.”
Despite how careful Castiel was, Dean woke when he got up from the bed.
His mom and Bobby – the other Bobby, as Sam had to remind himself – were sitting at the table, eating breakfast, while Maggie was busy doing the dishes.
“Honestly, I believe that it might please the common folk to know that one of them is among the Royal Family members.”
Then he circled the room again, not sure what to do, when his stomach growled.
“That's the spirit!” Gabriel said jovially, already refilling his own glass. The bottle ended up empty, and Sara got up to fetch a new one. Or rather, a couple, because they all knew Gabriel's drinking habits.
“Uncle,” Cas' voice suddenly cut in, “what in all the nine hells are you doing?”
Dean almost laughed. “You don't know much about your brother in that respect, huh?”
“Are you here for another massage?” Dean sat down on his bed, hoping that Castiel would join him. He wasn't disappointed, though the prince left a bit of distance between them.
“Yes, of course, my k- I mean, crown prince.” Castiel bowed.
But now Dean was back, and they were as safe as they hadn't been in a long time, no overwhelmingly powerful enemy rearing its head. Castiel could only hope that it would stay that way.
The grace leaving his vessel – his body – was like a floodgate being opened, but instead of a liquid, he was losing connection to the world around him. The voices of the other angels, the low, warm hum of Heaven, the essence of the universe, a mixture of the sharp cold stillness of space and the movement of suns, planets and living beings alike, their warmth gentle and buzzing. All of this was fading, slipping through his proverbial fingers. But he also gained a connection, to himself, his vessel – his body, and yes, also the world, though only in extension. Suddenly, the cool air was more than an afterthought, more than a compartmentalized but ultimately meaningless observation. It was a
When Gabriel stepped out of the doorway, Castiel raised his eyebrows.
Cas gave him a big smile that made his heart grow about three sizes.
“But he's not-” Dean started to protest, but Cas held up a hand.
Dean blinked at the person standing in front of him, hand on their hip. They had a child in their arms, which wasn't even looking at Dean, too distracted by the leaves on a tree rustling in a fresh breeze.
Dean laughed. “Yeah. Yeah, it did. But... you said you were tired of trying to fix Heaven, Cas. Well, I'm tired of trying to fix Earth. I'm thirty-nine, Cas, almost forty, for crying out loud, and... and my back hurts worse every time we have to dig up a grave, and my legs hurt from running and...” He sighed. “It's just... we've done enough, right? We've saved enough people, and there are other hunters out there, younger hunters who don't feel like death after each hunt.” Since Cas stayed silent, he felt the need to continue: “And it's not like we'd be turning our backs on the others completely, you know? Someone needs our help? Cool, we'll help. Someone needs some info, some lore? Sure, we've seen a lot of things, maybe we can give 'em some insight. Anyone need a place to hang for a while, to recover? Sure, come in, or sit down on the deck in one of the lounge chairs, you want a cocktail or a beer?”
So he worked harder, made his thrusts more powerful, his angle better, until he could feel himself getting closer and closer.
Dean blushed. He had done a lot of that lately, a part of him realized, while the rest of him was internally screaming and trying to come up with a reply. “Uh,” he made, “you, uh, heard that.”
Sam nodded, pursed his lips. “Yeah, I guess.”
When Dean cried out “My Prince” with a hard cock buried deep inside him, Castiel corrected him.
“What is it, Dean?”
They straightened, taking a step back, eyes wide.
Castiel froze, almost tearing the papers. He took a deep breath. “I suppose everyone has heard of it by now.” He wondered if Zachariah had told on him, and what exactly it was he had said to Michael.
“Fuck, no. How'd that even get through to- fuck, can the other angels hear that shit?”
“Yeah, for his job, or... or for the kick of it. But he treats everyone like shit. That's not...” Dean huffed and rubbed at his eyes. For some reason, getting comfortable like this had made him sleepy. Or maybe almost being killed by werewolves and finding out the last evil overlord they had done away with had left behind some presents was getting to him.
“Here.” Dean shoved a water bottle at him that he'd taken from under a seat and Castiel drank greedily, like he had that first time after becoming human.
“I suppose it started similar to your story. Not with the districts, of course. But I never met my mother, at least not that I remember. I was very young when she died.”
numbers are still small, and if anything happens again... Well. Maybe this can help. Though I'm not actually doing this for Heaven. I'm doing it for me, and am just leaving the grace to you instead of entrusting it to Dean out of the goodness of my heart.” He knew his face was expressionless as he said it, and as intended, both Gabriel rolled his eyes (not all of them this time, but several) and Dean smiled.
“I couldn't possibly,” Prince Castiel started, but didn't seem to know how to finish the sentence.
It took some time to take off all of Cas' clothes, because he was still wearing everything, including his trench coat and his shoes, but eventually, it all landed in a messy pile next to the bed, with Dean's jeans following suit not long after. By then, they were both half hard from touching and rutting against each other, and when both their cocks were finally free and sliding together, Dean let himself moan loudly, without restraint.
Dean grinned. “The bedroom will be enough, hon.”
“Jack said he would put out a plate of cookies and a glass of eggnog. For the being called Claus,” Cas finally said.
Dean had had nightmares before. Since Michael, he had them almost every night, a mixture of memories and his gruesome imagination that provided more blood, more fire, more pain. The two nights before they had left for the shopping, they had been particularly bad, probably because Cas hadn't been there to wake him, to whisper assurances in his ear, to hold him. Not that he would tell him that. In those nights, Cas hadn't been able to get away from Jack, who often stayed up late because he didn't need much sleep, or from whoever else who had hogged his attention. Dean had eventually retired to his room, had waited for a bit, then had locked the door. It would have been too suspicious if he only locked it whenever Cas was there, so he locked it every night, and it was honestly a relief to know that none of the strangers roaming the bunker could come in at any time. But it also meant that Cas couldn't come in.
When Cas' cock pushed into him, Dean reached out, grabbing his arm, his shoulder, whatever he could reach. He needed Cas closer, as if that was even possible with them joined like this, but Cas didn't protest, just let himself be reeled in as he slowly sank into him, careful, tender,
“You seemed... distraught, earlier. After I told you about that other version of me.”
It must be the kitchens, Dean thought, and remembering the amazing dishes he had been served so far plus the smell of the pies still filling his nose, he could barely keep from drooling. The person with the pies came out, put down more pies, went back in, and Dean made a decision. It was the hardest thing to simply walk by the pies without tasting them, but he wasn't a thief, so as much as it pained him, he was determined to ask permission first. Stepping through the doors, Dean was hit with hot, humid air, smelling of a variety of foods, though the pies' scent was currently the strongest. This was such a crass difference to the cool spring air outside that Dean felt like he had walked into a brick wall, and he could feel himself starting to sweat. Then the person with the pies came back for the doors, almost walking into him, blinking at him in surprise, then annoyance. They paled, though, when their eyes fell onto his wrist.
Cas laughed, loudly, and it eased almost all of Dean's nerves, drawing a real smile from him.
For a moment, Castiel just stood there, watching Jack and wondering if he should pocket the cookies and leave. That would have been the most prudent choice, allowing for less chances of Jack waking up and discovering him. But Jack was only wearing a t-shirt and the bunker was always a little on the cool side, so Castiel eventually slipped out of his trench coat and carefully placed it over Jack's shoulders. That would reveal that Castiel had been there, but he could always argue that the milk and cookies had still been there when he had stepped into the room. That wasn't even a lie, and even if it was an omission, Castiel considered it a white lie, one of those harmless not-quite-truths that humans told to spare each others' feelings.
Castiel stared at him, clearly caught off guard. “What?”
“No need to bring Our Father into this, Dean. Though I do understand the urge to blaspheme in his name, after everything that's happened.”
Eventually, Castiel stepped closer to their table, barely glancing at the others before he addressed Dean. “I would like to...” He seemed to grasp for the right words. “Request your services again.”
“Yeah, kinda like that.” Dean smiled. “I mean, Sam's already training these apocalypse world guys for the job, so once they've learned from him, what do they need us for, except some angel or demon or djinn trivia now and then.”
Dean stared at the door for a couple seconds after it fell closed. Apparently he was a 'your highness' now. Cas had forgotten to mention that little detail.
“Oh? My mistake.” There was a trace of laughter in Cas' voice as he carded a hand through Dean's hair. Shit, that felt nice. “I suppose then I must get up alone to celebrate Christmas with everyone else.”
“Yeah, but you're, like, different.” Dean gestured to him as a whole.
He was almost sure – almost – that he was of the Royal Family, what with the crest on the pin on his chest. Cas had once explained to him that all the princes and princesses wore it, but this guy seemed a bit too old to be the king's child. He looked more like a bureaucrat, though with the temper of a drunken sailor.
Dean almost put the lubed up hand over his face, but stopped himself just in time. “Seriously?” he asked, trying to sound angry, but a laugh bubbled up in him instead. “You're an ass.”
God, Dean loved him.
Dean raised an eyebrow and Castiel shook his head.
“Oh, right. Dark Kaia... Apparently, she comes from that monster world you and Sam went to a while back. She is that world's equivalent of our Kaia Nieves. Claire is the one who started calling her Dark Kaia, since... Well, she seems to like dark robes.”
But there he was. He plastered a smile on his face as he left the bathroom. “Hey. Sorry it took so long.”
Dean was quiet for a moment. “Why would she even- I mean, shit, I hope she hasn't
“It's okay,” Cas told him, “their bites have no effect on angels.” For about two seconds, his eyes glowed blue, and then the bleeding had stopped, the wounds closed. Cas smiled at him wearily.
In turn, Castiel told him more about his childhood, about his favourite places to hide, which seemed to be mainly libraries, though he also mentioned a few other spots. About the way the front yard and the gardens had changed over the years, sometimes because of a new head gardener, sometimes because of the 'fickleness of humans' as he called it. He seemed to mean that his siblings sometimes changed their tastes.
“Then I'm sure he'd be embarrassed, and he'd tell you how to avoid that the next time around.” Gabriel said it like it was the most boring question in the world.
“Seriously? You think I don't know what's under the mat in your trunk?” Dean raised an eyebrow, growing more and more annoyed at Cas' reluctance to take down the wolf. “It's just a werewolf, Cas, it's basically a trip to the park.”
Dean didn't think Castiel was like that. It had taken him long enough to fuck Dean, and he didn't seem to care much about sex. But perhaps he had found someone else to talk to, someone more fitting than a sex worker. Someone nicer. Someone suitable for a prince...
“What do you mean?” He liked Dean. He was honest and his whole face lit up sometimes when he laughed. He was also very pretty.
“Yeah, yeah.” Dean was still smiling, and tried to hide it by kissing Cas' face, working his way down to his throat. “If I'm so worthy, then can I have my reward now?”
After a moment, Dean said tentatively: “You're not that bad.”
When he stepped closer, Dean noticed a little stream, apparently originating in the middle of the arrangement. Following it to its source, Dean soon realized that it wasn't just one stream, but half a dozen, all flowing out towards the trees.
“But it's a Christian holiday,” Dean argued, leaning back on his hands. Jack was listening to them intently.
“You're gonna have to take those issues up with the Chief.” Dean leaned down to kiss him, softly this time. “Man, I can't believe all I'll ever be to those guys is the Chief's brother. Well, and, uh, Michael's vessel, I guess.” Great. He had made himself feel crappy all over again.
Benny seemed amused, but didn't comment on it. Instead, he glanced back at the dough behind him. “I'm afraid I will have to get back to baking, or some of the Royal Family really won't be having any pie today.”
“Uh, I... This is gonna be embarrassing and you're probably gonna laugh at me...”
“I would have come sooner, but...” Cas grimaced. As he stepped closer, Dean saw the bags under his eyes for the first time. “There was simply too much to do.”
He expected a rebuttal again, but Prince Castiel actually nodded. “Thank you,” he said when Dean handed him on of the crystal glasses he kept for high-born company.
“So I can just take whatever I want from out front?” Dean checked.
“Booooring.” Prince Gabriel pouted. “I'd say you only know about it from all the books you read, but I doubt there's a book like that in our libraries. If there is, I certainly haven't found it yet.”
“Uh, yeah. At least that's the one I know. Not being attracted to anyone sexually usually means you're asexual. But don't ask me for the details, 'cause I don't have them. Maybe, uh, ask someone who knows about this stuff? I don't know how old or recent the word is, so the library might not help you.”
“I fear if I don't leave now, I never will.”
Dean groaned.
“Those are not my titles, Gabriel.” Prince Castiel frowned at his brother again.
A smile tugged on Cas' lips and he ducked his head, looking like a shy school boy. Gods, Dean wanted to kiss him.
“Cas.”
“It's called vegetables, Dean, and it's part of a healthy-”
Annoyed. Great. Yeah, this would definitely be annoying to him, wouldn't it?
Cas seemed to think about it. “I suppose so.”
Prince Castiel smiled weakly. “It is.”
This time, Cas was there again, holding him tightly as Dean snapped awake from his latest nightmare, shaking. He clung to Cas, buried his face in his neck, let him rub his back.
Castiel smiled, glancing at the shelf next to the reading desk. “The one I placed here for you?”
“Cool.”
“No, of course not.” Dean fed some more wood into the fire.
Dean's heart had been beating fast ever since he had brought up the topic, but oddly enough, it took this moment to calm down. This was known territory for him. Sex. Cas. Sex with Cas – okay, maybe that was still kind of novel, considering.
Cas made a defiant face. “Well, it's mine. You can't have it.”
This chapter includes a (kind of) coming-out and reactions to that, both from other people and the one coming out. I drew from my own experiences with coming out for that and while one may argue that Dean's reaction would be completely different from mine, I project too much onto him to change this lmao.
Cas raised an eyebrow. “No, Dean, the king was not travelling for the last ten years. Well, I suppose we didn't spin that story at first. We managed to conceal that he was missing for quite some time. But eventually...” Cas moved his head to the side, his spine cracking. “We tried finding him for several years. It wasn't too long ago that I went on the last excursion to search for him. Of course officially, we were making our rounds through the kingdom to ensure the well-being of our people. Which really wasn't such a bad thing to do. We encountered quite a few troubled villages and were able to alleviate most of their concerns. But we never found the king.” He smiled sadly. “And now we have decided to move forward, hence the coronation.”
Castiel thought about it. “Well, at least you didn't eat all of it.”
“Can I ask why you're doing this with me?” Dean asked, mere inches from Castiel's heart.
“This is all just here to impress people, isn't it?”
Castiel's frown deepened. “Do your clients make you sleep in worse places?”
“And the king is also... distant?” Dean asked cautiously.
“Shutting up and telling you something are mutually exclusive.”
“Some clients prefer it when I don't smell and taste like wine.” Dean blushed, realising he had hinted at them having sex.
“What did you do before?”
“I've been wondering... can I visit the Harem?” When Dean saw Castiel's surprised face, he quickly added: “Not to like, use their services or anything. But I kinda... they're my friends, you know. At least some of them.”
“Let's stay another night,” Cas said after they had sat like that for a while. If Cas had been human, his knees probably would have protested by now.
“No promises.” Castiel was smiling when he walked out the door.
“Yeah,” he eventually breathed out, wincing at how rough his voice sounded. “Gimme a minute.”
For a while, he roamed the hallways aimlessly, stopping every now and then to throw a look at the floor plan Cas had given him. They had studied it together for a while, Cas pointing out certain rooms which were of particular significance – people's personal rooms, the High Enchantress' study, the libraries – and Dean had, with Cas' permission, made notes on the scrolls. Apparently, this copy of the plans had been made specifically for Dean, so he was free to do with it as he pleased.
They sat leaning against each other, Cas' hand finding his as they watched more firework going up. After a while, Cas said: “I know I just talked about free will and all that, so it's of course entirely your own decision, but I'd really love it if you made your lasagne again tomorrow.”
“Dean.” Castiel closed the door behind him and quickly made his way to the bed, wrapped Dean in his arms as the first tears started to fall. “Shh, it's okay.” That was a weak thing to say when he couldn't be sure, when he barely even knew what was going on, but he felt like he needed to say something, anything.
If Hester was surprised, she didn't show it. They all knew what the High Enchantress was like, but sometimes it still unnerved Castiel.
He shouldn't have used Dean's bed to begin with, though. He was probably going to wake up stiff and annoyed at the arrogant Prince who had taken his bed. He was also, Castiel realized, going to hate it if Castiel actually stayed. Not that he had the intention to. Quickly, Castiel got up, arranging his robe into something that resembled decency, and hastened out of the room.
the assurance policy.
They didn't talk about it. It wasn't that Sam didn't talk to him at all, but he was a little awkward around Dean for the rest of the day. Dean hoped that Sam would just need some time to get used to it, and Cas kept squeezing his hand in reassurance, distracting him from the uncertainty.
Some of the employees giggled, but Gabriel just grinned. “Sure. Since you asked so nicely.”
Jack frowned again. “Does that mean you were together before today? I was so sure, but the others said such contradictory things, including Sam...”
“It does make sense,” Dean whispered back, seeing Gabriel roll his eyes.
“Of course I'm thinking werewolf. I mean, what kinda animal gets into a family home, kills everyone, then rips the same organ out of all four of its victims?” Dean put down his phone.
“I know that's not what you want.” Cas sounded so sad it broke Dean's heart, and his words confused him to no end. “If I thought you'd say yes, I'd ask you to be mine right now.”
“Gonna see Jack?” Dean shuffled on the bed, sheets rustling. “Comin' with you.”
He got about halfway with pulling the bottle out of the bag before Dean frantically pushed it back in, his face burning. “Don't take that out here,” he hissed, glancing around to check if anyone had seen. But no one paid any attention to them.
“But I- and he- what does he even see in me?” Dean blushed again, and had to look away.
This made Dean uncomfortable. “It's not for myself.”
“You need to rid him of the terrible influences he's fallen under.”
“Right. So, uh.” Jody threw another glance at Cas, then got up from where she had been sitting on the bed. “I'm gonna go tell the others that you're awake. Don't move.”
Dean smiled as the kid babbled about Santa, said good morning to the others, took the teasing from Sam about getting up late. Fortunately, he wasn't the last one, and even more fortunately, Jack had apparently worked with Maggie to make breakfast for everyone, so while they waited, Dean wolfed down a PB&J. Cas rolled his eyes and told him to eat slower so he wouldn't die on them on Christmas morning from choking on a sandwich, but he was smiling and Dean couldn't help but smile back, hiding it by taking an even larger bite.
Sam sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. Dean knew that he was already working himself ragged, was already getting too little sleep, and the last thing he needed was his brother pushing for answers they didn't have, but Dean needed something. Anything.
When Castiel awoke the next morning to the blaring sound of his time piece, it took him a moment to realize that he was not in his own room, and that the warmth on his back was Dean. He reached for the time piece and turned it off, but jostled Dean in the process, who just grunted and grabbed him tighter.
“Yeah, but since when do I listen to anybody?” Dean flashed him a smile. “Where are we- oh.”
“It would stir up quite a bit of gossip, I'm afraid,” Castiel said, seeing Dean's expression fall. He reached for his hand. “But that's fine. If my family can ignore Gabriel's indulgences, I'd say they can handle you meeting some friends every now and then.”
“At least with... this.” Prince Castiel gestured to the room once more.
“Irresponsible sounds quite right.” Cas sighed again, and shifted, pressing his shoulders back. “Perhaps I shouldn't have told you, but I think you would have found out anyway, living in the palace.”
“Oh?” Gabriel regarded him with a neutral expression. “Pray tell. With whom?”
“Meg,” he warned her.
“Sure. You'll see that with a little lubrication, everything will go just a little easier.” He said it to his brother, but he winked at Dean.
“So... In the middle of the day, on the kitchen table?” Dean checked, only to hear Cas laugh again.
“Uh, yeah.” Seeing Cas again came unexpected, to say the least. He wasn't sure how to act for a moment, then remembered that he was still a Harem employee, and put on his best honey voice. “Of course. Forgive me, I had a light headache and so the others saw fit to send me to my room.” Actually, he had been in a terribly bad mood, and the others had basically dragged him to his room to make sure he didn't piss of any of the visitors.
“I didn't- is the king dead?”
“Of course not.” Cas looked taken aback. “You weren't there to teach me.”
Dean stared at him for a moment. “It pays rather well.”
“I've had worse.”
“Alright, alright. Heavens, you're going to give yourself an aneurysm.” He looked around, then whispered something to the employee next to him, who got up and walked away. “Lucky for you, I am a benevolent prince. Stay here though, I don't want you to ruin everything by glowering in the background.”
That seemed to calm Sam a bit, though he still looked doubtful about Dean's intentions. If he was honest, Dean wasn't entirely sure about his own intentions, either, at least not until he heard himself say: “It's gonna be a long trip and we're gonna have to get a lot of stuff, so we're probably gonna stay in a motel over night.”
He didn't need to say anything more, which was just as well, because there was a sudden lump in his throat.
“Hey, if you're done apologizing, these pies won't bring themselves out, so...” They motioned to a couple of plates on a table.
Dean just bowed as much as the table before him allowed.
Cas blinked at him. “It's decoration.”
After one and a half weeks, though, the others had mostly grown tired of bugging him and had turned to other, even juicier gossip. Dean encouraged it, not really caring about any scandals, but glad that he wasn't the centre of attention anymore.
Dean suddenly seemed nervous, fiddling with his bracelet. “So, there's something I've been meaning to ask you.”
“I can teach you,” Cas said, probably able to follow their words perfectly, the bastard.
“A better place,” Prince Castiel grumbled, shaking his head. “You know I hate that nickname and you use it purely to taunt me.”
Castiel looked away. “It's not that,” he said quietly.
“You... you want to die?” Dean could feel tears rising up in his eyes.
Castiel's eyes quickly swept upwards. He knew the expression, but he still couldn't help himself. “That's a high roof, though.”
Back in their room, Dean used his phone to look up details on the case – yeah, he was already thinking of it as a case. “Police reported claw marks on the vics, and that they were all missing the same organ, but it still doesn't say which one,” he told Cas, who had sat down on the edge of their bed. “It's right around the corner, in a suburb a little to the north.”
“It's not your fault,” Cas repeated.
And then Castiel stopped coming. After a week, Dean was starting to get worried, wondering if something had happened. The others kept telling him that nobles were capricious, changing their opinions and their preferences every five minutes. After two weeks, on the night of the spring festival, they had managed to convince Dean that Castiel wasn't coming back. That he had gotten what he wanted and had now moved on to greener pastures. Maybe he had married a nice noble, or was busy fucking a kitchen employee.
“You're smart and resourceful. Heaven could do worse.”
Blinking against the sudden brightness, he saw Cas squinting up at him, apparently not bothered by the change in lighting.
“Hey, has anyone seen Cas?” Sam asked as he walked into the kitchen.
“Cas?”
“You're not?” Castiel wondered why he would ask something like that then.
By the time they arrived at the rooms, Castiel was getting a little nervous. Would Dean like them? Would he find them too plain, or, possibly worse, too fancy? Would he be able to live there comfortably, make them his new home?
“What is it?” Beneath his usual rough demeanour, Castiel detected a hint of curiosity. Castiel rarely ever asked for anything.
“Because I like how honest you are. Please don't call me smoking hot in front of other people, but in private...” Castiel laughed again.
“Wait. Claire wrote a story about us?”
“I make a mean caipirinha, too.”
So after Dean tried to be snarly about it not being worth the cost if he had just one mixtape, he agreed that they may as well listen to it, so soon
Cas was smiling again, a clear sign that despite how serious his words had sounded, they had been meant as a joke. Sometimes, it was difficult to decipher if Cas genuinely didn't understand a term or reference, or if he was being sarcastic.
Thirty-five. Jesus. Sometimes it was hard to believe how long they'd been doing this, especially considering they were still alive. Then again, they had died before, it just hadn't really stuck.
“I've no doubt.” Castiel's eyes roamed his body for a moment before he turned away, seeming embarrassed.
“So the crown prince...”
“Wow, I can't believe you fell asleep before midnight.” Sam was standing behind the couch, leaning on it with his arms. “You're getting old.”
Eventually, the last stragglers made it, and it was time to open Christmas presents. Everything was already under the tree, all the presents marked with big name tags so there wouldn't be any confusion with this many people, and grouped so everyone would find theirs quickly. Dean was almost sure the last bit was Sam's work, though maybe people had just naturally put down their presents next to ones with the same name on it.
There was some murmuring in the room, some of the Harem employees whispering to each other, probably concerning that person. Dean had never seen them before, but then again he only knew whoever visited the Harem.
“I'm not saying he's a baby, but he'll always be my baby brother. I'm twenty-four.”
“Dean, you... how are you feeling?”
“Come in.” He got up from his chair, stretching his back a little. When he looked to the door, though, it was Hester, wearing her violet dress, the one so tight around her waist it seemed as if she wanted to rub it under everyone's nose how fast she had lost her pregnancy weight again. “Hester, what a... surprise. What can I do for you?”
“So. Dean-o. You're uncharacteristically quiet today.” Even though they hadn't slept with each other, that didn't mean they hadn't interacted. Usually in the form of Gabriel annoying Dean until he broke the polite facade he so carefully put up in front of his employers and their guests.
“Cas says you've been teaching these guys from apocalypse world how to hunt,” Dean explained as he continued to rummage in the fridge, eventually pulling out some eggs, butter, toast and jelly. “Guess I should've figured you wouldn't teach them how to stay properly fed. What is all this stuff, anyway?” He gestured inside the fridge before closing its door with his foot.
Dean thought about that for a moment. “You're gonna try and fix it, aren't you?”
“Are you hungry, too? It's probably been just as long since you've had any food,” Dean said, weighing his keys in his hands.
“Don't call me that,” Sam grumbled, and Dean saw some guys behind him grin. That must have been the first time they had heard their Chief called that.
When Castiel arrived at the Harem the next evening, the front room was once again mostly empty. As at the spring festival, most employees had set up in the yard, except this time without much need for fires. A few were lit, as the nights could still get cool, though this evening they seemed to be used mostly for lighting purposes.
As soon as they entered his room, Dean stoked the fire, entirely too aware of how exposed he was, crouching with his ass up in the air. It wasn't that he was scared of the Prince, exactly. He even found him kind of attractive, so this might not be the worst night in this place. But he was a Prince and Dean was afraid that he would slip up again, would make a glib comment and be punished for it.
