Despite knowing he shouldn’t, John paused, closing his eyes as he drew in a deep breath. After a slow count to five, John turned around. Jim was standing off to the side, clearly nervous, hands twisting in front of him. He glanced around him as though afraid his assailant would pop out from behind every shadow, or perhaps looking for witnesses against further assault. John huffed at that last bit.
Pressed up against John, snug in his arms, senses overwhelmed, Sherlock had never been happier. Despite his parents’ affection, they had never been much of ‘cuddlers’ with their children, though perhaps that was due to their children not being much of cuddlers themselves. Or so Sherlock thought he hadn’t been. Now, John’s arms around him as he curled into the shorter man’s side, he was second guessing that belief.
Sherlock’s eyes closed of their own accord, and he leaned into John’s touch, letting out a shuddering breath as John softly smiled and pressed a kiss to his brow. Hesitantly, Sherlock’s arms opened to wrap around John’s middle. “You could leave me and I’d be here with cases for you whenever you showed up,” Sherlock mumbled. “You’d still get what you needed.”
“I want you,” Jim breathed, wet and hot, against John’s ear. He pulled back slightly, staring down into John’s flushed face, and for the briefest of seconds John felt like he was staring into the very eye of the devil. All such thoughts fled and were forgotten, however, as Jim pulled his hands free of John’s chest, curling one arm around John’s shoulders as the other reached for the sofa beside them, using both them and his hips to pull John with him as he twisted to the side, laying back against the sofa cushions as he led John on top of him. He pushed the blankets and pillow aside for more space, drawing John into another kiss.
“Maybe I should,” Sherlock smirked. Judging by John’s grunt, he seemed to agree. Sherlock let his hands continue sliding over John, kissing the man deeply, letting himself grow comfortable before trying anything else. He really didn’t mind this part. In fact, he could go on kissing John like this for a while. So he did.
“Oh,” Sherlock said, blinking in surprise before reaching out to take the warm mug, suppressing a shiver when his and John’s fingers touched just a little too lingeringly. “Thank you.” The words were awkward and foreign on his lips, unused to speaking them genuinely, but John smiled all the same. He had a truly beautiful smile.
He went to the stable and, seeing Philip tied there, he mounted the steed and ran down the stone pathway, through the iron gate and into the night.
Sherlock drew her hands up to steeple her hands below her chin, tuning out Molly as she babbled on about something or other. Sherlock was distracted, her ire growing with each passing moment as she was dressed and primped like a- well, a princess.
Lying down, John pulled the thoughtful Sherlock to him and cuddled in, kissing the top of Sherlock’s head and laughing when he felt flecks of glitter settling on his lips.
“Step into the light,” Sherlock said quietly, watching as the creature pondered the demand before inching closer, the light beginning to draw over hideous features of not a man, but a beast. With fur, fangs, claws, and a body standing a head above Sherlock’s own. The creature's body was broad as an ox, with his head a mixture of a lion and a bear, with curling horns upon his head. When put together, he was a looming and terrifying nightmare.
They kissed for a few moments, trading sweet pecks back and forth, until Sherlock leaned forward and whispered, “I’m ready.”
He dipped his fingers inside, just a bit, since he was without lube, and Sherlock thrust once more and came with a cry, coating John’s pant leg with his release.
John began to slowly pull the cloth out, and then push it back in, listening to Sherlock's aroused grumblings and pushing the detective's hands away when he attempted to pull the cloth out himself.
In the moment of confusion, the good doctor felt a hand grasping his own, and looking over, he saw understanding and happiness shining in Sherlock’s pale, every changing eyes.
“Oh, I just knew Sherlock would be good for you. He is too sweet and kind to not have that affect on people, and look at how beautiful he is,” Mrs. Hudson cooed and Sherlock, who as per usual, blushed at attention being drawn to his qualities, preferring only his intellectual abilities to be praised.
Siger smiled at the thought of the joy on Sherlock’s face when he brought him the beautiful specimen, and drew a small knife from his boot to cut the stem from the rose bush. As he approached, he felt a shiver run up his spine and he looked up to view his surroundings once more. At seeing no one once again, Siger turned his attention back to the rose and with a swift cut, he held the newly cut rose in his hand.
Sherlock took a deep breathe, his catlike eyes gleaming as he began to explain: “The rose you’re after is worth nearly 2 million pounds, so the person who stole the rose is obviously interested in it for monetary value, but also for the rarity it possesses, and the fact that it is important enough to warrant Scotland Yard’s somewhat lax attention” Sherlock paused, childlike excitement in his voice as he looked for comprehension on the face of Lestrade.
Sherlock gazed into his blue eyes, eyes shining ‘trust me’ in their depths, and Sherlock nodded his consent.
They stayed that way for a handful of uncountable moments, in the silence of their bed where they had made love only hours before, and held one another. And if there was a wetness that gathered on John’s chest, or in Sherlock’s curls, neither man mentioned it.
He met Sherlock’s nervous eyes and, with a wink, pressed a wet kiss right on Sherlock’s awaiting hole.
Sherlock was young, sometimes John forgot what it was like to be in his twenties, untried and completely unknowing of certain intimacies. Perhaps, Sherlock was jealous? He had certainly acted jealous of the women John had dated in the past, but this, this reaction was new. Sherlock seemed devastated, crushed.
John allowed her to grasp her left breast gently, moaning as Sherlock lightly twisted the nipple and hardened it further, causing goose bumps to travel along her breasts. Sherlock gave a smug smile at John's moan, and continued to fondle and caress the sensitive nipples and heavy breasts until John, achingly turned on, moved Sherlock's hands away.
With that, John’s right hand reached down and began tickling up and down Sherlock’s crevice; the sensitive skin there causing Sherlock to giggle.
Sherlock lit the fire and the two men laid out the food on the coffee table, eating on the couch and sharing stories from their day. Sherlock was telling John a story from a case he had conducted as a primary school student to solve who was stealing the food from the cafeteria.
He was a prisoner, in a magic castle, with a teapot and a candelabra and a teacup and a beast. His deductions could not help him here. While we was accustom to observing human behavior, this was outside of his realm of expertise by a long shot.
John knelt down next to him, and gathered the despondent detective in his firm arms, holding him to his chest and breathing slowly, exaggeratedly, so Sherlock would match his breathing and calm down.
“That’s right, you had to have your naughty bottom spanked, and next time, I am going to put a cock ring on you and you’ll not come, but I will,” John leaned down to whisper in his ear, “I am going to fuck you with a cock ring on, so hard, and you’ll be moaning and writhing around on my prick, but I won’t let you escape it. Afterwards, you will feel my come leaking out of your pink, puffy rosebud for
them,” John murmured as he lavished kisses on Sherlock’s elegant neck, nipping at his clavicle lightly in a way he knew the detective adored, “I love them.”
“Oh, I met a man on my travels who was a zoologist, and I saw the book sitting on his shelf. We bargained for it, and I was able to finally get you a present you actually want,” Siger smiled at his son’s shocked reaction, reaching out to pet down his recalcitrant curls.
“Well, ah,” John rubbed the back of her neck, “I’m here for your welfare, to keep you out of trouble, and the make sure you’re safe at all times.”
“J-John, please let me come,” Sherlock panted while he shimmied on the deliciously tickling dildo stuffed in his arse, but John only smiled and shook his head.
We may not be so different after all, Sherlock pondered as he reached the castle gates, walking up to the large door and taking a deep breathe.
Sherlock didn’t respond, he merely closed his eyes and grasped John’s hand, holding it, and John, close to his body.
If Jim still wanted him, even after his freak-out, then John needed to deserve it. He needed to deserve Jim, and not hide behind fear of being found out to be queer or something. That term still made John squirm, made him feel like something dirty, but…if it meant he could be with Jim, then maybe a little dirt wasn’t such a bad thing. Maybe it was just what he needed.
“I accept you, Sherlock, all of you. And I love all you. And I will always love all of you. Even when we’re old and grey and we’ve never had sex once, I will love you. All right?”
“Hey,” John’s soft voice broke into his thoughts, and Sherlock startled at being caught unaware again, turning to face John who was lingering in the doorway. How long had Sherlock been lost in thought? “Christ, Sherlock, you’re tearing yourself apart. Stop it.”
Jim glanced up at him confused for a second before sharply exhaling and shaking his head. “NO,” he said firmly. “No. He didn’t…do that,” he added more quietly. “Just…what you see,” he sighed. “And called me a few choice names, but I’m used to that. I just…it’s embarrassing.”
“Of course I am, Sherlock. Where’s this coming from?” He turned around, now sitting between Sherlock’s legs. He lifted his hands up to the detective’s face and started gently stroking it. Sherlock leaned into the touch and closed his eyes.
Sherlock kissed the side of John’s head and then got up, making his way to the kitchen. “I’ll get you some ibuprofen and something to eat. What do you want?”
Sherlock brought his own arms around John and started stroking slowly up and down his back. “For what?” he asked.
Marriage did serve, however, as a reason to bring everyone together to celebrate them as a couple. Sherlock, of course, despised social gatherings of any kind, but John knew that deep down he was enjoying this. Their special day, where they had confessed their love for each other, exchanged vows, exchanged rings, had sealed their lives together again. Just like so many events before had; a bullet to the shoulder, walk through the park, a nice little flat. Then grimmer times had come; a bomb, a woman, a hound, a fall. And the return had brought them closer together than ever before. It only made sense that this latest act should come of their own free will with no threats or sacrifices necessary, just the two of them.
The sleeping detective mumbled incoherently and buried his head further down, thus leaving the back of his neck completely exposed, a fact which John quickly took advantage of. Leaning down towards the detective John let go of his shoulder and wrapped his arms around Sherlock's waist and left a trail of soft kisses across the man's neck. Sherlock moaned and shifted in his chair.
John's fingers travelled down between Sherlock's legs and he couldn't suppress a moan of pleasure when he finally entered the detective. His fingers were surrounded by warmth and heat and Sherlock. He looked at the detective, who had his eyes closed and was trying to control his breathing. "Are you okay?" John asked.
John spun Sherlock around so that they were facing each other. "What part of 'I'll be here if anything happens' did you not understand?"
John thought back to the last day he had spent with Sherlock. They'd been on the run, hiding from Lestrade and his team with Molly's help, though he was certain that if Lestrade had really wanted to find them he probably would have been able to. Sherlock had taken every chance to push John away, determined to work through the 'final problem' alone. John still didn't understand what had happened on that rooftop. Moriarty had killed himself so there should have been no reason for Sherlock to jump. With Moriarty gone they would've had the chance to clear Sherlock's name. He would have gotten his life back and everything would go back to normal- as normal as living with Sherlock Holmes could be. But Sherlock had jumped, spending his last breaths trying to convince John that he was a fake. Maybe he thought that if John believed him it would somehow make it easier to grieve, but he had been wrong. John had been angry at himself for not being able to help Sherlock, for not being able to talk him down. Sherlock was his best friend and he hadn't been able to pull him back from the edge. What kind of friend did that make him?
Sherlock pulled the dressing gown open to reveal the scar on his left side. For the first time John allowed himself to scrutinize it, free in the knowledge that Sherlock had no problem with him seeing it. He ran his hand over it gently, assessing the work that had been done to save Sherlock when John was unable to do so himself.
Sherlock collapsed back on the sofa, his head resting back at an uncomfortable looking angle. John carefully stood up, tucked Sherlock back in and wrapped the dressing gown firmly around him. Sherlock was still out to the world, eyes closed, lips parted, limbs spread over the sofa.
John heated up their meal and they ate it in the kitchen table which was, for once, devoid of experiments or science equipment, though John doubted it would last much longer. They spent some time watching telly afterwards, Sherlock tame and preoccupied with John enough to not complain about the programmes they were watching. While John watched the telly, Sherlock watched him.
John held off sleep just long enough to hear Sherlock’s reply, uttered in the quiet of the night, right next to his ear.
But no, Sherlock wouldn’t see his body as worthy next to a painting or a sculpture. But how does someone prove something to a genius?
“You’re an idiot,” Sherlock declared haughtily instead, his insult undermined by the way he was gently stroking John’s arm and chest, as if John was the most precious person in Sherlock’s world, which he was.
John undid Sherlock’s bindings and, with a sad sigh, pulled the soaked panties off of Sherlock’s body. He loved the thong, but he knew by experience how uncomfortable it would be to wake up with come soaked clothing clinging to you. He wiped them both off with a washcloth before settling into the sleep.
“You won’t flirt with anyone like that for a case again, will you, Sherlock? Because if you do, I will turn you over my knee and spank you right there. And they will see how much you secretly love it,” John declared calmly, softening his spanks to soft pats and watching the blush colored cheeks jiggle, and small plug just peaking out from between those two luscious mounds.
John turned around to look at his detective, who was sulking in his chair as John had stopped kissing him, and John’s heart swelled as he stared at the immature man-child in his living room.
Gently taking it off, Sherlock stared down at the next article of clothing, a blush rising unbidden to his face.
“Sherlock, love, come back to me,” John commanded, not harshly but with enough steel that Sherlock jumped to attention, standing rigid, waiting for John’s next order.
With a smile, John picked Sherlock's lazy body from the bath and laid him on the bathroom floor where he had laid out of a towel. Sherlock tensed for a moment from the cold, but relaxed once John began rubbing lotion over his skin, turning him over to coat his bruised, aching bum with the lotion that gave him relief from the aching.
Sherlock’s heart felt full enough to burst, and once he felt John breathing even out, he responded, “Sweet dreams, John.”
Sherlock cried, tears running down his flushed face as the overwhelming sensations battered into his body, his bottom practically aflame from John’s overwhelming attentions and military precision whilst delivering his punishment.
Lestrade huffed out a nervous-sounding laugh, “honestly, John, get your mind out of the sewer! He is our king, my direct superior; I am not attracted to him.”
mistake for being so selfless. Let him regret his choice. But John knew, in the deep recesses of his mind that had not been destroyed by alcohol, that Sherlock's sacrifice was a noble one.
The commander grunted in response, observing John’s elegant footwork and quick movements and she firmly moved her sword with the determination and skill of practiced swordsmen, plunging it once again into the bull’s-eye with accuracy. Begrudgingly, he nodded and agreed, “yes, fine, she would be an appropriate addition- with our numbers so depleted, we cannot be picky. Even if she
Tossing the phone on the nightstand, he continued to observe his young lover in his sleeping state, remembering fondly the night before; Sherlock writhing beneath him, sheathed on half of his prick as he cried from sentiment and the overwhelming sensations, John’s thrust’s sure and as deep as he was able to go.
Moriarty made a face at Sherlock's use of his formal title and scoffed, "Now, now Sherlock, we don't have any need to have formalities between us. After all, we are the two resident geniuses" he declared with a devious grin that didn't reach his cold eyes, "it's only natural that we get to know one another better."
“Oh,” Sherlock responded with a growing blush, looking at the little white panties with pink trim, and a small bow that would rest a few inches beneath his bellybutton.
Sherlock did not see his usual fluffy-jumper wearing John, no, this was Captain John H. Watson, M.D., of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers, commanding his unit and saving lives through his natural ability to lead despite his slighter height.
,” Sherlock moaned, tears falling from his eyes from the overstimulation, his body entirely exhausted and sexually spent. Sherlock’s overstimulated crying continued, his body lethargic, and John smiled and wiped the leaking tears away, kissing over his face gently in contradiction to the harsh lovemaking.
With a muffled gasp, Sherlock came once again, painting his stomach further with his essence, and his body shook from overstimulation already.
“Absolutely, it’ll be over before you know it. Hold still for me now,” John explained in a bored tone, but felt his heart clench when Sherlock began to tense further at John’s seeming disinterest in the proceedings.
John acquiesced with a smile, leaning down to lave over Sherlock’s right nipple tenderly before biting down just so.
Exiting the cab, John was slightly overwhelmed by the apparent size of the gala. It was being held at the London Museum of Art, and reporters were lining the curving stairs, cameras flickering constantly like strobe lights as finely dressed women and men, England’s elite, entered the fundraiser.
It was a dream. Obvious. Annoyingly unexceptional. And yet, anytime he was intimate with John, the sensations felt anything but ordinary.
” Sherlock gasped as John swallowed him whole, suckling around his cock and keeping it warm in his mouth, saliva pooling on his tongue as a ran it up and down Sherlock’s- now drenched- manhood. Sherlock gripped at the sheets, a whine building in his throat as John winked up at him with his lips wrapped around Sherlock's curving erection.
Sherlock thought with a smirk, trailing teasing kisses down John chest until he came to lay between John’s knees. With a smile up at his husband, he spread John’s knees wide, giving himself access to everything between John’s muscular legs.
The candelabra nodded by bending his torso in half, somehow looking apologetic on his small, silver face, "Yes, sorry about that, it's just the master is a bit-tetchy sometimes" he ended with a grimace, indicating that the master was a bit worse than just tetchy.
“Then if someone listens from the street, they will hear you moaning happily like a good boy, nothing to be ashamed of,” John replied steadily, and Sherlock buried his face into the couch cushions with a mortified huff.
Sherlock cleared his throat and took a deep breath before replying. The conversation had barely started and he was already having a hard time continuing it, but John needed to know, and he needed to talk about it. "They were after you," he said, "Before I hmm... before I jumped, Moriarty threatened you. I had to bring them all in."
As Sherlock continued talking John felt a growing sense of affection for the detective. After everything they had been through already he never ceased to amaze him with how human he really was, how much he truly cared and how afraid he was to show it. John needed to show him that there was nothing to be afraid of; caring for other people was normal, sacrificing yourself for other people was admirable. In one of those rare shows of affection and his own leap of faith John pushed Sherlock carefully off of him and turned the detective so that they were facing each other.
When he entered the room he noticed that Sherlock had gone back to sleep. He was curled up right in the middle of the bed and had wrapped the sheets around himself. John set the tray down on the bedside table and quietly laughed to himself. He no longer found this particular sight surprising seeing as the detective often elected to sleep naked, a fact which John was most definitely not complaining about, and ended up stealing all the bedding for himself.
"I wanted to have a look at the bruises, if you don't mind, make sure everything's healing nicely," John suggested.
“I’m starving,” John announced and dug into his food straight away. Sherlock however, was still sitting rather awkwardly by the edge of the bed and staring intently at the wall. “What’s the matter?”
"I knew you two would work things out sooner or later," he said with a smile on his face. It was clear he was happy for the two of them and John was glad for the support.
After a few long seconds he broke the kiss and whispered quietly in the detective's ear. "I wouldn't have it any other way."
"A shouting match by the look of it," replied Sherlock, keeping an eye on the young boy who was now wandering aimlessly away from his parents.
"Yes, Sherlock, I'm right here. I'm right here," John replied, as he ran a hand soothingly through Sherlock's curls.
He wasn’t surprised that John had wanted to sleep not long after coming back from to the flat. He had been working late at the surgery and when it was finally his day off Sherlock had him running around London.
They were both sweaty, groaning, breathing heavily. John's hips would bear the marks of Sherlock's fingers for days, John's ankles kept pushing Sherlock forward, further inside John and the doctor wrapped his arms around Sherlock's neck and kissed him hastily, then moved down to the detective's neck and started sucking.
Sherlock had been worried at first that he would not be able to convey his feelings for John in an acceptable manner. He'd always loathed sentiment, but perhaps that was because it had never been directed at the right people. He remembered a past conversation with John, "Not much cop this caring lark.", and now realised how mistaken he had been. He hadn't understood back then, the blustering bone-deep need to make sure someone else knew how loved they were, how amazing they were. And John was amazing. And Sherlock did love him. And so he often found himself giving in to sentiment and doing things that were very much unexpected such as making tea for John in the mornings, playing soft melodies on the violin at night when he knew John was trying to sleep or simply going to bed at night to make sure John wasn't alone.
"I didn't want to be alone," Sherlock admitted, "I just... I wanted to apologise for my behaviour since my return." The pieces were slotting into place, John was slowly starting to understand why Sherlock was talking about this. "The mysterious appearance, the sulking, the running away, the drugs, now the accident."
She came in shortly after he settled on the sofa trying to calm his nerves and resisting the urge to call Mycroft. He knew it wouldn't help if Sherlock knew he had involved his brother, but if Sherlock didn't come back soon he wouldn't have another choice.
"Sorry I woke you up," he said, hoping that John would just go back to sleep. But John opened his eyes fully and sat up. He eyed Sherlock critically, clearly trying to assess the state he was in. He noticed the tapping foot, the slight tremor in his hands and his dilated pupils.
And suddenly everything clicked into place; the abandoned experiment, the lying down in the middle of the day, the head rush, the nausea and the sensitivity to light. “It’s not just a headache though, is it, Sherlock? It’s a bloody migraine.”
They held on to one another, joined at every possible end, arms and legs around each other, mouths now connected until their muscles relaxed and they collapsed against one another completely spent.
He walked over to Sherlock, dropped a quick kiss on his lips, and rolled the sleeve up so that Sherlock could pass his arm cast through, and then repositioned it on the sling, though Sherlock still uttered a few choice words. John helped him put on his trousers, socks and shoes, but held on to Sherlock's coat knowing that it would only cause the detective more pain to try to put it on.
Sherlock looked affronted by the ultimatum, but recognised that maybe not eating for three days was a bit not good.
Before Sherlock had a chance to pull away John grabbed him and wrapped the detective's arms around his waist, effectively bringing him closer. The breakfast tray lay precariously on the edge of the bed as Sherlock balanced himself on his knees, chest pressed close to John's, and they remained connected by their lips. Tongues slipped out and teeth clashed as their kisses deepened, desire and need clear in the way their tongues rolled together and fought for dominance over the kiss.
Now John and Sherlock were on their way back to Baker Street, and Sherlock couldn’t stop his mind from wandering. His memory was still a little fuzzy but John had filled in most of the blanks.
John felt his head sink lower in Sherlock’s chest and looked up to see that the detective had fallen asleep, his head now tilted back against the armrest. He was tired as well, the long days at work and now the concussion had taken a lot out of him and he just wanted to get some sleep, but he knew from experience that the sofa was a horrible place to do it. He yawned lazily and stretched, his arms reaching back behind his head, which woke Sherlock up. The detective sat up suddenly, bringing John up with him once again, and started frantically looking around the room.
She watched as Sherlock tried to speak, opening and closing his mouth several times before he finally got the words out. “Y-yes,” he stuttered, “I have… asthma.”
He hadn't believed a single word that Sherlock had told him on that rooftop. He refused to believe that Sherlock was a fake. He had seen his brilliant mind at work on every crime scene, every case, every day. Which was why it had angered him so much when people had started believing the lies that Moriarty was spinning. But it had been relatively simple after Sherlock's death to prove that he had been innocent. Weeks and weeks spent interrogating anyone who had ever spoken to Sherlock finally proved that he had not orchestrated any of the crimes he had solved. Alibi after alibi surfaced and the Yard had been forced to acknowledge the fact that Sherlock had been on their side all along. A more thorough investigation into Richard Brook had shown that no one had actually ever heard of him and while this had by no means cleared Sherlock's name with the press it had cleared his name with Scotland Yard, though that was the least of his problems now.
"What is it, Sherlock?" John sighed. Sherlock had been extremely restless today. After John's promise to provide him with old case files yesterday Sherlock had been asking him every five minutes when he would be getting them.
He left the living room, went up to his room and sat quietly on the edge of the mattress sipping his tea.
A lot of promises were made that day, many of which- if not all- had been all but unspoken in their time together already, because they had never needed words to communicate before. They simply knew what the other felt, thought or needed because they knew each other so well, and because deep down, they felt the same, and they understood.
But this time nothing was certain, and Sherlock might still make it. Mycroft would make sure that Sherlock got the best care possible; he had that power in his hands. Anything that Sherlock needed he would get, anything to save his life. He would be fine. They would all be fine.
"Will do." Lestrade said, as he settled on the seat John had just vacated. "You need to take care of yourself, John. He's going to need you when he wakes up, you need to be there for him."
John nodded his understanding and got up, walking downstairs towards the kitchen. Sherlock sat down in his chair in his usual thinking pose, his hands steepled underneath his chin.
Sherlock walked over to where John was standing, clearly still slightly disoriented, and kissed him. The abruptness took John by surprise in his sleep addled state but he felt his body respond automatically. He lifted his hands up to cup Sherlock's face and moved his lips around Sherlock. Soon after he felt Sherlock's tongue prying into his mouth and he opened up willingly. The kiss continued for a few more seconds, seconds when John's mind was completely blank. He could concentrate on nothing but the feel of Sherlock's lips on his own. John broke the kiss apart, taking a deep breath to replace the oxygen they had both failed to take in, and rested his forehead against Sherlock's, still cupping the detective's face. When he finally opened his eyes he noticed the shadows beneath Sherlock's eyes, which he had kept closed, and how much weight the detective was leaning against him.
“There, all you needed was a cuddle, didn’t you, sweetheart.” John said, as if to himself, but Sherlock closed his eyes as a pulsing sensation slipped down his abdomen and settled in his groin. God, he loved when John called him sweet names.
Michael seemed curious about Sherlock, and John indulged him, “Sherlock and I have been living together for two years, he is absolutely brilliant, I’ve never met a man quite like him before. His ability to look at you, and see you, pull out the deepest parts of you, is truly amazing.” John’s mind flashed with images of Sherlock- the two of them laughing on the steps of 221B, chasing down the latest criminal, sitting in their armchairs, John watching Sherlock play the violin…
“That,” John growled, backing Sherlock up to the edge of the bed until he fell back with a startled grunt, and John leaned over him predatorily, “that was the single most erotic thing I have ever seen. I want to consume you.”
“Do you-that is,” Sherlock cleared his throat, “do you want to read this with me?” When the beast looked on in confusion, Sherlock amended, “I mean, I’ll read it aloud. For you. With you, I mean.”
John smiled fondly at Sherlock’s well-hidden nervousness (well-hidden to anyone but John), and he steeled himself.
“I have some shopping to do for a case, I shouldn’t be gone too long. Laters!” He called, slamming the sitting room door to 221B and bounding down the stairs like a child on Christmas morning.
Sherlock, however, had a different idea. Clutching John close to him, Sherlock traced the seam of John's lips with his tongue, seeking entrance which John gave with a low groan. Sherlock slide his velvety tongue into John's mouth, the two of them sucking and gently nipping at one another's mouth, both feeling the first throbs of arousal swirling in their groins as they continued to passionately kiss.
- you were made to do this-“ John panted out, stroking Sherlock’s curls and being careful not to tug too hard. Sherlock smiled at John’s poetry, secretly enjoying his attempt to verbalize his pleasure, and decided it was time to take it one step further. Trailing kisses back up to John’s face, he kissed John’s lips a few times to distract him as Sherlock reached over and grabbed the slick from the bedside table.
And when her voice said John’s name, even in her dismissive, haughty tone, it sent shivers down the injured soldier’s back. Somehow, her infatuation was more than physical.
Sherlock was walking up the dirt pathway home, still mulling over his encounter with Moriarty, when he saw Philip running towards the stables in a panic. Shocked, Sherlock dropped the errands and ran over to the horse.
It didn’t last long though, as John held Sherlock down with his muscled arms, keeping him flush in his lap, nipping at his neck and moving their twined hands to Sherlock’s body, holding his hips utterly still and still buried in Sherlock. He released one hand to hit Sherlock's arse with a sharp
But Sherlock, with an impish grin, squirmed on John’s cock, moaning loudly to the ceiling, and John’s control broke, holding Sherlock’s hips and ramming up into him, incited by Sherlock’s teasing. They rocked together feverishly for perhaps a few minutes, until John reached up to tug at Sherlock's sensitive nipples, causing Sherlock to erupt, his cock pulsating untouched onto his and John’s stomachs as John leaned forward to kiss Sherlock through his orgasm, swallowing his cries of unreserved delight.
“I am fine, Lestrade, merely concentrating on the task at hand,” Sherlock bit out, trying desperately to achieve his usual arrogant tone and falling miserably short, his slightly voice ringing higher and more breathless rather than low and commanding.
,” he trailed off in a moan as John continue to fuck him, Sherlock’s cock began to harden once again from the endless stimulation and he felt John smirking behind him.
,” Sherlock snarled back, crossing his arms over his chest and trying to adopt a haughty expression on his blushing face, and failing.
“Oh, J-John please,” Sherlock begged, but John would have none of it, standing up and circling the chair like a lion circles its prey, his eye glittering with dark promise.
“There, all clean,” John murmured in the quiet backroom, the only sounds now the two of them sharing breathes back and forth, their chest rising and falling together.
Since the confession two weeks ago, Sherlock and John had been easing into their relationship naturally. Sherlock was at a bit of a loss, having never been in a relationship before, but John Watson is endlessly chivalrous and decides that his lovely detective deserves to be dated properly.
Sherlock was interrupted by the beast swiping at him with it’s great paws, and Sherlock jumped back barely in time to save himself from being mauled, but a blossom of red still bloomed across one pale collarbone from a claw that made its mark, deeply ripping into the soft flesh there.
“Thank you, you look very fine as well. Princely, even,” Sherlock responded, realizing too late what he had implied and wishing that he could take it back. It was too late; the beast was staring at him curiously, without a hint of anger, but a look of deep contemplation gracing his features.
“Would complete you as a human being," John interrupted, leaning forward and catching Sherlock’s plump lips in a soft kiss, just the barest brushing of lips against one another, but Sherlock could taste John’s tea and an underlying flavor that was just
John stepped back to admire his beautiful figure, with his arms above his head Sherlock’s lithe body was elongated, his back tensing slightly, his arse in the air was positively glowing as it sloped gently upwards.
But more than beautiful, he was intelligent. Witty without being cruel, as love had surrounded his upbringing with endless opportunities to grow into a kindhearted young man.
“Sherlock, reach your hands back,” John instructed, and Sherlock obeyed with a questioning look on his face, before John took his hands and placed them on this own backside.
He held Rosie close, cradling her against his chest as if she were a newborn, and refused to take his eyes away from her angelic face for even an instant.
Looking around the small collection of lingerie and panties that the saleswoman had laid out for him, Sherlock decided to be adventurous and with a nod he pulled out his wallet.
Sherlock’s eyes fluttered closed and she leaned against John’s neck. She smelled of citrus, rain and gunpowder. It was an intoxicating, complicated mixture that perfectly defined the woman herself. Sherlock's hand accidentally brushed against John's amply chest and she clenched her legs together at the sensation.
“I-I was looking for some lingerie,” Sherlock murmured, stepping closer to the storefront, and the woman opened the door, holding it and gesturing Sherlock inside.
Sherlock nodded and followed silently, feeling slightly guilty that she had been so rude to the woman who had practically raised her; but she was so frustrated! Every day, to be no more than an object to be used or dismissed at the will of others, to have no freedom, no choices, it was destroying her.
He had never felt so ridiculously, insanely happy. And when Sherlock looked up, feeling John’s gaze on his face, looked up, bemusement written over his features.
"Sherlock, you know better than to touch yourself without permission. You know what that means," John said, moving over to the bed and sitting down, patting his lap seriously but with a twinkle in his eyes.
He leaned down, stepping into the panties and pulling them up his smooth, now hairless legs, shivering delightedly at the feeling. Settling them in place, Sherlock gasped as he felt the garment hug his skin and, more imperatively, separate his arse cheeks and rub against his arsehole when he so much as shifted.
“Color?” John asked quietly, and Sherlock thought for a moment, before answering, “still green, John.”
And John…. Well, John’s hands were clenched as if stopping himself from getting up from the chair, embracing Sherlock, and perhaps engaging in acts that would be inappropriate in front of Mrs. Hudson.
“You will join me for dinner. This is not a request” the beast demanded in his usual low tone, with a growl barely hidden underneath the tone, and Sherlock pulls himself up to his full height to reply.
“You look wonderful,” she said sincerely, and Sherlock nodded in agreement, gulping slightly at his flare of arousal.
and Sherlock, caught between the two inescapable and inexorable pleasures came, the dream dissolving as the lovely pulsations faded into waking.
“John, John please,” Sherlock whined, tugging at his restraints fruitlessly as John’s hard member pressed teasingly, torturously, against his aching bum.
“I’m just glad-“ John coughed, his breathing becoming more labored by the second, “that I got to see you, one last time.”
John stood up, and with a nod and a farewell, he dumped his coffee in the nearest bin and started home.
“Sorry Mrs. H” John called as he herded Sherlock up the stairs, zipping up his pants and winking at Mrs. Hudson who huffed in fond exasperation at her two tenants who reminded her of the sons she never had.
“Ohhhhh-OHHH-“ Sherlock’s moans grew as his hands clenched the edge of his seat, throwing his head back and rocking against the constant vibrations coming from inside his arse.
Two days later, the castle and their enchanted residents had settled down from the panic inducing events from the night Sherlock ran away.
But soon, the Prince became hardened by the sights and sounds of battles waged for land, money, and power,
. Sherlock turned around and came face to face with a candelabra, only this one had animated features and was-
Sherlock bit his lip and looked at John shyly, still feeling vulnerable from his and John’s swift relationship change from flat mates and friends to lovers in a distinctively kinky physical relationship.
John awoke to an extraordinarily sunny day, normally this far to the coast it was grey and gloomy in England, but today a sliver of sunlight was streaming through the windows of his tattered curtains. John sighed in annoyance, the sunlight reminded him of better days.
"You know I do, Sherlock. I have to go to this investment opportunity, but know I will miss you" he replied, looking up to his son that was currently staring out the window with a downtrodden expression. Siger did not wish to leave his son looking so unhappy, "Sherlock, you didn't tell me what gift you want for when I return."
After a moment, Sherlock went limp in John’s grasp, winching with every strike but knowing, deep in his heart, that he needed John to punish him.
Reaching over, fumbling slightly, Sherlock grasped the lube and drizzled it onto his dexterous fingers, taking a deep breath before reaching down to rub over his quivering opening, the muscle clenching with anticipation and trepidation. Sherlock had never penetrated himself before, never having felt the need to achieve orgasm, but now, now Sherlock felt a deep ache inside of him, and he slowly, slowly, pushed his index finger in, his mouth in an ‘O’ of surprise at the automatic feeling of fullness that quenched his need for something inside of him.
. His overstimulation and lack of experience causing the virginal young man to positively lose control.
“You know nothing” Sherlock intoned, looking down at herself and gesturing wildly, “I will not simply let down my dead parents if I do not marry. I am preventing our people from accessing aid that can help us win this war. You fought in the army and played your part, now it is my turn. I must play a beautiful little fool.”
After a moment longer of rocking, Sherlock’s body went completely slack, his body falling into unconscious exhaustion from the inexorable pleasure and sensations pummeling his body, his mouth falling slightly open and his eyelashes fluttering against his scarlet stained cheeks.
Quickly Sherlock turned his face back to bury it in the pillow, most likely preparing to muffle his moans, John thought happily.
“He also told me he released you, that he gave you your freedom,” she continued, and Sherlock released a choked sob, looking down to the mirror and the pink rose the beast had gifted him. How had it come to this? After such happiness, he was going to be thrust into Moriarty's arms.
John knew Sherlock must go, go to a place he could not follow. The townspeople would kill him if he went with Sherlock, and Sherlock did not belong in his world. A beauty such as Sherlock deserved to go out into the world and live out his dreams, to grow fully and not become stunted by imprisonment from the light.
Leaning a hand forward, he released the right clamp, quickly leaning down to latch onto the abused nipple and sucking it gently to sooth the lingering pinch.
John, listening to the men’s conversation as she lunged back and forth, bristled at the comment about her lesser status; but she stifled her urge to correct and kept her eyes forward and focused- the perfect soldier.
”I know it isn’t far, my dear, the way you’re treated. I know you never wished for this life, but please,” she pleaded, pulling back to gaze into Sherlock’s intelligent eyes, “please find a way to be happy in the life you’ve been given.”
And that was how Sherlock became, quite literally, trapped on John’s hard cock, sitting naked in his lap with John’s large hands holding his hips down with a punishing force,
Suddenly, the fear from his thoughts and dreams seemed so far away, so inadequate, when compared to John’s gentle kisses in the safety of their bedroom.
Sherlock was lying on the couch, pretending to be in her mind palace, but was really attempting to deduce the meaning of the flowers John had brought home. Who were they for? Or, perhaps they were a gift from an admirer.
But Michael, well, he was beautiful and young; everything John enjoyed in a man, remembering the homesick, youthful recruits who had been soothed by his expertise, when John had taught them how to pleasure a man, how to offer themselves fully.
Sherlock told John she was going to the loo for a shower, and she left the water running as she got dressed and did her make-up, only turning the water off while putting on the final touches.
Sherlock’s chest was heaving quickly, but he made no move to stop John, nodding at him when he peered into his eyes questioningly. Sherlock shrugged off the shirt, and tossed it to the side of the bed, allowing John to reach towards his lower half, his bespoke trousers tented in arousal.
Sherlock obviously wanted John to take him, mark him fully, but John was hesitant. Not only was Sherlock a virgin, but John was quite large, and he didn't want to hurt his inexperienced lover. At the same time, John was also quite anxious to take Sherlock to bed properly. To show him how he should be loved and cherished, in the bedroom and always.
Sherlock was busy in the bathroom, painting the red stripe to finish the pride flag on his cheek and putting the finishing touches on his outfit.
John watched their interaction with amazement. This man, who had been imprisoned just over two weeks ago, was joking around with his house-manager turned teapot, playing daily with Rosie, and finding new adventure’s every day while locked in his gilded cage.
“Mycroft, I won't be kept here as a prisoner in my own home,” Sherlock asserted, trying to keep her ragged temper under control, but she knew Mycroft observed the tremble of her swollen lip and the hitch of her breath.
He gestured wildly, appearing out of place among the grey surroundings, “we’ve been called to the palace for an audience with the King! A quest, an untold journey John!”
Sherlock gasped when John strode forward, picking him up in a swift move and carrying him over to their bed, laying him down gently,
He shook himself and his amorous thoughts away, focusing on the dimly lite silhouette of Sherlock on the bed.
John cried gently, hiccuping slightly, as Sherlock continued to rock in and out of him steadily, slowly, reaching down a hand to grasp John’s leaking manhood lying against his abdomen, teasing at the sensitive head with his thumb and he stroked up and down. After a moment more, insurmountable bliss overcame the two men quite unexpectedly, their orgasms beginning in tandem as they breathed out their cries into each other’s mouths, the gentle waves causing their pleasure to extend out with John clenching around Sherlock tightly and Sherlock lightly stroking John’s cock.
"Here, Sherlock, put you hand there and- no, don't put too much pressure all at once- let it build" John instructed as he grasped Sherlock's weeping erection and instructed Sherlock to do the same for him, both of them gently rubbing against each other's abdomen's in a natural movement.
Sherlock breathed slowly, his chest rising and falling easily, his mind clearer than it had been in ages.
His inner mind teased, and he blushed brighter, thinking about John. The beast and the man from his dream, morphing into one person in his mind, inseparable from one another.
Trying to quell her disconcerting excitement at the proximity of her guard, she hurried through her task in order to gain some space from the vulnerable position she was in. She was utterly naked, with a practical stranger less than ten feet away; and yet, she felt safe in the ex-captain's company all the same.
So... this was all me. My mind is a dark place to be, apparently *chuckles* Did I drink a little too much wine while writing this chapter? Maybe. More rimming, face fucking, spanking and a surprise ;) Enjoy! Kudos/comments appreciated.
Looking down at the bubbles, which mostly blocked her nudity, Sherlock heard the door open and close quietly. John did not approach any closer to the bath, but rather stayed firmly planted where she had entered, and silence stretched through the room.
Now, just over two years later, he and Sherlock were still together at 221B, and John was content with their domesticity; tea rings left of the coffee table and their chairs well worn. But Sherlock had been acting oddly, well oddly for him, for the past few days, skittish and nervous, one could say, and John wanted to figure out why.
It’s like an ache that hasn’t gone away, despite the two years they’ve lived in platonic contentment.
fingers in Sherlock’s gently opening entrance, the muscle giving way for John to tease at Sherlock sensitive rim and swelling prostate.
John felt a sharp pang somewhere deep within his chest and wondered, for a moment, if it was possible….
“John, you must come, someone’s stolen a rose!” Sherlock gestured wildly about, his ebony curls bouncing from the movement and Sherlock’s face slightly flushed from his exertion and rising energy.
“You’ll need some help with the corset,” the saleswoman called from just outside the curtain, and Sherlock nodded to himself.
Privacy was a luxury that royals did not have, so Sherlock quickly stood almost nude as the servants finished preparations for her bath while tapping her foot impatiently.
Sherlock was running errands in Sussex, their family needing eggs and some bread. The maid volunteered to go, but Sherlock claimed the need for a bit of exercise and went in her stead. Truly, Sherlock needed time away from his prying brother and sister. They were so wrapped up in material goods that they never appreciated anything, and Sherlock felt smothered by their incessant whining.
Sherlock untied Philip’s tangled reigns and turned to continue walking down the forest path towards home, but he paused for a brief moment.
ignoring Sherlock's amused expression and gestured for them all to sit. As they all sat at the dining room table, they began retelling the events of the night before, basking in the light coming in from the window and the chance to start afresh.
John watched him wiggle for a moment, softening his blows to the hole into small taps, his fingers tickling lightly against the hole and watching as shivers erupted over Sherlock’s muscled back at the action.
“Why did you get a spanking, Sherlock?” John asked seriously after allowing a moment for Sherlock to settle, and Sherlock’s face, which had faded slightly, its scarlet hue dimming after his pleasurable release, enflamed anew at the fact they were going to talk about his punishment.
Warning: Smut. The whole thing, twelve pages of it. I would say I'm ashamed, but then I would be lying ;)
John turned Sherlock around, gazing up at him with equal parts adoration and lust shining in his mischievous eyes. John wondered for a moment how he was so lucky as to be the man to tame Sherlock Holmes.
Two days ago, the boy had shattered all his defenses in a moment of kindness, bringing his jailer back to his castle and promising to stay with the beast, honoring his side of the bargain. John knew he didn’t deserve Sherlock's kindness after frightening him so, but he found he was grateful that the boy agreed to stay with him anyways.
John motioned for Sherlock to get up, and he did, standing before John and rubbing his arse like a scolded toddler, pout and all, his cock standing out and pointing at John’s face.
Sherlock watched John carefully for any pain as he pushed another long, dexterous finger into John’s opening, grinning when he saw John’s eyelids flutter in pleasure, a different pleasure from penetrating someone.
Sherlock was gazing at John with teasing eyes, a faux-innocent façade, “yes John? See something you like?”
“This is for you, come here whenever you want, Sherlock,” the beast announced softly, adoring the wondering expressions crossing the young man’s face. He deserved so much more, but for now, the library seemed like a strong start.
"But Siger isn't insane," he whined, let down that the money would not be his after all. Moriarty only shook his head in response.
“I adore you, Sherlock,” John said, kissing Sherlock deeply, nipping at her lower lip and clutching her close.
Finally, John lowered them down so they rested snug up together underneath the duvet chest to chest, feeling each other’s heartbeats. While the recently solved triple homicide case had them both running high on endorphins, they hadn’t slept in 30 hours and John knew that Sherlock would need to unwind after such an exhilarating case. Sherlock began to grumble his tell tale-
“Alrighty boys, for our next plan, we are going to make an honest man out of me! Call the warden of the local insane asylum, I have a new patient he is going to want to meet,” he said with a slow curling grin, containing the promise of pain, and he outlined his plan to strike a deal with the warden, either Sherlock marries Moriarty or his father will be forced into the insane asylum due to his lunatic fantasy's of a beast, which everyone heard just now. With that evidence, Moriarty can claim that Sherlock's father is a danger to their society and should be locked away somewhere "safe."
“I know, John,” Sherlock said back, meeting John’s gaze levelly and placing John’s unoccupied hand over his heart; expressing his love for John in his devotion, submission, and every quickened beat-
“I stand out too much,” Sherlock whimpered, a few more tears streaking down his flushed face. “They call me a f-freak” he muttered, turning away, ashamed.
"Hmm... It has long been a philosophy of mine that the little things are infinitely more important," Sherlock said, sounding more like his majesty with his usual haughty tone.
A glowing caught his eye from the corner of the room, and Sherlock follow it to an enclosure with held a wilting red rose. It was glowing, floating as if supernatural, and Sherlock had a desperate want to touch the magical object, so hidden. Sherlock was entranced, and saddened, by the magical dying rose, the sight being almost too sad to bear for some reason. It was as if beauty and magic was dying. Sherlock reached over to take the glass casing off of the rose, reaching forward to touch the object.
As they walked, Sherlock’s ball gown danced around her long legs and created a waterfall effect in the corridors of the palace.
Sherlock, learning John’s preferred techniques, began to tilt his head down further, allowing John more access, lightly bumping their noses together.
“It’s time to wake up now, Sherlock,” a deep voice echoed in his ear, a voice he had heard many times.
“I-“ many reasons to say no flew through Sherlock’s mind, but, for the first time, her bodily instincts took over and she found herself nodding before she had made the conscious choice to agree.
John thought, setting their mugs down on the coffee table and reaching towards Sherlock, grasping him by his upper arms and settling him on the sofa. John sank down next to him, and reached forward, grabbing the tea and pushing it into Sherlock’s still unresponsive hands.
“Thank you, Mrs. Hudson, these look delightful,” John said with a smile, having recovered his manners in an instant.
“Could I get your picture, I work for a small local LGBTQ+ blog and this breaking news would be great for our media presence.”
,” Sherlock begged as John began to stroke around Sherlock’s prostate in deft movements, his cock flushed a deep pink against his heaving abdomen, his dark chestnut curls falling around the pillow like a fallen renaissance angel.
“John,” Sherlock whined after a minute of this, still embarrassing, treatment of his arse, and John finally pulled the cloth away with a chuckle and two bristly kisses placed reverently on Sherlock’s arse cheeks as he pulled the cloth out of Sherlock's, now clean, arse.
Mrs. Hudson sniffed, still glaring at Sherlock, while coming over and shoving a chemise over her head and mussing her curls, “That’s right! Now, you will attend this meeting and employ all the graces that I taught you, and I will not hear another word about it. Is that quite clear?”
He had known he wanted John in his bed, giving him pleasure, but he hadn't realized how much he had come to want this easy intimacy that John always achieved with other people, but Sherlock was unable to.
Sherlock dashed down the familiar corridors of his home for the past two months, feeling fresh tears trace down his face as he hurried to pack and begin the journey to Sussex.
“Suck me, now,” John demanded, grasping a fistful of Sherlock’s hair and gently rubbing, knowing how sensitive Sherlock’s hair follicles are and using the knowledge to his advantage. Sherlock grasped the end of John’s member and began to sink his mouth slowly down, until over half of John’s impressive cock was sheathed in the wet, velvety heat.
"I don't want to get to know him!" Sherlock shouted suddenly, hands grasping at his arms and feeling a chill, despite the fact he was still wearing all his winter layers from last night, "I don't want anything to do with him!"
Sherlock was hypnotized by the man’s bright blonde hair and carefree smile, as if he hadn’t a care in the world. His eyes, a soft blue color that sat above his rounded cheeks, reminded Sherlock of his family’s trip to the ocean before his mother died. He felt… Safe.
A little too beautiful for a boy, a little too quirky with science experiments that blew up and singed the tips of his curls, a little too observant and not good enough with social queues to know when to keep his deductions to himself.
"Sherlock," John replied, in much the same tone. There was no need for words. Their desire was clearly expressed in their voice and their every touch.
Sherlock's nightmares had gone away, John's were kept away by Sherlock's presence and everything was back to normal now, but not quite the same.
John nodded curtly, understanding Sherlock’s need for reassurance. “That would be the painkillers they gave you. It wasn’t long ago, so it’s no wonder you’re really feeling them.”
John was pleasantly surprised when he arrived home and the flat was still intact. Regardless of Sherlock's dismissals of weird experiments John was sure that he'd been up to something, he just didn't know what. Sherlock, however, was nowhere to be found. There was a pleasant smell in the air- definitely not from experiments- and the flat was surprisingly warm.
He slipped out of Sherlock, panting, and sat back on his heels. Sherlock started sitting up against the bed, haggard, but clearly pleased. He was grinning widely at John, who was still trying to get his breath back.
He laid a soft kiss on the detective's forehead before turning around to Lestrade, "Where the hell is that ambulance?"
Lestrade left his officers to take care of the scene, and the thief, while he drove Sherlock and John to the hospital. He kept Sherlock company in the waiting room while John was observed, surprised that the detective hadn’t tried to fight his way in.
“Fuck,” he swore as Sherlock wrapped one hand around his cock. He stopped what he was doing so he could take a deep breath and concentrate on not coming right there and then.
Between the occasional shift at the clinic and all the investigate work with Sherlock he hadn’t spent much time at home and he hadn’t spent nearly as much time with Sherlock as he would have liked to. Hopefully they could wrap this up quickly seeing as Lestrade was already on his way and walk back to the flat and settle down with a cuppa.
"Oh God, Sherlock," he moaned. Sherlock was licking at his length from top to bottom, never actually taking him in, but always touching him. His hand snuck out from where it was trapped and he started ghosting his finger over John's arse.
Sherlock seemed reluctant to explain to John why they were going out or where they were going. Was it possible that his conversation with Lestrade had upset him enough that he needed to clear his head? Sherlock was the type to go out just to think- or not think, depending on the case- but usually he went by himself. Why would he want John here?
Molly looked down and fumbled with her hands before replying, clearly she was nervous. "Nothing's wrong, no," she dismissed, "it's just... when I heard you'd been in an accident I was just, worried, you know? I mean, I know you're with John and I'm so happy for the two of you but I still care for you, Sherlock. Not in that way but, I consider you my friend."
He kissed Sherlock’s lips, lingering with very little space between them after pulling away. “I’m right here.”
They both inched forward and their lips met in a deep kiss, John's tongue springing out to lick at Sherlock's lips and then down his jaw all the way to his neck. Sherlock was already making delicious sounds, clearly pleased with the development of the situation. John started edging them both towards the sofa where Sherlock lowered himself carefully with John straddling him.
Getting changed wasn't as much trouble as it had been at the hospital seeing as Sherlock decided he was going to sleep in his pants, something John thought would be rather distracting- which was quite possibly why Sherlock did it. They curled up under the covers, Sherlock fighting to find a comfortable position that didn't aggravate any of his injuries too much and finally settled on lying straight on his back with John resting his head on Sherlock's pillow and their hands interlocked over the covers.
“I have to say,” John started as he delivered a particularly firm thrust- Sherlock moaned audibly. “I sure as shit am glad we’re finally doing this.” He chuckled and watched in amusement as the man beneath him rolled his eyes
"A capable professional to ensure your shoulder is healing properly and you don't hurt yourself again," John replied sternly.
John was extremely relieved when Sherlock slowly opened his eyes. He tried to sit up straight away but John carefully pushed him down, moving the pillow back to its rightful place. He heard Sherlock mutter something under his breath which sounded a lot like 'stupid transport'. John rolled his eyes and took Sherlock's wrist in his hand. He placed two fingers on the inside of his wrist and using his own watch to monitor the time he measured the detective's heart rate noting that, while still slightly elevated, it seemed to have slowed down considerably.
John stopped abruptly and sat back on his heels. He heard a disgruntled whine leave Sherlock's lips and laughed. Clearly Sherlock had been enjoying it.
John dipped his head down slightly to kiss Sherlock, telling him he understood and would be there for him whenever he needed him, forever. “You’re welcome.”
John knew there must have been a good reason for what he did, but he never thought it would be something like this. "He threatened me?" he gaped.
"I should have known better than to think you'd cleared everything up. You probably hid everything in there," John teased. He knew that wasn't true, Sherlock had done a very good job cleaning the flat, and he understood that Sherlock didn't want to discard of any of his experiments, but he liked to see Sherlock squirming and trying to explain himself.
They both sat quietly on the sofa sipping their tea and then Sherlock stretched himself across the sofa with John comfortably positioned between the detective’s legs with his head resting on Sherlock’s chest. In this new positioned- and more relaxed then he’d been all day- John started to feel the pull of sleep. He turned on his side slightly, using Sherlock as a pillow, and closed his eyes.
John used his hands to push himself onto the table and opened his legs up so that Sherlock could stand between them, which gave him access to every part of John he wanted.
While John washed the dishes Sherlock checked his blog. There were a few cases that needed his attention, but they were all simple enough and he could easily solve them when he returned from the case with Lestrade tonight. He closed his laptop as John came back into the living room.
A small, tight smile appeared on John’s face and he tried to reciprocate it, but the comfort of having him there and the pull of unconsciousness was too strong and so Sherlock drifted off once again.
It was nothing they hadn’t done before, though usually it tended to happen the other way around. Perhaps now it was time Sherlock looked after John for a change.
The paramedics watched worriedly as Sherlock started flagging. He was slouched on the sofa, head lolled to the side as he lost the strength to hold it up himself. While Matt relayed the steadily worsening observations and tried to rouse Sherlock, Lauren administered the steroids, hoping that they would take effect quickly. She spoke to Sherlock as she worked, trying to keep him awake, but it was clear that he wasn’t taking anything in. Having heard the earlier conversation, she even asked about John, but all she got in reply was a muffled groan behind the mask.
John decided to dispose of his trousers and shirt as soon as they reached the bedroom. He took them off and dropped them on the floor before turning around to Sherlock. “You’re wearing way too many clothes.”
Lestrade looked much too pleased with himself and Sherlock shot him a death glare that would have silenced just about everyone, but Lestrade just burst out laughing. “I don’t see why you have such a problem with people knowing, Sherlock.”
John wrapped Sherlock's arm over his shoulders and wrapped his own around Sherlock's waist, effectively freeing Lestrade, and brought him over to the sofa, laying him down gently. He went over to the kitchen, heated up Sherlock's dinner and brought it over to him. All the while no one said a single word; John too angry, Sherlock too tired and Lestrade too hesitant.
He moved like a ghost through his own flat, picking up pictures and papers, putting things back where they belonged, before finally moving to clean up the cups of unfinished tea he always left around, knowing John or Mrs Hudson would take care of them later. They always did. He was theirs to care for. To watch over. To protect.
“Keep your lips parted until it dries,” he murmured quietly, glancing up at Jim’s eyes that looked obsidian this close, like endless dark pools drawing him in, and which were watching him with a similar intensity. Suppressing a shiver, but not his interest, John leaned in a little bit closer and gently blew on Jim’s lip to hasten the drying. He watched Jim’s eyes close, heard the man swallow, and had to fight the overwhelming desire to kiss the man again. At this rate, Jim’s lip would never heal, and he desperately wanted it to.
And what would happen when John had finally had enough of Sherlock’s inability to perform and he realised he had his pick of the litter to choose from? Before, Sherlock had only had to worry about the female specimens, but now that John had fully acknowledged his sexuality there was now yet another gender to worry about taking John away from him.
“Excuse me?” the not-nurse said, standing at his full (which wasn’t much) height, hands crinkling the plastic surrounding the flowers for a moment before he consciously relaxed his grip.
Oh god. He’d made a complete arse of himself, hadn’t he? He felt the shame heat his cheeks again, stretching out his arm to peer blearily down at the face of his watch though even he could tell that it was early yet. Which brought to mind…
It was John’s turn to roll his eyes, standing up to put his now finished tea in the sink. “Not everyone can be a superhuman, Sherlock,” he muttered mostly to himself, back turned to the detective and turned on the tap to run into his cup for a moment before turning it off and wiping off his hands. “Stay off my computer while I’m gone,” he ordered more loudly for the other man to hear, knowing even as he said it that it would only cause the man to much more definitely go through it once he left. “I mean it, Sherlock.”
“Shut up!” John shouted, pressing his hands into his head as though to quiet the insidious words that ate away at him like acid. He breathed heavily, eyes clenched shut, until the roaring in his ears passed again.
Jim nodded, head hanging low, and took the slip from John. He glanced up, hesitating as though he were going to say something, before drooping further and letting out a sigh. “Thank you,” he murmured before turning and heading out the door.
He had spent hours pouring over the mechanics of sex between two men, had used John’s computer to watch the porn that his partner liked, lips thinning when he’d noticed how John was watching more and more plots with just two men, as opposed to the women he’d once preferred. It only made it more obvious about what John wanted. Right. He had to do it.
So no, Jim was most assuredly not pouting, even if he had been so close to getting what he was certain would have been a most brilliant shag, only to be left hard and wanting without even the opportunity to call one of his men to come finish the job off for him. They were fine fellows, excellent with aftercare, but he’d really wanted something new that day. Something new and decidedly John Watson shaped.
When John finally managed to collapse in bed that night, exhausted and a little sore from a scuffle when the pointless running around actually turned into chasing after their suspect and catching the murderer (which turned out to be one of the serial bigamist’s illegal husbands and not the bigamist herself, who also almost became the next victim), he was about ready to just fall asleep and not think until the next day.
“Thanks,” John said with a smile, trying to recapture the ease from earlier. “I’m sure it’ll be great.”
Speaking of the man, he was waiting outside of the bathroom by the time John got out, looking sheepishly enough that it didn’t come off as creepy, holding a drink carrier with three coffee cups in it. “Hi,” the man said when John stepped out towards him. “I didn’t know how you like your coffee, so I got sugar and cream for you as well.”
A benefit of their telepathic communication, he supposed, was that kissing didn’t necessarily have to stop their conversation. Sherlock’s lips curled into a smile against John’s.
Sherlock couldn’t really deny that he saw himself as more robot than man most days, but that had nothing to do with his sexuality. As well, with John, he found himself feeling more and more. Nothing robotic about how his heart yearned for John all these years.
John had been about to just head upstairs to his room when the door to the flat swung open. “Come, John, we have a case!” Sherlock announced in his usual jubilation for cases as he hurriedly began simultaneously pulling on his coat and reaching out for John’s arm to drag him back downstairs.
That didn’t mean that he wasn’t going to go home and have a furious wank while he thought about that towel, however. He was only human, after all.
and not Sherlock. Yes, that would be better, he thought. John bruised, bleeding, begging for him, all the while Sherlock watched until whenever Jim bored of Sherlock’s pet. Then he’d let one of his men in, maybe more than one, let them have John as Sherlock and Jim watched. And then…and then Jim would force Sherlock to his knees to worship his new master. Hm. His new king. Yes, he liked the sound of that.
John teetered on the edge of decisions, before huffing forcefully and sliding his chair over to Jim’s, face gentling. “Jim…what happened?” he asked in clear concern.
John let out a soft grunt as the back of his legs hit the sofa and he tumbled down, but then Sherlock was right there, claiming John’s lips again as he crawled into the man’s lap, knees on either side of the man’s hips and hands settled at his shoulders.
He scowled, thought about asking her to fight him too, before ultimately thinking better of it. He did throw a few choice observations her way, however, and felt a little bit better about himself afterwards. At least his mind was a little clearer. For now.
Lol disclaimer on that I am a broke bitch and I never go to doctor's when I'm hurt or unwell, so any medical thing mentioned is probs vastly incorrect but yolo that's why this is fanfiction and not a textbook. If I make any flubs, just quietly shake your head and forget it okay? Because that's what I do lol.
“Well, maybe I really like this one,” John said back, quickly slipping his phone back into his pocket as he moved to reach for his tea again, eyeing Sherlock in the other armchair. “Be nice to poor Mrs Hudson while I’m gone tonight, Sherlock,” he warned. “You just recently solved a murder, so you should be in high spirits.”
The kissing was marvellous, however. How had he gone so long without a proper snog? And John was certainly good at it. Better than good. Sherlock had been embarrassed at his own attempts, had mentally berated himself for his fumbling and prepared himself for John’s laughter, but instead John had looked kind and patient and together they learned just what the other liked in terms of kissing.
The voice, so familiar, was also so different. It wasn’t his inner voice. Though in his head, it didn’t come from within him. He watched Sherlock, uncomprehending.
John simply snorted, nodding his head. “Right, well, give me a couple minutes to get settled, and then send someone in.” He supposed that there were worst ways to spend an afternoon, and one of those was taking care of your roommate who was a baby in disguise.
John thought about taking Jim to Baker Street, to Sherlock’s den of inquiry, and immediately balked at that. This was much too soon, and Jim definitely seemed far too fragile for that sort of invasive questioning the detective would only all too naturally take up. Not to mention the deductions. Swallowing a grimace, John held an arm out. “There’s a pub nearby. I’ll buy you a drink,” he offered.
“You’ve rejected all the ones I’ve given you!” Lestrade was saying, aggrieved by Sherlock’s continued bullheadedness. “If you want a case so badly, why don’t you take any of the nearly half dozen I’ve mentioned!”
“I don’t know if something bad happened at work, but he took it out on me. Apologized right after, it was only one hit, and I had been having row with him, so I forgave him. But…then it started getting worse. Before I knew it, I was in too deep.” He shuddered, causing John to have to restrain himself from reaching out to comfort him.
Jim set the tea tray on the counter before walking around it to climb on to the other waiting stool there, smiling a little at John as he turned to face him. “I’m really glad you were the one I went to see, even if it had been an accidental meeting,” he quietly said. “It was a happy accident.”
Now, it’s not the first time Sherlock has posed this question to me, I frequently act as a kind of sounding board for him, but there was just something different about his question this time. I don’t know what it was, but I answered as best I could with what little evidence I had, resorting to glancing through the report I had on hand. Given the crude graffiti and senseless destruction, my initial response was that it was a youth, especially considering that the stolen pieces seemed just as senseless. Random silverware and jewellery, including stuff the mother had said was obvious costume jewellery, points to an inexperienced thief. Probably just some hoodlum kid who saw the opportunity and took it. The jewelled egg had been in a place of honour and looked fancy enough for even a kid to recognize its worth, however, judging by the pictures the family had of it. It was a bit gaudy for my taste, but to each their own, I suppose.
Sherlock stared up at John, unable to believe that John truly meant those words. “Then…then you should want sex with me. You should be upset I haven’t put out yet. You should be furious I haven’t held up my end of the deal.”
If John wouldn’t take it because he didn’t want to rape Sherlock, however, then where would that leave them? How long until John left? Who would wish to stay with a repressed, frigid, selfish freak?
When he pulled back from what he considered one of his perfected dominating kisses, he smirked at Jim’s own flushed appearance. “Call me,” he said again, this time accompanied by a wink of his own, and then he was shoving his hands in his pockets and heading for the street where he could flag down a cab.
That didn’t mean he went around flaunting it about or anything. (He might have bought a small flag in ace colours, but he kept it crammed in a drawer between some pages of an unread book, so it wasn’t like he was waving it around or some other such nonsense.) He simply just liked to
His eyes softened, his skin naturally flushed as colour began returning to him, and he softly cupped John’s cheek.
Once he could breathe again, Sherlock felt the corner of his lips curl ever so slightly in an answering smile.
“Oh, Sherlock,” John breathed, wrapping his own arms around the man’s shoulders. They weren’t quaking, but Sherlock still felt on edge. “I love you, you idiot,” he whispered again. “I’m not going to leave just because we don’t have sex. Sex isn’t important. Only this is.”
Sherlock hated being stuck in hospital. It wasn’t his fault the case ended up with him in the bloody Thames in the dead of winter with a cracked rib and abdominal bruising. He could have easily seen to his injuries at home, even with the bad cold he’d seemed to have picked up from the freezing water he’d been submerged in the previous day, but Lestrade had rejected that idea immediately. The idiot.
“I just wanted to say that I’m sorry you’re being paraded before all these men,” John murmured, as if the two women were sharing a secret. Sherlock leaned back against the pillar and felt the cool marble soothe her flushed skin. Oh-
, Sherlock realized, pleased that John had found his release but wishing he could have learned how to please his lover.
Looking over to Sherlock, who was still sleeping innocently, John felt a rush of daring and thrust a newly human hand down the front of his trousers, moaning quietly at the feel of his bare cock after all the years of the appendage being covered in fur.
But Moriarty arrived all the same, along with his underhanded crew and some of the townsfolk, numbering them to be at least twenty in number, holding torches in the dusky twilight with a prison cage tugged behind a horse, the words asylum printed on with morbid red letters.
He was a prince, which was certain by his dress and stature in the portrait. Sherlock searched for a name anywhere on the portrait, but it was not shown. The young man was obviously military, by the way he held himself and his haircut.
Once the two men were done with breakfast, John cleaned up while Sherlock wandered into the sitting room, going over to the couch and lying down in his usual mind palace position, still wrapped in only his sheet.
“What was his name?” Sherlock asked, his voice interrupting the sound of china being cleaned. Mrs. Hudson turned to him with a serious expression on her fragile face.
“Sherlock,” John whispered into the quiet library after a while of holding one another, “do you want to have sex?”
title like armor against the sentiment that shown in his iridescent eyes each time he looked at John.
Sherlock’s eyes fluttered closed in pleasure as John’s cock was fully taken into his body, the feeling of John’s massive member within him causing him to bite his lip to keep from screaming out, and perhaps alarming Mrs. Hudson.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, muttering something about a drama queen, and John was flabbergasted. Was this not the same Sherlock who had run from him in terror only a while ago?
They mingled for a while with their guests, holding hand or brushing against one another as they received well wishes from their family and friends, Sherlock’s Papa and Mrs. Hudson were crying lightly as they greeted the boys with tearful hugs.
Her heart was racing as she took in the unfamiliar surroundings, an oak tree and a clearing. Where was she?
Ever since the last debacle- where Sherlock was dragged back to the palace after stirring a pub brawl from her deductions and earning herself bloody knuckles, a swollen lip, and a black eye- her brother, Mycroft, had finally had enough and put his proverbial foot down.
A hand was placed on his arm, and John took a deep breath, gazing down into Sherlock’s eyes that were filled with sadness and something akin to pity.
But Sherlock, impatient and impetuous as always, refused to wait any longer, whining in bed the night before that John still wouldn’t take him; so John rolled over and sucked him off, harshly and quickly, sending the moody detective into a pleasurable sleep. John had simply smiled, thanking whatever deity was listening that Sherlock Holmes had an off button.
John’s cock was throbbing, hot and needy against the bed sheets beneath him, but he felt a craving for a taste of the arse he had taken so thoroughly the night before.
Sherlock closed his eyes, listening distantly to his whorish cries of pleasure as he sank on John’s cock, completely naked whereas John was completely clothed despite his naked cock, which Sherlock was taking expertly in his well-fucked bum.
The sleepy detective trailed behind, his face stretched in a yawn, and John grinned at the usually manic, unsleeping man being absolutely exhausted.
“Nothing to be ashamed of, love, lots of people from all walks of life come here and we accommodate them all. This is not unusual at all,” she waved a hand in his direction, and Sherlock felt calmed by her blasé reaction to him wanting lingerie for himself, as if it was nothing out of the ordinary.
Sherlock leaned into John's masculine smell, breathing it in as his arousal reached untenable levels, his cock bouncing with every thrust of John's pulsing cock into his dripping hole.
Despite the amount of times he and John had made love, and even engaged in bondage play, he had never felt so exposed.
To his amazement, the boy’s alabaster cheeks turned rosy again and he turned away from the beast and began sorting the books on the table to put way. John was startled at the boys blush; what in the world was he embarrassed about?
“You don’t understand. We need help, Sherlock is lost in the woods with a maniac beast!” He gestured around wildly, trying to get their attention and prove to them the seriousness of the matter.
“Sherlock, what do you know about me? Do you know who I am?” The beast asked plainly, a hint of trepidation and, perhaps hope, lingering in his voice.
John got up, ignoring his half-naked state, and raced across the room to envelope the old woman in a hug, whispering, “none of that
“No, oh no, Philip! Where is my father?” Sherlock asked in a gasp, looking towards the forest where the horse had come running. Making up his mind with a nod, Sherlock mounted Philip and spurred him into movement with a kick and an ordered, “run!”
“Master! A mob is approaching the castle,” Mrs. Hudson exclaimed, rushing into John’s chamber and relaying the news.
, Sherlock thought to himself, blinking away the stinging sensation in his eyes in favor of looking at John. The two men only broke their gazes when Rosie wrapped her tiny arms around their legs, and began tugging to get their attention.
"Lestrade, I can't wear this!" John growled at the candelabra who was holding out his flickering candles in a calming manner.
Sherlock fought in vain to close his legs with a squeaked, "John, don't look there-" but John did not tear his eyes away from Sherlock's small hole, winking slightly in anticipation and nervousness.
“Who is my brilliant detective?” John cooed, and Sherlock realized what John was doing through his hazy fog of arousal. He tried to fight John off half-heartedly, but John merely smirked, stretching his body out so his abdomen was lying directly on top of Sherlock’s trapped cock. Holding Sherlock down with his strength while putting pressure on his leaking member.
He saw the muddle of curls nod slightly before stilling once again. He quickly ran over to the kitchen to fetch some more tablets seeing as it was time to take them again anyway and grabbed a glass of water as well. He took them into the bathroom and set them down so that his hands were free.
John cupped Sherlock's face with his hand and kissed him lightly. "I love you too," he replied and slowly pushed inside Sherlock.
It was then that he realized he was still undressed and quickly ran over to the wardrobe and put on the first thing he laid his hands on. After putting his shoes on he ran downstairs grabbed his jacket and the tray Mrs. Hudson had brought up.
He knew that he didn't want to have anyone else by his side, but was he ready to take the next step? And more importantly, was John? They'd never spoken about marriage before, they'd never even discussed what they were to each other- because they already knew, they were everything- but other people wouldn't understand. Friend, not enough, boyfriend, too casual, partner, that always got the right idea across, but it was still not enough. He needed John to know how much he meant to him, he needed the world to know how much he meant, and no words or terms of endearment would ever be enough.
John took a small foil packet from the drawer and couldn’t keep himself from chuckling as he imagined Sherlock buying condoms. “When exactly did you get these?”
On one of the rare occasions where he managed to fall asleep he was awakened in the middle of the night by a terrible nightmare. He'd had them often while he was away, but he thought he'd been able to chase them away since his return. Evidently he was mistaken. He sat up gasping in pain and holding onto his side where one of his scars was located. The phantom pain was extremely annoying. He knew perfectly well that it was healed, but his brain refused to believe it. He slowly got out of bed and as he was making his way out of the bedroom he felt John shifting. His hopes of not having woken him up were dissipated when he heard him speak.
John narrowed his eyes and shot him a stern look. "Oh yeah, of course, what was I thinking? Just out of curiosity, was that before or after you passed out?"
Surprisingly Sherlock opened his eyes immediately, and after taking in John's form sat up on the sofa balancing himself on one elbow. He rubbed his eyes with his free hand and tried to stifle a yawn, unsuccessfully. "What time is it?” he asked.
"Let me." John coated his hand in lube and grabbed Sherlock's length, preparing him. Sherlock threw his head back, his mouth parted open in pleasure. John rubbed his hand slowly up and down until Sherlock couldn't take it anymore and suddenly took his arm out of the sling and grabbed John's hips.
John smiled sadly at him. It must be something bad if Sherlock didn't believe John could help him. "We'll see," he said, and kissed Sherlock again. This time the detective returned the pressure. Kiss after kiss followed the first one, Sherlock's hunger and desperation growing with each. He was clearly in need of comforting and this, this physical connection, was the only thing he would allow himself.
To everyone's relief- mostly Sherlock's- he was released the next day after a number of strict rules, all of which he only intended to follow if John agreed. As soon as he woke up he called a nurse in and after a final check he was deemed ready to go home. He text John as soon as he could, telling him to meet him at the hospital at once. It wasn't even half an hour later when John showed up at the door.
“You think maybe your neck hurts because you’ve been sleeping on this damn sofa for the past three nights?” John berated him, though at the same time he started rubbing Sherlock’s neck, hoping to soothe some of the pain and get Sherlock functioning again. He was rewarded with a deep sigh and a satisfied groan from the detective.
When he came back into the living room again Sherlock was in the exact same position. He walked up behind him and slipped his arms around Sherlock's waist at which point Sherlock jumped up slightly, clearly startled.
Sherlock’s eyes were glazed over and unfocussed, but John’s voice seemed to trigger some recognition in his gaze. “He’s GCS 5, his eyes are open,” he quickly rattled off. He was still holding Sherlock’s hand, trying to ignore the fact that it was lax in his own. “I’m right here, Sherlock,” he whispered, “I’m right here.”
Lestrade hesitated slightly, unsure of whether or not it was a good idea to continue his line of questioning over the phone.
"This isn't funny, Sherlock! I warned you about this. I bet you didn't even take your medication. You're probably in a lot more pain right now then you're giving away."
“Yes, I was an army doctor,” he explained, as he squeezed Sherlock’s free hand tightly. “You have to breathe, Sherlock. I know it’s boring, but you have to.”
They had spent hours in bed, only falling asleep as the Sun came up and dim light was streaming in through the window. They were both naked atop the sheets, having succumbed to sleep, tired from the case and their late night activities, before either had a chance to slip under the covers. Sherlock had wrapped his arms around John's waist and laid his head on his lap and John had drifted off running his hands through his hair. It was that same way now that he woke up.
Sherlock tried to look away from John but he held his ground, softly nudging Sherlock's chin up again. "Please look at me," he pleaded.
Sherlock scowled at the detective inspector before crouching down to inspect the body, ignoring Lestrade.
Sherlock woke up the next morning to John rubbing soothing circles on his back. His head was still on John's lap, John sitting up slightly in bed, and he wondered if the doctor had managed to sleep comfortably in that position. The truth was John hadn't slept at all. He'd been too worried about Sherlock, between the nightmares and the drugs, and had decided to keep vigil all night to make sure he was okay.
He looked up to find John staring at him with an intent look on his face again. When he saw the detective looking back his face split in a wide smile of pure happiness. "You're back," he said.
"Oh, nothing," John tried to dismiss, but Sherlock gave him a look that clearly said that he knew it wasn't true. "I think I pulled a muscle in my back."
John shook his head, clearing his thoughts. "Yeah, I'm fine, Just hmm, drinking my tea," he said, laughing nervously and then taking a sip from his now cold beverage.
“Of course I did, it’s our anniversary! Just take it, it doesn’t bite. And no deducing, just open the damn thing.”
Currently sprawled across his bed, hidden almost entirely by the blankets he had draped over himself, was Sherlock Holmes.
Their kisses were messy, frantic, desperate, as were their movements. Sherlock almost lost his hold on John twice, his hand slippery, distracted by the overwhelming pleasure he was feeling of being so close to John.
Mycroft noticed a lot of changes in Sherlock after John came along, and especially after Sherlock came back. He was still the same old Sherlock, but he seemed more aware of the people around them. Of their feelings, of their lives, of what affected them, and even though he had always been aware of this now he seemed to tread more carefully around them. He measured his words more carefully, he kept some of his more extreme deductions to himself, all just to please John. And it pleased Mycroft too, to see his brother being so human.
At that Sherlock had the sense to look slightly ashamed. It was never a good time to pass out, but his timing in this particular instance had been rather unfortunate.
After a couple of hours John felt himself nodding off. It was 3am and he was glad it was Saturday so that he could have a lay in the next day. He was thinking of reducing his hours at the clinic. Sherlock was back to work now and he needed him and John hated the idea of being at the clinic while Sherlock was away working on exciting cases, although he still needed something outside of Sherlock's work for himself. He hadn't gotten the job at the clinic just because he needed the money; he enjoyed being a doctor and treating people, even if it was a bit mundane, it served to ground him to reality and everyday life.
John didn’t think he’d ever been quite so shocked by a question before. He felt like his brain was completely frozen, still trying to work through the words he had just heard- or thought he heard. Had Sherlock really just proposed? If he had he should probably answer soon or Sherlock would get the wrong idea, but he couldn’t get his mouth to work.
