“I remembered something that he’d said to me when we first met.” Natasha’s eyes were a million miles away. “Three in the morning in a back alley in Moscow, and one of the first things he said to me was ‘it’s okay for fear to be a part of your story, so long as it doesn’t hold the pen’.”
“Excuse me!” Tony protested. “I pay for all of this food, is it too much to ask to be able to eat some of it?”
Tony smiled gratefully at his back as he left, then closed his eyes and leaned back against Natasha.
Natasha shook her head. “They definitely aren't. I talked to Steve about it briefly, but he didn't seem in all that big of a hurry to tell Tony how he feels. And if he doesn’t, Tony definitely never will.”
Thor frowned, looking confused. “Are the Man of Iron and our valiant Captain not yet courting? Their behavior has led me to believe that they were already together, merely keeping it to themselves.”
Pepper laughed lightly, and Tony felt something in his chest tighten. No matter that he’d come to terms long ago with their inability to be anything but friends - he would always love her, and to say that he missed hearing that laugh every day would be a lie.
The second eyebrow swooped up to meet its partner, and Steve conceded defeat, letting his head fall forward onto his desk. He noticed vaguely that the room was spinning gently.
Natasha ducked a stray swipe, finding herself embattled between monsters on two fronts. “Any suggestions?”
“I haven’t, not entirely. I’ve learned to control the Hulk, for the most part. Learned how to forgive myself for the things that I’ve done. But that doesn’t mean that I’m always happy with my decisions. It doesn’t mean that I’m not afraid of what I could do.”
“Thor!” Tony called. “Remember that scene from the fourth Harry Potter movie between Harry and Voldemort?”
I'M SORRY I wish I could tell you that these two beautiful idiots are going to get their heads out of their asses soon but it will get worse before it gets better.
“Focus, Ironman,” Steve said, now in full on Captain America mode. “Thor, you’re air support. Make sure these things don’t get any farther downtown. Clint, go with Thor and pick off any stragglers from above.”
He waited patiently until Jarvis informed him that Steve had headed down to the lab, his customary sketchbook tucked under his arm. While Jarvis had never directly said anything to any of the team about getting Tony and Steve together, he’d done little things to help them along - letting them know when Steve and Tony were in the same room, warning them if one or the other was about to walk in on a planning session, so Clint assumed he was in favor of the arrangement.
She rubbed a hand over her forehead. “Clint likes to joke that he and I remember that mission differently. That’s because he spent most of it bleeding out and delirious with fever.”
The robot trilled sadly, dropping the toy that he’d built earlier into his hand. Steve squeezed the metal hard enough for it to creak ominously.
“I have been,” Tony responded automatically, conveniently forgetting the fifty-six hour long inventing binge he had indulged in just a few days ago. “I’m just thinking.”
Steve winced, disliking the thought of Tony being alone in the hospital, no one but Rhodes to worry over him or visit.
During the war, it had been easy to know what that symbol was supposed to be. He was a symbol of American freedom, of the compassion and righteousness that stood against the hatred and fear mongering of the Nazi party.
“Tony, that was yesterday,” Steve groaned disapprovingly. “Come on, let’s get the team together and get some pizza.”
Tony avoided a dive attack from the pterodactyl he was currently fighting. “I am going to take you up on that Capsicle, don’t think I’m going to forget.”
Where's ~Steve?~ I'm sure he's not off in a corner repressing his feelings or anything. Because that would be silly.
“Only the slimiest of the slime,” Clint moaned over the comms. “There should be serious retribution for this.”
Natasha shook her head, face somber. “I went underground for ten hours - I still had some contacts,, and was able to get some funds together to get myself out of the city. But I -” her voice trailed off, and it struck Steve that this was the first time he’d ever seen Natasha at a loss for words. He wondered briefly if he’d started hallucinating.
This is mostly a filler-fluff chapter working up to the good stuff. Some mentions of panic and PTSD, but mostly my favorite Steve hangs out in the lab and admires Tony trope. And pizza. I'm hungry.
Steve was across the room before Thor could so much as blink, crouching down next to their injured teammate, and Thor’s guilt at hurting his friend evaporated as he watched Steve cradle the inventor’s wrist gently. The sense of triumph disappeared as Steve muttered something about calling Bruce, and moved back across the room to call him up on the communications panel, leaving Thor to apologize to Tony and help him to his feet. Thor sighed, watching Tony stare at Steve as he babbled to Bruce, pain forgotten in favor of a crestfallen expression.
“Thank you, Ms. Lewis,” Steve said, brushing past her as politely as he could manage, and making his way to the tiny office he’d been given when he became a S.H.I.E.L.D agent. Since becoming an official Avenger and moving into the Tower, he’d rarely spent time there - much to the consternation of Agent Hill, who was forced to leave mission reports on his desk in that office, as Tony had forbidden Jarvis from accepting mail from S.H.I.E.L.D. As a result, he was massively behind on mission reports, which Fury insisted he fill out on paper. Now seemed as good a time as any to get caught up.
Steve shifted position a little so more of Tony was inside him as he rode, all of Tony, as a matter of fact. He bucked up beneath Steve, compelled by need to move, almost desperately needing to feel that sweet bliss he knew was coming closer and closer with every one of Steve’s movements.
One thing was certain. All this damn hair on his face was itchy and needed to be shaved. He was going to do it if it killed him. They’d put his ass in a wheelchair after the second time he went face first onto the floor. That was okay. He wheeled himself to the bathroom and looked in his cabinet for his razor. He wondered if it needed a new blade. He decided he didn’t fucking care. He had to get this itchy mess off of his face.
It turned out that he’d worried for nothing.  Tony Stark didn’t act any differently than he had before their rendezvous in the smithy. He drank too much and teased Rogers about being so upright and good just like he had before. And he sat on his porch and sang
“You’re probably right. I had a lot of time to think these last two years and I’m so sorry. I didn’t know what to do so I panicked.”
“I have a bed in the back in my apartment,” Tony said, wiggling underneath him. “Want to move there? You’re mashing me flat.”
There was quite a bit of tugging and pulling and soon, they were both down to underwear, Steve in his boxer briefs and Tony in Iron Man boxers and a black wifebeater.
“What’s special about mine?” Tony asked, wondering if they were going to sit here in the dark all night long.
Tony let himself into his apartment at the Tower in New York. He couldn’t bear to stay at the Avengers compound since Siberia. He missed Steve so much that it physically hurt sometimes to think about him. The compound had reminders of Steve everywhere, of all they’d all lost.
Sheriff Rogers really liked Anthony Stark. He was brilliant, funny and the nicest person in Timely – when he was sober.  Which was not that often. To be completely honest, the sheriff liked him drunk almost as much as sober. He was still funny, sarcastic and sang
“Not exactly.” Tony took a bite of his food and would have sighed at how tasty it was had he not been as upset as he still was.
“You’re not! Oh,” Tony said and shut his mouth. This was going differently than Steve had thought it would. “Now I know what you were doing when I asked.”
Steve kissed his face, his neck and started to remove Tony’s shirt. Tony stopped him from pulling the shirt up.
He ran the sink full of water and found his shaving cream. He lathered his face and picked up his razor. His hand shook so bad that he was sure he’d cut his own throat. But he didn’t care. He brought the razor to his cheek.
Steve held his head still as he slowly thrust into Tony’s mouth. His rhythm quickened but Tony kept up, breathing when Steve pulled back and taking him deep as he pressed in. Tony was surprised when Steve pulled out and put his hand over Tony’s hand, moving his hand quickly until he cried out and came into Tony’s open mouth, a few drops spilling out and running down his chin.
He’d looked into Stark, writing to contacts back east, who told him that Stark had been a major weapons supplier in the Civil War until some of his guns had been used in a massacre of Southern troops. Stark had shut down his company and cancelled all his government contracts. Some said he’d lost his mind.
They both went in the door at the same time, which made for some shuffling to get inside and once inside, Tony handed Steve the bottle he still held onto and the sheriff took another drink from it. He set the bottle on Tony’s workbench and grabbed Tony, pulling him close.
“That’s a new one for Clint. He’ll probably love that one.” Tony was famous for his silly nicknames for everyone. Steve was Capsicle or Old Man most of the time.
These days, he would take Stark into the workshop and leave him on the big sofa by the wall, all covered in a homemade afghan to ward off the night’s chill. Sometimes he sat in the rocker by the sofa and watched Stark sleep, listening to him mumble and snore, soothing him when he cried out in his sleep.
“I’ve got towels,” was all Stark said as he threw several silver coins onto the bar and headed toward the double doors.
Tony waved his hand. “No bother. You served this country. You were not dead so they owe you. Pepper is good at what she does and if anyone can get you that backpay, she can do it.”
“I know and yes, I do. Can we argue later? We’ve got about an hour or two before one of them calls us,” Tony said as they began to make their way to the bedroom.
Steve kissed the device and then kissed Tony. Tony thought his knees might buckle when Steve looked up at him, his eyes dark with need. Steve was the only one who’d ever made his knees weak. The only one.
Steven and Tony delivered the mail, talked with the residents and listened to their concerns. Tony was even pressed into service to hold one of the newest residents for a few moments while his mama read her mail.
Steve licked him and tasted the precome welling on his head, wanting to moan out loud himself when Tony ran one hand through his hair, ruffling it softly.
He turned and left the room and Steve’s quarters before Steve could say anything. Steve slumped. What Tony had done to him was the most incredible thing he’d ever felt, but it wasn’t all he wanted. He’d known that along. That had been why he hadn’t tried to start anything before. Now he was just another blow job to Tony.
He started doing some searches all on his own on his tablet and found a porn site with lots of bisexual and gay videos. As he watched, he let his hand wander down just like Tony’s did in the fanfiction story. It had been a long time since anyone did any of those things to him.
They lay quietly after it was done, Steven staring at the ceiling and Tony lying on his side, staring at Steven.
Tony was already heading to the sink to wash his hands and change shirts. In a few minutes, the two men were getting off the elevator on the ground floor and heading across the street.
“They like you a lot,” Tony said. “A couple of the young women were looking at you like you were a brand-new bolt of calico.”
All that information certainly hinted at why he drank so much, Rogers supposed. But why did he settle in a place like this one? Timely was not a very nice town. It was in a county and a state run by crooked and greedy men, who treated it as their own personal fiefdoms. Roxxon was as bad as they came, and Steven was sure he was responsible for Bucky’s death though he didn’t have enough proof to take it to a judge.
He moved his finger in and out, still licking and sucking at Tony’s balls. He slid a second finger in, crooking the first to find Tony’s prostate, tickling it ever so slightly.
Steve nodded and they went to Tony’s penthouse. Tony made them both a cup of coffee in a maker of his own design.  He loved the stuff though he was pretty sure Steve might not be able to tell it from Mr. Coffee brew. Oh well, no matter.
Tony pulled back from the kiss and looked into Steve’s eyes. “I’ve been waiting forever for you to do this.”
His heart was pounding in rage and hurt when he got down to the street. He marched up the street to the food truck, ordered a couple of tacos. He walked down the block and found a vacant bench. He sat down to eat.
Tony thought he couldn’t be surprised by anything until Steve whispered into his ear, “I want you to fuck me.”
Steve’s hands were steady and his touch gentle as he shaved Tony’s sideburns and around the little patch on his chin. He finished under his chin and then wiped the extra shaving cream away. Tony washed his face and Steve handed him a towel.
One evening when they got back from riding out to the ranches, Steve invited Tony to have dinner with him in his little apartment over the jail. He got dinner from Mrs. Hill, who ran a rooming house and often made dinner for him and his prisoners.
Tony turned his attention to Steve, dragging his eyes from the men on the screen. “Oh? You and Barnes?”
He was going to shower and go to bed, but the couch was right there and he was so tired, so he lay down.
“God yes. Don’t stop. Oh fuck!” Steve said, whispering the words. Tony knew the dreams he was having when he’s said those things. They were dreams of him and Steve.
Much to his own surprise, he grabbed the chair from the vanity and placed it beside Tony’s bed. He sat down. “I don’t think I remember any proper fairy tales, Stark.”
“Shit, I’ve missed this,” Tony murmured, running his hand through Steve’s dark hair. He stopped talking in actual words when Steve slid his mouth down, taking Tony in.
A little while later, Tony lay on his side, trailing his fingers down Steve’s torso. Steve watched and reached for Tony’s hand, bringing it to his mouth for a kiss.
An hour later, the two men were riding out of Timely to check on the settlers. The sheriff had picked up their mail from the Post Office, as it only came general delivery and the settlers had to come into town for it.  Steven filled two canteens with water as well, handing one to Stark after they’d mounted their horse.
“You can’t stay. As much as I want you here, you can’t be seen here,” Tony whispered. “We still – you hurt me. Not sure that can ever be fixed.”
After dinner, he was in his workshop when Steve came barreling through the doors. “Are you trying to embarrass me to death?” he asked Tony.
“No. Don’t do that. I came by for a snack. Even I can’t live on coffee and jizz.” He regretted the words as soon as they came out of his mouth.
Any fantasy he’d had about Steve was not as good as this was. He tangled his hands in Steve’s hair as they kissed, then snaked one hand down between them to take Steve into his hand. As Steve moved atop him, he fucked Tony’s hand.
Steve turned him around slowly. “I’m not Pepper. Your Arc Reactor and the scars mean you survived, that you’re still here.”
“Not sure any of that matters anymore,” Tony told him, still holding his hand, still looking at him.
One night after a particularly brutal mission back in Afghanistan to remove some Chitauri tech from the Taliban, they both went back to Tony’s place. Steve stripped out of his suit as soon as they were in the door. Tony started to take off his underclothes and he stopped.
As soon as Stark drifted off to sleep, the sheriff got dressed and hurried back to his little apartment over the jail. He washed the stickiness and the smell off and dropped into his bed. When he closed his eyes, he saw Tony’s face and heard the sounds Tony had made. It was a long time before he slept.
Tony went to his penthouse suite. He was exhausted though he tried hard not to let the others see how tired he was. It had been a long day and a long mission. He hurt all over from being blasted in the suit several times. His bruises had bruises today.
He did send one more link – the two men without the woman. He didn’t hear back from Steve.  Not then anyway.
Steve made a rude noise and sank back against Tony. “Maybe we should go inside,” he murmured against Tony’s ear.
Tony Stark had coffee in his veins. It was that simple. No one could stay awake as much as he did and not drink copious amounts of coffee. They all knew it –
Steve grabbed the lube and flipped the top, pouring some on his hand and reaching behind himself as he knelt beside the sofa. Tony watched in the near darkness as Steve fingered his own ass. Tony wasn’t sure he’d ever seen anything so damned hot, even if he couldn’t see any details.
Tony took him into his mouth and wrapped his hand around the part that didn’t fit in, moving both hand and mouth in tandem. Steve was holding tight to the headboard and appeared to be trying hard not to move yet. Tony saw that he was biting his lower lip like he did when he was nervous or stressed.
He did. Steve loved being fucked, any and every way they’d ever tried it, but Tony’s favorite positions had always been the ones where he could see Steve’s face. Watching Steve come undone was as near to heaven as he needed to be.
Steve closed his eyes when he was done and lay down beside Tony. He didn’t say anything, just pulled Tony close and held him.
Tony moaned out loud when Steve’s hand slid up inside the leg of his boxers and fondled his cock, moving his hand up and down the length until Tony found himself fucking Steve’s hand.
Steve nodded and moved up to straddle Tony, reaching behind to take Tony into his hand. He positioned himself over him and guided Tony’s cock into his ass, moaning a little as he slid down the pole, as it were.
“Yep. He’s behind most of the evil out this way. I’m just not sure what to do about it, but uphold the law as best I can.”
Tony nodded. He already knew that Steve was going to be the only one he wanted in his bed for a long while. He only hoped that Steve felt the same way.
He moved back into Avengers Tower after his home in California had been destroyed by Aldrich Killian. Rogers had moved back, too, after S.H.I.E.L.D. imploded under the news that it had been infiltrated by HYDRA from its beginning.
He dipped his head and caught Tony’s mouth in a soft kiss, a simple touching of their lips together. Tony tasted like whiskey and coffee, not unpleasant at all. Steve pulled him closer, pressing his body flush with Tony’s.
“Need any help with that?” His eyes flew open to see Tony Stark standing in the doorway of his bedroom.
Steven thought Stark looked better than he did. He nodded and the bartender poured him a cup of the strong brew. He sipped from the steaming cup and looked at Stark. His eyes were red and his hair was sticking up here and there as if he’d not bothered to comb it. Steven’s hand itched to smooth it.
God in heaven, he was more beautiful than he’d been before. While he had always looked like the All-American man, now his hair was long and shaggy – and dark, it was darker than Tony remembered it being - and he had a beard. He was dressed in black from head to toe. Tony had never found him hotter.
Even with preparation, it had been a while for Tony and he groaned a little when Steve pressed into him, but a little patience on both their parts eased the way and soon, they were both lost in pleasure, moving together as they kissed and whispered sweet obscenities to one another.
On Monday morning of the next week, Steve asked him if he needed another shave. Tony knew he could do it himself now. He was out of the chair and didn’t shake so much, so he was as surprised as Steve was when he nodded. “I’d like that.”
“Come on, Stark. Let’s get your sorry ass home.” He put an arm around Stark’s waist and walked him down the street. He opened the door and hauled him inside. He headed for the sofa.
Steve’s own cock felt hard enough to burst. He used one hand to loosen his trousers and free himself to his own touch. He was surprised when Tony reached down and grabbed him by the shoulders, urging him to stand up. He stood and let Tony undress him, gasping aloud when Tony caressed his cock.
Steve stopped dressing, clad only in his black boxer briefs and moved toward Tony and bed. Tony had no idea that he could be ready again so quickly or so many times, but they made love over and over, until they both slept, exhausted.
Tony closed his eyes to keep those damned tears from coming back. “I loved you from the day we met. That hasn’t changed and never will.”
“You feel like the answer is no,” Tony told him, running his hand all the way down to Steve’s newly erect cock.
Steve had just poured his second cup of coffee when Tony dragged his ass into the kitchen. His hair was a mess and his eyes were red. His shirt was unbuttoned with half the tail tucked into his trousers. He smelled like liquor and sex – Steve could smell him across the table.
He palmed the already slick head of his cock to wet his hand, then slowly, oh so slowly, slid his hand down his length all the way, using his forefinger and thumb to make a tight ring around the base. He used his other hand to stroke as he closed his eyes and thought about Tony and how he looked.
Tony knew what he wanted, but he wasn’t sure how fast Steve wanted to move. He decided that it must be pretty fast when Steve pulled him onto his lap with Tony’s legs on either side of him. He felt Steve hard beneath him and knew how damn hard he was himself.
Steve grinned at him. “You sneaky shit!” He sat up on the edge of the bed for a few moments then went to the bathroom. Tony went when he got back.
“You’re the sweetest sin I’ve ever tasted,” Steve said as he took Tony into his mouth once again. He didn’t let up even when Tony arched his hips up off of the bed, grabbing Steve’s head in both his hands and fucking Steve’s mouth.
“If I’m going to hell, this is the way I want to go,” Tony told him as Steve rubbed his cheek over the springy, dark hair around Tony’s cock.
Steve pushed him onto the bed and lay beside him, pulling him close for another kiss. “We shouldn’t do this,” Steve murmured against the skin of Tony’s chest as he kissed his way down again to taste Tony once more.
Anthony Stark was a brilliant man and Steven liked him when he was sober. He liked him when he was drunk, too, but he wasn’t willing to think about that. He was the town drunk and Steven had no business getting mixed up with the likes of Stark. His mouth was going to get him killed someday, and Rogers didn’t intend to be killed along with him.
“What?” he asked, trying to keep his voice even. When he’d let himself think about Steve, he hadn’t really thought this far ahead but assumed that Steve would be the one doing the fucking. Not that this was a problem!  Not at all.
“Just hopeful,” Steve answered as he pulled Tony close for another standing kiss, this time, their bodies pressed close together.
He slept fitfully in his little bed up over the jail. He dreamed of those deep blue eyes and those rough blacksmith’s hands touching him. He tossed and turned all night.
Tony went to the bedroom, stripped and got in the shower. He washed himself all but his back and called for Steve to join him. Steve stepped into the shower and scrubbed the grime and dirt from Tony’s back. He leaned close and kissed Tony’s neck and then his shoulder.
Even the best plastic surgeons and all his money couldn’t remove all the scars. The thick ugly ones from the crude surgery in the cave were gone and the new ones were barely discernible, but they were there, pink still and a reminder of his fear and his panic at the things that had happened to him.
“What’s up, Cap?” Tony asked when he was paying. The others had gone on ahead and Steve had offered Tony a ride back to the Tower on his bike.
As he filled out reports that went nowhere and read a new book he’d gotten from back east, his mind kept wandering to the night before. He’d not been with anyone since the war, and he suspected Stark hadn’t been with anyone in a while either. They both surely had become desperate awfully quickly.
“I was born in New York. My mother’s name was Sarah and she was as Irish as they come.  My father died of a fever before I was born so Ma raised me by herself. She worked as a maid to one of those fancy families with a big house. I left home when I was seventeen to fight in the Civil War. My pal, Bucky, joined up, too. After the war, we drifted out here and I became sheriff and he was my deputy.”
He poured his second shot and looked at Stark sitting at the bar. He’d long since abandoned drinking from a glass. He took long pulls from the bottle instead. The sheriff found himself staring at that mouth as Tony wiped it with the back of his hand. He wondered if Stark kissed as good as he looked like he could.
Steve knew he had to be the color of a beet by now, but he nodded. Tony looked back at the screen but put his hand on top of Steve’s thigh, a simple light touch, but both of them knew it meant a lot more than that.
“I am, surprisingly so.” His eyes wandered down that torso and those long legs. If only he didn’t remember how those legs felt wrapped around him, how eager Steve had always been to please Tony, to do whatever Tony asked.
They met about an hour later and rode out of town. Steve liked the companionship of having Stark ride with him. There’d been no one since Bucky was killed.
Tony’s eyes widened a little at the sight of him up close. “You’re a big one, Cap,” he said, not taking his eyes off Steve’s cock as Steve absently ran his hand up and back down the shaft, sort of offering it to Tony.
One morning, several weeks after he came home, Steve was getting ready to shave him and Tony put his hand over Steve’s. “I am sorry I’ve been angry with you so long,” he said quietly, looking at Steve in the mirror in front of him.
Tony moved onto his back and looked up at Steve, his eyes dark with need, too. Steve lifted his legs up high enough for Steve to guide himself to Tony’s opening. He pressed his head in, moaning at how badly he wanted to just slam all the way in. He didn’t, sliding in slowly and gently instead. He wouldn’t hurt Tony for anything.
There was only one other door, so Steve rightly assumed that one was the bedroom. He opened it and hefted Tony into his arms and carried him into the room. The moonlight shone through the one window and Steve saw a big, wooden bedframe with what appeared to be a homemade quilt on top. There was a table beside the bed and a small vanity against the opposite wall with a chair pulled up to it.
Steve answered yes before he thought. He cleaned himself up a bit and went to see what Tony had in mind. At this point in time, he wasn’t sure if he was more frustrated at Tony’s porn links or at the idea that he wanted to do those things with Tony.
“I know what’s there. It’s all right,” Steve told him. “But it’s all right to keep your shirt on, too.”
Steve was happy that he kept Tony sober all day and when they got back to town, he offered to buy him dinner at the saloon.  Stark nodded in agreement and both men went to their homes to clean up a bit.
Several days later, they were in the bathroom again. Steve had just finished shaving Tony and he pulled the towel away. When Tony started to stand, he somehow tripped himself and Steve caught him in his arms, his strong, strong arms.
The shaving became a regular thing, for reasons that Tony couldn’t figure out. He was perfectly capable of shaving and had been doing so since before he had much to shave. Steve doing it for him was soothing and he could admit to himself (but no one else) how much he enjoyed spending those few quiet minutes with Steve every morning.
He pushed Tony back onto the sofa after the kiss and unfastened Tony’s trousers then pulled them off, along with his underwear. He leaned close as he’d done many times before and looked up at Tony before he took Tony into his hand and dipped his head and lapped at him.
“Steve!” he gasped as the pleasure uncoiled and took his breath away. “Oh god, Steve!” He jerked his hips as Steve kept going until Tony was spent and went still. Steve licked him gently, cleaning the last drops of semen that spilled out from his head then looking up into Tony’s eyes.
After they both caught their breath and came back from their orgasmic high, Tony looked down into Steve’s face again. He almost hoped that Steve wouldn’t still look so beautiful to him. He did.
Steve scooped out a little of the clear jelly and pressed one finger slowly into Tony as he let his tongue tease Tony’s perineum, then his testicles. Tony thrust his ass upward, trying to take more of Steve’s finger. Steve obliged him by pressing all the way inside. He was trembling with need himself as Tony made a sound.
Steve followed him to the bathroom and motioned for him to sit in front of the mirror as he gathered Tony’s supplies. Tony wet his face in the sink. A barber would steam his face but the water worked just as well. Steve put a towel around his neck and shook the shaving cream. He applied it gently to Tony’s face. Tony closed his eyes and let himself relax as Steve began to shave him. He could smell Steve and for some reason, the other man’s scent made him feel calm.
Tony ordered them both a double shot and they drank, Steve looking into Tony’s eyes. He wanted so badly to ask him if he could come home with him, if he could kiss him dizzy then get naked with him and love him until they were exhausted.
He stared hard at Stark for about ten seconds before he gripped his coffee cup so hard that it exploded in his hand, splattering coffee all over him and the table with bits of crockery. He let the remains of the cup fall, dried his hand on his napkin and headed out of the room like a bat out of hell.
The hand slid to the inside of this thigh. “Interested in finding out with me?” Tony was still watching the screen.
“What the fuck?” He grabbed a pillow and covered himself, more embarrassed that Tony would see his tablet than that he’d see his dick.
He made his way to the workshop. He looked at DUM-E. “Don’t you say a word,” he said to the little robot. He worked on some tweaks to the suit and fiddled with an upgrade to some of the Tower’s security protocols. About 4 pm, he realized he needed some food, so he made his way to the kitchen.
They kissed and Tony moved so Steve could get up and dress. He sat on the side of the bed as Steve retrieved his clothes from the other room. Steve brought Tony’s clothes as well.
There was more in the look than Steve knew how to process so he closed his own eyes and sighed, moving his hand from the back of Tony’s head to his cheek. He gently cupped Tony’s cheek. He wanted to kiss Tony and hold him for a moment. But he didn’t.
“Oh fuck!” Steve couldn’t hold back. He let go, let pleasure take him and take him, it did. “Tony!” The world stopped completely then exploded in his body, in his head.
“I don’t. I’m just more comfortable in a shirt. I get cold.” He slid his hand down between them and Steve forgot about his chest, for a while anyway.
“You are not experimenting on the mysterious goo creatures, Tony,” Natasha said, exasperated. He got the sense that Clint had suggested something similar just before he got there.
Creeping silently through the vents, Clint positioned himself above Steve’s bowed head, nocking the rubber heart-shaped arrow (courtesy of Bruce, who’d thrown himself with almost single-minded intensity into this challenge after he’d nearly burned Steve and Tony’s skin off). He aimed it at the back of Steve’s head, and fired.
Tony’s face lit up, and he began babbling on about some lightweight something or other that’s going to make the QuinJets more aerodynamic. Steve smiled and tuned most of it out, allowing his mind to be lulled by Tony’s chatter.
Steve, on the other hand, had been doing everything he could to get to Tony’s location since the moment he’d heard the A.I.M agent’s voice over the comms. It was barely three blocks away, but it felt like miles. He’d dodged snapping teeth, sharp horns, and trampling legs nearly thick around as Thor’s body, but it still didn’t feel fast enough.
Rhodey shook his head. “I’ll let him explain. Try to get some rest, okay? You’re going to need your strength for trying to break out of here against medical advice once you’re not so drugged.”
Howdy folks! Sorry I've been MIA, I've been holed up studying for a midterm that was scheduled for the last week of class (???? College logic????). All I want right now is a nap and some Jello. Unfortunately I am unlikely to get either anytime soon.
He called Pepper and begged off of work for the next week, citing a cold that he didn't actually have. Pepper, bless her heart, read between the lines and agreed to make his excuses. As soon as the materials he had ordered arrived and Jarvis had them sent up, he locked himself into the tower and proceeded to completely redesign the top ten floors of the building. The next week - which passed by in a haze of caffeine fueled productivity and contained more than one nap in the sand pit he'd built for Bruce's bonsai garden - he completely overhauled the place until it looked like an Avengers-worthy home (base).
“Who ever said Captain America would have a hard time adjusting to the twenty-first century?” Tony joked. Steve placed the toy on the ground and it zoomed off, Dum-E chasing after it.
Tony eyed the griddle. “Not a big fan of eggs, to be honest. But I’ll take some pancakes and bacon,” he added hastily, as Steve’s face started to fall.
“Mmmphhf,” Tony replied eloquently, hesitant to open his eyes to what he was sure would be the full, blinding force of the overhead lights in the workshop. Jarvis wasn’t exactly subtle about his disapproval of Tony’s binge drinking episodes, and did his best to punish his poor creator for them.
“What?!” Tony squeaked out as indignantly as he could. “This is nothing. Small potatoes. A minor ouchie, if you will. I’ll be good to go in like a week.”
Natasha managed the faintest of smiles. “I found out years later that it was something Coulson had said to him when he’d first been recruited. But in the moment, it worked. I went back for him.” She shook her head fondly. “The first words out of his mouth were ‘I hope you brought falafel’. He never doubted that I would come back - ten hours alone on a dirt floor, bleeding to death, and never once did his faith in me waver.”
There was a gentle clearing of a throat in the doorway, and Steve looked up to see Natasha leaning against the doorframe, arms crossed and expression neutral.
I am so overwhelmed by the support I've gotten so far!! Thank you all so much! As a present have another chapter!
It was on a night like this, when the nightmares wouldn't leave him even after he was awake, that he found himself standing in the middle of his workshop, at a bit of a loss. He didn't feel like working on his armor -quite frankly, he wasn't even sure if he could possibly upgrade it even more, though that was definitely a question to be revisited in the morning. Not for the first time, he wished that Pepper was still here, or that he had actually hired a night guard like Happy had begged him to. Anything to know that he wasn't the only living creature in this massive monolith of cool steel.
He didn't bother calling her, as Coulson had told him the story about the last time he called her in, and he didn't want Natasha to snap his arm for interrupting her during a mission. Texting, however, seemed like a safe enough form of contact.
There were a couple of moments of awkward silence, and Tony's heart was thudding in his ears so loudly that he almost missed the next sentence.
It was...nice, actually, getting to know Tony in his natural environment. Steve finally got to meet the man behind the figurehead. Tony Stark, the genius billionaire with a checkered past and the pressures of an international company on his shoulders was a plastic doll, a caricature placed in front of the public for the public's sake.
“It warms the cockles of my heart every time you want to use my tech to destroy bad guys, it really does,” Tony said, clasping one armored hand over his heart.
“What happened this time?” Rhodes asked, clearly sensing his discomfort and redirecting the conversation.
He glanced back over at Tony - the way that his hair, just a shade too long and in need of a trim, fell into his eyes. How when he was asleep, the lines of worry and sadness just melted away, leaving him looking years younger.
“Tony!” Steve shouted, running out from his hiding spot to lean over the other man. Tony blinked up in confusion at him, and almost blurted out a quip about being rescued by an angel. Luckily, his mind snapped back to awareness just in time, and he managed to keep quiet.
“The goo is some kind of bio-renewable polymer,” Bruce’s voice (still calm, thank goodness) came over the line. “You’re going to have to incinerate the creatures, not just melt them. As long as there are living cells, they’ll regenerate.”
Natasha fixed him with a glare (not that she meant it, but it was fun to watch him cower), and he shrank back. “Maybe we just don’t want your input, Stark.”
He hadn’t expected to like Steve. Even without the influence of Loki’s scepter, he had thought that Steve would be a representation of everything he despised - a time when men like his father could get away with cruelty under the guise of success. A less advanced, less understanding time. He’d expected Steve to be morally rigid, with no room for failures. No space for failures like him.
“Sometimes I feel like people will dismiss my feelings,” Steve admitted. “Because they don’t coincide with what they’ve come to expect of me as Captain America.”
Of all of the Avengers, Tony was the last one that Steve would have expected to be domestic. Clint and Natasha were comfortable with each other in a way that spoke to an intimacy far beyond that of a mere professional relationship, and slowly but surely began to include the others in their circle of domesticity. Bruce was used to a life on the run, but he settled into life in the Tower with the same fluid ease that he seemed to approach most things. Thor was naturally boisterous and friendly, and often sought out his teammates to spar, or explore some of New York’s “finest hot dog stands”.
Steve shook his head to shake away the memories, turning on the faucet and splashing his face and neck with water, scrubbing at his skin with paper towels until it was pink and clean.
Rhodey must have sensed where his thoughts were going, because he smiled gently. “I think that once you’re out of here, you and Steve are going to need to have a long talk.”
Tony squeezed his eyes shut, images of dinosaurs and mysterious devices and A.I.M agents coming to mind. “Ah.”
Tony shifted uncomfortably, suddenly feeling nerves pressing against his chest, right behind the reactor's casing. "Well, I know that you like your work in India and everything, but here you'd have access to all of the R&D you wanted, and I moved a couple of things around and put away all of the breakables, so -"
Tony thinks too much, Pepper is a sweetheart, and Thor has finally learned some pop culture references. All in a day's work for the Avengers.
Eight hours since Reed Richards had managed to reverse the polarity of whatever the fuck that object was, sending the dinosaurs rampaging through the city back to the right era.
Steve grunted an agreement, slamming his shield into a charging triceratops. “Has anyone figured out how to send these dinosaurs back to where they belong?”
Bruce sighed. "I know, I'm sorry. I was out in a couple of the rural villages and I lost cell service. I didn't even get the calls until I got back last night."
So, Natasha knew how to bide her time, and wait for results. However, if her idiotic teammates didn’t get their heads out of their asses and start dating sometime soon, someone was going to end up stabbed.
It took a couple more weeks for everyone to settle into routines as they adjusted to living together, but they soon worked out a couple of ground rules. No one could enter Clint or Natasha's rooms without knocking first, unless they wanted to risk an arrow or a knife between the eyes. Knocking on Bruce's door at any point was out of the question - the quiet scientist had quickly warmed up to his new roommates, and spent most of his time out in the common area, down in R&D, or training in the gym. When he did retreat to his room, it was usually to calm down and cool off, so interrupting him was strictly off-limits unless they wanted a slightly greener Bruce than normal.
Steve looked up at the damaged plaster. Cracks webbed out from the center of destruction, and he traced their paths as he got his breathing under control.
He stood abruptly, nearly knocking over the inventor in his haste. Tony looked at him in confusion, and he forced a smile. “Sorry, I have to go. Forgot I had training with Clint scheduled.”
Ah. Tony swallowed hard. While he’d never quite adjust to the feeling of his heart beating against an electromagnet always just one or two degrees colder than his body temperature, he’d come to terms with the fact that it was there, and that his life depended on it. Being a futurist, he also understood that there would come a day where the technology would ultimately fail, or would be damaged in the field to too great of an extent, or too far away from a replacement. He’d made his peace with the fact that the very thing keeping him alive would also cause his death.
Steve squeezed his eyes shut, a series of images crossing his exhausted mind - Tony in the lab, gesticulating wildly at Dum-E. At the kitchen counter, bleary-eyed and soft as he waited for his coffee to brew. Falling from a building, the arc reactor flickering into darkness.
The way that Tony’s entire face lit up with a rare smile whenever Steve made progress on some kind of new technology, or the way his back rippled with lean muscle every time he reached for a wrench or a screwdriver had absolutely nothing to do with it.
A few hours in, Thor and Bruce joined them, Bruce in a new set of clothes and both bearing gifts of coffee and donuts. Steve drank the coffee just for something to do with his hands, but ignored the food - his stomach felt leaden and heavy in the bottom of his abdomen.
Suddenly, the mixture bubbled up, foaming until it reached the rim of the beaker, where it exploded everywhere. Bruce hit the deck, prepared for the explosion, but Steve and Tony got completely soaked.
“Have I ever told you what really happened in Budapest?” Natasha interrupted suddenly, sliding into the chair across from his desk with preternatural grace.
Steve nodded, a sudden confidence welling up in his chest. He could do this. He was going to tell Tony that he was the love of his life.
However, as hard as he tried, his thoughts kept drifting back to the Tower, wondering what his teammates - dare he even say friends? Family? - were up to. It was about ten in the morning, which means Clint and Natasha were probably just coming back from whatever top-secret meetings they attended at SHIELD most days (“top secret” being a fairly loose term, as he’d long ago had Jarvis hack the security footage of those meetings, and they mostly consisted of Fury bitching about Congress or the World Security Council while Natasha made veiled death threats and Clint shot rubberbands at a very tense Maria Hill).
Rhodes glanced towards the heavens in a familiar plea to whatever higher beings may exist, probably asking for the strength to keep from murdering his best friend. “Tony,” he said again, gentler this time. “The arc reactor went out.”
It became a frequent occurrence after that for Steve to spend time down in the workshop. Most often, he’d bring his sketch pad and doodle whatever happened to catch his fancy while Tony tinkered and rambled on about his work. After Steve revealed his list of things to learn about the time he’d missed, Tony would select different albums from different decades to listen to, providing backstory about the bands or artists and the history of the era. A couple of times, Steve even managed to drag Tony away from his work to share lunch together, and they’d gossip about whatever fake story People! was running about the Avengers that week.
Tony landed hard on his back and started rolling, numerous warnings popping up on his screens as the suit tried to accommodate to the sudden force. He came to a screeching, painful stop, and gasped, trying to catch his breath.
Chortling, Steve went over to the bots’ charging station, tapping Dum-E, U and Butterfingers on their struts as he went. The bots all whirled to life with excited chirps, and he smiled as he greeted them all.
The hardest part of her plan was actually convincing the two of them to start drinking. Tony had significantly reduced his ingestion of the substance over the last six months, and Steve was generally too upstanding to consider getting drunk.That being said, Natasha was a master at the art of manipulation, and after a few shakes of a bottle of black market Russian vodka - the kind of stuff that could strip lead paint - she’d gotten the two of them drinking it down like it was water.
“I know,” he said, covering her hand with his. Their breakup had been a lot of things, but it had never been about them not loving each other. “I’m sorry.”
“Fury wanted an analysis right away,” she said gently. “I’m sure there will be plenty of questions that Richards will need your help to answer.”
“Oh you are on.” Tony vaulted over the back of the couch to grab a controller, and Steve chuckled, stacking half a dozen slices of pizza - white with broccoli and bacon, his favorite - and settled in to watch the battle unfold.
After the paramedics had rushed Tony to the nearest hospital, Natasha and Clint had helped him to his feet and led him to the waiting QuinJet, leaving Thor, a very muddled Bruce, and a severely pissed-off Maria Hill to deal with cleanup. They followed the ambulance to the hospital, landing on the roof and hustling to the emergency room as quickly as they could. There, Natasha bullied a nurse into giving them information on Tony’s condition, only to be told that he’d been rushed to an operating room nearly as soon as he’d been triaged.
Unfortunately, they didn’t start getting mushy and profess their love for each other, as she’d hoped. Tony got very hyper, talking so rapidly about quantum physics that she wasn’t even sure that he was breathing. Steve suddenly found everything and everyone hilarious. He’d been rolling around on the floor of the living room for the past half hour, laughing so hard that he was wheezing. She wasn’t even sure what he was laughing at anymore. Either way, there was no confession of feelings, and as patient as she was, she was ready to clobber their heads together.
There was a resigned laugh from the other end of the line. "Okay, fine, you got me. I forgot my charger and my phone died. Don't worry that inflated head of yours off about it. But seriously, what's up?"
Wait, what? Tony wasn’t so pessimistic that he couldn’t say that he and Steve hadn’t become incredibly close since Steve moved into the tower, but he couldn’t possibly imagine why it would upset Steve so much that he had been hurt. They’d spent more time than he cared to consider together in hospital waiting rooms while a teammate (usually Clint, much to Natasha’s continued dismay) battled worse injuries than this, and Steve was always a solid pillar of optimism and leadership.
Bruce was exhibiting a truly exemplary amount of calm, alternating between meditating quietly in a corner and staring at the fish floating gently through the aquarium at the far end of the waiting room. Thor was snoring, passed out in a chair next to Clintasha. The only sign of his stress was the way his hand clenched around Mjolnir.
“Well if we’re not going to fight them, and we’re not going to see if they taste as much like Jell-O as they look like Jell-O, then why exactly am I here?” Tony asked.
“Where is everyone?” he finally asked, concern for his team’s wellbeing foremost on his mind after his conversation with Rhodey the night before.
Unfortunately, the reinforcements are about as helpful as a bag of bricks. Which she would cheerfully murder them all with.
Tony raised his hands to fire repulsors at the man, focused solely on the threat in front of him. So focused, in fact, that he didn’t see the second A.I.M. agent behind him. So focused, he didn’t feel the blast until it hit him squarely in the back, pain burning and flaring, sending him tumbling over the edge of the roof.
“Someday you really will have to tell us about that,” Bruce commented. Natasha shook her head, willing to admit defeat.
My apologies for the delay in posting - first I was caught up studying, then I broke my foot, and it's kind of been a struggle bus the last few weeks. So here's struggle bus chapter which is finally setting up the major plot arc for this part of the series!
Tony approached the device cautiously, examining it from all sides. It really was a lovely piece of technology, all curved black edges and a simple transmitter causing so much chaos. He wondered if Fury would let him have it after they were done, to examine the coding. He highly doubted it.
Bruce nodded in understanding. “You want to feel validated. I wanted that too. Tony taking me in, making me feel like less of a monster, that helped. But not everyone is going to react that way. If I wait around for every single person on Earth to accept me for who I am, I’d never find peace.”
“Uh, yeah,” Darcy said, pushing her glasses up her nose. “But isn’t Mr. Stark… I mean, shouldn’t you -”
The bot in question chirped in agreement, trundling over to his maker and latching onto Tony’s shirt, tugging him forward. Laughing, Tony followed his bot over to the workbench, where Steve was hunched over a tangle of wires and spare parts.
Rhodey glowered. “Unlikely. The company’s been seriously struggling since Hammer’s arrest. I doubt they’ve had time to come up with stuff like that.”
“So?” Tony asked, knowing this conversation was not going to end well, but feeling compelled to continue the argument anyways. He’d never been a particularly good Gemini. “It’s not like I’m not used to operating with diminished lung capacity.”
The man in front of him sneered. “I’ll have you know, Mr. Stark, that the protection of this device is of utmost importance. You have no idea what Scientist Supreme and our new partner are preparing for. You and your little friends are hardly a match for what is to come.”
Steve shifted, looking pained under the cowl. “Right now they’re not really doing anything. We evacuated civilians for the next couple of blocks, but all they’ve done so far is lick a couple of lightposts and turn over some garbage cans.”
Dum-E beeped inquisitively at his shoulder, and Steve smiled at the bot. “Hey bud. Steve’s not quite in the mood to play right now.”
Rhodey nodded in agreement. “I’ll look into some channels, see if I can figure out who AIM’s partner is. You’ll keep me updated on Tony’s condition?”
Each of the Avengers was withdrawn into their own world, processing the stress of the situation. Natasha and Clint had inched impossibly closer, and were now so intertwined that there was no way to tell where one spy ended and the other began. Their eyes, however, were glassy and vacant, both lost in memories.
“Clint got hit, badly. Shots to the shoulder and the thigh - just barely missed the femoral artery, that one,” Nat continued. “I should have stayed, but I didn’t. I ran, and I left him there by himself, bleeding out in the dirt.”
Steve frowned. Upon closer inspection, Tony looked utterly exhausted. The rings under his eyes could have been mistaken for bruises, and his eyes were completely bloodshot. Fine tremors ran through his fingers.
Steve snickered, though he couldn’t help but feel somewhat sympathetic for the poor inventor. Pepper Potts was indeed a force of her own - a worthy peer of Peggy, if ever he saw one.
“And Steve?” Tony asked, a forced casualness to his tone. The Wondertwins shared a smirk over his head anyways, and he told himself that the heat rising to his cheeks was the result of the pain steadily increasing throughout his body.
“We’ll allow one visitor at a time into the ICU to see him,” the nurse continued, and Natasha immediately shoved Steve forward. He stumbled, caught himself, and grinned sheepishly at the nurse. “If you don’t mind showing me the way, ma’am?”
Tony piled a plate high with food and grabbed his coffee mug. He walked past Clint, nudging the archer as he went. “There was a new episode of Project Runway last night, I had Jarvis record it.”
Steve sat down heavily, and took Tony’s cold hand in his, tracing over the silvery scars that years of working with his hands had left on the engineer. His eyes tracked the way Tony’s impossibly long eyelashes fluttered against his skin, thin lines of ink against the soft vellum of his cheek. Reaching out to swipe a thumb along his jaw, Steve noted that there were bags under his eyes again, and the stubble on his chin was at least three days old. He’d been spending too much time in the lab again.
Eventually though, Tony tired, and Thor saw his opportunity to strike. If he could pin Tony, not only would Steve be worried, but maybe he’d be jealous enough to make a move….
I'm sorry about that. It's been a couple years. A lot has happened. I graduated from college, started grad school. A lot of horrible things happened, and some really good things too, and I lost my way a bit.
“At S.H.I.E.L.D, filing his report with Hill,” Natasha said. “I’m sure he’ll be back as soon as he hears you’re awake, though.”
“Yeah, do you mind coming here for a second?” Bruce responded. “I need someone to hold this beaker steady while Tony and I add the reagents.”
But then last week someone left a comment saying that they read the fic and hoped that I would continue, and I just happened to see it because I checked my old email account, which I rarely do and I was really touched that someone would leave a comment after all this time. So I dusted off my draft, tried to remember where I was going with the plot other than finding a way to write about dinosaurs, and finished the chapter that I'd left hanging for a solid two years.
Aside from the initial and terrifying oh my God I’m in love, run from the idea of commitment reaction, this posed a unique set of dilemmas that he had yet to solve. Steve was his best friend, and he was inarguably Steve’s best friend, in this century at least. Tony was the person Steve came to when he had a question about technology, or culture, or one of Clint’s obscure (and usually inappropriate) references. Steve had been the only person, aside from Pepper, to see Tony in the throes of a panic attack, and talk him through the crying and screaming without judgement. Tony was the person Steve opened up to, who he talked to about the Howling Commandos, Bucky, and…. Peggy.
Bruce flashed a smile at him. “It’s okay. I know what you’re talking about. When I first became the Hulk, everyone thought I was a monster. And I believed it.”
Clint snorted behind him, and he followed the nurse down the hall, turning a couple of corners before the nurse stopped in front of a set of glass doors. “Right through there, Captain. Third to last bed on the left.”
Thor shook his head. “As worthy of an opponent as I am sure Happy is, it would do you well to work with someone who has trained since birth to fight.”
He could accept fairly easily that he had romantic feelings for Tony. It wouldn’t be the first time he’d felt something for another man, after all, and he knew that now, same-sex relationships were accepted as a societal norm. But while he no longer feared legal persecution for his feelings, he feared another form of judgement just as much.
Steve grabbed his spare helmet and handed it to Tony. Both of them got on the bike and off they went, back to Avenger’s Tower. Steve insisted on walking Tony to his floor.
Steve rolled Stark over and pressed him into the sofa. Somehow between kisses and groping one another, they managed to leave their clothing scattered all around the sofa
She took a shuddering breath. “It didn’t get easier immediately after that. It took another six hours to get an extraction team in, and Clint nearly died several times during that wait. He didn’t recover fully for another two months, and it took even longer for me to really trust him, or S.H.I.E.L.D. It took years after that for me to trust him enough for us to get together.” She looked at him with keen eyes. “But what helped the most was knowing that he believed in my ability to take control of the narrative back from the fear that had been controlling me for so long. That he was willing to wait for however long it took me to get there”
The four of them were sitting despondently around the kitchen table, picking at a bowl of popcorn and half-heartedly tossing out new ideas.
Tony was incredibly grateful for the helmet in that moment, for shielding the blush that crept up his cheeks at the compliment. “Can do, Winghead. Now get back.”
For the first couple of minutes, everything went perfectly - the creatures were aggressive, but stupid, and tended to move in a pack, which made it easy to take a lot of them out at once. The goo was tough, but not impermeable. A little heat melted them straight away, and Clint pulled out some of his explosive arrows (courtesy of Tony, of course) to help Tony and Thor with the live ammo.
He hadn’t even realized Tony was listening to his complaint - at the time, he’d been several hours deep into an argument with Bruce over some obscure point of quantum physics. But clearly the genius had heard, and was trying to get the shield back for him.
“Goo goblins,” Clint answered into his earpiece, sounding way too cheerful for someone who shot evil creatures for a living. “Bruce is at SHIELD trying to figure out the composition and where they came from right now.”
“Aha,” Tony said. “I knew, somehow, that this was Fury’s fault. I hope he knows that I charge by the minute for consulting time.”
“Four different tactics. Four different failures.” She put her head in her hands. “This may actually be the one mission I can’t complete.”
His relationship with Pepper worked itself out with almost as much ease, and maybe even more grace. While neither of them wavered in their affection towards each other - which despite the snide remarks and disappointed sighs, had always been real and steady - Pepper realized in the aftermath of the battle that she could not be both the CEO of a Fortune 500 company and the worried girlfriend of a superhero at the same time. And as it always did with Pepper, her work won out. She and Tony parted ways amicably, only to be reunited two hours later (and only mildly awkwardly) in a board meeting.
Instead, he was graced with Pepper’s sleek red ponytail and misty blue eyes, which widened when she noticed he was awake.
Unfortunately for everyone else in the room, Steve and Tony had somehow ended up across the couch from each other. This meant that every few seconds, one of them would cast longing, furtive glances at the other, before heaving a quiet sigh and turning their attention back to the movie. It had gotten to the point where Natasha was able to time it, counting down the seconds until the next time Tony or Steve turned puppy dog eyes on the object of their desire.
Steve easily sliced his way through a crowd of goblins, hunkering down behind the side of a building.
“We at A.I.M. are not opposed to a little friendly collaboration, Mr. Stark,” came a new voice from behind him. Tony whirled around, dropping into a defensive position.
Steve sagged, exhausted. He knew, objectively, that what Bruce was saying made sense. But before he was the Hulk, he was just a scientist.
Natasha was just about ready to give up. Thor had sprained Tony’s wrist, Bruce had nearly given them acid burns, Clint had knocked out Captain America, and she’d nearly poisoned two of the six Avengers. Stubborn Asses: 4, Team Matchmaking: 0.
“Let’s do it, science bro,” Tony said. Carefully, they poured the chemicals into the beaker Steve was holding. If this worked….
When he next woke up, it was to a mouthful of curly red hair and a gentle pressure on his ankle. Natasha was curled up behind him on the bed, with Clint keeping watch from what appeared to be a brutally uncomfortable visitors chair. His eyes were trained carefully on the door, as if waiting for something or someone dangerous to burst through, but his gaze shifted to the bed as Tony shifted.
“Right,” Tony nodded swiftly. “The one thing I don’t understand is how the idiots at A.I.M. came up with this. It’s a little above their pay grade.”
“Yes!” Bruce popped up. “How about you guys? We should get you into the safety shower, shit, and you should probably get those shirts off…”
Steve shrugged helplessly. “Honestly, I’ve just been following Dum-E’s instructions. He’s been pointing and I’ve been putting things where he tells me to.”
“Okay but seriously,” Clint said, a faint twanging sound coming over his line. “Does anyone have any suggestions on how to keep these things corralled? Because these triceratops seem very intent on exploring brunch spots in Hell’s Kitchen.”
“I see the way you look at him,” she said. “It’s the same way I look at Clint sometimes, when he’s not being a birdbrain.”
Why did I write this chapter? Honestly, I don't know. I've been having a shitty week and needed to write some bumbling, adorable idiots. Also the other Avengers deserved a shoutout. So, here is 3K words of honestly I don't even know what.
“That was only relevant when you were a consultant, Tony,” Steve said. “Now that you’re a full-time Avenger, you get paid the same as the rest of us.”
“That is unclear at the moment, I’m afraid. Ms. Potts has a variety of unpleasant administrative tasks planned for Master Stark.”
She grinned, sharp and triumphant, and suddenly all was right with the world again. “You’re welcome. You’re going to go home and get some food and some sleep, and then you’re going to tell Tony that you love him.”
The standard-issue office chair protested loudly against his weight as he settled in, staring blankly at the stack of papers in front of him.
That being said, he knew that his team viewed the arc reactor as more of a miracle than a curse. Steve had commented more than once on how beautiful it was, how it was the greatest advancement that he’d seen in the 21st century. And Tony, remembering the aftermath of the battle of New York, had never corrected his thinking. He took a shaky breath.
His hand drifting down to his side, Tony was able to feel where the doctors had inserted the chest tube. Brushing his fingers over the foreign entity sparked pain up his sternum, and he sucked in a harsh breath.
“Just this once,” she said, stroking a soft hand over his forearm. “Steve told me what happened. I know it wasn’t your fault. I just - I can’t-”
Clint was an extraordinarily observant man. He had to be - there were times when his aids didn’t work, or he didn’t feel like wearing them (read, forgot to wear them), and his eyesight was the only way he could interact with the world around him.
There was an affirmative grunt from the demigod, who was currently trying to wrestle the second T-rex to the ground.
He shoved the two men towards the shower, helping them pull off their shirts in the process. Once they were under the stream, awkwardly facing each other with their shirts gone and their hair plastered to their heads, Bruce turned away, breathing a sigh of relief. Now, a few minutes together under the hot water, and soon….
Steve smiled softly to himself. He’d have to get Tony to rest once he was allowed to come home, or risk Pepper’s ire. He imagined days lounging on the couch, Tony wrapped tightly in blankets as he complained over whatever B-list sci-fi movie Bruce has picked out for them. The image thawed the last frozen recesses in his body, and he felt himself relax fully for the first time in twelve hours.
Thor, for a prince, was extremely low maintenance. All he needed was easy access to coffee and PopTarts, and he was happier than "a Bilgshinpe in a bog". He did, however, have an unnatural tendency to fall asleep on the couch in the middle of the day, which often resulted in a very frustrated Clint trying to eat lunch while ignoring the earth-shattering snores emanating from the other room.
Bruce came over and clapped a hand on his shoulder. “Look, if you ever need to talk, I’m here for you. But you have to decide for yourself whether your own happiness matters more than what other people think of you.”
Tony rubbed at his eyes. “Yeah, of course, I just…” he trailed off, patting Dum-E’s strut. “I built Dum-E in a drunken, angry haze when I was fifteen. He’s not exactly a functional machine, hardly useful at all and not really that exciting. I’m...most people don’t really interact with him.”
“I don’t -” Tony halted, and reconsidered his words. "I'm not planning on sleeping tonight. I've got work to do."
Natasha was surrounded by idiots. Completely incompetent, dangerous idiots. Even her birdbrain had outdone himself in idiocy this time.
“Colonel Rhodes, I’m so sorry,” Steve started, but the other man shook his head and held up a hand, stopping him in his tracks.
Steve sighed. “Have you ever felt like the way that people see you is different from the way you feel about yourself?”
"I do miss the camaraderie of our team, Friend Tony," he admitted over the phone (Tony made a mental note to figure out how, exactly, his phone got reception from Asgard), "and it would do me good to see Jane again. I have missed her much these past weeks."
Tony couldn't help the snort of laughter that bubbled up from his chest. It must have been a thing about writing texts (or full on letters, in Steve's case), because he knew for a fact that Cap didn't bother to talk like he was in the 40s during regular conversation. He shot off a quick reply, and allowed himself a moment of triumphant victory. That night, he slept soundly for the first time in months.
Thanks for reading folks! I can't promise that I'll be able to post super regularly because it turns out grad school is a LOT of work. But I can promise that it's not going to take two years to update this time. There is a point to all this, and it will be coming soon!
“You scared me, младенец-лев,” she said quietly, running her nails gently over his scalp, and Tony suddenly found himself intensely grateful that they’d had a second chance to let a friendship form. She never would have admitted any kind of emotion to him when she was working undercover as his PA, and he deeply valued the honesty with which they could now communicate.
“Cap, Natasha, Clint, round the goblins up as best you can,” Tony ordered. “Thor and I want to try something.”
Tony felt his face flush -it was pathetic, how this one man made him feel like a teenager again - and quickly sent off a reply.
Natasha can see that Tony and Steve are pining for each other. She can also see that solving this particular problem is going to be more than a one man job, so she calls in reinforcements.
“I would rather you stayed in one piece,” she said sternly, though her watery smile betrayed her. “There’s always another Americano to be found, but there’s only one Tony Stark.”
After the Battle of New York, the Avengers found themselves drifting apart - Thor had, of course, taken Loki back to Asgard to face judgement; Steve returned to Washington D.C. and his punching bags; Natasha and Clint vanished practically off the face of the earth, presumably to lick their wounds together, and Bruce returned to India to continue his work. Tony, however, found himself left behind with a smoldering tower, a very distraught soon-to-be ex-girlfriend, and more PTSD than he was really willing to admit.
Bruce Banner knew that he was smarter than almost anyone he had ever encountered, Tony excluded. He saw things other people didn't, threads in the world that he could examine, unravel, if only he didn't know what happened when the string snapped. And he could see how much Steve and Tony cared about each other, maybe even loved each other.
“Rhodes is at the Tower, getting some sleep,” Clint continued, unperturbed by the interruption. “Pepper is at S.I. putting out some PR fires that the footage of your fall started. Thor is patrolling the hospital perimeter in the event that the ‘foulsome cowards return’.”
This particular day was low key even compared to some of their more mellow moments - Tony had woken up late, lounged around in bed until well after noon, then took a luxurious shower and meandered out into the common lounge, looking for his friends.
I am so sorry for abandoning you all this summer. There were a number of professional and personal things that came up that I had to deal with, and then I was abroad sans computer, so I didn't have a lot of time for writing/posting.
He started off with Bruce, as he figured that the big guy would be the easiest of his teammates to persuade - and if he wasn't, then at least he'd be the gentlest in letting Tony down.
Dum-E issued a string of beeps that could be interpreted as a laugh, and Tony shot the bot a betrayed look. “Watch it there, buddy. I still have the power to ship you off to a community college somewhere in Kansas.”
Tony offered him a hand, hauling Steve to his feet. Steve pointedly did not notice the feel of Tony’s warm, calloused hand in his, or the flex of his bicep as he pulled the heavier man up.
He had stayed at the hospital through the night, exhaustion creeping in at the edge of his senses as the knowledge that Tony was going to be okay started to sink in. In the early hours of the morning, a nurse had come out and said that one of them could go back and sit with Tony for a few minutes. Steve had slowly staggered to his feet, but before he could so much as move in the direction of the hallway, Rhodes was halfway there, following the nurse. An aching emptiness slithered down his throat, and before he knew it, Steve was walking out of the hospital, ignoring the calls of his confused teammates. He kept walking without much awareness, bumping into early morning joggers and jaywalking more than a couple of times. When he came back to himself, he was standing in the lobby of S.H.I.E.L.D, with a very concerned Darcy Lewis - official Strategic Interventions intern and unofficial Thor wrangler - trying to get his attention.
They were watching a movie - Tangled, one of her favorites. Of course, she’d die before admitting that to the team, but Clint had suggested it, taking the ribbing from the others like a champ, sending her a covert smile. She had nodded back, making a mental note to thank him thoroughly later tonight.
“A wannabe bad guy,” Tony replied, specifically not mentioning the very large and very dangerous gun pointed right at him. “Probably sent to babysit this thing.”
Eight hours since he’d ripped the armor off of his lifeless friend, Natasha hovering anxiously at his side as Clint called in S.H.I.E.L.D medical. Eight hours since he’d watched the reactor flicker valiantly back to life, shocking the genius’s heart back into motion but not awakening him. Eight hours since Natasha had shoved him aside so the paramedics could get to Tony, and he watched helplessly as the man that he loved was taken away on a stretcher, medical professionals shouting words that might as well have been gibberish, for all he could understand them through the fog in his brain.
The hours stretched on interminably. Steve alternated between pacing back and forth between the door and the desk and sitting stock-still, the only movement his knee bouncing nervously.
“Speed that up J, we’re not going to be able to get all of these things down without major structural damage to Midtown,” Tony ordered.
Tony sucked in a shuddering breath, and plastered on a dazzling grin so plastic, Steve was surprised that one of those little “Made In China” labels didn’t pop up on his chin. “Howdy Cap. It’s a little late for a midnight snack.”
“We need you to find whoever is behind the attack,” Fury said. “Richards said that he can reverse the portal polarity if he can get the original frequency.”
Unfortunately for Clint, he’d forgotten just how strong he was, and even minimal effort from him packed enough force to knock out a super solider. Steve slumped forward, and the arrow went careening off, knocking into a lit Bunsen burner, which fell over onto a stack of papers, which immediately burst into flames.
Steve’s heart soared at knowing he had some small part in putting that smile on Tony’s face, then immediately swooped into his stomach, which retaliated with a wave of cold nausea.
“You are an angel, Pep, truly,” Tony grinned, already pulling up the 3D rendering and deleting Richards’ comments. “I don’t know what I’d do without you.”
Steve let out an irritated huff and swung at the bag hard enough to pull the hook out of the ceiling. The metal wrenched free with a thud and the crack of drywall, as a piece of plaster shattered onto the gym floor.
He felt awkward calling Cap - did the man even know how to answer a phone? - so he texted him, and hoped that a caring neighbor would help the poor guy answer.
Tony nodded. “Cap, I’ve got the source of the portal. Headed there now to shut them down and get the portal frequency for Richards.”
So yeah, Tony was pretty pleased with himself. And his idea to have the rest of the team move to Aveng - Stark Tower (damn-it, Clint!). And if this was the first time in his living memory that he felt like he had some kind of a family, well.
Natasha would probably coax Bruce out of the lab with promises of tea and a sandwich, and Clint would probably goad Thor into some kind of contest, be it in the boxing ring or on the Wii. Steve, long home from his morning marathon (and Tony really wished he could say that he was joking about that), would probably offer to make everyone lunch, and end up whipping up a three course meal complete with perfectly balanced protein-starch-vegetable ratios. Tony had yet to solve the mystery of how Steve Rogers, who’d grown up dirt poor in Brooklyn, then spent his time running around the European countryside, had somehow had time to learn to cook like a Michelin-star chef.  Every time he asked, Steve merely winked and said something about everyone needing their secrets.
It helped, in its own way, with his own baggage as well. Before the ice, it had always been him and Bucky looking after each other, and he’d missed having that companionship after he woke up. Tony’s mindless rambling and his scolding of his bots, the way he would sometimes look at Steve with concern, as if he could sense those moments where it felt as though the ice was going to crawl back up his spine and refreeze him all over again. In those moments, Tony would abandon whatever he was working on and encourage Dum-E and You to bring Steve increasingly disgusting smoothies from the kitchenette.
Tony and Clint went into the living room, setting up shop on the couch. Natasha trailed in after them, curling herself up into Clint’s side and stealing a piece of bacon from Tony’s plate. The genius hissed at  her, and she rolled her eyes.
“What’s the damage?” Tony asked, slowly becoming aware of a dull throbbing in his head and chest. He suspected, that were he not on a significant amount of very good painkillers, he’d be be in agony right now.
He let out a particularly vicious punch, catching the bag before it swung back into his face. If he had just been Steve Rogers, there wouldn’t be a problem. The only people he’d have to worry about coming out to were his friends, and he was fairly confident that they would be supportive of him. As Captain America, he’d have to come out to the whole country. People’s opinions of him would change. People would begin to actively hate him. Parents would point to him and tell their children that he was what happened when you sinned. Could he be selfish enough to tarnish the reputation of a universal symbol of hope? Was his duty to his country greater than that to himself?
Steve was sure that Tony would resist any open attempts to help him - pride was one of the many traits Howard seemed to have passed on to his son - so he did little things to help out. If Tony fell silent while working, Steve would start humming under his breath, to give him some background noise. If the bots were about to come up behind Tony with something, Steve would redirect their attention towards himself so they didn't startle him.
Tony rolled his eyes. “End of the world, yada yada, we’ve heard it all before. Do any of you idiots have any original monologues?”
This Tony built Bruce a meditation room and put together an art studio for Steve. He made sure that the gym was always in great shape and ordered replacements for all of the training equipment that Clint and Natasha managed to break without complaint (though there was some good-natured hassling that often resulted in Clint holding Tony in a headlock on the living room floor). This Tony had Jarvis monitor the number of PopTarts in the kitchen and warn Thor when their supplies were getting low. He suggested movies and television shows to catch Steve up on pop culture, and showed him how to work the toaster properly, and stayed up late in his workshop to create more aerodynamic arrows for Clint, easily-concealed poison darts for Natasha, and flexible, stretching pants for the Hulk.
It in no way matched up with everything Steve had ever been told or had seen of Tony Stark, and it drove him absolutely crazy trying to understand why this Tony - the kind, thoughtful Tony with dark circles under his eyes and a genuine smile - had never been seen in the public eye.
Her words, while intended to be comforting, held no promises. Steve knew what that was like, the kind of realism that led people to face the truth of a dire situation. She couldn’t promise that Tony would be okay. She knew that Tony might not be.
Tony grimaced as he rotated his head towards the voice demanding his attention, and was glad to see that it was Rhodey smiling over him.
As if on cue, Thor strolled into the kitchen, hair perfectly done and sporting an Adventure Time tshirt that Natasha was fairly certain Darcy had given to him.
Tony laughed, and Steve glanced up at the other man. His eyes were creased with smile lines - so different from the usual tension there - and one side of his nose was scrunched up adorably.
So yes, he had seen Steve and Tony eye fucking each other. Hell, at this point, a Martian could probably see it from Mars, without a telescope. And not only was Clint observant, but he was a man who loved a challenge. If he could get the infamous Black Widow to somehow fall in love with him, there was no way he couldn’t do this.
“Fuck off, BirdAss,” Tony rasped, his mouth unbearably dry. He accepted the cup of lukewarm water Natasha handed him gratefully, gulping it down too quickly and triggering a coughing fit that left his chest burning, air whistling through his damaged lungs.
It didn’t take a genius to figure out who the “he” Pepper was referring to was. It could only be Steve - Steve Rogers, the man out of time, who had so quickly captured his heart that Tony hadn’t realized he was in love with until it was too late for him to drink himself out of it.
She nodded. “In every way that counts, at least. I used to think love was for children, you know. A fantasy that we told them to help them fall asleep at night.”
There was silence from the man next to him, and Steve glanced up worriedly. To his surprise, he saw the inventor smiling fondly down at him and the bot, his eyes suspiciously misty.
