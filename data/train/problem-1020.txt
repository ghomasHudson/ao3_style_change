"But," she said eventually, laughing at my face. "If I were ever to accept such a proposal, I should only hear it from a man refreshed and solemn, with at least one night of careful consideration." She paused, looking at me with the oddest expression. "I would like you to be... sure. Indeed, it would put my mind at rest if you would, perhaps, consult your close friend Mr Holmes."
"What am I supposed to make of it?" he said, shrugging loosely. "It seems like you shall be engaged to be married before tomorrow afternoon. I cannot congratulate you, as I have explained, but I am sure you shall be quite happy all the same."
"I am glad," she said, surprising me, "As I have thought of little else. We seem to be in some confusion, you and I."
However, all was promptly forgotten as I told of the empty treasure-box, and we listened to Small's lurid tale of greed and betrayal. Then within the half-hour, Althelney Jones was leading him away, and I was left alone with Holmes.
"Goodness, man, don't you have any human sympathies? Or is it simply that such a domestic matter fails to capture your attention, even when it so intimately concerns a man who calls you a friend. I know how you despise the mundane, but it is hardly so to me!"
"I grant that am somewhat more mercurial than the average man," he agreed. "I cannot think how you endure it in a roommate."
"I fear that it may be the last investigation in which I shall have the chance of studying your methods," I said cryptically, intending, I'll admit, to agitate him.
By the time I reached Lower Camberwell, I still hadn't thought of any speech to give Mary. But as it turned out, I did not require one. The moment she saw my strained expression, she smiled sadly and caught me by the arm.
"Surely not," I said. Holmes looked amused at my amusement, and perhaps a little pleased that he had tickled me.
Holmes looked at me then, face severe as always but hope and passion bright in his eyes. I couldn’t resist the urge to pull him closer by the wrist.
"Perhaps they are not evil, but you cannot deny that affairs of the bedroom have brought down nations."
"Oh, Doctor," she said, "You have romance in your heart, but I fear it is nowhere else. I am seven-and-twenty years of age and I have not yet met such a man — if I wait much longer, I will end up an old maid."
It made perfect sense to me. His artistic, Bohemian nature — his apparent mistrust of women, so at odds with his deft and gentlemanly way with them. His quoting Goethe. His isolation, more protection than anything else. His disdain for emotion, and his inexpressive secrecy.
And so the poker was applied, the lock broken, and the lid thrown back — only to reveal the thing as empty.
And here she gave me a most intense look. I found myself getting even angrier, although I could not justify it.
"You must know better than I do," he said, "That it is a peculiarity of women that they rarely say what they mean. It is likely she is restraining herself, perhaps because she fears you have known each other for too short a time."
I may not have known a thing about my feelings, but I know a kiss, and this one seemed as natural as my first. His lips were nothing like hers, his chest too firm against my palm, but little of it mattered; indeed, I might have felt that thrill that only sin can bring, had not all such tawdry thoughts been eclipsed by the solid fact of kissing Sherlock Holmes.
Then I looked at him, wreathed by smoke, hawk-like features thrown into relief by the flickering of the light. He was staring, almost too intently, at an empty spot of air above the mantle, and his eyes glittered.
“No,” said Holmes calmly, “Don’t try to comfort me, you’ve nothing you can say. No, Watson, perhaps it is for the best — you deserve the things a woman can give you. And if you’ve the patience for me after that, I will count my blessings. God knows I’ve survived on less all these years. Oh, Watson, I scarcely deserve a friend as good as you.”
Holmes was a miracle, a man of such elusive genius, as unbelievable and untouchable as a God — yet here I was, granted the highest privileges of trust, allowed into the sanctum of his heart, because he desired me more than any of his principles and any of his fears. It was overwhelming, even as he slowed, stroking through my hair as though to apologise for his presumption, keeping his chest away as if to give me space to push him back. I did not — I could not — I did not want to.
"Not at all," said Holmes, tilting his head up, though his eyes would not quite reach my face. "These are my theories, based on the data you provided; only with more data can come more precision."
After hearing that Miss Morstan was in the drawing room, I hastened with all eagerness to see her, for I was quite excited – both by the chase and by the prospect of seeing the lightness of her face as she observed her great wealth.
How could he corrupt the single happiest thing in my existence? Those days when Sherlock Holmes was at his brightest, with his attentions solely for me — they had lost their innocence, and I felt the loss as keenly as a wound. No more his hand upon my shoulder, or the comforting warmth of him beside me in a hansom —
"Only five!" said Holmes, looking at me with teasing eyes. "You were in the army, man! Whatever is wrong with you?"
"I am sorry, Doctor, for my reaction — it is quite silly. You will think me wretchedly naive, but I had not expected such a declaration."
"No, no," I answered, and I fancy I smiled back just as brightly, "Not to me, but to my friend Sherlock Holmes. With all the will in the world, I could never have followed up a clue which has taxed even his analytical genius. As it was, we very nearly lost it at the last moment."
"Not at all," said Holmes, convulsing with silent mirth, "It is an apt demonstration of one of your most charming features. I do believe, with all my heart, that you loved them all."
"Whatever do you mean?" I asked, both mortified and confused. Had I misread her so grievously? Was my admiration unwanted, for all we held hands and laughed together like old friends?
Miss Morstan looked at me kindly, as though she didn't quite believe me, then frowned delicately at the floor.
I confess, however, that I have never been entirely comfortable with such fiction. Though I like to think I am not devoid of literary skills, I am first and foremost interested in presenting the miracles of truth, and it made me ill at ease to present such blatant lies next to the very real wonder of my friend's talent, so that the more suspicious man might not believe either. So I endeavoured to be as honest as possible, to confess my obligation to discretion as often as I could, and to provide accounts accurate in spirit, if not in detail.
I couldn't reply — my throat would not allow me speech. Holmes stayed frozen, looking tormented as I had never seen him. Then he sat up, and reached for me, and I was so shocked that he had grasped my hands in his before I could react.
"When I met you, Miss Morstan, my instincts told me you were a fine woman," said I. "And I believe they were entirely correct. A man could not ask for a better wife." I looked at her soft, sweet face, and touched a hand to it with delicacy.
"I heard a cab drive up," she said. "I thought that Mrs. Forrester had come back very early, but I never dreamed that it might be you. What news have you brought me?"
I could not help but think of my own knowledge of male love — aside from the childish affairs and bonds of boys at school. There had been, I recalled, two men within my regiment, of differing rank and age yet still the very best of friends. They fought together side-by-side, and would have died for each other as happily as for their country. Their indiscretions were an open secret, they escaped discipline by the merest inch, and yet in every other regard both men were upstanding, loyal and true to their regiment, and so genial that some of the more forgiving officers referred to them with affection as Her Majesty's Hoplites.
"No doubt your confusion surpasses mine," said she, amused. "But it has occurred to me that the road ahead is not so unfathomable after all."
"Absolutely," she agreed. "After all, no doubt you have been accustomed to providing for yourself alone, and have not the savings for a wedded life."
"Capture my attention?" said the man, leaping up and pacing toward the window. "Ha! You have my attention now, Watson. You have my attention for being the most singularly annoying person in the whole of London! Is this what you desire?"
For a brief moment, he was still, then before my hands could move to touch him he was sweeping past me into the lounge. He busied himself at his desk with his back to me, but as I strode forward I caught sight of the syringe in his hand and knew that he was covering up his recent usage of that wretched seven-per-cent solution.
She smiled at me again, and it seemed tinged with sadness still. Troubled by that hint of unhappiness, so inexplicably mirrored in my own heart, I glanced away. I caught sight of the lamplight beyond the curtains, and immediately recalled the time.
"Miss Morstan," I protested, attempting to stay calm. "I am utterly in sympathy with your heartbreak. But please, I beg you, do not doubt my affections — if you desired to be my wife, I should have the good sense to count myself a privileged man!"
He was laughing, but he could not fool me now: I saw the quiver of fear in his eyes. I smiled at him, at his elegant limbs spread casually over the bed, and waved a hand.
I looked at Holmes; he seemed quite calm. I could barely comprehend his perspective, his lack of emotion. If anyone had insinuated that Holmes was in love with me —
And here, I fear, is where the fiction begins. In my published tale, I am almost suave, confident in both my ability and my desire to secure Miss Morstan's affections. In reality, I was plunged into the most embarrassing attempt of romantic communication that I had experienced to date.
Holmes stood with a pointed elbow leant against the mantle, watching me keenly. I turned to the fire.
And more than that — the way he looked at me in the throes of some dramatic tale, as though he cared only to impress me. The hand at my arm or on my shoulder. The fact that he would never hand me a piece of paper or ask me to hand one to him, and instead read by my side, as though it were the most natural thing in the world —
And then he pounced, fire in his eyes that warmed me just as much, and play-wrestled me to the carpet. A few hours did indeed pass, and most pleasantly, until he sent a telegram to Mr Lestrade of Scotland Yard, and put to rest another ugly little case that I might write about yet, if Holmes consents to it.
"You've bitten a nail down to the quick, a habit most unlike you, and your expression when you entered the room was not one of romantic bliss. I can only assume that either you are unhappy about your arrangement — in which case I cannot help but wonder why you would make it — or that she turned you away."
“It is I who does not deserve what I have gained,” I murmured, close to his lips. Holmes visibly shivered.
"Another possibility is that our cohabiting, coupled with your inexplicable but now publicly apparent regard for me, has caused some little misunderstanding. It is not like the old days, my dear Watson, where men can be comfortable as intimate friends — now, it seems, even an imagined perversion causes a scandal."
"Oh, hush," said I, "You forget, I am a Doctor, and as such I am intimate with the dangers of sexual diseases. I never found the girls the other men went for to be worth the risk."
"Come, man, we will call for tea, and I will tell you the whole tale," I said. I led him by the hand downstairs, and was surprised upon the bottom step to be caught by searching fingers and kissed by trembling, desperate lips.
Holmes did not respond. I looked at him; he was staring at the fire with an expression of intense gloom.
"I am old enough to know that a good man with the ability to make an income is wretchedly hard to come by."
Holmes gave a twitching, reluctant smile, and leapt back into his chair in an agitation of limbs. His restless energy would have made me uneasy, had I not already been so.
Such it was always, with my Mary. I may not have loved her there and then, but it was not long after that I grew to. She was, as I have said, the best woman in London.
"Ha!" said I, knowing quite well that Holmes would be uninterested in something so domestic. And yet, now that Mary had spoken of him, suddenly I had no more desire than to be alone with him in Baker Street, telling him all about what had just transpired so that he might dazzle me with some deductive clarity. For I was all in a fog, myself, some strange, creeping feeling imposing itself upon my joy and blunting it like a sword against stone. I could see nothing which would give me such a knot of doubt in my breast; though I had blurted out what should have been given full solemnity, had it not been in my mind to secure Miss Morstan's affections? And had I not received every indication that she was interested in return? It was a most happy occasion, and yet some dark and haunting feeling plagued me.
"Oh dear," she said again, sitting down upon the trunk. After a moment of staring at the floor, she looked up at me and smiled.
He sank to the floor against my door, pressing his wrists to his temples with clenched fists, curled like a dying spider upon my rug. I leapt up and grasped him firmly by the shoulders.
"Come here," said I, all anger forgotten at the sight of Holmes's torment, and adjusted my position on the bed so that he might sit down beside me. He did so, slumping against my shoulder like an exhausted child.
"So," said Holmes after a moment. "You would have married any of them. Yet, I perceive, you have been a bachelor all your life. Pray tell me, whatever went so wrong?"
"Oh, Doctor, it is such a silly thing. It was simply that you reminded me so strongly of an old acquaintance of mine that I was convinced that you were quite identical to him."
"There are several possible theories," said Holmes, touching his fingers together. "The first one, the one you understood her to mean, is merely that her heartache has caused her to suspect all men. Who knows what it might have been — perhaps a mannerism shared between you and this Cardwell, something quite innocent but which her mind associates forevermore with deviancy."
If I stayed at his side, I would inevitably be tempted again. Even now, in the cold and unforgiving light of morning, my skin itched for his touch. It were as though some secret barrier had broken deep within me; now I had allowed myself to entertain the idea of Holmes and I in such a manner, I could barely think of anything else. I thought for one wild moment that it must be some perversion, more an illness of the mind than anything else, yet I imagined the face of my dear friend and could not bring myself to loathe it, not for a second.
"Holmes," I said instead. "Holmes, whatever it is, I am sorry for it. But please — tell me what you really think. Tell me what you think of Miss Morstan's story."
"Within five minutes of conversation James and I were firm friends. It seemed to come quite naturally. For six months we went walking together, took lunch in the University grounds and in all the parks of London, and we would talk for hours about every subject under the sun. He was a little Bohemian, a little poetic, but the perfect gentleman, and very handsome, and I fancied myself head over heels in love with him. And indeed, a proposal of marriage seemed quite likely; my friends all declared him to be quite as smitten with me as I was with him. And yet such a proposal never came.
“But you know, Watson,” he said, “You love her, or you are well on your way towards it, and marriage will only strengthen that. And you will live together, and you not see me as often as now, and you will have no reason not to indulge in all sorts of domestic pleasures together. She may take you away from me after all.”
"As it should be," said Holmes, giving me a wicked smile, which then began to flicker and fade like a gaslamp running out.
"Well indeed!" he agreed, snapping back in his seat and scrutinising me as though I were the bloodstain from which an entire case could be unravelled.
"Nonsense!" said I, quite angry — both at this man, and at the suggestion that I might in any way resemble him. "To take you out, to share his heart and hear your own, to spend time with you in such a way, he must have known — what fool wouldn't — he must have known and willfully ignored your feelings, for his own convenience! Miss Morstan, I am grieved for you. I can quite see why you might doubt all men."
Holmes had returned when I entered our apartments again, and was pacing about in a great agitation with a pipe of his most foul and intense tobacco in his hand. He looked up at me as I entered, and gave me a look of such intense irritation that I felt it like a blow. I sat down, surprised, and watched him rattle around our living room for a good five minutes before I could bring myself to speak.
It was nearing lunchtime when, without warning, my bedroom door swung open and a most pitiable sight hit me: that of Holmes, back bowed, eyes dull, hands twitching nervously at his side and an expression of deepest apologies upon his face, mingling with what I fancied might be a touch of fear.
I stared at her, quite surprised at the implications, and the innocent way in which she delivered them.
"And how would I know?" said Holmes, equally enraged although the slight was not against him. "Do you mean to say that sexual deviants know no discretion? I know a hundred cases that have never been discovered, people of highly respected character. Do you perhaps mean that I should be able to divine some madness within you? I have never met a deviant who has appeared more or less sane than anyone else. Do you mean to cite your high regard for women as evidence? I once investigated a man who buggered his page on Mondays, his wife on Wednesdays, the Governess on Fridays, and Lord Marshall any day in between!"
And with that his hand turned from butterfly to vice, firm and fierce in my hair as he leant up to kiss me.
"Aha!" said Holmes, scant minutes before his hour was up. "Yes, it was certainly the ink! Oh, excellent, Watson, I have him!"
"Simple things," said I. "Aside from my first sweet kisses with my childhood friend — after which her family moved to India — I have been with five women."
"Doubtless," he agreed, dryly, and said no more for quite some time. Slowly, I found myself relaxing against him, calm almost to the point of dozing.
All the world turned on its head, every moment of our acquaintance transformed into something unfamiliar and grotesque, and for a long moment, I hated Sherlock Holmes with all my heart.
Holmes was silent for a moment, before he scowled, brows collecting like storm-clouds above eyes that were stormier still.
"You," said Holmes despairingly. "Or perhaps me. I should have known it, Watson, didn't I say that it clouds one's judgement? You have shaken me up, and all my pieces lay upon the floor without a hope that I can order them again. How can I, when the very mechanisms of my talent make up the bulk of the mess?"
With her words, I felt a sense of ease. A long engagement... it seemed to be the comfort I needed, and indeed the only thing I could see for sure in a world as fogged as mine. And I knew that I had met in Miss Morstan a most remarkable woman, a woman I would be sorely sad to lose as a friend — which I surely would if we parted ways now. And part of me — a part of me that has been proved quite wrong since then — still thought that my single night with Holmes was some mere fad, for all it moved my soul. What would I feel if I found that, once my unholy passion abated, I was left alone forever, having lost as fine a woman as I could ever hope to find?
"Oh, Watson," groaned Holmes, his eyes closed, "Oh how I wish you would not write your thoughts so plainly upon your face."
What follows, though still as fallible as my human mind, is something more approaching the truth. I sometimes like to fancy that you would forgive me for it, dear public, were you ever to read this account. As this missive is destined for the fire, however, I find it unlikely that you will ever know of it. Oh, how I wish you could.
"He is not the only man of dual interests I have known," said Sherlock slowly, and I knew at that moment that he'd divined my reasons for asking, though I barely wished to own them myself. "There are clubs, Watson, doubtless you have heard of them, where men of similar tastes may gather, and within them I have seen every conceivable type of relationship a man might have with a woman, and quite a few unique to men. I have seen love and union stronger than the best marriages in England, and I have seen degeneracy and fornication of a most enthusiastic and disloyal kind. I have seen married men who love their wives succumbing to temptation, I have seen elaborate arrangements like the one I described, and I have once seen the most avowed Grecian fall head over heels for a woman and marry her at once. He, for one, looked at it quite spiritually; he pronounced himself satisfied with just a single soul to bond with, regardless of its corporeal shape, and believed that to be the God-given way of things. And they both agreed exactly which statues they would like in the garden."
"You know my methods," he said with a cruel twist to that expressive mouth. He turned his long, lean back to me.
"Well," said I, relaxing somewhat, "That is reasonable enough. I am sure I can reassure her on that count."
Lying beside him afterwards, with his sheets most irreparably tangled and a warm haze in the room from our exertions, mingling with the scent of tobacco from his cigarette, he looked at me with keen eyes and said:
"Indeed," said I, ruefully, and she slipped her hand in mine. I grasped it like a lifeline, an anchor point in all the wild confusion of the day. I stared out upon the calm blue sky with no words in me. She lay her head against my shoulder, squeezing my hand in an expression of comfort, and in those gentle gestures I felt acceptance and kindness, strength and warmth. In those few minutes, I felt a sense of calm that I feared that I could never feel with Holmes.
“I’m not wrong, you wanker,” John said, a little too fast and with a little too much heat in his voice.
A soft sound escapes John’s mouth and he pushes Sherlock back down onto the bed and follows him, pressing their lips together harshly because he is afraid that something else, something embarrassing, might claw its way past his throat if his mouth is left unguarded.
As John is sitting there staring at him, Sherlock surprises him yet again by blushing suddenly, a light pink dusting of colour on his cheeks and across the bridge of his nose.  He turns away from John and looks down at the cup in front of him and mumbles, “Actually, I seem to have spent an inordinate amount of time these past two weeks thinking about you.”
“Yeah.  I don’t—” he stops himself because he is about to say that he doesn’t want to cheat, but that’s exactly what he is doing.  Only he has to remind himself that he is doing it to Mary with Sherlock.  “I don’t have those feelings for her anymore.”  He wonders briefly if he should tell Mike about the other decisions he’s made concerning Mary and his marriage, but that conversation seems a little too deep for a Wednesday night when he only has two beers in him, so he decides to keep his mouth shut for now.
Instead, Sherlock is simply staring at him calmly, placidly, a deep red flush of pleasure staining his cheeks, and John must be losing his bloody mind but he thinks he sees the hint of a smirk curling the corner of Sherlock’s lips.  Those soft, warm lips that just a second ago were—
“Do you want me to?” John asks, still slightly confused.  He thought that most people who were into this sort of thing liked it specifically because it ended in sex all of the time.  He is surprised to find that Sherlock is interested in getting something else entirely out of this game.
John tilts his head down to look at Sherlock as best he can in their position, but the boy is staring determinedly away from him.  There is a soft, faint flush on his cheeks, as if he is embarrassed to have spoken that little confession out loud.
From across the line there is the sound of shuffling, then more silence.  And then, finally, he hears Sherlock’s voice, quiet like his own but so, so beautiful.
“Oh,” he said softly, “right.”  He quickly bent down, flipping his coat tails up so that he didn’t step on them as he crouched, and squatted next to John.  He dug in his coat pocket for his magnifying glass, only to let out a frustrated growl at not finding it where he usually kept it.
His hips stop immediately and his eyes go wide, his finger still in Sherlock’s arse.  He can’t believe he just said that.
He’d given it all up and hadn’t even thought twice about it.  And he hasn’t regretted a single thing.  He is exactly where he wants to be, in a small flat in the middle of London, with a landlady who has a bad habit of walking in at inopportune times to bring them tea and desserts, and a nosey almost-brother-in-law who he wants to punch in the face more often than not.
“I’m not the reason that you’ve strayed from your wife,” Sherlock tells him.  His voice is careful, calculated.  John doesn’t trust it for a second.  “I’m just the excuse.  Take responsibility for your actions, John.  It’s the least you can do.”
He begins yanking his clothes off, stuffing them to the bottom of the hamper so that Mary won’t see them when she takes the basket to do the laundry.  He turns the shower on as hot as it will go and steps under the spray.  The dried semen that smeared all over his groin and lower belly when he came inside of his pants is the first thing that he cleans away, hoping he will feel better once the sticky, crusty sensation of it is gone.
“There’s no way that could ever make a porcupine,” John huffed, his breathing irregular as he pulled out of Sherlock and fell back onto his side of the bed.
John thinks he looks endearing and completely adorable curled up in the man’s lap.  He smiles at Sherlock warmly and gives him a kiss.  “No, love,” he says, pulling away but not going far.  “That was just for you.  I’m fine.”
"If the only price to pay for such a husband is that I must share him with Mr Sherlock Holmes, I am more than prepared to accept it."
"Poorly?" she said, sounding surprised, though it made perfect sense to me — If a man had engaged in such flirtation as we had so far, and yet not declared any genuine interest or intention when the occasion called for it, then he must have been a crass man indeed.
"I know what you mean!" I said, rather harshly I suspect, though I was not shocked by his frankness: his cases are quite varied and often sordid, and I myself had been the one to set his mind at ease upon discussing them with me. As a man of three continents and several years of Army camp talk, there was very little Holmes could say that would truly shock me — though it was quite possible for him to make me go scarlet, and to beg him to quiet himself in case some onlooker might hear.
"I can tell you nothing," said I, rather breathlessly, "For I know nothing. You are the reasoner here."
"Very," said Mary, rising gracefully. With one final, chaste hand-clasp, I left her in the drawing room, and was headed towards Baker Street in the next moment. I'll confess it was not the most restful of journeys, for all that I had just achieved. Mary's tale had put me in an ill temper, in a manner I could not yet account for.
"I see," said I, wondering toward what point Miss Morstan was driving, and having an uncomfortable suspicion.
"Goodness!" I exclaimed. "I have left a poor Inspector outside in a cab! I will call on you in the morning, if that is agreeable to you?"
Holmes' eyes widened, searching me for the meaning behind my words, but his search was fruitless, for there was no meaning I could name beyond the simple truth of it. I was not thinking and I was making an effort not to feel either, save for that instinctive ache not to lose him, not to lose my intimate acquaintance with the most remarkable, impenetrable man I'd ever met.
"I have been unmarried thus far," said I, quite earnestly, "Only because I was in active service, and since then because I have been in convalescence. My acquaintance with Mr Holmes, I admit, has distracted me from courting since my recovery, but it is only him. If I had not met him —" and here I looked at her quite seriously, so that she might understand me fully, "I might well have fallen head over heels for many a woman by now."
"No, indeed," said Holmes, looking serious. "But Watson, I am a practical man. I should have been happy to be your first and last, but it would be preposterous to imagine it to be the case. And hardly fair."
I was not naive to her point. Yet it seemed so cold, to marry for convenience, however high my regard for Miss Morstan. Indeed, the regard seemed to make it all the worse.
"Hush," said he, looking calmer now, "You'll let me have this one thing. After all, it has been quite the week. Jones has his acclaim, you have found a wife, and Small receives his just desserts. What is left for me?"
"Goodnight, Holmes," I said, collecting my clothing. Half-dressed, I looked back at Holmes from the doorway — still shamelessly naked, he lay on his back with his head thrown back, his pale skin glowing in the candle-light. He looked sombre, and beautiful, and in all that open and unabashed glory, the most terribly affecting sight I have ever seen.
I recounted her tale to him, as accurately as possible. Holmes's expression moved slowly from interested, to lazy, to curiously frozen, pipe dangled loosely from his fingers.
In the course of my chronicling the cases of Mr Sherlock Holmes I have always striven to be as accurate as I can possibly be, for as Holmes himself often remarks, simple reality holds far more intrigue, far more of the fantastical, than anything that might emerge from my humble imagination. An astute reader, however, will have surely realised that as a narrator I am not entirely to be trusted. indeed, anyone attempting to follow up certain of the more interesting characters in my tales might find themselves quite at a loss for leads. Not to say these cases were entirely fabricated — I could not do the great British public such a disservice — but for the protection of the reputations and happiness of all concerned, I was often obliged to become somewhat inventive. I was not always alone in this; Holmes, for all his belief in analytical accuracy, derived great pleasure in discussing with me the best manner to disguise our clients, from preposterous pseudonyms to false character traits to obfuscating and contradictory dates, even elaborate and completely invented histories. I believe he thought that we were playing some great game with our readership; it delighted and amused him to scan for what I'd chosen to manufacture this time, and when he found it he would brandish my manuscript with a whoop, crying: "Oh, Watson, you've done it this time! And with only three words!"
"I mean," huffed Holmes, with unreasonable impatience, "He was a sodomite. An invert. Uranian. A sexual deviant. A follower of the Grecian way. They come up with new names for it all the time. Really, Doctor, as a medical man you ought to —"
"You're raving, man," said I, though I knew of what he spoke. But I wouldn't hear it — not now, not when I had come so close to ruining all with Mary for his sake. He could not doubt us now.
"Certainly," he said. "The man seemed quite happy, and to my surprise it was not entirely at the expense of the parties involved. The wife knew of the governess, the page knew of Lord Marshall, Lord Marshall only knew of the wife, poor man. The governess, however, knew of them all, and indeed, seemed to enjoy their company."
He did not answer beyond that, and I was beginning to believe he never would. Yet, after a full ten minutes, he finally spoke.
"Hush, Doctor, please let me explain," she said kindly. "It was not through lack of interest on my part that your pronouncement surprised me; Doctor Watson, you are a fine man, and I have never felt more at ease than in the midst of an adventure with you. But I must confess, I thought —"
Just as I said in my published account, Holmes landed me at Vauxhall at the end of the case, with a treasure box and an inspector for a companion. And just as I said, a quarter of an hour's drive brought us to Mrs. Cecil Forrester's.
"And that is where I cannot comprehend the doctrines of religion," complained Holmes, scattering the ash of his cigarette as he gesticulated. "How can sin come from those who are innocent? And how is one particular act of love a sin when others are good and wholesome? Is it purely because of the anatomy involved? Where is the sanctity in a marital arrangement that so often destroys the people who enter into it? It seems quite illogical. No, no, Watson, I shan't have any of it."
I sighed heavily and sat down, re-lighting my poor abused pipe. My mind was fairly awhirl with Holmes' pronouncements.
"Only one is left," said Holmes with brightness, although it had the ring of falsehood about it. "Only that perhaps our perspicacious Miss Morstan, in her experiences with Mr Cardwell, developed an instinct about when a man's affections are elsewhere, and was attempting to make you aware of it yourself."
"He was fond," he said. "And not a poor provider at all. And, of course, he was quite tolerant of her frequent gentlemen callers, an arrangement she seemed quite content with."
"But I am incapable of ever giving you my full attention. And what if you were to meet a man who could? Who worshipped you as though you were his sun? I beg you, please do not settle for me when a better man might have you."
"And it is this that makes me sure that I do not deserve you," I said. "You do not deserve to suffer me."
"No, no, please don't concern yourself," she said. "Oh dear, this is quite my error. What a fool I have been!"
"Holmes!" I chided, though I was not quite sure why I was angry with him. "Surely you can at least show some joy on my behalf!"
Though I knew Holmes said it only to make light and not with any sincerity, I still hoped with all my heart that this would come to pass.
We were silent for some little time afterwards until, unable to hold the whirlwind of my thoughts inside, I was driven to speak again.
"An Indian girl, most beautiful, whom I long to steal away to England. She came to me, and by that time I was already quite defeated."
Holmes and his motley gang of followers had only just arrived when we returned; they were seated about the fire, Jonathan Small looking dreadfully at ease with his wooden leg cocked over his other. Holmes gave me a long look as I entered, frowning slightly — and it was the first occasion I had to be infuriated rather than amazed at his deductive skills. I could tell from the way his brows lowered slowly that he'd noted my discomposure.
"Deduce it," he said, in a most peculiar tone, and I found that my blood ran cold. A creeping feeling, quite the same as the one I felt as Mary told the story of James Cardwell, began to overtake my senses. I realised, quite inexplicably, that I did not want to deduce it. I realised, then, why I was angry for no reason, and so keen to tell him all about it and receive his blessing; I knew as well as he that there was some deeper current to all this. Yet at that moment, my mind simply could not allow me to acknowledge what it was.
Brad Carter          "Janet, do you mind if I take a quick break? I need to chat with these guys a moment." My boss is clearly distracted by the pretty boy in front of her. "Janet? Janet?!?! Dammit Janet, pay attention!" That must've gotten through to her cause she just waves me off to take my break.
Dillon                    Turning back to them I regain a little poise, "No, he needs me. You may be able to put bruises on him and make him walk with a limp but I..." my hand touches my chest proudly, "...can help fix them."
Mycroft                 "Well, I suppose you're an adequate kisser," I said, kissing him lightly on the lips and running a hand down his neck with a smile.
James Morgan      Getting no rebuff of my actions, I settle in to give him the best blow job possible. One hand around the base of his shaft, the other cupping his balls, and that trick I know to do with my tongue on the frenulum.  Pressing my thumb in that place slightly behind his balls so I can massage his prostate externally, I suck his entire penis into my mouth until the head hits the back of my throat.
Greg                      "Yeah and Sherlock isn't the one with a bullet wound, broken collarbone and that's John's job anyway. We've got about an hour and a half till this is ready if you wanted to watch a film or something?" I said as I put the lid on and met his eye with my hands on my hips
You haven't, believe me, okay? I wouldn't just be saying this to make you feel better because that would be useless. GL
Greg                      "That wasn't your fault either and I won't stand for you thinking that. It was partly his own and those druggies he used to live or associate with." I waved a trowel in his face and brought one of the chairs from the conservatory out for Mycroft to sit comfortably rather than on the wall.
Sherlock               Rolling my eyes I turn, grabbing the crime scene photo from my pocket and shoving it towards him, "What other leads? She lied to us. She knows who else was there and she knows what happened."
Mycroft                 "Interesting. Perhaps we can discuss that later - I would be interested to know more about that." (speaking in French)  I remembered how Peter had seemed the previous evening, as he came from Greg's suite. Apparently, their interaction had been awkward.
James Morgan      "Wait." I sit up and give him a moment to redress. "It’s my fault. I went too far.  We're both a bit tired and possibly a bit drunk. Why don't you go sleep in the spare room? You're welcome to come cuddle with me if you want." Seeing his nervous look, "just cuddling."
John                      “Yes. She wasn’t happy that her Papa wasn’t there to tuck her in, but she went down.” I look over at Sherlock. “You were meant to be drinking that. You need the fluids.” I glare at him, but my eyes show sympathy and love.
Even when he's on dates with females he answers my texts. In fact my texts are the cause of the end of many of his dates with females -SH
Greg                      "Okay... Sleep well." I stayed in the doorway for a moment before turning and quietly stepping into my bedroom. I seemed to drop off immediately when I got into bed, thinking it was the stress of the day and I knew it was then when I had a nightmare about watching my brother’s house being blown up with him in it. I was screaming in my dream and could hear a baby crying, waking up with a start and feeling the sweat dripping down my face.
Sherlock               Waving a hand as I'm dragged backwards by my coat I huff, "I hope my brother makes an honest man of him at least. Boyfriends? Do you think they'll want to be called boyfriends? I had no idea my brother even liked humans, let along men, especially after his experienced with that woman, Smith."
Mycroft                 I laughed weakly. "Heaven... forbid..." I closed my eyes for a moment, and opened them, to find Sherlock standing over me, his hand over mine.
Sherlock               Pulling back I shake my head quickly, "Papa isn't angry at you little Rosie . It's all my fault. I gave you tea that was a bit not good." Sighing I make my way into the bathroom, "Don't touch my Belstaff Mycroft. I'll have it cleaned myself."
Sherlock               Squeezing his hand I smile, seeming content now, shuffling around to sit on the bed facing the wall once more next to John, "I believe that is the correct term? Or would you prefer something else? Partners is difficult as it alludes to a longer, deeper relationship and we are already working partners. Lovers is inaccurate as of yet, though we may move up to that in time."
Mycroft                 "I'm only harping on you because you won't let me do anything," I snarled at him. "I'm not a complete invalid... I know my limits. I'm a grown man."
Greg                      "No but when they're not busy, I'm doing the paperwork from when they were busy." I said lightly and tried a few more pieces before putting my fork down. I wasn't horribly skinny, but I had lost weight
Greg                      I looked back up at Mycroft who seemed to be keeping his eye away from me, my face half a smile and half a frown. "Are you sure? It really isn't going to affect a figure like yours." I smile and took another spoonful, offering it to him.
Greg                      I watched Sherlock rush off and turned back to Mycroft, giving him a small smile before a nurse came in to check his vitals again. "Get some good rest, Mycroft." I said before leaving.
Greg                      "Undisclosed location, huh?" I chuckled as I shook my head and watched the news reel continue with the other main stories repeating. I took Mycroft’s hand, noticing he was smiling is well.
Mycroft                 "It's hanging in your closet, Rosie" I respond, following her to her room as quickly as I am able
Mycroft                 "No, but I rather fear we will be glued together by morning," I giggled. "Perhaps you could get us a damp flannel?"
Mycroft                 "Nonetheless, they are far more socially acceptable than a sheet in this city, and this day and age."
Peter Harkness    “Ah, sorry man. I’ve been lucky to avoid that bullet” I chuckle. “I’m a free agent and plan to stay that way.”
Mycroft                 I had been lost in thought when Greg's question snapped me back to the present. I looked into his eyes. "Of course." I took a sip of my sparkling water.
Sherlock               I'm texting away too, before leaning to bark at the driver the address of my own hotel, nodding to Lestrade, "It's almost 6pm. I need to get back to John." Pausing my look darkens slightly, "Be gentle with my brother Lestrade."
Greg                      "Why does that not surprise me? And I kind of volunteered anyway since I'd been forced to take a month off. Which she had a part of." I started grinning and ran a hand through my hair, looking back at him with realisation.
Greg                      "Um, yeah, I got Sherlock access to Georgetown to look at blood samples and he said there was confounding evidence. There are emails too which were very.... personal... I haven't gotten around to interviewing the chef or ex-head of security." I kept my eyes down where my heart sunk because I thought this had been a date rather than something work-related.
Mycroft                 "Interesting. So, you're playing matchmaker?" I smiled slightly. After the snippets of John and Greg's conversation I'd heard earlier, I wondered aloud, "Does Greg know you're trying to set us up?"
Mycroft                 It felt good to be able to relax, and laugh. In London, I was always under an inordinate amount of pressure to perform, and this trip to Washington was far from a pleasant experience. I took another bite of my meal, and pushed it away.
Mycroft                 I handed Lestrade a glass of wine, and took one myself, and motioned to the sofa. "I find this sofa much more comfortable than the one in my office," I smiled. "I understand a pizza will be delivered shortly, as well. Thank you for that, by the way." I looked at the letters, seeing Willa's name on the envelopes, and I swallowed hard. "What are those?"
Greg                      I'd run my hand along my pajama bottoms when he'd been saying my name but when I knew he was close, I pushed them down, so I could wrap my hand around my cock properly. He sounded fucking amazing as he came, and I was using fast strokes, so he wouldn't think to check in on me with my hand in my boxers
Greg                      I smiled at Mycroft to go shut Sherlock's laptop, my hands holding a envelope full of photographs of when I was younger along with Adrian. I showed Rosie a photo of me as a young toddler, around her age and I had deep brown hair like Sherlock's but it was just swept to one side. The big grin hadn't changed
Greg                      "Well thanks anyway mate. I'll text you if we need anything else." I smiled, and I had my back to him as he walked out into the hallway.
Greg                      I shook my head as I got in with him, the cab ride mainly quiet on the way to home address. I guess it was a good time as any and I wasn't even sure what we were asking her.
Mycroft                 The doorbell rang, and I jumped up to answer it, returning to the kitchen with several take-away bags from Greg's favourite Thai restaurant. "I hope you don't mind, but I thought you could use a night off from cooking, " I smiled.
Mycroft                 My eyes widened slightly. "I... well, I..." I stammered, completely at a loss for words. a long-dormant part of my brain knew this was a date, but the rest of me refused to believe that someone like Lestrade would have the slightest interest in someone like me.
Peter Harkness    “Oh really?!” as I lean forward and pull my wallet out to drop more than enough cash on the table for our bill and ask as quietly but clearly as I can without dropping eye contact “You ready to get out of here? Maybe you teach me a little cricket? I bet there’s a game on your TV.”
Greg                      "Heavy night, was it?" I asked as I made sure he held the coffee cup well and then stepped over to close the drapes with one hand. I'd also noticed the smashed glass, knowing I couldn't pick up the millimetre bits but I got my morning newspaper to pick up the bigger bits.
Mycroft                 My clothing discarded, I climbed back onto the bed, pressing Greg into it. "Agreed." I growled, kissing him roughly.
Greg                      "Uh, yeah, thank you. Dillon, Mycroft will be through in a minute." I smiled politely and shook his hand, leading him through to the kitchen where I could still see into the living room. I know they'd been checked but the physio was a little off.
Rosie                     "Papa!! Show him your toes!" I start drinking from the juice bottle. It's just about gone when Unca tells me to stop.
Greg                      "Well, Aunty Anthea is a bit busy at the moment. She's working but I'm sure Daddy and Papa will be able to take you another day in your pretty dress." I looked at Mycroft to stay calm and took a deep breath when Rosie got down from the chair she was sat on.
Mycroft                 I sat quietly at the table with my coffee while Greg washed dishes. I knew if I got up to help him, he'd probably snap at me.
Peter Harkness    What the hell was wrong with me. I'd only known Greg a couple days and all we did was make out the one time. I had felt disappointed and a little miffed when Greg had abruptly stopped what to me had been one of the hottest and best kisses I had enjoyed in a while. And I was no blushing virgin by any means...keeping a string of steady lovers in DC was easier than one might think. I pull myself together and resolved to letting it go, to just enjoy my date with Alex, and distract myself with his great ass. It's not like I could really afford any honest romantic relationships anyway with the plan James and I were working on and its dangers. Heading back to Alex, I leave the bathroom and turn into the short hallway when I see Greg coming towards me. I stop in my tracks and he looked thoroughly shocked to see me.
Greg                      "Uh, yeah, when he wrote this a week and a half ago. Let me read it to you." I said as I turned it over and smiled again, "Dear Greg, I'm pretty sure you can guess where we are by the front of the card but if you're having one of your stupid days, it's Australia. We went to the Sydney opera house yesterday, have gotten very sunburnt and even tried vegemite." I started to read out aloud.
Mycroft                 The fog in my brain was starting to clear a little bit, but I was still very disoriented. I open my eyes a little, and saw John standing next to me. He must be responsible for the pressure on my arm.
Mycroft                 I grabbed a book, and followed him out to the garden. "I'm sure it's no surprise to you that Sherlock was a bit advanced for his age. He would have entered university at 16, if not for his... other interests." I didn't feel the need to expand on Sherlock's drug use - Greg was eminently aware of it, having rescued him from numerous drug dens over the years. That was, after all, how we'd first met - in the A&E after an overdose.
James Morgan      "Was hoping to get this done quick." I had already set my backpack down next to where the last bomb would go. "I've already set up the gas. This is the last thing we have to do before the Special Session on the 4th".
Mycroft                 "Did we live up to the fantasy?" I mumbled, enjoying Greg's warmth against me.
Greg                      "If it’s any quicker, I've driven on the other side of the road before so I can easily get us there and back." I suggested with the phone between me and Sherlock, it now on speaker to save people shouting.
Greg                              "I will try, sir. Just don't let things go to shit while I'm gone,” I smiled lightly and I was on the place to DC the next morning at 6am, all my possessions packed up and I was due to meet an assistant in DC.
Greg                      "I'm not the one who needs sleep Mycroft." I chuckled nervously, and I actually was relaxing to it, trying to keep Mycroft back against the pillows where he was pulling me towards him.
Greg                      "Yes, she did." I said slowly and kept my left hand on the table, my right continuing to stab at my food. I know I wasn’t a complete dickhead, only thinking of my career and it had taken a lot of time to think that of myself.
Sherlock               "Yourself, John and Work are all on the same level." I reassure her, "I need to get to your brother's flat as soon as possible. No time to break things down for you to understand. I'll contact you later Gary."
Sherlock               Pondering something I lean over, testing the coffee is just lukewarm before trying to dip Mycroft's finger in it, leaving it there
Sherlock                       Slamming my palms down on the desk I lean in also, almost snarling now at my brother as we come face to face, "What's your plan Mycroft? Why are you really here? You don't do 'legwork' after all, especially not work which puts you in the line of danger"
Greg                      "Okay, I'll stay but you've got to get some sleep." I said slowly as he held my hand to his cheek and I was holding my breath a little, it seemed very affectionate coming from a man like him.
Greg                      "That’s why I asked you out for dinner. Flirted with you a little, to see how he'd react." I looked up at for a moment before taking a spoonful of the ice cream and it was like heaven in a mouthful. I shut my eyes to really savour it.
Greg                      "Yeah, I've got friends that have kids and we've had kids at the yard a couple times so it just becomes natural." I shrugged as it were nothing and I quickly sipped my tea before sitting Rosie on my lap so I could start brushing her hair.
John did as he was told and lifted a hand to squeeze Sherlock’s cock, using the man’s precum to lubricate his palm and make Sherlock glide effortlessly against his grasp. He hardly even had to move his hand; the snap of Sherlock’s hips above him was enough to push the brunette man’s hard cock into and out of the tight ring of his fingers.
my teacher, and all you have to tell me is ‘you really shouldn’t do that’.  Then when I ask if you’re going to do anything to stop me, you shut up.  I could light this whole pack up and dump all the ash right here in your car and you probably wouldn’t do a damn thing about it, would you?”
”  He had a sudden, irrepressible flash back to one of his first days with Sherlock Holmes, the first case that they had worked on together, and another pill—just as reckless, just as hazardous, just as deadly as the Synathida.  John’s own words came back to him, in an echo of a past conversation.
Sherlock rushes to do as he is told, flipping onto his stomach and then pushing himself onto his knees, dropping his head and his shoulders onto the pillows like he had for John the day before, presenting himself to the man unashamedly.
There is nothing for it, though.  John clearly can’t find Sherlock on his own, and the only other person in all of England that he can possibly go to for help with Sherlock is Mycroft Holmes.
But Sherlock doesn’t seem to share John’s concern.  “I haven’t slept,” he repeats agitatedly, not looking away from his microscope.
More constructions workers were inside the building, groups of them carrying long planks of wood, some of them hammering away at studs, a couple working on the bare wiring that John could see through the exposed walls all around him.
John groans and his hands leave Sherlock’s hair to trail lower over his body, finding his pert little nipples and clamping his fingers down around them.  Sherlock gasps around his cock, the sound making John throb.  John loves how sensitive Sherlock always is after he comes.
“No.  No, it wasn’t you,” he replied with a shake of his own head.  “It was us.  I think this has been coming for a while now; we just didn’t want to face it.”  John tiredly rubbed his face with his hands, and he felt the tears threatening to spill over once again.  He wondered how much longer he was going to be able to hold them back, because he certainly didn’t have the strength to keep them in anymore.  “But I guess we just couldn’t run from it forever, could we?”
Sherlock stares at the box for a long moment, not taking it out of John’s hands.  John watches him in silence, his eyes never leaving Sherlock’s face, looking, searching for a sign, a clue, anything to show him what Sherlock is thinking.
He wants to say more, though.  He wants to say that it will be okay, that it really isn’t as bad as it seems.  Before the words can come out, though, Sherlock is up and out of his seat, pacing about the sitting room anxiously, mumbling to himself incoherently and frowning deeply.  John watches for a moment, wondering what to do.  He has never seen Sherlock this way over what someone else might think about him, and he is, quite frankly, a little stunned.  He watches, at a loss, as Sherlock finally seems to settle down long enough to stop pacing and stand in front of the mirror above their mantle, staring thoughtfully at his reflection before sighing sadly.
He turned around again, back towards Baker Street, and saw Sherlock standing in the now open doorway of the building, one hand gripping the frame and a neon orange hard hat resting ridiculously on his head.
But the frizzy haired woman just shrugged, as if the whole situation didn’t seem to bother her at all. “Well, I’m sorry, Sherlock,” she said, and her tone was careless and flippant, the usual way she talked to him, “but that’s really not my fault. You knew what would happen to your life if you succeeded in this…
Out of curiosity, Sherlock turned towards the source of the voice, and was surprised to find a group of 3 men walking towards him, two of them middle-aged and one a bit younger, maybe in his early 20’s.  One of the older men was larger than his other 2 friends, with a gold cross necklace hanging gaudily from his neck and a few missing teeth.  The second man wasn’t as big as his friend but he was more intimidating looking.  He was bald headed and covered in tattoos from what Sherlock could see through the man’s coat—the top of his neck and the bottoms of his wrists were all dark with ink.
“No,” the older Holmes answered.  “In fact, I find that particular piece of information rather…exhilarating.  But once I have offered my congratulations, we will talk about the real heart of the issue, though.”
“It was naughty of you to throw a tantrum and get Daddy to spank you like you did,” John informs him placidly as he pulls out of Sherlock, away from his stinging bum, and then pushes his hips steadily upwards again, thrusting for the first time.
“It’s not weeds, Sherlock, and if I could get you to remember to take all of your vitamins, I wouldn’t have to keep shoving vegetables and fruits down your throat.”
The feeling of nausea only slightly subsides as he makes his way through the school anxiously, heading straight for his classroom.  Some of his fellow teachers nod “good mornings” and smile at him, every single person none the wiser about what he has done with one of his pupils last night.
“So take care of me, John,” Sherlock whispers to him, tossing the bottle aside and guiding John’s hand back down between their bodies before leaning in to kiss him softly, pleadingly, on the mouth.  “Please.”
Sherlock gasps at the hit, body jerking forward and hands trying to move to shield his bottom from any more attacks.  John just tightens his grip on Sherlock’s wrists and doesn’t give him the chance to try to squirm away again—he lifts his hand once more and brings it down in a powerful arc that lands directly on the fleshy globe of Sherlock’s arse cheek.  Sherlock whimpers at that one, but John doesn’t give him a second to do much of anything else before he is spanking him again, ripping a cry from Sherlock’s throat.
When he is done he turns to look at Sherlock, standing beside him in the dark, looking small and dejected with the ice pack held tightly to his face.  John sighs.  “Do you ever think that maybe you should just keep your deductions to yourself?” he asks, and he can’t help bringing a hand up to brush an errant curl away from Sherlock’s forehead, where it has gotten stuck to some of the ointment John rubbed into a cut above his thick eyebrow.
John reaches a hand up to turn Sherlock’s face towards his own by the boy’s chin.  “Come here, you lanky twonk,” he mumbles as he brings Sherlock in for a kiss.  The angle is slightly awkward but neither one of them seems to care.  It feels interesting and John loves the way that Sherlock is pressed up so close to him.
Sherlock doesn’t seem to comprehend John’s shame over the whole issue.  He simply scoffs, burrowing his head deeper into John’s thigh, and states rather imperiously, “Of course I know that, John.  Don’t be stupid.”
“No!”  He drew away from the hand that was coming for his forehead, sinking lower into the sheets.  If John felt his fever, he would want to rush Sherlock straight to the hospital.  That could not be allowed to happen.  “Just leave me the bloody hell alone!”
Sherlock might be stubborn and domineering, even bullying more often than not, but John can see how that word breaks him down, little by little.  Sherlock responds to it almost subconsciously, stopping his fidgeting and giving John all of his attention, his ears almost perking up in interest.  Though they haven’t been using the name for long, John knows that Sherlock loves when he calls himself that, when he uses it so casually.  It pushes Sherlock more and more into a submissive headspace each time John does it, breaking down Sherlock’s barriers in bits and pieces.
Sherlock’s stomach tightens suddenly in arousal and he has to close his eyes because it’s too much, it’s perfect, it’s everything that he needs and he is afraid that it’s just a dream.
“Yes.  You know everything,” John states, as if it is simple fact.  “Of course you know why I love you.”
He had always loved to hear Sherlock play.  It moved him in a way that he didn’t think someone like himself would ever comprehend; he was a military man after all, a doctor who had seen the worst kind of wounds in war, a soldier who had been wounded in the heat of action—not a man of art.  He knew blood and pain and hurt, not the more cultured things that Sherlock knew, like German and French and classical music and art.
“Yeah,” John responds with a soft smile, reaching out to push the stray curl that is annoying Sherlock off of his forehead.  “Well,” he says, pulling a face suddenly and retracting his hand, “on second thought, maybe not.  Might just be ‘boring’ to you.”  He stands from his perch on Sherlock’s desk and walks across the room, grabbing up his wallet and keys and making to leave.  He knows that Sherlock won’t let him go, though, and he hides his smile as he walks away from his student.
But he doesn’t care about any of that now.  He only wants more, harder, deeper, faster, and he can hear the words falling out of his open mouth in huffs of air as Sherlock fucks into him from behind, relentlessly, and John moans into his forearms as they brace his head against the floor.
, John,” Sherlock shouts, pounding both fists lightly on John’s chest once more in frustration.  “Why wear her ring, why let her kiss you, why go to all of these places with her, if you don’t love her anymore?”
of me.  You love the way I make you feel.  The way you come alive around me.  But when it’s all over and you’ve had your fill, you come back home, to your wife, to your life.”  John can feel Sherlock shake his head; can hear it in the soft rustle of his curly hair against the pillow.  “You don’t love me.  You love what I give you.”
The sharp, loud tone of his ringer split the still air of the room and Sherlock could do nothing for a few seconds but stare at it, his heart hammering in his chest.
is the one causing Sherlock that pain.  It kills him, rips his heart in two.  He won’t survive hurting Sherlock like this; he’ll die from the agony of it.  So he gives up, gives in, gives himself over to Sherlock completely, finally, irrevocably.  He never had a chance against Sherlock Holmes, anyway.  He sees that now.  He was stupid to think that he ever did.  Who has he been trying to fool?  He has been fighting a losing battle this whole time, and he is only now beginning to realise that, idiot that he is.  One look at Sherlock now, beautiful and sweetly flushed and so close to finally being
At this, Sherlock turns slowly to look at him, just like John knew he would, weighing his words.  “And who, exactly, says that it’s not fair to me?” he asks, voice biting.  John can see that he is angry.  There is a wild glint in his eyes and his skin looks paler than usual, with two high spots of colour standing out starkly on his cheeks.  “Don’t you think that’s something that
!” Sherlock whines, and the man gives him a hard stare.  “Daddy,” the younger male amends, softening his voice and blushing.  John can feel a warmth stirring low in his belly at Sherlock calling him that name in that tone.  It never fails to do something to John, no matter how tired the doctor might be.
He immediately stops thrusting and looks down at Sherlock for what seems like the first time since John began fucking him.  Sherlock’s face is set in a grimace of pain and John rapidly becomes aware of Sherlock’s hands on his hips, a steady pressure trying to take control of John’s thrusts in a futile effort to minimise the pain.
He lets Sherlock ride out the waves of his orgasm, getting closer to the edge himself.  He is almost there when Sherlock pulls away from him before he can finish, making John slide all the way out of him.  Sherlock turns around instantly on the bed, heedless of the mess he has made.  John makes a disgruntled sound but Sherlock instantly bends low to take John into his mouth, sucking him all the way to the back of his throat in one smooth move.
“Sherlock, I…got you something,” he says, voice stuttering and going soft.  Now that he’s here, in Sherlock’s room with the teenager watching him, about to take the toy out of the bag, he feels abruptly nervous.  He knows he hadn’t felt ashamed when he bought it but now that Sherlock is sitting here in front of him, all 180 centimeters of teenage genius and elegant silk dressing gown, he feels the dark edges of doubt and uncertainty begin to creep in.  He’s already in it now, though, and John has never backed down from anything before.  He was a soldier, after all.  So he squares his shoulders and determinedly removes his purchase from the bag, holding the toy out to Sherlock and biting back a breath as the adolescent turns an uninterested, glass-green gaze upon him.
John isn’t quite able to bite back his sigh completely this time, but he still doesn’t say anything as he spreads more marmalade on Sherlock’s toast—an ample, sticky layer of it that is almost as thick as the bread itself now.
He goes home Thursday night in a dark mood, but it isn’t anger that he feels.  It’s despair.  His heart aches from the crushing weight of it and his hands shake from the fear of it.  At dinner time, he drinks most of his meal and pushes his food around his plate.  The liquor feels heavy on an empty stomach and numbs everything quickly.  He knows he will be drunk soon if he continues drinking like this without eating anything, but he just pokes at his food, not able to take a bite of it. Mary eats, silently watching him with narrowed eyes, but he doesn’t care.  He just doesn’t care about what she may think anymore.  What does it matter—what does any of it matter—without Sherlock in his life?
Sherlock glares up at him as John leaves his mouth empty once more, and John can’t help but chuckle slightly.
No. For the most part, as far as Sherlock could tell, the baby was healthy.  Healthy, and handsome.  A perfect human specimen.
Sherlock moans at the feeling, enjoying it.  He raises himself up along John’s cock, lifting his hips experimentally before sliding back down, taking more of the man than he has ever done, making them both groan.  Sherlock seems to like the sensation of it rather a lot, because he does it again, lifting up and then pressing back down, taking almost all of John’s length now.  He is all reckless abandon, squirming delightfully on the man’s prick, until John sinks in deeper and Sherlock gasps sharply as John hits that perfect spot inside of him.  Little shudders and shivers wrack Sherlock’s body as he shakes with the effort of holding still for a long moment, getting used to the pleasure of it.
They stared at each other coldly from across the coffee table, both knowing that neither was going to give in and that they could spend hours like this if they let it continue—as they had done before in the past.
He was speechless, breathless as he stared at everyone who had come just for him.  So many people were there, so many people whom he had always assumed didn’t like him, or were indifferent about him.  A few old school acquaintances like Seb Wilkes and a handful of old clients that he had solved cases for, Henry Knight and his new fiancé among them.  Most of the people there were from Scotland Yard and St. Bart’s, but there was also Mrs. Hudson, Dr. Greenwhich, James McNairn, and a few other pro-Synaths.
“Sherlock, we need to have a word,” he called out through the door of the bathroom.  There was a moment of silence, when even the heaving of Sherlock’s stomach went still, and then the sound of the toilet being flushed and running water.
But, Sherlock guessed that he deserved it, after all of the trouble he had caused for the doctor with his staff.
“So,” he begins, and he sounds endearingly awkward.  “Do you like the submission stuff a lot, then?”
“Thank you, baby,” he says and he means it.  His heart swells with love and pride, knowing that Sherlock thinks he is perfect just the way he is, that Sherlock wouldn’t change him for a thing.  It makes him feel less disgusted with himself.
They ate in silence for the rest of the meal, and when they were done Sherlock happily went about getting showered and dressed in one of the outfits he had bought yesterday. Though he would never admit it, John knew how good the brunette felt about finally having clothes that fit him properly again. And, since Sherlock had always been on the thin side, he had been able to get away with simply buying larger-sized dress shirts and slacks, not having to bother with the hassle of getting an entire wardrobe completely tailored and customized specifically for these next few months.
John waits for him to go on but the silence only stretches.  After a long moment, when Sherlock still won’t speak, the teacher prompts, “Then what are you still doing here?”
Instead of going home, John heads out to the pub.  He doesn’t bother asking Mike to meet him; he doesn’t want company right now.  All he wants is to be left alone to drown his misery in alcohol, and to think.  Think about the stupid choices he has made to put himself in this position, and what he needs to do to get his life back on track, back to something decent and whole and good.  His marriage is nothing more than a joke and a façade, he knows.  Sherlock leaving has made John realise that the teen is exactly the one thing that John doesn’t want to live without.
Sherlock doesn’t like it but John thinks that he has dictated too much in their relationship already, and John isn’t going to let Sherlock push himself into something he isn’t ready for.  After a couple weeks of watching Sherlock touch himself under John’s direction and gaze, though, John’s will is starting to wear thin.  John has never considered himself a weak man by any means.  He was a soldier, after all; he has been to war.  But the sight before him now is too much.
It kills him to say no, but he knows he can’t say yes.  “Sherlock, love…I can’t do that.  I—we’re—I have to go to Mary’s grandmother’s birthday with her this weekend, out in the country.  Her whole family is going and it will look odd if I don’t, if I have to cancel on her last minute.  I won’t be able to lie to her about where I’ll be for a whole weekend, and if I don’t go with her she probably won’t go at all.”
"You've...been wearing it all day?" John asks, breathless, because he can think of nothing else to say. He looks at Sherlock and licks his lips.
around the room in case he missed something and there was someone else there.  It is extremely unlikely, but one never knows with Sherlock Holmes.  “Who are you talking to?”
But there is just something about the way Sherlock Holmes fucks him that has John forgetting all of that.
“Oh, God, Sherlock,” John says, pulling out of him quickly in an effort to make things better, to stop Sherlock from hurting.  Even that, though, causes Sherlock pain as John’s balance is a bit off due to the whisky, and his movements are jerky and rushed.  “I’m sorry.  I’m so sorry, love,” John stammers, crawling off of Sherlock carefully and kneeling beside him, running fluttering hands all over Sherlock’s body in an attempt to assess the damage done.  “I don’t know what came over me.  I wasn’t thinking clearly, I was…” he runs through the excuses in his head, a million of them, each one as meaningless as the last.  There is never an excuse good enough for hurting Sherlock this way, he knows.
After they leave Baker Street they take a walk past shops and people, tourists and Londoners all going about their hectic day.
And although John knows the cut must hurt like hell, Sherlock looks as though it hurts him even more to have John be disappointed with him.
“I understand completely, John.”  Sherlock’s deep voice was like stone, hard and unmovable, and he loomed over the doctor, hurt and angry that John could think that he would possibly do anything other than rebuild Baker Street.  This was his
221 Baker Street no longer stood solemn and stagnant against the black London sky.  Now, instead, it was burning.  A roaring fire that was consuming everything that it touched.  He could barely even see the brick façade of the building behind the flames.  All that was left was a wall of fire that was reaching towards the dark heavens above it, casting an orange glow over everything on the whole block.  There were two fire trucks on the street in front of 221 already, and the firemen were focusing their high powered water hoses on the edges of the fire, the corners of the structure, protecting the surrounding buildings from the flames as best they could.  There was nothing they could do except wait for the flames to burn themselves out.  No amount of water would make a difference in that fire, even Sherlock could see that.
They are both completely naked save for John’s vest, as usual, and he rubs his hard prick against Sherlock’s slowly, deeply, savouring the feel of them pressed together.  Sherlock kisses him like a drowning man would breathe air and his long fingers are suddenly gripping the edge of John’s undershirt.  He tugs it up John’s torso until it catches underneath John’s armpits where it stays, the blond not lifting his arms.
Warnings: This chapter gets slightly heavier on the praise kink than it has in past chapters (here’s where that slight Daddy kink tag might come into play for the first time, but I really think that it is just a twisted praise kink at this point in the story.  Nothing about the daddy kink is mentioned other than the names John calls Sherlock.)  This chapter is also pretty heavy on the dirty talk, but let’s just go ahead and make that a default warning for the rest of the story…John has a filthy mouth.  I don’t apologize…
, Sherlock?” he repeats, and he can hear a hysterical note beginning to creep into his voice.  “Are you hurt?”
The other man was right, of course.  And Sherlock had to remind himself that John didn’t have the same mental and physical prowess that Sherlock himself had—of course John’s weaker, untrained mind and body would need more of those basic necessities than Sherlock’s.
“Of course you can,” John said with a sigh.  “Come on.  Let’s turn in early tonight.  I bet you could use the rest.”
“John, I can’t,” he whimpers, head shaking back and forth, and the pressure on his cock suddenly becomes too much, too intense, and he pushes John off of him, away from him with a sigh of relief.  “I—I want to, so badly, but I just
John huffs beside him, shuffling his feet in his irritation.  His aluminium cane scrapes along the ground gratingly.  “And how could you possibly know that?” he asks, annoyed.
“You had no right to answer my phone, John!” Mary yells at him, looking furious now.  There are twin spots of dark colour high on her cheeks and her blue eyes are slits as she glares at him.  “You promised you would stop doing stuff like that!”
Sherlock drops to kneel before him willingly enough—without a second thought, without any argument.  He even raises shaking hands to help John open his trousers because the man’s fingers don’t seem to want to work right either.  Between the two of them, they manage to get John’s button undone and the zipper pulled down.  John doesn’t take his trousers off, though.  He wants to stay dressed while Sherlock kneels before him completely naked, so he just pushes down the waistband of his pants and pulls his hard, engorged cock out of his clothes, holding it silently out for Sherlock.
“Yes,” the brunette man said, motioning the foreman over to him and telling him something about the wall that he had been staring at, pointing with his long arm across the length of it.  The foreman listened to him intently and then nodded his head, hard hat bobbing.
Greg                      I could feel him squirming a little, but I kissed his thighs, perhaps leaving a small mark just visible enough for him and when I began fiddling with his boxers, he lifted my chin, so I could meet his eye.
Mycroft                 "I think dinner would be a good idea," I said slowly. "Perhaps this evening? I happen to know your schedule is clear," I said with a slight smile.
Greg                      I shuffled back so I could lay on the bed properly and I was gobsmacked with his body, slim with freckles everywhere. I wanted to trace every one but he was obviously wanting to concentrate on me with the way he got back on the bed.
Greg                      "Fair enough. Then tell me your suspicions. What evidence can I access to uphold your theory?" I asked once I'd finished my mournful and knew he was holding something back but went on none the less.
Sherlock               Glancing at Lestrade I give him a little huff, then mutter, "And who are these Rocky and Bullwinkle people also? Are they involved?"
Mycroft                 I glanced briefly at my brother, then looked at the officer. "I'm sorry, officer, I have more important issues to deal with at the moment, as do you. Are you aware of what is going on in Congress at the moment?" I said as calmly as I could manage.
Dillon                    My eyes sweep up and down the cute silver fox, winking, "Might as well give him a trim all over old man. Looks like he gets quite a bit of action. Now, I'll just take my equipment through." turning, I grab a large box in one hand and a fold-up physio table to wheel through
Give me 10 minutes GL. "Mycroft... I’m heading out to meet Sherlock. I'll see you later." I leant over the bed to gently rock his arm, kissing the side of the head when he looked over at me tiredly. He'd been working hard the last few days.
But John denies him that.  Sherlock tries to direct him there, over and over again, but every time Sherlock’s hips rise towards John’s hand—so close, he’s so close—John only moves to grip his hips softly, pushing his body back down onto the mattress.  And when Sherlock opens his mouth to speak—not to beg, not to plead, certainly not—John instantly shushes him with a deep kiss.
“It won’t be a lot,” John promises.  He knows the secret to getting Sherlock to eat is to give him small portions, sneak him food bit by bit.
Lestrade began to look a tad uncomfortable, as if he were being pulled into the middle of a situation he did not want to be in.  “Well, yeah.  I thought you knew that.”  He found the dregs in the bottom of his teacup suddenly very interesting.  “He never called to tell you when he was coming around?”
He grabs up a new bottle of lubricant that he had bought specifically for their first weekend together and pours its contents into his palm, rubbing it around, then puts his middle finger back in place.  He presses the tip gently against the rim of Sherlock’s entrance, waiting.  “Sherlock, look at me,” he says, because John wants to see Sherlock, wants to know what he looks like when John is penetrating him.
John fidgeted in Sherlock’s chair, suddenly unsure of what to do.  He wanted to ask the other man if he could…but Sherlock would probably only glare at him and say something biting, most likely about how John was ruining his chance to collect valuable information for his data by wasting Sherlock’s time trying to feel the baby for himself.
John didn’t disagree with him, and Sherlock knew that was as close to an agreement as he would get out of the man.
No, he can’t wait.  Everything about Sherlock makes every piece of sense that John has fly straight out the window.  Reasonably, John should know that if it is meant to be, a few months or even a year isn’t anything; he should know that if Sherlock really loves him, he’ll wait for John.
foods,” John debated, throwing his hands up in the air in desperation. “You need the nutrients from fruits and vegetables, and the protein from meats. At the rate you’re going, you’ll probably give birth to a jelly-filled, chocolate baby.”
Sherlock chokes on his mouthful, coughing and spluttering adorably, but that’s understandable—it’s not easy swallowing for the first time, and Sherlock is on his back.  Of course there is bound to be a bit of a mess.  John is quick to pull out of him, letting him breathe and swallow as best he can.  There is spit and some left over semen that he hadn’t managed to take that is now covering his chin and lips, dripping down one cheek lewdly.
He thinks that the worst of it is over, that he will be able to leave without any more guilt or sorrow, but as he reaches for the door Mary finally speaks.
“Again, Sherlock?” John says with an exasperated sigh the next time they meet at the coffee shop.  “What happened this time?"
“Come here, then.  Undress and lie down on the bed for me,” John tells him as he helps Sherlock off of him and motions for the boy to lie face down in front of John.  Sherlock messily sheds the rest of his clothes and clambers onto the mattress on all fours, teddy bear still juggled from one hand to the other, and crawls to the middle of the bed.  He settles on his stomach with his arms stretched out above him, both hands clutching his toy as it rests by the headboard above his head.  He turns to look at John over his shoulder as the man undresses, eyes soft and worried.
John tries to hide his triumphant smile and basks in his glory.  The next rule, he knows, won’t go over quite as easily.
“Mr. Holmes?  I’m Dr. Lambert.  Dr. Greenwhich is still with one of his other patients, so I’ll be taking care of you today.”  The woman turned towards John and her smile seemed to grow to epic proportions.  “I don’t believe anyone here has met your friend, Mr. Holmes,” she said pleasantly.  “Is this the fath—”
John suddenly feels ashamed and disgusted with himself.  “God, Sherlock, I’m so sorry,” he says.  “You come to me for help and I don’t do anything—I don’t even know you’re here.  I’m so sorry.”  John’s apology seems to be too much for Sherlock to bear because the younger male suddenly takes a shuddering breath against John’s neck that sounds like it may turn into a whimper. “Shh, it’s all right, you’re safe,” John whispers to him, running his fingers through the soft, curly hair.  “Just close your eyes.  No one can hurt you now.  Not here.  Not while you’re with me.”
for something like that.  “Cocaine,” Sherlock clarifies.  “It got very bad, very quickly.  Before Mycroft stepped in and placed me in a rehab facility, there were a few…incidents that had to be covered up or taken care of.  Nothing too major, I don’t know why he has to complain about it so much.”  Sherlock pauses again and John knows that look that crosses his face, has seen it only a handful of times on the boy but there is no mistaking it.  It is sadness.
Beside him on the sofa, he feels the cushions dip and move.  Sherlock’s weight and body heat settle into place next to him as John keeps his face hidden away behind the cover of his fingers, his elbows resting on his knees.
“Do you want me to call you ‘Daddy’?” Sherlock asks John suddenly one day after school as they lie on the teen’s bed, clothes thrown haphazardly around Sherlock’s cluttered room and stiff cocks pressed close to one another’s.
“Why?” Sherlock asked, eyebrows knotting into a frown underneath the lip of his hard hat.  “You had always said that you wanted a bigger flat.”
Sherlock comes back to school the next day and John tries not to blush like a bloody schoolboy while he gives his lesson to Sherlock’s class, but he doesn’t succeed.  He figures it is best to pretend that their last conversation never happened, though, and Sherlock seems content to go along with him.  Another week of secret smiles, butterflies in his stomach, four late night cups of coffee and ninety-seven text messages pass by in a blur and before John knows it, the weekend of his first teacher’s workshop is there.  It is just a three-day trip for a few of the teachers to sit in on lectures about effective education management, but he has yet to let Sherlock know that he will be away for the weekend, so when they met at the shop on Thursday night John tells him.
While John watches Mary get ready to leave, he realises suddenly that they have not argued in several days, the entire time that Sherlock has been away.  It is new and it is strange, but it is also so, so nice.  To know that they aren’t going to jump back into the middle of a previous, unfinished row when he gets home from work in the evenings, or when he wakes up in the mornings, is something that he hasn’t experienced in years.  She smiles at him as she finishes packing, talking happily about nothing of importance, and he notices that she looks younger when she smiles that way, prettier.  She hugs him before she leaves and he hugs her back.  John is happy, truly happy, in a way that he hasn’t been in years and so is she—he can see it.   He does not stop to dwell on the fact that they are happy, yes, but most certainly not because of each other.
At that, John smiles.  “Even you?” he asks, pressing forwards for another kiss when Sherlock tries to pull away.  “You’re the best part of me, Sherlock.  The part that makes everything about me better.”
That got Sherlock to look at him.  John was hardly ever forceful with Sherlock, not in this way, and Sherlock knew that.  “John,” he started, “why are you—”
“Thanks for the tea, lads,” McNairn said, turning on the landing to give the boys one last look. “And for the photo opp,” he admitted freely. He gave both John and Sherlock a stern look, one that spoke of many wars waged and some even won, and John could see even in the poor light on the landing that the lines on his face were etched deep and hard into his skin.
he thought to the fetus. At this rate, his child was going to be born thinking he was some sort of bumbling buffoon who couldn’t even put two planks of wood together to make a basic structure.
It’s not much to look at.  It is a plain, battered old box, the kind one might find an older gentleman’s pocket watch in.  The lid is hinged, but so rusted that the metal is almost completely black.  When John opens up the box for Sherlock to see the contents inside, the bottom of the box is covered with a raised velvet lining.  The lining is the same dull, dirtied brown colour as the outside of the box, which may have been maroon at one point.  Underneath the lid, sitting on the raised velvet lining, are two circular, engraved metal disks speckled with dirt and grime, and threaded through a silver ball chain.
“My father was a mechanic,” Sherlock tells him one night when John pesters him about his home life.  The teen has never said a single word about his family and John is indecently curious.  “A great one, once.  A long time ago.”
“Sit up,” he orders, voice a little too harsh in his need but he hardly notices.  “Need your mouth.  Get Daddy nice and wet so he can fuck you.”
John pulls away to look at Sherlock one more time and glances up to find that the brunet has suddenly turned desperate in between one moment and the next.  His mouth hangs open slightly from the teasing, fleeting touch to his dick which shines brightly in the sunlight now covered with John’s spit.  Sherlock’s pupils have blown and there is only the thinnest ring of that gorgeous colour surrounding a wide, deep blackness.  He pants and squirms beneath John as he reaches out to touch himself, no longer able to keep still for the man.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Sherlock says with a wave of his hand.  “I can’t do that with the last drug still in your system.  The results would be thrown off completely.”
.  “Sherlock, I don’t really think this is something that you should be telling me.”  John can hear the words coming out of his mouth, a jumble of noises as he rushes to say them.  He licks his lips nervously again and looks around the shop, wanting to be sure that no one can hear them.  As usual, they are alone in their secluded little corner.  “We shouldn’t be discussing anything even remotely linked to your…your body.”  God, that body…
“Oh really?” he asks, rousing himself with a smile and a rustle of sheets.  John heaves himself up on his forearms and crawls over Sherlock, boxing him in underneath John’s bed-warm weight.  “Bees, huh?  What, like, honey bees?” he asks, nuzzling into Sherlock’s neck and placing sloppy kisses along the skin that he knows is sensitive there.  Sherlock giggles sleepily and squirms beneath him.
And that’s the heart of it, right there.  John knows that it’s true because he thinks he might feel the same way about Sherlock, strange and wrong though it may be.  There is no denying, though, that the two
“What’s wrong, love?” John asks him tenderly, sitting close but mindful to keep his hands to himself for the moment, despite how hard it is when all he wants to do is run his fingers through Sherlock’s hair and stroke his cheek.
John opens his mouth to answer Mike but then pauses and frowns once again, because he honestly doesn’t know how to respond to that question either, and it twists his gut uncomfortably.  This is twice now in the short span of a few days that he has had to think about his future with Mary, and with Sherlock.  Before this, he hasn’t ever allowed himself to think about divorcing Mary to be with Sherlock, mostly because he doesn’t know if it is something that Sherlock wants.  Oh, John knows that Sherlock wants John to leave Mary, but whether or not Sherlock wants John to leave Mary for
He follows Sherlock’s request and doesn’t speak to him for a long, excruciating week—much longer than John had made Sherlock wait when he told the boy not to speak to him that one time, what feels like an eternity ago now.
“It’s hardly your fault, John,” Sherlock tried to reason with him, but John was having none of it.  He began to pace the bedroom floor by Sherlock’s side of the bed, agitated and angry.
Sherlock sits at his desk behind his microscope, looking up at him in confusion.  “Why did you do that?”
“I…” He didn’t know what to say, didn’t know what to think. The alcohol and the crowd in the pub were giving everything a distorted sort of feeling, and he really just needed a bit of fresh air and a good night’s sleep. “Just walk me home, you tosser,” he finally said with a grin.
A small bunch of stuffed animals caught his eyes, surrounded by other toys, and he sighed in relief, walking over to an area of the store that he felt much more comfortable in. But when he picked up a small teddy bear and looked at the price tag, the panic came back tenfold.
Sherlock whimpers, biting his lip and thrusting his hips up, water splashing against the sides of the tub and sloshing around noisily.  “Yes, Daddy, please.”
But despite all of that, John still shook his head, hard, as if trying to dispel the cloud of arousal that had settled over him.  “No, we can’t, Sherlock,” he said, and his voice was rough with longing and guilt.  “The doctor said no sexual intercourse until the stitches have healed and you aren’t so easily fatigued.”
They did save each other.  And now John knows that he has to save Sherlock again, hopefully for the last time.
It amazes him, the things they can do to each other, the force of their feelings for one another.  It is frightening to know each holds the other’s happiness so firmly in his hands.
He sighs and runs a hand through his greying, short blond hair, frustrated.  “Sherlock, can we just…not do this right now?” he asks, and winces at the pleading sound in his voice.
John groans at the image underneath him.  His resolve wavers as he stares at the wet, plump cupid’s bow of Sherlock’s mouth, thinking about the way it feels around his cock, knowing he shouldn’t even bother putting up a fight anymore.  John suspects that Sherlock actually likes this game mostly because of the fact that he can be an incorrigible little brat yet still wind up getting his way in the end, the little tosser.
“He can’t understand why I’m not more like him,” Sherlock continues, fiddling with the edge of his coffee cup now and not looking at John.  “Motivated, ambitious, driven, successful.  By my age he was in a better school, getting better marks, and he expects the same out of me.  He thinks that just because we are brothers then that must mean that we share similar experiences during childhood.  Therefore he feels that I should have the same drive as he does and that my raising shouldn’t be the reason that I am not like him.  If he could become successful, he believes that I should, too.”
Sometimes they are small things, like when the two are out doing the shopping and John ends up rowing with the chip and pin machines again.  He always gets quite worked up after that happens, annoyed and frustrated, and he is usually in a foul mood.  All it takes is a look from Sherlock, though, a gentle touch and a barely audible “Daddy,” murmured on a breath before John is forgetting everything that happened and attending to any of Sherlock’s needs.  He knows that sometimes Sherlock does it just to get John out of his mood, and that is fine with John.  He isn’t ashamed to say that that word, spoken by Sherlock, is like a reset button, clearing away any of the day’s problems and making everything that isn’t Sherlock just disappear.
“Put your fingers in your arse,” he said into the phone, his cock twitching in his hand as he pictured Sherlock preparing himself, knuckle deep into his own tight hole. “Stretch yourself wide so that you can take all of me.”
He had had to come to terms with those feelings and the fact that those feelings were attached to certain people…and in the center of those few people was John Watson.  His first true friend and his only true love.  He had not thought that anyone could take up more space in his heart or that the fear of losing anyone could be greater than what he felt for John.
“Because it’s not appropriate, Sherlock!”  John can’t help the shrill note that has crept into his voice now, that thin edge of hysteria and panic.  “I’m your teacher, and I’m almost 20 years older than you, and you’re not even old enough to legally be considered an adult,” he lists the reasons off.  “But, mostly, this just isn’t something people normally talk about in social settings with acquaintances like this.  That information is very private and should be kept that way.”
Sherlock didn’t say anything to John; he simply took the magnifying glass from the doctor’s hand rudely, giving John a skeptical look.  If he didn’t know any better, he would think that John had gone into his pockets and taken the magnifying glass out just to have a laugh at him—he could have sworn he had left the damn thing in his coat after the last time he had used it.
“Yes,” Sherlock hears himself say as John nudges the head in, and he doesn’t even know what he is saying yes to, but it doesn’t matter.  “Yes.”
Halfway through class John looks to the back of the room and sees Sherlock sitting at his table with his long fingers resting just inside the open collar of his shirt, playing along the tiny balls of the metal chain sitting delicately against his pale neck.
Inadequate as his words are, Sherlock seems to know what he means, aware of the depth of emotion between them right now.  “What do
John had been right about one thing: his whole body ached for days after his little tryst with Sherlock on the living room floor, and he was horrified to see dark, almost bruise-like love bites forming on his neck from where Sherlock had bitten him—a few in places that the stiff collars of his button-down shirts couldn’t even hide.
“Lestrade can go fuck himself,” John answered sharply.  “I’m done thinking we are going to be safe if we just lie low.”
“This is so wrong,” John says once he is sitting on the desk again, completely naked this time, using his arms to lean back sharply so that it is easier for the fruit to be placed on him.  Sherlock is kneeling between his spread thighs now, still fully clothed in his pyjama bottoms and sleep shirt, reaching out for the last bit of fruit in the container.  John can’t take his eyes off of the teen for the life of him.  He sucks in a sharp breath when Sherlock spreads a small piece of cut strawberry at the base of his cock and uses some of the juice at the bottom of the container to rub up and down his hard shaft, coating it, the feeling cold and slick against his flushed skin.
As John searches his cupboards for something halfway edible, he notices that he can’t stop grinning.  He is happy and completely relaxed in a way that he has not been in many years, all of his cares and worries seeming to have floated away during the night.  He finally finds a few tins of beans pushed to the back of a shelf and decides that it will have to be that and toast for breakfast.  As a contingency plan, John pulls out a few different jars of jam and marmalade from the fridge and sets everything on thekitchen table, not sure exactly what Sherlock likes on his bread.  John hopes they can make a half-way decent meal, at least, out of the poor supplies he’s been able to scrounge up.
“Good,” John whispers against his tangled curls, pressing a kiss there before he, too, drifts off, happy with the knowledge that he is still filling Sherlock.
There is this: kisses and caresses and soft sighs and gentle thrusts against each other.  They can have this, for as long as they want.  They are coming together here in this room with a new future revealed to them, each holding the other’s wildly beating hearts gently, trying to soothe and calm with soft kisses that taste like promises in the darkness.
He pushes those thoughts aside and hurries up the steps, though, because as much as John hates when Mycroft visits, the doctor knows that Sherlock hates it even more.
John stares at him for a moment in shock.  Over the months, he has seen Sherlock in an assortment of moods and strange situations, but he hasn’t seen anything quite like this.  Sherlock won’t stop moving, and he has resumed mumbling to himself, running his hands through his hair twitchily and adding to the disaster of it as he wanders amongst his mess while talking to no one.
Sherlock gives up his struggle against John’s arms and relaxes back into the man once again.  “It’s your own fault, you know,” he tells John, as if it is all so obvious.
When John snorted himself awake, sometime later, he rubbed at his face tiredly and checked the time on his wrist watch, throwing Sherlock a confused look after he saw the hour of the night.
.  “Even at a secondary school level, where children are supposed to be more mature by this age, you have seen the results of my…peculiarities.  I managed to advance through sixth form and that’s why I’m taking my A-Levels at the end of the year.  But the results of leaving peers of my own age behind were…disagreeable.  I’m not good with people.  If I were to go to another school, I’m afraid the consequences would be just as…unpleasant, if not more so.”
John hadn’t expected him to come just then and the head of Sherlock’s cock hadn’t been far enough back in John’s throat for him to contain most of the mess, but he swallows as much of it as he can.  He chuckles as he licks his lips and runs the back of his hand across his mouth to wipe off the rest, then again with his other hand to be sure he got everything.  It’s all a bit slick and messy, and John absolutely loves it because it’s
They lie in bed for a moment longer, trying to slow the heaving of their chests.  When their breathing has returned to normal John sits up.
He hasn’t had any sort of sexual release with a partner in so long; it doesn’t even matter that Sherlock isn’t touching him.  John’s body is pulled as tight as a bow string and he knows that anything can set him off right now.  He grits his teeth and slows his stroking because he’ll be damned if he will shoot off before a teenager who has been touching himself for the better part of thirty minutes.
John comes with a body-wracking shudder, spilling onto the floor beneath him shamelessly in a messy puddle that Sherlock creates by wanking John’s cock harshly so that the liquid sprays everywhere.  In his over-sensitive state John tries to pull away from the stimulation and his knees land in the mess, smearing it even more across the floor and his skin.
John can’t resist.  He pulls his hips back suddenly and then snaps them forward swiftly, hard, just once.  Sherlock gasps underneath him, moaning in surprise and pleasure.  John’s hands move and grip Sherlock’s waist to gain some leverage and he sets up a steady pace, thrusting into Sherlock’s pliant body as the teen scrabbles to get a hold of the table, to grab onto something to ground him.  But John’s thrusts rock him too roughly against the desk and all Sherlock can do is cling to the edge of it desperately, moaning as every brush of John’s cock slides over his prostate.
“Daddy,” Sherlock whines, his voice broken and breathless as he sags into John’s body, letting the man hold him, use him, fuck him however he wishes.  John can feel Sherlock’s cock pressed tight between their bellies, sliding slickly through the smeared precome that Sherlock has leaked all over them, the feel of it no doubt wonderful on Sherlock’s stiff prick.  God, he always gets so wet, it drives John crazy to feel it, see it, to know that he is the cause of it.  John presses his hips up faster, harder into Sherlock’s arse, squeezing the brunet tighter to his body, giving them both more.
Sherlock is right, of course.  John had been so scared of caving to Sherlock’s demands the last time the subject was brought up that he had automatically said “no” and left no room for discussion.  “If you still don’t want to do it after we talk about it, like
Sleeping like this with Sherlock, wrapped around him tightly in his bed, feels right.  John feels complete in a way he hasn’t for years.  Too many years.  He never wants this moment to end.  He wishes like hell that the weekend could last forever.  But he sighs sadly because he knows that nothing can stop Sunday night from coming around, no matter how much he doesn’t want it to.
John knows that it isn’t enough, though, it will never be enough, and he pushes another finger into Sherlock’s body.  The teen winces and draws in a sharp breath, and John groans at the tightness and heat surrounding his fingers.  His cock throbs against Sherlock’s thigh and he knows he won’t be able to wait much longer before he needs to push inside that wet warmth, before he has to have Sherlock surround him, cover him, take him in.
When they get to the restaurant, John sits at the table next to his wife and orders dinner and a drink from the bar mechanically, not really paying any attention.  He tries to keep the scowl off of his face as he seethes in silent anger but he doesn’t think he does a very good job of it.  On the bright side, Mary and Mike seem to notice that he wants to be left alone and so no one talks to him much, leaving him to stew in his own rage.
“There you go, come on, baby,” he coaxes soothingly while Sherlock whines around his mouthful as he finally manages a second climax.
He looks at the man-child standing in front of him, glass green eyes fixed squarely on long, pale, bony bare feet.  John thinks his glare would be much more intimidating if he were still able to look down at Sherlock, but the teen has had several growth spurts now and they have all left him taller than John by leaps and bounds.  He tries not to let it affect his scolding, though.
“Sherlock, we aren’t going to be able to sneak away from this without a car waiting,” John retorted, pushing against the brunette to try to get him back in the flat. “Get back inside and call a cab. We can leave as soon as it gets here.”
John sits them down at a table by the door and tells Sherlock to keep his coat on for good measure.  A lot of the men in the pub have been off at war for an untold amount of time, and he knows they would do anything to get a leg over on someone as gorgeous and young as Sherlock—the boy doesn’t have to taunt them with wide open collars and flashes of too much pale skin and tight fitting dress shirts.
Finally, after minutes of nothing, he breaks the silence.  “You were awful today, Sherlock.  Really horrible,” he says, and his tone is chastising, scolding.
Sherlock’s eyes are closed as he lies prostrate on his bed, his hands held up in front of his lips and pressed together at the palms.  His skin is a healthy colour and his breathing seems regular, but without checking his pulse or looking in his eyes, John can’t be completely sure that he is okay.
John fucks into him again, harder this time, the sound of his thighs meeting Sherlock’s arse cheeks reverberating loudly off of the walls of the bedroom.  Sherlock whimpers as John pounds into him, clutching at John’s shoulders.  His fingernails bite into the man’s skin and his lips are a thin white line as he presses them together.  “Daddy’s sorry that it hurts, baby, but you deserve it,” John tells him, panting as he thrusts harshly, pulling on Sherlock’s hips to help bring the boy down onto him with extra force.  “Do you know why?”
Yes, because it wasn’t just him and John anymore was it?  Or even just him and the baby, like it had been for 8 months.  They were so close to coming together now, weeks away, and it felt strange somehow, like they were all still strangers—John didn’t know their baby like Sherlock did, didn’t feel him fluttering about every day, or happily doing flips whenever Sherlock ate strawberry jam or played his violin.  But Sherlock didn’t really know him, either, had never met this little human being growing inside of him, had never seen him.  And John and Sherlock…it felt like they hardly knew each other anymore.  Where there had once been a strong partnership and no need for words, there was now hidden text messages from Lestrade and secret lunch dates and a whole symphony of music that told a story that John could never understand.
John draws a deep, calming breath, trying to bring his blood pressure down.  It doesn’t help.  “What did you need, then?  Hmm?  Nicotine patches?  Tea?  What?”
Beneath him, a crumpled, writhing heap on the floor, the combined feelings make John sob into his forearms.  He bites the soft skin of his wrists to try to distract him from Sherlock’s hand gliding slickly over his too-sensitive cock and Sherlock’s prick stretching the skin of his hole, pounding painfully into his swollen prostate.
While they stand there scowling at each other, John’s phone chirps once again.  As he takes it out one more time to look at it, he sees Mycroft sneer at him like he has won some unstated game between the two of them.
John had meant the words to hurt him, and Sherlock would be lying if he said that he didn’t accomplish his goal.  But despite that, he wouldn’t give John the satisfaction of seeing that he had succeeded.  “Even after all these years,” Sherlock told him, voice gone soft and deadly in the space between them, “I know that you think love is still a mystery to me.  But I’ve said it before and I will say it again—the chemistry of it is incredibly simple, and yet it’s so very destructive.  It can create a home or tear one apart.”
He sits back on his heels between Sherlock’s spread legs and wipes at the mess on his chin with his hand, cleaning it off.  Sherlock is lying limp and almost lifeless on the bed, the deep rise and fall of his chest the only movement of his body.  Sherlock’s cock is still hard and an angry red colour, shining brightly under the light of the room with semen and spit.  John strokes himself as he lets Sherlock recover, not sure how much longer he will be able to wait for the other male.
But, despite what many thought, the dead couldn’t wait forever, and Sherlock was not about to pass up the opportunity to run tests on the body when he had finally talked the widowed wife into letting him see the body.  Scotland Yard had been after an exhumation for months, and the wife would not budge.  Not until Sherlock had gotten a hold of her.
“You’ve come home smelling like cigarettes the last few times you’ve gone out with Mike,” she states, giving him a hard look.  “I thought they didn’t allow smoking in public places anymore.”
in his lap—one of his favourites.  They keep most of Sherlock’s belongings for this particular game over at Sherlock’s house, because there is less chance of discovery there.  Between the mother who abandoned him as a child and the alcoholic father who only comes home to sleep off his benders and pick a few fights, Sherlock practically lives alone most of the time.  But John couldn’t help buying a few purchases to keep at his home for times like this, or for when he wanted to take something to surprise Sherlock but didn’t have enough time to stop by the shops before meeting up with him.  Since Sherlock has found the book, John assumes that the boy has stumbled across his stash—although it is hidden well out of the way, deep in John’s side of the closet where Mary won’t find it—and that is what has brought this request on so suddenly.
“Well I’m not sick of you.”  He was being petulant and childish, he knew, but—really—he didn’t know what else he should say, what else he should do in this situation.  He could feel John slipping away from him, pulling and pushing against him and trying to break apart, trying to leave.  And,
A part of John doesn’t believe him, but he can see that Sherlock doesn’t want to be coddled right now so he reluctantly lets the subject go.  “Yeah, all right,” he says warily, giving the boy one more good looking over just to be sure there are no new marks or bruises.  When he is satisfied with Sherlock’s state he asks with a smile, “So what have you been doing with yourself on your impromptu holiday from school?”
Sherlock doesn’t notice, though.  “I seem to have misplaced the skull once again,” he explains.  He looks away from the microscope and down to a notebook that has been laid out on the desk beside him, jotting down a few quick notes in his jagged, spidery handwriting.
“I can’t believe I’m going to be a Nana,” Mrs. Hudson continued, milling about the room now and no doubt coming up with her own ideas for the nursery. “But, really, Sherlock, a child out of wedlock? What will the neighbors say? You’re always so indecent,” she teased, smiling at the two men who were both grinning like idiots.
He can see Sherlock wince at the memory, trying to hide in John’s chest, but there is no getting away from this, no running from it.  “John, I’m sorry,” Sherlock tells him again, voice wavering dangerously.  “I couldn’t help it.”
“Do you want Daddy to fold up a towel to put under your bottom, sweetheart?” John asks him as he settles down on the closed lid of the toilet and unbuttons the cuffs on his long sleeves, rolling them up to his elbows so that they don’t get wet.
“Yes,” Sherlock whispers back, lips pressed softly to John’s neck, breath hot and moist against the sensitive skin.  “I want that, too, John.  More than anything.”
“I have to go,” he said with a sigh, rubbing tiredly at his face again and switching off the phone, putting it back in his pocket.
“John,” Sherlock gasps, opening eyes full of wonder widely.  “John, I’m going to come.”  He’s never come with his cock untouched before.  “Can I?”
Sherlock bites his lip and nods, eyes slamming shut as he rolls his hips in a movement that takes John’s breath away.  He has to force himself not to come right then and there, with Sherlock riding him, all inhibitions gone, nothing but wild abandon as Sherlock finds a rhythm and sets the pace that he wants.  One of Sherlock’s hands slips in between their bodies and jerks at his cock while the other moves up his chest, touching himself all over, exploring what feels best for him.  His fingers find their way into his open mouth at one point and John sees his sinful tongue peek out to wet them.  They fall down, dripping saliva, to his chest, where he rubs and pinches at his nipples, making them wet and red and puffy.  It is all John can do not to lean forward and put his mouth on them after that.  John wants to touch him, so badly, but he doesn’t want to disturb the beautiful image of Sherlock taking his pleasure, losing control and finding what he needs in John.
He takes a moment to savour the sight of Sherlock like this, arse up and panting heavily for him.  With his free hand, he spreads Sherlock’s plump arse cheeks as well as he can while pressing Sherlock harder into his mattress, exposing the tight little pink pucker of his hole.  He bends forward to kiss the dimples on each side of Sherlock’s spine before letting his lips trail to the middle of Sherlock’s sacrum, right above the dip of his arse.  He lets spit pool in his mouth before releasing it in a gentle trickle, watching it slide down the valley of Sherlock’s arse, catching in the divot of his entrance.  He brings his finger round to rub at Sherlock’s hole, massaging the saliva in.  John won’t take him dry, he knows this, but he wants to let Sherlock feel him, wants to let Sherlock know that John can give him pain and pleasure, and it is completely John’s decision which he gets to have when John fucks him.  So he slips the tip of his index finger inside of Sherlock with only his spit to ease the way, and Sherlock bucks and groans beneath him.
“What?” John asks, sleepy and confused, because he thinks he may have missed the first part of Sherlock’s sentence, the comment is so randomly said.
said boy who has caused such an orgasm in the first place.  He leans against the bathroom door and tries to catch his breath, panting heavily.  Not for the first time he wonders just what in the hell Sherlock is doing to him.  Ever since he met the peculiar brunet he has felt like he has been caught up in a whirlwind that he did not choose and that he has no control over.  The teen seems to have taken over his life and John doesn’t even really know how it happened.
“Why not?” Sherlock asked petulantly. “I thought you would be glad that I’m eating anything at all.”
Sherlock grins at that.  “Yes, ‘nurturing’ would certainly be one of the words I would use.  You look after me, in every possible way,” he tells John.  “And I appreciate it.  So much.  Thank you, for everything.  Especially for being so understanding.”
Thankfully, though, Larry commentated for him.  “Your street is on the news,” he explained, not taking his eyes off of the screen.  “Looks like some poor sod left their stove on.  Blew up a whole building.”
“Good,” Sherlock said shortly, and proceeded to dig into his breakfast with a vigor that John still found entertaining.
“—But none of those things compare to how brilliant you are,” John finishes with a determined huff of breath and a steely set to his shoulders.  “How wonderful everything about you is.  How much you care about the things that you love.  How beautiful your mind is.”
John’s frown deepened at the childishness of his partner. “You hadn’t been eating well during your first trimester, and you need to make up for it. Now, eat it!”
Sherlock huffs out a petulant breath at John’s reprimand, pouting.  “Fine,” he sighs, and John decides to let the attitude go unpunished simply because he is tired and he has to start dinner.
“Sherlock, you…you…” his mouth opens and closes repeatedly, no sounds coming out.  He can’t believe what has just happened; he doesn’t even have words for how angry he is right now.
John has to know, though.  The thought is burning him up inside, eating away at all of his self-control.  “Are you fucking him?” he asks again, voice loud enough to be labelled as a shout, and he shakes the teen again.
There is a moment of silent pause on the other end of the line, where John can hear nothing.  Then, in a tone that sounds as if she is holding back a smile, “
“Like what?” Sherlock asks, and John can tell that he isn’t really interested in John’s question because his gaze has already wandered over to the microscope that is sitting on his desk.
This is what John wanted, what John had been hoping for.  Every so often, John knows that Sherlock sinks so far into his headspace that he loses all ability and even all desire to focus and anticipate anything outside of their scene, in their normal lives.  Sherlock doesn’t think, his mind isn’t constantly racing like normal, he isn’t worrying or deducing or rationalising every thought that pops into his head.
than just a student and a teacher, and the thought makes a barrage of butterflies erupt in his stomach.
“Sherlock, for the love of God, one of my patients vomited on me and I had to take the tube during rush hour,” he informs the bratty child who has locked himself in their bedroom, his voice hard and angry.  “This isn’t funny.  Come out of there so that I can change out of these clothes.  Now!” he shouts out, pounding on the closed door once with his fist.
The silence had taken on an eerie quality, sharp and deadly, and when Sherlock still would not answer John could not take it anymore.  “For fuck’s sake, Sherlock, say something, Goddamnit!  I deserve
“Are you going to listen to me if we do this, Sherlock?” John asks, meaning the spanking.  He’ll be damned if he is going to go through all of the trouble, just to have Sherlock bratty and pouty at the end of it all.
At that, Sherlock finally smiles up at John and it is that happy, bright smile that John knows is only reserved for him to see.  It lights up Sherlock’s whole face and makes him look younger, more innocent.  He lifts his head once more to steal a kiss from John and then wiggles out from under him, making his way off the bed and towards his bathroom with a shy grin and a small “Love you,” thrown John’s way.  It is the first time that the youth has said it to John since the night that he first told the older man, and it seems almost as if it is given as a sort of apology for the earlier conversation.  John silently boggles at the gesture, too stunned to say it back.  But Sherlock either doesn’t seem to mind or doesn’t notice.
He climbs the stairs wearily right after dinner, making his way to his bedroom.  He glances at the clock on his bedside table, and sees that it reads 8 pm.  He never goes to bed this early.  Usually, right about now, he’s having a shower—washing off the evidence of being with Sherlock before his wife lies down next to him in bed, close enough to tell if something is off.
The next hit is as unexpected as the first.  John brings his hand down so quickly after lifting it away from Sherlock’s skin that the brunet barely has time to steel himself against the blow.  John hits him in the exact same spot, harder than the first time, and the sting of it is incredible, a slow-fire burn that tingles painfully and spreads an uncomfortable warmth to the surrounding skin.
, he thinks to himself as he noses ticklishly against Sherlock’s skin, up and down his neck in a way that makes Sherlock squirm and protest.  Yet here is Sherlock, brilliantly intelligent, amazingly gorgeous, and, most importantly, completely his.  John thinks he might die from the joy and the love that he feels for Sherlock at this moment.  John loves everything about him.  All of the mad, contradictory, awkward, infuriating, annoying, and vulnerable things about him.  He is filled with so much love and affection, in fact, that he can’t help but drag Sherlock’s face to his by the boy’s neck and press their mouths together messily in order to try to show him.
John has to force himself to stop and take a deliberate step away from Sherlock.  They haven’t discussed telling people about their relationship, and he doesn’t want to embarrass Sherlock by coming across as the jealous, over-bearing lover.
“If you deserved it, I would,” John states matter-of-factly.  “I’d put you right over my knee and redden that bottom until you couldn’t walk properly.  That way everyone could tell what a naughty boy you are.”  John tries to hold back a smile as he sees how his words affect Sherlock.  The squirming, which reveals a tell-tale bulge in his lap, is all John needs to see to know that Sherlock likes the idea of what he is proposing very much.  They’ve never talked about impact play before, but this is probably as good a time as any to bring it up.
“Shit,” John mumbles as he tries to scramble out of Sherlock’s bed, but the boy grunts disapprovingly beside him and wraps a skinny arm tighter around John’s body, not allowing him up.  He knows Sherlock didn’t fall asleep; Sherlock never falls asleep after they are done.  If anything Sherlock was only in a light doze.  Most likely, though, he was just lying awake in bed next to John, so the man doesn’t feel bad about jostling him around.
Sighing heavily, he shoots off a quick text to his student, short and terse and inviting no in-depth response:
They are back home now, thankfully, and Sherlock can’t stop himself from pining John up against the closed door of their flat, kissing him desperately and rubbing up against him shamelessly.  John only smiles darkly against his mouth, letting Sherlock snog him breathless.
Sherlock doesn’t fight John, though.  He lets John care for him, in a way that he hasn’t ever let anyone before.  And Mycroft knows this.  It is the only reason why Mycroft let John take Sherlock away to London during the middle of the school year and why Mycroft allows John to continue his relationship with Sherlock, even though John could have gone to jail at the beginning of it because—despite the fact that Sherlock had been legal—John had been Sherlock’s teacher.  And it is why Mycroft implores him now.
When they’ve put all of Sherlock’s toys back where they belong, John sends Sherlock off to grab his paper and crayons, staying behind to move their coffee table out of the way so that a space is cleared in the centre of the room.  As Sherlock comes back and stands in front of John, the man looks down at the floor in front of his feet with his arms crossed.
“The Thompson twins didn’t like the fact that I exposed them cheating on a final so they decided to teach me a lesson.”
Sherlock makes a small keening noise as he slides slickly all the way down, almost too fast in his haste.  Judging by the look on his face and the small sounds coming from him, John’s cock finds the right spot inside of him almost immediately in this position that he loves.
“Shut up, Anderson!” John scowled at the man. He was not in the mood for the antics today. Not now, anyways.
John will fight with everything he has for Sherlock, until he’s won the war for them.  John will throw away everything he has for Sherlock, everything he is—his morals, his reason, his sense, his life, his marriage, his career.  He doesn’t care anymore.  He doesn’t care if he has nothing left of himself at the end, if there is nothing left to redeem himself with.  Sherlock is all that he needs, Sherlock’s love is the only redemption he craves.  Sherlock is everything.
“Christ,” John whispers, mesmerised by it.  He licks his lips, his mouth watering as he imagines the taste of Sherlock on his tongue.  But he wants to watch the boy so desperately.  “Stroke yourself, Sherlock, come on,” he urges.  “Push your foreskin up over the head and then back down, so that I can see the precome there, at the tip.”
“I just…ever since that night, when we were drunk, it’s all I’ve been thinking about and I’ve wanted to do it again, even though I know I shouldn’t.”   His words were coming out in a jumble of sounds that John could barely decipher.  “But I don’t want to force you to do it, like I did that night.  Just…just once?” he finished, lamely, dark eyes still locked onto John’s.
“American pop culture reference,” John explains, sighing tiredly.  When Sherlock just looks at him blankly, John snaps out, “Oh, I don’t even know why I bother!”
“That’s not the point, Sherlock,” John said, ignoring the picture in front of him for the moment to argue with Sherlock instead.
Just then, Mary’s aunt passes by him, helping her grandmother down the steps of the inn.  John licks his lips and smiles tightly at the women, waiting for them to exit before he goes inside.  “Yes, I received them,” he says flatly over the phone.
Sherlock gave a small nod of his head, in approval.  He brought his hands up to rest his fingers in a steeple in front of his mouth, in what John liked to teasingly call his ‘thinking face’.  “Callum Watson,” he repeated lowly, a far off look in his eyes.
“Goodnight, you beautiful thing,” John whispers to him as he leans down and presses a kiss to Sherlock’s forehead.
“It’s stupid and frivolous,” Sherlock stated simply, getting up from his seat with some difficulty and going to the shelves to search out another book.  “And I don’t see why I should be subjected to it!”
Sherlock makes sure to kiss each one of John’s knuckles before flipping his hand over to place a kiss on the centre of his palm.  John watches him silently, amazed that he was ever lucky enough to find the boy, and Sherlock uses both of his hands to spread John’s palm open, blunt fingers splayed apart so that Sherlock can see the appendage completely.
For a moment John is startled.  He believes that Sherlock is not bothered by the deep cicatrix on his shoulder—that Sherlock is fascinated by it—but for him to feel the same with all of John’s other scars (which are not as new, not as large, not as interesting) is somewhat surprising.  Sherlock’s warm little tongue finds its way back to John’s chest and runs along the length of the silvery scalpel scar there, leaving a wet trail behind.
She mumbles a “hello” as she passes him but then stops.  She sniffs the air around him delicately and grimaces.
But that doesn’t mean there is anything wrong with those methods.  And it doesn’t mean that they don’t work, for a time.
One autumn day, not long into the start of his university term, Sherlock stomps into Baker Street and slams the door, throwing his book bag onto the floor by the entryway.
Sherlock gives him a blank stare, as if confused by John’s question.  “No,” he states plainly.  “Why would I?  These people are stupid and senseless enough as it is; they don’t need to hide behind ignorance as well.  I feel that I’m providing a public service.  They should be thanking me for enlightening them to all of their faults.”
Sherlock was never really one for public displays of affection, and certainly not in Scotland Yard or Bart’s, where work was work and the consulting detective was very good at severing personal feelings from the job. But, here he was, tousling John’s short hair in front of at least a handful of other detectives and police officers, and letting his long fingers run down the side of John’s face as his large hand fell away.
Sherlock shuffles forward out of the kitchen slowly, like a skittish animal, eyes wide and wary.  He knows that John is upset and that he has done something wrong, but John also knows that Sherlock really can’t tell what that something is, for the life of him.  The mad genius just doesn’t think that way.  He doesn’t worry about messes and body parts in the microwave and safe chemical handling, no matter what headspace he is in.
“Yeah,” John chokes out, struggling up from his seat at the patio table next to Mr. Morstan.  “I just have…I, er…need to answer this,” he stammers as he puts some distance between himself and the rest of Mary’s family, all of them milling about outside happily.
As the day of his first prenatal checkup drew closer, Sherlock was interested to find that he had a particular bloating feeling in his abdomen, along with some mild to severe cramping.  He knew that the hCG was causing an increase of blood flow to his pelvic area, and that his kidneys were becoming more efficient at ridding his body of all of the waste that it didn’t want to keep around for any length of time.  Added to that the fact that his growing appendix was beginning to push down on the surrounding organs, especially the bladder, to accommodate its growing size and he was running to the bathroom more often than he had ever gone before in his life.  He tried to anticipate his bladder’s frequent need to relieve itself, and he would use the facilities right before he and John left Baker St to go to a case that Lestrade called them about, but, depending on the length of time they spent at the crime scene or at the morgue following the body, he would inevitably have to go again.
He let the poor man drift off to sleep in the chair beside his bed, occupying himself with tending to Callum and watching as John tossed and turned on the uncomfortable chair, looking for a better position.  It seemed that the blonde man found one when he finally leaned forward in the chair and rested his head on the foot of Sherlock’s bed, arms tucked under his cheek to pillow himself.
When he had divested Sherlock of the man’s shirt, he took a moment to be gentler with his trousers and pants, but soon enough John had the brunette man lying back on top of the covers of their bed, pale and panting and wonderfully naked beneath his hands.
For a moment John doesn’t know what he’s talking about.  He simply stares at Sherlock, frowning in confusion.
“You have the opportunity to do something great here,” Mycroft told him, staying seated in his chair and not even bothering to get up to continue his conversation with his brother.  “But you always manage to ruin things like this.”
“Are you that jealous, Donovan, that you will stop at nothing to have your moment in the spotlight, where I have been for years because of my talents?” he asked, leaning in closer to her and dropping his voice to a deep whisper. “Giving the reporters a quick story, getting paid for your services like a cheap whore. That’s all that you’re doing—selling my dignity, and John’s, and what little you have left to your own name.” He pulled away from her and sneered at her. “You disgust me,” he said venomously, his voice shaking with the restraint to not say more to her. “You are the worst kind of vermin on this earth and I’m sorry that my child will ever have to know people like you in his lifetime.”
John held out the heavier issue military gun to Sherlock solemnly.  “You keep the .45.  I’ll take the .22.”
“Well?” Lestrade asked him coming back over to stand next to the body beside him, voice hopeful.  “What were you able to find out about her?”
John frowns at that.  “It is real, Sherlock,” he states bluntly, upset that Sherlock could possibly think otherwise.  “My feelings for you are very real.  You know that, don’t you?”
John sighs and runs his clean hand through his messy hair, licking his lips.  “I’ve told you before, I’m not going to rush you,” he explains patiently.  He understands that Sherlock is young and impatient and self-conscious, but John won’t push him into doing something so drastic if he thinks Sherlock isn’t completely ready.  And John knows that he has to take it upon himself to know whether Sherlock is ready or not; if it were up to Sherlock, John is certain that they would have done it after their first kiss or something equally ridiculous.  Sherlock has no sense of self-preservation or control.  He is so much like a child in that respect, still.  “I want you to be comfortable and feel ready when we finally do it.  I’d wait forever for you.”
