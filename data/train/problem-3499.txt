The evening was already well advanced when Dean decided to turn off his computer and take a break from his essay. That last year at engineering degree was starting to give him a hard time and, frankly, he was looking forward to graduating and being hired somewhere. Hopefully, he would find a job in the same city and not have to look for another apartment.
An umpteenth sigh passed through the barrier of his lips when a rock-like music rose out of his pocket. Already worried that it was still his mother, Dean took out his cell phone. Unknown number. He raised an eyebrow and picked up.
"I sent you everything by e-mail, you must have received it." She said with malice. "But remember: keep it under your hat pretty boy. You don’t know me."
The hours elapsed deliciously between them as the episodes followed one another. Dean felt a little more filled with that warm feeling every time Castiel paid attention to him, whether it was when he rolled the blankets up on a piece of his bare skin or when he pressed a tender kiss down his neck just to feel it shivering. In those days, Dean wanted to do everything and do nothing at the same time. He felt powerful, important, alive.
This time Castiel tilted his head to the side before looking at the road, adopting a confused expression that was so familiar to him. He took the time to seek the answer in his mind to a question that should not have been so difficult, he knew it.
The arm that did not hold the blanket, for its part, went on a wander in search of a very different source of heat. When his fingers finally came into contact with warm and familiar skin in front of him, he smiled a little more. Castiel was sitting next to him, leaning on a pile of pillows against the headboard and staring at the computer between them. He was not much more dressed than Dean, but unlike his companion, he did not feel the need to cover up. Angels were not affected by temperature like humans. Also, Castiel was always temperate and, when Dean felt too chilly, he would snuggle to him in search of a human — or almost — radiator. Although, of course, Dean did not always wait to be cold to cuddle with Castiel.
"Even if they knew, handsome, they couldn’t. It’s against the law. Medical confidentiality and all that crap." She sighed before she came to sit on the chair beside him and put her feet on his bed.
Such events bound destinies for a long time when they were lived like this. However, although Dean cherished his friendship with Castiel more than anything, he had to face reality about a year earlier. Dean was not particularly known for his long introspections, but he was obliged to admit after several months of living together that his friendship with Castiel had perhaps turned into a more concrete and disabling feeling in his situation.
"You’re sulking." Castiel unnecessarily remarked as he was knocking down other cards on their improvised playground.
And without really understanding how, Dean nodded and lay down with Castiel. Docilely, he had let his companion draw him to himself until his ear rested against the scar of his chest. Some breathing later, Dean was able to discern the beats under the mutilated skin and the world stopped spinning. He remained there for hours, his eyes open but lost in nostalgia and stifling emotion.
"You still have your socks. Why didn’t you take them off first anyway?" He asked, tilting his head one more time to the side.
Castiel was still in hospital and in the recovery phase, but he was doing well and could be out very soon according to his doctors. He had seen the scar on his chest last week and he couldn’t help but cherish it. This mark was the sign that he had survived. The sign that he had the right to live longer and to continue to build his life away from the health problems that had accompanied him all his life.
Dean wrestled with how much snark to offer. On the one hand, he was glad Sam was living out his dream of being a lawyer. And also that Sam had graciously allowed Dean to move in when his own rental situation had become intolerable. There were only so many times a person could handle waking up to industrial metal at two in the morning, and when his lease was up, Dean hadn’t bothered applying for another one. Sam had taken pity on Dean, and as well as being able to sleep, he had a shorter commute to the coffee shop he worked at in downtown Sioux Falls.
Dean jerked awake and found he was hanging out of the side of his bed, only his tangled sheets stopping him from hitting the floor. Cas stood beside him, a perplexed look on his face as he held his hands out in case Dean did fall. Behind Cas was one of the many chairs from his own rooms dragged in to Dean’s, a book resting on its seat cushion. Morning sunlight streamed through the bedroom windows, the sky beyond a gorgeous blue—it was looking to be a nice day.
Dean nodded dumbly, their sibling roles reversed, and did as he was told. Minutes later, Sam reappeared with a tray loaded with a glass of water, some Tylenol and a fresh cup of the lemon and ginger tea he would always buy dry from the local farmer’s market that Dean secretly liked, but would never admit to liking.
“Are you going to eat me?” Dean looked around for something he could use as a weapon, there was nothing.
Looking thoughtful for a moment, Cas pursed his lips and looked over his shoulder, as if a bathroom would appear right behind him. He turned back to Dean. “The bath adjacent to my own rooms should be substantial enough.”
“Dude, you okay?” Sam’s called from the other side of Dean’s bedroom door. Soon to be Eileen’s studio.
Sam sat on the edge of Dean’s bed, face a picture of concern. “Do you think something at the apartment might have set you off? Gas or something?”
Cas looked at him with questioning eyes and Dean gently pulled Cas towards him, bringing their lips together. Aside from the tang of tomato and garlic, Cas tasted of cinnamon and smoke. The kiss sent heat through Dean, making his toes curl in his boots as Cas returned the press of their mouths. The kiss was over all too quickly and Dean wanted to press back in, but he held back as Cas met his gaze again.
Cas pulled away enough so that they could stare into each other’s eyes. “Okay, Dean, we’ll try.” He let go of Dean, only to pull Dean’s hand into his palm so he could lead him away from the party. Everyone else was either too tired or too buzzed to watch them go.
“Sorry,” Sam said, poking his head into the living room. “The shit hit the fan with one of our clients and I had to scramble some papers together.” He sniffed. “Is that lasagna?”
and a flower arranging class), and he untacked those, setting the colorfully topped pins ready in a bottom corner of the board, ready for fresh notices. Garth had always been clear with Dean that he wanted his coffee shop to be a central space for the community, serving them more than just fresh coffee, pastries and delicious cake.
Once Cas could stand again, they found Sam and Eileen, and Jack, and Eileen was introduced properly to Cas, Jack and Dean.
The group played every other Friday, alternating each session with either pizza or potluck. Dean preferred the pizza sessions, even though he was an excellent cook, on account of the fact that the same couldn’t be said for some of their other players. Dorothy kept coming up with concoctions that rarely waded into tasty, Kevin was obsessed with hot dogs, Charlie tried to over complicate things and usually ended up with a mess, Jo tended to just bring bar snacks (which was criminal when Dean considered the buffalo wings served at The Roadhouse, which Jo had easy access to), and Ash? Ash would only cook one thing and it was a tuna casserole of varying levels of tuna. Not the worst effort, but Dean was positive he’d found squid in one once.
Dean turned to the wall behind him, on the same side as the door he’d come in through. A wide selection of weapons were set upon hooks and other holders, arranged in groups of type and all easily accessible. “I can see that.”
Once Bobby was gone with the van, it was nearing three in the afternoon and Dean realized he was feeling hungry. He’d missed out on an offer of grabbing a burger in-between moving things around, because he’d been too excited about moving, but now he was regretting that choice.
Eyes going wide, Dean nodded dumbly as Cas made sure the shower door was closed. Then he stepped closer to Dean, pushing him under the water as he snaked a hand up and brought Dean’s mouth to his. The kiss sent a shiver of anticipation down Dean’s spine, making his dick throb. Kissing through the spray, Dean allowed himself to be pliant to Castiel’s touch as his hands stroked and caressed every available part of Dean. Smoothing down his arms, over his chest, across his buttocks, the touch slightly warmer than the shower.
“Give me that.” Sam put his beer down and leaned over Dean, snatching up the lease Cas had given Dean to take home. Dean watched Sam’s face as he read through the ten pages that Cas had given Dean and Dean couldn’t help smirk at the consternation on Sam’s face, the deeper he got into the lease. Every page just seemed to make Sam’s mouth twist and skin go just a shade paler.
He looked nothing like a guy who had freakishly long toe nails that needed such high level trimming as to warrant free rent. He looked like a handsome man sitting in a sunroom.
Bobby let out an unsurprised harrumph and made his way back to the main door to Dean’s rooms. “You know I don’t.”
They both struggled to meet each other’s eyes. Dean rubbed awkwardly at the back of his neck and tried to get his tongue to work along with the rest of his mouth and vocal cords, but all that came out was a “hrm” as he cleared his throat.
Garth clearly had a girlfriend (or boyfriend) he wasn’t telling anyone about, which was fine. Garth tended to be very private about his personal life, and Dean suspected he was dating someone with very changeable shift patterns, like a doctor, nurse or fire officer, someone like that. Or maybe someone who worked in a local restaurant. Or had kids and unreliable childcare—any number of dating possibilities that meant Garth might need to shift when he took time off from the shop.
He couldn’t imagine what kind of rift could have happened, though Dean remembered a time when Sam and their dad were at each other’s throats almost every night. Still, they talked happily enough in the present. Even hugged—something Dean couldn’t have imagined when Sam was 16.
A smile curled Cas’s lips and he looked away before looking back. “Again, Dean, I understand if you wish to leave. You are free to do so.”
“And what kind of name is Castiel Novak? Well, okay just Castiel? Sounds like some kind of angel,” Sam huffed. “Plus, why does he need you to cut his toenails?”
Once everything was in pieces and Dean’s toolbox was there, Bobby helped him put things back together. It was easier to hold the sides of the bed together when there were an extra pair of hands available. They worked quietly and quickly, but once his bed, chest of drawers and side table were put together, Dean felt dwarfed by the space around him. He eyed the doors to the closet in one corner and wondered how he’d ever have enough clothing to fill it.
Sam’s mouth opened, but no sound came out as he slowly slid down the wall, trying to make himself as small as possible.
“Like… bolt cutters? Maybe a saw? Sandpaper? It’s up to you, but I could try to get some surgical tools, though I’m not sure how I’d get those either.”
The two of them exchanged numbers and Dean got Cas a glass of water before heading off to Singer Salvage and Auto Repair. Calling Bobby in the car as he drove over, Bobby cursed a little down the line, but in the end said he was okay with Dean borrowing a few things—not that he knew quite what for.
Dean thought as the game started. Hauling himself out of the comfy couch, Dean left the sunroom and stalked back towards the kitchen, ready to help carry things if that was what it would take to have the chance to cuddle up to Cas like a normal boyfriend.
“Yeah. And it went a little sideways. I’m fine by the way, thanks for asking, just figured it was easier all round if I bought Bobby a few new things.”
“Best investment I’ve ever made,” Dean replied as he finally got his breathing under control. He straightened up and headed round to the passenger side of the van as Bobby took the driver’s seat.
Dean washed his hands and then set to work making hot drinks. Pulling out the grounds from the refrigerator, and getting the filters from a cupboard overhead, Dean tried to focus on the work problem that had made him push away from his workstation in the first place. But as he reached for the box of peppermint tea in the cupboard, he just couldn’t think about work.
It wasn’t a typical Friday night, Dean got that, but he liked to keep things quiet when Garth was away. There was a cooling slice of pizza on a paper plate beside him and a bottle of beer on the floor. Sam was still working away downstairs and Dean was considering an intervention of sorts. It was gone seven and Dean couldn’t see how working so late on a Friday was good for Sam, no matter how much he wanted to make partner before he was 35. Setting the journal down, a scrap of paper marking his place, Dean started to lift himself up when Sam loudly rapped at his door.
“Cas, I know when we first kissed, you didn’t want to go further, because I’d just found out about you. But I’m still here Cas,” Dean said in Cas’s ear, so he could hear him over the music.
“Fuck, Cas,” Dean moaned, body now warmed up after their trip outside. He wanted to push down on the press of Cas’s tongue, wanted to, but Cas’s strong hands held Dean in place.
“You got it in one!” Garth grinned and went over to the laptop he used to run music in the coffee shop and set up the quirky, and very British, BBC 6 Music radio station he usually left it on, playing over the internet.
“It’s amazing here! I didn’t realize how big it was on Halloween. But in the day, it’s breathtaking.” Eileen looked around, her gaze taking in everything. “Oh! Are you making pie, Dean? Sam always says you make the best pie.”
Dean sighed. “Yep. God, I hope a Russian mobster doesn’t outbid me again the next time we try to get ground cockatrice beak.”
“I have not celebrated this holiday in several decades. Are we doing the whole saying something we’re thankful for as part of the meal?” Cas asked in a low voice, mashing yams like his life depended on it, which considering how much Ellen liked her yams it may have.
They didn’t say a word as the two of them trooped out of the ensuite, Dean bringing the files and Dremel with him, dragging the extension cord. Once the filing was done, Dean would check over Cas’s cuticles, though perhaps soaking his feet again but in a bowl, and then moisturize and have Cas put on the fluffy socks Dean had picked up. As Cas got himself situated in his reading chair and Dean took a place on the stool beside it and patted his thigh, inviting Cas to put his leg on Dean’s leg. Cas obliged Dean and he picked up the grade of file that he figured would make the easiest work of Cas’s inhumanly strong nails.
by the Beastie Boys started playing. Dean found himself wishing it was his day to run the shop, so he could indulge in his classic rock habit—though, if he was giving the station its due, it did sometimes play stuff he liked too.
Thursday started much the same as Wednesday, only with the addition of it being a day Charlie was able to grace The Bunker with her presence. Once she was set up, Dean brought over a double espresso—apparently it was a serious morning—and he was about to leave her to whatever work she already had her nose buried in, the top of her head only just visible above the lid of her laptop, when she reached out and grabbed Dean by the wrist.
“No worries, Garth.” Dean didn’t look up now, wondering why Garth always had to make such a big deal out of Dean covering him. It wasn’t as if Dean was inexperienced in taking on The Bunker by himself. The previous winter, there’d been a whole week where Garth was ill with the flu or something and Dean had been left in charge. He’d managed to not only serve customers and keep the rest of their team motivated, he’d managed to sort out orders from their suppliers as well. But Garth’s absences once a month, over three days, and always weekends, made perfect sense to Dean.
With practiced motions, Dean shaped the burger patties having added the new spice and herb mix the recipe suggested. Normally he was a salt and pepper kind of burger guy, but cooking was offering Dean his only chance to shake things up a bit as he dealt with stay at home life. He tried not to think of what other culinary adventures he might need to think of, especially if they had issues restocking.
“Sure. See you… later,” Cas replied, eyes closing as he relaxed in the chair. He was like a cat or a lizard, the way he was enjoying the sun.
“Merry Christmas, Cas,” Dean declared. He was about to say something else, but Cas pulled Dean into his arms and proceeded to kiss all thoughts and air away.
On the way back to The Ddraig in Dean’s car, the back piled high with decorations along with the trunk, Sam kept talking about the food Eileen had been busy cooking for the party (
“And he’s like, not going to eat you, right?” Sam asked for what must have been the ninth time since Halloween and the big dragon reveal.
An umpteenth silence answered his question and, frankly, Dean himself did not know why he had asked it. Maybe he was holding on to a ghost, a hopeless, senseless hope of finding something that once belonged to Sam. But what else did he have to lose now?
Time seemed suspended between them in this bubble of happiness that constituted their room, slowed down. Dean sighed quietly, softly sliding towards that version of him that only very few people on this Earth had the right to see. The relaxed and gentle, funny Dean. A little needy, but nevertheless light and easy… The Dean is the exact opposite of this emotionless killing machine that he had to interpret too often to survive. Here, the only weapon he needed was the puppy eyes that he sometimes threw at Castiel to order him another head massage among his tangled hair.
"A card game?" Dean suggested, turning an angelic face to Castiel again. "Do you know how to play poker?"
Dean raised an eyebrow before turning completely to Castiel, sitting cross-legged on the couch. He remained silent for a moment before taking a deep breath and finally grabbing the cards that Castiel handed him.
Castiel cut his thoughts short to get progressively closer to Dean, sinking into the blankets too. He turned on the mattress to face him, placing a warm hand on one of his cheeks and feeling Dean’s zygomatic tends more into a soft smile.
"Are you cold?" Castiel inquired, raising a curious eyebrow while the computer played a series, forgotten between them.
He didn’t know what to think of this situation, it was too surreal. Was he angry with this man? No, not really. Sad? Maybe, but nothing new. Curious? Certainly. There were so many questions that now turned in his mind, almost stunning him. Never before had he heard a similar story and, yes, he was driven to the unknown by the despair of that mourn which he had never ended. But to hell with it, he
"I know." He sighed again before returning to his plate. "I’m sorry, you’re right. I can’t ask you anything like that anyway, it was selfish of me."
, with a little soft smile. Dean retreated to his comfort nest, his hair pointing in all directions as he tightened his favorite blanket around his shoulders.
"Yes." Castiel said. "I’m about a two-hour drive from Des Moines. I don’t know if you live nearby, but-
Castiel sighed and a fine smile appeared on his relaxed face. It was their game, their way of saying "
When Sam and Dean officially moved into the bunker, it was in the early fall. Even in Kansas, the wind was cold and biting at that time of year and, although he would never admit it even on his deathbed, Dean had always been of a chilly nature. In the innumerable motels they had traveled throughout their lives, Dean systematically arranged to keep several layers of clothing on him or to ask for extra blankets at the reception. When they had established their base at the bunker and each had inherited a room, it was not long for Dean before finding slippers, a warm bathrobe and the thickest blankets of their fortress.
"We do one last game before we go to sleep?" Castiel asked, putting the cards together and mixing them again.
Castiel smiled while feeling Dean’s hand gently caressing his bare and finely muscled belly, his blue eyes leaving the screen to come and rest on Dean’s loving face. He loved to see this expression so open and relaxed on his partner’s face and made it a point to make it appear as often as possible. Since the beginning of fall, he and Dean had multiplied the afternoons in bed to laze undisturbed in the warmth of their room. It was needless to say that Castiel had never experienced such a situation, it seemed to him to be a purely human activity to which he would have lent no use not so long before. But now that he shared his daily life and more with Dean, he had quickly learned to cherish those kinds of shared moments together. It was beyond words. Dean called it "
He did not know how long he kept this tape in his car, but now he had had time to learn each song by heart. As the words passed, so did the years, and soon Castiel and the Winchesters put whole apocalypses behind them, one after the other. Everything changed and yet everything remained deliciously similar in the small details.
"Okay, okay. That’s fine with me. But we still need to spice things up or poker is a lot less fun." He pretended to think for a moment under Castiel’s innocent gaze before resuming. "For lack of something better... we can consider a strip poker?"
"But I can’t guarantee you anything, Clarence." Meg told him while sighing. "You don’t access their organ donor files like that, but… I may have a couple of people I could contact. But it’s just between us."
"But it’s quite uneven." Castiel replied, pouting. "You already know the rules, I’ll be naked in less than ten minutes."
"I have another idea. For the last match, I’ll give you an extra joker." Castiel began, feeling a knot in his stomach as to the turn the events would soon take.
"Do we have any bottles left from Friday?" Dean asked as his eyes swept over the contents of the closet.
feeling spreading through his chest when he understood what it was. The first time he had read it on the tape player of his old Lincoln Continental, he had spent most of the time searching for meaning in the lyrics.
The ground seemed to collapse under his feet as Dean looked for a way out. The truth is, he didn’t know how to do it without breaking everything around him. His days passed one after the other in a sickly similarity: work, eat, reassure, start again. He no longer had his stupid little brother to listen to his stories, no one to share his Friday night evenings with and who would be there to support him in any situation. He had his friends left, but, honestly, no one could understand him like Sam did for 23 years.
Castiel smiled even more and shrugged, returning to his storage. He took the time to rinse a knife before answering.
But he fell anyway when Castiel gently pushed him onto the sofa so that he lay down under him. Later that night he fell again into this large bed in Castiel's room, his lips unable to leave the body of the other as if he desired to make every inch of him feel loved. He fell and fell and fell all night long, tumbling down into the most exquisite and liberating of the falls as a smile split their two faces in the frenzy of the moment. Dean kept falling, but he didn’t do it alone, clinging to the one thing he had never hoped for in recent years and that he could finally touch with his fingers now.
was more complicated to understand and even after the third listening, Castiel was still not sure if he had grasped the main message. When he picked
Following this, only the noise of the cutlery against the ceramics as well as the television journalist was heard in the hospital room. Meg didn’t move, didn’t open her mouth either, while each of them thought about their commitments in this story.
Castiel shook his head on the passenger seat as they drove towards the bunker, returning from a shopping spree at the local apothecary to restock their reserve.
Sam still loved to run in the morning to enjoy the silence and fresh air brought by dawn. Jack was expanding his collection of magnets while Sam and Dean were always careful to bring some back from all over the country. Dean was still the fastest when it came to dismantling and cleaning a weapon, but also to improvising meals when there were only three aliments left in the fridge. Castiel, on the other hand, became unbeatable on rock bands thanks to his now husband. Dean could literally spend hours playing music on his phone while questioning him about the title and the band and the Winchester had to admit that Castiel was starting to get good at it.
"One more thing." She said." I’ll try everything, but if I don’t find anything, you have to promise me you won’t try to get a name anymore. Do we have a deal?"
Another kiss, on one of the marks this time, as if to contradict himself. An umpteenth happy sigh. Castiel did not complain about this brief change of rules.
Castiel rolled his eyes and began dealing the cards in silence, ignoring Dean’s bad loser attitude and his naked and shivering body before him for a moment. He briefly thought about an alternative before biting his inner cheek with apprehension considering to the direction in which his thoughts were going. Maybe these two sherry cups finally got to his brain... Castiel had never held his liquor very well. However, he was the first to be surprised — and mortified — by the forbidden words that came out of his mouth:
The latter did not even jump, probably having heard him arrive without showing it. He put away the spatula he had in his hand before responding to Dean with a smile on his face.
Finally, he was unable to remain angry with Castiel for having beaten him at poker, just as he was unable to detach himself from him that night. As the sun’s rays filtered through the closed shutters of Castiel’s room, Dean gently caressed his lover’s face in the hollow of the pillow with a new, fascinated tenderness. He barely waited until Castiel opened his eyes to steal another kiss before whispering against his lips.
It was during a cold November evening, while he was bundled up in a plaid on his couch in front of a TV show, that Castiel’s cellphone rang. It was not something particularly unusual, but the late hour of the evening immediately gave this call something special. When he reached out to his phone, he could see Meg’s name on the screen.
Castiel took a shaky breath before gently biting his lip while his friend welcomed his words with contemplative silence. Television continued to gossip in the background, but Castiel no longer heard it, lost in his thoughts.
In April and several appointments later, however, Dean understood that it was not really a fraternal connection he shared with Castiel. He learned to dwell more on the looks and gestures exchanged. Everything was crazy, insane, but once again, everything had always been crazy between them, and this from the first day.
Castiel suddenly seemed nervous in front of him, which did not help Dean relax. He frowned slightly, uncertain, while Castiel laid all the cards on the table.
When Dean opened his eyes that he did not remember closing, he watched his computer continue broadcasting
Still smiling, Dean straightened up to grab the cup of hot chocolate he had left to cool down until then. He took the drink with a comfortable sigh and wrapped his fingers around the still warm ceramic. A marshmallow floated lazily in the center of the chocolate and Dean melted a little more in the mattress when the liquid touched his lips. He knew that in normal times and with anyone else at his side, he would disown hot chocolate for something stronger. Probably coffee, or whiskey. Or both at the same time. But now, he was too deeply immersed in his trance of total relaxation to care about it and this chocolate was the most delicious there was right now. He let the sweet taste come and tease his taste buds before swallowing it with delight, feeling the still burning liquid slipping down his throat.
July and August passed at an alarming speed as each of the two men discovered another facet of the other. Castiel had met Dean’s parents and Dean had not seen his mother so happy for a long time now. However, the one-year date of Sam’s accident was fast approaching and Dean could not ignore the weight it added to his shoulders. Little by little, Sam’s heart had become Castiel’s one in his eyes and his boyfriend was gradually filling the void that he felt deep inside him, but this dammed month of September was now taunting him every day on the calendar.
His friend had answered so confidently that Dean was caught off guard for a moment before he could recover. Castiel agreed with his idea, really?
It’s been three years since he shared a place with his best friend Castiel and things suited him perfectly like they were. Castiel had already been in the active life for two years, working as a heritage officer at the Kansas City Museum, but sharing the rent of their apartment was a relief for everyone. Moreover, they had now settled into a comfortable routine that gave rhythm to their lives in the most pleasant way. Most often, they would invite friends on Friday nights and spend an evening together over a beer. Saturday was reserved for a video game night where Castiel often ended up winning and bequeathing his dishes tour of the week to Dean. Sunday night was a mix of movies and popcorn while Tuesday was a board game night. On Wednesdays, finally, they always ordered from the Japanese caterer on the corner of the street and zapped between Netflix and YouTube until they were too tired to put away their plates and left them on the coffee table in the living room.
Dean’s heart skipped a beat and his muscles began to move, pushing him to almost scream on the phone.
They both knew what that meant. Castiel had insisted on registering on a site that put organ donor families and recipients in contact. However, the process was complex and if the family of his donor did not post any message on this site, then Castiel would have no chance to get in touch with them. Yet he was almost obsessed with this situation. He had this need, no, this irrepressible
Castiel frowned and tilted his head slightly to the side, as was always the case when a situation confused him somehow.
"I know." Castiel replied, abashed while planting his fork in the mashed peas. "But perhaps they will make an exception? I just want to know them and thank them for the gesture of their loved one".
He did not need to look in the direction of Castiel to know that he had rolled his eyes heavily. Dean reinstalled himself in the sofa and placed the sherry bottle and the tumblers on the coffee table. He began his explanation while serving the first cup.
"I.... I need you to close your eyes. It has to be a surprise or I.... Anyway. Close your eyes please." Castiel stuttered in front of him.
"I’m going to leave you, I’m sorry I interfered in your life like this." Castiel apologized again. "I will not call this number again, I promise. I hope everything will be all right for your family, sincerely."
"No, wait!" Realizing that Castiel had still not hung up, Dean quieted down, a shiver in his voice. "I don’t even know how you found this number, but… Well, it doesn’t matter. You’re from Waterloo? Iowa?
Castiel swallowed. He had no good answer to this question. Was he himself certain of what he was doing? Not at all. But he needed Dean to play tonight, because right now, he felt brave.
" without really expressing it… They had developed it at the turn of a drink-fueled evening that had undeniably ended with very few clothes, but their trick had remained and everything was a pretext to reuse it now. It was simple and stupid and simply stupid, everything they needed to know and say what they thought about each other. One said a perfectly obvious fact by beginning his sentence with "
Fortunately for him, the opportunity had almost presented itself when Castiel came to live with them. Definitely, of course.
"Living a difficult situation and I would only remind them of their loss, yes, I know." Castiel mumbled without being able to help it. "But… Maybe that they also would like to know that the death of their loved one helped other people cope. It’s possible Meg. And maybe they just don’t know how to contact me or-"
"It’s an insult to call Sherry alcohol when you’re under 40, but… fine." Dean said while grabbing the said bottle before heading out in search of tumblers.
As these words left his mouth, Dean felt his heart speed up in his chest. Of course, he had already seen Castiel half-naked many times before, and although he had always appreciated what he saw there, he had to admit that this context would be otherwise amusing. Nevertheless, Castiel remained forbidden and inexpressive so long before him that Dean quickly lost his smile.
The man on the other side of the phone seemed to take a breath before resuming in an equally nervous tone.
. It was the right word to define Castiel. Everything was easy with him, obvious and sweet. He never judged him, no matter what topic of conversation he decided to share with him. Castiel listened and supported and Dean had not felt so free and understood since at least 6 months now. One evening, he even wildly wondered if Sam’s heart had not completely taken possession of Castiel to make him this radiant and exceptional person. Until then, Dean had never known anyone but his brother who could read him like an open book.
Dean took a short moment to think before his gaze landed on the drawer in which all their board games rested. Immediately, his brain set out to lead him towards an idea that would gradually stretch a malicious smile on his face. Of course, he had long established that he could not reveal his feelings to Castiel, but that did not mean that he could not take advantage of them here and there when the opportunity presented itself.
was alive and well, determined not to disappear. Not this time. When Dean began to cry silently, Castiel simply hugged him harder to comfort him, without a word. This was so precious to him. It quickly became their favorite position, Dean kissing the scar whenever he could.
Dean stretched out at his desk before he got up. He quietly shut off his laptop and put down the glasses he used for work on top, massaging the back of his neck gently. When he turned off the light from his desk, his room was plunged into darkness and, as if to confirm the late hour, his belly began to grumble softly.
"No, Clarence, squat" Meg shook her head. "And even if they did, you know very well that you will not be able to contact them. The site does not allow any personal information or too intimate exchanges between families."
The first time Dean caught him doing this, it was mostly because he went to get something to eat for a night snack before getting in the mood to watch a movie with Castiel. Finding him nowhere, he ended up finding him in the garage, his relaxed face only illuminated by a warm light. He opened the opposite door as gently as possible before slipping into the car in his pajamas.
“Hold it,” she said firmly, tearing her eyes away from the screen. “How’d the apartment viewing go?”
“Well, I’m sorry. I underestimated you.” Cas shrugged and turned away. “If you want to leave, leave, but I’m still going to make breakfast and fresh coffee.”
Dean turned a dial, and a jet of steam wooshed out of the steamer on the espresso machine. He glanced up at Charlie and saw her thoughtfully smile as she considered her answer.
Castiel had given Dean the down-low on all things werewolf that he could recall. Silver. Phases of the moon. Feeding on hearts. No cure that he knew of. Dean had talked him through it with understanding patience, while making sure Dean drank a cup of tea to help soothe his nerves (Dean would have preferred something stronger). The only reassurance Dean had was that Garth liked chaining himself up in his basement, which indicated he didn’t go around and try devouring human hearts on the regular.
“No, but… This one isn’t like the one we used to bring Jack back, there shouldn’t be anything dangerous that can go wrong.” Dean shrugged. “At least not massively so.”
“Dean, you are welcome to have guests whenever you want. Though yes, it’s probably best you don’t tell Sam about the ghost, for that matter, or that I am a dragon.”
, Dean kept repeating to himself until he reached the ballroom. When he did, he saw Cas through the open doors and in the dimming daylight, Dean could see the markings on the floor that he had missed when he’d last been here at night. And then his vision focused and he could see Jack too, standing in front of Cas as they conversed.
That gave Dean pause. Jack hadn’t been living for thirty years. Everyone from his life had, from what Dean had found through research, moved on or died. There was no one left in Sioux Falls who remembered the young man who disappeared one night, only to be found dead the following morning. The only record of Jack that was official said officially he was dead. Despite all of this, Dean was pretty sure that between them, they could help Jack build some semblance of an existence again.
Dean didn’t say no as he got up to get back to work, but he wondered if Cas would be okay with something like that. He knew Charlie would sell tickets and stuff. There’d be money to go back to Cas. Though as Dean thought about cutting those wicked toenails of Castiel’s, Dean wondered what else the guy did for money. The Ddraig hotel was in good enough shape, bar the east wing.
“How to bring a ghost back from the dead, and free them and me from the hotel. I can’t leave,” Cas said simply, arms wide.
“Hey, Cas, I’m back!” Dean called through the rooms, a canvas bag slung over his right shoulder, its contents clinking together with each step he took.
If there was a list of things Dean didn’t really expect to be getting phone calls about from Sam, this was one of them. “That was the first time you got drunk. And if I remember correctly, I had to hold your hair out of the way while you spent a good half hour throwing chunks over the back porch.”
“Look, clearly, you’re… concerned,” Cas hazarded, hands up in a placating gesture. “But, Dean, please. I can explain or at least apologize.”
“How is it no one can find this place, it’s huge!” Sam exclaimed as Dean pulled up outside The Ddraig in what had become his usual parking spot.
Leaving the huge space behind, Dean found himself in a bar and lounge area that looked like it was waiting for a jazz band to descend and then somehow wound his way into the kitchens. The kitchens were immense, with gleaming steel worktops and enough utensils to get just about any kitchen job imaginable done. Towards the back, something glinted as he approached and he came to a stop beside a counter that was loaded up with an espresso machine that looked to be original Italian, 1920’s build with a huge lever jutting out of one side. It was an antique and near enough mint condition, with some signs in a waste tray that it was still regularly used. A modern bean grinder, not unlike the one from The Bunker, stood beside it. The coffee machine alone was nearly enough to convince Dean that he should come to live at this weird ass place with its handsome owner.
Sam was already home, which was a surprise when Dean parked up outside the house. He headed on in, and was greeted by a brief mumble from somewhere on the living room couch.
“You said that already,” Dean said, rolling his eyes. He led the way from the drive up to the main doors and opened them.
It was difficult for Dean to sit down and work through the day, working in AutoCAD and taking calls, checking Kanbans and advising on technical documentation, with all that was going on in the world outside. It was also tough to work when your normally reasonable roommate was acting more coolly than usual.
“There’s a laundry room that will be available for your use. It is the hotel’s own room, but I have some more, uh, standard sized machines for domestic use.”
“Hello, is there anybody out there?” Dean called, voice echoing again. He looked up to the ceiling and its surprisingly high beams worked in repainted steel. The red paint gleamed in the afternoon light, like the sticky crimson of fresh blood and Dean looked away, blinking hard. The beams above creaked and his breath fogged in front of him, the temperature of the room suddenly dropping.
As he hoped, these words seemed to unlock something in Castiel’s mind, for his friend straightened himself up with new interest before nodding.
Castiel did not pay attention to the comment and watched Dean pour the last shot with special attention. He seemed to be much more focused than he wanted to appear until then, and Dean restrained a smile. Castiel had always been a competitor.
The month of February began on another encounter at the park this time, at Des Moines. The winter was still rough and persistent this year, so they had decided to go and enjoy a hot chocolate near the pond. Dean hadn’t told his parents about it, not yet, but this meeting with Castiel did him as much good as the first. When he returned home, he found himself feeling much lighter than before.
were Dean’s two favorite songs, he remembered hearing him tell Sam about it during an innocent fight in the Impala.
"You must be able to find an address, right? There must be even a name or maybe a phone number. I mean, if it’s a medical secret then the information has to be somewhere. If I could just put my finger on a semblance of something, it would be…" He moistened his lips, thinking. " It would be incredible."
The sun was certainly declining outside to give way to the long night of winter, but both dared hardly look at the hour for fear of breaking this tacit agreement of total tranquility. Of course, Dean got up at one point to quickly go to cook something before coming back to eat it in bed, and Castiel took the opportunity to take out the controllers of the game console located in Dean’s room after they had finished their series. Castiel won the game, as he always did, because he seemed to be just good at everything he did, and Dean mumbled for form in the face of his traditional forfeit of the loser before indulging in a back massage for his companion.
Castiel knew she was right, but the excitement was in his chest. However, he took the time to thank Meg warmly and invite her to dinner next week before hanging up. A few minutes later he had his eyes fixed on a brand new e-mail in his inbox. Castiel took a great inspiration. He had waited so long for this moment that, now that he was faced with a fait accompli, he was almost afraid to go for it.
At these words Castiel’s face slumped slightly. He remained silent for a moment, seeking the right answer to this question. Meanwhile, he felt his heart squeeze in his chest and the blood it sent to his brain was enough to formulate his next words.
, he couldn’t help but think of Dean over and over again. Finally, everything reminded him of Dean in these songs, because these tunes were each part of his own identity. Arriving at
When Castiel let out a hoarse chuckle before drawing him closer to himself, Dean promised to do everything to hear this sound every morning now. They were going to need more games night from now on…
It has been more than 3 months since he entered the list of organ recipients to replace his heart tired by illness. Unfortunately, he had inherited a heart malformation from birth and had survived to the age of 28 without being too disabled, but the congenital heart disease had caught up with him midyear. After a whole series of tests and a permanent hospitalization, the doctors had been very clear: either he had a heart transplant or he had only a few months left to live.
Dean shook his head and smiled. He knew that such a dynamic between them would never have been possible before, even in his wildest dreams. Dean had resigned to his unspoken feelings by persuading himself for years that he and Castiel were a relationship doomed to failure and suffering. That they were too different and that their lives would never allow them any semblance of normalcy or comfort. That he shouldn’t be distracted when he was trying to save the world or taking care of his little brother. That it just wouldn’t work, because it wasn’t reciprocal and he’d make a fool of himself, he’d lose his best friend, he’d still hurt someone he cared about.
"Okay, but only on one condition." He said, raising his eyebrows. "We don’t bet money. I already have to pay Charlie back because of our last night together."
"Oh, uh, yes! Hello, sir, uh, Dean?" An uncertain voice immediately answered with a short breath and tangled words.
rose in his ears, so that he thought he had fallen into a pool while he was not paying attention to his steps. Besides, Dean wasn’t even sure where he was, now standing still in the middle of the street. Only a deep and sizzling voice gradually emerged from his torpor.
“That’s mine!” Ash called from his corner of the table, favorite dice already picked out of his dice box and lined up in front of him. Dean doled out Ash’s pizza to him and then checked through with the rest of the orders. Charlie and Dorothy had a Thai Chicken Pizza to share with some garlic bread, Kevin had a Big Kahuna, Jo a classic cheese and tomato sauce and Dean had a All Meat, which he would not be telling Sam about on Saturday.
Dean considered the concept. “Okay that does sound remotely interesting and not a complete snooze fest.”
“This is some collection,” Charlie said a little breathily. “There, uh, anything you’re hoping to find out in particular?”
Dean settled on his knees in front of Cas’s feat. “I think she was going to find out something was going on at some point. She’s not stupid.”
Trying a door, Dean found it opened easily to him and so he peeked his head inside the room. It was beautifully furnished with a dark wood bed that had pillars on all corners and a sweeping cream canopy above. A chaise lounge dominated one part of the room and the dressers and vanity looked like they would be thousands at auction. Dean stepped back and closed the door. He tried a few more rooms on the second floor and found them similarly decorated. He slowly made his way to the central sweeping staircase and climbed to the next floor.
Dean’s fingers started to cramp under the weight of the supplies he’d brought up with him and he suddenly remembered he was standing in the middle of Cas’s rooms, staring at everything and saying nothing.
“Now is perfect,” Cas replied, slipping the blanket from his lap and setting it to one side of the lounge. He stood and his impossible toenails stretched on ahead of his frame. “This way,” he said and shuffled onwards.
“And speaking of Bobby, he said you bought him a bunch of new tools for his workshop?” Sam raised an eyebrow.
“Sorry,” Cas apologized and worked to disentangle them, carefully removing his halo and then helping Dean to remove his horns.
“As you can see, the growth is quite… extensive,” Castiel said, shifting uncomfortably under Dean’s gaze. The baggy green cargo shorts he wore cinching a little with the movement.
“You see, further into the east wing, there are energies that I can’t quite control or fathom. In fact, I can’t actually go quite near them. That I believe is where the spell was cast, or they tried to cast it. Jack was likely a sacrifice to power the spell.”
Heading over to the plug, Dean pulled it and set it aside, allowing the near sudless cool water to drain away. As the bath emptied, Dean pulled out the tools he needed. He washed his hands at the sink and then snapped on a pair of the medical gloves he’d bought. And then he pulled on a pair of goggles he’d stowed away in his boxes from Sam’s.
“Well, I have to at least make you some soup.” Sam smiled and got off the bed. “Try to rest, okay? And drink some tea.” He headed on out and left Dean to his thoughts.
Dean laughed and took a deep breath. “Because I’ve never told Sam that I can see dead people. One other person in the whole wide world knows… my friend, Charlie. And that’s because I helped her with a haunting once. Well, as far as I could, which wasn’t much.”
Dean looked to Cas, who was giving him the full concerned look, all frowns and pursed lips. It was cute.
The following Monday evening, Charlie was driven to The Ddraig to commence Operation Scan All The Things. As Dean pulled up in his parking space, Charlie was already ogling the building beyond the car, mouth hanging ajar.
Dean set the scissors down and stood to face Cas. “The clippers and scissors I bought can’t seem to do anything.”
Dean looked at the pancakes, as if seeing them for the first time, and hungrily cut off a mouthful and popped it in his mouth. He chewed and swallowed. “You could always warm them up for me again,” Dean teased.
Dean glanced to Cas and met his concerned gaze. “Well it had his shape and hair… But it had big sharp teeth and claws. And it snarled… growled… like a really angry dog.”
It took another hour for Sam to calm down, robbing them of valuable setting up time. But Dean took it as a good sign when Sam offered to take part in the scanning exercise when he was free next. Eventually, the three of them left the east wing, the wards adjusted correctly, and shut Jack away safely, locking the doors behind them, making sure the warning notices were visible. Cas even found some barriers to set up in front of the doors as well.
Dean huffed out a breath and picked up a towel to dry his hands with. “Of course I do… But, just so you know, I think I won our bet.”
“Okay, the wager: if there’s nothing going on, you have to pick out Mom and Dad’s Christmas presents this year,” Dean offered.
But Dean looked up into Cas’s eyes, their masks and goggles removed now that there weren’t bits of nail going everywhere. The air between them felt full with potential.
And then there was Jack. The arrival of griffin feathers meant that they were finally ready to try and bring Jack back to the land of the living full time. Then stage two would be finishing getting the components necessary to get Cas and Jack free of The Ddraig.
Dean and Cas approached Sam, Jack at their side, and looked down on his shaking form. For a moment, Dean almost wished Sam had passed out, but he hadn’t.
Dean shrugged and finished booting up the coffee shop’s cash register, as they prepped for Tuesday. It was a technological wonder as far as Dean was concerned, running off an Android tablet, with a cash draw underneath and a small white boxy card reader that connected wirelessly. The cash register the shop had originally had been prone to periods of rebellion and just not working. A longtime coffee fiend and frequent customer, Charlie, had helped kit them out with the new system after witnessing a particularly horrific register malfunction. She’d also been the one to take Dean to the local emergency room.
“Dean, wonderful to hear from ye. So, ready to schedule your next session?” Rowena asked, Scottish twang renewed just that bit more, likely from spending time with family during her vacation.
“I’m sure you know already, but Doctor McLeod is waiting on you to make an appointment.” Sam looked up from his drink. “She left me a message to remind you.”
Once pizza, sodas, plates and napkins were all doled out, Charlie called everyone to attention and the session began.
Dean nodded and settled against the cushions. It was almost six and he’d been working since seven that morning.
Dean thumped the grounds into an empty bean bag, ready to package up once full and set aside for customers to take home for their yards. “The tour? Uh, right. Yeah, not my kind of place. It was more pricey than I’d been expecting. And up too many stairs.”
… Mind picking over the puzzle, Dean thought about the shop tools he’d be using to sort out the furniture for his new rooms. It was potentially very dangerous. But it had a chance of working.
Dean and Cas were still together. Cas had not reopened the hotel as a regular venue, but was hosting regular LARP events with Charlie and Dean’s help.
The east wing was silent and a little colder than the rest of The Ddraig as Dean slipped inside it. It was gone midnight and technically Christmas day already, but Dean wanted to make sure that Jack and Cas got their main present from Dean before they woke up in the morning. Heading to the old ballroom, which Cas was already planning on refurbishing in the near future, Dean hefted the bag he had slung over his shoulder and the lamp he carried on his other side. It was weighed down with spell ingredients and the props he needed for the spell that would finally unbind Cas and Jack from the hotel.
There was a buzzing sound and Cas palmed his own cell, quickly looking at the screen and then stuffing it back in the pocket of his ripped jeans. “Holler when it’s ready,” he added and got to his feet, heading for his room. The mug of peppermint tea left on the table untouched.
He swiped down the listings page on his tablet, looking for something that met his criteria. It wasn’t like he was being too picky, but cost and distance was an issue. He could drive, but he didn’t exactly enjoy sitting in traffic.
Monday arrived, Dean was meant to have the day off anyway, with Aaron doing handover with Garth, and Dean went to Bobby’s to borrow a van to haul his things in. Sam had reluctantly gone into the office, and it had taken Dean insisting he didn’t need any help and that he’d call later to reassure Sam.
“Dunno, maybe like some kind of demon, if you’re going as an angel? Not that I have any idea what a demon would like.”
Garth didn’t say anything, he just stood there in shock. Dean hurt to see the look on Garth’s face and decided to steer him to one of the nearby tables and sit him down in a seat. Then he fixed two chai lattes and slices of banana bread and set them down in front of Garth and joined him.
Now that Dean had Cas’s foot in his lap and was cradling it as he held it in place to let him work, Dean’s brain started to catch up with not only how bizarre his first evening in his new place was turning out to be and at the same time how holding Cas’s foot as he was the closest he’d gotten to another human being in months. Swallowing, Dean tried to focus on the task at hand—fulfilling his end of the contract he’d signed. So, he took the file and started on Cas’s right big toe, pushing the file along the length of nail, from the edge to the center of the nail. Push and lift. Push and lift. Over and over.
“Cas, I can’t cut your nails with regular stuff. They’re too hard. I’d start small! Like the bolt cutters.” Dean was beginning to appreciate why no regular podiatrist was able to help Cas in the past. And, Dean considered, he’d just been soaking his toes for an age and the longer they left it, the drier the nails would become again. If they didn’t get this done soon, they’d have to soak his nails again.
They kept chanting for what seemed like hours, but it was likely only minutes as time seemed to be sucked out of the room. Without warning, the lights in the bathroom exploded, and the water in the bath foamed and boiled and then as if being raised on a dais beneath the surface, Jack emerged, naked and shivering and very real.
“Nah, it’s fine. Not like we haven’t watched this before.” Sam nervously ran his thumb down the side of his bottle. “But yeah, maybe we should pause.”
Dean stowed his cell and shrugged. “I’m still going to check it out.” He stood up and stretched. Through the store’s front windows he could see the first real wave of customers arriving. “Welp. Back to the grindstone.”
As he stood in the main entrance, Dean felt a weariness that made moving his legs difficult. Before he knew what was happening, Cas had swept him into a bridal carry and proceeded to take him upstairs. Dean protested at first, but then felt himself comforted and lulled by the heat radiating from Cas.
Dean sighed and pointed ahead of them to the gates outside the van and hotel that was looming in the distance. “Here.”
There were two questions there, Dean knew it. He was asking if he liked the building and Cas. “I’ve got a good feeling about this, Bobby. I can’t quite explain it.”
But just as he was wondering if he’d walked into yet another ghostly encounter, an unfamiliar man’s voice called, “In here.”
Sometime later, Dean was vaguely aware of Cas moving around him and cleaning them up, before drawing Dean underneath his comforter. Dean was finally pulled into something resembling sleep.
Heading on into the hotel, the sky darkening, Dean checked the sunroom and found that Castiel had moved from there. Unsure quite where he might be and realizing he should probably make sure he had Cas’s cell number going forwards, Dean ventured back up to the third floor and checked out the rooms on that floor. Heading past his own, he soon found a room with the distant tinkling of music, some classical piano that he couldn’t put a name to. Dean knocked on what looked like the door to the rooms.
Though as he looked at the space, Dean did consider one thing he might treat himself to, now that he had more privacy. But he would need to sort out address changes for all his accounts first. Forgetting unpacking, Dean settled down with his tablet, sat in the middle of the open living room floor, cell beside him, and started changing his personal information as needed.
“The Ddraig, huh?” Dean rubbed nervously at the back of his neck. “Well, if you’ll have me—can I call you Cas?”
Sam had noticed his little game a long time ago already, but never said anything. Despite his tough guy looks that Dean wanted to give himself for a reason that escaped him, Sam knew that his brother had a weakness, especially for the rare days when their daily life turned out to be calm and domestic. While he was ruthless with the monsters who gave them a hard time, Dean was also the most inclined to make hot chocolates in front of a wood fire while watching a nice movie. Sam called it his "
"I am sorry." Castiel went on after a long silence. "I’ve taken the liberty of contacting you, but I can assure you that I don’t want to cause you any more trouble than that." He seemed to be searching for his words for a moment." I know I could never thank Samuel for his gesture, but... your brother saved my life. I just wanted to let you know how grateful I was, even though I couldn’t replace what you lost. If there’s anything I can do to help, it would be my pleasure. However, I also understand that you would never want to hear from me again... But I can assure you that I will take care of his heart. Samuel really did a lot of good in my life and with my loved ones."
September passed by in a bitter sweet atmosphere that neither Dean nor Castiel regretted sharing together. One evening in October, bundled up under the duvet to fight off a new winter, Dean could not take his eyes off the blue gaze smiling back. He thought of what his last months had been, what he had lost, but also what he had found. In front of him, Castiel squeezed the hand on his chest while breathing the same warm air as his partner. Their heart rate was calm and painless.
Quickly, he arrived in the kitchen and began searching in the cupboard just below the central island.
Finally, in the midst of all this change, Castiel also continued to slip behind the wheel of his Continental just to play the famous mixtape in the small cockpit. On those evenings, he would go to the garage plunged into darkness, only turn on the lights on the ceiling of his car and throw his head back on the driver’s seat to let himself be enveloped by the musical notes.
Meg was definitely his favorite nurse and it seemed to be mutual. She had told him one day that she always arranged to be assigned to his room, for she liked their conversations, and Castiel could only agree with her. Despite her bad girl tease, Meg was now a good friend, always listening and present to support him in addition to being a good caregiver. Her honesty had helped Castiel to carry on in his fight against the disease and during his remission. They sometimes spent long minutes discussing their respective lives before Meg’s pager rang and she was called away. In addition, she sometimes smuggled him chocolate bars to make up for the hospital food and Castiel calling it "a survival aid".
Currently, Dean was buried under several fluffy blankets in his memory foam bed. He stretched out slowly, feeling each of his muscles deliciously distends before falling back against his pillows in the most satisfied sigh. Despite his blanket fortress and the heating on in his room, Dean was practically naked in his bed, wearing only a large pair of boxers with pizza patterns that he only wore when he wanted to relax. The underwear was so loose that he hardly felt it around his waist. On the other hand, feeling the cotton of the blankets on his freshly washed skin had the talent of putting him in a good mood.
"Yes… But there are necessarily registers somewhere, a way to find a contact." Suddenly, something seemed to light up in his eyes and he turned his hopeful face towards Meg.
After these gentle words, Dean had to take a few minutes during which he tapped on his steering wheel to calm down.
Dean laughs softly at the mention of that stupid bet that Castiel had royally lost while he was reinstalling himself on the couch with the card game in hand.
"It’s pretty simple once you understand the basics!" Dean assured, already bending over to open the drawer with his plan still in mind. "I can teach you if you want, it’ll save you from getting ripped off by Gabriel the next time we play."
He himself was curled up and kept staring at his cards with a sullen expression, alcohol already making him spin his head to make matters worse.
Castiel closed his mouth in a discreet snap before taking his friend’s last words into consideration. Finally, he nodded again.
Castiel feverishly licked his lower lip before shaking his head imperceptibly, the face so devastated by the fear of rejection at the moment that Dean felt like he had fallen into his worst nightmare. He could not bear such an expression on Castiel’s face, Cas who had kissed him, Cas who was afraid of his reaction, Cas who cared for him right now. Castiel who loved him.
… lost in a video game on purpose to massage you." Dean suddenly said before he came to kiss Cas’s upper back.
"Because it is unfair that I survived among so many others." He said." My donor had relatives, maybe siblings, a dog, friends and all lost something too valuable to be replaced in this car accident. Yet that’s how organ donation works. Someone dies and allows others to live. But I know that, if I had died on that operating table, my parents would have liked to know through whom I would have continued to live. I feel
Seeing the wings of an angel was a true honor considering how intimate the gesture was for the angel concerned. Castiel literally laid bare before him, revealing his purest primal form and putting his life in his hands. The wings of an angel were so fragile, so sensitive and yet so powerful and majestic. Even among them, it was not common for this heavenly race to show their wings, let alone in a moment as intimate as the one Castiel and Dean were living. But the months had accumulated between them and from this love a solid trust was born. Dean would never thank his angel enough for offering him such proof of love, but he could nevertheless try to love him so much in return.
Dean raised an eyebrow. Had he given his phone number to anyone recently? Not to his knowledge in any case, he very rarely went outside the garage in which he worked. Curious, Dean turned into a quiet street to concentrate on his interlocutor.
Neither of them had spoken any more unless it was Dean humming his favorite music. Soon it became a ritual taking place at least once a week. Sometimes Dean would bring food supplies even though the angel didn’t need to eat, and other times it was up to Castiel to bring blankets to compensate for the broken heater in the car. When Dean decided that Castiel knew enough about Led Zeppelin classics, he made him a second tape on Metallica. It took Castiel a month to hold on to the essentials before Dean came into the car one night with another tape labeled "
At these words, Castiel laughs softly and Dean already knew his answer by the expression of his face alone.
"Okay, because I have something for you!" Meg hummed. "The info cost me at least three boxes of chocolate and the promise of a date to the shady guy in the operating room. You know, the one who keeps wearing Britney Spears t-shirts under his blouses? He’d be doing karaoke parties with the girl from the fourth floor that I wouldn’t even be surprised at-
Meg’s research had still not yielded anything even a month after Castiel left the hospital. Although he was now alone again in his large apartment, there was something exhilarating about being able to live normally as if he had not nearly died a few months ago. Finding a job at the florist in his town had been the first step in his new life as he slowly resumed a normal social life with his friends and family.
"Hey." Meg called him through the phone, her voice softer. "I know it’s important to you, but… take the time to assimilate the information, okay? You don’t have to contact them tonight."
"I watch the bees." He finally said with a small happy smile. He turned his attention to Dean. "Or I listen to your prayers."
The line remained silent and Dean frowned. He could hear a breath at the other end of the line, so he tried again.
The hardest part was seeing his friends and family coming to see him every day with a darker face as nothing moved on the side of the organ center. Castiel was aware that he was not a priority among the thousands of people in need of a heart in the United States, but he tried to remain optimistic for the people he loved. His fight was rewarded a few days ago when he was told he had found a match donor.
"Anyway, the thing is, you have to listen to Led Zepp, they’re the best in classic rock, believe me." Dean resumed as he turned down the alley to the bunker garage.
He savored every trembling muscle under his fingers, every scar that he began to know by heart, and paid special attention to these two reddish marks among the scapula reminiscent of deep cuts. But Dean knew these marks well, and he loved them even more since he knew how to exploit them. Sitting softly on Castiel’s buttocks, he pressed his fingers against the spine of his angel before slowly pulling up each vertebra. He massaged, caressed, brushed and massaged again until he felt Castiel trembling beneath him. Dean leaned a little further forward, so that his breath now came to warm the skin of his lover’s back. He smiles, concentrating his movements on the shoulder blades, teasing the hollows and bumps of his companion’s anatomy while detailing his pale, muscular skin.
When he met the Winchesters, however, Castiel discovered another music field. Although Sam was—as usual—curious about several musical genres, Dean was constantly immersed in rock music. He knew the subject so well that Castiel was always relatively impressed when his friend quoted him bands and all their members with obvious ease. Finally, when Castiel lost his wings and was forced to travel by car, he began to enjoy sitting in the Impala and listening to Dean talk about his favorite bands while a cassette played in the audio player.
And it was as simple as that. It has now been seven years since Dean and Castiel met, they had found each other at school and had not really left each other since. As a result, Castiel was obviously able to read Dean like an open book and the opposite was also true. They were confidants for each other, brothers almost, pillars on which to lean when everything went too fast around them. Dean and Castiel had actually painted the town red in high school before going to enter together into the terrifying life of a student or, for Castiel, an active worker. Above all, they had always been there for each other. Dean had been more than present during the divorce of Castiel’s parents and the ensuing family debacle, he had even taken his friend out of a very bad drug past for which Castiel would be forever grateful. Castiel, meanwhile, had supported Dean when Mary Winchester had lost her battle against a disease and John spent about most of his time at the bar, drowning his grief while his sons remained helpless at home. Dean no longer counted the number of times Castiel had welcomed him and Sam into his home simply to give them a break from everything else.
For medical reasons, Castiel and his family weren’t allowed to know who the donor was. It was obviously not the priority in the eyes of all, but Castiel had insisted on knowing more and he had simply been informed that a heart had become available following a fatal road accident in the nearby city. There was something macabre about celebrating someone’s death, but that person had been generous enough to help other souls struggling to live and he could only salute that gesture.
"I hope so!" Meg said, setting up his lunch tray with a small smile." But at least it has the merit of giving you a little adventurous side. Did I ever tell you I have a thing for guys with chest scars?"
Castiel started to mutter, as if he was suddenly deeply embarrassed by this phone call. Dean was convinced that he had to send back the image of a man ravaged by grief right now, his arms swaying and his gaze lost.
Castiel felt his hands become sweaty as his gaze slid over the address and telephone number of Dean Winchester. A heavy silence filled his apartment, Castiel still unable to detach his gaze from this decisive email.
"Wow." Dean said, raising his eyebrows, truly surprised. "And what did I do to deserve one of my favorite comfort foods tonight?"
His feet—which had kept cooling on contact with the bunker tiles despite his wool slippers—were now pleasantly warm at the end of the bed, sending delightful waves of tingling in his legs. He felt like he was floating in a cloud of comfort and, for God’s sake, he would like to feel that way for the rest of his life. Dean barely wanted to get up to get food or go to the bathroom. If he had to die here, then so be it. He told himself that
"No!" The man quickly added. "No, I don’t want to sell you anything. I…" Another inspiration."My name is Castiel Novak. I live in Waterloo. I know this is going to sound weird, but… I received your brother Samuel’s heart."
They ate in a good mood in front of a horror film so lame that Dean was seized with a hysterical laugher in the middle and nearly choked on a macaroni. For dessert, Dean got up and came back with two ice creams — vanilla for him and a much more sophisticated taste for Castiel like wild mango or whatever — to finish their meal. Surprisingly, Dean was not particularly tired despite his long day of work and considering the energy that Castiel still had in front of the film, neither was his friend. When the credits began to scroll on the screen, Dean sighed.
"Yeah, yeah, if you want. Five jokers each then, but don’t expect that to save you from not exposing those gorgeous leopard panties that I gave you for Thanksgiving last year." Dean replied with a mocking smile.
Despite his best efforts not to hurt his best friend, June began with a considerable argument. Castiel felt rightfully unfairly rejected, and Dean could not bring himself to pronounce the words that burned his throat. However, neither of them expressed themselves more when Castiel, after a final overwhelming exclamation, brutally kissed Dean’s lips. The latter greeted him with a sob before deepening their kiss. No, Dean did not only love that beating heart in his chest… He had fallen in love with so much more.
As a result, the words were lost, the gestures became feverish to make room only for the language of the bodies. Although Dean was woefully bad at expressing his emotions, he certainly knew how to show them and Castiel undeniably liked to receive. Nevertheless, of all the means they used to warm up on the cold autumn days, this was their favorite.
". But Castiel had finally come to the point by asking him if he could tell him about Sam and things had been done naturally. It was as if someone had opened the floodgates and quickly, Dean was unable to stop the incessant flow of words about his little brother. He told him the most important thing, from his childhood memories to that weird tic that Sam had every time he was upset.
He was currently distracted by the television channels in his room — the afternoon programs were truly deplorable — when the nurse came in to serve him his meal.
Surprisingly, it snatched a small laugh from Dean who barely recognized the sound of his voice. He hadn’t laughed that easily in weeks now.
Finally, he found the courage to click on the screen. His eyes quickly passed over her friend’s introductory text before fixating on a name written in bold as well as a lot of personal information listed just below. Reading these few lines, Castiel felt his heart racing again.
"Uh… I can’t say I do, no. It always seemed rather complicated to me when I saw you playing that during parties." Castiel replied slowly, his blue and curious eyes fixed on Dean.
Castiel hummed gently to the attention before extending an arm towards Dean. He embraced him slowly before drawing Dean to him and share another kiss, deeper this time. Dean let out an amused exclamation in the embrace and then retreated after a while. He smiled.
If that was all it cost him to learn more about rock 'n' roll, then Castiel had all the time in the world ahead of him. He was in no hurry to outstripping his teacher in this matter, not this time. He was going to let himself be carried away.
That’s it. The family of his donor was only a phone call away and he could finally thank the entourage of his savior. However, with this crucial information came a bitter feeling that Castiel had not apprehended. He remained all night pacing in his living room, his eyes regularly returning to the phone number taunting him from the screen of his computer.
"Would you like to put your head against my chest?" Castiel once proposed as they both prepare to go to bed.
"I’m sorry, we don’t really know each other. I am aware that my call may be unwelcome, in fact I hesitated for a long time before contacting you." The man stuttered.
Okay, maybe he had a thing for Castiel. A little bit. Okay, good time! He wasn’t even sure it was mutual, so he certainly wasn’t going to waste 7 years of friendship on a simple… feeling? For God’s sake, he had spent whole evenings struggling with this very question, thinking about it again and again until he got migraines, and he had finally come to the conclusion that if he did not have absolute confirmation of the reciprocity of his feelings, then he wouldn’t try anything. It may have been giving up without a fight, but whatever he had was too valuable to make decisions lightly. It was not even certain that Castiel liked men! Well, yes, perhaps, his friend qualified himself as"pansexual". What Dean always said to him was that it was just "
"I don’t pray to you all the time Cas." Dean huffed, trying to hide the redness of his cheeks with a certain frustration.
Three months. Three long months since his little brother had disappeared in a car accident, leaving him and their parents in the grip of nameless sadness. He could barely breathe most of the time thinking of that youthful face he would never see again.
? He tightened his grip around his roommate’s body, he needed to hold on to something so he wouldn’t fall right away.
Their first encounter had definitely been strange and completely atypical. They had arranged to meet in a café halfway between their two cities, and despite a tense start, Dean and Castiel had talking much of the afternoon. Dean had been biting his tongue all along so he wouldn’t ask the fateful question of "
"Des Moines, yeah." Dean replied, stunned. How did this guy know so much about Sam, he thought that the organ donation was anonymous? "Would you be available to meet in the week?"
"I’m not- Damn it, seriously!" Dean suddenly exclaimed in a raging gesture as Castiel won that round again." Dude, I don’t have any more clothes to take anything off!"
"Well, the rules are simple. If you lose a turn in poker, you take off one piece of clothing and the last one naked wins." He grabbed another tumbler. "However... Since I am an extremely nice and magnanimous teacher, we will have three jokers each." Dean pointed to the liquor bottle. "Therefore, if you lose a match, you have the right to choose to drink a shot bottom up rather than take off clothes. We’ll have three jokers each for the whole night. Is that all right, Mr. Know-it-all?"
Castiel pushed him with his foot from the other end of the couch and kept his mouth shut on the fact that he, at least, was not knowingly buying Scooby-Doo underwear. Nevertheless, he let go of the remark and straightened himself up on the couch as Dean began to deal the cards. Judging by the smile on Dean’s face, he was more than confident.
knack for poker. Dean continued to bitch in his corner while he was already in his underwear and socks on the couch, his five empty sherry glasses on the coffee table while three on Castiel’s side were still full. Not to mention the fact that Castiel was still perfectly dressed and even sprawled out among the blankets in a casual attitude that only offended Dean more.
Mary managed to keep her head above water half the time, calling him every day to hear from him, to which Dean responded with as many reassuring words as he could. Everyone knew that most of them sounded empty, but they could only
However, although he had so far moderated those moments of lounging to prevent Sam from laughing at him anymore, Dean had always dreamed of being able to spend whole days literally doing nothing. Don’t get him wrong, he was a man of action and he needed his quota of monsters and adventure within a week. Nevertheless, he certainly wouldn’t say no to weekends holed up in the bunker to worry about nothing but eating and sleeping from time to time.
March hosted their first meeting in a private place. Dean had taken care to clean up the mess from top to bottom before Castiel rang his doorbell and, seeing the huge bouquet of flowers that his friend had brought him, an easy smile spread over his face.
"Oh, I see. Well, the human is infinitely grateful to you for honoring him with your luminous presence." Dean answered with exaggeration, rolling his eyes and pretending to be annoyed.
"If you keep going, we both know perfectly well that we will never finish the episode…" Dean growled gently while leaning into the embrace.
"If the three jokers are only usable for the whole evening, then three is not enough." Castiel protested. "I really don’t know anything about it! Allow us at least five? Please?" He added with a more than pronounced pleading expression that came straight to Dean’s heart.
Dean nodded stupidly, no matter how Castiel couldn’t see him. He felt that the sky had just fallen on his head, he felt completely disoriented. Of course Sammy was a hero, the rest of humanity didn’t even know how lucky they were to be around him. Dean knew that Sam had donated his organs, he had even given everything he could, because he was like that. But knowing that the heart was beating in
" and Castiel loved the sound of that sentence, because he already knew that he wanted to explore every possible and imaginable existence with Dean until the end of his very long life. It would probably be a bit silly if he confessed it aloud to his companion, but he would not hesitate to let Dean know it just to see him blush and mumble two or three swear words under his breath before kissing him gently on the lips.
