The jacket Dean is showing looks to be a combination of polyester and wool, colored a deep and spirited solid red. His pants are the same shade, with black shoes and a collared black shirt. Castiel vows green is still Dean's best color, but this red–
The event looks smaller than the one Castiel attended before, with only two brands featured on the signage. He pushes his way through the throngs of people, glancing around in every direction for a glimpse of Dean.
He's beginning to feel desperate, having searched the majority of the hall, when he overhears a nearby conversation.
“Well,” he continues, nerves acting up even though he's fairly confident, “I hope you don't mind that I took the liberty of... having it altered.”
“Amara,” Castiel repeats, disliking the way it rolls off his tongue. “Why does that sound familiar?”
one causes a tinge of pink to break out across the bridge of Dean's nose, clashing with his freckles, and he ducks his head before Sam notices. He pushes his half-finished cup of coffee in Cas's direction, hoping the beverage will occupy the angel's mouth long enough for Dean's feelings to chill the fuck out.
“Can't believe you thought I wanted to cheat on her,” Dean grumbles, rolling his eyes. “Is that why you didn't call?”
–!” cuts off when Castiel swallows the sound with his mouth, impatient and greedy. But if they don't slow down, Cas is going to crush them both flat against the wall.  Pain is beginning to claw at Dean's back. So Dean's hands carefully tug Cas's face away from his, groaning when Cas sucks a spot of skin between his teeth, but he successfully separates them after another lengthy moment. Dean allows his hands to trail down, ghosting over Cas's throat to rest on the lapels of his jacket.
“Please, Dean, do be quiet,” Castiel orders as they approach the Versace designated rooms, and Dean shuts his mouth. “Rowena may have asked, but in the end, I agreed. I never do
“Oops, probably shouldn't leave this to leak on the old wood, huh?” Dean apologizes, stowing it back in the fridge. “Yeah, I don't drink much. After my dad's cancer, I kinda stayed away. I'll have wine every now and then, but since Dad basically drank himself to death...”
But he approaches too closely, and, like a scared deer, Cas flees the kitchen and bunker alike, front door slamming behind him.
“Congratulations, Mr. Novak, your blood pressure has gone down,” Dr. Alder praises during his next appointment. “I think your vacation did wonders for your health.”
“And after I left my number in your car, too.” Dean sits up suddenly. “Unless... you never found it?”
“You don't...” Dean's voice cracks when he realizes what Castiel is saying. “Not at all?” he asks, like he's waiting for Castiel to say
“Err.” Castiel pulls two beers out of the fridge and offers one to Dean, who accepts it distractedly. “I bought the home, actually.”
Dean sighs. “Long story short? My ex-girlfriend. I told you about her, too, right? She's a nasty piece of work. Needed to get away, so I came down here to live with Bobby. He's not really my uncle, more like a family friend, but he offered a room and a steady job doing what I love, couldn't say no to that.”
“Erm, well, my last relationship... The man I was dating, turns out he only wanted me to elevate his career. Once he had that, he left.”
Rowena whispers a few things in Dean's ear that have the man blushing scarlet, and Meg paws for one final attempt at Castiel's ass, and then, they're off. They sit in awkward silence for a handful of minutes, Dean's rock music playing, both seemingly unsure of what to say.
Castiel is still on his leather couch in the living room of his penthouse, completely and utterly alone.
Their date to Moody Gardens is one of Castiel's favorites. He enjoys the aquarium pyramid, particularly the penguin area, while Dean prefers the sharks and big fish. In the rainforest pyramid, Dean's allergies begin acting up, but Castiel's heart melts a little when Dean insists he can manage so that they can finish the exhibit for Castiel's benefit. They relax a bit in Palm Beach, but there are too many children running around and too many judgmental parents for Castiel's hands to wander as much as they'd like, so they leave after only twenty minutes and buy a second round of tickets for the aquarium.
Castiel quirks a brow. “You okay there?” he asks, encouraged by Dean's reaction. His plan would implode if Dean had lost interest.
to stop!” He eases Castiel off his lap, movements sluggish as he comes out of a haze. “I'm not saying that wasn't hot as fuck, but...
Dean looks like he wants to ask something, but Castiel can feel the coffee running down his skin, so he unthinkingly unbuttons his shirt and begins dabbing at his chest. Dean never formulates his question, and Castiel glances back up expectantly, only to find Dean ogling his bare chest.
“I never touched you.” Dean's tone sounds calm, but Castiel recognizes the hint of wariness underneath the words.
Gabriel grins. “I wanted to surprise you. Figured since you can't pass the holidays like we normally would, I'd spend a few extra days down here. Gotta say, wasn't expecting to find you hungover and skipping work.”
“Of course,” he concurs, slightly out of breath as well. “We should continue elsewhere. Your place? Or mine?” He lowers his hips enough to create the smallest amount of friction on Dean's legs.
The streets all bear boring but efficient names, either using the letters of the alphabet or plain numbers. But for all of their simplicity, the further they drive, the more confusing the streets become.
Castiel frowns. “You picked her up from here and went out for the weekend. You were...” He blushes and prays Dean can't see it in the glow of fireworks. “You were wearing a suit.”
“I gotta be up at five,” Dean breaks the silence, “but you can sleep in if you want. I'll leave your ticket on the dresser.”
He hastily bids Dean goodnight, but before he drives off, Castiel leans out the window and asks, “Is it too forward of me to call you tomorrow? I, erm, still have your number.”
Dean asks for the keys then, so Castiel goes inside to sit in the waiting room. Jo is sitting behind the counter, and she grins toothily at him when he enters. Unsure of what to make of that, Castiel studiously ignores her and pulls out his phone. Candy Crush, while completely childish and silly, is also mildly addicting, and it helps stave off the urge to check his stocks. Not that he can; Gabriel locked those too, promising to keep a watchful eye.
Castiel can't bring himself to eat a grease pan, though, so he orders the blackened mahi-mahi sandwich and ignores Dean's judgmental eyebrow. Dean gets some famous shrimp po-boy and a platter of shrimp kisses, whatever those are. They tack on a few drinks as well. Castiel notices that Dean once again avoids alcohol but doesn't make a comment.
“Don't ask me,” Jo says, as if she can read his mind. “It's probably that 'just-got-fucked-senseless' hair you're sporting.”
Castiel scoffs. “I don't see either of those things happening any time soon. I doubt Dean ever wants to see me again after tonight.”
Under Castiel's curious gaze, Dean turns away, embarrassed. He licks his lips. “Amara... she used to try and control me... like that.”
He's coerced into trying a corner of Dean's po-boy, which is admittedly very tasty, and in exchange, he cuts out a piece of his fish sandwich, which Deans happily samples.
Dean chokes, but Castiel only huffs fondly, leading the way up the stairs to the apartment. The two of them crowd into the tiny bathroom, and Dean pulls out the kit from underneath the sink.
“You're very good at it,” Castiel says over his steak. He likes the restaurant, feeling very at home surrounded by all of the elegance. He can almost imagine this is somewhere back home, and Dean is– He pauses in his fantasy. Dean is
“Dean, we can still cancel,” he hears Rowena whisper kindly, and it's the first time Castiel has heard her address the man by his given name.
Castiel grows more embarrassed by the minute. “When you took care of the car bill,” he explains. “You paid for it and then left your number. I thought it was a bribe for...”
Rowena's roof is still the best spot, and knowing his brother, Castiel suspects Gabe has climbed straight into her lap by now, much like Castiel did to Dean only a year ago. So much has changed since then. Dean is only a few classes away from his certification, and Bobby has already begun promoting Dean's restoration work online, featuring a spread on Castiel's recently renovated Lincoln Continental, as well as an article on Dean's prized baby.
Dean runs a hand through his hair with a sigh. “I'm sorry, too, Cas. I shouldn't have assumed you would stay here just because we were together. And...” He shuffles back and forth. “I shouldn't have accused you of trying to seduce me into moving,” he adds, flushing. “I should have known you wouldn't do something like that, even without knowing of your awful ex. I jumped to conclusions based on past experience.”
Castiel keeps the Scottish Fold in his peripherals as it hisses while he lowers himself into the chair. “I see.” He reaches for the mug, and Fergus the cat screeches and swipes his paw, yellow eyes flashing dangerously.
“Come on, cutie pie,” Dean murmurs, delighting in the rosy color of Castiel's cheeks as he presses his hips against the angel's. Cas's labored breathing, the shy weight of his hand on Dean's shoulder, throws all of Dean's caution and dignity to the far corners of his mind.
“Hey hey, pipe down, you ain't a tiger,” a gruff voice rebukes from beyond the ceiling. Fergus keeps on making noise, however, and a moment later, a head pops through where the stairs end.
“My condolences,” Castiel offers, still unaware of social conventions and what he should or should not be saying.
“Yes,” Cas agrees, his lips brushing Dean's, “I suppose that's fair.” He draws back when Dean pushes closer, smirking when the hunter whines with need. Castiel's voice is low and demanding when he says, “Now how about you blow me a kiss, goldfish?”
“Dude, not my fault you didn't see me,” Dean says, uncaring. He starts to get up, but Fergus gives a particularly alarming screech. “Damn it, Crowley, give me a moment, will you?” The cat narrows its eyes at Dean but relents, allowing the man to stand fully. To Castiel's surprise, Dean then scoops up the Scottish Fold into his arms and heads toward the stairs.
Christmas is only two weeks away, and though Castiel longs to return to Chicago and spend time with his family, Gabriel convinces him to stay put, conscientious of their deal. They reach a compromise, with Gabe agreeing to fly out for a few days and take gifts back to Chicago with him for their mother, sisters, and brothers. Gabe seems stoked by the idea of Christmas on the beach, though Castiel assures him it's not nearly as exciting as it sounds.
Dean cants his head back when their lips slide together, and Castiel doesn't know if he's trying to get away or if it was just a reaction, but he keeps a hand on the back of Dean's neck, gentle enough for Dean to break if he really wants to, but firm enough to keep him in place. Castiel pulls him even closer, backing himself into the counter. Blessedly, Dean follows, his free hand carefully skimming Castiel's revealed skin to settle on his hip bone. Dean's touch is just as searing as he remembers, angling his face to slot their mouths together more deeply. Dean presses his entire weight against Castiel, and Castiel doesn't even care that the drawer handle is digging into his back. He melts into the contact when Dean licks at the seam of his lips.
, fuck–Cas,” Dean groans, pushing lightly at his chest. “We gotta–” He stutters when Castiel licks a stripe up behind his ear. “–we gotta slow down!”
They don't always go out, though. Sometimes, they hang out in MacLeod's after hours, tucked into opposite ends of the couch in the secondhand section, knees folded and socked feet touching in the middle while they read individual books. Castiel pours through Vonnegut novels while Dean studies his mechanical engineering textbook, having explained he takes one online course a semester for certification in automotive restoration. It's quiet and not at all sexy, but it's an easy silence between two people who share a more profound bond, and Castiel thinks he wouldn't prefer it any other way.
! “Dean,” he chokes weakly, slipping down the second-floor steps. “Dean, come back!” He wrenches the front door open, tripping off the porch as he watches the Impala speed away.
Sadly, none of the bathrooms have actual showers installed. However, the one across the hall does sport an attached shower head to the clawfoot tub, in addition to modern plumbing (thank God). The house does not come with a washer or dryer, though, and so every few weekdays, Mrs. Butters will take home the laundry and do it there.
Castiel nods, recalling the contract Dean mentioned before. It's a shame he's quitting, Castiel will be sorry to see the suits go.
Rowena coos at the cat, struggling to remove Fergus from Dean's arms. The cat simply does not want Dean to go. She finally tears the cat away, though not before it scratches Dean's wrist in a desperate but feeble attempt to cling to the man. And... is it just Castiel, or does the cat look somewhat pleased when Dean winces and examines the cut? Those yellow eyes turn on Castiel again and seem to growl
“What can I do you for?” asks the low timbre that haunts Castiel's late-night activities. “Oh, hey Cas. Long time no see.”
“You should sleep,” Cas instructs, his blue stare unrelenting as Dean lazily traces the lines of his side.
Dean has a stocking... Does he live here? Castiel had previously inferred that while Dean comes over often, he lives elsewhere. But looking at the fireplace now, he thinks perhaps he has been incorrect. And Samuel... Is this the same 'Sam' Dean referred to before when Castiel had eavesdropped?
?” he questions, studying the interior of Dean's car. He has to concede: it's an exquisite ride that appears to be well-taken care of.
, not my money or my job or my family name. And because you cared, I grew to care for you, too.” He steps closer, with a watery smile and wet lashes. Dean is frozen, but Castiel thinks he can see the hope behind those green eyes. “You
been busy. But Dean lifts an eyebrow, daring Castiel to insist he hasn't been avoiding Dean at the store.
“You don't normally eat fish for breakfast,” Cas comments. Then, thoughtfully, he amends, “You don't normally eat fish at all.” He meets Dean's playful look. “Why now?”
“Cas! Been looking all over for–oh.” Dean stops short, glancing at Castiel's conversation partner. His eyes flick over to the hand on Castiel's arm. “Aaron,” he greets stiffly.
“I don't understand why you can't tell me where we're going, or why Dean couldn't have explained before now,” he complains. He has no idea where Dean is taking him, only that Rowena usually goes but she can't, so she cajoled Castiel into it instead. She's dismissed his inquiries all week with the excuse that Dean should be the one to explain, but this has left Castiel with far too little information.
All the fantasies he has imagined where he and Dean drink in front of the fire late into the night, where he and Dean get buzzed at staff parties and sneak off into dark corners... they all vanish. Though really, he should have guessed; even on the occasions Dean drank wine, it was barely a glassful. Castiel stumbles his way through the tour. Okay, fine, so some of his dreams won't come true; he'll get over it. It's not like he's an alcoholic, and Dr. Alder
Dean is slowly piecing things together. Cas's outrageous one liners, the long showers Dean has suddenly acquired, the intense staring contests the two of them have engaged in numerous times. But the bigger picture falls apart whenever Dean remembers how Cas had jerked away from his touch, how he'd run and avoided Dean for weeks.
Castiel is spared a response when Rowena emerges from the stairs. She looks exceptionally stunning in a midnight blue gown with a high neckline and plunging back. Her hair, usually held up during the workday, tumbles down her shoulders in waves. If he were into women, Castiel suspects he'd be drooling over her the way Dean's starting to.
Feeling as though he said something he shouldn't have, Castiel excuses himself and returns to the shelves, trying not to feel like a third wheel as he listens to Rowena and Dean leave the shop.
No one has ever looked at Castiel in such a way before. Maybe he's been wrong about Dean all along, maybe Dean's interest is genuine. It makes him feel... He can't fight the rush of heat rising to his cheeks. It makes him feel exceptional.
The cocking of a hammer snaps Castiel's attention back out the window where Bobby is now adjusting his firearm.
Dean. Castiel suddenly wants Dean more than he's ever wanted anything in life before. This penthouse, his job, his money... He has all of it, but he's not happy. He was happy with
Castiel must have missed the cold ocean wave that dumped the bucket of icy water over his head. “You... you want to go on a date?” he reiterates in disbelief. Then adds before he can help it, “I don't do relationships.”
“Target,” Dean corrects with pride. “I do it out of spite.” He looks up and down Castiel's figure, eyes darkening. “Not that that suit isn't working for you, but I didn't realize you cared so much about fashion.”
“You boys flatter me.” She grabs her purse from behind the register and turns to Castiel. “I'll be back on Sunday. Don't let the place burn down while I'm gone.”
“Oh. Well, uh...” Dean's face continues to fall as he fumbles. “I was hoping maybe we could, you know... take things slow?”
–twists an entirely new form of desire in his stomach. Unlike the other models, who plastered on slimy expressions of sex appeal, Dean exudes a tight air of draconian steel as he walks. He keeps his head high until he makes the turn, spotting Castiel in the third row, his eyes popping just a fraction before they crinkle. Dean flashes him a genuine smile and dares to wink before continuing on and disappearing behind the stage.
Dean helps the store, too. It's his idea to invest in a coffee machine, and their profits for April increase nearly thirty percent as a result. Almost every customer buys a cup to-go with their purchase, and with the extra funds, they finally buy a new sign for out front, this one reading
sound crazy, Castiel busies himself by tidying up the shelves. He keeps glancing at Dean from the corner of his eye though, watching as the man looks around, twisting on his feet and giving Castiel a perfect view of his well-dressed ass.
“Of course it's not free,” she hisses, keeping her voice low, mindful of the other two customers who are also in the room. Thankfully, none of them noticed Castiel's remark. “I said it's already taken care of.”
“You trying to leave without saying hello, Cas?” Dean drawls, only half-feigning the hurt in his tone. “And here I was getting used to your bizarre greetings.”
Castiel is no stranger to men handing out their digits. When someone gives Castiel their number, he knows what it means. But with Dean... Is this the same thing? How can Dean just give out his number so heedlessly, with no regard to Rowena? Castiel pushes her aside for the moment.
After they finish ironing out a few more details, Rowena walks him back down to the store, where Castiel is relieved to find Gabriel had done exactly nothing while they were gone.
Such as, what to pack. He was instructed to bring an overnight bag, but not much else, and so he has no idea if what he's brought is adequate enough. He has another suit in his garment bag for a second event tomorrow night, and he wonders what sort of function a mechanic would attend that requires two suits.
“Oh.” Castiel's voice is thick and rough, and Dean can't help grinding his hips at the sound of it. “
And Cas's laugh is loud and inviting, spreading its warmth through Dean's rib cage. His fingers find Dean's jaw, thumb stroking the scruff fondly.
He sounds so sincere and relieved, as if he expected Castiel to tag along and then ditch him. It does seem like something he would be inclined to do, now that he thinks about it. He was definitely more of a loner in Chicago. But now... It might not be so bad to spend time with Dean.
“It's been this way since he died,” she finishes, stroking Fergus's coat. “It happened so quickly; one day I was working the counter at the Garden Center, the next... here I am.”
Fergus, sitting higher than normal on a large pillow, hisses a warning as Castiel makes his way to the kitchen. He retrieves his lunch bag, the fridge door closing with a thud. He's almost back at the stairs when he hears a muttered, “Damn.”
“But... but...” Castiel thinks back. “But you're always sleeping over, in the shop or her apartment, and her cat loves you, and what about that date?”
Fergus hisses wildly when Castiel finally notices, as if the cat had been purposely waiting for him to see before making noise.
“The fact that I own all these books, but I've never read any of them. I have these amazing books, all of these amazing stories, right in the palm of my hand, and I just...” Castiel exhales. “I don't even give them a chance.”
Once they've finished their tea, Mrs. Butters gives the brothers a tour of the house. The inside is every bit as stunning as the outside, covered in decorative antique furniture and Persian rugs. The first two floors are featured as part of the Historic Homes tours, and additions are restricted, so Castiel has been given the bedroom on the third floor. Although he does not look forward to trekking up and down two flights of stairs every day, the room itself is lovely. A few pieces are dated, but the bed is a modern king with memory foam, and the chairs are plush leather. They set up Castiel's laptop on the mahogany desk and hang his clothes in the hand-crafted armoire. He won't have as much space as his bedroom back in the penthouse, but there's a decent bay window with a seat looking out towards the ocean where he can sit and read the morning news on his phone.
me?” he cries, hurt spilling across his face. “Were you... Was all this... Cas, were you just trying to butter me up with
“Let's go somewhere else,” he suggests more strongly. “I don't really know the area, so why don't you pick?”
Castiel wakes to a pounding headache and someone pounding on the front door, the noise banging against his skull even two floors up.
him to be? Despite his... lack of sophistication or college degree, Dean does offer a certain... appeal. Castiel hasn't been able to forget how delicious Dean looked in that suit, and his dreams take far too many liberties in demonstrating how Dean would remove said suit. The GED is hardly relevant; Castiel will teach Dean anything he needs to know, although he's fairly certain Dean already knows exactly how to move those plush lips of his. Besides... it's not as if Castiel wants to pursue anything long-term. Dean can grunt like a caveman for one night, Castiel thinks he'd prefer it.
Galveston, Texas would be at the bottom of Castiel's seaside getaway list, if he'd ever considered such a thing. Which he hasn't, not until now, not until he is driving over the massive causeway which connects the island city to the mainland. Heights and bridges have never before been a concern of his, but, with its concrete legs tall enough to allow for boats, Castiel just hopes the island will prove self-sufficient, making this particular drive a rare occasion.
, for an unknown amount of time; it could have been two or seven minutes, Dean can't tell the difference. It's only when his stomach rumbles that Dean tears his attention away from Cas and quietly closes the door, more out of respect for Cas's privacy than any sort of panic he might have upon Sam discovering Cas in his bed. He'll cross that bridge when he gets to it.
Castiel frowns. Who is this woman driving Dean away from his career? But Dean looks uncomfortable as it is, so again, he doesn't pry. “Will you miss it?” he asks instead.
He drops Dean back off in front of the shop, and the house further back has several lights on. Castiel has no doubt Bobby is waiting up, checking to make sure Dean returns safe and sound. Although he's not getting out of the car, Castiel does lean across the seat to give Dean a proper kiss goodbye. Dean makes a little content noise, strengthening the kiss and lingering longer than Castiel anticipated (but he's not complaining).
Dr. Alder crosses his arms. “Yes, disconnected. Detached from your environment. Is something... bothering you?”
. Staring at Dean all gussied up in his sleek (if off-the-rack) suit, he's getting the most bizarre sense of déjà vu.
“So,” he coughs, steering the conversation back to business. “Gabriel says he informed you of the majority of the plan over the phone. He also says you were fine with Novak Corporation owning the business, as long as you're allowed to stay on?”
Dean pants into the kiss, pressing Castiel's body as close as possible as his own hand scrambles beneath Castiel's boxers. Dean's name is a prayer on his tongue in between kisses, and Castiel doesn't think he's ever felt so cared for. No one has ever treated him the way Dean does. He never realized he was missing something from life until Dean pushed his way in.
Then, with a wink in Castiel's directions, he strolls back over to Gabriel with a whistle and thrusts the book into his chest before slipping out the front entrance with little more than a wave.
His humor soon fades, however, as his mind returns to Cas's imminent departure. He wonders what line the angel will offer up tonight. Dean hopes it will be funny enough to distract him from the sight of Cas's retreating back.
“The first one, when you pushed me into the waves and kissed me even though you tasted like seawater.”
Dean rubs the back of his neck. “Nah. Sammy got the brains in the family.” He winks at Castiel. “I just got the looks.”
“You're a student?” Castiel inquires. He'd assumed they were around the same age, and Castiel had finished college over a decade ago.
He almost mistakes the guy for someone completely different, but as Castiel rounds the couch, he recognizes the man's unkempt state and grease-smeared cheekbones. He's so put-off by the man's appearance, that it takes Castiel a few moments to realize what the man is
“No, I have a couple of things to do.” Cas steals a slice of bacon from the frying pan and pops it into his mouth. “Interesting, the molecules taste slightly different at this temperature.”
Warily, Castiel glances around the room, checking to see where Fergus might be lurking before he sits down. He has no intention of returning to the party, so long as Rowena doesn't force him. He locates the cat on the curved metal stairs leading up to the third floor and, presumably, Rowena's bedroom.
“I see you opted for something more casual,” Dean observes, eyes trailing down Castiel's buttoned shirt and pressed slacks. Castiel almost responds positively, until he realizes Dean is using sarcasm again. He huffs.
For almost a minute, Dean swears it's so quiet that Cas must have found a way to break the wards and fly directly out of the room. Closing his eyes, Dean reminds himself that everything is fine. He knew this would happen. Sure, he didn't expected it to cut so deeply, but since when did he and Cas ever inflict anything less than major scars upon each other? They have, as Cas had once called it, a
“Those stockings are old,” Dean laughs. “Rowena made 'em when I moved here a few years ago. Matching ones for her and Fergus, and the same for me and Sam.”
Most of them are silly, childish phrases, and Dean wonders what sort of videos Cas watches to pick up such language.  Probably
Dean is almost done cooking breakfast when Cas finally wakes and emerges from the bedroom, trudging into the kitchen with a yawn. He's sporting a pair of sweatpants and Dean's nightshirt, and damn if
“Say, Cas.” Dean shifts until he's sitting more comfortably. “You never did explain why you've been avoiding me.”
Laughing, Dean reigns him back in for another kiss. “Calc you later,” he promises against Castiel's mouth.
not just for his position or money. Their relationship ended when Balthazar secured himself a high position at a different firm, and Castiel was left with an empty bed and trust issues. Since then, it's been one-night stands all the way. That's all anyone ever wants: to use and lose. Why would it be any different with Dean?
For their second date, Dean takes Castiel to the Galveston Pleasure Pier. It's gimmicky and pricy and made for tourists, but Castiel loves it. He and Dean get on every single ride, roller coaster or otherwise. Dean throws up his four hotdogs after the Revolution spinner, but they ride everything else twice, even the carousel. After funnel cakes and other snacks, Dean drags Castiel to the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co, an overpriced seafood restaurant based on a film Castiel has yet to see (“We are so correcting that one day,” Dean cries, “How have you
“The alley?” Castiel echoes, glaring at his brother. “How is my Mercedes supposed to get back there without a scratch, Gabe?”
this house! And you're on leave, right? How are you paying for all this?” Dean's eyes snap to meet his abruptly, beer still limp in his hand. “You're not, like... part of a cartel, are you?”
“That has to be the cheesiest line I've ever heard,” he states seriously, although Cas can't quite conceal the mirth behind his eyes.
It's a complete lie, surely Dean must know, he even said so. But Castiel notices the tremble of Dean's throat, the way his hands ball into fists. Dean doesn't actually believe her, does he?
Dean's face falls slightly like he'd been anticipating something else, but he nods and accepts Castiel's compliment. “Thanks.”
Chicago is grayer than he remembers. The buildings are tall and cramped, the people busy and rude. Work is dull and his coworkers are annoying. Is this how Castiel's life always was? Had it always been this... unremarkable and grating?
Castiel doesn't see how a vacation here will improve his health, but Gabriel threatened to tell the CEO of Novak Corporation the full results of his health screening, which they both knew would lead to termination. The CEO, their mother, had actually fired her own husband after the man suffered a stroke. She is a tough businesswoman, but she cares about her family's health more. And Castiel really doesn't want to lose his job and the six figures a year that come with it, so he and Gabriel only mentioned that Castiel had been feeling a bit stressed as of late, and their mother agreed to the vacation immediately.
With the excuse of refilling his cup, Castiel at last extracts himself from a one-sided conversation with Mrs. Tran; she comes to the store often, sometimes bringing along her teenage son Kevin. He's here, too, somewhere, although Castiel hasn't been keeping track. He never keeps to one corner too long, not after Chastity, a college student who drops by once or twice a week for school supplies, discloses she's aiming to get kissed at midnight. The hour is winding down, and everywhere he goes, she seems to follow.
her, works with her. Surprisingly, he even likes her. He's not sure he could consciously engage in sexual conduct with her boyfriend, and he already made the astute observation not to get on her bad side.
“Should you really be stripping here?” Dean's voice cracks, although his eyes trace the droplets of coffee running down Castiel's skin.
There's definitely a bigger story behind it, but Castiel can sense Dean is already exhausted from their current discussion. The fact that Dean told him all he did is a huge step in trust in Castiel's opinion. As for Sam's tuition, if Castiel gets his way, the Winchesters will never want for money again.
The front of the shop is finally resembling something closer to a bookstore than an attic, and although Rowena grumbles about not knowing where anything is anymore, she does admit the place looks more appealing. Castiel privately thinks the entire interior needs a complete face-lift, but the store is nowhere near being ready for that, so he keeps silent on the idea.
Dean has the decency to look apologetic at that. “Sorry, man. These parties are not my forte. I, uh, I'm kinda a showman, you could say?” He fixes his suit in the mirror. “I mean, I'm
Cas squints and tilt his head, like he's not sure he heard Dean correctly. At last, he sighs and looks away.
“That's a fair observation,” he grants. “I mostly keep to the third floor, though. Mrs. Butters, the housekeeper, takes care of the other two floors.”
“No, but...” Dean exhales. “My ex is a model, Victoria's Secret mostly, but she does everything from shoes to clothes to handbags,” Dean confides, his voice still low and gloomy. “We met at a gig and hit things off immediately. We were together for two years before I discovered what type of person she really is. She–” His voice catches, and Castiel longs to comfort Dean somehow. But that would require getting into Dean's bed, and he doubts Dean would agree to that. “Basically, she did some things,” Dean stammers. “And we're not together anymore, but I still see her at these events occasionally, and Rowena's awesome, always comes with me to chase her off. Couldn't get a restraining order, so...” Castiel hears Dean shrug into the blankets. “Rowena volunteered her services.”
“Mmm, and we haven't even met yet,” the man grins, eyes bright behind the dirt and freckles that Castiel can't seem to tear his eyes from even though he's supposed to be working. “Since you're barking out orders like the Grand Moff, I'll assume you're the new owner?” the man jokes, arm outstretched for a handshake.
, since Rowena won't be back until Sunday. Thankfully, she had assured Castiel via text message that Fergus would not need feeding, but if he felt so inclined, he could go visit the poor dear. Castiel shudders. Something about that cat...
Castiel pulls out a twenty from his wallet, enough for the drink and a tip, all while Dean watches on, flabbergasted. Standing, he looks back at Dean expectantly. Castiel knows he made the right choice when Dean hurries after, a bashful smile adorning his face.
Ah fuck. A reporter recognizing him is nothing new, but right now, it's most inconvenient. It's not as if he's in hiding, he's a wealthy businessman, not a top celebrity, but Castiel hadn't exactly announced his vacation, either. People were bound to notice he'd disappeared from the public eye at some point. Although he is the least social of the Novaks siblings, he's still one of the most recognizable, courtesy of his baby blues, according to Gabe.
Castiel makes his move, swooping in to grip Dean's shoulder and haul him away from both of them, pressing the man to his side and backing into the light of the party. Dean fights at first, but he goes limp at the sight of Castiel, eyes wide and awed. Amara and her beau have black looks on their faces, mixed with bewilderment at the sudden newcomer.
“Oh. Oh no.” Rowena's excitement is gone, regret seeping into her tone, and Castiel looks over his shoulder curiously. “Oh, dear, I'm so sorry, I can't this weekend,” she apologizes. “My college friends are driving down, remember? Yes, I told you, I specifically invited you, too, and I remember you declined–yes, Meg is coming, and yes, that's exactly what you said when I told you.” She moves the phone to her other ear. “I'm so,
“Cas, it's fine,” Dean interrupts kindly, still smiling like a giddy child. “I consider you a friend, too. Now, what do you say we go back to the room so I can refresh, and then head out for dinner?”
“You know, a book collector, so to speak. Someone who hoards a lot of novels and likes the idea of reading them someday, but never actually gets around to it.”
And as Dean's hands trail over Castiel's body, there's an extra flare of passion in his gut at the twinkling of the silver band, the blue sea glass stones a constant reminder of their love for all the years to come.
“No, Cas, it sounds like you just want to dress me up and show me off to your exec buddies,” Dean snorts angrily, standing and pacing. “I can't believe you. Assuming I'd drop my job and just, what, be a trophy boyfriend or something? How could you
“Nope,” the man replies. But with a wink, he adds, “The state of Texas did.” He dangles the book in Castiel's face, proudly displaying some sort of auto restoration textbook.
Castiel squints. A model. Wait. He'd thought Dean looked like a magazine spread the first time he'd seen the man dressed to the nines. “I knew I recognized you,” Castiel says, catching Dean's attention. All the blood seems to drain from his face. “You did a Rolex ad, right?” Yes, Castiel remembers clearly now, Dean's face had been featured in a few of the magazines he kept on the coffee table in the tenth-floor lobby outside his office.
Dean continues to eye the decor with awe, but it's slightly more subdued as they go further and further into the house. “You don't like it?” he inquires. Not that he really cares, since they can live in his penthouse when they move to Chicago, but Dean's waning interest is a little disappointing.
“Yes, well, that's...” Castiel has no clue how to finish that sentence, but Mrs. Butters doesn't appear to be paying attention so he lets it drop. She ushers them all inside, instructing the men to unload Castiel's luggage into the foyer for now.
But Cas is gone before Dean can collect himself, before he remembers how to breathe. Before he hurries off to the bathroom to resolve a problem that he's not entirely sure how he acquired, although it probably has something–
“Rowena,” Dean says, eyes and lips never leaving Castiel. “You're gonna need to book a separate room tonight.”
“Like I said, he's not doing so well, especially today.” She squeezes his arm as they approach security. “The boy could use a big win.”
Rowena gives his shoulder a squeeze and flaunts a sly grin. “Don't worry, dearie. You leave that part up to me.”
Whatever the reason, Castiel plucks the card off the desk and fumbles with his phone. He's halfway through texting Dean
It's a Monday, so he doesn't have work; the week of Christmas, they will be open the extra day since the bookstore has been busier with all of the holiday shopping, but today he is free. Castiel needs to pick up a few things from the store, though, things for Gabriel's visit and some groceries so he can self-provide while Mrs. Butters is on holiday in Dallas for the next few weeks.
They break apart at the sound of a screen door slamming, and Dean rolls his eyes, muttering “Bobby,” with a sigh. Castiel spies the older man trudging across the salvage lot, and...
“We're at a fashion show, and you're wearing something from, I don't know, Exchange?” he says with dismay.
“Chicago, yes,” he confirms, but Castiel is hesitant to say more. After hearing Dean speak of all his money troubles and problems, Castiel is worried about sharing too much too soon. He doesn't want Dean to see him as only some rich exec who wants to get back to the high life as soon as possible, even if it is the truth.
“He's... he's different, Gabe. He likes me, just me. I want to bring him back to Chicago,” Castiel announces.
“That was me on the phone, sweetheart,” Gabriel supplies smoothly, shaking her hand. “I'm Gabriel, Cassie's older brother. Single, too.”
Dean grunts, his breath mixing with Cas's as they once again crowd even further into each other's personal space. “This coming from the head cheeseball himself,
There's an open door leading to a messy bathroom, across from it is a second, open door which Castiel presumes to be Rowena's bedroom. The view is mostly blocked by Dean, who dumps the cat onto the bedroom carpet before hastily stepping out and closing the door.
break out into a flush. But, he can't deny the swooping sensation of his stomach or the relief that pours through him. “Ah, yeah, right... of course! So, uh, I'll see you later?”
“Oh, Dean,” Cas murmurs, “I told you'd I stay, remember? I just have to take care of a few things first, that's all.”
Castiel is frozen in place, staring after Dean as his erection strains against his pants. “I have to go back, Dean. My job, my family, everything's there. And...” He licks his lips, finally finding the strength to move and sit next to Dean. He clasps the other man's hands. “I want you to come with me, Dean.”
Castiel swallows when the cat swivels its head back in his direction, and without bidding Dean goodbye, he races back down the stairs, lunch bag in hand.
“They've mostly made up,” Rowena replies. “Samuel is mad at Dean, but for different reasons. He doesn't like that his older brother suffered in silence and went into the job to pay for Samuel's schooling. Dean's a very private person, even among his family, and Samuel just wishes he could be there for Dean, but he's still in school and Dean still sends a check every month.”
He doesn't even bother with Dean's shirt, going instead for the zipper on his jeans and wrapping a hand around Dean's tented boxer shorts. They're damp, and Castiel wants to know if he's been like this since the restaurant. Dean's gasping and stuttering as Castiel moves his hand under the fabric, kissing his way back up to claim Dean's mouth again. He doesn't mind that Dean's already almost there, he's been dying to get his hands on the man for months, and he's not about to stop now. Castiel breathes praise onto Dean's lips as he comes apart beneath his fingertips, leaving Castiel's hand and Dean's boxers hot, wet, and sticky.
His sobriety comes to a crashing end two weeks before Christmas, when his tire check light flashes on one afternoon.
If had, he may have been able to put a lid on things before they got out of hand. Dean suspects it all began back when Cas's mind was turning bat-shit crazy and he kept spitting out facts about bees and monkeys, topics far more memorable than any random words of greeting he may or may not have given. Hell, Dean can't recall anything else from that one conversation featuring cat penises; he only wishes he could forget about male cats having thorny dicks, too.
“I would, and I do,” Castiel announces glowering at the pair of them. “I care for Dean, and I'm here for him. Not to mention... Rowena, Sam, Bobby, Jo, and the numerous other people who care. You're just a manipulative asshole who's still obessed with her ex even though she touts having moved on. I wonder, does your new boyfriend
The image of Dean with a popsicle is too much, and he beats a hasty retreat to his car, the other man laughing at his back. Castiel
something was wrong with this omelet! You put fish in it, didn't you!?”  Dean ignores his brother, though he does hear Sam gag and leave the room muttering about one too many pranks.
The little card sits innocently on the desk, while Castiel sags into the armchair in the corner, a glass of whiskey in one hand and the bottle in the other.
Not that he ever plans to return here, of course. Gabe had been thinking of himself when he mentioned the words 'vacation home.'
“Dean! How is your day going? Mine definitely just got better,” Cas praises, plopping into the booth next to him.
He looks up through damp lashes to see Rowena towering over him, a sad, kind smile on her face and a grocery bag in her hand.
in the same sentence, practically purring them with that gruff voice. Dean hasn't thought about it until now, but that is definitely a scene straight from one his late night fantasies.
It takes another month to fully sort things. He puts in his two weeks, and even though his mother is sad to see him leave, she accepts that he's found happiness elsewhere. “I was always a bit worried about you, my angel,” she says, hugging him. “But I see now that you'll be just fine.”
Castiel ignores the way his heart hammers in his chest at their close proximity. “Yes. Now I don't have to tell Rowena you're cheating on her.”
Rowena is proficient with the machine, but Castiel struggles. One Saturday after they've closed, Dean volunteers to teach him while Rowena is upstairs feeding Fergus.
“Christmas present from Gabe. And I watch movies and shows on Netflix,” Castiel explains, a bit defensive. “It's not like I spend much time here anyway,” he reasons, snaking his arms around Dean's waist and hooking his chin over the man's shoulder. “I'm usually either at the bookshop or out on dates with you.” He nuzzles Dean's neck for emphasis.
Castiel and Dean's dates become at first a weekly occurrence, and then later, a day-to-day one. As the weeks stretch into months, they go out three, sometimes four nights a week. Castiel's first impression of Galveston had left much to be desired, but Dean continues to prove him wrong.
“Rowena told me a bit,” he admits, and Dean glances back at him. “Not a lot, just enough for me to understand what you've been through. I'm sorry you ever had to go through any of that. I would never want to pressure you into anything you aren't comfortable with.”
He does uber to the closest lot, which happens to sell a variety of pre-owned vehicles. The sales rep seems a bit too enthusiastic, and he wonders just what sort of condition these cars are in. Rowena calls as they are surveying an old, gold Lincoln.
“Castiel, if you don't mind,” he introduces, shaking her proffered hand and trying to not smirk as Gabe rubs his sore skin. “It is nice to meet you, Mrs. Butters. You are the housekeeper, correct?”
“I'm sorry, too,” Castiel says, but for a different reason. He places a hand on Dean's shoulder, and Dean's gaze jumps up to lock eyes. “I think I was perhaps a bit too... hasty before. I... I would very much like to go out to dinner with you,” he admits, waiting for Dean's reaction. “I mean, if the offer still stands.”
At night, he stares at the bookcases in his living room, full of books he's never read, books that were given to him, books he can't remember buying. Books that remind him of Dean, and Castiel goes to bed without a second thought.
Castiel stumbles out of his room and across the hall to the toilet, stomach roiling and ejecting three bottle's worth of liquor directly into the porcelain.
“I do not know what you've done to enchant him, but now that he likes you, he can't stay away,” Rowena muses.
When it becomes too late to ignore, Castiel finally takes Dean back home. As much as would love to invite Dean over, not only did the man request to take things slow, but Castiel panics at the thought of Dean seeing his expensive, fancy historic home.
“First aid kit is in the bathroom upstairs,” Rowena offers, wrestling the cat at this point to keep him from escaping. She's able to shoot them a sly grin over Fergus. “You boys better grab some protection while you're there, seeing as you were about to sully the store.”
Castiel grins wryly, enjoying the sight of Dean losing composure. “There's more where that came from. Come on, I say my place since I'm living alone.”
It does, but Castiel is a grown man and he tries not to flinch. Next, Dean takes care to wipe away the dried blood and coffee residue. He lays bandaids over the larger cuts, hands gentle and slow.
to sleep simply because Dean did, wanting to remain snuggled against him. He watches Cas fondly, deciding it's not at all creepy. He stands there, leaning against the door frame with a smile on his face that Sam would surely label as
Bobby's house is being fumigated, and Castiel is too sexually frustrated to deny Dean when he suggests taking their kisses back to his place after they get kicked out of a restaurant for too much PDA.
He debates whether or not to follow Dean, but in the end, Castiel decides he has nothing to apologize for. He asked the man to leave, and eventually, he did. Nothing more to it.
Dean can only wonder how fucking long-overdue this has been, and why has he ignored these feelings all that time? He should have acted on this
“Don't worry, I'm sure it's wide enough,” Gabriel dismisses, grabbing some bags from his trunk. He pauses to smirk. “Probably.”
“And why do you think that is? Because he doesn't want you, Dean. You're not worth it. You're nothing, less than nothing actually. Everyone you care about leaves. But I didn't, did I? I wanted to spend every moment with you, Dean, and look how you repaid me. Well, I've got a new man now, and you can't have me back. Not even if you beg. So tell me, Dean,” Amara drones wickedly, “just
Castiel coughs out a dry laugh. “No, I'm not part of any mafia.” He finishes the rest of his beer, the cool drink soothing his churning gut. “I'm the head accountant for my family's banking firm.”
“Insane right?” Dean says, frowning as he pulls up to the valet stand. “They do have a lazy river though.”
“My GED? Yeah,” he replies as they cross the causeway and join I-45. Dean says nothing further, and Castiel suspects it may be a sore subject. He wonders what happened to Dean's mother, was she unable to work, or even around at all? It sounds as though Dean dropped out of school to make money, to take care of himself, and possibly someone else, his mother or a sibling maybe?
, but that can come later, so he obliges Cas's request with pleasure. He cradles the back of Castiel's neck, drawing him in to slot their lips together sweetly. He feels the remaining tension of uncertainly leave Cas's frame as he yields to Dean's touch, tilting his head in that familiar way, only this time it's done, not out of puzzlement, but out of certainty, bettering the angle as his hands grip Dean's forearms, pulling him closer and deepening the kiss.
When the old water heater needs replacing, Mrs. Butters concludes she's been washing the dishes too slowly, and Castiel doesn't bother correcting her.
Rowena does an excellent job of distracting the guard by claiming to have lost her pass, while Castiel sneaks into the room with her badge. He sneaks because he's fairly certain there's a dress code for these sorts of parties, and, sure enough, he's acquiring a fair amount of scandalized looks once he's inside.
But when he turns around, practically spinning on his toes after having the shit startled out of him, he sees the dark mass beneath Fergus, which he'd assumed to be a pillow, is sitting up and stretching.
“No, I can't,” Dean mutters back, jingling his keys. “I have to finish the contract or we're screwed. This isn't just about me; I've got to consider Sam, too.”
this life his wheelhouse? What if the ex wasn't an issue, the other models, either? What if Dean could still dress up and go to parties and eat nice dinners?
“It's not money he hates, dearie,” she comforts, wrapping an arm around him. “I shouldn't go into much detail since it is Dean's personal history and not my place to share such things... but he's also a bampot who should have told this to you already.”
Castiel arrives at the hotel with ten minutes to spare. He throws his keys at the valet, nearly running off before he can get his ticket. Rowena is waiting in the lobby, looking beautiful as ever in a red dress and strappy heels.
“It's not that, Cassie,” Gabe replies, noisily slurping down the last of his nutella shake. “I can't believe
“You're extremely childish,” Castiel says. “But no matter, I'm going to start reorganizing the store tomorrow.”
Dean swallows a huge bite of chicken before clearing his throat. “Right. Bela, this is Castiel. Castiel, this is Bela. She's a reporter for some magazine.”
All three of his calls to Rowena go straight to voicemail, so Castiel focuses on what else he needs now that he's in Houston.
sorry. I wish I could, you know I do.” Her eyes jump to where Castiel stands near the front of the store.
on you,” he confides, enjoying the way Cas's eyes darken, following Dean's tongue as it swipes across his lower lip. “But you know what?” He sidesteps, reaching behind his back to fumble with the doorknob, one hand still gripping a fistful of coat as he hauls the angel into his room with a wicked grin.
“Sorry to drop in like this,” Castiel says. “I just wanted to discuss my hours and ask you a bit about the place.”
Castiel doesn't ask who Dean is. He's not interested, nor is he proficient in 'small talk' and doesn't wish to attempt improvements now. He can't seem to push away his curiosity completely, though. “Crowley?” he inquires.
Discomfort flashes in Dean's green irises before it's hidden behind anger and resignation. “Well, we can't all afford Armani suits,” he bites, stepping around Castiel and out into the main area.
He ignores Dean, speaking only to Sam, though Dean can feel those sharp blue eyes smiting a hole into the back of his head when he thinks Dean isn't paying attention. So not actually
He makes an escape up the hidden staircase, entering Rowena's apartment and stopping in awe. He hasn't been up here in weeks, since before Gabriel arrived, so Castiel is just now seeing her Christmas decorations. Twinkling lights hang from every potted plant dangling off the ceiling, like an enchanting night sky. A small tree is shoved in the space between the couch and chair, multicolored lights and what appear to be handmade ornaments gracing every branch. Embers gleam in the fireplace and suggest a bigger flame is finally burning out, and Castiel's eyes are drawn to the stockings hanging from the mantle.
Castiel tries not to think about the implications of Dean and Rowena spending two nights away together, probably up in some swanky hotel. Castiel sighs almost wistfully at the thought, thinking back on past galas and fund-raising events Novak Corporation has held. There's nothing better than evenings full of finely-dressed people and flowing alcohol, evenings that generally ended in steamy one-night stands.
They take an uber to a ritzy place a few blocks over. Dean wants to put some space between himself and the event, but he also explains he eats free at certain restaurants as part of his modeling contract.
Dean shoots her a lopsided (and completely unadorable) smile. “I'll be here at five to pick you up.” He pats Fergus's head once more. “Crowley.” He glances over in Castiel's direction. “Cas,” he nods.
, this is what Castiel has been fantasizing about day after day, shower after shower, the trail of heat Dean leaves as his hand crawls up Castiel's back, the hint of coffee on his tongue as it probes Castiel's open mouth, the heady moan that escapes when Castiel sucks on his bottom lip.
“I realize this is a lot to process,” Castiel says, growing worried. “Perhaps I shouldn't have unloaded so much on you at once.” Or maybe Dean is trying to figure out how to let him down easily. “I know this is sudden, and if you've moved on, I completely understand and will walk away and never bother you again–”
Keeping his eyes mostly on the food, Dean raises one hand with a wave before Cas can start in with his latest, and Dean calls out cheerily, “What's buzzing, honeybee?”
“Uh, no, she usually attends the shows,” Dean replies distractedly as they drive through the downtown area. “She claims she's there for moral support, but I know she secretly loves it.”
me, Dean. You're worth more than anything else in the world to me, and I'm hopelessly and indisputably in love with you.”
Dean's hand slips from his shoulder, smile drooping as the information washes over him. “So soon...?”
“It's not that simple,” Castiel growls for what seems like the tenth time this week alone. “Dean wants a relationship, and I'm leaving at the end of September. Why start something that has an expiration date?”
“That's great,” Castiel replies, uncaring. Whatever. He just wants to go home and crawl into bed. He's probably got a bottle of whiskey stashed somewhere. One bottle won't hurt.
. He's been doing great, really. But now... Dean just paid for his car services and then handed him his
Anxiety-inducing bridges aside, Galveston is not what Castiel would call an attractive vacation spot. Many of the buildings are rundown, covered with boards leftover from past hurricanes. The dirty, decaying houses are surrounded by new, colorful homes on stilts, and the result is an eyesore in Castiel's opinion. His headaches are supposed to
At some point, Castiel had started stroking his thumb across Dean's palm, and now that he's noticed, he can't find it in him to stop.
Dean shrugs. “I've been doing it for years, I better not suck,” he jokes, his speech dropping slightly.
Although Gabriel was happy to simply enlist his brother in some sort of long-term resort where he'd never have to lift a finger, Castiel knew he would go stir-crazy without
“MacLeod's Bookstore, how may I–oh! What can I do for you then?” Rowena trills, much friendlier than usual. Must be a regular. “Of course, you know I will. When is it?” Castiel returns to his task, although it's a struggle when the magazines are covered with men in suits. That fucking suit. Castiel blames everything on it.
how you injured yourself and then blamed it on Dean?” Amara looks slapped in the face, and the man at her side glances at her uncomfortably. “Now, if you'll excuse us, we have somewhere to be.”
Shooting him a funny look, Dean nods. “Yup. I'm repping Versace tomorrow, and I can only hope whatever clown suit they stick me in doesn't look awful.”
“Of course not,” Castiel scoffs, but it's hollow and empty. “Well.” He frowns, the books coming to mind. “I do have these bookshelves.”
“Maaaaybe Cas is trying to get your attention,” Sam suggests with a shrug, drawing out the words. Dean narrows his eyes, but his brother only whistles and grabs a water bottle before heading back to the library.
,” she tells Castiel, as Dean returns to stuffing his face full of food. Castiel finds the scene both disgusting and yet somehow endearing. “Dean and I tend to...
Dean looks more at home in Castiel's bedroom, gaze sweeping over the updated furniture and Castiel's laptop and xbox console. “Wow, you weren't kidding about the no DVD player. But yet you have the latest in gaming?”
Dean is quiet for a few long moments, his gaze sweeping across Castiel's face, looking for any signs of doubt or trickery. The fingers still resting on Castiel's chest slip up to his chin, cupping his jaw and thumbing at the five o'clock shadow. Dean places a chaste kiss to the corner of Castiel's mouth, short and sweet, and Castiel thinks his heart might burst. Dean treats him so differently, so kindly, and Castiel feels special all over again.
“Oh. That.” Dean looks down at his lap and twiddles his thumbs. “That wasn't a date. That was... Ro was just doing me a favor by going to a work function with me.” Castiel tilts his head; a work event for the auto shop...? “I, uh, have a second gig,” Dean elaborates vaguely.
Cas is still searching his face, waiting kindly for Dean to stop deflecting, to sort through his thoughts and gather a true response. It's one of the things he admires most about Cas, that after all they've been through and all that they've done to each other, he
He wants to finish this book, and then, Castiel wants to read the other books, the ones he's forgotten, the ones he's never heard of. But most of all, Castiel finds he wants to read these books with
“Doesn't have a funny bone in his entire body,” Gabe answers, ignoring Castiel's glower. “But, we are actually looking for a Rowena MacLeod,” he adds when Castiel's glare grows murderous.
“I appreciate that, Cas. Part of me...” Dean closes the distance so that they're standing almost toe to toe. “A part of me wishes I could go back with you,” he whispers. “But I don't think I'd be happy, in the long run. Not to say I wouldn't be happy with
Castiel wonders if that's the sort of person he is, someone who looks but never indulges. Well, unless it's alcohol. But he's been taking it easy for the past three months, finding the lack of booze to be less jarring than he'd expected. Perhaps there is some correlation between work stress and his drinking habits.
“Dean,” he says, and Dean shudders at the implications behind that one word, his name, how Cas always speaks Dean's name with such reverence. A warm hand slips under the covers to find Dean's thigh, the other pressing a thumb against Dean's lips.
Castiel huffs and throws his napkin into his empty shrimp kisser basket. “You're the one who was practically assaulting him with your eyes when we all first met! Dean's not exactly
“I didn't like you, at first, because of that,” Dean admits. Castiel had suspected as much, but he's surprised Dean is telling him. “I thought you were gonna buy Rowena out and change everything. She gave up so much to come run it, and I thought you were gonna make all her sacrifices worthless. I'm glad you didn't.”
“Yes, dearie,” she reminds him gently. “I told you last week I'd be gone this Saturday. Don't tell me you weren't paying attention?”
Although he's not a Grinch, Castiel will concede he's not as festive as some. Luckily for him, the Galveston Historical Foundation comes along and decorates the house for the season. Even Rowena, who's declared herself repeatedly to be a summer soul, has decked out the bookstore for the holidays. Castiel can enjoy the enthusiasm of others, even if he's not gung-ho himself. He particularly likes the Dickens on the Strand event, and the Moody Gardens Festival of Lights, and although he attends neither, he still enjoys the idea of such things. Gabriel's words come to mind,
He recalls Dean's fallen expression before they'd left, the hushed exchange Castiel was not supposed to hear. What had Dean been referring to? Rowena implied he didn't want to go, but Dean had argued he had to, something about a contract and someone named Sam.
Grabbing a book from one of the shelves at random, Bowed Legs crosses the room to a small occult section Castiel hadn't noticed before. Alarmingly, the man bangs on the wall, which snaps open a moment later.
Seething, Castiel begins to unload his own trunk. He isn't sentimentally attached to his new car, but he didn't drop over a hundred thousand dollars to scratch up the paint job, either. He's barely set down a few boxes when he hears a door open and close.
“That's my baby bro,” Gabe cheers. “And don't worry, Rowena says he's sulking and pining over you. Be sure to call her when you land. Go get him, Cassie!”
“I have a degree in botany. Right out of school, I got a job at the Houston Plants and Garden Center. I was managing my location after only a year,” she touts, obviously recalling happy memories. “When Da passed, however, I put in my two weeks and moved down here.”
“Sounds like the two of you were both presumptuous idiots,” she concludes, nudging his shoulder. “You planned an entire life together in the sort of manner Dean hates, while he thought your commitment to dating meant you would choose to stay here.”
MacLeod's is only a twenty-minute drive, over in the Historic District. It isn't located on the famous Strand, rather a few streets over, but Gabriel claims it sees a decent amount of business during the summer months, according to the former owner. Castiel's year-long project will be to save this business from going under, and while it may sound like a stressful undertaking, Castiel and Gabriel both know that, if Castiel does find himself stressed and all else fails, they can just write a check.
Dean Winchester is strolling leisurely into the store, looking for all the world as if he just waltzed off the pages of a magazine. He's wearing black dress shoes, and while they don't exactly scream
It takes everything in Castiel's power not to throw himself into Dean's arms one last time. Otherwise, he may never leave.
The sound must have come from the pile of old books now scattered across the kitchen floor.  Cas's hands are still aloft but loose from where they'd accidentally lost their grip. The angel is gaping at Dean with wide eyes, mouth hanging open comically, and Dean tries to hold it together, proud of himself for not outright laughing, though he is sure Cas can spot the amusement dancing across his expression. He flips another pancake before stepping away, inching close enough to Cas where he can reach out and nudge his fingertips under Cas's jaw, guiding his mouth closed.
Gabriel has been easing his way out of Novak Corporation over the last few months. He claims he's bored with the job, but Castiel knows it likely has something to do with Rowena. She blushes darkly whenever Castiel mentions his brother's name these days. Whatever the reason, in another two months, Gabriel will be free to follow his brother down to Galveston, moving into the historic home Castiel had once stayed in.
much better than Bobby's rickety old couch. Dean groans something about memory foam and Castiel shuts him up with another kiss. He pushes Dean back until the man is lying atop the pillows and straddles his waist, bending over to mouth hotly at Dean's neck. Dean arches into the touch, sliding his hands under Castiel's shirt and digging his nails into the warm skin. Castiel hums, tugging Dean's collar to the side so he can lick his way down to Dean's clavicle. Dean's hands slip down to Castiel's ass, and he groans with satisfaction when Castiel thrusts down into Dean's lap.
With the door already open, there is no bell or chime to signify their arrival, and thus no one to greet them at the front desk. The store is crammed to the brim with tall shelves, all piled high with an assortment of books. Reading some of the spines, Castiel learns most are books on traveling, the ocean, ships, the history of Texas, and various fiction. Although they seem mainly new, the manner in which the books were slotted into their spaces has given way to wear and tear on many of the spines and corners, and a fine sheen of dust covers everything in sight.
