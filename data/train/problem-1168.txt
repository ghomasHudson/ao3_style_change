“Now, what about you?” she purred, tilting her head as she prowled toward him. “What a fine silver fox you are. I like detectives, you know. Always have done. What do you like, hmm?”
John climbed into the empty rear seat, plugging in the power bank and turning on his phone as the car pulled smoothly into traffic. He tapped the device impatiently against his palm until the home screen came up, and as soon as it did, the call from Mycroft came through.
“Have you not? Really?” Sherlock sneered. He strode over to Shankley, ignoring his outraged “Oi!” as he relieved him of his Costa coffee cup, and returned to slam it down onto Anderson’s desk, sending milky liquid sloshing out onto the photographs.
“Of course I do, John. We’re inside my head, after all.”
Sherlock cocked his head in the direction of John’s laptop. “And yet you claimed you ‘don’t want all that.’”
“And why the hell can't
“A rock,” Sherlock echoed, brow furrowing. He twirled around, pacing and unconsciously wringing his hands. “A rock, a rock...there’s something—”
All right, then. Sherlock moved on to the less obvious. He tried initials and partial names for all John’s nearest and dearest, as well as 221B, 0129, and even, thinking back to one of their most memorable cases, 1895 and SHER, and just for shits and giggles, LOCK.
John bent down to retrieve the strip of ECG readout, pulling it through his fingers. Ventricular fibrillation. NO SHOCK ADVISED was printed above the tracing.
That John could be his after all? Sherlock’s heart began thudding like a battering ram against his sternum, and before he knew it, the room was spinning around him again. He couldn’t seem to get enough air, and his hands and feet felt wrong—prickly and numb all at once. Dimly, Sherlock realized that he was hyperventilating, possibly even panicking. If John were here, he would know what to do, would know how to help him, how to make it better.
John looked regretful. “I’m sorry, too. I shouldn’t have reacted the way I did. It’s not your fault she texted you when she did. It’s just...she sets my teeth on edge. Always has done. I guess, after you saved her that last time, I was hoping she’d piss off forever.”
Abruptly Sherlock realized that he was stood there watching his flatmate having a wank, and that this might not be quite the done thing. Best to go. But just as he turned to leave, he heard John’s breath hitch and couldn’t help turning back. John’s body convulsed, bollocks contracting as thick streams of come spurted out over his chest and belly. He must have dislodged his headphones, because all at once Sherlock could hear the audio from the porn video he’d been viewing. The sound was tinny but unmistakable: a man in the midst of a frenetic and very vocal climax. Panting hard, John sank back against the pillows, still holding his softening cock. Sherlock shut the door silently behind him and fled downstairs.
“And it’s completely empty,” John mused as he played his torch around the cellar. “Nothing stored here. No boxes or bins, no discarded furniture, barely a speck of dust. And not even a hint of damp.”
THIS IS PORN. EXTREMELY NSFW. YOU WILL SEE SO MUCH DICK.
John’s phone rang and was ignored, because at that moment Sherlock’s tongue happened to be most of the way down John’s throat.
“I meant questions about the
“Sleep is boring,” said John, and went on staring.
“I’ll leave you to it, then,” Mycroft said, nodding and making his way to the door. Lestrade moved aside to let him by. As he reached the door, Mycroft turned back. “Oh, and Sherlock?” He glanced at Lestrade. “If you want to crack Dr. Watson’s code, you must remember what you always forget.”
Upstairs, Sherlock watched the two men get in and the car glide away into the pelting rain. The flat was finally quiet again after the bollocking Mrs. Hudson had given him about the damned dildo. She had insisted he fetch it off the landing
The landlady stood for some time at the bottom of the stairs, considering her strategy. This would require some smoothing over, certainly, and more than just standard-issue scones and pots of tea. No, a crisis of this magnitude meant rolling out the big guns: one of her grandmother’s cream cakes would be just the thing. No one had ever been able to resist the mollifying properties of Granny Sissons’s cream cake. Its pacifying powers were legendary. According to family lore, it had been responsible for patching up a decades-long feud between Mrs. Hudson’s uncles, Bill and Arthur, who had fallen out over a girl whose name both had long since forgotten. They had not spoken for 20 years until Granny decided enough was enough. She summoned her sons to her kitchen table, sat them down, wordlessly served them cake and tea, and withdrew to allow her confections to work their conciliatory magic. Three bites in, the brothers had made eye contact. Five bites, and grudging greetings were exchanged. By the time they’d each put away two slices, the brothers were talking and laughing just like old times. Yes, a cream cake would be just the thing.
I cried for my sister—brilliant, heartless, dangerous, and ever and always alone.
“I had to do some...reformatting,” the younger man answered.
None of it has been easy to hear, or to say, and there have been tears and recriminations and sadness and anger and guilt. But there has also been understanding and forgiveness and closeness and healing and love. And in spite of all the stumbling blocks in our path, John and I have made great strides. Even Ella says so. I have given her permission to share with John anything I may say in our sessions that she feels might help him, and he has done likewise. It is helping.
All at once, he had to get home,
(See the end of the chapter for
The remainder of the ride home passed in silence. When they reached the flat, John declined Sherlock’s offer of tea or something stronger, instead going directly to the bathroom for a shower. He emerged a few minutes later, muttered a goodnight, and disappeared upstairs to his room. Sherlock watched him go with a twinge of worry. He moved to his chair and settled himself to think.
Feeling steadier now, Sherlock opened his eyes. He considered for a moment, then launched a new browser tab and navigated to the Fleshlight website. There were two options of orifice on John’s particular model of Fleshlight (the Fleshlight Original, as it turned out): the Lady (a vulva), and the Butt (a puckered anus). John had opted for the latter. Why would he do that, if he was straight? Surely the delicate petals of the vulva would have appealed to him much more than the decidedly more masculine anus? One point in favour of John’s bisexuality, then, albeit a tenuous one. Women had anuses too, after all.
“No.”
“You’re still burning up,” said Sherlock, as chills wracked John’s frame.
” He Frisbeed a photo straight at Anderson’s head, causing him to startle and tip over backwards. The thud as he hit the floor was most satisfying, John thought.
“Not according to the aforementioned birth certificate.”
(See the end of the chapter for
John's arms tightened about me. "Sanka, you dead?” he whispered into my hair.
“That’s what it says on my birth certificate,” John said evenly, taking another sip. He nodded in the direction of the open laptop sitting to Sherlock’s right. “So, you...worked it out, then?”
“My ‘release.’”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Impatient to find out
"Bit excitable, wasn't she?" Sherlock commented, turning to watch the car's taillights disappear into the distance. "And sorely in need of a thesaurus." He turned back to find John levelling a furious glare at him. “John...” Sherlock began, taking in John’s clenched fists and the way his lips had tightened over his teeth.
“A tattoo,” Sherlock hummed, almost under his breath. “Anderson, you have done a truly remarkable job this time.”
John let go of Sherlock's hand and ran his fingers through his own hair to smooth it down, eyeing the damage to their surroundings. “What was all that about, then?” he asked, turning back.
“Don’t be ridiculous, John, you have three cups right here—”
“Sherlock, stop! Please. Give it twenty minutes. If at the end of that time I’m not okay, then I promise you can call anyone you like and I’ll go. But please just give me that time.”
Besides Luddington, the other captives turned out to be Jesse Lincoln, a 16-year-old runaway from Manchester, and 17-year-old Cynthia Carrington-Knowles, the niece of a peer, whom no one had known was missing. She had finagled this by the simple expedient of telling her posh boarding school she would be spending the midterm break on an Alaskan cruise with her parents and telling her parents she would be remaining at school. Her planned party week in London hadn’t turned out quite as she had hoped.
Greg turned an incredulous look in Mycroft’s direction before dissolving into his second belly laugh of the day—one Mycroft found just as delightful as the first. Fortunately, Greg still had Mycroft’s pocket square to hand, and he made good use of it again. “Well, I needed that,” Greg said. He finished wiping his eyes and turned to his squad, who were awaiting instructions. “All right, everyone, since we apparently don’t have a case here, everyone who was on OT can go home.” This was met with a buzz of relief from his team, who began donning coats and collecting personal belongings.
“Hey—hey—Sherlock—” I heard John say, but there was a roaring in my ears and the world was whiting out at the edges, and anything else he may have said was lost to me. I was dimly aware of his hands on me, and then somehow we were on the sofa together as though teleported there, and I was sobbing raggedly in John’s arms. And he was holding me tightly, so tightly that it should have hurt but didn’t. Somehow he knew just what I needed, and this was it. He was murmuring in my ear, words I couldn’t understand, but his voice was soothing and his touch grounded me, anchoring me as years of sorrow and heartbreak and regret poured out of me.
Irene reached out and adjusted the collar of Sherlock’s shirt, eyes flashing in amusement at the way the gesture caused John to stiffen and glare. “Because I’ve texted you dozens of times in the years since we met, and you’ve never once replied.” She held up her phone for him to see. “But tonight, I did get a response: ‘PISS OFF,’ all upper case, no punctuation. Not even an ‘SH.’” She raised her eyebrows. “Naturally, I assumed you’d been abducted and were signalling for help. I’ve been in your phone, remember. I know how your texts are supposed to look.”
He shook his head and stalked out of his room to put on the kettle.
"Bickits!" screeches Rosie, and John groans.
Sherlock hit pause again and sucked in a ragged breath. He knew it wasn’t physically possible for him to have held his breath through the entire length of the video, but the way his chest was burning certainly made it feel that way. He forced himself to try to breathe normally, but the room was spinning and tilting around him. He clutched the arms of his chair to steady himself.
“Thanks, Sherlock. Can’t stay, got to get this back to the Yard. Thanks again for your help on this one!” he said, lifting the file in salute. He opened the stairwell door and stepped through, pulling it shut in his wake, but popped his head back in when Sherlock’s voice stopped him.
“Not a problem,” Greg said. “Back in a tick.” He stood and vanished down the corridor, taking their plates and cutlery with him. By the time he returned a few minutes later, Mycroft had concluded his phone call. He had also divested himself of his suit jacket and loosened his necktie. His shirt was open at the collar and his sleeves rolled up to the elbows. Greg paused for a moment of unabashed admiration at the sight of so much exposed skin. “Work day over, then?” he asked, smiling. Mycroft nodded, smiling back shyly. Greg held up one of the two steaming mugs he was carrying. “It’s milk, no sugar, right?” Greg asked.
“Yeah...feeling a bit not good right now,” John acknowledged, although this was now self-evident. He hugged his arms around himself, shivering, and moved to the edge of the bed. “Need some water and paracetamol.”
hurt.
Louise never had a chance to make it as far as the second date. Their first and only had consisted of drinks at Louise’s local, followed by a rom-com and shared bag of buttery popcorn at the cinema. Louise was a bright, bubbly, green-eyed blonde who genuinely seemed to appreciate John’s sense of humour—up to a point, as it later transpired. The first part of their date had unfolded so well that after the movie, John suggested getting takeaway from the Chinese at the end of Baker Street and taking it back to 221B to eat. Louise agreed readily. It should be safe, John reasoned. Sherlock had a time-consuming experiment under way in the lab at Barts that he had said would need monitoring until at least midnight. John ratcheted up the charm, and by the time they’d picked up the food and made it to the flat, Louise was beginning to cast heated looks his way. John began hoping for an even happier ending to the evening than he had initially anticipated.
of yours,” Sherlock said, slapping a hand down on the first photograph he’d placed on the desk. “I suppose you couldn’t be faulted for failing to recognize something you’d never seen before. But an item you see every single day? That’s just sloppiness.”
“Yes, of course I did,” Anderson said, bridling. “It’s partly obscured by the victim’s clothing, as you can see, but the letters IW are visible. Appears to be a tattoo of some sort. I’ve got the team researching it.”
“You want him to go undercover as a runaway,” Sherlock said to Greg. “And you want me to use my homeless network as lookouts and informants. Obvious.”
Greg chuckled, then gave him a long, contemplative look. “Yes, I’m beginning to see that. There are facets to you I never suspected. You are an enigma, Mycroft Holmes. One I think I’m going to enjoy unraveling.” Mycroft’s breath caught at the heated look Greg was giving him.
“Well, this food is a sodding miracle, so I’d say your brother was right on the money in this instance,” Greg grinned. He lifted his water bottle in a toast. “Cheers!”
. Yet he felt a sudden upwelling of tenderness for his friend and flatmate, and gratitude for the excellent care Sherlock had taken of him during the night. He reached out a tentative hand and, as he had wanted to do always but had never dared, sank his fingers into his friend’s luxuriant curls.
. I hope Lestrade likes Indian.”
Greg shrugged. “Yeah, I had Sally drop me. I was going to get a cab back.” He smiled. “A lift would be great.”
“Really, John—”
Sherlock turned to examine his reflection in the living room mirror, unable to hide his dismay at the Medusa-level disarray of his hair. “Oh, Lord.” The more he tried to smooth it down, the more locks seemed to spring up in all directions. “This is stage 2B dishevelment, a.k.a. sex hair. Irretrievable without rewetting and hair product application. There’s no time for that.”
"John—John, I'm so sorry. That was the worst possible choice of words," I say, reaching out a hand to him. He is sitting on the floor now with his head turned to one side, swallowing convulsively. "John, please, look at me." He turns back to face me. His chest is heaving and he is so pale I wonder how much more he can stand before he blacks out. I shuffle forward, crouching next to him. I put my hand on one quivering shoulder, and he allows it.
?” He pressed firmly, and with a heavy grinding sound, the entire drain assembly began slowly rising out of the floor.
Mycroft lifted his own in salute, and they drank. They finished the remainder of their meal, chatting companionably, and sat back with sighs of satisfaction. “I don’t have any dessert on hand,” Greg said, “but I can offer you tea, if you’d like.”
“Right,” Lestrade agreed. He waved two of his men over. “Wilkins, Jones, we need a way in that won’t put them on high alert. We don’t want to risk them harming Shankley. We know Lester’s got at least three men in there, possibly more, possibly armed. I’d rather not have to beat in the front door. So it’s your job to get us in.”
Greg looked from one to the other in disbelief. For all they were brothers, the two men looked almost nothing alike—except at times like this, with their heads tilted back in perplexity, eyes slitted and noses crinkled. Of course neither of them would have any idea what he was talking about. Why would they? Greg sighed. “Right, uh...never mind. Sherlock, you’ve got some of the Lester case files. The Chief Super wants to wrap up the paperwork, put the case to bed.”
“John—”
“Mm. Serial killer, apparently. At least a dozen victims.”
“And what makes this Lester so interesting, pray tell?” Sherlock asked, already sounding bored.
"What was it this time?" I ask.
alarm you after all.” His smirk expanded into a grin at the wordless howl of rage this produced. He leaned against the door jamb, crossing his arms and tilting his head. “Really, though, why should you care?”
“But you can’t see, John! What if you’re not fine in a few minutes? What if—” John could feel the hands on his biceps shaking.
“You were great tonight,” John said, smiling softly. “You saved three kids and took down a human trafficking ring. You were brilliant. Amazing.”
“What do you
“I see you’ve been giving credence to my brother’s tall tales again,” Mycroft said tolerantly, and loaded up his fork with another bite of biryani. “He tends to exaggerate my influence. But let us say the chef was open to...persuasion.”
He rose again and began pacing the room, muttering to himself. He wanted to play his violin, or better yet, smoke a cigarette, but that would mean going back out into the living room and facing John again. He didn’t think he could stand any more of that unsettling gaze, not to mention dealing with John’s displeasure should he elect to smoke. His laptop was in the living room and therefore out of reach; even his mobile was in the pocket of his Belstaff. He groaned and flopped back down onto the bed, huffing and curling up in a ball. Underneath the aggravation, a cold coil of worry was twisting through his gut. Something was going on here. He had no idea what, but he was fairly certain it was nothing good. He groaned and pulled the covers over his head, huddling under them. At length, he fell asleep.
“Ella has an anger management program that one of her counsellors is running. I’m going to sign up. I want...I need...to make sure this never happens again. And when I've done that—when I've learned to be the person you deserve—” The sorrow in his eyes has abated somewhat, but the promise is still there. “When I’ve done that, maybe then we can explore what else we could be...together?”
Irene stepped away from Greg and Mycroft, nodded a goodbye to Sherlock and John, and exited with head held high. She gave Shankley a sly wink on her way to the lift. John’s shoulders dropped two inches as soon as she left the room.
Sherlock put a hand to his ear. “John?” he called. He placed his violin and bow on the coffee table and scrambled for the stairs. John was clearly in pain! “Are you okay?”
“Oi!” said Bright from down the hall. Or maybe it was Evans. One of the two. “We wait for DI Lestrade. Boss’s orders!”
“What?”
“Of course,” Mycroft nodded. “Greg, then.” Their hands were still clasped; neither man appeared to be in a rush to change that, and there was no telling how long they might have stayed so, just drinking each other in and holding hands, if the skies hadn’t chosen that moment to open up. Mycroft gave a start as a fat raindrop struck the top of his head. He wiped it away, then opened his umbrella to shield them both from the cloudburst. He cleared his throat. “May I...offer you a ride back to the Yard? I don’t see your car here.”
Lestrade approached the beds and knelt down. “You just hang on, now,” he told the kids kindly. “We’ll have you out of here in no time.”
John tilted his pelvis then, slowly and deliberately running his rock-hard shaft the length of Sherlock’s, eliciting a filthy groan from the detective that nearly finished John off then and there. He put his mouth to Sherlock’s ear. “Or did you imagine my cock in your arse, hmm? Because I can imagine that too. I’ve got an excellent imagination, Sherlock,” he said, punctuating the next words with thrusts of his pelvis, “and I can picture myself
you be interested?”
Holy Mary mother of—
forking out for this!”
“Quite so,” Mycroft said, unable to suppress a little thrill of pleasure that Greg had remembered.
“S’okay,” John said, more to himself than Sherlock, though his grip on the detective did not slacken. “I know you didn’t do it on purpose. Are you really okay?”
“Sherlock—” Lestrade called, but John held up a hand, not taking his eyes off of Sherlock. Lestrade subsided, recognizing the look of Sherlock picking up a scent. Beside him, Donovan made an impatient sound and took a step toward the two men, but Lestrade raised a finger, indicating she should wait. Donovan sighed and stepped back, arms crossed, looking annoyed. Lestrade settled back and waited for the magic to happen.
Hang on, that couldn’t be right. He shook his head. Sherlock closed his eyes again, bringing his hands to his temples as he replayed his memory of the scene, but the result was the same. No doubt about it: John had been watching gay porn.
“With me losing you,” we said together.
John turned away from Lestrade and surreptitiously took out his gun, keeping it out of sight. He wasn’t supposed to have it, after all. “After you.”
“So I see,” said Greg. “Business as usual, in other words." He looked over at Sherlock. "Still, I think you’ll like this one. Morris Lester.” He picked a file up from his desk and handed it to John, who offered it to Sherlock. The detective didn’t so much as glance at it. Shrugging, John began leafing through the contents.
“If you say so, dear,” said Mrs. Hudson doubtfully. He heard her heels clicking as she returned to her flat.
John approached and put his arms around her. “So...what say we test out this mattress before we leave? Just to be sure it’s up to scratch, of course.”
,” he grinned, and opened the door.
Sherlock knew no such thing. John was forever bleating on about tidying up, body parts in the fridge, and tedious undertakings like eating and sleeping. He did little else but repeat himself. Still, John’s stare at this moment was unnerving, and Sherlock leaned over, wordlessly grabbing John’s mobile and pressing it into his hand with somewhat more force than was strictly necessary. “Careful!” John growled, staring up at him. He pocketed the device without so much as a glance at it, and went back to staring at nothing.
“Now they’re worse,” I said. “They’re not just about the war, or the fall. They’re about Mary and the well and the drugs and Eurus and...all of it.”
Sherlock muttered something unintelligible from behind his hand.
John looked him up and down. “Not especially. I think it’s mostly the orange hair? But I’ve always felt an affinity with Bilbo Baggins, myself.”
“Eric...Lyle. Eric Lyle.”
“Yeah, fine,” John managed, his tone not quite as robust as he would have liked. He sat down on the ledge, bringing a hand up to pinch the bridge of his nose. He felt slightly lightheaded, detached from his surroundings.
John’s torch caught a flash of neon orange hair. “Oi!” he shouted. “Shankley! Stop, it’s Sherlock!”
John smiled up at him. “Would you like it to be?” he asked, feeling suddenly shy. “Because it could be, you know...if you wanted it to.”
“That, and the fact that I have to find some way to explain to the Chief Super why I authorized overtime for this—this—” he trailed off, at a loss to describe the situation.
“Okay, Eric. Can you tell me what happened?”
Sherlock fixed him with a level gaze, dead serious. “I assure you I’m not. It’s revolting,” he answered, flipping the laptop open. “His infatuation is visible from space.”
“It’s right down here,” they heard Lester say. There was a sound, like a prolonged burst of heavy static, and then nothing. Shankley’s earpiece had gone dead.
“Positively puerile,” Shankley agreed. “I feel there can be only one appropriate response to such an infantile remark.”
John shook his head, still laughing, then sobered but couldn’t suppress his grin. “This. Us. It’s ridiculous. I mean, what the bloody hell is my life? Here I am, half convinced I’m about to die in the back of a London cab with a lunatic at the wheel, and I’ve got the most gorgeous bloody madman on earth by my side. It’s mental!”
“Ah...the paperwork,” Mycroft nodded.
Sherlock advanced back into the middle of the room, crouching down to examine the overlarge drain in the centre of the floor. It was a rectangular stainless steel grill in a concrete frame, measuring perhaps two feet wide by four feet long. “Why, in a newly refurbished cellar with no evidence of damp, would one need such a huge drain?”
When had they moved so close together? Sherlock looked down into John’s eyes. “I didn’t do any of that alone,” he said, gaze roaming over the beloved face. How could any man be so perfect? “But thank you. And you...as always...were indispensable.”
John put a hand to his ear. “Shankley, we’ve lost you. Are you reading me? Cough if you can hear me. Shankley?” Silence was the only response. John turned to Sherlock. “Are you getting anything?” Sherlock shook his head, expression grim. The earpieces were supposed to have a range of 200 metres, and they were well within that limit. Either Shankley’s earpiece had failed, or something was interfering with the signal. Either way, they were out of communication, with no way of knowing what was happening inside Lester’s headquarters.
He charged through the front door, knowing instinctively that Sherlock would have left it unlocked, and stopped short at the sight of the detective himself, sat slumped on the second-to-last step of Mrs. Hudson’s staircase. It would always be Mrs. Hudson’s staircase, John thought with a pang, even though she was gone now. John dropped his bag and shoved the door shut behind him.
“Am I wrong, John?” asked Sherlock.
Shankley snapped his fingers. “Half pint!”
“Yeah, I heard. Serial killer, twelve victims, the game is on, another day in the life. So, back to your hair. Do you seriously stage it the way pathologists stage cancer?”
He was in the midst of said business when the muffled sounds of a possible scuffle caught his ear. He turned his head. Yes, that sounded like a thump and a muffled groan...coming from Sherlock’s room. Sherlock was in trouble! He cut himself off in midstream and hastily tucked himself away, not bothering to zip. He flung open the door to Sherlock’s room, ready to tackle whoever was messing with his friend.
The door was swiftly answered by one of Lester’s henchmen. As soon as he opened the door, Wilkins and Jones barged in, still shamming drunkenness and shouting for their mate. Another of Lester’s men showed up to see what the ruckus was about, followed by Lester himself a minute later. As soon as Lester came into view, Lestrade gave the signal and everyone moved in. Some of his crew put Lester and his goons up against the wall and searched them, while the rest of the team went through the building.
“Right, yeah,” said John, setting the carrier bag of food down on the coffee table next to a nearly identical one. He frowned down at it. Sherlock must have picked something up for himself and then got sidetracked before he could eat. Typical. He turned his attention back to Louise. “Uh, down the corridor, on the left.”
John pursed his lips, drawing in a breath through his nose and blowing it out again. “Guess I’ll just have to wank more,” he shrugged. “Tea?” He turned and made for the kitchen, whistling as he went.
Just then the lady herself emerged from her flat, carrying a plate. “Oh, Detective Inspector! I was just going to take Sherlock up some biscuits. Would you care for some? Or maybe a cuppa?”
"Gladly. What's your deduction, then?"
Sherlock sighed. Serial killers were never boring, that was true. He picked his dress shirt up off the floor. Ruined, of course.
Greg moved to stand beside Sherlock. “Anything?”
“Booster seat.”

“Why was that
"For a detective, you make an excellent nurse," he said, smiling.
“I have nightmares,” he said. “Well, you know that, 'course you do. I’ve had nightmares since before we met. But now...”
“Bollocks. An

, his brain supplied unhelpfully,
—Sherlock pressed his lips together, clamping down on the whimper he could feel rising in his throat—
Sherlock blinked. John was gazing up at him with such a soft smile, such warmth and light and
“John!" Sherlock said, more sharply than he had intended. He wanted the nightmare to stop, now, wanted John's torment to end, but this was not the way to go about it. He took a breath and began again, his tone softer. "John, I’m here.” Sherlock moved toward the bed but did not reach out. He knew it was unwise to wake a PTSD sufferer suddenly and was wary of provoking a violent reaction by startling John with his touch. At the sound of his voice, John seemed to shake himself, blinking, and looked around the dim room. He grimaced and put a hand to his left shoulder.
Sherlock scoffed. “You can wait if you want to. He’s not
“I’m in the middle of Scotland Yard,” Sherlock pointed out. “How could I be anything but all right?”
“Those are good options,” John acknowledged, tapping a finger against his upper lip. Sherlock and Greg watched the exchange in amusement. “But if you wanted to keep with the fictional character theme, you could opt for Ewok, or Munchkin or even Oompa Loompa.”
. He had to see them, see his daughter, his—he had to see Sherlock. He turned and bolted in the direction of 221B.
” Mycroft sniffed. “Or as
He would never again make the mistake of assuming Sherlock Holmes was heartless.
Sherlock fetched the bottle, extracted two tablets, and gave them to John, then steadied his friend's trembling hands as he brought the glass to his lips. John managed to down the medication and drain what was left in the glass. A sudden wave of drowsiness overtook him. “Need to sleep,” he slurred, eyes closing of their own accord. Sherlock moved the Union Jack pillow to John's side and helped him stretch out. John was asleep before his flatmate had finished making him comfortable.
“I’ve slowly been driving you round the twist for months now, Sherlock, or hadn’t you noticed?”
Sherlock heaved a sigh of relief at the sight of him, wordlessly reaching out a hand. John clasped it without hesitation and emerged from the replica of 221B's lounge to join him in the corridor. Instantly, Sherlock felt steadier. The ground stilled beneath them and the wind dropped, then subsided altogether. John had always been Sherlock’s one fixed point, his north star, the one who kept him right. And though the world remained off kilter, as long as John was here, Sherlock knew everything would be okay.
The case, already high-profile by reason of Nicholas Luddington’s involvement, now achieved stratospheric importance. Moe Lester was exposed not only as a paedophile but also a sex trafficker, and the evidence uncovered in this second building would be sufficient to bring down not only Lester himself, but also his entire trafficking ring and several of its clients. It was shaping up to be a huge victory for NSY.
Sherlock was incredulous. “You
Sherlock opened his eyes with a gasp.
“What wouldn’t?” John asked. He was stood just beneath the bare ceiling bulb, and Sherlock turned to squint at him. He cocked his head, gaze drawn to the light just above John’s head.
He was still chuckling as they reached the break room and began setting bags and containers out, buffet-style, on the nearest table. Two or three of his team began scrounging around for plates and utensils, and soon everyone who wanted some had a plateful.
“Let me through, please,” John said, pushing his way to the man’s side. “Sir? Sir, can you hear me?”
, Sherlock thought, pressing a hand to his own crotch and feeling his cock throb in response. He moved his hand just a bit and nearly came on the spot. Oh, bugger. This was not good. He had the presence of mind to snatch the earpiece out of his ear and chuck it in the general direction of the sofa before fleeing to his room. There he shoved his trousers and pants down, fell to his knees, and stroked himself to a shattering climax right there on his bedroom floor. “Oh, God,” he groaned. “Shit.” He knelt there, panting, for some time as he waited for sensation to return to his lower extremities. Everything from the waist down had gone all watery. Once he felt steady enough, he reached over and picked up an old t-shirt to wipe the mess off his hand and clean up the floor. He struggled to his feet and chucked the shirt and his bottoms into his laundry hamper before stumbling back to the bed and face planting onto the mattress.
No, it was clear that the balance of probability was tipping in favour of bisexuality. Oh, God!
for Sherlock. Just one more loser in the colossal crapshoot of life.
John’s eyes were very bright in the dim light of the desk lamp. “You and me...we’ve been through a whole heap together,” he said, quirking a sheepish smile at me. I returned it, recognizing the quote.
Sherlock smiled like the sun, and John’s answering smile was reflexive. “Oh, I want,” he intoned, moving in close and giving John a heated look. “I want, very much indeed.”
Sherlock was rapidly reaching the end of his tether. “
“Do you have any heart problems, Eric?”
“I know. I’ll take some paracetamol as soon as I can keep it down.” He squinted upward. “I think I can see, a bit. Yeah, I can make out the light. It’s a red haze, but I can see it.”
” Greg asked the room in general.
Sherlock looked down at himself. He had forgotten all about being half-naked. He shook his head. “Right, of course. Be right back.” He vanished into his room, emerging a minute later wearing a fresh shirt and shrugging into his suit jacket. He stopped short at the sound of John’s giggle. “What?”
Sherlock glared at him. “—in
“No.”
And just like that, they were kissing—right there on the pavement outside of NSY, for all of London to see. But London might as well have been on Venus for all their awareness of it. The two men only broke apart when the flash of a camera next to them took them by surprise. They turned to see the cabbie lowering his mobile with a grin.
The toilet flushed and Louise emerged, pale, trembling, and still bug-eyed. John opened his mouth to offer an apology or explanation but was forestalled by a head shake and upraised hand. Louise did not want to hear it. She sidestepped his outstretched arm and snatched her handbag off the chair near the door before fleeing down the stairs without a word. Only once the outside door slammed shut in her wake did John realize she had left her jacket behind. He grabbed it and chased after her, shouting an apology to an alarmed Mrs. Hudson as he sprinted by. “Louise!” he yelled as he got outside, but there was no sign of her in the street. He jogged to the next corner, to no avail. Eventually he gave it up as a bad job and returned, dejected, to 221B.
“As I said,” Anderson started, “I’ve got the team looking—”
“So, you mean release, as in...orgasm?”
“No,” I said, ducking my head as I made my admission. “I didn’t delete it, because it made you laugh.” I looked up again and caught John’s stricken expression. “And it was the first time I had heard you laugh in months.” (Trust John to be amused by a line about shattering bones.)
“Problem?” John bounced the Fleshlight on his palm.
“Bit like yours for John, then,” Greg shot back.
“Yes,” Sherlock snapped.
“Pent-up sexual frustration? Raging erections at inappropriate times?”
), writhing on the bed, face flushed, chest heaving and hand on cock. John hadn’t interrupted a crime in progress, he’d interrupted a wank. More specifically, he’d interrupted what appeared to be an earth-shattering wank, going by the way Sherlock went off like a geyser as soon as he caught sight of John. The detective groaned John's name as he shot off all over himself, the comforter, the pillows and even the headboard. John would have been impressed with the range of fire had he not been so mortified.
I try to cover up my reaction, hoping he hasn’t seen, but I know he has. When I turn to look at him, I can see that though he somehow still has a two-handed grip on the coffee press, he has forgotten its very existence. The look on his face is one of abject devastation.
Lestrade gave a sardonic smile. “So would I, but we both know that’s not how it works. Lester is also a suspected paedophile. From what we’ve been able to piece together, he seems to be preying on young runaways and homeless youth.”
to leave, but
Bit shorter chapter this time, but more to come soon!
“Morning, Greg,” said John, taking a seat in the chair in front of Greg’s desk. “Don’t mind him. He woke up feeling particularly
“To quell the nausea,” said Sherlock.
“It’s nearly half three.”
“You stay here with the baby,” John ordered a male bystander. “Do not take her out of the push chair. She may have internal injuries we can’t see, so right now that baby carrier is the safest place for her.” By now the sound of sirens could be heard, coming closer. “The ambulance is on its way. You stay with her and do not move from this spot. Understood?”
So I wait, and I trust that when John is ready, he will come to me and we will work our way through it together, as has become our wont. But in the meantime, I worry about him.
“Of course,” Greg said, taking another sip. “Ask away—anything you like.”
Night had settled in earnest around 221B. Sherlock rose from his chair, feeling chilled from his prolonged immobility. He made a fire in the grate, then made himself some tea, moving to the stairwell door and leaving it ajar so he could keep an ear out. He returned to his chair and settled himself there. He would be standing watch this night.
Eric followed instructions and John checked the pulse at his neck, then his pupillary reflexes, and palpated the rest of his chest and belly. There was some tenderness along the path of the seatbelt, but no apparent bruising or severe injury. Eric’s pulse was rapid and a bit weak; his face was bathed in sweat.
But before Cath, there was Louise, and before Louise, there was Amelia. Amelia had been more patient than many of John’s previous girlfriends, though this did not spare her suffering the same fate—a succession of dates interrupted by endless texts from Sherlock, which, if ignored, morphed into endless calls from Sherlock, which, if disregarded, culminated in the detective showing up in person, invariably at the worst and most awkward possible time. John was disappointed but not really surprised when Amelia ended it after the third such occurrence.
“Much.”
“Oh, yeah,” John said tightly, trying to think about anything besides penile ischemia from crotch constriction.
boss. I’m going in,” he said, and opened the door. The space beyond was in pitch blackness, and before either man could react, a diminutive figure shot out from beside the door and tackled Sherlock to the floor. Bright muttered a curse and shoved past John to try to separate the two men writhing and kicking on the floor.
“Why ever not?” Sherlock asked airily, swinging John around as he turned back. “There’s no case here, nothing to solve or deduce, no reason to hang about. Good evening!” He swung back around and made for the door again.
kiss, at all. It was all lips and tongues and gasps and moans, and Sherlock discovered to his delight that when so moved, John Watson didn’t so much kiss as
The low, repetitive thumping that then resonated through 221B was caused by the forehead of the world’s only consulting detective making repeated contact with the nearest wall.
In the cab, Sherlock eyed John discreetly, taking in the older man’s continued silence and pallor. “John...” he began, his voice barely audible over the cab’s sounds. John turned to face him, looking through Sherlock more than at him.
They reached the landing and rounded the turn, and John could resist the impulse no longer. He grabbed Sherlock by the shirt collar, hauled him forward, and began kissing his way down that endless neck, stopping to nibble at the freckle just to the right of Sherlock’s Adam’s apple. He had been wanting to lavish attention on that spot for years. Sherlock shuddered and groaned, hips bucking, and John felt the hard outline of Sherlock’s cock bump against his hip. The sensation drove him mad. “I need to see you naked,
Greg paused on the bottom step, thinking back. Remembering more than a decade of quiet dinners shared in elegant restaurants all across London, ostensibly to discuss Sherlock but ranging much farther afield. Recalling long evenings spent in quiet conversation at the Diogenes Club, putting the world to rights over tumblers of exquisite (and exquisitely expensive) scotch. Thinking of years of generous and elegant gifts so perfectly suited to him that they were clearly the result of considerable thought and contemplation on Mycroft’s part and not a duty fobbed off on Anthea or some underling. Greg had attributed all of that to Mycroft’s gratitude for his help in wrangling his wayward younger sibling, but maybe there was more to it? Greg couldn’t deny his own attraction to Mycroft, but for most of the years of their acquaintance, Greg had been married, and Mycroft had been...Mycroft. Out of Greg’s league. Quite apart from which, Greg would never be unfaithful, not even after learning that his wife had. So what was Sherlock on about? It certainly wasn’t like him to suggest an attraction where there wasn’t one, unless he had something to gain by doing so, and Greg couldn’t imagine that was the case here. So maybe—? Greg shook his head. Nope. Still ridiculous. All at once the full weight of his fatigue hit him behind the knees and he very nearly sat down where he stood. The only thing that stopped him was the knowledge that if he sat down now, he would probably never get up again. He’d have to live the rest of his life right here on Mrs. Hudson’s bottom step. Could a man live on a steady diet of nothing but baked goods and tea? He was tempted to find out.
or jump out of our skins, when the ghosts crowd close around us in the dark and the nightmares drive us from our beds, John and I seek each other out, and we talk.
“Can’t. There isn’t one.”
“Ah, excellent timing,” Sherlock said, making for the cab.
He has told me about his time in the army and about being shot; I have told him about my time at uni and how I got into drugs.
"How do you feel?" asked Sherlock.
“It is oversized, isn’t it?” Lestrade asked. “It’s odd.”
John sighed and complied, knowing there was no point in arguing. Sherlock followed suit without a word. Cath roared off in a cloud of dust, leaving the two men staring at each other by the side of the road.
. He took another deep breath and emphasized the word
Sherlock cupped John’s jaw and brought his face down to John’s, and he was right. It was the most natural thing in the world for their lips to meet, for the kiss to deepen and their tongues to slide against one another in the hot wetness, for their arms to come about one another and for John’s clothes to drop to the floor in a trail from the bathroom to Sherlock’s bed. It was natural for their bodies to writhe together, gasping, slick with sweat, rutting, sucking, frotting, cock on cock, and then coming again and again, on each other, in one another, each crying the other’s name.
John cleared his throat. “Right, then,” he said, and took his sex toy back upstairs.
The detective knelt next to the sofa, tucking the afghan around his friend and smoothing John's damp hair back from where it had stuck to his forehead. "Made it with 48 seconds to spare," he murmured. "Taking it right down to the wire, John. Extremely unwise and far too close for comfort. And we really must have a conversation about your unfortunate tendency to overdramatise. All this going blind and losing consciousness, really. It's not on. Simply won't do. There is only room enough in this relationship for one drama queen, and for the record, that's me. But I'll make an exception, just this once, on one condition." He leaned closer, letting out a shaky breath, then whispered into his friend's ear: "You are never to scare me like that again, John Watson. Do you hear me? Never. Again."
“Right, boss,” said Wilkins. “On it.”
“Now, hang on!” Greg said. “You can’t just leave things like this!”
“John?” asked Sherlock, keeping his voice low for Rosie’s sake. “What’s happened?” John just shook his head and held on.
Sherlock nodded again, steeling himself. “Yes," he agreed. "And I need to say it.” He squared his shoulders, drew in a calming breath, and left his mind palace. He opened his eyes—
Sherlock froze in the act of hanging his Belstaff on the door hook. “You said pass your phone? When?”
"John?
“What?” Now Sherlock’s gaze snapped up in earnest.
“You’re welcome,” said Sherlock, and sipped his tea with a small smile.
Revolting! And if by some miracle Lestrade was able to not just tolerate but even become enamoured of his insufferable brother, who knew how far it might go? There might be a happy announcement by the end of the week. Sherlock could end up with a brother-in-law named...Gavin? George? Geronimo? No, none of those were right. What was his name, again? John was always after him to remember it. Greg! Greg, that was it.
As promised, the restaurant was exquisite. They were shown to a booth in a secluded corner and served one of the best meals of their recollection, working their way steadily through
I look him in the eye as I say it. All my barriers are down and I let him see me, undefended, unadorned, unfeigned. He reads the truth in my face, in my eyes, and looks gobsmacked.
“You,” said Sherlock.
“And let’s not forget the catch-alls, like, er, jockey.”
, unprotected eye sex.
“Please,” I answer. “I’ll get the mugs,” I add. I move to the counter and reach up; John does likewise to my right, but somehow the coffee press overbalances and he has to make a sudden grab for it to keep it from falling and shattering.
“You mean it’s
“I thought so,” Greg answered. “Will you come?”
, but just...suddenly, randomly, pointlessly. Just like that, no more John Watson, M.D., formerly of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers. No more father for Rosie. No more blogger, flatmate, protector,
He took another (very calm, very measured) breath and opened John’s browser history. John, it seemed, had been watching quite a lot of gay porn in recent months, but none so often as the video Sherlock had just watched, whose page John had visited no fewer than 47 times in the past ten weeks. Last night had clearly not been the first time John had got off to this particular piece of pornography. And that, more than anything else, was the clearest evidence yet not only of John’s bisexuality in general, but of his attraction to Sherlock in particular.
The crisis comes, as so many crises do, unexpectedly and over a seeming trifle.
Sherlock collected his scattered wits. “Er...yeah. Tired, but still a bit wound up. Think I’ll play for a bit...unwind.”
There is a tentative "Yoo-hoo?" from the doorway, and Mrs. Hudson pokes her head in. "Is all the shouting overwith, then?" she asks.
Plan in place, Mrs. Hudson smiled and returned to her flat. Suddenly the hellish screeching of an abused violin filled the house, and Mrs. Hudson sighed, shaking her head. She took her apron down off its hook. Might as well get started on the baking, since there would be no sleep for anyone tonight—not as long as Sherlock was doing his impression of the losing side in a cat fight. Hopefully Granny’s cake would be up to the challenge.
Unsurprisingly, Sherlock’s period of calm was brief—after all, even necrotic genitalia couldn’t counteract the cumulative effects of sexual frustration coupled with the elation of a serial killer case. By the time they reached the squad room, Sherlock was positively vibrating. In John’s experience, this meant things could go one of two ways: hyper focus, light-speed deductions, and a brilliant solve, or relentless antagonism of everyone within shouting distance...and a brilliant solve. That last was pretty much a given with Sherlock. John bit his lip and hoped for the former eventuality rather than the latter.
“Smalls.”
“Ella, of course. It appears I have PTSD, as well. Serbia,” I tell him. He knows I was tortured there. It was one of the things we talked about. “That was why I flinched. It wasn’t because of—”
He reached out, then, but faltered, his hand halting midway between us. He looked up again and I saw the fear there in his eyes. In the end it was I who bridged the gap, extending my own hand to clasp his. His fingers were calloused and warm and felt tiny in mine. But then, as he never ceases to remind me, I do have oversized hands.
radiating from those sea-glass eyes.
“I think we’ve found where Shankley went,” Sherlock said. He turned to John, gesturing toward the cage. “Shall we?”
John blew out a breath. “I just need to get to Sherlock right now, Mycroft. It’s too late for Mrs. Hudson, so he’s my only concern. I promise you I won’t leave him.”
“You never answered my question, John!” Sherlock shouted after him.
Lestrade ensured that the kids were freed from their shackles, taken out to the waiting ambulances, and given an initial once-over. They huddled under their shock blankets, sipping tea and blinking in the flashing lights as John and the paramedics checked them over. A few quiet questions from Lestrade and Shankley established that they had been held prisoner but not otherwise molested; they said Lester had been keeping them for a select client willing to pay extra for “undamaged goods.” Once word got out that a peer’s young relative had been rescued from a life of sexual slavery, the brass began coming out of the woodwork. First the Chief of Police, then the mayor of London and eventually the illustrious uncle himself showed up to heap praise and thanks on Lestrade, Shankley, Sherlock, and NSY as a whole. Then the press got wind of it and a media circus ensued. Fortunately the ambulances had departed by that time. Once all the shouting was over, even Mycroft materialized to offer his congratulations along with a lift back to Baker Street. By that time it was so late as to be verging on early, and they accepted gratefully.
Sherlock slapped a hand over his mouth, determined not to betray himself any further.
He jabbed his finger directly at the Fleshlight.
John kept his voice low so the others couldn’t eavesdrop. “Okay, so...what have we got?” He turned and hooked a thumb towards the building they had just searched. “We all saw Shankley go through that door, we know he was in there, and now there’s no sign of him. He can’t have vanished into thin air, so...what?” John gestured at the barren yard surrounding them. “It’s not like he could be hiding behind a tree or under a rock somewhere...”
“Mycroft?” he asked, voice tight.
John cleared his throat to stop the giggle he could feel rising. “Well—” He strode over to a small cabinet they kept near the windows and bent down to open a drawer. “—if you’re having a bad hair day, there’s always the refuge of lesser mortals.”
“Agreed,” John said.
When John came back to himself, he could feel something cold and damp on his forehead and something else pressing into his neck. He grimaced and moved his head away, and the uncomfortable pressure eased.
John smirked, eyes twinkling. “Well, it seems your brother was right. Sex
I cried for Victor, my first best friend, whom I could barely remember now but whose loss had so devastated me that I rewrote the first six years of my life in their entirety. Victor, drowning alone in a well because I wasn't clever enough to save him.
“So, tell me, Detect—” Mycroft cut himself off and held up a hand as Greg opened his mouth to protest. “Sorry—force of habit. I mean, Greg. I...have a question, if I may.”
?” she screeched again.
He moved to the head of the bed and shoved the top pillow out of the way, revealing another pillow underneath. He paused, eyes narrowing as he frowned down at it. This must be the cervical pillow John had mentioned wanting to buy to help with his neck pain. Odd that it was shaped like a pair of buttocks. He shook his head again, willing himself to focus and stop getting sidetracked. He snarled and bent down to grab the protruding corner of the laptop, shoving the pillow out of the way as he did so. He was wholly unprepared for the 12-inch silicone penis that slapped him on the cheek as the pillow flipped over. What—? He put a hand to his cheek in shock, then took a closer look at the item.
“I’m listening, John. What?”
Greg tipped his head back, assessing. “So what were they—the circumstances? Bribe to the chef? Threat of banishment to...I don’t know...someplace with no ingredients? Promise of future favours from the British government?”
The hope reared its head again, and again Sherlock clamped down on it.
John smiled in disbelief. “Me?” he turned and gestured at the wreckage around them, “I managed all this?”
“We do what we always do, now, since that first night. We talk about it, we work on it, and we get on with it. We learn better, and we do better. But we do it together.”
Mycroft raised his eyebrows, then sighed. “Surely my recent use of such terms as ‘blue balls’ and ‘clusterfuck’ is evidence enough of the fact that I am no aristocrat.”
John smiled sweetly. “And there it is. You’ve been very slow, you know.”
Greg drained the last of his tea, holding out his hand for Mycroft’s similarly empty mug. He rose to place them on his desk, then returned to the sofa, settling in beside his companion. “But, if you really want to know...I told Irene Adler I would rather shit in my hands and clap than have anything to do with her.”
Mycroft’s look of astonishment morphed swiftly into mirth as he dissolved into a belly laugh of his own. Greg watched avidly, face creasing into a grin. Soon it was Mycroft’s turn to wipe at his eyes, and Greg produced the ever-useful pocket square, reaching up and gently wiping Mycroft’s cheeks. Mycroft sobered as he looked into Greg’s eyes.
“You were trying to save my life,” John counters. “I was trying to take yours.”
texting you?” John snarled, scowling. He crossed his arms over his still-bare chest, thrusting his chin out as he waited for an explanation.
“Yeah,” John smiled. “Yeah, ‘course I do.” Sherlock lowered his head again and proceeded to snog him within an inch of his life.
Sherlock took the chest from John, giving a fond smile as he brushed the lid clear of dust. “Yes. The beginning.”
“Not in the least. Objectively, she is an attractive, confident woman who knows what she wants and is clearly unafraid to indulge in all manner of creative sexual exploits. You are bisexual. Why
Greg gave a long-suffering sigh. “Not that it’s anyone’s business,” he said with a pointed glare at Sherlock, “but no, not gay. Bisexual. We do exist,” he told the room at large.
“Sherlock!”
“Let me help you,” said Sherlock, hooking a hand under John’s arm and supporting him as he stood. The fact that John made no objection to this level of fussing on Sherlock’s part was worrisome.
“Really?” squeaked Cath. “That sounds fantastic! What do you think, John?”
“Can you tell me your name?” asked John.
“Oh, very mature, John,” Sherlock shouted after him as John stomped up the stairs to his room. “Be sure to let Mrs. Hudson know when you’re ready for your milk and biscuits!”
It was nearly 2 a.m. when Sherlock’s ears caught the first sign of the nightmare. He could just make out the sound of John thrashing around in his bed, followed by some muffled cries. Sherlock waited. Would this be a bad one? The thrashing and cries intensified. There was a clatter as something was knocked to the floor. A bad one, then.
“Thank you,” Sherlock said with a bogus smile that didn’t so much drop from his face as plummet. He pocketed his phone. “Now, as I requested earlier,
John rounded the front of the lorry to find a woman lying prone on the pavement. He crouched beside her, feeling her neck for a pulse. Nothing. Her head was turned away from him and he moved around until he could see her face. His shoulders sagged. She had been pretty once, before the impact that caved in the side of her skull. He covered her face with the scarf she had been wearing.
There was another tennis-match moment as every neck in the room craned to catch sight of the new arrival. Mycroft’s face morphed into a mask of horror, and a thunderhead began massing directly above John Watson's head.
“Everything okay in here?” asked John, looking unnaturally lively for a man operating on zero sleep.
About a hundred paces in the direction of 221B from the Baker Street tube station entrance, there was an American coin embedded in the pavement. A dime, to be exact. How it had come to be there and why it had never been removed or paved over was unclear. Yet there it sat, winking up from its dip in the pavement, too deep to be dug out but not so deep as to obscure its exotic identity. John made a point of pausing every time he passed the spot, just to check that it was still there and wonder, as ever, what its story was.
Fortunately for Mycroft, some near-forgotten vestige of his MI-5 training kicked in just in time to save him from a dildo-related head injury. He ducked, and the sex toy caromed off the door frame where his head had just been and bounced away down the stairs, fetching up somewhere on the landing. Mycroft squinted down at it, then shook his head in disbelief as he realized what he was looking at. He moved into the room, closing the door behind him.
“Greg. After all these years, I think we can swing first names, don’t you?” Greg asked gently.
“And a good evening to you, too,” came Greg’s sardonic voice. “Where’ve you been? I’ve been calling you and John for ages. We’ve got a good one.”
Holmes!” came Mrs. Hudson’ shriek. “
“Turn towards me?”
her. I know the sort of thing she’s involved in. I don’t know the details, of course, but I remember she was mixed up in that whole business with the dead German guy in the boot who was supposed to be on a flight. And she had something to do with Sherlock beating that CIA agent within an inch of his life and then turfing him out the window at Baker Street. And more importantly...I saw the look on your face during that whole business.” Greg paused, gaze softening as Mycroft closed his eyes in revulsion at the memory. “You looked terrified. In all the years I’ve known you, I’ve never seen you look like that. And that alone was enough to make me never want to have anything to do with her.”
Sherlock’s head swivelled slowly in Greg’s direction. “Remarkable. This is truly remarkable, Lestrade.”
” he echoed.
, John.”
“Not the bloody dish rack!” Sherlock shouted.
The struggle ceased instantly. Shankley’s head popped up from behind the detective, who released him and sat back, breathing hard. “Well, if isn’t my old pal Bilbo!” Shankley panted, grinning. “Come to take me back to the Shire?”
—until John had thrown his head back while climaxing and his headphones had fallen off, and Sherlock could hear the audio from the porn video John had been watching.
Sherlock sighed and ranged farther afield. He tried John’s more distant relatives, his friends, and even—scraping the bottom of the barrel a bit—his catalogue of former girlfriends.
say next. I closed my eyes. “I’m so tired,” I breathed. Where had that come from? And yet it was the truth. I felt something give way, then, as though that simple utterance had been the last barrier standing against a raging torrent, and all at once I was powerless before the surge. I felt myself begin to shake and could not stop it. I pulled my hands from John’s grasp, pressing my palms to my eyes as though trying to hold something back, but there was no stopping this. I could as soon hold back a tsunami with my bare hands, or an avalanche. It was inexorable. I could feel my breath rasping in my throat as the swell took me under.
“Y-yes, sir,” the man answered, responding instinctively to John’s air of command.
The image sent Sherlock over the edge, and with a sharp cry he came convulsively all over the shower wall.
Bright was fit to be tied. “And
They were both vocal now, gasps and moans mixing with aborted expletives and each other’s names. John grabbed Sherlock’s buttocks, kneading them to grind their cocks together as hard as he could. They moved faster and faster as their arousal spiralled upward, until Sherlock gave a cry and went rigid. John raised his head, watching avidly as the first hot pulses shot out onto his stomach. The sight of Sherlock’s head thrown back, eyes squeezed shut in ecstasy and mouth open in a wordless scream, sent John over the edge. He shouted and then came, hard and fast, all over his own belly. Sherlock opened his eyes and looked down, mesmerized by the sight of two cocks spurting out alternating ribbons of hot release. It seemed to go on and on, and they rode it out together with gasps and moans, until at length it tapered off. Sherlock’s arms gave way and he collapsed down onto John, trembling with the aftershocks. John put his arms around him, holding him tight and nuzzling into Sherlock’s neck.
Anderson, conferring with Sally at his desk, looked up and snickered at the sight of Sherlock bookended by the two smaller men. “Looks like Strider found the Hobbits,” he muttered, and Sally snorted.
, and even in his current state, it went straight to John's cock. “Take me home, Captain Watson,” Sherlock breathed, “and fuck me.”
There was another collective head swivel as the door to the squad room opened. Mycroft Holmes entered, carrying an umbrella in one hand and multiple bags of takeaway in the other. He paused in surprise just inside the door. Sherlock groaned at the sight of him. “Mycroft? What the hell are you doing here?” Then the deductions kicked in. “Oh, of course. You had a date, it got cancelled because of Anderson’s joke of a case, and now you’ve shown up with dinner for your
“I had to see if you were all right, of course,” Irene purred, slinking toward him.
“Don’t,” Mycroft said, eyes blazing with a cold fury.
“Yes, of course.”
Some days later, Sherlock got his wish. He had risen and showered early that morning. Just as he finished dressing and shut off the light in his room, John came downstairs for his morning shower. Seemingly unaware that Sherlock was up and could see him through the glass door to the bathroom, John flicked on the light, stripped out of his bathrobe, and hung it on the back of the door. He turned toward the shower, and that was when Sherlock saw it: John’s cock, hard and flushed and fully erect. As Sherlock watched, John reached down, giving himself a preparatory tug as he moved toward the bathtub, and Sherlock couldn’t help gasping at the sight. He stood rooted to the spot, feeling himself flush all the way to his hairline.
Greg turned to John as he sensed him stiffening beside him. “What?”
“Okay, that’s good,” I tell him. “You're doing well. Now I need you to look around the room and name five things you can see.”
His attacker had him backed against the wall now and was plastered against the detective. “Dangerous,” he said, punctuating each word with a full-body shove. “Dangerous and foolish.” The man’s scent filled Sherlock’s nostrils. “The great Sherlock Holmes, who thinks he knows everything.”
So I waited, and John cleared his throat and began again, frowning down at his hands, fingers interlaced so tightly the knuckles had whitened. “Do you remember that ridiculous movie that was on a few nights ago, when neither of us could sleep? About the Jamaican bobsled team going to the Olympics in Canada?”
“Okay,” said John. He was too tired and sick to argue. “Okay.” He leaned his head against Sherlock’s forearm as his friend pressed the cold cloth to his forehead. He breathed a little, not wanting to move for the moment. Sherlock seemed to sense this and settled on the floor next to him, the flannel dangling from one hand. He wasn’t sure how long they remained there, but John must have dozed off because he awoke with his head on Sherlock’s shoulder and a churning in his gut.
“We’re pulling up now. I’ll speak to you later.” John rang off, yanking the power cable out and pocketing his mobile. He grabbed his bag and was out and running before the car had even come to a complete stop.
sound with every inhale and exhale. “S-sofa,” he begins, and I nod encouragement. “Rug.” Another nod. He gulps. “Chairs.” I take him through the remainder of the exercise. Four things he can feel, three he can hear, two he can smell, one he can taste. By the time we get to the final deep inhale, his breathing has calmed, though he is still ashen and I can feel him shaking.
Suddenly Sherlock was there with a flannel, pressing the cold cloth to his forehead and neck in turn. John tried to draw away, sitting back against the edge of the bathtub. “Keep back, Sherlock. I don’t want you catching this.” He pressed the back of one hand to his mouth. "Also...there's a very good chance I will vomit on you."
“Sure, yeah. Ta. I put everything on a tray for us. Here you are.” John handed over the tray of dishes and utensils, and Louise took it all into the next room. He took down a couple of wine glasses and had just fished the corkscrew out of the depths of the cutlery drawer when Louise unleashed a window-rattling scream. The corkscrew fell forgotten to the worktop as John bolted in to see what was wrong.
It’s pure reflex, entirely beyond my control. Ever since Serbia, any sudden movement in the periphery of my visual field is a trigger. I flinch.
“You? You were hardly the only one making mistakes, John. There’s plenty of blame to go around, and a hefty share of it is mine.”
Sherlock simply stared at him.
“I second that sentiment,” said John.
“I felt dizzy, I-I couldn’t see right, and then everything went black—Oh, God, did I hit anyone?” He tried to straighten up to look around, but John placed a restraining hand on his chest.
Sherlock’s search for a solution to the John conundrum took a back seat for the next while, as Lestrade called them in to help with the Morris Lester case. They found Lestrade in his office, pastry in one hand and coffee cup in the other. “Hello, gents,” he greeted them cheerily. “Have a seat.”
Sherlock smirked, then reached around to grab a double handful of John’s arse, pulling him back in and tilting his own pelvis until their cocks were rubbing again. “But what if that’s what
"Not your nutritionist, dear," says Mrs. Hudson, patting his arm. "Back in a tick."
“Ah. Well, I think I’ve found a solution to that problem. Not perfect, but workable, I think.”
Determined to get to the bottom of this, he fetched his mobile from the bedroom and returned to the kitchen to Google Fleshlight. He nearly dropped his mug at what came up. He stared at the black cylinder from across the room. That thing was a— and John had used it to— and Sherlock had touched it. Not just touched it, but
“An hour ago.”
doing there?”
He felt Sherlock’s laugh before he heard it, and after a moment he joined in, although giggling hurt almost every part of him there was to hurt. A minute later they sobered and John felt a hand slide into his. “Please be okay, John.” Sherlock’s voice was almost inaudible. John squeezed the hand with his own.
Was it possible that everything...everything Sherlock had ever wanted—dreamed—could actually
The cabbie chortled and started the meter, then shifted the car into gear. “Oh, you have come to the right place! Buckle up, gents!” he shouted, and peeled rubber away from the kerb.
” Greg echoed, cutting through the uproar of the squad's disgruntlement. He moved to Sherlock’s side, followed closely by John.
“Well,” came a woman’s languid voice. “I’ve had some memorable receptions in my time, but this one takes the cake.”
John raised his eyebrows. “Hmm? Worked what out?”
“I need to go back over...us...every moment we’ve spent together, every interaction.” He turned and entered the replica 221B, John trailing him. Sherlock gestured at the overturned armchairs, the listing bookshelves, the piles of papers and rubble. “I need to put all of this back in order.”
The entire squad was glaring at Anderson. Even Donovan looked ready to throttle him. Anderson sputtered and flushed to the roots of his hair. Sherlock stalked back toward him, bending over the desk again. “Do you know what I was doing just before being called in on this farce?” he asked. Low. Silken. Deathly calm. His eyes blazed with green fury. Anderson went from red to white in an instant.
When they arrived back at 221B, Sherlock and John were exhausted but elated. They crept quietly up the stairs to avoid disturbing Mrs. Hudson and shared a silent smile as they hung their coats on the living room door hook. John turned to Sherlock, looking up into his face, and the taller man faltered at the look of open fondness in John’s eyes.
not helping my situation.”
“By the way,” Sherlock remarked casually as he resumed his seat, “don’t be surprised if you find my brother lingering outside. He’ll use any excuse to loiter if it means the chance to talk to you.” He looked up at Greg with a smirk. “He thinks I’ve no idea just how
Thank you, John, that was very helpful.”
he finds you.”
Sherlock watched the entire, twenty-minute video through. Watched as these doubles of himself and John kissed and fondled and traded oral sex. Watched as the blond man lowered himself down onto his partner’s stiff cock, going slowly, easing into it, before the other man began moving, slowly at first and then thrusting up into him. Watched as they worked their way through several creative and frankly contortionate positions, until finally the John double—Kent, apparently—ended up on his back, with the Sherlock double—Chandler—kneeling between his legs as he fucked him. Kent was flushed scarlet now, sweat glistening on his face and forehead as he reached down and began pulling himself off, the flush of arousal spreading over his chest. Kent was cursing now, chasing his climax, and Chandler urged him on, fucking him through it until Kent shot off all over his own chest. The sight pushed Chandler closer to his own orgasm, and within a few seconds he was frantic, arousal peaking as he pounded into Kent, who continued to stroke himself off despite just having come. He didn’t want the pleasure to end. Chandler was close now, cursing and panting, and it was Kent’s turn to urge him on as Chandler pulled out and took himself in hand, stroking hard and fast, until he shouted and came hard all over Kent as he lay sprawled out beneath him. Both men were crying out and cursing as Chandler’s come pulsed out of him, and with a jolt, Sherlock recognized the moment he had overheard the previous night. This, then, was what had brought John to orgasm—the sight of a Sherlock lookalike ejaculating all over a John lookalike. And no wonder—Sherlock himself was so hard it felt like his cock was trying to punch a hole through his trousers.
