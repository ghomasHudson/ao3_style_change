“I—don’t understand,” said John, concern etched across his features.
“Don’t make me laugh, I can’t keep laughing in a morgue,” said John, working hard to stop himself smiling again.
Someone with nerves of steel.
There was no reply.
“Of course.”
“People die all the time.
John might have interrupted them, but at that moment the cluster of people working on disabling the bomb he was wearing eased his arms out of the coat, and quickly retreated with it. The second the coat was off and several yards away, all the adrenaline in John’s body seemed to evaporate. He took two steps to the side and his knees gave way. He sank into a crouch, hand sliding down the wall, and he turned until his back was resting against the tile. He shut his eyes, taking a deep breath. “
“You really are terrible,” said Sherlock. He looked his brother up and down, compensating for the concerned gesture with a dispassionate, “You
~o~O~o~
It was a… very new experience.
“I was thinking because of how unbelievably uncomfortable those chairs are—but yes, let’s call it stress.”
I want to include dead servicemen in the search,” said Mycroft, looking at Sherlock briefly as he spoke. “But the advantage of dealing with someone with a reputation like Moriarty’s is that no one here has any doubt in his ability to hide one of his associates behind a dead man’s name.”
,” snapped Sherlock, stepping back out of John’s reach and rubbing his sore forehead, which was sure to bruise now. “What is
John watched. “Wait, you’re not working at Bart’s?” he asked in confusion.
Sherlock ignored him, and shoved his key into the lock. He unlocked the front door and pushed it open, stepping into the entryway and leaving Mycroft and John on the street with little choice but to hurry after him.
It was Sherlock who broke the silence, his voice sharp and clipped. “I don’t want you here. Leave.”
“Bear in mind, I think there’s a decent chance that he’s someone who’s already died once,” Sherlock pointed out. “Death does not rule people out, in this case.”
“That reminds me, Lestrade,” he said. “I’d asked John—how did you manage to find me? I admit I was unduly impressed with your ability to feign competence.”
Ring.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Don’t tell me you and Lestrade wouldn’t have been able to figure it out, come
“Just trust me,” said Sherlock, opening his laptop. “I’m already taking your advice about letting people assist me. I let Mycroft and my Network fill me in, I reached out to Kitty, I’m involving Lestrade.”
Mycroft looked at Sherlock as if he was a toddler who’d just blurted out a string of profanities. “Why?”
“What do you need me to do?” he asked.
Sherlock had the acting skill necessary to know when less was more. He bristled, eyes narrowing. “Really.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“No,” said Sherlock bitterly. “The one time I cannot afford to have them find nothing, they find nothing. This case is withering right in front of me. Our adversaries can slink away into the night and
And while there was good reason to return John to his deceased state, because that was what everyone (including John) was expecting, that final, single fact was what did it.
After fifty minutes and fifty-eight seconds of work, he was through six of the nine stitches, and John couldn’t help but think—in between the string of constant profanities he was half-shouting as he examined his progress in the bathroom mirror—that he had done a fair job.
And then, with a single touch—everything Sherlock thought he knew about himself was gone.
Sherlock stared at John.
“Damn,” John muttered, and he rushed out the front door and nearly collided with Sherlock, who was standing on the sidewalk. The street was quiet, the silence of late-night London undisturbed.
Sherlock hung up, leaping to his feet and limping his way at top speed to his bedroom. “
John whistled softly. “Didn’t miss much,” he commented.
“Sorry,” said Sherlock, mouth quirking up at the edges. “But the walls have eyes. And ears.”
“That’s not a lead,” said Lestrade.
~o~O~o~
“Fine.”
“Uh?” said Lestrade, giving John a weird look.
Once Sherlock left to meet Lestrade, John busied himself by puttering around the flat, as he usually did. He made tea (as usual), tidied his room (as usual), checked the neatly-arranged stack of papers and IDs Mycroft had made for him (as usual), made more tea (as usual), and finally gave up on finding something new to do before settling in to write. He picked up his notebook—which he wrote in almost daily, if only for something to do while Sherlock had puzzles to solve without John’s help—and sat back in his usual armchair. He scribbled down some halfhearted notes about the results of the last puzzle, with a handful of choice words about Gruner, but before long he was gazing absentmindedly out of the new windows at the street beyond the glass.
Sherlock hurriedly dug in his pocket, fishing out an ID badge. He made a habit of swiping them from Mycroft—more to annoy him than anything else—but now he had cause to use it. “We have to find my brother,” he said to John, and he set off again with the badge now in hand, in the direction of Moran’s cell. John jogged behind him, keeping pace. He didn’t ask about the ID as they reached the nearest checkpoint, and Sherlock mutely swiped the badge in the card reader. The door unlocked with a click, and they moved on.
John shifted his feet, apologetic. “Mycroft’s right. If I’m supposed to be lying low and everything you need for work is here, then we need to get it cleaned up. So either Mycroft helps or we do it ourselves. And I’d like it done right. To me, it’s worth a short delay.”
, and a fraction of a second later, the windows at Sherlock’s back were blown in.
“I want to help you stop him,” said Soo Lin, and for the first time since she had walked through their door, she suddenly sounded fierce.
And angry.
Amberley showed John to the master bedroom, where clothing had been very quickly pulled from drawers, scattered across the floor. “She packed light,” said Amberley simply. “Not much gone.”
John groaned and laid back on the sofa.
“He did,” confirmed John. “Which is why I’m here and the rest of them are up there making sure none of your kidnappers come to finish us off.”
John shook Lestrade’s hand. “Not your fault,” said John. “You had no way to know I was in the dark.”
“But justified.”
This was how, at this time known as "Now", the Detective was in a cab pulling up to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, where he got out and strode in to the morgue, the collar of his long black overcoat popped up and his signature blue scarf knotted around his neck. His icy blue eyes were shockingly bright under his mess of curly dark hair. Coupled with being tall, thin, angular, and as haughty-looking as ever, Sherlock Holmes somehow fit in just perfectly at the morgue.
Thanks so much for reading, and thanks for your comments, kudos, subs, and support!!! <3
“He—I give up.”
But Sherlock held his ground. “I’m hardly changing the subject. It’s changed from ‘what happened to John Watson’s body’ to ‘what happened to John Watson’s body’. I don’t expect you to be a genius, Lestrade, but I would expect you to understand the reflexive property of mathematics.”
“Okay, I’m going to clean them before I wrap them,” said John, upending the antiseptic for a second to wet the cotton ball covering the opening before he set the bottle down. “Might sting a little,” he added, cautiously holding Sherlock’s arm still with one hand as he touched the cotton ball to the lacerations on Sherlock’s wrist.
“… Aneurism?” they all repeated in unison.
This was all insane.
“I’ll try to be quick,” said John. He stood and walked to the kitchen table, fishing a credit card out of Sherlock’s wallet. “You’ll be okay? Promise you won’t go charging off?”
“Yes?” Sherlock ventured tentatively. “That’s… sort of obvious.”
Gruner set the Ming dish down and sat back in his chair, smiling. “You have a good eye.”
and back to our previously scheduled freakout
“Can you what?” Mycroft spluttered, in a tone of voice that one might have expected if Sherlock had asked to borrow one of his legs.
It's been an eternity since I updated and for that you have my deepest apologies D: I'm so sorry for the delay (I feel like this happens a lot…)! I had several very busy weeks of work and travel, and then since then I have been in the process of finishing a paper for publication, and it’s been sucking the life out of me for a few weeks. Somehow spending all day writing about my opinion on iron meteorites usefulness (or lack thereof) in climate modeling is not inspiring me to write much of anything at all, even something much more fun. :P When work-writing is going poorly, it's hard to feel good about fun-writing.
The bed was deserted, and Soo Lin’s few belongings were gone from the bedside table.
"Lots of blood. Lots of trauma. Lots of horrible injuries."
“You have questions, I assume,” interrupted Sherlock before John could start.
She slammed the door, and Sherlock could feel it reverberating through the air and in his very bones.
John was stony-faced.
“I’m guessing I get killed,” said Sherlock simply, watching Moriarty’s progress.
“I told him John’s a friend. I said he’s new in town and he happened to be the concerned neighbor who noticed your absence, and that I brought him along because he volunteered and happened to have a medical background.”
Mycroft hesitated, for just a second, and then rolled his eyes in exasperation. “Sure. You can reanimate the dead. That explains everything.”
The needles.
John stalked over to the phone and picked it up. Sherlock raised a hand, holding it out expectantly, eyes still fixed on the violin, and John tossed it to him.
Everything was moving to surround him. From every angle, he was under scrutiny, and it was only now becoming clear how dangerous that could be. It was difficult enough keeping Moriarty and his network at bay; keeping Mycroft out was an entirely different beast.
“It’s a challenge,” said Sherlock, trying to be patient in spite of the fact that John felt a million miles behind him already. “It’s an invitation to play. A little puzzle of sorts. Every case we’ve encountered that bears Moriarty’s signature is one where we had to extrapolate his involvement, or make educated guesses, or we’ve stumbled across him. But this is a puzzle directly from him.”
incredibly—you’re the one who sits staring at nothing for hours!” said John, a little indignantly, though still smiling. It was ridiculous, he thought, how much better he felt after a ten minute conversation with the man.
John swallowed, trying to think. “… Or.”
“You’re sure you’re all right?” asked John, as they watched Lestrade disappear into the building.
“He’s had a very good two years,” said Mycroft sourly.
“I do,” conceded Sherlock. “If you’re concerned for your safety, or anyone else’s for that matter, I’m sure you could ask Mycroft for some additional security in your personal life.”
An unlikely bond had formed, and with it had come the promise of a (very slightly) lowered rent on an apartment in central London, should Sherlock ever find himself wanting a new place to live.
“Yes, obviously
“Have I?” said Sherlock.
—just be able to help me uncover if you’d only
“Some,” said Sherlock flatly, and that was all John needed to know that Sherlock’s mood hadn’t improved in the slightest.
“Connie Prince,” said Mrs. Hudson. “Oh, I just love her. She really knows how to do your colors. Why, I was just telling John—“
The only solution was to understand. And to understand everything.
are you seriously sassing me right now, Sherlock Holmes
“Do you know what we’re supposed to be looking for, by any chance?” asked Lestrade.
Sherlock scowled. “No. I don’t.”
“I can see that now,” Sherlock conceded.
But, Sherlock knew, that if they both were alive, then that meant someone else, somewhere near the building, was dead. However, this
All he knew was that he did not want to find out.
Mycroft wordlessly stepped back from the door and several more people came through, hurrying to John and immediately starting to disable the explosives beneath the jacket.
It was a photograph of himself, from the shoulders up.
~o~O~o~
“Just a guess,” said John, with a brief smile. He circled to stand on the side of the table opposite from Sherlock, leaning against the tabletop slightly and holding his own mug of tea. “I’m glad, though. Considering how easy it was for you to figure me out last night, it’s nice to know I can attempt to do the same to you. Attempt.
“But,” Mycroft added, dragging John’s attention back to the present, “you can expect to hear from me, should things be set into motion.”
John nodded too. “Okay. Weird.” He shoved his hands deep in his pockets. “And then it flashes dark when we die again.”
John swallowed, and pushed against the door. It swung forward at his touch.
Soo Lin nodded again. “We marked your door so each of us would know where to find you. And so you would know that we would be aware of your movements.”
Sherlock raised his hands to shoulder height and took a few steps back as Gruner rounded the desk. In spite of the gun pointed at him, Sherlock felt in control. Gruner was the one in over his head.
“Which is?”
Watson watched Sherlock, equal parts shocked at the rather impartial recounting of his - well, murder? death, at least - and fascinated at the detail to which this man was describing something he had never witnessed. He could see it all panning out in his mind, as Sherlock described it, the missing pieces falling gently into place. He remembered the heat radiating off the sand, the whisper of the wind and the crackling of the dying fires from the explosion that had wounded the informant, the rattling gasp of the informant's breath as he seized John's arm. The light, the flash, the pain. But now he could envision how his death fit into this vivid image in his mind. After all, it felt as though he had just been there only a few minutes ago.
i’m just gonna… lie down… and cry now… thanks…
, because he had not been able to choose with Lestrade and John—they turned him away.
John took a deep breath and sank back in his chair, waiting and watching the doors in case there was any word about Soo Lin.
Sherlock turned to look at him, and was startled by the panic on his face. “What?”
That being said, he had not anticipated this.
… All right, having the gun wasn’t so comforting after all.
After a moment’s pause, Sherlock quietly got up, heading out of the room. He patted the skull on the mantel as he went, turned off the kettle, and then he retreated to his bedroom, and closed the door with a gentle click.
“You boys were out early,” she said brightly, waving with the duster. “I was just tidying a little. Not that I’m your housekeeper, of course…”
“But,” Moran continued, shrugging, “I guess people become interesting when two psychopaths who can bring back the dead try to recruit the same person. Even if it
Sherlock didn’t wait around to hear the rest of whatever it was Mycroft wanted to say. He took off once again, John close behind him, and they made their way out to a carpark just north of the building. “Why do they all drive the same stupid car?” he demanded, turning on the spot to look at a row of a few dozen nondescript black sedans. He jammed his finger onto the ‘panic’ button on the key, and the horn of one of the cars halfway down the line began blasting.
Sherlock replied by holding up one of the little pill bottles and waving it in front of Lestrade’s nose.
The look on Soo Lin’s face was enough to confirm that suspicion.
“Can you do so now?” asked John, striving to be gentle.
There was a flash of golden light, and the plants became green and healthy, leaves unfurling like spring had just arrived all at once, the flowers blooming anew, withered petals turning bright as if in their prime.
John thought he could see now why Sherlock had shown Mycroft how his Gift worked in the way that he had. Mycroft could find a way to tear down any argument that wasn’t made of concrete—or, thought John, made of something living that could argue for itself. Maybe seeing it had frightened Mycroft, but he would never have believed Sherlock without the proof. Mycroft
Soo Lin sat up a little. “I mean it. Thank you both, for everything. I would not be here now if you had not agreed to help me.”
Mrs. Hudson deposited their cups of tea on the table along with a plate of biscuits. She took her own cup and a biscuit for herself and rounded the table. “Well, I’d best be off. I’m meeting Mr. Chatterjee later and I don’t want to be late… I’ll pop back up this evening and check on you.”
Sherlock responded by slouching miserably in his armchair. “It is.”
sorry, Mrs. Hudson,” said Lestrade. “But—“
John swallowed and looked away. “But you knew it would happen.”
“Then what’s the point poking and prodding?”
Sherlock noticed. “You aren’t dreaming,” he said exasperatedly.
“Mm,” hummed Sherlock. “And it’s not the only horrifying thing about him.”
Sherlock considered this for a moment, and then he sighed. “All right. Just be direct. Under an hour, if you can. You’re not supposed to be out where you can be seen, but if we’re going back to the drawing board, then we might both be lying low for a while. So just make it fast. You can use my card.”
“I’m really not sure why we’re arguing about this.”
“Clearly I made a good call. Would you have even woken up if Lestrade had called?” asked John rhetorically, and the Union Jack pillow that flew across the room to smack him in the face was an acceptable admittance of defeat.
Sherlock picked up his phone, and dialed Mycroft’s number.
~o~O~o~
had just - just… What just happened.
“You don’t think…?” began Lestrade, looking across the street again with a worried expression on his face.
exist, ergo it must be possible for
John threw his good hand in the air. “Right. Well, whenever you feel like actually clueing me in to whatever the hell is going on, let me know.”
He was almost – disappointed. About this. Sure, the woman had ordered him kidnapped and then killed only a few days ago, but he was certain—
Mycroft hesitated, and then he sighed. “You’ll know it when you see it. If your invitation is anything like the one MI5 received, it should be personalized.”
“Morgue?” John repeated, raising his eyebrows. Then: “Oh.”
“You started young, didn’t you?” John leaned forward, resting his elbows on the table. “So why would it seem important to you?”
just trust me
For someone who seemed fully against the idea of being ruled by emotions, Sherlock was certainly not handling them well now.
“The general consensus is that I am,” said Sherlock, in a blunt (and, though he’d never say it, borderline defeated) statement of the facts.
“It’s not like I asked for any of this,” said John, an uncharacteristic aggression in his voice. “I wasn’t planning on dying. That’s on you.”
“Doubt it,” he said.
the British government. More or less. Enough so that getting clearance for something like this isn’t even remotely difficult for him. And a criminal mastermind like Moriarty sending a sniper to run his errands is close enough to a terrorist threat for the British government. For my brother, at the very least. No one who knows anything about this mess with Moriarty would be stupid enough to think that anything less than the highest levels of security is inadequate.” He popped the collar of his coat, and started forward. “Come on.”
“You always serve a purpose,” said Sherlock, in a tone that said it was idiotic that John needed to be told this.
“I do not.”
“I’m sorry,” she said, and she genuinely looked it. “Everything was sealed right after the body was taken. I don’t have access to anything anymore. Anything that was left was taken and all of his documentation was removed and classified. I don’t know how you’d get access now, to be honest.”
!" shouted Lestrade after Sherlock, but Sherlock ignored him, and finally the inspector sighed and walked off in the direction of his own car, shaking his head.
John made some tea for each of them, and set a few biscuits on a plate to have with it. He brought out Sherlock’s tea and the biscuits, setting them down on the coffee table in front of Sherlock, before returning to the kitchen to get his own tea. Finally he joined Sherlock in the living room. He perched on the arm of his own chair, glancing at Sherlock and trying to assess his condition.
Still, a terrorist threat in the heart of London… It could be promising, he couldn't deny that.
“After all,” said Mycroft. “Why, on that particular mission, would you have chosen to fake your death? Are you working with someone? Spying for someone? Or perhaps just simply actively undermining the efforts of intelligence agents. And then, if your reasons for faking your death are noble, as you’ll certainly try to argue, why not go to the police? The government? Your superiors? No, instead you seek out the help of a private detective and try to fall off the grid. Your actions reek of espionage. Crime.”
The next chapter will be on time, however!
John expresses his stress in the form of limitless snark, clearly
“Now we all know where we’ve been. And now, I have things to attend to,” said Sherlock curtly, and he turned and started to climb the stairs.
“… Yes.”
John almost laughed. “You have no idea how much I wish I knew the answer to that question. But it’s just me. It gets… complicated, for the people Sherlock brings back to stay alive for long. Really complicated.”
John nodded. “Okay. So, stay here and out of sight.”
“Well, he also happens to be one of the wealthiest men in western Europe,” said Sherlock.
This all seemed a hundred times more insane after a few hours of sleep.
“… You good?” said John tentatively after a few minutes.
John nodded reluctantly. “So if Moriarty
John frowned at him. “You’re sure?”
“… No.”
"Uh, I'm not, because they're just that," said Lestrade, interrupting. "They're just suicides."
Sherlock considered how to explain. He’d never done this before. He had told Lestrade of his gift, obviously, months ago, but he had never explained it to someone who had experienced it firsthand. Who was living it. ‘Living’ being the key word. “It’s difficult to explain,” said Sherlock at last, with a hint of hesitance in his tone. “It’s something of an ability of mine. The origin and reason are unknown, but quite frankly, that is the least concerning aspect of it.”
Mycroft sat back with a very tiny, very fake smile. “As I said a moment ago, there are only two possible explanations. Either you are the dead man in the photograph, or you are trying to be. Now, the dead man in the photograph is one John Watson, a military doctor, stationed and killed in Afghanistan. You seem to match the profile. You look like him, you conduct yourself like he would, and you’ve lived and worked at the very least similarly to him. But he’s dead.”
An intracranial aneurism certainly wouldn’t be operable. Sherlock’s understanding of medical science only extended as far as practicality for the sake of cases dictated, but even he knew the chance of successfully removing such an aneurism was essentially nonexistent. It could be asymptomatic. It may or may not be in the cabbie’s records. Really, it could happen to anyone.
have enabled you to achieve. Or the blatant lack of trust on your side of our business arrangement.
John swallowed.
Mycroft frowned slightly. “Or?”
And now we shift back to Moriarty, who (I'm willing to bet) isn't going to wait too terribly long before getting in touch with Sherlock... But we'll see~
“So it would seem,” said Sherlock.
Sherlock frowned deeply. “John?”
“Will there be more?” asked John, though he thought he knew the answer.
How is this going to be worse?
John considered this. “But, I mean, that’s nice and well and good and all, but this isn’t exactly an impartial experiment. I
Sherlock sprang to his feet in a flurry of disentangling limbs, and John jumped again, taken aback, and was even more taken aback when Sherlock flapped his arms frantically and hissed, “Go, go, get up, hide!
But, of course, the only two present were a bewildered Watson and the Detective, who had just stumbled across a case far more intriguing than he had ever expected.
(I sure hope you can explain your lapse in judgment, Sherlock
This bloody nose had occurred much in the same way as the three that predated it. Young Sherlock’s nose had (thanks to some of the older boys in the dormitory) connected with a fist that did not belong to him, as it was traveling towards his face in an attempt to rearrange some of its features.
“Did you think those sniper lights were for show?” asked Moriarty, his tone morbidly amused. “Did you think I wouldn’t? I could kill you, or John, and I still might. If you force me to. I said I could make you tell me how you did it, Sherlock. But I think I’d rather you
“Sangin,” repeated Sherlock. He looked up at John. “Well. Seems we’ve quite a bit of reading to do.”
Mycroft merely nodded.
About Watson.
“I was worried about you,” said the newcomer, standing up and lifting his umbrella, examining the tip of it with more visible interest than when he regarded Sherlock. “I thought I’d drop by rather than wait for the official report. And I knew you’d never let me know how you were getting on. I was concerned.”
The Detective, the Doctor, and the Inspector stood there, staring, hardly able to process what had just happened.
Sherlock strode over to his armchair by the window and dropped into it. “I underestimated her nosiness,” said the Detective, eyes shut.
means is immaterial. The important thing is that it’s a message obviously from the Black Lotus, and it’s on
John rolled his eyes, but went on, “Probably a man’s, judging from the size, but…” He looked more closely at the inside of the shoe. “There’s a name written here, so—well, a boy’s, since adults don’t write their names in shoes.”
“What?!”
Mycroft Holmes came into view in the back of the car, looking coldly up at John.
Sherlock shrugged. “It doesn’t. We can speculate as to why Moriarty would kill Powers all night, but we’re never going to be able to determine an answer from the data we have. Only Moriarty knows that. It could be a contract killing, a personal vendetta, a random act of cruelty, an act against the boy’s parents, it could be anything. We aren’t going to be able to figure out why. Not yet. We just have to figure out
I return at last! Thank you all for your patience over the last few weeks. I had knee surgery (an ACL replacement and meniscus repair, to be specific) at the end of August, which ended up being much more time-consuming, tiring, and painful than I was expecting. On the upside, I now have a set of very trendy scars, the surgery has so far been very successful, and I’m well into recovery. Just in time for my second attempt at my candidacy exam for my PhD, haha… just can’t catch a break…
John Watson's eyes opened.
Again, sorry for the delayed update! I promise to make it up to you all :3
Looking for silver linings here. ;D
But John heard him, and he too looked out the windows for a moment before looking back at Sherlock. “You don’t think it was an accident.”
And Moriarty, whoever they were, knew precisely how each and every single one of them would dance.
Young Sherlock countered the incoming hit by parrying it to the left. As his opponent stumbled forward a few steps, Young Sherlock sidestepped. As one movement, he jabbed one elbow, hard, into the soft tissue between shoulder and neck while he slammed his heel onto the other boy’s foot. He then turned in a calm half-circle and lightly kicked the back of the boy’s knees.
Note of caution: avast, thar be dead people ahead
“What do you mean by that?” Sherlock frowned.
It was almost noon on the second day when John heard signs of life from Sherlock’s bedroom. He was, again, in his chair—or at least the chair he had claimed, the one which faced the window—when he heard a thud from down the hall. He lowered his newspaper and peered over the back of the chair to see Sherlock staggering in from the washroom, hair curled every which way and eyes narrowed darkly.
“It’s been so nice getting to chat, John,” said the landlady, giving John a quick little hug, which he returned with the arm not in a sling. “You’re very much welcome here. We get all sorts here and you should be right at home.”
. He won’t need to be hidden from Moriarty, but it’s not as if he’s free to be John Watson. His old life is still over. Allowing him to reconnect with his family, or even just try for a normal life… these aren’t simple things. And it’s not like he’s a straightforward roommate, either. He comes with certain risks. Not to mention the condition of his…
Once you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be true.
John picked up a file, and glanced at the header. “I can’t imagine this is easy for him. I doubt he likes keeping secrets. Secrets this big, anyway.”
Sherlock gave her a reassuring look. “I’ve handled worse. The nightmare’s almost over, I promise.”
“Key,” John mouthed to Lestrade and Amberley, who had come up behind him. Amberley was white as a sheet; every slight thump from behind the strongroom door made him flinch.
Sherlock looked sour and didn’t move.
“A truly terrible boss,” he confirmed.
“So what do you want, exactly?” Mycroft said.
“I don’t particularly do small-talk,” said Sherlock distastefully.
Sherlock was perfectly fine.
He shut the fridge. He opened it again and stared for a moment.
“So we’re supposed to be interested in Gruner not because of his expertise in pottery, but because he’s a blackmailer?”
John waited, hovering anxiously by the entry to the kitchen.
a regular occurrence. That John was a singularity. That John was, somehow, for some reason, the exception to the Rules.
“We are not all fine,” snapped Sherlock. “The men downstairs. The ones you shot. I have a feeling they aren’t going to be there anymore.”
“I don’t think that anymore.”
. I don’t need to go upstairs to see that your flat is not equipped for ‘games’ of this nature. I can see the windows blown out from here, and I can infer the likely interior da—“
They made their way back to the car, intending to go to Baker Street in case she had made her way there. In the car, Sherlock rattled off observations about her room and absence—it had been quiet, there was no sign of a disturbance, she was in stable health that morning, that wing of the hospital was full of people, and on and on—that meant she was fine. John didn’t contribute or interrupt. The only indicator of his stress was how steady his hands were, folded in his lap.
“… M’kay,” said John, clearly not understanding. “I’ll just be here, then. I can move my things upstairs and get started on my shoulder with whatever supplies you and I have got.” He hesitated, and added, “Do you have a computer I could use, maybe?”
Sherlock’s hand shook more violently.
“Just trying to make light of the situation,” said John, taking a step forward to look more closely at the drying paint.
I am a university student working on her thesis (ughhh), so updates will be irregular/as often as I can make them!
“Another pair of eyes would be… helpful,” said John when he returned, dressed in all black and with a scarf around his neck (Lestrade resumed staring at John and Sherlock in confusion).
John threw his hands in the air. “Are you always this blasé about innocent people dying?”
John did a double-take. “What for? I didn’t do anything.”
John blinked, and then ran after him, clutching his bag in his right hand and running as fast as he could.
It was a few days before Lestrade arranged for their trip to the morgue.
John set the shoe back on the table. “That’s it. That’s all I’ve got. How did I do?”
at this rate, i'll be bald before this is over
In the back of his mind, John could remember hearing horror stories about captured soldiers blinking messages in Morse in videos that were to be sent home. When your script is written for you, there are only so many ways to talk without words.
“Not quite,” said Sherlock absently.
Incoming call.
“This is ridiculous,” said John, without any feeling to it. How was he supposed to defend himself against something like this?!
“If you would let me finish,” Sherlock cut in tersely. “
Moran looked at the box. “Not much use without a lighter,” he said.
Sherlock returned to 221B some time later, with a few bags of groceries in each hand to find John waist-deep in old case files dug out of the closet, a slice of cake from the bakery next door balanced precariously on top of the stack of files.
“Yeah, you damn well should.”
Sherlock’s elbows would not support him.
“No, I’m…” John didn’t finish the sentence, instead looking at Sherlock. He could see the injuries and every single one made him wince. If they had the time, he would do something about them now. But John knew what it was like to try to be a doctor in a place where bullets flying overhead was normal, and he knew when it was essential to stop and get to work and when it was essential to grab each other and run like hell first.
He’d just opened the door for her, never mind that he didn’t yet know what lay beyond. The Game was on, and Moriarty’s pawns were charging like idiots down the pitch. The Game was in check, and Sherlock wanted to make it checkmate so badly he could taste it.
. If we’re going to be inhibited in our investigations again, I’d at least like to be sure I’ve used all possible means of continuing before I have to fight with Scotland Yard over what
John returned a moment later, his arms full of towels and a glass of water and his bag and kit, to find Sherlock lying exactly as he had been. He deposited his armload of supplies on the coffee table in the living room, and brought the bathroom’s trash bin over as well. When Sherlock still didn’t respond, John retrieved the box of rubber gloves he’d taken from the cabinet under the kitchen sink, holding the box under his arm while he tugged a glove onto each hand. He rolled the gloves over the cuffs of his sleeves, covering his skin. He wasn’t sure how foolproof rubber gloves would be in terms of inhibiting the effects of Sherlock’s gift on a once-dead-now-alive-again individual, but it was the best he could think of, and he was willing to take the chance. A jacket had been enough to get them out of the Lucky Cat; surely, this would work just as well, if not better, considering rubber gloves were actually
“Which is why I’m talking to you, rather than killing you.”
“Liang was a member of the Tong. Of the Black Lotus. You have met him, though when you were introduced it is likely that he went by a different name.”
Lestrade shrugged, though his scowl relaxed a little. “I’m going to keep that in mind. But I guess we shouldn’t get too far ahead of ourselves just yet. You’re still the one in the most danger.” He led the way past a number of desks—Anderson sighed loudly and Donovan fixed Sherlock with a grimace as he passed—but Sherlock ignored them and filed after Lestrade into his office.
Shan exhaled a short humorless laugh. “Nothing is beyond his reach,” she said, eyes roving to the shattered window through which the bullet that killed her must have traveled.
Sherlock couldn’t speak.
Lestrade would have to find them himself.
“I suppose.” Sherlock ruffled his hair and added, a little hesitatingly, “I… appreciate the vote of confidence. And everything you did tonight. It didn’t go unnoticed.”
With his name.
“Obviously I haven’t finished investigating,” he said.
John scowled deeply and flashed Sherlock an exasperated look. “Tell me you’re joking. You’re not seriously expecting me to sit around here, for days, doing nothing,
Sherlock suspected John was still upset and Lestrade was coming to terms with the fact that he’d just shaken hands with someone who’s been dead at one point in time.
“It is,” said Lestrade, with enough conviction to pique Sherlock’s interest. “Just – trust me, it is. I’ll show you.”
“Oh, shut up.”
He didn’t know.
No one knew
, Lestrade," lamented Sherlock, thoroughly wishing he was at home studying his tray of toes.
“For however long I have to,” said Sherlock. “Days, weeks, whatever.”
By the time John caught up, Sherlock was unlatching a window, gently easing it open bit by bit.
Finally, John straightened, and heaved a deep breath, before taking the plunge.
Sherlock took a breath, ruffled his hair, and sat up in his chair. “All right. How do you know no one else has received instructions?”
Sherlock paused. He was surprised, for the third time in under ten minutes. Which was unheard of. He made a mental note of it, adding it to a file he was already compiling on the man before him.
“I have no idea how this is supposed to work, but good luck,” said John. “I’ll be here when you get back.
Something hot and angry rekindled in John’s chest. “Look, Sherlock, I’m not the idiot who got myself beaten to a pulp because I’m too stubborn to accept help,” he said, and he couldn’t quite stop a familiar bitterness resurfacing as he spoke. If Sherlock hadn’t left him behind, this might not have happened. If Sherlock had just told him where he was going, they might have rescued him much sooner.
?” said the boy in charge.
“That’s the real question,” said Sherlock. “And I…”
John tossed the lighter onto the table too.
M xoxo
“Rude!” scolded Mrs. Hudson, although there was a distinct blush in her cheeks now. “Although I was going to pop down, see about getting something for lunch tomorrow…”
Lestrade swore.
Moriarty sighed. “Let’s stop with the noble sacrifice nonsense, shall we? No one’s going anywhere.”
“They won’t.” Sherlock’s tone was flat. “He’ll be long gone by now. I just wanted them to leave.”
“Let’s go through what we know again.”
After a long moment, he turned and walked back towards 221B, until he reached the paper lying in the street. It had fluttered a few feet in the cab’s wake before coming to rest. Sherlock crouched, and picked it up, channeling every bit of his will into doing so with a perfectly steady hand.
Sherlock remained frozen for a few seconds.
John made a mental note to sort through the contents of the kitchen and bathroom cabinets. “Okay, well… Any chance we could find Moriarty prowling around the building on one of the security cameras?”
“I want to make sure you haven’t broken any ribs,” explained John.
“Call an ambulance,” John said firmly, glancing over his shoulder at the Detective. When Sherlock didn’t immediately leap into action, he said again, with even more urgency and authority, “Call an ambulance,
“Maximum pressure just under the half second,” Sherlock elaborated.
Sherlock spoke more animatedly as he continued, utterly wrapped up in the case now, the intricacy of the scene reconstructed in perfect detail in his mind. He did not need to have ever seen the place where it occurred; he could envision it in his mind with almost no effort. The wild desert terrain on the outskirts of the city, concealing a sniper lying in wait as the remains of a convoy were approached by armed soldiers and medical personnel. A man rushing to the side of a fallen target, who remained open to the skilled eye of an assassin. The sniper quickly lining up the shot, determined to remove any and all liability—

That being said, we always knew Mycroft was going to well and truly stick his nose in everyone's business.
John, who had watched Sherlock’s interactions with his landlady with an expression of amusement from the entryway to the kitchen, leaned on the back of the other armchair with his right arm, and raised an eyebrow. “Long day?”
There was one style in particular that struck a chord, so much so that Young Sherlock began practicing every chance he got. Books in the library became his instructor. Diagrams of men in tall hats and long suit coats, walking sticks elegantly in hand, beating the stuffing out of one another, became his inspiration. Baritsu became his pastime.
Sherlock got out his phone.
The cabbie smirked. “Are you telling me the police still haven’t figured it out? Hell, I
Sherlock heard more approaching footsteps. Three—no, four attackers, including the old woman. All light tread. Careful. Cautious. Measured.
Mycroft opened his mouth, and then he closed it.
to be done, and I needed to do it. I wasn’t
Sherlock slowly sat down on the floor, sinking down as he sank deeply into the depths of his mind, the transition like plunging into a pool and watching the physical world become more and more distant as he submerged.
She had been standing in the room sometime during the night. With trembling fingers she had held the phone up to her ear.
Sherlock blinked, and stopped a mere breath short of Watson's skin.
SHERLOCK
Soo Lin raised her gaze, eyes bright. “He is not dead on your order,” she said. “My brother was an assassin. Death was always a possibility. He knew that, and so did I. Death was always possible. But… not like that.”
“I remember.”
Moriarty nodded, seeing the comprehension dawning on Sherlock’s face. “Perhaps I shouldn’t assume, but if you bring back the dead the same way I do, then you only have another thirty-four seconds before someone drops dead. Now, I don’t think my own Gift can kill me, and we four are the only ones within range. Which means in… twenty-nine seconds, either you or John will be dead.”
Initially, John didn’t take much notice. But when it kept buzzing, he started glancing up every time, counting each incoming message. All of them went unanswered.
They held eye contact for a brief moment, and then Mycroft nodded. “He’s gone,” he said, before erupting into a fit of coughing. John stepped forward to hover concernedly at Mycroft’s side, but Mycroft continued, his voice raspy, “The details can wait. What’s important is that a guard was compromised, and released him. Moran disarmed him, took his weapon, and killed him as he fled. His escape coincided with the blast.”
Sherlock ground his teeth. “What did you tell him?”
“Clearly not,” said Sherlock, shifting uncomfortably.
“Yeah, they do. And it’s also what matters,” said John sharply. “It’s why Sherlock’s spent the last two days trying to come to terms with the fact that you hate him for being honest with you for the first time in years.”
On screen, Moran looked up at John—the door clicked shut, with a second resounding
“You can’t touch me and I don’t need help, so just let me be,” the Detective snapped, so John simply stood to the side to let him get his footing.
“I’m sorry, you come around to the idea of someone murdering a little boy a lot faster than I do,” said John, just a little cross.
And, looking at his irate teachers, Sherlock understood that they, like his classmates, would never understand.
“I’m starting to, yeah,” said Lestrade. “Which means we need to be more careful about this. And I need to be more involved.”
At last Sherlock thought he understood. He sank back into his chair. “You think he’s going to cut the Black Lotus loose. He’s going to cut his losses.”
~o~O~o~
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD
“Do you think,” Moriarty went on, watching John’s face in profile, “your pet would die if I touched him?”
"Being shot," snapped Sherlock, massaging his temple. Other than a little swelling, no damage had been done. The shock was more noteworthy.
“You mentioned a doctor a moment ago, Mr. Amberley? Could you…?” John prompted.
(See the end of the chapter for
. My brother doesn’t have friends or associates. To my mind, the only question is whether he’s willingly gotten himself involved in whatever scheme you’re piloting or you’re blackmailing him.”
“You’ll note the characteristic blue cobalt underglaze and the delicate lines on the lotus and hibiscus decorating the rim. Authentic Ming,” said Sherlock, as Gruner carefully opened the box and lifted out the little saucer. “Yongle, to be precise. And part of a complete set.”
Sherlock strained harder, feet pressed against the beam at his back, the full weight of his body now employed in escaping the handcuffs.
“John Watson’s body is gone,” said Lestrade in a tone of measured civility. “And I have a horrible feeling you know why.”
“His purpose had expired,” said Moriarty, with a careless shrug. “All people can be replaced. Especially when they’re just self-serving businessmen. It was worth a few million pounds. You’re worth quite a lot, to me.”
“This is my fault,” said Sherlock.
It was obvious now. Things were always obvious in hindsight. “Clearly you got the information you needed to get inside,” said Sherlock. “Since the three of us are standing here as a result.”
“Because this is Moriarty we’re talking about,” Sherlock snapped impatiently. “Because he readily admitted to having me watched and followed, and to bribing and threatening the people Mycroft so
"What was
"Uh…" Watson tried a tiny, confused smile. "A handshake?"
“Allow me to explain,” said Sherlock, settling back with a grin.
And quite quickly.
“I…” John turned his gaze back to Moran’s face on the monitor. “I don’t know.”
"Me? No, no, it's no trouble," replied Molly predictably.
“I already know—“
The original minute had long since passed.
Mycroft rolled his eyes. “Have you thought about what happens to him after all of this?” he asked. “Assuming both of you live, and Moriarty is out of the picture.”
There was a long pause.
He snapped his fingers again.
“Meaning the moves we make right now are the moves that determine how the rest of the game will play out,” said Sherlock.
Sherlock closed his eyes. "Oh,
This was only going to get more complicated. And he hadn’t even gotten to start on the case yet.
“Oh, dear, did I scare you? Did—hang on, maybe the mic is on too loud. Maybe – maybe I should…” The voice dropped to a whisper. “Maybe I should talk like this. Is that better?”
John was afraid to say anything. It was, in a way, like dealing with Mycroft all over again. Except that as bad as revealing Sherlock’s secret would have been then, this would be a thousand times worse. Moriarty had no way to know how John had really come to be living at Baker Street. And John wasn’t going to tell him. If he was going to die, the only thing he could do now was make sure he didn’t give Moriarty any information on Sherlock that he didn’t already have.
John waved dismissively and retreated into the house (to find shoes and something to clean the door with, undoubtedly), and Sherlock hopped into the cab. The taxi pulled away from the curb, leaving Baker Street and its watching eyes behind.
After all, weren’t they worth more than this? More than dying because they had the misfortune, knowingly or not, to be in Moriarty’s way? Than being killed because they’d tried to
“Aren’t you?”
To those of you reading - thanks! And to those of you who kudos and comment and so on, thank you thank you thank you! It means so so much to me :3 <3
A cup of tea would be even better.
“With getting deployed to Sangin,” replied John.
Sherlock pressed one of his hands over hers (after only a fleeting hesitation) in what he thought might be a vaguely comforting gesture. “He’s not going to get away.”
“So you probably want to know how I did it,” said Hope, scrutinizing Sherlock with an unexpected sort of glee. “You wouldn’t be asking me if you’d already figured it out.”
But Soo Lin shook her head. “I have limited time no matter what. In a community like ours, small as it is, there are too many secrets between us for me to be able to leave. As I see it, my time is limited already. My best chance is to help you.”
God, what he’d do to have some quiet. Surely, his body could fix itself. It was all just transport, anyway…
chose the route that makes you nameless and faceless and alone by necessity.
“Any news on the Watson body?” he asked automatically, without giving it much thought.
“I’d hate to be irritated,” said John. “Now get out of here and go meet Lestrade.”
John’s mouth twitched in a sad little smile. “Oh God yes.”
Sherlock raised his brows in some surprise; considering what time it was. John did not have a phone, and Lestrade was undoubtedly asleep at this hour of the night. His Homeless sometimes contacted him by text, but even so, this was unusual. Sherlock did not have any friends he texted with. He did not have anyone he regularly kept in contact with who was not either directly involved with his work or, at present, living in the same building as he was.
“Look,” he said. “I’m cleaning up your mess here. I’m not going to argue with you.” Lestrade glanced at the stairs. “Does he seriously want me to sneak him back to the morgue so he can talk to the cab driver? Because that’s ridiculous.”
“Now say, ‘Nice touch, this. The pool. Where little Carl died.’,” said Moriarty.
“I win, you know,” said John lightly.
But, unexpectedly, the cabbie interrupted.
But John had killed them, instead.
Sherlock tore his eyes from Zhi Zhu Yao so he could stare at Moriarty. “I…” He could barely get the words out. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
John jumped at the abrupt voice, even though he’d been waiting for it and expecting it for a small eternity. He straightened, adrenaline picking up where it had left off and soaring to new heights. He glanced anxiously at the door.
“I am. Just me, my wife, and our dogs.”
Sherlock suddenly stood. “Good. Yes. You do that. I need to go out.”
“That so?” said Sherlock, making note of this. Army doctor trained at Bart’s. Factoring his age and fleeting pause at every hallway intersection, an alumnus returned for the first time, then, and not entirely sure of the building’s layout.
Sherlock sucked in air to issue an indignant ‘Obviously’, but instead the viscous air dragged its way into his lungs and he exploded into a fit of coughing. He waved a dismissive hand in between coughs.
He glanced at the clock on the screen. Midnight was still some hours away, but it still wasn’t much time.
“I’d sooner jump off the roof,” came Sherlock’s sour drawl from the foot of the stairs, and the Detective straightened, coming forward to meet Lestrade.
I could. It wasn’t enough, but I tried. And…” He trailed off.
He’d been so sure John was about to make some sort of accusation. He’d been certain. And instead, he’d found himself surprised again.
This was not happening. This
Sherlock frowned. “I can’t explain it. I just do it. But I think in a different way. I think without all of those stupid limits other people make. I don’t ask if it’s possible, I assume that it is, and then I make the logical connections. And I pay attention. It’s a matter of remembering things. Stupid people remember things based on a system of necessity—what’s important, what isn’t important. I count all physical things as important. I didn’t put limits on things. So when I’m studying something I don’t have to try to create a parallel from scratch. I don’t have to go out on a limb.”
“I don’t fully understand why,” said John.
“And what does Moriarty mean?”
“Loading dock,” said Lestrade, watching Sherlock suspiciously.
(See the end of the chapter for

Sherlock raised an eyebrow again. “As in the case, or as in your wife’s affair with her personal trai—“
“All right?” John prompted. “You’re still running on adrenaline. You’re going to need time to wrap your head around all of this. It’s a lot to take in. Moriarty is a lot to take in. Tea will help. Planning will help. And we can do some of that together, okay?”
John shuddered.
“Why the hell did Moriarty just give you a million-pound dish?”
SOMETHING GOOD HAD TO COME OF ALL THIS
“Don’t panic just yet,” said Sherlock, peering at the numbers on the keypad. “Most of these operate on a sixty-second timer, so ideally we have another fifty seconds or so.”
John’s mind raced, alarmed. There wasn’t supposed to be anyone else in the flat, he was sure of it. Sherlock hadn’t told him what to do if there were people in the flat. Which there

back from the dead if they continue chucking things at sleeping people, John picked up the box that Sherlock had thrown and examined the packaging. He stopped, and looked up at Sherlock with a confused frown. “A phone?”
But it was now obvious, horrifyingly obvious, that they hadn’t made a plan for if the world came through the door.
Sherlock knew, with a few glances back over his shoulder after a solid fifteen minutes of running, that they were not being pursued. For the sake of being absolutely certain, he slowed his pace but did not actually stop for several more minutes. John caught up, until the two of them were moving along at about the same speed. Every time a particularly fast-moving car drove up the road behind them or someone exited a building talking a little too loudly, they sped up again. They kept going until, finally, Sherlock slowed and then stumbled to a halt at the front steps of a set of nice looking flats over a small café and deli (a place called Speedy’s, closed for the night). Gold letters on the door were just legible in the dim light of the street lamps, spelling ‘221B’.
~o~O~o~
Soo Lin nodded.
“Ta da,” he said awkwardly.
Thank you all so much for your feedback, it means a lot! :D <3
“Something bad?” suggested Sherlock. “Just look at these shoes. He loved these shoes. Why would he take care of them so religiously and then abandon them? So we have a boy with big feet and eczema who—“ Sherlock stopped dead, eyes wide with sudden comprehension. “Oh.”
“Let’s make a deal,” offered John. “You keep me up to date with
. That looks like it hurt.”
“No need to be so antagonistic about it,” said Sherlock loftily. “You may,” he said, when John’s only reply was yet another raised eyebrow.
“But we both know that’s not true, is it,” replied Sherlock. “You wouldn’t be in here talking to me if I had nothing. Your hideout here, the people who came in here to ‘intimidate’ me—“ Sherlock took care to stress the ridiculousness of this concept “—and even you. You’re telling me everything and you don’t even realize it. You just know every second you have me here is another second you’re making mistakes. You might as well put me in contact with Moriarty right now. I’m sure he and I are both dying to have a chat.”
His feet had barely touched asphalt when Sherlock took off down the alley, his dark coat billowing out behind him.
If he was honest, Sherlock had found it disappointingly so. He’d been anticipating some greater resistance, but instead, it was all a little too easy.
Sherlock and Moriarty eyed one another for a moment.

The woman nodded again. “Yes. He is… that is, he
What's this, an update that's on time?! A MIRACLE
Mycroft stopped at the expressions on their faces. He frowned. “What? What’s wrong?”
The Detective thought.
!” bellowed Lestrade, just as the Detective vanished out the door at the far end of the hall, the door swinging shut with a loud click.
“Sorry,” said John, looking around as he tried to blink the sleep out of his eyes. “Do you know when Sherlock got back?”
Lestrade snorted. "Your cab, then?"
don't you have governments to run
Inside was a layer of protective foam with a depression in the center. Resting there, perfectly situated, was a small piece of pottery—a delicate bowl made of painted white and blue porcelain. Atop the bowl was a small, unsealed envelope made of heavy stationary. Sherlock’s name was written on the outside of the envelope. Sherlock picked it up, turning it over in his hands a few times, and finally opened the envelope, pulling out a single piece of paper.
And so, Captain John Watson had been unable to tell anyone it was "M", whatever that meant.
“Greg. Greg Lestrade. How many times do I have to remind you his name is Greg?”
When they had reached 221B, however, and paid the fair and stepped inside, John broke the silence with the only word that had meant much of anything to Sherlock for the last half hour.
I’m being watched.”
“I don’t remember that being an option,” said Moriarty curtly.
“I might not phrase it that way, but yes,” said Sherlock. “Every reaction has an equal and opposite reaction. Including restoring life, it seems.”
“Yeah. Today, too,” said John.
John’s legs shook as he stared down at the assassin lying next to him, his mouth open in horror.
“I want to know how you did what?” demanded Sherlock, all thoughts of issuing a proper apology or giving John the chance to speak to the cabbie lost in the thrill of the case. Although, fortunately, John seemed too preoccupied with the cabbie’s words to object.
John nodded—while Sherlock mumbled something like “I do not
“And if Moriarty is as dangerous as we all think he is, I don’t want you in over your head,” Lestrade went on, his fingers drumming nervously on the steering wheel.

, because he estimated he had about ten seconds before people on the street started noticing there was a dead man on the pavement.
"Maybe the real story will be told," Sherlock shrugged. "Someday. What does it matter if anyone knows who really solved it? All that matters is that it was solved."
“Oh. If you insist,” Mycroft said, looking mildly surprised.
“Moriarty,” said Sherlock.
,” he sighed, but he wasted no more time before shouldering his bag, swinging down onto the ladder as well, and climbing down as fast as he could, until he joined Sherlock at the bottom.
“Obviously.”
Sherlock took a deep breath—barely, but John let it count—and John couldn’t feel or see anything obviously wrong, nor could he hear anything in Sherlock’s intake and release of air that suggested internal problems. He reached into his medical kit, glad that of all of his possessions, this was the one he still had. He brought out a stethoscope and donned it.
Five minutes.
So to new readers: welcome! To old readers: welcome back! <3 I love you all
"What?" said Watson without thinking about the actual question at all, evidently still unsettled by the revelation that he had just been and would soon go back to being dead.
Sherlock glanced at the letter. “I suppose it’s a little unusual as far as greetings go, under the circumstances.”
“That’s – that’s not funny,” said Lestrade.
“Good.”
The circuitry of Sherlock’s mind stopped. Every program froze. Every thought stopped and stared, and even his lungs ceased their functions for a moment, as he looked at John.
“Thank heavens,” said Amberley. “I was beginning to think she’d never be found. I never much liked banks, so I kept all my savings in that strongroom. Don’t know what I’ll do without it. Pension’s not much.”
It was like the air in his lungs had been replaced with lead. The thought hadn’t even crossed his mind, but now… He spun about to look at Mycroft, cutting him off mid-sentence with a loud, “Can I borrow your car?”
There's another puzzle coming up (you called it, Sherlock), but this one is less directly transcribed from TGG. I shall say nothing more on the subject for now; you'll just have to wait and see what insanity I've got in store.
The rent was borderline barbaric, but the space worked well.
“Uh…” said Lestrade, clearly at a loss for words. “Case… Case…” He seemed to come to his senses, and shook his head as if doing so would restore normality. “Right,” he continued. “Yes. This man here says his wife’s gone missing, possibly run away with the neighbor. She’s run with a large sum and a lot of securities, and he’s willing to pay just about anything if you can find the two of ‘em.”
Sherlock didn’t know.
“You too, I suppose,” said Sherlock, with a grudging smile. “Now stop sounding all considerate, it’s making me nauseous.”
Mycroft rolled his eyes. “I can assist with getting your residence repaired. But you can’t use the space for work until it is safe to do so.”
Mycroft gave John an icy look. “I don’t intend to debate how best to stop Sherlock from getting in over his head. Especially not with someone who lies at the root of the problem.”
Sherlock you seriously have to stop doing this to me, i can't handle the emotional roller coaster that is working with you
John looked surprised. “Of course I do. I’d be lying if I said any of this felt safe, but it’s… it feels important. I’m part of something a lot bigger than me, if only in a small way. Besides, Moriarty’s interested in
There was some part of Sherlock’s mind that felt a twinge of regret that John was on his own in 221B during this investigation. But Sherlock had never felt any desire to operate with another human being in tow. Especially one with an entirely unique and potentially catastrophic identity. Sherlock didn’t need help. After all, he knew no one who could keep pace with him. John was adept more than anyone Sherlock knew at surprising him, but what good would that do at the scene of a crime or in the midst of a chase? Little to none, he was willing to bet.
“John was picked up by Moriarty earlier today,” said Mycroft. “Apparently as incentive for a private meeting between Moriarty and my brother. A meeting none of us were made aware of until the last possible moment.”
The dead man was young—likely only his mid-thirties, approximately the same age as the Detective was—though with deep lines on his face that hinted at a certain seriousness in his personality. His blonde hair was cut short, his eyes were shut. He had a slight tan to his face which stopped at the neck.
“I was too distracted with… everything to think much of it yesterday. I was thinking about Moran and feeling sorry for myself and not paying attention. But I’m paying attention now, and now I’m realizing that you and Mycroft having a conversation for more than a few minutes is a rare thing. An hour seems like it should be unheard of. I feel like you’d only talk for that long if it was something worth worrying about. And if that

“I would strongly encourage you to go back through whatever unsolved cases you may have lying around,” said Sherlock. “See if there are any others were the cause of death was a .388 Magnum.”

in here.”
But John interrupted again, gesturing hopelessly at the door at the far end of the pool. “Sherlock, please,
“So where have you been?” asked John, before Sherlock could continue.
“Exactly.”
“There’s an exception to every rule,” said Sherlock.
“John,” cut in John flatly.
Caring is not an advantage.
Sherlock tilted his head to one side. “What’s your point?”
“I should be saying that to you,” Mycroft replied. His tone was decidedly indifferent, but there was something hard and blazing about his eyes. “It will be an immense inconvenience for me if you die sometime in the next few days. So do me a favor and do whatever it takes to ensure that that doesn’t happen. The moment things begin, I want to know.”
John's internal monologue:
“More or less,” said Sherlock. “It wouldn’t hurt to see if there were any other deaths in Afghanistan similar to yours, either. Though I doubt it. Your death was rather circumstantial. You were in the wrong place at the wrong time. Or, the right place at the right time, for us. For solving this.”
John opened his mouth, and closed it.
“So I’ve found I rather like being alive again and want to keep being alive for the time being.”
He had chosen this, Young Sherlock would remind himself, lying awake in the middle of the night, his heart heavy with a loneliness he had long since told himself was illogical and unnecessary, as well as painful. He had chosen this.
John nodded. He could not see how, and he had a feeling Sherlock didn’t know either. But it would have to do for now. It would have to be good enough.
John nodded again, expression blank, and then he finally heaved a sigh and turned away from Shan’s body, walking away. “Well, fuck that.”
“Do you understand quite what you’re doing?”
“So we can find our sniper if we can determine where he would have to set up to get a shot at Gruner,” Sherlock said, adrenaline making his thoughts race ahead. “A place within the reasonable radius of Gruner’s house, looking inward into an area of the house where Gruner is likely to spend a lot of time.” He only needed a second for deductions to race forward again. In his mind, a floorplan of Gruner’s house—easily conjured, from his trip into the house fifteen days earlier—materialized, and then around it formed a map of the surrounding streets and alleyways. He needed almost no time at all to locate the area with the greatest vulnerability and greatest access. “Gruner’s study. His office with his collection of ceramics. There’s a large window at his back on either side of his desk, and the entire room is filled with glass cabinets. Nothing obstructing his view and there’s almost a guarantee that Gruner will be in there on a regular basis throughout the day.”
He opened the door and found her seated at a chair in her little kitchen, evidently halfway through doing her dishes and now with one soapy rubber-gloved hand over her heart.
“I was wondering if I could look into a case from a while back,” said Sherlock. “I’d started work on it before and then got… sidetracked.”
For that matter, whenever Moriarty decided to bring about the beginning of the end, Sherlock suspected that it would be without layer upon layer of intrigue. Things would be clear, one way or another. It was all a question of anticipating Moriarty’s moves and countermoves before Moriarty could anticipate his.
“I just generally try to avoid my clients getting killed,” said Sherlock.
Lestrade turned to Sherlock, wearing a bewildered expression. “You
“Oh, he could,” said Sherlock, almost flippantly, and John immediately looked disconcerted. “But it’s almost certain that someone else would be much less talented, much more disposable, and liable to make mistakes. And all of that is worth keeping in mind.”
"Yes."
“… I didn’t anticipate her actually trying to touch me,” said Sherlock, still in shock. “None of them have ever done that. No one does that. Who does that?”
Well. Most of them.
At the exact same moment, there was a flurry of movement, the voices suddenly urgent, conflicting edges of anger and desperation—and then there was a scream.
“Yes.”
John squared his shoulders. “I’m already dead. Have been dead, I mean. People die in war.”
Lestrade stepped in and had Amberley cuffed within a few seconds. “Christ,” he apologized. “I didn’t expect him to—“
,” answered Sherlock wearily. “I only fell over, John.”
It reminded him of the pool.
Sherlock shut the book with a decisive snap. “Easy, then. If the plan changes but it’s not safe to contact me directly, leave me a message here or the museum. I’ll see it.”
“Right,” said John aloud, trying to keep panic at bay. “Right.”
compliment.”
oh my god Mycroft don't we have enough to deal with without you sticking your nose in everyone's business
John’s thoughts were limited.
Sherlock looked up. “What.”
“I hadn’t really thought about it,” he said.
A bullet hole in the center of the forehead.
The back of Young Sherlock’s head was pounding from the hit against the wall, but his blood was singing, and his Mind Palace had come alive so that the doors of opportunity opened. A voice in his mind, his own, whispered:
“Good question,” said John, moving to clear off the coffee table while Mrs. Hudson held the tray out for him.
“I know Moran had help. Where he got it from is still to be determined,” said Mycroft coolly. “I acknowledge a failing in my security. But I will refrain from unnecessary speculation until I am in possession of more facts.”
Sherlock opened the door and stuck his head out, looking up and down the road. It was empty, the only movement from moths fluttering around the streetlamps in the cold autumn air. “It’s clear,” he murmured, stepping back for Soo Lin to pass him.
“Admittedly, money is rarely a factor in anything I do,” said Sherlock, standing and crossing the room to join his brother. “But I stand by the assertion that, if I make it through this, I think I will have thoroughly earned my non-existent pay. Now come along—I’ll walk you out.”
John retreated upstairs. He showered, removed his stitches, and bandaged the wound. He jotted down a few final notes on the way it had healed for Sherlock to peruse later. He dressed. He returned to the living room and read the newspaper. Then watched the news. Then paced.
“Good. I’ll put the kettle on.” John quickly made his way to the kitchen and turned on the kettle. He dug out mugs and a couple teabags from the cabinets, maintaining a somewhat forced façade of nonchalance.
One sentence stood out.
Sherlock took a deep breath and crossed his arms over his chest, glancing around the courtyard of frightened-looking men and women. “Moriarty must have gotten to someone. Threatened or offered enough to enlist their help.”
The room was silent for a moment.
John gave him a look. “Sherlock, if
It took him a final thirty seconds to shut everything and everyone out.
Sleep had done nothing to shorten the list of questions. In fact, there were more with each passing minute.
“No shit, Sherlock,” said John, but he was—unexpectedly—smiling.
~o~O~o~
Sherlock waited. But there was nothing. He heaved desperately against the handcuffs one more time, before a bullet rang out just beyond the door and punched a hole through the wood, dislodging the lock. Sherlock froze.
“Isn’t that good, then?” asked John.
Mycroft pondered this for a moment. “I’ll take your word for it.”
“Then explain it to me.”
Sherlock could see John’s hesitation, and instantly understood why.
“It’s virtually undetectable. No one would have even considered looking for it. And they didn’t have the shoes. It might have been on his skin, but it was more likely that it had moved to his bloodstream by the time he died, and who would suspect that the kid was murdered?” Sherlock had something of a triumphant gleam in his eye. “Remember the shoelaces?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Like you’re worried I’ll implode.”
But he had.
John settled himself on a different chair, opening up his notebook with an air of finality. “Take two,” he ordered, pointing at the bottle of pills with a pen. “You’ll be less miserable when you’re in less pain.”
Sherlock glanced at John; he could read that thought written across his face through the laughing, and something about it was – satisfying. John’s laugh sounded as genuine as his praise had earlier that day. “Welcome to London.”
He should have known better than to think he could go unnoticed while living with Sherlock. And he should have been better prepared. It was his life, after all—but it had never
“Most of them are useless,” said Sherlock dismissively. “I don’t need useless.”
John caught Sherlock’s eye, and nodded once in understanding. Shoulders squared, he opened his mouth to speak.
“I get that,” said John, smiling a bit. “So what now? Back to working on Moriarty?”
Moran opened the box of cigarettes. He tilted the box, preparing to slide a cigarette out, and then he paused. He set the box down instead, and eyed John. “I assume you want something. This isn’t a social visit.”
They would never understand him, because they were only seeing the boy who’d set the frogs loose in the biology lab, and not observing the frightened and lonely young boy with the improbable Gift.
He knew exactly where his gun was—loaded, in the cabinet beside the bed—and he made a beeline for it the moment he reached the top of the stairs, but something large slammed into him and bowled him over.
“But what’s so important about a pair of shoes?” demanded John, rather at a loss as to how this was supposed to be an exciting find.
Sherlock hesitated, then inclined his head. “Probably should try.”
“Tell me there are other people with you,” he said flatly, for once willing to let Lestrade and his pack of idiots see him in a difficult position, if it meant not dying and not seeing John drop dead at his feet trying to help. “People who won’t die on contact.”
The flat was quiet when he entered. For once, the television was off and the living room was unoccupied, Sherlock’s laptop on the coffee table and the kettle cold.
“Well, I saw them,” said John, eyebrows raised in alarm at the somewhat frenzied look on Sherlock’s face. “At the Lucky Cat after we rescued you. All of the broken items had price stickers on them with things like that written on them. I recognize them.” He gestured to the characters painted on the door. “Prices. So, must be numbers.”
Sherlock and John left Lestrade at the crime scene, with the intention of giving Lestrade a chance to arrange for tests and bullet examinations while they evaluated if and how Shan’s murder changed their game plan. In Sherlock’s opinion, the loss of Shan as a source of information constituted a significant setback, but the fact that she had been murdered at least painted a more vivid image of the kind of person Moriarty must be.
There was…
“Oh, don’t turn this into a big deal,” snapped Sherlock. “Just figure it out. John’s not going to let this go. I have to do something to broker peace, or it’s only going to be more tedious from here on out.”
“We’ll see you later,” said John, with a wave. “Thanks again for the tea.”
The door to the flat was open.
“I agree that a logical first assumption is that Moriarty would have a second to replace Moran,” said Sherlock. “But, personally, I don’t think he does.”
He raised his hand in a brief wave.
“… I don’t know.” Sherlock pulled his phone out of his pocket and hurriedly began to type out a message to Mycroft.
,” said John, nodding this time. “Oh. So it’s looking for more of the same.”
“What?”
John asked a few more times, and when he started to sound like a truly irritating broken record, Sherlock waved a hand dismissively and said flatly, “Not now.”
“Why tell me?”
The car pulled into a side street, and Lestrade rolled to a halt, parking the car and switching off the engine. He and Sherlock clambered out and glanced around, but the street was quiet, as usual, and they strode towards their destination—a building recently gutted for renovations, empty for weeks first due to delays with funding and now due to the fact that Shan of the Black Lotus Tong had been shot in the head in the foyer.
“I am thinking. Now hand me my phone.”
Sherlock grit his teeth, and rolled his ankles. Both clicked, and were stiff, and the right one hurt so much that he stopped after one rotation. He crossed his arms, and then uncrossed them quickly, his wrists, elbows, shoulders, and chest in particular all protesting with burning stabs of pain. “All fine,” he lied.
Soo Lin nodded.
Sherlock nodded and swept away. He made a beeline for the stairs the second he could hear the door of Lestrade’s office shut behind him, past every desk and office until he reached the quiet, empty stairwell.
"That's funny, because neither am I. But there's a matter of potential national security that has your name written all over it. Bart's in twenty, all right?"
But he could recall something of Dante’s
The idea of sleeping at all was almost appalling. John wasn’t sure he’d ever sleep again. He had so many questions he wanted to ask…
have a choice,” mumbled Sherlock, sinking low in his chair with a dark expression on his face. “This isn’t about them.”
ENTER: YET ANOTHER COMPLICATION IN THE FORM OF THE OLDEST HOLMES BROTHER
Sherlock’s heartbeat was loud in his ears.
This was why he never told anyone the Rules governing his Gift. Because it was impossible for people to understand, and it was impossible to explain or justify any action that was so outside the realm of acceptable possibility.
Soo Lin nodded in agreement. “Give me two days. If it is possible for me to get a location, I should have it by the third day.”
The ambulance arrived first. Sherlock heard the racket as paramedics attempted to forcibly open the door Sherlock had unlocked, and he hurried out of the room and back through the staff hallways to let them in. As the responders moved past him, Sherlock saw a number of police cars pulling up.
“Pissing him off to the point of making him careless is a good enough cause,” Sherlock pointed out. “The whole point was to get him talking. Which you definitely did. He said infinitely more to you than he did to any of the people Mycroft sent in there to interrogate him.”
Sherlock’s phone buzzed just as John finished making his mug of tea. He looked at the text.
“Mm?” Moriarty craned his neck, peering at Sherlock.
Sherlock’s thoughts were at last interrupted as the kettle began to whistle, and Sherlock looked up.
“I do, John,” sad Sherlock. “When it counts, I count on you.”
“Probably. But this isn’t a story.”
shut up skull, don't you dare judge me
“… How much money are we talking about here?” asked John.
Thanks to all of you sticking with me here, and those of you who leave kudos and comments especially! Comments mean a lot :) <3
,” repeated Sherlock, loudly now.
a model. Just for small time things, and artists, generally. But it’s hard. And Gruner’s made it almost impossible for me.” Kitty looked at Sherlock curiously. “How did you find him, exactly?”
Moriarty had sent the first puzzle to share something personal with Sherlock about his history. The first puzzle, Carl Powers, was about his history, and a connection he and Sherlock had never known they shared—their introduction to the world of crime. The second puzzle had been a statement about his empire. Moriarty had killed Shan in order to take full control of the Black Lotus Tong, an organization of smugglers he had used, in partnership with Gruner, to make millions. And that was only one of his criminal ventures. Moriarty liked control—over his empire, over his connections, over the flow of information. That was the point of the puzzles. To engage but still control the flow of information.
“I have my suspicions, though I admit some things don’t quite match up.”
“Yes,” said Sherlock again, flat and patient.
“Annoyed, furious, tired,” elaborated John. “But that doesn’t mean I’m not glad we found you in time.”
A few punches, a brief struggle, and it was over. In what could have been a few minutes or a few seconds, John’s bad arm was twisted painfully up in the square of his back, the grip so tight that John felt like he’d rip his arm off if he tried to tug it free.
His every thought, his every idea, his entire being, was replaced with three short, impossible words.
John examined the clothing but found nothing unusual about it. “Good,” John said finally, though he didn’t mean it. “All right. Can I get in touch with you tomorrow, perhaps? When Sherlock and I have had a chance to look things over?”
Walls crumbled in Sherlock’s mind. Small, carefully organized and pristine rooms collapsed, caved, and reassembled. A new room opened up, followed by more, which joined, reorganized, expanded, and filled. And in the center of it all was the man now standing in the doorway with a gun and the obnoxious ghost of a relieved smile playing at the corner of his mouth.
Mycroft gave a tiny noncommittal nod. “Not necessarily, but… it’ll do.”
“Then where’s the rest of it from?”
Sherlock gave a huge yawn. “I’d trick Amberley into leaving the house and seize the opportunity to break in to investigate. But that’s just me.”
“Fantastic. A psychopathic, Machiavellian crime lord,” muttered Lestrade. “Brilliant.”
“Hang on. Are you seriously saying the only way to tell it’s something to do with Moriarty is that it’s otherwise unsolvable?” said John, looking at Sherlock with enough skepticism to deter even Sherlock’s excitement.
“Since just after you left. Why?”
Sherlock knew. He could see it written in Moriarty’s eyes, a stark and black promise that for years he had killed and could kill and would continue to kill, and in all that time he would feel nothing.
“I’ll keep that in mind,” said Sherlock. “Though you know I don’t collaborate well.”
expense didn’t stop you from arriving at our flat in a chauffeured car, with an
John heard the front door close behind Sherlock a moment later. He crossed to the new windows and looked out, watching Sherlock clamber into Lestrade’s car before it trundled off down the street, around the corner, and out of sight. He sighed, and stepped back from the window, looking out at the ruined building across the street for a moment, before he frowned.
~o~O~o~
The tempo increased.
In a way, it was an immense relief to see Sherlock. But in another, arguably greater way, John had hoped he wouldn’t be there.
The dead victim.
Sherlock cleared his throat and restarted, “Don’t call your sister, don’t contact your friends or your family or your superiors. Don’t go drawing attention to the fact that you’re here.”
“So that’s what it’d look like with me,” said John slowly, as if it was taking considerable effort for him to grapple with the concept. “And then I’d just be dead forever, like I was supposed to be before I met you.”
I hope it's a good one!
evidence.
Sherlock didn’t have a fully formulated answer, so, he shrugged. “I’ve always managed in the past.”
“I heard you boys rushing out this morning, and I thought I’d make sure you were properly looked after when you got back, seeing as Sherlock’s only just back on his feet,” she said, as John passed her a few mugs and Sherlock lounged around at the table to watch the proceedings. “Just this once, of course.”
“Why would I be expecting a hug?”
“I just… I know he’s not telling me everything,” said John. “And I don’t expect him to. He’s always kept things close to his chest, especially with Moriarty. I know he’s reluctant to get me involved, considering my… history, I guess, with Moriarty’s operation. But I need him to tell me the important things. I can’t help him—or help keep him safe—if he won’t talk to me.”
"Oh?" said Lestrade, raising an eyebrow.
Sherlock snorted. “Hardly.”
His only chance of getting out of this, Sherlock knew, was a fast escape. If he could take out the smaller of the two men still standing, he could flee around the corner. The high street would still have some light traffic. They wouldn’t attack him there, only chase him.
"They're not random suicides, Lestrade, they're—"
Sherlock shook his head. “It’s metaphorical. He’s having fun.”

Quite a few Pushing Daisies references in this one. That last little conversation in particular is based on one of my favorite exchanges from Pushing Daisies so I couldn’t help but incorporate it
There was no going back.
It was as a result of these Rules that Young Sherlock was able to gain such perfect control of his Gift. It was thanks to the Rules that Young Sherlock was able to ensure he was never again careless. It was because of the Rules that Young Sherlock was able to stop himself from ever caring about another human being.
. I have no control over it. I don’t have any control over who dies; it’s a random proximity thing.”
John sighed. “Yeah, well, you don’t have a choice.”
John rubbed his eyes. “I’m not sure it works that way, but God knows I don’t have it in me to argue with you regarding the state of your brain.”
“You’re a git,” John informed him.
And in thirty seconds more, Young Sherlock had concluded that this was a secret that he could
“What about you?” asked John. “Find anything?”
Sherlock: excuse me is that seriously the best greeting you can come up with
“Huh. Fancy that,” said Sherlock sarcastically.
people to spy on
Mycroft: lol
Dead, again, forever.
“Then let’s just do your wrists and be done with it, because clearly, you’d rather suffer alone,” replied John furiously.
“Of course it’s him,” said Sherlock. He looked up at John. “I might as well tell you, since our lives might be about to get a lot more annoying with his enormous nose sniffing about.”

And as he saw it now, he had two choices.
Enjoy!
~o~O~o~
“Twice,” said Sherlock automatically, but the knot of panic in his chest eased slightly. He
“Yes,” said John automatically, and Sherlock sighed wearily.
“Sherlock, that means filling the apartment with palm trees and a carp pond—“
“Photoshop.”
“Don’t be stupid.”
And Shan might have answers he needed.
And in this case, Sherlock's inaction had resulted in an equal and opposite reaction.
“What does that mean?” said John, peering over Sherlock’s shoulder to read the message—but by the time the words had left his lips, Sherlock had taken off towards the doors at a run.
“You could have
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I have a doctorate in chemistry, John, and years of experience dealing with things a lot more intimidating than a pair of old trainers.”
Sherlock nodded. “Quite. John and I had already deduced that it’s a number system, and I would assume the numbers are Chinese in origin.”
“You’re only bringing him back for a minute,” said John, though—surprisingly—not unkindly. “It won’t matter much.”
, Greg.”
John watched him, eyes flitting between the doors and Sherlock’s phone. “Why not call?”
“To the base of operations for this country’s international security force, correct.”
Moran’s lip curled. “Better,” he sneered. “Can’t say I’m impressed with the service here—“ he gestured to the room at large with one cuffed hand “—but at least I can still get a smoke when I need one.”
Sherlock opened the back door of the car and slid into the backseat, grimacing at every movement. He looked back, and then looked out the opposite window. “Mycroft Holmes. Consistently a bastard. And my brother.”
driver take
Sherlock met her gaze evenly. “And yet you insist on maintaining the delusion that I don’t know we are in Soho—Gerrard Street, in particular, I’m willing to bet—in some shop basement out of which you and your gang of lotus-marked criminals augment the wealth and anonymity of Moriarty.”
all you took away from that? Is there a problem, Lestrade? Hm?"
Something had happened at the last possible second. Something unprecedented. Something Sherlock could not explain.
He had to stop analyzing it, or it would get to him. And that was when things would get well and truly out of hand.
“Technically, I’ve never been discharged.”
,” said Mycroft, emphasizing the name, “you don’t seem to work at present, and with nothing else as a means of supporting yourself, that alone raises a few questions.”
Zhi Zhu swayed on the spot, clearly in shock, with his mouth slightly agape. He reached a shaking hand up to touch the bullet wound in the center of his forehead, and then he drew his hand quickly away, staring at his bloody fingertips like he didn’t recognize them as his own.
“Are you coming?” said Sherlock.
In Baritsu, there were three main goals: to disturb the equilibrium of the assailant, to surprise them before they found the time to regain their balance, and to win by subjecting joints in the opponent’s body to strains that they were anatomically and mechanically unable to resist. All this was done by using agility and intelligence rather than strength—drawing on skills established by taekwondo of Korea, the judo and karate of Japan, and the boxing style of the United Kingdom’s fighters—so that defeat looked effortless. Strength was a luxury. Baritsu was a form of self-defense devised by gentlemen, for gentlemen, who wanted to thump would-be robbers with their canes and continue their saunter home from the club. Young Sherlock thought it could be easily enough applied to his own situation.
John hurriedly switched the kettle off and rushed to the stairs, taking them two at a time until he reached his bedroom door. “What was that about—“
Kitty looked halfway to tears and infinitely angrier. “If you know about that, then you know why I’ve been stuck in this position. I’m an amateur; my career couldn’t survive something like that. And plenty of the other women he blackmails are married or have high-end jobs and something like this would ruin them, which is probably why they weren’t willing to come forward before an arrest was made and charges pressed.”
“I’m just wondering. Since I don’t know what to look for or even how long you’re planning on checking all of these places for some sign of Moriarty,” said Lestrade wearily.
“And?” said Sherlock, sitting forward to try to better read the emotions playing across John’s face.
you?”
John gave Anderson and Donovan a full ten seconds to reply and, when they didn’t, he turned on his heel and set off after Sherlock.
John scowled. “So, you tell him you solved this and wait for the next puzzle as a reward. Great. I love playing mind games with terrorists.”
Then behind John, on the far side of the pool, a door opened.
“We’ll just open up a few windows, get some air flowing,” John reassured him, secretly dreading returning to the nauseating odor of paint fumes. “Shouldn’t be a problem.”
Sherlock’s phone buzzed early a couple mornings later.
“I’m telling you once,” said Young Sherlock, and he looked the lead Bully straight in the eye. “Leave. Me. Alone.”
“I’m not lying there while you poke me and try to figure out if I’m dying,” said Sherlock venomously.
It was as if the very passage of time had been broken in that flash of light. All of time and space had stopped, transfixed, and converged on this single moment.
“I’m just worried about the risks of her poking around for Moriarty’s personal assassin,” said John. He absentmindedly touched his left shoulder, where there had been a bullet in the immediate vicinity of his clavicle some two months, twelve days, nine hours, and forty-three minutes earlier.
Sherlock sat up a little straighter so he could be sure she saw his indignant expression. “I have never once relied on
we brought him down without tying him publically to Moriarty. Barring some failure on my part that I don’t know about, Moriarty will continue to play.”

In short, the Black Lotus would all die, quickly and without warning.
For about the thousandth time, he wished he had some sort of effective anesthetic that he could actually use for the purpose of suturing his own bullet wound. Better yet, a second doctor to do it for him.
“We didn’t talk about much,” said John, looking guilty. “I told her I was recently discharged, and after that she stopped asking questions. We just had tea, and lunch. Talked a little. TV. She’s very nice.”
“How do you know that?” asked John slowly.
This was new.
“Hey,” said the Inspector. “Sherlock in?”
the morgue.”
“How should I know?” said Sherlock.
“So the ruler of a criminal empire
“No,” said Soo Lin. “No. Thank you. I have made up my mind.”
John snorted. “Then let’s go. Ready?”
And there was something both deeply unsettling and strangely comforting in knowing that he wasn’t the only one in the room who would be lying if he said he hadn’t been afraid tonight. If he said he wasn’t afraid now.
. Not just you. If I wake up in the morning and find you’ve vanished into thin air, or gone and gotten yourself killed, or somehow smuggled me out of the country in my sleep, or—“
He’d been treating this like a game without appreciating the real stakes. He was an idiot, for not assuming from the first that this is how his interactions with Moriarty would progress.
Mycroft sat back. “Fine. Starting now. And then you can leave.”
Sherlock blinked.
Sherlock stood there for a long and silent moment. His thoughts were moving so fast that even breathing seemed too slow and tedious.
“I am an expert,” said Gruner, engrossed with the dish. “And it’s flawless.”
“Our man Gruner might be of interest after all,” said Sherlock, scanning the texts with interest.
trust me, okay
“None taken,” said John. “But surely at least the government would focus on the terrorist?”
Sherlock smacked the topmost case file pointedly. “I mean, if I am right in suspecting these cases are
Sherlock’s Mind Palace lit up like a fireworks display, and he cast the glowing net wide. His dungeon became a room so vivid in his mind that he was free to walk around and examine, scouring every inch for some means of escape. The adrenaline rush was better than any drug or illicit substance he might have encountered in his thirty-three years, ten months, two days, four hours, and thirty-five minutes of life. Epinephrine and norepinephrine stimulated basic, instinctual chemical reactions within the brain that made his heart pound and his muscles shake and his mind fly from thought to thought so fast that he forgot to breathe. The threat of imminent, impending death was a more effective rush than cocaine.
along with the pen out of John’s notebook, and hurried out of the flat and down to the street. He hailed a cab, and twenty minutes later he was clambering out to stand in front of the little café behind the antiquities museum.
- extraordinary.
Also, on a little sidenote, I've plotted most of this story out, and it's looking like it'll be somewhere between 35 and 45 chapters of variable length. Hopefully you won't all be too sick of it by the end... I'm having fun, at least. XD
Sherlock slammed a hand down on the desk, right over the photograph of dead John. “You had
thought had happened,” Moriarty conceded with another even more excited laugh. His dark eyes flashed. “It’s awkward to say it aloud, but… I would have guessed
John refrained from an indignant reply, instead simply adjusting his hold on his bag. “Sorry,” he said. “Lead on.”
“I—“ John frowned a little, but went on, “I suppose so. I was hoping you’d think differently, and treat Sherlock differently, if you were sure.”
The Detective waved something in one hand; at first glance, anyone thought it was a leather wallet. Then Sherlock opened it, and revealed a collection of lockpicks of various sizes and shapes. “One can get so much further in life with the aid of a set of lockpicks,” he said drily.
But John found himself hoping beyond hope that it wasn’t a dream. That it wasn’t just being dead. That this was actually happening, in spite of all of the reasons why it couldn’t. That this, and being here, and Sherlock Holmes, were all real.
“Excuse me?” said Mycroft, and John thought he sounded almost unnerved.
“Yes, and I’m your meal ticket,” snapped Sherlock.
“Any ideas since last night?” asked John, yawning a little and taking a sip of tea.
As always, thanks to my amazing beta, the brilliant
"AHH! My mind is imploding! Give me problems, give me work, give me a case!”
sadly for you, Mycroft, i am your worst nightmare
“Nor am I,” said John. “I just wish I had learned more. Unless Moran decides to blurt out Moriarty’s home address, I don’t know how this gets us any closer to him.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s almost stupid how determined he is to see the good in any situation. He’s just courting disappointment.”
“No, no, thanks,” said Sherlock firmly, in a tone of forced calm. “I want to run a few errands if I’m going to be hunkered down with a case again.”
“Which might be contributing to your frustration,” suggested John.
“I warn you, Lestrade, I am not in the mood,” said Sherlock, unconsciously thinking of ways he could kill the Inspector and get away with it. A poisoned doughnut held promise.
“All right, all right,” Lestrade blustered. “I’m getting a PIN lock on my door.”
John tried very hard to keep a straight face, taking a sip from his mug. “Better tell me, then.”
“No,” said John. “I’m the only one.”
Watson's face set, and he nodded once, with a small half smile. He dropped his hand and briskly moved to settle back, lying down with a sort of resigned look on his face.
But Soo Lin shook her head. “In a way. Yes. It’s more complicated than that.”
~o~O~o~
Sherlock took one step towards John, and then stopped.
you’re feeling up to it.”
I do go back to uni this week, but with any luck there won't be any major interruptions to the posting schedule. Fingers crossed!
“We have learned a great deal about you,” said Shan coldly. “While you seek us out, we have sought you out. And learned far more than you have learned.”
“No idea,” said Sherlock. “But I’m going to find out.” He crossed over to the sink and started rummaging around, pulling out a microscope and setting it on the table. He stepped past John to the living room, grabbed his laptop from the coffee table, and brought that to the kitchen as well, and then began digging around in the cabinets for new microscope slides, petri dishes, and so on.
“No, I don’t,” said Sherlock, smiling thinly.
“The serial suicides,” he said flatly.

remember her, though they had never met before. “You were the one I communicated with about the antique dish Moriarty sent me,” he said. It wasn’t a question. “The art historian from the National Antiquities Museum. We exchanged a few emails when I was trying to determine if the dish was authentic.”
Moran shrugged. “I’m not, really. We never did get a chance to talk over the last few days, and before my unceremonious incarceration, I was in the process of sending you a message.”
“Still living in Lewisham?”
“Just John,” said John coldly. “Considering you

“Let’s just wait for the bomb squad to give us a ruling,” said Lestrade, looking uneasy, and both he and John nodded.
“Listen. You’re allowed to feel unsettled,” said John, looking at Sherlock across the table with a surprisingly patient, and gentle, expression. “Like it or not, you’re human. You can’t be above emotions all the time. Moriarty got your attention by blowing up part of our street. And in doing so he made sure everyone we know would be involved. He brought all of this right to our doorstep. Anyone would be unsettled by that. And,” he continued, before Sherlock could interrupt, “maybe that was his plan.”
have to be careful."
“It is, a bit,” admitted Sherlock. “We can talk about the specifics of my ‘Gift’ sometime, when I don’t think you’d faint away with the shock. Or be a dick about it.”
“I’m sure he wants to either tempt me into partnering up with him, or kill me,” said Sherlock carelessly, waving a hand.
Sherlock scowled and rolled his eyes, stirring his cup of tea disinterestedly with a spoon. “I’m only making sure. It’s rather impressively bruised.”
Five minutes, forty-two seconds.
Sherlock rolled his eyes again, this time so exaggeratedly that his entire head rolled with them. “No, the skull. Of
Sherlock couldn’t begin to guess why he had told the truth. He did not know what had made him say it. Why he had wanted to. Why he had let himself.
"What does it look like I'm doing?" said John.
“A minute,” said Sherlock automatically. After all, this was a fact. Sherlock could operate in fact. Now, to steer the conversation back to more—
“Should I have refused her help?” asked Sherlock, his tone equal parts defensive and genuinely curious.
a dream.
John was an army doctor. Just a doctor. But he knew what semtex looked like.
Sherlock glanced at the Doctor, and paused. “You’re thinking something.”
Lestrade spoke over him, and pointed an accusing finger at Sherlock. “Do you have any idea—Sherlock, I could—if ‘magic’ was a viable reason, I could charge you with
“I’m not a case,” said Sherlock, frowning at the idea.
“If you’re sure.” Lestrade crossed to his office door and held it open for Sherlock. “Seriously, let me know if you have any leads, all right? Mycroft and I both want to be in the loop.”
“So—so the killer cabbie was a distraction?” said John, gradually becoming as excited as Sherlock. “To distract people from the real threat?”
John was looking at Sherlock now, not Moriarty.
John glanced up, frowning.
Hoping to adjust my posting schedule and build up that buffer so I don't get delayed anymore, so fingers crossed!
John: everything's going to be okay, right?
“Behave,” said John, and he moved to the bottom of the stairs to lead the way up. “Ready?”
“No, no, no. Not yet. I’m saving you for something special. This was never supposed to be how you die. If I wanted you to die here, you’d already be dead. No, this was because I had to meet you. My other half.”
“Go on, try.” Sherlock pushed one of the shoes in John’s direction across the table.
Sherlock shook his head. “I doubt it. Air travel is largely closed in that region right now. Most are military flights. And land travel is equally monitored. We’re unlikely to get access to that kind of information, and we would be unlikely to find anything even if we do.”
John sighed, a little frustrated. “I don’t – understand how that works.”
to be solved. He had to know, he had to know what it was that had stopped him from carrying through when the timer had reached sixty seconds, he had to know what it was about John Watson that had made him stop and cease caring about the passage of time.
The office had not changed much. The room was as grand and stuffy as it had been last time. The only real difference was that the pot of dead flowers that had been on the windowsill was now gone.
John got up and, ignoring his own jacket, ran down the stairs after Sherlock. “Sherlock!” he called, but Sherlock slammed the front door to 221B after him, ignoring John’s call.
Of course he wouldn’t.
He promptly deleted that thought.
talk to."
“Okay.” John stood up. “Don’t move,” he ordered, and before there was time to think, there was a deafening BANG at Sherlock’s back that made the hair on the back of his neck stand on end.
“We found that one of the names on this flight did, in fact, belong to a dead soldier,” said Mycroft. “This is the only photograph of any soldier on that flight whose status can’t now be verified, so it must be him. Not even military security is perfect. It’s easier to get past military checkpoints if you’re using what used to be a legitimate identity. You should know, little brother, that making up entirely false personas never yields good results—it’s too easy to lose track of the details. Modifying a dead man’s records so that they look alive is less challenging, and less risky. It’s a similar thought process to the one I used in creating John’s new papers. And in addition, I imagine people are less suspicious about those people flying
John’s expression was utterly blank. “And you’re just a dead sniper.”
John looked up from his takeaway with a mildly disappointed expression on his face. “Optimism, I suppose. Or desperation. No word from Mycroft?” he said.
“Indeed,” said Sherlock. “Those responsible for the events in Afghanistan are bolder than I had initially thought. And apparently very determined to leave the police with nothing.”
Thank you all so much for reading! Your feedback means the world to me <3
“What’s he want you here for?” Donovan said, her eyes narrowing.
“Yes, Sherlock, he’s missing,” said Lestrade impatiently.
Irish accent. Sherlock remembered that he had speculated as much weeks ago. The name Moriarty had its roots in Gaelic. And he could read a flash of recognition in John’s expression that said that John had heard this voice before.
Somehow, John hadn’t considered this.
Sherlock: [extremely verbose apology]
this case, now that he felt responsible for John. And was cohabiting a space with another living human being. The world radiated infinite possibilities for Moriarty. Infinite sources of potential information, of possible leads. And now on top of everything, he had to find some way to deal with—
John shook his head doggedly. “Sherlock’s not a psychopath. I didn’t have to pledge myself to a maniac to get my second life. How long I’m around for doesn’t matter. What matters is that I’m not a mercenary for hire happy to make deals with the devil.
“Mm.” Sherlock sighed disappointedly. “Still.”
Sherlock gave him an approving look. “Good deduction. Yes, exactly. I think he might have given it to me for just that reason. I can reach out to Gruner under the pretense of selling it and thereby gain access to his house. Then I just have to get the camera. Lestrade can help.”
“Someone’s kept them that way,” said Sherlock. “Perfectly preserved for more than twenty years.” As John peered at the shoes, Sherlock went on, “And the pollen in the mud shows, thanks to a little chemical analysis courtesy of the Bart’s lab staff, that the shoes were worn in Sussex and then London, so…“
this case for you,” said Sherlock, equally smug and exasperated.
Sherlock couldn’t help but think of John grabbing him by the scarf and slamming his head into the lid of a coffin. The same principle worked well here. People tended to value their heads. And Sherlock knew well enough how effective a solid hit could be.
Sherlock turned on the police officer. “I wanted to get access to the final notes on the serial suicides. Particularly the toxicology reports. I think I’m onto something.”
In the other room, Moran had lit one of his cigarettes. He turned the cigarette box over and over in his hands, the smallest of grins on his face, and blew a cloud of smoke in the direction of the nearest security camera.
Sherlock gave the room in front of them one more sweeping glance. Something was wrong, even if he didn’t know what. “Stay close to me,” he said softly, and he led the way through the gallery and into the next. John followed in close step, the two of them passing from room to room without a sound, the silence hanging heavily on their shoulders.
Lestrade pressed his palms against his eyes. “You didn’t
“That just sounds like a lot of ominous open-ended questions to me,” said John.
After a brief pause, John said, “He couldn’t just find another sniper or bomber anyway? Even if they’re not as good?”
John and Lestrade traded amused looks before joining Sherlock in the kitchen.
Before she left, John nodded at Sherlock, and quietly asked, “Is he like this a lot?”
John nodded. A moment passed, and then he said, “My turn to ask a question?”
“I don’t know,” said Sherlock. “I just realized that I have nowhere to go besides here and Bart’s.”
“It’s the way he is,” said Sherlock. “You and I read means, motives, moments. John just – reads
Not even in death.
Sherlock pointed at the object he’d tossed at John from his spot by the door.
“Ah,” said Gruner, looking again at the dish. “I’m only surprised that I had not heard of this piece in London until you contacted me. I am the foremost collector in the area, as I’m sure you’ve gathered. What do you think of the rest of my collection?”
If Sherlock had to define hell, he would likely define it as absolute, infinite  nothingness.
The Detective knew how to handle himself in fights. He brought down more than a few would-be fleeing criminals with a well-placed punch or kick. The Detective didn’t need help. Alone was much more efficient. Alone protected him. Alone protected everyone.
“Unless…” said Sherlock.
“My informants have come up empty,” he said absentmindedly, already starting to text them back.
Was it really that hard to believe it could still be that way now?
Sherlock nodded. “I did not want to bring the full set with me for this first meeting but, if you are indeed interested, perhaps you would be willing to visit me across town to see the rest. You can see it is genuine, and I’m happy to get an expert’s evaluation.”
“Someone will see to it,” answered Mycroft carelessly, opening a file folder before looking back at John, resting his arms calmly on the desk in front of himself.
“You must be…” started John, not sure if he would be heard.
Sherlock glared at John. “Hilarious,” he said, crossing to the door. “Absolutely hilarious.”
But Mycroft was always prying. Especially when he was not wanted. And especially when he knew it would frustrate Sherlock.
There was an expectant silence.
“So then what intel were you gathering?” asked John, and Sherlock refocused on their conversation.
what we really need is Mrs Hudson to whack everyone upside the head and tell them how silly they're all being
“By which I mean he
John paused for a moment. “I don’t know. I think the logical answer is probably that he does, but…”
John licked his lips. Ah. He could feel his face turning red, but swallowed and remembered that he and Sherlock still had a challenge. He hadn’t anticipated having a real case, however; this complicated things. He swallowed and dropped the sock. “Ah,” he said. “Inspector. Do we have a case?”
I hope you all can remember where we left off because it's about to get crazy.
“You know how I get when there’s a case,” said Sherlock. “I’m not trying to make excuses; I’m just saying, I can be single-minded. And you know how I am regarding risk. I’m reckless, but not stupid. I thought following Moran
As soon as the car door closed, Mycroft’s secretary rounded the car, climbed into the front seat, and closed her door. The car started off down the street, John looking out of the window in surprise.
“They get
Sherlock extended an arm, face taciturn, sensing an end to the fussing. John took his hand—still gentle, even if he wasn’t feeling particularly patient anymore—and pushed up the sleeve.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “They were ugly curtains anyway, Mrs. Hudson. The kitchen is far brighter without them.”
Sherlock sighed, shut his laptop, and turned back to the kitchen.
Sherlock didn’t bother to look at Lestrade. He didn’t need to.
~o~O~o~
“Just get me a report on everything and everyone in the body lockers in there, and then I need an update on our progress with finding the vehicle,” snapped Lestrade through clenched teeth.
John sighed. He looked slightly mollified. “Okay. Okay, I just wondered. I don’t think feeling like a criminal in hiding half the day did much for my mental state.”

<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
When they returned to Baker Street, Sherlock got out first, without a word, and went inside. John paid the cabbie before following, and he hurried up the stairs to find that Sherlock had stopped in the middle of the living room, standing there as if he was lost.
John had managed to get the vast majority of it off quickly enough, but now there were faint streaks of yellow blending in with the dark blue, making the whole thing look just a little too multicolored to be passable. John shot a bit of the door with cooking spray (hopefully the internet hadn’t lied about this) and attacked the paint with his sponge, balancing crouched on his heels and muttering about lazy magical detectives and smugglers undoubtedly enjoying watching him scrub paint. Seriously, this was idiotic. Next time, Sherlock could get the paint off the sodding door himself—after all, it was technically his fault that there was a bright yellow numerical nightmare all over the door…
Lestrade was deadpan.
“We have learned you do not scare easily.”
“Anywhere from a few thousand to a few million pounds,” said Sherlock.
,” he said, shutting his eyes for a second. Every now and then there was a gunshot somewhere in the building. So, John wasn’t alone entirely. Lestrade, surely, was here as well.
Her footsteps echoed in empty corridors in his head that were suddenly filled with a frigid, hollow wind. It made his blood run cold. He’d played his hand. The question now was if her fear of Moriarty would save him or kill him.
With some effort, he opened his eyes, and raised his head enough to look up.
“What are you doing here, Freak?” demanded a young woman at the doors, glaring at him as he approached.
The force in John’s voice became more pronounced, but so did a new edge Sherlock did not immediately recognize. When he did, his voice was suddenly questioning. “… Are you worried?”
Sherlock nodded. He looked down at the cabbie. His belongings said as much as his face did. Older, ill, and not much of interest. The only reason they might take the full minute to speak with him was if John got wordy. Which, given that he and John had spent the last three days in near-total silence, was unlikely.
Sherlock put his phone down on the arm of his chair and ran his hands over his face.
Sherlock balked. “So how long has Gruner got? Is the sniper going after him tonight?”
“Clearly not!” said John, half-shouting him down. “You might be able to bring back the dead, but I can’t bring you back to life. The best I can do is keep you alive. So
It did not rise. It did not get up and fly away again.
Thank you all so so much for sticking with me! It means a lot! <3
“... What’s this?”
“Will you have stopped being bizarre by then?” said Lestrade. John shook his head. Lestrade sighed. “All right, then. Good luck, I suppose.”
“I’ll… figure that out,” said John, just as uncertain but far more determined.
John laughed. “No offense, mate, but you’d have to be more than a little messed up if ‘magic’ was the best bullshit you could come up with.” He laughed, frowning a little, as if wondering what had inspired Sherlock’s question. “I know who I am. I’m getting towards knowing who you are. I might think you’re something along the lines of a mad genius, but it’s not like you’re secretly the murderer.”
This was, in Sherlock’s opinion, incredibly annoying, and in his annoyance, he knocked the phone off his bedside table and left it there.
"That would kill you," Sherlock pointed out.
“Just wanted to make sure everything was all right,” he said. “No more explosions.”
It had been a shock, to be approached by John upon entering the pool, but now Sherlock could see the logic behind it. It set the stage. It took the relief of seeing John seemingly unhurt and twisted it. Sherlock had figured out quickly enough that John’s words on his arrival were being dictated with an earpiece of some sort by an unseen third person —so this must be that person.
to get me anywhere. Perspicacity and reason are the tools I rely on. Not
“Not right away, at least. Moran’s job security was having a skillset that made him hard to justify disposing of. Moriarty would also need to keep Moran close because Moriarty’s entire operation would be uncovered if Moran decided to work for someone else, or talk to police. Whatever Moriarty has offered Moran in their partnership had to be enough to buy his loyalty and discretion, as well as his skills.”
you're the reason
“I want to talk to the cab driver,” he said. “You should talk to him too.”
John, however, was something of an anomaly, in most things. Maybe he’d be reasonably less annoying to deal with.
“You’ve got to be kidding me,” said the policeman, even as Jeff Hope nodded, still smirking.
“You means you,” said Sherlock. “And you’re not going to a crime scene dressed in a bathrobe, so stop acting like an idiot.”
“Ready,” said Lestrade.
John and Lestrade both looked convinced that they must have imagined the last three seconds.
Since Mycroft’s visit, Sherlock had leapt back to work, absorbed in the thrill of the chase almost immediately. It was like the sullen days sitting around the house had never happened—or, more accurately, it was like he was hell-bent on making up for the lost time.
And I got some much-needed rest, and some time to write, over the winter holidays. Now it’s back to work -- AND, more importantly, back to updates!!
But it was possible his reputation for success, with cases of murder and death and locked-door suicides and all of the more gruesome cases imaginable, meant that they knew he could make some damning deduction if he had a body to look at.
“I’ve never heard of that.”
John Watson, aged thirty-six years, three months, fifteen days, and eleven minutes, had been stationed in Afghanistan for the last sixteen months, working as an army doctor in active combat zones. One of the more experienced doctors in his company, he was regularly called out in response to attacks from insurgents and emergency calls. So it made sense that he was among those called in to respond to a convoy bombing near Sangin, where an informant en route to London was potentially dead.
Perhaps there really was more feeling to Sherlock Holmes than met the eye.
Also this chapter, for whatever reason, was also ridiculously hard to write. No idea why. I hope it doesn’t show!! The final 5 chapters or so have been blocked out in detail for months, but the intervening chapters were always destined to be a pain in the ass >:[
“Very nice of you.”
“Don’t tell me what to do,” grumbled Sherlock. “I don’t need painkillers. Pain is physical. The body is just transport. It can be ignored with the proper focus.”
Yet it was the obvious answer. The only answer.
God, this was insane.
“I’m guessing that’s a no,” commented John.
this is the price I pay
Sherlock crossed his arms across his chest defensively. “Fine. Clearly it doesn’t matter if I want it or not.”
I am here? You weren't seriously hoping that I could poke some charred remain and have it spontaneously spill all of the man's secrets? It doesn't work that way, as you should well know. I need an actual body to work with. Or most of one. How about you give me a
a horrible boss,” said John, which got a small laugh out of Sherlock.
Sherlock had eyes only for Mycroft, glaring daggers at his brother, and he hissed, “I have never once invited you to poke around in my business. If you have a problem, you take it up with me, but don’t you
,” she hissed.
“Or what?” said John again. “You’re going to have someone come and drag the angry dead guy out of your office?”
Wasting no time, Young Sherlock grabbed his favorite blue scarf and tied it about his neck in spite of the fact that it was 29 degrees Celsius that afternoon, and he snuck downstairs past his father's study and his mother's parlor and ran straight to the section of petunia bushes directly below his bedroom window, where a dead sparrow now lay.
