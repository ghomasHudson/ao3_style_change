Moriarty shrugged.
He started walking away, and while he was heading to his room I saw the smile curling on his lips. It felt nice, to tell him that. I don’t think Sherlock hears things like that very often, and it’s upsetting because he should. He’s not a bad guy, he just has moments where he finds it…difficult, to fit in. Yeah, he’s not the best flatmate, but nobody is. I don’t know where I was going with this, but it’s just something I’ve noticed about him. I think we’ll have a movie night tonight.
"Right, Sherlock, whenever you feel like introducing me to your friend here, that would be great."
Follow me at
“John.”
"This isn't right, why are we here, how did we get here?"
"No."
Sherlock's smile grew. John could never get enough of the detective's grins. He rarely did it, but when he did, it was one of the greatest things John has ever seen. Sherlock's curls were tickling John's forehead, but he didn't mind it one bit. John's firm grip of Sherlock's bum tightened, causing Sherlock to move closer to John.
"Stop...c-c-crying....I-I'll...start...."
“Yes, I do.”
"Really? I do suppose that's a bit beneficial for me."
'That doesn't mean that she has to go through it again.'
“Let’s see, let’s see…I love your hair. I’ve always loved it. I love the way it looks when you wake up. I love the way it looks when you style it, although I don’t appreciate how long you take to do it, love. I adore your curls so very much, Sherlock. I love that they’re on your head, and I love that you wear them so well.”
"He took me to Bubopolis. It's a planet with nothing but huge bubbles on it. And then we had tea with Queen Victoria, and that skull, the skull on my mantelpiece, I got that from chasing Jack the Ripper through the catacombs! I got my very own pirate hat from Blackbeard the pirate!"
“Maybe your name will be the first. It is only one syllable and I am sure that I’ve said it countless times around her.”
Mycroft nodded.
'But I know that he still cares for us very much, and we...well I have to support him even though he pushes us away. He still needs us.'
“I know it, Sherlock. You’re my best friend too.”
‘Easy Sherlock, I have to check you. Where does it hurt?’ I was trying to be as gentle as possible because you looked like you were in extreme pain, and I need to have some sort of diagnosis before I called the ambulance. You told me it was your stomach, and so I felt around for any abnormalities. Save for the surgery mark, there were none. Whatever was happening to your stomach was internal, and we would need the paramedics for this one.
“John…I can’t…I can’t hold it…any longer…”
He can still see Holmes and Watson stepping inside of the TARDIS, Holmes captivated by the scientific beauty of it all, and Watson nervous and stuck in his Victorian ways of thinking. In his period, it was unbecoming to think of such wild things such as the TARDIS, but Holmes didn't care a fig for any of the rules the world has set in motion, and that's what draws Watson to him. Holmes was absolutely marvelous in his eyes. He was everything that Watson wasn't, and he loved it, even though he was a bit envious.
John found that amusing while Holmes did not.
And they all ran out of the chapel to get to the reception.
“Actually, it’s the same bottle I bought years back. During that whole Irene Adler fiasco. I meant to share it with you but…you know.”
“No, no, Sherlock that’s not how this is going to go. You’re going to tell me exactly what you feel. You’re going to say ‘I love you, John Watson.’”
"S-so, where are we?" Sherlock asked, to get off of the subject.
They were now inside the TARDIS, and for some reason, it looked even more brighter than usual. Did it know that it was Sherlock's birthday as well?
Finally, you stood up and gathered the clothes on the bed.
~~~~~~~~
I watched as you absorbed all of the information about her. You’ve always had the most attractive face when you were getting new information, more knowledge about a person, I could look at you for hours. I interrupted Lara while she was giving us the rundown.
He saw Mycroft nod from the corner of his eye.
'Are we going home now?' You asked me. I nodded and gave you a warm smile. You wanted a bed and you wanted your kip. I just wanted you to feel better.
"I have bandages; I can wrap your leg for you, just until you get home."
He gave Watson a moment, and then the doctor replied, "I'm trying to, Holmes, but not a thought comes to mind."
"Papa?"
“Don’t you worry about a thing, Sherlock. We’ll get out of this yet.”
'Do you think that I want this, Sherlock? To have you whisked away from Baker Street and placed in a hospital cot?' I felt like I was talking to a child, but in my defense, you were acting like one. Your curls were low and they were strewn about all over your face with the tips being damp from the sweat you produced while screaming. Your skin was deathly pale, and you were so worn from the tantrum you threw for the...what was it...the fifth time that week? At first, I was gentle, I let you vent and then I told you that it was for the best, but then you kept doing it, you kept on with the fighting and then a small part of me, the tiniest bit of my being wanted you gone. I hated myself for thinking that way, I guess it was the stress of everything that was happening. I didn't mean that, I didn't want you gone, I wanted you with me for as long as time would possibly allow us.
"I don't know how, and I don't know why so please don't ask me, but I heard him."
Holmes swallowed hard and restricted his volume and tone of voice very carefully. He was having trouble doing that much.
"Join you for what?"
The third thing that John thought was
Sherlock wiped away his tears and nodded furiously, chuckling with a smile so wide his eyes were nearly closed. He placed his hands in John’s and kept nodding.
"You mean to tell me you remembered my birthday?"
They fell asleep like that, embraced and inhaling the scent of the other. The last thing that John remembered thinking was that he didn’t want Sherlock to leave.
“What’s for breakfast?”
“Now’s not the time to act daft, John. Contrary to popular belief, I know when I’ve overstayed my welcome. Say the word and I’ll pack my things and leave.”
"Thank you. I promise that we won't stay long at all. Hopefully, he'll heal fast. He doesn't like to be sick or injured in any way."
Sherlock obeyed and parted his lips as Watson pressed the bottle against his bottom one and titled the bottle up and let Sherlock drink some of the liquid inside. When Watson felt like he's had enough, he removed the bottle and screwed the cap back on. The Doctor laid Sherlock back on the bed and John watched as Sherlock's eyes grew heavy and nodded off to sleep again. Watson stood back up.
Sherlock was rubbing Rosie’s back as he looked up at John with a puzzled expression. “I thought we were having a Bond night?”
If John wasn't holding Sherlock at that moment, he would have fainted. He looked back at the Doctor and all he said was, "Stay with Sherlock, find out more, I'm going back to the TARDIS to find out what's really going on."
“And why is that?”
"And what do you think about it now? About what that man said?"
“Why would you want to know something like that? If this is an alternate reality and John and I are still together, then things must not be that different.”
Holmes pretended to fiddle around with the various chemicals in front of him but gave Sherlock a passing, “Morning.”
Moriarty’s dull eyes widened.
‘What’s your address again?’
John smirked and hailed a cab
John, feeling the heat of arousal and his climax pooling in the bottom of his stomach, positioned himself to enter Sherlock’s asshole and as he eased his way inside of Sherlock’s hole, he gasped at how tight and warm Sherlock was, god he wanted him so bad.
'Time to go meet our baby,' I said to you.
‘She hasn’t taken any drugs while pregnant, has she?’
Sherlock smirked and gave a nod.
I packed your bag; I knew that you would be staying for a night or two. I made sure Molly was situated, and that we were mentally prepared to leave. You looked so pale. I told Mrs. Hudson that the surgery could be hours, so I wouldn’t be back for quite some time, either late at night, or quite possibly, early the next morning. She was teary-eyed; she gave me a sort of wave and a curt nod. She gave you the biggest hug, like she would never see you again. You gave the smallest reaction; you gave her a few pats on the back.
“How generous, do you have anything to eat? I’m feeling a bit peckish.”
"You know there's nothing to be nervous about, all our friends are going to be there, I'm going to be there too, Sherlock."
‘Don’t worry, Mrs. Hudson, everything will be alright.’ You whispered softly as she cried onto your shoulder. I fought the urge to hug you myself, Sherlock. I stood with my hands clasped together, so that I could remain calm. I had to be strong for you, love, I was your soldier.
Sherlock slid his shirt back on and turned to The Doctor with a small smile on his face.
“Sherlock should have warned me about his temper.”
“What word?”
“Oh. I had wanted to watch Bond because I know how much you like the movies and…”
“Stop it Holmes, you flatter me.”
“Nor have I. Have you seen such a statue before, Holmes?”
“What’s so funny?”
“It is. You see, I’ve never met another like myself, Holmes.”
I shrugged; I didn’t want to give you more bad news. I was giving optimism a try, remember?
time Sherlock can say that he’s been happy is only when John is around. The love of his life, his blogger, his doctor…
"I lost count after two."
"Where were you?"
Sherlock kissed John’s smiling lips and moved down to his stomach. John watched with careful eyes as Sherlock pulled his shirt up and kissed the pudge. John blushed and threw his hands to his face.
“Bored?” John was trying to keep his tone level. Sherlock thought he was bored of him? Uninterested? He surely was a madman.
The second time, they were in the living room, Rosie was demolishing her stuffed bee while watching the television. Sherlock was sat on the couch while John fixed them breakfast. John’s specialty was eggs with beans on toast. Sometimes, he would sneak a few slices of ham from Mrs. Hudson while she was away and then cook it for their meal. Sherlock never much cared for breakfast, but with John, he would gladly sit and share a meal. He looked into the kitchen to see his lover standing over the stove humming some tune in his head. Sherlock smirked at how adorable he found the man to be at times. Rosie was tugging at his pant leg, he looked down and saw the blue-eyed baby smiling up at him with her fist in her mouth.
"That's good."
Holmes was about to move his chair closer to Sherlock's until he found a small chip in the back of his chair.
John's eyes narrowed.
My sentence died off there. I knew the stakes. Cancer is not a friend to anyone. I knew what came with cancer, but I could not bring myself to say it, not to your face, not out loud. Hell, I can barely say it now. I could feel your eyes on me, Sherlock. I couldn't stop there and then walk out of the room in mid-rant, I had to say something, I had to make you see that that was the right choice.
Watson’s face darkened and he crossed his arms.
The Doctor was clearly amused.
“How good it feels to be validated, and loved.”
‘…And we found out that…’ I stopped midsentence. My tongue felt swollen, Sherlock, like I couldn’t get any words out. I scared them even more. Mrs. Hudson looked like she was nearing a heart attack, Greg, as tired as he was looked wide awake then. Even Molly stopped paying attention to the baby. I felt your eyes on me; I know what you were trying to do. You were warning me, right? You were trying to tell me that this was my last warning and that you didn’t want me to finish my sentence. Sorry, Sherlock, you and I both knew that I couldn’t do that. I already had them hanging off the edge of their seats, I’m not just going to say ‘never mind’ and go about my day.
"Are you sure we're in the right spot?"
'Yes, what is it doctor?' I asked him. He looked surprised that I was calling him by his profession, I think that I was experiencing a case of "Hero Worship". He stuttered a bit but then got himself back on track.
"This is my note, this is what people do right? Leave a note?"
"Oh, Sherlock, don't you know? I'm great at surprises."
“And if it doesn’t?”
“And what will that do?”
"Alright, I think we're here."
John left feeling a little uneasy.
He heard Sherlock saying all of those things, and he can still see his husband giving that warm smile as he says it. John wipes at the tears that have managed to fall and sniffs to try and stop anymore from falling. He could still hear Sherlock’s voice, ringing throughout his head and his eyes were now glazed over.
The Doctor's hand was resting on the doorknob as he spoke.
After a pregnant pause, John forced himself to stand up straight and looked back at Sherlock.
I hadn't noticed that until you mentioned it. Immediately my hand rose to where yours was and I felt around. You were right, I felt the prickliness that was my stubble. It hadn't dawned on me that I neglected to shave for the past few days. I didn't have my husband to tell me that I was growing a beard. I passed it off lightly and a small smile spread on my lips.
John shrugged and nodded. Watson ended the conversation and continued down the stairs and made his way to the guest bedroom quickly. He opened the door to find the Doctor holding Sherlock as he threw up into the half-full bin that was on the side of the bed. Watson set the candle down and made his way over to Sherlock. He didn't notice that the Doctor was there, or simply wasn't focused on that at the moment. He knelt on the floor and waited for Sherlock to finish before unscrewing the cap to the bottle.
Sherlock snapped his head to his left to see John standing there with Watson, and The Doctor. They looked unharmed, minus the gash on John's head. Sherlock took a mental note to make Moriarty pay now.
The Doctor rested his head on Sherlock’s hip and shook his head.
Holmes thought bitterly.
Sherlock didn’t respond. John kissed him again.
"Holmes!"
Mycroft's face seemed afflicted by the comment.
The voice told the two that he was from one of the posh areas of London and clearly had good education. His manner of speech and his stance revealed that he was once a professor of some sort. At least, that's what they deduced. Holmes and Sherlock found themselves squinting. The fire was raging; its flames were spouting out of the fireplace and only a mere few feet away from touching the floor and setting the room ablaze. They wondered how the stranger could stand so close to it, but have no risk of getting burned.
“If we’re drawing parallels then, just like Smaug, I’m protecting just one thing with my life.”
Also, I don't see the point in updating a fic that's hardly receiving feedback.
"Good, you know, considering..."
“Hmph.”
“Yes, I guess you do.”
I asked you so many questions, but of course you didn't answer any of them.
"Will somebody bloody answer me?!"
“He thought that this was a ploy to have a laugh at him, so he thought it best to stay home.”
“I now pronounce you husbands! You may now kiss the groom.”
"Morning, papa."
Mycroft shook his head.
I couldn’t wrap my head around what you were saying. You told me that you were helping them by causing them more pain and I just wanted you to give me a reasonable, and understandable response. You did. I told you to indulge me, which you reluctantly did.
“D….delete….” The voice starts to chant
You made a few grunts here and there; eventually you were able to make your way into the bathroom without my help. You never asked for it either, at least not until later.
I had to take you to hospital. If I wanted you alive and with me, I needed to take you there so that you could get the proper care and treatment, the chemo alone wasn't doing enough for you. You protested so much, Sherlock, you shouted at me and told me that you would rather die than go back to hospital. I knew that you were lying, you were trying to dissuade me from taking you and you used every trick in the book. I think that you forgot that I knew you, and I knew when you were scared but deflected it with anger. I didn't stop your shouting, I didn't think about Kylie being frightened by your volume, I let you scream until your voice went hoarse.
“Oh well that’s terrific! You two deserve to have a night you know? What with all you’ve been through recently…”
Both Sherlocks rolled their eyes.
She laughed too.
Watson ignored his snide remark and made his way to the door to their flat, patiently awaiting the arrival of Sherlock, John, and The Doctor. He took notice that it was taking them longer than usual to make their way upstairs and thought that maybe they retired to their room for the night. He knew he should let them be since they might have been tired, but he wanted to check on them. He wanted to know why they were out so long. He opened the door to only be met with a dart to his neck, and before he could even register what caused the sharp pain he found his vision fading and his body growing weak. He opened his mouth and his lips quivered as he tried to call out for Holmes, but it was too late, he fell to the floor with a loud thud. It was loud enough to alert Holmes.
And that man was the Doctor.
John's hand moved to his leg and gave it a few pats.
Our agent, her name was Lara Winters, as the name on the desk read. She sighed and rotated her body to face her desk. We could hear her opening one of her drawers and fussing around until she found what she wanted. Her smile returned.
“Well, I’m not everybody.”
“You’re bossy.”
“Oh yeah? By who?”
Sherlock looked at him like he was the most idiotic man on earth. “Why on earth would you think I wouldn’t want to be with you, John? I love you more than words…happiness is only synonymous with you, my dear John.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"You will, but just not at this minute. I don't even know the answers to some of them myself."
Moriarty’s crooked grin spread across his face.
I felt my eyes tearing up as I had to explain to you how much it would kill me to lose you for good.
“I sat and watched you get married, because you were so happy. You didn’t see how hard it was me because I didn’t let you. I picked out decorations and clothes, for a wedding that wasn’t mine. I got fitted for a tuxedo that wasn’t for a groom.”
“I love you, Sherlock.” And soon his free hand left Sherlock’s chin and traveled down to Sherlock’s erection. He started to slowly pump, causing Sherlock to sigh loudly.
"Thank you. Dismissed, soldier."
‘Honestly, John, there is no need to repeat what I just said.’ You always hated when I did that.
Sherlock’s lips quivered and he nodded. He almost lost his resolve when John kissed his nose again and got up to walk over to the kitchen. Sherlock tilted his head and saw the love of his life hum softly as he gathered the pots and utensils to cook their dinner. His eyes wandered over to the vase of flowers.
'However, we will need to keep a close eye on you. I'm sorry, but we have to.' He interjected. He felt bad for your cancer returning, but it never left your system. If I was the one operating on you, I would've made sure that every cancerous cell in your body was removed and then I would have kept a very watchful eye over you because...because that's the over-protective husband in me. You would have hated me, Sherlock, but I think you did anyway because I rarely let you move from the bed.
But like everything I plan, it always fucks up somewhere, and then it goes so horribly. I think the only thing I’ve ever gotten right was proposing to you. And let me tell you, Sherlock that was one of the greatest moments of my life that I have planned. I know that does wonders for your ego.
"Let me tell you a few things about Moriarty. This is the same man, albeit a different version of him, that forced Sherlock, my Sherlock, to jump off the roof of a hospital and commit suicide. This is the same man who almost blew me up when we first met and who almost had Sherlock think that I was him. This is the same man who spent two months tarnishing Sherlock for who he is and what he does, and then proceeded to pose as an actor who was simply doing Sherlock's bidding."
"Bah, don't listen to my grumpy companion, you're welcome to stay for as long as you like. Just until he gets better."
“I don’t understand Holmes, what is it that you refuse to be delighted about?”
“You were checking in on a man that you’ve forgotten about for ten plus years?!”
‘Yes.’ I uttered quickly.
The Doctor looked at everybody's astonished faces and clasped his hands together, his smile was slowly fading.
"And what do you do...John...?"
“And then, if you’re feeling up to it and Rosie stays asleep, I could give you a bath, and your hair a good wash. Is that okay?”
‘But what, doctor?’ You sounded so small, love, I couldn’t even tell you. I thought that you were going to burst out into tears right then and there, but you didn’t. Your face was as stoic as ever, but only I knew that it was because you were bracing yourself for the bad news. You knew just as much as I did what he was going to say.
Sherlock and Rosie surprise John for his lunch break.
John gave a loud groan. He wasn’t sure how Watson was going to react to the news. But something tells him that he would’ve found out anyway, chances are Sherlock blabbed already to Holmes. Hopefully Holmes reacted well to the news.
"Where did John go?"
John stared at his tea. He wasn’t in the mood for it anymore.
Sherlock's smile returned.
"Doctor? What say you?"
‘I’m going to give you back to papa now, you’ll forgive me Kylie, but holding you isn’t bringing me the happiness that I thought it would. In fact, it’s making me feel quite the opposite.’
"This may not be the best time, but you might want to cut back on acting like you're together," The Doctor said.
We both shared a short laugh. You always had a way of doing that. Of making me smile no matter how much I didn’t want to.
“Give her tummy a little massage, and feed her some mashed prunes or something. But be patient, love, don’t need her exploding.”
I nodded. That's not what I wanted to talk to you about and you knew it. It was obvious that you were unsettled by the upcoming appointment and I didn't like that. Not one bit. I nodded to myself because I knew what you really wanted, and what you really needed. I got up from the bed and then walked over to you. You looked bewildered at first, but when I wrapped my arms around you, you looked relieved, like all your troubles went away in that hug. I rubbed your back and I planted a few kisses to your cheek and head. You missed it, Sherlock. You missed the intimacy we used to have, so do I. I miss it each and every day. You were the one who pulled away and gave me a kiss. It was short, but it was much needed. We were staring at each other now. Your eyes looking right into mine, not moving. You looked so...so soft in that moment, Sherlock, it was almost as if I couldn't touch you because I would break you. Your face was so youthful...you never seem to age...I did the aging for the both of us. I wanted you in that moment, I wanted you so bad. The timing seemed perfect, Kylie was asleep, we were alone...if only you allowed me that Sherlock, if only. But that kiss was enough for me.
I smiled too at the sheer child-like joy of his and nodded. I patted him on the shoulder and headed over to the kitchen to start dinner. He sat in the chair and stared at his gifts the whole time I cooked and possibly after I went to bed.
"I forgot, you weren't entirely conscious when we met. Just go upstairs, I'll be back soon, okay?"
He ran over to John and clapped his hands on his shoulders.
“What’s going on here?!”
“Now now John, if we work together I’m sure we can find them. This place is only so big.”
“Ah, it appears little Rosie was worn down by our playing. She’s making excellent progress with her…”
There is a two-part finale! I'm sorry for the late update, busy weekend.
"You always were a clever boy, Sherlock."
'How're you feeling, Sherlock?' I wanted to know, you weren't as much of a talker that people thought you were, your silence was troubling. You took a few minutes to respond to me, you were fussing around with the small buttons on your impossibly tight shirt. I loved your shirts so much.
John woke up before Kylie. It was always this way on weekdays. He would wake up and make them both some breakfast and then the smell of the food would have Kylie racing to the dinner table in no time. Sherlock was gone. He was expecting this, Sherlock would show up for only a moment, and then, whenever John would fall asleep, or lose his focus, he would vanish again just to pop back up and torment John some more.The sad thing is that John shouldn't be looking forward to it, the two-second visits. He shouldn't be happy to see that transparent figure staring at him with those eyes that he missed terribly. He shouldn't be willing to ignore his daughter, just to be graced with Sherlock's visit for however long it may be.
I came back into the room at, I think it was a quarter to midnight, I can’t remember, time has no place for me anymore, Sherlock. I crept in the bed carefully, I thought you were sleeping, the light was off, and you were facing the other way so that I couldn’t see your face. You were still, and I was not. I wanted bodily contact with you, I wanted to shag, we hadn’t done that in months, and if we did, it lacked the spark it had before all of this.
“John I’ll be alright, The Doctor will not let any harm come to me.”
"Aha!"
"Anytime."
John shook his head. He hated lying.
Sherlock only smiled in response. John frowned.
"My leg hurts is all."
“Shut it, Sherlock.”
‘How’re you feeling, Sherlock? You’re not looking too hot.’ I asked you. I was speaking lower than usual because I wanted to enjoy the quiet, it wasn’t every day we got to sit like this, with no distractions, no interruptions, never mind the fact that we were inside of a cab.
“We should be off now, Doctor. I would like to see this thing through.”
He presumed correctly. I was your husband no matter what happened. I nodded too and gave him a look to let him know that we wanted to hear it; we wanted to get it over with. He agreed with me because he started flipping the pages on his clipboard and from the look on his face, I knew, and you knew that the news wasn’t going to be as happy as we wanted it to be.
"The...leg..."
“You’re just hungry, aren’t you?” Her sniffle only confirmed it. He took her to the kitchen to look for the formula. When he found it, he set her down in her highchair to fix her bottle. Rosie didn’t find her new placement agreeable and screamed even louder than before. Sherlock sighed and put the bottle down to get her back in his arms. He kissed her head and tried to shush her before she woke John up. He thought he succeeded, but he heard John’s feet and him saying, “I’m here Rosie…I’m…Rosie?”
I told you to take a seat; the only available one was your armchair. Of course you didn’t listen. Your eyes were shooting at all three of them like you were deducing everything on them, right to the last seam in their clothes or the last hair on their head. When you were finished, you turned your attention to me again and in your baritone voice, you said, ‘John, don’t do this.’
“I…I…don’t even know where to begin.”
“Oh I get it, you’ve seen one dimension, and you’ve seen them all, eh?”
They sat in silence for a while, watching the other children scurry about in their mundane games. Sherlock had a look of disgust on his face. It wouldn't have been so repulsive to him if they only invited him when he was younger. Young Sherlock had a look of longing and sadness as he watched them have fun and knowing that they would never ask him to play with them. Sherlock frowned once he caught Young Sherlock's face.
"It's not that I don't trust you, Sherlock, it's just the fact that...you know, maybe I'm not as willing to be trapped in a box with a man who looks like he's had some trips to the loony bin, is all."
“I’ve always been meaning to tell you, how I felt, for so many years, but we haven’t seen each other. We haven’t talked. I thought that maybe I could when I came back, but you were trying to propose to Mary and then every time after that seemed like an inopportune moment.”
Sherlock set his phone down and rubbed Rosie’s back as she slept. He felt his phone vibrate and picked it up immediately.
John’s grinned and kissed his head again.
“I think, it was because I’ve seen how Harry was treated because she was brave enough to show the world who she really was. I didn’t want to be treated like that, I wanted to do my best to fit in, so I’ve kept it locked down inside. But I always hated myself, I hated myself because I wanted to be brave, I wanted to be brave like Harry.”
"Hang on."
She was lenient with us on the first night, which was good. But then she got comfortable and decided that every other hour she would wake us with her wails of attention or hunger or something else. You pretended that you couldn’t hear her, so it was always me rushing to save the day, or what little sleep we had left. I spent so many days going to work exhausted, that I forgot that I was at work for a while. Thankfully, my boss understood, and she even took the time out of her busy schedule to reminisce with me the days when she was a new parent. I didn’t care much, obviously, but she was my boss and we needed the money now more than ever, so I sat there with the fakest smile I could muster, and listened to her drone on and on and on.
“The apple of my eye…” John finished. His cheeks were tinted red as he listened to Sherlock’s soft voice sooth the crying baby. Sherlock chuckled and kept singing, and John joined in with him, not caring how he looked to his boss or anyone that walked past his office. He knew this nursery song, and he missed the opportunity to sing with Sherlock last time.
"Suit yourself."
There were a few chuckles in the room.
“Sherl….”
Moriarty’s hand joined together in a slow, menacing clap.
"Why so glum, Sherlock?"
“You raise an interesting point, Sherlock. But, I can’t go on all of these….wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey adventures without my companions!”
You looked confused. It’s good to know we were on the same page.
"Stuff?"
The twisted smile sent shivers down their spine.
“What happened to her?”
It seemed like ages before John heard the shushing and hushes of the people in the crowd, and saw the remaining attendees standing up taking their seats. This was the moment he was waiting for, the moment they were all waiting for. Sherlock was coming. This was really happening. Trying his best to give the most arousing and excited stance and push away his worries and doubts, he stood up straight, like a soldier awaiting their captain’s orders. Though he was his own captain now, and his orders for Sherlock are his vows. The elderly woman took her spot at the organ and assumed the pose that she has no doubt had to sit in for years. She looked decrepit, and could keel over and die any minute. Hopefully, she could hang on, there’s no need to turn a wedding into a funeral, or a case, if Sherlock were to speak on the subject.
You were oddly quiet; love, but I understood the reason. You wanted to hear the news of our impending baby.
John’s eyes were wide at Sherlock’s words. They were glassy too and that nearly moved the brunet to tears. Sherlock smiled at John’s shock and kissed him on the mouth, he pulled away and saw that John’s mouth was still open. He kissed him again and again until John finally responded. When they pulled away, Sherlock moved to rest his head on John’s stomach when he heard John’s low voice say,
I told you that the painkillers should start kicking in soon and that all you needed to do was try and sleep. I placed the rubbish bin on your side of the bed so that you wouldn't get sick all over the floor. You whimpered for a while before you went to sleep again. I made a reminder to get you to take a bath once you woke up again. I cleaned up your mess as you slept.
“They fell out!”
I went back outside to find you sitting in the chair gripping the arms so hard that your knuckles were white. I simply laughed and took the seat next to you. You didn't even fight me when I pulled you into my arms, that's how worried you were. I stroked your curls and rested my lips on your head. I rocked you back and forth and whispered sweet nothings into your hair.
Watson turned to face John with the same genial smile on his face.
‘Shut up. You enjoyed it, I know you did.’ I was almost laughing, but then the beep from one of your machines stopped me entirely.
Without a word, Watson immediately joined John at his side and gave a small smile.
The Doctor's eyes darted from side to side and he clasped his hands together.
“What are you doing, Watson? If I had to guess, I should say that you are taking over my job.”
Greg nodded, he didn’t want any arguments or fighting, he needed to absorb the information, let it all sink in. He had a dazed expression. Mrs. Hudson stopped crying and let you go; she placed two kisses on your cheeks and then offered to take Greg to the door. It was just me, you, and Kylie left. Kylie was quiet as ever, in fact, I don’t think she was ever as quiet as in that moment. She probably sensed the mood. You rose from the armchair with your angriest face on. You looked down at me, and that made me feel a bit small, I have to tell you now.
“I do, I call you ‘my dear’ but I love your name so much, that I consider it a term of endearment on its own. Hearing your name, to me, is like winning the lottery, or cracking that unsolvable case, your name reminds me that I’m not alone, and that someone loves me, and that it’s okay to be loved and wanted.”
It was the TARDIS.
Sherlock was leaning against the counter with his arms crossed, watching as John washed both bowls with precision and thoroughness.
“It’s…you know him actually.”
“Because, Sherlock, they feed off of the time energy of your life. For however long you live, that’s how much they eat.”
“I started to see the real Sherlock Holmes, the one who made jokes, the one who had the awful laugh that I’ve come to adore so much, the Sherlock Holmes who’s terrified of spiders, the one that feels too much, the Sherlock that he’s locked away for such a long time. I’ve always caught the faces he made whenever somebody said something particularly rude to him.”
“I’m just saying that you don’t have to let everyone in, but it’s nice to have someone. I learned that.”
Our hands disconnected and she sank back into my chair. It is very comfortable.
"William Sherlock Scott Holmes."
"What are you going to do to him?" Sherlock snarled.
“You protect me, John. You. It’s always you, John Watson, you keep me right. And I know that I almost never say it, or when I do, it comes out as something completely different, but today is a special day for the both of us, and I think I can let myself say it now without worry of rejection.”
And then, you held your arms out for her. I was shocked, Sherlock, the last thing I expected you to do was express a need to hold her. You understand that you hadn’t so much as hugged her since she was born. Yes, you have come a long way since then, you kissed her and smiled at her and even addressed her whenever she was around you. It never got farther than that, sadly, and I remember wishing that maybe one day, you would finally acknowledge the fact that you’re her father and that she’s your daughter. I was so glad that that day finally came. I passed her off into your arms and was utterly surprised when you held her correctly in your arms. You’re not stupid, I know that, but you were inexperienced when it came to children, let alone infants. She flashed you her gums as you sat her in your lap. You examined her for a moment, and then you laughed and you hugged her to your chest. I think the realization hit you then. I heard you whisper her name, and I watched as you brushed some of her hair back with a smile.
When he gets home, Sherlock is fast asleep on the couch with Rosie tightly held in his arms. He carefully pulls her out of his arms, and puts her in her crib. When he returns, Sherlock is still laid out on the sofa, chest heaving slowly and mouth parted slightly, the low snores here and there. John would have taken a picture of him because he looked so adorable. But this wasn’t something that he normally did. John bent down and nudged him softly so he wouldn’t be startled.
John just chuckled.
“What’s gone. The wallpaper? Well, yeah I suppose it is but I think it’s quite nice.”
'Are you alright?' I whispered it to you because I felt like I was going to irritate you by speaking normally.
What I wanted to say is that he could just observe something about Sally and know what she wanted, or something she would appreciate. He shook his head.
After I put Kylie to sleep that night, I crawled back into the bed and you were still asleep. I stared at your sleeping form for a while before I fell asleep myself.
John never felt so much anger as he did in that moment. This angel was beginning to be the least of his problems at the moment.
Enjoy!
‘Good bye Susanne.’
"Mind letting me in?"
“What do you say we visit your father today for lunch?”
Sherlock’s eyes were watering up and he quickly moved to wipe away the tears that were falling. John looked to the crowd to see that majority of them were wiping their faces with handkerchiefs, or were sniffing away the tears, trying their best to keep a straight face, no matter how much they wanted to break down. Holmes and Watson were some of those people.
The Cyberman’s arm stops and the oil leaking down his face is now dripping down on to the rest of his body, but the urge to resist is failing, the John that is still existing inside the robot can’t bring himself to harm the man he loved.
John cut him off by saying, “Good girl!”
Kylie thought for a moment before she decided that he was right and walked up to Molly. Molly pulled Kylie into the tightest hug she could muster. When she released Kylie, John could see the poor girl's chest rising as she tried to catch her breath. Molly stood back up and motioned towards the empty jungle gym.
His speech wasn't as slurred like before, hopefully that meant that his concussion was starting to fade.
“You know that I miss my man.” Sherlock teased. John stood up and pulled Sherlock into another kiss. He opened the closet and pulled his jacket out. Sherlock walked out first and let John close his door. John signaled to the nurse that he was leaving, she, still on the phone, only waved.
"Oh yes you have!"
"My full name is John Watson, but you can call me Watson, Dr. Watson if you want to keep it formal."
“She does miss you, John, do not doubt that.”
“I…I do suppose I might have a few topics of discussion.”
“Nothing of importance, it’s just that, as much as I am loathe to admit it, having you to talk to is very…refreshing.”
“Thank you.”
“I’m terribly sorry, your obsession is misplaced, go and seek out another genius for your sadistic sport.”
Back to where it all began.
“Would you like to put that to the test?”
There we were, doing what he had done years prior when we first met, when we were both new to each other. Do you remember how it felt, Sherlock? Do you remember the adrenaline we both had pumping through our veins? The breathless laughter we shared as the wind crashed against our faces? The few minutes where our hands brushed up against each other, when we forgot, only for a second why we were running in the first place? I do Sherlock, I do. That moment was one of the last few times I saw your smile. Why didn't you smile more?
“When was the nap?”
Watson then started talking to Sherlock and John.
“I…I…wouldn’t know how to answer such a question. I have spent many years learning how to divorce myself from such a debilitating human feature.”
Just like that they left the flat. Before they could leave the building, they were stopped again by John.
Holmes rolled his eyes.
“Are you more focused on how the periodical difference affects our relationship, or how John and I…work?”
She said that to him when he announced her pregnancy on their wedding night. He wasn’t listening, he was too wrapped up in her, he didn’t see Sherlock alone on the dance floor with nobody to dance with, and he didn’t watch his friend leave the wedding alone. He found all this out from Molly, after Sherlock was long gone. He abandoned Sherlock for a whole month and spent it with Mary. Completely forgetting about his blog, and not remembering to update it with the cases that solved with Sherlock. He couldn’t believe that he would find Sherlock in the drug den, not when he spent so many years sober, but then he never thought about why Sherlock would end up there in the first place. He could never forget what took place over the course of the year. The highlight being when Mary shot Sherlock because she couldn’t let John find out about her dark past. She tried to kill his Sherlock out of love for John.  John spent a long time after that furious at her, and pissed off at himself for not noticing that she was hiding something. But something deep within him knew that she was dangerous, but he ignored it, and some part of him liked it. He forgot that she was carrying their baby and reconciled with her at Christmas, but he didn’t love her as much as he thought he did when they first got married.
He blinked twice and nodded.
Holmes faced John now. His eyes seemed confused and a bit lost, but he never faltered.
"It isn't, right Holmes?"
“What’s wrong?”
Sherlock’s voice was trailing off.
"It's my fault, I've done it to myself. The first thing I've thought when I held up the glass was, 'Sherlock wouldn't like this. He hates it when I drink.' But then..."
‘They said that they found somebody that was willing to give their baby to us, Sherlock.’
“Time to eat, love.” John’s smile made Sherlock dizzy. How could such a mouth show this much emotion?
“How nice of her.”
"Get your coat on, John!"
"Alright, this is where it gets REALLY bumpy! Hang on!"
“Yes, I could go for a cuppa at the moment. The trip here tired me out.”
“I hardly think anybody is going to care about the room’s decor once they find your bodies lying in it.”
‘Her name is Kylie, Kylie Holmes-Watson.’
"So then what would you have of us?"
That’s a word that he would have never imagined he would have to use on himself. He never expected to be
"The last time you said that, we ended up meeting Holmes and Watson."
“My word…”
Just like that he turned to leave.
That night, they were both in Rosie’s room trying to find ways to coax her to sleep. Sherlock was rubbing her stomach and shushing her, meanwhile John tried to give her warm milk. When she finally fell asleep, they stood over her crib and watched her little chest rise and fall softly. John yawned and said, “Are you ready for bed?”
John bit his cheek to prevent any noise from escaping his body. Sherlock wasn’t finished.
When he left, I held you closer and kissed your cheek. I might have said something to you, I was honestly too tired to remember. I fell asleep with the scent of your curls in my nostrils, and the warm feeling of your body pressed against mine, even though you had no top on. I remember rolling the blanket down to see where they operated. It was bandaged so I didn’t get a good look, not that it bothered me anyway, and I examined it when we got home anyway. While I slept, I slept in peace. There were no war nightmares, no tragedy, just me and you. I haven’t had those dreams in a while now…”
“Yeah but I have a later shift, it’s my payment for staying home again. Why, do you want me to stay home again? I can call and have my hours switched back to my old ones. It’s only for a day, at least.”
Sherlock's lip quivered.
He didn’t say anything else after that and I realised that he wasn’t going to. It doesn’t take the mind of one Sherlock Holmes to understand what he was saying. I couldn’t help but smile, I was quite flattered, actually.
‘What’s going on out there? Who are you looking at?’
I looked in the direction of my room and back at him.
Sherlock licked his lips. “I suppose it’s been a while since I’ve had John’s famous risotto.”
“Why didn’t they kill you?” Holmes inquired.
Did I look like I wanted to hear that news every time I went to see you? You would always listen to the doctor’s updates, and keep your sullen face on as he left the room. I would try to hold you, but you would stiffen. I didn’t want us to be distant, not then. Not at that moment. I let go of you, and then I laid down next to you in the bed. I didn’t want to hear it, I didn’t even want you to bring it up.
Watson couldn’t stop smiling, neither could John. In fact, this is the happiest that he’s seen him.
he looked. His body damp, with the beads of water on his blond chest hair, the towel wrapped tightly around his waist so that the roundness of his stomach hung slightly over the edge. His scar that stretched across his shoulder was a bit pink from being under the hot water. His hair, oh his hair, wet and long and styled into the swoop that Sherlock has come to love so much.
Kylie nodded enthusiastically and turned to face her. She gave a bright smile and said, "Yes, Nana I do."
Holmes's eyes narrowed as he listened to Moriarty's words. His lip twitched, but he gave no response. Sherlock didn't either.
This isn't why I've posted again in almost a century.
“Now let’s get a move on!”
“What is a TARDIS, Doctor?”
"Where are we going?"
I stopped you and told you that I was still in love with you. Nothing would ever change that.
Watson was making lively conversation, as was John, while Holmes and Sherlock just watched as their companions chatted with each other as if they’ve been friends their entire life.
“Ugh, yes. He claims that he needs eyes and ears all over the city, so he finds the homeless children, orphans who run amok in the streets and gives them temporary employment tracking down some person or another. I would argue but at least it keeps them from dying of hunger. He calls them the Baker Street Irregulars, he could’ve thought up a better name for them, but the little buggers love it. Makes them sound like they’re apart of some special spy group, no doubt.”
‘Yes. That or we could find a surrogate. I was thinking on asking Molly about the subject.’
The softness of his partner, his love.
Molly's eyebrow raised. "What do you mean by that, John?"
"This comes from the same man who wanted nothing more than to have them thrown back into the streets."
"What is it, Kylie?"
“I…what would you prefer we do then?”
Through those smiling facades, was the anguish and remorse of two men who couldn’t quite get the words out when they wanted to, and are now paying the price. Now the first thing they think when they see each other is one sentence, and one sentence only.
Sherlock was frozen, his eyes were fixed on the Doctor. What was he doing here? Why did he wait till now to come back?
"These eyes may not be as sharp as years past, but I warn you, I am a soldier and I am well-equipped to handle a fight, with or without arms so I shall tell you once again to show yourself!"
“Papa!” She jumped up and he caught her. He brought her into a tight hug.
~~~~~~
“Anything else, John?” Sherlock’s voice was as soft as he could will it, careful not to wake the baby up.
“Is there something you find interesting?” Holmes snapped.
“After that talk with Harry, I decided that you know, maybe it wouldn’t hurt to ask you, to try and convince you that you had nothing to hide from me. That we were in this together, you always needed reassurance on that. Normally, I wouldn’t listen to her, but that was one of the few times she was actually sober enough to make sense.
“That is…part of it. You know, we didn’t have to eat here. If there’s too many people we can leave.”
I didn’t have it in me to press you, so I accepted that answer and drifted off into sleep.
The irritation in Sherlock’s face dissipated and he lost whatever nerve caused him to get this far. John was rubbing his bare thigh now. It was so soft, and wet, and he smiled at the way Sherlock’s muscles loosened and his body slowly lost his tension at the simple touch.
"Doctor? Doctor who?"
"Nobody better has laid a hand on him."
John nodded, a smile was creeping onto his face.
John felt like he wasn't in his body, like he was on auto-pilot. He nodded and then left the flat to get Kylie.
John heard the slight change in Sherlock’s tone, and he immediately sniffled and shook his head.
Watson held a hand to his mouth as he heard John's words.
Watson laughed.
He lost it at Sherlock’s face. His mouth hung open and his eyes were wide. He was offended at John’s praising. “John Watson!”
I'll explain more about what happened during Watson and John's walk in the next chapter! This is the longest chapter yet!
“We’ll speak more on that later, Sherlock.”
"Sherlock!"
"Thank you. I was heading up there anyway."
"I wish I could see their faces, Papa. Jim Dear and Darling's face."
Mrs. Hudson came up to me and asked me if I knew why you were acting the way you were, and all I could do was nod and say, ‘My guess is as good as yours.’
I should have known that you were going to be so paranoid about it. If you didn’t know enough about something, you worried yourself with every little detail on the subject. I wish you didn’t scare yourself with all of that nonsense, Sherlock. Negativity, piled on top of more negativity, it’s just pointless. Or maybe, I shouldn’t be the one to tell you that would be a bit hypocritical I suppose.
“No, not that I know of.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Hey guys, I think it’s time we started heading back now, don’t you think? The sun is setting and wouldn’t want to be caught out here at night, oh no, not with all the cut-throats and thieves and…rats.”
Kylie looked up at John and saw that he wasn't really listening to her. She scrunched up her nose and said, "You know Papa, it's rude to ignore someone while they speak."
John gasped and almost fell on his cane.
“No, I guess you couldn’t.”
‘I wouldn’t say that I told him,’ You retorted, ‘He found out himself.’
Sherlock’s brows furrowed, “But I liked the movie nights, not to mention that recently they almost always end with us having…”
Holmes was getting irritated. He knew that it was useless trying to deduce in the dark, which is why he preferred not to be in it, but it would be so much simpler with two Sherlocks, just this once, at least.
"Ah, I'll show you, but you must follow me..."
Sherlock knew that John was angry at his sister, but that anger was made out of love for her. He hates seeing her hurt herself like that. Sherlock often wonders if that’s how it was for Mycroft all those years ago when he first found Sherlock drugged out of his mind and on the verge of death. He tried not to think about it. He forced himself to focus on this day, yes, this day of happiness. He heard Lestrade tap his fork on his glass to get the attention of the guests.
“Would you like some tea? I bought some whilst grocery shopping and I’m eager to find out what it tastes like.”
Sherlock cocked his head in utter confusion at John’s words. “And why would you think that I can ever grow bored with you, John? You said it yourself, your company is enough for me.”
“Get the glasses, love. I want to finish them before I start washing your hair.”
"So he's...still addicted then."
"The reason they have their eyes covered is so they don't make eye contact with each other. If they do, they end up staring at each other for all eternity, not being able to do a single thing about it."
'Hello, brother dear', you said to him. He only gave a quick nod and inched closer towards you. He was hesitant, like he didn't know how to handle your condition. I admit, I wouldn't be able to face it if my younger sibling were to contract cancer either.
John thought about that for a moment and then gave a smile. That made his night, Sherlock knew. He set the cup down and sauntered past John.
"Think Watson, think! They came here, they have knowledge of a world outside of our own! Think about all the secrets we could learn from them!"
She waved to you, but I don’t think you realized, you were lost in your mind trying to find some way out of your hopeless pit of boredom. Me, on the other hand was happy to see her, or maybe I was happy that she could finally see my baby, see how well I was doing while she was out getting wasted every other night. It’s cruel to think that, I know, but I’ve seen her do so many…reckless things, and then it got so much worse after Clara left her.
Sherlock and John were nestled in their bed together, sleeping. The sun wasn't quite out at the time, but it poked out enough to shine, the sunlight hit their bedroom window and beamed right in John's face. Sherlock had his face buried in John's back so he was unaffected by the harsh light. He groaned and pulled the blanket over his face, but all that did was make Sherlock stir around and moan as John tried to shield himself from the light and get a few more minutes of sleep since this was one of the few days he had no work and Sherlock wasn't on a case. He had to pull the blanket back down because Sherlock was starting to wake up, and he didn't want that. Sherlock just solved a case last night, and he hasn't slept at all during the full week it lasted, John practically forced him to sleep.
You were always the best at giving me dirty looks.
John's eyes danced away from Sherlock's as he nodded.
“Hey, love.”
“Did you hear that?” Holmes asked.
Sherlock walked into the room and gave him a kiss. John rubbed Rosie’s leg and said, “Hello, Rosie.”
"I don't know."
“We don’t have that long anyway! I’m coming up on sixty and you’re sixty-five, even if we went through with this, it wouldn’t work out. Believe me there is nothing I want more than to spend the rest of my life with you, but how much of our life is left?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Doctor,” Sherlock started, “What was that?”
Thanks again!
John's eyes danced away.
Sherlock’s eyebrows rose.
‘The unlucky ones…well…they stay unlucky.’ I didn’t want to talk about this anymore, I just wanted to get my things and for you to get dressed so that we could get out of the building.
“If you wish it, but for now, let’s save it and get on with our schedule.”
"Doctor, what's going on, what are you doing up here?" John asked.
“Doctor, quick, draw your weapon!” Watson boomed.
He let go of Watson and then spun around to face the other two. He pointed at John with a mad grin plastered on his face.
And the both of them crouched to the floor, letting the two angels make eye contact with each other and being stuck in their place. Watson however had to continue staring at his immobile attacker. John followed The Doctor's lead by crawling from in between the two angels. Once they were behind them, The Doctor ran to the last door of the corridor.
The Doctor considered all of this, but then his brows furrowed as he sat up.
John was silent.
You handed back over to me and then placed your hands on your lap. You smiled at me, and I didn’t know what to do so I returned the smile and then I left, not before I placed a kiss on your lips. I felt like there was nothing much to say after that. How could I possibly go back to having casual conversation after you practically said goodbye to Kylie? This was only the beginning, though. After this, came three long, depressing weeks.
He wrapped them both in a big hug, nearly squeezing the life out of them. Holmes looked up at the stage, it was empty, and out of all the instruments in the back, he found the one he was looking for. Immediately, he snapped his head towards Sherlock and John.
Holmes turned around to see Sherlock inspecting the cabinets and drawers. He found his way to the icebox and opened it to reveal a head in there. He immediately closed it and then looked at Holmes, before opening it again. Holmes watched in slight amusement at Sherlock’s reaction.
Harry’s thin lips curved into a small smile and her blonde bangs covered her right eye. She had an asymmetrical bob, and it suited her so well.
“Oh the days after Kylie was born, they were something indeed, don’t you agree, Sherlock? Even though you weren’t big on sleep, I saw it in your eyes every time Kylie decided to wake us at insane hours of the night, all you wanted was one night of undisturbed sleep. I told you the day before we went to get her from the hospital that you would have to kiss your blessed eight hours goodbye. As usual, you rolled your eyes and scoffed.
John folded the letter back up and then placed it back in the envelope. He bit his lip as he set it on top of the mound of dirt, and buried it with one hand. He rose back up and tried to think of something to say.
“Then it must be ‘what’.”
She squeezed his hand. "Great!"
Sherlock’s hands clutched to John’s hair at the question.
“How much money?”
He waved it in the air and as soon as both Sherlocks pulled the trigger, nothing came from the guns. Moriarty looked alarmed and quite scared.
Sherlock was holding Rosie’s hands and he watched John rush to the kitchen with a puzzled look. “I’d like a cup.” John nodded and started to look in cupboards for two cups, he hoped Sherlock wasn’t still staring at him, God he was an idiot. It was only one word, but he let it slip and now Sherlock thinks he’s an idiot. He let out a sigh of relief when he heard Sherlock laughing over Rosie’s mumbling. It made John’s heart sing when he heard her so happy. What he hadn’t expected to hear was Sherlock’s voice singing gently to the baby.
Sherlock chuckled and moved back over to her bottle. “We’re in here.”
John knew the look in Sherlock's eyes. He could smell the bullshit. John did it to himself, he almost hoped that Sherlock would give him a rundown like he used to do. John had to bite his cheek to prevent the smile creeping up on his face. This is the smile that Kylie should have gotten.
"Doctor, I know where I want to go, if it's not too much of a hassle for you."
I understood completely..."
And because said worthless person fell in love with him.
'It fell out...I was combing it and then it...it fell out...' You restated. Your voice was broken. I must admit, I would never have imagined you crying about hair, but you were. The tears fell from your eyes and slid down the uncomfortably visible cheekbones.
Sherlock placed two kisses to both of John’s cheek. He moved to John’s hair and ran his hand through it.
“Since you walked into the living area, naturally. I am not blind, Watson. Even when lost into the folds of my mind, my ability of sight still remains.”
While John, Watson, and The Doctor scoured the halls for them, Sherlock and Holmes were still tied to their chairs. Holmes has been trying to deduce every item in that room in hopes that it would get him and Sherlock out unharmed. Since the lighting was so poor, Holmes could barely make out anything that wasn't next to, or near the lamp. Every so often he would check to see if Sherlock was awake, but each time he looked, Sherlock was still out cold. He would give small jerks and make small noises here and there, but he never fully gained consciousness yet.
"He picked me up today."
The lights were dimmed, with only two shining down on the honored couple of the night, basking in the enjoyment of their relationship change. They stared into each other’s eyes luridly and refused to look anywhere else, their hands were clasped together and their fingers intertwined. Never have they looked as full of love and adoration as they did at that moment, and that moment exactly. If The Doctor could, he would frame this point in time forever as a sort of realistic picture that he could revisit whenever he so chose. He may be alone for a while because they don’t think married life goes well with time travel, but at least he was here to witness this.
The Doctor laughed.
'Please, John, I can do it...' Your voice died down and you left the sentence incomplete. I was almost done scrubbing your back, but the sound of your voice...it was so soft and so broken. I couldn't bear to see you that way. You were so confident and prideful, it was so hard to see you like that. You were desperately clinging to what you were before, Sherlock, and so was I. Sometimes I thought that I was sleeping, that we were on a case and of course you refused to let me sleep and so I ended up passing out in the chair. I wanted to believe that this was a nightmare, that I would wake up and have you lying next to me with your messy curls and sleepy face smiling at me. I wanted everything but what we were living to be true.
I held my breath as we entered the room. There Susanne was, she was absolutely exhausted, I wasn't sure if she was even awake. I wanted to take care of Susanne, that was the doctor in me, but the other part of me wanted to see my baby. Kylie Holmes-Watson. I heard the soft sounds of whimpering and immediately turned to face the source.
Wanting to see this “magical box”, I proposed that he take me to it when there was not a soul in the streets, so that I may form my own opinion on the matter. Naturally, he agreed.
“Sherlock…”
"You're special to him, look at what's he doing for you, he's losing sleep for you."
“Thank you.”
“John?”
on tumblr!
"It's like I'm talking to a bloody wall! Sherlock, talk to me!" If Sherlock had to bet, John was getting agitated.
Then came the nightmares, and then came the PTSD.
John cursed himself at the way Sherlock deflated. What was he doing wrong? What was making him unhappy when he was so cheerful a few hours ago? Sherlock sighed and looked down at his plate, twirling his spaghetti on his fork and eating it with a mournful look. John did the same and when he swallowed, he looked up and saw Sherlock with his puppy face. John smiled and said, “This is good, Sherlock!”
"I already have Ella. She's the person I go to talk to." He sounded more snappish than he wanted to. He was trying his hardest not to end the night on a sour note. Greg seemed unaffected. He was more concerned about getting his words out because there was a chance that John would have never heard them if he was completely sober.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock’s mouth tugged painfully into a smile. He doesn’t think he’s ever heard John talk about something other than him with such a happy tone. He did ask Sherlock about the flowers, but his eyes never left the variety of plants. Sherlock’s heart warmed to see John allow himself to be this vulnerable. He was always vigilant, always alert. He liked this side of John.
“Well how was I supposed to know the door was open? I was too busy making sure that Holmes didn’t turn your brain into mush!”
John snorted.
Moriarty grabbed Sherlock roughly by the wounded wrist and yanked him away from the situation in the hallway.
‘This young lady here refuses to let us see Sherlock! She says that we’re not allowed to see him, bollocks!’ If Mrs. Hudson could spit fire, she would have. Molly impatiently tapped her foot before she decided to chime in.
When he opened his eyes, it was still dark. Rosie still was not awake? What exactly did Sherlock do to get her to sleep. He should go wake her, she needed to be changed and fed. He rolled over and winced, his uninjured shoulder ached from Sherlock’s nails digging into his skin. He closed his eyes and smiled, hearing the way Sherlock said his name, he was begging, pleading for John. His eyes opened and lingered to said man. He was lying on his stomach, neck covered in love-bites, arse exposed. The only thing that was covered from the sheet was a small part of his leg. John bit his lip in arousal, he looked so good. Slowly he leant forward and peppered kisses all over Sherlock’s back, pausing whenever the man stirred. He propped himself up on his shoulder, wanting to take in all of his lover, his boyfriend. The moonlight shone on him perfectly, as if he were walking art.
There was dead silence again. I felt your lips press against my scar, as I went shirtless that night, and then you moved to my lips. I thought we were going to shag, but you pulled away and then rolled over to turn off the light.
‘So why are they still here?’ Your heart-rate monitor was beeping quicker as you tossed and turned and I was getting nervous. I responded with, ‘Because they care about you, Sherlock, that’s why!’ Your indifference towards them agitated me, I’m not going to lie. You stopped moving and then stared at me as you started to speak. You said, ‘I understand that John, truly I do. I’m keeping it in their best interest to keep them away from me.’
"John, don't make this harder than it has to be. Please, just sit in the chair."
I think I might make this a series, I think that this has the potential for at least two more parts.
John looked like the happiest man in the world. He kissed Sherlock once more and let him go to gather his things and assemble food and items for Rosie when Mrs. Hudson arrives.
The creepy smile widened and with a short laugh he said, "The name, Mr. Holmes is James Moriarty, pleasure to finally make your acquaintance."
She saw the way John's hand paused as he was scrubbing down his plate. Wasn't like he ate much anyway.
“He is driven by the fear of harm coming to Sherlock, just as you and I are. He’s also a soldier, and we are only restricted to but a few emotions.”
Greg cringed at being called by his rank. He maintained his professionalism and continued talking to John. He buckled the man in and clapped a hand on his shoulder. He took notice at how unresponsive John was being.
Holmes’s lip quivered a bit.
“You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. You make me happy when skies are grey…”
I told you that it was me, that I was there. You held your hand out, it was shaking a bit, I grabbed it and took a seat in the chair that was set next to your bed.
“Thank you.”
Sherlock's voice. It was Sherlock's voice talking to him. He brought his trembling hand up to his forehead. Not now, he thought, don't do this to me now.
"I met him when he was a kid, if you must know."
"Doctor...what was that all about? What aren't you telling me?"
“Come to bed with me. We’ll have an early night.”
He didn’t know how to respond to that. He gave me the genial smile and then went back to business. Frankly, I was glad he left that subject alone. I hated talking about my time in the military. In no time, he was flipping through his papers again and started speaking.
“Over time, you were seen everywhere with him, the doctor, your colleague, your flatmate, and I sat back and observed your behavior with him. And I noticed how different your attitude was towards him. You smiled a lot more, you laughed at his jokes, and you did a thousand times better on your cases, and started taking better care of yourself.”
Sherlock nudged him.
John drummed his fingers on the desk. Sherlock didn’t show up to the office for lunch. John headed out and grabbed a cup of tea with a pastry and ate with butterflies in his stomach. He fished his phone out of his pocket and called Sherlock. The phone rang three times before Sherlock picked up.
'So...where is she?' Molly was excited. Anyone in their right mind could see that.
Rosie was silent now but he could hear her soft noises through the phone. John was sitting in his office grinning like an idiot. One day he’s just going to sing to Sherlock, with Sherlock, he didn’t know. He just wanted to hear the man sing again. Sherlock was talking to Rosie now, “Are we better now?”
“Oh? What about Sherl…Holmes?”
---------
"Me?"
“If they touch you, they’ll send you a different period of time, it could range from the Victorian ages, to World War Two, and you’ll have to live the rest of your life out there, alone, and in an unknown place…you’ll have no way of ever coming back.”
"Sherlock!"
"Papa!" She screamed as she threw her arms around his legs. He smiled and ran his fingers through her hair.
John laughed at that and nodded. “Right. There’s a café just up the block, it has outdoor seating and I think it’s nice enough to sit outside, or do you want to pick up some food and sit in the park?”
“Don’t worry, it’s non-alcoholic, your buddy Mike stopped off at the shops earlier and brought me my own supply so that I wouldn’t…you know…” Her voice trailed off and her eyes wandered down to her glass. John stared at her for a while before giving a huff and then a tired smile. He clapped a hand on her shoulder, and her blue eyes trailed back up to his.
“Be what, John?”
"Doctor, Sherlock got addicted to drugs when he got older. It was pretty bad too, it was worse when he first started from what I've heard from his brother."
“John, look, it’s a cemetery.”
“When you get hungry, we’ll wake up and we’ll eat.”
I told you that I had to return to Kylie, that I needed to check up on her and that I would return tomorrow after work. I promised you. You shook your head, displeased with me.
John didn't want to say yes, and he didn't want to say no either. He didn't want to be rude either. Maybe they needed to talk more, to get a better understanding of each other. Discuss what's different and what's similar. Just...try to make the most out of this.
“Yeah but it’s not personal if we’re the same person, now is it?”
My computer's wifi isn't working so updates will be a little slower!
The rest of the evening was spent with Sherlock and John enjoying each other’s presence, and there wasn’t much talking involved. Every so often, John would catch Sherlock staring down at his food, his lip would quiver and he would set his fork down to wipe away the excess tears. It made John sad to see him so affected by his words, and he wished that the world showed him kindness from now on. He tried so hard, and he was a good man. They were the last to leave, of course, Angelo told them as politely as possible to leave. As usual, the men didn’t have to pay for their meal, but they tipped the man generously.
“Are you claiming to be better than me, Mr. Moriarty?”
"You installed cameras in my flat again?"
You turned to face me and Kylie. Kylie was at least three or four months old by then. As she grew, the only thing that got bigger were her adorable eyes and cheeks. She's such a pretty little girl now, Sherlock, I know that I'll have to knock some heads when she gets around boys later on.
“What have you heard, Holmes?”
I was cross, and if you hadn't stopped when you did, I think that I would have called Mycroft. I don't know what good that would have done, but I know that he would've gotten you admitted to Barts no matter how many times you yelled 'No' loud enough for the next door neighbors to hear us.
“Oh that much I know, Holmes has the same brother, I too think that he has a lot of explaining to do for his brother’s cold demeanor. Holmes barely speaks a word of his childhood, but I do hope that he hasn’t had to go through the same rough one as your Holmes does.”
John didn’t want it to happen like this, but he needed Sherlock to vent. Nobody should have so much pent up inside of them. Sherlock sat there, in his calm and cool demeanor. Who knows what he was thinking about? John was very worried and was going to make his way over to him when Sherlock finally opened his mouth.
He heard the rope snap as the blood started flowing through his wrists again. They made his hands feel funny but he ignored the feeling. He looked down at his wrists, definitely rope burned. He bent down to untie his ankles that were numb as well from lack of blood and let the rope fall to the floor. He stood up but had to catch his balance on the chair as his legs were not prepared for the sudden movement. He stopped himself from falling on the floor thankfully. When he regained his balance, he dusted off his coat and his pants and swiftly made his way to Sherlock's chair. Kneeling down to get Sherlock's binds off, he started whispering in his ear.
“I love you too, John.” He hung up and sank back in his chair.
John hadn’t meant for all of that to come pouring out, but he hated to see Sherlock think so lowly of himself when he was of the highest importance to him. He wished that he was with Sherlock when he was a child, that they became friends in primary. He wished in that moment that he could shield Sherlock from all the bullies and haters that made him feel like he was anything less than the extraordinary man sitting across from him.
John tried his best to look defeated.
‘I got a call today; it was from the adoption agency.’
John sat up in his chair.
He took the spare key from the kitchen and clicked all the lights off before leaving the flat. He hailed a cab and held onto the baby tightly as they traveled to the clinic. When they got there, he walked up to the receptionist and put on his politest smile. She set the phone down and immediately began to dote over Rosie, who was busy twisting around surveying the new environment.
Sherlock took out his sunglasses from his coat pocket and slid them on as he walked over to the little boy who was sitting down in between the two trees. The Doctor kept a watchful eye over him.
People like Sherlock, the geniuses that’ve been outcasted, exploited, ignored. Used until he’s no longer useful and then treated as if he’s less than a human. He kissed him again, his screams have stopped and now he’s only crying softly onto his chest, his hands clutching at John as if he too were a figment of his imagination only created to torture him.
“And how are we feeling about that?”
The smile on my face could not be contained. You would have never said these things to me on an ordinary day, if you did, it wouldn’t be this straight-forward. Then, I wished that you hadn’t said all of those wonderful words to me, and that I wished that I said something remotely close to yours. All I said was ‘Holmes-Watson.’ You grinned at the correction and then you let me hold you, proper that time. I never let you go that night, nope, I wouldn’t dare. I didn’t want you to go anywhere.
John walked into the room and joined his sulking boyfriend on the bed and kissed him. “You know I don’t mean it, love. If anything, I’m more grateful that you helped Rosie with her stomach pains.”
“One can only hope…”
“Would you have even returned the feeling? For all of the times that people thought we were a couple you were always keen on shutting them down.”
Nobody spoke for a while; the only noise was their breathing and Sherlock’s heartbeat.
“You wish that it was us in their place, isn’t it Holmes?”
He didn’t miss the way Sherlock’s eyes closed and his body flinched at being called love. He swallowed and clenched and unclenched his fists.
"You called me, papa?"
“Yes?”
"What are you doing Doctor?"
"Of course, if you'll follow me."
“John!”
Sherlock's first night with John and Rosie
“Nonsense! Now let’s go, we must be quick!”
“Oh? Care to clarify?”
“Here you go.”
John chuckled. “I know, but I thought that we could marathon films you’ve never seen.”
"Don't we all Molly. Don't we all..."
So this Holmes has a drug addiction too. He wondered if they were their ancestors or something and addiction ran in the family, but another part of him refused to believe in that theory because these two had the exact same names as them, they had the exact same professions, and they lived in the exact same flat as them. Something was wrong and the Doctor needed to turn up soon before John lost his mind. Watson looked back at John who was being so gentle to Sherlock, who was now falling asleep.
With a certain heaviness in my body, I felt like my legs couldn’t support the weight anymore and I too sank down onto the bed with you. No one said anything, because nobody could. I just stared at the orange bottle, with your name printed out in bold and clenched my jaw at the prescription. It was depression, out of all things, love.
"Look less sad, John."
“We should do something about this, should we?”
"Well, I don't have an idea for once. Surprise us, you're good at that, aren't you?"
“What a lucky, lucky man I am.” He sighed.
“John Watson has been Upgraded”
“Your turn.”
Said man lifted his hands in surrender at John’s exclamation. His cheeks tinged red and he said, “John, you know that shopping is not my skill. I’ve not quite got your knack for it. We left shortly after our phone call and Rosie felt a little better. You know that I want everything to be perfect for you when you get home because you’re always so tired and stressed when you come back.”
I got you upset, but that wasn’t my intention.  But you let out a huff and then ran a hand through your fine curls that I have spent many nights tangling my fingers in.
“So you don’t wish for change.”
'But Sherlock, that doesn’t mean---‘
And, what's more, the boy had a clearly distinct English accent. That's when he put it together, they were still in England, and they went back in time instead of forward. He saw people gazing at the police box with curiosity before returning on their way, no doubt trying to mind their business. The Doctor went back inside and closed the door. Sherlock and John were staring at him, waiting for him to say something so that they can embark on whatever it is he has planned, but at the sight of his face, they were worried.
Comments and kudos are welcomed!
Taking a deep breath and clearing his throat, he opened his mouth to begin reciting his vows to Sherlock.
No more words were exchanged, and frankly, Watson was tired. He let out a yawn and stretched.
‘And what about the other people, the unlucky ones?’ You were so eager to find out about this surgery, and since I was the only doctor in the room, all the answers had to come from me. I was surprised you didn’t know the statistics already. You probably deleted it.
"Is that all you can recall?"
"Sorry?"
“I’m going to touch you now, okay love? Can I?”
“These types of places always send chills down my spine,” Watson said.
“Mike introduced him to me; I just kind of passively greeted him and didn’t spend too much time on him. I think I just wanted him to leave more than anything, if he didn’t agree to be my flatmate of course, which I expected him to decline. He was at the flat; I took that as a good sign. But he complained about my mess when we got upstairs, but I didn’t hear a no. I thought that he was going to leave for sure after we solved that case together. It’s on John’s blog.”
I nodded and we headed out together. Thankfully, there was a cab outside of the hospital; it just finished dropping off some customers. It was a man and a woman, they were accompanied by a small child, and she looked like she had the flu or some sort of virus like that. I inched over to the side so I wouldn’t be in close contact with her. You hopped inside of the cab and already gave our address before I could close the door. The ride home was quiet, I was listening to the droplets of rain hit the windows of the cab. You moved closer to me and I felt your hands intertwine with mine. You were resting on me, but it was only noticeable to me, the cabbie was too busy driving to focus on us.
“John, I hardly think telling her this will do anyone any good.”
"I'm fine. Why, what's the matter?"
"Take your bath, and then dinner, and then our movie night. Sound good?"
"What's the matter? You have been quiet for hours now."
"I'm sorry, who are you?"
You were in the room, I remember now because your hair was mussed up and your eyes were squinted and you looked perfectly human, Sherlock. You looked around and saw them sitting there, Molly bouncing Kylie gently on her knee, Mrs. Hudson’s eyes darting around the room looking for something to clean, and Greg looking exhausted as usual, but he tried to stay alert because he knew that something was wrong. I looked up at you and you were staring at them with such intensity. Molly flashed a glance at you and gave you her warm smile before focusing back on Kylie. You took a step back; you knew what was going on, because I warned you a few days back. I told you that they had to know now, before the surgery or before you get worse and you weren’t happy about it, but it had to be done.
She winked and left the flat without making a sound. If she was a bit younger, and really wanted to, she could've made the best thief in London.
“Christ, Sherlock.”
In almost no time, I was curled up in the bed with you again. I told myself to start on supper once we woke up. You were important in that moment, you were always important. Kylie managed to lull herself to sleep, and the flat was quiet. Instead of watching you sleep, Sherlock, I slept with you. Of course, that didn't last very long.
‘We can try to remove the cancer cells since it isn’t too serious yet,’ the doctor droned. I never did get his name, and I didn’t want it. ‘However, that would require surgery, if you are willing to do it, that is.’
“No dinner? I don’t want to ruin your night, John.”
“You two are big on appearances, aren’t you, very shallow indeed.”
They ate in pleasant silence. The only noise in the flat was the movie, and occasionally Rosie’s whines for some of Sherlock’s food. She found her place back in his lap and decided to join them in their movie-watching. The men laughed at her lip covered in drool from the sight of their food, eventually, Sherlock gave in and let her have some of the rice which he softened for her. Every other bite, John would put his fork down and watch Sherlock. He looked on fondly as the man would sigh and give Rosie more rice, when a particularly exciting scene happened in the movie and Sherlock stopped moving to watch it, he was happy to see Sherlock happy and content. He was excited at the fact that Sherlock was happy and content with him. The lights were off and John couldn’t help but bask in Sherlock’s silhouette from the TV light. How could a man be so beautiful and find someone like him worthy of their time?
"Brilliant!"
John didn’t reply. Greg shut the door and watched the car pull away with a father who just lost his child. John almost told the driver to take him to the nearest pub, but then that’s what got him in this mess in the first place. The sky looked grayer to him. In fact, everything was duller now that Kylie wasn’t around. He didn’t even want to think about the flat without her in it. Didn’t he wish for this though? Didn’t he spend so many nights, watching her sleep, thinking about dropping her off at Mycroft’s house? Looking for an alternative to living with him?
And pretty soon, the pair was sleeping.
John glared at The Doctor and then began to make his way out of the room with Watson in tow. The Doctor eventually made his way besides the two.
From Young Sherlock's facial expression, he knew that he was right. But he didn't need to see his face, he already knew because he lived it.
“Don’t just stand there, help me test her bottle.”
“You won’t accomplish anything standing here.” He whispered to himself.
“Where could they possibly be, Holmes? They’ve been out for hours, the sun is about to rise.”
‘Yes.’ Was your curt response. You still didn’t face me.
"John..." Sherlock whimpered.
John, on the other hand, walked hand in hand with Kylie and listened to her as she told him about school.
"T-That's...fine...I don't mind."
“Yes. Well there still are some that are opposed to people who have relations with the same sex, but they are few compared to the others that support it.”
He never missed Sherlock as much as he did now. What he wouldn’t give to feel Sherlock’s kisses, to hear Sherlock’s voice in his ear. What he wouldn’t give to have him back. He drank and drank some more that night. He didn’t want to remember what happened, he didn’t want to feel anything. He didn’t want to know what it felt like to have Sherlock and Kylie. He didn’t want to be, anymore.
"Now what must I do?!"
‘It’s hard to say, Sherlock, some people are lucky; they get to the cancer before the cancer gets them.’
John phoned his job and told him that he was going to be attending to a patient, and wouldn’t be coming in. He felt that they didn’t deserve to know about Sherlock’s personal problems. The media already had a field day with him when he jumped. John felt sick to think about all those news articles that called his Sherlock, his love a “fraud” “phony” “fake”, and demean him and destroy all that he worked hard to prove.
Sherlock’s cheeks tinged red and his hand settled back on his lap. It wasn’t easy to make him bashful, but John always found it lightened his mood to see Sherlock care enough to become shy.
"I got the highest mark on the test today, Papa. The teacher said that I'm one of her 'brightest pupils.'"
“I’m your blogger, aren’t I?”
“….And then…there was that day,” Lestrade was getting choked up.
Watson gave his shoulder a few pats.
Sherlock wanted to be angry with John for being so stubborn but he couldn’t stop blushing.
"Holmes!"
The boys have a heart-to-heart
“Yes, how did you know?”
“I am, Watson. Have I no right to be envious?”
The Doctor was beaming and began to race up the stairs.
“Don’t worry, I promise this won’t take very long, if you are able to spot the clues.”
The boys elevate from lovers to boyfriends!
“Me and you, let’s go to Angelo’s for dinner.”
'I have, and I've been told that I'm to start chemotherapy.' You said without even looking up at him. Your eyes were closed. He looked disappointed, if that's even the right word for the way he looked. I don't know why he couldn't just tell you that he was worried about you, why he had to create a bigger rift between the two of you. It was apparent that he loved you, Sherlock, he only needed to say it.
John laughed. The man could be butt naked, and still act like the most pompous ass in the room. John took the time to survey Sherlock. He was so thin, yet, he had muscles from all the cases he’s taken on and solved. All the years of fighting and trying to be strong. He looked like something out of a museum.
"It's alright, I'm a doctor too, I can help."
“I know you are, John.”
"Whatever are you doing, sir?"
"Sherlock?! Sherlock! Answer me! What is going on?!"
John saw Sherlock’s face soften. He always hated seeing Sherlock so vulnerable because he knew what was going to happen next.
Those voices belonged to Watson and John. They were so close.
Before John could disappear out of their sight completely, they managed to catch up with him in search of Holmes and Watson.
So, he stayed home with him, taking care of Sherlock and Rosie as he thought of ways to get the love of his life help. He waited until they were both in bed, John had a feeling that Sherlock would find a way to leave the bed again and waste the rest of the night watching crap telly, so he had to speak to him sooner than later. Sherlock had turned off his lamp, only John’s side of the room was lit. John knew he wasn’t asleep. He rolled over, he wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s waist and nuzzled his nose into the inside out shirt.
It was awkward, the initial conversation. There was so much to talk about, but not one of us knew how to get it out. We were standing there, staring at each other with all the emotions pooling at our eyes, but not wanting to actually show them because that wasn’t who we were.
Sherlock’s face was as red as could possibly be. John laughed, showing all his teeth this time. Sherlock liked the fact that he was so happy. That he finally felt good enough to laugh with him.
Figures you would get mad at me for asking if you were alright because you doubled over in pain in mid-chase. I was being irrational, right? Thankfully they were caught, and the other group as well. Lestrade looked on proudly as the people who have been evading their inevitable arrests were finally going to be locked up, and if I know him well enough, they were going to have a pretty hard time getting bail. You were supposed to be proud too, but you weren't, I thought it was because of me that you looked disappointed, that you didn't get to them first, I didn't want to ask. I watched you, Sherlock, I saw that you weren't even paying attention to the arrest. You were upset about what happened in the alleyway, I knew that much, but it wasn't because of me. It was because you were mad at yourself.
'What brought this about?’
‘If you must,’ you sighed.
Sherlock shook his head and John got excited. “Well then, I believe it’s a date.”
Sherlock shuffled in the couch, thinking of something to say. He never was good with conversation with people, it was even worse with people he didn’t know, it never even gotten that far sometimes, they would simply call him a freak, or some other harsh term, and then walk out. Sherlock learned how to tune them out over time, but there were still just some moments where those terms found a way to get to him.
“My great aunt always talked about you, and she has pictures of you and Sherlock Holmes, many pictures. She used to show it to me all the time when I was younger.”
'Mister Holmes-Watson, I presume? Or should I be calling you Doctor?' He wasn't trying to sound like a prat, but he was the result of a privileged man who was given even more privilege. I bet he felt closer to God with all that power. It's not like you would know anything about being middle-class, Sherlock, you were posh, and a tad snobbish. I do think that you would have hated this man if you weren't ill at the time, Lord knows that I did. I gave a smile, a very terse one at that.
He kept rocking Sherlock and stroking his messy curls, hearing the sobs coming from his Sherlock and he willed himself to keep singing. He wanted Sherlock to be okay.
"Wait," Watson called.
My dreams consisted of you being in pain, Sherlock. Pain I couldn't stand to watch."
John can’t remember the last time he had been so happy to just stay in his home with Rosie. He was resting his back on the arm of the sofa watching Sherlock play peekaboo with Rosie on the floor. She was just as infatuated with him as he was. Sherlock was simply that wonderful. Did he know this? Sure, he had his moments of being particularly nasty, but so does everybody. But that’s because everyone else made him feel like that it was the only way to live. Sherlock didn’t allow himself to be this soft with anybody besides himself and Mrs. Hudson, sometimes.
“I can make some tea for you. And we still have biscuits.”
'...Tomorrow...' You breathed. Mycroft was frozen for a good minute before he found the words and actions. Which were very few, I might add.
Feel free to ignore this.
But then Moriarty showed up, and all of that mess happened on top of St. Barts, and I had to watch you…”
The Doctor said, "John actually forgot about your birthday today, so he had me distract you while he planned a last minute birthday party. Isn't it amazing?!"
He placed them in a vase and stepped back to admire them.
"So you keep reminding me."
Greg tried to shrug off the hurt from John's anger-filled response.
“Why did you even show up, Doctor? You still never told us.”
(See the end of the chapter for
~~~~~~~
“I missed you, John. I waited for you every day. I thought that maybe if I did something, play your favorite song on the violin, clean the flat, go on a case, you would come back. But you never did.”
"So what are we going to do now? Can you get us out of here?"
“Why can’t I have you the way I want you?”
He looked down and saw Sherlock’s long fingers wrapped delicately around his smaller hand. Sherlock was lying on his side, Rosie in between the two men, babbling away with Sherlock occasionally responding.
“So where you do think you might be?”
'You'll break Mrs. Hudson's heart, you know, by not permitting her to see you.' I wanted to see if you were mulling it over in your mind. If you really wanted this. You closed your eyes and slid under the covers of the bed with your back facing me.
John shook his head, still confused about the whole situation. The Doctor's smile widened.
“There are some things that we want that we can never truly hope to have, Holmes. You eventually learn to accept it and make the best out of what you already possess.”
John turned his head to face Sherlock’s. There was something that made his boyfriend so tender, the white pillow that he was resting on, the sun shining right on his pale skin, illuminating him into what John liked to think, a work of art.
“John!” They both exclaimed as they ran over to him. He was unconscious, that much was clear. The Doctor bent down to examine John further as Sherlock searched around them with his flashlight. Nobody was there. He was going to turn his attention to John when he felt something prick him in the throat. He touched it and it was a poison dart.
"We could make a paradox in time and trap them all in there, but I don't have my TARDIS with me, so that plan goes into the trash."
Sliding on his last glove he turned to John with his brightest smile.
"Really? My word, Holmes is the same way!"
John was still screaming her name. Even though Greg was pushing him farther and farther away from her. He saw her giant blue eyes staring at him with tears spilling from them. She saw Sally’s hand resting on her shoulder, and Mycroft standing behind her, just staring at him. How dare he? How dare he look at John with remorse? He planned this, he knew that this was going to happen. Was this why he supported John for so long? Why he paid his rent without any sort of repayment from John? He expected this, of course he did. He wanted John to slip up like this. John’s face was so hot from anger. Mycroft took Kylie away, his pup, Sherlock’s little dove. Greg was speaking to him as he opened the door to the car that brought him to this godforsaken place. John stopped moving as the front door closed behind him. She couldn’t hear him anymore, it was over, and Mycroft had her now. He felt his body being pushed down and then the familiar feeling of the leather seat against his hand.
Watson seemed a bit unsure.
"Well...get a room you two."
“And if we both manage to shoot and kill you?” Holmes interjected.
Some mornings, typically weekdays, he would wake up and say, “Kylie, time to wake up!” then he would pause and remember where she was, and how she got there and then John’s body would get heavy again. He closed the door and walked into the kitchen. There would be no alcohol tonight, his headache was too much to bear. He dropped an Alka-Seltzer in his water and watched it dissolve in the liquid. He didn’t move for a few minutes, he found himself moving slower than he usually would. He took a shower the night before and discovered that he lost weight. About five pounds or so. He hasn’t had a full meal in a while, this was bound to happen. He did shave that night, he could feel his cheeks thinning without the stubble redirecting his attention. He sighed. He was always tired now, and there some days where he didn’t even get out of bed. What did he need to move for? There was no one left. It was just him, he was always alone.
“Well, you’ve always had a way with words, John.” He tried to make his voice steady, to take his mind off flat out bawling in the middle of the park. He gasped when he felt John’s lips kiss his salty wet cheek.
John nodded.
"Something on your mind?"
“Everybody is gone. Mycroft died. Mrs. Hudson died. Molly is sick…Lestrade….”
"Sorry, John didn't forget your birthday; this was all part of the plan!"
The church was filled with the screams of joy and excitement as Sherlock and John shared their kiss. This was it, they were husbands now. This is more than any of them could ever hope for. Now they were the Watsons, or in Sherlock’s case, Holmes-Watson, and he couldn’t be any happier. When they pulled away both men turned their heads to the pews on the left-hand side of the chapel. Towards the back they could see the people they wanted to most.
You were sat on our bed one night, or was it in the afternoon? I forget. You weren't under the covers, you were just sitting there. You looked miles away, and you were frowning. Your frowns killed me, I just wanted you to smile like you used to, Sherlock. I was stood in the doorway for a while, about five to ten minutes. You didn't even blink. I walked over to you and I said your name once, twice, three times and there was no response. I was going to leave you alone and let you have your privacy but then I heard your baritone voice.
Sherlock responded, "Yes, John 1890." we're in a time-machine, the TARDIS is a time-machine, got it?"
"Says the one who had us kidnapped from out home," Holmes added.
‘I would never leave the flat. I wouldn’t watch telly, I wouldn’t do anything. I’ll spend the rest of my days bawling my eyes out for you. I would avoid anything that reminded me of you, because I’ll spend so much of my time imagining that you’re still here with me, and then to see a photo of you or anything else, I’ll lose it.’
"Don't move, don't do anything...."
They both looked up at him and then quickly separated and stood up, brushing themselves and each other off. John was smiling to hide his embarrassment and Sherlock's cheeks were as red as roses.
"Hello, pup."
That was all he would say before going about his morning. John agreed. He missed the familiar grooves of the armchair from his time away. He missed the sensation of Sherlock being near him, his scent filling the air whenever he walked in. It just wasn’t the same without Sherlock.
The Doctor's hands rested on the panel and his hair fell in his face as he nodded.
I wrapped you into a hug, which you were completely unresponsive to, it didn’t matter.
John thought about putting up a fight, but Kylie was in the car, he resigned to let Mycroft have it his way.
"We'd better be off now." John squeezed Kylie's hand and turned to walk away. Before they were able to leave Baker Street entirely, Kylie turned around and said, "Thank you for the food, it was delicious!"
While he drank, he looked up at the fridge and saw the post-it note he wrote for Kylie.
The boys predict what Rosie's first word is going to be
"Papa, come on!"
“Just toast and tea will do.”
One last tab open, of course I had to click it.
“Are you sure? Last night he looked ecstatic to be going to Angelo’s. Maybe he’s only waiting for you to ask him properly. Do you agree?”
Sherlock glared but then reluctantly nodded.
“Sherlock, look at her, she absolutely adores you. I know you won’t hurt her.”
But John looked so happy to be with him, to hold him, to kiss him. How could he deny the man that he loved such a simple request? He nodded and let the man guide him to his room. It wasn’t Sherlock’s room, he couldn’t call it theirs. He settled in first, and patted the empty spot for his boyfriend to join him. Sherlock crawled in, desperate to be as close to John as possible, wanting his face to be buried so deep into his jumper that he could feel the beating of his heart underneath. He wanted to be calmed by his love’s presence, he didn’t want to think that he didn’t belong, he wanted John to hold him and to kiss him until his lips were ready to fall off. He wanted them to be back at Baker Street, it felt
John never understood why he said that, but now he does. Sherlock told John that he was losing him, that he was Mary’s now. John wasn’t going to need him anymore because he’s going to have a family, a real family, and there was no room for him. How wrong he was, John needs him now more than ever. He opened his eyes, and they wandered him over to the band again. He can’t wear this around, it reminded him of a time where he thought everything was better, but it was only tragic. What he wanted was Sherlock. Sherlock was the only thing that could save him from himself. He grabbed his cane, clenched his jaw and the rose up from his miserable chair and walked out of the house to go find the one person who can make everything right again.
I'm sorry.
"Precisely."
‘I don’t want to get attached to her. I don’t want to become so dependent on her affection for me that when the time comes…I won’t be able to handle it. It’s bad enough with you---. ‘You were going to say something else that would frustrate me, so I had to stop you. I took your hands in mine and rubbed them softly, oh so softly. I found the strength to look you in the eyes and with the most comforting voice, I spoke, ‘Don’t speak like that, Sherlock. That’s not how this is going to end, I promise you. You’re going to be okay. We’ll be okay…’
"Where would you like to go, John?"
"Alright, okay, good, this is very good! Now we have to lure on more out!"
"Can you hear that? Those are your companions coming to find you."
John thought.
“What?”
John looked like he wanted to say something, but he remembered. He's in a public place, with a friend. The last thing that needs to happen is his waking up in a cell. John speed walks over to the coat rack and gets his jacket. Greg follows after him.
'I've seen better days, Mycroft.' you answered. I had the strange notion that the conversation wasn't going to last very long. Sadly, I was right.
John hesitated for a moment. He knew of Sherlock's past drug use, hell, there have even been times where he had to slap the syringe out of Sherlock's hand or take care of him while he went through withdrawal. Sure he hasn't seen as much as Greg and Mycroft had, but he's seen enough to be worried about introducing Sherlock to a new drug. With a sigh, he nodded, it was for Sherlock's health, and we couldn't bear to see him in pain.
‘They may be for precaution, Sherlock, but it’s nearly empty.’ I sounded so defeated. You heard it in my voice because your eyebrows softened, and your perfect mouth was shaped into a frown. You weren’t trying to upset me, I know that now, but you ended up doing it anyway.
Sherlock blinked and turned to face him.
The car pulled up in front of Mycroft's home. It wasn't as big as some of the other houses, but it was still a decent size. The driver opened the door for Mycroft, who got out and then opened the door for Kylie and John. He held his hand out for Kylie's small one to grab, which she did. John closed the door behind him and stared up at the house. Whatever was going to happen next wasn't good. How long has it been since he's seen Mycroft? His head hurt, and he wanted nothing more than to be resting in his chair. Mycroft and Kylie were waiting for him at the door, he didn't move, even though that's what they were waiting for. He gave in and walked over to join them. When Mycroft opened the door, John felt this wave of unease wash over him. Mycroft shut the door behind them and led them down the long hall. It wasn't how John expected it to look, the decorum was lavish, of course, but it wasn't over-the-top. You could tell that Mycroft kept up appearances, but he didn't spend every waking moment stressing over the price of his interior. He was rich, but not showy about it. John strayed behind Kylie and Mycroft.
‘He’s been…he’s been better…’ I told him.
John’s breath hitched and Sherlock rolled his eyes in annoyance. It was his turn to cross his arms.
Watson could not handle it any longer; Holmes was being extra vulnerable since they’ve encountered Sherlock and John. Maybe this was a good thing.
“…This isn’t how I wanted you.”
“You know what I say, Watson, when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains,
John sniffed. She didn't mean to make him angry. This was the reason why she hardly ever had conversations about her father, either John got upset or sad enough that he would drink from his bottle and won't stop until he fell asleep. She's only seen him do it once before, but after she told him about what happened, he told her that he would never do it again. She trusted him enough to take his word. He hasn't done it since then.
"Do I mind? Look who I'm getting married to."
When he wakes up the next morning, he feels shooting pain in his head. He expected it to happen, he deserves it, quite frankly. Kylie is already gone, he can hear her singing in the bathroom. Good girl, he thinks to himself. He rubs his eyes and feels the moisture on his cheeks and on the bags of his eye. He promised himself that he wasn't going to do this. He can't even trust himself anymore. He wiped away any tell-tale signs from his face and then got up from the bed and walked to the kitchen. He fixed himself a cup of water and dropped the seltzer into the liquid and watched it dissolve. He took a sip from it and heard Kylie open the door. She was already dressed and walked over to John with a smile on his face.
"Sherlock, did you hear that noise? Who is that outside screaming your name? Do you know him?"
'He's ill and there's nothing I can do to cure him. You can forgive him if he's a bit distant, Kylie, he's just really sad and he doesn't know how to handle it.' I pressed my lips to her forehead and gently rocked her back and forth. You were deathly quiet in there and I didn't stop worrying for a second.
“It’s, uh, it’s alright.”
“Do you? I guess I’ll have to call you that more often, won’t we?”
“So you just want us to stay here, instead of with you where our chances of survival would be better.”
Sherlock smirked.
“Come, let me take your coat. Get comfortable Sherlock, really. It would make me happy to see you enjoying yourself. And I think Rosie is looking forward to living with you.” They both looked down at the infant who found her current enjoyment in eating her fist. John nearly sighed at the sound of Sherlock’s breath of laughter. He let John slide his coat off him slowly and whispered, “How can I deny you, John? Anything for you.”
John caught that. The Doctor changed his words, whatever he found out, it was startling enough that he couldn't even say what he initially wanted to. John decided to ignore it for now, Sherlock was more important right now. Who was he kidding? Sherlock was always important. John's hand moved from his cheek to his curly hair and began to run his fingers through it.
Sherlock and the Doctor shared a laugh at that, which made John's agitation come back.
After Kylie was taken care of, it was our turn to eat. I asked you what you wanted and you responded with takeaway. I do admit that at the time, some General Tso's chicken sounded good and I'm sure that you weren't going to disagree. I would have let you order your usual spicy garlic chicken and white rice, but I was worried that your stomach wasn't going to agree with it and so I talked you into getting some soup. We settled on Wonton soup. You took small, careful sips, and occasionally sprinkled some of the egg foo young inside of it. As I ate I kept a watchful eye over you.
John's laugh reverberated through Sherlock's mouth, causing Sherlock to moan louder. Sherlock was just beginning on John's shirt when The Doctor interrupted.
“I know enough about the both of you, actually, pretty troubling things as well.”
John nodded and gave a sheepish smile. Watson looked about ready to faint again. John moved to catch him if he fell backward but Watson was able to keep himself steady. He held onto his hat and adjusted it even though it was fine the way that it was. John let him get his bearings together before attempting to talk to him further. He soon found the words to speak, much to John’s reassurance.
John's smile widened.
“You’re so beautiful, you know that? God I love you, you’re so perfect.”
‘Of course you can.’
"Sherlock!"
“Sorry for what?”
“Why?”
of December
He began to sing lowly, his voice cracking from the tears begging to fall. His mouth was next to Sherlock’s ear, he needn’t worry about singing over his wails.
I responded, ‘Yeah, I did, she’s not more than a few days old.’
The Doctor shook his head.
"Leave a note when?"
“But we aren’t, can’t say that it wouldn’t have been more entertaining to see you lot scurrying about like the tiny little mice that you are.”
“You’re not the first ones to turn me down. It’s okay; I’m tough I can handle it.”
True to my word, I dashed back to our flat to pick up Kylie, and then took a cab to hospital after work. I approached the front desk, gave them my name, and then headed up to your room. You took to laying on your side in the bed, complained about the bed hurting your back because of its hardness. Your eyes were always closed when we entered, you weren’t really asleep; you just lost yourself in thoughts. Your smile was small, but I was always glad to see it. I would sit in the chair placed next to your bed, with Kylie sat in my lap as we chatted. I told you about my day at work and how dreadful some of my patients were, and you laid there and you listened. You really listened, not like what you used to do back at the flat where it went in one ear and out the other, you were genuinely engaged in what I had to say. I know that sometimes you did actually listen to me complain but it wasn’t like how you did then. Kylie grew, she was close to…what was it…I believe she was four months nearing five. She was learning too, she started to make little noises here and there, and she smiled a lot more. You would stroke her hair that was close in color to yours, it had to be the father’s hair color because it sure as hell wasn’t Susanne’s. Kylie smiled and laughed at you when we came to visit, she grabbed your finger once and you kissed her forehead for it. You never did much talking, but when you did, you would always bring up a past case, or a vacation we took, or little details from our wedding night that only you would remember. You were becoming weaker by the day, love, your energy went faster than I have ever seen, and your mood fluctuated every hour of the day. You would smile on some days, then you would cry on others and then hate me for ‘imprisoning’ you at Barts. On those days, I didn’t bring Kylie with me because I didn’t want you to hurt her when you lashed out at me. You would have felt so guilty afterward. For a while, I kept the routine up, visiting you with Kylie and other times without Kylie, and then I would head home to begin the cycle anew.
"Alright, alright. It's been a slow day, nothing to fight, no Daleks invading London, no timey-wimey stuff to do, no planets that need saving, just me and my TARDIS, doing...stuff."
John saw the tear slide down Sherlock’s cheek. He couldn’t believe what he was seeing and yet he hated it. He hated for being the cause of the tears.
“John, I had to walk down the streets with such an awful smell because of her! I could hardly catch a cab because of her! It was awful!”
“I never touched anything upstairs. I always liked to think that you left the bed a mess because you were coming back. It’s pathetic, I know.” His sad smile shattered John’s heart.
John chuckles. He brings Sherlock's hand up to his face and peppers little kisses all over his bony wrist. No hospital bracelet, no clammy skin, his Sherlock, this is his Sherlock. He feels Sherlock trying to wriggle out of his grasp, but he holds on tighter.
Mycroft rested his hands on his legs and said, “Start small, John. You are in need of work, are you not?”
"Oh hush and get to cooking! I'll be out of your hair in a moment."
"Anyway, how would like to see your aunt today? She offered to take you to the park and everything."
John’s brows furrowed and he turned to face Sherlock. “Ask you what?”
‘John.’ You breathed out. I turned to you and gave a smile. You didn’t smile back.
“I have a Mrs. Hudson too. She’s not in now; she’s out in the country, with her sister.”
'That is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard come out your mouth, Sherlock.' I joked.
John placed a hand on his cheek and shook his head. “Shh, none of that now love. This is not your fault, okay? She’s just hungry.”
“Never too busy for you, love.”
John didn’t respond. How could he? What did he, a worn-down war vet, ever do to make a man like Sherlock Holmes, find him worth his time? As if Sherlock knew what he was thinking, he simply wrapped his arms around John’s small body and pressed a kiss to his forehead when he heard John’s tiny whimper into his shirt.
With a deep breath, Sherlock’s eyes bore into John’s soul as he said, “I love you, John Watson. I’m in complete and utter love with you.”
Sherlock sighed. John kissed his cheek.
"He told you, did he?"
"You didn't look like you were in a good way, and then I saw your clothes, so I know that you really aren't in a good way. What's wrong?"
Sherlock smiled.
John crossed his arms.
He sniffled.
John had to take a deep breath to finish off the letter.
John told himself he wasn’t going to push Sherlock. He meant every word when he told Sherlock to set the pace. He was glad that Sherlock understood.
John gave a sad laugh.
John’s face was washed with rage as he saw the sight in front of him.
“That’s silly. Watson permits me to keep my set, so long as I confine it to my area.”
"No, no I don't want to talk about it. We were talking about my day, right?"
That caught his attention, in no time; he was facing the husk that looked like Holmes.
John looked over at the Doctor, who gave a slight nod, telling him that it was okay to answer.
"Say something, Sherlock. Anything. Please."
"Who...Oh...hello sir, what has you up here so late?"
All I could say was, “Ah.” Anything more than that and I felt that he would have my head. He sat up and pulled the paper out of his gown pocket. It had been folded and unfolded many times, like he couldn’t believe that he was reading the name right.
But I thought that, you know, someone as meticulous as Sherlock Holmes would be the one to nitpick at everything I do, and he does, he certainly has let me know on countless occasions that I type like a sloth (his own words) but beyond that he doesn’t hound me if I leave a cup of tea for too long on the coffee table, actually, now that I think about it, he probably doesn’t even notice.  It’s nice, I guess, to not have someone constantly up your arse about small things. But sometimes, he’s just maddening. He’ll often be so in his own head that he’ll clean up our dinner (while I’m still eating, mind you) and will just toss it all the while explaining his case summary. I spoke to him, and told him that next time he should ask if I’m finished, rather than just assume that because he’s done, I’m done too. He blinked like he was snapped out of his daze and then looked at the bin and back at me. He apologized shortly and then made his way over to the couch as if it never happened. There was something about the way he reacted that made my chest ache a bit.
"It's not."
He could never stand to read it. She looked loving at first, sure, but that was only because he was so fixated on forgetting about the death of his best friend. The death of the man he loved dearly. He remembers the years he spent drinking his sorrows away trying to replay the last conversation he’s ever had with his best friend before he jumped. In his mind he would try to tell Sherlock all the things that he never could, but he didn’t. And he watched him die. But he got a second chance when Sherlock returned from the dead. He was trying to propose that night, but it was ruined with the return of a ghost.
I was visibly confused at that point, and I asked him to clarify what he meant by that. He put down my soiled jumper and looked at me with a calm face.
“Love, I have work in the morning.”
"I only know the same as you, Sherlock. Do try to not fret; it would make getting you out of this infernal chair easier."
John retrieved his coat and put it on shortly before getting pulled out of the flat and down the stairs into the street. John's hand was eventually released, but he watched as Sherlock's smile returned as he neared the mystery man in front of the blue box. Sherlock walked up to the Doctor and stopped. The Doctor smiled.
“It’s quite alright, really.”
The crowd found this exciting and humorous, their laughter carried on a few moments after Greg was done with his joke. When they quieted down, Lestrade took a swig of his ale that he asked for specially.
He noticed Sherlock’s tears, and moved in to kiss the salty lips. Their tongues exploring the other’s mouth, soft moans are made, they don’t part until their bodies crave oxygen. They panted and John moved in to kiss Sherlock’s lips again.
"I think you know what I want. Give it to me now, and John won't have to get hurt."
The boys' first time together.
Bear with me guys, I'm trying to update as much as I can! Thank you for reading and please comment, kudos, and subscribe!
Watson’s hand trailed up to Holmes’s pale one and gave it a squeeze.
“Let’s go out.” He said in between the kisses to the lips. Sherlock looked confused.
“What is it? Why are you giving the pouty face?”
I chuckled.
“I believe that I have the answer to all of your questions.”
"And Watson as well?"
John frowned. He never knew that she did that purposefully, he's always dismissed as her wanting to know more about the parent she never got to meet.
There she was, she was in Lara's arms.
“Do you and John…do you two desire each other in the way lovers do?”
“He can reproduce every item of furniture, literature, and clothing that I had and it will never make the flat as it was.”
“Maybe they others are back now!”
John was glad for the large coat, it provided him sufficient cover to hide the growing blush on his cheeks. God he missed this.
After a long bout of silence, he heard Sherlock say, “You called me great today.”
“We are here today – before God – because marriage is one of His most sacred wishes – to witness the joining in marriage of Sherlock Holmes and John Watson. This occasion marks the celebration of love and commitment with which---“
‘It would have been better if you were there.’
Watson gave a curt nod.
John took a deep inhale.
Sherlock swallowed hard and his eyes flickered back to Holmes to see what he would do.
“And just how far do you want us to be?” Holmes added.
You closed the door and turned to face Molly. She was removing her gloves and her scarf. She was looking at the both of us.
There is still some part of the cyberman who knows who Sherlock is and is fighting with all his will not to hurt him, oil spilling out of his eyes because there is only two ways this can end, Sherlock dying at his own hand, or by the hand of someone else
“I’m sure John has vows written down, just as I do. If it’s alright with you I would like to hear them now.”
I crossed my arms. You were getting ready for your third kip that day, and I had to feed Kylie, but I didn't leave before asking you another question.
“Waiting for your surgery to finish was pure agony, Sherlock. Maybe it wasn’t as long as I thought it to be; maybe it was because I was worried about you. You weren’t supposed to eat or drink anything that day but even before that, you weren’t too keen on having the standard three meals a day. My hands were clenched together and my leg couldn’t stop shaking. People passed by me and gave me short stares before they went about their day. I didn’t care what they thought about me. I was beginning to see why doctors don’t care for their loved ones, it clouds the head and they get sentimental. I wished I was in there helping them operate, or holding your hand even though you were passed out from the meds. The sounds of the machines, the chattering of the patients, nurses, doctors, and the bright lights that illuminated the whole building were driving me up the wall, Sherlock. I felt like you when you were bored, but I wasn’t as extreme as you.
