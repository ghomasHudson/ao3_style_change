The quinjet hovers and then, in four hundred feet, touches down on African soil. The sky is dark, pitch black. Tony thinks that perhaps the sun has just set here if it was rising in New York. He takes a deep breath to steady himself, and then he heads outside as Friday opens the door for him and Nebula.
“Tony Stark is dead,” the man says in a firm, assured voice. “So, no. I do not know who you are. All I know is you are trespassing in King T’Challa’s home, and we do not take kindly to trespassers here. Go,” he barks. “Go back to your jet and we will let you leave in peace. But if you take another step forward…” Suddenly Friday shows several outlines of men coming from around a corner to back the man addressing him now. “We won’t hesitate to kill.”
Tony frowns. He snaps his head down to catch sight of his reflection in the glass and, sure enough, his face is wet. Tony touches his cheek just to be sure. Why the hell….
Of course Bucky didn't trust Tony. What are the chances that this random kid shows up without bad intents. He hated the thought of his little brother being taken advantage of. He knew he would have to keep an eye on Tony. Maybe try to get a reaction out of him, or catch him in the act of doing something terrible. He would just have to wait for Tony to slip up, right?
“Also, there are lots of venders, and Tony’s never been. We could show him the real fireworks experience.” Natasha said with a small smirk. Tony smiled at the idea. There was nothing he wanted more right now, then to finally see the fireworks in person. Clint groaned, but it was of no use, they were off. Pepper handed back JARVIS, and smiled.
“They came?” He asked.
“Shut up.” Steve muttered. Tony turned to him a blinked. His goggles hanging around his neck.
“Cap gave the shield to the right person.” She replied before walking off to the elevator. She breathed a sigh of relief. That was close, Morgan knew if they found out they would tell Pepper and block her out until Pepper gave them the Okay to let her back in. She just wanted to know what the damn thing does. The door opened and she smiled at the bots who immediately crowded around her. She liked this, she understood why her dad liked this. Morgan checked the seats and saw the suit from before. It was red and white and she figured she’d get in the mood. She put on the suit with the helmet and finished the wiring. It wasn't hard she just had to put a few more wires back into place. She smiled at and turned the keys in ignition. She couldn't even describe the feeling of happiness when the van shuttered to life. It had worked. She had gotten it to work. She rushed to the back and let out a breath that she didn’t even realize she was holding when she saw the back was also working. It worked. She had done it. Actually done it. Her father would be so proud of her if he could see her now. How she ached to show him what she had done. Well she would settle for showing Pepper and the rest of the Avengers. Maybe even Carol would come and see it next time she was back on earth. (Morgan really liked Carol.) She looked down at the suit and noticed button on the gloves. She tilted her head to the side. What on earth were those for. It didn’t make sense the suit was just an old biker suit. Right? But what if it was more?! Morgan couldn’t resist. She really wanted to know what would happen if she pressed the button. So she did. She pressed both buttons on the hands at the same time.
“Why Phoenix?” Steve asked.
“Seriously, that kid means the world to all of us.” Rhodey said. “If anything happens to her and we mean anything, as soon as this thing works we are coming over there and kicking your asses. And we can because we’re you but stronger.” Morgan plucked the phone out of Tony’s hands.
“Those are DUM-E, Butterfingers and U” She replied. Morgan face lit up. These were them! The robots that her father built and everyone always talked about. She tilted her head to the side.
“Everyone hide!” Clint yelled and dove under the sofa. Natasha and Morgan looked at each other before sitting down behind the bar where they were invisible to the elevator. The doors dinged and opened.
______________
Back at the tower, no one said a word the entire trip home. Two hours of silence from the Avengers.
“So? How about? Stay with me until you can get back on your feet?” Steve asked. Tony glanced back down at the water.
“It is?” He asked. Morgan laughed.
“Sir, to answer your question, she seemed to just appear.” JARVIS replied.
“Give it them, and watch, they’ll leave you stranded here. And you
“You can do it Tony. Now get out there and kick high school's ass.” Pepper said. Tony smiled and rolled his eyes but got out of the car anyway. “You'll be fine!” she called us she drove off. Tony took a deep breath and stared at his schedule. Chemistry. He could do that. Room 214. There was his problem. He had no idea where 214 even was. Tony would not ask for help, he would not be the helpless new kid. Tony was a genius he could find a classroom. And he did. It only took him 10 minutes and he was on time. He spoke with the teacher and she told him to sit in the back with Bruce. Bruce was a short brunette with glasses and a forever confused look on his face.
“He help a whole lot. I wouldn’t have been able to do anything without him, thank you Tony.” She said and then, it was time to tackle the next issue.
“What in the world?” The man muttered. He looked for his bag and camera, but they were nowhere to be seen. He continued to struggle.
“Oh god.” He muttered and ran over to them. Rhodey was busy trying to stop the bleeding, his little medical training was actually helping even if it was only a little. “Stand back.” Steve said bending down. Rhodey did what he was told. Pepper buried her head into Rhodey’s shoulder and cried. “Hulk we need you to be ready. Ironman is down and not conscious.”
“Are you sure this is the right place?” Pepper asked looking at the dark dock around them.
“That reminds me. Have any of you seen duplicate yous before?” She asked. They frowned.
"No, no, no. There is no way that I am in Avengers tower in 2013. It's just a dream and cruel inhuman dream. I got knocked out from the van exploding and- and this is my punishment for disobeying mom. It- it has to." She rambled. Bruce put and hand on her shoulder and she jumped, hitting her back onto the wall. "ow… okay not a dream." She muttered.
Whoops
“You took Barton down?” He asked.
He knelt down next to the emergency fire escape door, and started to pick the lock. In nearly no time at all, it flung open. He closed it behind him and started up the stairs. If he had done this two years ago, he wouldn’t even have been able to make it up to the 5th floor; His scrawny body would’ve prevented him from making it up the stairs, but he had a growth spurt recently and he could do this.
Nebula scoffs. Tony cracks a nervous smile.
He doesn’t like this. He feels as weak mentally as he is physically. To make matters worse, he’s sobbing in front of company, and this time, his company’s not sobbing with him.
She doesn’t look convinced.
does?” He gestures to the jet.
I need you to stop bringing Peter up right now or I’m gonna crash this plane into the goddamn countryside,” Tony snaps as if he really is losing his mind. He’d rather threaten suicide than talk about Peter. He shouldn’t be like this, but he can’t help it. He can’t help anything or anyone. That’s why they’re in this situation in the first place. If he’d have been stronger, he could have ripped Thanos’ gauntlet off his nasty, purple hand. Or he could have cut Thanos’ hand off his arm. Or he could have grabbed Quill before he attacked Thanos and made him
Tony whirls on her, eyes narrowed, brows furrowed, blunt nails digging into the armrests on either side of him. “
mine, I--I made his suit.” He can’t do this. He needs to shut up before he shatters. God knows he’s already broken.
To Tony, nothing has ever felt as good as popping off his face plate and inhaling a lungful of New York City’s polluted air. When he was fighting Thanos, after Quill lost his cool and managed to fuck the entire universe over at once, Tony was sure he’d never smell this city’s rank air again. Then, after everyone disappeared and he was left on Titan with Nebula, he was even more certain that he would die on a planet where the dirt reminded him of cheap salmon and the air smelled like old machinery. He can’t believe he’s actually here right now.
Tony grips the worn steering wheel until his tanned knuckles whiten and Nebula bites her bottom lip until it dents.
“Wait,
As expected, no one rushes them when they approach the grand palace entrance. If Tony didn’t know better, he’d say the palace was deserted. He’s quiet, on edge, walking as quickly, but quietly as he can. Nebula, on the other hand, doesn’t give a shit for stealth. She walks full speed ahead and opens the palace doors like she owns the place.
That’s it.
The glare she gives him is about as cold and hard as the parts she’s made of. “And what am I, some helpless Asgardian? I withstood torture from Thanos and his goons for the majority of my life, and don’t forget I’m the one who helped get you back to Earth when I could have easily taken us anywhere but here.”
“Sir…? Sir…? Your temperature is one hundred degrees. I’m deactivating your nanobots.”
Vaguely, while Tony’s screaming into the infinity thread count Egyptian cotton, he hopes Shuri--or whoever’s in charge of watching and listening to them now--has the good grace to turn off the audio and look away.
The women shake hands and greet one another. All the while, Tony looks through the glass walls again, past the people. Where are the Avengers? Where’s Steve?
Shuri is saying something about living quarters and getting Tony and Nebula cleaned up, when Tony interrupts her.
“Freeze!” someone shouts from within. Tony raises both palms up, but his repulsors are on and ready to fire. Nebula, too, raises her fists in the air, both showing that she comes in peace but that she won’t have any qualms against throwing hands if she needs to. “Who are you?” the same voice demands, voice thick and heavily accented.
Peter braces himself against the blue glass counter and laughs. He’s wearing his school clothes and he’s laughing so hard that he’s crying.
Wow. Is someone actually…
Tony gives her his dirtiest scowl. “If you don’t want me to hurt you, shut your trap, Neytiri.” And with that, he rolls over onto his side, finds the handle to release his seat, and lays back. He doesn’t bother deactivating the suit. Instead, he thinks maybe if he forces his body into the right position with the suit on, his mind will consider him safe and will shut down. Tony can only hope.
“Stay back, ma’am,” the man from before snaps when the girl is a few feet away from Tony.
Tony winces and inhales sharply. She has a point. “Alright, if you wanna come with me, that’s fine, but if something happens to you--”
“Boss, a battle seems to have happened here. Is it safe to land?”
The expression on Shuri’s face melds into something akin to amused bewilderment. Her brows raise and the corners of her lips quirk like she’s about to laugh. “With all do respect, Mr. Stark, the last time I checked, you were trying to kill Sergeant Barnes, and Steve was protecting him from you. Also, there are warrants out for every last Avenger and super human who didn’t sign the Accords. How can I trust that you won’t kill someone if I take you to where everyone is resting? Or that you won’t arrest as many of them as you can on sight?” Shuri pauses, eyes Nebula warily. “For all I know, this woman here can be in on--”
“Well, no, I’m not an idiot. She’s been harmed by Thanos more times than we have, Princess,” Tony reassures. “This is Nebula. Nebula, this is Shuri, princess--”
Nebula, assuming her having mentioned Steve was what helped Tony, repeats her question. “Who is Steve?”
small. Something doesn’t feel right. If he lands, he has his armor, he’ll be fine. But Nebula…
to Tony’s side of the story and not judging him right off the bat?
Nebula proves to be his saving grace. “Hey,” she says, addressing Shuri. “You’re a queen now, right? That means being diplomatic is your number one job.” Tony is hesitant to translate this, afraid it might get them thrown out, but he pries open his lips and tells Shuri what the blue woman said anyways.
They fly to the field in front of the palace and there’s blood, deformed bodies, and signs of outright chaos everywhere.
“This doesn’t look good,” Nebula warns.
“Oh my god,” he gasps, sitting up so fast he falls forward and out of his seat.
“Mr. Stark, sir, I hate to tell you this, but you’re overheating.”
Nebula appears in front of him then and stops his path to another forgotten car. “Why did you say that?”
Shuri doesn’t look offended or taken aback at all. If anything, she appears a little sheepish. “Captain Rogers notified me that he’d like the location of all the Avengers to remain classified.”
But she doesn’t know that Tony’s at his wit’s end. He’s too vulnerable to be picked on now.
As soon as Nebula enters the jet, Friday closes the door and starts the engine. “Where to, boss?”
“Steve told you that?”
Shuri’s brow furrows and she reaches out to take one of Tony’s hands in both of hers. Tony notes that her hands are small and dainty and wonders how she can be the adored engineer he’s heard so much about. “Where have you been all this time?” she asks. “How do you not know what’s happened?”
Nebula’s eyes dart around, but the basement is too dark to see much of anything. Well, at least for Tony. For all he knows, the alien girl’s got night vision. Even as Tony makes his way off the elevator and through the dark hall, Nebula stays put.
“Uh, I hope so,” Tony quips. He slides into the car and turns the ignition, feeling at home in a machine that’s he’s familiar with; driving Maw’s ship had been a nightmare.
He tries the car’s handle a few times and then peers inside the forgotten vehicle. The windows are dustier than a Nevada desert, though; he can’t see anything within. He gives up and is maneuvering to yet another car when he hears the distinctive, dull screech of metallic tearing and turns to see Nebula ripping the driver-side door from the Honda.
Ten minutes later, they compose themselves and Tony begins driving again like they never broke down, like they have been fine all along.
Nebula glares at him for a tense second before she lowers her arm, takes a deep breath, and tries again. She speaks through clenched teeth and the inappropriate image of an angry robotic dog crosses Tony’s mind. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to upset you. You just...You’ve been so quiet. You’re not as quippy as you were when we first met. And I saw the way you looked...cried...when the kid who was with you disappeared.” Are aliens capable of interpreting human emotion? Tony genuinely asks himself. Do they know what sensitive topics are? “I just think you should talk about it. Better to talk than to mope around. So I’ll ask you again. The child in the suit with the web designs...Was he your son?”
Tony shouts when the elevator doors open to reveal his state-of-the-art basement. “Friday, daddy’s home! The hell are you so quiet for?”
a nice house,” Tony agrees. “Too bad we’re not staying here. C’mon, the jet’s underground.”
half an hour of shut-eye,” Tony utters, mostly to himself. Unsurprisingly, Nebula hears him. She’s half-machine, he thinks. Of course she heard you.
“So this is the place Quill was so fond of,” Nebula says somewhere behind Tony. She’s following him around as he looks for a car with the keys still in the ignition. Technically, they’re both on the prowl for a working vehicle, but since Nebula doesn’t quite know what keys to a car look like, or where they would even be located inside a car, she’s not that helpful. Still, Tony enjoys her company as well as her commentary. Without her, he would be forced to think of Pepper and how she didn’t return the thirty-seven calls he made to her the moment Ebony Maw’s rewired ship broke the atmosphere. Without Nebula, Tony would have to think about the absence of Quill, Mantis, Drax, Stephen Strange, and P--...the kid.
“They’re not here?”
“This ship is exceptional,” Nebula pipes up, startling him.
“Bast, it can’t be,” a feminine voice squeaks. Lights flicker on and a short, thin girl with skin the color of something luxurious steps into view. Tony squints and sees they’re surrounded by walls made of glass, and behind the glass, what must be Wakandan civilians are watching them. “Tony Stark,” the girl continues. “I--your friends told me…”
Tony’s worrying his lip and has his eyes glued on the road while he answers her. “
Nebula shifts and her expression changes for a second, flickers to something akin to concerned, but then she shakes whatever thought she was having from her head and follows Tony to the nearest elevator. The home has stairs, as all do, but Tony’s too damn tired to bother with them.
Tony endeavors a shaky inhale, remembers Peter’s shaky smile, and then loses his shit all over again.
“No, I found out. Listen, I know it sounds crazy, but really. Bucky was trained and controlled to be an assassin. My parents were just two people he was hired to kill. For Bucky, it was a mission he had no control over. For all he knew, my parents committed some atrocious crime together and he was serving them justice on a silver platter. Steve knew this, that Bucky wouldn’t intentionally hurt them if he was himself, and so...I guess Steve felt like since my parents were already killed and since there was nothing we could do about it, he shouldn’t be mad at Bucky. He was mad at the people who made Bucky into such a demon, sure. But he wasn’t mad at Bucky. And if Bucky was still under mind-control and came for me…” Tony lets that thought go. He wants to continue defending Steve, say that Steve wouldn’t be okay with Bucky trying to kill Tony or anyone else. He wants to say that Steve would save Tony just as Steve would have saved Tony’s parents if he had known Bucky was coming for them. But he doesn’t know if that’s true, so he doesn’t want to say it.
“Queen Shuri, if I may...Where is Steve Rogers?”
to me, like a son to me, but he wasn’t mine. I mean.” He sighs. “He was mine, he
Just as quickly, Tony reminds her that he created her to assist him, not question his commands, and in seconds, the suit retracts back into his arc reactor while Tony stands susceptible to the small army of Wakandans.
Tony clears his throat, eyes the stricken Wakandas watching them behind the glass. “Yes, Shuri is the queen of Wakanda.”
As he takes in the mess of the battlefield and the darkness of the palace, he reminds himself that there’s no way Steve is dead. He doesn’t know where Thor is, and he presumes Bruce disintegrated somewhere on Earth. But Steve Rogers and crew have to be alive, or he doesn’t know how he’s going to live with himself, alone.
Since Thanos had gotten his way, Tony hasn’t been able to sleep for more than three hours at a time. Now that Friday is autopiloting his jet, he assumes he’ll sleep for the seven hour plane ride to Wakanda. He’s already told Friday to let him know when they’re a good fifteen minutes away so that he can wake up, prepare himself for his reunion with the rest of the Avengers, and so he can activate his suit incase the Wakandans don’t recognize the jet and decide to shoot him and Nebula out of the sky. When Tony closes his eyes, however, he’s met with a startling image of Peter fading away, and now he has to sit up and be angry and awake for seven whole ass hours.
“So they
“Where is she?” she snaps. She’s stopped right outside the elevator door, unwilling to move an inch until the mysterious person comes out of hiding.
“Nice house,” Nebula whispers. Tony notes that her hands are clenched into fists even if she’s forced the muscles in her face to relax, to make her look calm and unaffected. He wonders if she was hoping Pepper would call out to him, too, to restore her faith in miracles, too. Or maybe he’s just projecting his emotions onto her and whatever hopes she held onto are long gone.
Tony thinks to himself. He drops his head back against the headrest and wishes he could melt into the material. “Um, we were close--obnoxiously close--until he tried to kill me in Siberia because I wanted to talk with his friend who I’d just found out had killed my parents.”
The darkness of the palace is lifting with the harsh African sunrise, painting the walls with an incandescent blue-gray and making Tony feel like he’s in a trance. He wonders if the guards are purposefully taking the slow way to the room he’ll be meeting Steve in. He also wonders if maybe they’ve gone in two or three circles. So much of the palace looks the same. White walls with gold and silver accents, glass walls every now and then, large doors with elaborate designs on them.
“Sir, take deep breaths. We are thirty minutes away from the destination,” Friday informs.
Tony wishes someone would turn a light on. If it wasn’t for Friday showing him a digital outline of a body not fifty feet away, he wouldn’t be able to see anything. “C’mon, man,” he says. “You don’t have to know who she is, she’s new here, but you really don’t know who I am? Tony Stark? Earth’s greatest avenger?”
Peter pauses then, sniffles. He wipes only one of his cheeks and his smile wavers. “I’m a crying mess? What about you, Mr. Stark?”
But still. Just like on the ride from Titan back to Earth, the car ride is silent save for the low purr of the Honda’s engine. Tony finds himself caught between highway hypnosis/almost falling asleep at the wheel and worrying himself into a cold sweat.
That afternoon, the two men fuck hard and fast. They’re both desperate, both hopeless, both in need of a solid distraction to keep them from doing some stupid and/or suicidal. They’re in the same room as before, and nothing’s changed except the guards are gone and Tony’s showered.
Tony frowns in the suit even though she can’t see his face. “We don’t know if it’s safe for you to come down yet.”
No matter how sad Peter looks, he never stops smiling. Tony wants to hug him, to tell the boy he loves him. As soon as he begins to speak, however, Peter cuts him off.
The princess scowls at him. “Stand down. This man is our friend.”
“Oh, so now Friday wants me to be able to see,” Tony gripes.
“The motherland, my dear.”
“What?” Nebula shouts, fast to her feet. “You’re not leaving me!”
“Of course, boss.”
The ride down to the basement is so silent Tony thinks he can hear the thoughts of his thoughts.
As pissed as I am at Steve for punching me in the face, breaking my multimillion dollar suit, and then taking off with his winter boyfriend and abandoning me in Siberia, I am able to put that behind me in favor of working with him so that I can be reunited with the people in the world who mean the most to me.”
“Pete, is everything okay?”
“Well, you said Quill was fond of this place. I nopped because I don’t think Quill has ever visited New York,” he tells her as he steps around her and heads towards an old, golden Honda that looks promising.
Tony’s shocked to see that most of the Wakandan barrier is visible to the naked eye and destroyed when they arrive. What’s even more shocking is how Friday’s able to fly the jet straight through the border with no consequences. No shots are fired, no threats come in through the radio. The entire country is eerily empty, quiet.
Tony activates his suit and aims his thruster at her, prepared to fire. Nebula narrows her eyes. “Shoot at me and you’ll lose a third P.”
“This isn’t Missouri,” Tony mumbles. “Aha! Keys!” He turns back to look at Nebula. She doesn’t look nearly as amused or spirited as Tony is trying to be, so he wilts. He lets his face drop and shows his true emotion, an unhealthy blend of discomfort and exhaustion. He breaks eye contact and gestures Nebula forward. “Get in. We’ve gotta go upstate.”
“We were on another planet,” Nebula says.
“I know you’re home, boss,” Friday chimes from the speakers in the walls. Nebula jumps and then crouches. “However, your heart rate is accelerated and you are sweating profusely. Also, you’ve brought a guest home that isn’t human, and our communication has been disconnected for several days. I thought maybe you would have liked for me to keep quiet.”
“I’m not afraid,” Nebula growls at the same time that Friday says, “I am real.”
“No, no he definitely isn’t,” Tony corrects Why he’s defending Steve, he has no idea. Maybe he prefers to be the one shit-talking Steve and not someone who’s never met him before. Tony clears his throat. “Steve, he...he wasn’t necessarily okay with Bucky killing my parents. I think...Look, a lot of things happened. Bucky was under mind-control--”
Nebula tilts her head to the side. “He tried to kill you because you wanted to talk?”
“She’s not real,” Tony yells from farther away in the garage. He’s feeling around, using his proprioception sense to help him navigate his way to the quinjet. Was his workspace always this messy? “The voice you hear, Friday, she’s artificial intelligence I created some time ago. Just a computer. Nothing to be afraid of.”
“Don’t be sad, Mr. Stark,” Peter says. His smile is watery and he looks mournful. “I’m okay. I’m always gonna be okay.”
Tony brings his knees into his chest and fists his hair and stills. He’s so damn tired, so fucking sad. What is the biological purpose of having dreams like that? Why would his brain make him dream of someone he was probably never going to see again? Wouldn’t it have been wiser for Tony to dream of football or building a new suit?
Tony isn’t surprised by the silence that greets them in the new tower. He calls out for Pepper, just once, just to see if she’ll call back. He hates himself even more when she doesn’t. He knew she wouldn’t, knew she was long gone, but he had to try. Some insane part of him thought that if he just wished hard enough, she’d reappear and he’d be able to take her into his arms and tell her how much this hurt and how sorry he was. Although, if wishing for Peter’s reappearance on Titan didn’t work, where Tony was more belligerent, more desperate, wishing for Pepper on Earth where he’s detached won’t work either.
“Yeah well- oh!” She said. Morgan had found what she needed.
“Well I’d hope so since you do in the future.” She said. Also the fact that he was her father and if he didn’t like her that would be an issue.
“Well..”
“I don’t have any money.” Tony said. Steve smiled.
"What?!" She yelled startling DUM-E. "Sorry, DUM-E. I just can't believe it's 6 am already." She was covered in dust and dirt (and something else but she didn't really want to talk about it.) and people would know if she should up dirty and tired. So she just went up to her room and took a shower. It was 7 before she went downstairs to the common room where most of the Avengers hung out in their free time.
“No problem.” Natasha said, surprising everyone. Morgan smiled very so slightly.
“What? Boo! No fair!” She exclaimed. “You’re such a troll!”
"The newest Stark phone can do way too much." She muttered. She stayed on her phone and texted her mom. ‘I’m in the past, they don’t know who I am. If you call again, I’ll refer to you as Pepper.’
“Are you okay?” Steve asked, noting his breathing.
“Stay here with Bucky.” She said. Morgan nodded and Natasha gave Bucky a look that said ‘
“Earlier tonight she came upstairs with paint all over her.” Bucky explained.
“Okay, so like, what’s wrong with him?” Bucky asked as soon as Steve was off the phone. Steve sighed, knowing that discussing Tony would be inevitable. He was just glad they all waited until Tony was out of the room.
“Of course.”
“I know, Steve. I love the kid too. But we have to stay in a calm head-space. For her. She’ll be back. Scott and Hank and Jan and Hope… that’s a lot of names, will fix it and we’ll get her back in no time at all.” Bucky said. He glanced at Bucky and nodded.
"I think she did." Bucky replied. Sam noticed the cereal and sighed.
“2033” She answered. She was actually in 2013. This was amazing and scary all at once.
The only thing Tony could think of was how guilty he felt about leaving Jarvis’s body there. He’s mind wasn’t straight he couldn’t think of what to do. If this is what happened now, there was no telling what Obadiah had done in the past few years and what he will do in the future if Tony let him stay there. But he couldn’t have Rhodey and Pepper die too, he couldn’t handle losing everyone he loved. He wouldn’t lose everyone he loved. He would not let Obadiah do that. Even if it meant Obadiah’s death. Better him than them. All he saw was red.
“Ow… Hey.” Past Clint whined. Morgan shook her head.
“JARVIS?!” She asked, nearing hysterics.
“Doctor Banner.” Steve said as they approached. Cassie went upstairs and stayed in one of the guest rooms when they got there. Scott didn’t want another daughter lost in time. Hank and the rest were already looking over the van and trying to figure out what needed to be done.
“Hank Pym?” Bruce asked. “He hasn’t been seen in years, let alone his company.” She nodded.
“Okay.” She said. Her voice quivering.
“He is just not with you.” Morgan said. “Alright enough about that if we go on like this than there will be no future left for me to get back to.” There was a silence.
“Do we have a deal?”Tony asked.
, but her face didn’t change as she lifted her head.
“Won't your parents be mad?” Tony asked. Steve's face darkened a bit.
“I’m going to tell you a secret. Something I haven’t told anyone yet.” He nodded, cautious. She held up her left hand a swiped her right hand from the wrist on the back, through her fingers and to the bottom of her palm, revealing her metal hand. “You’re my hero.” She said. He looked at her hand wide eyed.
“Rhodey, what If he- I couldn’t handle if… Rhodey I don't now what to do.” Pepper cried. Rhodey thought for a second.
“What are those robots over there?” She asked.
“I don’t think she’s a threat.” Steve said. Young Steve, not old man Steve. She hadn’t seen him seen she was five!
“Cut it out Morgan, where are you?” She asked.
"Don't tell her over the phone. The last thing we need is for her to get hurt trying to get here." Steve said. Happy nodded.
“This is Tony.” Steve said.
*What?! Nothing.” Tony squeaked.
“Well yes.” He said. “What does that have anything to do with this?” He asked.
“She’s gone.”
“Strawberries?” Natasha asked. Morgan nodded.
**Bonus Chapter**
“Is this-?” Steve cut himself off and Tony nodded, knowing what the rest of the question was. “But how?” Steve asked. Tony shook his head and looked up at the sky.
they alive and happy. I wish it was the same back home, but it's not. Ten years is a long time.” She replied. They looked up at her she was smiling now. “Celebrate the life they had.” She said. Before walking away, towards the road. They followed in shock. Natasha stayed for a minute.
“Something happened and I gotta go home but it's like two miles.” Tony said obviously distracted. Everyone was concerned more than ever now.
“Well, he’s dead now and I do not want anyone else to be killed by him.” Tony said. He face showed how serious he was. Widow tapped The Captain’s shoulder.
“With that, we’ll be able to get him out, then we’ll get into his house and take the particles from his secret lab, he’ll know it’s gone but it’s a small price to pay. After that, I’ll be home free. I’ll get out of your hair and none of you will remember me.” They looked down. Sort of sheepish. “What?” She asked.
“Why?”
“Of course, Sir.” She said grabbing Tony’s arm. “Right this way.” The girl pulled him into a room and off to a side room which was a bathroom and she started to run him a bath. “I’m Natasha if you need anything just call. When you are done in there, there will be clothes waiting for you. There are towels on the hook. I will come for you when dinner is ready.” She said, turning to leave.
“Nothing it’s just Pepper’s acting… different.” He said before realizing that it sounded bad. “Not bad actually good, but I was wondering why.”
“What’s wrong?” He asked Steve.
“What the hell?” Obadiah questioned.
"Where were you?" Sam asked her. She jumped.
. He felt Tony kiss back which just made him more confidant. They both pulled away, panting.
“Calm down Stark.” It was Natasha. “It’s an easy job. We just need to stop the man from leaving. It’ll be easy. You’re just here to get a feel for what a job is and how to do one.” She said. He nodded.
“Tony get over here!” Steve yelled from the lab entrance. Bruce was standing next to him.
The van shook violently and ultimately fell apart. So she didn’t fix it fully and took a few shortcuts. Sue her.
Tony walked over to the bathroom and swallowed two pills, it was more than he normally had but JARVIS assured him that he would be okay, and in fact he,
“She’s in the past.” Pepper muttered. Steve went pale as well.
“Ooh!” She exclaimed. “Gimme!” She made grabbing hands at the laptop. Bruce smiled softly at her and handed her his computer. She started to type again.
“Could you do us a huge favor?” Bucky asked.
Time past, and Steve and Tony lived happily, ever, after….
“Whoa!” Said a voice and he felt a hand on his wrist. All of the sudden he was being pulled over the edge and onto the ship. “I got you.” He said. Tony immediately blushed. “How did you fall over?” It was the man from before. The hot one.
“We should probably get going.” He said.
“So we've noticed.” Steve said. Tony pushed away from Rhodey and hit Steve arm. The football boy started talking and Tony got a feeling that someone was watching him. He turned around and saw something that made his breath stick in his throat. Tony turned it back to the group, he could feel his heart rate becoming a regular. His breaths came quicker and he started to panic. He batted it at Rhodey's arm.
“I know nothing about football.” Tony said.
“Heart attack?!” The entire friend group yelled at once. It was kind of creepy how in-sync they were. Pepper and Rhodey gave Tony and identical look. Tony scrunch up his face a bit and shrugged.
“Captain Rogers is on his way up, sir.” JARVIS said.
“Surprise me this year.” Morgan declared. Steve thought for a moment, before sighing. He wanted to tell her and he might not get another chance to.
Tony and Steve stood in the lobby area of S.I., waiting for Howard and Maria. These were his parents, and he had never thought he would see them again. Steve placed a hand on his shoulder and smiled.
“That’s so unhealthy.” Sam said. Morgan snorted.
“No, it's fine. It won't be any trouble. He'll just be a bit annoying, it fine.” Steve said.
_____________
“How do you live?” Bucky asked. Tony was uncomfortable now. He didn't mean to say the wrong thing. He didn’t even know what he did wrong.
“I do not believe you said anything wrong. You simply shared your sleeping habits with them. Also, don't you prefer to be alone?” JARVIS asked. Tony smiled. He liked how JARVIS would sometimes ask questions.
“I’m here to prove that Obadiah Stane is hiding something. Something bad.” Steven replied, he head slightly lowered. Tony took a breath. This was it, all he had to do was ask. Right? He had Steven and based off the panic in his voice, he would be willing to do anything Tony asked.
“Not important. I’m sorry I took it in the first place. I probably should have just asked you.” Tony said. Steve put the bag down and smiled at Tony. He looked like he was about to say something, when a loud boom rang out. A flash of colorful light lit up the park. People cheered. Tony was proud to say that he didn’t even jump when the first one went off.
“What the hell?” Steve muttered. The lights flicked on.
Happy drove Morgan to compound, when Tony died he protected the kid with fire, he was always there for her, ever since she asked for that cheeseburger. He had said that her father had liked cheeseburgers and although she knew he was gone, she still didn’t like the fact that he had used past tense. But Happy, he had other work to do besides looking out for her but he was by her side whenever he could be. They parted ways with a little more than a goodbye. They had been chatting in the car. But her eyes lit up when she saw who was in the compound.
“We’ve got into SHIELD.” Tony said. Morgan lit up.
“Yeah, not when my dad is always on my tail and won’t let me use it that much.” Tony huffed. “Besides the ability to summon fish is awesome.” Bruce scoffed.
“The killer, was Obie. He wanted you dead.” She said carefully. The phone slipped out of Tony’s hand and hit the floor. His facial expression didn’t change. His mouth was left agape. Life seemed to go in slow motion. The man that saved him so many times from his father, the man that helped his childhood be bearable. This man made him feel worth when no one else did. He tried to kill Tony. And for what? Tony didn’t know. He probably should’ve stayed on the line. But his world was spinning and he couldn’t understand anything. His friends were saying something, or at least trying to. But he could understand them. He was so afraid. Everything he knew was a lie. Everything was wrong. Tony’s chest erupted in pain. He clutched his chest and he knew what was happening. Another heart attack, was all he could think about as the world faded to black around him. He was passing out from the pain.
“We’ll be right here.” He said. Tony nodded and went straight back to where they had been sitting. It was right there, on the ground. Well, it had been stepped on and moved slightly, but it was there. Tony clutched it to his chest, and placed it in his shoe, so he wouldn’t lose it again. He turned and walked to the place he remembered where everyone had been standing, but he couldn’t find them. They were nowhere in sight.
and you avoid it as much as you can. In moments of weakness, when the haze fades and desolation sweeps across the eviscerated corners of your mind, you can't.
Your scuffle landed you on your stomach, one arm pinned below your body and one in The Other's crushing grip. His clawed fingers tightened until there was a sickening crunch and your vision grew a black vignette around the edges.
something has taken a bite out of the meat at his shoulder; tendons, flesh, and the white glint of what looks like bone lies there exposed.
“You have no idea. It feels like months since I've been on land.” He said.
“What if she’s trying to go back?” Bruce asked quietly. “Like it’s a huge explosion where the portal is and she doesn’t want us getting hurt.”
“Alright, bye.”
“Okay?” She said, mildly confused. She handed the phone to Tony who shrugged and held it up for the Avengers to see.
“So we need to contact her, right? Tell her to find the Particles and then she can come home.” Clint asked.
“Guys, this is Tony. Tony this is Sam, Bucky, Clint and Bruce. You already met Natasha.” Steve pointed to the two guys on the couch first, then the guy on the floor and finally the guy on the chair. There was no way Tony would be able to remember all those names, let alone remember which name was whose. Hell, he forgot his own name just a little while ago. But he nodded anyway and waved. Sam (he thinks) nodded at him and Bucky (he thinks but, again still wasn’t sure) nodded and gave him a small wave. Tony’s face lit up when he saw it. Bucky’s arm - It was metal. Obviously a prosthetic, but still cool nonetheless. He rushed over with speed Steve didn’t know he could achieve considering how slowly he walked. He looked at Bucky’s arm his eyes full of amazement, and poked at it once or twice. When Bucky didn’t feel it, he frowned.
I AM SO SORRY FOR THE LATE CHAPTER. I HAD A BUSY WEEK AND I NEVER GOT TO FINISH IT! I AM SO SORRY! THANK YOU FOR STAYING.
build it. I don’t believe it’s fair to make you pay for something like a prosthetic, all limbs are needed from what I’ve seen in today’s world, so a working one and one with nerve sensors shouldn’t be such a difficult task, or expensive in any way.” Tony said. All eyes were on him again, with shocked expressions. He slowly walked over to Steve.
“Im sorry Buck, it’s just… it’s Morgan!” Steve exclaimed. “I was right there. I could’ve stopped her.” He said.
“JARVIS, am I okay?” Tony asked, his voice was still slightly shaky. Pepper looked confused and Steve gave her a look telling her that he’d explain later. She nodded and sat down on the couch, and spread out some some papers on the table.
from about twenty years in the future.”
Rhodey and Pepper arrived at the house in around 15 minutes. Pepper banged on the door. Hard. He didn't answer.
“Hey, Hey. Tony look at me, calm down. It- It’s fine. It’s just Pepper. She’s a friend.” Steve said. Tony nodded, and slowly put his wrench away. He hesitated - he still looked like he was about to cry, but he seemed to be better.
The reactor was the second thing I noticed about you when we met.
We were okay for so long, and I was home.
I'm sorry.
Because I believe I have two soulmates.
So I'm sorry. Again.
Well, of course not. I was an asshole pushing you away instead of telling you how I really feel.
But unfortunately, this time I don't have a choice.
She's amazing. She's everything I'm not. She never hurt you.
It did a few weeks ago, except it wasn't you on the other side.
But it's not like you'll ever know.
I believe my literal thoughts were:
I'm almost positive you were what made me sure I like both women and men. I mean, I had suspicions before. Before I mean back in the 40's.
"Damn, he's a jerk. But a hot one."
Guess what, that's where I am right now.
Even though you won't ever see this. Right.
Also, did you know the wider you smiled, the more it glowed?
I noticed it one day at the compound, when you were telling some stupid jokes, and I tried so hard not to laugh because we were literally having a meeting with Mr. Secretary. And me trying to keep a straight face made you smile, and that's when I noticed your heart glowing brighter.
“She’s… a kid?” Steve tried.
“JARVIS.” Tony said. “My A.I system.”

“Then you’ll do a DNA test and prove it to them. They’re gonna love you, Tony.” Steve said. Tony gave him a smile and nodded, but he chewed on his nails while they waited.
“The messy look, makes you look cute.” Steve said. Tony could’ve sworn his face was redder than a crab. “Dinner is ready, I've come to take you down.” Steve sighed. “I have to explain to my brother why you are here and he is less likely to get mad if you’re there.”
“English essay?” He asked.
“Don't know, don't care. I'm not going back, not for awhile or anything. That's sort of why I was on the water in the first place.” Tony scoffed. Steve cocked his head.
“Yeah. Hey I like Iron man.” She said. The group collectively snorted at her.
“This kid may be incredibly smart, but he couldn't tell you a thing about sports for the life of him.” Rhodey said.
“Yeah. I’m really allergic to strawberries.” She replied.
“You already hit me.” Barton spat.
“Tony, when was the last time you slept?” Steve asked shifting his position to face Tony. Tony tilted his head then shrugged.
“Did you just call me short?” Tony asked.
The game itself was huge. Tony had never seen a group of people this large before. It was a tiny bit overwhelming. But having Steve by his side made him feel a lot better. He also helped Tony understand what was going on in the game. Tony even understood when Rhodey's team scored. Tony was having the best time he ever thought he could have at a sporting event. They met up with Rhodey after the game at his car.
“I love you guys too.” She said and hung up.
"That's strange that you could still get phone calls from the future." Bruce said. Morgan shrugged.
hurt. After getting through the fact that she left, he understood that it was healthy for both of them to break up. She wouldn’t be worried about him dying in battle anymore and he wouldn’t have to worry about her possibly being targeted because of him. He wasn’t even
“I lived in a tower my whole life and
“Sir has been awake for about three days, or 84 hours to be exact.” JARVIS said. Tony hung his head and tapped his ear piece. He forgot JARVIS could turn on speak mode whenever he wanted.
for you guys, I just figured that if you went through enough trouble to-to buy a coffee machine, that you guys like coffee. I just kinda assumed, if you guys don’t like it, I-I’ll drink it. I mean It’s-It’s kind of a lot, but I would want to waste it. That wouldn’t be right. I would’ve made one for… Pepper too, but I had no idea she was coming… or that she existed” Tony was babbling. He knew he was babbling, and he
“Alright, now go unpack.”
“Morgan is… well… she called me last night and she sort of told me that she going to try and… change the past.” Bruce said. “She asked me not to tell anyone.”
“If I let you go, you will take me to see those fireworks. And then, you will take you to back here and I will give you your things back. I won’t press charges.” Tony said. Steven seemed to think for a minute. Tony realized he was most likely trying to come up with an escape plan. “And if you even think about running, I will send the video of you breaking in here to the police, and every officer in New York will be searching for you.” Steven’s eyes widened, this could ruin everything. He only nodded in response.
“No, I mean I’ve seen it in T.V shows and movies, but I never had it before.” He replied. Clint moved behind Natasha and sat in front of Tony crossing his legs, and spent the next half hour teaching him how to properly eat pizza.
“To be honest, neither do I. I just fix what was broken before turning it on. I took a few shortcuts so I guess that’s why you guys can’t bring me back now.” She said.
“Is Mister Stane actually training his illegitimate daughter to take up the company?” The reporters, like always, were relentless. The receptionist picked up the phone and dailied one number.
“A tracker or something I guess.” She said.
“Then what should we do?” He asked. “Wait and hope he comes to us?”
“You are now part of our team.” The Captain said. Tony could’ve cried. That was it. Obadiah was going to die. Pepper and Rhodey would be safe. “That’s Bruce Banner, code name Hulk.” He said pointing to the brunette. “You’ll be working with him closely. The one you knocked out was Clint Barton, or hawkeye. The metal arm is Bucky Barnes or Winter soldier. The tall blonde is Thor Odinson. The brit is Peggy Carter. This is Natasha Romanoff or Black Widow. I’m Steve Rogers or The Captain.
What they didn't plan for was that the man would have an entire gang of back up. As soon as Steve approached him all Hell broke loose. At least 20 different 'civilians’ pulled out guns and started to shoot. Tony knew his job and acted immediately. He shoved people towards safety.
“I-I - They-They wouldn’t!” Tony protested. Obie shrugged and walked off into the crowd, he’d soon have Tony back. He wouldn’t let anything else happen. He’d get Tony back whether he liked it or not.
“Could you do me a huge favor? Could you buy 7 tickets to your next game?” Tony asked.
“She found the van.” Steve said. Everyone stood still and at attention. “She managed to fix it up enough for it to work and took the spare suit. She had no idea what it did and she got herself into the past. We have no clue what she did and the van is messed up and we can’t get her back.” Steve said. Hank nodded. “We need your help. We can’t lose Morgan too. Especially not Pepper, we’re not sure she could handle it.” Hank shook his head.
“Yes.” JARVIS replied. The group seemed dumb founded. The fireworks were on his birthday.
“Tony.” He said. He swear he saw Natasha smile. He almost never let anyone call him Tony anymore, not since the crash. It reminded him of his parents.
to protect him. If he died now, it would be her fault. That was not okay. She ran towards him slipping away from Bucky’s hands and positioned herself between the gun and Tony.
have the wrong number.” He muttered.
“Oh my god I am so inconsiderate. I should just just back into the water shouldn't I? Yeah I'll just go do that.” Tony said turning around to jump back in. Totally and 100% embarrassed. Steve grabbed his arm.
“God, Rhodey what if it isn't him?” Pepper asked.
“The fireworks? You mean the ones the Starks set off? Yes, I am.” Steven said, clearly not following.
“I don’t think you can. You’re father was looking for you today. If your gone another day, he’ll send out a search party. That won’t do anyone any good.” Bruce said.
“You know him?” He asked quietly. They both nodded. “Widow.” Steve said and gestured with his head to the two. With that he walked off carefully with Tony in his arms. Natasha walked up to them.
“What paint?” Steve questioned. Happy nodded.
“Sir, your heart rate is getting too high.” JARVIS informed him, but Tony couldn’t do anything about that. He tried his best to breath deeper, but it only came out ragged and harsh.
“Sure that'll work.” Steve replied with a smile that would have made Tony collapse, but he was sitting. Thank God for that. Tony manage to smile back, he done, to avoid further embarrassment, started to eat his lunch.
“It’s alright to cry.” She said in a gentle voice. He shook his head again.
“Sam Wilson?” She asked.
“I think that’s how Obie said my parents died.” Tony said as if it were a normal thing. “Car crash.” Steve softened.
“Yeah, we’re surprising him.” Bruce said from the conjoined kitchen. She brightened.
“Do it. She is just a kid and is going through more than you realize right now.” Pepper added. Morgan rolled her eyes.
“That's me.” She whispered. Steve turned to them.
“He flinched when I touched him.” She said. They all knew what that meant.
“Where is Steve?” She asked.
“Hey Happy!” Clint said as he took a mouthful of popcorn and the group went back to watching their movie.
“My gallery and house. My friends and I live upstairs.” Steve said walking towards the door, but stopped when Tony did not follow.
“Who is that?” One of the men on the couch asked. Steve took a breath.
Love you all! <3
“Why? The fireworks aren’t until it gets dark.” Clint said.
“Steve, what’s up I’m glad you could get Hank and his family here to help.” Bruce said. He seemed sort of nervous. Not completely but somewhat.
“No, real men don’t cry.” He muttered. She shook her head this time.
“That would be a good idea but too bad i’m right here.” Someone said. Tony whirled around and saw his brother floating there. Tony hug him.
“Shoot something then.” The guy with the metal arm said.
“Well, I lied to you guys this whole time. I was planning on telling  you guys that night but obviously that didn’t work out.” He said. She snorted.
“well, there was this lamp that automatically went on. I just got it the other night and it set fire to itself, then the whole house. My parents are going to file a lawsuit on the company who manufactured it when they get home from their business trip. I freaked out by the way my friend reacted and told me.” Tony said. “Sorry if I overreacted.”
“They have good taste.” Rhodey replied. Tony laughed.
“Oh.” She said at last.
“Thank you JARVIS.” Tony said very quietly, but it was enough for everyone to look at them both. Tony tensed up and moved to hide behind Steve. The girl on the couch raised an eyebrow at them.
“I’m sure. I’ve been here before.” She replied. He shrugged and muttered something that she was too far away to hear. She didn’t really care though. She watched as he sped off and disappeared. Morgan gripped her phone a little tighter before walking into the woods.
the Stark heir, aren’t I?” Tony asked, standing up straight, looking Obi - Obadiah in the eye. Obadiah’s face hardened and he walked over to Tony. “You lied to me! You told me that people were cruel and hated me, when the truth is they’ve been looking for me for
“You said you would bring back my camera!” He yelled. Tony flinched again.
“Struggling-” Tony began, his voice shaking and took a deep to steady (Both his voice and himself). “Struggling is pointless.” He tried his best to sound brave, but he had never had the need to do that before. The only person he had ever talked to before was Obie.
“Can you show us what Morgan did?” He asked. “Maybe then we can to the same.”
“Jarvis must be worried sick! You had us scared half to death, think of him!” Pepper explained. Tony’s face fell. His face lost all color.
hide the bag. He wasn’t sure how no one noticed, but if anyone did, they sure as hell didn’t say anything. It was dark now, and the fireworks were going to start any minute, and Tony was getting excited and he knew what he had to do. Tony took a breath and handed the bag to Steve.
“I’m Natasha. What’s your name?” She said. Her voice was calm and held no hostility.
“Morgan, that’s not okay! You can’t just tell them that.”
“No we are all just, surprised, that's all.” Steve said, tripping over his words. “How could you build something that complicated so fast?” Tony shrugged.
“How many people are inside?” Tony asked. He could deal with one person, but multiple people? He had never seen more than two people before in person. Obie, and this guy Steve. And, of course, the hundreds of people he just walked by, but he never talked to any of them.
Morgan started to hyperventilate. She didn't. She couldn't have. It wasn't possible.
he had a weak heart. It was not looking good for him. But all he had to do was stall him, just for a little while longer. He had screamed for JARVIS to call the police, and the were probably on their way right now. Hopefully. He would not let himself be taken like this.
“Like a 30 minute car ride max.” Steve said. Tony cocked his head to the side.
“Thank you.” He said quietly and walked off into the hallway. Steve looked after him and turned to call in the pizza.
“Hydra.” He said. The group hardened and Bucky stiffened. Natasha turned to Morgan.
“Dad’s hurt we need to go.” Clint said sternly. No one moved to stop the two. Tony pulled out of Clint’s hold.
“Jesus, kid!” He exclaimed. “You’re hand is freezing!” She chuckled nervously. She hadn’t realized that she had given him her robotic hand.
“I gotta take this. I'm sorry.” Tony muttered. Bruce gave him a questioning look and Tony shook his head. Which screamed, ‘do not even ask.’ Tony walked off to the far side of the lab for a little privacy. “Hello?” He asked into the phone.
“Where are you from?” Bucky asked. Tony shrugged.
“What’s this?” Steve asked picking up a small device.
“No we have to go now. There is now choice.” Clint said dragging Tony.
“Why not call us home? Surely you have a way to.” Natasha said. She was interrogating her. Morgan had seen Natasha interrogate once. Tony was mad. Natasha had babysat her before the whole time travel thing and trouble followed.
“Alright.” Tony poked his head around the corner. She gave him a look.
“What are you thinking about?” Natasha asked. Still clearly not trusting her. Morgan smiled sadly. Of course she would ask that.
“Okay.” He said finally.
to stop but he couldn’t. Once he started, he really couldn’t stop himself. Steve shut him up by placing his hands on Tony’s shoulders.
After a while, they set up their blankets in the best spot they could find, and all sat down. Clint had brought food and drinks, and was more than happy to sit down after dragging the cooler all around the park. Tony’s hand tighten around the piece of fabric. There were way too many people and
“Alright, Alright.” He said, laughing a bit. “Found an old car and fixed it up it’s actually from the 30’s. I also found an old radio and fixed it up so they both work.” He said calmly.
“Get over here.” He said. Tony stood up and made his way over. A small thudding noise was heard. “What the hell was that?” Tony knew not to panic.
“You know, the fireworks are loud. I’m just warning you.” Steve said, a concerned look in his eyes. Tony nodded.
“How do you type that fast?” Tony asked.
find the people who did. We’ll just need to be careful about this.” She replied.
It was early morning and Bucky was waiting. If Steve loved this boy he’d need to have a conversation with him. To make sure things were clear. Tony made his way down the hallway looking ever happy. Bucky stood in front of him.
“So... my birthday is coming up.” Tony said. Obie smiled.
“He doesn’t.”
“I'll be staying in an apartment for a little while though until the new houses built.” Tony explained. “But, yes, I'm all right.”
she knew. She was alone. And it was her father’s and her Aunt’s death day.
“Like… Tony here. I had gotten to 50th floor when he knocked me out with a wrench.” Steve said, deadpan. A few of the people in room seemed to get angry, including Natasha. Tony shrunk down and almost turned to leave.
"Well, you see I was trying to fix up a… well a time machine I guess and I didn't know what it was and I sort of activated it." She said.
She let the tears fall as she saw them go back together after parting the first time. That was it, they were happy. They were in love. She looked to her side and smiled. It was over for her now but that was okay. There was no going back to her old life but it was worth it.
Yeah Have fun with that!
“Yes, my AI he man-” Tony started.
“Would you believe me if I said my Auntie Tasha?” Morgan asked. Natasha raised an eyebrow. “Yeah well, that’s what I was thinking about.” She muttered.
He explained the entire story to Pepper from the beginning, up until she’d walked in on Tony making coffee just a little while ago.. It wasn’t all that long, and Steve shorten it for her sake.
“Steve? What is going on here? Who is this?” The girl asked, walking in and closing the door behind her. Steve sighed. He walked over and placed a hand on Tony’s shoulder. Tony looked up at him with terror in eyes. The poor guy was shaking.
“I’m not sure. I guess we didn’t really find the need to name our kin- town.” Tony corrected.
“Tony, i've been sending you work too. Why aren’t you getting any of it done?” She asked. He could hear the desperation in her voice. He had to think fast to get her to feel better about it. It was almost as if an angel whispered in his ear.
“Uh, fine.” Tony stated. “We should be able to access them in about a minute. Why again?” Morgan sucked in a breath.
. This man was huge, he was built like someone who lived in the gym. How was Tony suppose to defend himself against this guy when he woke up?! Tony took a deep breath, he really didn't need to have a heart attack right now. “JARVIS? What should I do?” Tony cried at the ceiling. He probably looked pathetic but he didn’t care.
“Shh, Shh. It’s okay. It’s alright. It’s over now. We’re all safe.” Steve said. Tony looked up and kissed him. Everything was alright.
“Only that short? I thought it would be longer based on how far we seem from the tower.” Tony said, looking down. Steve shook his head.
“My first word was computer. Granted it was in Italian but it was computer all the same. Then my dad proceeded to shove a phone in my hands, much to my mom’s dismay.” She replied. It was true. Tony had given her a phone and Pepper just sighed and resigned herself to her fate that her daughter would take after Tony one way or another.
They walked around for a bit, and he always had one of the group members by his side. He felt… safe. Something he’d never felt before, unless he was completely alone. None of the vendor's caught his eye until he saw a one and his face lit up. He tugged on Steve’s arm a pointed to it.
“We have a job, you’re coming with us.” Steve said. Tony nodded.
“Tony I could-” He ended the call before she could finish. He tried to walk straight back but it ended up being more of a stagger everyone took notice.
“I thought you didn’t have a crush.” She said innocently. He pushed her shoulder as she giggled. “But yes. You should.” It saddened her a little. That she wouldn’t be there to see what they’re relationship became, but it was either their lives
"Could you take me down to my dad's old lab?" She asked. FRIDAY hesitated.
Steve was now sitting on the couch where Sam had sat, and Natasha was now on the floor with Clint. Sam had moved over and was now sitting next to Bucky. Tony walked over and sat on the ground next to the couch, with his legs folded neatly underneath him.
