“She suffered a miscarriage last night.” She hears Sam swear and then the door closes, she peeks around and both men have stepped outside to finish the conservation.
“The best,” she smiles, lifting her head from his shoulder. They kiss with a gentle passion, careful of the little life in their arms.
“No, I mean he sleeps with me. In my room. We’re kind of a couple.” Dean and Cas had never had that relationship. After his death, they had automatically fallen into something he supposes is a relationship. He just knows it’s love.
“Hey, sweetheart,” he says. He takes off his trench coat and wraps their son in it, rubbing at his back.
“No, you don’t get to come back in here!” she screams with tears in her eyes, “I needed you, we needed you,” she says and before she knows it she has slapped him across the face. He doesn’t move but a look of disbelief comes across his face.
“What,” he chuckles, awkwardly. “You want a baby?” He body stiffens up and he drops his hands from her body.
“Dee, I believe we are in an alternative universe,” Cas explains. “Let’s get Jack home and talk this over.”
She hears footsteps and prays she hasn’t woken Sam or his perfect little family up. “You’re in my spot,” Dean says. She looks up at him with blurred vision, he’s holding her purple dressing towards her and dark circles are settling under those eyes. “Thought you might get cold,” he says, offering her the garment. She was sat in her thin silky slip, bare feet and bare shoulders but she hadn’t considered the cold. She takes it from him and cuddles the dressing gown to her chest, feeling how soft it felt against her collar bones.
“God, I need to push,” she finally says, her legs shaking with holding back her strong natural urges.
She tiredly shakes her head. “No!” She takes his hand on hers and rubs at his knuckles. He should be comforting her, not the other way around. He wonders if he should ask Deanna if there was some else to text. Sam knew and she called Jody in tears as he set up the bed. Was there a man who should be informed of his impending fatherhood? She had been vague and avoided the subject her whole pregnancy. Sam even accused him of being the father at one point. She gasps in pain again.
“You see you have the perfect body to bear an angel, or two. When Cas gave it all up for you, we thought we could at least get a new soldier. The righteous woman and the rebellious little angel were going to create a perfect child, but you couldn’t even do that right.”
“Cas, you need to tell her,” he says. She scrunches up her nose, what does Cas need to tell her? Pregnancy brain had made her forget her own name, but she can’t think what Cas would need to tell her. Her heart drops, he was going to leave her. He had seen her sweaty, red face as she pushed out their child, had seen her stretch marks and leaking breasts, he was going to leave them. He didn’t want to be a father, and he was going to leave them all alone.
Her second child is a little blue but appears to be healthy enough to cry. She opens her arms up to quickly hold her second child, but her vision is starting to blur. The cord has already been cut and Rowena is rubbing vigorously at the baby’s back. She desperately needs to hold her child, needs him to be okay, needs to be safe in her arms.
“Don’t,” she snaps. She didn’t want to hear it, no sympathies, no ‘it’s not your faults’, no promises of another child in the future. “I couldn’t keep him safe. I failed him.” She finally lets go, sobbing into her hands. She doesn’t know if the pain has eased, Cas was working overtime or the shock of her miscarriage had numbed the pain. She looks down to see her panties magically clean, the blood celestially gone. She looks at Cas but he is looking down at his lap, hands clenched together on his knees. “What happens now?”
Cas is waiting at the roadhouse. He greets with Sam with a hug and a pat on the back. “You’re here!” Sam smiles. “I thought you were in The Empty.” All these years Sam thought he was in The Empty. Cas told him he saw Sam once. Went to visit him on Earth. He kept his distance, stayed invisible. Sam was happy with a family and a normal life, he didn’t need to a reminder of the life that killed his parents, killed his girlfriend, caused Dean’s death.
“I’m so sorry,” she whimpers, a tear falling from her eye. She shuts him off, ignoring his stressed tone, and concentrates on delivering her son. She digs the heels of her boots into the leather of the leather, wishing she had the energy to take them and her pants off and bears down. Her body was going to do it whether she wanted to or not. She reaches in her panties again, as the contraction ease, feeling the way her body was stretching around the top of her baby’s head. She tries to lift her body up and pulls the panties down to her ankles. Her thighs are slick with blood and bodily fluids.
Deanna stars to pant, her fingers clawing at his arms. Her belly is quivering against her shirt, her lips are parted and her eyelids heavy.
She wants to talk but she can’t move her dry mouth, can’t open her heavy eyes. Instead, she gently squeezes his hand. Her grip isn’t much, but she hopes he notices it.
“You’re right. I won’t pretend.” Cas' body relaxes in his arms, his hands busy stuffing a pillow into a case.
“I’m here,” he murmurs into her hair. This is the first time she had touched him since their loss. Last time they were like this she had a belly, she had larger breasts filling with milk, she had dreams of their future family. He presses his hand against her flat belly before he even realises it. She says nothing as he splays his hands against the now flat, empty space.
“It can help bring on labor,” she says, looking up at him with those blue eyes. She dives her right hand into her panties and starts to rub herself. “It helps ease the pain,” she says. He kneels down in front of her, discarding his wet towel to the floor, and watches her finger play under the thin material.
He finally hooks his hands in her grey cotton panties and pulls them down. He had only ever seen one woman naked before, and he had never inspected anything beneath the waistband. Her center is slick with blood and amniotic fluid. “Should I check for cervical dilation?”
She feels the first cramp after dealing with a haunting, she just blames the pain on the fall to the floor to duck from the incoming statue being thrown at her. She’s in a diner bathroom when she sees the spot of dried brown blood in her panties. She shrugs it off, it was normal to have some blood, she had read somewhere.
She thinks labor has started after she and Cas finish a rather long and slow 3 AM sex session. Cas makes her lie on the side and drink a glass of cold water, and they calm down. She thinks it would be a pretty funny story to their kids.
“Samuel, cut the cord,” Rowena tells her. She doesn’t notice any of the cord cutting, she’s too in love with the little girl in her arms
He watches her body open in slow motion. The teardrop opens slowly to an orb size. The orb grows more than he knew a woman’s body could. She is pushing as hard as she can, the baby finally crowning. The forehead and brow appear in the next push. It takes three more pushes for the nose to appear. Two later the lips and chin.
“You have to be a good big sister. You have to be brave and look after your little brother or sister. That’s what big sisters do. They’ll annoy you and sometimes you’ll hate them,” she strokes her little cheeks still slick but entirely perfect, “but you gotta look after them, protect them no matter what.”
He takes off his trench and jacket, letting them fall to the floor. She runs her hands down his shoulders and arms, feel how strong the muscles are underneath his shirt. He’s solid and powerful, his chest broad and strong.
The baby is hanging from her tired body, waiting for the final contraction. He can finally marvel at how amazing the female body was. The child was born up to the chest, her arms trapped inside her mother. He ponders if he should yank it out, but he knows he shouldn’t.
She tells Sam that she is going to get an in-clinic abortion as soon as possible. Turns out that soon wasn’t soon enough.
“That’s not the sort of language a mother of an angel should use. You see, heaven is missing angels, it needs a little power boost. Now we all thought Cas would finally come in use and create a Nephilim but he couldn’t even get it up for a beautiful woman like you.”
“I’m Sam Winchester, this is my brother Dean,” Sam explains. The woman lowers her gun and laughs before pointing it at Sam again.
“I understand.” He can see the hurt in Cas’ face. He had spent the first part of his afterlife convincing Cas that he did truly love him back. He wasn’t saying it out of politeness or courtesy. Cas was truly the one for him, he doesn’t know how he could convince him more.
“Cas, can you save it?” she mutters. He squats down in front of her and places her hand on her tight belly.
“See him,” Cas says, entwining their hands together. “I’ll be here, take your time.” Dean leans his forehead against Cas and takes in a deep breath.
When she gets to there she climbs onto the bed on all fours. It feels instinctive and natural to be in this position. Rowena disappears and comes back with Sam and their ingredients. Deanna finds this position has sped up the intensity of the contractions.
“And you’re not. You have the face of a 35-year-old, you go to dinner with our dead parents once a week, we drink at a bar that was destroyed over a decade again.”
“Yeah, well he’s not here!” she screams. He looks down solemnly. He doesn’t know what to say but she knows he’s right. She’s tired and she’s slow, her stubbornness could be detrimental to the case. She sinks back into her chair and lets him go alone.
“I was kidding about the bottle tops. It’s adorable you can read minds, but you can’t use a bottle opener.”
“I think I need to push,” she murmurs, throwing her arm over her face. She squeezes her eyes closed, the only sound in the room her deep breathing. He positions himself between her open legs, knowing he was going to deliver their child. All he could do was use his instinct, and hope Cas could do the worst of it.
She ends up sliding down his side in pain, and her head falling onto his lap. Her legs stretch out before her, blood pooling on the dirty tiles. Her child deserved a better place to die. If she was alone she might have sobbed or punched the tiles, but in Cas’ company, she couldn’t let go. Instead, she lays her face on his thigh and cries slow and silent tears. Her body is contracting and clotting, she has no control over what is happening. Cas’ hand sits awkwardly on her back, occasionally patting it.
“Dee, Dee? Can you hear me?” he says, clutching her face in her hands. Her mouth is too dry to speak but Cas soon helps her sit up with a drink. He looks tired and she sees the armchair in the corner he has been spending all his time.
“I don’t feel well,” she snaps at Sam when he asks why they were stopping. She books a separate room, telling Sam she didn’t want to pass her illness over to him. Her panties are soaked through with blood, it has smeared down her thighs and into her jeans. She changes her panties and places the biggest sanitary pad she can find in her luggage in the black cotton.
“He knew I didn’t want him,” she quietly murmurs. She rests her head on his shoulder, noticing that he didn’t breathe. “He knew. I didn’t mean it.” It’s he, in all her dreams it was a he.
The car door opens and Cas is talking to her. She can’t make out what he’s saying, something about shock and sleeping. She can’t bring herself to ask him to repeat it. He carries her to their bed, the unused hospital bag on the floor, the bassinet in the corner to never be used, the plastic sheet rolled up under the bed in preparation for a home birth.
“I never said that. It’s late. Let’s talk in the morning.” She crawls out of bed, feeling the cold tiles on her bare feet.
She had planned this moment so many times, kept herself awake with the ways their first kiss would go. She wraps her arms around his neck and breathes him in. It’s that chick flick moment where sparks fly and the credits roll.
“They will be used as a weapon, they will be exploited and hurt by heaven.” He loosens his grip on her, letting her gasp for breath.
She wakes up gasping for breath. Cas is sat beside her watching a weather report on the grainy tv. “You were having a nightmare.”
“She didn’t,” Sammy snaps. “They can’t. Months Cas and I spent trying to save her, but Dee died during the birth. Cas died during defending her during the birth. I-”
He goes to the bathroom to get cleaned up and puts his boxers back on, ignoring the tiredness in his muscles. She’s changing the sheets when they get back, panting slightly with the movement. He agrees to lie down, if she lies down alongside him. He falls asleep quicker than he would like, Cas asleep in his arms with one hand on her belly. He drifts in and out of sleep, noticing her wriggling around in his arms.
“Jack and I worked hard to give you both this type of heaven, she deserves to be happy. If you can’t support it, then I think you should go.”
She made do with what clothing she had, mainly walking around in his shirts as dresses, and little else. It was incredibly sexy, especially when she started rounding out. He obliges her command and walks towards her parted legs. She kisses his flat stomach, licking at the water droplets left to run down. His member twitches at her kisses, her finger tracing the patterns of his abs.
“I don’t care,” she grunts. He pushes her legs apart and positions himself between her legs. He brings his fingers up to probe her passage. She is hot and slick, her passage swollen. He inserts two fingers into the slit, he doesn’t need to probe long before he feels the hardness of her baby’s crown.
“I’m sorry,” he says, tucking a piece of hair behind her ear. “I shouldn’t have taken you here. We should have stayed closer to the bunker. We should drive to the hospital.”
She rubs her belly, feeling quite forceful kicks under her fingertips, and thinks about how lucky her children will be to have such a wonderful family. Cas is already a wonderful father, Sam the most loving uncle a kid could have and Jack was so excited to be a big brother. She was just sad she wouldn’t be alive to see it.
“Keep him warm, we’ll be there soon,” he says. He’s crying, she can hear it in his voice. All blankets are in the trunk and the backseat has nothing on it. She takes the spluttering baby and holds him to her chest, feeling the umbilical cord against her. She unbuttons her shirt and slips him inside it, hoping that between the flannel and her breast he would stay safe. She buttons the shirt up over him, engulfing his body.
“Creating doors to universes can do that to a two-year-old. Can’t believe something that powerful came from my vagina,” she chuckles. He sits down beside her and gives her a look that isn’t foreign to him. The one she gives back is certainly not one he would ever return.
“Do you want to see it?” Sam asks. “Your baby. I was thinking of getting an ultrasound machine, or at least a doppler to hear the heartbeat.”
“I still feel her little kicks in the morning,” she quietly tells him, a hand splayed across her flat belly. “I can feel that she likes warm showers, not cold ones and sometimes I think I can feel her moving around.” Cas gently takes her hand in his. He wants to kiss the back of her hand but he’s scared she’d punch him from the gentle action.
“Yeah, I promise,” she says. She lays down on the bed, being able to freely rub her tummy without worrying it would be drawing attention to it.
Dean can’t believe who is sat in front of him. She has his green eyes, his freckles, his scars, his bow legs. She loves Led Zeppelin, drives an Impala, hates salads, loves beer. Sammy is sat beside her, tall and thin, her neck long and her arms strong. Jack is small and fragile yet a happy child. He climbs over the table and pulls at Deanna’s hair.
“I’m bleeding,” she gasps. He’s looking over her for a bleeding cut. “The baby, I think I’m losing it.” He walks towards her and she takes a step back, until she’s pushed up against the bathroom sink, and places a hand on her belly. She feels the warm tingle of his grace running through her atoms.
She distracts herself with watching Sam clutching her daughter, she’s reaching out to clutch his shirt, her little hand gripping hard onto her uncle. “Looks like they’re cooperating, clearly doesn’t take after their mother,” Rowena says. She carries on for what feels like an eternity, pushing and rubbing, talking to Sam about ingredients and spell work.
“Aw, a surprise? I suppose these days everyone is so gender-neutral. I imagine you’re going home to your husband and laugh at this old broad here talking about gender.”
Dean is nervous for the first time in years. For the first time since Cas stood in front of him. Since the first time he held his angel in his arms and said, “Me too.”
She runs out their bedroom, trying not to slam the door behind her. She should have known Dean would have become bored with her, just look at his track record of relationships. She at least lasted longer than their motel stay, she had already beaten every woman she had ever seen him sleep with. He doesn’t follow her; he probably rolls over and goes back to sleep. He was never committed to her, she was just there.
“Fuck,” he murmurs. He pulls away from her and sits up in bed. He turns on the light and rubs his eyes. “I didn’t think you meant it.”
“I don’t think she should hunt with you today,” she hears Cas say. She has her back to the door, the sheets celestially cleaner than they should be. Cas has tucked the sheet around her and then draped his trench over her body.
“Crazy, eh?” he responds with a crooked response. “My little Sammy, a Dad with his own kid to look after.”
“I can’t,” she whines, with chattering teeth. He starts kneading at her belly, pushing against the soft skin. She closes her eyes again and leans back with a sigh. Her body starts to contract again as he squeezes at her belly. She feels the needs to push again as he starts flicking her nipples. It seems a strange thing to do, but she knows Cas is doing it for a reason. Something slimy falls between her legs. “He’s dead, isn’t he?” she misses feeling him against her chest, misses hearing the little splutters of her son.
“One of each?” she murmurs, leaning back and blinking. Her eyes well up. Knowing their gender gave them some form of identity, she could start to picture what they looked like, two faces she would never see again.
She goes back to bed and tries to distract herself with music and TV. 3 days later and she’s still in the same spot, her muscles aching and her joints tired. Nothing is painful enough to make her scream but noticeable enough to wear her body out.
She sobs into her desk. It was all happening too soon. There was too much left to do, so much left to say. She had felt this before, the ticking time bomb over her head, but back then it was her and Sam, two siblings on the road with the sweetest car in existence. Now she had a home, had a family, had a partner. She cries for all the moments she would miss with her children. Their first bath, their first words, their first day at school. She wouldn’t be able to soothe their cries, tuck them in at night, teach them how to tie their lace. Sam and Cas would do a good job, she knew that, but they would never meet their mother.
“I don't think so,” She nods, she trusts his judgement. “Sam brought some supplies. Some pie and some,” he walks over to the table and carefully places down the boxes and picks up a plastic packet of sanitary towels. “pads for menstruation?”
“I know,” he replies, holding onto her arms to keep her steady. Her back is stiff and her legs wobbly.
“You can, just listen to your body, we’ll be there soon,” Cas tells her, sounding miraculously calm. “He’ll be in your arms soon, hold in there.”
“Like I didn’t see all those heart eyes,” she smiles. “Now let’s get back to helping these wee ones topside.”
She doesn’t think she’d feel the exact moment her baby left her body, but she does. She sits upright so quickly her head spins. She yanks down her panties, not caring who will see her privates (he did build her, so surely he knew what she looked like naked?). There was a little balloon shape lump sitting in the blood-drenched panty liner. “Is that it?” she murmurs.
“Just a little cold and shocked. He came a little quickly. Take him to the other car, turn the heating on and help him warm up.”
“Is there a problem?” he asks. She laughs and unbuttons his shirt. She pushes him down so he’s lying on the bed before she mounts him. She straddles his waist, enjoying the contact of her crotch against his own. She leans over him and kisses him gently, reassuring him that this was very much what she wanted.
She won’t let herself think that something had happened to Cas because she was pregnant with his child. Their child would be born with neither parent, although it would probably do better being brought up by Sam. She stands up to stretch, feeling the onset of cramp in her leg. She notices the dirty, dusty full length mirror. She stands in front of it, displeased with all the new weight she was now carrying. They all said her belly was small, but she felt huge with her round face and wobbly thighs. She slides her blazer off and throws it onto the bed, she lifts up her shirt to reveal the hard, tanned belly. She slides her sensible slacks off and fully takes in her new body. She lets herself lovingly rub her belly, feeling the little life inside move around. She had no idea why she wanted this kid so much. Getting rid of it didn’t cross her mind. She’d happily give her life for something that could do some good.
“It looks very small. I believe it passed some weeks ago.” She cradles the little sac in her hands, ignoring the other jelly-like clots around it.
“Are you in pain?” he asks. She absent mindlessly strokes her large belly, that peers up between the bubbles in the water.
Her libido had been sky high the last few weeks. She had spent the last few weeks, during her insomnia, masturbating through the night. She found a good self-induced orgasm helped ease her joint pains. She lets Cas rub her swollen body until she thinks she’s going to come, he’s using his grace to help ease some of her soreness and the warm pulses are going straight to her crotch.
Their daughter is quiet, asleep in the bundle of blankets. Cas is always worried she’s too cold, worried she’s hungry, worried her sleeping pattern isn’t right. “Hey,” she whispers. He looks up from the perfect being they created and smiles.
Cas doesn’t come back and she refuses to interact with anyone. All she does is pee, eat grilled cheese, cry and sleep. She’s so tired, her breasts so sore, she can barely eat without throwing up. She Googles every symptom, there is nothing special about her pregnancy symptoms. This wasn’t some side effect of being knocked up by an angel, this was totally normally. Why would woman want to go through this multiple times?
He’ll never forget the look on his dad’s face when he first sees him with Cas. He automatically threw his arm over his shoulder and sees the look of disgust on his father’s face. He walks straight out, Mary apologetically following him. He could feel the tenseness in the air, every time he crossed paths with John. He was disappointed, that wasn’t unusual, but disgusted was a new one.
Sam tells him about Eileen, about his son, about his retirement. Dean tells about the roadhouse, about LARPING with Charlie, playing pool with Jo. He doesn’t much the flat he shares with Cas. He doesn’t mention the ring he wears around his neck.
She opens his bottle of whiskey unapologetically and brings it, alongside a glass, to his favourite spot on the kitchen floor. She drinks and cries, mourning the end of a relationship. They told her she was stupid, to give up her grace for one man. They warned her not to waste so many years protecting a human who would never love her in the same way she loved him.
“You want me to get someone?” he whispers, one hand on her elbow. He can see the look of panic dance through her features. “Let’s get you back to the bed.”
“It hurts!” she grunts, but the pain only strengths her determination. Was he supposed to cup the baby’s head or pull it out of her? He doesn’t have to think long before their perfect baby slides out alongside a gush of fluids. He quickly takes their child, a little girl, in his arms. “Is she okay?”
“No one is dead,” he says gently, with a smile. “You want to see your mommy? Dee, take your shirt off to get skin to skin contact.” Someone has changed her into a clean, baggy shirt that probably belonged to a guy she had once met at a bar. Only then does she notice the wet patches on her breasts. She strips herself of her shirt, noticing the way her breasts have changed shape, and takes her son in her arms.
She realises her eyes are open the whole trip, but she can’t focus on everything. The leather of the Impala is a blur to her. Cas is driving and the passenger seat is empty, this would have brought her terror this morning but now she had no care about who was driving her Baby. She felt empty, beaten up and bruised inside. She’s stopped bleeding, but she can smell the aftermath of the birth in the car. She’d never get that blood out the leather. She knew she should have but blankets down that morning in case.
“I’m sorry,” he says, looking up at her solemnly. “Your child has already passed.” She knows it, she knows that her body is empty.
“Don’t do that!” he shouts. “Avoid pushing, pant, just relax.” Relax, she snorts, relax, when a human life was threatening to split her open.
“This is our daughter, Stephanie,” Cas says. She could see hearts light up in his eyes when he looked at their daughter.
“I gave up everything for you,” she says, feeling the tears roll down her face. “I gave up my grace for you.”
“The most homoerotic film in existence, great,” she mutters. She feels duped because as soon as Jack sees Cas he moves to the floor, forcing Cas to sit beside her. She soon falls asleep on the angel, because that is what she does. He carries her to her bed, because that is what he does.
“Congratulations,” he says. He moves to sit beside her, passing the tiny human to her mother. “She’s beautiful.”
“She’s so small,” Jack says, sitting on the seat next to her. Sam has started running around doing his Harry Potter nonsense, she pays him no attention. All that mattered was remembering every inch of her daughter’s tiny face.
Dean slaps Cas’ ass with the rag. “One day you’ll open a beer cap correctly,” he says, watching the angel struggle to get the cap open.
Sam takes a step forward and gently says, “Hi, how did you get in here?” The kid stops running and looks up at him, gently smiling at the giant. Sam leans down and the kid runs up and wraps his arms around Sam. “Where did you come from, little guy?”
He’s gone a few days later. She shouts and she cries, she begs and falls to her knees, but he doesn’t stay. He has a mission which he has to complete, he has a lead he has to follow. She sits on the floor and sobs until Sam finds her.
“Well, I don’t.” Sam is rightly cagy about the baby. About the Nephilim, she had drunkenly created with Cas. She knows he wants to ask about her and Cas’ status, whether it was a one-time accident, whether she kept this baby out of love for the angel. She’s glad, she can’t answer any of those questions.
Her baby isn’t in the car, no doubt dead in Jack’s arms. It feels cruel to not let her be with him in their final hours. She wants him to be buried in Lawrence, she hopes Cas knows that, but its not something you put in the birth plan.
Dean doesn’t let out his breath until he’s upstairs, knowing Sam is not around. He rests his forehead on Cas’ shoulder, trying not to think of the worst-case scenarios.
Five weeks later she starts to get the symptoms. She has her first bout of morning sickness, she has her first cramps and suddenly becomes exhausted all the time.
“I’m sorry. I couldn’t have given you the life you deserved,” she says, kneeling in front of the mound of dirt she had just dug. “I couldn’t have been a good mother to you. You deserved more. I’m fucking sorry. If I could do it all over again, I would, believe me.”
“Enough from you. Any more and I’m cutting off your apple juice,” Dean says with a chuckle, pointing a finger at the redhead.
“Let me in, let me talk to her,” he begs with Cas. She looks around, trying not to disturb her daughter. Cas is blocking the front door, his broad body stopping her brother from entering their cabin.
“I remember when Sammy was this small,” he says, before clearing his throat with emotion. “Dad gave him to me and told me I had to look after him, no matter what. That’s what big brothers do, protect at all costs.”
“I miss being pregnant, at the time you hate it, but you’ll miss it when they’re all grown up and don’t need you.”
“I don’t want to hurt you,” he whispers into her thighs. She lifts his chin up to look at her. Her lips are fuller and her nose wider, her face a little softer with pregnancy. They stare at each other for some time, reading how the other was feeling. He comes off his knees and sits beside her on the bed, feeling unsure but trusting of his partner.
“I have known Sam some years. I do not believe he would have an issue with you being with a man. I believe he will be happy to see you being so happy.”
She stares at her phone, no messages from him, nothing. She rings in, it goes straight to voicemail but she appreciates hearing his voice. “Hey, Cas, I mis-,” she clears her throat, “How you doing, Cas, this case is shit but we’ll sort it out. Sam is out now, the cops around here can’t take evidence for shit. Baby is good. Size of a pineapple. Hopefully less prickly. Who decided babies are measured in fruit? Weird man. I’m not sleeping much, even less than usual,” she darkly chuckles, “Back hurts a lot, probably because I’ve got really fat, but I’m all good. Look after yourself.” She hangs up and tries not to think of the worst.
Their little girl looks up at him with bright blue eyes. He places her on Cas’ chest and hears the first cries. He is instantly in love. Their daughter cuddles up on Cas’ chest and Dean wants to remember this moment forever. “Dean,” she says with a quivering voice.
“I’m sorry, I shouldn’t ha-,” he says, he stops when he sees her wide gummy smile. She grabs him by the back of the neck and kisses him passionately.
“Yeah, we’re in our own little bubble. Eileen, Charlie, Bobby, Rufus they’re all here. Even Mom and Dad live over there,” he points vaguely at a cabin in the difference. He doesn’t see them often. Sometimes they come into the roadhouse, but an awkward silence appears when everyone looks up and sees John. They soon leave
She’s six weeks pregnant when she drives with Sam to Wichita. She scheduled an abortion for the earliest they could do. It’s expensive and it’s scary. The idea she’s going to be knocked out with her legs open is more terrifying than any vampire or demon or wraith.
“It’s fine, Jack uses his mojo. Big brother says they are okay.” Jack beams whenever he gets called big brother and she knows he’s going to love the little duo, even if he’ll be a chaotic influence on them.
Sam is snoring in the adjacent bed as she lays wide awake. She splays her hand on her flat belly and wishes her problem away. She didn’t want to make this decision. She couldn’t be a mother, couldn’t strap a baby on her back and hunt down the devil, like her dad would have done. But she had made her lifelong mission to save innocent, not kill them because she was stupid enough to forget to use protection.
On her way to there was a job. There always was a job. Sure, Chuck was dead, but there were always some nasty waiting to be ganked. It was just one lone vamp, a pretty easy job. She was driving on the highway when she sees a little kid run into the road. She was bleeding and shaken. Every maternal instinct Deanna was sure she didn’t have kicks in.
He looks down at the tiny newborn, barely four hours old. He has that perfect smell and little rosy cheeks. He had done nothing but sleep and feed since he was born, but he was just perfect.
She takes a long hot shower. It was her own fault, she had gotten caught up in the moment. The idea of her angel wanting her, the idea she could finally have him in her arms. She punches the shower wall in anger, she had signed her death sentence because she couldn’t keep her legs closed.
“No,” she sighs, resting her head in his hands. Her body was so tired, her joints aching and morning sickness ongoing. “I don’t want to know. I want to keep on thinking my baby, mine and Cas’ kid is okay, is good and healthy and freaking normal,” Sam nods, but he doesn’t get it. She touches her belly, feeling it protrude above the top of her pelvic bone. She gets up and feels a sharp lower abdominal pain that causes her to sink back into her seat.
She takes long baths to ease the symptoms. Her legs cramp, her back aches and hips are constantly in pain. Sam buys her all the body pillows the Impala can carry, keeping one in every room to trying and ease her discomfort. Her phone rings and she struggles to reach out and pick it up from the floor.
“It’s good to hear your voice.” She smiles to herself, closing her eyes and enjoying the comfortable feeling a normal pregnant woman must hear when talking to their partner.
“Don’t you fucking dare!” she shouts. She drives, clutching onto the wheel, for another fifteen minutes before it becomes unbearably painful. She feels physically sick and little dots are clouding her vision. She turns off the highway at the next exit, ending up parked behind an abandoned garage. “My water!” she gasps. She can feel the liquid pooling between her thighs, darkening on her yoga pants. “Fuck, this hurts.”
He traces patterns on her large quivering belly. He sees the area between her legs bulge. He knew every curve of her body’s landscape, and it was changing as she prepared to push. He couldn’t see the head but it was clearly there, just inside her. He doesn’t know what to tell her, anything of those cliches of pushing and breathing redundant.
“Jack saved me, saved us,” Deanna adds with a casual shrug. She was a pretty hot woman, even if he did say so himself. The freckles he hated somehow looked beautiful along her tanned skin, the green eyes he had thought were boring we pretty striking on her.
“Yes, the two of them,” he replies. Deanna runs to the nearest trash can to throw up the remnants of the healthy lunch Sam had made them. Cas runs to her side before Sam can get up, rubbing her back and looking back at Jack.
“Bring your legs up, Deanna,” he urges, remembering the passages he’d read in his books. He helps her draw her shaking legs back as far as they can go. Her face is red and scrunched up in pain. Her frantic pushing comes to nothing. Cas scans his memory for something to help her.
“I know,” he says with a little sigh. “If I had stopped you going on that case. If I had spoken to Sam first.”
“I must, this is my fault,” he says, brows furrowed. He looks at with an expression of grief. Years ago this would have come easy to him but now he knew the joy of being a father, of the unconditional love of a child.
He could weep with relief, the shoulder slipping beneath the bone. But then she lets out a cry and fear enters his body again. The shoulders are straining against her swollen slit. Blood is seeping into the sheets, staining the cheap white cotton. He just shouts at her to push, ignoring her cries and her wails. Her muscles spasm and her legs slide back down the bed to sit at either side of his body. He leans down to instinctively kiss her shaking knee.
“Jack is not wiping out our kid!” she snaps, pulling away from his touch. “I will not have that sit on his conscience; the kid has enough issues how it is.”
The house is quiet, and her body fills with fear. She lets out a breath when she sees him on the sofa. He is bent over a little bundle of blankets. She walks around the side in their cabin on tiptoes, careful to not disturb the scene.
She writes a letter to her babies. She tells them about her parents, about childhood, about her life. She ponders writing a version of her life without monsters, an edited fairytale where everyone she had loved hadn’t died. She writes about her love for Cas, about her love for Sam, about Jack, about Mary, about Bobby. She wishes Bobby could hold her child and pretend he didn’t love them like his own grandkids, she wishes her mother could hold her hand during her labor, she wishes Charlie could distract her with her silly science fiction tv shows.
“Sit down.” He gently rubs her back. It’s been too long without any change. They had to wait it out, nothing else they could do in this new world. There were no doctors, no medical delivery equipment, no handbooks. They had raided a hospital for what they could, and he had listened to any second-hand stories from those in the camp with children. It was out of their hands, is the only thing he was sure of.
He kisses the top of her head. She leans up and gently kisses him, her lips barely touching his. “I can’t, I’m still not ready.”
“You saying I should give it all up for the apple pie life. Get a little house in the country and become a real housewife of Kansas?”
“I know,” she murmurs. She feels the bed dip under his weight. The last they were in this position they were making love and created a child.
“Because God is shutting down our world?” Sammy adds. She’s smart and cautious, elegant in her actions. His sister was kinda hot, if you liked tall and skinny chicks, Dean thinks.
“I have so much left to do,” she sobs into Sam’s arms. He holds her tight and reminds her that Cas has found a solution. No, Cas thinks he found something, and she had given up hope months ago.
She is released from the pain, turning back over to face him. Her legs are trembling and beads of sweat resting at her hairline. He sits awkwardly at the side of the bed.
“You need to buy me dinner before you can look at me like that,” she quips, feeling nausea in my back of her throat.
“Jack, our universes Jack, he was never a child and his parents were very different,” Sam says. He seems to be dealing with the situation with a calm level of amusement. He didn’t have to see himself as a mother, see himself (or is it herself?) so deeply in love with Cas.
She has nightmares. She sees her dead child fall out of her on repeat, every version more and more warped. At first, he is cold and blue, then he is glowing blue with grace, then he is warped and twisted with a face of pure evil, next he has the teeth of a werewolf, and it goes on and on.
She spends the next few weeks in her room, not feeling in the jolly nesting spirit anymore. She’s overheated, she’s tired, she’s forgetful and always needs to pee. Every time she gets a pain she panics, she’s not ready to go, not ready to leave her family.
She winks at him before saying, “I’ll hit the sack before I get a full lecture from this one. You coming me with me, angel?” He smiles at her, all gums and crinkly eyes. It’s the most human Cas has ever looked. “Don’t ignore it. You’ll regret it,” she says, looking directly at him.
“Bored.” She kisses him again, this time deeper. She makes a little squeaking noise and wraps her hand under the bump.
Cas leaves when she is 33 weeks pregnant (it’s the size of a celery). He has a pretty good lead in Alaska, he thinks he has found a spell that could save her. She’s too tired to waddle after him, she knows it wouldn’t do anything to make him stay.
“I’m not going anywhere,” he says. He leans in and kisses her forehead. He tucks a stray piece of hair behind her ear.
“Our babies they are doing so well,” she hears a voice say, Cas is closer than he is was. She feels his hand reach out and hold hers. “I’m sorry I wasn’t there, I can’t tell you enough how sorry I am. I thought I was doing the right thing. If I wasn’t here, they wouldn’t be able to find you, find them. I love you, I wish you knew that.”
“You and me?” he looks away from her, suddenly finding the chair in the corner interesting. “I have. When I heard about you and April, I was jealous. I kept waiting for the right time but there was never one. The monsters kept coming and the world kept ending.”
“We can’t go to the hospital. No one can know,” she whimpers. By now, she was wishing it would just use the sunroof and burst through her chest. Sam disappears despite her complaints.
She drifts in and out of conscious for a few days, hearing her children cry, hearing Cas tell them stories about his exploits with the Winchesters. She finally opens her eyes to the bright lights of the infirmary. She lies there with open eyes for what feels like an eternity before Cas notices.
The walk silently to her room, making sure to not wake anyone else up in the bunker. It’s the first time he’s been in her room since they lost their daughter. The first time she had acknowledged their loss since the buried her ashes in the nearby forest. The stand in front of each other at the end of her bed, their bed.
“Let me see,” he says with a gulp. “Is that okay?” he asks. She nods, her body limp like a ragdoll. His heart is racing looking at the blood-stained denim. He unbuttons her jeans with a shaky hand, hooking his fingers in the waistband and yanking them down. Her panties and thighs are stained with red. He looks away, embarrassed at seeing her so vulnerable. No number of books prepare you for the moment in real life.
“No,” she interrupts. She has to see them asleep, see them like a normal mom would see her babies. “Take me to them.” Cas helps her out of bed. She is wearing pyjamas and she knows Cas has washed and dressed her, brushed her hair and cared for her as she slept. Cas helps her to the chair beside the two cribs. They both lay asleep. Her daughter is as perfect as she imagined. Her son is smaller but beautiful, his tiny fist clenched above his head. “I missed so much.”
“It’ll kill me,” she murmurs, staring at the ceiling. “I don’t want it. I can’t have it.” She feels a tightening in her chest as she says those words.
“I love you, Cas,” she gasps. He can’t acknowledge. He knows she is scared and in pain, she doesn’t mean it. She dips her fingers inside her passage, gasping a little. She must be able to feel her child’s head. She strokes it gently until the next pain comes. Alongside this pain comes a gush of fluid. “I’m sorry,” she cries.
Soon, she feels the head against her entrance. It takes a few hard pushes before Rowen says she can see the head. All she can focus on is the odd sensation of her baby working through her pelvis and down the birth canal. Suddenly there is burning as they crown. Rowena grabs her hand and holds it between her legs. She can feel her open entrance, burning and sore, and between it the soft skin of her child’s head.
Sam is waiting on the bridge, bleary-eyed and dazed. He looks exactly how he remembered him. Hair too long, limbs long and smile wide. He hugs him closely and smiles. He takes a long looking. He hadn’t forgotten a single detail of his baby brother.
He leans in and kisses her deeply, meshing their tongues together. He leans over her until she’s on her back. Somehow, he’s managed to get the dressing gown on the floor behind her, so her head never touches the cold tiles. “This is really sexy,” he growls, fingering at the lace around her breasts.
“I understand. I’m not here for that.” She finally lets go, lets her guard down, sobbing into his chest. He takes her face in his hand and kisses the trails of tears that are running down her cheeks. They’re tinted black from the mascara she was wearing that morning.
“You deserve more than me, Cas,” she says, one lone tear running down her splotchy yet beautiful face.
“I’m sorry.” He looks down at his hands, unsure the right words to convey their grief. He isn’t wearing his trench coat, he knows it makes Deanna uncomfortable. It reminds her of the angel who betrayed who, the angel she blamed for her mother’s death.
When her belly hardens, she braces her leg on either side of him. Her ankles hook around his hips for leverage. She is cupping her sex, moaning and grunting. He can see the way her legs tremble, her child slipping further down inside her.
“Fine,” she responds, arms crossed across her ample chest. She leans down and kisses her sleeping son gently on the head. She gets up and helps Cas stand without waking little Jack. She kisses him again before kissing Cas. Dean can’t look away, it was such a gentle and familiar kiss between the couple. Sam shows Cas where to sleep, asking him questions about food and blankets on their way.
The room has no windows, and the door is sealed tightly shut. They search and they search for a secret door in the wall, a ventilation hatch in the ceiling, anything to get them out. Finally, a man appears from thin air in a white suit.
“I wasn’t going to let him die a virgin,” He gulps, he remembers that night. Staying up all night drinking and laughing, comparing absent fathers and strip club disappointments. “Purgatory was fun, eh?” she says with a wink. “You do have a Cas right, who is, I presume, a female?”
He sticks around for a few weeks after. She finally feels comfortable to nest, now all her family was here. They set up a room with two of everything in it. Jack gets involved in decorating, although paints more of himself than he does the wall. Cas finds flat-pack furniture infuriating and she sees him lose his cool at an alarming frequency. Sam is a bit better, although he gets a little too excited at the instruction manual.
“I have to get the towels,” she says. She waddles away, making herself busy. She can’t stop wincing, the contraction getting closer and closer together. He recognises the noises, it was the same noise that happened when she broke her leg. It was the noise she made when she was shot and didn’t tell him until after the mission was completed.
“Technically you’re not pregnant, it’s just an anxious egg and a whole bunch of eager sperm,” Sam explains.
“It’s my fault. We should have had this life years ago. I should have given her this life years ago,” he says, he thinks she can’t hear him.
“I’m here,” he says. In all the wiggling, she has kicked her phone onto the floor. She can hear his muffled voice coming up from under the seat of the Impala. She takes a deep breath; she could do high pressured situations, she could act quickly, she was trained to be prepared. She had spent her whole life preparing for the unexpected, she could do this. She grunts again at the pain, her body squeezing by itself. It was the lack of control she couldn’t do. She tries to relax but her body is acting on its own accord.
“Hello, I’m so happy to finally meet you,” she says. Her daughter lets out a loud cry and looks up at her with blue eyes. She falls to her knees in relief and joy. Sam quickly grabs a yellow towel and wraps it around her. “I’m your mommy, you won’t know me for very long, but you have to know how much I love you. How much I loved your father. I never wanted to leave you, never want you to not have a mommy.” She knows it’s pointless to say it to the minute’s old infant, but she has to say those words out loud.
“You ever think about Gia?” she tiredly mumbles into his neck, her cold bare legs entwining with his.
“If still had all my powers, if I was fully healed,” She shakes her head, almost in pain and the thought he could blame himself for their loss. She wraps her arms and her legs around him, burying her head in his shoulder. “I’m not going to leave you, Deanna.”
“Almost there, thank goodness your children aren’t as impatient as you,” Deanna reaches out to grab Jack’s hand, gripping it tightly and taking deep breaths. Rowena finally lets go and she can let out a deep, shaky breath.
“It is for us!” Cas shouts. He looks around and then down, embarrassed at his little outburst. “This is our reality.”
“It’s was kind of obvious.” Dean lets out a sigh of relief he thinks he might have been keeping in since he arrived in heaven.
She lies back, legs open in front of him. He dives in, finally giving in to his urges. He kisses from her toes, all the way up to her inner thigh. Her pussy is glistening wet under the low light. He cautiously licks at her core, opening up her folds with his tongue. She rolls onto her side, letting him know exactly what she wants. He kisses up her back, crawling up their large bed before slotting into place beside her. They tangled their limbs together, a well-rehearsed dance, before he enters her.
“You do whatever you need to,” he says. It’s like she couldn’t hold back anymore, and he had now given her permission. Her whole body tenses and she gasps. Cas is memorized by her heaving chest, the plaid rising and falling. She holds out her hand, and he takes it. She squeezes him so hard, her knuckles become white.
“I’m here, I feel like I’ve lost a fight to three vamp nests, but I’m here,” she reassures him, before leaning in for a kiss. “You were worth it, James,” she says to her son.
“I think she’s in shock,” he replies. She clings tight to the life hidden in the trench coat on her chest. “Can I hold him?” She nods and eases her grip, allowing him to take him in his arms. He beams down at his son, whose face is scrunched tightly. “Jack!” he shouts. “Meet your little brother.” Jack perches on the end of the passenger seat and takes his brother in his arms. Cas helps him hold him safely, supporting his head correctly.
“I haven’t come like that in years,” she gasps, her chest heaving in ecstasy. He raises his wet fingers up and inspects them, before licking her taste from them. “Come here,” she whispers, hooking her fingers into the waistband of his boxers.
“Thanks, kid,” she says, finally looking up at him. Their kid would have his blue eyes, would have his furrowed brows, would have his worried look. They would hopefully not have her anger, her freckles, her coping mechanisms.
“Why does it deserve to die? Because its parents were fucking idiots,” she snorts. He stands up with clenched fists. She’s in shock when he grabs her by the coat lapels and pushes her against the wall.
Dean can’t believe his eyes as he watches the action from behind the hallway wall. Cas appears from the crack, knife in his hand. Sam carefully drops the child back to the floor so he can run into the angel’s arms. “Cas!” he can’t help himself. It was his Cas, the Cas that was away on some mission. His Cas in a grey flannel shirt that made those eyes look even bluer. The child looks comfortable in his arms, his head tucked into the side of Cas’ neck and his arms grabbing at his shirt.
“I know,” she gasps. He helps her off the floor. “I feel like I need a shower now. For junkless gits, they sure like to touch the goods.”
“No shit,” she murmurs, rubbing at her head. Her body feels stiff, like she had taken a few rounds against demon stunt double number #3. She gets up and feels her knees crick. She stands in front of the bathroom and takes a deep breath before looking inside. It’s pristine, probably cleaner than when she arrives. It was as if nothing had happened. For a second, she wondered if the whole thing was a nightmare, and that she was still pregnant.
“You were in shock. You were bleeding and haemorrhaging so much,” he takes a gulp, like the rest of the sentence is too much to say.
“I promise, Sam will not be angry. He named his son after you, you are deeply loved by your brother.”
She has to sit at the edge of the bed, her body too heavy to stand for too long. He sits down beside her, and they kiss again, their knees knocking together. He takes the moisturizer from her hand and opens it. He smells the light vanilla scent, before dipping a finger in it. He smears it across her new, large breasts. She looks down at the smear of white and laughs. She dips her fingers into the jar and smears on the dry skin of her hips. He rubs it in into the stretched skin. She hadn’t really how horny she was until she felt his touch on her skin. He starts to rub moisturizer across her belly and hips, his hand sneaking up under her breasts. She rests her weight back on her arms, outstretched behind her, and tips her head back in enjoyment.
“You don’t have to pretend,” he mutters. She gently shakes her head and kisses him again. He’s a little hesitant but soon falls into the kiss, pressing his body against her.
“Best get to it, it’s getting dark,” she says, standing back up with a slight groan. Everything was a bit more of a struggle in the last two weeks. Her back a little more aching, her belly strained recently, her face a little more bloated.
“I certainly have felt some attraction to you,” he mutters, still not looking her. She stands up and walks up to him.
“Am I dead?” she hazily asks. The scene was too perfect. Cas, looking as gorgeous as the day she tried to stab him, and their perfect son together in their bedroom.
“Deanna!” Jack cries. Her body is paralyzed, her limbs unable to move, her eyes unable to stay open. She never had a chance to thank Rowena, apologize to Jack, tell Sam she loved him. Cas wasn’t here to hold her and tell her it was going to be okay, he would never live with himself and she needed him to know he was forgiven.
“Yeah,” she smiles. It was still a strange thought, after all those years, that she was going to have a child with a former angel she had once tried to stab. All those late periods, gas and sip bathroom pregnancy tests and serious injuries.
“She is happy,” he tells Sam. Maybe she had spent too much time obsessed with her miracle baby, a child she thought she would never be able to have. Maybe he thought she’d be happier without him.
Jack helps her to her feet, and she has to admit the new position makes her feel a bit better. Jack helps her up to the medical room, she leans on him the whole way and has to stop once to work through a contraction.
“Typical Winchesters,” she hears Cas say, she’d know that voice anywhere. She can’t move, can’t open her eyes.
She doesn’t sleep but it gives her more time to spend with Cas. She realises that she had been entirely in love with him the last decade or so. She only wishes she had done this early (the fucking and the talking, not the knocking up).
“So, my son opened up a door to an alternate universe where we have dicks?” Deanna says. Dean winces at her talking about having a son. She was so comfortable in motherhood, so protective and strong with the small child.
“What good are you!” she screams. “Do something! Do something good! ” She screams. She’s pulling at his jacket in desperation, tears rolling down her eyes. She beats his chest, screaming at him to save her child. He lets her hit him, taking each pounding and insult.
“Carefully,” he reminds her. Her fingers are clenched around the bedsheets, her body struggling from every new sensation.
“Go to bed, you look tired,” he tells her. She rests her head on his shoulder and looks knowingly at Dean.
“Hello?” he hears Sam voice echo through their modest apartment. They didn’t want for a big house, they had each other and that was the home Dean had been looking for all those years. Sam’s voice, unheard for so long to Dean, sounds like it automatically belongs in the space.
They make love side by side, her leg hooked over his hip. What would happen once their time ran out? Would they just kill them both or would he do the job himself? They make love like it was their last time together, the clock ticking over their heads. She gasps out her love for him, clawing at his back, a weighted lifted off her chest with those three words.
“I drunk, I hunted, I didn’t sleep, I ate crap,” she lists. A huge stabbing pain hits her and she grabs out for his hand. Embarrassed, she quickly pulls away from his touch, but he takes her hand back and places it on his lap. He uses this touch to ease some of her pain.
She feels pretty under his gaze, she always had. She had felt worthless most of her life, sexy and fuckable, but never pretty. She was the hot woman you’d fuck in a bar, the dangerous bisexual you have car sex with, she was never pretty, she was never valued. Then Cas came along and told her she was worth saving. Looked at her like she was the most perfect woman alive. Made her feel like she mattered.
“He’s an angel,” she asks, leaning forwards with bright eyes. “My Cas gave up his grace a year or so ago. He wanted to keep Jack and I safe. So how long have you and Cas been a thing?”
“The baby is head down now. Shall we move you back to squatting?” She ignores the last part of her sentence, parts her legs and starts pushing. It feels good to let her body finally do what it was meant to. Rowena holds her knee and lets Deanna push her right foot against her as leverage. She feels a gush water and her second child smoothly slides out in one push. She lies back in relief as she hears little cries and splutters.
“She’s almost here,” he whispers. He strokes the child’s chest, feeling the strong heartbeat under the impossibly tiny ribs.
Jack and her son disappear out of sight and Cas’ lips are suddenly on her head. He’s kissing her forehead and gripping her hand, “We have to deliver the placenta,” he says in an unnervingly calm voice.
“It’s okay,” he reassures with a low voice. She doesn’t reply, instead, she turns her face away from him and moans into the pillow.
She doesn’t know what to do, so she carries on life as normal, hoping nature will make the choice for her. She limits her junk food and booze intake, scared it would make her put weight on quicker. The hunts aren’t any easier, the drives no less longer. She doesn’t feel different, she doesn’t look different, she just hates the smell garlic and onions.
Dean goes to bed before her most nights, he’s getting old she’ll joke. She’s still not used to sleeping, the concept of falling asleep and never knowing if you were going to wake up was still disconcerting for her. She reads in the library, still unable to take her mind off the birth of Sam and Eileen’s child. It was so primal, so raw, so beautiful. She rubs her empty belly and thinks what it would feel like to birth Dean’s child. Would he help deliver his child or would he freak out in the chair beside her?
It was supposed to be a milk run. Pick up some goods, get out the bunker for a few hours and go home before Cas noticed she was out. She didn’t feel great, she hadn’t for a good seven months. Her joints felt painful, her pelvis heavy and she was permanently nauseous. She hated the way people watched her waddle around Walmart, staring at her compact yet heavy bump, asking to touch it. To start with she loved her little bump, it took a while to pop, but once she stopped looking like she’d eaten a big dinner she found her belly quite sexy. She loved rubbing it, loved when Cas rubbed it more and then all the other pains and pressure started.
“What do you see?” She asks, through gritted teeth. What could he say? He was scared seeing the pussy he spent years thinking about, touching, kissing stretch would revolt him. Instead, it was amazing. She was strong, he knew that already, she rebelled and protected him. Now her body was stretching open to help their child into this harsh world. He thought she would be screaming in pain, but she is calmly grunting.
“I’m sorry,” he says when she finally falls into his arms. He awkwardly wraps his arms around her and pats her back. “I’ll get Sam.”
“She was dead and I wanted Jack to spend some time with his mother, even if she wasn’t with us anymore. I placed him on her chest, and he brought her back to life,” Sammy explains, her voice quivering.
“Are you calling me a slut?” She laughs before kissing him deeply. “It was perfect,” She lays naked in his arms, drifting and out of sleep. She feels him trace patterns in her back, symbols in Enochian and strokes her golden streaked hair. “What happens if you’re firing blanks. We stay in here forever?”
She picks up the child and hushes him, bouncing him slightly on her hip. She takes a step back into the crack of light. Dean’s gun stays pointed at the crack, waiting for it close again but it doesn’t.
“It’s good,” She leads him towards the bed, where they sit awkwardly. She feels fourteen again, waiting for a boy to unpick her bra. “They are watching us.”
She looks at the pale pink line on the pregnancy stick. She’s been looking at it for five minutes. It won’t change the result. She buries her face into the wheel and screams. There is no one around in the parking lot. It’s 2 AM, why should they be there. She screams until her throat hurts. She hits the wheel until her hands hurts.
She’s never been gladder to have Sam around, Cas still MIA. She is too tired to function, too sore to move, too sad to care. He puts together a diet that helps with her constant morning sickness, puts together an exercise plan she mostly ignores and starts to buy all the boring stuff they need.
The lay naked and entwined, kissing gently and apologising for all their mistakes. She falls asleep again, the bed more comfortable then any she had ever slept in before. When she wakes up once more, he has fully dressed again and seeking an escape route once more. She dresses slowly and notices he won’t make eye contact with her.
“Let’s go,” she interrupts. She acquires a boring chevy, letting Jack sit upfront and forcing Cas into the back. Jack flits through radio channels and chats like her world isn’t ending.
She has to finally say goodbye to her wardrobe and results to wearing ugly dresses. She was so uncomfortable and warm, she didn’t care how she looked. Jack tells her he looks pretty and she starts to feel more like a mother, starts to look like her own mother. Sam buys her a pregnancy belt to help hold up her huge belly, she has to never been so thankful for a piece of Velcro across her body.
“Man, if I could fuck my wait out of every case,” she laughs. Her laugh dies when she sees how solemn Cas looks. “It’s okay, rather you than him.”
“Some chick with a kid,” Sam’s brows furrow in confusion. The kid appears again, his little legs surprisingly quick. He looks around the bunker with a familiarity and bundles up the stairs. Sam waves his hands at Dean, telling him to lower his weapon. “It’s a trap,” Dean hisses.
“Cas,” he says, taking her in his arms. “It’s going to be okay. We got this.” He gently kisses her, softly rubbing her belly. She wants to respond but can’t. She sinks into a squat position, grunting in pain. He has to hold her up, waiting for the contraction to finish. He gets her onto the bed, throwing the towels haphazardly under her. He fluffs up pillows, trying to get her comfortable.
“I’m not going to fuck you Cas,” she half-jokes, attempting to smile. “We can’t just replace her like a car art.”
“No. I trust your choices. I always have. I’m here. I won’t let anything happen to you.” Blame the hormones but she leans over and wraps her arms around her brother.
“I don’t really care right now.” Rowena helps her lie onto her back, despite really not wanting to get back into that position. Her panties have come off, leaving her in nothing but a big plaid shirt. She thinks she can feel fingers insider her but it’s hard to tell where one pain ends, and another starts.
She grabs a beer from the fridge and takes a seat outside the motel, on the little porch by the door. “You shouldn’t stalk women in the dark,” she tells the shadowy figure in the trench coat to her left.
“I don’t feel it,” he replies, before yawning. He had slept in his car last night, his neck still sore and his knees creaking. He takes off his towel, comfortable no one was going to walk in, and uses it to dry his hair. She sits up, still agile, and perches at the end of the bed. She groans a little and grips her thighs. She makes a gesture for him to come to her, parting her legs for him. Her panties don’t quite fit her anymore, but it’s not like she could shop in the maternity section of the mall. He could see the outline of her lips, the tuff of dark hair peering out from the top.
He kisses her neck, strokes her hair, rubs her belly. He feels useless, unable to ease her pain. He feels her clammy back, sweat dripping down it. She takes his hand and places it on her belly, indicating the gentle touches she needs over the tight contracting area. Her head lolls back onto his shoulder as she moans in pain.
Her ninth week is her hardest. She vomits so much she actually starts to lose weight. At one point she takes a bowl into her bedroom because the runs to the bathroom were getting too much. None of Sam’s remedies work, in fact, they make her sicker. She won’t go to the doctors, there is a target on her head from both angels and demons, and probably all the other creatures in the shadows. She knows she can’t leave this bunker until her baby is born, she knows she will never go outside again because she is aware she will not survive the birth.
Finally, Sandalphon reappears, still wearing that godawful white suit. “Well Castiel, I didn’t think I had it in you.” He stares at the floor and then suddenly a flash of light appears. Two fingers touch her head, and she falls to the floor with a thud.
When she finally climbs into their bed, Dean is asleep on his back and snoring lightly. She strips down to her sexiest slip, all black lace and satin fabric. She slides into bed beside him and gently kisses his neck. He purrs in his sleep and she rubs up against his leg. His eyelids flutter as he wakes up, tangling his fingers in her long, dark hair.
She grips at the seat as she follows her body’s instincts to push. She’s making deep guttural noises she has heard no human make before. She tries to pant and not push but her body has other ideas. Suddenly the baby’s head is burning through her, splitting her pelvis apart, and she screams. Her baby slides out of her violently with a rush of blood and water. He lies in a puddle of fluids on the leather of the seat and she stares at him in shock. No slow crowning and stretching like Cas has been telling her about for the last six months. No hours of labor and hypnobirthing tapes. He makes a spluttering sound and opens up his eyes, bright blue eyes like his daddy.
“I don’t think they are bad,” Jack says. She had forgotten he was even there, sat quietly watching it all unfold. He crouches in front of her. “I think you and Cas are good people. I don’t understand why anything you would create would be bad.”
“All the time,” he tells her. He thinks about her every second he can bare it. Thinks about her closed eyes, her tiny fingers, the silence in the room when she entered the world. He held her, wrapped up in the little blue blanket, and sobbed. There was he could do with his limited powers, she had died before she even had a chance in the cruel world. Deanna didn’t cry, she quickly had to look away, her hands shaking as she held Gia. “It’s okay to think about her, to miss her.”
“She isn’t real. She never lived, she never existed. Your daughter is a fantasy, an unhealthy fantasy.”
He is embarrassed to say he falls asleep, Cas in his arms. When he wakes up, he has no idea how long it has been. She’s not in bed with him. He stands up, getting dizzy and disorientated with the quick motion. She’s in the office. There is a blanket on the chair, a map laid out in front of her. She is leant over, wrists digging into the paper coated tabletop. “Cas,” he whispers. She gasps, her face scrunched up in concentration.
“Are you okay?” the mother asks. She didn’t realise she has been rubbing her belly and making faces, up their driveway.
“I will make the bed for Sam.” Cas disappears into their spare room leaving Dean to worry once more. Cas doesn’t make eye contact when he enters the room. He cuddles up behind the angel, nuzzling into his neck.
An hour or so later a swish of chiffon and red curls bounces into her room. “My, you have been busy,” a Scottish lilt says.
Deanna sinks to her knees, feeling sick the stomach and like she could sleep for a thousand years. He saw the good in Jack, even when they couldn’t, he died for Jack. Now he couldn’t even accept their own child may be good. It seemed so alien that they could have made something good. He walks away, not even looking back at her crumpled body. She lets out a scream and hits the tiled floor with her palms.
“Cas,” he repeats. He slowly crouches next to the chair. She was completely naked, her legs parted on top of the blanket.
“Yeah, I always primal scream in joy.” She can’t help but laugh bitterly. She laughs so hard she’s worried she won’t be able to stop.
Sam is a lifesaver those early weeks. Giving her antacid when her heartburn keeps her awake, buys her fibre rich food and doesn’t wake her up when she falls asleep on the couch. He takes Jack on hunts and leaves her to rest.
“Ask Cas,” she grumbles. She spends the next few days asleep in her room, Sam gives her the space she needs. She presumes Cas has explained the situation to him.
“Dean,” he says with a low voice. Dean throws the rag over his shoulder and follows Cas do the little office. Charlie wolf whistles and he hears Ash make a lewd comment from the table in the corner as he leaves.
All he can do it grip her hand and listen to the wind howling outside. He sees the trees swaying in the gale, can hear the creaking of nature as it’s forcefully beaten by the elements. He’s thankful the log pile has been left high, the fire the only comfort they had asides from each other.
“I want to be with you,” she murmurs. She rearranges herself so she is in his direct eye-line. She cups his face in her hands, admiring his strong jawline. “But I, I can’t stop thinking about it. The blood, the pain-. The idea of being close to someone again, to fuck, to even consider having enough. I can’t,”
“I fucked up,” she murmurs. She loses consciousness around then, the smell of blood lingering in her nostrils. She feels strong arms pick her up, a hand pulling at the bundle of slick clothing between her legs.  Sam is laying her out on the cool, clean back seat. She recognizes those strong, long arms. It feels good to stretch out her legs, but her arms feel empty without her son in them. A soft hand touches her hip, grace runs through her body, heating up her pelvis. She remembers the first time Cas healed her, the first time she felt his grace running through her body.
“I need to push,” she gasps. The pressure is unbearable against her, she grips onto the seat and grits her teeth in pain.
She grabs his hand and squeezes it. She leans in and kisses him gently. “Only if you promise to never leave me again.”
She hides in the bathroom. She had known that was the point of the exercise, but she had presumed it wouldn’t work. She was pretty sure a couple that had been killed as much as they had shouldn’t have the working parts to create a little life.
“It can get chilly in here,” he defends himself. She strokes her daughter’s rosy cheeks and her heart fills with love seeing those familiar blue eyes look up at her. “We’re going to have to move soon, we’re too near the lake.”
“Stay.” His arms unwrap from around her, and she feels his body tensing up. She thinks he’s about to flap off to wherever he flaps off to, but he doesn’t move.
“I thought you were getting an abortion,” Jack says with a frown as she gets back to the bunker. He looks so much like Cas, she can’t look at him.
“We won’t forget her,” he whispers, stroking her hair our of her face. Won’t forget the way Deanna squeezed his hand with the contractions, won’t forget the panic in her eyes when her water broke 13 weeks too early, won’t forget the shame as they left the hospital without their child.
“Angels,” he grunts. She stands up with wobbly legs trying to remember how she got there. She and Cas were investigating a haunting, EMF was over the roof and then something wraps its hands around her mouth.
He leans towards her and places his hand under her shirt, strong hands on her toned belly. She feels a jolt run through her body, a warm ball of energy sitting under her ribcage. He squints in confusion, his hand pressing firmer against her body.
Deanna opens her mouth, but Sam interrupts her, “Thank you,” he says with a polite smile. She seethes on her way to the room. “Chill,” he says. She sits down and pouts, almost feeling the steam coming off her body.
“A child we made because they were going to rape you. They were going to use your body to create a weapon they could exploit. You are my weakness, Deanna, they know that. You can not carry this child. It will kill you, it will kill all of us.”
He sits down beside her on the floor. He leans in and kisses her passionately. They called it a purgatory kiss. When you’re scared to say everything you want to say, scared you’re going to lose each other.
After that day, she buys prenatal vitamins, stops drinking alcohol and tries to not get punched in the middle during hunts. She'll tell Sam soon. Maybe when she starts to show (which she doesn't yet, she looks exactly the same).
Sam has to be with her, has to drive her home, has to pick up her corpse if her half breed child decides to kill her early. She stares at the posters, watches the pregnant bellies, sees the happy couples. Why couldn’t she have that?
She stands up straight and turns to look at Cas. She squeezes his shoulder before she gets into her car. She’ll never talk about what happened those days ever again. She’ll think about him all the time. She’ll see his face in every kid she’ll ever meet. She’ll dream about him. She’ll sometimes let her mind drift away in the shower to the toddler she would have had. Cas never forgets, she sees it in his eyes.
“Hey, I said I’d give you a baby. I didn’t say how or where.” He slides his briefs down and lifts her slip up. They make love on their floor, their bodies entirely entwined. His arms holding her off the floor, her legs around his waist. She had always loved feeling him shudder in ecstasy above her, but now it came with a feeling of hope.
“You said ‘maybe we should have a baby.’ Like, in the same way, I say that I’ll maybe diet and you’ll maybe cut your hair.”
He remembers her waking up with sharp pains, the scrunched-up face and the curled toes. He thought their child would be there that day. The pains faded and she goes back to sleep, like nothing had happened. Three days later and it was much of the same.
“She’s right there,” he reassures her. It felt incredible to feel unborn life in his hands. She’s starting to push, he can see her bulging and changing from within as her cervix stretched open.
“I’m sorry, Deanna,” he says. He lays her flat on the bed and lays down next to her. “I was looking for a solution.”
Sam jumps up and crouches up beside her, his hand on her knee. “You okay?” he asks. She nods tearfully, her hormones overtaking all her emotions. “You need to take it easy,” he reminds her. “You’ve looked after me my whole life and you’re going to look after this kid for its whole life. But for now, I need you to look after yourself and let me help.”
“Not married,” she mutters. Not sure which continent the baby’s father is, not sure if he’s ever coming home, more like.
“I know,” Cas wants to take Stephanie out of her arms, but she won’t let her go, “I know I died on a rebar, I know Mom, Dad, Ellen, Jo, Bobby, they are all dead. Cas is the most alive out of us all.”
“Wouldn’t be the first time I’ve done the dirty on camera,” she says with a wink. She leans forward and they kiss again, this time their tongues blending together. He’s a good kisser, forceful and surprisingly rough. She’s pulling at his trench, desperate to see what is underneath that coat. She kisses down his neck, around that jawline, sucking at his earlobe.
“Deanna!” he sternly tells her. “I know this hurts, but you have to do this.” She grips onto her legs, one of them using Cas’ shoulder as a stirrup. He feels the shoulder under his hand again, it’s close to clearing the pubic bone. They push together but he can sense her strength is weakening. The child is wiggling inside her, slowing moving down her widening birth canal. He leans over and cups her face, letting a jolt of celestial strength coarse through her. He hadn’t used it earlier in fear of slowly her contractions down, but now they were getting desperate.
“Park somewhere safe and stay there until we get there. I’m going to call 911.” She tries to describe her location to him, but she realises that she’s sobbing she hard down the phone he can barely understand her words. She can hear him rushing around, shouting to Sam and Jack, and dropping things around the bunker. She leans in and sobs against the steering wheel, wave after wave of pain running through her body. There is barely any time to breathe between contractions.
“All the time,” she laughs. “I’ve started having these, um, pains in my belly. Ligament something. It’s weird.”
“You don’t need to,” she says, quickly. “Not here,” she adds softly. Their daughter gurgles in her father’s arms, slowly waking up. “Has daddy wrapped you up like a burrito?”
“I am not a...'dude',” he responds with a head tilt. “I would like to be there when you bury your son.” She knows it’s too small to have a gender, too small to be another but a cluster of cells, but she appreciates him playing along.
She would rather die with him by her side, that alone with the possibility he’d find some way of bringing her back.
“They would have been born today; we should have a little girl here. We should have some fucking apple pie life and a yard, a little yellow nursery and not a plot of land with her ashes in.”
“I thought you were dead,” she says, shedding a tear. “He wasn’t hurt, wasn’t he?” He’s smaller than she could ever imagine, with big blue eyes and dark hair. He already looks like his dad with his furrowed brow and full lips.
She can’t look at him. She knows they did this together, deep down she knows. It’s not his fault. Every time she looks at him, she can see him writing her death sentence.
“Yes, you can,” she says, gripping Deanna’s shaking knee. “We’ve got this strapping lad to help you.”
“Go fuck yourself,” she replies with a curled lip. He uses all his force to pin Deanna up against the wall. One hand pressed against her neck, the other trails its way down her body to rest on the button at the waistband of her jeans.
“I’m testing to see if this pregnancy thing will stick.” Her body is healed and new, she knows that Cas did that, every scratch and scar gone. There is no reason her body can’t carry her child, the only reason it can’t is her own stupidity.
“It’s okay,” she murmurs into his messy bed hair as he looks at her concerned. The pains are minimal but different from the Braxton Hicks she had been complaining about the last month. Unlike her previous pains, they don’t stop. They change intensity and frequency, but no cold glasses of water are going to help.
“Making a baby,” she whispers. She doesn’t mean to say those exact words, but the topic is at the forefront of her mind. She leans ups and kisses him forcefully, feeling the way his hands were exploring her body.
She hears the phone buzz on the table. She doesn’t bother looking at the caller ID, presuming it to be Sam.
“I believe,” he replies, turning on his side to face her, “that Jack is good, we made him good. Our child will not be as powerful as Jack, they will not be as strong, but they will be good.”
“You know we could find another way?” Sam asks, having been mostly silent on the drive and wait. “There has to be a way you have this baby and don’t die. Cas isn’t as powerful as Lucifer. It’s different.”
“They are alive,” he tells her. She lets out the breath she had been holding in. She leans her head against Cas’ shoulder in relief and she feels him stiffen under her touch.
“Oh God… oh God, oh God, oh God…” she begs, clenching her body. Her legs are quaking with involuntary strains, gasp in the attempt to catch a breath. A dark, red stain seeps across the crotch of her jeans. He can feel his heart pounding in his throat.
The final contraction finally hits, her hips bucking as the rest of her daughter’s body leaves Deanna. The child is led on the bed, wiggling in a stick pool of pink-tinged fluid and dried blood. Deanna’s belly sinks, deflating like a popped balloon. The baby stares up at Cas and starts wailing.
“It is safe,” Cas says, getting up from the bed and standing behind her. She turns around and sees him holding a little blue tin, the type businesses kept petty cash in. She touches the smooth and cold metal coffin Cas has no doubt stolen from the motel to place her miscarriage in.
He finds himself stroking her legs in an effort to comfort her. Her lips are swollen, as her daughter prepares to crown. “You’re doing so well,” he says. He can see a round teardrop where her child is starting to emerge. She lets out a long, sharp breath, trying to relax around the new sensations.
“I hope mine is as cute as yours,” Deanna whispers. She gets a sharp pang in response. A typical Winchester, couldn’t take any form of a compliment. She wakes up the little girl who tells her where she lives.
When he enters her it feels right. She had forgotten what it felt like to have sex with someone you have feelings for. It was so wholesome and pure. They entwine their limbs together and nuzzle at each other’s cheeks. It takes a few strokes for him to find a rhythm, but they fall perfectly in sync. He doesn’t last as long as they both would have liked. He rests his head against and mutters, “I love you.” She smiles and kisses him back.
“I understand” he replies. “Let me ease the pain a bit.” She nods and lets him place his hand on her empty stomach. The warmth of his grace eases the cramps and nearly eliminates the back pain. He sits down on the floor beside her and she slowly finds herself leaning into him. His body is oddly room temperature, neither too warm nor too cold. He smells like an ocean breeze, with a hint of Pantene shampoo.
He lets her sleep on his chest, his firm broad chest the perfect pillow. He wraps his arms around her and it reminds her of purgatory. She shouldn’t feel safe in his arms, but she does. When she wakes up, no idea how many hours had passed, he is still led beside her. “So, it’s done?” she tiredly asks, holding back a yawn.
“That I’m happy? That for once in my life I actually did something for me, instead of for you, or for a case, or to try to stop the world ending!”
“We ran out of pie. I’m pregnant, not on house arrest. Ow!” she clutches her belly at the sharp pain. Ignoring it, she turns the ignition keys and starts to drive to the bunker.
The second time she sees blood, she’s in a motel and Sam has gone to buy groceries. The stain is bright red and violent. “No, hey, I change my mind, I do want you,” she gasps. She places her hand on her still flat belly, “I take it back, I’m sorry, I want you. Stay.”
“Get it out of me,” she begs. This delivery has to go okay. They have nothing but a basic first aid kit. No pain medication, no stitches, just some gauze and band-aids. He reaches the taunt area between her vagina and her anus and massages it. She cries out in pain as he tries to ease at their child. It’s no longer about lust or sex, he just had to safely deliver her child. They’d worry about the awkwardness tomorrow.
