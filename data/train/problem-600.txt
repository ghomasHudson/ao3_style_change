As he let the real world fall away, he found himself in his Mind Palace, the scattered debris of unwanted memories all around him. As he turned to take everything in, something fluttered just at the edge of his vision… something new, no, something old. Try as he might, he couldn’t catch sight of it. He traversed the hallways in his mind, trying to leave the disturbance behind. Finding himself at the door of John’s room, he entered and closed the door behind him. The memories and fluttering shadows were locked safely out and he breathed a sigh of relief as he slid down the door and sat there, shaking.
“Where are we headed,” Greg asked. When the paramedic told him, he breathed easier. They were going to the hospital where John had been taken.
The detective figured it out before John did. “What did you do?”
“Maybe...” John started, then shook his head. “Never mind.”
“Mycroft, sir, please,” Greg said softly, taking his Dom’s hand. He hated it when Mycroft got like this.
Mary patted his arm, then went to get the champagne.
This chapter is rather light as it is a transition chapter. John will let his Dominate side show more in upcoming chapters.
Over the next several days, weeks, and months, Sherlock improved. He saw his psychiatrist at regular periods and actually listened to him. True to his word, he did nothing that truly alarmed John.
John's smile turned soft. “Oh, Sherlock.”
The sub’s back arched and he cried out as he came over John’s hand in great spurts. The Dom stroked Sherlock through his orgasm, uttering praise as he did so. “Amazing. Gorgeous. Jesus, but you're beautiful like this.”
Feeling ill, the doctor asked, “When were you going to tell me?”
The sight that met John's eyes caused his breath to catch. The detective was knelt in the middle of a small dungeon. There were various implements hanging on the walls and a table covered with toys.
The flat is testament to that:
Ella knew how much Sherlock meant to John despite him never having actually vocalised it. She gave him time to gather himself together, before speaking. "That's a lot to handle. How are you holding up?"
Sherlock didn't want to wait and see what John would say next. He started climbing out from between the two of them, but they were having none of it. John and Mary piled on top of him.
The detective hummed in contentment. He couldn’t move more than a few inches in any direction. It made him feel securely at his Dom's mercy.
Striding onto the crime scene, energized and confident. Crouched over a body, noticing the minutiae that others fail to observe. The whole of the mystery unfurling before your intellect.
“He’s hurting and worried. Not a pleasant combination,” Mycroft said. He allowed his fingers to brush Greg's briefly. It was the only physical show of affection he would permit himself in public.
“You two are spoiling me,” the former assassin said, stretching luxuriously.
I call you extraordinary.
Beautiful lips.
The Dom started reading what Sherlock had put down. Most of it was fairly standard. He’d marked his hard and soft limits and marked some punishments as unacceptable. John doubted those punishments would have worked on Sherlock anyway. There were several scribbled notes, most of which surrounded casework. His words protected his right to take cases as and when he chose and above all other considerations.
“It’s not really any of your concern.” Sherlock pulled his legs up on the bed and lay down, closing his eyes. He didn’t care about John’s anger. He knew he would later, but right now it didn’t matter. “Go away.”
The doctor followed the smell of coffee. “Sherlock?” he called, not finding him in the living room. He went to pour himself a cup of coffee and found the note.
The detective leapt to his feet. "I don't need a Dom to run my life. I'm perfectly capable of taking care of myself."
The cabbie, who was unharmed, had already called 999 and an ambulance was on the way.
The last sentence rang throughout the flat. Mrs. Hudson would have heard it if she had been home. Thankfully, she was out.
Sherlock bounded for the door, jerking it open. Halfway through, he paused and looked back at the Dom. After a moment of consideration, he approached him. “You’re a doctor. In fact you’re an Army doctor.”
Standing, the detective moved this way and that, bending at the waist and standing straight again. “It feel fine, sir. Comfortable.”
, rather take another forty blows.
"Sherlock..." he squeaked.
Eventually, Rosie roused and insisted on being fed. After that, she was content to play by herself for a bit.
In the cab, John casually reached over and cupped Sherlock’s bollocks. He played with them for at bit, enjoying the pink flush that tinged his boy's cheeks. “I’m proud of you. You did everything I asked of you.” He dragged his palm along the length of Sherlock’s growing erection.
Lestrade looked around the bullpen, his gaze stern. "Get back to work. There's nothing to see here." To John and Sherlock, he said, "Come on, let's get to my office." He led the way, trusting in the doctor's protective instincts to drive him to get Sherlock behind a closed door. John did just as the DI had hoped and guided Sherlock to Greg's office. The moment they all entered, the DI closed the door and adjusted the blinds so no one could see in. "You don't have to say anything, John. I'll make sure she's off my team. That was the final nail in the coffin." Greg turned around to see the doctor standing beside Sherlock, holding his hand. He had to look away from the sight, it touched him so much. Without another word, he went and sat in his chair, moving papers around, giving them whatever time they needed.
John placed his hand on Sherlock's shoulder. To his surprise, the detective turned to him and rested his head on John's shoulder. Slowly and oh so carefully, he wrapped his arms around Sherlock. They stood there a long time, not talking, just being.
"And if it did, you wouldn't admit it." Mycroft sipped at the tea he had made. "Go back to MatchDs. Find a Dom. There's one interested in you. If you don't, I shall be forced to take matters into my own hands"
Try as he might, Sherlock simply couldn’t think of anything he had said that had been out of order. The harder he thought, the more he let his arms droop and the more John was forced to remind him to hold his position.
“You would be right,” the doctor said, crossing his arms.
John regarded him. His boy looked horribly dejected. “Come up here.”
Now I move with energy, chasing you from rooftop to rooftop.
John knew his boy liked a little pain with his pleasure, so with his free hand, he slapped Sherlock’s arse. Next, he moved his hand lower and slapped his boy’s bollocks, eliciting a grunt of surprise. He kept slapping them, enjoying the sounds Sherlock made.
Rosie wasn't happy about being left out and tugged on Sherlock's trousers. He smiled down at her and picked her up, then went to sit on the sofa with her on his lap. He pulled out his phone and handed it to her to keep her entertained for a bit. She promptly stuck it in her mouth. "So, when do we get started?" he asked, not shyly, but a bit nervously. He still thought he could perform as required so long as John was in the room, but the prospect was unnerving.
"And yoooou want to do it again?" John asked, his mouth breaking into a huge grin.
“But I need data!” the detective complained.
The three of them, Sherlock, John, and Mary, all headed into the bedroom. Rosie had already been tucked into bed. Together, the men gently undressed Mary. John kissed along her shoulder, then up her neck as the detective stripped. Once Sherlock was completely nude, he wrapped his arms around Mary from the back. The doctor took that as a cue to get undressed. Together, John and Sherlock led the former assassin to the bed where they all piled on it together. Mary tried to move to let the men lay next to each other, but they wouldn’t have it.
“Yeah.”
“No, you're not,” John countered. He cupped one of her breasts, kissed her. He continued to make love to her whilst Sherlock held her, taking delight in her pleasure.
“Yes, sir,” Sherlock said, passing the Dom the contract and the pen.
Running the shower, he stepped under its stream. He let the water wash the grime and chill from his body. He knew he owed John more of an explanation. As he dressed, he considered what he would say.
John wrapped and arm around Sherlock's shoulders. "Hey, it's alright." He rocked his lover slowly. "Mary and I have considered that possibility. Doctor. Nurse. Remember? When we thought you might be willing to be the father, but wouldn't want to have sex with Mary, we investigated fertility clinics. We asked about this very thing as well. Any one of them can test your sperm. If there's a problem, we move to plan B and use artificial insemination. There are things they can do to increase the odds in the event there's a problem. It doesn't have to mean the plan is a no go, love."
“Move, babe,” the doctor said, shifting his hips.
His thoughts were racing, and try as he might, he couldn’t make them stop. He closed his eyes and practiced his breathing exercises. They helped, but only marginally.
John shrugged. He didn’t see what Sherlock saw, so he sympathised with Lestrade. “Don’t be a git, Sherlock. Walk us through it.”
“Bloody Mycroft. Why did he have to kill him? It’s not fair.” Sherlock tugged at his curls in frustration.
“I need an assistant,” the sub growled.
When the doctor withdrew his fingers, Sherlock moaned his displeasure. His moans soon changed in tone when John thrust his cock in in one smooth, quick thrust. It felt good. It filled him in the most delightful way. Each thrust rocked his body roughly. He felt wonderfully used.
I find myself falling apart, quaking like my beloved.
“Your report on Sherlock and John from earlier today. It looks like I won't have to worry about my brother.” The Dom nipped at Greg's earlobe. “That means I can concentrate more time on you, pet.”
John expected an outburst from his friend, but it wasn’t forthcoming. Instead, Sherlock pulled out his phone, called Doctor Dieter, and scheduled an emergency appointment.
Once done, he went into the bedroom and put on pyjamas and a dressing gown. Sherlock stepped out into the short hallway and went into the kitchen where he found John waiting, sitting at the table. There was tea and toast waiting for the detective.
John stroked Sherlock’s cock with a steady pace. As he worked him, he kissed the sub’s neck, biting down with measured pressure. Sherlock was so responsive, it was remarkable. If he was any judge…
My last two letters came back unopened. I expect the same of this one, but I hope I am wrong.
Sherlock shifted, but didn't uncurl from his protective position. His gaze was locked on John. The doctor looked tired, more tired than a shift at the clinic could account for, and the lines around his eyes and across his forehead were deeper. The guilt he had been feeling since his brother left trebled in intensity. "I'm sorry, John," he said, his voice rough.
"Mm, Sherlock?" Mary asked, whispering; John had fallen asleep. "You look too serious, love. Especially for the way I'm glowing. That was wonderful and I know John thought it was too." She moved her hand to cover her abdomen and rubbed it. "Maybe there's a new spark of life growing in here already."
“Well, that passed some time,” John commented. He sighed. “I wonder what is going on out there.”
“Because I'm the best there is,” he said, confidently.
John came, not worrying about Sherlock's pleasure. His hips stuttered to a halt as he filled his boy with his come. He collapsed on his boy's back, catching his breath. He’d see to Sherlock, who had yet to come, in a bit. He smiled. It was time to really take advantage of the new dungeon.
The doctor hesitated to say yes. If he did, Sherlock would see it as the worst sort of betrayal. “Not just yet, though it may come to it. Let me try talking some sense into him once I’ve had a chance to calm down a bit. But take this.” He handed the partially filled vial to Mycroft who took it.
Sherlock watched, mesmerised, as John fucked his own hand and came. His Dom was beautiful and captivating, driving him to distraction. It made his own bollocks heavy and they ached with need. He gave a moan and strained towards John who had collapsed on the bed in a post orgasmic haze.
“We love you. See you soon.” Hanging up John leant into Sherlock’s left side, being careful not to jostle his elbow. He closed his eyes, which earned him a jab in the side.
The Dom led Sherlock into the flat and locked that door as well, then guided him to the bedroom. He was amused at how pliable his boy was from just having his scalp stroked and his hair tugged. It just went to show how starved Sherlock was for the attentions of a Dom.
By the time John came home, Sherlock had calmed himself down somewhat. At least he wasn't rocking anymore. He sat on the sofa, curled into the smallest ball his injured leg would allow.
John rushed to Baker Street where he found the door to 221 unlocked. He rushed up the 17 steps to B and through the door. “Could be dangerous,” he said.
“You still don’t have permission, boy,” John warned, not pausing in his ministrations.
“Arm,” the detective hissed out, cradling his right arm against his chest.
“What does John think of the matter?” the government official asked.
“Yes. Do hurry, Mary. I need someone of your competence on this.” He paused. "I'll be there soon."
Sherlock wriggled his hand on the doctor's cock. John muttered some choice words and then gave in to it. “Alright.”
A whirlwind of deductions flew.
The urge to rut against the bed was almost overwhelming, but Sherlock managed to resist. He gave a start when he felt John's hand fall on his arse cheek and give it a squeeze.
It was just after one such case that things took a decided turn for the better. They entered the living room at 221B, giggling like madmen. Sherlock reached out for Jihn and bestowed a heated kiss on him. It had become such a regular occurrence that the doctor didn’t even hesitate to respond. It was what happened next that had him gasping in response and pulling away. Sherlock had reached down and cupped the doctor's cock through his trousers.
Sherlock was knelt, naked, in front of John who was sat in his favourite chair. John tapped Sherlock’s lips with his index finger and said, “Open.”
The DI glared at her. "Go home, Sally. We'll talk tomorrow."
Watching her go, Mycroft continued his conversation with Anthea. He was worried, but that was tempered by having Mary on the job. He only hoped she was still up to the challenge.
“I don’t care about other people,” Sherlock said vehemently, “I just care about you.”
Sherlock moved close to the doctor. “I don’t mind if I do.” He pressed his lips to John's in a deep kiss.
John recalls meeting Sherlock.
Looking around the dungeon, John's eyes fell on a fucking machine. He grinned wickedly, delighted at his find. After all, he didn’t want Sherlock to get bored whilst he explored the dungeon.
“How could I possibly be bored with Mary around. I have data to collect about her pregnancy. She and the baby change every single day.” Sherlock looked genuinely puzzled.
The government official smoothed out the paper and read it. He heaved a sigh, then thought for a moment. “This is what we’re going to do.”
Turning to look at him, the detective's mouth did something funny, and his eyebrows disappeared beneath his fringe. “I didn’t think you cared,” he said sardonically, hurting himself with his words.
John didn't berate the detective, just let out a sad sigh. "Come along to the kitchen. Lets get you patched up." He led the detective to the kitchen and encouraged him to sit, then he fetched his kit and sat next to him. "You know, if you want to practice boxing, I highly recommend gloves and a punching bag," he said as he picked glass out of Sherlock's knuckles.
You are my huggable consulting detective.
No sooner had Mary read the message, than her phone buzzed it her hand. It was a message from Mycroft, recalling her to the Diogenes.
“Is frustrated the word you wanted to use?” Ella asked calmly.
Just when he was about to go to bed, he heard Sherlock on the stairs. He stopped where he stood and turned towards the door. The sight that met him took his breath away.
The Dom tipped over the edge into orgasm at the cry of his name, shuddering through it. When he was done, he kissed Sherlock’s face all over: forehead, eyelids, nose, cheeks, lips. Then he collapsed in bed next to him, completely sated.
“As if I could separate you. He should be home soon.”
“No need. I see Mycroft has sent a car. We’ll be home soon.” John started for the car, gesturing Sherlock to go in front of him.
Lestrade allowed himself to fall behind and joined Mycroft who had been keeping John company. “How’s John?”
It wasn't easy, but they eventually worked through their issues. Life settled down into everyday domesticity punctuated by cases. At last, everything was more than a bit good.
The flat in his Mind Palace was just as he had left it. Inner John waited for him in his chair. Scuffling noises still came from beyond the flat doors, and he could hear the occasional call of ‘William.’ This time, he didn’t flee. Instead, he approached the door with caution. Placing a hand upon the doorknob, he braced himself, then flung open the door. It was oddly anticlimactic. Before him, a detritus of emotion littered the long hallway. It mostly took the form of photographs, but there also existed random sounds of struggle and the scent of sandalwood that were inextricably linked to his darkest memories and emotions.
"Of course, Mary and I are hoping you'll be more directly involved with the next baby." John used a little baby shampoo to wash his little girl's hair.
With a hand on the small of the detective’s back, the Dom guided Sherlock upstairs where he unlocked the door to the flat. He ushered the sub in and closed the door behind them.
Blinking several times, Sherlock tried to wrap his head around John's words. Finally, he spoke. “You. Love me?”
John laughed. “Yes.”
Sherlock let out a bitter laugh. “Obvious. I should have thought of it myself.” He needed to make his mind kick into gear. He was tired of his thoughts moving like molasses.
You are a good man. Dangerous? Yes, but never to me. You say I would be better off had we never met. I say I would be dead. Apply your deductive skills to the man I was when we first met and you will see it for yourself.
The doctor bit his lip and nodded. "Alright." He didn't like the idea that Sherlock was agreeing to see a psychiatrist for him, but at this point he'd accept whatever it took to get him to see one. "Ella gave me the names of several. Do you want to pick one or..."
"How am I holding up?" John asked with a bitter laugh. "I'm not the one who was raped, now, am I? I'm sitting back, watching him struggle without a fucking clue what I'm supposed to do to help. So, yeah, I'm fine."
From beyond the flat doors, there came scuffling noises and a call of ‘William.’ Immediately, Sherlock dashed to the main door and locked it, then locked the door in the kitchen. The sounds continued however.
“Yes it was.” Greg grinned at the government official. “Parts of it were quite interesting, actually. Why don’t you go ahead and ask what you really want to know? I know you’re dying to, sir.”
You are brilliant and snarky.
Have I embarrased you enough, Huggle Bum?
Sherlock gave a shudder at John's commanding tone, his lashes fluttering. He was all the way in the living room before he paused and turned back. “I printed out a standard contract. It has a list of hard and soft limits to choose from as well as punishments to be selected. It also had space to allow it to be tailored. Will that suffice in place of the paper?”
Taking his time, John stripped. He felt Sherlock’s eyes on him the entire time. When he removed his pants, Sherlock’s eyes went wide as they always did upon seeing his rather large cock.
He wouldn’t be deserting Sherlock to anything like that though, if he just gave his friend a few minutes on his own, just 15 minutes. He himself would have treasured that after he had been shot. Surely 15 minutes wasn’t too long for him to leave the flat. Besides, Mycroft had the place under surveillance. He could simply step out to Speedy's. That would work. He’d be close by if anything went amiss.
“But...”
The detective snapped his head around to look at John. “What did you say?”
“Good. Go arrest the cousin. She’ll have the ring.” Sherlock grasped John’s hand. “Take me home, sir,” he said, his voice dropping so that only his Dom could hear him. “Please.”
Sherlock uttered an emphatic ‘yes'.
It was Mary's turn to speak. "What idiot told you you have the face of a horse? I thought we had settled this particular insecurity a long time ago. Haven't you ever wondered why people throw themselves at you, both men and women?"
“It may feel that way to you, but you're not. Try this.” The psychiatrist placed one hand on his chest and one over his diaphragm. “Put your hands where I've got mine.”
John turned, pulling his knee up onto the sofa so he could face the detective. "First of all, you're not a burden, you're my best friend." And if they made it through this maybe something more. "Secondly, I can no more stop worrying about you than you could stop worrying about me if our roles were reversed. And finally, I'm not trying to 'fix' you. I just want to help you." It was frustrating to be having this conversation. How could Sherlock think himself a burden?
John grasped one of Sherlock’s ankles as he climbed onto the bed and pulled Sherlock’s leg straight. He settled himself between Sherlock’s legs and ran his hand along Sherlock’s thigh. “Tell me what you want, pet.”
"John, that tickled." Sherlock tried to cover his nipples, but his lovers were having none of that. They attacked him from both sides, making him squirm uncontrollably. Their jobs were clear: to repeat what they had just done, but with Sherlock getting the majority of the attention. It was time he learned what they could truly be together.
Outrageous is a word the world would apply to you, but not I my love.
John stepped in from the kitchen where he had been making a sandwich. “Leave him alone, Mycroft.”
“Um, Sherlock...” John began.
You are my sweetheart.
The detective licked his lips. “If I may, sir, I have a pair of handcuffs in my coat. I nicked them off Lestrade.”
“Yes. Yes.” Sherlock stood, facing the crime map on the wall, just as relieved by the change in subject. He found he didn’t feel alarmed looking at the case map despite what it represented. He was too buoyed by what had just transpired with John. “It’s a cold case from approximately 25 years ago.” He tapped one of the papers tacked to the wall. “Scott. An eight-year-old boy. He was... sexually assaulted by an unknown individual.” Now some of his anxiety started to creep back in, though he didn’t let it show.
In sleep, I look at you your face, relaxed and youthful looking. Dark lashes fan against your cheek. Soft pink lips part and I barely hear a sigh. I long to brush back your fringe and place a kiss to your forehead. I envy you’re perfect hand that cups your cheek.
“Oh, God,” John moaned. “No time. I have to get to work, you naughty tart. But you’ll certainly be seeing to me later today.” John was already planning what he was going to do to and with his boy.
“You’re Scott.”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes as he observed the doctor. "Don't be ridiculous. What happened has nothing to do with our plans. I'm still bored and we're still going to see Lestrade."
"Right. Of course we are." John didn't argue, but he felt a strong sense of foreboding. He just hoped he was wrong.
“Y- yes, sir,” the detective said with a moan. The dildo pumping in and out of him had him constantly on edge. It was almost impossible not to come. “But, please. I’m so close.”
When you jumped, yes, it nearly broke me, but you had good reasons for what you did. Instead of hitting you like that, I should have listened to you. I don't mean in the angry way that I did that night. I mean, I should have really listened. I don't know why you gave me another chance after that, but I am grateful you did.
John starter to object, but stopped. “You’re right. Of course, you are, but-“
John calmly walked over and took his sub by the elbow. Sherlock tried to shake him off, but his Dom wouldn’t have it.
for volunteering to beta read for me on this fic.
Sherlock felt restless, almost bored, even. He hadn’t felt like this in a long time. He went over to the cold cases Lestrade had left for him and pulled one out. He could at least work on it whilst he passed the time waiting on his appointment.
Instinctively, Sherlock drew his legs up, knees bent and spread wide apart in open entreaty. He wanted desperately to be taken then and there, but he knew John had other plans in mind.
“John Watson and this,” he gestured towards his friend, “is Sherlock Holmes.”
The doctor’s heart fell. “Well, fuck.”
"Of course not," Sherlock scoffed. "That would be impossible. I'll love them equally."
“Last night was... good.” Sherlock said, thinking about how they had slept in the same bed with pillows between them.
"Difficult... how?" John asked.
“John!”
“It’s like the breathing exercise. You need to practice it before it becomes truly effective. And anytime you feel a panic attack coming on, practice either of the techniques - the muscle exercise and if that doesn't work, move on to the breathing.”
“This is the best kidnapping ever,” John said his voice sounding groggy. Suddenly, he started giggling. “I can’t believe you just sucked me off in a storage container.”
“His PA actually. Anthea. At least, that’s what she called herself.” Mary sat back from the laptop and stretched. “I’m already having fun.” She rearranged a blanket on Rosie who was sleeping nearby. “The assignment is intriguing.”
I love being naughty with you.
“Good boy. Now don’t move.” With his unlubed hand, John unfastened the buckles that held his boy’s legs in place. “Bend your knees and spread your legs for me.”
Once they had finished eating, Sherlock sprung srom his chair and opened his text message from Lestrade. “Oh, John! It’s an eight at least.” He rushed into the living room and shrugged his coat on. The doctor was close behind, Mary on his heels.
“It matters to me!” the detective shouted, surprising even himself. In a calmer voice, he added, “I have a right to know.”
Finally, the Dom decided his boy had been stretched and teased enough. He removed his fingers from Sherlock’s entrance and lubed his cock. Lining himself up, he pushed into the detective's hole, burying himself to the hilt. After he bottomed out, he stilled, trying not to come immediately. When he had control of himself, he started to move.
I reach for you as you start to stir.
“Then call me Greg, please.” The DI turned towards the man in the suit. “This is Mycroft Holmes, my Dom.”
You do it headlong, never pausing, in a great rush.
The long expanse of your neck beckons to me.
John laughed."Of course." He climbed into bed. "It seemed far too quiet up here," the doctor commented. "It never occurred to me that you would have turned in so early."
“Impatient git.” The doctor spread Sherlock's arse cheeks, then licked a stripe from his perineum to his entrance.
John was uncertain what to do with a dropping sub that wasn't officially his. He thought he should get Sherlock into bed, then stay until he came out of it.
With nothing else to do, Mary went to her super secret Mycroft laptop and logged in. There were a few things she could research to fill her time until the boys got home. Oh, how she envied them their freedom. As soon as the baby was born, she’d find a way to be more directly included in their cases. She couldn’t wait.
You turn to me and smile.
Go to Mycroft?! I thought better of you than that, John. I would ask if you had gone mad, but obviously you have. My life is none of that pompous arse's business, now or ever.
The doctor held Sherlock until the shaking stopped. “Are you okay? Sorry. That’s a stupid question.”
A car slammed into the cab on Sherlock’s side. There was the sickening crunch of metal that covered the sound of a bone cracking.
Greg let his head fall back on his Dom's shoulder. “Oh, god, sir.”
The detective hummed an acknowledgement. He let himself sink into his mind palace, picturing John beside him. He started describing what he saw to his friend. “There is a long hallway. There is a door at the end of it. It’s locked. I can hear sounds coming from behind it. It sounds like a child sobbing.”
The DI let the paramedics take Sherlock and lay him out on the floor. They checked his vitals and responsiveness, soon arriving at the same conclusion as Greg.
After what seemed like an eternity, Joh head the familiar sound of Sherlock coming up the stairs. He quickly picked up his novel, not wanting to look like he had been waiting on the detective.
“Yes, sir. It did indeed.”
Sherlock wandered the streets of London, keeping out of sight of the CCTV network. He couldn't stand the idea of being watched.
Sherlock had lain down on his left side with his head in John's lap. He was being careful of his broken arm. “I'm bored,” he announced. “You never told me how boring abductions could be.”
Mycroft's words burned through Sherlock's apathy in a flash. He sat up and spun around to glare at his brother, spitting out, "No! I won't subject myself to some idiot digging around in my mind! And they'll want to drug me. You know they will. They always do. They'll want to slow my brain down until it feels like mush."
Your arms are kissable as are your wrists, your knuckles, your fingers, your palms.
Smiling, Mary tucked her phone away. She went and checked the fridge. There was the bottle of champagne that she remembered being there. The boys might want to celebrate. Since she knew she was pregnant, she would abstain. She put the wine on ice and got out two champagne glasses, leaving the lot in the kitchen, then she settled in the living room to wait.
The sub turned to look at John, clearly surprised. “Do you think so?”
“I refuse to take anything that would interfere with my mind. Drugs would merely slow me down. I require my mind to function at its fastest and best.” Sherlock let go of John’s hand and crossed his arms in front of him.
“I don’t understand,” John said. “You seem... different.”
John, crouched on the opposite side of Sherlock from Mary, placed his hand on Sherlock's other knee. "That's something we've both thought about and discussed. We have a couple of options open to us. We could go the route of artificial insemination of course, but if you think you can, um, function with Mary in the natural way, that's what we would prefer. I'd be there, of course to, um, lend a hand if needed."
“I would normally punish you for running off on your own like Greg said you did, but I think you have been through enough.”
The doctor clenched his left hand into a fist. “I’m not doing this.” He turned and slipped on his shoes and his coat. “I’m not your punching bag, Sherlock.” On his way out the door he paused. “I’ll come back. Get your head out of your arse before I do.”
John, however, heard the hurt in his voice. “Sherlock… I didn't think that would matter. You always say you don't feel things that way.”
"Piss off, Mycroft," Sherlock said, placing bow to violin strings and drawing out something that sounded like a dying cat.
Sherlock nodded firmly. "Alright, alright, I'll do it."
Huggable Hunk
A hundred times? A thousand ? A million?
Inside his mind palace, Sherlock straightened up. He wasn't going to wait, despite wanting to. The need to get the whole thing over with was paramount. He reached out and opened the door. In a flash, his memories poured forth. Had it not been for Inner John, he would have drowned beneath the onslaught. With one smooth motion, Inner John pulled Sherlock back from the door and closed it.
“Yes?”
“Please? Please, what?” John asked, amusement in his voice.
The case turned out to be boringly simple, bringing about a chastisement of Lestrade. “You told me this was a locked room murder. How could you be so stupid?”
I was captivated from the very first.
The detective rolled his eyes. “Yes, Mary.”
"You do it. Please." Sherlock's eyes looked so sad and vulnerable as he asked. He had made the decision, that should be enough. It wasn't fair to make him choose and schedule the appointment as well.
That thought made him think of his appointment with Doctor Dieter. It was in just a few hours. He slipped quietly from bed so as not to wake John and got ready for the day. When he was done, he went into the living room.
“Can't a brother call to chat?”
Sherlock turned his back on John and answered his phone. “Lestrade. There’s been a fourth suicide. And there’s something different this time. Where?”
Instead of pushing his boy away, he pulled him closer. “Yeah. That’s a much better use of your mouth, but you better enjoy it while you can, because you won’t like what I have planned for it when we get home.”
Sherlock whipped around as a hand fell on his shoulder, only to be brought face to face with Inner John.
Your nose is kissable as are your eyelids, your cheekbones, your temples, your lips.
Mary let out a long sigh. “I love being a mother, but I do get bored. I don’t want to go back to what I was. I just want to be useful, maybe make up for some things...” She shrugged, not wanting to follow that sentence to where it could lead. “Use my brain a bit.”
When they pulled up outside 221, John tugged on his boy’s hair. “It's time to go inside, pet. We’re home.”
The smiley face,
Pocketing the phones and the paper, Mary left the warehouse as cautiously as she had entered it. She expected an ambush, but one wasn't forthcoming. Some people would have relaxed at that point, but not the former assassin. She walked for several blocks, then caught a cab. The driver looked at her oddly because of her clothes. Most of her attention was on the paper which contained a letter, the rest was on the driver and their surroundings.
The detective gave her one of his rare, genuine smiles. “Of course he would. He wants you to be happy. And if he doesn’t want you to do it, what was it you told me once? I’ll talk him around.”
From the moment you rise in the morning to the moment you reluctantly allow sleep to overtake you, my eyes are drawn to you.
John laughed. “I wish I could get away with that. He just ignores me when I try. Actually, he gets all snippy with me.”
“Who did this?” the doctor asked.
“I refuse to be spanked here where I work,” Sherlock said defiantly.
“What? Oh, no, no. Please. Get yourselves some coffee and wait in the incident room,” Lestrade requested. “I'll be right there as soon as Mycroft and I finish up.”
Practically thrumming with excitement the sub asked, “What’s new about this one? You wouldn’t have phoned if there wasn’t something different.”
Never change for I love you as you are, my darling, my love.
Keeping a wary eye on the former assassin, the man fastened the handcuffs around his wrists.
“I haven’t taken any cases, sir.” He turned his head, causing John to pull on his hair. “I’ve had plenty of time.”
Lestrade sat next to Sherlock and pulled him into his lap. With one hand, he slapped his friend. It seemed cruel, but if the was sub-Shock like he feared, gentleness would only lead to Sherlock's death. “Sally! Call an ambulance. Tell them we have a sub in sub-Shock.”
The sub's hand froze on his cock and his head swivelled around towards the sound of John's voice. “Sir? You’re home.”
Inside his mind palace, Sherlock pushed against the door. It didn’t give even a fraction of an inch. Next, he threw himself bodily against it. “It won't move,” he told John, frustrated.
I need to apologise to you for so many things. I'll start with the easy one. I never should have called you a machine. The moment you acted like you didn't care about Mrs. Hudson, I should have known something was wrong. You care about her so much. I never should have doubted you.
Sherlock stuck out his tongue at his brother's retreating back. What did Mycroft know? He was a Dom. He didn't know what life was like for a sub. Sherlock absolutely refused to kneel for anyone.
Greg stood swiftly. "I'll give the two of you a few moments alone." He exited his office and closed the door behind him, then he stood there, arms crossed, standing guard.
Mycroft stepped up beside Sherlock's bed. “They will want to keep you together, of course. I am arranging to have you both moved to a double room.”
“Obviously,” Sherlock said with a shrug, then tucked into his food.
The doctor opened the door and entered. "I suppose you deduced it was me," he said with a grin.
Sherlock sat in his chair for once. It was the middle of the night and the lights were off. He had checked the locks on the doors half a dozen times, but he still couldn’t convince his brain that it was safe to sleep. He had spent the last 30 minutes practicing his breathing exercises and he had even tried the muscle relaxation techniques Doctor Dieter had recommended. Nothing was working though.
“No shit, John.” Sherlock breathed through the pain. He’d experienced worse pain before, but that didn’t make it a fun experience.
John wanted that more than anything. "If that's what you truly want, yes." At Sherlock’s smile and nod, the Dom rose from his chair and held out his hand. Sherlock took it and let himself be pulled to his feet. Immediately, John pulled him close for a kiss, tangling his fingers in the sub's curls and pulling.
Sometimes I see the old pain of being alone creep into your eyes.
You find me in my dreams and we become one.
“In addition to your breathing, I can see you're very tense. I want you to try to relax,” the psychiatrist requested.
“I don't want to,” Sherlock said.
"What the fuck happened?" John asked, reaching for his friend's bleeding hand.
You steal kisses in public.
Gingerly, John sat down on the edge of Sherlock’s bed. He left plenty of room between himself and Sherlock, not wanting him to feel crowded or cornered in any way. “Do you want to talk about it?”
Without a word, the government official sat in Sherlock’s chair. He didn’t look his usual pompous self, he looked tired and defeated. After several moments of silence, he spoke, “I feared it would come to this. I had hoped... Foolish of me, I know.”
Trigger warning: This chapter is where underage sexual abuse is first openly hinted at. If that's a problem, please don’t read this chapter. It's not explicit and I'll never depict it in a more explicit manner than is shown in this chapter.
Mary, who had been looking on in compassionate silence, nodded. "Listen to John, dear. It's not a hopeless situation. It may not even be an issue." She couldn't stand it a moment longer. Mary stood and crossed to sit in Sherlock's lap. It caught him by surprise as it was the first time she had done it. "Stop worrying." With that, she placed a kiss on his cheek.
I long to run my hands through your curls.
“’Strade,” came the mumbled answer.
The whole thing felt incredibly fragile and it didn't escape John's notice how much Sherlock had to trust him to sit like this, especially in such a distraught state. He didn't utter a word, not knowing what he could possibly say to offer comfort. Still, he was willing to sit there for hours if need be. He'd do anything for Sherlock. Anything.
I find you captivating and I am captive to you. Never release me from my prison.
“Right.” Sherlock concentrated until his hand steadied. He used the lock pick and got to work. After a few moments, he was surprised by the click of the lock. Sherlock gasped in surprise. He hadn't expected it to work. “It worked,” he said with a tremble in his voice.
“You can have this,” John told Sherlock. “Any time you want it. You can have this or anything else. All you have to do is ask or just reach out and touch me. And when it’s too much, say so and I’ll back off.” It would hurt and John knew there would be times he would get angry, but he’d just have to deal with it.
Unable to restrain herself any longer, the former assassin rushed forward and pulled her partners into a hug. “We were so worried. The emails said you were alive, but I was afraid they were lying.”
Freezing, the detective gave John a panicked look.
I want to hold you in my arms and adore you.
John looked at Sherlock, licking his lips. His original plans for the night before in the forefront of his mind. He held out a hand to the detective who took it, and helped him to his feet. “Go wait for me on the bed, pet. I’ll be right there.” He watched as his boy went eagerly to their room. This was going to be fun.
Sherlock looked away from Doctor Dieter. In truth, he knew his mind wasn't functioning properly at all, but he was loathe to admit it.
It didn’t take the detective long to find a route free of CCTVs. He flinched every time he saw anyone that vaguely resembled his rapist, but he was determined to continue.
"John, take some time. Breathe." Ella watched him as he visibly calmed himself down. "First of all, you're angry. It's completely alright and normal for you to be angry."
The detective forced himself to relax, something he could only manage due to John's proximity. "It's nothing. I'm fine," he lied. "Go back to Top Gear. You passed it. It's that one you like so much." Sherlock slouched down on the sofa and leant against John's arm, ignoring the worry he could feel coming off the other man in waves. "If I wasn't so comfortable, I'd ask for tea." He hoped John would take the bait and be distracted. John did.
“Bed?” Sherlock asked, receiving a weary smile in response.
The doctor reached out and grasped one of the ropes that made up the harness and pulled his boy in for a kiss. Sherlock's lips parted under his and he pushed his tongue in, plundering his mouth. He explored every ridge, enjoying how his boy responded to him.
Lestrade shot Sally a look. “She does and she approves, not that it’s any of your business.”
Mycroft took Sherlock's anger in stride. “Whatever you are talking about, I am sure I only did what needed to be done.’
Sherlock sat up abruptly, causing the doctor to stir. He froze and waited for John to settle into a deeper sleep, then climbed out of bed and glided silently into the living room.
John and Sherlock stepped out of the taxi onto the pathway, the doctor paying the cabbie before joining his sub on the steps of New Scotland Yard. He paused for a moment, admiring the black leather of Sherlock’s collar against the pale flesh of his neck.
Mycroft stepped forward, his hand outstretched to shake hands with John.
Greg tried not to laugh outright but couldn’t suppress a smile. “Alright. I’ll phone you tomorrow. Go on.” As soon as the door closed behind the couple, he burst out laughing.
Managing a weak smile, John looked back down at his fisted hand. "It's about Sherlock. I need advice. He's been... He was... Damn." The doctor hit the armrest with his fist, then opened it and looked at the back of it for a moment.
“Now, then, we are going to have a little conversation.” She shoved the gun under his chin. “Where are my husband and Sherlock?”
“Oh thank fuck,” the DI breathed.
The doctor could tell he was anything but fine. “Okay,” he said, trying to sound like he believed his friend. He didn’t quite manage it, but Sherlock didn't notice.
You blush. You stammer. Your steps falter. How can you not see?
Sherlock looked glum at the prospect. His shoulders were raised and he crossed his arms over his chest.
Upon entering the living room, he found Mrs. Hudson knitting. From the door, be could hear the shower going. John gave a sigh. “Thank you for looking after him, Mrs. Hudson.”
“He's not alone. Mrs. Hudson is keeping him company.” But he was the one who should be there. What if Sherlock had a panic attack whilst he was out? It didn’t bear thinking about.
John ran his hand through his boy's curls. “Have fun, but be nice to her. I know how you can be.” He softened his words with a smile.
“Yes, boy?” The Dom asked calmly.
Dusks and dawns were of crawling panic.
For his part, the doctor felt anything but comfortable. His trousers had suddenly become far too restrictive. “Ahem. Right. Yes. Why don't you go get dressed now.” His voice was rough with arousal.
Mycroft and Mary brought them up to speed to the point Anthea had provided her report.
John noted that as something to be discussed later. “I’m not going to spank you, you git. Now drop them.”
For almost an hour, the flat was filled with music. It was quiet and subdued music; peaceful, but not melancholy. It soothed something inside John that had been aching for weeks and he relaxed enough to drift of to sleep.
Mary's inner struggle, whether she should tell Mycroft about the email, had been rendered moot by the government official's words.
“I’ll be right there.” Sherlock hung up before he heard Lestrade’s ‘Thank you’. He hopped in the air and spun around. “Brilliant! Yes! Ah, four serial suicides, and now a note! Oh, it’s Christmas!”
“Listen, if you don’t go in there with me right now, I’ll be giving you a spanking at home that you won’t be able to face as stoically as the one I gave you last night. Now come on.” He tugged on Sherlock’s arm and the detective reluctantly followed him to the door of Lestrade’s office.
Sherlock found himself feeling truly sorry, not that he had nicked the handcuffs, but that he had managed to disappoint John already. It wouldn’t have been so bad if he could have used his hand to hold onto his Dom's ankle. Another point of contact would have been grounding – just one more. He heard himself say, “Forty, thank you, sir,” then braced for the next blow.
The detective sat up and blinked a few times. With a chuckle, John threw some cash towards the cabbie, then took his sub's hand and led him from the car. He fetched Sherlock’s keys from the right pocket of the Belstaff and used them to unlock the door, then he guided his boy upstairs after locking the door behind them.
When they got to 221 Baker Street, Sherlock just stood there staring at the door. John reached into his pocket and pulled out some keys. He quickly found the correct one and let them in. “Which flat?” John asked quietly.
“Sit, and I will explain.” The government official waited until Sherlock and John had both sat, the former in his accustomed chair, the latter on the sofa.
I tumble with you into our bed where we make sweet love that dims the light of our adventures in comparison as our passion brims forth with giddy light.
“Mm.”
“Any good?” Sherlock asked.
Huggable Baby Puff
Sherlock met his eyes. “And you came anyway.”
After what seemed like hours but was only a few minutes, her phone buzzed in her pocket. Bringing her gun up, she took aim at Williams who appeared in the courtyard below. When she pulled the trigger, the sharp sound of a gunshot filled the air. Williams fell to the ground, red staining the ground beneath him.
"Greetings to you as well," the government official said as he leant his umbrella against the wall. He went through to the kitchen to make himself a cup of tea, ignoring the more than unkempt state of the flat. "I've come on Mummy's behalf. She's worried about you living here alone and uncollared."
“Good. I think we all need each other.” The way he said it, his meaning was clear. Mary leant her head against his shoulder. “Yes, we do.” She sighed contentedly. “I need something gentle and sweet.”
“Sherlock?” John called, heading towards his friend's room. He found the door was ajar and pulled it open. On the bed, he found Sherlock and, by his side, the wooden box along with the used needle and empty vial.
“Look at you, pet,” Mycroft said hungrily. His eyes were on the glass butt plug that filled the DI's entrance. “You’ve worn that for me all day just like I wanted.” He reached out and touched it, running his finger around the smooth rim.
The detective gave a shiver when John slipped the blindfold on him. Suddenly his other senses were heightened. He could feel the heat of his Dom's breath against his skin.
The cab stopped outside 221. They climbed out, Sherlock paying the cabbie for once. As they entered the front door, Mary called a greeting up the stairs.
The detective had used the magic word, clever. That meant he was hooked. Well, if Mary and Sherlock were excited, who was John to argue? The game was on.
“Oh God, yes.” John was anxious for a bit of action and, truth be told, he wanted to see the sub at work. He had a feeling Sherlock Holmes could get himself into no end of trouble.
They overlook your brilliance, beauty, loyalty, and, yes, deep feeling.
Rosie looked at him for a ling moment, then stuck her tongue out at him before going off to play.
“Then you shall have it.” Sherlock kissed the top of her head, letting his eyes fall closed. He was excited, enchanted and content. It felt odd. It felt good. It would only get better when John got home.
Sherlock was frantically shaking his head. He looked up. "I can read the toll it's taking on your face. I should... I need to start taking care of myself, not relying on you so much." He took a deep breath and continued, "Maybe I should see a psychiatrist... to make things easier on you." There. He'd said it, though it pained him to agree with Mycroft in any way. That and he still had doubts about the usefulness of psychiatry in general, but it was for John's sake. He'd do anything for him.
“Yes, I do.” Sherlock was too engrossed in the case to complain about Mycroft's obviously continued surveillance of the flat.
Mycroft sighed. “And what would you have done with him?”
The detective noticed John's surprise and looked down and away. "I feel... safer with you nearby. I don't think I could say that of anyone else." Not only that, but he felt safer touching John. If he was that close to him, no one stood a chance of hurting him. It wasn't a healthy reason to want to be so close to him, he knew, and it was getting all muddled up with the other feelings he had for John, but had tried to shove back into his Mind Palace when he decided to call a halt to the kisses. The problem was, those feelings kept trying to creep back out. How could he know if what he felt was love or desperation? A sick needy dependence?
John went silent for several more minutes, long enough for Sherlock’s arms to start drooping. He leaned forward and tapped the undersides of Sherlock’s elbows and nodded with satisfaction when Sherlock lifted his arms back into position again.
"Well, I think it's brilliant." Mary winked at John who smiled back.
In a fit of pique, the detective picked up the nearest object which happened to be a mug of cold tea and threw it across the room. The shattering sound was satisfying. He stood up and started throwing everything within reach. Each clatter and crash brought a grim smile to his face and warded off the panic attack that had been impending.
He lay there, grinning up at Sherlock. “That may be one of the most insane things I have ever done.”
“I want you inside me, sir. Please.”
Mildly non-con due to Sherlock’s altered mental state.
Sherlock let himself rest there for several long minutes, basking in everything he had stored in his Mind Palace about John. Everything from his smile to the way he pretended to read when Sherlock played the violin. He spent several moments replaying the sweet kisses they had shared before Sherlock had put a stop to them. After an indeterminate amount of time, he knew he had to leave this safe space and return to the real world. He was accomplishing nothing here.
Climbing into bed with his boy, John wrapped his arm around him as he spooned up behind him. “Thank you for my birthday present, pet.”
The sub groaned at the prospect of having his cock locked up. He was sure that John’s plans for the evening would be very provocative and he would be driven mad by not getting to come. Of course, that was the point.
“I'll tell you if I need you to stop, yes.”
If I fall silent, know that you have dazzled me.
John grinned. “Alright then. Let's move this to the bedroom.” He couldn't wait to get his hands on Sherlock’s body. Luckily, he wouldn't have to.
"Sorry, John. Sorry." He loosened his hold. The idea of John actually enjoying the three of them together made Sherlock's cock get even harder. Suddenly, his concern about the upcoming activities seemed to pale to nothing and he began to look forward to it. "Thank you for telling me that." Sherlock rolled onto his back, willing his erection away. "Stay the night?"
"Would you stop that," John chided. "There, I think that's all the glass." He disinfected the wounds, then, after consideration, decided the detective didn't need any stitches. "You're incredibly luckly. All I need to do is bandage you up." He did so efficiently, finishing up by patting Sherlock's bandaged hand. "Sherlock..." He couldn't bring himself to ask it, but he thought perhaps they shouldn't go to the Yard.
John fell asleep first. The sound of his quiet, steady breathing soothed Sherlock. He listened to it until it eventually lulled him to sleep.
When Sherlock’s name was called to go back to Doctor Dieter's office, he froze, but only for a moment. Standing, Sherlock walked towards the office door, not looking to see if John was following. In fact, he had avoided looking at John all morning. It was making John wonder if he was truly wanted at this session.
John crouched down by him and pulled him into his arms, unable to resist. “That was beautiful, pet. Just beautiful.”
The thrill. The chase. Shared laughter on the run. Heated glances. The mystery in your eyes.
John slapped his thigh. “Stop that!” He grasped the detective's cock and started pumping it, his grip firm.
Sherlock decided the place to start to ensure that was his Mind Palace. He had planned to talk with Doctor Dieter about it, but he didn’t think it could wait. He needed to try to clear it out of the random debris that littered it now, that or lock the debris away in a closet or dungeon. Hopefully that would stop the nightmares and he could go on with his life.
I once walked, merely trudging along.
Sherlock headed to the bedroom. Once there, he changed into a suit. He looked in the mirror and was surprised by what he saw: someone competent, someone that was healing. He glanced at his watch, then hurried through the flat. “I’ll be back, John. My appointment with Doctor Dieter is in less than 30 minutes.”
When John entered the room, he ruffled his boy's hair in passing. He went directly to their play chest and opened it then rummaged through it, clearly searching for something in particular. When he found it, he made a pleased sound. Turning around, he showed Sherlock his prize: a cock cage.
"Kiss Sherlock, tell him we love him and we can do this again," Mary directed.
I look at you and see beauty.
“My fault,” Sherlock insisted, for the first time looking at John. “I can’t forget the things I said. I hurt you. I don’t deserve the comfort of your touch, not after that.” His voice broke and his eyes welled with tears.
"Of course it is, the former assassin said, reaching out her hand and taking Sherlock's in her own. "How could I  possibly see you any other way? I do love you. That's why we're in this family together. It wouldn't work any other way."
“Where are you? Tell me,” Mary demanded, “and I’ll be there right away.”
Sherlock winked at her. “I managed to keep busy.”
I love you. I should have said it before. I. Love. You. There. I have put it on paper. That’s why I need you. That’s why I need you to forgive me. I can't stand that I caused you so much physical and mental pain, that I hurt someone I love so deeply. Please, let me come see you. Please.
"That's fine," the doctor breathed as he kissed Sherlock on the jaw. "I'm looking forward to it, actually."
You were intoxicating.
“Do it. I’m going to give you something to remind you to be polite and respectful.”
“Yes, Mary,” the doctor said. “Please, try not to worry.”
Sherlock stood there, his eyes full of fire. “You don’t know that.” His voice was low and firm.
“No. He’s my Dom's brother. I think he’s in sub-Shock,” Greg said.
“Oh, you massive git,” John said, pulling away from Mary.
The Dom brought his hand down on Sherlock’s pristine arse with a forceful blow that made the sub cry out in shock. Still, he remembered what he had been told. “One, thank you, sir.” Before he could brace himself mentally for the next strike, John's hand came down again.
“Yes, more than ready.’
Sitting on the edge of the bed, John ordered his boy to strip. It didn’t take long as all the detective was wearing was his dressing gown thrown over his pants.
"That's the Sherlock we love," John said, smiling. "So..." His tone grew more serious. "You... enjoyed that? What we did?"
Finally finishing his coffee, the doctor ventured downstairs. He paused at the door to C and knocked. Hearing his boy call out, “Come in, sir,” he opened and stepped through.
The detective started pacing the floor, his emotions in complete chaos. He wanted to hurt something like he had been hurt. He wanted to hurt Bigelow. He
When nothing was said by either John or Sherlock, the government official stood. He straightened his jacket then started for the door.
You are my:
The detective tried to follow suit, but sleep eluded him. He lay there, staring at the ceiling. His thoughts drifted restlessly, the image of the ginger from his dreams intruding on them. He tried to banish such thoughts by concentrating on his breathing, but the mystery of what had happened haunted him. That was when the thought struck him: the whole thing was a mystery... a case. All he had to do was treat it as such. He didn’t have to let it rule him.
Doctor Dieter didn't seem very surprised. “I know you're an intelligent man, Mr. Holmes. I follow Doctor Watson’s blog. So think about the muscles in the human body. They can either be tense or relaxed. There's no in between. What I want you to do is clench every muscle in your body, then release. That will force you to relax. Try it.”
John nodded thoughtfully. "Yeah. It'll be good to get out for a bit." And he'd be right there if Sherlock needed him. "Why don't you get dressed and I'll call Greg?" In addition to asking for cold cases, he'd caution the DI against any mention of the rape. There wouldn't be a repeat of what had happened with Molly.
“How did you know about the email?” Mary asked.
John’s mouth broke out into a wide grin as he waited for their lover to react. Sherlock just stared at the piece of plastic, unblinking.
Lestrade kept talking to the younger man, giving him orders and keeping him talking, though Sherlock only responded in broken words. When the ambulance arrived, Greg breathed a sigh of relief.
Sherlock didn't seem to notice, he was so manic. “Seen a lot of injuries, then; violent deaths.”
It was less than an hour before Mycroft made his appearance. He stepped into the flat without announcing himself, as was his want.
John went to put on tea and saw that his friend hadn't eaten the breakfast he'd fixed for him. He didn't say anything, just cleared it away, put on the kettle and set about making Sherlock a sandwich. It was long past the point that physical complications would be making it difficult for the detective to eat. Now it was down to old habits and, John was afraid, new mental scars. When everything was ready, he carried the tea and sandwich and placed it on the coffee table in front of Sherlock. "Eat. Doctor's orders."
The sub tested his bonds, and, satisfied they would hold, settled into them, ready to be used. What he didn’t expect was for his bollocks and cock to be covered in a layer of Tiger Balm. “John!”
"Don't give me that, Mycroft. You know how I got this," he pointed to his bruise, "whilst chasing a criminal. It has nothing to do with me being a sub."
John snorted. “Yeah, where are we going?”
John shook his head. “Well, before you got here, Mycroft informed me that he has Williamson in custody. I don’t think we have to worry about him shooting anyone else.”
You are my heart, my joy, my life. I sing you my never ending song of love. I give you my self, unworthy though it is.
"Tell John what?" the doctor asked. He had entered from the bedroom and was leaning against the doorway. He had an amused look on his face.
“I don’t think so. Practically the next moment, your brother threw himself down in a chair in a sulk. You know how he does. Not only did John look at him with disapproval, but... it was clear from the way Sherlock winced that he’d had a spanking at the very least at some point.”
John grinned. He was going to take his boy to the edge again and again, making him beg for release.
Ella had also given him information about a couples' support group for couples dealing with the aftermath of rape. Though John and Sherlock weren't officially a couple, she thought the group meetings might be beneficial even if only John attended. The group was completely anonymous and nothing was discussed outside the group.
"I should expect so." Sherlock had leant forward and pulled the box towards him. He started fingering through the files, looking at the labels on the folders. The moment he noticed that his hands were shaking, he pulled back and shoved them in the pockets of his Belstaff. "These should be adequate," he told Greg, making sure his voice didn't crack. He felt like a complete failure, letting Donovan get to him just as he had promised himself he wouldn't do.
Do you know, beloved, how beautiful you are? You don’t, no matter how many times I tell you.
Taking his tea with him, the doctor went up to his room for a bit of privacy.. He set his tea down on his dresser, then pulled out his mobile and the list, then he dialled the number of the psychiatrist.
The detective’s heart rate shot up even higher and his breathing became rapid. He barely managed to get out, “No. He stays.”
“He agrees with you,” Sherlock said, suddenly feeling defeated. All he wanted to do was hide away and try not to think about Bigelow and what he had done anymore. He stepped towards the door.
Greg pretended not to hear her. “Oi! You two! I suppose it’s too much to hope you’ll come straight in and give your statements.”
The detective was drawn to him, the euphoria of the moment demanding something more. “Indeed.” He bent down and kissed John passionately without a thought to whom might be watching.
Sherlock felt the bed shift as John climbed off to fetch some toys. With his eyes shut, he attempted to deduce what his Dom was selecting. John would be retrieving a blindfold, cuffs, and... a spreader bar. He squirmed a bit in anticipation.
Sherlock's eyes flew open in the real world as he let out a desperate cry.
Mycroft made a move to follow him, saying, “Sherlock, wait.”
In response, John himself tipped over the edge into orgasm and he pumped Sherlock full of his come before disentangling himself and falling on the bed beside him.
“Right. If you were taking full, deep breaths, it would be your other hand moving. Give it a go. Try to breathe so your left hand moves.”
Sherlock nodded, too satisfied and completely knackered for words. He closed his eyes and fell asleep. When he woke up, he had been cleaned and cared for, his arms unbound and nipple clamps removed. How he'd slept through their removal, he'd never know. In the peace of the moment, John held him gently and all was well.
“Thank you, pet,” John said, kissing the top of the detective's head. He was a mess, and he knew he should clean himself up sooner than later, but he couldn’t be arsed to move. It felt too good having his boy safe beside him.
Sherlock looked at his Dom. “I should have seen it before. In all the photos at her flat, the victim was wearing two rings on her right hand. They were antiques. Her grandmother's engagement ring and wedding band.” He picked up a photo that showed the victim's right hand clearly. “Look John. You can still see the indentation from where she wore them constantly. Her cousin thought
John smiled at the phrasing. “Of course.” He took a step back and began undressing. “I told you, you can have anything.”
There are probably a hundred other little things I should apologise for, but the big one is hanging over us still, isn't it?
Sherlock shook his head. "My face is too long, I have strange eyes and my curls are  too much to tame."
With a quick motion, the Dom grasped Sherlock’s cock. “I want you on the bed with your arms and legs spread out, ready for me to take you apart.”
Mycroft poured a glass of Brandy and handed it to the other man. “My assistant is tracing the emails that I and Mrs. Watson received.”
Without you, I would be only half a man, the sadder half.
The Dom recognised the fact. He pushed Sherlock further, until he was completely under, then he told him, “Come for me, pet.”
If you have read this far, then know I will do anything, absolutely anything, if it will save our friendship. There is more that I want to say, but maybe I shouldn't say it right now.
“Williamson shot you, John. I couldn't just let him walk away from that.”
I will follow where you lead, be it the rooftops of London or the depths of the Thames.
John left him to his thoughts and went into the kitchen to put on the kettle. While he waited for it to boil, he leaned against the side and let out a deep sigh. The visit to see Doctor Dieter had been productive, but tiring. After a few moments standing there, he heard the strains of the violin as they floated through the air. His heart sped up and his eyes watered. It had become extremely rare for Sherlock to play. It seemed like ages since he had done it last. John closed his eyes and let himself enjoy it whilst he waited for the kettle to boil. When it did, he switched it off and made them both tea, carrying it into the living room. He set Sherlock’s on the coffee table, then took a seat in his chair.
At first, the doctor didn't see anything, then his eyes locked onto a bit of dark wool that lay splayed out on the ground, just peaking out from behind some old crates. As he approached, he could hear Sherlock's ragged breathing. It didn't sound like the detective was having a full panic attack... not yet. When he was close enough to see his friend fully, he set the box down, then crouched a few feet away from Sherlock and waited to be acknowledged.
Sherlock turned around and settled over his Dom’s lap, his cock hard and aching. He knew what was coming and he wasn’t looking forward to it. So why was he so aroused? It was an aspect of being a sub that he didn’t understand.
I hold no ill will towards you whatsoever. Nothing you have ever done has been unjustified. I am not a good man. I am a dangerous man. It would have been better had we never met. You would never have been so deeply wounded as you have by my acquaintance. As for myself
Sherlock pulled away, trying to reclaim a sense of calm. It eluded him. “I don’t know. I... I... I remember it all now.” He swallowed hard. “I don’t know what to do with it.”
“I know you
At her words, the detective perked up, clearly interested. “What has Mycroft found to interest you.”
The sub nuzzled John’s cock, trying to urge it to hardness. The doctor pulled him away by the expediency of grasping a handful of curls.
“How was it?” John asked casually.
Sherlock couldn’t believe he had entered into a contract, even with someone as clearly remarkable as John Watson. John, however, was grinning broadly, clearly chuffed.
John walked over and tugged on the detective's arm until Sherlock relented and let the doctor hold his hand. "I said I'm fine," Sherlock insisted, slightly annoyed. He didn't want to talk about what was bothering him, not yet. Besides, it might not even be an issue... then again it might. Why couldn't he just forget about it like the thought had never occurred to him?!
“I need to come, sir.”
“I merely hold a minor position within the British government,” the older Dom replied smoothly.
Sherlock locked his knees to ensure he remained on his feet. “When I walked in, I said, “Afghanistan or Iraq?” You looked surprised.”
"Just take your time."
“Of course I do. It's a neurotransmitter that carries signals between neurons.” Sherlock still had his arms crossed defensively.
I regret that I made you think, even for one second, that her death was your fault. It wasn't. I was angry and lashed out at you unfairly. Then what I did to you in the morgue. It is unforgivable. I don't know how to apologise for that. I may have broken us completely, and that scares me to death. I can't ask for your forgiveness because I don't deserve it.
It had been too long since John and Sherlock had rang and Mary was starting to worry. She gave them another half an hour before she phoned John. When he didn’t answer, she tried Sherlock with an equal lack of success.
John gave a small smile. “I love you. I don't see how you didn't deduce it before now.”
“Don't wanna.”
“Mmm, yes.”
Mycroft sighed to himself. It was time to broach a subject that no one other than himself would dare bring up. "John is a good man. I have come to value his presence in your life, not merely for his steadying effect on you nor simply for his medical skills. He has become your dedicated friend. I couldn't have hoped for more." He paused to see if his words would garner a reaction, but they failed to elicit a visible response. "John is burning himself out, trying to help you. I see it in his eyes." At this, Sherlock's shoulders shifted. "You need to take some of the burden off of him, baby brother. You need to see a psychiatrist."
“Sherlock, we can't do this. Not in your condition. We haven't talked.” It had cost John quite a bit to stop the sub. He wanted to take him to bed and take him apart piece by piece. He wanted to punish him, too, for his reckless actions. God, he wanted Sherlock so much.
Sherlock pulled away from John and started crawling towards the bedroom. If he had been more himself he would have found it equal parts fascinating and infuriating that he had chosen to crawl rather than walk. As it was, he was thinking with his hind brain and acting upon instinct.
The ginger from Sherlock’s nightmare flashed through his mind, but he shoved it away, back into the closet in his Mind Palace. His Mind Palace. He had wanted to talk about it and its current state before his sudden impulse to bring John along. “Have you heard of the method of loci?” He asked Doctor Dieter. “No, I can tell from the look on your face.” Sherlock explained it quickly, knowing his time was running short. “Next time... My Mind Palace is a shambles. It’s not safe inside. I need help getting control of it.”
“What emails?” John asked.
John found himself curious despite the sub’s attitude. “Afghanistan. How did you know?”
, John.“
The man raised his hands in the air in surrender. Mary crossed over to him, keeping the gun trained on him. With her left hand, she pulled out a pair of handcuffs. “Put them on,” she ordered. “
You saved me, resuscitating me with your love.
John couldn’t help himself – he giggled. The detective grinned in response. Life was exceedingly good at the moment. Of course, that’s when fate chose to take a turn.
"Unless you get someone more intriguing in here, don't call me," John said as he pulled his coat on in preparation for leaving. "You'll just be wasting your time and mine."
At that, John swallowed and extended his hand, helping Sherlock to his feet.
John's left hand clenched into a fist. He knew it was pointless trying to talk to his friend right then: he was too angry and Sherlock was too high. He looked at the box that lay on the bed. Inside it lay the vial with just a bit more liquid in it. He snatched it up. “Is this all of it?” he asked, using his captain's voice.
The doctor though a moment. “Can you find a lock pick, maybe?” he asked.
“Good. That's good.” The doctor gave Sherlock’s thigh a squeeze.
The depth of sincerity in the detective's eyes took John's breath away. Something fundamental had changed, though the doctor didn’t know what. The last time they had been in this situation, they had been nearly destroyed by the enormous upheaval that had resulted.
When the detective came to, he was laying on top of John who was smiling up at him. “Like I said, brilliant.”
“Are you alright?” Sherlock asked, concerned.
“They're all freaks,” Donovan mumbled under her breath.
“What?”  John asked.
Even as the eager Dom matchmaker, Mark, smiled at John, the doctor pushed the laptop away from him, sliding it across the desk. He ran his fingers through his blond hair. "You just don't have any subs that I'm interested in. They're all too..." he waved his hand at the laptop screen, "ordinary, soft. I need someone with a bit of backbone who can stand up to an ex army captain, not fall to their knees the first time I raise my voice."
John and Sherlock slid into the back seat of one of Mycroft's cars. The detective looked particularly bedraggled. He had received several stitches in his side where the suspect has stabbed him. Luckily, the knife hadn't gone very deep.
“I want you, now John.”
Sherlock decided he didn't like being punished in that fashion one bit. “Sir?” Sherlock asked after several minutes, his voice cracking artfully.
“J... J... John. Don’t stop. Please,” Sherlock begged, his head twisting from side to side on his pillow. He felt lost in the sensations that he was feeling. Had he permission, he would have come right then, but he held on, not daring to fall over the edge without permission.
Naturally, Ella had encouraged John to get Sherlock to seek help. He had taken the card of a recommended therapist for his friend, but he knew it was pointless.
With a jerk of his head towards the now shattered bathroom mirror, Sherlock said, "I had an accident." In fact, he had looked in the mirror and, lost somewhere, had seen himself, weak and helpless, useless, pathetic, and couldn't stand the miserable sight so he had punched his reflection without thinking. The pain had brought him back to himself.
Closing his eyes and folding his hands in a prayerful manner beneath his chin, Sherlock ventured into his Mind Palace. He didn’t go deep, just stepped into his inner representation of 221B. It seemed peaceful there. Inner John was present and asleep in his chair just as the real John was in the real world. His presence comforted Sherlock and gave him more confidence in his endeavour.
At this, John spoke up, concern in his voice. “You are aware of Sherlock’s history.”
“It's a banking issue that has already cost thousands and left alone could start an economic decline. The books simply don’t balance, but the bank is at a loss to explain why,” the blond explained.
Despite how rocky the day had been, the evening had been rather pleasant. Sherlock had even found the wherewithal to send an email to Doctor Dieter requesting he familiarize himself with the method of loci if he wasn’t familiar with it already. That was something Sherlock appreciated about Doctor Dieter, he encouraged emails if they were important and truly relevant to his recovery. Sherlock was sure that would change if he abused the privilege and, for once, he was loathe to risk alienating a doctor besides John.
“I can come with you,” John offered.
Yes, you are remarkable.
“As I was saying, I love to watch you work. What I don’t like is being called an idiot.”
“Are you sure you should be looking into this like it's just another case?”
I look into your eyes and see the light of your soul shining through.
Sherlock watched as his Dom backed up and stood in front of him. His eyes bulged and he instantly regretted being in trouble when John started removing his clothing. He was going about it slowly, in a teasing manner, clearly determined to wind his sub up and it was working. As each inch of golden flesh was revealed, the detective's cock strained against its confines even more. Sherlock let out a groan of frustration when John finally stepped out of his pants and stood before him, naked. He wanted to touch and be touched, but knew it wasn’t going to happen.
Sherlock nodded. When he stood, he and John stood together, not releasing their grip. They bid Doctor Dieter farewell and headed back out of the office, then towards Baker Street.
Your unique charm enthrals me; a charm others do not see. (Idiots one and all.)
Sherlock
The doctor approached Sherlock and crouched down in front of him. He took his boy's cock in his hand with a clinical touch and fitted the cage on it, locking it in place. “There, now I don’t have to worry about you getting yourself into more trouble.” John patted his boy's caged cock, then he stood up.
The doctor stood there a few moments, his left hand clenching and unclenching, then he calmly collected the box of case files, nodded to the stunned DI and walked from the office himself. He'd go home and hopefully find Sherlock there. When he did, he definitely wouldn't shout at him. Definitely. No matter how much he wanted to.
I lavish your intellect and heart with praises. I worship your body. You open your eyes and look at me with wonder.
Sherlock woke first, though he was still groggy from being drugged. Wherever they were, it was dark. He sat up trying to remember what had happened. The last thing he remembered was being in the car with John leant up against him. They must have been gassed. That was particularly worrisome since John was suffering from concussion.
Mere minutes later found John and Sherlock in the back of a cab headed back to Baker Street.
"Stop, you git," the doctor growled. "You've done enough running off in the past. I'm not about to have you start again now."
“I refuse to enter that office whilst he's in there.”
I don't know why you chose me, you could have had anyone.
The only other feeling he had felt recently was fear and that only came when he dreamt. It was always accompanied by the weight of a burly man atop him, laughing darkly, or the light touch of a different, ginger haired man whispering into his ear, "This will be just between us." He woke from such dreams disoriented and confused, not knowing who the ginger haired man was, not wanting to know. Soon, though, the familiar numbness would settle over him with John none the wiser about Sherlock's nightmares.
"Really?" That intrigued the doctor enough that he went over to the laptop to look at the sub's photo. "He's a posh looking one, but he certainly is beautiful." John sat down and read the limited information on the sub, one Sherlock Holmes. He had a feeling most of what he read had been made up simply to disinterest any potential matches with his profile.
John let out a breath he didn’t realise he had been holding. “That’s... good.” He tapped his fingers on the table top.
Sherlock, forgetting for a moment about the cuffs that bound his wrists, tried to embrace John, but couldn’t. “Oh, god,” he groaned out loud as John began to move inside him. It felt so good, like he was being torn apart in the very best of ways.
With his hands at the nape of his neck and his arms held up in perfect posture, Sherlock bit into the bar of soap. The only sign of displeasure he gave was a wrinkling of the nose though the soap tasted hideous.
That evening, when John announced that he was going to bed, Sherlock stopped him by calling out his name, “John?”
John had quite a lot to think about.
Thinking of what Doctor Dieter had taught him, the detective placed his feet on the floor. He tensed every muscle in his body, then released the tension in preparation for getting his breathing under control. Even as he placed one hand on his chest and the other just below his diaphragm, he was aware of Mrs Hudson watching him. He closed his eyes and ignored her, only paying attention to his breathing and the motions of his hands.
Having regained control, the government official resumed fucking his sub. He stepped them back from the wall and reached around him to grasp his cock and started stroking it in time with his thrusts. He could feel Greg trembling against him. It gave him a sense of control that was delightful. “Beg me to come, pet.”
John and Sherlock were in the waiting room at the psychiatrist’s office. Yesterday had been a nightmare and the doctor had stayed close in case he was needed. Last night had been even worse and they both looked it.
After a moment, Sherlock let his hands fall from his face and he nodded, though he turned his head to look away from his friend. The anger and frustration that had driven him out of the flat in search of drugs had fled. In it’s place was a new kind of fear and a terrible guilt. He wanted to hide. He wanted to be comforted. He hated himself for both desires.
Seeing that made both John and Mary smile. The detective’s habits were much healthier nowadays, although he still required little to  no sleep.
Sherlock dreamt each night of the ginger-haired man and each night John woke him and spoke to him soothingly. The detective never managed to back to sleep after his nightmares. Instead ,he moved to the sofa in the living room and sank into his mind palace, trying to tear down the door that blocked his memories from him.
True to his word, when they were taken to a bay in A&E, Greg saw John waiting. He was sat in a wheel chair, looking pale and worried.
“I’m going to visit Molly at the Morgue. She has some specimens for me.” The sub took the offered strawberry, letting his lips linger on John's fingers for a few moments before pulling away.
Beside him, John relaxed visibly. His relief was so great he felt tears prickle in his eyes. He blinked them away, not wanting Sherlock to see.
John nodded, then he removed the cage. One stroke of Sherlock's cock and the sub was fully erect. The Dom laughed, then pushed his boy down on the bed. “Roll onto your stomach,” John ordered. He enjoyed the view as the detective stretched out, putting his arse and back on display.
“Have fun, boys. Don’t forget to loop me in,” the former assassin said.
The door slamming didn’t cause the detective to panic, but it did jar some sense into him. He replayed his words to himself and cringed. He started to fetch his phone to send a text apologising, but decided against it. John needed time to cool down and he deserved an apology in person. He doubted he’d be gone long, considering he was still wearing his pyjamas.
I call you extraordinary.
Mary looked back at him, smiling. “Yes, but I’d be happier if you’d start drying.”
I call you extraordinary.
“Of course it was. It was extraordinary; it was quite extraordinary.”
Sherlock didn’t hesitate at those words. With a 'yes, sir' he climbed on the bed and stretched out.
“Not today,” the psychiatrist affirmed.
“Sherlock…” John began, but the psychiatrist interrupted.
Of all the outcomes John had expected, this hadn't been on the list. If he had been in Sherlock's shoes, he would be a blubbering mess, he was sure.
“My sentiments exactly.” After a short pause, the government official continued, “I will arrive shortly. We can discuss the path forward when I arrive.”
Sherlock nodded. He liked having something practical in his repertoire to use. It felt… comfortable. “Alright.”
“What is it?” John asked quietly, a hint of steel in his voice.
“David Bigelow.”
After blinking several times, Sherlock finally came back to himself. He looked from John to Mary with a puzzled frown on his face. "I don't understand why you would want me to be the father of our child. Yes I have a brilliant mind but that's my only personal asset. I'm antisocial, I have the face of a horse and I don't understand social cues. Worst of all, I don't care."
The DI smothered his laugh as he deduced the reason for Sherlock’s discomfort. He didn’t want to embarrass his young friend despite the fact that Sherlock wouldn’t hesitate to embarrass him.
“What you did at MatchDs, tell me more about myself,” John challenged. He wanted to see just how good the self proclaimed consulting detective was.
The Dom knew exactly what his naughty pet was doing, but didn't give a fuck. Sherlock was beautiful like this, giving himself over to passion for John's sake. It made it difficult not to touch him, though. He wanted to step forward and kiss him, grind against him, fuck him, but he maintained control.
“Y... yes, sir,” the sub stammered.
Leaving John's room, he was assailed by the scattered memories. They seemed to have congregated outside the door and he had to wade through their slimy stench. At the same time, the fluttering, dark shadows bombarded him from every side. He felt himself panicking as he emerged from his Mind Palace into the real world. His breathing was wild and erratic.
John's mind was made up. He was going to follow Ella's advice and see how Sherlock reacted. Things couldn’t get much worse. That decision made, he phoned Mycroft and informed him of his plan. A short argument ensued, but the doctor won in the end. When it came to what was best for Sherlock, the government official almost always bent to John's judgement. Of course, if the doctor was wrong, there would be hell to pay.
John grasped Sherlock’s cock and pumped it a few times so that it filled out nicely and, when he released it, it stood out slightly from Sherlock’s belly, red and needy already. Opening a tube of lube, John squeezed some out onto his hand and worked it over and between his fingers, then he reached down and stroked between Sherlock’s legs, over his perineum.
Sherlock looked dumbstruck as he tucked in his shirt and fastened his trousers. When his Dom had pulled him from the incident room, he hadn’t expected anything like this. He had braced himself for a fight that never came. As he returned to the incident room, he was so lost in thought that he didn’t notice the sympathetic look on Lestrade's face or the smug look on Donovan's. Instead, he concentrated on the crime scene photos, his eyes drawn to the victim's right hand. “Idiot!” he shouted in a moment of clarity, and twirled around. “It was her cousin.” Why hadn’t he seen it before? He answered himself: because he had needed John to make his mind stop for a minute and he had done that indirectly in the bathroom.
You reach for me blindly. I come to you. Where I long to be.
Quietly, Sherlock took a seat in his chair and simply watched John. He wanted to take some of the pressure off of him. He felt incredibly guilty for what he was putting John through on a daily basis. That was going to change. Things were going to be more like they had been this morning. He was going to see to it.
"Afghanistan or Iraq?"
John shook his head sharply. “What? Do you want me to say I get angry? Fine. I do. He’s Sherlock for Christ's sake. Shouldn’t he be getting over this?” It wasn’t fair to demand that, he knew, but... “Nothing affects him, not like this. He shakes off broken bones and stab wounds like they’re nothing. It’s all just ‘transport' to him, so why is he getting worse instead of better!?” The bitterness and anger in John's voice shocked him and he looked down, feeling ashamed of himself.
"For the record, so do I." John pinched one of Sherlock's nipples, making him yelp.
Sherlock was stood in the doorway. He looked extraordinarily bedraggled. His clothes looked like they had been slept in. No, they looked worse than that. Sherlock’s hair was limp and he was sporting two days worth of stubble.
Mary walked up and put her hand on the detective's arm, giving it a squeeze. "Exactly."
John suppressed a sigh at Sherlock’s reaction to just the mention of medication. He wanted to grab his friend by both arms and shake some sense into him. Medications weren't the invention of some demonic force. They had their place.
“So, Sherlock. How are you feeling on a scale from 1 to 10. 1 being the...”
Sherlock couldn’t suppress a grin at his doctor’s show of strength. It always did things to him, made him want things that weren’t appropriate there on the street. He quickly produced a set of Lestrade's handcuffs and, together, they placed them on the man.
Knowing what his Dom intended, Sherlock turned a rosy shade of pink all over and his cock stirred in interest. He loved being encased in rope, no matter the occasion. “Thank you, sir. John.”
Unfortunately, there hadn’t even been a chase. The only thing that had made it worthwhile had been working with Mary and John. That much had been fun. Mary's wit added to the chemistry that was Sherlock and John.
Come, if convenient. If inconvenient, come anyway. SH ---
Sherlock explored the communal areas of the flat and even his own bedroom and found nothing distressing. He attributed that to inner John’s presence. With him there, the flat seemed to be a haven. He went and sat across from inner John to savour the small victory for a bit, but the victory was short lived.
Sherlock’s mouth fell open, both at the compliment and at the wave of dominance that rolled effortlessly off John. “You think that was brilliant?” he asked, fighting not to add a ‘sir’ to the end of the sentence.
You are my life.
“I see.” Undoubtedly Sherlock had said the most hurtful thing imaginable to make John flee. Mycroft wanted to be angry with the doctor, but he couldn’t. He hated his brother’s ability to hurt most the people he... well, the people Sherlock loved. “What are you going to do?”
“The cross, sir.” Sherlock liked the idea of being spread wide for his Dom's perusal and use. Just the thought made him shudder with arousal and nearly come.
“Oh, Gregory, It’s all in good fun I’m sure. But now, I believe Doctor Watson brought my brother here for a reason. Perhaps we should let him get on with it.”
Taking the invitation, Sherlock went to his knees, getting comfortable. It made him feel warm inside to have the doctor smile down at him with clear love and admiration in his eyes. He opened his mouth and accepted the bit of food from his Dom's fingers.
The kettle sounded and Mary started two mugs of tea steeping. “He comes home from work and, I swear, he turns into this gooey eyed thing that treats me like I’m made of spun glass.”
That made sense, but John didn’t like it. He wondered why nothing could be easy. “Do you want my help?” the doctor asked hesitantly.
“Crime scene. Next?”
The doctor noticed that his boy was sat on his hands and chuckled. He sat up and kissed Sherlock thoroughly, despite morning breath. “You’ve been a good boy. I think there might be a reward in it for you.”
John ran his thumb along Sherlock's knuckles, marvelling that he was being allowed to hold it again. It was difficult not to bring it to his lips and kiss it. In the end, he gave up trying. He placed a light kiss on the back of the detective's hand. “I know you will.” He cleared his throat, then, afraid he'd gone too far, but it appeared he hadn’t. Emotion threatened to overwhelm him. He looked at the case map on the wall and used it as an excuse to change the subject. “So, the case.”
Sex with John was the beginning of his true healing, but only because it was an affirmation of their love. When things got dark, and his fears resurfaced, the doctor was there by his side.
“Such an eager little cock slut.” The government official pressed his mouth to the side of Greg's neck just above the black band of his collar and placed a love bite there. At the same time, he reached down and removed the plug that had kept his pet nice and open for him all day. “I’m going to fuck you now, and you’re not going to come until I give you permission. Is that clear?”
It was all too much for Sherlock suddenly. His legs gave out and he sank unceremoniously to sit on the bed.
After filling and turning the kettle on, Mary made a grab for the book and snatched it out of his hands. “Bollocks. You’re just excited like John and me.” She flipped through a few pages, then handed the book back to him. “Speaking of our husband, he’ll be furious if you don’t eat something.” She put two slices of bread into the toaster.
