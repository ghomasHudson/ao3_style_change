Peter heard the waitress coming back but didn’t bother to look up until he heard her gasp as something Mama said. When he looked at her, her eyes were wide and she was almost vibrating she was that excited.
Tony inclined his head, not willing to say anything until he saw what Steve was hiding. If he wasn’t mistaken, Steve seemed a bit nervous.
“Times up little Omega, it’s time for you to be claimed,” Steve said between kisses to Tony’s mating gland. The feeling of Steve in him was amazing that he decided to figure out the rest as it came. He was going to let Steve claim him eventually, the details weren’t important right now. What was important was that Steve wasn’t moving and Tony
“Well, I know a part of Tony likes it anyway.” He teased. Tony was mortified, of course, his body would betray him. Trying to take his mind off of it he looked back over to Clint. It proved to be a stupid thing to do because just as he did he saw Clint clenching on the machine and more come falling to the ground.
He didn’t seem to mind holding Steve’s hand today though, even swinging it as he skipped along beside him, talking about all the sweets he was going to get trick or treating. It was times like these that Steve thought maybe they were a bit too strict on Peter. The no sugar rule was one the stuck to after they realised the effect it had on Peter and Steve would always stand by it, but the holding hands and car seats were just a few of the overprotective measures the two of them had for him. Tony still read him a bedtime story at night for crying out loud. Peter was such a good kid though and he was rarely bold on purpose. He wasn’t even like the other spoilt rich kids in his school. Tony basically had to lock him out of his room so he could get rid of some of Peter’s older, more worn clothes. It was an ongoing argument. Peter loved to wear something to death before moving onto the next item. This method wasn’t really ideal for Tony and Steve who liked him to be dressed neatly every day. Steve preferred him to be in a shirt tucked into jeans but Tony and Peter had compromised with him so that he was allowed to wear at shirt open with a funny t-shirt under it with a pair of jeans.
Steve ran a hand through his hair in frustration, the thoughts of his baby being so open to the public eye sent a cold sweat through his body. It went against everything in him to let Peter have a Twitter but he knew he couldn’t protect him forever. Tony was right.
“Sorry, bambino. Had to do some damage control, we both know that your favourite uncle Bucky is going to fill half of that bucket for you.”
The first thing he noticed was how difficult it was to stand up as if his legs weren’t willing to support him, he gripped as hard as he could just to stay upright, and had to lean against the rails in the end to support himself. The second thing he noticed was that he wasn’t in his Spiderman suit or even in normal clothes. He was in some sort of body suit, a bit similar to his own but instead, it was short sleeved and had Captain America’s shield on it, stating that he was ‘Captain Adorable.’ He groaned at the pun but was quickly distracted by looking lower where his bottom half was puffing out. He wiggled a little and yep, that felt like a diaper. Why the heck he was in a diaper was beyond him. Sure he used to have trouble with getting to the toilet on time during the night for a lot longer than other boys, to the point that he could recognise a diaper on him by feel, but that didn’t clear up to why it was on him now? This was getting way too confusing for his liking. He really needed to get out of what he now recognised as a big nursey and figure out what was going on and where he was. He hoped he was in New York still. It would be super embarrassing having to go home to Aunt May in the outfit he was currently sporting especially if he was out of state. Just as he was preparing himself to jump out of the crib he spotted something out of the corner of his eye in the crib with him that caught his attention. It looked like an Ironman plushie that he had when he was a kid. He loved that plushie, so much that he cried for a week when he lost it once until his Aunt went out and got him a new one. It wasn’t the same but Peter had loved the new one just as much. He’d forgotten all about that and felt a desire he couldn’t resist overcome him to hug the plushie in the crib to him as tight as possible and not let go. He turned to get to the plushie as quick as possible, letting go of the side of the crib in his haste, but in his eagerness to get to the plushie he forgot about his jelly legs situation and started to fall back. His head smacked against the other side of the bars as he fell. He let out a shout of pain as he went down that came out more as a whine, clutching his head when he finally hit the mattress. That
Peter let his Mama dry and diaper him, not putting up a fight this time, not even when cream was smeared on his penis and bottom. He did blush at it though, which caught his Mama’s notice.
“In here Pete.” Peter went into the living room where his Dad was, dropping his bag at the door on the way. He’d pick it up later.
“Damn yourself. If Bruce hadn’t of come in I would have lasted way longer.” The feeling of humiliation for his science bro to be watching had him so close to the edge he couldn’t help it.
Bruce had to hide his grin. Peter was such a sensitive boy, he knew that Peter thought he’d insulted him or hurt his feelings and that would devastate him. Bruce stopped him before he could wind himself up too much.
“Ah.” His Mama said as if that explained it all. Peter was relieved, thank god his Mama was a genius. “You remember the old world floors? When we woke up here the carpet was here. It’s for you and Clint and Bucky. Don’t want to hurt yourself when you’re playing. Marble isn’t the best flooring for little kids, so Daddy says.”
“Right, let’s get you a bit relaxed. Look over at Tony and how good he’s being.” Bucky murmured and Clint couldn’t help that his gaze went over to Tony who was laying placidly against Steve, milking his knot as Steve was stroking his cock. Clint kind of felt bad the other Omega. He knew how many times he came in the last hour. It had to be bordering on painful for him but Tony looked completely relaxed and blissed out, only squirming slightly every so often and settling down once Steve spoke quietly in his ear. Steve for his part didn’t take his eyes off Clint, still looking like he was pissed at Clint for lying. Clint looked away from his penetrating gaze and focused back into Tony’s softer, more understanding gaze. One look from Tony conveyed sympathy to what he was going through and why wouldn’t it? Tony had to live with being an Omega as well. He knew what it was like, and he’d just mated with a traditionalist which was something Clint didn’t think he’d ever be brave enough to do.
“Well, that pretty much lets us know doesn’t it?” Tony said to Steve while he worked Bucky’s legs out of the sleeper while Bucky knocked the blocks together.
“Mama.” He sobbed out. His heart was racing and he couldn’t stop it. Why did Friday have to be so mean? Luckily his Mama had the car door opened and unhooked the harness straight away so he could cuddle him a little bit.
“Sure does. We’ll just get the confirmation and then go get some food before heading home I’d say the little guys are going to be hungry and tired soon.”
“Sorry Papa, I was just so excited to go home so we could get ready!” Peter’s voice was muffled in his Papa’s chest but he didn’t care. He loved hugs off the man.
PS: I think May is making you some get well cookies. I’ll try to get rid of them before they’re delivered. Sorry, Uncle Ben did all the cooking before.
Counselor Laura: I don't know if you will be so happy when you read the files, but I'm glad to help.
“Yes, and now he’s around fire and marshmallows, so I do have to get out there. I hoped that Spidey Senior would be being a great role model but he’s probably using his webbing right now to kidnap chocolate pieces. I will chat with you in a few days. Love you,” Tony blew a kiss at him.
Me: I have no trouble if you wake me up in the middle of the night. Especially if you are shirtless.  I love you, shirtless.
“It’s safe in a pocket dimension. So instead of being ripped out of Vision's head in front of Wanda after she's forced to destroy the stone, we can just keep it secure in a top-secret location. I don’t even know where my cousin stashed it.” Afia explained.
Ana Junior: Yes. It will be transferred to your server. Afia would also like to know if she can go over to Ned’s tonight.
“He literally went through the universe for me. I should be willing to do the same for him,” Simmons tried to grab the book again but was stopped.
Anthony: Also I feel like Agent Scary has a chance to keep me from drinking where Agent Carter Junior will just give me a reason to drink.
Red phone: It's just chemistry which I happen to have a PhD in. My lab experience relates well to making perfume, much better than cooking anyway. I developed the Iron Man fragrance myself.
Steve feels gentle lips press against him as he opens his eyes to see Tony. Everything is still dark which doesn’t surprise Steve because the clock says 3:22 AM.
Girl Friday: You went to a UN environmental conference just to have a chance to hook up with dad. Don’t say otherwise because I was the one who booked the hotel rooms.
Me: I really hope your Tony-bear doesn’t find out about this. He’ll kill us all because we let you go on a mission by yourself.
Anthony love: PS: Still sober, but we did send Hunter out to get more of the Ben & Jerry’s Capt. America pie and Agent America salted caramel swirl. I may have had 2 pints. This is better for my liver, but not necessarily for my waistline. Will you still love me if I’m not a size 2?
Agent M: I do. I don’t know about the former boss. It doesn’t matter. He’s not in charge now. Red Malibu isn’t even really in a coma, the doctors are just keeping him sedated to help him recover faster.
“I’ve been essentially functioning as an intermediary between the two of you for the last five years and I need you to work through your problems. We need him to have a chance. Simmons is not well, and Bruce doesn’t completely understand what he’s doing. Deke almost knew what he was doing, but he’s missing now. I don’t like saying this, but Morgan’s dad is our only hope right now.”
T Stark: So I got your voicemails. I realize that we need to talk about a lot of things regarding your nephew.
Me: Number 624. I know your planes are fast, but I didn’t think they were that fast unless your private plane is really a Quinjet.
Red phone: Vision isn’t there to remind me of the Ultron fuck up or for me to see him pine over Wanda.
The Mechanic: I decided if we are going to have this conversation. It probably should be on a more encrypted line. Actually, did you talk to your nephew about his extracurriculars or was there just a lot of yelling. Benjamin’s voicemails were panicky.
Virginia arrived in her kitchen, fully dressed for her 9 AM business meeting. She’s hoping she can convince Tony and Steve to keep the kids until at least 11 AM because she needs Kevin in the meeting with her. She would have mentioned the meeting last night if she knew about it. But it ended up on her calendar overnight.
Me: Good calls since the creator of the Tony Stark gay sex tape was involved. Pepper is the best romantic relationship I’ve ever had and that still ended in tears, mostly mine.
Thank you for getting everything together on such short notice. You should probably send up at least the level one chocolate basket to the night HR team. The hotel idea was good, but Rio isn’t quite ready for it yet. Understandable. Everything is changing. Although just in case the husband turns out to be more problematic than we think, could you hire a private detective to keep an eye on things? I kind of would like proof if he’s really undercover or just a bigoted asshole. I would like Spidey Jr. not to end up with daddy issues like me.
Anthony: I remember everything from when it happened. Aunt Peggy picked me up from school which should’ve been the first sign something was wrong. She got me ice cream and then we ended up spending the night at some big fancy hotel that I can’t even remember the name of. Although I do remember guards being outside. That should have been sign number two that something was really wrong.
The boss: There always is. Contrary to what we thought, the monolith blast didn't kill Fitz 1. It caused him to go back in time. Because he decided to try to stop the impending apocalypse, he created a new timeline.
Steve, slowly ran down Tony's back until he reached his butt then searched into his pocket and felt something peculiar.
The ticking of the clock passed and without realizing it, three whole minutes passed. When he separated from Tony, his lips throbbed under the warm coffee aroma.
"Steve ...?" His voice sounded incredibly convulsive, as if he were naked in the middle of the north pole.
Tony dropped his shirt and surrounded Steve with his arms, the soldier automatically did the same. Skin to skin, they shared warmth, love and complicity in a single hug. Between them a simple gesture always meant thousands of things.
Steve pretended not to notice his boyfriend sucking the same fingers he used to touch his own cock seconds ago.
The scientist smiled inches from his ear. "But Cap, I'm not doing anything, you deliberately and without unspoken permission began to abuse my hands." He kissed his neck. “Not that I mind, of course,”
Anything was a perfect excuse to have steamy sex all over the place. And boy it was steamy, they could not form a complete sentence without the other interrupting the conversation with a passionate kiss.
And it was the song they used to hide their moans and gasps from the others every time they visited the house in Malibu.
Tony had assumed that Steve had answered him asleep, submerged in a deep dream, he didn't think he would actually be listening.
"I don't understand why that shirt is so important. You just can't go to your apartment and look for a new one?" Tony suggested.
For some reason, for Steve the post-coital silence felt even more intimate than the very sexual act itself. Tony did that tender thing where he rested his cheek against his chest and pretended not to breathe his skin while Steve stroked his hair.
Steve slipped into the iron man's hands as he enjoyed the familiar feeling of being between his fingers.
After that, for several ticks of the clock, they remained inert on each other, occasionally planting soft kisses here and there.
Steve did not answer and continued searching under each surface of the room. Tony sighed, ignoring the bitter feeling inside his chest.
He loved that soldier out of time, he loved him with everything he had and would love him even after death.
Steve knelt in front of the sofa and with both hands under the base lifted him off the floor, unsuccessfully looking for his lost shirt while Tony's eyes enjoyed his muscular back. Slowly, he put his hand under his pants, took his own cock firmly and began to stroke it.
“That was where I knew you were the perfect man for me, you were willing to die to protect us all, that's something that made me admire you and being about to lose you made me realize that I could not bear to live without you.”
“You can't touch me, no caresses, nor pinches, nor spanks,” He took a quick look at the clock on the wall. “I don't have much time and you know how I get when your hands are on me.”
Tony gave him one last kiss on the lips and backed away. He walked to the sink where his pants laid.
In a blink, Tony's pants were on the other side of the kitchen, his back was against the bar and Steve's cock was pressed against his.
Tony recognized that direction, that was the street where he fell from the sky after launching a missile into a huge interdimensional black hole, almost dying in the process.
At three in the morning, Tony circled Steve's torso with his arms, stuck his lips against his neck and whispered against his skin.
The last time Steve Rogers wore a Tony Stark shirt, his huge super soldier muscles completely ripped the cloth halfway through a public event, Steve ended up bare chested in front of a major worldwide press conference. Tony had never heard so many people sigh at the same time.
"You also have a dutty as my man (diagonal sex toy) in here," Tony's eyes descended to the soldier's crotch. “... Preferably without a suit,”
Tony shrugged. “Then I guess this will have to be the exception. Of course, you could go to SHIELD just like this…”
“Tony, I'm trying to find my shirt and I can't do that when you're touching yourself while ... you look at me that way.” Steve couldn't resist Tony, much less when the millionaire was horny and shirtless, touching himself with his eyes full of lust.
He tried to do it slowly, he didn't want to generate any friction sound or let out a groan that revealed his inappropriate behavior. But it was useless, his cock was already creamy and soaked under his Jeans and Steve's super ear could hear every caress from the living room.
“Tony, you are my best friend, my metallic heart, you are my movie marathon buddy.” He spoke fast, obviously nervous. “You are everything to me.”
Steve sighed. “When I met you, I thought you were a jerk, stubborn and bossy, but after all this time, after everything we've been through, I've learned…” He grinned from ear to ear. “That I was right.”
Tony sang it for Steve when he had nightmares during the nights, while stroking his hair until he was sleeping again.
“I don't have time to go to my apartment, take a shirt, cross the city and get to SHIELD's building at the agreed time, much less with New York traffic.-
So committed and firm, it was the quality that Tony loved most about Steve, and at the same time the one that drove him crazy the most.
Hunger in his eyes, blush on his cheeks, Steve was in "sexual beast mode” and being so close to his face, Tony could see in the reflection of his pupils, that he himself was exactly the same.
And although Tony knew exactly where he was hiding, he didn't plan on telling him, at least not for now.
Steve had an important conference at SHIELD offices in less than an hour, so finding that shirt represented an emergency. Remembering where it was was going to be a difficult task.
Steve could debate that, but he was too horny to come up with a valid argument. Instead he brought his lips to Tony's.
“Of course,” The most mischievous of smiles, was drawn on the scientist's face “In exchange for something,”
Tony closed his eyes. If he looked at the need in Steve's eyes, he would cum instantly. He wanted to avoid it as much as he could, and it worked at first, but Steve's erotic images clouded his mind.
“I lied to you for months, I never felt that moving with you was too soon, when it comes to you, nothing seems too soon and when I considered your offer, when I thought about moving to this place with you,” He swallowed, looked at the ceiling and then Tony "I realized that I not only wanted to move into your home, I wanted to move into your life, I wanted to stay with you."
They explored their bodies as if it were the first time, hungry caressed each muscle, each corner and each edge, their lips seemed to be glued with industrial glue, they were so close together that it was difficult to distinguish where Tony's skin began and where it ended Steve
“After proposing, we were going to dance the song until we got tired, I went to dance classes for months to show off in front of you.” Steve confessed with a nervous smile.
He could find hidden terrorists, missing criminals, even his alleged dead best friend, but he couldn't find his damn shirt anywhere.
Tony discreetly kicked Steve's shirt with his bare foot, hiding it even further under the kitchen bar.
Together, they stroked their desire with speed as they moved their hips to the rhythm of their beats. They weren't going to last long, they were aware of it.
“They were going to play it while I guided you through an entire street full of candles to a table where we would have dinner and finally I would kneel in front of you and propose to you.”
The scientist was certain that it was going to be a really interesting kiss. When facing Tony, Steve ran his body from head to toe with his eyes, shivering in silence for so much desire. He leaned forward and Tony anxiously awaited the arrival of his lips.
The blond walked to the kitchen and rested his fists on the bar in front of the scientist, marked veins on his forearms and tense muscles under his skin; at that moment, Tony had the most painful erection under his pants. It felt like having solid concrete under his meat.
“Cap, I can still taste your cum in my mouth and less than an hour ago I was cumming inside you. Really, do you still think moving here is too soon?”
Tony shook his head. “The deal was the shirt in exchange for a quick kiss, that definitely was not a quick kiss, you'll have to give me another,”
"I guess after that, you definitely deserve your shirt back, big guy." Tony said as he pulled up his pants.
It was always like that between them, as soon as they were alone, the clothes flew out of their bodies and any nearby surface became a bed for them. So that freaking shirt could be anywhere in the suite.
"You know, that wouldn't be a problem if you stopped being so stubborn and agreed to move here with me," Tony muttered against his cup of coffee.
They looked into each other's eyes, through tears, through the intense love that could be breathed between them, through a perpetual "Until death do us part," they observed each other's soul through their eyes
There was a trick, with Tony Stark there was always a hidden trap under any circumstances, small letters between smaller letters; he knew him well, the billionaire liked to have control all the time ... just as Steve did.
“Stay with me Steve, stay here, I'll be good, I'll be good with you, I'll pretend that your jokes of the fifties are funny, I'll let you be bossy all day and I'll help you understand all the pop culture references, just ...- He kissed his neck. “... Just stay with me.”
The desperate desire in his voice was enough to keep him quiet while Tony released his throbbing cock out of his fabric prison.
Tony could notice the improvement in Steve's dance, he imagined him in dance classes, practicing every afternoon, striving to improve on something that was not given to him naturally, it melted his heart and caused him an immeasurable tenderness.
Ecstasy seized their bodies and finally culminated in their desire. Intense, strong, fucking fantastic.
“But Cap, you know very well …” He squeezed both buttocks. “... that I'm not a fucking soldier,” He started kissing his neck. “Let me be the villain who does bad things to you all day,”
The day before had been their pre-Valentine sexual feast. It was a tradition they both shared to celebrate important moments with some sex.
Tony shamelessly checked out Steve's torso. The soldier still had teeth marks around his nipples, neck and hips, hickies scattered all over his back, and Tony was pretty sure that if he got close enough, he could smell himself impregnated in his skin. At that point the front of his pants were soaked in precum.
They danced it slowly on the roof of the tower, with Steve in his arms and Tony's head against her shoulder, they repeated it again and again, they rocked all over the place letting themselves be carried away by the music.
This time Tony started the kiss and as expected, it wasn't short either. It was desperate, vulgar, almost violent, Steve's tongue tickled Tony's palate and the scientist could not be more fascinated about it.
-I don't understand what's your obsession with finding that shirt, when I have hundreds of flexible t-shirts that can...-
Tony focused his attention on the small ring between his fingers and shook his head. “A marriage proposal on Valentine's Day, who would say you could be so cheesy.”
“You know …” Tony began to speak in a playful tone while he passed the cup from hand to hand distractedly. “I may know where your shirt is,”
The heels of his shoes sounded peculiarly loud, Tony put the cup on the bar and focused his attention on the body of his boyfriend who slowly approached towards him. With every step he took, Tony's smile grew bigger.
The scientist could easily send an android to bring him a clean shirt and that would take no more than a couple of minutes, but that would take the fun out of the situation, he decided to play a little with Steve first.
“Extremely weird, Agent Fitzsimmons. You can help yourself to the kitchen down here.” Shuri pointed to a room down the hall.
"At this point, I want to know what my other self did to have Jane force him to do these questions. Friday, sweetie pie, do you have an answer?” Tony asked the AI.
Venom: Ice cream is good. I would’ve gained so much weight this year if we weren’t working out together.
Me: Yep, unsuccessfully, but they still tried. Thankfully, they don’t have the votes even with the new kid showing up. Of course, they didn’t find out about her until after the vote, but whatever. They want to bring in some Hammer Industries refugee to take my place as CCO.
Me: You’re right. No new incidents. The counselor is doing a good job of keeping me in one piece. Although, I miss Red. But she’s young and has been through so much. I feel like she deserves something normal.
Tony: Sometime last night, apparently. That’s why I’m going to be in DC for a while lobbying against it. I have to protect my kids.
Cuddle fiancé: Robbie did with his chain through the representative’s heart. Apparently, they just wanted to strip all of Earth’s resources before Thanos arrived to kill us all. He has quite the reputation of conquering planets and killing half the inhabitants.
“That sounds like a lot of my adult friendships.” Her old friendships back at the farmhouse before she became an agent herself that is. It wasn’t exactly like she could tell them what her husband did for a living. Also, most of her friendships now are with people who are Avengers, Shield agents, or the parents of kids with superpowers.
The song mentioned in this chapter is Closing Time by Semisonic. This is where our conversation title comes from.
Tony Potts: So we've been thinking of doing this with a suit, so we would need particles for each person, but what if we could bring a ship. Then maybe we could bring all the kids here while we're dealing with the purple ass hole. Friday did send over Deke's jump drive work, and I think the team in 2018 can work with that.
HSBF:  I don’t really sing to myself. Although, I have sung to James. People in comas can hear you when you speak to them. So I thought I would try the last time I saw him. Just an old lullaby from when we were kids. Although it’s been a few months. I haven’t seen him since we started talking to one another. My work has been keeping me away, though.
Me: Because you’re AWOL, Coulson is lobbying for somebody with powers to be the new boss to alleviate public panic. Others are lobbying for someone that will get rid of the problem. Enhanced person internment camps, here we come.
Number one May: Okay, now I really want to know what is happening. Tony asked if it’s okay if you stay home from school Monday. He also wants to send Miles and me to his secluded island until at least mid-May. Is this an Avenger thing? Are aliens invading again?
MayMQ: And now you understand why Clint was so mad at you. I always felt that not telling the Avengers was stupid, especially the one that was your ex-boyfriend.
CoulsonPJ: Which is why you got a nice card for the baby blanket and I am currently trying out Fitz’s attempt at a dermal regenerator. We have to stop letting him and Stark create prototypes after watching Star Trek
Me: I think I might have to do some East Coast stuff. Probably Good Morning America because I like Michael Strahan more than the alternatives at the other networks and maybe Jimmy Fallon.
Tony Potts: It’s an opiate, and we had some problems with the opiate family after our parents died. Which may have led to that fucking sex tape with Tiberius. NyQuil contains our drug of choice, so that is definitely out.
Me: I think she’s right. Looking back on it, if I told you all about my plans to restart the Ultron security project somebody would have tranquilized me before I created a murder bot.
HSBF:  I wish this was a video call so you could see my skeptical face right now. No changing the subject just because you don’t want to answer.
Cuddle Bunny: Sorry, I would’ve texted you earlier, but it took me a couple of days to find out where Clint put my phone. He hid the thing in the ventilation vents.
After being married to a Shield agent for well over a decade and now being an agent herself for over a year, Laura has seen a lot of crazy stuff. However, having her estranged husband show up unexpectedly in her apartment at the Avenger compound was not something she was expecting at all.
Hunter: Too late. Leo has been second-guessing his choices since he got here. What do you think led to his extended stay in mental health rehab? Or the fact that he had to take the Stark industries job because it would be less stressful.
Cousin Q: You know I’m regretting not being in Mumbai right now with my girlfriend. I’m going to strangle Leo’s husband. Why did Leo bring him on this mission?
The way you talk about all your kids, it doesn’t surprise me that you were happy that somebody thought that Benjamin was your actual son. You know you should consider adoption or fostering, despite your doubts. I know you mentioned something before about kids with powers ending up in the system. Maybe when your health is 100% you can look into it. I don’t think you’ll be rejected like you think you will be.
“The art helps, along with some of the techniques that the elders have been showing her. I’ve been trying to work on a device that will give her more control over her powers, but I haven’t been successful yet.” Tony turned his attention back to the picture the Princess is pointing to.
After being helped by your team, I feel like I should write you. Okay, my therapist is making me send out these letters (through Friday because I’m not a complete idiot), but I feel like I owe you one too.
“See, this question is weird for me since this is pretty much what happened when I was an idiot and got my Malibu house blown up."
Me: You’re right about that. I’ll talk with Agent America and Yo-Yo about it when we’re in Johannesburg. Or maybe on the flight to Johannesburg. Three more days. You have no idea how much I need to be with you right now. I actually cried.
Tony: Good news. Benji has a new BFF. There was a lot of binging on Halloween candy involved. The Princess genius likes the jack-o’-lantern peeps. She’s taking a case home with her.
FRIDAY: He respects Agent May greatly and is slightly terrified of her. Also Mr. Stark’s dislike of Sharon Carter is related to the fact that Carter was out of the country when her mother passed of complications of cancer six years ago. Agent Carter’s mother was a friend of Mr. Stark from his time at MIT.
Tony Potts: That is very true. Steve Rogers is very complicated. But maybe if one version of me figured it out, I can too.
Also, as a reminder I will be posting chapters either early in the morning before work, during my lunch break, or on the weekends. It’s probably a good idea to add this story to your alerts.
Me: Historically, Thanksgiving was another corporate event growing up. I never really had a family thing and unlike Christmas, I couldn’t crash at aunt Peggy’s for something that resembled a family event. Also, I had Hanukkah with Ana and Jarvis, so again an actual family like actual celebration. Even after the boarding school years began and it was just me and Jarvis keeping Ana’s traditions alive. Once he was gone, it just felt wrong to do it without him.
T Stark: I‘m pragmatic. This is going to be a tough conversation. So should I tell the lawyers to work on the defense against kidnapping? They’re going to be so pissed at me for contacting you without them being in the room.
“Because May lives on a government base and I just finished up by Lake Ontario. You were closer. Also, you can bring me to Steve and he needs me more. Especially, when you tell him he can’t visit his best friend that starting to remember who he is again.” Tony sighed at her words and really wishes that Monkey Lover didn’t tell Romanoff anything. Also really wishes that the conversation where he found out about Barnes didn’t happen in front of Monkey Lover, but apparently he is friends with the royal genius. They’ve collaborated in the past. Apparently, Romanoff was another accomplice in whatever secret plan was going on between everybody. Obviously, there was a lot going on that he didn’t know about.
"Sometimes in life we all have to do things that we don’t want to do.” Steve told him as he gave him one last gentle touch of lips before pushing him towards Melinda.
“Maybe. I think I like the next question better. We are supposed to alternate sharing positive characteristics of one another.” This one didn’t seem like an emotional landmine waiting to go off unless Steve can’t come up with any positive qualities about him.
We have another shield IM chapter because Tony is kind of sort of driving Yo-Yo and May a little crazy. This is happening because he’s in the love bubble and though the rational part of his brain knows it’s for the best that he doesn’t climb Steve like a tree, he is still a little resentful.
Genius Princess: The Bulletproof Pacifist should be able to along with Vision. He may even be able to reassemble it. Please secure the object in my lab. I think I’ll be back by next Saturday. I may even bring some guess because their spring break is coming soon.
Peter leaned in to his Dad, rolling his eyes at how happy he sounded. “True, but now I’ll be the talk of the school and you just know reporters will have my picture before the end of the day as well.” Peter thought of something that would annoy the media to no end,
Peter huffed but sat down into it. It was really soft. He’d give his Dad points for that; it was way comfier than regular seats in the car.
Tony hummed, still rocking him as Bucky sniffled into his neck. “Can you get me a bottle for him? Maybe he doesn’t want to eat. I’m sure Peter would like applesauce.”
“Why?” Tony didn’t need to ask more, Peter was well aware of what he was asking without having to elaborate.
“Eh- Well something actually happened.” Peter pulled back from the cuddle and studied his Dad. If he said something happened that meant during his heat, which would mean he was mated. His eyes flickered to the side of his neck and he let out an involuntary gasp.
Peter nodded and looked out the window, surprised when he saw the Avengers tower in front of him. He didn’t realise they had gotten there so quick. Peter was just glad he didn’t fall asleep on the way home like he usually did.
The arms around him became heavier and Clint nearly purred in pleasure. He could hear Steve, or was it, Bruce? Talking about Omega drop and putting more pressure in the hold. He wasn’t sure what an Omega drop was but he could really get on board with this whole pressure thing. It was one of the best things he’d ever felt. He turned his head to the side so that it was resting against what he assumed was a chest. It didn’t matter who owned it though, once they didn’t stop holding him. If they stopped he was sure he would float away forever. He pressed himself closer in at the thoughts of it. Not wanting to go. It was a nice feeling but he had no control and this felt way better. Maybe he could stay here forever and Bruce wouldn’t have to test him and everything would be okay? Yeah. That would work.
) he became his Omega. The first ‘rule’ made Tony simultaneously hot and then cold. He wanted Tony naked at all times around the tower. Tony wasn’t a prude by any means but come on! When he pointed out that he worked with open flames a lot of the time, Steve conceded and said that he could wear one of his shirts. He was a saint really. He also said something about training but Tony had stopped listening and fled the room out of sheer embarrassment from the first one. He heard comments from Bruce and Clint about bashful Omegas. Him, bashful, as if!
“Here. What’s so special about the blue box?” Clint asked, watching intently as Steve began to unlock it.
“We’ll have to be quick. Peter’s room is a bit away but he could be back any minute. I need to take the edge off. Don’t come.” Steve punctuated each word with a thrust. He quickly realised that Tony riding him wasn’t going to get him to come quickly. He gave his ass a smack and pulled Tony off of him, directing him over the arm of the couch. He wasted no time fucking back into him. Using him hard and quick, pulling him back to meet his thrusts, the wet slap of skin on skin furthering his arousal. He brought one hand down to hold onto Tony’s cock, murmuring his approval as he swirled his thumb in the slit, smiling when he heard Tony’s whine.
“I call him Jamie?” That could be his own personal nickname for Bucky. No one else would be allowed to call him that.
Tony parked up, but kept the car running, Peter would be sure to wake up if it was turned off. Raising the music a little, Tony jammed along to all the rock classics, taking a minute to take a picture of Peter and send it to Steve. He got a response straight away of three heart emoji.
Peter’s eyes widened in disbelief, his Dad was letting him have chocolate? This must be his lucky day!
Peter nodded against his chest. “Uh-huh. Mama told me. You’re an adult. The rules are different. I just didn’t know. I’m sorry Harley.”
They wouldn’t even mind if Peter was being bratty about it because they’d be able to deal with that, it was how heart-broken he seemed whenever Tony told him no or didn’t pay attention to him.
“Do you not like being our child?” Tony asked quietly, his one fear coming out as he washed Peter. Peter’s gaze jumped to his in alarm.
Mr Stark walked down the hall from the room they were in and Peter looked around curiously, this looked like Mr Starks private quarters. Peter had woken up a few times in Mr Starks guest room when he’d fallen asleep in the tower so he vaguely recognised it. As they got closer to the common area he could hear voices, that freaked him out slightly and he turned his head back into Mr Stark’s neck. He knew it was safe there and that he would protect him. The action got him a pat on his bottom. He knew the second there were in the common area because the conversation stopped.
Tony looked from Bucky to Peter and back again, “You two and anyone else that fought against Thanos and disappeared the first time didn’t have a clue what we were talking about when we made sense of this place. We decided to wait to see if you got your memories back and if not go on as we were. I’m not sure why you got them back now, after nearly a year without having them but maybe it was just delayed in coming back to you, who knows.” Tony shrugged at that, as is mentally getting rid of that line of questioning from his head.
“Friday, can you call Bucky and Bruce in please?” He asked as he undid the button and zipper of his jeans, letting his hard cock spring out. “Come here sweetheart.” He made sure the dildo was still suctioned to the chair before lifting Tony off it. He smiled as he heard his groan. Steve had found out fairly quickly that Tony hated the empty feeling during his heat. He wasted no time positioning himself so that he could slide straight into Tony to the hilt. He didn’t bother to fuck him too much, just enough to get his knot to lock them together. He wanted Tony to be aware of what was happening. He felt more than heard Tony’s dry orgasm as he writhed on Steve’s lap in pleasure. Clint was still looking on, extremely pale and shaking slightly. He opened his mouth to talk but was silenced with a look from Steve.
“Sure baby, let’s take a photo together and post it. Let me see what your caption is before it goes up though.”
Steve rolled his eyes at the little boy but allowed for Tony to take him back. It was a common theme in their house, when one of them gave out to Peter he would go to the other and be extra affectionate with them. It seemed that getting his memory back wasn’t changing his overall little personality which was interesting. He was sure Tony had already come up with ten different theories as to why.
Steve rubbed his back but didn’t argue with him. Thankfully Cho came back in before Peter could continue to whine.
He was just about the leave the room when he caught sight of his Ironman plushie. He knew he should go out there by himself but he needed the extra support. Surely they wouldn’t think he was little because he had a plushie with him? He was only bringing him because it went with his T-shirt. His Mama and Dada couldn’t argue that.
Tony squawked. “Steve, no. I have so much to do this week and Pepper will literally kill me if I don’t do it. Do you want me to die?”
“Looks like you gave yourself quite the bump but you’ll be okay. Now I think I promised one brave little boy a cookie did I not?”
“I really am sorry sweetheart.” He said, sliding his hand up and down slowly. “Normally I only want you to come by my cock in and nothing else but this once I’ll treat you to show you how sorry I am.”
Clint and Steve both cringed at the threat and Clint found it interesting that Steve didn’t give out to him over the threat. Tony must be able to get away with some things.
“I do that?” Peter was amazed. He made Bucky be little and happy when he was trying to hide it. And Bucky is younger than him? That was so
“Thank you.” Bruce took the papers back and took out a new sheet of blank paper and readied his pen. “Now why don’t you start from the beginning and tell us everything that lead to this point?”
“There is one good thing that came of it. Bucky and Peter are more comfortable in their roles of being littles, at least. Before they got sick, both of them were fighting tooth and nail. Being sick seems to have secured them into it. Saves a lot of hassle, really.” Tony took another sip of his coffee, enjoying the bitter taste.
“Yes. We’re going and that’s it.” Steve’s tone was final but that didn’t stop Tony from shaking his head.
He unbuckled him quickly and slid his arms out of the belt, bringing him over the buggy that Tony had set up, rolling his eyes fondly when he saw another blanket where the headrest was.
Sam bit his lip at the excitable child. Tony and Steve looked a mix between resigned and embarrassed. “I think that they look very real as well. You’re going to clean up in trick or treating tonight. All of you.” He laughed. “Where’s your bucket, Pete? I think Nat has a surprise for you.”
“Yo Penis! Where are you off to in such a hurry? It’s not like anyone is waiting at home for you.” He said, standing directly in front of Peter.
“Ironman, ‘m all alone.” He wailed, sitting down on the ground. He didn’t want to be big if he was going to be alone. He was so lost in his upset that he didn’t see Tony and Steve rushing into the living room from the kitchen.
“Hi, Papa! I missed you!” He said, cuddling into him, sighing happily when he Papa squeezed him back.
gotten Peter into the car seat and Friday had to open her mouth when Peter touched the harness. Okay, so Tony should have told her to withhold her usual protocols as Peter was just exploring it for what was the first time to him, but really! She was one of the most intuitive AI’s he’d ever created and then she goes and does something incredibly stupid.
“Hi, we have an appointment for 2?” Tony said, bouncing Peter when he hid in his neck. Behind him, Steve was still trying to keep Bucky calm. He was doing little half cries, half whines.
“That’s good enough for me. How long till we’re there?” Peter asked, gazing out the window as they drove through Queens.
“Clint has been lying about his classification. He’s not a lesser Alpha like we were lead to believe.” Bruce, Bucky, and Tony’s head’s all whipped to Clint. Bruce and Bucky stared on in shock while Tony spluttered out questions.
Steve smiled over Tony’s head, not stopping in his stroking, unperturbed over Tony’s squirming. “You’re timing is great as usual Buck, only you’d make it in for the grand finale. Just leave that on the dresser, I’ll get Tony fed in a while seeing as my Knot is finally coming down.”
“You. And your brother, but he was still pretending that he was neutral. We kept an eye on him and let him away with it until his other memories came in. You two were the last ones we were waiting on. You and Bucky took a lot of my time because the two of you needed me and Dada so much, we barely had time to think about what happened. When we finally did I realise that I was happy we were here. There was no stress, none of the fear about you getting hurt because Little’s are so protected here.” Tony held his hand up when Peter began to refute his knowledge. “Let me finish little man. I need you to know that you still go to school. All your memories from living in this timeline are still there you just haven’t searched for them because you were afraid to see.”
“Dad! How could you! You promised!” Peter pouted up at him. Tony glanced at Steve and saw him shaking his head as if he didn’t ask Tony to say it to Bruce while he said it to Bucky.
“Anyway, the entity said to us that with the destruction of the stone the earth would return back to before Thanos but it wouldn’t be without its own consequences. Obviously, we asked what they would be. More out of curiosity than anything else because we were always going to take the option where everyone gets to live no matter the consequences.” He rushed to reassure when Peter looked at him with a pout. “She told us that while she didn’t agree with Thanos’s method she did agree that a lot of the universe was in disarray and something needed to be done about it. While this didn’t help with the supposed overpopulation it did bring in a system that worked and made the order a common thing. The way the entity explained it was that everyone has a secondary personality in them, which in what we refer to now as the WBT or the world before Thanos, that comes out as personality traits that make up the whole person. So for example in the WBT, we’ve come to the conclusion that no matter how strange of a way I showed it, I was always taking care of people. Building the compound, fixing armour and making new ones, keeping certain baby spiders safe.” He tickled Peter slightly who giggled at the fingers dancing across his ribcage.
“No way is that your cock.” He couldn’t help himself. Looking at something like that would give a guy a complex.
Hey so I went to see endgame and cried so much I needed something happy in my life so I updated this. Some of the questions asked were just me poking a bit of fun at the number of people that had an issue with the roughest week. Hope you like it and be sure to tell me what you think!
Peter just wanted to jump out of the car the minute it parked up and run to his Papa upstairs but he wasn’t able to undo the seatbelt until his Dad came around the car. He swung his legs impatiently until Harley and his Dad got out. He watched them laughing and joking while they got his bags from the boot. Peter narrowed his eyes, why would his Dad be so happy to be around Harley? Even keeping Peter in the car until they’d had their fun. He knew his Dad liked Harley more. Every time he came Peter always struggled to get his attention and was always exhausted by the time bedtime came around. Peter wiggled, wanting to get up to his Papa as quick as possible and away from the two of them ignoring him.
Peter hopped out of the car and took the hand his Dad held out to his begrudgingly, not saying anything while Harley and his Dad talked about their plans for the weekend, again not asking Peter his opinion at all. Peter supposed it didn’t matter because obviously they didn’t want him there either way. He stayed quiet the whole way up to their floor, not seeing Tony and Harley’s glances at him or the quiet conversation they had over his head.
Peter glanced at the clock, ugh, he had another 2 hours of classes and all he wanted to do was go home and play with his Lego set or his switch.
“Would you be able to bring some heat snacks in for us? As well as a lot of water, knowing Tony he hasn’t drunk much water at all leading up to this.”
Then he felt arms coming around him. Grounding him. Making him come back when he didn’t want to. The voices that were like a white noise into his ringing ears earlier were now getting louder and more insistent. He could hear the panic in them. Wait. Wasn’t he supposed to be the ones panicking? Not the Alphas. Why were they panicking?
Tony just sat down when Bucky let out another cry, this time more insistent and a lot louder. “Okay, okay, let’s swap. Peter honey, you stand there for a minute and Daddy will take you.”
“I thought you were in your costume baby Stark?” Clint asked, eyeing up Peter’s iron man pyjamas. Peter was going to roll his eyes at his uncle but caught a look off of his Papa. Rolling his eyes was a big no-no and a sure way to earn him a swat and corner time.
“W-Why?” Was all Tony was able to ask. Why was Clint tied up and being fucked by a machine was what he wanted to ask but wasn’t able to get the words out?
Tony picked up the sobbing little, rocking and shushing him, knowing that they were on limited time before there was an accident. He felt for Peter, really he did. He just found himself in a new world and had no idea how to deal with his little emotions. It took Tony and Steve a while to adjust as well and they got to keep their core traits. Poor Peter was struggling with his little and big self.
“Don’t do it again. Buckle in and we’ll get going.” Peter went to do as told and then groaned when he saw it.
Peter sighed, not happy with the answer at all. “Can I just stay with you this weekend Papa? Let Harley and Mama do what they want. I’m used to people not wanting me around. It happens enough in school so I don’t care. Mama can spend time with me if he wants when Harley goes home I suppose.”
“Please do not touch the harness Peter.” Peter jumped in fright, tears pooling in his eyes. He just wanted to
“Oh I see how it is, one mention of cookies and I'm forgotten about.” He heard his new Mama say. Peter felt bad, he didn’t want him to be upset. Maybe if he got a cookie as well he’d be okay? He wasn’t so sure he’d be able to call Mr Stark Mama out loud though, it would be too embarrassing, and calling him Mr Stark might make them mad, especially if he was in a different world where he was obviously supposed to be a baby? Instead of calling him anything he settled for pointing (even though he knew it was rude and he wasn’t supposed to) and mumbling “Cookie.” Around the sucky thing in his mouth.
Hey! Look at me updating with only a day apart. I was sick all day today, had to ring into work and everything but it did give me time to write this so yay. Let me know what you think of this chapter.
“Best get yourself under control Tones, Peter will be back in a few minutes,” Steve said, putting his own cock away and zipping back up. He took the used plug and put it in the second box, to be cleaned later.
Steve rolled his eyes at his partner's antics as he put a toasted ham and cheese sandwich along with a cup of fruit in front of Peter.
The knot was keeping Tony in place while Steve stroked him so slowly that Tony felt he was going insane. He tried to arch up into it but when he did Steve stopped. “No. You just have to sit. Let me do all the work.” Tony collapse back into Steve, putting his head back against his neck so he could get comfortable.
Mama put him sitting upon his knee. “I think we should put some underwear on you, what do you think?”
“Oh my god. Clint! Clint is an omega!” Tony could vaguely remember the test in the kitchen with Bruce and Bucky but was too far gone into his heat to remember much of it. He really wished he could see Steve’s face right now but the angle was too awkward for him.
It was the same size as the other seats in the car but also had a headrest that came out at either side, padding all along it, armrests and a five-point harness that would come undone for anyone that wasn’t Peter. No matter how he looked at it, all Peter could see was a cleverly disguised car seat.
“Okay, no. That’s more than enough off everyone here. Let’s get going or all the sweets are going to be gone.”  Peter scrambled up off of Bucky and ran over to his parents, the long way through so that Sam, Clint and Thor could throw their sweets in as he went.
Bucky gestured to Steve’s hand that was still pumping Tony’s cock, “That looks counterproductive to keeping his relaxed don’t you think?”
“Shh baby, not so loud. Hey Harls.” Tony smiled, one of his smiles that he reserved for family only, one that lit up his eyes.
Tony knew Peter loved Harley. Loved having him around. Peter had never given any inclination that he didn’t. Now Tony had to wonder if every time Harley came around he was jealous, not because Harley was bigger than him, but because he felt like Harley would come one day and just take Tony away from him. His poor baby was living with that fear every time he saw Harley. It was no wonder he asked Tony to sleep with him every night. Now he didn’t even want to see him. By the look on Harley’s face, he felt just as bad as Tony did. Both of them looked up when they heard Steve’s footsteps.
Harley shrugged. “I cancelled on them. I’m extended my trip to a week instead of the weekend so I’ll go see them when you’re in school. I’d rather hang out with you.”
Tony hated that they weren’t softer, stating that Bucky and Peter deserved only the best. Knowing Tony he had a new model in his lab with a headrest of the littles.
“We’ll talk about that tomorrow when Pete gets here. Until then, come here.” Steve clicked his fingers and pointed in front of him. Tony dragged his feet over, not happy with the way this was going. When he got in front of him Steve turned him around and took hold of the plug in him fucking it in and out of his wet hole while he undid the zip of his jeans with the other, taking his hard cock out.
Peter turned his phone off and decided to go back into his parents and wait for a while to see if he got any followers.
“I think it’s time to go home sweetheart. Your bucket is about to overflow. Let Mama take it for you. He can carry it.” Before Peter could protest Tony took the bucket off of him.
He always kept Peter’s phone during school hours so he wouldn’t be distracted, he knew that Peter could use the laptop he brought with him every day but it was monitored by FRIDAY, unlike his phone which was monitored by KAREN, who was way more inclined to cover up for Peter.
“Bend over.” Said Steve, holding a plug for Tony in his hand after getting himself dressed to go visit Bucky and Clint.
“Aunt Nat. Trick or treat.” He said again, putting his bucket out more forcefully, staring back at her with determination in his doe eyes.
“Do you think Bucky will be upset with his results?” Steve asked quietly, knowing that Bucky was not going to take well to it at all. He was denying that he was a little outright, despite all the telling signs.
Steve shook his head before Clint could give his opinion. “Here, I can’t move with Tony on me at the moment. Friday, tell everyone to stay off this floor for the next couple of hours.”
Peter couldn’t believe that they let Dr Cho stab Bucky in the butt! Weren’t they supposed to be avengers? Protecting people was literally their job and now his poor baby brother was sore. Peter couldn’t help the tears the strung to his eyes either. That needle was
Tony pouted in response but did as asked with bad grace, earning himself a swat on his backside for his troubles. He closed his eyes when he felt the plug against his still wet hole, trying not to think about how much Steve’s dominance was turning him on. It was no use though, as he felt the plug slide into him and settle against his prostate he couldn’t help but begin to rut in hope that he’d get some relief. He was rewarded with a chuckle from Steve.
He could also hear the sound of gravel crunching under far closer under him than he would have in a car.
“Uh, it’s just this engineering algorithm.” Bruce proceeded to prattle on about something Bucky, Clint and Steve had no clue about but Tony seemed to get and answered him fairly quick.
People were only beginning to file out of the exit when they got there. They made it to the gate just in time to see Harley coming through, bag slung over one of his shoulders, sunglasses perched on top of his head. Peter thought he looked like the coolest person he’d ever seen and vibrated excitedly beside his Dad until Harley was close enough. His hand was finally freed and Peter took off running into Harley’s open arms, giggling when Harley twirled him around. He heard the shutter of a camera going off and hoped it was his Dad’s and not some creep.
“Well as fun as this is to watch, I’d like some answers?” Bucky finally spoke up from where he was silently sitting the past hour waiting for Peter to wake up. He didn’t want to admit it but he was pretty tired himself and could probably do with a lie down as well. Not that he’d tell them that. It looked like Tony and Steve were one step away from treating him like Peter and that just wasn’t going to happen. He needed to know more about this world first. The memories he has of here are confusing out of context and he feels like he’s just missing a huge chunk of time.
“Want to go over your training now?” He asked after a few minutes of lying in their post orgasmic bliss. Tony made a noise that wasn’t happy but he waved his hand for Steve to go ahead.
“Does that mean I’ll have a brother? Will he be my big brother or a baby brother? Can he be my baby brother? I promise I’ll protect him!” He begged, causing Steve and Tony to laugh at the excited little.
“I know but one more and then you can relax can’t you?” Steve rubbed the sensitive head slowly until Tony nodded. He picked up the pace, bringing him to orgasm quickly. Tony tensed as he was wrung dry. Tears came into his eyes at the half pleasure half pain feeling he got from it. He slumped against Steve, completely worn out. He didn’t think it would be possible during his heat but somehow Steve was able to put it at bay finally.
The smell hit him the second he was in the living room. Tony’s flushed face pressed against Bucky’s neck nearly sent him into a rage at seeing his Omega so close to another Alpha, the only thing stopping him was the clear mating mark that was on display on his neck. Bucky opened his arms when Steve was close enough, allowing him to take Tony off his lap. Tony’s eyes fluttered open when he was moved.
Steve read out the tweets that people sent over him writing Peter’s tweet. Peter giggling with each one that he read.
“Traditional? So like he bosses you around and you don’t have a say?” Peter didn’t want that for his Dad. He was the smartest person he knew and some stupid Alpha shouldn’t dictate what he can or can’t say.
“Sure baby. You sit down beside Papa and I’ll make some dinner while the two of you answer the questions.”
Peter was shocked, he didn’t know that you could negotiate in a traditional relationship. It dawned on him that Steve told him that to show being in a traditional relationship wasn’t all just him laying down the law and he appreciated it, it did set his mind at ease a bit.
“You know it,” Steve growled in Tony’s ear as he continued to jerk him, Bucky walked out of the room, laughing as he heard Tony continue to sass. Steve really had his work cut out for him.
Tony ran a hand through Peter’s curls, “He sure did baby. I was watching the questions come in during a super boring meeting. Pepper is not happy with me.”
“It’s been a week, I’ll say that,” Steve said, leaning his head back and resting his eyes. “Both of them are finally back to normal. Peter even asked me to have a nap in my room. I think they’re over being with us all the time.”
“I’m waiting for you! I’ve to scent you so my smell would be more prominent.” He played it off. Not wanting Peter to know that had happened not ten minutes ago.
Tony snorted, Lucky you, I had to shower with Peter attached to my chest. He just stuck there and wouldn’t let go until I promised that I wouldn’t put him down. My arms have never felt a workout like it.”
“Tony you usually don’t care what others think, so why is this bothering you so much? Everyone will know anyway that you’ve been claimed by me. Does it matter if they see an extra symbol of that? I’m just using it to protect you. You know how many Alpha’s ignore claiming bites. They won’t be able to ignore the collar though.” Steve nuzzled the top of Tony’s head, trying to calm the agitated omega down. “If you really don’t want to though, I won’t force you.”
“Good sharpness to his teeth. I’d watch the Bucky.” He joked, moving on to check his ears. Checking the strength of his aids. “Are they still working okay Clint?” Clint nodded. Tony made these for him and they had to be the best ones he’s ever worn.
“Okay. Let’s head into your room and I’ll get the shower ready for you. I’ll leave fresh pyjamas ready for you on your bed as well. Make sure to clean behind those ears.” Steve teased, earning a small laugh out of Peter. It wasn’t the usual happy giggle he was used to but it would have to do. He could see Peter was trying.
“I know you will sweetheart. Now let’s get you on this dildo so we can go out and enjoy some pasta.” Steve said, finally taking the dildo out of the box. Clint’s eyes goggled at the sheer size of it. It was the same turquoise blue as the box it came in and even had Steve’s knot on it. No wonder Tony looked so blissed out when they were knotted. The thing that Steve was holding in his hand seemed monstrous.
“N-No Sir! A shirt is fine!” Even Tony knew when he was getting into risky territory. He wasn’t sure what Steve was like as an Alpha yet but he didn’t want to see if his threat would hold true.
“Nothing baby. Let’s get you home so Papa doesn’t freak out on us.” Steve hated when Peter wasn’t home if he was supposed to be. Tony never got it but let Steve off, if he wanted to see that Peter was safe that was fine with him.
“I know but you’re both okay. Will we go get some pancakes?” Peter loved pancakes and it was a sure way to win him over. Bucky wouldn’t be able to eat anything too solid. Cho told them that because of him crashing the chances of him choking was raised. She did give them a food supplement to put into his bottle instead though. Tony was going to try fob that job off to Steve. He was already in the bad books for the needles, he didn’t need to become enemy number one.
“Pete, you really have to look before you run into rooms.” Tony rolled his eyes but opened his arms for the hug he knew Peter came for. Peter gladly went into his arms, squeezing his father tightly.
Peter was well aware he was treated younger than others his age, even if he was younger than his class. Contrary to popular belief Peter did know that he was more sheltered than the average teenager. He couldn’t say he minded it though, his parents loved him and that’s what counted. They usually went off his mood anyway. Peter had often sat up later than his bedtime talking to his Dad about engineering projects he was doing along with discussing new scientific papers that came out. He might act younger but he was still his Mama’s son.
. He happily put his arms out for his new Daddy for the cookie, no way in heck was he trying to stand again after last time. He was taken up with ease and settled against his chest, snuggling in.
“You’re okay baby. It’s okay. Steve, will you get me a bottle for him. It’ll calm him down.” Steve nodded and rushed back into the kitchen, putting a bottle together in record time and handing the warm bottle to Tony who had settled with a crying Peter on the couch. Peter’s cries tapered off once he had the bottle in his mouth and was focussed on drinking it down instead of his fright.
“We don’t need a mess baby. We have a long drive home and all I have in the changing bag is your jammies.”
I've changed it from 3 chapters to unsure because I have a few more ideas for this story. Let me know what you think!
Tony stared after her, contemplating. “I like her. She was polite, didn’t draw too much attention to the kids and didn’t make eyes at either of us. Did you happen to get her name?”
Tony’s eyes narrowed at Steve, trying to figure out if he was lying. He turned back to Peter and cuddled him closer.
He could see how embarrassed Tony was by just looking at him but he would have to get over it sooner rather than later. It wouldn’t be out of the norm for Steve to go in during a meeting and fuck Tony if he wanted to. He wouldn’t, probably, but this would be good training for him to be prepared for that, in case it ever happened.
Peter’s eyes sprung open at that. He was curious to see what questions people had for him. First, he had something important to do. He jumped up off the couch and gave his Dad a hug.
Tony settled so that he could see his face while still being able to cuddle with him. “Okay guys, I suppose you need to know what happened,” He said, unsure of what to actually tell them.
Harley wanting tips was smart, Tony would help him out as much as he could but he wasn’t going to tell him everything.
was home! He was never home when Peter was. He had to see him right this minute! He barged into the living room, “Dad! You’re home!” He shouted, not realising his Dad had company until he was fully in the room. “Oops. Hey everyone.” He murmured, embarrassed at being caught acting so childish.
Mama was right. When he started talking about school the memories of being in school with Ned and MJ came back to him. “But they all know I’m a little?”
“Are you going to try to fit me for a prosthesis again?” James asked. She tried earlier but he wasn’t ready.
“Yes. Coulson is even with the new Captain America. The old one goes by Nomad now and is engaged to Stark. The wedding is on April 28. You would be invited, but Stark doesn’t have your number. Though he would like to fix that.” Hunter remarked as he threw one of the new communicators at Thor. Theoretically, the thing should be able to send text messages to earth from Asgard. It just may take a day or two. Daisy had one on her as well. It was built into her new nanotech tactical suit that was currently concealed as street clothes.
Anthony: Well we’re not at that place in our relationship and if we were, you would be flying over here to strangle me and Happy would be speaking to me again. Whatever you think, just know that Pepper will not be stepping into my bedroom anytime soon. Which is why Happy is pissed.
All of this made me realize that I am head over feet in love with you. I don’t know when it happened, but it did. I don’t even think it really was one moment. This had to be building for a while. It just took the thought of losing you to make me realize how important you are. I didn’t even get it in Siberia.
Kitty brother: That is not our path. Things have changed. I doubt that we will be battling Thanos as you remove an infinity stone from Vision’s head.
CoulsonPJ: And obviously a bad one. He completely ignored May's plan for getting the tech out of the tower undetected.
D Fitzsimmons: I guess Nana considered it, which is why she sent me back to the day I first arrived.
Blue phone: Actually, that doesn’t surprise me because I’m almost positive you play piano. There's one at every house you have.
Me: I think it will happen. Honestly you’re starting to fall off the radar of most people except for Ross and certain members of the DOD community. They are too busy with Quake, the Robin Hood bank robber, right now to worry about Nomad, freer of kidnapping victims.
We have less than two weeks before we see each other again and I’m really excited. However, I really do think Jane hates you because I finally read through the rest of the questions and a lot of these are going to be hard for you to answer or even come up with fake answers for.
Blue phone: Before the war, I was in art school. I was planning on being a cartoonist. I was working two jobs to pay for it, one of which I am sure never made the history books about me. I think I’d want to go back to art school. Maybe, I would become an elementary school art teacher, which means also majoring in education. I like kids.
Ana Junior: That is a way to look at it. Leopold Fitzimmons and James Leopold see each other as brothers rather than nearly alternate dimension counterparts.
At times I wish it was normal. I mean, now smart kids get to go to high school and college at the same time. I feel like that would’ve been better. Maybe I would’ve turned out halfway well-adjusted, if I was around people my own age at least part of the day. Which reminds me, I have to propose something like that to scary May, the mom not the spy who is also a mom to a wayward superhero that she adopted. OK, from this point on I’m just going to go with Agent America to cut down on confusing. Normal school is boring and a bored Benji is a scary Benji. Gifted kids are dangerous. Bored, really gifted kids are extra dangerous.
“That was planned, wasn’t it?” Flash asked as he opened the fridge. There are three bags in the refrigerator with their names on them.
Me: Right now, my favorite board member, Perez is chatting among her fellow members convincing them to replace me with James Leopold. Monday after the stock market will do its thing and you know it will do its thing, she will make the suggestion that I retire and let Dr. Leopold take my place.
Captain Tight Pants: Mostly because you had that shirtless charity poster I accidentally did hanging up in your lab as a joke.
Me: After 2 hours of interrogation where I talked about my cuddle bunny in excruciating pornographic detail my new ATCU handler, Agent Scary wouldn’t let me get coffee because she hates coffee. On the bright side, I made poor man’s Coulson choke on his water when I talked about cuddle bunny’s oral skills.
I apologize for not pointing out who specifically spoke in the last conversation. Since I already did a conversation between Agent May and Clint using the same coding I did not think I needed to point it out. However, sometimes when you’re writing things you don’t see things how the audience sees it and that can be problematic.
Me: So I have $50 on Purple Arrow‘s retirement being up by January. To train Spidey senior, if nothing else.
“It’s almost nearly 3 AM, and I feel like I need to tuck you into bed again. Ana, are they working on anything dangerous down there?” Hunter was hoping the AI would tell them that there was nothing they needed to worry about.
“At least Stark is going to make an honest man out of you.” Steve just rolled his eyes before enveloping James in a hug.
“You’re going to talk to Ned voluntarily?” MJ looked at him, shocked. At least she wasn’t crying at the moment. He accomplished something.
“Even though you made a dick pic for your wife.” Tony was rolling his eyes at the ridiculousness of it.
Chief mechanic: No. Going by what happened in the other timeline, she’s either on some weird planet with Bruce bear or Asgard. I’m not sure which would be better.
