Bucky nodded once, sharp and short before walking away, heading out to the kitchen to presumably find Clint some alcohol. Natasha was still at his side and she gave his arm a reassuring squeeze, “He likes you; you know?”
Tony pulled his hand away, barely meeting Steve’s gaze, but he nodded stiffly and headed upstairs. Steve followed him, heart hammering in his chest. He felt sick at the cold difference Tony was showing him and he knew he deserved it.
Steve ignored both of them, crossing his arms over his chest to change his stance. Gone was Steve Rogers. The Captain had business, “Was anyone hurt?”
Steve wanted to immediately grab a pen and sign it, but he held back, the paper in his hands feeling heavier than it actually was. He couldn’t make this decision for them; he wouldn’t sign away their right to choose this for themselves although Steve knew he would urge every member of his family to sign on the dotted line if it meant protection.
Natasha looked at him for a moment, a wave of fear flashed over her green eyes before she waved the remote towards the television screen in the corner of the living, “This.” She replied, turning on the sound as everyone else turned their attention to the new report that was playing.
“Such a waste.” Rumlow commented, “But me and you, we’re men of our words. That’s how we conduct business, right Captain?”
He stepped closer to Steve again, “Would you stop thinking about me for five seconds and start thinking about yourself? Or at least think about how much of a chance your family stand against Rumlow without you there now.”
Eventually Steve had to call him out on it, the worry eating at him with every passing day. Tony had looked up at him with such shock that Steve had even noticed and adoration that he cared enough to voice his concerns that Steve wanted to bring Howard back from the death and punch him all over again. They went to bed that night with things a little easier between them, Tony actually slept, and Steve found himself drifting off soon afterwards without the worry of his boyfriend’s health.
“I didn’t tell you because you wouldn’t have let me go.” Steve smiled softly, “You would have fought me tooth and nail.”
Tony gasped, perfectly still for a moment as Steve’s eyes flicked to his, those brown eyes daring and excited and that was all it took for Steve to surge forward.
He wanted to know; this was the side of Steve he wanted to explore. This man who had started out as a kid with dreams and ideals and thoughts on how his life might go. He wanted to know how a kid who dreamed of being a getaway driver turned into The Captain.
"Tony, no," she says softly. "I don't think you should do anything you don't want to do. I'm just making sure you understand how much you mean to Steve." She pauses a moment, like Tony's supposed to have some kind of response to that, then says, "I'll send you everything I've got on Barnes. Take care of yourself, Tony."
"I'm sure he does," Bruce agrees, but it doesn't entirely sound like he means it. He is, however, apparently aware that Tony's a split second away from demanding JARVIS tell him where Clint's got to so he can chase after him, because he objects to that plan before Tony can put it into action. "Tony, I think maybe you should leave it a while. Both of you could probably do with some time to calm down before you speak to each other again."
Steve felt himself relax and Tony along with him, he continued running the sponge over Tony’s abs as Tony settled back into his position, “Tony, I spent years trying to cleanse the streets of Brooklyn with the blood on my knuckles but you, you’re doing it with a literal beacon of light in the dark. You’re the most remarkable man I’ve ever met.”
Tony kept his mouth shut because of course it wasn’t okay. Tony knew it wasn’t okay, he had spent so many nights drinking to stop his back from stinging as it scabbed over. He had spent weeks going to Rhodey’s place to get him to clean them so they wouldn’t get infected. None of that was okay.
“You have until tomorrow evening to make your decision, Cap. I’ll text you the location. If you don’t show I won’t bother with the press this time, I’ll take those names straight to the cops. Your family will be locked up by lunchtime.” Rumlow told him, voice firm.
“I don’t know who he is.” Tony insisted and it was partly true. Steve had never offered him a last name and a backstory. How much did Tony really know about the man other than he was a mob boss, he had killed people and he was a good fuck?
Steve nodded before a frown came to his face, “Where’s Tony?” He thought Tony would be here, waiting for him although perhaps that was a naïve fantasy. They weren’t exactly together right now despite what Tony had said to him.
When Tony did come, not even a few thrusts later, he stopped writhing enough to let himself fall into his orgasm and Steve could only watch as the pleasure shuddered through his body in one huge wave, cum coating Steve’s fist as he slowed down his strokes, allowing Tony to ride through the aftershocks.
Sam had placed his drink down with a smile but business was busy tonight so he couldn’t stop and chat like they normally would. Steve waved him away with a hand, they could catch up when it died down later. For now, he was content to sip his bourbon and try to push the fear of Hydra coming after his family from his mind.
“Who was on the phone?” She asked as she removed the other slipper, flexing her feet out in front of her.
Steve frowned, “Detective, I don’t think you realise how this works. I help you when it benefits me, you don’t get to give me orders. No one does anymore.”
His family had gathered in the living room this time, their cases of beer left untouched on the coffee table. All eyes were on him when he walked into the room, the sound of Steve slamming the door so hard it rattled the hinges was enough to tell them The Captain wouldn’t be reasoned with tonight.
Steve doesn’t dignify that with a verbal response, instead he aims his gun and shoots. A kill shot, right between the eyes. The impact has his body shuddering back and a heavy metal thud from the car behind. Then the guy’s head slums forward so his chin rests on his chest and Steve can see the mess the bullet made of the back of his head and the dent it put into the car behind him from the impact.
Tony played his part perfectly, never pretending to be the doting son but giving Howard a final send off after a cruel ending as a mark of respect for the legacy he left behind. The legacy that now belonged to Tony.
Tony leaned to the side, one hand reaching up to run along Steve’s smooth jawline before bringing his head down for a kiss. Steve obliged, teasing and playfully kissing Tony before rubbing his cheek along his lips for good measure, “I love this too.” Tony said softly, brown eyes warm with affection.
Tony’s ears pricked up, “Gang case? The Captain, right? I saw the news.” He hated himself for even caring.
He blinked, eyes taking in the clock on the side. It was late morning and he was definitely late for work. He sighed, Peter would be able to handle it, but he was annoyed at himself for sleeping in so late, he was trying to be more responsible than that these days. Building up a company was easy, keeping it afloat was another thing entirely.
Steve pressed closer to him, lining up every inch of their bodies so he was almost bent over Tony, hands on either side of the desk for leverage.
“I hate to say this because it makes me sound like you and you know I hate that.” Tony sighed, “But some of us have work to do. You’re welcome to hang out here with me and the Kid though. We can do lunch after I finish the work on this jeep.”
Bucky sighed, “That won’t work. Ross will be looking into this with a fine-tooth comb. If Fury put the dots together then he will as well.”
Steve ignored him, “But try and be discreet, okay? Tasha lives here too and I don’t want her to feel uncomfortable.”
He arms were crossed over his chest and he was scowling when Steve pushed the door open and slipped into the warmth of the house. Steve definitely wasn’t in the mood for this, he needed a shower and a change of clothes and then he could get back to work but Bucky clearly was intent on having this conversation now and Steve knew it was only because he was worried about him.
Steve wanted to frown. Good for him? Tony had been taken and they were congratulating him on a new relationship like it was normal?
Tony swallowed, blinding panic rising up inside him at the thought of having to watch Steve die, the thought of being alone. He barely registered that he was reached a hand behind Ross until he felt heavy cold metal in his palm.
He shouldn’t. He knew he shouldn’t. Tony was probably getting on with his life, was probably relieved to wake up to find Steve gone so that he didn’t have to try and explain what a bad idea this was. Yet, with Hydra and the police up against him and his family surrounding him, Steve wanted nothing more than to talk to Tony.
Steve frowned again, scrubbing a hand over his jaw, “Why does this one matter to you so much? Why this case, this Coulson, that would prompt you to go into business with the likes of me?”
The click of the gun didn't slow Steve down, the adrenaline in his body was working overtime and the only though he had was to get to Tony.
Steve could feel his own erection pressing into the mattress but ignored it in favour of swirling his tongue around the tip of Tony’s. He was salty as Steve moved his tongue against the head, his body jerking at the new sensation.
Bucky was clearly not happy and he’s protectiveness often got masked by anger, so Steve knew he was in for a lecture when he got home. He quickly tapped a reply to Bucky, letting him know he was alive and would be home shortly.
Thor was waiting in the entryway when Steve got to the main part of the house, leaving Tony to pack away his tools downstairs. Steve tried not to think of the press of Tony’s mouth, warm and plaint under his own as he made a beeline for Natasha who was making a peanut butter sandwich in the kitchen. It was a brash impulse situation to kiss Tony, a stranger he barely knew but Steve had been overcome by the mechanic. All that sass and dark hair wrapped up like a ribbon and dropped onto Steve’s doorstep, it was just icing on the cake that Tony had flirted back. Steve prided himself on being able to read people, to be able to work out the atmosphere of a room and use it to his advantage and Tony’s body language was practically inviting him in. He found himself wanting to know more about him but instantly brushed that notion off. It was one thing to go to a bar and pick up a stranger every now and again, Bucky would even say it was healthy for Steve to let off some steam, but this was different. Tony had been in his house; he had told him his damn name. Normally, he’d just say as The Captain or give a fake name to pretend at intimacy but when Tony had asked Steve had offered up a small token of truth without a thought. Tony wouldn’t be able to figure that he was Steve Rogers, of course. There were plenty of Steve’s in Brooklyn and thanks to a large sum of money and a whiz kid from Arizona, Steve Rogers didn’t exist on paper or online anymore. He was a dead man on foreign soil. Left to rot a long time ago.
Clint was fine. He would be fine. That’s what Bruce had said, hands covered in blood and a small lump of metal between his fingers. Tony had wanted to throw up then too but held back, Clint would be fine. They all would. As soon as they got Steve out of there.
His hands reached down to Tony’s jeans, gently popping the button and undoing the zipper. Normally, undressing Tony was one of his favourite things to do but now, as he guided both jeans and boxers down his legs in a move Steve had done a hundred times before, he wished he didn’t have to.
Clint bit his tongue at that. Steve was coming for him. Less than an hour and Steve was nothing if not a man of his word. He kicked his legs up on the table, making a show of settling in for a long night and in his head he started counting the tiles on the ceiling.
“I saw the way you looked at him downstairs. That wasn’t The Captain. That was Steve Rogers. It was the same look you used to have whenever Peggy walked down the block when we were kids.”
Tony knew he wouldn’t be making it into the garage today, Peter would cover. He’d slip him an extra bonus in his wages this week but right now he couldn’t find the strength to do much more than breathe and try to stop himself from falling apart.
His whole body was shaking as Steve gripped him tightly with one hand on his hip, pulling away from his neck long enough to reach up to cup Tony’s jaw, moving his head down so their foreheads were pressed together.
“Not without you.” Tony replied, “I have something. It might work.” He flexed his gloved hand for emphasis.
His hips stuttered, whole body shaking as his orgasm hit him hard. He was coming as he breathed into Tony’s sweaty skin, filling up the condom with his cum and feeling Tony’s fingers play with his hair.
Steve pressed the phone tighter to his ear, “Don’t get too used to running things around here. It won’t last long.”
That frown turned into dread curling in his chest when he read the top line. The immunity deals. Fury must have had someone post them through the door yesterday and someone must have picked it up and placed it in Steve’s office for him to sort through with the rest of the mail.
The Hydra goon made another mistake as he pulled the trigger, he squeezed his eyes shut as he braced for the recoil. Steve watched him close his eyes a fraction of a second before he squeezed the trigger and that was all it took. The bullet tore from the gun and Steve was already on the move. The bullet sailed past his shoulder and hit his bike again, Steve could hear metal strike metal in a distant ping behind him as he charged at his opponent. He ducked under the kid’s arm, coming up behind him as he opened his eyes to see the damage he had caused.
Steve responded by wrapping Tony’s other leg around his shoulder, fully trapping himself in the cradle of Tony’s hips. His hands released Tony from his grip, sliding round to cup his ass so Tony was free to thrust against him.
“You know there’s a perfectly good dance floor in the other room.” Tony replied as they turned gently.
"In cages." Steve shot back, "Bruce and Sam might get out on good behaviour. Maybe Clint could make a deal but you and me? The things we've done? What about Nat? Thor? You think they aren't going to throw the book at us?"
“What? You’re going to shoot me on your own doorstep now?” Fury demanded, raising his hands in mock surrender.
Bucky stalled for a moment, “Actually I’m going to the shipping yard. I know Steve, he’ll need eyes on Rumlow before he makes his move. He needs to know what he’s walking into.”
His heart sped up at the name on the screen, eyes blinking to make sure he wasn’t seeing things. Tony’s name was there, along with the notification that he’d gotten a new message to open. He’d completely forgot about waiting for Tony’s reply whilst he was dealing with the Rumlow situation and now Steve found himself eager to open it.
“T’Challa’s family had money, he stole some so I could take her to a doctor, but it was too late. She was too sick.” Steve took a moment to collect himself before continuing, “I just remember thinking how unfair it was, for her to suffer because we were poor. It didn’t make us any less because we couldn’t afford medical bills or heating. It shouldn’t have cost her life. So I had one thought, make the world better. For her. So, I joined the army. Thought being a soldier would make her proud, it would allow me to help people.”
He had always been good with his hands, nimble fingers of a mechanic and so it took him no time at all to have one end of the bow tie fastened to the headboard of Steve’s bed and the other wrapped around his wrist.
“Today, I give you that answer.” Tony continued on the screen, eyes darting across the mass of people in front of him, “We are no longer a weapons manufacturer. From now on Stark Industries will be a pioneer researcher for clean energy. That’s our new focus.”
“We need to break him out of jail.” Tony said aloud, not really registering then he’d even voiced the words until all eyes were on him. He knew he couldn’t take it back now, but he had thought about this. It had been the only thing he had managed to think about today. There was only a small window for them to get to Steve and it had to be whilst he was still in the city. When Ross charged him and moved him for a trial there would be no hope of getting to him, Ross would make sure of that.
He watched Peter scoop the cat up and take him towards the office happily and couldn’t help the smile that crossed his face. He was a damn push over with that kid but honestly without Peter he wasn’t sure he would have got this business off the ground.
“We’ll make sure it’s not for nothing.” Tony told him, “You just have to fight. That’s all, Steve. You’ve been doing it for so long, just a little more, okay?”
Steve dug his phone out of his pocket, hitting the call button when he found the number he was looking for. It rang three times before there was an answer.
Steve charged at him, Pierce wasn’t much of a fighter and he wasn’t expecting it. Steve grabbed him by the jacket, shoving him back against one of the cars to provide them with privacy should anyone come out. Pierce looked startled, dropping his phone in the snow at his feet as Steve held him firmly.
“No, not after the last one.” T’Challa replied firmly, “I’ve got the re-election campaign coming up in a few months. I can’t be associating with mobsters.”
Tony felt the fist colliding with his cheek, heat and pain spreading through his cheek towards his eye socket. He bit his tongue to stop himself from calling out, cheek flaming as he narrowed his eyes at Rumlow. That would bruise.
Tony shrugged a little from his spot on the counter, a smile on his face, “I didn’t have a nightmare last night. Slept the whole way through.”
“Can I borrow your phone? I need to call Peter and Rhodey.” Tony asked him once they were settled into the back seat of the car, Thor speeding them through Brooklyn’s sleepy streets like it was a game of Mario Kart. Tony still had Steve’s jacket tucked around him and he couldn’t help but keep peering over at the patch of red coating his shirt.
“Rogers told me.” Fury confirmed, “You can’t just kill people, not in a police station. Not when they’re members of the police. That isn’t how it fucking works in the real world. Christ, this is a mess.”
Tony puffed out a sigh of relief, “You’re the best, you know that?” He dug his fingers into Steve’s thigh again, “Honestly, having two home bases is exhausting.”
The best and worst thing about Rhodey was how much he cared. He wasn’t about to let Tony wallow over some guy and he definitely wasn’t going to let Tony shove the covers over his head and waste his days away in bed trying not to think about how his sheets smelt faintly of Steve or that he could see one of his shirts poking out of the corner of his washing pile.
He’d turned his back on his family, he’d hurt Tony, just to arrive at this moment. Steve wasn’t about to throw that away. Rumlow would have seen his arrest, that’s why he made it so public. As far as Rumlow knew he was on his way to hand himself over. It was the cops that were the ones standing in the way of his glory now, not Steve. They had simply gotten to him first, something that would drive Rumlow crazy after coming so close to his victory.
Steve laughed, pulling out of Tony gently as he moved to take the condom off and throw it in the trash can near the bed. Tony hadn’t moved and Steve cuddled up to him again, arms wrapping around him as they relaxed into a sweaty heap.
Steve couldn’t help the smirk on his face as he reached out to grab Tony and pull him forward. Their mouths met in a teasing dance, Steve’s fingers burning into the fabric at Tony’s hips as he opened up Tony’s mouth and slid his tongue in. Tony’s hands were on his neck, threading into his hair as he tried to get closer, every line of his body melting into Steve’s.
Tony pushed his hands away, “He didn’t touch me.” Tony promised, “I thought he was special, I thought we… I was wrong, the sun came up and reality set in.”
“Yes.” Steve told him, waiting for Tony to pull his hand away in disgust, “I’m not sorry. They took you.”
Bruce can't dismiss the possibility that he's reading entirely too much into things, because surely Tony 'Overshare' Stark wouldn't have kept quiet about the fact that he was seeing Steve, not given how enthusiastically he's raved about the man's assets. Then again, Steve is as reserved a person as Tony is extroverted, so perhaps he's managed to curb Tony's more explicit impulses, meaning Bruce also can't dismiss the possibility that he's
ass!” Bucky says again, even more emphatically. “Well, at least now I know why Stark looked like he was waiting for me to punch him the whole time Thor was talking. I mean, I knew you could be thick sometimes, but this really takes the cake.”
Her memories of the Winter Soldier might have undergone some editing, but there is no reason why they would have wanted to remember him as the one spot of kindness in her childhood. All this time, she's let herself believe that much was true, that for a brief time there was someone who saw her as a child to be protected rather than a weapon to be honed, and she's not ready to say goodbye to that delusion just yet. “I can't, Clint. There's things I haven't told you.”
It's smarter to keep them, he thinks, and the scrunched up balls of paper at the bottom of his duffel would be entirely safe if Sam didn't one day decide to do their laundry while Steve is out buying food for them.
There are many things Pepper loves about her job. She loves her offices, with their oh-so-comfortable chairs and her carefully maintained plants, and her employees, most of them just as committed as she is to the success of their own projects and the company as a whole. She loves that Stark Industries offers the best benefits package of any Fortune 500 company in the country and the fact that they also have the lowest staff turnover rate as a result, however much the old farts on the board might object to what they consider an unnecessary expense. She loves that they can offer opportunities to people who otherwise might not have had options, and that everything the company does is aimed at making the world and its citizens the best they possibly can be.
Frowny homeless dude doesn't crack a smile. Actually, he frowns more, and then pulls a knife from behind his back.
"Of course you do," Tony replies, landing on the rooftop at – based on his analysis of the footage from DC, at least – a safe distance from him, right hand raised. "I'm wearing the world's least subtle suit of armour.
Clint transfers his gaze from Tony to Bruce, his expression not quite as harsh as it was. "Come on, Bruce," he says, still sounding like he thinks he's being reasonable. "Are we just supposed to ignore the fact that Tony wants to go all
And then there’s Barnes, standing in the middle of the room, looking uncomfortable and saying absolutely nothing.
That… is actually a very good question, and something that would definitely have occurred to Tony to have an answer for if he'd thought this through. Except he didn't, and now he's waited too long to answer and Peggy is staring him down, eyes narrowed, and no amount of looking out the window and pretending he's fascinated by the well-maintained flowerbeds and absolutely hideous garden gnomes is going to put her off.
“Barnes…” Stark says, not managing anything more than that, his face doing that thing that he's seen Steve and Sam and occasionally Clint do, sometimes even Natalia as well. Like they want to reach out, offer comfort, but they know there's no fucking comfort to be had and any attempt will most likely end up with them knifed and Barnes catatonic in a corner.
So, yeah. Tony feels betrayed, okay. Betrayed and hurt and he's trying very, very hard not to forbid JARVIS from helping Steve because even though that's what he wants
,” Stark interrupts, hands at his sides and empty for once, clenching into fists over and over again. “I read your goddamn file, and not just the shitty translation that Natasha gave Steve. The things they did to you make Guantanamo look like a preschool version of the fucking Stanford Prison Experiment. They spent years figuring out every single way there is to hurt a person, and when you still wouldn’t do what they wanted you to they built a machine that would take you out and leave them a nice, blank template to work with, so don't even think that-”
"I suppose there's a slight chance he's told Colonel Rhodes," Bruce says eventually. "Failing that, the next option would be actually asking Tony, but I can't see that going well."
Tony half-laughs, this dry, uneasy kind of sound, then picks up and promptly puts down a spanner. "Really isn't, though," he says under his breath. "Plus, it helps to be working, keeps my mind off- I mean, I just, look, this."
“Where is everyone, J?” he asks, pausing before starting the penthouse coffee machine in the hopes that there’ll be someone in the team’s kitchen who’ll have taken care of that job for him, and hopefully also produced something in the way of breakfast.
Steve slams one final punch into the bag and then, shoulders braced like he's expecting an attack, says, "I'm sleeping with Tony."
“Sucks, that,” he agrees, then gets busy with slathering his own bagel in cream cheese and digging in.
Tony turns around, a glass in either hand, and just stands there a moment, quirking one eyebrow at Steve.
He expects the voice to hesitate while he confers with anyone still awake, but the response is almost immediate. “Certainly, Sergeant Barnes,” he replies. “Would you prefer the roof or the exit to street level?”
Steve laughs, the sound short and more than a little surprising. “Sorry,” he says instantly. “I’m not- I’m just relieved-”
At this, Tony turns around, full on glowering at the photo of Steve staring at a lizard sculpture currently occupying the holoscreen. "Okay, so, first off, not all of us spent the day pissing around looking at pretty sculptures, second, we worked very hard to obliterate a Hydra base before anyone even thought about swanning around, and thirdly, you don't even live here half the time, how were we supposed you hadn't just ambled off somewhere?"
Tony looks gobsmacked, which is about when Steve begins to wonder if he misread the situation. “I didn’t mean it like that,” he says quickly. “I didn’t even
Tony blinks, quiet for a very short moment, then says, “Oh, hi Natasha. Been a while. How’s unemployment treating you?”
He’d sort of expected Steve to go about it in a similar way, with the notable exception of the L-word, but apparently not. Apparently, Steve wants to know his drink order. “Wine’s okay?”
"It's Tony, Peggy," he reminds her gently, carefully. "Howard died over twenty years ago, remember?"
At least, he thinks there’s going to be zero complaints, right up until the moment Steve pulls back, breaking the kiss to press their foreheads together.
Steve shakes head, very much disagreeing. Maybe Tony was showy in his relationships before Iron Man, maybe it's possible to google him and find the sort of things Steve would never have expected to find in the public domain, but Tony has been far more discreet since then. His relationship with Pepper was public, but none of the details were, and not one of his other partners has shown up in the tabloids after the two of them broke up.
It starts when JARVIS reports a rise in the number of people complaining about large spiders in the vicinity of their homes. It's not a big enough increase that a human might pick up on it, but JARVIS is not human, and apparently two percent more tweets about arachnids for three consecutive hours  is significant enough for him to bring to their attention.
JARVIS put the lot's security cameras on a loop as soon as the last car left for the day, so there's no risk of anyone noticing two men appearing from nowhere. It also means there's no one besides the four of them and J to notice how awkward Tony's greeting is, and thankfully the only one who acknowledges it is Bruce, who doesn't do anything more than frown slightly which is basically the same as doing nothing at all.
, as far as he's concerned, are that Steve thought he was good for the occasional fuck and not a whole lot more than that, and JARVIS needs to get with the program here). "Are you sure that was his suggestion, Tony?"
thirty seconds later), which sets off down without Sam as much as looking at a button. There's no awful elevator music, no sound either; the only way Sam knows it's moving at all is the swooping in his stomach, and even that seems muted somehow, far less than it should be in an elevator moving this quickly.
“Shit!” he announces, staring at the broken bag on the floor for a second before turning desperate eyes on Tony. “I’m sorry, Tony.”
Tony left him to it yesterday, because clearly Steve has some things to get out of his system and if it’s bad enough for him to destroy two of Tony’s theoretically indestructible punching bags, he thinks violence is probably a better way for Steve to work out his anger than other, more pleasant activities. Plus, Steve knows where he is and has never hesitated to come find him before, so Tony had sort of figured he’d show up in either the shop or Tony’s bedroom as soon as he was done hitting things.
The masters aren't a concern. The asset will not hesitate to slaughter all who believe they can own it, turning its decades of training back on those who trained it.
“Oh, more than,” Natalia answers, giving him a look so thoroughly approving that Steve blushes. “Off you pop, boys.”
Barnes grimaces, fairly sure he's not going to want to agree to Stark’s demands any more than Stark wanted to agree to his. He will, most likely, because Stark cares for Steve too much to ask anything unbearable from Barnes, and because, if he's completely honest, Barnes is more than a little scared that Stark will take it back if Barnes refuses him.
It's fine, Tony tells himself, making his way up to the hotel roof to retrieve the suit from the quinjet. Steve'll call him once he wakes up, and they can arrange another time to meet up when Tony's schedule is completely clear for a few days.
to eat. A bag of red grapes for snacking, bread and cheese for lunch, everything she needs to throw together a bolognaise for this evening, a pint of ice cream and the darkest bar of chocolate she can find just in case the occasion calls for it.
“Where’s Bucky?” It was Natasha that cut through there stalemate and Tony was thankful to be able to take his eyes away from Steve.
It couldn’t have been more than two minutes later when the door to the small room opened and two cops walked in. Clint smiled; they had been listening. They were clearly high-level cops, in suits instead of uniforms. The first one looked at tired as Clint felt, his grey suit rumpled from what was probably a long day and a coffee cup clutched into his hand like a lifeline, under his arm was a file.
“I’ll say I killed Ross, you shouldn’t have to….” Steve started, wanting to protect Tony from having to admit to it if he wasn’t ready.
Tony’s mouth was magic, that was Steve’s first thought, as he felt Tony’s tongue swirl around his nipple before moving up to suck at his neck. Steve felt more blood rush down to his dick as Tony sucked at his skin, his hands moving with ease to Steve’s back, digging his fingers into Steve’s shoulder blades.
Rumlow. He’s voice was gruffer, angrier than Steve could remember but it was him. The same husk to his speech unmistakable even over the phone.
Steve shook his head, “I needed to destroy the equipment he has for making bombs. I also needed to send a message. This does both.”
“You know, he’s killed people for calling him that.” Natasha said but there was a smirk on her face.
Steve gasped as Tony mouthed him through the material of his boxers, tongue tracing the line of his cock and making his boxers wetter by the minute. He could feel the coil in his stomach, his hips gave a little thrust as Tony sucked against him and his breath hitched.
He slid in the third finger, the lube making it easier as well as the prep from Tony’s own fingers. Steve still took his time with this part, listening to the catch in Tony’s breath and savouring the way Tony pushed his hips back into Steve’s hand. He was eager and impatient for Steve’s cock and that made his balls tight and his cock jerk as he slid his hand out.
Steve expected him to walk away so he was mildly surprised when Tony took a step closer to him. These next words were for Steve and Steve only as Tony’s heart broke and he shoved it into Steve’s hand like a metaphorical fuck you, “if this isn’t part of some plan, give me a sign that you’re actually the want who wants this.” Tony said low and deadly. It was an ultimatum, but Steve couldn’t take it.
They were both panting, but Tony was pushing his heel against the edge of Steve’s jeans as if that would remove them quicker.
When the door did finally open, it wasn’t food that Rumlow brought with him but a large trolley that he wheeled in front of him and parked against the wall. It almost looked like a metal gurney and if it wasn’t for the sheet draped over it oddly, as it rested over the objects already on the trolley, Tony might have worried Rumlow planned to wheel him out in a body bag.
Howard clearly didn’t appreciate that answer and for a moment Tony found himself flinching, waiting for the punch that never came. Instead, Howard straightened his tie, “You’ll rot here. You’ll amount to nothing. That will be your legacy, Tony. Unloved and forgotten.”
Natasha’s eyes were brilliant with defiance, a strong hold and firm shoulders. Thor was struggling and raging and shouting. Tony had his face pressed up against the window inside his car, eyes on Steve.
Steve sees stars when Tony actually moans around his thumb, pulling the digit free of his mouth with a grin. He’s fighting dirty and Steve loves it.
Tony dropped a kiss into his sweaty hair, “Don’t mention it.” Then he pulled away heading up the stairs to change and get to T’Challa’s office.
The sound of his phone buzzing from the pocket of his jacket somewhere on the floor was what brought Steve back to reality. He’d been out all night, something that he never did. His family were probably going out of their minds with worry that something had happened to him.
Steve rolled them over, trapping Tony in between his thighs as he placed him back against the mattress, his mouth moving towards Tony’s chest, “Family later.” Steve agreed, pressing his hips against Tony’s, “I want you, now.”
Fury unlocked the other cuff and the metal clacked against the table, “Change of plan. You need to go to him.”
Thor was back up and on the second guy as soon as the hammer was free from the first man’s face and Steve didn’t envy the end, he knew that guy would meet it at Thor’s hand. He’d worked with Thor for three years now, recruited him straight out of a hole in the wall where he was looking for his brother’s killer. Thor had gladly accepted Steve’s offer at a home and a family, the kind with power and the ability to get answers. Thor wanted revenge for Loki and Steve was determined to help him, hoping to bring peace to the haunted man who had become part of his family.
Steve was breathing heavily into Tony’s ear, listening as Tony moaned at the feeling of Steve inside him and watching as he gripped the bedsheet was his free hand in order to ground himself.
He found his boxers in their mess of clothes and stole the plain white t-shirt Steve had discarded on the chair by the window at some point to slip over his head. The idea of putting his dress shirt back on seemed silly for a trip to the bathroom and Tony was sure Steve wouldn’t mind.
“People call it criminal.” Steve nodded, “Sometimes I feel like it’s the rest of the world and their conventions that are the real problem.”
Pierce gurled, trying to say something but he didn’t manage to form the words. Steve nodded, tucking the knife back in place and grabbing the phone Pierce had dropped earlier. He tucked it into his pocket to look at later. Then he stood up, smoothing out his jacket and running a hand through his hair as he looked down at Pierce, still groaning on the floor. A thick plume of red against the stark white snow.
Steve’s hands were still gripping onto his thighs, “Are you sure you’re ready for…” He started, not wanting Tony to be uncomfortable for round two.
Tony shook his head, “He didn’t. I might need you to do some scary boyfriend visits to get me out of a few forced dinners though.”
Steve kissed him again, purely because he couldn’t help himself. He needed to taste Tony on his tongue and feel him on his lips and Tony opened up to him as soon as he brought their mouths together.
Tony watched as Steve finished unwrapping his hand, fingers working to fold the fabric neatly in his lap, “Afghanistan.”
Bucky didn’t meet his gaze, eyes dropping to the corner of paper Steve was doodling on, “Anyone I know?” He asked.
Steve felt warm and a bright light blinded his eyes for a moment as a soft buzzing sound filled the air. He heard bodies thump to the fall, dull and lifeless and then Tony was lowering his arm and Steve’s vision managed to right itself.
Steve stood up straighter, determined to give Tony the same back. He walked further into the room, scanning the faces of his family and drawing strength from them. These people were his safe harbour, everyone in this room meant something to him. He’d kill for them; he’d die for them. Surrounded by them, Steve felt invincible.
That’s what Steve wanted. He let his mouth sink down on Tony’s cock, taking him as far down his throat as he could without gagging. That had Tony gasping fully awake as his hands fisting the sheets either side of him and his head lifted off the pillows to watch Steve take him.
Steve brought him up and back down again, Rumlow gripping onto his wrists to get him to stop, “There was a bomb.” Steve replied, trying to shake the images from his mind.
The only chance they had of this working was if Rumlow didn’t know who Steve was. It’s doubtful he’d remember a bright-eyed, clean shaved good little army boy from years ago when compared to the harden mobster Steve was now, but he didn’t want to take any chances. If Rumlow didn’t know who the Captain was then they needed to keep it that way. If he did, it could already be over. All it would take who be for Rumlow to give that information to the wrong people and Steve would have a mob at his door before sunrise.
Could he sign it himself? To be with them? Could he really march to Fury’s orders on this and pretend he had been working with the cops all along? It felt wrong, it went against everything Steve had done to get this far. Everything he had built up and fought for. Immunity was a dicey game; he knew that much. If things went the way Steve thought they would then there was no guarantee these deals would even hold and if they did there was no way they’d let the team stay together. Immunity and witness protection went together, and once Hydra was off the map the police would want to send the team off to different corners of America and separate them. It would be the smartest thing to do, they would be less of a threat if they were all on their own.
Sam smiled kindly and Steve found himself continuing, “As of yesterday evening we’re at war with Hydra. It’s going to be bloody; it’s going to be brutal. Rumlow isn’t going to stop.” He paused, eyes locking with Bucky, “And neither are we. Rumlow wants to bring bombs into our city. He wants to kill us and insight the kind of fear that will shape a generation. Not whilst I’m alive.”
Steve seemed shocked by the move but didn’t pull away, “Okay.” He replied softly, eyes still on the flames.
“Nat, you and Tony take the back. Find the bombs Rumlow has been making and disable them. Destroy them. Whatever puts them out of commission.” Steve ordered as Natasha stepped closer to Tony.
The defeat in his eyes must have given him away because Natasha closed the gap between them with a soft smile, “You aren’t going to leave this one to Fury, are you?”
“You could come like this, couldn’t you?” Steve bit out, pressing firmly back into Tony to hear that little whimper that escaped his throat. “That’s how much you want me.”
“No, wait. I need to go to work.” Tony sighed, “I’ve left Peter there for two days now. I need to show my face. I’ll meet you after my shift, okay? Start planning without me and I’ll catch up when I get there.”
“Bucky enlisted with me and we met Sam and it was fine for a while. We were helping people, defending the little guy who couldn’t defend themselves. Rumlow and his team were brought in on a mission to evacuate a village full of innocents, we’d gotten intel there was a bomb attack. He didn’t much care about sweeping the place for anyone we missed though, he just wanted to get out of there fast. I disagreed, there were still people in their homes scared and we had to get them out. We fought about it, divided the mission. Next thing I know, I’m lying in the desert with a mouth full of sand and no hope of survival.”
“Hello?” He bit out, fighting to keep his voice level and dangerous. He spoke in a low growl, Rumlow wouldn’t hear him waver.
Tony didn’t reply, forcing himself to focus on the task ahead as he pulled into the Stark Industries underground garage with an ID code that he hadn’t used since he was seventeen and was surprised still worked. He knew that was going to be the easiest bit about today.
He wondered if the other residents knew a gang lived in their street. Did Steve smile at his neighbours when they crossed paths? Or did they cross the street to avoid him? Tony shook his head, it was Brooklyn, people weren’t exactly that friendly to begin with.
"You're right, it's not." She replied, "We won't do anything unless we have to but I'm not leaving until I know you're clear."
Tony seemed to nod into his shoulder and Steve felt his lips leave a small kiss against his collarbone. They’d be okay, they had to be.
The party was in full swing when they arrived, and Steve had to admit that T’Challa had done a good job. The room was lit softly, a yellow glow that made Tony’s skin look even more vibrant than before. It was a party for politicians though and the atmosphere was immediately brought down by the stifling feuds hidden behind fake smiles and glasses of wine. Steve saw it every year, the women who’d try to outdo each other with their dresses, each one more ruffed and ridiculous than the last. The men were worse, all laughter and sly smiles as they stabbed each other in the back in their minds. Steve had always wondered why they didn’t just punch each other outright, surely that was more civilised than this game of pretend they all seemed to take part in whilst actively hating it.
If he got up now, he could be in by lunchtime and then he could just work through till the evening to make up his hours. He had a convertible to look at and an oil change to do for Mr Shaw. Tony nodded, sitting up in bed and tried to ignore the slight burn from last night.
Tony laughed, closing the door behind him as he kicked off his shoes and worked on undoing the buttons on his shirt, “More like there’s something missing.” He commented as he undressed.
Tony was a force to be reckoned with, Steve was learning that fast as Tony dragged his nails down Steve’s back with an insistence that Steve could only read as a demand from the mechanic.
The uncomfortable chair, the depressing cell, the egos. He hated the smell of his own sweat and blood, longing for a shower and some food because when was the last time he ate?
Steve nodded, “I know, Hawkeye. Listen to Murdock, don’t say anything, okay? They won’t find a file on you because you don’t exist. No trail, electronic or paper. Give me two hours tops, I’ll get you out.”
His cheeks were red with exertion and his chest heaved, “It’s not meant to be like this. None of it. When I built this gang, this family. I promised them I would protect them; I would stand in between them and whoever wanted to hurt them. I’m failing and they all see it.”
Steve sighed, “I need a list of all the army vets that have returned from overseas this past year. Only ones who have returned to Brooklyn. Hydra has a new head and all I know is that he’s army.”
Steve looked at him then, really looked at him, “You would do that? Leave everything behind to run away with me?”
“You don’t even like me.” Tony reminded him, taking a left at the junction. Stark Industries loomed in the distance like a beacon for dread, calling Tony home.
“Just making sure.” Steve replied before offering out his hand. Fury sighed and took it, shaking it once and dropping it just as quickly. He didn’t want to be doing this, Steve knew, but he was smart enough to know it was the only way to stop Hydra and, on that front, at least they were on the same side.
“Do you have lube?” He asked when he pulled away because he didn’t want to hurt Tony by not using any and he definitely wanted to know how it felt to be inside him.
“Captain.” Fury greeted him, his tone wasn’t harsh or biting like Steve had expected but almost amicable.
Steve kept going, “I want it to work, with you. But I can’t and won’t make promises I can’t keep. If there are parts of myself you’d rather not see, that you don’t want me to bring back to you. You need to tell me now.”
There were murmurs from his team, a whispered call to war that had the atmosphere in the room buzzing.
“How are you going to persuade him to do that?” Bucky asked cautiously, “Friend or not, he isn’t about to let you have a talk with a criminal because you ask nicely.”
Tony spasmed underneath him, mumbling something unintelligible as he came into Steve’s mouth. Warm and salty cum hit the back of his throat as Steve swallowed some of it down. He pulled back when he couldn’t anymore, letting the rest of Tony’s cum dribble out into the space between them and slide down his cock.
Tony was curled up into a ball in the furthest corner from the door, his eyes wide and unfocused. He was staring at Ross, not moving or blinking aside from the small shakes that wracked his body. Steve’s heart broke, Tony looked so lost and scared and young. Steve wanted to hold him.
“I wanted to protect you. I needed to protect you. But I shouldn’t have done it like this. I took that choice away from you. I should never have decided that for you, Tony. I’m sorry.” Steve told him, eyes pleading and throat thick.
Tony went down to the garage instead and got to work. He built the device to short-out the cameras in an hour with three cups of coffee. His memory always had been good, and it was better under pressure. That same device was currently like a hot rock in his pocket and Tony had to stop himself from checking it every few minutes.
“What do you want to know?” Steve sighed, the thought of seeing Tony again, even if it was to be the last time, was a thought he was clinging too like a dying man.
“Looks like you got a few more in since then.” He replied with a glance over at the classic cars in the corner.
“I let them believe it, I let them spread those rumours as much as they liked because it helped them to fear me. Phillips always used to say fear is how you gain power, but it doesn’t keep you there. That’s when I knew if I wanted to stay on top I had to rebuild The Avengers into something that was completely my own. A system I created that wasn’t based on fear but on loyalty. That was something Phillips never understood.” Steve replied, freeing his hand from the other wrap and dropping the fabric into his lap.
Tony continued to glare at him. What had he done? He had just amused that Rumlow taking him was about Steve. He hadn’t even considered that it was Howard at fault. He had basically given Rumlow a new alternative, a way to bring in The Captain. To kill Steve.
Tony understood the meaning behind her eyes as they bore into his. She was offering him a chance, an olive branch. She was seeing if he was with them. Tony found himself replying before he could even think his answer though, “Okay. Let’s get our self-sacrificing idiot back.”
Natasha seemed to sense the shift in Tony’s resolve and quickly moved on, “Okay, you get in to see Steve. You disable the cameras. Then what? No way to get you both out of there without Ross issuing a warrant for your arrest as well.”
Peter reached out a hand to scratch the ginger cat’s ear, “I found him sniffing around the bins this morning when I opened up. He looked hungry so I gave him some of the tuna sandwich in the fridge and he hasn’t left.”
Tony cut his off firmly, fusing his lips with Steve’s. He had been turned on since that moment, a thrill at seeing Steve be so possessive over him. There was something in that, the need for Steve to let the world know that Tony was his. Tony found his cock stirring in his pants again at the thought.
They made it to the locker room without being seen, luckily the back stairs didn’t seem to be used for much more than a service stairwell and due to the late hour most of the regular beat cops had clocked off shift. It was a small station, they couldn’t afford that many night covers on their budget. Steve only knew that because it was something T’Challa had been trying to improve since he first got into office, he was thankful now all of T’Challa’s efforts proved unsuccessful.
Steve didn't know where to start, words swirling in his mind like water going down the drain. He was tense, shoulders ramrod straight and hair in disarray from the walk back to the house, and everyone else in the room could feel it.
“I’ll never understand the way your mind works,” T’Challa replied, “We haven’t finalised the list yet but I can get it. It will take a few days.”
It was reckless, asking for a few things that weren’t in his father’s original designs, but Tony knew just from looking at him that Rumlow wasn’t a man of intelligence, he was a man of action. He was a battering ram. Tony could use that to his advantage.
Steve spun them, moving Tony back until his back hit the wood of his door and Steve had pinned him up against it and this was what Steve wanted. The lines of Tony’s body pressing against his own until he was heady with the feel of him under Steve’s hands.
They were meant to start at midnight and it was at least seven minutes past that now. If there was one thing Steve hated, it was tardiness. That was no way to conduct business in his opinion and that was what they were here for after all.
“I can take a hit.” Tony grumbled, “And I don’t know what you want with me but trust me, you have the wrong guy.”
Then there was that sinful look Tony threw him over his shoulder, bedroom eyes if Steve had ever seen them. He followed Tony blindly, something he’d never normally do, as Tony led him through the open plan space of his condo to the back corner where Steve saw a bed.
He could help people with that kind of tech, a self-sustaining energy source. That was worth a deeper look.
Fury sighed, “Just give me some time, okay. Let me find a way to spin this. Don’t act, don’t go after Hydra. If there is another way out, I’ll find it, but I need you to lay low. You and your team need to be squeaky clean for this to work.”
Despite the weather, and the obvious turn that meant snow was definitely soon on the way Tony felt pleasantly warm. The encounter with Steve and their new found acceptance at whatever it was between them was still playing over in his mind and Tony still felt the warm of Steve’s shower on his skin. It all honesty, he wasn’t expecting to come away from Steve’s house with a mob boss on speed dial for his every sexual desire, but Tony wasn’t about to complain, especially when that mob boss looked like Steve.
Tony whimpered and added another finger, fucking himself open wider as his hips stuttered against Steve’s skin. Steve was rock hard now, he needed Tony to cum, he needed to be inside him.
Steve was closing the gap between them in seconds. It was like he was sinking, drowning. His mouth and nose filling up with water and Tony was the only anchor left. Their mouths met furiously, Steve was taking and demanding, and Tony was giving it all up. Everything he needed was right there, in his hands and he was losing it faster than sand through his fingers.
Tony was firm though, eyes sparking to life, “We could go anyway. Get a car and drive. Nevada, Boston, Chicago. Anywhere you want to go, I’m in.”
“What the fuck is happening?” Steve insisted with wide eyes, attracting the attention of a few nearby uniformed officers.
Natasha nodded, “We’ll need to take the van. We can drop Rumlow off right on their doorstop then come back here, switch cars and all head out.”
“Are you okay?” Tony asked him softly. They were lying in Steve’s bed facing each other, still warm from the bath and sated. Natasha had told them to rest for a few hours, they’d need their strength for whatever came next.
“But you wanted Rumlow to kill him.” Tony guessed, “You don’t care about the bombs or Rumlow’s plans to rule Brooklyn. You want to clean the streets of gangs. As long as Steve Rogers is still alive, as long as there are Avengers walking those streets then you lose. And you hate it.”
“Right,” Steve explained, “I managed to work out a deal with Fury in return for my help. To keep you all safe, it’s a sacrifice. We’re all going to have to do things we might not like.”
This family that had bled and killed and defended him. That had built him from the ground up and given him something more to be and to aim for. How else could he repay that debt now other than like this. By saving them. By taking this fight out of their hands and carrying it in his own.
Tony read it twice and then swore under his breath. This wasn’t good. He could feel it making the hairs on the back of his neck standing up on end. He was out of his seat before he even replied.
Steve sighed, leaning forward so his elbows were on the table, “Do you have a family? People you care about? People you want to protect?” Ross’ silence was deafening and gave Steve all the answer he needed, “Then I don’t expect you to understand why I’m doing any of this.”
Steve looked down, his hands covered in Bucky’s blood, “You and Sam have everything you need? Clint can stay with you, run out to fetch whatever you don’t have.”
This thing that drew him to Steve, it wasn’t just chemical or physical. It wasn’t because of Steve’s alluring glacier blue eyes or his chiselled abs that must have been sculpted from marble. It wasn’t because he knew how to work Tony’s body better than anyone else ever had. It was something a lot more fundamental than that. Steve saw him. For who he was, despite the ugliness of his own survival, despite the flaws that Tony had amounting up in spades. Steve recognised him as a survivor despite knowing nothing about his past. It was like there was something there in the glint of Tony’s eyes or under his skin that Steve instantly recognised and how in the world could he ever try to explain that to Rhodey without sounding crazy?
Thank you to everyone who has read, liked and enjoyed this story and has been a part of this journey with me. I love you all!
Steve’s eyes narrowed, “I know. It’s sitting at the bottom of the Hudson River. Is this the part where you arrest me, Fury? Because I have to tell you that isn’t going to work out for everyone.”
Steve blanched at the idea, stepping back to allow Rhodes to catch his breath, “I’d never do anything to hurt Tony. Or you.”
Natasha shook her head, closing the distance between them. Her footing was graceful, even in the snow, “He gave me the order after he broke up with you. He called me, told me to watch out for you. Protect you. Then he hung up.”
Steve smiled, “Sorry, I really have to be somewhere. Nice talking to you fellas.” He started walking again. A trigger-happy cop shot off a warning shot that hit the brick wall a few feet away from Steve. Sloppy.
“Not the first one I’ve committed today, I assure you.” Steve grinned, crossing his arms over his chest to appear more threatening.
Natasha comes down as he is scrubbing the mess, hands stained red from the blood and the once yellow sponge in his hand now pink. She takes in the sight, the body in plastic and Steve on his hands and knees as he scrubs furiously at the concrete.
Steve could feel his cock grow harder at the lines of Tony’s body pressing against his, he could feel Tony’s own hard cock through his jeans. He wanted this as well, he had from the moment Steve had stepped into the garage.
The sound of his phone buzzing brought him out of his head, Steve drained the last of his scotch before grabbing his phone.
“Okay, two minutes tops. You don’t get too close to him, alright? I need to bring him up to the interview room to get him to sign his paperwork anyway. He’s refusing to get a lawyer even though one’s been calling for him.” Rhodey sighed, rubbing his brow, “You can go in first but then you leave, and you stay out of this until this investigation is over, okay? He’ll be rotting behind bars before you know it.”
“We found another body. Same as before, cop on duty, ‘A’ carved into his chest.” Fury told him bitterly, “They’re calling in Special Branch. It’s their case now.”
The body fell limp, blood pooling to the floor. Steve barely looked at it as he rounded the corner, he had to be close.
He was so close, he started jogging, taking another corner and another. He could see the sign for an exit up ahead. He started running now, just a little more.
Steve pulled at his wrap on his hand as he spoke, “He grew up poor. I lived about ten blocks from here, Bucky and T’Challa lived in the same street. We were those kids that dreamed about making a difference, you know? But I was poor and sick, especially in the winter months. We couldn’t afford the heating bill back then, so I got hit with everything going. We couldn’t afford a hospital either, I’d stay at Bucky’s when it got real bad and sit by the fire and just try to shake it. Then my mom caught the same bout of pneumonia that I did. I got better. She didn’t.”
Rhodey seemed to spy him through the glass that separated them, one look at Tony’s face and he was on his feet. Tony’s cheeks were still red with the cold, tears streaking down his face with his hair a mess and Rhodey instantly knew he needed him. What a friend, what a brother. Tony pushed the door open to Rhodey’s office before all but tumbling into his arms. He was exhausted and weary and heartbroken.
Now though, listening to them break their hearts open and try and stitch the pieces back together he knew what he had to do. He could give them a happy ending. At least, he could do that. It wasn’t perfect, it wasn’t the win everyone was hoping for but they would have each other and maybe a chance to build that life with kids and a happy ending if they wanted to. Steve could give that to them. Didn’t he owe them that? After everything they had done for him?
“I don’t need pity, okay?” Tony replied, “I’m fine, totally. I just wanted to come and save you from your desk with pizza and maybe a movie?”
Steve sighed, sliding back into his chair as Fury set up collecting up Ross’ papers. “That was stupid.” Fury muttered so Steve could barely pick it up, “And brilliant.”
Tony nodded, “Yeah.” He breathed, all but collapsing into Steve’s side. The move threw Steve for a second and he stumbled to support Tony against him as he wrapped an arm around his shoulders, the other hand still in Tony’s grip.
Well, everyone except Steve but he didn’t deserve one. He, much like Rumlow, deserved everything that was coming to them and Brooklyn would heal like a scab once they were gone until they were forgotten about. Two men who once owned a city that fought back. It might even be poetic one day.
Firstly though, he needed to talk to Tony, properly talk to him for more than the two minutes they managed to steal in that room today. If this really was the end of everything they had all worked for then Steve wanted to put a few things right and he needed Tony to hear him, even if he didn’t deserve it.
Steve cocked an eyebrow as a car crawled into the open clearing, pencilled in by large shipping crates on all sides. A maze of privacy and steel that would allow them to discuss business without being found. He crossed his arms over his chest, leaning back against his motorbike with a look of boredom etched into his features as the car in front of him stopped and the back door opened.
This time was different though, this time Tony wasn’t a scared kid trying to avoid his father’s temper. He knew he was stronger than that. Not to mention the glorified bodyguard in the front seat and the mob boss who would raise hell if Tony came back with some much as a bruise. He could do this. He had to do this.
“Captain, you’re under arrest. Put your hands behind your head and stand down.” It was Fury’s voice through the crowd as he walked towards Steve with handcuffs.
Steve chuckled, “Bath?” He offered instead, knowing they wouldn’t have to worry about standing in a bath.
Howard chuckled, “I owe you? I owe you nothing, you left. You walked out on this family and this legacy. Why the hell would I risk my business, and my life, to help you?”
She nodded, pulling her Glock out of its holster on her hip and handed it over to Steve, “You might need that. I’ll be upstairs if you need me. Clean-ups always faster with two.”
Steve let his hands slip from Bucky’s shoulders, “You’re right. I knew you’d have helped me, and I didn’t want you to. I didn’t want to put you in any more danger than I already have.”
Tony pulled back to get to work but Steve help him firm, pulling him back in as those icy blue eyes met his, “Thank you, Tony.”
Tony swallowed, heart pounding in his ears. Was Steve flirting with him? Was he reading the right body language rolling off the mob boss in waves? He took a step forward, closing the gap between them, “In this dream scenario? Maybe I am.”
“You don’t want to start with the threats, Rhodes was it?” Clint snapped back, “You’re clearly clued up on gang knowledge so that means you know what happens to anyone who comes after The Captain or his people.”
Steve shrugged, “Just let me do this one thing. This last good thing for my family, for this city. Let me put an end to Hydra and then Ross can do what he wants with me. He can put me on a pyre in the middle of Brooklyn and read out my sins for the nation. I don’t care. I just care that they are safe.”
Steve took his own sip, the liquid burning his throat on the way down, “We need to point the police back at Hydra. Get them to start sniffing around that gang instead. They won’t be able to make a move under scrutiny like that without risking arrest and we’d be free to launch our own defence if they tried anything.”
He thrusted back into Tony in time with his hand on his own cock, feeling Tony pant against him at the onslaught of sensations. He was shaking and squirming with his pleasure, trying to fall into it. Steve knew he’d cum hard.
There was an invisible wall between them. A flood of everything thing left unsaid and that hung unspoken like an open wound between them. There was hurt and anger and confusion but there was something softer underneath as well. Tony swallowed thickly.
Steve chuckled, “It was an aesthetic choice. The idea of the open road, no roof so I could feel the sun on my face. Endless possibilities in front of me.”
He couldn’t accept he’d never see Steve again. Even if he got out of this completely free thanks to Steve’s lawyer how could Tony walk out that door and let Steve rot? Natasha and Thor were there too. How long before Ross came for the others? This was his family too, he wasn’t able to walk away from it. If they were going down then Tony would be right there with them.
Steve hummed around Tony’s cock as if to respond to him and it drove Tony crazy, the vibrations on his sensitive skin almost had him bucking off the bed in a move that surprised Steve but he held him down firm. Tony threw a leg over Steve’s shoulder instead, bringing Steve in closer to him as his heel dug into Steve’s back.
Sitwell slid out of the car with ease and another burly man followed him out soon after, eyes clocking Steve immediately. Steve narrowed his eyes at Sitwell, his slighter frame doing nothing to intimidate Steve. He wasn’t the leader of Hydra; they hadn’t had one since Steve had drowned Schmidt over the side of the pier last year. Perhaps that was why Sitwell wasn’t keen on meeting there.
Tony sighed, “Well that’s going to make Christmas awkward. You might have to let him get in a free shot to make him feel better.”
Tony released him gently, one last flick of his tongue over the tip of Steve’s cock that caused him to jerk a little before Tony was sitting back up, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand as Steve worked on regaining his breath.
Tony scoffed, “If we live through this I might just have to tie Steve up in the basement, so he doesn’t pull this shit again.”
Tony could feel everything rushing up inside him, all the sadness and anger and betrayal like a lump in his throat as he looked at Steve so he did what he always did, he hid it under layers of sarcasm, “Orange really isn’t your colour, you know?” He greeted, taking small tentative steps towards Steve.
They worked the room together; Steve charmed his way through the politics talk with a practised ease. He had pretty good knowledge on that front, being both a soldier and a mob boss helped him navigate both sides of the argument and keep him informed of developments that might sway a politician either way. Tony was a natural too, all those years at business functions for Stark industries meant he could charm with the best of them and Steve found himself simply watching Tony work. He’d even managed to get Hill, Steve’s biggest worry of the evening. Tony had her eating out of the palm of his hand and when Steve proposed backing T’Challa it was Tony that managed that last little push to secure her vote. It was exhilarating watching him like this, marvelling at how seamlessly they worked together.
The skies above them were grey and looming, rain would probably hit before the night was out but what Steve wouldn’t give to stand here with Tony for another day, another month, another year. Just to be able to stay with him.
Dark eyes matched the dark hair as they peered at Steve with a scowl, “That song is legendary, cutting it off is a crime.”
As he went to find T’Challa he felt Tony slip a hand from his and say something about getting drinks before heading in that direction. Steve nodded, alcohol and Tony would make this event so much better. Tony was dressed too distractingly tonight, a pressed three-piece suit in all black. It made his skin look tanner and his brown eyes sparkle and when Steve went to pick him up, he felt wholly inadequate in his traditional tux and bowtie. His beard was neatly trimmed, and his hair was as tamed as possible, despite the fact one piece kept dislodging from behind his ear to hang over his forehead. Tony though, he was something else. His black tie and black shirt melting into the rest of his suit and Steve was almost tempted to skip tonight all together and push Tony back inside his apartment, removing his clothes one black layer at a time.
“Written confession after the immunity, not before.” Steve replied, “I really have to insist on that. I want Detective Fury in charge of it. Not you.”
He looked at her then, blue eyes staring into green, “I can’t guarantee you’ll be safe, Nat. Any of you.”
“Instinct?” Tony echoed, the silky material of Steve’s bowtie loose and hanging down either side of his neck for Tony to grab in either hand, “A possessive instinct? You were claiming me, weren’t you? Telling Hammer and everyone else there tonight that I was with you.”
He was so busy wrapping his mind around that thought that he barely saw Rumlow moving out of the corner of his eye.
Tony pulled back properly, letting Steve go. Letting Steve be what he needed to be to get the job done.
Tony hummed, “People will talk. Those papers seem to love reporting on my every decision. There was a buzz feed article the other day debating my choice of smoothie for lunch.”
“Hey Steve, do me a favour and whenever you’re done with T’Challa’s business, take the night off. You’re working too hard.”
“Captain.” Sitwell greeted, buttoning up his coat. Steve could see his eyes slip over to the hammer in Thor’s hand.
“Well, that’s what family does, right?” Tony smiled, placing his empty coffee mug to the side to place a warm hand over Steve’s on his leg, “Speaking of family, I saw Natasha coming out of Bucky’s room this morning. They were laughing.”
It was a bold move to carve their tag into his chest. It was both disturbing and cruel and it would be just the thing to rally the cops together to launch a manhunt. So far, the police mostly left the gang stuff alone. They all knew there was no hope for a conviction and no one wanted to be on a gang hit list but if someone was killing their own officers then that unspoken rule was null and void. They’d chuck everything they had at Steve and his family if they thought they had enough evidence.
“And I thought the army was bad.” Steve laughed, “I’ll never complain about having to drag a rifle through mud and wire again.”
“He runs a garage over the other side of town. I googled him, a little hole in the wall that opened just over a year ago and tripled its customer base in as little as three months. The reviews were impressive.” She replied with a shrug, “The website offered call outs in the area and Stark Autos prides itself on a fast service. I figured it was just what you needed to get the bike fixed.”
Steve shot his first bullet right into the neck of the guy he promised would die first. Steve was a man of his word. Everyone else charged or fired.
He had his earphones in, so he hadn’t heard Steve’s arrival, humming to himself as he smoothed a rag over the newly fixed metal of Steve’s car. Steve could see it gleaming from where he stood, Tony had done a good job.
The wound oozed blood sluggishly, staining the dark material of his blue jeans as Steve pulled the gun back to look at his handy work. Again, not a fatal wound but would hurt like hell if he tried to move or walk.
He nodded, pleased with his decision and went to shower. Hopefully, Peter hadn’t burned his fingers off in the time Tony had been obsessing like some creep over a spare of the moment kiss from a man he’d probably never see again.
Steve made it into the inner chamber, a large open room that formed the central base of the shipment yard. It had probably once been used as the loading bay, Steve could smell the salty air from the docks behind them and feel the harsh wind rolling in from the coast. Rumlow was waiting. He sat on a bunch of wooden crates, slightly rotting on one side. He had a gun in one hand, he loosened his grip as he inspected his fingernails on the other. Steve almost wanted to laugh, Rumlow had built himself a makeshift throne from wood and rot and was sitting on it like a king in his own right.
“Hydra operates out of the shipment yards that used to manufacture gunpowder. The only place in Brooklyn you’d find traces of that particular mixture trodden into the dirt. Thousands of men treading it into the soil for years on end.” Steve explained.
Rhodey sensed where this story was going, “What did the son of a bitch do?” He was checking Tony for injuries like it was second nature, “I’ll kill him.”
“You can and you will.” Natasha told him firmly, “Hydra isn’t attacking right now so you can take an evening. Head to Sam’s, get a drink, lose some tension on those shoulders.”
Nothing seemed out of the ordinary, no signs of anything being trashed or upturned. His dirty mugs still littering the side along with the letters he hadn’t got the chance to open yet. A carburettor still sat on the coffee table from where Tony had been tinkering with it the night before.
“Tony, you have to be quiet.” Steve responded, eyes darting to the door as if someone might come in at any moment.
“I don’t want you.” Steve got out with a shaky breath and he knew immediately the moment Tony registered those words. His eyes grew wide and his lower jaw trembled, “I don’t feel anything for you. I’m sorry.”
"Well, that's what happened," Tony snaps, immediately defensive again. "Hate to break it to you, Bruce, but Captain America isn't perfect."
So, no, Steve isn’t about to come looking for Tony any time soon, and there’s absolutely no point in hanging around thinking he might. Tony’s going to his shop, and he’s staying there until JARVIS starts calling for reinforcements to get him to leave.
Except Clint has apparently missed the memo about how they're supposed to be ignoring the fact that Tony's hitting the bottle pretty hard, because he doesn't hand over the beer like Tony expects him to.
He has to know Steve always checks with JARVIS before going to find him, but Steve still like that he’s essentially making a plan for them, even if it’s just a plan for Steve to spend the evening sat on the couch doodling while Tony works.
"Don't," Tony interrupts, and it hurts, the way he's looking at him. The combination of denial and comprehension, that he understands but doesn't believe, and Steve wishes his stupid moral compass didn't point due north all the time, that he could have accepted what Tony was offering rather than doing this to him.
"Don't give me that look, Bruce, it wasn't my idea." Still, Tony's not actually all that offended by his scepticism, since his own reaction to Steve first suggesting it was every bit as disbelieving, with a healthy measure of surprise mixed in. "It was… Okay, the first time, it was after the thing with the sewer 'gators, a few months after me and Pepper broke up. You remember, Steve nearly lost a leg to one of them, and we got back all hyped up on adrenaline and relief, and it just- happened, Jesus, Bruce, you have no idea-"
They're in a little town not too far outside of Omsk celebrating the absolute obliteration of another Hydra base with crappy beers and a debate about their next destination when they're interrupted by Steve's phone ringing.
Tony reaches for the closest mug, trying to stall long enough to work out what it is. He doesn't realise until it's at his mouth that the mug is unfortunately empty, but Bruce doesn't know that; Tony styles it out, smacking his lips as he puts it back down, and he still has no idea at all what the fuck Bruce could be talking about other than the obvious. Clearly, it's time to play dumb. "Sorry, me and who?"
"Yeryar," Tony mumbles, pulling his head far enough from where it's pillowed on Steve's shoulder to smirk at him. Steve gives him his best
He'll get with the program eventually, now that's he's standing on his own, and the hotel will make for a lot better location to have the conversation he and Steve are very much overdue.
"JARVIS says I have to eat here so you guys stop fretting," Tony paraphrases, in answer to Bruce's questioning look. "Anything I like in this lot?"
His parents loved him. Tony knows that, even if it was twenty years after their deaths before he realised his dad didn't think he was a complete and utter waste of space.
Tony came was a shudder, come coating both their stomachs where his cock was pressing between them. He groaned around Steve’s fingers, the sound muffled and not nearly as vocal as he’d normally be. Steve guided him through it, rubbing the little bundle of nerves until Tony had managed to wring out every bit of pleasure from his orgasm before he released Steve’s fingers and Steve slowly withdrew his own from Tony’s hole.
He nearly jumped out of his seat when his phone buzzed on the arm next to him. He hadn’t expected a reply, at least he hadn’t hoped for one. He was quick to pick up his phone and open the message. His heart sank when he realised it was from T’Challa, not Tony.
Steve pulled his hand away and dropped it back down on the mattress between them, “You don’t have to tell me, Tony.”
Steve wanted to say they’d make time. That nothing was more important than this but he knew Tony was right, “I have an exit, you need a ride?” He asked instead, couldn’t resist the teasing in his voice at having Tony safe and back with him.
He settled back into the bed; legs crossed with the sketchpad in his lap. He spared a glance at Steve, drawing his bottom lip into his mouth before darting his eyes back to the book in his hand and opening the front page.
Steve understood perfectly, “He’s out for blood. All of it.” He gave a sigh and Tony had never seen him looking for worn, “It wasn’t meant to be like this. If they hadn’t been seen, then this would have worked.”
“But look at him!” Peter replied, stroking the cat’s fur as he climbed into the Kid’s lap, “He likes us.”
He released the dusty bud, dragging his mouth back up towards Tony’s throat, sucking a mark into his skin just above the collarbone. Tony preened, pulling at Steve’s hair and rocking his hips a little bit firmer against Steve’s stomach.
So, when Tony walked into the shop with a coffee in his hands to see Peter in the entrance way playing laser tag with a stray cat, he figured he shouldn’t have been surprised. He had the laser pointer from the office and was waving it wildly around the pavement for his new furry friend to chase. Tony was sure the kid was enjoying it more than the cat at this point, the look of pure glee on his face was a sight to behold.
Tony was hovering over him in a second, hands on either side of Steve’s face, “Neither. I can’t stomach either.” He said fiercely, “We could leave? We get Rumlow off the streets and it’s done. We all leave, the whole family. We’d have to split up for a while, work our way to a meeting point but we could start over. Somewhere new. I wouldn’t have to deal with Howard. You wouldn’t have to live up to the legacy of The Captain. We could be free.”
Steve groaned underneath him, bucking his hips up against Tony’s as he panted at Tony’s administrations, “Tony.”
Tony ran a hand through his hair, “It seemed like you wanted it this morning when you were blowing me but maybe I read that wrong.” The venom in his voice was something Steve never wanted aimed at him and yet he knew he deserved every second of it.
“Tony?” Steve said although it sounded more like a question. He looked tired, Tony could see the dark circles under his eyes and the paleness of his skin. It looked even more washed out next to all the orange he was wearing.
“Our new boss.” Sitwell smirked, “Hydra’s entering a new age and our new leader isn’t scared of you.”
Tony’s forehead was still pressed against his, “I’ve never come like that before,” He whispers between them, still out of breath, “Without someone jerking me off.”
He felt the saw drop to the ground with a clang although he couldn’t recall dropping it. His eyes fixed on the body before him, the body he had hacked apart with nothing more than a saw and his own brute strength.
“Because I believe you. I believe that you care about them more than yourself. I believe you want to make this city a better place, a safer one. I believe that Rumlow needs to be stopped and you’re probably the only person who can do it.” Fury said, “And I believe that you’re a better man than you think you are, Steve Rogers. You’re the kind of guy I’d want on my team.”
He had experience with this. Back in the army, all those missions on foreign soil where they had to work quickly, he developed a skill for seeing things other people couldn’t. A shift in the soil that looked recent could suggest a hole was dug up in the ground for an IUD. A downwards pull of a coat that looked like it was weighed down by heavy pockets could mask a bomb underneath. It was all in the little details, the small things that didn’t add up. Anyone could see the evidence staring right at them but it took a trained eye to spot the small things that didn’t fit with the scene.
“I might be able to design something.” Tony’s voice cut through the hazy of the situation, “I presented at a conference on prosthetics once when I was drunk and only seventeen. I think I can make something sleeker than the run-of-the-mill models.”
“We both know you didn’t do this.” Fury responded, “Your friend with the sassy mouth was right, it’s sloppy and there is something that doesn’t add up. Rhodes thinks it doesn’t much matter either way. A gang is a gang, if we can take one of you down then it’s the first step in bringing Brooklyn back into some sort of order.”
She spoke as she worked, “They used to make us practice standing on our toes before we even got the slippers. If you couldn’t hold it for an hour then you didn’t get to dance.” Her nimble fingers easily pulled the ribbon loose and slipped the slipper from her foot.
“Hey honey, how was your day?” Tony mocked with a wider grin as he sipped his coffee, feet gently thudding against the cupboards. Steve caught sight of a flash of tanned skin at Tony’s side, a silver of teasing making his mouth water.
Steve’s arms went around his back, “Oh yeah, bedroom eyes.” He planted a kiss on Tony’s mouth for good measure.
“We should get cleaned up,” Steve muttered, fingers tracing the bite marks he left in Tony’s shoulder through his shirt.
“I want you to build me a Jericho,” Rumlow replied and Tony could feel the dread pooling in his gut, “I asked your father first, but he insisted he couldn’t make it work. I planned to kill him, but you can imagine my surprise when he told me you had figured out a way to create a fully functional missile.”
Steve looked like he wanted to say something, but they were out of time. They both startled at the three timid knocks at the door. Their time was up.
Sam spoke up then, “I’ll do it. We’re both A positive. We got tested in the army, it was the first thing we bonded over when we met. The only thing we had in common.”
“I’m getting closer. Steve has been helping me for years, using his leads and contacts to get information. I’ll find him,” Thor said with a venom that Tony had never heard him possess before, “My point is, that darkness Steve and I both share. Steve knows if he fails this family, he’ll end up like me. He’ll be the same kind of monster I am but there won’t be anyone to save him like he saved me. He’ll do anything to stop that from happening.”
Tony was silent for a long time and Steve hated it, he could almost imagine him turning the statement over in his mind, “What?” He said bluntly and his voice sounded odd after the silence before it.
He needed to figure out who was in charge of Hydra now, it was going to be the only way to find out how big of a threat this new leader was posing to his family and how immediately Steve needed to act. Thanks to Sitwell he already had a lead on the guy being army but that didn’t make him feel better, army men could be ruthless and were always highly intelligent. Especially the ones who went into organised crime.
Steve went to the music system in the corner, clicking the pause button which got his guest’s attention.
He could practically hear T’Challa’s brain working through his request as Steve headed down the stairs from his floor to the one below, “That’s a big ask, Captain. How do you even know he’s a recent returnee and not someone who left the service years ago?”
Steve Rogers was many things. He was loyal, he was a fighter, a survivor. He was stubborn and resilient, and he never walked away from a fight. Even if he knew it was one he might lose.
Tony took up the right end of the couch, Thor sat next to him and gave him a smile and a pat on the back in greeting. Bruce was in the arm chair, a mug in his hands that if Tony had to guess was the only thing keeping him awake right now. He looked tired, wrecked. Had he been volunteering at the clinic today? Bucky sat on the edge of the arm of Bruce’s chair, arms crossed. He was the only one who didn’t look happy to see Tony but he wasn’t quite scowling yet so Tony would take that as a win. Sam and Clint were the only ones missing and Tony wondered where they were, what was more important than finding out how to free Steve?
Tony wanted to laugh or throw something. He wasn’t sure which. “Well, I think he probably meant to cancel that order when we broke up.”
“Maybe your style changed.” Rhodes cut in, “The body was found at the docks. Your Captain is known to do frequent business there.”
Steve sighed, trying to keep his anger in check as he placed his hands on his hips, “You think I don’t know that? I asked you to take the immunity deals, didn’t I? I told you to stay out of it when I went to get Tony. If you think my main concern isn’t this family…”
“Thanks,” Steve replied, eyes moving away from his sketch to land on Bucky. He looked at tired as Steve did, “Late night?”
If anyone understood that need for change, it was Steve. The man who turned himself in a mob boss and made an entire city respect and fear him in order to ensure his own survival. Tony didn’t think for a second Steve always enjoyed being a mob boss, having the safety of other people on his shoulders but he carried that weight because it grounded him. It was why he needed to continue surviving, no matter the cost.
He made his way to the kitchen with a scowl, trainers on the hardwood floor and sweat making his t-shirt cling to him uncomfortably. His hair was sticking to his forehead and as much as he wanted a shower, he followed the sound of his friend’s voices instead.
Typical Howard, ask for an inch and take a mile. Tony’s stomach churned at the idea of sitting around a table with this man, “One night. One course meal. No extras.”
Steve pushed himself away from Rumlow in disgust, sliding to the concrete next to him with heavy breath and shaky hands. Rumlow had left him to die in Afghanistan. He’d gone out of his way to leave Steve in the desert. Because Steve challenged him? Stood to up him? This is what Rumlow did when people got in his way, he got rid of them.
He wasn’t sure how much time had passed, there was no way to mark time in this place. No window to see night turn into morning or clock that ticked the hours down for him. It had been hours; he knew that much from the ache in his back at the metal chair that did nothing to support him comfortably.
The kiss was nothing short of dirty, sucking on Tony’s tongue as he bit at Steve’s lower lip. It was a battle for dominance, a spark that had turned into a wildfire. Steve pulled him closer, stealing the oxygen from Tony’s lungs and humming when he felt Tony’s hands on the back of his neck, fingers scratching at the ends of his hair.
He did it again, moving his fingers out to the tip before thrusting them back in, waiting until they were deep inside Tony to curl them forward again and hit his prostate. Tony’s eyes fluttered close, cock jerking against his stomach and Steve could feel him gripping his shoulders a little tighter.
“Maybe I’m just happy to see you?” Steve flirted before he could stop himself. Tony paused then, one eyebrow raised and Steve could feel himself flushing. God, he was one of the most feared people in New York and he was turning red at a stranger.
Steve hummed again when he felt Tony’s heel digging into him, urging him on and felt his cock jerk in his mouth. He pulled back up before sinking back down on the length again, watching with glee as Tony’s breath stuttered in his throat. His hands were knuckle white against the sheets as Steve swallowed down around him.
“Because he’s on Hydra’s payroll and if we really are going to win this war, we need the leverage. He’d be a great credible witness against Hydra for the cops and Rumlow knows it. We can use him.” Tony replied.
He turned around to meet eyes clouded with betrayal and a firm stance. Steve swallowed thickly, words rushing to the surface before dying on his throat.
Steve wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist, pulling him all the way in until their foreheads were pressed together, “Consider it done. I love you. I do. But is this really want you want? This life?”
Tony was acutely aware of Steve’s eyes on him, “Yeah, I got work to do. Peter’s probably managed to electrocute himself by now or he’s accidently invented time travel or something. You never know with that kid.”
Howard blanched at the intrusion, sitting behind his desk with a bottle of whisky open and papers in front of him. Tony glared as Bucky shut the door behind them. Howard was practically beaming.
Tony could feel the bile rising in his throat, Rumlow didn’t even look fazed by the threats. It was another day at the office for him, just like it would be for Steve. For a split second, Tony wished Steve was coming for him. He wished he had the protection of a man like that when there was shit like Rumlow roaming the streets.
Tony was in the clear, home and dry, only Steve and the team knew about what really happened to Ross and they always protected their own. Tony had done it to protect them after all. There wasn’t a discussion to be had other than to assure Tony he was safe and he was family.
Steve sighed, "I am. Everything is up against us right now. Even if we could somehow take down Rumlow and get him on killing these cops... we can't go up against Ross and win. He does this for sport, you think he'll spare any of you? He's coming and he is coming for all of us. I can't protect you from that. If I could, I'd slit Ross' throat myself but all that would do is cause someone else to come after us."
“I’m all in.” Tony replied in the space between them, “I want all of you, Steve. Not just the nice bits. I want the messy ones as well. It’s all mine, okay? That’s what I choose. You want me to say it? Fine, I want all of it. I want to know everything, the good, the bad, the bloody. I want to be the one you come to when you’re stuck in your own head. I want to be the one you lean on for support instead of carrying it all on your shoulders. I want you.”
“I’m sorry I ever made you doubt that this was anything other than that. A relationship. A partnership. That’s all I wanted, and I was a coward who didn’t want you to get dragged into my crap but I know I should have let you make that decision for yourself. I was scared you’d leave if I did.”
“Or he’s planning something else incase it doesn’t.” Thor mused, “Our Captain is smart, he’s also not the type of man to gamble with our lives on a maybe. He doesn’t like to leave things up to fate.”
Tony found himself wanting to know more about this side of Steve that apparently helped out people in need and funded medical clinics so people could get treatment when they couldn’t afford a hospital, “The most feared mob boss in Brooklyn gives to charity?”
He’d done it. Tony had gotten himself free of Howard’s legacy and was putting himself first. He’d told Steve that running SI would end up making him miserable, so Steve had challenged him to change it and Tony had. He would still have the garage and consult for Stark Industries in their new ambitious project but he was still free from the grip of his father and the world of the press that Steve knew he hated so much. In the past two weeks alone, there had been hordes of stories and coverage on Tony’s ability to take over from Howard, his partying ways and the mistakes he’d made as a teenager. Any bad thing linked to him had shown up in full force.
“Don’t.” Barnes instructs, because just that expression has been enough to set him off sometimes. “You keep looking at me like that, you and me are definitely going to have a problem.”
She shrugs and then, slowly enough to give him the chance to pull away if he wishes, she reaches out, resting her free hand, still so small and fragile, atop his. “It was a long time ago,” she says pragmatically, as though Barnes doesn’t know perfectly well that there are some pains time doesn’t touch.
Most days, putting on the armour is like… well, it's like putting on armour, a physical barrier between him and everything else in the world. In the armour, no one can touch him, no one can even get close. It's safe, comfortable and so reassuring, the best thing on Earth as far as Tony is concerned.
Natasha, on the other hand, isn't, so Tony isn't going to tell her that she's right. Steve can't ever be allowed to see what's in the file.
"How long were you two together?" Bruce asks; despite Tony's best efforts to completely ignore his questions, Bruce hass apparently not got the message just yet, so Tony's going to have to be really fucking blunt about it.
JARVIS doesn't answer immediately, delaying longer than Bruce has ever known him to. It can't possibly take him so long to work out whether offering confirmation is within his parameters, so Bruce has to assume it results from a conflict between what he wants to do, what he considers to be of greatest benefit to Tony, and what he thinks Tony actually wants him to do.
His lips are exactly as Steve remembers them, the gentle scratch of his facial hair, the way he teases and encourages and teases some more, only pausing when he absolutely has to in order to breathe, and even then it's only for as long as necessary and definitely not a second longer. His hands are everywhere, sliding under Steve's clothes and threading through his hair, and Steve is on fire, desperate for another kiss, another touch, another inch of Tony's skin bared for him to see and touch and taste.
It's hard, when his parents' deaths are playing in his head in 4K ultra-HD with fucking surround sound and all that shit, for Tony to think of Steve as anything other than an obstacle standing between him and their murderer.
Steve doesn’t think he meant it as an actual instruction, but he’s perfectly happy to take it as one; when he completes his current lap of the park, he immediately heads for the tower, slowing to a slightly more reasonable pace in deference to the number of pedestrians on the street.
. Treating a physical illness is largely a matter of cross-referencing symptoms to reach a diagnosis and then finding a form of treatment that works for the patient; Bruce might have taught himself the vast majority of what he knows, but he does know it, and he's usually only called upon to provide medical assistance because there's no qualified alternatives available. Mental health, on the other hand, is vastly more complicated, and Bruce has no training to help people dealing with psychological trauma, no experience beyond learning to handle his own comparatively pedestrian issues (he's not dismissing the impact of his childhood or of the Other Guy, but since he's not dealing with torture, brainwashing or the death of just about everyone he's ever known, Bruce doesn't like to complain too much).
of it all, and he hasn't." Tony shakes his head, swaps his empty mug for the closest screwdriver just so that he has something to do with his hands. "I reached out, and he hasn't reached back."
"The fact that I'm wincing just watching you do that does not mean I won't shoot you," Tony points out, because the Soldier's right hand is now emerging ever so slowly from behind his back.
“That wasn’t-” Steve starts, then has to stop himself, because he can’t honestly say he didn’t ask Tony to lie for him. No, the most he can do is say that he didn’t ask Tony to lie to everyone. “I mean, it was only you I asked him not to tell. He chose not to tell the others.”
Steve is out of there like a rocket the second the bay door opens enough for him to squeeze himself through, and Sam regrets not wearing the wings as he dashes after him. It had seemed overkill back when he was planning for this moment, not to mention fairly uncomfortable to sleep in on the jet, but it would have made it easier to keep up with Steve and he sort of thinks the articulated shielding might come in handy.
As much as he was expecting to be discovered, the asset was not ready to see the son of two of his victims.
Looking at it that way, all the effort Steve’s put into keeping his feelings to himself seems a lot more like selfishness than self-preservation.
look, not that it's anything like as impressive as Steve or Pepper's, though it is probably on a par with Rhodey's. Unlike any of the others, Bruce doesn't try back up his disapproval with an attempt to talk Tony out of a bottle.
Peggy does a good job of keeping up, asking the right questions at the right time, every bit as supportive as she was when Tony would run to her or to Jarvis and Ana for all the attention Howard wasn't giving him.
In response to his obtuseness, Bucky reaches out, taking the mug from Steve’s hand and draining it, glaring at Steve the entire time.
“There is,” Stark replies, still quiet, expressionless as he looks up at Barnes again. “JARVIS found it, I watched it. A lot, actually. Got wasted, trashed the ‘shop, cried over them for probably the first time since the funeral, whole thing was a hideous mess I'd rather forget about entirely. Still doesn't mean you’re responsible.”
Tony needs to know that, Steve thinks. He already feels more than enough guilt over the legacy Howard left him, takes on far too much in his efforts to make amends for Howard's wrongdoings, both accidental and otherwise. Steve can't let him believe that his father was the kind of person who could do this, not for the sake of Howard's reputation but because Tony shouldn't spend a single day thinking something like that could be in his genes. Because Tony shouldn't feel responsible for fixing this as well.
(After, when he's done cleaning up DUM-E's attempt at cleaning up, Tony has JARVIS open a new email, only to sit staring up at the taunting blink of the cursor on the blank, blank page.
“Right,” Steve says, sort of shaking himself out of whatever stupor he’s in. “I made dinner, if-” He sort of motions in the direction of the table, which Tony is just now noticing has been laid properly, with the good cutlery and the even better plates, the stuff Pepper picked out back when this was her home too.
For the first time since he lost Riley, Sam has hope that the good flying dreams might not be as gone as he thought they were.
The failed mission is another matter. The asset's research suggests the mission is tenacious, unlikely to call off the hunt for the asset, and since the asset failed to kill him before there's no reason to believe it can kill him now, even in self defence.
"Oh," Tony says, then kicks into the overdrive, mile-a-minute way he talks when he's not entirely comfortable. "Hey, well, since you're here, d'you want to come in? Share a drink? Or not, whatever, it was just a-"
Clint shrugs. “I mean, I asked him if he was okay with Bucky or if it was some kid nickname he wanted to get rid of and he’d prefer something else, and that’s what he said, so…”
