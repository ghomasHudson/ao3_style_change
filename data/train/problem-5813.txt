The ground started to shake violently underneath Tony’s feet as screams and cries filled the air. Tony kept his eyes closed shut, arms wrapped around himself as he tried to block all those desperate, broken voices out of his head but he was never able to do so. Men and women calling out names, children screaming for help, louder and louder, as his chest began feeling heavy and his head began to spin violently. An horrible sinking feeling dragged him down in what Tony always assumed to be a pool of blood, but he never had the courage to open his eyes.
-Technically, she's an outlaw- Tony pointed out, reaching out to grab the paper bag but Peter frowned and turned to face Wanda, causing Tony to miss the bag.
Tony swallowed hard as he forced his eyes to focus on the figure that was laying on the bed next to him.
Steve wasn't able to process what was happening for at least five seconds. He felt a pair of soft lips being pressed against his own, moving slowly, confidentially. And Steve had no idea how, or why, but he found himself kissing back. Tony's hands slipped on his tights, pushing  the body of the soldier gently against the wall. Steve broke the kiss, gasping for air, staring at the big hazel eyes of the other one.
-I think he's fallen asleep- the reply came from Wanda and Tony quickly glanced at the rearview mirror, looking at Peter's body curled against Wanda's, and he couldn't help but smile a little.
-Oh- Peter's face went blank, the turned bright red in less than a second -I didn't think of that. B-but I brought you a Donut! Oh— hi Wanda!
She wasn't provoking him. She wasn't being sarcastic, either. She was lowering her defenses, asking him that question that had been buzzing in Tony's mind for so long now. That question that had him awake at night at the craziest hours, that question that had him doubt of his plan more than one time.
-Several times. I know you see me as some kind of selfish idiot or— I don't even know, but I swear I was only trying to do the right thing. I was trying to protect you—
-I think... you two need some time alone. Please don't kill each other- Natasha said, giving a small squeeze at Steve's shoulder, walking past Tony and he could swear he had seen a hint of a smile on her lips. The two men waited for the other three to leave before to look up at each other again. Tony's breath was short, his heart was beating like he had just run a marathon.
Tony wrapped his arms around Steve, gripping his shirt as if he was some kind of salvation, his lifeline.
-He kind of reminds me of Pietro- the girl admitted in a soft murmur and Tony's eyes instinctively went to the rearview mirror, once again. Wanda was looking outside the car window and Tony decided not to insist on the argument, he was actually quite surprised to hear such a personal comment from the girl.
wasn’t bad enough. The only difference between the other falls and this one was that in the past, Tony had always tried to pick up the broken pieces on the ground, he had always tried to put them back together, just for them to be smashed down again and again. Now, he laid there, broken, tired, tired of falling, and he didn’t even want to try to get up again. He was broken and tired of breaking up, but that was the point: he couldn’t break again if he was already broken. It was easier than building up fake hopes all over again, they wouldn’t last, it would hurt and Tony was so tired of hurting. Of course he had to survive. Of course, life had to make fun of him till his last breath. Tony didn’t know if that was some kind of fucked up karma or whatever, but he knew that he was tired of being a survivor.
The two guys heard footsteps down the alley growing lower and lower, till there was nothing but silence and the heavy breathing of the two boys to fill the air. Steve's arms were still around Tony and the shorter one was staring at him, holding back a laughter.
-I…sure, yeah, it's all right- Tony answered, lifting his head up slightly while his chest was still pressed against Steve's.
-Tony- Steve moved the other one aside right before the engine exploded in the air, leaving a big could of smoke behind and an awful burning smell. Steve stared at the broked machine on the floor, then his attention turned to the man he was holding protectively.
They walked for a couple of minutes and Tony's heart missed a beat when his eyes met two figures laying on the grass, chatting quietly with their eyes closed. He was right, Steve was with Nat and Tony was glad to know that at least they weren't alone. He took a couple of steps forward, followed by Wanda and Peter.
Steve tilted his head gently and he finally could see into those big doe eyes, he could see sorrow, he could see fear. His heart broke at that sight and his hand came to wipe away the tears that were streaming down Tony’s face.
-I miss you too- Steve said slowly and Tony's legs moved forward on their own accord, till his body was crashing on Steve's one in a tight, warm hug. Tony's face was buried in the corner of Steve's neck, hiding the tears that he couldn't hold back anymore and Steve was holding him tight, strong arms wrapped around the smaller man that wouldn't stop shaking.
-Wanda- he said slowly, looking up at the young girl. She had changed in the past months, Tony could see it. She looked skinnier, paler, arms and face marked by little cuts and bruises here and there. She looked tired, too, but she didn't look like an outlaw. She just looked like a kid that had been through a lot. -Please, listen to me.
-You could have just phoned me- the blond said and Tony shook his head, distractedly playing with a pebble.
-Don't kill me- Steve quickly added, blushing a bit and raising his hands -I'm just saying… that maybe you could well… breathe for ten minutes, how does that sound?
-Right- Tony said with a frown, shaking his head. He pressed a button on the front of the black steering wheel and a blue screen appeared right in front of the man.
They had been back in the car for an hour now, a nice and absolutely not-Peter-like silence had fallen on them and of course Tony didn't miss to notice it.
The nightmares had started after some weeks Thanos had wiped away half of the universe, and that’s just because for the first weeks he hadn’t been able to sleep at all. It was New York all over again, but this time the price to pay had been higher. The highest they could have paid. Tony had tried everything, he had tried to stay awake for weeks, but eventually his body had started to suffer from it, his defenses had lowered and that’s when the nightmares had started. At first it was Peter’s death. At first, it was just sorrow, it was Peter’s eyes filled with fear and panic, it was his body turning into dust every night for weeks. Then the sorrow turned into self-loathing and that’s when the dreams started changing. That’s when he started dreaming about that trade, his life for half of the universe, a life that Tony didn’t want anymore, a life that had pushed him over the edge more than once, yet every time the fall wasn’t high enough,
-Strange knew what he was doing. He saw what was about to happen and Tony, if your life was worth an infinity stone then you shouldn’t even think of throwing it away.
-Okay, here we are. Wake up the spider kid- Tony took a deep breath while Wanda gently shook Peter's shoulder, telling him they were there. Tony parked the car in a quiet parking lot, looking at the blue screen one more time. There were a couple of houses around them, a bar where two old men were sitting outside playing cards and a little wood right across the desert street. That's where Steve was, according to the locator he had installed in his suit.
But was it, really? He allowed himself to trust Steve, one last time. And maybe he had just unconsciously picked up the pieces again, maybe that promise had cost him another try, another breakdown. He couldn’t know but he was tired of resisting, and he smiled, a tired smile that was far too genuine, far too broken, and far too relived to be a lie. And he knew Steve was smiling as well, but he didn’t dare to look up at him. Maybe was just too scared, too scared to know that he had made a mistake. Maybe right now, he just wanted his temporary solution.
-Please don't crack…- Tony murmured, taking a step back as the small engine lifted itself up in the air. The timer on the desk passed 10 seconds and Steve smiled proudly as Tony's grin grew wider.
Tony nodded in Steve's chest refusing to break the hug, but Steve wasn't complaining. He instead smiled, rubbing his hand on Tony's back in an attempt to calm him down.
-Is he near?- Wanda asked, eyes still fixed on the lonely road they were traveling and Tony's eyes met the blue screen of JARVIS monitor again.
-I—I tried to be as fast as I could, I asked Happy to tell you I was going to be late but he ignored me, so I couldn't warn you—
-I know-Steve said, kissing his forehead as he closed his eyes. –And I wish there was a way to make it easier. I wish I could just free you from all the pain and the anger and tell you that it’s all over, tell you that it will be alright and that there are no more decisions to make, no more sacrifices, no more fights. But I would lie. And a lie is so appealing, it has such a sweet taste at first, but then it only ends up hurting, because a lie is no more than a lie, a temporary solution that doesn’t change the fact that sooner or later, we have to face reality.
The last piece of the infernal engine flew on the other side of  the room, hitting the wall with a solid thump and finally crashed on the floor. Both guys froze for a couple of minutes, then they heard a knock on the lab's door.
-Yeah…- Tony whispered, closing his eyes. But he suddenly opened them again, unable to stand the darkness, not that soon.
-You two get along well- the man noticed, trying to hold a conversation. He had been staring at that red star on his monitor for too long now, he needed a distraction from it and from the knot in his stomach that was getting tighter and tighter.
It wasn’t enough. In so deep to make it hard for him to breathe but not enough to make it impossible.
-It was just a bad dream- Steve said softly, Tony’s grip was strong, his muscles tense as if Steve could fade away in any moment. Well, how could you blame him after all.
-Uh y-you okay?- he asked, loosening his grip on the scientist's arms. Tony wasn't even paying attention to Steve's evident embarrassment, the smile on his face was gone.
And when his eyes snapped open it was still dark. But no blood nor dust was dragging him down. The room was silent, except for his heavy breathing and the ticking of the clock. Everything was so calm, so quiet, still and frozen, so perfect that it seemed unrealistic. His t-shirt was wet, his skin cold and yes, he was still breathing. But he wasn’t alone.
Steve rolled his eyes, holding back a chuckle. He was glad Tony was back. He was glad to have him in his arms, he was glad to be able to look into those doe eyes again, he was glad to feel home again.
-I saved your ass as many times but no locator helped me- Steve said with a small smirk and Tony giggled quietly, rubbing his eyes with the back of his hand.
-Hey- Steve murmured, tiredness evident in his voice but he managed to smile up at Tony and the man reached out for his hand, an impulse that he couldn’t – and maybe didn’t even want to stop. Steve held his cold hand in his own, drawing small circles on the top of it, still trying to catch Tony’s gaze.
-Oh, don't puppy-eye me- the girl said with a small smile, hitting the boy's arm playfully and Peter smiled back.
-I'm sorry Mr Sta- I mean Tony- Steve quickly corrected himself, cursing under his breath for how pathetic he was being. But the shorter man smiled again and Steve thought that at least, being a pathetic idiot was worth something.
-You can keep hugging me in the car, Stark. I don't want you to drive anyway, you look tired as hell.
Tony looked at him again, but Steve couldn't read him. How he hated that face Tony pulled sometimes,  that face that was so familiar yet so illegible.
-Yeah, okay…- he muttered with a sigh, kicking aside one of the small pieces of the engine. Steve bit his lip, unsure of what to do. Sure, Tony's prototypes  had gone wrong many times before, after all, the big success he had wasn't made of only good projects and perfect machines. Success requires mistakes and hard work and they both knew it. But lately the young Stark wouldn't give himself a break. He would work night and day on many different things, he would get pissed at every failure and Steve didn't know how to tell him that all that pressure he was putting himself into was only affecting him in a negative way. He didn't have the right to tell him to stop, to put everything away and give himself a break, even if oh how often he had been close to do it in the past weeks. But this was Tony Stark. Brilliant but terribly stubborn. And Steve… well Steve didn't even know why the young scientist had asked him to stay and help him if all he did was standing there, worrying about Tony and his experiments.
To Steve's disappointment Tony didn't show up before dinner. The table was set and the food served. Howard's wife Maria had made her appearance a few minutes before but the genius was still no where in sight.
Truth to be told this chapter was ready to post since last week but I wanted to wait because today is my amaZayn's baby's birthday! Happiest of birthdays Zaynieeeeee I absolutely adore you!Nobody Is Listening will be out on 15th go listen to is as well as Vibez and Better!
"Tony... I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable but why were you ready to do that? " I knew it! "Well I don't really want to talk about it" I avoid his eyes. " I understand" He simply says.
"I told you I don't want to get in trouble you didn't stop so I'm just gonna leave now and you can start looking for an employee who won't mind your activities. " He says instead and without waiting for an answer turns around and walks out the door.
" Okay I know all of this will sound crazy to you but I'm the real Steve Rogers and I come from the future... " He began...
He felt worse than he had in a while. He remembered every argument he had with the younger man. Everything felt so meaningless now. How easy would've been to solve every little problem, if only Tony was still by his side.
So after the dance he explained to her that they couldn't be happy together and looked for the one person that he always felt at home with, Tony.
"Okay have two cheeseburgers with extra fries and a chocolate milkshake each please" Steve makes their order.
He looks back at the piece of paper on his desk and he knows he can't walk away this time. And as he stares at Tony's soft handwriting he realizes that he doesn't want to.
"Alright. I first met him about two weeks ago that night neither of you could come and I was by myself. Long story short he came in with an other man I guess for business. He was so rude. Anyway after my shift ended I was locking the door when he came back to look for his keys he didn't find them it was late so I invited him to spend the night in my place. "
"I don't understand what you're talking about. " Steve says quietly a desperate attempt to avoid the topic.
After a while he figured he should go back and as he walked out the room the moment he had been waiting for so long  finally came. Out of the door stood Tony. Alone.
"You know what I want? To sleep" Tony deadpans but as he's sees his boyfriend happy face fall he adds " Okay you big big baby I'm up! "
"Finally! I thought you changed your mind, love" Steve shouts as soon as he opens the door to his penthouse.
He leaves me laying on the floor. I stand up trying not to scream from the pain. Tears bubble in my eyes as I head to the toilets.
He opens the door and he barely has time to breathe before he's "attacked" by a tall man shouting "Tones!"
So that's how Steve finds himself two weeks after his lunch with Tony in front of the cafe's door trying to stay calm. He hasn't stopped thinking about the short brunet the whole time and he can't help his nervousness.
For a moment he's afraid that his heart will explode with all this cuteness. Tony seems even younger when he's sleeping. He's mouth is slightly open and he makes soft noises.
"I don't know let's see" He answers and drives closer."I think it's a festival. Oh look there's a ferris wheel! Let's go! "
Tony walks in the cafe to see it empty of costumers but his best and only friends -Clint and Natasha- are sitting on the counter chatting about Natasha's english teacher.
" Oh I see... So did you do dirty stuff? " Bucky asks and the blond can almost see the knowing smirk in his friend's face.
"Not your fault" Tony's voice was void of emotion.  "Anyway we had no money or alive relatives. It was just us. Me and my parents. And then it was just me. I was put in a foster home. It's not of the best years of my life... "
"So you're looking for Tony huh? " She continues " He's actually not here at the moment he called sick this morning but I have to tell you... If you ever do anything to hurt him I'll make sure you're dead within an hour "
" First of all thank you for not saying anything. " I know he has some other things to tell me but I cut him off "Tony I could never say something if you don't want me to. It's your life you make the decisions but I need you to know that if you want someone to talk I'll be there. Here's my number don't hesitate to call or text me anytime" I say as I give him a paper with my number on.
Steve walks to the counter and take a deep plate to serve the soup he found in the fridge. He goes back to Tony and hands him the plate.
Natasha as well. Her loss is another thing he never expected or was ready to experience. She was always next to him whenever he needed her. A solid presence when he felt insecure about everything in this new, different, confusing century. He felt lost.
I look myself in the mirror and I hate me too. I can't stand the way I let them hurt me and see me broken every time.
After a while he's finished with last week's work and has nothing else to do. He decides to help with the paperwork. Obadiah has given him permission to deal with some of it himself. There's only a drawer that he's not allowed to open.
The head back to Tony's apartment and as the younger boy's ready to close the door Steve says "I had a great time... Hope you wanna do this again?"
The boy has spent the whole week thinking and he's come to conclusion that he's indeed in love with the billionaire. The question is did Steve really said it or it was just a beautiful dream? Should he ask or pretend he doesn't care?
"Well it wasn't a happy place. It was dark. We had to do all the work. Cooking, painting the walls, clean the place. A teacher would come twice a month to teach us the basics. If we did something wrong it came the punishment. We aren't kids. Well maybe we are in age and stuff but we were all made to grow up too fast too soon. I had a friend there. James Rhodes but I just called him Rhodey. He's older than me and he joined the air force three years ago. I run away on my 16th birthday. In about a month it will be two years since. "Tony's voice still had no emotion. Like he wasn't talking about his life. Like all those things happened to a stranger.
He doesn't say anything so I take a deep breath and continue. " I just want to say thank you for being there for me and help stand on my own feet. You make wanna live and this means a lot to me. Steve Rogers... You saved me. " I stop talking and he looks really surprised.
Tony moves his body a little and makes some space for Steve to lay. Steve gets under the blanket and cuddles the boy.
He recalled their last private moment together. When he had hold the smaller man in his arms for hours. They both knew that this was their last time. That after this battle nothing would ever be the same. They had spent the day before in each other's company. They had made sweet love, painfully slow, passionate, giving all of themselves in it. They had exchanged I love you's and soft kisses. And finally they had fallen asleep entwined.
It's around 8 o'clock when he hears a knock on his door. He lets a groan and goes to answer sure that it's whether Natasha or Clint. Who else could it be? It's been two weeks since he went on that date with Steve and he doesn't believe he'll see him ever again.
Howard was looking at him in shock like he'd seen a ghost. To be honest this was exactly what it looked like.
When he was little he used to live in the same house with his parents although they weren't always there. Even when they were though it wasn't like he really talked to them. He had a personal butler and a couple of maids to take care of him so his parents didn't have to check on him.
"Steve I can't do that and you know it! I have to do something on my own. Even if I come live at yours I have to give something back! "
His life has started to settle. The mornings he works in a repair shop as a mechanic the afternoons he works in a cafe and he attends high school courses online whenever he finds time so he'll be able to get a scholarship for college because there's no way he can pay anything.
They look around for a while but finally give up. " I don't think that you lost your keys in here sorry sir" " Yeah it doesn't seem possible. Also can you please stop calling me sir? It makes me feel like one hundred years old. " " As you wish Mr. Rogers " The boy say laughing " Well I guess as long as you have a way to get in your house or somewhere to spend the night I am not necessary anymore so it was nice to meet you " Tony doesn't wait for an answer and starts walking down the street.
"So during all these adventures I met you Tony. I mean the older you. At first we couldn't even stand being in the same room together." He let a soft nostalgic chuckle at the thought of all these times when he thought he was going to commit murder at the moment. "But then shit happened and you don't know how much you mean to me. We would stay up for hours together having deep conversations and messing around."
And yes Steve would be able to recognize this voice everywhere. He turned around quickly and he was faced with his soulmate. After all this time of picturing him dead he found it extremely difficult not to jump on the teen and hold on to him for dear life.
At first he felt like he couldn't be useful in anything but after a while the older man introduced him to his tech team and everything made sense. It's like he was born for this and he adores every moment. The engineers in the team seem to love him as well so he really couldn't ask for anything more. He still works at the cafe with Natasha and Clint even though Steve tells him he doesn't have to do anything but focusing on his studies.
The boy with a nod goes to the counter and starts making the drinks. He has learned how to make everything in the menu by now. He's working there more than a year. His only friends are the kids that he works with: Natasha the scariest girl he's ever seen (and he has lived in the streets) and Clint who is the most annoying person to ever walk the earth.
He brings the drinks to the men. The blond just takes a long sip and observes the teen. The brunet nods a thank you. They pay him the latter makes sure to give a generous tip and Tony goes back to the counter. Half an hour later the two men leave.
Finally after a bit of walking alone in the streets of the city he found himself in the SHIELD headquarters that hadn't changed their location all these years later.
After that he only saw his parents at special occasions and celebrations. He spent his Christmas spring and summer breaks either with at his friends mansions either in exotic islands and other countries.
Anyway this story is coming to an end only an epilogue is left. Thanks to everyone who read, voted or/and commented!
Tony heard Steve's soft voice whisper just before he let sleep take him. Now he's laying awake in the blond's bed watching the older man snoring softly and can't help thinking about those words.
I am not even sure if he's forget the idea of suicide but I know that I'll do anything to prevent it.
Tony excuses himself and walks to the back of the store to change clothes. He takes off his dirty tank top and puts on a little better red t-shirt. He looks at his reflection on the mirror and sighs. At least he has no holes in his shirt anymore.
They're all sitting in the living room when they hear a key on the door. Tony looks around in alarm but then he notices Steve just chuckling and shout "You really should stop doing this Buck you know I don't live alone anymore, you could walk in something you don't want someday"
The tension cuts hesitantly the brunet man " Hmm I would like a hot green tea if its not much trouble. " He says politely. "Of course whatever you want sir" " Bring me a scotch and quickly "comes from the blond who now has gotten over his surprise and leans back in the chair looking Tony in interest.
Tony immediately drops whatever he's doing and follows him. As he stops at the open door he's suddenly not sure what to do. Should he mention the files first or engage a small talk ?
Three years later he received the same call for his mother. He made the same mistake. When he arrived at the hospital she was already gone. Again he didn't feel loss. He didn't feel numb. He only felt a little sad because he had no parents and he didn't even got to know them before they were long gone. This time was different. This time he got to stay. He had to take over the company.
They finally stop in front of a simple wooden door. Tony takes out his keys and they get in. They're climbing the stairs quietly and Steve can't help but wonder what damned building hasn't an elevator. They come to a stop on the last floor .
They sit in silence while the younger boy eats. He finishes his meal and hands back the plate quietly. The blond leaves it to the sink and returns to Tony's side.
Natasha is the scariest person Tony's ever met. She's beautiful with her curly red hair and her green eyes but deadly. She notices everything and you can never know what she's thinking because of her perfect poker face. Clint notices a lot as well but he's not that scary simply due to his annoying habit of joking about everything.
It's my turn to water the plants in the roof today.I walk out of the elevator and open the door to the terrace.
They stare at each other for a moment and then they both step closer and meet in a kiss in the middle.
He was 7 years old when his father decided that the best for him and mostly for his and the company's future was to send him to a boarding school. There he met other kids just like him. Rich spoil children who doesn't know how the world works even though they practically own him.
"Wow! This is all too much to take in! You don't have to answer this but... Did we fuck?" Tony asked with a smug smirk in his face.
Huh of course not. It's called "being fashionably late" Steve had heard that more times than he could count. How many times had he got in an argument about this habit?
My bathroom is indeed bigger than this he thinks and suddenly feels bad for the kid who has gone through so much in his life that he's ended up staying at that tiny place without his parents and he's only 17.
When Tony's done he comes back in the main room. He's changed clothes and now he's wearing an old shirt and sweatpants. His hair is wet and falls on his forehead. He's not very different from his younger self. He's still cute.
For a moment he thought Howard would just leave and he'd lost any chances on going back to Tony but then the older man gestured for him to follow.
Tony lately has discovered that Obadiah deals with outlaws and they had plenty fights about it. The boy was outraged when he found out. He deserves to know if it's something dangerous. He works in the shop after all he could be in big trouble.
He comes closer. I try to avoid him but he punch me in the abdomen. I lose my balance and fall down. After a second I feel his kick on my ribs. I whimper and gasp for air.
"Anthony come hear right now!" My dad calls me. I walk in his office slowly. I don't want to let him know I am afraid of him but I don't dare to look him in the eyes.
I don't know what to say so I look at him and mumble a sorry. "You're disgusting" He tells me and let me go.
They reach Steve's penthouse. They don't talk and that's an other thing Steve loves about the boy. Even when there's only silence it's comfortable and relaxing not awkward.
But I can't do this. "Sorry but I can't do this. If I go away and let you jump I will never be okay with myself. I mean I can't let you die I just can't. " He sighs.
It's getting darker and colder when he realizes that the teen is wearing just a worn out jacket. " Hey kid aren't you freezing?! You're obviously not dressed properly for this weather! " " I have had worse" Tony shrugs.
-I'm about to do something- Tony informed calmly, raising up one finger- but you need to stay calm and get closer. And of course you have to trust me. Do you trust me Rogers?
-I’m not asking- Steve interrupted him and Tony froze, biting his lip –What happened it… it was fucked up.
Tony started kissing along Steve's jaw, leaving wet kisses on the pale skin, biting down teasingly on his neck and making the other one to hiss in surprise.
Tony stood there, petrified, his breath short and unsteady as his sight started to blur out, once again. He knew what was about to come. He recognized the dark, starless sky upon the wasteland of blood and dust in front of him, he recognized the cold, almost frosty air that would make his hands numb and his lips chapped, he recognized the howl of the wind, sharp like a knife against his wounded and bruised skin, naked of his precious armor, defenseless, vulnerable.
-what if it doesn't?- he asked softly, looking up at the other boy. Tony's figure was small, and especially now that bevause of the Serum his body had changed so much, Steve was way taller than him, but the thing with Tony was that sometimes he seemed to have such a confidence that Steve would still somehow feel tiny next to him. The scientist grinned, holding the small engine still.
-I need you back- the words came out before Tony could even process them, they hit them, both of them, and Tony felt his walls crash down. He had told himself this was going to be an objective talk, this was Ironman asking for his teammate to accept his offer to come back home. But those four words? Those four words were the man that was under the suit of armor. Those four words were his defenses falling down, those words were months of pain and anger and loneliness, they were his last shot, his last selfish try. Tony felt the corner of his eyes sting but he looked up anyway. There was no need to hide it anymore. There he was, naked of his defenses and completely vulnerable.
-I was arrogant and selfish and stupid and people died because of me and I hate myself—I hate myself so much Steve– Tony was sobbing by this point, clinging into Steve’s shirt, shivering because of that coldness that no matter what, he was never able to get rid of.
Steve's eyes automatically fell on the broken machine on the floor and Tony didn't miss to notice. The shorter boy pulled a face biting his lip, holding back a giggle and Steve blushed violently at his hesitation. Of course he trusted Tony. Well mostly of the times.
A shiver ran down his spine as a figure materialized right in front of him. It was blurry, faint, dust shaped in the form of a man, but Tony knew exactly who he was.
-What about the two poor kids?- Steve asked with a small smile and Tony's heart ached because of how he had missed that smile. He smirked, shrugging.
Both Steve and Natasha's eyes opened wide, a look of shock crossed their faces and Tony couldn't help but smile a little.
-I know you are- the blond one said in a murmur and Tony nodded, shifting his weight from one foot to another.
Steve knew that Tony was working on one of his dad's projects. The goal was to improve the flying system he had previously installed on one of his cars, so that it would have been able to levitate for at least ten minutes. However, the system had cracked down after scant ten seconds and Tony's father had decided to keep the project aside for a while.
, every single one of us, for different reasons. We let arrogance and pride prevail, we let sorrow for our losses blind us, we had to make decisions, difficult ones, maybe the most difficult we’ve ever made while we were running out of time, we had to put our trust in the hands of strangers, we had to make sacrifices we weren’t supposed to make and all of this… all of this broke us. Look at me.
Tony nodded but remained quiet, still not looking at Steve in the eyes. Steve pulled him closer, letting his head rest on his chest as his free hand started stroking Tony’s hair in a reassuring and shooting way.
-Tony…-Steve breathed out, pulling Tony’s body closer but the other one didn’t react, he was just laying there like a puppet, a broken, useless puppet. That’s how he felt, at least.
-I can't take it anymore. I see all of you like this and... and I hate it. I hate what happened and I hate the fact that it was mostly my fault—
The shorter boy didn't finish his sentence that the engine started to shake violently, overreacting.
-But that’s up to you to decide- Steve told him –He made his choice. You can decide if it was the wrong one or the right one.
-As if you couldn't afford to buy the whole company- Wanda murmured, making Peter giggle as he opened the back door.
Tony exploded in a fight of laughter, hiding his face in Steve's chest. The other one smiled even though his heart was still beating faster than ever before. He let his hand run up Tony's back till his fingers were playing with the boy's brown curls and he stayed still, feeling Tony small and hot breaths on his skin, feeling his fingers slip between his, feeling the boy's body relax on his and right there, as he held Tony tightly to his chest, Steve couldn't have been happier.
-There he goes- Tony rolled his eyes, turning to face a clumsy —and way too excited for his own good— Peter Parker running down the stairs of the Facility, backpack in one hand and a white paper bag in the other.
Steve's heart missed a beat as another loud explosion echoed in the room. He instinctively pulled Tony's body closer, crushing on the floor with the smaller boy between his legs, arms wrapped protectively around him.
Tony shook his head, hugging the man tighter and Steve laughed, running a hand through Tony's brown curls.
-I was going to tell you this is all for the team- he said with a small, tired smile -I was going to ask you to come back because we need to stay together because what happened is unfair and stupid because you are the leader of the Avengers. But you know what, Cap? You were right, I am selfish. I miss you. Not Captain America, though, I miss Steve Rogers. It's Steve Rogers that I'm taking back, no matter how much I lie to myself.
He screamed. He screamed at the top of his lungs trying to get rid of all the air that was keeping him alive, trying to escape that torture, he screamed out in pain, in fear, in anger.
-C'mere- Tony said firmly. Steve felt his stomach knot and, honestly, he panicked for a short second. He knew Tony wouldn't hurt him. And he shouldn't even be scared of being hit, not after the effects of the serum. Yet, something about Tony's glare was making him nervous.
They stopped by a car station along the road some hours later to get something to eat and an extra coffee for Tony, they used the bathroom and got a nice fifteen minutes break from their car trip. Tony sat at the table outside the car station with Peter and Wanda sitting right in front of him and for once, as he looked up at the two, they looked like two normal teenagers enjoying their sandwiches as they talked about the most random things. Tony wasn't even listening. He was observing, picturing how his life could be like. How their life could be like. They weren't wearing any suit, any armor, they didn't have any villain to fight or any battle to face, right now, it was just a man with two teenagers enjoying a break from their car trip. And Tony liked that, but of course, he decided to keep that thought to himself.
-Tony- Steve breathed, his voice was soft but firm and Tony took a deep breath, trying to calm down –I know it’s hard but you have to stop this.
Tony sighed. “What do you need a run down of their location? Some things never change.” Steve felt uneasy at the smile that Ross was now wearing. “Except this time, you can actually tell me where they are.” Tony didn’t rise to the bait though, and responded, “Well that’s because this time, they’ve signed legal documents of their own free will, that afford you that luxury. Lucky you.”
Yes, okay, I know that some of you are going to HATE how this went with Wanda. Let me explain a little bit to you, cause I didn't know I was going to write it this way until it happened.
"I would encourage you to speak to Steve again. You made a choice and you followed your Captain. That responsibility falls on your shoulders. Clarification should have been asked for by you before you made any choices."
call them my friends." He hissed with as much venom as he could possibly put into his voice. "Don't you ever saying anything like that in my fucking presence again."
Vision lent a supportive arm to Scott, who still looked sick, and helped him follow Natasha and Clint out of the lab.
Any remaining tension left them as they chuckled at her impression before she opened her blanket and used her grip on Tony's hand to pull him on to the couch beside her. He wrapped his arm around her shoulders and instinctively pulled her to his chest before wrapping them both back up in her cocoon of blankets. She laid her head on his chest and he rested his chin on top of her head as they watched the rain continue to pour outside. It was…surreal, to say the least. He had half expected her to kick his ass.
They called Wong and once he stepped through the portal they all gathered together on the landing terrace, not that it really mattered where the ship landed at this point. In the distance, Steve could make out the spaceship coming towards them. It touched down on the landing pad with little difficulty and they all stood in silent apprehension as the ramp began to open and a strange blue robot woman walked out.
Natasha turned her face upwards towards him and planted a small kiss on his jaw. He drew back, surprised. She only gave him a sad smile and said, "Things have been difficult for us lately. We are left here in this broken empty home and neither of us are very good at showing emotions. But Tony, I have
Tony’s moans could be heard and Shuri was taping away at the tablet to see what injuries he had sustained. Steve was clutching the back of the couch, white knuckled as he waited. Sam was covering his mouth with both hands, while Wanda and Clint gripped each others hand tightly.
"Nothing can be done Wanda, it's too late. We are here, in Wakanda and everything else is miles and years away. I have to deal with the here and now."
He knelt down by the chair Tony was sitting on and called his name softly. “Tony?” The man turned his tired eyes on Steve. For a split second, Steve thought about insisting that Tony get some rest, but he remembered the scene James had insisted he witness in the kitchen with Tony and T’Challa. ‘
The shattering of one of the floor’s large glass window panes behind them all stopped the guards in their tracks, everyone flinching and trying to shield themselves from the shards flying in all directions. The sound of the Iron Man repulsors was music to his ears. From his position on the floor on his knees he heard the heavy metal footsteps of the suit land behind him and walk forward until they were standing next to him.
Steve’s face pinches and he visibly swallows. He doesn’t want to hear how his friend disappeared and likely died. And he did consider Tony his friend, even after everything, he still loved Tony like family. His disappearance and subsequent death had already been weighing heavily on him. He was able to keep his focus off of it due to fear, adrenaline, and a greater threat looming. Since having a few moments to mourn though, more than one of those stolen moments of tears had been dedicated to the memory of the genius. The words they’d never been able to say, the moments they missed and never had, the apologies he thought they’d eventually get to but that were now all too late.
"Wow." Sam said once the door closed softly. "Should I tell Stark that you're love sick and heartbroken too? Maybe he'd give you a hug like that."
He saw Happy's smile in the rear view mirror as he responded, "I'd get some sleep if I were you, Sir, you might only have about 30 minutes left to live."
The room erupted in congratulations and cheers for Peter, who’s face was red as a tomato by that point. Bruce, leaning on the back of the couch asked, “What was the topic, Pete?”
James stuck his tongue out and licked Steve’s palm, who immediately withdrew it and made a sound in disgust, wiping it off on James’ shirt. James smiled triumphantly and said, “You can stay here and we can talk about you bending Tony over, or you can go back and actually talk to the man and figure your shit out.” He threatened. Steve shook his head and looked away again.
The smile fell from Tony’s face at his words and was replaced with something more real. “Steve-” He started.
Steve didn’t have a good reason to say no, there wasn’t anything important on the agenda today, he didn’t see any excuses. They all stood up after finishing breakfast, agreeing to meet back together in the garage in an hour.
"Is that all you did, Cap?" Clint looked up at him from the couch where he had sat down. "Cause Stark is mad as hell."
James turned a positively gleeful look on Steve as he told him that he and Natasha were going to go hang it on the Lab door. Steve shook his head as he watched them take off with Sam in tow. Children. He was absolutely surrounded by children.
yourself? I thought that you were going to release the information anonymously, like the video of your parents and the information on Barnes and the team?”
A low sound brought Steve’s attention to T’Challa, who was glaring daggers at the television. “That man is nothing but a coward, they will find him responsible.” Steve nodded and Tony made a non-comitial sound but said nothing more. It was James who spoke up, saying, “Tony, we need to be careful. Ross is still dangerous until the Counsel reaches a verdict and you just painted a big target on your back.” Tony turned and gave James a lopsided grin answering, “I’m a big boy, Snowball, I’ve been taking care of myself for a long time.”
Inwardly, T'Challa shook his head at his own stupidity. Of course, the only way for the Barton and Lang family could have disappeared off the face of the Earth would be if Tony Stark had wanted them to.
Tony swallowed thickly before saying, “I appreciate that.” He kept his eyes steadfastly focused on the door, but he felt and T’Challa turn towards him. “You may not believe my words, Mr. Stark, but I would like you to know you have a friend in me, should you wish. I know what I saw in that miserable place. I also know what I did not see. Though I saw the deepest kind of betrayal, I did not see a man hell bent on killing another in retribution. I have seen the capabilities of your suit, I know you did not use it to it’s full potential.”
Around 10:00 pm the elevator doors had slid open and the sound of voices flooded the quiet Penthouse.
Immediately, Tony was all bright smiles as he walked right up to T’Challa and embraced him tightly as if they had been friends for years, T’Challa returning the embrace just as enthusiastically. That was…odd. When had they been close? Even during the fight at the airport and in Siberia, they had fought together but hadn’t seemed close. Not that Steve had been paying attention to much else than Bucky and his mission. The video calls he had witnessed were cordial, even friendly, but nothing that had given the impression they were at this level of familiar or tender. Watching now though, as Tony and T’Challa barely let each other go enough to pull back and gaze into each others eyes, muttering quiet hellos, he felt cheated somehow. He thought that the King had respect for Tony, but this was quite a bit more than that.
Steve again looked at James, still slightly confused. James rolled his eyes and started to drag Steve to his room, closing the door. Once inside, James turned around and crossed his arms over his chest training his eyes on Steve who was sitting on the bed. “Did you see how T’Challa did that? He didn’t tell Tony that he was going to take it away, like Tony was a bad kid who got caught with the cookie jar. He gave Tony an option, Steve. He didn’t come in, guns blazing, and tell Tony how he was going to live his life. You gotta stop doing that if you ever want things to work, dummy.”
Passing a shelf full of electronics, Tony grabbed a pair of wireless headphones and tossed them into the cart as well.
"Please," She held up her hand, "don't. I'm too tired for this." She began to walk past them down the hallway to the bedrooms until she came to a stop in front of Clint.
"Okay, Nat, listen, I know I didn't talk to you about it first, but I promise I am not as stupid as you think I am right now. It was part of a plan, I swear."
Tony looked up into her eyes as the tears fell down her cheeks at the use of the nickname he had given her when they had moved into the Compound with him. Shakily, she sat back down and leaned into the Maggie's embrace.
“Blush is a good color on you, Steven.” He couldn’t help the full body shiver at the use of his full name tumbling from Tony’s sinful lips.
Tony couldn't help snapping. Hearing St-Rogers speak like Tony owed him anything was too much. "The whole story? I don't think so. You don't pick and choose when you get to know the whole story."
“Alrighty then. Well I am going to do a few things down in the lab until then, I’ve got a lot of things for Shuri and I to look at together. See you all in a few hours.” He called as he walked to the elevator. His eyes connected with Steve’s for a moment as the doors closed and Steve wished more than anything he could follow him. Wisely, he stayed put on the couch and watched him go.
He was nervous, sitting here with the others, in the furthest chairs in the darkest corner. The room was full of important business men and woman from various companies. To be completely honest, Steve had no idea what they were all here for – some kind of deal that was to be put on the table and the company that could meet the demands set by Stark Industries would end up as the partner in the endeavor. Natasha had said it was a brilliant business strategy; Pepper and Tony were making the other companies sell to them, putting them in the higher position of power.
Steve left to pack his own bags, leaving Wanda and Clint to make their own decisions. He had influenced them once; he wouldn't be doing it again.
She made it there in record time anyways, pulling into the underground garage and into her parking spot. After getting out of the car she simply stood in the space, feeling angry at everything she could think of. The world, the UN, Tony, Steve, everything was an absolute mess. She hated it and she hated feeling so powerless to do anything about it.
After the others came back he would happily surrender his place on the team, moving his act strictly back to a support role. He would build and design tech for the team, try and keep Peter, Nat, Vision, James, and Rhodey safe. That was enough for him.
Suddenly a thought occurred to Steve. It probably wouldn’t work, there was no reason it should work, but what options did he have? He called out to FRIDAY desperately.
Slowly making their way down the ramp, Steve felt his heart and mind seize when he recognized the obviously injured figure she was supporting down the ramp.
There was shuffling in the kitchen before there was sniffing and sounds of comforting and soothing whispers as Laura cried in Tony's arms.
T’Challa gave a small smile before continuing, “I know that you have concerns about the Accords. I do as well. I would propose that you and I review them together, whenever time can be made for such things. I know us both to be quite busy men, but I believe that we are both aware of the issues that lie within the Accords we signed our names to. Signing them as they were proved to be a necessary evil in the moments of destruction we were facing, however now that the moment has passed, it is time to re-asses and amend them so that they may serve as they were intended, as
“In case it escaped your perfect vision Cap, I’m right here.” Tony sounded tired as he continued to climb the stairs. Without thinking Steve said, “My perfect vision can definitely appreciate the view right now, Tony. But you almost weren’t okay, you scared Peter pretty bad that day. The rest of us too. If you and I are going to lead the team together, even for only 10 missions, we need to be ready.”
He turned to the room and, still holding Shuri’s hand he presented her to the room. “For anyone who doesn’t know, this is Princess Shuri of Wakanda, Tech Queen Extraordinaire and light of my fuc-freaking- sorry Laura, life.”
“Yeah baby, it looks worse than it is.” Clint called back to her. Cooper said nothing, but watched his father with mild concern.
He could take a hint. T'Challa was allowing him to view the call, but telling him to stay out of sight of the camera.
Steve stood rooted to the spot in the doorway where Tony had left him. Slowly he made his way to the bed in the middle of the room and sunk down on it, staring at the wall and letting Tony’s words sink in. First, the fact that Tony had even spoken to him was incredible. Second, they hadn’t yelled or thrown any punches, never mind that Steve hadn’t said a word and Tony had been holding a baby at the time, it was still massive progress for them.
"These, were my mother's. She loved them dearly and only took them out for the most special of occasions. I've never known anyone else who could wear them and honor her in the way they deserve, until you." Hot tears gathered in her eyes at his words.
One of the men at the table began to argue with something that Pepper had said. Pepper’s eyes were alight with an unspoken challenge as she regarded the man with an air of someone who had just stepped on something unsavory in expensive shoes. Tony’s quick wit shut down the argument efficiently and spoke volumes to the rest of the table that any further arguments would be dealt with swiftly in the same manner. No one was foolish enough to make the same mistake. The meeting came to a close and Pepper excused them all from the room to go over the details and put together proposals for she and Tony to look at later. As the occupants filed out of the room she and Tony hovered over the files and spoke together in low tones.
The team had taken the QuinJet, which Tony had made several modifications to, and arrived on the scene in Chicago in less than 20 minutes.
Nebula tore her gaze away and locked on Thor instead. “The Sorcerer offered the Time Stone in exchange for Stark’s life.”
T'Challa smiled before standing and offering Sam his hand. Sam returned his smile and clasped his hand, allowing himself to be pulled to his feet.
“Why do I care if you believe it?” She shot back as she spooned into more of her banana yogurt finally taking her knowing eyes off of Steve as he tried to breathe again.
He had spoken to Sam who filled him in on what had happened with Steve while watching the Gala. T'Challa wished more than anything he could tell Sam that it wasn't what it seemed. He nearly blurted it out to Steve when he saw just how broken he had looked. It was killing him, but Tony had been clear on his expectations, no one would know. So, he bit his tongue when a negative word about Stark was spoken or Steve looked especially puppy-like.
He didn't let his smile fall from his face at her words. He knew. He had been preparing for this discussion with Pepper. It was going to be the first real look the public would have at him at a high profile event, which he was even hosting. They would be out for blood, looking for any signs of weakness from Iron Man, and he would be nearly defenseless. Rhodey, although walking quite will with the technology Tony had fit his legs with, was still in Physical Therapy and on ordered rest. Tony wouldn't make him come and deal with these people asking him intrusive questions and staring at his legs. No, Tony would do this without his Rhodey-Bear this time.
Sam now had a real smile on his face as he remembered how things had been before they were brought to this point.
Steve shot him his best ‘disappointed in you’ look he could muster, though if anything, it made the King seem even more proud of himself as he sauntered past him.
He stepped around Steve and said, “This team needs a leader who trusts the ones he leads. That won’t be me, we both know it. So it needs to be you. Use your teammates. Use your
“Ugh. I cannot believe I just gave you a heartfelt chick moment, and you are comparing me to Scott Lang.”
Sam shook his head. "Steve, I didn't follow you because I thought Tony wasn't a good man. I followed you because I wanted to, the end. I need to take the responsibility that I was trying to avoid, I think we all do. We followed you, no matter what reasons we had, we did it. And now we are here and that's just life. Now, I don't know how we move forward, but I know that we can't sit here forever. I think that things will change, maybe that change is something we shape, maybe it's something we wait for, I don't know, man. I know that you and Tony, you have some seriously messed up shit between you, but that doesn't mean it has to stay that way. I'm guessing that the dinosaur phone you hold on to has a twin?"
Steve’s heart contracts at the sight. He would give anything to have those chocolate brown eyes stare up at him every single morning for the rest of his life.
Sure enough, FRIDAY alerted him one morning in his workshop that Ross was at the Gate, demanding immediate entry. Lifting his head from the project he was working on he sighed and told FRIDAY to lock down the upper levels that housed the Barton and Lang family before giving her permission to let him in.
“I was never enough for him.” She whispered. “All I ever wanted was for him to be proud of me, just once.”
She replied, her tone distressed. “Good girl.” Tony answered. Wanda cried out for Tony from where she stood behind Vision and James. Vision hushed her and tried to soothe her. Peter tried to push past Rhodey, who pulled him back and held on to him. “What the actual fuck is happening?” Clint yelled. Tony raised his voice to say “Stand down, Avengers!”
Steve couldn't help but beam at him. "Everyday, Buck, I can't tell you how happy I am that the treatment worked. How are things here, you happy?"
“Well Mr. Stark, you said you trust Captain Rogers, if that is so, would you mind sharing some of your reasons with the rest of us so that we can feel as optimistic as you do?” That reporter wouldn’t dare something like this if Tony were standing in his full suit.
Of course he hadn't. After the guilt he had heard in Steve's voice he knew the man felt conflicted enough. He had made a questionable choice in a moment with limited options. As much as Steve tried to maintain his position, it was clear that he wished it hadn't ended in the way it did. T'Challa himself was unsure how he felt about the situation. If anything it had shown him the devastating effects of not communicating with those you care for.
"I have compiled footage for you to view before your flight back to New York. It is footage of the current team in action. They have only been on a handful of smaller missions, kept very low profile, but you will be able to see the team dynamic and evaluate where each of your own skills will fall in and be the most valuable." He surveyed the individuals on the couches in front of him.
Steve and the others gathered around the table started at the warmth in FRIDAY's voice as she greeted Bucky.
Suspiciously, he approached the camera that he noticed had turned to zero in on him, the camera lens adjusting to zoom in.
“I honestly have no idea, but if anyone was going to do it, it would be him, wouldn’t it?” Tony shrugged. They laughed as they stepped into the Penthouse.
Tony didn’t answer, but the beeping on the machine changed again and a few moments later the door opened and a nurse rushed in and called for another nurse and the doctor on shift. At their urging Steve moved out of their way but was loathe to let go of Tony’s hand. The tears were falling freely as he asked one of the nurses what was going on. She only assured him that it was nothing bad and that they needed room to work, asking him to step outside. Steve pulled out his phone and dialed Rhodes immediately, informing him of the change without looking at the clock. After Rhodey assured him he would be there soon and he would call the others Steve hung up and looked at the time, 2:28 am. He paced nervously for a few minutes before the nurses and doctor came out and told him that Tony was awake, though only just, and he could go back in if he promised to relax and not excite the patient. Steve nodded and promised in earnest before slipping through the door. He crossed the floor quickly before hesitating at the bedside. Tony’s eyes were closed and Steve was unsure if he had fallen back asleep until Tony reached out his hand to where Steve was standing and hooked his index finger with Steve’s.
Steve had been beyond embarrassed, but didn't even bother trying to deny it. Bucky had given him a small smirk and a head shake.
She was absolutely loath to admit it, but she was in no condition to fight. Physically and even emotionally, she was unsteady, Titan had taken its toll on her as well as her companion back on the ship. She shouldn’t have risked leaving the ship at all. ‘
Peter's laugh burst from his mouth before he could contain it. "Mr. Stark put Secretary Ross on hold while he played interference. You never would have made it within 50 miles of that place without him."
“I didn’t say he came home to you, darling. I said he has someone to call home.” The tears in Steve’s eyes fell onto the sheets on the bed. “I…I don’t think-” He choked out as the tears blurred his vision. “Would you call him your home?” She asked. Steve stifled a sob with one hand over his mouth at that and with his other he let his shaking fingers ghost over the back of Tony’s hand.
“A little bit of fight in this one. They’ll have to break her, but she should fetch a pretty price.”
Tony chuckled a little at that. He had always liked Wilson and they had gotten along well before everything had gone to hell in a handbasket. His message to Tony and Rhodey from Wakanda had been kind and had meant a lot to them both, even though Tony knew Rhodey never blamed Sam for what had happened to him. He wondered if they had spoken at all. Tony was sure Rhodey would have mentioned it. Then again, Rhodey was busy and wasn’t around as much. When he was, he spent most of his time with Tony, who definitely didn’t try to spend his time with any of the Compound’s occupants who weren’t allowed in the Penthouse.
A few moments later Tony was regaining his senses and realizing what had happened. Shaking, he stood up and glared at everyone around him.
"Tony, dinner is ready upstairs, if you feel up to it." Maggie placed a light hand on Tony's unhurt hand. He squeezed her delicate hand in thanks and gave her a nod. "Be up in a minute."
Steve felt like his smile was too big for his face as he put an arm around Bucky and they shared a smile. Sam gave him an overly hardy thumping pat on the back which Bucky answered with a side eye.
“Peter?” Natasha pressed him. Tony smiled as he handed her the paper in his hands and put an arm around Peters shoulders. Natasha took the paper and read out, “The Effects of a Father: Bonds Deeper Than Blood”.
He didn’t remember seeing anything about Tony signing his life as collateral for Steve’s possible future actions when he read the new Accords. If there had been anything about that he’s sure he would have seen it. Pacing the length of his room he thought about asking FRIDAY if he could get a copy of his signed Accords, but then decided that instead, she could just tell him, so he decided to ask her, “FRIDAY, the piece of the Accords that Tony quoted today, is that really in my contract?
Steve thought he might just die. Not only did he have a conversation with Tony in private, and it had gone well, but they had even engaged in some of the once familiar banter that they used to. He turned to go back down the stairs to the gym, smiling the whole way.
"I spent my entire life thinking that man took away one of the only people who ever gave a damn about me. He got behind the wheel, plastered drunk and he
Very few of the individuals in the room understood the meaning behind what Tony had said, but from the reaction of those who did, Steve knew he needed to be worried. Natasha and James drew in a sharp breath and T’Challa’s eyes were wide as he exclaimed, “Tony!”
“Clear out everyone, please. Give us a few minutes. Clint, Scott, go find your kids.” He gave Natasha and James both a nod and a small smile as he continued to hold on to Wanda.
Mostly they just talked about progress with BARF and other news. Bucky showed off his arm and told T'Challa and Steve all the different things he could do with it and showed off how it was indistinguishable from his other, real, arm.
They all suddenly burst into the kitchen and find Natasha trying to work the knots in Tony’s back out with a massage.
Clint spoke often of his family, how much he missed them, wishing he could reach out to them somehow. T'Challa had attempted to help ease his worry by looking into the whereabouts of his family in the first month they had arrived. The archer had been surprised, angry, and disappointed when he reported back that he had found nothing, not even a trace of Laura and the children. This had distressed Clint, who had begun to leave and look into it himself until the others had calmed him down and made him understand that getting himself arrested would do his family no favors. The most they could hope for now it that they had managed to get to safety. He knew that was little consolation to Clint.
Sam stood next to him in his gear, but without his wings. Clint was missing his bow and Scott was standing in plain training gear as well, since he didn't have his suit. Wanda was in her normal clothing. The others were all standing ready, Natasha and James had their guns and knives, Vision in his suit with his cape, Rhodes in his Patriot suit.
At his side, Natasha let out another noise that was half sob, half Tony’s name. Bruce had the beginnings of a tearful smile. Thor was beaming, though his eyes tracked Tony and Nebula’s movement and injuries with concern. Rhodes had actually buckled at the sight of his best friend and Wong had moved swiftly to catch him. “Tony!” He called desperately as Tony and Nebula reached the end of the ramp.
"Oh really?" Tony responded, rubbing his eyes "Good to know. In fact, I have a few projects that could benefit from a second set of eyes."
As he came closer he gave her a soft smile, this time leaning in and kissing her cheek before telling her, "Truly Nat, you look lovely." She ducked her head in a silent thank you. "However, I think you may just be missing something." Her nose crinkled in confusion before Tony pulled out a small box from his pants pocket.
Yes, it was a victory in a certain sense, the Rogue Avengers would be coming home, just what they had worked for months to achieve. So he should be feeling… what? He didn't know.
This chapter is a little bit shorter, but I'll make up for it in the next chapters. Coming soon, some Bucky and Tony friendship!
He stood there barefoot, his hair mussed from sleep, shirtless, sweat pants riding dangerously low on his tanned hips. Steve felt his mouth go dry at the sight, until his eyes wandered to the Arc Reactor in the middle of his chest. The Arc Reactor itself was fine, but his eyes were drawn to the angry red scar that formed an upside down half crescent. The realization of what made that mark hit him squarely in the gut, nearly knocking the air right out of him.
Cooper, Lila, and Cassie quickly approached Tony. The two girls had tears flowing down their cheeks seeing the bruising and blood on his face. Cooper's face was scrunched up, the poor boy trying to hold back any tears and appear strong.
He and James were having a good time though, the banter back and forth was amusing for everyone to watch. Steve tried to focus on the fight, but was having a difficult time. Tony was wearing a black tank top and grey jogger warm ups that hung on his hips in what Steve could only describe as sinfully distracting. His ass looked absolutely amazing.
"No Stark, enough! You are out of control and it stops now. You clearly don't know to control yourself like you should and I am done playing babysitter. In the past month in the field you and your team have continuously pushed boundaries, making stupid mistakes and forcing me to cover your ass. Do you have any idea how much the UN has been fucking around with the Accords because of the shit you and your left over Avengers have caused?"
And yet, T’Challa had not told the panel about the video, the words Tony had shared with Ste- his former teammate-, or the condition Tony had been left in.
Tony’s hand stopped the door closing as he leaned out once more and fixed T’Challa with a pointed look. “Try to enjoy yourself up here for a while huh? Don’t look so sad, I still love you, I just can’t resist the mind of your brilliant sister. I’ve got a lab full of things that need her attention, the first one being my notebook full of questions.” He winked at the King as the doors closed for the last time.
One day Tony beckoned to him to follow him out into the Lab where he had made him sit on Tony's stool before replacing the metal arm that Tony had fit him with at first, with the brand new one. The first arm was well made, but Tony had always insisted that it was temporary until he finished the new one they had designed that day at his table. Bucky had tried to tell him that it was enough but Tony wouldn't hear it.
“Not Stark tech?” Sam said in a mocking incredulous tone. Tony looked sick at the idea, but only said, “Wanda.” And kept walking. James offered, “Vision mentioned that Wanda’s headphones broke and she was unhappy about it. Vision offered to ask Tony for some but she didn’t like the idea of using something Tony gave her.”
“Look at me.” Tony whispered. Steve shook his head again before burying it into Tony’s warm chest and letting out a choked sob when he felt Tony raise his other hand and run his fingers through Steve’s hair. “Look at me, Steve, I gotta see those baby blues.” He whispered again.
“Alright, I’m going to see if I can find my wallet. It’s gotta be here somewhere. Meet me back here in 5.”
"Don't you dare, Clint. Not right now." She shook her head and hid the tears that began welling up in her eyes.
Tony sighed, "No, no, I think it's alright. Uh for the last few months the Compound has been home to Clint Barton and Scott Lang's families. Clint's wife, Laura, and their kids; Cooper, Lila, and Nathaniel. Scott's ex-wife Maggie and his daughter Cassie."
Tony dragged them back into the guest room/command post with the others. Peter and Scott both eyed where their hands were joined but Tony silenced them both with one look. Bruce tried to hide a smile behind his hand. Suddenly, Steve’s brain kicked on again as he realized what Tony had said earlier. “What prank is this?”
Tony’s mouth snapped shut at that, and Steve’s heart nearly burst with happiness at the familiar fire he saw blazing in Tony’s eyes. It wasn’t anger, or pain, it was
Tony and Bruce spend a lot of their time in the workshop, falling into natural step around each other while Natasha watches with a smile, calling them adorable Science Bros.
As he watched Bucky steal some of Clint's grapes, he couldn't find it in himself to be sorry that he held gone against the Accords or gone against the government in order to keep him safe. Bucky was his best friend, and he had owed him his life. Seeing his friend back, playfully chatting with his teammates, sporting the smile he never thought he'd see again, it made him happy. He couldn't regret it. His regret was that seeing Bucky's happiness should never have come at the cost of the trust and possibly forever, the love of Tony Stark.
Tony opened both his eyes now, lifting his head from the headboard and giving James a scandalized look.
“I’ve been givin’ you both a lot of space to work this shit out yourselves, but a guy could get old waitin’ for that.”
Tony cracked open one eye to look at him. “You two both have your heads so far up your asses that one of you is going to have to just crack and make this real. I thought it was Steve the day you woke up, but then he turned chicken. So, I thought we were finally going to get an end to this misery when you woke up and showered him with that adorable shit about his eyes.”
They all greeted Natasha and Bruce as they stepped off the elevator. Nat laughed at him, his mouth hanging open at the sight. "Doing alright there, Dr. Banner?"
"You aren't babysitting, you are watching each other's backs, Patriot, and you both let your team member down." Natasha opened her mouth for a rebuttal but Tony moved on to Wanda herself.
Steve had only eventually been silenced by Bucky telling all of them, in no uncertain terms, that he was willing to do whatever it took to get Hydra out of his head. If that meant bunking with Tony Stark, he was willing to do it.
Tony smiled at her and said, “Don’t worry about her, Steve, she’s just heartbroken I’m leaving again. We’re doomed to love each other from afar, Dianne. You’ll always be the one that got away.” He held his hand out to her and gave her a careful hug and a kiss on the cheek. She gave him a mock swoon and then batted him away. “Go on, get out of here. And you make sure he stays out for a while, do you hear me Steve?” Steve gave her a two finger salute and a “Yes Ma’am.”, his hand shooting out to grab Tony’s arm in support and he stood to walk.
After paying, they loaded up the groceries back into their cart and made their way out to the car, loading the groceries into the trunk and back seat next to James. Tony was about to get into the driver’s seat when he stopped and tilted his head at Sam, considering. Sam froze and said, “What? Do I have something on my face?” Tony only tilted his head a little more before he threw the keys at Sam, who caught them easily.
"I was 11... It was Monday evening they were out the whole day something for work I'd gone to school and return. It was late they hadn't come back. I decided to go to bed. As I was ready to fall asleep the phone rang. It was an accident. A drunk driver. My father tried to avoid him and they hit a tree. There was nothing left the car was completely burned. There were no survivors. "
He glances at the caller ID. Bucky... Of course he'll call the most inconvenient moment. He answers anyway.
He follows Bucky to the top floor I front of a plain door which he opens without bothering to knock.
Steve doesn't know what to say he tries to imagine Tony as a small child tucked in his bed cuddling his parents. He feels his eyes fill with tears.
These weeks I can't stop thinking. I don't want to die anymore. From the moment he came into my life I just want to be with him and make him happy.
At the end he wasn't someone who tried and succeeded like his father. He wasn't even someone who tried and failed. He was just lucky.
"Here is what we'll do I ask a question you ask a question and soon I'll have the information I need to come up with the best nickname for you! "
As soon as Steve landed in 1987 he had one thing on his mind. Find Tony. To his knowledge that summer the genius had just graduated from MIT and was spending some time at his parents house in Manhattan.
"Come on punk it's been like two weeks since that lunch date and you've done nothing but glare at this wall! Go find him! Do something!"
Something in her eyes makes him believe that she isn't joking so he nods and answers sincere " I have no intention to do anything to hurt him. If I end up hurting him though I'll be the first to kill myself "
"Hey hey hey! What are you talking about? You're not going back there not as long as I am here. Please baby just come live with me! You won't even need your job in the cafe. You'll finally focus on your lessons. Please I can give everything you need! "
So when he received the call of his mother asking him to go back because his father got ill and he was close to the end Steve didn't care to hurry up. He never got to see his father again. He didn't feel sad or empty or something like that. He felt like nothing changed. He was 16.
It's been a week since the incident and Tony's spent it considering his options and if he really should move in with Steve. At this point he's sure he's in love with the older man but he can't help thinking the what if's. What if they break up? He'll end up homeless again. What if Steve isn't showing his true colors? Maybe he's an ass, they don't know each other for that long.
"Well If you want to use the bathroom be my guest. Sorry but there's nothing you can do to kill your time I have no Wi-Fi. I was planning on doing some Math but of you want I can keep you company. "Tony says. "Huh sure. So how do you spend your free time? " "That's an easy one. I don't have any. In the mornings I work at a workshop after at the cafe and when I'm home I study. " " Oh man that's a lot!"he sips from his glass and then adds quietly "You don't have to talk to me you know. You can study" "Okay".
I'm kinda disappointed with this so please comment what you think and thank you for the kudos they help me keep writing.
"My car broke down" Steve simply answers but it's obvious there's something else and the blond knows the brunet isn't gonna let it pass.
He walks out of the bathroom and calls in both of his jobs to let them know he's not going. He spends the day in his bed trying to keep in whatever still remains in his stomach.
"Omg you're Tony?! I'm Bucky! Wow I can't believe I finally meet you! Of course let me take you to Steve! "
Their first kiss had ended up in a make out session but they hadn't done anything more. They'd just hold each other till they fell asleep.
The apartment is basically a room with a bed that is used as a couch as well a nightstand/ table in a corner and an old chair a little farther. Next to the door there's a small fridge. There's no an oven instead there's a microwave on the counter. He doesn't see a wardrobe anywhere so he supposes that Tony puts his clothes in the kitchen's cupboards.
"In the streets yeah... " Tony interrupted. " I had no place to go I just didn't want to stay there for even a minute more. I sent a message to Rhodey as soon as I could I didn't know if he received it not till I was able to rent this place. Now we are in contact. "
The time passed quickly and before he knew it it was his 16th birthday. He had got used to the abuse and even though he was very thin he was quite muscular from the heavy work.
After that for a while he felt nothing. Everything was a buzzing noise. No one could take him out of the numbness inside his head.
"Oh hey Tony I didn't know you work here as well. My car broke down just across the street can you look at it or you just keep the store and I have to wait...? "
I decided to make an attempt to write a multi-chapter story. So this is just the introduction in Tony's life. I'll try to make an update schedule. This is also on Wattpad. English isn't my native language.
He raises his eyebrow and answers in the same tone "Well excuse me sir but as you can probably see if you look somewhere further than your nose I'm alone in the shop right now and there're people that came before you so if you can't wait a little and you think the service is that horrible you can always go somewhere else preferably to hell. " The man's eyes go wide and his mouth hangs open speechless.
Tony's sitting lazily on the workshop's counter. He's finished everything he had left undone last noon so he could make it to the cafe on time and he's waiting for any costumer to walk in.
Tony is not surprised at all by his rudeness. It's obviously not the first time someone's being rude to him -life in the streets can be tough- but he can't accept it. He's annoyed when people who consider themselves better because they're just luckier don't give a fuck for the others so he doesn't let it pass.
We sit there in an awkward silence. I am not afraid of him I just don't want him to ask me about what I was ready to do. But I know he will and I wait...
He looks around him but he can't see Tony anywhere. His eye catches a note on the table. He picks it up and reads.
"Well let me tell you my story and then I'll answer any questions you may have. Just please don't interrupt me before I finish. You don't know how overwhelming it is seeing you"
"Anyway... So... I know that I can't just ask you to be with me they way you were in the future... But can I maybe try to win you again now? " he finally got the courage to ask and he really couldn't be more grateful for the response he received from a soft looking Tony...
A bit later when Steve makes his appearance at the living room and  witnesses the younger boy clinging to an older man dressed in a military uniform he knows he was right from the beginning when he thought that this would be a better present than anything he could ever buy with money. This and the letter in his pocket reading :
After about a year he managed to make enough money to rent a really small studio apartment. His housekeeper is very understanding and never push him to pay at time he always says whenever Tony can. The man also bought him a laptop and helped him sign up for online courses so he can go to college. Tony owes everything he has to this guy.
With that Tony storms out of the cafe running to his place. He puts on his best clothes, a yellow t-shirt and jeans, and waits for Steve to come.
They climb in the car Tony fixed moments ago and Steve turns on the engine. The drive there it's in a comfortable silence both of them deep in their own thoughts. In ten minutes the blond stops the car out of a cute restaurant with flowers on every table. It looks expensive.
Tony talks for the first time as he opens the front door of his apartment. " Well this is it please don't freak out I know it's probably smaller than your bathroom. Try to make yourself comfortable while I take shower. If you need some water or anything there's in the fridge. Sorry I would offer you something else but I believe that you won't like tomato soup in a can so yeah... " With that he leaves Steve alone.
My day goes really slow. My last appointment with Howard Stark for my father's company has finally ended and Howard walks me out. It went well we made a deal.
Sometime later they're both laying on the king size bed under the bedsheets in each other's arms both naked and happy. Steve stares down at Tony's head rested on his chest and he's overwhelmed with a soft feeling when he realizes that the teen's fallen asleep. He sighs quietly and closes his eyes too.
"Don't look at me man I've no idea what she's thinking... Maybe it's because of the hot blondy that was talking to you..." Clint starts and then at Tony's look he adds "Huh! You're redder than a tomato! Who's he? He looked kinda familiar. "
"What do you want? " I ask turning to face them. I see Justin, this guy really hates me I don't know why I haven't ever bothered him.
"Hmm Natasha and Clint are the only ones who I know here and we are close. Clint is the other guy who works in the cafe. They are very important to me. "
As Bucky complies with a groan Steve beckons Tony to come closer. He walks to man he's pretty sure he loves and gets in his arms.
The first hit came unexpectedly and he let out a whimper. The beating continued for a while and by the end his back was red and sore and bleeding. He was left there alone again trying to put himself together. That's how he came out of the numbness...
Ms Smith had found him there trying to save whatever he could. She had ordered him to lock the door and then take off his shirt and turn looking at the wall.
Four hours pass and it's finally time to close the place and head home. Oh god he's exhausted. He cleans everything grabs his extremely warn out and out of season jacket and gets out.
With this done he leaves the penthouse and runs all the way to work. He's there in record time just 20 minutes later and he gets to work immediately.
That's how they found themselves all together in Steve's -and now Tony's too- living room messing around and Tony thinks he's never been happier...
They reached a comfortable room with an elegant desk in the middle and two big armchairs. Howard took a sit behind the desk pointing at one of the chairs for Steve.
"Good because I made you breakfast in bed and I have a small present for you later! Besides everyone knows birthday sex it's the best" The blond winks.
Now it's my turn to be surprised. "Ughh I love you too so much. " I say as I let myself get lost in the kiss .I didn't even realize when he pressed his super soft lips against mine.
Arriving at the house with Howard Steve felt like his heart was going to burst out of his chest. He was going to finally see Tony again! He knew of course that it would be hard to convince the teenager to trust him but he was willing to do everything in his power to achieve it.
" Lead the way Steve" Tony comes out again holding his tool box. They get out of the shop as the blond says " So you are working here and the cafe? " " Yeah I think I mentioned the other day that I have no free time " " Yeah yes you did... Oh here we are this is the car"
It's almost afternoon and they've been in bed for the biggest part of the day when the doorbell rings.
_____________________tiny time skip( Ik y'all expected it but I can't write smut sorry)___________________________________
Some fluff. So I'm going on vacation in about 10 days and I'm not sure if I'll be able to update before then.
"Well who am I not to let you be the happiest man in the world then... " In Steve's silence Tony adds " That's a yes"and smiles softly.
"Hi! My name is Natasha remember me? We met in the cafe a while ago and this is Clint" Steve finally recalls their meeting when he was looking for Tony all this time ago.
As Steve spends more and more time with the young genius he realizes how screwed he is. He thinks of the boy all the time and whenever they're together he feels lighter. Now that he's alone in his office and reads a note Tony gave him for the first time he knows that he's falling for the boy. He's falling hard and fast.
Before the woman can answer a man approach them. He's of average height but well built and kinda scary. His brown hair is in a man ban and he has this strict look in his eyes.
They keep talking as the girl brings their food. Steve's being sweet and caring the whole time. After they finish their meal they leave the restaurant in a comfortable silence.
"Why.. " Tony's cut by Steve's lips pressed against his in a passionate kiss. He feels Steve's tongue licking his bottom lip asking for permission. He parts his lips and they fight for dominance. Steve wins and Tony lets him guide him. They only stop when they're out of breath...
Silence drops after Tony's words. It stretches the time and neither can say if it lasts a minute or an hour.
It's been almost two weeks since the incident with Steve Rogers. Tony had woken up that morning thinking that it was probably a dream until he found the note. He wasn't surprised at all but it didn't help the feeling of disappointment. He hoped that the man would be still there.
I arrive at Stark's mansion just on time for the dinner. Mr Stark and I talk a little. Tony remains silent. I want to talk to him but I know I can't in front of his father.
As Tony's preparing some customer's coffee the bell on the door rings letting him know that someone has get in the shop. He lifts his eyes and he's looking directly at the gorgeous man that just entered. The man is tall at least 6 ft and Tony takes in the way his dress shirt stretches in his muscular torso. The guy has also the most ocean eyes and soft blond hair. Across the table sits an other man who looks kinda awkward. Tony's gaze drifts again to the first man and he thinks that he has seen this face before.
Other than the laptop there's only a book. The man is ashamed of himself when he notices how clean and tidy the room is. If he didn't have a maid his penthouse would have been a total mess.
As he's ready to get in the car again and drive away he hears loud voices from the workshop and recognizes Tony's.
Not knowing what else to do he opens the fridge to take the water bottle. In there there's a big bottle and some cans like Tony said. Steve then remebers he hasn't a glass so slowly and trying not to make any noise he opens the first cupboard. There're some notebooks, pens and that kind of stuff. The next one has some clean towels. The third is full with warn out t-shirts, a pair of pants  two sweatpants as he guessed. The underwears and socks cupboard was under the one with the clothes. Finally in the last one he finds some glasses.
"I was in the workshop and his car broke down across the street so he came to ask someone to look at it and found me. "
I am sitting in his living room and thinking. Thinking about what I was ready to do. If he hadn't come I would have jump. I know I would. What I don't know is do I really want to jump? He probably didn't let me to do the worst thing I could have done.
"Hi! You must be Tony, right? Steve, Steve Rogers. A pleasure to meet you!" He couldn't believe how formal he sounded!
That's the moment Steve chooses to get in and stop them. He sees Tony face to face with an old bold man. They're apparently both angry and it seems like they just started.
It's been weeks and me and Tony text each other every day. He's told me things. My heart aches for him. He's been through a lot. At school everyone hates him and they bully him in daily basis. His dad is an asshole. He doesn't care about his son's life as long as he doesn't do something embarrassing.
It's a lazy Sunday morning and Tony wakes up to wet kisses all over his face. He wishes he could say that it's a rare occurrence but not really. Nobody believes that he doesn't like it anyway and if he's honest with himself he loves it. It's been like that ever since he moved in with Steve about three months ago.
He starts immediately and soon it's clear to everyone that Tony is more than capable. "Oh kid you've got a talent I never understood that kind of stuff. The only thing I can do with my hands is drawing" "Really? You draw? " " Yes art is my passion. " " Huh that's cool. Engineering is mine " "I can see that"
The idea for My poor genius came to me because it's exactly the type of fiction I like to read and I thought there aren't enough out there.
"Uhg I was just wanted to tell you that something fell from you pocket" Justin says holding my keys.
"So Bucky this Natasha and the idiot next to her is Clint. They're my best friends. Guys this is Bucky Barnes Steve's best friend" Tony makes the introductions.
"Hey what are you doing? " I ask. The boy turns to face me. He isn't more than eighteen. He has curly brown hair and beautiful brown eyes. It's clear he's crying.
He really should've wait to make a better plan and then quit. What is he supposed to do now? He's going to end up homeless again. His paycheck from the cafe is bearly enough for the basics. His main income was coming from Obadiah.
Tony wakes up in the same position the next morning to see that the man's gone and has only left a note on the table.
And by the car Steve meant a hot red sport  car that Tony wouldn't have money to buy in a thousand years. "Omg that's the car?! And you trust me to fix it?" " I don't see why not. " "Okay... ".
It's been awhile I'm sorry :(: Here's a crappy chapter. I obviously have no idea what are Obadiah's illegal activities and it won't go further I just wanted angst so I apologize if you wanted to focus on that.
Only when he's far enough he let's himself panic. What is he going to do now? He has to find a new job or he will end up in the streets again. How could he be so stupid?
They walk in silence for a while till Steve decides to break it " So Tony how old are you? " He asks hoping that it won't bother the younger man. The boy doesn't seem to notice his nervousness and simply answers "I'm 17" .
"Oh my god! I knew Maria was right when she said I should work less" The man mumbled under his breath and started walking away still lost.
" Well... Steve...I know you only a couple of months but you know things about me and my life that I nobody else does and I nobody will ever knows. At least I hope so."
Steve walks quietly back to his car and drives to his office. He walk in only to find his best friend Bucky sitting on his desk  his legs swaying back and forth lazily.
" I didn't know where else to go that's why I'm here in this hour. " The younger boy breaks it at the end.
"Ey Steve! You said just grab something to eat not spend your whole fortune on it! " "Don't worry Tones I pay we eat everyone is happy" "You just called me Tones?! " "Yeah... Is it a problem? I thought it was cute... " "No it's fine I was just a little surprise"
" Oh god Tony I'm sorry I didn't mean to... Wait a minute. You weren't one of those people were you? "
He reaches his destination and gets out of the car. That's when the nervousness hits him. Should he not have come this early? Tony wrote he can stop by if he wants right? Should he have brought flowers or chocolates or something? Does he smell nice?
He looks around for a pen and notices that the forbidden drawer is unlocked. Since he's alone in the workshop so out of curiosity he takes out the files.
"I wish we didn't... Anyway I'll give you two some privacy. " The man - Obie- says knowingly and goes to the office at the back of the store.
He serves his previous customer and goes to take the men's order. "Good afternoon gentlemen what can bring you? " He asks politely but apparently the blond doesn't appreciate it since he grunts and says " Ugh finally! God the service in this hole is absolutely terrible!"
"Hahaha okay punk got it" Bucky says as he comes into view. "Hey Tony! What's up man? Oh I see you have company! Stevie where's your manners won't you introduce me to the lady? "
He sits awkwardly on the chair and looks around him. Although Tony is apparently really poor there's a laptop on the table and Steve is surprised by the jealousy he feels with the thought that it's probably a gift.
He counts the hours till the end of the day when he'll be able to go meet the teen. When finally, finally, he finishes his work he runs to his car without any words and drives to the cafe.
"Okay what happened? What do you know? Why are you smiling like that? Clint! Why is she smiling like that?"
"I can't help it babe! Happy birthday! You're 18! It's your day today we're gonna do anything you want! " Steve says sounding like an excited puppy to the teen's ears.
Hope you liked it more than I did. Next chapter is Steve's life until I make a schedule I won't know when I'll update.
They take their ice creams, Tony chocolate and Steve cookies, and walk through the tents fingers intertwined both with a huge smile on their face.
Look at me finally updating! I'm so sorry it took me so long. Quarantine kills my inspiration. Anyway I hope you're all safe and well and thank you for reading!
"I... ugh... I...ehh...he..." Tony started only to be interrupted by Natasha. "Come on Clint you really didn't recognized him? "
" Well you were born on July 4th so it's obvious and I bet your favorite colors are blue red and white so you're Captain America! "
Tony pulls himself on Steve's lap moaning softly. They part and the blond leaves soft kisses all over Tony's face and neck before find his lips again .The keep kissing as the ride comes to an end.
"That's what I told him and he said he would stop or if he kept doing it he would let me know. But today I found out he didn't stop nor told me so... " He stops and takes a deep breath. "So I quit".
It's 10 o clock and there's still no costumer so he decides to study for a while. He wasn't able to pay for the Wi-Fi yet and he didn't have the chance to attend his lessons for a while.
Then Tony starts talking. "When I was a child and got sick my mother would take the day off from work and stay with me. She would cook and we would eat together and then she would sit next to my bed and sing in Italian or tell me a story. I wish I had learn Italian it was her native language. We spent the day like this and then my father would come back from work and sit with us and listen my mother talk for anything and everything and we would fall asleep cuddling like that. It was comforting. I really miss them... "
"I'll tell you what. You're going by his work place again next week and try to make things right and for God's sake you find out if he's interested. Don't worry man it will be alright."
That's the reason why he can't believe that just now he found proofs of this illegal activity. He thought that after their last argument his boss would have at least warn him.
"Your teacher informed me you skipped history today" He says angrily. I don't answer. "Why you skipped history?" He asks. When I don't answer again he push me in the wall. "Answer my fucking question" He screams.
So this was so difficult to write. Anyway the real story begins at the next chapter. I'll try to post every weekend.
While living in the streets Tony realized how important is to be able to take a warm bath and have an even cold meal a day. Fast though he found a quiet safe corner that no one knew about and make it his.
" Red or gold. You know what both. Also if you want you can keep playing but I found what I'll call you. "
I slowly take my stuff and I am ready to leave but last second I decide to let him a note. I grab a piece of paper and a pen and I write quickly. I let it on the table and go.
"What's going on here? " Another voice is heard behind him. He turned around slowly to face the man ready to argue with him too but the words died in his mouth as soon as he sees him. In front of him is standing a much older version of the one and only Howard Stark.
It's almost noon by the time Steve wakes up in an unfamiliar room. It takes a while to realize that it's Tony's apartment and a bit more to remember last night's events.
It's a small but cute place with round tables and uncomfortable old-fashioned chairs. The wallpaper on the wall has tiny flower in baby blue background. There's a counter across the door and that's where they prepare the drinks.
And he did. He explained every little detail from waking up in the 21st century to becoming part of the Avengers and all. He tried not to give away Tony's part in this. He didn't want to scare the boy. But he couldn't not mention how much they mean to each other.
Steve's father was a businessman. A good one. He started with a  small company he inherited from Steve's grandfather but he was clever enough to make it a kingdom. Of course Steve is the heir of the company— “Rogers industries”.
He runs to the door but then stops and decides to leave a note to explain as to why he didn't stay for breakfast.
As he's about to go back to sleep the corner of his eye catches the clock on the nightstand. 7:15. Shit. He throws the blanket away puts on his clothes quickly but carefully to not wake Steve. He should have been to the workshop 15 minutes ago!
After a while he realized that once again he was in an era he didn't know a thing about. Sure Tony always talked about the 80s and how many wonderful things he had lost while being a capsicle but he never got to see them by himself. He laughed softly at the thought of Tony. Really since the battle his mind had been in a never ending loop of TonyTonyTonyTony.
"I liked it too baby really. So will you go out with me? Tonight? I'll pick you up from your place after your shift end. Huh what do you say? Will you come? "
They reached the bedroom without talking but as the finally sit alone in the room the silence got suffocating and Steve knew he had to explain.
After their first date they come closer. Steve takes Tony to some fancy places and buys him small gifts but they have the best time when they do fun things Tony recommended like going for stargazing in the highest place of the city.
