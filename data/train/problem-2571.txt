He taped up a couple dotted lines to make it look like the bees were flying, and he gave a couple of them little speech bubbles that said “Buzz!”
“I had the regular radio on instead of my cassettes the other day, and I heard this song, and I had to pull over because it made me think of you. I think you’ll like it. It’s a little more mellow than the other songs. Unlike this dude, I know I’m gonna get to have all of you again one day. I just have to wait.”
Dean was quick to point out that they still had a chance at rebuttal, but unfortunately, they missed those shots too, so Charlie and Dorothy won.
He locked the door and turned on the shower. He just needed a moment to clear his head and calm his body down.
“I’m not…Dad...I’m sorry. I am so sorry. I’ll stop. I promise. I’ll be a good son. Nothing like this will ever happen again. P-please, just stop.” Dean was trying to hold back his tears, not wanting his father to see him as being any more weak than he already had.
They binge watched classic horror movies on the weekends, Cas usually hiding under the blanket during the scary parts, then insisting they keep all the lights on because the monsters won't get you if the lights are on, it’s common courtesy. They’d play Mario Kart until Cas’s mom would come yell at them to be quiet, but she had never played Rainbow Road, she didn’t understand the stakes. And Dean couldn’t explain to her the humiliation of losing to Princess Peach for the 5th time in a row, or why Cas insisted on playing as her. But they had a lot of fun together, and grew close over the course of a year.
Dean let his hand drift up into Cas’s hair, pulling him close. He loved these small, intimate moments with Cas. He loved the taste of his lips and his tongue and his breath. He could live forever in a moment like this.
“No, I want to,” Cas said, taking the bowl and lighter from Garth. Dean must’ve sensed Cas’s apprehension, because he quickly grabbed Cas’s hands and showed him the proper way to smoke it.
Dean rests his head on Cas’s chest and Cas holds him tight. There’s a hazy feeling around them, but it’s almost blissful. There’s a comfort to it that neither of them have previously known. Being so close to another person, surrounded by warm blankets, and feeling like that’s exactly where you’re supposed to be.
Dean searched Cas’s face for any sign that he might have gotten through to him, tears blurring his vision, trembling lips struggling to hold back an earthquake of sobs.
After a few shots at triggering his gag reflex, the pizza finally came back up. It was disgusting, but Dean knew this was the price he had to pay if he wanted to act like a fat ass. He had to get all of it out.
His stomach felt overly full, the nausea followed right behind. He hated himself for doing this again. He didn’t have to eat the entire pizza, but if he didn’t eat all of it now, he’d have to eat it again later, and he couldn’t handle that. He wondered which would actually be worse? Eating the whole pizza at once, or eating some of it every day.
“See. You’re not the only one who can pull off some serious rom-com bullshit.” He said, setting the phone on the table in the corner and returning his attention to the scrapbook.
Nothing ruined his day quite like the name of a ghost. To be fair, he was still the same person, but the name was dead. His parents spoke it like a necromancer’s spell in hopes of reviving a memory of someone they thought they lost, but the bones still walked, the soul still talked. All that changed was the name.
“Dude, the pancakes. I still can’t believe we finished them in time. You have to admit, I came in clutch there at the end.” He laughed, looking at Cas’s face in the “After” photo. “I know we won, but Cas, you look like you’re gonna puke at any second in this picture.”
“Yeah it was.” Dean leaned against the wall, a huge smile plastered on his face. He rested his head against the concrete and pulled Cas against his chest. They stayed like that, listening to the music and enjoying the closeness.
Dean hated that look on Cas’s face. The sadness, the pity, the heart ache. He hated even more that he was the one who caused it.
The photo is kind of faded, taken on a Polaroid years ago, but Mary’s smile is still bright as ever. Her engagement ring caught a glint of the sun, and it flared. But honestly, it just made her look even more beautiful.
“When I was about two, she gave birth to Gabe. Everything seemed fine at first, but there was a complication and her heart gave out.”
Dean sunk to the ground, sitting cross-legged in front of the graffiti-covered wall. “Come sit next to me, I have an idea.”
“You won me that giant green monkey, and then you bought me the pretzel you owed me for eating my snacks. You told me you liked me, and then I kissed your beautiful, confused face and we…” Dean sniffled, taking a couple deep breaths, “we went on the Ferris wheel, and I asked you to be my boyfriend, and you said yes. I gotta tell you, that was the happiest day of my entire life.”
As soon as he stood up, a wave of pain hit him. His stomach was cramping, he felt nauseated, and was a little dizzy.
“You know,” Cas began, “the bottle says that Dawn not only saves wildlife, but it makes your hands softer in just three uses.”
Dean is taken aback. He was expecting to bolt out the door and take the first ship out to the moon, and have that be the end of it.
“Yeah. It can document are our lives together. Well, at least up until we get the house. We should start another one then.”
Dean spent most of his life feeling like an empty pit of nothingness, and he wanted his body to be in perfect alignment with his soul. It was hard, at first, but eventually it became easier. He found a balance, or at least he thought he did.
“I know it’s probably a waste, since they say you’re going to wake up in a couple days, but I thought this might make the room feel less sterile, and I know you were really looking forward to that exhibit at the zoo.”
Dean believed him. He knew Cas loved him, and he knew he had to try. He was scared though that instead of getting better, he would only get better at hiding his behavior.
However, his panic subsided when he looked down and noticed that Dean had fallen asleep. He hadn’t heard a thing. His eyelashes were splayed across his cheeks. His lips slightly parted so he could breathe. Cas leaned forward and placed a kiss on Dean’s forehead. He was precious.
Dean noticed that Cas didn’t seem okay, so he reached over, and grabbed Cas’s hand. “I’m not gonna let you go, okay? I got you.”
Dean raised an eyebrow, not even answering before grabbing Cas’s hand and heading over to the table. That was one of the things Cas loved about Dean, he was super competitive.
A soft crescendo of strings came through the speaker as Cas walked down the aisle. This was the happiest day of Dean’s entire life, and he remembered it well enough for the both of them.
Cas dropped Dean off after offering to bring him back to his house, as it was closer. Dean declined, saying he had to go check on Sam anyway. John would be pissed if he came home to find that Sam had gotten into trouble while Dean was off goofing around.
“You love me too?” Cas asked, tilting his head to the side. He looked like a puppy dog in puppy love.
Dean stayed until visiting hours were over, just in case Cas decided to be early, like he was with everything else. No such luck. But that was okay, because he knew in his soul that Cas was going to wake up on Day 22.
“I don’t want to be here if I can’t be with you,” Dean whispered along with the song. He just laid there next to Cas for hours, the song playing on repeat, until the nurses told him he had to leave.
A brief moment of silence fell between them. Cas stared at the man across from him. His bright green eyes, his freckled cheeks, his trembling lips. Cas had never seen anyone as beautiful as Dean Winchester.
DW: Hell yeah! You wanna go to Ellen’s? We could do the pancake challenge and check another thing off our list?
“The doctors are still waiting for some test results to come back. They said it would be for the best if they kept you overnight. Sam said he’s going to stop by in the morning, so you’ll have some company.”
Dean ran out of the room and headed straight to the bathroom. He had embarrassed himself in a variety of ways throughout his life, but he was pretty sure this was his crowning faux pas. He couldn’t even stand to be in the same room as Cas. He was sure he’d never want to talk to him again. After all, it was probably a friendship deal breaker to sleep in the same bed as your best friend and wake up with a hard on.
“Comedy Central will be playing White Chicks in about 15 minutes, and thank the lord because I’m sick of the news. There’s never anything good on on Fridays. Anyway, I decided we need to freshen up our knowledge of “A Thousand Miles,” so that we’re ready for Terry Crews and his dancing pecs.”
Dean knew his words were nothing but a quiet prayer sent into the ether. Despite the accident having been non-fatal, it might as well have killed Cas, because he wasn’t the same. The doctors said he might not ever fully regain his memory. He might not ever be him again.
He could feel his body twitch. Fighting for him to live. Lungs gasping in his chest, face flushed and eyes bulging.
Cas had a choice to make. He could sit around, missing Dean, and mourning, or he could get up and go save the most important person in his life. He thought about what Dean would do for him, and the choice was easy. He and Sam hopped into the impala, wheels screeching as they sped out into the darkness.
It wasn’t that he didn’t want to talk about it, as much as he didn’t know if he could. He was scared that if he started, everything would come pouring out, and he couldn’t have that.
Dean pulled out his phone, knowing there was only one person he could trust to help him with this situation.
“Oh, so you can take a picture of me, freshly dredged out of a swamp, but I can’t take a picture of you post-barbecue?” He waited for an answer, but Cas just let out a defeated sigh. “Smile!”
Cas rummaged through the trunk, finding a grease-stained towel for Dean to sit on. It wasn’t much, but it would keep the seats from getting soaked.
They laughed, and finished setting up the backyard. They put most of the snacks on a worn-down picnic table that John had built years ago, and Charlie hung some Christmas lights over the back door.
Dean poured the liquid in the grass then went back to the picnic table to get Cas a new drink. Charlie ran up to him, excited for an update.
“You know what would be fun?” Cas walked over to his desk and pulled out a distressed leather scrapbook with the words “Summer of Adventure” written on the front. He knew he probably should have asked Dean for his opinion on which one they should get, since it was a shared activity, but it seemed so perfect that he went with the “it’s better to beg forgiveness” option. Besides, the custom lettering was 50% off that day, so he had to take advantage of the sale. “If we got started on our scrapbook.”
Dean eyes were filled with terror, and shock, and hope. He could feel the warmth of Cas’s breathe against his chin.
That was all Cas could take, he started cracking up. One moment he was eating dinner with his family and his boyfriend, the next thing he knew, he was engaged and on the fast track to a split level in the suburbs, raising his two children.
Dean handed Cas a towel and a washcloth and sent him on his way. The bathroom was just outside Dean’s room so he could hear the water turn on and Cas humming something quietly to himself. It sounded familiar, but he couldn’t quite place it. Then Cas started singing the actual words, and Dean realized he was singing “Can’t Help Falling In Love.”
Dean places his hand on Cas’s cheek, pulling him in, closing the last few centimeters between them. And wow, it’s really happening.
Over the next couple of weeks, Dean seemed to be making progress. He talked with Cas about what kinds of foods he wanted in the house and what he didn’t. Cas respectfully listened. They cooked meals together, when they could, and they made sure to eat together as much as possible. Sam even stopped over with a pot of homemade chicken noodle soup saying “Hey, it’s medicine for the soul.”
As he grabs some napkins, Cas sneaks a quick kiss and it feels like a dream. Neither of them are sure how long it will last, or if they’ll even be able to survive much longer, given the conditions on Earth, but they’re happy to have another day. They look forward to seeing what the future holds, because at one time, the future seemed like a futile wish.
“What were you talking about?” Cas had a slew of emotions coursing through his body. Fear and confusion being the main ones.
Sam couldn’t help but notice the light in Dean’s eyes when he looked at Cas. He would never bring it up, because he knew how guarded his brother was, but there was no doubt there was something between the two of them.
Cas’s deal with the empty loomed over his head until it finally caught up with him. Death was pounding on the door, set on killing him and Dean as soon as she broke through. Dean knew it, and Cas could see the fear in his eyes. This wasn’t how he thought it would happen, but he knew he had a shot at saving Dean if he could just tell him the truth.
It wasn’t unusual, but that meant that Cas had definitely seen the text message and chose to ignore it. That could only mean one thing: time for damage control.
They paid for the full 18 holes. Cas was excited, as this was one of the few sports that he excelled at. Dean liked to tease him about it, but he wouldn’t be laughing after Cas whooped his ass up and down the course.
After a few minutes of deliberating and self-loathing, he caved. He made his way to the bathroom, closed the door, and locked it behind him. He had at least twenty minutes before Cas would be back. If he was going to do this, he’d have to be quick.
“See,” Cas said, taking Dean’s hand into his own, the warm water dripping between their fingers. “Tell me these hands aren’t ready to save all the oil-slicked baby ducklings in the world.”
As they headed out, Dean checked the time. Great. It was 3:55pm. He told Charlie to meet him there at 3:40pm, and while she had met Cas a couple of times, he didn’t want to put her through the awkwardness of making small talk with Cas’s family.
Even though he thought it was stupid, Dean linked his pinky finger with Cas’s. If it meant something to Cas, then it meant something to him.
“You’re supposed to be the man of the house, Dean!” John yelled, swinging his belt through the air. “No son of mine is going to like boys, do you fucking hear me?” He brought his belt down again and again.
“It’s no big deal. Really. Honestly, it was hilarious. So don’t let it ruin your night, because I’m not gonna let it ruin mine.” Cas rests his head on Dean’s shoulder and places a quick kiss to the back of Dean’s hand. It calms Dean down enough that he lets himself cuddle under the blanket with Cas and watch the rest of the movie.
“Hey Cas. I got a little surprise for you today. I thought maybe a little walk down memory lane might stir something in you.” He sat down and pulled their scrapbook from his backpack. He traced the words on the leather cover with his fingers, thinking back to the day Cas first showed it to him. It seemed stupid at the time, but now he was glad he agreed to it.
“Thank you,” Cas said, placing his hand on Dean’s knee, gently running his thumb back and forth over the worn denim.
Dean was beyond scared. But then he looked into those beautiful blue eyes, and he knew he couldn’t fight this any longer.
John stood up and made his way over to the two. He pulled Dean into a hug, telling him that he was proud of him. He gave Cas a hug too, welcoming him to the Winchester family.
“Nope. Don’t think I’d know how, anyway.” Dean has never seen anything like this in person. Only from time to time in commercials. This is the kind of Jetsons stuff he grew up thinking would be all the rage in the future, and now, it’s just another toy for people who have that kind of money to toss around.
He washed his hands, and brushed his teeth minty-fresh. He went to the kitchen for a glass of water just as Cas was walking through the door.
Luckily, they can still purify the water so it’s safe to drink, but the air is an entirely different beast. The gas masks help to reduce exposure, but there are so many people who don’t believe they work. They think whatever this gas is, they’ll build up immunity to it. It’s stupid.
Dean headed to the kitchen and poured himself a drink. It was just a shot of whiskey, which normally wouldn’t draw eyes, but Dean hadn’t been drinking as of late.
This was nothing like any other kiss Dean had ever experienced. This was so soft, and light. A gentle caress. There was no pain, no hatred, no rage behind it. This was pure love. This was more than a quick hook up or something to numb his past. This was different, and so, so, good.
He looked at the beautiful man in his arms, and he knew Cas would be hurt if he said no. He knew Cas would get concerned. So he scooped up a handful and ate it. Cas smiled, and Dean thought the rest of the night would be okay.
“First of all, let me start by saying how thankful I am that you are here with us. We’re all very aware that this holiday season could’ve been very different, but instead we all get to be together, and for that I’m grateful.”
Thinking maybe he was in the bathroom or went to get a glass of water, Cas searches his entire apartment, only to find it empty.
“Alright. You hop in the shower, get cleaned up, and I’ll find you some clothes you can wear.” They were similar in size, though Dean was a bit taller. They tended not to share clothes because they had very different styles, but given the circumstances, style probably wouldn’t be  Cas’s biggest concern.
Looking down at their hands, Cas noticed the matching rings. Identical gold bands engraved with tiny lettering, and it finally clicked.
Precisely 28 seconds later, Dean was counting on his watch, Cas appeared knocking on the passenger side window. “Let me in.”
“Get better soon!” “Sorry you got sick” And lots of little hearts and stickers. One kid just drew a skateboarding monster, but Dean still appreciated the sentiment.
Dean knew he had been a dick to Cas so many times, and that he was an alcohol-fueled trainwreck, but here Cas was, handsome and kind, willing to accept him for everything that he was.
“I don’t actually know how to say this, so I’m just going to be honest.” Cas kept his eyes fixed on the space between them, as he bounced his leg out of nervousness. “You make me feel things that I can’t even begin to describe. And when I’m around you, my heart races, and I can’t stop smiling, and my knees get weak, and all that other mushy stuff that I know you hate. I didn’t want to say anything because I was too afraid of losing you, but if I didn’t tell you the truth, I was going to explode.”
“If you have something that’s weighing on you, I’d appreciate you letting me know. I just want to help.” Cas cupped Dean’s cheek in his palm. It was so soft that Dean almost pulled away. He didn’t deserve anything that gentle, that kind, that full of love.
As the opening credits rolled, Dean set a bowl of popcorn between them. It was a tight fit on his bed, but they made it work. At some point, they both reached into the bowl and their hands touched. Their heads snapped up. They stared at each other, neither one saying a word. It took every ounce of power Cas had not to react, but Dean simply turned his attention back to the screen and gobbled down the popcorn.
He spent the better part of his Friday morning unloading boxes and sorting through various food donations with about 80 other volunteers at the Helping Hands food bank. He always chose to volunteer there because they sourced to local pantries, and he loved coming back to the familiar faces. It was like a home away from home.
All of a sudden it felt like his insides were on fire. He was afraid that one of his organs had ruptured and that he was bleeding internally. Everything felt bad.
But tonight, neither of them are worried about that. They want to put reality on the backburner, and pretend that two friends could hang out like normal. Like people used to.
He decided it didn’t matter what the consequences would be, because this felt right, this felt good, and damn it, he deserved good things just as much as everyone else. He knew how he felt, and the urge to act on those feelings was just too strong, so he took advantage of his lowered inhibitions, leaned in, and kissed Dean.
“It better be. I’ve been working on a new soil that soaks up the toxic gas and converts it to pure CO2. I grew the tomatoes in it and they turned out wonderful. I grew and handpicked the basil, too.”
The three made casual talk about the werewolf situation, and what their game plan would be when they got into town.
“I want to be right here with you.” Dean turns his head to look into Cas’s eyes, and Cas returns the look with a smile.
“I can honestly say I’ve never been banned from a property before. It was kinda fun,” Cas said, starting the car.
Cas puts on some music and fixes their plates. Dean takes his with extra meat, because honestly, it smells delicious, and it probably tastes just as good.
“I love how certain smells and tastes can take you back, you know? Do you have any fond memories associated with champagne?”
John found it and was furious. He stormed into the living room where Dean was watching TV. Sam had fallen asleep a few hours before.
It was bad enough not getting to see his best friend as often, but to have all of his fears come to life right in front of him? The worst.
Dean hadn’t seen the picture before. He didn’t even know Cas had took the picture. It was a little dark, but it was during the finale of the fireworks, Sam was looking over his shoulder at Dean, pointing as his favorite firework went off.
He opted with his tried and true passion: volunteering. His family spent last summer volunteering at the local food bank, and he figured that would be an easy fit. He loved giving back to the community, especially because he was in such an opportune place to do so. His family was well off, he had plenty of down time, plus the volunteer work would look excellent on his future resume. It was a win-win for everyone.
Cas queued up a bunch of movies he knew Dean loved, and set out two big bowls of chips and popcorn for them to share. He also picked up some non-diet soda, chocolate, and licorice. This was supposed to be a fun night, and from what Cas had seen of events like this, it’s an excuse to eat a bunch of junk food. He topped it off with super comfy blankets, pillows, and matching pajamas. He couldn't wait!
“Well, yeah you dingus.” Charlie had a way with words. “You ignored him all day, so he’s probably just trying to level the playing field. Like when you like someone, and they text you, and you don’t want to seem too desperate, so you wait like twice as long to text them back. Obviously, you were out doing things and living a life separate from him, he probably just wants you to think he’s busy and living his best life too.”
His eyes narrowed as he tried to understand the flashes of fogged up memory that were coming back to him, like he was trying to recall the details of a dream.
If Cas had to pick a location for a first date, his initial choice probably wouldn’t be a themed dive bar, yet here he was, knuckle deep in boneless wings, smiling like an idiot, across from a beautiful guy. He would’ve opted for the little Italian restaurant downtown, or mini golf, but Dean insisted on Pirate’s Cove, and how could he turn down that deep voice and those puppy dog eyes?
Then he met another woman, one who was more conservative. She rarely drank, liked to go to sleep at a reasonable hour, and reserved her partying for dinners with friends. She and Chuck hit it off, and nine months later, along came little Castiel.
The shoulder bar came down and then the lap bar secured it in place. Cas took deep breaths, trying his best not to hyperventilate. He was pretty sure that the ride operator thought he was going to throw up as she made her rounds to check the buckles.
“Well I told Cas that your family’s flight got canceled so you would’ve spent Thanksgiving by yourself.”
They pushed those memories of “what if” to the back-burner as they approached the house, choosing instead to focus on having a good time.
In an attempt to cheer him up, Cas told a joke about bees. Dean was the only one who laughed. Normally Cas would feel self-conscious and try to change the subject or run away, but all he could focus on was how Dean’s eyes squinted as his cheeks rose into a smile, and how his body leaned in as he let out an honest-to-God laugh. Cas’s vision was blurred, making the string of lights on the wall flare around Dean’s head in an ethereal display of colors.
“Okay,” Cas starts, “A group of plants I had recently bread started producing high levels of hydrogen, but I didn’t know that. So one day, I go to plug in my coffee maker, and the plug sparks, and this huge fireball fills the room.”
A guide named Hannah corrals the tour group, and Cas takes the opportunity to pull Dean aside. He looks like something is weighing on him. His jaw is tight and he’s guarded. He’s not his usual smiling and personable self.
It wasn’t like Cas could tell him that his eyes were mesmerizing, even in the low light of the room, or that his freckles were scattered like constellations across his cheeks, or that his lips looked so very, very kissable. So he lied.
After about 15 minutes, Dean finally made it back to the car. He shut the gas tank and got back in the driver’s seat, where he found Cas, eyes wide with guilt.
Tonight, those thoughts came flooding to the surface. Right in front of him was all his wildest dreams, waiting for him to make a move.
As he typed out his response, his thumb hovered over the heart emoji, debating whether or not that would be coming on too strong. He didn’t have much experience flirting with boys, so this was all new territory. He decided to go with the less than three, because that felt more casual, but still conveyed the message of “Hey, I think I
A worn-out voice answered from the other side, “Not good man. But it think that might be the last of it. Hopefully.” Dean opened the door, looking like death. He stumbled when he walked, but Cas helped him back to his room.
“I got you this little teddy bear that’s holding a heart that reads “I love you bear-y much.” I know it’s not as grand as the monkey you won me at Fun Fair, but with us, it’s always been the thought that counts. And I can’t stop thinking about you.”
Dean stared into the the angel’s blue eyes, his soft hair that he wanted to run his hands through, the pajama pants that Dean let him borrow. He thought about how much he cared for this man. How much he wanted to hold him. All the things he could open himself up to. But he couldn’t.
Dean snuck away to the upstairs bathroom, hoping the distance would be enough of a cover. He turned on the faucet and kneeled before the toilet.
He couldn’t believe that really happened. He woke up in Dean Winchester’s arms. Dean Winchester may or may not have been turned on by him. There was a good chance that it was just his body reacting to the situation and that his body would’ve done the same exact thing if it was anyone else sharing the bed with him, but Cas liked the version where Dean reciprocated his feelings better.
“What? It seemed like the kind of project for large paper. You have to be able to visualize your goals if you want to achieve them, Dean.”
“Personally, I’m a fan of the Ferris wheel,” Cas said, looking up at the giant revolving circle of spokes and rainbow topped cabins.
They sat for a moment, both adjusting to the truth of what just happened. In the distance, Dean could see the lights on the rides turn on. He had an idea.
Charlie was the first one to show up, chips and soda in hand. Dean was thankful for her help, because he knew he wouldn’t be able to do everything by himself. She helped get the lawn chairs out of the garage, fending off quite a few spiders along the way.
After only a couple days back from college, Cas and his parents got into a heated argument. In desperate need of a distraction, Cas texted Dean. As soon as Dean read Cas’s text, he suggested going to a party that one of his friends was throwing. It wasn’t Cas’s usual scene, but he figured it would be a good opportunity to get his mind off things. He texted back saying he was game.
Dean asked his orientation leaders what Cas should do since he’s not able to attend orientation. He was told that it would have to be handled by the administrative offices, but it shouldn’t be too hard to straighten out.
Five minutes after one, there’s a knock on Cas’s door. He looks through the peephole and sees a large bouquet of bright yellow flowers. He opens the door and the flowers are slowly lowered to reveal Dean, with an apologetic look on his face.
Cas pulled the chair out for him. As he sat down, the delicious smell hit him. His stomach rumbled a desperate plea for Dean to just give in. He lost whatever self control he thought he had and he dug in. He stuffed his mouth full of the fluffy pancakes and crispy bacon. It tasted like heaven.
Dean wrapped his arm around Cas, and snapped the picture. It made him feel better knowing that they both had disgusting pictures with hilarious backstories. At the rate they were going, the scrapbook was going to be a compilation of two friends slowly approaching their death.
“Too late!” Sam said, entering the kitchen with a duffle bag slung over his shoulder. “So would you guys prefer that I stick with the conventional Destiel, or can I opt for my personal favorite: CasDean?”
This time when he opened his eyes, it was almost overwhelming. Cas was forced to face the truth because it was sitting right across from him. He was scared. This was a moment he had fantasized about many times before, but just briefly enough that it became a thought, then he’d bury it along with all the other nice things he’d never be able to have. But not tonight.
“Dean, I’m so sorry. I never should’ve done that. That was stupid. I’m so, so sorry. Please don’t be mad.”
Cas collapsed to the ground, rolling around in the dirt, as Dean forcefully beat his arm in an attempt to extinguish and remaining flames.
Even though Dean had to switch schools, they went with each other to their respective middle school dances. They even wore matching converse. Then for Halloween, they coordinated their costumes.
“Well they can suck a dick and die, because I want a sunset selfie with my new boyfriend.” Cas pulled out his phone and tried to take the picture, but no matter how far he extended his arm, he couldn’t get both of their faces in the picture. He sighed, offering his phone to Dean, “Can you take it?”
“You’ve been eyeing these things all day, and I know you’re upset that you weren’t able to win one, so I won one for you.”
When Cas turned 18, he took it upon himself to research the steps to start hormone replacement therapy on his own. He found a couple local psychiatrists and endocrinologists who would be willing to see him. It was a process, but luckily he had some college refund money saved up, and he was approved.
Cas pulls back the covers and lays on his side of the bed, patting the space next to him. “Come here.”
“What’s the word today, Missouri?” Cas scooped up a spoon full of mashed potatoes and placed them on the lunch tray.
Dean cradled Cas’s face in his hand, caressing his cheek ever so gently with his thumb. He thought about what the future would hold for them, and honestly, he couldn’t think of a more fitting sentiment, so he simply nodded his head and said, “Me too.”
Sam fills Dean in on what’s been going on in his life. He’s doing well. Turns out, there’s this cute girl who works with him and he finally got the courage to ask her out. Her name is Eileen, and Sam has said himself that she’s intimidating because she’s smarter than him. Dean thinks that’s a good thing, because he could use someone to keep him in check. Most importantly though, Sam is happy, and living his best life.
It wasn’t fun to see Dean down on himself, especially because Cas honestly didn’t care about the now forgotten events of the morning, but he had an idea that he was sure would make both of them feel better.
“You know, drug stores are around for a reason. You can use them. God was very adamant about the work of doctors.”
“For what?” Dean lifted his hand to stroke the hair on the back of Cas’s head. It was gentle. A kind of touch that Cas hadn’t known well, but seemingly felt at home within. This was autumn-breeze-easy, an alignment of stars, years in the making, that led them to this abandoned house. It felt a bit like two lifetimes falling into forever.
When they arrived home, they decided to watch a movie. Again. Dean had picked it especially because it was one of Cas’s favorites. He could pretty much quote the whole thing, and Dean found that incredibly endearing.
Cas wasn’t doing much better, whatever was in his cup hit him pretty hard and it took most of his energy not to pop the ping pong ball in his mouth and project it across the table.
“Look, Cas.” Dean took a moment to think about what he wanted to say. Nothing about this was easy for him. “I’ve never brought any of this up because I still haven’t fully come to terms with it. Everyone assumes that I’m straight, which is fine, because that’s how I’ve wanted it to be. But I know the truth.”
“Don’t you go blaming yourself for this. You have been more supportive than I deserve. You have made sure I stuck to our plan. You have held me and talked with me and been the best husband I could’ve asked for. You did nothing wrong, and you are not the problem here, so don’t you ever say that again.”
As the meal drew to a close, and everyone was starting to get drowsy from the turkey, Dean decided it would be a good time to put his plan into motion. He cleared his throat, clinking his fork against his glass of cider.
The bottle stopped spinning and it was pointed right at him. This was really happening. It wasn’t a dream, it wasn’t wishful thinking, the boy that he absolutely had a crush on was about to kiss him.
“Cas sent me a text asking if we could hang out when I got done with my shift, and I got distracted because a couple people from work wanted to hang out, and I didn’t text him back until super late. I said I was sorry, and that we could hang out today, but he left me on read. Then this morning, he posted a brunch picture on Instagram, and I’m pretty sure the caption was a vague post about me.”
The two take a moment, looking at the faces on Cas’s wall, trying to process what any of their grief means in this day and age. What two lost parents mean in a decade of thousands of lost parents. What a brother taking on the role of father means when mothers and fathers are now childless.
It was pouring rain, and Dean almost didn’t show up because it was raining when Cas got into his accident, but he just drove extra careful. It was worth the risk.
Cas’s room was the exact opposite of Dean’s. In fact, the entire Novak family was pretty much the polar opposite of the Winchesters. Mr. and Mrs. Novak were happily married, and in addition to Cas, they had three other children, Gabe, who was the youngest, Michael who was the second youngest, and Anael, who was the oldest. Their house was always clean, never a dish in the sink, plus they had central air.
Cas finished washing a cup, and handed it to Dean. Their fingers brushed, and a spark coursed through Dean’s body. He quickly began toweling off the water, turning his head to hide the smirk on his face.
It was a hard reset. He got to go back to being pure, being good, instead of being a disappointment. He couldn’t let this happen again.
Cas discovered the flowers last year, and he considers it a great accomplishment. When dried up and brewed into tea, the drink has been shown to counteract stomach singe. While rare, people were dying from holes being burned through their stomach, and thanks to Cas, doctors were able to lower the death rate.
“Listen, I know this is not that big of a deal for you guys, but Cas’s family was kind enough to invite us over for dinner, so the least we could do is look nice, and be on time. Mrs. Novak said they eat at 4, so based on your previous track record, you all need to be ready...” Dean checked the time on his phone, “an hour ago.”
Dean kneeled down, pulling a small black box from his pocket. He was shaking so bad, he almost dropped it.
Benny was in charge of the alcohol, and he did not disappoint. There was quite the assortment of beer, vodka, tequila, whiskey, and rum. He was the only one in the group with a fake I.D., and cashiers never questioned him because he was 6 feet tall and had a beard. Turns out, puberty had its benefits.
There are tons of options and features, which Dean thinks is wild because this is a window. The coolest part about his window is the gummy lizard that Sam got stuck to it a few years back. He could’ve scraped it off, but it kind of looks like stained glass when the sun shines through, so he kept it there.
He pushed the toothbrush to the back of his mouth, triggering his gag reflex and suddenly up came the food. The sound of it was wretched, the smell was vile, but hell if Dean didn’t feel the weight being lifted off his shoulders. He repeated the action, again and again, his muscles contracted to spew the sin from his body.
“Excuse me everyone. I’d like to say a few words.” Dean stood up, gesturing across the table. “Castiel...”
Cas stopped moving his hand, shocked by what he let slip out of his mouth. He wasn’t supposed to say that. This was Dean. Dean who wanted boundaries. Dean who wanted personal space. Dean who Cas had to try so hard to hide his very obvious feelings from.
At dinner, Cas was almost too embarrassed to order anything. Dean insisted on paying, and this was the kind of place that didn’t put dollar signs on the menu. They sipped their drinks and picked at their appetizers under the warm glow of candle light.
“I’m so hungry, this tastes like heaven,” Dean said through a stuffed mouth, the bit off piece of pretzel flopping around as he spoke.
The meeting was great for everyone, except for Dean. He didn’t have his materials organized or enough for everyone in the room. He was off his game, and his manager let him know.
Dean almost says yes, because he’s never felt anything like this before in his life. It’s intoxicating, being around Cas. Feeling like he’s important to someone. But he knows there’s a bigger picture to focus on. It’s about more than just him.
Over the past year, Dean and Cas had their fair share of arguments and misunderstandings, and Dean was sure that this was the result of the latter.
But then the wave of nausea passed and it gave way to something that felt much worse. Dean sat on the toilet, feeling cramps in his stomach that were worse than anything he’s ever experienced.
Dean stopped drinking his coffee mid-sip, setting his cup on the table, “No. We live a hunter's life. This Sunday breakfast, sun shining, birds chirping crap doesn’t last. Not for us. I’m going to finish this cup of coffee, then we’re going to hop into Baby and take a trip to Colorado to kill some werewolves. And that’s what I get to have. That’s my everyday.”
“Now, I have a hunch about who that might be, but I have a terrible track record with these things, so if you could just confirm who you’re talking about that would be-”
It was around noon when Dean decided he would binge on an entire pizza for lunch. Fuck self-control. Fuck his plans. He had been craving it all week, and he finally caved. He had to wait for a day when he was off, and Cas had work, and today was the day. He preheated the oven and waited patiently as the meat lovers pizza cooked.
Cas scoffs, “That weird “goop” happens to work as a sunblock for the inhabitants of the Whirlpool Galaxy. Their sun is much more harmful than ours, but the vines only grow on Earth.”
Right after Dean said that, he leaned over and puked into the garbage bin Cas placed next to the bed. Cas had a smug look on his face and Dean kind of wanted to punch him.
“You look constipated. Let’s go.” Cas grabbed Dean’s hand and dragged him over to the check-in counter before he could interject.
The way Cas says it is very nonchalant, and if Dean were in his shoes, he’d brag every chance he got. But he knows Cas really is in it to help the world, and that’s one of the things he likes the most about him.
“Where? Where’s the snake!” He spun around trying to locate it, but it was to no avail. “Is it on me? I feel like it’s on me!”
Dean took his time cleaning the dishes, welcoming a distraction. The hearty breakfast was starting to get to him. Cas was in their room grading papers, he’d definitely hear any sounds that came from the bathroom.
Overcome by a nearly insatiable fervor, Cas pressed his lips against Dean’s. There was a spark that ignited something in both of them. It was like two currents crashing and swirling into each other, yet feather light and delicate. Desperately craved, like the first rainfall of a scorching summer. This felt like oasis.
For a moment, Dean stood outside the door, listening to Cas sing. He knew it was dumb, but he imagined that Cas was singing it to him. He loved his voice.
“So we can play catch when we’re on the road,” Sam said with a smile of pure innocence. It did get pretty boring on the road. Hours of driving, always waking up in a new town that looked exactly like the previous one. They were thankful for anything that helped pass the time.
Dean wasn’t as fit as he used to be, he knew that. And even though Cas had a smile on his face, Dean felt like this was a polite warning. Cas didn’t want to hurt his feelings, so he was dropping subtle hints that Dean was letting himself go. He had to change, and he had to change fast.
Two days before he had to leave, Dean decided to visit Cas in a last ditch effort to get him to wake up. He came up with a plan, and he didn’t know if it would help, but he didn’t care. He was willing to try anything.
He tried to stand up, but he was too dizzy. His hearing started to fade, followed by his vision. Everything got hazy. Then everything went black.
Dean was super focused, well, as focused as a tipsy man could be. Before each shot, he would take a deep breath, steady his hand, and carefully aim. It was usually followed by a frustrated grunt when he missed.
“We may have to do that again,” Cas said, referring to both the ride and the hug, but Dean didn’t have to know that.
“No, I’m fine. It barely ate through the fabric.” Cas tried to dust himself off, but he was covered, head to toe, in grime.
“Oh,” Dean gives Cas a sly smile, “You wanted to show me your bedroom? Cas, I gotta say, I didn’t peg you as the kind of guy who gives it up on the first date.”
It seemed intimidating, knowing they only had about two months to get everything done, but they were gonna try. This was the last summer before the start of the next big chapter of their lives. They knew college was going to be stressful, full of late nights, cramming for tests, and crying about impending project deadlines. This was their chance to experience a small slice of the world before they had to buckle down.
“My medicine is usually a shot of whiskey, but I don’t see that working out too well in this situation,” Dean joked.
But tonight, he had a dream, like so many other nights, where a certain angelic figure sneaks into his bed. Tonight, he woke up, like so many other nights, because he could still hear John’s voice. He could still feel the pain.
“Dad turned to the bottle. Became a drunk. And not a nice one. A lot of the time I had to take Sam and ride our bikes to our Uncle Bobby’s house just to keep us safe.”
“I want you to know that there are not a lot of songs about bees, or that even mention bees, so I went with the only one I’ve heard of.”
A week goes by, and Dean still hasn’t showed up for the garden tour. Cas finds it odd, because Dean usually stops by at least once a week, if not more. He’s starting to get worried that maybe something happened to him.
The group of people who were on the ride got off, and the line moved forward. They were officially at the point of no return. Cas looked mortified.
This was who Cas was meant to be. The angel who rebelled against heaven, who believed in free will, who fought and died for the greater good, for humanity, for love, and despite the many attempts at changing him, those had always been Castiel’s true colors.
Their lips were impossibly close when Dean let the gentle stream of smoke flow from his mouth to Cas’s. It was a lot easier than smoking it straight. It didn’t burn as much. Cas closed his eyes and let the high wash over him as he held his breath. He felt calm, a moment of peace away from the chaos of the outside world. He exhaled and opened his eyes, finding Dean’s a few inches from his face.
“Be right back.” Cas ran down the hall, searching through Gabe’s things. He’d be pissed, but Cas didn’t care. He ran back to his room, stick in hand. “This should work.”
“I didn’t know what to think. You were barely conscious, you couldn’t speak. I thought I lost you.” Cas stopped, looking down at the floor.
Cas pursed his lips and squinted his eyes as he thought it over. He raised his right hand, fingers curled into a fist, and for a second Dean thought he was getting ready to hit him, but Cas simply extended one finger.
When they pulled apart, Cas kept his eyes closed, lingering in the moment. As he opened his eyes, he saw Dean biting his lip with a smirk. It was all so perfect.
Cas can feel his heart plummet. Here’s this wonderful man, who he thought he might actually have a shot with, a potential future with, and he’s going to be moving to the fucking moon. Fantastic.
He fell backwards on his bed, happy to have avoided the wrath of John Winchester, at least for one night. He checked his phone and saw a notification from Cas.
“Babe, I’m gonna run to the store real quick, we’re out of milk. Do you need anything?” Cas asked, peeking his head into the room.
Dean showed up wearing his brand new collegiate sweatpants and lanyard with his I.D. hanging from it.
“It’s not up for debate.” Dean pursed his lips and cocked his eyebrow. Cas simply sighed in agreement. “Thank you all for coming over. Hopefully we can do it again sometime, but with less arson.”
“Well, I’m 18, and in his eyes, and in the eyes of the law, that’s an adult, so I don’t have much of a choice here.”
He clears those thoughts from his head, and focuses instead on the moment that he’s getting to experience. Another day, alive and well, with a beautiful man next to him.
Cas nods, walking over to where Dean is. He goes through each picture, highlighting who was who. Dean thinks he would’ve liked to meet Gabe, and thinks he probably would’ve punched Michael. He notices, though, that there are no pictures of Cas’s parents on the wall.
At the back of the park was the Soaring Eagle, a pendulum style ride where your feet dangle as you swing back and forth until eventually, you do a full rotation, and end up hanging upside down.
“I don’t think you can on this one, buddy.” Dean patted Cas on the shoulder. It was a lie, and Dean knew that. He just didn’t think he was ready to go down that road. Dean started to walk out of the room, when he heard a voice call out:
People are dying at such a high rate that world leaders worked together to create a colony on the moon. The crematoriums can barely keep up. Every night when lock down commences, the vaccubots sweep the streets, attempting to purify the air as much as they can. Cas’s main mission is to find some hybrid plant that can take in this gas and turn it into oxygen. Or at least something that can help clean the air. It’s a crisis. And most days, it feels like there’s no way out.
Dean walked to the other side of the table, taking Cas’s hands into his own, asking him to stand. Cas’s eyes went wide, like he realized what was about to happen. Dean’s hands were shaking, and his knees were ready to give out. He took a deep breath, trying to steady himself for what he was about to do.
Dean’s moment of relaxation was interrupted by the unmistakable sound of leather slipping through belt loops. Dean knew what would happen next.
He checked his phone, still no reply from Dean. He didn’t consider himself to be one of those people that expects instant replies, but he was kind of agitated that Dean couldn’t have given him a quick answer in the now 4 hours that had passed. On top of that, the message said it was read.
“Just apologize for being a dick, and keep it moving. I’m sure he’ll understand that you didn’t purposefully leave him in the dark.”
“Cas, I swear to God if your ass is not in the passenger's seat of my car in the next 30 seconds, I’m grabbing whichever one of your siblings is closest, and I’m taking them instead. Let’s go!” Dean grabbed the bag of snacks he packed for the road trip and stomped off to the impala.
Dean took a bite of the candy, and that seemed to make Cas happy. It continued on like that for the rest of the night. Cas would pick a treat, eat some, then feed Dean the rest. By the end of the 3rd movie, all the snacks were gone.
As Cas excitedly filled his plate, Dean had to remind himself that this was a marathon, not a sprint. He had to cherish the little bit of good that cut through the bad. He knew that his husband wasn’t entirely himself yet, and that he might not ever be, but some of the pieces had resurfaced, and that was all he needed to put his heart at ease.
Dean was gone. He wasn’t dead, but he wasn’t here, and he wasn’t in control of himself. Cas didn’t know which one was worse. He knew he should be out looking for him, trying to do something. Anything. But he could barely bring himself to walk around the bunker, much less scour the country. Part of him thought it was safer this way. Given his track record, he’d probably make things worse if he got involved.
By the time he woke up the next day, Cas had already headed off to work. Hopefully Cas would forget about the incident by the time he got home.
“Job hunting? It’s summer, Dean. Doesn’t he know kids are supposed to enjoy their time off before college?”
Shortly after Cas came out of the coma, Dean sat down and explained everything to John. He was scared as hell, but he didn’t want to keep their relationship a secret. John was surprisingly ok with it. Well, more okay with it than Dean had anticipated. John said he had some suspicions for a while, so it wasn’t so much of a shock. He asked all these questions about how it was that Dean could be gay if he had so many girlfriends in the past. It took a while for John to grasp the concept of bisexuality, but once they got on the same page, he started to come around.
They resumed the game, everyone taking sips from their own cup when needed. The game went back and forth until it was down to two cups each. It was anyone’s game.
He settled on a peach cobbler and a pumpkin pie that had a questionable expiration date that was partially scratched off the packaging. It most likely wouldn’t kill anyone.
He bit into his lip so hard it bled. The copper taste of blood stained his taste buds. Pain was the only thing Dean felt worthy of. He knew he was worthless. Knew he would never accomplish any good in this world.
“Come on Cas, you know we haven’t been able to see stars in years.” Dean stands up and looks out the window. Sure enough, there was nothing out there but the remnants of dead trees and a black sky. These days, the moon is hardly ever visible with all the smog.
Dean wasn’t ever the type for gooey romance, but coming from Cas it just felt right. It didn’t feel forced or staged, it felt genuine, and Dean couldn’t remember the last time he felt that kind of love.
He clicks on a couple different settings. The basic ones just change the screen to a solid color. Another button makes it strobe. There are some that are just basic backgrounds and graphics that come with the software.
The more he thought about it, the less ridiculous it seemed. He knew he was young, and still had to get through college, and still had a lot of growing left to do, but he had an entire life with Dean to look forward to. People spend most of their lives trying to find that special someone, and here they were, lucky enough to have found each other so early on.
“I think that’s a compromise I can work with. But I’m telling you right now, if things get bad, you’re getting help. I love you too much to constantly see you struggling.”
I first told you I loved you. We ate at the same restaurant where I proposed to you. I even put you in the exact same suit you were wearing that night. I tried so hard to make everything absolutely identical in hopes that you would remember some part of it.”
“My mom died when I was young too. It was just me, my dad, and my brother Sam.” Dean doesn’t talk about his personal life. Ever. But he thinks Cas, of all people, will understand where he’s coming from. And maybe he can let Cas know he’s not alone in all of this.
The motion was pure muscle memory as Cas unfurled his wings. The vibrant rainbow feathers shimmered like stained glass, the holiness of pure happiness refracting in all the colors. They were light. No longer a burden he needed to carry, but instead they felt like air itself. Their beauty seemingly given life with the truth spoken in his final breath.
Kevin cautiously walked over to her, leaning in as slowly as he possibly could. It was only about a 2 second kiss, but it was worth a lifetime of weird feelings.
“Based on your mood,” a robotic voice rang from the surround sound speakers, “I would recommend Our Handsome Gardener. Rated X. Filmed in 2015. Matt finally succumbs to his urge to play with the family gardener’s hose. He hopes to convert this hot horticulturist into a horny-culturist by sucking on his huge-”
It was Cas. Of course it was Cas, because Dean could never be self destructive in secret. Someone had to find out. He could maybe play it off. It wasn’t too late.
In that moment, all the negative thoughts that had been haunting Dean were silenced. He felt a sense of peace wash over him. This felt right. It felt like home.
“Oh no.” Cas sets his water on the table. “Are you about to break up with me before we’re even a couple?”
For Dean, this was a chance to make decisions for himself, and for Cas, this was an opportunity to make lasting memories with his best friend. They were both ready for the chaos to begin.
“Shit.” It was dark, and Dean could barely make out his surroundings. He had a pounding headache, and his mouth felt dry.
“You’re right. Never mind all that.” Cas wiped the tears from his eyes. “I’m just happy you’re here and that we get to spend another day together.”
The first thing Dean did when he woke up was check his phone. He fully expected to see a text from Cas, so he was a little disappointed when there wasn’t one. He didn’t think he had done anything wrong, but maybe Cas was upset with him about something. Or maybe he was busy and needed some space. Cas did tend to get into moods where he didn’t want to speak to anyone. Dean figured it might be best to let him work through whatever was going on.
“It’s not your fault. I’ve been living these same couple of days with you for weeks. Every morning you wake up, and you’re surprised that I made you pancakes. Every morning you sit across the table from me, as if it were the first time. And every morning my heart sinks.”
The candles were a “2” and a “3,” no combination of which was remotely close to Dean’s age, but that’s what Bobby had leftover from one of his previous birthdays. It was fine though, because Dean couldn’t remember the last time he had a birthday party or a cake. It was probably when his mother was still alive.
“I know that I love women, there’s no doubt in my mind about that... but hell, if I don’t love you too.”
Dean’s skin was warm, and Cas could feel his muscles tense under his touch. Dean sunk into it. Cas was so gentle and Dean hadn’t felt that kind of touch in a while.
The three of them sat around the little wooden table and they gave Dean his presents. Considering he barely remembered it was his birthday himself, this was more than he could've asked for. Bobby got him a pack of baseball cards, and Sam got him a beat up baseball that he most likely found at a goodwill or in a park nearby.
The next morning, Cas slowly drifts into consciousness, the memories of last night playing back in his head. A smile spreads across his face as he starts to open his eyes. He turns over, reaching out to pull Dean into a hug, only to find that his bed is empty.
This was Cas’s last chance to back out. He could come up with some elaborate lie on the spot to explain everything away. He could sprint back to the car and hopefully never have to mention this ever again. But instead, he decided to get everything off his chest.
It was about three films and two bags of popcorn later when Sam came back. He was happy to see Cas had left Dean’s room.
Nothing was right. The world felt empty and Dean felt depleted. Sam did everything he could to try to get through to his brother. Dean only left the room at odd hours of the morning to use the bathroom and that was it. Sam would leave trays of food and water outside the door, which would be missing on every third trip or so to check on Dean.
Cas spent the whole day pondering what the evening’s events would entail. Dean hadn’t told him too much, apart from the fact that they were going someplace upscale. Dean had also taken the liberty of picking out a suit for Cas to wear.
The afternoon of Thanksgiving, Dean was trying to get his brother and his father to get ready in a timely fashion. It was only 2:30pm, but he knew how hard it was to get those two to do anything on a deadline.
Dean runs his thumb over Cas’s cheek, trying to feel connected, like maybe that touch would ground him and it would make the decision easier. If anything, it makes it harder. He likes Cas, and he didn’t really even want to leave that morning, but he knew there was no future between them. He’d be off to the moon in a week or two, no sense in stringing along an amazing man just to break his heart. But then again, here he is, breaking his heart. And here Cas is, begging him to stay.
Dean opened it to the first page where they put their list. He looked over all of the things that were left unchecked. There was still so much they had to do, and Cas couldn’t check out until they finished it. After all, it was his idea.
He braced himself, not entirely sure what it was going to feel like. His stomach flipped as the ride swooped down, then the next thing he knew, he was in the air. Dean was screaming in euphoria, having the time of his life. Cas had his eyes shut tight, not ready to see the world from this new perspective, but it felt like he was flying. Dean was holding his hand, and he was at the top of the world, soaring.
“Well, Cas said you had kind of a rough night and he thought we’d make you a nice hearty breakfast to get you back in the game.” Sam shoveled sausage from the frying pan onto a plate in the center of the table. “Oh! We found a potential case in Colorado. It looks like a pack of werewolves. It might be worth checking out.”
“Cas, I’m so sorry. Sam….” He sobbed, near exhaustion, throat swelled and vision blurred. He couldn’t stay. He couldn't bear the weight of this anymore.
Dean looked at her with wide eyes. Spin the bottle? Really? Out of all the dumb ideas Charlie could’ve come up with, she picked the option where his mouth could potentially be on the mouth of his best friend? Even more awkward, he could end up kissing one of his coworkers, and that could lead to some uncomfortable shifts in the future.
“No, it’s fine.” Cas walked over, his back to Dean as he looked at the message. “From what my family says, heaven doesn’t want me anyway, so yeah,” Cas lifted his drink to toast in agreement, “screw heaven!”
Anael was like some magical healing elf. No matter what Dean was going through, a quick chat with her would turn it all around.
Dean sat back on his heels, trying to catch his breath as Cas stood up. He was covered in mud and leaves, he was damp, and the sleeve of his jacket was singed.
“Yes, really. You didn’t answer me for the whole day. I didn’t know if you were ok or if something happened to you, and then I found out that you were hanging with your new friends?” Cas looked down, fidgeting with the lip of the cup. In a quiet voice he continued, “It hurt.”
Charlie looked at Dean, a glimmer of mischief in her eyes. “What if there was a way where you could explore that side of yourself without it being a big deal?”
When they kissed, and the were finally announced husband and husband, it was almost as if they became one. Their love identical and mirrored in the moment.
“After sleeping on it, I decided that I can suffer for 4 minutes if it might bring you back to me, so, here we go. If you don’t, I’ll understand, but deep down, I’m gonna be pissed because I knocked “Renegade” by Styx off the list for this.”
They waited it out until the announcement was made that visiting hours were over. They packed up their things, and headed back home, disappointed. It wasn’t a guarantee that he would wake up, it was an estimate, but damn it, Dean wanted it to be correct. They all did.
As he scrolled through Instagram, he saw a picture Cas took of some fancy breakfast from the bistro downtown. The caption read “Quality time with me, myself and I. #ICanDoBadAllByMyself”
“Look, buddy. I appreciate that you care so much. That’s a good trait to have, but not everything needs a therapy session.”
His heart was so full, he nearly collapsed when Dean finally found him. He knew what Dean wanted to say, but Cas was fearful of what that would mean for him, so he said it was ok. He heard what he needed to hear.
“I was stupid. I took things too far and it got out of hand. I never meant for something like this to happen.”
Sam and Cas were checking out a possible case just outside of town, so Dean had the bunker to himself. He was glad, because he didn’t want anyone else to witness the horror he was experiencing. As he gripped the edge of the toilet bowl, he was never happier that Sam always kept things clean.
Dean didn’t mind the taste of alcohol, but then again he’d probably drank a lot more of it than Cas had in his lifetime.
Cas nods. “For what it’s worth, I don’t think it’s pointless to keep fighting when everything around you wants you to quit. I think that’s very brave.”
The jukebox in the corner rattled off classic rock as smoke settled around the two men. They ate their wings out of little boat shaped baskets and shared tidbits about themselves.
Sam didn’t want to wake them, so he just smiled, and set the grocery bag of Tums and Pepto on the night side table. He tip-toed out of the room, quietly shutting the door behind him.
Dean looked up and locked eyes with Cas, the nearby fire casting him in its warm glow. Meg was right, he was cute. They stood up to meet each other in the middle of the circle. He was praying Cas couldn’t tell how nervous he was because his breathing was definitely out of whack, and he was sweating.
“Hello to you too,” she said, taken aback by Dean’s bluntness. “She didn’t make any. She said you were bringing the pie.”
Cas had a lot more downtime on his hands since Dean started working full shifts at the movie theater. He tried not to complain because at least Dean got to work the earlier shifts, so they still had plenty of time after work to hang out, but that meant Cas had a void to fill.
“Well, I didn’t believe in riding the pendulum of doom either, but today is a day for trying new things.”
“Now I’m gonna tell you right now, son,” Bobby said, standing up and pushing his chair in, “I tried my hardest with this. It ain’t pretty, but you know what, I figured you’d like it anyway.”
Dean nodded. This was exactly what he wanted to avoid. To be fair, he didn’t ever think it would get as bad as it did, but then again, when you flirt with death…
And that it was, because Dean spent nearly $40 on pick a duck, the ring toss, water gun races, and the game where you throw darts at the balloons. He was determined every time, but in the end, all he won was a bouncy ball, which he ended up losing after he bounced it too high and it landed on the top of a smoothie hut.
They were nestled under a large comforter, Dean in plaid pajamas, Cas in a borrowed pair of sweatpants. Dean was propped up against the arm rest, Cas’s back pressed against his chest. He ran his fingers through Cas’s hair, basking in the warmth and comfort of the other man’s presence. He leaned down and placed a gentle kiss to Cas’s forehead.
“Listen, you’re the only one who knows I’m bi. I haven’t told Cas, and I don’t think I’m ready for everyone else to know either. Not yet. And I don’t want to risk making things weird between me and Cas.” It wasn’t that Dean had a problem with his sexuality, but he knew that plenty of people in town would. Now wasn’t the right time to come out. Maybe once he got to college and could feel things out, but for now, it seemed better to keep things low key.
“Fine, come here.” Dean said, lifting his blanket so that Cas could lay next to him. There was a smile plastered across Cas’s face. And that alone made Dean feel a little better.
“I think I’m in love with you?” Cas whispered. It came out as more of a question than a statement. As if he was slowly coming to a realization.
“I don’t. I was hoping to take over my Uncle Bobby’s auto shop. He always said I had a gift when it came to cars.”
Cas’s head was still hazy as he rested it upon Dean’s chest. The gentle rise and fall a reminder that, yes, this was real. A beautiful boy asked him to be his boyfriend, and he meant it. It wasn’t a joke, it wasn’t malicious. Dean fell for the person Cas was inside, and he liked him exactly as he was. He never tried to change him. He was always there, ready to share a new adventure.
It was going smooth, until Dean messed up on a report at work. He put some wrong numbers in, threw off the entire thing, and the company had to make up for it. His boss sent him home early. He told him one more screw up like that, and he’d be fired.
He thought it would be sweet to make a mixtape-style playlist to count down the days until his boyfriend would be back. He compiled 21 different songs into a playlist titled “Get Well Soon” to play to Cas each day he visited. Some of them were personal favorites, some of them were guilty pleasures, some of them were songs he knew Cas loved, even though he hated them.
“Next thing I know, my foster mom comes barging into my room, asking for dirty laundry, and she scares the crap out of me. I scream, and jump, and the jar of bees goes flying into the air. It comes crashing down on the floor, the glass shatters, and the bees start swarming all over the room. You would’ve thought I had killed someone with all the screaming.”
“Guys, I have to run to the store and pick up the pie. Please try to be ready by the time I get back. We’re leaving at 3:30pm.” Dean grabbed his keys and headed to the store.
Instead of dwelling on that, Cas chose to focus on the positive. The upside to, and also the best part of, being home was getting to see Dean. They had become best friends their senior year of high school, both finding comfort and support in each other. Cas even opted to go to a state school just so he could still see Dean on the weekends. He had researched the programs, and it was equally as good of a school as the one hundreds of miles away that he wanted to go to, and it was a fraction of the price. It was a win/win.
“You were throwing up your food, Dean. While I’m no expert, I think that might be something you should see a professional about.”
This time Dean could see exactly how Cas was looking at him. Like he was something to behold. Like he was beautiful. He should have been flattered, but the thought of Cas liking him in that way suddenly seemed ridiculous. Cas was probably giving him an honest compliment and whatever subtext may have been there went right over his head.
“Shut your mouth and eat your leaves, salad boy.” Dean shot back, mouth full of ground beef. He knew Sam was joking, but some part of him took it at face value.
They escorted Cas and Dean back to their car, and kindly informed them that they were no longer allowed on the property.
He clicked his phone into place and set the timer for 10 seconds. Dean opened the curtains so they could have natural lighting in the photo. They got in position, and Cas started the timer. After it snapped, Cas pulled it up.
Cas looked down at the text on his phone, perplexed. He hated that Dean randomly chose to send him things with zero explanation.
Cas hadn’t originally intended to run Multiverse Bio Corp., but he was the best person for the job. It worked out for the best though, because he enjoys what he does, and the pay is awesome. He gets to spend the day cultivating new plant species and figuring out ways to use nature to combat pollution and disease. Most importantly, he gets to help people.
He wonders if whatever happens when you leave this life would be as warm and welcoming as his mother’s smile. But knowing his luck, he’d probably be met with endless dark. That’s what he deserves. He doesn’t matter on Earth, so why would he matter anywhere else? He could disappear right now, and it wouldn’t make a difference. What’s the point of trying to stay? Trying to hang on? At least if he’s in the ground, his body will nourish the earth. He’d be good for something.
Dean looked up and Cas was smiling down at him, his light haloing his head in a warm glow. There was something else there. Or maybe Dean was seeing things. He couldn’t tell.
“Fair enough.” Sam stood up, placing his cup in the sink for Cas to wash. “But don’t sell yourself short because you’re scared of what you might lose ... Or of what you might gain.”
“Cas, that’s perfect.” Dean didn’t like to admit it, but when it came to Sam, he was extra sentimental. He’d probably have Cas send him the photo so he could frame it and take it with him to college.
Dean really had been excited, seeing as he hadn’t had a day off to spend with Cas in what felt like forever. And despite the beautiful set up, and all the effort Cas had put into it, his heart sank when he saw all the food laid out on the table.
“So, ‘Screw Heaven,’ huh?” Cas gestured to the graffiti on the back wall. There had been a couple different phrases and pictures spray painted on the walls, but that one caught Cas’s eye.
He knocked on the bathroom door. “Cas, I set out some clothes for you on my bed. I can throw yours in the wash if you want?”
Cas offers him a glass of wine, but Dean politely declines. He never developed a taste for the stuff, but when Cas offers him a beer, he jumps at the offer.  It’s nothing special, but it’s a taste he’s familiar with. It takes him back to simpler times.
He grabbed a ball, wound up, and sent it flying toward the fuzzy clowns, knocking one over. He grabbed the next ball, and did the same thing, knocking over another clown. He did it again, and again, only missing once.
After high school, Dean took a job fixing cars at his uncle’s auto shop. He was damn good at it too. Cas knew if things had been different, if Dean had been dealt a better hand in life, that he would’ve gone on to college and became a huge success. But life wasn’t fair.
Fucking Castiel. Angel of the Lord who gripped him tight, pulled him from the depths of Hell. And for what? This? To watch Dean destroy the world? To be killed.
“What about me?” Dean took a swig of his Jack and coke. He coughed, realizing he poured it way too strong.
Dean doesn’t think twice, making his way onto the bed next to Cas. Usually Dean is the one asking for someone to join him, but this time, it’s his turn to be wrapped up in someone’s arms. It makes him feel small, but not in a way that diminishes him. It’s soothing. It’s safe.
He knew he shouldn’t eat as a way to deal with his emotions, but damn it, he didn’t know what else to do. He scoured the cupboards for junk food, finding very little thanks to their recent shift to healthier foods. He found a container of nutella, microwave popcorn, instant oatmeal, mini marshmallows, and some sugar free pudding cups.
As Dean went to sit up, he could feel the sickness creep back into his stomach. He hopped out of bed and bolted to the bathroom.
Dean turned the page, and it was like the world stopped turning. An unexpected rush of tears pooled in his eyes. He wasn’t prepared for how his heart ached. How he was filled with an insatiable longing. How the pure joy on Cas’s face instantly transported him back to that day at the fair.
All Cas could do was nod, and Dean’s lips were back on his. It was a little awkward, but it was wonderful. Dean cupped his cheek with one hand, the other snaking around the back of his head to pull him closer. Cas could feel him smiling against his lips. There was no doubt in his mind that Dean liked him.
“No. You’ve been through enough today as it is, and I don’t want you here if John’s in one of his moods. It’d probably be best for you to go home.” Dean would be lying if he said it didn’t punch him in the gut to see the look of hurt that washed over Cas’s face.
“Cas, I can’t even begin to describe how much you mean to me, but I’m going to try. I have never known a love like I have with you. When I’m sad, you make me smile. When I have good news, you’re always excited to hear it. When times are tough, I know I can depend on you. With you, it’s easy. It’s as if we’ve known each other, in another universe, at another time, and that’s probably true, because as I’m standing here, looking in your eyes, I can’t imagine a universe where you don’t love me, and I don’t love you.”
“No. It looks really good.” Dean realized he was staring and jolted himself back into reality. “We have to put some aloe vera on that arm. It’ll help with the irritation.”
“I told you there was nothing to be scared of. I’m so proud of you.” Dean pulled Cas into a hug, his arms tight around him. Since he was slightly shorter, Cas’s head was buried in Dean’s shoulder, allowing him to take in the faint smell of Old Spice that lingered on Dean’s clothing. Dean’s laugh rumbled through Cas’s body, as he continued to congratulate him. It may have been the best hug he had ever received.
It isn’t long before the credits roll and the TV returns to the main menu. There’s a moment where their eyes meet, but they avert their gaze just as quickly, unsure as to what to say or do next.
Charlie ran over, her phone still recording, and asked in a cheesy game show host voice, “Dean Winchester, you’ve just gotten engaged. Tell me, what do you plan on doing next?”
A train whistle blows in the distance, and a familiar rumble shakes the walls of the building. Four o’clock, right on time. The rumble grows till it feels like a minor earthquake, then it stops. The last group of the day is here.
And that’s when Dean jumps, breaking himself out of his indulgent reverie, startling Cas and himself with the motion.
He didn’t want to think about the worst, but in the event that it did happen, he had something they created together that showed moments from the best summer Dean had ever had.
Dean’s hand found it’s way into Cas’s hair, pulling lightly. Dean wanted so much more. He wanted to live the rest of his life in this moment.
In that moment was everything that Cas had ever daydreamed about. It was everything he wet-dreamed about, except this was real. Dean was holding him close, and kissing him, and all of it was real.
Dean didn’t say anything. He stripped and hopped beneath the cool spray of the water, hoping to drown out reality.
They both looked at each other like they were waiting for the other one to back out, but surely enough, they both leaned in and they kissed. It was just a quick peck, but everyone cheered and whooped.
Cas was always so considerate. Dean didn’t deserve him, he really didn’t. He didn’t deserve his comfort, or his love.
Inside the room, Dean lay curled up on his bed. The room cast in darkness and dust. He couldn’t bring his muscles to lift his body. The inside of his head turned into an echo chamber of negative thoughts.
If you listened closely, you could hear Dean’s heart strings snap. Those were the words he dreaded the most. He didn’t know what else to do, so he just let it pour out of him.
To be honest, Dean hadn’t really thought about it since he was a kid. Outside of the consistent desire to be a cowboy, Dean would have to guess he wanted to be someone who built things. He’d build all types of houses out of Legos as a kid, and one Christmas, Uncle Bobby got him one of the big Lego sets so Dean could build the Batmobile. It’s probably the best Christmas present he’s ever gotten.
“Dean, open the door.” Sam had been knocking every hour or so, hoping he could stir his brother from his room, which he barricaded himself in. The hallway remained silent; there was no creaking of floorboards, no rusted squeak of bedsprings to signal movement. Just silence.
“I want to show you something.” Cas grabs Dean’s hand and leads him to a room down the hall. He opens the door, and turns on the lights.
“Not the point. The point is, this was supposed to be Dean and Cas take on the world, living free, no cares in the world, just getting to live a little before we get thrown right back into another four years of formal education.”
“I’ll be there in a sec. I’m just gonna wash up.” Dean said as he quickly made his way to the bathroom.
“No one cares if I’m here or not.” The tone of Dean’s voice changes. It’s raw and vulnerable, like he just let out a secret he’s been holding for years. Like those words mean more than he’s letting on. The shell he’s built up around himself cracks just enough that someone might be able to slip in.
He was pulled out of his reverie by Dean asking if he’d like to dance. No wasn’t an option. Dean fed some change into the jukebox and put on a slow, romantic tune. He could tell some of the patrons would’ve preferred something more upbeat, but Dean didn’t seem to care. He was on a mission.
Dean started drinking diet soda and zero calorie sports drinks, after an offhand comment Cas had made. Sam gave him shit for it, but being the health nut he was, he supported the change.
Dean picked up the slack. He kept the house clean, did laundry, cooked dinner, made sure Sam caught the bus in the morning. It was a thankless job, but Dean would do whatever it took to make sure Sam had a good life.
Sam placed his hand on Cas’s blanket-clad shoulder. He knew Cas just needed some time, and as long as there were no leads to go on, he might as well let him take it. He loved his brother more than anything in this world, and he knew Cas loved him too.
Dean’s body was numb, unaware of the tears he had been crying. He didn’t want to be here. He didn’t deserve to be here. Why was he still alive when none of the others were? What made him so special? He didn’t deserve any of it. He ruined everything good. Everything. Gone.
Falling in love, over and over, with the same person, Dean thought, that’s the kind of misfortune some people only dream about. He just had to hang on, day by day, piece by piece, until the healing was done. Perhaps it never would be, but as long as Dean had a home within some fractured corner of Cas’s mind, he could learn to live with the wounds.
“Now, Sam should be back soon with something that’ll make you feel better.” Cas said, fluffing the pillows behind Dean and tucking his blanket under his legs.  “I can’t believe we didn’t have anything in the bunker.”
The morning went on easy. Once they finished eating, Cas cleared the table and started to wash the dishes.
There were what felt like a thousand feelings bombarding him in that moment. He was trying to remember words. Nothing was coming out of his mouth, and Cas was looking at him expectantly.
It was sometime in the late afternoon when Cas showed up to the hospital. He really came right over after work. When he walked in, Dean was sitting in his bed, watching TV. As soon as Dean saw him, a huge smile swept over his face.
They took turns shooting the slightly dented ping-pong ball at the cups. Admittedly, Dean was a lot better than Cas, but they were having a good time. Charlie sunk her first shot and Cas reached for the cup on the table. Dean’s eyes went wide as Cas lifted the cup to his lips. Just in the nick of time, Dean smacked the cup from Cas’s hand. The red plastic hit the ground, sending the fluid splashing over the dusty concrete floor. The ping pong ball bounced pitifully at their feet.
In the afternoon, he went down to the homeless shelter and helped serve meals. They weren’t a large town, by any means, so Cas was always shocked by the amount of people he ended up serving in a day. There were people there from all walks of life, but his favorite person by far was this sweet woman named Missouri. No matter what her circumstances were, she would always greet Cas with a smile, and a daily inspirational quote.
He already knew where he was headed. Up the stairs and straight into the bathroom. He was so full, the toothbrush barely touched the back of his tongue before he was throwing up.
Cas smiles and shows Dean how to change the channels and adjust the volume. How to get the TV to switch to hologram mode and virtual reality mode. It’s super advanced technology.
Cas and Sam both knew how it felt to be possessed. To watch your body do things you have no control over. To hurt innocent people. To hurt the ones you love. They wanted Michael stopped before he did the unthinkable, and Dean back before…
“Okay, so first up,” Dean turned the page, “we have the mini golf moat fiasco. I was so mad at you when you took that picture, but honestly, it’s pretty funny now. We didn’t even get to finish the game, and since they banned us from the property, there’s a good chance that we never will. Guess we’ll have to find a new course.”
“It was your idea, so have at it.” Dean slouched in his chair, overly defensive considering the situation, but in all fairness, he was terrified. He didn’t want to admit that he had a crush on Cas. He preferred to think of what they had as a strong connection. A more profound bond, if you will, than he had with his other friends. They were close. And maybe, somewhere deep down, he’d like to be closer, but that was unexplored terrain. Cas was one of the best things that ever happened to him, and what if all of that got ruined? Hell, he didn’t even know what Cas’s sexual orientation was. They never had the discussion. This was a bad idea.
“Whoa there buddy, you might actually want to chew the food. Your body is going to have a hard enough time trying to break down all the grease and carbs as it is.”
Cas runs his hand along Dean’s arm in an attempt to bring him some comfort. Dean’s throat is tight, and his words come out as if he’s on the verge of crying.
Cas went out to the front of the bunker where Sam was looking up recent Obits in the area. He asked him if he would make a run to the store to get some things to help Dean’s stomach. Sam agreed and headed out
“This one’s weird,” Dean says, watching the patterns shift from blue circles to green waves. He checks the name of it in the app, furrowing his eyebrows at the unrecognizable name. “What’s ‘Windows Media Player?’”
He thought this through carefully. Given, this wasn’t how he thought it would happen. At all. Guns blazing and all that crap he liked to preach, but he never planned for something like this. All he knew is he didn’t want to be a burden anymore. Didn’t want Sam to find some mess. Didn’t want Sam to have to clean up anymore of his mess.
Dean nodded. Cas was so diligent and on the ball. Dean wasn’t sure why Cas chose to marry him, when there were much better suited people out there.
Is it a date? Or is this just dinner and a movie between bros? Did Cas invite him over just to hang out or did he have other motives? They never really discussed it.
“Thank you! I still can’t believe you own so many clothes. Your family must run one hell of a company.”
“Yeah? I figured that would take some convincing seeing as you are not a party hosting type of guy.”
For a moment, the world was on its head, for a moment, nothing mattered except their lips touching, for a moment, Cas swore Dean was kissing him back, but then the moment shattered.
He showed him all the best pizza places, where the movie theater was and the old drive in, the stadium downtown, and the best fishing hole. Dean had a soft spot for the kid, as he knew what it was like to be the new kid in town.
Dean’s body was on auto-pilot the whole drive home. The constant feeling of shame and nausea kept his mind occupied. He almost drove past the house, turning into the driveway at the last second.
“In addition to focusing on the romantic implications of the song, which I mean wholeheartedly by the way, I just want you to know that I am also choosing to focus on that one time you ran a red light on our way back from the store because you were so focused on waiting for the “... bum- AND I!” Which you then continued to sing, with no regard for my well being at all, while I screamed in the passenger's seat.”
And with that, Dean grabbed his toothbrush, and shoved it into his mouth, triggering his body to expel what was in his stomach. He heaved and coughed, it felt terrible, but good. He was purging his body of all the wrong. He was fixing his mistake. This was his control.
Cas meant it. There were literally plates full of bacon set on the table. Dean knew it was supposed to make him feel better. If he was a normal person, it probably would have. But all he saw was the fact that his favorite meal was a stack of sugar-laced carbs, drizzled in syrup, accompanied by pan fried cholesterol and grease.
“But what about our summer of adventure? We already made the list, and if you get a job, we’re not going to have time to do it all.”
He looked down at Cas, and he saw his future. He saw all the possibilities of tomorrow. He saw forever.
“I was told they have some openings for mechanics and engineers on the Sea of Tranquility base. I figured I’d go up there, start at the bottom and try to work my way up to that.”
“Guess I could kill some time.” The pilot heads into the Biodome, leaving Dean to do his mechanic work.
He slipped on a t-shirt and a pair of shorts before ambling over to his father’s room. He raised his fist to knock on the door, but quickly lowered it. It was too damn early to bother John with something as silly as a broken fan. Dean would probably get chewed out. Not worth it. So he splashed some cold water on his face, and headed back into his hot room.
Dean shrugged his shoulders, “I don’t know. Your guess is as good as mine. I know that if I move more than a foot to either side, my stomach is ready to leave my body.”
He turned on the faucet and grabbed his toothbrush. He kneeled down in front of the toilet, lifting the lid. He took a deep breath, knowing this was wrong, but he knew he’d feel so much better afterwards.
“That’s very generous of you, but I don’t think I’m qualified for anything there. Besides, the government is willing to pay everything off, and that’s not something I can just turn down to help weed some plants.”
It goes against every code of ethics, but Cas doesn’t have any other option. He pulls up Dean’s information in their system of visitors and gets both a phone number and an address. He knows he shouldn’t violate someone’s privacy like this, but what if Dean is hurt? He just wants to make sure he’s okay.
They sat down at a little booth and caught each other up on their lives. Dean ordered his typical burger with everything on it and a side of fries. He was hungry, and attacked the plate, barely stopping between bites.
“Blackmail time for sure on this one, pal. Your mom pulled out your baby tapes when I visited her yesterday. I now know that The Little Mermaid is your favorite Disney movie. And I have to say, I’ve never seen anything cuter than toddler Castiel, dressed up in his sisters old Ariel Halloween costume, screaming “Part of Your World” into a hair brush.”
Dean follows suit, getting comfortable. He suspects the mattress is memory foam, his favorite. He looks around the room and notices that it’s very minimal. Different from how the rest of the house is decorated.
It was moments like this that gave Dean hope. Hope that he could get everything back. Hope that Cas would finally come around. And then it happened.
“I’m just resting my eyes. You keep watching,” he said. Then he was snoring. It would’ve been annoying, had Cas not found it so endearing.
“I’ll go wherever you go.” Cas had a smile cemented on his face. Dean couldn’t recall the last time he had seen Cas so happy. Come to think of it, he couldn’t remember the last time
And here he is, sitting at his dining room table, eating this makeshift meal Cas threw together, and he’s not complaining. He’s just slurping up the noodles, and smiling between bites as the corners of his lips lift his freckled cheeks, and he’s looking back at him with those beautiful, indescribable eyes and…
From what they’ve been told, it’s fallout from a huge asteroid crash that happened about 10 years ago. The rocks smashed into each other, broke off into chunks of space debris, fell to Earth, and ever since there’s been an uncontainable gas being released from the water.
That was a good suggestion. Cas opened the camera app and scanned the room for something he could set his phone on. All the surfaces were too short, he wouldn’t be able to get everything in the shot. Then Cas remembered his brother got a selfie stick for Christmas.
And damn it, no, he doesn't want to leave. He wants to stay, and that scares the shit out of him, because if he stays, he risks losing it all. But then Cas looks at him with tears welling up in his eyes.
Dean turned his head, drawing Cas’s focus back to those beautiful green eyes. Those eyes, that were usually so tired, now aglow with joy. To Cas, that was magic. At that moment, it didn’t matter what anyone else in the room thought because he was able to make Dean smile.
With Dean’s lips on his, Cas is dizzy in the head. He had thought about this moment, but the real thing beats any concocted fantasy he might have had. Dean’s mouth is warm and inviting, and he kisses like it’s the air he needs to breathe. Like it frees something in him. Maybe it does.
“I was, we had a half-day today, I told you that. Did you...” Cas shook his head, and looked down at the floor, “You planned on me not being here didn’t you?”
So when Cas asked his parents if he could be put on testosterone, he wasn’t surprised when he was struck down by their wrath. They said they could tolerate the short hair, the button-up shirts, the binders, but this was too much. They didn’t understand why he had to push it. Couldn’t he be happy with the inch they had given him? Why did he have to ask for a mile?
They came across the “Clock A Clown” game booth, where you throw a baseball at the clown dolls and have to knock them over.
“Okay, so I’m thinking the first page should have the start date and then we’ll put the end date in when we’re finished. The next page should be our adventure list and we can put check boxes next to each item and check them off as we go. I also have a bunch of stickers and cutouts that we can decorate the pages with.” Cas was beyond excited about the project. Sadly, he couldn’t say the same about Dean, who looked like Cas was explaining nuclear physics. “Or, you can tape the pictures in to say you helped and I can decorate the book later.”
Cas leaned over, a swirl of blue and brown, floating out of focus. He gently placed his hand on Dean’s cheek, his mouth hovering over Dean’s. Cas was hesitant, wanting to make sure this was ok.
As soon as Cas got home, he uploaded the picture to his computer and printed it out. He didn’t have the scrapbook yet, so he pinned the picture to the cork board over his desk. If this was how day one turned out, he couldn’t wait to see what the rest of the summer had in store.
going to be okay without your brother? I don’t mean to overstep here, but it doesn’t sound like this is something you’re doing because you want to do it.”
It broke Cas’s heart. Even though he didn’t expect his parents to immediately hop on board, a small part of him still hoped they would be supportive. His parents always preached tolerance, acceptance, loving thy neighbor, but he guessed that wasn’t applicable to their children. They told him he needed to put God in his heart and get back on the righteous path, that this was nothing but the devil tempting him, and he knew better than to believe that, but logic and emotions don’t always mix.
Dean headed down the hall to the laundry room. There was still a load sitting in there that no doubt Dean was supposed to have taken care of by now. Good thing he checked because John would wake him up at the crack of dawn to take care of it. He switched the loads over and brought the laundry to his room to fold later.
Armed with nothing but a quirky Youtuber baking tutorial and sheer willpower, Dean whipped up a birthday cake that rivaled the one Bobby made all those years ago. His was also lopsided, the frosting was splotchy, he covered that up with rainbow sprinkles, and it started to cave in, but it tasted good. So good. But hey, on birthdays it’s always the thought that counts, right?
She was a spitfire. She liked to party, and lived a spontaneous life. Which was fine, until she found out she was pregnant with twin boys. She didn’t want the responsibility of raising children, so she left. Chuck didn’t try to stop her. In fact, at first, he saw it as a blessing. He wasn’t chained down to one woman. He was free to play the field.
After that, he was an entirely different person. He was finally the kind of dad that Dean could be proud of.
After Mr. Novak said grace, they all dug into the feast. They served sparkling cider instead of alcohol out of respect for John and because the majority of the group was under 21. There were different conversations here and there, about school, or an old friend, or hobbies. Everyone was getting along splendidly.
“It’s a gift, for you. Just a little something that I thought would boost your spirits.” Cas brought his hand forward, revealing a bouquet of flowers and a construction paper card. “My students asked why I looked so sad today, and I told them that you were sick and that I was worried about you, so they insisted that we all make you a “Get Well Soon” card.”
Cas sat up and turned off the television. “Why does he always have to sacrifice himself like this? Does he not see how important he is to us? I love him. You and Mary, even Jack loves him! Yet he’s so quick to leave us all behind.”
As the warm water sprayed over him, he thought about how he was a fuck up. He should be a better husband. Cas deserved a better husband. Someone he could be intimate with. Someone who could handle their shit. Cas deserved the person he married.
Cas laughed, stepping into the room, and shutting the door behind him. He walked over and sat on the edge of Dean’s bed.
The second Cas touches Dean’s hand, Dean tries to burn the feeling into his brain. Cas’s hands aren’t as calloused as his own, but they’re bigger. They’re gentle as they guide Dean’s thumb to the scanner pad on the remote. After a flash of light, the TV makes its suggestion.
That’s what Dean focused on as he creamed the sugar and butter together. How that moment made him feel so loved and appreciated, and he hoped maybe he could do that for Jack. Dean knew their relationship had been pretty tumultuous from the start, but he had grown to see Jack as a son, and he thought, maybe, somewhere in the depths of his superpowered heart, that Jack felt that way too.
It had been about two weeks, his act had gone unnoticed, and he had lost 4 pounds. It wasn’t much, but it was enough to keep him motivated. He switched his diet to barely 1,000 calories. For breakfast he ate one slice of wheat toast, with peanut butter and sliced banana on top. For lunch he ate baby carrots, celery, and cheese sticks. For dinner he ate chicken breasts and broccoli. It was balanced. It was healthy. It allowed him to keep up appearances without feeling ashamed every time he ate.
“I … um…” He stops, the words ‘I like you’ clog his throat— a cork of repression keeping whatever these new feelings are bottled inside. “I’m sorry about the porn thing,” he says instead. “I didn’t mean to do that, and I feel really bad because that was-”
“She put all her faith in me?” Dean looked through the variety of pies, most of them blueberry and cherry, as responsible people had already bought the apple and pumpkin. “She’ll learn not to do that.”
“He told me I was supposed to be the man of the house. I had to be a father figure to Sammy. I couldn’t…” Dean took another sip of his drink. “I’m not supposed to feel this way, okay? I thought, as I got older, it would go away. It was just some phase or whatever they tell you when you’re a teenager. But it never went away. And now that times have changed and people are more accepting, I thought maybe I could convince myself to be honest about everything, but I can’t. John’s voice is still in the back of my head. The fear he put in my heart is still there.”
It was probably the alcohol, but Cas felt like he’d known this man for a long time. He inhaled the scent of sandalwood cologne as Dean slid his hand to the small of his back. They both felt like they were dreaming. It was a warm-glow, bliss-filled, slice of heaven in this dingy bar.
Cas went shopping, and despite Dean’s requests for only healthy food, he brought home cupcakes and ice cream. Now, Dean could’ve binged on the lettuce and tomatoes Cas bought as well, but once he laid eyes on the sweets, his mind said “We have to get rid of it. We have to eat all of it now.”
“Yes, Sam. One second.” He begrudgingly grabbed a blanket from the basket he brought in earlier and opened the door. He shoved the blanket into Sam’s arms, “Here you go. Goodnight.”
It was John. If there was one thing he couldn’t stand it was either of his boys wasting their time. It was summer, but that didn’t mean it was going to be a vacation.
Sam kept busy, making calls. There was a possible lead a couple cities over and he decided to take a day trip and investigate. The bunker was quiet. The absence of its usual occupants painfully obvious.
Cas was looking at Dean like the universe existed within his eyes. Dean had never been looked at like that. Like he was something precious. Like he was more than damaged goods dragged back from hell.
“Okay, well the real you is a ripped t-shirt from 1975. So for my sake, please wear the shirt that I gave you.”
Sam nodded in agreement. “I’m not saying I like it, but look at the good that came out of it. Lucifer is dead. That’s a huge win. And if we can beat him, we can beat Michael too.”
Despite his feelings of dread, Dean headed into the backyard, which was littered with cups, bags, and plates. If he hurried, he’d be able to get it done before John got home. He grabbed a trash bag and filled it as quickly as possible, he folded all the chairs and stored them back in the garage, then he grabbed the leftover pizza and put that in the fridge. Hopefully that would suffice as dinner, because Dean didn’t cook.
“I’m really missing you today. It’s the anniversary of my mom’s death. I wish more than anything that you were here.” Dean tried his best not to cry. “She loved this song, or at least that’s what Dad says. And I’ve told you before, but I want to tell you every day, that I love you. You make my life brighter. You’re the sunlight.”
John explained that while it wouldn’t be his first choice, because Dean’s life would be slightly more difficult, he was still his son, and as long as he was happy, healthy, and staying out of trouble, he supported him.
“What? What is it? What?” Dean asked, frantically grabbing a pillow and raising it over his head, prepared to swing.
A few moments later the ride began to move. It was gradual. Back and forth, building momentum. Cas was okay with that part. Then the hydraulics kicked in and the ride started going higher. Cas became aware that the floor had dropped out beneath them and he was hanging in the air. He was starting to panic.
"If you're not doing anything, maybe you could come back to my apartment? It’s not much, but I have beer and I make a pretty good spaghetti bolognese.”
Once the ride got to the top, Dean understood why Cas liked it so much. The view was breathtaking, and with the sun just starting to set, it was romantic as hell.
Cas pressed his tongue passed the other man’s lips, deepening the kiss. He had waited so long of this moment.
After a couple hours, Cas finally came home. Dean tried to play off his sickness by fake taking a nap.
“That was a good one, Cas.” Dean looked at Cas like the two of them were on their own wavelength, the cool kids who were in on a secret that nobody else knew about. Then again, Dean was always like that.
If nothing else, the trip just made Cas more motivated to get better soon, so he could finally get to live with Dean and experience college first hand.
Dean grabbed the first aid kit from the bathroom and headed back. He poured some rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball and rubbed it gently over Cas’s arm.
“Aye, aye, mateys! Can I get ya another round?” The owner and resident bartender, Captain Garth, came over to check on two of his favorite customers. He was sporting a black eyepatch, red bandana, and a curly mustache.
“And what about your happiness? What about your future? What about the people who care about you and want you to have a good life?”
Dean looks around at all the little trinkets Cas has. Personal plants, mosaics, and glass angel figurines. Then he looks up to see the framed photos hanging under a carved wooden sign that reads “Family.”
Cas looked like the sun personified, radiating joy, with a smile wide as an ocean’s horizon. Dean was never more prepared to spend eternity amongst waves. When they said “I do,” Dean’s pulse was racing. You could see his hands shaking in the video, but Cas was there with him, equally as excited and terrified as he was.
Dean took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and leaned in. He barely moved forward when there was a knock on the door.
“That we what?” Dean was searching his eyes for some kind of sign that he was reading this correctly. He felt like he had a pretty good idea about where Cas was heading with this, but he wouldn’t know until Cas said something. His heart was ready to burst as he waited for an answer.
After rinsing the dishes, Cas makes a big bowl of popcorn and suggests they watch a movie. Dean is game, as long as there’s extra butter on the popcorn.
Dean woke up to a steady beep echoing in the room. As he opened his eyes, he realized he wasn’t home. He was in the hospital.
Cas puts on his gas mask and grabs one for Dean. He only lives across the street, so they’ll make it there before the lockdown hits. It’s a particularly smoggy night. It looks like a dense fog set in over the town. That’s the downside to whatever the hell this stuff is, it’s in the oceans and rivers and lakes, and all day, it absorbs heat from the sun, then at night, it releases toxins as it cools down.
Dean could see that his response has upset Cas. He didn’t mean to, he just wasn’t big on sharing his feelings. But he couldn’t bare to see the look on Cas’s face any longer.
“If you ever try to tell another soul that I like this song, I will vehemently deny it. But I love how much you love it, and when it comes on in the car, you automatically start smiling like nothing else matters. Plus, it’s hilarious to watch you scream the ending at the top of your lungs like it’ll somehow help you hit the high notes.”
His father didn’t see it that way. He didn’t understand why Cas would be willing to sacrifice his future for some boy, but Dean was so much more than that. He was charming, gifted, kindhearted, and one of the only people that accepted Cas as he was. Dean was a beaming light amidst endless darkness, the rope pulling Cas back to the top of the cliff he was dangling from.
Dean could feel his heart racing, his fist clenched at his side. There was something about seeing Meg kiss Cas that infuriated him. He didn’t know why. Maybe he was being over protective. Maybe he didn’t like the idea of his best friend and a co-worker making out in front of him. Maybe there was only one person in the circle he wanted Cas to kiss.
Cas loosened Dean’s tie, his fingers brushing against Dean’s skin. His touch was hot, but feather light.
“Luck, I guess. It was scary as shit though. Half the room was on fire, but the extinguisher foam got triggered, white crap sprayed all over the place, and the fire was out in under a minute. The clean up might’ve actually been the worst part.”
“Smile for the camera!” Charlie shouted as she zoomed in on their happy faces. She had been recording the whole thing.
He rolled over on his side, pulling the covers over his head, and tried to fall asleep. He hoped the night would be dreamless, because either way, he didn’t want to deal with this.
“Get wrecked, losers!” Charlie shouted, with her finger and her thumb in the shape of an “L” on her forehead. She high fived Dorothy and gave her a quick celebratory kiss as Dean mumbled obscenities under his breath.
“Shh. We’ll talk about it later. Right now, you need to rest.” Cas ran his hand through Dean’s hair, a gentle loving gesture to let him know he was there. “I wanted to be here when you woke up, so I stayed for a couple hours. Unfortunately, I think I’m going to head home now, cause it’s so late, but I’ll be back as soon as I get out of work tomorrow.”
Dean closed his eyes and thought about what he wanted. In the moment before he blew out the candles, he could almost imagine it, a normal life, a happy family, but much like the smoke drifting into the air as Dean opened his eyes, that fantasy was fragile and fleeting.
It was 10 days past the original three week marker and Cas was still in a coma. Dean was too upset to make another playlist, so he would just come in, pull the chair close to Cas’s bed, and hold his hand while some reruns played on the TV. The doctors said it was still possible that Cas could have serious brain damage, or have loss of motor skills, or end up in a vegetative state, but for the time being, he wasn’t getting worse, so they just had to wait and see what happened.
Meg stood up, adjusting her leather jacket. She walked over to the boy, who sat there looking absolutely mortified. “I don’t believe we’ve properly met. I’m Meg.”
Dean showed up bright and early, optimistic, ready for his boyfriend to finally come back. Anael told him not to get his hopes up, but how could he not? What good would doubt do any of them? He was used to disappointment, but this? This was Cas. He didn’t have any other choice but to remain hopeful.
“You begged me to get you the nice shoes because this was your first real dance, with your first real girlfriend, and then you turn right around and lose them.”
As a guest of honor, they had John carve the turkey. Dean almost couldn’t believe it, it felt like a scene from a movie. John finally had some light back in his eyes, Cas was sitting across the table from him, Sam was getting along with Cas’s brothers, Charlie was there to share in the merriment. It was almost too good to be true.
“Same to you, my little lumberjack.” Cas took his pointer finger and booped Dean on the nose. Dean wanted to be disgusted, but honestly, it was cute.
Dean stared at Cas, waiting for something to click, waiting for something more than just casual dinner conversation, but it never came.
It wasn’t until the car ride home that the guilt set in. Dean knew he shouldn’t have eaten all of that food. He knew it was too much, and he didn’t care. He looked down to see his bloated stomach nearly popping the buttons on his shirt. It made him sick.
Cas explains that they’re a hybrid of marigolds from Earth and lemium from Ozinine. The yellow is pure, almost as if the sun was concentrated, but doesn’t burn your eyes while looking at it. He loves the color.
He took a moment to think about what he was doing. He knew better than this. He knew this wasn’t healthy, but then again, neither was eating a full days worth of calories in one sitting. There was never any balance and it was a joke to think Dean would be able to find it. When it came to eating, Dean was always doing something unhealthy, it was just a matter of fluctuating between the two extremes.
Sam was beyond worried. The nephilim was still out on the loose, as was Lucifer. This job was going to be difficult enough as it was for one Winchester, he didn’t want his partner in crime to sit out on this one.
Cas gave the bowl to Dean, who took a hit and handed it back to Garth. Garth inhaled slowly then took the opportunity to blow a huge smoke ring into the air. It floated over Cas’s head for a moment before dispersing into the darkness.
He notices the framed photo on Cas’s bedside table. It’s a woman looking down at a new born baby who has their hand wrapped around her finger. That must be Cas’s mom. She’s beautiful. He can tell where Cas gets his smile from.
Cas grabbed the supplies, and they worked together to get the scrapbook started. Dean ended up enjoying it more than he initially thought he would. Cas gave him free range with the stickers, and let’s just say, nearly all the pages featured pizza and alien heads.
“This is it. Your last day in a coma. Hopefully.” Dean shoved the bundle of helium balloons through the door and set them in the corner. He also made a giant sign that read “Welcome Back!” and hung it on the back of the door.
He asked Cas all types of questions, and genuinely wanted to know the answers. He helped him paint his room yellow because he knew it was Cas’s favorite color and he hoped it would make his home life a little easier. He made him chicken noodle soup when he got sick and brought him ginger ale when his tummy ached. He made sure Cas knew he was important, not only to him, but to the world. Dean made Cas feel like things might just turn out alright after all, and for that, he was grateful.
They cuddled up on the couch, Dean in plaid pajamas, Cas in a borrowed pair of sweatpants, as they watched a movie. Cas must’ve fallen asleep, because the next thing he knew, he was waking up to the smell of what he assumed was pancakes.
“I know it’s sudden and a big change, but the program would help me and Sam out big time. If you move up there to work, they’ll pay off your Earth debts, and I still gotta pay for the house and credit card bills, and all of Sammy’s college loans are in my name. I could give both of us a fresh start by going up there. A clean slate.”
God. This is possibly the worst date Dean has ever been on, and he’s still not sure it even is a date. Why does he have to be such a disaster?
“The fact that I absolutely do like boys, but more importantly, that I like one very special, very cute boy in particular.”
Dean remembered it like it was yesterday. He woke up, ready to go with his dad on a hunt, but Bobby insisted he hang back with him and Sam for the day. Bobby made a cover story about Dean puking his guts out and John didn’t care enough to question it. He probably figured it would be easier to chase a demon without his son slowing him down.
“Too late!” Cas leaned over and snapped a selfie. It was a little blurry, but he was smiling wide, and Dean was serving a serious death glare. It was perfect.
Dean switched his hours around at work so that he could still visit Cas. After the initial shock of what happened wore off, Dean knew he’d need something to keep him occupied during the day. His boss was understanding.
The next morning, Dean woke up to the smell of bacon and eggs. He rolled out of bed, the floor creaking under his feet as he made his way to the kitchen. Sam was cooking something on the stove, and Cas was pouring coffee.
If he didn’t eat anything else all day, he could justify it. This was just one large meal. If nothing else went in, then he wouldn’t have to force anything out. Balance.
“What?” Cas tilted his head up to look at Dean. He couldn’t tell what he was thinking. The silence felt like it lasted forever, but it was probably only a few seconds.
It made Cas feel guilty, because he didn’t really know what he wanted to do with his life, but he had been given all the financial opportunity that someone like Dean could only dream about. Dean always loved fixing things. Cars were the easiest to get his hands on, but he would tear apart all kinds of things and figure out how to put them back together. He’d take scraps and make new things out of them. He even took first place in one of the science fairs for his designs for a wind-powered car. It wouldn’t have worked on the grand scale, but it was still an interesting concept. The point was, Dean was brilliant, and Cas felt lucky to be his friend.
Deciding that his head can fuck right off, Dean reaches over and laces his fingers between Cas’s. It’s barely even a motion, but Dean is petrified. Cas squeezes his hand, and it’s so gentle that Dean almost pulls away. Feels like something he isn’t supposed to have. Isn’t allowed to have. Feels like a pulse of hope that good things might happen for him.
Dean and Garth were laughing, and for a second Cas thought they were making fun of him, but after a quick pat on the back, and some encouragement that “that’ll happen if you’re not used to it,” he realized everyone was just having a good time and making light of the situation.
“I promised you for better or for worse. Rich or poor. In sickness and in health, and I meant it. I’m not gonna stop until I get you back. Until I get my husband back.” Dean let his gaze fall to the ground.
“No thank you, Dean.” Cas turned the water off and dried his hands. “Is there something still bothering you? You seem a little on edge?”
The next morning Dean woke to the smell of chocolate chip pancakes. When he stumbled into the kitchen, he saw Cas cooking.
It had been years, but Dean still couldn’t erase the memory. His dad wasn’t the poster child for A+ parenting, but Dean had come to terms with that. For the most part anyway.
The wind had swept up some embers from the fire and set Cas’s coat ablaze. He was screaming, Dean was screaming, suddenly everyone was screaming. They tossed their drinks on him, but it didn’t help.
“I know this one really isn’t of us, but you really made Sam’s night. If we’re being honest, and I can be since you can’t really say anything back, I fell in love with you a little bit that night. You were so good with Sam, and you know how much he means to me. You two getting along was like a dream come true.”
Right as the Ferris wheel got to the top, the sunset a vibrant mix of purples, pinks, and oranges behind them, Cas leaned in and kissed Dean. Smiling against his boyfriend's lips, Dean snapped the picture. It looked like a Hallmark card.
Dean felt a disgusting warmth spread through his chest, and a smile widen below his blushing cheeks. He had a full blown crush, and he hated it. But whatever, he felt like he was flying so he decided to embrace it.
Saturday rolled around and as dusk cast it’s foggy shadow over the town, Dean was out back, scouring the edge of his backyard for firewood. He bribed Sam to leave him alone for the evening by saying he could also have a friend over.
“Okay, I admit, you have turned me into a sappy romantic. And I know you’re right here and everything, but I miss you. I miss just being able to kiss you whenever I want and I miss us hanging out, and getting to be a boring, average couple.”
“Okay, so before we get into this, I just wanted to let you know that I went to orientation today. The campus is pretty sweet. Saw lots of frat houses on the way in, so we’ll probably have a wide variety of parties to choose from. I saw the building we’ll be living in. Hopefully we get one of the first four floors, because all of those have been redone, but the upper floors look like they haven’t been touched since 1972.”
At first, they danced like two middle schoolers who had to keep enough space between them for Jesus, until Cas got brave and pulled Dean flush against him.
Cas turned around and was met with the smiling face and raised hand of Jack, welcoming him to heaven. Jack explained everything that happened since Cas was taken away, and told him they would need to start work on rebuilding heaven. It was a lot to take in, but he was grateful to see that his sacrifice helped save the world.
“If I didn’t know any better, I’d think you were about to propose to me,” Cas said, blushing as he finished his glass of champagne.
“No, I’m fine. Sorry. Just… thought I felt a bug on my leg,” Dean lied, because that seemed like the best option.
College should’ve been no different. He applied for a couple in-state schools, and a couple out of state as well. He tried to make sure he and Dean applied to most of the same ones, that way they could go to college together.
Cas understood that his mother had his best interests at heart, but come on. He was out doing charity work, not busting a drug smuggling ring. He tried not to complain about it though, because he knew that out of all the mothers he could’ve had, his was one of the best. He just wished she’d let him spread his wings a little. Despite his mother’s request, he pulled out his phone and texted Dean.
Dean also applied at the local grocery store, Swirly’s Ice Cream, and a vape shop. Cas scolded him about how “Puff Daddy’s” was not the kind of place Dean should be working at, it sounded like a strip club, but Dean reminded him that he would work anywhere that was willing to hire him.
“I don’t know.” Cas grabbed Dean’s hand as they continued walking. “As long as I’m with you, I’m happy.”
“I didn’t have enough emotional energy to make you a whole playlist this week. Honestly, I barely had enough energy to get here. I haven’t been sleeping well. But I remember the last song we shared together. You held me in your arms and sang me to sleep. You don’t know what I’d give to hear your voice again.”
“I think I know a way to take your mind off of things.” Cas leaned forward and pressed his lips against Deans.
Cas’s father, Chuck, was a rolling stone kind of man. Didn’t like to stay in one place too long, got bored easily, and always was on the hunt for something more exciting than what he currently had. That’s how he met Michael and Luce’s mother.
“Today is a good day for keeping our hopes up! The doctors say you’re making great progress, and that’s what I like to hear.” Dean was beaming as he sat down next to Cas. “I don’t really think I need to explain this one because, let’s be honest, we both love Brendon Urie, and there’s nothing a little Panic! can’t fix.”
“And what if I did?” Dean turns his eyes away from Cas, a moment of bashfulness that he isn’t used to. It’s not like he’s never flirted before, but there’s something about Cas that makes it difficult. Or makes it better?
Dean’s faint smile fades into a frown. “He had to shut it down. We weren’t getting enough business. I don’t have the proper credentials to do anything else, so. Here I am. Trying to put down roots in a wasteland, and it seems so pointless sometimes.”
Cas was pleased by the sight. Dean seemed happy, and that was all he cared about. He never minded whipping up a decadent meal for the one he loved.
Dean’s little heart melted at the gesture. He went with a rom-com that he knew was also one of Cas’s favorites. They cuddled under the blankets, side by side, Dean with his arm around Cas’s shoulder.
“I could clean you up now, if you want to save time?” Dean asked, playfully spraying Cas with the hose.
“Alright, alright. Enough of the chick-flick moments. We got some monsters to hunt! Where do you want to stop for lunch? I’m buying.”
Sam invited over a sweet girl named Eileen. They met in sign language club, because that is the most Sam place to meet a girl. Dean didn’t even know that club was offered at the school, if he didn’t know any better, he’d guess that Sam was the one who founded it. Either way, Dean liked Eileen, she was smart and seemed nice, and wasn’t afraid to crack a couple jokes. Exactly the kind of person he’d want his brother to end up with.
“You think?” Cas did the puppy dog head tilt, and Dean wasn’t sure if he could handle it. “I would never wear something like this. It’s totally out of my element.”
They shot right back open once he realized that he was pressed up against Dean’s chest, wrapped in his arms, and they both weren’t wearing pants. To make things even more awkward, Cas was pretty sure he could feel something pressed up against his lower back.
The paperwork was filed, and it was accepted last week. Today, though, it becomes official. Dean Winchester is about to start a major new chapter of his life. He didn’t expect to be so nervous, but the voice in the back of his head keeps making him wonder if he made the right choice.
Dean looked into Cas’s eyes, his smile brighter than it’s ever been. He saw the rest of his life standing right in front of him, and there was no place else he’d rather be.
“This moment would make an excellent closing photo for our scrapbook,” Cas said, pulling Dean close to him.
One night, after driving up to Rutherford’s Look Out, Cas and Dean talked about how glad they were that the military base shut down before they turned 18. Cas figured his parents would’ve pushed for him to see what openings they had, in hopes that it would teach him discipline and all that. Dean said his father mentioned the reserves a couple times. Even brought him to speak with a recruiter. John wanted nothing more than for him to become a legacy in the marines, but that was the furthest thing from how Dean envisioned his future. They passed a bottle of cheap vodka back and forth, drinking until the glowing orange in the distance blurred into the night sky.
“You’re cute, Cas,” she said, wiping the red pigment from his face with her thumb before rejoining the circle.
Cas came up to visit Dean once, so he could get a feel for the campus for when he’d eventually attend. It was nice. Close enough where you could visit home if you wanted, far enough away where you get to experience life on your own.
“I just need a refuel, and if you don’t mind, could you check the gears and cables in the back lift? I think they may need to be oiled.”
The hunter made a pleased noise, as the pain in his stomach began to fade. The feeling that replaced it was serene. Dean felt safe.
It would’ve seemed weird, but Dean had lots of little sticky notes around the house. Ones on the light switches that read: “Light: On/Off,” ones on the sink that read: “Water: Left- Hot, Right- Cold.” He just assumed Dean had a very particular way of keeping things organized.
Cas let his eyes close as he wrapped his arms around Dean. It was just like all of Cas’s daydreams. Well, in his daydreams he was the little spoon. But being the big spoon had it’s perks!
Cas pulled the chair in the corner up next to the bed and sat down. There was a moment of silence as Dean looked over the card. The room was still, except for the background murmur of the TV and the chatter down the hall.
There was a pull, but neither of them wanted to make the first move. It was terrifying. It was exciting. Everything Dean had wanted was right in front of him, and all he had to do was lean forward.
So while he still had Dean at the forefront of his life, he had to spend as much time with him as he possibly could.
“Oh! Well, it seems old Captain Garth walked the plank on that one, huh?” He leaned over to Dean and said, “I wish you the best of luck.”
“What do you want to do up there anyway? You know they don’t pay you until you’ve worked up there for a year, right?” Cas is filled with a mix of sadness, anger, and worry. The Moon Colony isn’t as grand of a place as the government likes to make it out to be. Dean would be working odd jobs here and there and he’d essentially be a servant to the state until he had a full year of work experience. The food is rationed. Contact with Earth is limited. It’s a huge adjustment.
Cas looked apprehensively at the offering. He knew it was weed. It wasn’t that he had anything against it, but he had never smoked before. He wasn’t exactly the “let’s get stoned” type. Hell, with the exception of tonight, he had only been drunk two previous times.
Cas laughed. He didn’t know what to make of Dean sometimes. He was a specific brand of reckless that Cas found endearing, but would never understand. If he were in Dean’s shoes, he wouldn't make a decision like that based on someone else’s opinions. He’d probably pull out another sheet of extra large paper and make a pros and cons list.
“What kind of name is Crowley anyway? Were his parents Satan worshipers or something?” Cas asked, as he and Dean made their way to the food hall.
The Moon Colony ship lands on the track, the wind blowing fierce against Dean’s jumpsuit. It looks different up close. Not as intimidating. The metal and pipes gleam in the sun as the exhaust mixes with the tainted Earth air.
So he made his way to the bathroom to atone for his sins. He shut the door, ran the faucet, and grabbed his toothbrush before kneeling down in front of the toilet.
They joked about moving in together once Cas graduated college, but that all seemed like a pipe dream. Then again, Dean said he had been saving up, so there was still hope for that.
As Cas took a sip, the lemon-lime, corn-syrup-laced flavor saturating his taste buds, a girl with red hair ran up behind Dean and put her hands over his eyes.
“The chances of that happening are slim to none. And to your point, the Ferris wheel can tip over or the little carriage thing can break off and send you crashing to your death.”
He notices one of his favorite patrons, Dean Winchester, is part of the group. He’s tall, a little rough around the edges, and has eyes that Cas would love to describe, but he hasn’t found a plant quite that shade of green.
He ate three of the cupcakes, and half a gallon of ice cream. He also fished out some pretzels and dipped them in peanut butter, right out of the jar. He could tell halfway through that he didn’t want to keep going, but his head insisted that he finish all of the food. By the time he finished his rampage through the kitchen, he felt bloated and disgusting.
“Coming from a man who has saved the world on multiple occasions, I’ll take that as a great compliment.”
Dean was looking at Cas like he rose the mountains from the earth, his whole face lit up and enchanted. Cas couldn’t quite figure out why he was being treated so well by someone he barely knew.
“You know, Cas,” Dean started, swallowing the doughy goodness and wrapping his arm around the monkey. “This is some serious rom-com bullshit, I gotta tell you.”
Then he looks at Cas, his eyes a salt water blue and pleading. Cas, who makes his heart feel easy. Makes love seem like something Dean could hold in his hands without it crumbling. Cas, whose arms feel like a summer morning, like a promise that everything is going to be okay. And Dean believes it.
His Monday started off poor. He checked his weight in the morning and he had gained two pounds. Two. He knew he shouldn’t have eaten all that damn food, let alone keep it down. He decided to skip breakfast, figuring the best move would be to cut out the high calorie peanut butter.
At his old school, the kids would tease him for always being extra prepared for tests, showing up with 3 pencils and one of those jumbo erasers. He was the one who always had his homework done, and asked the teacher for extra credit. It was easy to excel in school. There were rules, and order. All he had to do was follow the instructions, and he’d be successful.
“About that. There’s something I need to tell you and I don’t know how you’re going to take it.” Cas set his pretzel down on a napkin and nervously wiped his hands on his pants. He should’ve pre-planned what he was going to say because, in the moment, all he could come up with was a bunch of word jumble. He was sitting across from his best friend, trying to find the best way to say that he doesn’t want to be friends anymore. “Look, we’ve known each other for over a year now, and we’re best friends, and I love spending time with you.”
“Yeah, from your own cup,” Dorothy added. “House rules, dude. We fill the ones on the table with water from the creek out back and just drink our own drinks.”
Dean walks into the room first, and as soon as he does, his eyes light up in awe. Every time Dean comes here, it seems to be more beautiful than the last time. Everywhere you look there are pops of color. Bright reds and pinks, sunshine yellows, deep, rich greens.
“No, this is a two person thing, and it obviously means a lot to you, so grab the stickers and let’s scrap some books.”
As the end credits rolled, Cas gently put the blanket over Dean and cleaned up. He seemed so peaceful, which he seldom was. The nightmares often disrupted his sleep, but in that moment, he was at ease. Comfortable. Unguarded.
“Okay,” Dean shifted awkwardly from one foot to the other, “so I’m getting the silent treatment. That’s cool.”
Sam looked mesmerized by everything from the house, to the food, to the guests, and Dean realized they hadn’t had a big dinner like this, surrounded by friends and family, since before their mom died.
Cas nods, a solemn grimace on his face. “Dad tried for a couple years, but he spiraled. I think her death hit him too hard, and he didn’t know what to do with us, or with himself. When I was about four, he went a little too far off the rails, and I ended up in foster care with Gabe. We didn’t really get to know Michael and Luce until much later. We don’t talk much, but it was nice to have some kind of family, you know?”
“Smell you later, Crowley.” Dean swung his backpack over his shoulder, throwing up a peace sign, as he left his dorm.
“Too bad, I don’t think I’d mind being Mr. Castiel Winchester. It has a nice ring to it, don’t you think?”
Dean helps set the table. He’s still not used to having actual meals like this, regularly, and at an actual dinner table. But he likes it. He likes putting the matching dinner plates on the place mats that he and Cas picked out together. He likes setting out the cutlery, made of actual metal, not plastic. He likes pouring lemonade into actual glasses. It feels like he finally gets to have a piece of a normal life. One where he isn’t the sole provider and backbone of the house, and instead he gets to share it. He gets to be a part of it. Enjoy it, even.
He doesn’t try to suck up to Cas because he’s a high-profile biological engineer. He doesn’t make things up because he thinks that’s what Cas wants to hear. And when Cas talks, or rambles on about something, he feels like Dean listens. Really listens. Takes the time to comprehend the stories, their meaning, to know him for him.
Dean had gotten used to it, but his little brother, Sam, had quite the mouth on him. Dean couldn’t count the number of times Sam had been grounded because of some smart remark, but if anything serious happened, Dean was the one who took the fall. He was the proud owner of many a split lip courtesy of a quick backhand from John Winchester. He was second in command. He was supposed to make sure Sam stayed out of trouble. He knew that.
Cas had kissed a handful of people before this, but they had nothing on Dean. Dean kissed him like he was something precious, something valuable, something to be loved, and he had never felt like that before.
Dean nods, venturing through a side door into the tourist-friendly section of the biodome. It’s his favorite spot, right under the cascading wisteria.
As the party dwindled down, they stayed in their corner, wrapped up in each other. The music played, and the rest of the world faded away. For one night, they got to be happy. For one night, they got to be themselves. Even if the next day it all came crashing down, it wouldn’t matter, because they had each other. It wasn’t what most people would hope for, but it was as close to perfect as either of them had ever known.
“Dean Winchester, are you asking me to be your husband?” Cas asked, the same way he did when Dean asked him to be his boyfriend, only this time with much more disbelief.
“I’ve been thinking. You are probably the exact type of person my mother would have wanted me to end up with. You’re smart, come from a good home with loving parents, you got plans for the future. You’ve made me a better man than I was before I met you.”
“More or less, yes. I would’ve said something sooner but I didn’t even know if you liked boys, let alone me, and you said you were seeing that Angel girl.” Cas stopped, the realization hitting him suddenly. “Oh my god, you’re probably still seeing that Angel girl aren’t you? How could I be so stupid-”
Dean wanted to hate it. He wanted to hate it so much, but he was with his best friend, who was now his boyfriend, and they were having the time of their lives. So he accepted the fact that he was going to be half of one of those sappy romantic couples who kiss in the rain, and kiss after sharing a single strand of spaghetti, but that was ok.
Dean tried to tell himself that John was long gone, and Sam would be there for him no matter what. That people were a lot more open minded now than they were back then. But there wasn’t enough convincing that could erase the terror his father instilled in him.
He felt helpless and alone. Dean was always his strength and his motivation to fight the good fight, but perhaps he had overestimated his importance in Dean’s life. Maybe that’s why it was so easy for Dean to say “Yes.”
Cas picked up one of the cups from the table and peered inside. Sure enough, the water was slightly brown and cloudy. Cas had figured it was another weird house-mixed drink. He scrunched his nose up and set the cup back on the table as Charlie and Dorothy laughed.
“I’m sorry I left without saying anything and I’m sorry I made you worry. I got you these as a sorry-thank-you combo. Because I did have a great time with you.”
In the flash of time they occupy in the grand scheme of life, they plan on focusing on the joy that’s right in front of them, and the wonder yet to come. They were sent spinning, free-falling with a crash landing, into this life, but together, they’ve managed to be a grounding force in a teetering world.
Dean shakes his head. “He um. He died a couple years back. Got blackout drunk and passed out behind a dumpster near his favorite bar. He didn’t have a mask on, and he inhaled too much of the gas and uh… yeah.”
As it got later in the day, Dean wanted to try his luck at some of the carnival games. Cas was against it, as most of them were rigged and the prizes aren’t worth the money you spend to play the game in the first place.
“Thank you.” Cas smiles as Dean shovels the pasta into his mouth. To some it would be seen as rude, but Cas finds it endearing. And also quite the compliment.
He gave him a kiss on the cheek, pulling back with a smile that scrunched his cheeks up into his eyes.
The rational part of his brain was screaming at him that he didn’t have to do this, but he didn’t listen. He braced himself and shoved the toothbrush down his throat, careful to keep his breathing regulated and his head far enough away from the water.
Cas was struck by how elated Dean looked, his hair blowing in the gentle breeze, his freckles brought out by their day spent in the sun, his smile, easy.
Dean wanted to be able to accept the truth about how he was feeling. He knew Cas was a good person. Cas, more than anybody else, could understand what he was going though. He was the first man to lay a hand on him out of love. One of the only men to leave a mark on his body that wasn’t meant to kill a part of him. Ever since Cas raised Dean from perdition, they shared a very profound bond; more profound than Dean was willing to admit.
Dean showed up to the hospital with a plastic bag containing tape, and several paper cutouts that he stayed up all night making.
He definitely heard correctly that time, and happily accepted the invitation. There was no mistaking that Dean was a catch, and Cas felt lucky to be holding the net.
Dean knew what Cas meant, but he didn’t want to eat the damn food in the first place. It was Cas, with his stupid adorable face, and his bat-my-eyelashes-to- get-what-I-want demeanor, who chose to feed him. Dean was more than happy to snack on air.
Dean went back to the bathroom and changed. When he came back, he could barely look at Cas. He felt terrible about the situation, even though he didn’t have much control over it. Cas had made it clear that he didn’t feel that way about him, so he could only imagine what he must be thinking. He already fucked up so much in the past couple days, this was truly the icing on the cake. He hoped they could at least still be friends.
She smiled, and Cas smiled back. He never understood how she could stay so positive amidst all of the hardships she was facing. He guessed that was just how she was. She wasn’t the kind of woman to let the world change her, no, she was the kind of woman who was dead set on changing the world.
