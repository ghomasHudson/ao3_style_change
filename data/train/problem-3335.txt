He watched as Castiel’s eyes flitted over his face. He noticed the way that instead of letting him go, setting him right and continuing on his way, Castiel’s arms tightened around him and drew him closer than was anywhere near appropriate for a professional relationship. He also noticed the way that they were now pressed together, chest to chest, their faces barely an inch apart – and as much as Dean wanted to see how far it would go, he was also terrified of losing what they had already.
”Oh, sleeping beauty is awake.” A voice came from the front, followed by a dark chuckle. “Hope you’re comfortable.”
“This seems familiar, doesn’t it Dean?” Cas growled at him, cutting him off. “Except last time, I was the one trapped. Do you remember?”
Cas shook his head, looking down at the table silently.
“Just what, Dean? Cause seriously, the guy’s putting himself through the wringer to try and figure out what he did wrong. And what, it’s just one of your bitch fits?”
“Sammy, I’m home!”
He heard Cas’ sharp intake of breath at that, and noticed the way he stilled. He moved his hands around, cupping Cas’ face and lifting his head to look into his eyes.
They lay there for a long time, enjoying the slight shocks that pulsed through them after. He wriggled his wrists free and wrapped an arm around Dean, using his fingers to gently trace soothing patterns on his back. It took some time before he noticed the wetness on his shoulder, where Dean’s head rested.
His father, despite his extremely strict views and his problems, had always been someone that Dean felt safe with. Yes, John had his issues – big issues since mom died. He probably wasn’t the father he should have been, but Dean reasoned that depression must have gotten to him pretty bad. And yeah, John had some pretty extreme views – but when his Dad WAS home, Dean knew that he could go and sit with him and have a grown up talk, and John would tell him to be a strong man, and that he believed in him, so he would try. So it really wasn’t so bad, right?
“What the hell, Dean?!”
“When I finished sucking you off, I wanted to press you against that tree and take the very best of you, Dean... Make you mine, mark you as mine...”
He bit down on his lip and worried it between his teeth, thinking. Then finally, he unlocked his phone and sent a text before he could change his mind again.
Once his coughing settled, he shifted in the bed, trying to find a more comfortable position. Castiel helped after a few moments, and he managed to sit up more, able to talk and face Castiel properly. Once he was settled again, Castiel sat back in his seat. After a few moments, the man spoke, though his head was down.
“Yes, sir.” He answered quietly, for once not dropping his eyes away.
“And then no kidding, he jumped off the roof in those underpants and that cape, screaming ‘I’m Batman!’”
Dean was silent for a beat, anger raising fast. He stayed silent though, fully aware that a party of children were watching, and their parents were ready to judge his actions. After a few moments of steady breathing, he turned back to Claire.
here, but your head wasn’t.” Dean frowned. “So where were you?”
All the cupboards in the kitchen now had new doors on them, sanded lightly and varnished to bring the grain of the wood out beautifully. The pantry had been fixed, no more curtain to hide its contents, and the new doors matched the kitchen beautifully. Dean had even mounted the TV on the wall, enabling him to recycle the wood from the broken coffee table. He’d used the wood to build a small unit into the wall underneath the tv for Castiel to store his various accessories.
“Breathe, Dean.” Castiel spoke, his voice low and calm again. “Just breathe. You’re here, with me. You’re safe.”
Dean yelled and dropped the hammer that he was using as he let out another string of curses and tucked his left hand under his arm. He heard a bang from the other room, then Sam’s lumbering footsteps down the hall. His door flew open and Sam stood there, looking in to see what had happened.
“More awake.” Dean answered, keeping his voice down. He wasn’t sure if Sam was still in the apartment or not. “I, uh… Never really took that much notice of washing my face before.”
, he was saying, and Bobby nodded an affirmative.
“I know it’s hard work. But you’ve taught me so much. I’m sure there’s something I can do.”
“No.” Dean answered. “I swear, I didn’t Cas. I slipped, and I fell, cause I was stupid.”
“You want to see me jerk off while I suck your cock?”
“Are you hungry?”
“Breathe, Cas. Just breathe. It’s okay, he’s gone.”
“I like to think of those more as... guidelines.” Uriel shot him a feral grin as he pulled the towel off to the side theatrically.
He’d been so afraid that he would hurt Castiel, and in the end, he’d been the one laying in his bed with his heart broken for months until he could function like a normal human being again. It still hadn’t healed, and part of him felt like it never would.
He shook his head with a grimace and downed the rest of his beer, then cracked another one straight away. Sam would kill him if he saw him drinking like this, he thought. He’d managed to stop Dean from becoming a raging alcoholic so far, but here he was, drinking alone to forget about everything.
Bobby caught the look, a frown on his face as he mulled over the words. Then he snorted and shook his head, a grim smile coming over his face.
First came the crushing despair at the idea that maybe Dean thought less of him. Then came anger. No, Dean wasn’t about to get away with yelling and slamming doors that easily. His eyes narrowed as he pushed himself up, following the man.
“I hope you don’t mind my choice.” Castiel told him softly as he held Dean close, his hands resting lightly on his hips. “I have felt like this is ‘our song’ for awhile.”
He glanced to Charlie for support, but she sighed, looking down.
Dean settled in and then, as the morning pressed on, his thoughts returned to his missing notebook.
Dean’s cursing cut off on a moan as Castiel enveloped the cock inside his mouth. His tongue swirled around the head, eliciting a series of short moans before he bobbed down, taking as much of Dean’s shaft into his mouth as he could with his fist wrapped around the base. Dean’s fingers tangled into his hair and pulled slightly, and Castiel moaned deep in his throat. The vibration pleased Dean, if the tremble in his knees was anything to go by, so Castiel moaned again. At the same time his fist tightened, stroking the man’s shaft slow and firm as his glanced up to lock eyes with Dean.
Dean could feel Castiel take his hands and hold them against his chest, he could feel  Castiel’s chest as it slowly rose and fell. His eyes were shut tight, trying to focus all of his energy on the here and now, on breathing with Castiel.
Dean responded by raising his eyebrows.  The hunter patted Jack on the shoulder as he left the kitchen.  Before Dean walked away, Jack called him.
Castiel put his feet on the floor but Dean was already at the door waiting for him.
He was still wearing the green jacket. When Dean thought about looking at Cas's bloody handprint on his shoulder the nausea came again.
Sam knew Dean was destroyed, he heard his brother's screams in the middle of the night calling for Castiel. The power of Dean's screams was so strong, so loud that Sam was startled and twice got up running from the bed towards the older brother's room, but he never got in, he never got close to the door. The screaming stopped before he could take any initiative, but he got close enough to the bedroom door to hear Dean's cry of despair.
They stayed there in silence until the night was fully settled.  They never brought it up again.  Castiel showed his colors to Dean and Dean kept the colors inside him.
“Don't blame yourself, Jack.  It's not your fault, he loved you.  He chose you as a son, any of us would have done the same for you because you are family.  It's hard to forget, but don't blame yourself okay?  Eat candy, fill yourself with crap, be sad, suffer, but suffer without guilt.  He was happy to love you too, to make you a member of the family, ”
Part of him knew that the angel was all right, but part of him, a large part, part of which he was trying to stifle was concerned about him, his best friend ... He sat there for a few minutes.  Long minutes watching Castiel lying still on the bed.  Everything was so quiet that the only thing that could be heard inside that room was the sound of Dean and Castiel's breaths mixed with the beat of quiet music that escaped the angel's headphones.
The green eyes seemed to have lost their vivid color. He didn't remember how he got to the bunker after meeting Sam and Jack, affter…
"Something stronger looks like it would be welcome," Sam replied as he reached into his pocket to touch his cell phone.
I feel so empty, without you here. There's nothing left  for me if you ain't here. Nothing makes sense anymore and its only the #1 day. How can I survive at this. How can i keep myself alive if you're not here?
"Do you think we're going to make it?" he heard Castiel's voice so clear he was even startled. The memory was so vivid that Dean thought he was delirious.
"I don't… you know I don't sleep. I didn't hear you coming, this is kind of weird, really. How long have you been here?
"Dean!"  he spoke almost breathlessly, his voice deep as usual but failing.  He cleared his throat again
Thru his memories Dean winchester remember the days before Castiel die. The memories if those moments are like a comfort to him, Dean who now it's empty it's been trying so hard survive without Cas. He can't even think about the empty world, the only thing Dean think about it's Cas. The look they always shared, the talks. Dean pray to Cas every sigle day keeping the si gle light of his faith, of his hope on the tiny possibility of the angel hear your desperate and prayers of love.
He screamed. The scream had been so powerful that it could be heard by any soul who was miles away from the Bunker, if there were souls in the world. Sam shouted anger, hatred, crying, miss them, sadness and despair; and then when the scream died, his body fell to the floor. There was no more numbness, he felt, he felt everything. Unlike the brother there was no place for emptiness in Sam, he was full to the brim and overflowing.
He said the last sentence taking his eyes off the road and placing them on Castiel. The eyes met. Castiel had a giant regret in his eyes, but those blue eyes like the sky on a summer day hugged Dean.
Hey thank you for read! I know I took so long to release my second chapter and i didn't even finish. Those past months was so crazy. I'll won't promise to bring the PART II next week, but who knows?
"coffee?"  Dean asked, lifting the cup towards his brother.
How many times did he think of telling Castiel everything he felt.  How many times has he secretly loved him.  In a deadly and immortal silence.  Deadly because it killed him.  It shattered it from the inside like a thousand razors slicing it from inside out, and immortal because it never seemed to end.  How many times his eyes loved him sad to know that all he wanted was something he could never have.
Dean opened his eyes that Friday morning, it was an automatic gesture. For five seconds he felt nothing until a weight took over his stomach and even lying down he could feel his stomach drop to his feet.
Cas, –he said
Cas, hi .. The sun is setting and you are not here. I am sitting watching the bright orange sky fade. I'm having a glass of your favorite wine, the expensive one I bought the other day at a liquor store when we, you know ... when we got back from purgatory. Every sip is a memory, Cas! Of you, of us, of what we could have been. What we live for. Of our goodbyes, of our reunions. From our apocalypses. I am an observer. You went away. I watched you go. My cell phone is full of photographic memories. That I've been looking at for the past few days. The sun has already left, there is no moon today and I am watching, it is everything I do, everything I can do. The only thing I have from your left are those memories, biting me like a hundred insects. You left me once again and i dont know if i can't take this… he stopped for a momen to take another sip. The wine bottle is half full. I drink the memories again to keep them alive inside me. The wine is gone. You too ... Dean took a deep breath, drank the wine so fast he didn't even notice. Tears still welling out of those green eyes. I drank the sun, the lack of the moon, I drank you. Your lack. Maybe it's my cue to move on. Maybe not. I do not know yet. Your lack is all I know now, it is all I am now. It's all I feel. I'm scared, I miss you. Deep down, I feel that you are listening to me, but I do not know if it is the echo of the emptiness I carry in me or hope, or really you. I don't know ... Cas, baby! I hope you can hear me, I hope.
"I'm on the Highway to Hell too" Dean said smiling as he opened the door and saw Cas lying on using the shirt, but Castiel didn't listen, he continued with his eyes closed and his arms still over his eyes.  Dean soon realized that Cas was distracted.  It was usually something that never happened.  Castiel never seemed to be distracted or with his head away.  And when in the rare times this happened, when he heard Dean's voice suddenly took him out of the sinking of his thoughts he always got agitated.
It was there in that kitchen that they so often made peace after a disagreement. Leaning on the counter while pouring a glass almost full of whiskey in an attempt to loosen the tight lump in the throat that Sam Winchester cried for the first time after Eileen was erased. He barely felt the hot tear burning down his face, he thought it was the effect of the alcohol. He closed his eyes as the whiskey slid smoothly into his body, it was as if the drink acted like the key to a portal freeing Sam from the prison he was feeling.
"I'll go with you"
There was a scream stuck in his chest. Trapped by the rage that his body could not understand. Waiting for something to break free and echo warm by scratching and releasing the lump in the throat.
Four folding chairs always stayed on the roof of the bunker. Sometimes the four liked to stay up there, almost never to watch the sun go down. Often to have a beer on sleepless, hot summer nights. Sam, for example, liked to go upstairs to read and when Eilleen was home they both went up on the roof to talk, look at the stars and practice sign language. Cas, when Dean had a quiet night of sleep, he used to spend the late nights on the roof listening to music, he was a big Sam Smith fan. He had heard one day on the radio driving home with Jack. The two loved it and started listening whenever they traveled together. Cas listened beyond the car trips with Jack and felt that Sam Smith described some of his most untouchable feelings. He never let Dean know, so when he asked, he always said he was listening to Zep or any classic rock band. Dean didn't like to go to the roof very much, he preferred to stay at Deancave in his spare time, but that afternoon he wanted to go up, felt the need to watch the sun go down and wanted to remember that Tuesday. Maybe the sky was the same color.
Castiel cleared his throat, pulling Dean out of his personal moment of eternity.  The hunter broadened the silly smile that was stuck in the corner of his lips, to a wide smile that left all his teeth on display.  Cas noticed Dean's presence in the same second it took to clear his throat.  He sat on the bed in a hurry and ripped off the earphones then
Castiel had his eyes closed lying on the bed with his arms crossed under his head.  He didn't wear the suit and trenchocoat.  Dean had filled a box with clothes some time ago and left it there for him to use on quiet days and movie nights, the ones when they all got together in the deancave, Sam, Eileen, Jack, Dean and Cas.  Or even just the two of them.  Something that happened very often.  That night, for the last time Cas wore a brown AcDc shirt, sweatpants and socks.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean rubbed the back of his right hand over his face but the tears continued to fall. He heard Sam Winchester scream from the kitchen. He was not frightened, he knew what it was, he knew how his brother must have been feeling, he thought, that if the scream didn't stop he would run. But what could happen at that time. The scream stopped. The sky was dark. Dean closed his eyes and dreamed of Castiel that Tuesday afternoon.
A few moments before he had gone into the next bedroom, which Castiel used to spend the long eternal nights of listening to Dean sleep.  Watching his sleep carefully and when the hunter screamed absorbed in nightmares, the angel would quietly enter the room and calm his turbulent mind by freeing him from those horrible dreams.  Cas did this more often than he would have liked, but he didn't mind, he liked to listen and watch Dean sleeping.  The angel's heart always calmed when he spent a few minutes there in Dean's room watching him sleep.  A peaceful smile always formed on his lips, although he didn't realize it.
He took the cork out of the bottle and took a sip. Creamy. Silky. Vibrant. Dean winchester's eyes spilled as he swallowed the smoothness of that wine. He didn't bother, he let his eyes become a bowl and silently took another sip. This time the flavor changed, there was salt in the middle, the salt of tears, the salt of loneliness, the salt of emptiness. He prayed once again.
"I hope so, fate is coming,Cas ... I feel it. It’s Do or die, but I am glad that we are together in this”
An almost full bottle of white wine rested on the wooden center they had taken up there the second time they were all together. The wine had been there since the two made up, since Dean kneeling in purgatory prayed for Castiel and for one last time the angel was able to hear him. They celebrated, they didn't know what. Reconciliation, for sure, but they did not speak that word, they did not touch on that subject. They knew they had something to celebrate and that was what they did. Dean reached over and picked up the bottle of Chardonney. It was an expensive wine, from the year 2006, creamy, silky and vibrant. Dean knew all about that bottle of wine, it was Castiel's favorite. He knew that the wine was exclusive and awarded, he knew that the wine had been made with grapes from a single vineyard in Agliano Terme. and aged for 20 months in French oak barrels. It was the only drink that Castiel drank with pleasure in his eyes and not for convenience and custom like beers and whiskey.
. Not, of course, that there was anything but friendly instruction in what he was doing.
“No, you won’t. Dean, I had to call your name five times and you didn’t hear me once.” Jody paused, giving Dean a chance to argue. He didn’t, and it seemed to take the wind out of her. “Log out and come with me.” Jody sighed, then she got up and went to her own desk.
Castiel merely hummed in reply, then slowly sat up. He winced slightly as he pulled off Dean, feeling the loss as his cock slipped out of his hole. He shot the man an apologetic smile as he moved off the bed toward the bathroom, it when he returned he had a damp washcloth. He cleaned them both off, then tossed it in the laundry hamper.
Dean stopped, a slight frown coming across his face as he heard Castiel chuckle slightly.
“Alright, here we go.” Missouri was back, and she placed a plate of brownies on the little coffee table. “Dig in, and you can tell me about your day. I see you got that boot on finally.”
“Are you going to press play, Sam?” Jack asked, interrupting their silent conversation.
“I said it’s nothin’!” Dean yelled, standing up quickly. “Fuck, Cas, can’t you just leave shit alone!”
“Please.” Dean nodded. “And Bobby? Can you tell him that I’m sorry... Wait no, that I want to apologise to him. I want him to hear it from me. Please?”
Dean flushed scarlet as he realised what Sam was talking about. Jesus, how much had Sam actually heard?
“Give me a second.”
“One would hope so, since it is my home.”
“Don’t move!” Dean yelled, cutting him off.
Please leave a comment if you liked it! Or even if you didn’t! I appreciate constructive criticism if it helps my writing! (Not if you just don’t like the idea, that’s why we are all different :) )
“Dean, what’s wrong?” Castiel asked later, over the dinner they had ordered in.
“Oh. Oh, god...” Gabriel muttered.
Dean took a few more moments, still indulging in the fact that he could touch Castiel like this, be held by him. He let his head rest lightly on Castiel’s shoulder for a moment before finally lifting it and stepping back slightly, his eyes meeting Castiel’s as he smiled lightly.
Once he got free, he picked up a box that had been sitting on the table before he was attacked, and opened it to reveal several eclairs. Gabriel’s face lit up as he took one from the box and stared at it with awe before taking a ridiculously large mouth full.
“Yep. Figured I’d get a head start, being you like your early nights and all.”
“Hm.”
”Oh, Castiel, what silly notions you have. You won’t be telling anyone, not by the time I’m through with you. You won’t be alive to say a word. But don’t worry, we have plenty of time until then.”
“Dean, there is no shame in having a panic attack. There’s no shame in anxiety or depression, or any other struggle you may be having. A lot of people struggle with these things. It’s okay to struggle, to need help.”
“Dean, this is more than I could have imagined.” Castiel turned to him, wetness stinging at his eyes. “Thank you.”
“Don’t get caught in specifics. Now, tell me, did you kick ass or what?”
“You really wonder why? Listen I get that you’ve been dealt a rough hand... but there’s only so many times you could take it out on Sam. He’s goin through shit too, you know.”
Castiel took a step back, his eyes widening in surprise. Dean himself was floored by the dripping venom in his voice, but he also couldn’t help but notice how the man looked – his eyes were dull, and the deep circles under them matched Dean’s own. He looked… thin, unwell. For a moment, just a moment, Dean let him feel his worry for the man – but he quickly shoved that down, refusing to care again.
He couldn’t even finish the sentence as Dean flicked his tongue over the head at that moment, making his hips jerk up before he could stop it. He tried to pull away, but Dean followed, glaring up at him. Dean’s hand took his and guided it until his fingers were buried in the sandy hair. Understanding flashed and he groaned in response, though hesitant.
Castiel started, then stopped as Dean surged forward and hugged him. Castiel chuckled softly, and Dean felt only a brief hesitation before the man’s arms slipped around him, holding him for a moment. Castiel pulled away too soon, and Dean sat back, then made to wipe the tear away.
“You-Well, you... Nevermind. Your turn.” Dean snapped, handing him the cue a little more forcefully than intended.
“Holy shit.” Dean breathed, a weight lifting off his shoulders as he looked at Cas. “We… won?”
“Alright, moose, settle down.” Crowley’s voice rang out.
“I gotta get out of here. Do my job. But I’ll call back in tomorrow.” He started to walk away, but stopped and glanced back. “You want me to fill your brother in?”
“Morning Charlie.” Dean grumbled, not answering the question as he sipped at the coffee and gave a contented sigh. “Starting soon?”
“Sorry? For what?” Dean looked confused.
“Dean, it’s a car. You don’t have to apologise to it.” Sam groaned from the passenger seat, his head in his hand.
As Dean told his story, he felt his chest tightening again. But Castiel was right there to reach out and hold his hand, gently squeezing in time with his breathing. Dean found himself telling Castiel all about the day – about the choice he’d made, how terrible he had felt. How he was at fault for Amelia dying, when he could have saved her if he had just made a different choice.
“Shit, Dean... Oh god..” Cas muttered as he watched the ecstasy take over.
Dean didn't let Jack finish talking and went back to hug the boy.  He didn't say anything.  He didn't have the courage.  He didn't even dare think about everything Castiel had said two nights ago.  Dean wept silently, tears so quiet that even Chuck wouldn't be able to hear them.
@iprayedtoyoucaseverynight
“Watching you sleep, it's tye most interesting thing that I've seen, and look, I've seen a lot.  Did you know that you speak in your sleep? ”  Dean spoke up from the chair he was sitting on.  His voice was playful.  He had said that to wake up castiel, and take the angel out of time and not look like a crazyman who keeps an eye on the sleep of others.
heeey, thank you for reading again! I appreciate every of you, i swear. It's been a huge week, my laptop broke so I'm writing on my cellphone. I don't know if you notice but I'm building a 30 days of Dean praying to cas, til we got cad back from empty and make them grown old together. So I'll bring these types if memories of Dean with cas to build the story. Thank you so much for reading 💖💖
In that moment, the only thing dean could thought about was Cas. The words he said to him. He touch the mark of Cas's bloody handprint on his jack. At this moment Dean put himself on knees and prayed to Cas.
Nothing has ever hurt so much in castiel as loving Dean.  He knew, he always knew.  The moment he got his hands on Dean in hell he was lost, that was his downfall.  But falling didn't hurt, falling in love with Dean didn't hurt.  What hurt was to love him in secret.  Cas wanted to love Dean in bold letters.  He wanted to fill the bunker with flowers or with those bad beers that Dean likes.  He wanted to take him to fly and watch the stars up close.  He wanted to cook a thousand cherry pies just to see him smile and at the end of the day lie down next to Dean and love him as he deserved to be loved.  But knowing that he could never want to glimpse the mere possibility of that life, killed him.
Hope you can hear me, cas… with love and pain, dean.
But that night was different.  Dean entered on the room.  It was after two in the morning.  It even crossed Dean's mind that Cas was asleep, but he soon dismissed the absurd idea, Castiel never slept.  He didn't have to.  "He's an angel, your idiot" he repeated to himself as he walked slowly around the room to sit on the wooden chair beside the bed.  Dean's thoughts were very troubled by everything that was going on, but the fact that Castiel didn't notice his presence made his mind go blank for a moment in order to focus on a single detail:
Cas immediately rested his hands on the table with the intention of getting up and going to the cabinet to get the whiskey for sam.  Before he could get up completely, Dean touched the angel's hand and motioned for him to remain seated.  Castiel's eyes were tender at that moment of touch.  He sat down, but then looked at Sam who had already taken the drink out of the cupboard and was helping himself.
tears falling down free thru his eyes.
Sam had a pain stuck in his chest. Latent and restless, hidden behind the scream and glued to the cry. Waiting for something that makes sense so that it can show itself and flow through the rest of your body.
tell me please...
i don't know what to say right know, i hope you can listen. I hope more then everything for you to listen. I can't stop thinking about you, about what you said to me. You didn't get me the chance to say it back. H- how c- could… how could you?
He didn't hear Dean arrive, he was absorbed in his thoughts as he let some music play on the headphones.  So much going on, so much to fix, to solve.  The end of the world was literally happening and no solution seemed to work, nothing seemed to be able to solve it.
Before hearing Sam's scream, Dean climbed onto the roof of the Bunker. He wanted to watch the sun go down. When he looked at his watch and saw that the moment was approaching, he cannot help remembering that a few years ago while they were returning to the bunker, Castiel, who was driving the Impala, stopped the car next to a cliff and left without saying a word. It was late summer 2018 on any Tuesday. The sun was setting, Dean liked to watch the stars and had never paid attention to the beauty of the king star leaving, and that moment, my God, that moment was a one-off show. The sun's rays colored the sky in orange and pink tones, the clouds were bluish and scattered, in the space between the cliff and the nothingness the birds sang as if they were happy for that moment.
He doesn't find his brother, he doesn't look right, he feels too exhausted and the bunker looks giant to anyone who's been chained to as many feelings as he is. It's tiring. Once again in the kitchen. The kitchen works as a place of comfort, it is where they keep their drinks, where they smiled so often. The moments of happiness were so rare. Something was always going on. Always someone to save, always a problem to solve. But it was there at that table where they ate on normal days, when Sam made the coffee too weak and Dean always complained. It was where Cas always refused the beer that Dean offered and yet Dean insisted on bringing him one, and he always drank after refusing it. It was there that Sam and Dean found Jack again after he recovered his soul, it was there that Jack crying asked for forgiveness and it was there that he was forgiven.
"Uh, sam?"  "He can't sleep either" the angel said to Dean but without taking his eyes off Sam.
He closed his eyes tightly, but the feeling only got worse and worse. He clenched his fists against his closed eyes so hard he could feel death. And in that moment when he felt that old sensation of death, his stomach came running back to the place where belongs. He got up from the bed running and threw up in the sink.
When Sam facetime her, asking Eileen to come over he was scared.  Afraid to lose her again, and when she refused he get desperate.  They changed the subject, he didn't want to insist, he didn't want to go beyond the limits of Eileen's spaces.  She said she was fine, that she knew how to take care of herself and that was what he clung to with all his strength.  They continued to exchange messages for several late nights.  They suffered because they were apart and couldn't ve able to see each other that much, the cell phone and the messages saved them.
To say the minutes Dean spent sitting there watching Castiel closely, following the movement of his slow, controlled breathing would be impossible.  For Dean, it was like that moment was a little piece of eternity.  He could stay there for days and days and never tire.  How he loved looking at Castiel, silently and discreetly, but he almost never managed to do that without looking weird.  No, that someone was around.
"Incredible," Dean murmured with perplexity in his voice as he approached the edge of the cliff.
Dean didn't know how time it was. How many minutes he interrupt himself in the middle of the pray to cry. Dean was full of despair and hopeless. When he said that he was hoping cas was hearing him, he as begging for hope. He begged cas for hope. Cas was the only hope he ever knew, and now he lose. Dean  didn't got back to the bad. He fell down miserable on the floor where his knees was, and fell asleep again.
“I couldn't sleep, I came to ask you for coffee or something in the kitchen, but I got here and you were snoring.  So, are you coming or are you going to continue sleeping? ”
Sam was awake as usual.  He left the room, the phone was in the pocket of his light blue sweatpants.  Sam walked into the kitchen, his head so full that he couldn't even concentrate on anything, he didn't even notice when he arrived in the kitchen and kept walking.
How many times did he think Cas was different and that, perhaps in a million years, he could feel something too.  The Eternity passed to Dean without he even notice, and how many times he smiled sitting there imagining him and Cas living a life together after all this, a retirement, a normal job.  They would never be normal, he knew.  But with Castiel beside him, he could not even see a future of wars and battles, but a peaceful future.  A future of love.  A normal future.
Sam wincherter walked through the bunker that evening. He opened the door to Jack's room and found the boy asleep. Sam continued walking in the deepest silence, the silence of the world was his and now he carried it.
“Uh, Dean-o - were we planning on getting there alive?” Gabriel called from the back seat of the impala, his knuckles white on the edge of the seat.
“Gabriel...” Cas started again, mildly worried at the idea that his brother, his maybe-boyfriend, and said maybe-boyfriend’s lawyer brother were working together.
He frowned slightly, going back over the questions. He had to have missed something, not understood properly, or something. There’s no way he could be one of the first finished and have done it right. So he pored over the few questions on the quiz, trying to find what he’d left out. As the time wore on, his worry increased. He couldn’t find it. He was going to turn this in to find he was completely wrong, and the professor would see how stupid he was, and probably kick him out.
“Sam? That’s… your brother, correct? You didn’t go to the hospital?” Castiel asked as he looked over the bandage to find where it was pinned.
“Well, shit.” He muttered to himself.
Dean waited a few moments for a response, but when none came, he glanced up to see Sam staring at him with a surprised expression.
A knock came on the door far too early - He was barely finished assembling the dish before he could put it in the oven. He glanced at the clock, wondering if he had been running later than he thought - but no, it was only five o’clock. He wiped his hands off and cautiously approached the door, calling out once he reached it.
Watching Dean’s face, hearing his scream, and feeling Dean clench around him sent him tumbling over the edge after his lover. They moved together, slowing down as they rode out their orgasm until finally, Cas’ body relaxed and flopped down on top of Dean.
“Dude come on. You can cook like a chef in real life but you can’t even chop me the lettuce so I can get this dish finished?!” Sam commented with a grin.
“You?” Dean asked in surprise, but when Castiel shot him a hurt look, he realised he spoke too quickly and amended. “I don’t mean that – I mean, you’re just so calm and together. You’re strong, and you don’t seem like you’d let little stuff get to you.”
Dean shrugged and walked past her to the kitchen, not meeting either of their eyes. Sam held out a cup of freshly brewed coffee for him though, which made him look up and give him a grateful nod. The look on Sam’s face told him he wasn’t about to get out of this easily, and he sighed and turned back around to face Charlie as she started talking again.
Castiel groaned again as Dean’s lips pressed against his again, kissing him ferociously as his hand wrapped around both of their cocks, thumb rubbing precome to slick the way somewhat. It was still rough, painful even, but that was exactly what they both needed right now. Dean groaned as he licked into Castiel’s mouth greedily, his free hand kneading Castiel’s skin on his hip. Castiel, for his part, was moaning with abandon now, his mouth moving away to nip the man’s neck repeatedly, leaving a trial of tiny marks from his neck to his shoulder.
9 - No melee
“Hush, Dean, unless you want to give us away.” Cas groaned in his ear, his grip on the man’s ass tightening until it was almost painful.
“So, um,” Castiel coughed to clear his throat. “You’re early.”
Dean kept laughing, almost to the point of tears as he mashed the PlayStation controller, trying to make the weird little character on the screen go back to where the tomatoes were. He was playing Overcooked with Charlie and Sammy, feeling relaxed and contented from the burgers he had cooked for their dinner and the five beers he’d downed already.
“Man, after that first time... Back at the pool tables... You know, I never thought I could be into a dude like that.” He averted his eyes, a flush spreading across his cheeks as he remembered. “Then I realised, this has been going on longer than I remember. Those things, feelings, that I wanted to experience differently... You were a big part of that. But admitting it to myself, man... There was always a reason, an excuse.”
“We made a mess.” Dean finally spoke quietly, amusement in his voice.
“I quit. What your father said, it made sense. So,” Castiel shrugged slightly, not looking at Dean. “I told management I would either be allowed to make my own decisions or quit. They chose to accept my resignation.”
“Yeah. Known this boy since he was four years old.” Bobby chuckled. “I’m Bobby. And you, I take it, are Castiel Novak.”
“Oh.. Oh, shit...” Castiel gasped as his entire body jerked in response.
Then Cas pushed off the wall and joined Sam and Jack, leaving Dean to quickly turn himself around, flushing furiously as he tried to find a way to the bathroom without revealing the slightly wet mark on the front of his pants.
“I don’t know. Maybe?”
“Michael?”
Dean nodded to her and left, promising briefly to let her know how things worked out. As he left the café he followed the path they had taken what seemed like forever ago, when Castiel had invited him for breakfast. Limping along the path, he let his thoughts drift.
“I apologise, Dean. I should have exercised more caution and control. However, I would prefer not to discuss this any further. May I walk you back to your car?”
Cas hummed around the cock in his mouth, noting that it earned him a soft gasp, before he grabbed the bottle he had dropped earlier. He slicked his fingers quickly, then tossed it aside again. He wanted to have Dean a writhing mess before he gave up on the game.
I really appreciate you guys following along, the kudos and the comments. I love that I’m making something that evokes feelings in others. Fluffy heart and all.
“Now I know you’re buttering me up for something.” Dean commented, but he didn’t refuse when she passed him one of the brownies.
“Perhaps it would have been prudent. But it’s okay, Dean. I understand you may not have thought of it.” Dean glanced up, and Castiel gave him a slight smile. “I wanted to discuss how you are feeling, but I understand this might not be the right place to do that. Would you like to go for a walk instead?”
“He’s... Very excited, I believe.” Cas commented eventually, confusion written all over his face.
Sam and Dean reunite, yet in the happiest moment, everything goes wrong again.
They lapsed into silence as Dean packed his laptop away, lost in thought. Eventually, Castiel broke the silence.
Castiel hadn’t realised until that moment that his breathing was fast and shallow. He tried to listen, but he couldn’t quite get the panic under control. Not until Dean took his hand and laid it on his chest. His other hand covered Castiel’s eyes, forcing him to lose one of his senses so that he could focus on the feel of Dean’s chest rising and falling evenly. Slowly, he matched his breathing to Dean’s and found himself calming down, his breathing and heart rate returning to normal.
“Ah. Well…” Dean glanced at Castiel for a moment. “I’ll have to talk to him about it.”
“Oh, and if you send anyone after us, you’ll regret it.” Dean added with a sadistic grin. “I’ll enjoy making you pay for everything you’ve done, Michael.”
So I don’t really like this chapter, I don’t know why. I think the idea is okay, just maybe the execution is off? If you have any tips feel free to leave them in the comments!
“Okay. I don’t believe we need a written contract – but I do think we need to discuss it verbally.” Castiel told him.
Dean smiled slightly at the answer. The realisation that Castiel had enough foresight to plan things in advance put him at ease, and he relaxed again. Eventually though, he had to extract himself from the bed, which he found much easier the second time around, and visit the bathroom.
“Dean I won’t... I can’t.. Last long, at this pace...” Cas was breathing hard, his cock swelling to an impossible hardness inside Dean as his climax drew nearer.
He appreciated that she would never say anything when he had an episode. She would just sit there, silently supporting him, rubbing his back until he passed out. This time was no different.
Dean stared at her for a few moments, apprehensive. He was also surprised that she remembered that – he’d mentioned it in passing, when he got put into her team and she asked what his goals were. However, Jody tilted her head to the folder, so he glanced down at it again. He read over some of the things in the folder – a description of the training, topics and requirements, things like that – then he glanced back up at her with a pained expression.
“Dean, wait, you haven’t- AH!”
“Yeah. No. I don’t know.” Dean sighed again, frowning. “Just Sam being a dick.”
“I think we’ll leave that conversation there for today. You don’t need to give me an answer now, and I would rather you didn't. I will send you some things to research, and we can go from there. Come.”
Dean frowned slightly, feeling uncertain. It was an odd request, and he had pictured Castiel as the type of person who wouldn’t want to see people outside of work. Regardless the man had asked, so he had to take it at face value, and there were now two options.
“Hit myself with the god damn hammer. Shit!”
“What are you talking about?” Dean paused for a moment, then it clicked. “Whatever’s in here… this is what you’ve been hiding, isn’t it? Is this... I dreamed a conversation between you and Cas, or I thought I did. Was it... real?”
“Fine. Yeah, okay? It has to do with… someone. But it’s not what you’re thinking.” Dean frowned and looked down at his hands. “I can just talk with him, y’know? He’s seen more of my bullshit in the last week than most people have, ever. And he’s still there for some reason. I trust him. And I know it’s dumb, but I… I do. He seems to care and he’s trying to help.”
“CAS!” Dean cried out, his feet finding purchase on the bed, giving him the stability to arch his entire body off the bed.
Dean huffed out a breath, relishing that this wasn’t going to be total lust driven, maddened sex. There was a conversation to be had, first. He forced himself to calm down, head dropping back on the pillow, his fingers tracing idle patterns over the angel’s back.
They got as far as the hallway.
To make matters worse, he’d had a massive argument with a coworker today. A comment about his orientation, that he would usually have let slide, set him off. After yelling at the man for a few minutes, his manager had dragged him to the office and calmly asked him to explain. She calmed his fears of being fired, and explained that she wanted to know what was going on, as that behaviour was very uncharacteristic of him.
The room went quiet for a moment, just enough for him to realise the amount of people that were here. As he glanced around he noticed Bobby, Charlie, Kevin and Sam all in the room - all quickly avoiding his gaze.
Charlie and Sam looked at each other with a slight frown, then turned to Dean. Dean glanced at the woman again, then nodded to them. She had a comforting presence, this stranger, so he didn’t feel in any danger.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
“Actually, I have some work to get to.” Castiel answered, his hand tightening on Dean’s. “But I will be in that apartment there, when they get back.”
Sam and Charlie both stopped talking and looked at him with raised eyebrows.
Welp, this is going in a different direction than I planned.
“Oh my... Shit, Dean, you look...”
“I saw nothing. I’m just here for the free pizza.” Jo spoke in response to Dean’s look.
“As in… You want to order me around?” Dean frowned slightly, confused.
tryin to talk to you? What if he’s trying to make up for what happened? What would you do then?”
They stayed still for several moments until the burn started to fade. Dean was lightly massaging his hips, relaxing him until finally, he started to move. He started with short, shallow thrusts that sent a gentle heat curling through him, until he built up to longer ones, almost lifting off before he sunk back down, impaling himself over and over.
“Only when the pissed off, horny neighbour keeps barging in.” Dean shot back sarcastically.
“Yeah. Yeah, whatever. I’ll need a few drinks but yeah.” Dean answered, then stared down at the bottle in his hands.
He had clicked out of that quickly, though. Crossing that line wasn’t an option for Castiel, and it would only be playing with fire to start getting interested. Still, the idea of a platonic relationship, what Castiel had suggested, was interesting. Whether he was willing to take that leap, that risk, though was another thing.
“Deeean...” He moaned as his hips jerked forward, pressing his cock in and out of the warm heat. “Dean I won’t... last long...”
“It’s not a catch, really; It will beneficial for you-“
He tucked the gun into his belt while hurrying over to her side. Everyone else crowded around her, trying to get a good view of the computer screen. Kevin was animated for a change, glancing at the screen and jotting down notes as Charlie talked.
Dean thought, snuggling himself further back into the warmth of Castiel’s chest against his back. Castiel grumbled quietly in his sleep, but his arm tightened around Dean, pulling him even closer. It made Dean chuckle slightly, wondering how he hadn’t realised Cas would be a cuddler. He glanced over at the clock on the table beside his bed – it showed half past seven, which meant they still had some time to relax.
Castiel lost his composure. His face crumpled, his heart jumped, and he dissolved into tears. Dean pulled him close, cradling him in a warm embrace. He was somewhat aware of the others congratulating him, comforting him, giving him supportive shoulder claps and hugs. But he was mostly aware of Dean, holding him close and safe, whispering soft assurances in his ear.
“-but since it’s your first time, you can break.” Dean finished his sentence, ignoring the comment.
Sam looked wary now, waiting for the shoe. “But...why?”
”Uriel.” Castiel breathed, closing his eyes as he realised the severity of his situation. “What have you done?”
“Shut up.” He muttered quietly, cradling his cup in both hands as he watched Charlie, unmoving.
“If you don’t like them-”
In one dizzying moment, they were suddenly on Dean’s bed, the door closing with a loud slam. Dean took a deep, steadying breath, still yet unaccustomed to the travel. By the time he recovered, Cas had undone his pants and was tugging them down to his thighs.
“Jesus fuck...” Cas panted, his eyes wide with awe as he listened to the man beneath him coming undone.
“Okay then.”
“I’m fi-“ Dean stopped.
Any semblance of reason was abandoned as he threw his door wide open and stomped out of the apartment. He never even stopped to notice that the clock barely read half past six, a full half hour before Dean usually respectfully stopped working. He didn’t stop to think what exactly he was going to do when he confronted the man, running purely off an instinctual need. Somewhere in the back of his mind, he knew exactly what his intent was - but he refused to admit that, just yet.
interesting, Dean noted, was not the words themselves - rather how Sam reacted to them. He watched in interest as a flush spread over the tall man’s cheeks and he mumbled something before turning away to hide his face. He filed the thoughts away for later. That would most definately be coming up in conversation.
“Oh, right. Sorry.” Sam mumbled, averting his eyes again.
All at once, the adrenaline drained from his system, and he leaned back against the door, sliding down until he was sitting on the floor. This last week had been nothing but long shifts with no time to rest properly, and it was starting to catch up. He let his head rest back against the door, closing his eyes - just for a minute.
“Good, cause it’s too late now. Come on, Prince Charming. Cinderella awaits.” Charlie grinned at him as she held the gate open.
“Dean, I want you to do one more thing for me.” Castiel told him after a pause, then hesitated. “…While you drive to work, I want you to think of a safe word.”
“Yes. Yes of course. I’ll send them up.” The manager replied, confusion on his face. “Good day.”
Ellen smiled and nodded as she stepped further back in preparation to leave – but before she left, she wrapped Castiel in a hug and whispered something into his ear. Castiel nodded slightly with a smile, and Dean frowned, wondering what had been said. The thought was wiped from his mind, though, as Castiel took his hand and led him into a slow dance as the first notes of ‘Over the rainbow’ started playing. A soft smile spread across Dean’s face, and he dropped his head down to rest on Castiel’s shoulder.
Castiel cracked an amused grin then, probably the first one Dean had seen, and Dean’s heart melted at the sight.
He nodded slightly, mulling it over in his head. In his peripheral vision, he caught Dean watching him - when he looked up, however, Dean was busy looking elsewhere as he stood and stowed the phone away. He stretched his arms up over his head, and Cas couldn’t help noticing the strip of bare skin that showed as his shirt rode up. The grin Dean shot him moments later confirmed that he’d been caught.
, yes-“
“Yes, I think I would enjoy having some... Fun?” Jack answered with a slight question at the end.
It was awkward, but eventually they managed to make their way to the couch. Officer Singer sat down with Dean still in his arms, pulling the man close and cradling his head on his shoulder like a child. Castiel sat in the single arm chair, watching the two with no less confusion on his face. Dean was more open than Castiel had ever seen him - usually it took force to make him talk about or show his emotions properly.
“I’ll get onto his credit card.” Bobby interrupted, but Charlie was already shaking her head.
Castiel refused to look up. The tone of Dean’s voice told him that his disappointment was evident, and he didn’t really want to face the questioning about it. Dean wasn’t going to accept that, however, and Castiel found fingers on his chin, lifting it so he could search his face. He bit his bottom lip slightly, surprised at how close Dean had gotten.
“Um. Well the rest is more about me... I might have quit, told them to shove their job up their asses, and given your notice too, so you’ve already been paid for the full four months. But!” She held a finger up to stop him, knowing he was about to go on a tirade. “We have new jobs!”
“Are you playing over the rainbow at-” Dean glanced at the clock. “Seven fifteen in the morning?”
“We’ll have you arrested for if you come near this boy again.” Bobby finished Sam’s sentence with a growl, having appeared on Michael’s other side, showing his police badge with a grin.
Turning his attention back to the two men, he watched as they just stared at each other silently. He noticed Dean sway on his feet as his face cracked slightly, a sheen of tears showing in his eyes. The officer spread his arms in an open gesture - and with surprise he watched as Dean collapsed into the Officer’s arms, breaking down.
“No.” Bobby cut in, protectively pulling Dean tighter to his side as he turned away. “You’ve done enough.”
“Would you enjoy that, Dean? If I marked you? Made you mine?”
A little over two hours later, Dean’s initial apprehension had worn off. The drive over had been refreshing - it was nice to leave the bunker without the threat of a case. Castiel had raised conversation as though nothing had happened between them, and he found himself easily slipping back into their comfortable companionship.
A grin curved his lips as he moved toward the tree. The coat moved slightly with the breeze - Castiel wasn’t moving from the spot, obviously taking a rest. It was the perfect ambush, Dean thought as he moved closer. He was almost there, it was almost time. He lifted the gun, finger over the trigger as he reached out, fingertips almost brushing the coat with his plan to grab Cas, pull him out and repay the welts he had left on Dean. Almost-
“You know that you talk weird, right?” Dean felt Charlie laugh softly. He kept his eyes closed, listening to the conversation and feeling guilty for doing so at the same time. “I get you don’t want to hurt him. But you should know, if you do, I’ll kick your ass.”
He spread himself above Dean, loving the way the man writhed against him, how his legs lifted easily to rest over his shoulders. He loved when he got Dean to the point of falling apart like this. He spread more lube on his hand, then took himself in hand, stroking a few times to spread the slick. Dean was whimpering beneath him, the sound sending hot fire through his groin.
“Good boy. You did very good, Dean.”
the man hammering on the door. That was the least of his concern right now, though - he turned to Dean, who was leaning against the wall with a blank, shocked expression.
He found himself repeating the action several more times before he finally turned the water off and dried his face on the towel that hung on the back of the door. He had to admit he did feel slightly better. Not so much calmer, but able to string his thoughts together somewhat. He made his way back to his bedroom, picked up his phone from the bed, and dialed Castiel as he made his way to the kitchen for coffee.
The next morning, Dean felt like he was on edge the whole morning. Sam asked him what was wrong as he cooked up a big breakfast at six am. While Dean might have been a good cook, he was rarely up a minute earlier than he absolutely had to be. And yet, on this Friday morning, he had woken early to cook a meal for himself and Sam, of bacon, eggs, toast, tomatoes and mushrooms.
“I don’t-“ Dean started, but cut off with a moan as Cas sucked a dark bruise into that spot on his neck. “Okay. Sure, yeah. Totally my fault.”
“I love them. Thank- Ow, shit.” Dean sucked in a sharp breath again, this time with pain.
They both fell silent, listening carefully in the quiet. There was no sound of Castiel moving around in the apartment - besides, Dean was sure he would have announced himself. He glanced at Sam momentarily, then they stood as one. Dean felt a shock of fear shoot through him, considering recent events.
Moments later he came back to himself, crouching with his back still pressed against the shower wall. He opened his eyes slowly, shaking slightly and gasping in breaths of air. A hard knocking on the door shocked him out of the moment, followed by a worried voice - Cas, asking if he was alright.
Castiel invites Dean out for breakfast and draws a clear line in their relationship.
“Not nearly enough compensation for what you’ve put him through.” Bobby growled from beside him. “Shut your mouth before I put you in cuffs just for the fun of it.”
– so Dean immediately inserted himself in front of Claire, facing down the woman with his hands raised, palms out, in a placating gesture.
“I’ll get a few things from the first aid kit. Don’t move.”
Okay, well, that made things clearer and somewhat easier, he supposed. Castiel had drawn a line and made sure it was absolutely clear – they were only work acquaintances, not friends. He felt disappointment and relief at the same time, which for some people would be odd. For him it was normal. He had mixed feelings on pretty much everything these days.
Dean pulled on his hands until he followed, realising as they got further away from the hammering and roaring how high his heart rate was, how fast his breathing had become. Obviously the adrenaline had blinded him to his own body’s responses - that was a little concerning.
Dean shook his head with a smile and stood, then offered a hand to the man. Castiel accepted gratefully, and within a few minutes he was out of the elevator, once again laden with his shopping bags. Dean remained in the elevator, and Castiel looked at him questioningly.
Another person joins the rescue effort, bringing a breakthrough. The group head out to find Castiel, racing against time as Castiel’s grip on reality weakens.
Then he just drove, for as long as he could.
“Hm. So, you did exactly as I asked?”
“Look, it’s fine. I’m fine. I gotta go, Charlie.”
“Yeah, yeah, we can’t do this. But we just did. Now sign, and you can be on your merry way.” Gabriel handed over a pen, which Michael took with a murderous glare.
“Wow. And he talks to you about things?” Sam raised his eyebrows in surprise, accepting the offered coffee with a grateful nod.
“Good boy, Dean. You’re so good.”
He glanced down, to find himself staring into mischievous, dancing blue eyes, staring up at him as Cas’ lips stretched around the head of his cock. The angel was circling his tongue around the head of Dean’s cock while sucking gently, and it was driving him insane.
For all the rush, Castiel had expected something serious to go down. What he <em>didn’t</em> expect, however, was for Dean to stand rooted to the spot in shock, staring at the aging, grizzly officer on the other side of the door who was smiling oddly and staring at Dean with - were those tears in his eyes?
Castiel moaned again, his hand tightening and moving faster on Dean’s shaft as he felt it stiffen in his hand. The noises Dean was making were purely pornographic, and he felt the man go still, fingers tightening in Castiel’s hair as the first spurts of Dean’s come shot down his throat.
“Oh, seems it’s not quite big enough. You’ll have to move a bit closer.” Castiel told him innocently, lips curving in a slight smirk.
“Good.” Castiel smiled.
Usually, he’d pull away. No chick flick moments. But this time.. No, this time was different, and he’d changed lately. Right now he welcomed the support - and he noticed the way Sam stiffened in surprise when he leaned against his big-little brother, resting his head sideways on his shoulder.
He sighed with frustration as he dropped the phone on the counter and ran his hands over his face, the previous mood completely gone. As he leaned back against the counter, he felt Castiel settle beside him. Dean finally pulled his hands away from his face and glanced at Castiel with half a smile.
“Oh?” Castiel answered, sitting up straight in the chair with interest. “What has he got in mind? Another game?”
Charlie eventually called off the search, obviously noticing his erratic breathing and the tears streaming from his eyes. She pushed him down into his seat, told him to stay, and left. Five minutes later she was back with a coffee. She sat beside him silently and let him lean on her, his head rested on her shoulder.
He also made it clear that the relationship was to stay platonic. Castiel explained that in these situations, lines could easily blur, and he didn’t feel that would be healthy for Dean. Dean agreed, and they moved on. They moved on to what types of things Dean responded to and needed out of the arrangement – which made Dean flush with embarrassment.
Claire was wary of him throughout the day, but he didn’t mind. He stood back, stayed out of the way and chatted with some of the parents. Nobody got knocked out during the piñata game, and the dozen or so of Claire’s friends seemed to have fun. At least, that was until Dean heard a woman yell, and a boy turn away from Claire with a bloody nose.
“Dean?” He asked quietly.
A grin curved his lips as he ramped his efforts up again, ducking and weaving through the streets in an untraceable pattern that slowly curved back toward the trees. A few times, he thought he may have lost the angel - but a flash of a trench coat, or a glimpse of dark, messy hair, encouraged him on until he was finally crashing into the copse of trees and darting behind a thick trunk to wait.
Cas groaned at his words, grinding his erection down onto the mattress as he gently pressed a single finger into the hunter. Dean whimpered slightly at the uncomfortable intrusion, wriggling around slightly to get accustomed to the feeling. He knew the fingers would feel better soon, however part of him was worried about what was to come.
Dean glanced down at him, searching his face. It was as though he knew the single word held more weight than it’s definition. That Castiel meant stay, tonight but also stay with me. He felt a flicker of doubt, wondering if maybe Dean wasn’t ready for a relationship - Then the man smiled, and Castiel was pulled closer against him.
He felt guilty about taking so much of Dean’s time, but he never said anything. He didn’t want to miss the chance to get to know the man, and with each day that passed he felt them growing closer. It was worth every second, he thought as they took in the fruits of their labour. The walls were painted in a very light shade of blue that seemed to brighten the room by itself. Dean had built shelves and installed them into the walls, staggered to look like steps leading up. Castiel would be able to store most of his books there.
“Um, about that...” She started. “Remember that stuff I got you to sign at the hospital?”
“You look amazing like this.” Dean breathed as Castiel repositioned himself, bracing his hands on Dean’s shoulders.
“I’ll make more coffee.” Sam said as Dean started dialling the first number.
P.S. The counting things you can hear, feel, see, etc in this chapter? It’s a grounding technique that I have found extremely useful myself when spiralling towards a panic attack. If you ever find yourself in that position, use it.
Dean blinked through his tears, breathing hard as he finally stopped. He’d shocked Sam, but he’d shocked himself, too. Hearing all his thoughts come out, put like that, it was just... a lot.
“Who begins the game?”
“...really? You got him to talk?”
“Anytime, Dean. Thank you for letting me help.” Castiel answered sincerely as he took the beads and wrapped them around his wrist. He paused, then tipped his head to the side with a slightly confused expression. “…Cas?”
“Yeah, yeah. Next time though...”
“No.” Castiel took a deep breath, hiding his fear beneath determination.
“Yeah. Bobby tell you about this morning?” Dean asked, then continued when Ellen nodded slightly. “I can’t get him out of my head, ma. I just… what if there is a reason? And a good one?”
“It’s fine, Sam.” Castiel laughed softly, tapping as he waited for the coffee pot to fill. “I’m usually up before two am, so this is a sleep in for me. But anyway, yes Dean is okay. Shaken and confused, I think, maybe feeling guilty. Physically, he’s got a black eye and a split lip, but nothing serious.”
His voice didn’t come out as steady as he’d meant it to, completely changing it from the warning it was meant to be. Instead, Castiel’s name came out as an invitation, Dean's voice breaking to come out in a breathy whisper that made Castiel’s eyes darken slightly. Dean licked his lips nervously, and the movement drew Castiel’s eyes down to his lips.
