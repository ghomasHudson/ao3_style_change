Castiel’s eyes expanded in a questioning gaze. “What do you mean?”
“Dean…”
A shit-eating grin spreads across Sam’s face as he passes the red leather-bound diary over. Dean quickly flips to the back; eyes widening as he carefully reads Castiel’s pinched handwriting.
“I love you Cas.”
“Don’t take too long; I’m not done with you yet.” Dean turns him around and brushes their lips together, before sauntering back into the cabin with a wink. Castiel lets out a low chuckle and faces the lake once more. He breathes in the feeling of calm and security. The feeling of respect and trust. He silently sends thanks to his father before heading back inside. Castiel may have once been an angel, but no amount of grace and heavenly power will ever compare to the warmth and unconditional love provided by the man he could never lose.
As the one year anniversary of Dean’s biggest fuck-up ever arrived, he decided he had enough. He waited until Sam went to bed, then hopped into his car and drove. He drove until he was thousands of miles away from the bunker. He found an abandoned farm on the side of a barren road and pulled in. He walked inside and collapsed to his knees. The burden on his heart was too much to bear. He couldn’t live in a world without Cas. He pulled out a gun he knew Sam wouldn’t miss. He pressed it to his right temple and with one shot, he was gone.
They weren’t
“It’s not...I’m not sick Cas. It’s just....I need you man.”
“I’m ok. I feel extremely tired, but I am slowly losing my grace. It’s to be expected. Thank you again for letting me stay here.”
“Of course I would never do that here,” Cas continued, unfazed by Dean’s panicked state. “Not in this drab diner. No, if I was to propose to you, I would want it to be at a place that’s noteworthy. Somewhere significant. Maybe the abandoned farm where I first meet you. Found you barely hanging onto life. Maybe outside the psychiatric ward; our first unofficial date. The coffee shop would be a worthy spot as well. Remember how we were standing outside in the pouring rain because we couldn’t bear to part?”
“Would you two just fuck already? I’m so sick of you two dancing around each other. It’s ridiculous!” Sam spat, rising to his feet.
He sat under the tree for what felt like hours as the sky drifted from yellow to orange to pink before becoming black. His eyes closed, savoring the moment, as heavy footsteps entered his peaceful environment.
"I…it's…just wait outside. Please.".
“You weren’t complaining about my coat being on the floor last night, seeing as how you were the one to rip it off of me as soon as I came home,” Cas bit back playfully.
“I suppose I can. But I know you’re up to no good Winchester.”
He pushed the negative thoughts away and swung open Castiel’s door. The room was pitch black, with the exception of a faint glow peeking around the mound of blankets that contained the angel.
This is NOT a happy drabble.
“Mmm. You’re so beautiful. Spread out for me to enjoy. I can’t wait to take you apart,” Dean breathed over Castiel’s throbbing cock.
“You were amazing for me baby,” he whispered between tender kisses. “Thank you for letting me do this.”
Castiel rolled his eyes and climbed to his feet.
Dean took his time exploring Castiel's cock with his tongue. He achingly went over every solid inch, Castiel squirming underneath him. Without warning, Dean swallowed down as much of Castiel's cock as he could handle. He brought Castiel to the edge over and over, until Castiel's eyes filled with frustrated tears and he was gasping for breath. Dean popped his mouth off and with two strokes of his hand, Castiel came with a howl.
He’s hopeful, happy, loved, whole.
“We assumed you knew Sammy. We haven't exactly been hiding it. And besides, it's not that big of a deal.”
“I’m ok, Dean. Thank you for asking. Although I would very much enjoy your company.”
“What? I didn’t even ask…”
When Cas wasn’t around, Dean felt lost and empty. Like a part of him had been torn away. It was only when they were together that Dean felt whole. It was in those moments that Dean knew he was meant to spend the rest of his life with Cas.
Castiel’s head hung in shame as Dean’s words cut through him.
Dean stirred and turned to face the former angel, pressing a gentle kiss to his forehead.
------
“Don’t you think you went a little overboard Cas? Sam and I have never been big on birthdays.”
Because of him, life has taken on a new meaning.
“SAMMY!! BREAKFAST!!” Dean shouted from the kitchen.
“What the fuck do you think you’re doing?” Dean’s voice shook with anger, but his eyes were filled with fear.
That’s not to say he regretted those in his past. In fact, he held them in extremely high regard. They were capable of loving him, despite of his flaws. They saw only the good him. They believed in him when no one else would.
Dean locked eyes with Cas and felt all the built up tension melt away. He let out a low chuckle, his eyes crinkling with fondness. “Yeah Cas, I remember. I also remember how you fell on your ass as we were walking to your car,”  he replied, a shit-eating grin spreading across his face.
Oh look! I finally posted another drabble. So life has been really shitty lately so I apologize for taking well over a month to post something new. I know I had said I would post new drabbles weekly, but life is a massive whore so I can't guarantee anything. I apologize profusely.
The current is brimming with bliss.
“That’s not what I meant,” Sam sighed. “I’m honestly really happy for you both. It’s about time you sorted out your feelings and got your shit together. You are meant for one…”
“Dean...please,” Castiel whined. “I need you.”
“TIME FOR PRESENTS!”
Cas pushed past Dean and started the trek back to their suddenly too small apartment. He climbed the stairs where they had first met, eyes locking for just a second as Dean helped his brother move in to the apartment above. He unlocked the front door where Dean had taped up his phone number and where they had shared their first kiss. He walked into the bedroom and stared at the bed, sheets still rumpled from their lovemaking early in the morning. Before it all unraveled. Before Castiel’s fear destroyed everything. Tears built as he quickly packed a bag, intent on staying at his brothers for the night. He didn’t realize he had slid to the floor until the sound of the bedroom door slamming shut jolted him out of his haze.
As Dean rolled onto his side to face his sleeping angel, he knew that no matter what life threw at him, Cas would be there. Cas would love him unconditionally. Cas would never let him go.
If you asked Castiel if he would ever fall for a mortal man, he would pointedly tell you that he wasn't capable of feeling emotion. But he fell for the Righteous Man; in every way. From the day he saved his soul, to the day he became human, his love for Dean only grew. Castiel had been alive for thousands of years, but never met anyone as breathtaking as Dean. He was everything Castiel aspired to be, everything he craved.
Then it was Cassie. The one he let get away; who wouldn't stay.
Cas narrowed his eyes and threw a fry at Dean’s head. “Can I trade you in for a new model? One that isn’t such a douchebag?”
“Dean?”
“Good. Well if you need…” Dean started to reply, before his mind processed what Castiel had said. “Y-you want me to j-join you? Like on your b-bed?”
So when I started writing these, it was simply a way to work through writer's block. But I really enjoy writing about these two idiots. I can't promise to post on a set schedule, but I don't see myself stopping anytime soon. My goal is to post at least once a week, but I can't guarantee that.
A meaning that nothing can erode.
Castiel unraveled himself from his comforter cocoon, a wide, gummy smile spreading across his face. Sam’s laptop was perched on his lap, undoubtedly playing something on Netflix.
“Messy and aggravating, but easy,” Dean replied as he began to strip himself of his clothes, throwing the damp articles on the bedside chair.
“Hello Dean.”
Dean’s fork clanged against his plate and his jaw went slack. He attempted to breathe out a response but he couldn’t form words. A thin trail of sweat made its way down his back and his neck twitched in response. Every instinct was telling him to flee. Yet he remained rooted to his seat; fear causing his hands to shake.
Sam’s jaw hung open, his eyes practically bulging of out their sockets. “You have been together for months now and didn’t bother to tell me?”
Castiel couldn't believe what just happened. Everything that he had done meant nothing. Fighting for him, protecting him, loving him. What a waste of time. Watching him throw it away on some random woman was gut wrenching. He thought things were going to be different. Ever since they sat down and discussed their mutual desire, things had changed. They were open with their emotions. He felt complete. But now there was a deep ache in Castiel's chest. Nothing could alleviate the pain.
Passion flows through his veins.
“I love you too Dean.” Castiel pressed a delicate kiss to Dean’s full lips and pulled him impossibly closer. Dean soon slipped into a deep slumber as Castiel traced his fingers across Dean’s chest; a warm smile spread across his face.
“I’m fine Sam. Dean’s been very helpful; making sure I have everything I could possibly need,” Castiel interjected, gazing at the older hunter with complete adoration.
“Sorry buddy, but you’re stuck with me. And last time I checked, you’re the douchebag. Mister ‘I find it impossible to hang up my trench coat’.”
The taste of once distant dreams plays on his tongue as they slowly come to fruition.
“How was the hunt?”
“What are you laughing about?” Castiel murmured into the other man’s neck.
He had just finished making the most epic breakfast spread ever. It was Sam’s birthday and Dean planned to make this day all about him. Well after Cas talked him into it. Cas had him wrapped around his finger; one warm look and Dean was putty in his hands. As Dean started carting the massive array of food into the war room, Cas was putting up the last of the decorations.
“I’m sorry I didn’t consult you about my sex life,” Dean replied with an eyeroll.
Dean let out a content sigh as Castiel slid on top of him and began to pepper every inch of his body in light, tender kisses. All negative thoughts escaped Dean’s mind as Castiel’s mouth made it’s way to his rapidly filling cock. Castiel's skilled tongue quickly brought Dean to completion. As they tangled their limbs together, Dean let out a low chuckle.
Castiel merely glanced at his boyfriend before slipping into his coat and heading outside. The sun was setting as he walked toward the local park. The ground was wet with melted snow and the sun shimmered over the few remaining specks. He slowly trailed a path towards the large oak tree that Dean had proposed under. He stared up at the barren, twisted branches before sliding down to the ground, ignoring the dampness of the wet grass.
Dean sat back on his heels and took in the view of the disheveled angel. He looked absolutely wrecked. Letting out a sigh of contentment, Dean leaned forward and removed the belt from Castiel's wrists.
------
“Why are you guys up…” Sam stopped mid-sentence, mouth gaping in awe at the sight in front of him. Balloons, streamers, and confetti covered every available surface. One side of the table was overflowing with gifts, the other held Dean’s breakfast feast. Dean and Cas had separated, but remained close.
Castiel's breath hitched as Dean dug his nails into Castiel's tender inner thighs.
“Let me ask you a question,” Cas prodded, carefully placing his napkin back in his lap. “What would you do if I proposed to you right now?’
Dean knew what he had done as soon as the door closed. There was no going back to the way things had been before. He managed to completely fuck up the one good thing he had going for him. Typical. It seemed everything he touched wilted and faded away. He stumbled into the library, missing the chair he had intended to sit in and landing hard on the ground. He went to take another swig of whiskey, only to find the bottle empty. He threw it across the room and watched it shatter into pieces. The tears quickly built in his eyes, blurring his vision. He curled into his side on the cold floor and wept himself to sleep.
Dean closed his eyes and drew in a shallow breath before replying with a faint “no.” Castiel cocked his head; his eyes narrowing as he stared at Dean in confusion.
his mind challenged.
Dean's POV
“Please sir.”
Dean locked eyes with his angel, finding nothing but pure concern and adoration. Those brief seconds gave him the courage to speak what had been haunting him for years.
Alcohol as a coping mechanism/Alcoholism, Depression, Suicide.
“I know this is isn’t really all the romantic or meaningful or whatever, but I mean we do both love cherry pie and you talking about proposing made me want to…” Dean trailed off, a blush deeply coloring his cheeks.
TRIGGER WARNING:
Filled with anger, Dean threw himself on his bed, the tears welling in his eyes. He had tried so hard to get through to Cas. To let him know just how much Dean cares about him, needs him,
“You don’t understand Dean. My family...”
“I know you have issues being
“Will you marry me Dean?”
“Heya Cas.”
“I’m sorry Dean. I don’t know what else to say but I’m sorry.”
“I know,” Cas replied. “But things are different now. You have a home; a place in this world. It’s about time you started participating in “normal” festivities.”
Sure, there were other girls. But they were one time things. Robin, Cassie, Jo, Lisa. They were the ones who mattered. The ones who changed his life. The ones he would never forget. But as he reflected on his past loves, there was one common problem:
“Hey babe, can you stay out here for a minute?”
It started with Robin. The girl he promised to never leave.
Castiel angles his head and captures the corner of Dean’s mouth. “I’ll be in soon,” his voice just above a whisper.
The sound of Castiel’s gravelly voice brought Dean back to the present. He locked eyes with the celestial being he craved. Before he could second guess himself, Dean leaned forward and gently pressed his lips to Castiel’s. The kiss only lasted a few seconds before Dean pulled away, an apology spilling out of his mouth.
“Please what?” Dean commanded.
Last night I dreamed of you. Your gruff voice. Your dark hair and your intense blue eyes. I dreamed of your plush lips and the gummy smile you reserved only for me. I dreamed of your intoxicating smell. Thunder and sunshine; o-zone and honey.
Because of him, the river is resting.
Wow! When I made the decision to post my little stories, I honestly didn't think anyone was going to read them. I am so thankful for every kudos and every hit this receives. Thank you all so much and I hope you enjoy!
“Not that big of a deal? You’ve been smothering me with your sexual tension for years. You know how difficult it was to deal with your incessant staring and unnecessary touching? I was a step away from locking you both in a closet and forcing you to work everything out!”
Destiel with a side of Sammy.
“You have no idea how long I’ve wanted this.”
As always, I hope you enjoy!!
“I just wanted to check on our friend. Although it appears that classification doesn’t fit your relationship anymore.”
"I will love you for all eternity, Dean Winchester. From this lifetime to the next, you will forever be mine."
After Dean and Sam had saved Castiel from Lucifer, Dean had finally worked up the courage to express how he felt. It was not long after they brought Castiel home. The now former angel was sitting in the kitchen watching Dean prepare lunch.
“Dean, Cas is gone.”
A deep blush burned Dean’s cheeks as Castiel’s voice ran it’s course of destruction through his veins. A shiver ran down his spine at the thought of being tied to his bed, Castiel leaning over him breathing dirty promises into his skin...Stop! This is nothing more than two friends meeting up for some beers. Friends being the operative word. Just two friends who can’t seem to stop touching one another and staring deep into each other's eyes. Two completely straight friends. No gay urges here. Just two buddies having a relaxing night.
They ate in relative silence, Sam on one side of the table; Dean and Cas on the other. Cas would occasionally brush his fingertips against Dean’s upper thigh, receiving soft sighs and penetrative stares in return. Sam intently watched them, growing more and more agitated as the meal drew to a close. Dean leaned in to whisper in Cas’s ear, when Sam finally snapped.
The soft moans that Cas elicited mere minutes later was all the confirmation he needed.
“No, but get this. Looks like Cas has a journal of some sort. There’s not much in it. He just writes about all the animals he comes across. Although there’s something about you on the last page.”
Donnie and Dean had their rematch and of course this time Dean didn’t stand a chance, but he didn’t mind. He enjoyed having Donnie as a sex partner way too much to complain about anything; he didn’t care whether Donnie lost or won, as the outcome was very enjoyable for Dean either way. In the evening Donnie even surprised him with his bartender qualities by mixing him a cocktail called ‘slow screw up against the wall.’ The innuendo was of course not lost on Dean, but he just laughed and took it as an invite to, after having enjoyed that delicious mixture of rum, vodka, blue curaçao, different kinds of juice, cane sugar, lime, and lemon, to do just that, screw Donnie slowly up against a wall.
Dean just couldn’t and wouldn’t dare to imagine how his life was going to be like, once Castiel is gone again. And although they lived so far apart and sometimes couldn’t see each other for months, Dean was overwhelmed that they still, every time they met, were spot on with all their familiar sexual cues.
“Yes, Cas? Something you want there?” He asked with a smirk.
“Oh don’t worry, I won’t stop until
Dean still hesitated.
Finally the day they left for Europe came. All their suitcases were already packed safe and sound into the trunk of Sam’s car and the only thing left for Dean and Cas was to check one last time that they really hadn’t forgotten to take anything with them before Sam would drive them to the airport.
The bed sheet was pushed almost completely to the end of the bed and Dean’s shirt had ridden up. Castiel looked at the exposed skin for a few seconds before he let his gaze wander further down to Dean’s shorts, ogling the very obvious bulge that he had already felt pressed against him several minutes ago. Suddenly, a thought crossed his mind, so he very quietly stood up from the bed and sneaked into the bathroom.
Castiel obeyed, and after Dean slid the panties to the side with one hand, he started to pull on the string with the other one to slowly remove the balls, one by one. With each ball that left his body, with each pull on the string, the balls stroked over Castiel’s most sensitive spot, making him moan and beg for release.
He stepped closer to Dean, looked up at him through his long lashes, biting his lips, and asked, “So… what do you want me to do, winner?” and immediately lay his hand down against Dean’s bulge again, stroking it softly through the fabric.
Castiel was a precious gift that was literally sent from heaven to take care of him (and of course his brother). But right now he was just as helpless and powerless as any other human being on earth, worse even he was sick for the very first time in his life! Dean knew of course that Castiel wanted to be strong for him, show him that although he was human now, he still was one hell of a guy who couldn’t be defeated by something as simple as a stomach bug or common cold, but Dean also knew that if Castiel didn’t recuperate properly now, he will only get worse and then all their careful and extensive planning would have been worth for nothing.
Of course this didn’t last long once he and April hooked up, but it still lasted much longer than any of his brothers would have lasted in the same situation. They even made bets how long it would take Cas to finally get his cherry plucked, and of course it was Balthazar who won the bet, as he was the lucky one who won on how long it would take Castiel to lose his Turkish delight.
Donnie, who had closed and locked the door, walked over to the table, bend over it, putting his ass on display in the best way possible, took aim and with one purposeful shot pocketed the eight-ball. “Oh look at that, I accidentally pocketed the eight-ball. I guess that means I lost.” Donnie said in a mock innocent voice, while pouting and keeping his eyes wide.
Castiel gave a short laugh - as if he ever wanted to move anywhere out of Dean’s reach voluntarily. And before he could even finish his laughter Dean was already back on the bed. Back between his legs, the lube coated fingers circling his entrance before quickly pressing one in, while his other hand was loosely wrapped around Castiel’s dick again and he felt Dean putting soft kisses and licks over the whole length of it.
Dean kissed Castiel gently and stroked him through the afterglow, while once more taking in the sight of Castiel’s beautifully blown eyes as Castiel still breathed erratically and with a very seductive smile on his lips.
Dean took another quick appreciative look at Castiel and his imagination immediately started running wild with all kinds of sexy scenarios. Of course he had thought about this, about Castiel wearing the skirt while they were driving; that was actually what Dean had been hoping for.
Dean just smiled and enjoyed having Castiel beside him. He hauled him in, whispered, “You’re just so good to me, Cas. I love you,” and kissed him, or at least he tried to kiss him, but them both smiling made it much more complicated than it should be. When they gave up on their attempt and instead just looked into each other’s eyes, their foreheads pressed together, Castiel whispered, “You said it again, Dean. Does that mean you-“
“So, I take it you like it?”
“Oh Cas, you are really spoiling me here.” Dean breathed against Castiel’s lips as he let his right hand slip inside the pants, wrapped it loosely around his dick and gave it a few strokes before his thumb crested the head of his dick, smearing the precome along the shaft, and then began to stroke him in earnest.
Dean smirked and quickly sealed their lips together, stealing all of the remaining air from Castiel’s lungs. When he finally let Castiel come up for air, he nuzzled at his neck before he moved back down his body again.
Dean let go of Castiel’s cock with a wet plop, took the panties and skirt from on top of his backpack, and while Castiel was still riding the waves of afterglow, Dean slowly dressed him in a pair of royal blue panties and the cheap skirt. Once he was done, he let himself fall down beside Castiel.
“I carried her to one of the look-outs over there,” Castiel pointed into the general direction, “I let her down again and positioned her to lean on the ledge, looking out and into the beautiful night sky, while at the same time I positioned myself behind her.”
Sam couldn’t help but notice Cas’ almost childlike anticipation, not only for his and Dean’s vacation, but also for him flying on an airplane for the very first time in his life. Of course Sam knew that Cas had probably flown more miles in his oh so long-lived life than all the Winchester men summed up driving in the Impala. But still it was downright adorable to see that something as simply as going on an airplane was such a huge reason for joy for Cas – even though Sam had warned him already very early in their planning process that Dean was anything but easy when it came to flying on an airplane.
As it turned out, Castiel’s motel was really just a short ride away; Castiel had used the bus when he had travelled back to the airport earlier that day. They both laughed about the fact that apparently Castiel got even hit on by several guys who were absolutely convinced of him being a very attractive woman.
Castiel looked over his shoulder and into the large mirror he hadn’t noticed before while Dean dragged him into the shower, leaving the shower curtain open just enough so both were visible in the mirror. Dean turned on the water and positioned Castiel right under the warm spray, smirking while running his fingers through his hair. When Castiel’s hair was finally completely tousled, he leaned in for a long kiss, letting his fingers wander down Castiel’s spine down to his ass, giving it a nice firm grip. Cas moaned into Dean’s mouth and started rubbing himself against the taller man.
Dean smiled. “Well, I guess then there’s only one thing left to say: Check please!”
“I know, Dean. But let’s pretend this is just another morning during our vacation and I don’t have to leave you,” Castiel said, kissing Dean’s skin. “Let’s just pretend we are going to stay in this wonderful hotel room,” Castiel moved a little lower, still kissing Dean in-between words, “for as long as we want, and there’s nothing,” a gentle lick over Dean’s nipple, “absolutely nothing,” another lick and a moan from Dean, “that could ever make us leave,” Castiel said, now letting his hand stroke over Dean’s half-hardened cock.
“I just love to taste ever last bit of you, and it doesn’t matter whether it’s the taste of your wonderful mouth,” another short kiss on the lips, “or the taste of your sweet skin,” a soft sucking on the skin beneath Castiel’s ear, “or the wonderful salty taste of your cum,” some loose strokes over Castiel’s cock, “and lastly, I just love the taste whenever I rim you.” Dean said, as his strokes now became firmer while his other hand emphasized his last statement by rubbing gently over Castiel’s hole.
Castiel lay on his back and looked down at Dean, who was currently kissing his inner thighs, forcing his legs apart. Dean’s fingers tickled the softness of Castiel’s balls while also stroking his swelling cock. Dean’s pace was excruciatingly slow, each stroke felt like an eternity to Castiel. He gasped when Dean’s dry fingers began to circle his entrance.
“Dean, I… um… I want to thank you. Thank you for this absolutely amazing and memorable vacation, and I’m not just talking about this out of the world hotel room, which has probably cost you a fortune-“
Dean smiled and brushed once more over Castiel’s prostate with his fingers, eliciting in yet another moaned, “yeeees…. Please don’t stop!” from Castiel.
“Do you have any tissues?” Castiel asked, laughing.
“It… it feels great to touch them, weigh them, pinch them, while fucking her. The feeling of having her lean on the ledge, protruding her soft, peachy ass to me, while I stand behind her, penetrating her sweet, wet pussy, touching her all over... it’s just… aaaah...” another ball was pressed in, as Dean wrapped his hand around Castiel’s cock and now started licking and sucking on it.
Castiel purred into the kiss and started to get slick, wiggling. He started to push his pajama pants off, grinning, "alpha, why was it so sexy seeing you tell him off?"
Castiel stood up slowly and got Adam's plate. "I'll see you at 5 to get measured for the dress for the charity thing," he turned and started out of the kitchen, heading towards Adam's room.
Dean held him close a moment, leaning down to kiss him sweetly. "So... the talk with my father..." he led Castiel to the couch and sat him in his lap, stroking his back and cuddling him under his chin, "he wants you properly acting like an omega at this dinner. I think his expectations are absurd, but if we don't play along he is probably going to do something awful."
Dean turned to Cas when he was almost done. "You know you can talk to me if you want," he frowned, "you're awfully quiet."
Castiel didn't mind waking up at 3 a.m to feed the crying pup. The pup, he had named Jack, was adorable, and just so sweet. After getting to the room that had the pups crib, which he bought the day before, he smiled at him. And carefully the young pup up, and held him to his chest, the cries fading as Jack grunted. And held tight to Castiels night shirt. "Are you hungry?" Castiel asked softly as they got to the kitchen. He then chuckled after Jack babbled a little, then drooled on his shoulder.  As he made a bottle Castiel smiled and said, "I will take that as a yes." If you had told the alpha a week ago, that he would a sudden daddy. He would have called you crazy. But, that is what happened to him.
Dean quickly whipped up grilled cheese and ham sandwiches and found Castiel browsing youtube when he set a plate in front of him. He kissed his cheek, smiling, "Thinking of posting videos?
Sam smiled and said, "I'll help you, Dean." He got up off the couch to go help, ruffling Castiel's hair on the way.
Dean shook his head, "I havent done all that much. Only what he deserves." He looked over at Cas sampling things from the fridge, chuckling at his adorable enthusiasm.
"Sure, Cas," Dean sounded confused but let him slip from his arms. Sam sat on the edge of his bed and smiled
otherwise Cas might have been able to pick up on the sudden spike of his own scent.
Castiel smiled gently, and finally asked, "Alpha, does the blood bond hurt? We've been told terrible stories about that and  it scares me to have a wound like that done to me."
TW for mentions of suicidal ideation
"Perfect." Dean said again, hints of alpha red tinging the rim of the green of his eyes. Now castiel was undeniably his, and it made him want to purr in satisfaction. "Would you like to tour the house and grounds?" Dean finally asked, trying to distract himself to keep himself from just grabbing and kissing the omega.
Dean climbed into bed next to Cas and squeezed in, winding an arm around him. They were lucky Cas was small because Dean took up the twin bed pretty much by himself. "Get some sleep everyone. We'll deal with this shit in the morning," Dean mumbled, shutting off the lamp.
Dean hugged him tight. "I know you like it here. You could...stay, if you'd rather," Dean offered, even though just the thought hurt him.
Castiel listened and felt bad that Adam was all alone here. He liked him already, and wondered why no one else did, "he is an amazing person. What were you playing? Dean said I could explore, just to stay away from John's side of the house."
Dean breathed softly in sleep, still curled around where Cas had been laying as if waiting unconsciously for Cas to climb back into the nest where he was before.
John rubbed his head, "a little. Is Dean getting his work done?" He was always a little more subdued after a night of drinking.
Castiel blushed and nodded, "planning right now. I'm just hoping I don't mess this up. I really don't want to wear any of the dresses for it but Charlie is right, John won't be very happy if I wear some other dress he deems unacceptable. What did they say about Adam? Will he be okay? I asked Dean to send him a gift today."
Sam's eyes widened at just how different Castiel looked in the dress, "you look amazing Cas."
He took a moment to make a comfortable looking nest of the blankets and pillows for him and Dean to cuddle up in. He stepped back to inspect it and smiled. He'd never had a nest before, and for his first try, this one looked pretty good.
He sat on the edge of the desk. "I want him to learn his place by the charity dinner. If he does not, it will be me that teaches him. You will have no say in that matter, Dean."
"Yeah, especially if you have a concussion, you need to stay awake. We're only 5 minutes away, so stay up, Adam, okay?" Sam spoke loudly, speeding up a bit.
Dean curled around his future mate, burying his face in Castiel's neck, taking slow deep breaths and letting his scent lull him to sleep
which had their names and numbers on it.
"No, Cas. You're not bad, or even a bad omega, and Dean loves you just like you are. But the world has certain expectations for a well to do omega mate, and this is it. You must sit on Dean's lap at all times, he will hand feed you but you MUST be neat doing it, and silent unless spoken to, no matter what anyone says. Omegas are there to make alphas look good. Before this, dad would have just rented Dean an omega date, but now it's up to you. Even if Dean or dad asked you to present right there in front of everyone, you'd have to do it. You belong to Dean. You're property and you are below him," Sam sounded almost sick as he quoted all this.
Castiel looked down at his half eaten burger and fries, not feeling that hungry anymore. He had so much on his mind and didn't know what to do about it. Dean said he could talk to him, but he was still unsure what he could say without making Dean angry, or crossing some line he did not yet know was there.
Sam nodded when told about the severity of the injuries, unsurprised his father hadn't even tried to reign in his superior alpha strength, "is he stable?" If Sam didn't get back by the time the servants had lights out he'd be the one in big trouble.
This time Castiel hugged him back, taking in his brother's scent. It was still super sweet. "I'd like to see her again too, maybe we can see each other again soon. I just have to talk to Dean, he's going to be my mate."
Castiel looked at Sam in surprise, "Taller than you? Really?" he thought Sam was the tallest man alive, but  hearing the man who played Chewie was taller, he didn't know what to think.
Charlie arched a brow and reached out and smacked his arm sharply, "hey, this is planning. It will happen. John will see how he can't do the job, and he will ask you to come back, Cas too. And you know what?"
"Right, let's go then," Dean said.
Charlie smiled and got a picture of Dean up on her phone. "This is Dean. Dean Winchester," she said showing Gabriel the photo of Dean, so he would know Cas was well taken care of.
"Yes. I'll be taking over everything, including the servants and "punishments," Dean put quotes around the word.
"This is my mate to be, Castiel. You should know better than to talk to him when his alpha is standing right beside him," Dean said firmly, all alpha tone. The beta reporter cowed under the command and backed away a little, Dean winding an arm around Castiel's waist. "Just look happy for the photographers. This wont last long," Dean whispered to him.
Castiel followed Dean down the hall,  a little embarrassed that the scent marking from Dean had made him get a little slick. Before now, he didn't even slick when an alpha stripped him to knot him. His cheeks flushed red. Why was he getting slick over a scent marking?
"It's how they did it, Cas. Episode 4, 5, and 6 are the first movies made then came 1, 2, and 3." Charlie said softly, happy that Castiel was even giving this movie a try.
Gabriel watched them and couldn't help smiling. Castiel had no idea how in love Dean was.
Sorry it's late guys, life has taken me over! Promise the next one will be on time
"I seriously think that will only make him more likely to stick to his guns," Dean sighed, "he's the very definition of traditional alpha. Challenge him in any way and he'll fight tooth and nail to keep things the way they were."
"Oh wow..." He was to live here? Castiel followed the beta the best he could, stumbling some. "Wait, slow down a little please." He said tripping again as they got into the mansion, only to fall hard onto the spotlessly clean marble floors.
"Hate you? Not possible, alpha Dean. I hate the circumstances, but not you. It will be very embarassing,  but if he does that, I will try not to disobey,  if only to keep the peace for now," he kissed Dean's cheek, "you should get to work now , alpha, or I might have to go to bed alone." He was teasing, but with all the work Dean had to do it could be possible.
Sam looked at him, "I can continue to look into the legalities, but Charlie's a tech wizard. We're trying to help, you've just gotta understand we can only do what the law allows."
Dean paused at that and finally spoke, "I will speak to Sam and call back as to when we are available. Good bye." Dean hung up and began to scoop up leftovers, carrying them in after locking up the car.
John was quiet, smiling. He had hoped Castiel would wear a traditional dress, but Castiel was not a traditional omega to begin with.
"Hey, sexy. Not interested in playing games?" The multiple large alphas came up behind him, scenting the air.
"I had come to get Dean some breakfast, only to find a disobedient omega," Felix said roughly and reached for Castiel's arm.
"Really?" he asked and cuddled closer to Dean. There were people taller than Sam? He was amazed and a little scared.
Its finally time for the party!
Once they got home, he grabbed some bags and as they walked in he called, "Dean! Don't get mad, I smell like an alpha, but it's okay, it was my brother Gabriel!" He was still excited as he walked inside the house, and towards the kitchen.
Dean tensed, "because I wanted to make it special, and Cas was scared."
Castiel smiled, "it is. I always wanted to make nest like this. I just wasn't allowed to." He didn't want to think about the breeding house but he felt bad for the omegas still there. One day he would help some others like Dean helped him.
Castiel looked at him and nervously cleared his throat, "just talking with Adam." He looked down at Adam's hand and gently moved it off his knee, standing up, "I should go back to Dean's room." He slowly started towards the door and tried to get by Felix without touching him.
"Thank you, Cas, that means a lot," Dean smiled at the little kiss and set his empty tray aside.
Dean smiled at the sound of Castiel singing softly in the shower and dialed Charlie, speaking with her briefly and she said she'd pick them up in an hour with some clothes. He told her the room number, thanked her over and over and she just laughed and hung up on him. Dean threw a pillow at Sam, "hey, get up. We've got a temporary home."
Castiel yelped when his head was yanked on, and upon seeing the dominant red alpha eyes, his eyes instantly went omega gold. "Y-yes alpha!" He shivered, frightened. He didn't want to go back to that breeding house, he wouldn't be able to stand it.
John took a deep breath, "I would like you two to review the papers to turn over the family business to you."
"Hey, you two! Join in the game!" Luke called and when Dean looked tossed him a ball.
Dean smiled, extremely relieved, "thank you, Cas. I'm not sure I could do things without you now."
Castiel smiled and nodded, "I'd like that, but I don't know how to swim." He blushed a little in embarrassment as he stood up with Dean. He was excited about the pool, but a little scared as well. He heard about drowning and it didn't sound fun.
Castiel and Charlie got back to her place almost an hour after Sam and Dean did, having been doing some wedding shopping. When Castiel saw Dean he ran to him and hugged him tightly. "Alpha!" he squeezed tightly. He was happy, he had found the perfect dress and he couldn't wait for Dean to see him in it.
Dean relaxed, sighing in relief, "don't worry about it, take your time."
Dean gave soft bites to his thighs, giving Cas a second to collect himself before mounting him and sliding in. Despite how big Dean was, the slide was easy from the earlier stretching and just how soaking wet Castiel was.
"Twenty years old, alpha," he answered softly before slowly scooting a few steps towards Dean. He'd felt at least a little bit safer with him than with this alpha. He tensed when he felt a large hand suddenly at his side.
Dean curled around him, making sure his omega was warm, comfortable and secure before falling asleep himself. He had never imagined this would turn out so well.
said as they walked outside.
"Good." John stared into his gold eyes a second longer. "Get out of here." He released Cas and turned back to his desk, sitting down.
Castiel nodded, "much better than Sam. His scent is okay, but I like yours better." His eyes remained closed, enjoying the relaxation he hadn't felt in far memory.
"Saving humanity is a good reason," Cas said softly and looked at the pile of work his alpha had to do, "you'll be busy a while won't you, alpha Dean?"
John sighed, "Looks like I'll have to make sure you understand what's happening here. I know you must be enjoying your new, privileged lifestyle, but if you're not bite claimed AND pupped by your next heat, you'll be sent back to that filthy whore house immediately. Do I make myself clear?" John yanked Castiel's head up to look at him directly, eyes bright alpha red.
"That sounds like a great idea. We can make it a barbecue, everyone can bring something."
Castiel was quiet, hanging his head submissively. He'd crossed a line, and from Dean's scent, he knew the alpha wasn't happy with him. He didn't know Adam well, but what little he knew of the other he liked enough to press on. He licked his dry lips and spoke softly, "Alpha, if he was spoiled at first and now he's a dirty little secret, how do you think he might feel? I don't love him, I like him. He hasn't tried to take me from you, or anyone else. He's just lonely."
"It means if he doesn't approve of me, I've got to fight that," Dean motioned to the screen.
Castiel snuggled close to him, hating himself for always being so afraid. He couldn't even remember what he was like before the breeding house. What did he like anymore? What was he like? Who was he? He felt nothing but ashamed as to what he'd become.
"Okay, that's fair. So what can we do in reality that would help you?" Sam looked at him, head titled and wanting to do something.
"You think that tastes good? So does everyone else. Fast food is great," Dean chuckled, "try a little bit more of the coffee, you can see if you're the "coffee type". You can also add cream or sugar."
Castiel smiled and shook his head, "no, I found some." He hummed as he kept working on the nest. It was looking good, except he knew something was missing but he wasn't sure what.
Gabriel blinked at him, "wait...no way. Cassie?" He peered closer, scenting him, "oh my god, it is you. What the... I thought our parents had killed you for sure." He swept Castiel into a hug, squeezing him.
Dean grinned, "tempting, but I'd love it if you can show Cas how to navigate a phone. When I have money again I can buy him one. While you do that I'll make lunch."
"Yes, sir." Dean said stiffly, "he will be quiet, dressed appropriately, and by my side for the dinner. I swear it."
Castiel nodded and said, "I know, but why has it been decided that omegas are the lowest? Everyone born comes from omegas, or very few beta females. The omega brings life, but are treated as if we are nothing."
Castiel stood by the bed, staring a moment. He wanted to cuddle Dean, but he wanted his pup to snuggle up to as well. He didn't know what to do. He didn't want to wake Dean, that was for sure.
John noticed all the whispering and turned to look at them. "Something wrong, Dean?"
Castiel noticed an smiled, "Never out grew that love of sweets huh?" Cassie. He hasn't heard that name in years. He could remember Gabriel would sneak him candy when his parents were hard on him.
John nodded, "that is correct. The mansion is yours to do with as you want. That includes Adam. He can stay or be thrown out if you want."
Thank you to my new beta, CS_impala67.
Castiel listened and nodded; seeing how the omega seemed okay afterwards eased his fears. There was some blood, but it did not last long and was very minor, "okay, that helped a lot. Where should we start with the ceremony for me and Dean?"
Dean hummed, turning his head to kiss Castiel's lips, "yes, you did. You're always the smart one." He gave him a cheek nuzzle and took the finished burgers off the grill, placing the next batch on.
Tw: vague mention of non con at the breeding house
He got down on his knees and tried to not look threatening, curling up to look smaller. "Hey, Cas, it okay. Just talk to me. You're not in trouble." He told him softly as he slowly inched closer.
Charlie sighed, "He has no intention of letting Jack know his birth mother. He has said the birth mother was a whore and would only ruin Jack's life. I looked into any ways Castiel could get Jack, or least visitations, and it's near impossible."
Dean squeezed Castiel's hand, looking at his expression with a smile. "You know, if you like the sun, we have a pool. You could spend time relaxing there. We also have horses, I can teach you to ride, or sports like tennis or golf," he felt a little sad for Castiel, seeing him so happy over a bit of sunshine. What kind of place did he actually come from?
"What the..." the alpha narrowed his eyes at him, "wait, I remember you from that whore house on Royal Street. You're Jack's mother. Well, I never expected to see you at a benefit dinner, especially with a family as distinguished as the Winchesters. Though I suspect you wont be there much longer." He rubbed his cheek, wincing a little despite himself, and John stood and whirled on Castiel, eyes dark red with alpha anger.
Sam and Dean arrived precisely on schedule, Felix showing them into the office. Dean refused to show any sort of submission or respect, crossing his arms, "Father. We're here, like you asked. Now what?"
Castiel smiled softly. "You are so amazing," he kissed his mate back, still holding the surrogate pup close to his chest. Now the nest felt more complete and perfect.
"Yeah. I'll text you the name and address since you're the research wizard. Better not let dad know." Dean responded just as quietly, sitting on a stool and watching Cas start to smile as the other omegas joked with and accepted him into their group immediately. It was nice to see Castiel with people that accepted him.
Dean brushed fingers over Castiel's cheek, sighing softly. He cuddled Cas, careful of the "pup" between them, pressing soft kisses up his neck.
Charlie sighed and said, "Dean, before you, do you think he was given a choice in what he could eat? What he wanted to drink? Or if he even wanted pups? He was told what to do for whatever time he was in there. You guys gave him so much more than you know."
He nuzzled at Dean's neck, he just needed the alpha's scent to feel a bit better. John's threat rang in his ears, and thought of going back to that breeding house make Cas feel physically ill. He didn't want to think of what they would do to him, a failure sold to such a successful family.
Castiel felt his orgasm rushing up on him very fast now, and not being allowed to close his eyes but being forced to keep his eyes fixed on Dean’s was only intensifying the pleasure he felt. “Dean, I… ahh…” Cas shuddered. “Dean, I think I… I…” Cas stuttered and moaned, he was now so very near the edge, all he needed was a few more strokes to send him flying right over it. And as Dean didn’t dream of slowing down to make it last longer, Castiel came only seconds later with a loud scream, covering Dean’s fist, his skirt, and both of their shirts with his seed.
“Yes, Dean. Yes, I’ll do whatever you want, just… just fuck me already!”
Dean shot a quick look into the rearview mirror and saw the big hickey Castiel had left on his neck. But Castiel didn’t just stop there, he quickly opened Dean’s zipper and freed Dean’s half-hard cock. “I guess, you really like me in my new skirt, don’t you?” Castiel whispered into Dean’s ear while wrapping his right hand loosely around the base of Dean’s cock. He repositioned himself on the seat, making it more comfortable for him. “Keep your eyes on the road,” he said, before he went down, letting his right hand be joined by his mouth.
Dean just smiled and gladly accepted this pretense, enjoying the opportunity to indulge in carnal desire one last time, before they both got ready, and he drove Castiel to the nearby airport.
“A sexy girl on my sexy baby. You know, any other day this would be a dream come true, but today all I can say is, ‘please step away from my car or you’ll damage the paint with your sequined skirt.’“
He aligned his cock, and let the head slowly pass the rim, before he bottomed out again, only to move back in seconds later. And with each penetration he protruded a little further until he was finally completely buried inside Dean, stopping all movement for a moment to enjoy the sensational feeling of his dick being sheathed by not some random guy or girl, but by his actual boyfriend.
“A very good morning, Cas.” Dean said with a sappy smile, and exhaled deeply. “God, what did you do to me? Is simply kissing someone awake that outdated?”
After he was done, Dean went back to the airport’s entrance hall, eagerly awaiting Castiel’s plane to arrive. When people finally kept coming out of the arrivals hall, Dean’s enthusiasm slowly began to diminish the longer Castiel was nowhere to be seen. Unsettled he started to look at his phone, hoping Castiel might have sent a message, but there was nothing. And when Dean tried to call Castiel, he realized that he actually didn’t have any reception in the hall.
“You bet.” Dean said with a wide grin on his face and hopped into the Jacuzzi. “Mmm… this feels amazing!” Dean said, and closed his eyes for second, leaning against the edge, enjoying the light water massage.
“Do you like it?” Dean asked, unsure. But instead of an answer, Castiel quickly got rid of his shoes, opened his pants, got rid of them too, and squeezed into it. Dean looked over at Castiel, smirking about the unbelievable speed in which Castiel succeeded to change his clothes, and said, “Um… If I had known you’d put them on right now, I would have added a pair of panties, because the skirt and the boxers you are wearing are not exactly a great match.”
Dean scrambled up to his feet to plant a soft kiss on the corner of Cas’s full lips. He removed the thin silver band from the box and carefully slid the ring onto Cas’s finger.
“Come here, you big sap,” Dean sighed, pulling Cas into his arms. He went to plant a tender kiss on Cas’s lips, when he heard the distant shuffling of Sam’s feet.
Dean stomps down the hallway in search of the wayward angel. He lets out a heavy sigh and steps inside Castiel’s bedroom.
“I don't know what I did to deserve someone as caring and selfless as you. You're the best thing to ever happen to me Cas.”
Dean jumped up from the table, his chair hitting the floor.
“Are we gonna talk or what?”
Finally, another update! As always, I hope you enjoy!
----------
“Are you ok? You’re very pale.”
I dreamed of your toned back. Your smooth chest and sharp hipbones. I dreamed of the breathtaking combination of lust and adoration in your eyes when we made love. I dreamed of the way you breathed my name in pleasure.
Months passed and still, there was no word from Castiel. Prayers went unanswered, as did phone calls and texts. It was like he truly vanished. Everyday was a struggle for Dean and Sam did his best to help in any way he could. But he was a poor replacement for the man Dean assumed he would spend the rest of his life with.
“Dean, I told you before. There’s nothing left to say.”
There was a sudden rush of overwhelming anxiety as Castiel lay back on the bed, stark naked. He felt so exposed and vulnerable, yet he was impatient. Dean was slowly, tauntingly, unbuckling his belt. He pulled the leather strap loose and moved onto the bed. He straddled Castiel’s chest.
Dean was startled out of his thoughts by Castiel moving into his personal space and lightly placing his hand on Dean’s forehead.
Cas trailed behind Dean as he lead the way to their kitchen. Nestled in the corner was their small dining room table, carefully lined with tea lights. In the center was a freshly baked cherry pie. Cas turned to ask Dean what the meaning of this was, only to find him down on one knee, ring box in hand.
Something moved beneath the surface of Dean's pain. Understanding, but more so acceptance. Cas was gone; and he wasn't coming back. The knowledge still clawed his heart to shreds but he realized that he could move past it. He could live without Cas. The deep rumbling of the Impala soothed the ache; Sam's soft snores stitched up the wounds. In that small patch of Texas highway, Dean became whole again. Safe in the knowledge that a small part of Cas would always be with him. As he pulled over onto the side of the road, a small smile spread across his face as he looked towards the stars.
“Cas?!”
Dean placed his hands on Castiel’s hips, pulling him forward into a quick, yet heated kiss before separating. Dean released his grip, only to have Castiel grab ahold of his right hand and interlock their fingers. They shared an intimate smile before walking towards the entrance of the bar. The previously crisp air seemed to warm as the love radiated from their bodies into the night sky. For the first time in forever, Dean felt like everything would be ok.
"And you will always belong to me."
As always I hope you enjoy!
“Bullshit Cas. That’s absolute bullshit and you know it. You left me standing here like an idiot this morning.”
Dean awoke under a puddle of drool, a massive headache already pulsing through his head. After a moment of confusion, the memories of last night filled his mind. He and Castiel had gotten into a stupid argument. Castiel has wanted to join Dean and Sam on a hunt. Dean said no. Things were said that never should've been uttered. Dean stormed out of the bunker and drove to the nearest bar, where he proceeded to drink himself into oblivion. A well endowed blonde had caught his eye and they soon exited the bar together. That’s when everything went to shit.
Castiel stared out his apartment window, watching the last of the snow dissipate. He expelled a heavy sigh as he turned to face the front door as it closed shut. Dean stuttered in, still shaken from their fight earlier in the day.
Finally came Lisa. She was there when his entire world fell apart.
Sam opens his mouth to begin his litany of questions when he feels a strong hand grip his right shoulder. He turns to face Castiel with a questioning glance and is met with a forceful look. Sam quickly scurries out of the room, like a disciplined child, leaving Dean and Castiel alone. Dean opens his mouth to begin apologizing, but Castiel cuts him off. “You have nothing to apologize for Dean. I shouldn’t have left just because we had a simple disagreement.” He moves over to the left side of the bed and carefully perches on the edge. He laces his fingers together in his lap and stares at the wall.
Sam turns, a thin book in his hands.
Dean turned to face Castiel once he was sure Sam was gone, a wide grin spreading across his face. Without any hesitation, they both leaned in, lips meeting in a passionate kiss.
Castiel’s words faded out as Dean became lost in his thoughts. He wanted to do nothing more than grab the sides of Castiel’s face and kiss him senseless. He wanted to card his fingers through Castiel’s thick, unruly hair. He wanted to feel the rough stubble brush against his palms. Wanted to taste every inch of Cas.
After having driven on for a while, Dean suddenly reduced the speed, and turned into a side road. Very soon they came to a clearing and after Dean turned off the engine, which crackled and creaked during cooling, Castiel could not only see that they were at a lookout point, overlooking the whole festival area and much more, but also that, due to lots and lots of empty beer cans and other sorts of trash, this probably was a very popular place for all kinds of naughty deeds. He looked at the surrounding trees and wondered about the stories they could tell if only they were able to speak; Castiel was pretty sure they saw a lot of interesting things happening there.
"Cheeseburger with french fries sounds great, please." Dean requested, and Castiel perked up, "I'll have the same, and a third plate for Adam as well."
“You are right, Dean. Yes, I am very impatient.” Castiel said, before he pushed Dean on the bed, his eyes gazing at Dean hungrily. “And I just can’t wait to finally devour your whole body on a proper bed again,” Castiel said, while Dean tried to position himself on it. Castiel followed quickly, hovering over him while straddling his waist.
“Well, what do you think?” Castiel asked rhetorically, one eyebrow raised.
He just smiled, stripped down to his boxers, and followed the path of candles outside. There he was greeted not only by several dozen of lit candles and rose petals, but also the illuminated Jacuzzi with Cas sitting in it, champagne and a bowl with strawberries right beside him. “Surprise. Hope you like it.” Castiel said, a huge grin on his face.
Castiel’s lips were parted, his eyes almost closed, and his long lashes fluttered every time Dean’s thumb grazed over the head of his again swollen cock before Dean let his hand drop and began moving up and down Castiel’s cock again. Dean looked at Castiel and involuntarily just said, “You’re so beautiful, my little blue-eyed angel,” his voice hoarse and tired.
Donnie agreed, and so all three of them made their way towards one of the communal showers right down the hall. The communal shower wasn’t that big, there were only five shower heads along one of the walls and two shower cabinets at the opposite wall, bordering the door leading in and out the shower.
“Yes, yes… fuck, yes!” Castiel groaned.
“Oh God, I have absolutely no idea how I was able to control myself for so long.” Dean said in a gruff voice. “If I had my wicked way with you, I’d have fucked you right on the spot at the airport. You bend over the hood of the Impala.” Dean said, as he slowly started thrusting into Castiel. “It would have been such a nice sight for everyone around us and the perfect start for our trip.”
Dean had promised to reclaim his body with tender kisses, and he did. For what felt like several hours Dean did nothing but kiss every single inch of his skin until he felt like his lover’s name was imprinted all over him, making Dean’s claim over his body only more evident, confirming that he was his and his alone.
