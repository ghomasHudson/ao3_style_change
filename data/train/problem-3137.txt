Dean wasn't sure that was entirely true. Usually, time apart meant they were furious with each other, or one of them was dead. Or a demon. Or, at best, working with a demon. There weren't really any good memories of them just "taking time apart."
"This is Dean. Are you with the dickbags who kidnapped and tortured my brother? What do you even want from us? The fancy bitch said you wanted names of hunters or something?"
"That's great, Carl," Dean interrupted. "We'll take it from here."
Dean's surprise carried into his voice. "What made you decide to move out into the middle of nowhere?"
"I...it's not a big deal." Dean paused. "Just stuff from when I was a kid. Memories that came back, y'know? I mean, we dealt with CPS pretty often, whenever anyone got close enough to learn about our life. But it was awful at the beginning."
Bunker Organizing:
"The thing inside you, it's unholy," Cas said somberly. He opened the nightstand drawer and pulled out a bible. "It's an abomination."
Mary smiled at him, and the fear eased just a little bit.
"No. No, no, no, you won't." Sam said, holding a hand up in front of the demon.
"OK, so I tracked Jamie Ross's credit cards, and his last stop was at an airport to pick up this woman. Tail numbers of the plane have a diplomatic registry."
They were all pretty quiet as they set out into town. Dean went to talk to the coroner at the crime scene while Sam and Cas asked around about the victim, and then all three met back at the car.
"Yes, when you left the house, he didn't even seem to realize I was there. He's been ignoring me more and more lately. It's strange. I thought we were friends."
Dean nodded thoughtfully.
The demon nodded, grabbed the two by the shoulder, and disappeared before Cas could get out more than an angry, "Dean!"
"What kind of manners is that, boy?" she said. "Invite me into your home."
“First of all, you’re not unprofessional, not by any means. You’re the most hardworking person I know, and a few pounds aren’t about to change that.” Sam knelt by the toilet and Dean forced himself to not look away. “You’re certainly not a slob, and yeah, maybe you need some new clothes, but that’s okay. You’re not gigantic, and it’s okay that your body is changing. It’s not a bad thing, and it doesn’t make you gross, or ugly. Anyone who can’t see that is an idiot.”
“Might need to start putting you in the bed,” Dean joked after the short ride as they pulled up to the dimly lit store. He jumped out of the truck and went around to Cas’s side, pulled open the door, and offered both hands to help Castiel down. Cas shuffled along the seat until he was half hanging off and grasped Dean’s hands gratefully, started to shift his weight. Their arms shook as Dean helped him down, and after a bit of a struggle, Cas had both feet on the ground.
“Excuse me,” he muttered, feeling his face heat up. He didn’t care what Cain said, burping would never be sexy.
“Maybe. But that’s just how everything fits nowadays,” Dean said, snapping the waistband of his underwear for emphasis.
The kid (no, don’t call him a kid, jesus) sucked on his bottom lip thoughtfully, and Dean looked away. "I believe so," he said. "I've never been here before. What would you recommend?"
The only real regret Castiel had was that Dean was too fat for him to feel their baby; there were far too many layers of blubber for any type of motion to get through. Still, Cas would not have his mate any other way, and he gave the top of Dean’s belly a loving pat before trailing his fingers down to the sensitive underside, the place that always made Dean shiver and moan in delight.
By the sixth plate, Dean was puffing a bit. This was real work. His gut was pretty damn full by the end of the sixth plate, and this is when Dean usually would have stopped eating. But he didn't want to disappoint his waiter - yes, he'd started referring to him as
Forgoing a belt, Cas thundered down the stairs, trying to ignore the uncomfortable pinching in his waist and... other places. He didn't wear underwear anymore - none of his fit - and these pants were not meant to be tugged up this high. But he liked how big it made him feel, liked how it drew attention to the fact that, even with his lower belly contained, Cas's upper belly was still fat enough surge over the waistband and bury his belt loops. God, what was wrong with him?
Lacy black boyshorts clung tightly to his hips and failed to cover his whole ass, pale, stretch marked cellulite peeking out the bottom, and his belly hung low enough that you could barely see the panties from the front. His pecs actually filled the small cups of his bra nicely, the foam supports and generous lining making them seem bigger, though it was on the last hook and still too tight in the band, forcing his back fat above and below the elastic. The lingerie made him feel good, but it also made Cas realize just how big he was getting, and he still wasn't completely sold on his new body.
, that was good.
“Not really,” Cas said, getting out of his chair. He didn’t break eye contact. “After the first time, when I saw how much you enjoyed my baking, I thought I’d continue. It was obvious that baked goods brought you great joy.”
That means he's at least twenty-two, Dean's brain helpfully supplied. Less than a twenty year age difference.
In any case, Dean had come to terms with his muffin top long ago. He didn’t have a problem sporting a little extra padding, and he got to eat whatever he wanted whenever he wanted, so it was a fair trade, really.
Sam was still slightly red in the face as he walked quickly over to the Impala. Dean had struggled with getting out of the car for the past year or so now, but he was still able to do it under his own power. Sam was about to tell Dean that he could get himself out of his own damn car when he reached the open door and saw the problem.
Lucky for him, it didn't stop there. Dean's belly grew and grew, the little gut swelling until it strained at even his baggiest shirts, even the new jeans getting tight around the waist. Dean ended up popping the button off his new jeans in the middle of a rather spectacular dinner, and Cas had to excuse himself from the table to take care of his... rising problem. He silently replaced the ruined jeans the next day with yet
"Kind of," Dean conceded, giving Cas a goofy smile. "Now help me with these pants, babe. We don't got all day."
“I know, I apologize. Let’s leave that whole business in the past.”
"'Cause I know you'll take care of me," Dean said on a yawn, lazily turning his head to snag a quick kiss. "Love you, Cas."
You'd expect that Sam would be used to this by now - after all, Dean was
"Sorry," Cas muttered, hands busy desperately trying to keep his shirt from bunching up over the lower curve of his stomach and exposing his predicament to the world. "My pants broke."
“The strawberries are gone,” Cain said, unfazed by Dean’s feigned annoyance. “I’d like to give you the rest of the champagne as well, but I thought we could get you more comfortable first.”
, all the food was gone. Empty plates and scrunched-up napkins covered the tables, all traces of food gone. The culprit sat proudly on Dean's thighs, pink and straining and littered with crumbs, and Dean panted out quick little breaths as he drew lazy patterns on his gut with his thumbs.
"That right there's quitter talk," Dean said. "You tug the front, I'll tug the back. One, two,
And he wouldn’t ever have to. Dean sat down on the hot tub’s wide bench, smiling to himself. He’d accidentally glanced at Cain’s laptop the other day while the man had been browsing a ring website. He’d pretended not to see anything, but he totally had. Dean just hoped the ring was adjustable or something, because based on his current trajectory, he’d grow out of any engagement ring before they even had the chance to get married.
"Close the door!" Cas hissed, yanking Dean further into the room by his hand and shutting the door quickly. This wasn't for anyone's eyes but their own.
Dean smiled as he patted his underbelly. Oh yeah, he was
Dean had been the first one to welcome him to the school, and it had honestly been quite a shock for Castiel. He'd gone to a Catholic school for most of his life, one that still ran almost exactly as it had in the fifties. All the students had to look pristine in their uniforms at all times, not a string out of place, and sit upright, as to not allow a habit of laziness to take root. Being met by a chubby young man in a too-tight uniform shirt, his round stomach resting comfortably over a rather tight looking belt, a fist held out for what Cas later learned to be a 'fist bump,' was not what Castiel had been expecting of his new school.
Dean stood by the bed in a pair of what seemed to be painfully-tight boxer briefs and a pair of cheap black slacks stuck around mid-thigh. He was scrunching his face up as he yanked at the pants harshly, belly (and pecs, and arms, and sides) jiggling at the quick motions of his hands. The pants remained stubbornly around his thick thighs, refusing to be pulled up an inch, and Cas sucked in a quick breath at the display. Dean looked up at the noise and scowled at Cas.
“Hey! How was New York?”
"Dumbass," Cas said with a smile.
While eating breakfast the following morning, Dean learned that his belly brushed his thighs when he sat, pooched out just barely into his lap. Some part of him wondered what it would be like if it bulged out even more, even further, if his pecs softened up even more until they were little breasts, and Dean proceeded to eat so many pancakes that he had to rest at the table for twenty minutes before he could get up. This gut was really starting to grow on him. Pun intended.
much better.
Dean could feel his face turning red and he sat up a little straighter, but no, that just made his annoyingly perky moobs poke out like they had something to prove, and it also exposed more of his belly. His round, fat, stretch marked belly that sat in his lap like it belonged there. He tore his eyes away from Sam’s, ashamed. Hopefully the floor would just open up and suck him in. Put him out of his misery.
"I miss you."
was smokin’ hot. He was also more than ten years Dean’s junior, had just gotten his Masters in engineering, and was way out of Dean’s league, so Dean was content to admire from afar, even if he felt a bit like a dirty old man. Yeah, it wasn’t like Dean was that old, but he still felt a little weird about it. Especially since there was no way in hell that Castiel reciprocated Dean’s feelings. He wasn’t lacking in self confidence, but Dean knew that most people didn’t exactly flock to obese forty year-olds who’d been working at the same garage for more than two decades, and he wasn’t about to get his hopes up that Cas would be one of the few who did.
And oh, that actually felt really nice. Cas massaged and licked and bit all over Dean's belly, leaving hickies in his wake, hands trailing lightly over the marks. He was completely ignoring Dean's cock now, but it was somehow erotic and arousing anyway. Dean was almost disappointed when Cas returned to his dick. He'd really been enjoying that attention, and he moved his own hands to his gut to make up for the loss, squeezing chunks of his belly and thumbing over the marks left by Cas.
"She was my boss." She replied, then hesitantly asked, "Is it true what they're saying, that she, you know... killed herself?"
"Deal." Sam agreed though Dean wasn't sure what he was getting out of this deal.
He felt Sam nod against his shoulder.
"What he means," Dean said loudly, "is that some of the filler information we can find online in like archived newspapers and police reports. We still talk to people." He stood and wrapped an arm around Mary. "And you are not obsolete."
Dean hesitated, "What about her?" He wasn't sure this was the best time, but when was it with him and Sam? "What, she took some cash, she took her cell phone, she doesn't answer, and she bailed on us."
"No," Dean insisted, "you were right. I mean, hell, we don't even know what Moriarty's deal was."
- Buy cars legally, but under aliases
"There's a lot more, but I think that should get you through the weekend. Keep it calm and simple for now. Don't try to wow them with shiny things. I'll coordinate more with Alex and Claire and we'll get back to you, ok?"
"You sure?" Sam was pressing. "'Cause ever since Mom left, you've been a little, uh...
Mary turned to look at them. At Sam, who's eyes were bright with tears, at Dean who was about to kill a reaper and Charlie who was shaking Mary by the shoulders.
Dean changed the channel to something more appropriately sports-oriented as Jody came back. Her attitude had completely changed though. She walked right past them, wiping her nose.
"No!" Sam held up a finger. "We ruled no eating in the library. War room and kitchen are fine, but not with the books! Do you know how old some of these are?"
Magda's tests showed extended malnutrition and multiple infections, as well as the more obvious wounds and old scarring. The hospital had not approved of them leaving early, but Dean had spun an intricate story of danger to the girl's life that was somehow completely false even though she truly was in danger. So the doctor gave her prescriptions for antibiotics and pain medication as Dean had told them she would be moved to a safe house for the time being.
Sam was already getting out of the car, and Dean hurried to follow. The men approaching weren't cops—possibly the real FBI.
"Oh, great pep talk. Go, team." Crowley muttered sarcastically.
"It's ok, he's right," Mary said. "But... this is something I needed to do alone. Listen...  most of the people I knew are dead. And then I remembered Asa. He was so young when I met him, I thought he must still be around. And then... I saw an article about his death. So, uh."
Missouri blinked at him. "You know, I honestly cannot tell if he is joking. That has never happened to me before."
"Goodnight, Dean. I will be walking the kitchen and library, so please don't go looking for more whiskey. I promised Charlie. I'll bring you another beer if you want it."
"Dude," Sam argued.
I'm very excited to bring in Magda and Elijah and see how they affect things! I couldn't just let them get killed. Gotta save some of these female characters!
"Now, you haven't filed a report." Sam stepped up to help as Dean moved around to look at the body on the autopsy table. "Has there been any problem determining the cause of death?"
The sisters looked resentfully at the light above. Once this had been their domain, but they were little more than housekeepers now. Tidying up. Cutting loose threads and dangling modifiers. Perhaps it was indeed time to try and change some things.
Dean knocked on the familiar door. There weren't a lot of familiar doors in his life. Very few he came back to over and over. He was happy this was one of them, especially as Jody opened the door with a smile.
Sam, Dean, and Mary left soon after the other group.
"Good." He hesitated, hands shoved in his pockets. "Uh, and I wanted to say... if you ever want to talk, I know what it's like to come back and not feel like you really fit."
"Okay," Jack agreed. "Let's get started then. I'm done with this."
"Dean," Sam said in his heavy, bad-news voice, "she's possessed."
"Alright. Mom or Charlie. What would you do? They are obviously expecting Cas and me."
Cas and Charlie set pie plates in front of each of them, and they looked away from each other. Dean felt that fragile thing in his chest. He didn't know if this was good or bad, the way they were acting. He took his own plate, where Cas had placed two of the slices of pie, and dug a huge bite out with his fork.
how bad he was, and I let him take me because it was the only way at that moment to save
"I do suck at it," Cas replied and showed Dean his phone. There was a text thread open with Charlie.
The humans covered their eyes as red light began to pour out of Lucifer's mouth. Once the glare on his eyelids dimmed, Dean opened them and saw Jeff Rooney collapsed on the floor. Cas hurried over to check on him.
"Ok," Dean said. "Just do what you have to, and I'll try to keep up with you. So far, you and Mom seem the worst affected, so we'll watch out for that."
"Whoa-"
"U.S. government plates. Elite dogcatcher level." He mused. "Someone special wants you. Whose hydrant have you lads been tinkling on?" Dean walked over to the Impala while the man talked and pulled out his own gun. They'd returned the agent's so he wouldn't note it missing.
"I know I've been struggling," Magda said, tears in her voice, "but I don't need a
"No. No." Dean tried to object, but Sam was grabbing the phone back from Charlie.
"Well, that was easy." He said with forced optimism.
" Sam said, "
"Who...what are you?" the hunter stammered.
"What?" Dean said, "I mean, come on, no one can take out five wendigos in a night."
The egg started to glow, and Lucifer began to move towards Sam. White light burst from the device, shooting towards Lucifer and pushing him back. Pressure from the egg was forcing Sam back, too, though, and he struggled to keep his place.
"Alright," Cas said. He turned to look at Jack seriously. A plan was forming in his mind. "Then we need to pick a starting point. We need to release Dean from Chuck's manipulations early. He has to be able to make his own choices. Dean is the linchpin of this family and..." Cas looked away, staring at Dean on the bridge for a moment, "in this life, he let us all fall apart."
All four of them moved quietly through the untidy trees around the property. Even Charlie had picked up forestry skills in Oz. They were only a few yards from the house when Cas stopped them with a hand on Dean's shoulder.
"But we know time weirdness," Dean tangeted. "I mean, I was in hell for forty years and came back and it had only been four months."
"So, you think we can pop Lucifer out of the President with that?" Crowley asked, and Cas threw his hands in the air. Ketch looked shocked.
Sam seemed to be getting upset, and Cas held a hand up. "Perhaps we should focus on Olivia Sanchez," he said. He waved a hand at Dean to read the file.
"Yeah, and hey, Crowley?" Sam was saying. "Uh, find out from your government mole if there's a girlfriend or a mistress or a favorite hooker. Someone we don't know about... got it. All right." He hung up the call and turned to talk to the other two. "Crowley and Rowena will meet us in Indianapolis. Do we have a plan?"
"She just needs a little family time," Dean argued. "A bit of R&R, she'll be aces." Cas just gave him a sardonic look. Dean dropped his head and rubbed the back of his neck. He sighed heavily and nodded. "Ok, then let's go sit down; talk to Sam. We will figure out how to help her
"You know, I'm worried about Mom," Sam said quietly.
"I would love that." She said.
With Dean, who would never love him in the same way.
"Didn't know the rules," Dean said, shoving the smile back onto his face.
"Wait, wait," Kelly argued.
Cas frowned at her. "That's very inappropriate. You aren't supposed to call them that. The preferred term is Native American."
Night fell, and they stopped at a gas station and filled up on fuel and snacks. A seat shuffling had Cas and Charlie in the back this time and Mary sitting shotgun. Everyone offered to take a turn driving, but Dean needed this small bit of control over their safety. They seemed to understand, and none of them pushed, though Cas looked at him sternly.
Hugo turned slowly to give Dean a look of utter betrayal. "You said you were
Cas put his foot down about Elijah. Mary wanted desperately to be able to help but felt stuck by whatever strings were pulling her. Oddly, though, she felt like she could come to the bunker once the brothers had left. So they started out with Charlie and waited at the first rest stop.
"Ok, then who are you going to be?"
"Wait," Dean interrupted. "Go back to the part where Lucifer and Rowena are teamed up? 'Cause, that seems kinda major. You can't just footnote that, Cas!"
"I was only with you for a few years, but I was there, and I know a ton of other people were, too!" Charlie chimed in. "What about Bobby and Jody?"
"What kind of things?" Sam asked hesitantly. She didn't answer. "Magda," he said softly,  "I'm here... I'm here to help you. Show me. Please."
"Um," Dean said, "I was sort of exaggerating. I don't know if Vince Vincente actually wore that specifically, and even if he did, it was only back in the eighties when people still wore stuff like that. Sorry, buddy. I mean, if it helps, he still looks incredibly stupid wearing an ancient rock star at all?"
Dean and Charlie both turned to fixate on him like a target.
Dean asked the waitress for a quieter table, and they were placed in a corner booth. Waffle House didn't exactly have secluded spots. He motioned Charlie and Jody into one side of the booth and Mary and Sam into the other. Dean took a chair and sat at the end. He waited until everyone had ordered before starting his argument.
Charlie chimed in, and suddenly Cas tried to reach for the computer screen.
Dean nodded, but Sam stammered, "I-I didn't, uh... I hung up."
"Oh, it was just- it was just a casual thing," Jody stammered. "Sorry, Loraine."
"Look, maybe this isn't my place, and this is epic stuff, but, you know... if I could have my husband and son back? I mean...
"Stop!" the man shouted, "Don't move!"
Dean left her to work and backed up. Mary came with him, looking lost. They sat down at the map table together.
"Anything about frozen hearts?" Mary asked.
Billie seemed shocked but shook her head. "No, they're just physical wards. Really, Dean? You're not going to charge in to save the day?"
The guy in the suit got the gun away from Dean and pointed it at him.
"Ghost orbs," Dean muttered and put the phone back in his pocket, "Mom, we got something over here."
Abraham spoke up. "Think you boys should go."
"Mom's with Magda." The boy said sadly.
His smile was so shy. He reminded her so much of John when they first met, sweet and nervous. She looked down at her hands and the ring still in its place on her left hand. "I just have so much about you boys to catch up on. Mother stuff. You know," she stood, forcing herself to talk around the lump in her throat, "first tooth, first crush."
"I, I thought you said you were human?" Hugo said hesitantly.
Dean looked to Missouri, who stood quietly behind Ketch and nodded. Good, that meant he was sincere. "All right, then, how about we talk a little before I feel comfortable enough to release you?" The other man sighed but nodded. "So why were you out on that road today?"
The priest finally looked up at him. "We... knew something was wrong. He... he..."
Dean's smile turned a bit sour. "Not usually. I'm reeling from today. Charlie died two years ago, and Cas... well, Cas isn't always around. Usually, Sam's the only thing I've got."
When the food was ready, Elijah and Magda carried most of it out to the war room, where they had decided to eat. Dean brought the bacon tray in one hand and the last plate with an omelet on it in the other.
"And you're better?" Sam asked.
Dean stood at the balcony rail with pride, trying to see it again for the first time. The old fifties-style tech in the command consoles around the map room and the central table with its glowing map of the world. The stone steps up to the library level, and the wooden tables and shelves gleaming there. It was a beautiful place.
"All right," Dean said, desperately trying to stay awake. It was two in the morning. "450 miles to L.A. Land of gridlock, Botox, overtaxing, underachieving, the smell of sweaty desperation. I mean, you can't breathe. The beaches are toxic. You got dudes in skinny jeans wearing sunglasses inside." He sighed, "image-obsessed narcissists. I do like the yoga pants, though." He chuckled to himself. "When was the last time we were in L.A.? About 10 years ago, doing a vengeful spirit? Man, that seems like forever ago. Doesn't it?" No one was responding. He looked over at Sam in the passenger seat. "Hey." He realized his brother was wearing earbuds and hit him on the arm. "Tryin' to talk to you here."
"I did. For a bit," Dean said quietly. "At Sonny's."
"You know, it's probably not as hard, tech-wise, to be dropped in twenty-sixteen rather than like the nineties," Charlie commented as they loaded the truck. "I might not like using Apple stuff, but with an iPhone and iPad, she only has to learn a touch screen and one UI. No keys or code. Just web search and email and text, and she'll be fine. Boring, but fine." Dean slapped at her shoulder, and Charlie laughed.
Sam cleared his throat beside them and then pushed between them to get into the passenger side door. Thinking time was over, apparently. It was time for their regularly scheduled visit to the local morgue.
Dean and Charlie eased open the back door as they heard the front slam open.
"Jody, are you ok?" Sam asked.
"Dean, come on." Sam scolded, and Dean put his hands up in surrender.
"Dean just...died?" Castiel was barely holding in his outrage. "And Sam just left off hunting to go get married? What happened to our friends? What about Eileen?"
She nodded, then put an arm around Charlie's shoulder and they backed off to wait on the stairs.
She smiled and chuckled from where she was gathering used napkins and straw wrappers into a spare bag. "All I did was point at some stuff on a take-out menu. I would've cooked, but I uh...don't."
Magda shook her head and said nervously, "I don't want you to have to move. That would make us upset, too. We've talked about it a bit while we looked around the rooms. We thought It might be nice to have rooms 18 and 20 if we aren't going to share? They share a wall, so we would feel close to each other, but they face different hallways, which is cool." She shrugged and folded back in on
Dean didn't get a chance to shoot Ketch because Cas decked him. Knocked him out with a single punch.
The pyre had been built the day before, and it just took a bit of alternate arranging to get three bodies to fit instead of just the one. Dean was probably a bit too comfortable with arranging bodies on pyres, honestly, when it just felt like a logistics problem to him.
Dean's eyebrows rose. "Damn."
A shotgun cracked, and Sam turned to see Elijah pointing it at him. "Don't move." The boy said.
Dean looked at Cas in the rearview mirror again. He had turned to stare out the window at the dark sky, and Dean's heart ached for all his angel had lost. He had had enough solitude and tears, and if Dean could help it, there would be a lot less of both for Cas.
He grinned at Elijah, "You have been far, far too sheltered. I'm not sure whether to let you look it up or not. I'd tell you to ask Cas, but I'm pretty sure he wouldn't know what it was. Hey, Sam," He called to his brother, who was coming into the library. "Should I let Elijah know what twerking is, or is he too young?"
"Would you like me to stay here while you sleep? Then I can wake you immediately if something happens."
"You know when you died, it changed Dad. I mean, he was Hell-bent on finding out what happened. The hunter life just took him over. I guess I was the same. But Sammy- Sammy, he was different. He wanted out. He went to school." Dean let the pride fill his voice that he never showed to his little brother. "He went to
Ketch sighed. "I'm here, Mr. Davies. And I'm perfectly fine except for what will probably be a rather splendid black eye from the angel. He took offense to something I said."
"Uh," Dean really didn't want to think about that, "yeah. It's just not how we think of you. You know? I..."
Dean raised his eyebrows at his mom and felt a warmth in his chest. He was good at defending his chosen interests and pushing his enthusiasm out despite Sam's protests, but it felt good to be backed up. He pealed the car out of the lot.
He looked Dean straight in the eyes. "Dean, you are the one that keeps this family together, not her. You will bring her back, in time. Do you understand me?"
"I don't think I argued with you," Dean pointed out.
"So..." Jody said slowly, "this is gonna be fun."
"We could draw them out." Mary offered. "Cas, I don't really know what kind of power you have. Maybe you can throw something at the wards and set them off? Let them come towards you, and I can take them out?"
The guilty tone was familiar. It felt like those months after the Leviathans, after Purgatory. When Cas was trying to do anything he could to atone for his sins. "You can't take him alone."
"But that's the slippery slope!" Charlie argued. "If you let him 'help' this time, then you'll supposedly 'owe' him something. It's how a lot of abusive relationships start!"
"No! Not like that. I love her, yeah, but she's like my baby sister. And I couldn't keep-" He swallowed and tried again, "I couldn't keep her safe before."
"Uh, Abraham Peterson?" asked Sam, "I'm James Morrison. This is my associate Ray Manzarek. Uh, we're your new caseworkers with Child Protective Services."
Dean hesitated, not sure if he should keep her talking or focus on the case. He sat back down at the table to work, but Sam had more to say.
Dean closed his eyes and nodded. It was true. He knew it was, somewhere in his mind. Someone had to be there to protect people from the human monsters.
Sam was hunched to make himself seem smaller and less threatening. He did that sometimes, when he wanted to be kind, he pulled his shoulders in and down. "We're very sorry for your loss." He said quietly.
Cas sighed. "A little."
Dean sat down next to her. "Who, Missouri? Who's been visiting you?"
He caught a twist of a smile from Cas before the angel closed the door.
"Obviously Jody's the demon!" Charlie said, smacking her head lightly against the rail behind her, "Come on, Sam!"
He turned and met Sam's eyes steadily. "Yeah. What, you don't?" He didn't know exactly what to say here. He wanted Sam to want more for himself, but not to expect more from Dean. "If you want to end different, we're going to have to make some changes, because if you haven't noticed, we're not in the 'live till you're ninety, die in you're sleep' business. This," he waved at the wall of pinned newspaper articles and maps and other detritus of hunts. "This only ends one way."
"God, I hate LA," Dean groaned.
Dean cleared his throat and focused on the car. "It's a '97 Mercury Comet Voyager," he said. Cas looked up at the name, and Dean smirked. "I thought you could have a turn riding a comet. Plus, it has plenty of seating in case you pick up more strays."
"But what, Beth?" Sam asked softly.
"You just kill me again?" Mary pressed on.
"It's Aramaic," Cas said confidently. "It means, 'Save me, oh God.'"
"This is a nightmare." Dean moaned.
Kelly stared at Dean in shock. Apparently, he could still surprise her. He shrugged. "We're a pretty complicated bunch."
"Oh my God, fine. For now. This is going to be a nightmare."
Dean nodded, not sure what to say to that.
Dean was turning to leave the first room when he saw something out of the corner of his eye. He put the EMF in his pocket and pulled out his phone. With the camera pointed over at the corner of the room, he could see three floating specks of light. Sam was looking over his shoulder and nodded.
With a sigh, she slipped the scissors back into her pocket. Cutting was easier. Climbing up to the tendrils with a ladder-like mental construction, she reached for the end of the thread.
"Joshua fought the battle of Jericho, Jericho, Jericho. Joshua fought the battle of Je-" Her voice was weak and cracked sometimes, "-cho. And the walls came tumbling down. You may talk about your men of Gideon-"
Maybe there was a little future for them.
Magda experimented with levitating a piece of pizza towards her when she was too tired to move but fumbled and dropped on Cas's hair. Dean, sitting next to him, laughed uproariously. It had been a veggie slice, too, and landed upside down, so Dean spent the next half hour resisting the urge to pick bits of onion and green pepper out of Cas's soft hair.
"I say we call the cops on this one," Dean suggested. "I mean, there is tons of evidence in the cellar. We just go with the FBI thing, get Beth to back us up, say we were checking up on things here, show them what we found."
"Hey, Dean, I think we're going the wrong way," Sam commented from the passenger seat, studying the map. Hugo had gotten his alibi, and the woman had been happy to help, especially after he had told her of the horrors he had seen. Then they took him back to the Archdiocese and let him call the police while they vanished quietly into the pre-dawn light.
Her house turned up nothing, so the three went to her workplace next. They pulled up out front of the brick building Child Protective Services was in. Sam went to open the door, but Dean got stuck.
"Oh, don't be stupid," she scolded after a moment. "That woman loves you like her own son, and she would happily hide a few bodies for you. Let's go right now."
Dean started slamming himself into the door, panic rising. He picked up a stone statuette off the ground and hurled it at the door. The stone crumbled, and the door stood unharmed.
Cas hesitated and then began moving towards the door. "I'll just leave you to eat together-" But Charlie and Dean each had an elbow and were dragging him to a chair before he could finish the sentence.
"Are we safe? Is there anyone else?"
"I am. Mostly. But I'm not getting my family captured or killed. So the plan right now is we get Lucifer locked up, and then we run, right? But that leaves an unconscious POTUS, and us suspect as both hurting him and kidnapping Kelly. Or they'll think she helped, whatever. The point is, it's back to Leviathan days, and we're front-page news and our faces splashed everywhere. We won't be able to move an inch."
"Mom and Dad still had friends and stuff in Lawrence, and they realized Dad was getting a bit lost after Mom died. They tried to help and stuff, but he shut everyone out. Especially after he learned the truth. He started to train and study. He was learning a lot from Missouri Moseley, I know now. All I knew at the time, of course, was that we had moved into a motel because the house was too burned to live in. Sometimes we went to daycare, but sometimes Dad couldn't afford it. And sometimes... he left me home with Sammy."
"Father, hey," Dean said, "What happened?"
"March twenty-third, 1972. You walked out of a movie theater- 'Slaughterhouse-Five.' You loved it. And you bumped into a big marine, and you knocked him flat on his ass."
!" He yelled, unintentionally getting everyone's attention. "Is this
He was also experiencing new things, like learning that cooking with Mary was fun in a different way than cooking with Missouri, which was also different from cooking with Cas. Missouri tended to boss and smacked his fingers if he tried to take a tase of anything, and she taught him songs to time her cooking. With Mary, they both indulged themselves in snacking and adding in the meat and cheese. Mary had excellent knife skills, but her taste palate didn't stray far beyond 'cheese,' so Dean handled seasonings. Those cooking adventures had to happen in her apartment because she still couldn't come to the bunker. With Cas, cooking was precise measurements, messy workspaces, and leaning over each other to check the flavors. Subtle jokes, hip checks, and Dean's head thrown back in laughter.
Crowley got news of a possible Lucifer victim, so Cas and Sam went to check it out. Dean had a meeting with a contact to sell another one of the cars, so he let them go on their own since it was just a morgue visit.
"By doing what?" Sam asked, "By beating the hell out of her?"
Then the next song started, a synthy disco beat, and Dean just dissolved, falling to the forest floor, holding his belly. He tried to keep from giving their position away, but it was so hard to keep from dying of laughter.
"Oh my
Charlie said with a wave a Dean.
"Winchesters."
"I don't know," Dean said as he came up the steps, "who won the Nobel Peace Prize? Why don't we start there? Anyway, I've got grub. Let's put the crime scene pics away and get the kids to come out here."
Dean begged. His laptop was open, and Cas and Charlie were on Skype from their own motel in Columbus.
"We have no sure bets here, okay?" Dean said, "Anything that we use is gonna be like popping BBs."
Sam was pushing Dean and Mary away from the rest of the party and Jody was trailing along behind. Dean was thankful someone else was figuring something out. The panic was scraping at the edges of his brain, how did he just keep everyone from fucking
There were bags and bags of things that needed sorting lining the hallway outside the kitchen, but they had all decided to deal with them later. Sam had brought takeout, and it covered the island.
"Ok, bro. Let's find this Magda chick. We can figure out if she's evil afterward." Dean said quietly. Sam didn't answer but just kept moving towards the farmhouse.
"Oh, I hope you like strong beer, buddy," he said as he handed the bottle back.
Blue eyes studied green. Cas whispered, "I wish you hadn't made me vow not to read your mind." After a few moments, the angel nodded, and Dean hugged him tightly. Relief crashed through the human in a tidal wave.
Dean was saved from having to respond by losing his game. "Oh, man! I lost."
"Bacon?" she asked.
"Did you know people tell stories about us?" Sam asked. Apparently, Elvis had found him.
Cas knelt, and Dean shifted to the side to give him room. The angel looked to Kelly with pleading eyes. She was clearly overwhelmed by all of this, but she nodded, and he touched her where Missouri had.
, Dean thought - and his eyes flew down to Dean's belly-shelf for a split second before returning to his eyes. Dean couldn't blame him; it was pretty hard to miss in general, but when Dean's gut was on display like this, it quickly became his best feature. He made direct eye contact with their waiter as he fondled his underbelly, licking his lips as he amended, "Actually, get me two of your favorite."
(See the end of the chapter for
“You probably should have taken this size in the first place. That extra-large jersey never really fit, and I think we might have to peel those pants off of you,” Cas said as he rummaged through bins.
Dean was expecting another belly rub, so the mouth on neck came as a surprise. A nice surprise, though. He bit back a yelp when Cain began sucking on a spot just under his second chin, turning the noise into a loud, drawn out moan when he felt nimble fingers begin to play with his nipples. They sat just above the waterline and were ultra sensitive due to the cool evening air, so every touch felt like an electric shock that went straight to his groin.
Cas let out a long-suffering sigh. "Remind me again what time we got here?"
Cas's train of thought screeched to a stop when Dean suddenly kissed him, close-mouthed and sweet. When Cas didn't react, Dean pulled back, eyes sad, mouth open to apologize. Castiel snapped himself out of his stupor - Dean had just
But after a month of bartending at Purgatory, Dean had to admit that the management had known exactly what they'd been doing when they'd hired him. He made a fuck-ton of money in tips every night, was getting hit on left and right by kids half his age, and was the most popular bartender in the whole club. Though Dean would still argue that he looked like an idiot.
"Dean, that obviously isn't gonna work," Sam shot back. "You're packed in there like a goddamn sardine. Actually, come to think of it, how the hell have you been getting to work if you can't even get out of your car?"
Weirdly fascinated now, Dean poked at his stomach and watched, transfixed, as it sunk in a little. His tiny gut was pretty solid - probably all the beer, heh - but still shook when he jumped experimentally. After a couple more moments of staring at himself, Dean just shrugged and tugged his shirt back down. He was still a badass who hunted monsters for a living and was currently boning his best friend. He could deal with a little extra chub.
Dean lifted his right hand to his mouth in a slow rhythm as he worked at his belly with his left, valiantly attempting to finish his ninth plate. Dean felt like he was going to explode, and not just in his gut.
, Cas. Not beautiful.”
This time Dean was presented with the whole bottle. He eyed it warily. There were probably two big glasses’ worth left, and the bubbles always made him feel fuller than he actually was, something he couldn’t really afford at the moment. Still, he grabbed it and brought it up to his mouth. Dean Winchester wasn’t no quitter.
By the end of the seventh plate, however, Dean's belly put up a wall. It didn't want any more food, and it was protesting the food currently in it. But Dean wasn't a quitter. He hadn't even had dessert yet!
"I noticed," Dean whispered with a twinkle in his eye. "Don't worry about it, you can borrow mine until you get the chance to order some more. We're probably about the same size anyway."
Now it's was Dean's turn to blush. "I, um, actually didn't. For the first couple months, at least. I only realized when you replaced my jeans the first time."
seen him. And he didn’t recognize the voice, so it was probably a new guy, someone young and impressionable, who had just borne witness to their captain’s face plant.
, his mind whispered.
they whispered,
The mechanics and Dean talked for a while, people slowly trickling out of the room as they finished eating, and by the time the pizza delivery person called, only Dean and Cas were left.
Keeping one hand on his belly to keep his shirt down, Cas attempted to unwrap a piece of candy single-handed. It didn't go well. "Give it here, genius," Dean sighed, and seconds later there was an unwrapped chocolate in the palm of Cas's hand. Cas mumbled his thanks and shoved the candy in his mouth, making a pleased noise at the way it melted. Before he knew it, another unwrapped candy was in his hand, then in his mouth, and then half the bag was gone, and Castiel whimpered pitifully.
"Thank you, Dean."
When the new semester started and Cas got his schedule, he stared at the little black text that read '6th period - Fitness and Wellness.' Otherwise known as gym class. Cas got out of breath going up a flight of stairs; how in God's name was he supposed to survive an entire semester of Gym? When he asked Dean about it, hoping it was some mistake, Dean grimaced sympathetically.
Cas slowly, painfully made his way around the gym as the other kids played dodgeball, his pace slow enough that he could probably walk faster. Dean's tank top had ridden up above his lower belly roll and love handles and Cas relished in the cool air against his skin, trying to ignore the way puddles of sweat were dripping everywhere else on his body, everywhere skin met skin. He ignored the giggles whenever he passed by a fellow student, ignored the way his rolls slapped against each other with every step, ignored his shame at how hard running was for him, ignored his own labored, wheezy breathing.
During the next few weeks, even though Dean and Cas were officially a couple now, not much changed. They held hands in the hallways, made out in their room (plus a little more), and pushed their beds together so they could share, but they were still friends. They still hung out with their group of friends and got dinner together every day. And if Dean sometimes fed Cas from his own fork, or rubbed his belly after a particularly large or decadent dessert, it was nobody's business but theirs.
“Tryin’ to make me fat,” Dean complained one night as he drove Cas home. “I don’t think I’ve eaten that much food in my entire life.”
The scale beeped, Dean looked down, and his jaw dropped. A little red
Dean sucked it up and took a bite of his new sandwich, but Cas could see and hear how unhappy his stomach was with him. It gurgled and pushed up his shirt, sat in his lap, big and bloated and heavy. If he hadn’t changed out of his jersey after practice, Cas had the feeling that Dean would be down a button or two.
Now Cas just had to figure out a way to come to the Winchesters' for Christmas, too.
“Probably,” Dean said, “but I couldn’t find any double-XLs in the bin the coach gave us, and at least the buttons came together.”
As Dean's hand delivered the final bite of pie to his mouth, he leaned all the way back and moaned quietly. Both hands now devoted to giving himself a belly rub, Dean took a deep breath and released it all the way, groaning a little when the action pushed his stomach up into his lungs. Nevertheless, he continued to breathe deeply and rub himself down, whining for Sam to rub a spot on the apex of his belly. He could no longer reach it, as his gut was too big and bloated. He'd never been this big in his life. He'd probably put on a few pounds during this meal alone.
It was the first day of baseball tryouts, and while Cas didn’t strictly need to be there - he was already a senior captain, he didn’t exactly need to secure a spot on the team - he and his co-captain, Michael, had come to show their support. They were helping the coach set up drills before the other boys arrived, and as such, Castiel was just walking back from the outfield when he slipped on a stray bat and ate dirt.
He wasn't sure how they hadn't faced a lawsuit yet, since there was a pretty popular gay bar in Florida called Purgatory, but it wasn't Dean's job to ask questions. It was Dean's job to pour drinks, mostly to twinks in skinny jeans.
In case you’re wondering, I chose Cole Trenton as the old ‘college flame’ mostly cause I needed a character that I didn’t mind using as a plot device. I didn’t tag the character or pairing because it’s not really important. Thought about making someone up, but his actor isn’t known for being the nicest guy anyways, so I’m not super torn up about it lol
As if he’d read Cas’s mind, Dean said, “We’ll just have to get this tight too, right?” with a wink, and Cas couldn’t agree more.
This had to be the fullest he'd ever been. Cas dropped both hands to his overstuffed gut, cradling it gently, his shirt slowly inching up and over his rolls despite his efforts to keep it in place. He whined and pawed at the too-tight fabric, beyond caring about what a spectacle he had to be making of himself.
And what a middle it was. With his pants shoved down low and his shirt riding up well above his belly button, Dean’s stomach was on full display, round and proud in his lap, the milky skin riddled with freckles and stretch marks and lines from where his waistband had been. Skin pulled taut across its expanse, and Cas massaged gently, trying to soothe the discomfort brought on by eating enough food for five, let alone two.
Sam impatiently checked his watch for the fifth time in as many minutes. 7:14. Dean was late.
Three pieces turned into six, the rich, creamy cake more than halfway gone already, and Dean was beyond uncomfortable. His stomach gurgled in protest, the onslaught of heavy food too much for it to handle. Dean groaned and puffed out his cheeks, dropped a tentative hand to his distended middle. He’d gone into ‘automatic feeding mode,’ as Sam said, without realizing it and was paying the price. His stomach was round and bloated, full to bursting, and kept making unhappy noises as it tried valiantly to digest way more cheesecake than one man should ever consume.
Once Dean calmed down a little, Cas hummed and sucked his dick down to the root, face smushed against his soft belly. Dean gasped and clenched his fingers in Cas's hair, the sensation almost making him come right then and there. He tried to suck in his gut, to give Cas more room to work, but it didn't help much. Cas took his mouth off Dean's dick, and Dean let loose an embarrassing, needy noise.
“Probably,” Dean said, swirling his beer around its bottle dejectedly. “It just annoys the hell out of me. After years of dieting, all I get for my troubles is a soft stomach and a double chin.”
Though he really just wanted to know, Cas sighed in resignation. “Five eighty?” he guessed. It had to be a big number to get a reaction like that out of Dean, and maybe it was a bit of an overestimation, but maybe not.
"I know," Dean said smugly, producing a half gallon of whole milk from behind his back. Castiel took it with greedy hands and chugged a third of it, belching loudly. "What can I say? I like to keep my boy happy."
The second plate was gone and Dean was already starting to think about seconds when their waiter approached with Sam's salad. He undressed Dean with his eyes as he set Sam's plate down, staring down at Dean's gut as Dean started to ask Sam about refilling his plates. Dean gave the waiter another wink just to see that cute blush again, but otherwise his attention stayed focused on Sam.
“Uh, yeah,” Dean called back, subconsciously sucking in his stomach.
Hope y’all enjoyed ;) I probably won’t be adding too much to this in the future, and what I do add will likely be random pieces from my drafts. Please feel free to keep leaving prompts anyway - it might inspire someone else!
Cain smiled indulgently, already reaching for the next one even though Dean was still chewing the first. “Of course. I brought out about three dozen, although there are another couple dozen in the fridge for later. If you want them, that is.”
No. No way. He was hallucinating, had to be.
Cas followed Dean readily, closing the door behind him. He stripped off his button down and Dean's breath caught as a strong chest, lean but muscular arms, and delightfully pudgy stomach were revealed. Then Cas reached towards Dean and guided his thick arms out of the holes in the vest, squeezing his biceps as he whispered, "These arms look like they could tear me apart, Dean."
“Totally. You always used to look so tired and pale. I’m pretty sure those disgusting smoothie things were killing you, dude. You look way better now, even if it comes with a few less, um, sharp edges.”
“You’re one to talk,” Dean said with a scowl, and he retracted his arms to fold them in front of his belly self-consciously.
“You, um, you must be really stressed,” Dean joked weakly.
Come to think of it, they hadn’t actually been on a date in almost six months. “Let’s go out tomorrow,” Cas said.
He found an empty patch of gym floor easily enough and sank to the ground before Walker could decide his exercise for him. Sit-ups seemed like the least painful choice, after all.
"What would you two gentlemen like to eat this evening?" the waiter asked. He said gentlemen, but he was only looking at Dean. Well, Dean's lips, but Dean understood. He had a great set of lips.
“You can repay me by going to dinner with me afterwards.” Sam smiled again, and the butterflies that had taken up residence in Dean’s stomach went on a rampage.
Dude talked like a professor, for fuck's sake, even though he couldn't be a day over twenty-five. Dressed like one, too. Slacks and a button up didn't exactly blend in with the rest of the crowd (even if the shirt did pull tightly across his chest, Dean's mind gleefully added).
He cackled as Sam turned tail and fled back to the common area, and although Cas half-heartedly admonished him, they continued to defile Sam's door for several more minutes until they finally stumbled to Dean's room so Cas could show him just how 'becoming' his extra weight really was.
He took long, deep pulls from the bottle one after another, afraid that he wouldn’t be able to continue if he stopped. Each gulp added to the already incredible pressure in his stomach, and Dean swore he could feel it swelling as he continued to chug. This wasn’t the fullest he’d ever been, but it was definitely up there, and the champagne in particular made him feel like he was about to pop.
"Still, I must apologize. I'm afraid Gabriel doesn't know the meaning of the word 'manners.'"
As Cas's mind spiraled, he barely noticed Dean sidle up to him with a suspicious gold button in one hand and a barely eaten mega-size bag of mini Hershey bars in the other, the kind with a hundred or so pieces. "This belong to you?" Dean asked in a low voice. "Good thing it's so dark in here; only reason I saw it's cause it hit me in the leg."
"Feed me," Cas demanded, wiggling from his perch atop Dean's lap. He ignored the way his stomach was already protesting his massive food intake, the way his parents' voices whispered about homosexuality in the back of his head, and opened his mouth expectantly. When Dean just stared, Cas whined and wiggled again, feeling his fat shake at the movement as he watched Dean's do the same. Dean snapped out of his stupor and shakily unwrapped a chocolate, brought it to Cas's mouth. Cas greedily took the chocolate between his lips and chewed quickly, moaning at its creamy texture, and Dean swallowed audibly.
“Please, you couldn’t go a week without it.”
Cain began to rub his unoccupied hand along Dean’s gut in smooth, firm strokes, and Dean’s mouth dropped open in pleasure. Another berry nudged at his mouth and he ate it automatically. He let his hand that was still resting at the back of Cain’s head tangle in his delightfully long hair, his other resting heavily on top of his belly. It was about all he had the mind to do.
Dean grinned at her. "So close." He saw her begin to withdraw and held a hand out. "Mom, this meal is fantastic. Thank you."
He chuckled. "Well, I'm not dead yet."
"What? Where did she send him? Is he still in the hairband guy?"
"Allison Mack and her rape cult have sullied the name of Justice League's Watchtower," Charlie argued sulkily, "but yes, I'm Watchtower." She sniffled. "And you're going to get me my own baby Lucille so I can follow you sometimes and help from there."
"Yeah"
Indeed, most car journeys still felt like that. But this car felt more like the destination than the trip itself. He could climb into this snail-shell and never ask it to hurry. Because... Cas let himself look at Dean; there wasn't anywhere else he would rather be.
For Sam, the hilarious: "You will love a beautiful woman, but she will never listen to a word you say."
"Uh, ok," the coroner hesitated. "This is a local case. Why would the FBI be interested-"
Also, why do you think Mary HAD to go? Maybe someone's "pulling her strings?" Hint hint. Lol, you already know the story!
"No! I'm not... I mean, his third album was kind of... not horrible."
She gave him a confused look as she took a bite. "It's
"Um, 'angel'?" She looked confused, and Dean remembered he hadn't caught her up on much in the few hours she had been alive.
"Peachy." Dean was fully in performance mode now, his earlier openness with Cas shut back down.
Dean noticed the way Arthur Ketch woke up. He himself did the same way: instant assessment of danger even before consciousness had wholly settled. The man didn't open his eyes immediately but carefully moved his arms and legs to test his restraints and then peered out at the room through slitted eyes, not ready to make his awareness obvious.
"I'm in," Magda said firmly. "I've been fighting the devil for five years, and I'm ready to get a hit in. I've still got a lot to learn, but I've got control enough to be helpful." She looked to Missouri, who nodded.
Cas nodded, "Yes, but the power to produce this is immense. It's much, much greater than a typical angel."
Cas was practical. "It appears to be a human tooth pulled out by the root."
me when I don't show up with you two."
"That...sucked," she moaned.
Also, their other friends had shown up. No one introduced them to Ketch so as not to tempt him to start killing allies.
Sam and Cas were already in the library when Dean stumbled in after a few hours of troubled sleep. He automatically checked over Sam first, who seemed... better than he had been the last few days. The past couple of days since Mary and Charlie's departure had been extremely quiet and tense. So he just nodded a sleepy greeting and settled into one of the leather side chairs with his coffee. Sam returned the nod absently as he focused on whatever he was doing on the computer.
"Yeah!" Dean remembered now. "Supposedly he killed like five wendigos in a night."
"Well, we've already taken care of that little problem for you, so what do you want from us now?" Dean asked harshly.
Dean stayed on watch while the others got some sleep in the barely-tidied living room. He was back to keeping everyone within visual range except short bathroom breaks. It was not a well-fortified area, but it was the only place to keep everyone for now.
The teenagers gasped in shock, and Dean realized no one had filled them in. "They're just sleeping," Cas assured them kindly.
"Yes," Cas responded dryly. "I don't trust them."
Sam dropped to the ground as if he had been hit with the shovel anyway.
Holidays took a lot out of me. I'm very worn out, but this chapter finally got finished and edited! Yay! Hopefully, now I'll be back on track. Sundays might be more of a posting day than Thursdays though. Oh, and I have a guestimated chapter number up for my season 12 rewrite! And I do plan to keep going, I just wanted to have like a mark that I was working towards. And a Pause if not an End.
"About what?" Dean was almost shouting now. "I don't have a different theory! I'm just telling you the gaping craters in yours! What is going on with you lately? Are you mad at me? Or at Cas? It's like you won't even look at him!"
!" Mich insisted. "
Rock music and Vince Vincente's voice poured out from the phone speakers.
"Oh my god." Sam looked panicked. "I have no clue. When do normal people learn stuff? You taught me stuff way too young."
"This is L.A. I know a lot of people." Crowley gave a friendly wave to the receptionist, who waved back, and they headed upstairs.
Dean was pretty sure if he could manage to sell the pristine 1920's Model T Ford that they had in the garage, they'd be able to buy whatever they wanted. Plus, there were a couple of other cars and several motorcycles from the '50s. It would be hard, and he would keep Dorothy's motorcycle, but he could bear it.
"Alright, now," Cas gruffly said as he pulled away, "Missouri said you have to get sleep." He put a hand on Dean's arm and dragged him towards the stairs. "I'll take a better look at my wings tomorrow. Also, I really would prefer if you'd let me help you sleep better tonight," he said, with a short glance at Dean.
"Oh," Cas said. "Well, the werewolves are dead, but we have suspicions about a vampire nest in Vermont and may be gone for another week, most likely two. Will you be all right?"
"What does it look like I'm doing?" Dean said, still a little out of breath. "I'm sitting." He was actually pretty proud of himself. He hadn't been able to sit in a booth for months, but now he'd figured it out. Dean liked this place. If all of the tables were this low, he'd be coming here a lot more often. Maybe this would become his new favorite spot to take dates.
I might add - because he has zero self control."
Dean still thought it was weird that anyone would enjoy his body like this, let alone someone as ripped as Sam, and he shifted uncomfortably. “‘S a little tight,” he said, “but that’s probably because I’m so full.”
Sam wrinkled his nose. “Gross, Dean. I’m just saying, those clothes haven’t fit you for a while and you sure as hell aren’t getting any smaller.”

"Dean, it's rude to flirt with the waitstaff," Sam admonished. "And get your stomach off the table! Have some self respect!"
wanted to kiss him. "Wanna get a second opinion on this recipe before I set it loose."
Dean, the mature adult that he was, couldn’t resist saying, "You could be coming on me, too," and although Cas rolled his eyes, he couldn't help but notice how his hands tightened around his belly.
"Oh ye of little faith," Dean shot back. "Watch and learn."
Oh god. Someone
But Dean could and did so pretty regularly. Benny brought out the whole tin and Dean nearly kissed him then and there. Instead, he did the next best thing and ate that entire pie while he made eyes at Benny, not even bothering to be subtle any more about how much he wanted the baker.
“Wait.” Cain stilled and raised an eyebrow, clearly wondering why Dean would want to stop now of all times.
Dean just let out another little whimper and closed his eyes. He was
The waiter's ears turned a little red -
It was just a small group playing horror video games, and Dean had managed to sneak up all the extra junk food from the kitchen. "Friends with the chef," he'd said with a wink, and yeah, Cas could believe that - Dean was ridiculously charming. Jo brought the candy, Benny brought the booze, and Cas was feeling rebellious and happy and pleasantly buzzed.
Though it took him a while - twenty-seven minutes, but it wasn't like Cas was counting - Dean managed almost all of the food on his own. Well, Cas kept up the belly rubs on and off, so not
Two egg rolls, all the lo mein, most of the beef, and half the fried rice were already down the hatch when Dean started to really feel full. He managed to eat half of the chicken and another egg roll despite the fact, but then he had to stop and tug his shorts off because they’d grown too tight even under his stomach, and then he took some more time to give himself a quick rub-down. This was utter bliss. Dean loved feeling full like this, loved how his whole body felt warm and heavy, and the food was delicious, practically begging him to eat more of it.
“You wanted to, dumbass. Now get on the scale.”
A low groan tore itself out of Dean's throat as the sweet, slightly tart flavor burst across his tongue. "Oh my god," he moaned after his first bite, immediately going back in for another. "Benny, this is fuckin' delicious. What is it?"
, and Cas made soothing noises as he massaged his overburdened stomach.
had Dean forgotten to lock it? He wanted to yell at Sam to stay out, but he couldn’t seem to form the words, his tongue suddenly too big for his mouth. “Because you didn’t look okay back there, and from the way you ran into the bathroom, I-“
Soon enough, Cas was squeezing himself into Dean’s work truck. The bench seat was all the way back but Cas
Well. Apparently Dean had really impressed the management during the interview, and he'd gotten the job. He'd been told to report back for training the following night, and that had been that.
"You're the only person I know who'd be excited about a twisted ankle," Dean said with a laugh, kissing Cas gently. "Remember what the nurse said - don't put pressure on it, keep your brace on, and let your boyfriend be as overbearing and doting as possible. Capiche?"
"Very much so," Castiel agreed, licking his fork. Dean's pupils dilated, and Cas shifted in his seat. "I can't believe Mother and Father kept this from me for so long."
Dean sat there wallowing in self pity for a few minutes longer, rolling the red gatorade he’d bought between his hands until it no longer felt cold. Then he twisted the cap off and chugged it just to have something to do besides think, and he noted that yeah, red was still the best, but the drink reminded him that he was hungrier than he’d been in a while. Including the past week, during which he’d been starving himself. Okay, he’d supposedly been
“How’d you manage to lose weight so fast?” Becky, one of the less socially-conscious interns, asked him. “I swear, you must’ve dropped thirty pounds overnight.”
"Sweetheart," Dean began, "you just became my favorite person."
“Uh, no,” Sam said, looking worried. “I’m actually cold if anything.”
Dean had three servings of dinner that evening and unzipped his fly afterwards, sighing contentedly, as he hollered for Sam to snag him a second beer. He didn't seem to notice how his plump belly crept forward to fill the space.
But Cas did. He
You see, Sam hadn't actually seen Dean for going on three months. His last year of law school had been extremely busy, and Dean actually lived a couple hours away. Of course they'd texted and talked on the phone on a weekly basis, but the point was that Sam hadn't actually

sexy, Winchester. Dean stopped just before the door, one thick-fingered hand already reaching to open it, and he swallowed audibly before he forced out, “Thanks for lunch, buddy.”
“Maybe,” Sam said, and Dean huffed out a laugh, wiped at his face. His friend’s eyes were soft, and that little bit of something he’d seen in them earlier looked stronger. It felt like butterflies were fluttering in Dean’s already very full stomach. Sam was the first person he called after a bad day, his favorite person to hang out with, and quite possibly the object of a building crush that Dean had been suppressing for a long time now. And here he was, taking the time to sit in a coffee shop bathroom and give Dean a heartfelt pep talk.
Cas sighed happily. His boyfriend may have been an idiot, but he was
"Damn, baby, where were you hiding all that?"
Dean and Cas shared clothes now, too, all of Cas's own much too tight around the belly, hips, and thighs. His weight continued to pile on at a steady pace, maybe even faster than before, and by the time Thanksgiving break rolled around, Dean had already had to let out two pairs of his own pants so they'd fit around Cas's rapidly-expanding waistline. He'd kindly mutilated one of his own belts for Cas as well, digging out new holes with a knife so his boyfriend's belly could sit comfortably over it. Cas had grown amazingly large in the past few weeks, and it showed.
did this feel good. He whimpered and brought his other hand down to help, leaned back a little to give himself more room to work. Dean felt like a fat slob, sitting there with his gut in his hands, but the pressure was so good that he couldn’t bring himself to stop. It felt borderline orgasmic, and because Dean’s right hand apparently had a mind of its own, it wandered down a little lower and snuck into his tight boxer briefs without permission. And soon the experience was
ain't subtle."
go to Peebles."
Dean gains weight, and both of our boys are idiots. Set any time between season 8 to present.
Dean was not pouting, thank you very much, but he was a tad bit annoyed. Stupid fuckin' demon had thrown him down a flight of stairs last week, and now he had a broken leg and was stuck at the bunker while Cas and Sam got to go up to Maine and hunt werewolves. They'd left this morning, and although Dean had enjoyed a rather thorough goodbye kiss from Cas, he was still grumpy and bored (
and although Cas knew the words were false, he began to feel very small and very alone.
"Lay back," Cas commanded, and Dean did so without a second thought. He scooted back against the cool leather seat and laid down, palming at his dick and pushing his belly out of the way with his other hand. But his hands fell when Cas leaned down and put both of his hands on Dean's big gut, squeezing his fingers around the fat, and they both moaned.
Dean’s a bartender at a gay club and Cas is a new customer. That’s it, that’s the fic.
Sam rolled his eyes with no real menace and waited for his salad.
Prompt from one_red_sock: “Any AU or "canon", if you wish. Dean is left home for a month ... at the dorm, in the bunker, wherever ... and he decides to indulge his inner glutton. He eats constantly the whole time, as much as he dares, and he kind of loses track of time. By month's end, he's stuffed to the gills and packed on the pounds. He can barely move when he hears keys in the lock: someone's come home. NOW WHAT? (Your decision who it is returning. And ... GO!)”
"I..." Cas started, staring at Dean incredulously. Dean stared back, an eyebrow raised. "I didn't think that you- you knew?"
Ignoring Sam's grumbled complaints from across the table, Dean reached under the table and popped the button on his jeans, unzipping them for good measure. His belly wasn't trapped in his jeans at all - oh no, he was way past the stage where he could fit his gut in his pants - but it was still squeezing uncomfortably down there. Partially due to his food binge, partially due to the tent in his pants that had developed over the course of his meal. When the button was popped, Dean gave a loud sigh of relief, his dick and stomach taking up the space they really needed. Sam made an embarrassed noise, but Dean didn't care. He pressed down on his crotch for good measure. Oh
Cas's gut surged out in front of him, hanging over his belt and bouncing with every movement he made. It had started to sag, the doughy fat easily succumbing to gravity, and Cas had to tuck his shirt in if he didn't want his lower belly roll to peek out of the bottom. His gut was really more like three rolls stacked atop each other, the biggest and softest on the bottom, filling out and straining at all his shirts and almost liquid-like in its shaking softness. Then came the next roll, his upper belly, the difference marked by a deep crease a few inches above his belly button, and then the small roll atop which his newly-formed breasts sat. Everything was covered in deep, angry stretch marks. It was a marked difference from Dean, whose solid, smooth gut perched primly over his waistband. Cas loved Dean and Dean's body, but he still had mixed feelings about his own.
“You’re probably right,” he admitted.
Rolling his eyes, Cas did the same to the brownie, plopping it down on Dean's shelf of a stomach. "Any day now," Cas said when Dean didn't make a move for the food.
Well, you'd be wrong. Dean had been on the fat side of chubby since elementary school, but it was only since he'd gotten his own garage that Dean had really started packing on the pounds. Dean was still a mechanic, but he didn't really do any of the physical labor anymore. He mostly just sat behind a desk nowadays. Being the shop's owner, Dean dealt more with paperwork and supplies, not so much the actual fixing of the cars, and cutting basically the
“Sideways, baby,” Dean murmured, and Cas huffed out a breath. He knew the drill by now; he hadn’t been able to fit through single doors straight on for about a year now. Cas turned to the side and slowly shimmied to the right, one hand on the door frame, one in Dean’s, and he had to suck in a bit to get the fattest part of his belly through the small space. Dean looped an arm back around him once he was through, and Cas was relieved to see that the scale was only a few paces to their left. He needed a rest. Hauling himself around was extremely difficult, and the fifteen or so steps he’d taken so far were pushing it; usually, he’d have taken a break already.
Cas shivered in anticipation, excited at the idea of finally getting to know his own weight. He’d outgrown their scale four years ago when he’d reached four hundred pounds, and it was kind of difficult to go to the doctor’s office when you didn’t have a birth certificate, social security number, or any real proof of your existence. He knew he was big, but he’d love to be able to put a number on it.
"Pivot? What-"
Dean scrambled out of his chair, walked around the table, and picked up the napkin Cas had accidentally dropped on the floor. He placed it back on the table and gave Cas a sweet kiss, and Castiel smiled.
Mary had given Cas a standing invitation to join them for dinner - he’d accidentally revealed that his parents weren’t home much, and that he mostly had to fend for himself when it came to meals - and after some convincing, he became a fixture at their dinner table from that point onward. He’d stuff Dean full of milkshakes and pies and more at the diner, unbeknownst to Mrs. Winchester, and then they’d go back to Dean’s house where Dean would choke down two plates of dinner.
Face heating up, Dean slouched further into the couch cushions, self-conscious about his weight gain for the first time. The position just made his belly pooch out even more, his round, plump stomach smothering the waistband of his underwear and resting lightly on his thighs. "I said fuck
He left his room to find Cas, but he found Sam first. Sam raised an eyebrow, and Dean didn’t need freaky demonic psychic powers to know that his little brother was very much judging him.
Oh, shit. "Fuck, I'm sorry."
“Okay,” Dean said to himself as they approached the floor scale. “I just gotta turn this thing on, and then it’s smooth sailing.”
"No need," Cas mumbled, leaning against the other door, his legs tangled with Dean's and a distinct wet spot on the crotch of his pants.
During the first few weeks of practice, before their games started, Cas continued to steal glances at Dean from his vantage point on second base. He’d look at the way Dean squatted down a bit right before his windup, they way it made his ass strain against the seat of his tight pants. He’d study the way Dean’s soft sides sloped over his waistband, and the way he’d stretch his arms over his head, making his already snug jersey strain even more, the little buttons practically begging to break free.
"Sure, what the hell,” Dean said. “But we need to clean up first, and I should definitely change.”
Cas made a hopeful noise, his hands working at his stomach in an attempt to ease the pain. He was making up for eighteen years of sugar deprivation, eighteen years of living under his parents' roof. He didn't resent his parents, not really; he just knew that they were wrong about food (or hoped they were, at least). And, if Cas ended up in Hell, at least Dean would be there with him.
Grunting unattractively, Dean managed to pull the fabric over his belly. It was a little loose in the shoulders and tight in the waist, but it was a huge improvement over his previous shirt, even if the solid color did nothing to hide his dumb nipples. Dean stood and tucked the polo into his pants, buttoned up below his gut, and smoothed a hand over the material, looked in the mirror. This was the first time he’d worn real clothes without any shape wear. It didn’t look totally horrible. He had obvious love handles and a belly and the shirt creased a bit under his chest, but he didn’t look sloppy. Just heavy. Still wouldn’t want to go to work like this, but that was a whole ‘nother can of worms.
"Cas," he responded, fingers still wrapped around the glass.
Dean’s shape wear arrived the next day, and he was a little embarrassed to find that he needed a tank and the belt to hide the majority of his thick belly. Still, he looked a lot skinnier, and his suspenders actually did their job for once because his pants were now a bit loose. His shirts also fit better, the buttons no longer straining to stay closed. It was harder to breathe, and Dean found that sitting down put quite a lot of pressure on his lower stomach, but it was worth it, because Dean Smith was starting to look like his old self again.
Christmas with the Winchesters was just as amazing as Thanksgiving had been, full of hot chocolate and cookies and egg nog and more. Castiel got three new sets of uniform clothes from the Winchester family (which Mary gave him with a wink, making Cas blush furiously), a hefty check from his parents, and two pairs of suspenders that were just from Dean, plus a few other odds and ends. He'd never thought of wearing suspenders instead of a belt, but Westfield's dress code
"I-" Dean choked out, mind stuttering to a halt. He hadn't had a one night stand for... two years now? He was turning forty-one in a few months, for fuck's sake - he was way too old for this.
“That,” he said, not even trying to stifle the gigantic belch that followed, “was awesome.”
Holy shit, this night just kept getting better and better.
Somewhere in the middle of his fifth week alone, Dean was napping on the couch (yes, they'd finally bought one) when the slam of the bunker door woke him up. He sat up quickly, disoriented, and was face to face with Cas and Sam. Oh crap. He'd forgotten they were getting back today.
Dean for a little while. But he'd never expected Dean to change so much in those three months. Physically, at least.
And Dean liked it too, if his increased staring was anything to go by. Cas rocked his hips as he walked to the table, making sure to put a little extra bounce in his step, all so Dean had more to look at. He sat down heavily in his chair and spread his legs a bit, something he'd been doing lately, as his belly mounded uncomfortably high in his lap if he did not.
"If it is him, I will call you," Cas said stiffly. "In the meantime," he tilted his head, meaningfully, "I think you're needed here."
"We, uh," Sam cleared his throat and tried again. "Asa was a friend of a friend." He waved a hand towards Jody.
"This is a seed of a soul," Cas ranted, "just like any newly conceived embryo. It could become anything. Just because it has more power doesn't mean it is destined for anything specific! You are not defined by
Dean shrugged. "I don't think Mom's quite ready for Snapchat."
Sam looked up at him with surprise but continued talking about what he had found. "It's uh, not so much." He held up a typed letter, the majority of which was blacked out or covered in red stamps.
"Can you do anything for Sam? He's pretty messed up."
It was a deeply vulnerable adventure that left them all quiet but feeling safe in their mutually assured emotional destruction. Everyone took it as the end of the party, and those who did sleep all found beds.
"What?" Dean and Charlie exclaimed together.
Dean had to put a hand over his mouth to muffle his laughter again. "Ok, your next alias is going to be Rick Astley. You have no choice."
Dean couldn't. He opened his mouth, but a lifetime of smoothing things between John and others made it impossible for him to make things messy.
"Me, too," Dean replied. "But, I mean, she's just working out the kinks of being back. And just for once, I don't want to make this into a problem. For once, can't we just have one good thing!"
There was some discussion about where Charlie should set up her base, but eventually, everyone agreed that everything should be put in the map room. That way, she could set her modern computers up on one of the desks to the left of the library entrance. Hopefully, she could eventually find a way to hack into the original map table technology. However, she claimed the mix of analog, digital, and magical made everything a nightmare.
He heard her call for him, but he headed for the door anyway and she and Sam didn't stop him. Jody and Charlie did, though. They pounced right at the door, blocking his way.
"Hey!" Sam finally found his voice. "I barely even remember any of that. Between the smashed wall and Cas taking the crazy away, it's sort of blurry, thank Chuck."
"How do you know all that?" Sam asked. It was his turn to be in awe. "Most people just think Satan is a big demon if they believe anything at all."
"Kelly. Kelly, what's wrong?"
Cas was trying to call his contact back. "Ugh. Tommy's still not answering."
Dean Winchester?"
." Magda hugged herself, and Dean bit back the scolding he was about to give.
"Hey, you ok?"
"That's great!" Charlie exclaimed.
They headed out a few minutes later with a box of case files. Dean was trying to hold his feelings together and was thankful to be out of that
The voice on the other end sighed. "
Kelly protested weakly, "Jeff's been under a lot of stress. He..."
A black SUV pulled up beside the Impala and turned on flashing lights.
"Okay, family meeting time!" Dean and Cas went to pull in everyone while Crowley went to talk Rowena into joining the team. It took a few minutes to find everyone, but soon they were all there, crowded around and on top of the library tables.
"I do."
"What?" Sam seemed confused.
"Well, I got burgers. Sam and Charlie are setting Mary up in an apartment in town and then they'll come home. I need to get laundry started and take a shower before they get home because they'll probably want to meet you guys and talk and sh- stuff."
Cas stage-whispered to Sam, "I think you are correct. Dean does seem to be cranky." Dean glared at Cas, who ignored him and got into the backseat. The brothers got in as well. Cas continued as Dean started the car. "I don't believe Beth is a real witch anyway." They glanced back at him curiously. "A vanilla candle with a pentacle drawn on it is not likely to do much for adding positive energy to a room. She would be better off burning sage and placing the correct crystals or salt in the corners. I don't think she has the skill to do what was done to Olivia Sanchez."
"I uh." He stammered, pushing his phone back into his pocket. He had been trying to get a signal to call his brother for the past hour. "Are you..really... really?"
"Well, it helps that he's not in D.C.," Charlie said, typing on the laptop sitting on her bent knees. "He's actually on a fundraising swing through the Midwest, so that's actually some pretty awesome luck for us."
"Nah, fully safe," said a voice behind him. "I homebrewed it myself." Dean turned to find a red-haired man with a buzzcut and a beard in red plaid flannel rolled up his forearms. "Here," he said, taking the bottle from Dean, "not a twist-off." He used the bottle opener tied around his neck to open the beer.
Dean didn't really want Cas talking to her either and seeing her wounds. "Cas, stay here. Keep an eye on him." He pointed at Crowley.
"Yeah, guarded like the Hope Diamond. Plan C?" Sam asked.
"What about us?" Magda said quietly.
"No, no, you're making it up. It's impossible." Kelly argued nervously, looking for an exit.
"But, you know, things aren't all bad. We had dad, and then friends after he-" Oh, no, now she was crying.
"To track down Magda's ghost," Sam said like it was obvious. "Dean. Those people let their daughter die! She's angry and wants revenge!"
. Dean had hurt his own best friend enough to know the guilt of it, and he couldn't even conceive of treating Cas's body like this man had done to his friend's.
Bunker Organizing:
Cas motioned to them from beside a cellar window. He was standing carefully beside it, and Dean came over to speak to him. Sam knelt to peek into the window.
Jody just breathed out a soft "wow." And then and excited one. "Wow!" She let go of Charlie and threw her arms around Mary. "It is so nice to meet you!" Mary looked stunned. Jody drew back to arm's length to get a good look at her and just gasped. "Wow!"
"That's not what I mean."
He had woken from the best sleep he had ever had. There had been zero nightmares either of the typical in-your-sleep type or the more physical kind that with the territory of hunting literal monsters and was the reason he kept a gun under his pillow and silver and iron knives in the nightstand. And why most of his bedroom decor could kill people.
"And how would you know that?" Dean asked though he felt hypocritical even as the words came out.
Sam seemed confused but kept walking without responding to either of them. They had to hurry to catch up as he approached the farmhouse. Dean tried to grab his arm, but a man came off the porch to greet them before he could say anything to his brother.
Now Dean glared at the angel. He was very uncomfortable having a teenager who could read thoughts living in the bunker with them. At Magda's strangled giggle, he put his face in his hands.
"Yeah, but maybe- what, no, ok- fine!" He put the phone on speaker and laid it on the table.
" came a fancy British accent. "
Sam looked at Mary curiously. "Did you cut your hair?"
Dean listened on the phone while Cas tied Abraham up in the Barn.
She spoke before he could back out of the room. "Dean said you got out of hunting."
He had to admit, Cas certainly looked more like a priest than Sam did. Dean looked at his brother's long hair with exasperation. It had almost blown their cover multiple times as FBI agents since it was so obviously out of regulations. But today, the typical ties and badges were stowed, and they had brought out the black shirts and white collars of the priesthood.
"Then," she said to Billie, "I guess you're just gonna have to wait."
Sam was looking conflicted too. "I know what she means, though, Dean. It's like, she isn't in this part of the story or something."
"Eyy!" Bucky yelled, "Our famous friend said the magic words. Drink up!"
Sam and Cas were not here. Everything was upside down.
Magda had been extremely quiet and withdrawn since her rescue. She agreed to any plan they made and rarely put an opinion out. She tended to disappear from rooms that they were all gathered in, and it would be ages before anyone noticed. Her psychic training had been going terribly because she seemed too frightened to reach out towards anyone at all since learning of the two people she had accidentally killed. She mostly sat in her room and studied quietly.
"I don't understand," Mary said. "John?"
Amish. You never listen to me."
Dean nodded and met Mary's eyes again. "I want to be clear. I don't want to manipulate you into coming home. I'm not going to beg, and Sam won't either. I won't give you a sob story about Magda and Elijah or tell you that we can't figure it out without you. We can. I'm not going to put you in a corner. You don't have to come back, and we won't cut you out if you don't.
house?"
"Plural vessels?" Dean asked, "As in, not just baby Claire?"
"Dean! Are you hurting? What's wrong?"
"Not at all," Ketch replied. "We're good dogs. We only come when called. And
"Yeah," Dean huffed. "Apparently, we're a little bit legendary."
"Because I've heard stories about her. And she can hold her own. And yeah, I lost last time, but this is a new day. Don't you dare start getting sexist on me again."
"Shut up. Just take Missouri and Charlie. I'll pray to Cas once they have us locked up, and we'll start planning a rescue, okay? Oh, and... Missouri, tell him I'm sorry, okay?"
"You can do that?" She asked, hopefully.
Dean shrugged as he guided the group towards the entrance, "She is human, but she's a psychic. It's a bit confusing. Sam and I are the normal ones." Cas followed them, having finished the clean-up job. He touched Hugo's shirt and cleaned it as well.
"Okay," Cas nodded. "I explode things sometimes, too."
"Dean..." Cas tilted his head in confusion.
"So is that yours?" Dean pointed at the candle.
Dean laughed hollowly. "So we couldn't flip a single member of Vince's team. Even with the threat of mass murder, these SoCal douchebags won't do the right thing." He rubbed his hand over his eyes.
It took Dean a moment to realize what was happening, but the heavy metal cross on the table was lifting and floating. Ok, he thought, cool, psychic.
"I don't know what else to do!" She said urgently, "Charlie is still too nervous about being away from you guys and would be a nightmare the whole time you were gone. Cas would be freaking out because he wasn't helping. Sam goes where you go. Are you going to sit this one out to stay with us? And Elijah's right; we can't leave the bunker again, not with so many people I could hurt out there and so much chaos to mess us up. There are no other options here, Dean!"
Smashing sounds echoed from the basement, and he was distracted. The ghost turned and walked towards the hall. Dean was able to get the iron chain and wrap it around Mary's body, pinning Moriarty in place. He groaned and fought, but Dean held on with everything he had.
"Did he hurt you? Did you get away?" Sam asked urgently
"So, other than the eight-hundred-pound gorilla, got any ideas?"
"Oh," he said in surprise. "Yes." He stood and paced away, then turned earnestly to Dean. You were right."
He sighed and waited until Dean met his eyes again. "It isn't the burden of all social workers, though. They are not monsters. They have a mission, much like your own, to save children from harm. That is a righteous thing."
"Lady Bevell is a bit... excitable," Ketch said.
Dean gestured for him to go around the house, and Dean stayed to watch over Sam. The EMF wasn't picking up anything, especially since there were no power lines to give even false positives.
"Anyway's, he's the devil now?" Sam asked.
"Excuse me-"
He bent over to drop the gun onto the floor but kept the light steady on Lady Bevell's face. A gunshot went off above his head, and the British woman dropped lifelessly to the floor.
Cas nodded. "Okay, so what now?"
"I think I may have a lead on Lucifer. I found a police report in Cleveland about a man whose eyes flared a glowing red." He spread his arms in a shrug. "It could be Lucifer in a new body."
