“I just got the idea that the prince wanted to make sure I would be with him for the week, but didn’t he already reserve it?” Steve asks.
He couldn’t shake the feeling of inadequacy as well as the thought that he might be too big for his own body. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I don’t know what to do. I haven’t been with a guy.”
is, but the again he doesn't have to. "The other women in the neighborhood shunned her, said things about her behind her back. Sometimes not behind her back. But not Ma. She would invite her over for Sunday dinner even though we didn't have much. They'd come and we'd all eat, talk, laugh. It was fun. It was something good. I didn't understand until I grew a little older. Until she was long gone with her baby. But Ma only saw her as someone who needed and wanted to help."
Tony finds his hand, bare of the gauntlet (and when did he do that) rubbing Steve’s bruised shoulder, as he encourages him with tender words.  “I’m getting you out of here, now. No one can hurt you.”
“Not great farmland because of the mountains. There’s sheep, lots of it. Cattle ranchers hate sheep because they strip the land of grass roots. So what’d you come here for, the sheep?” His words are lascivious but somehow not cruel.
“So-.” Tony stopped and tilted his head as he studied Steve. The firelight flashed over his face, glowing gold. “So you would consider it?”
“No. Just wanted to ask a question.” Now that he has her on the comms, he feels a little silly. Clearing his throat, he says, “Have you ever heard of nanites for prep and lube?”
Thor turned saturnine. He bowed his head and then said, “You must understand your responsibilities. Just as I have come to understand my own.” He faced Steve. “I have come to know that I cannot leave Asgard and the Realms without a protector. My father sits on a precarious throne. While I shun the throne, Ragnorak, the end of all things, will be upon us and I am destine to try and stop it. Yet, I sit here and protect only Midgard. Am I the protector I should be? Have I lost my way for the love of one woman?”
Walking to the steel door, he analyzes it, plays with the locks. “You’re not going to find a way out through there.”
“Enough to give up your family?” That sounded repugnant to Steve. He wanted to take it back, but he couldn’t.
in his direction stared with orbless eyes at him. He turned away, as much as he could considering the collar around his neck, fixing him to the cross.
Pep raises a brow at him and waits. She always looks like she’s up to something. “So, I’ll assign Omega Steven as Master of Security. Should I have him outfitted as such and assigned to the Master’s quarters?”
“Sit, Captain,” T’Challa offered and then went to a counter near windows. He poured two glasses of juice and handed one to Steve as he sat oppose Steve in the highbacked cushioned chair. “Your country is in turmoil.”
Steve agrees if only to relieve some of the stress etched across the prince’s features. In only takes five minutes for Tony to get dressed and ready to go. He’s in his less formal uniform and slicked his hair back with fingers through it. He offers Steve a quick peck on the cheek and then leaves with a plea for Steve to eat and rest.
“I will need to teach you how to reach out to one another. It will take a more purposeful connection. Right now, you know one another but you do not see one another – not as paired souls see one another.” Frigga turns to Natasha and Gamora. “You’ll have to send the message to the Soul Keeper of the Red Knight’s offer for peace.”
“I’m not a Captain anymore, I retired my commission. I’m the Sheriff now,” Steve says and it sounds trite and small even to his ears. He doesn’t know why he keeps driving this point home.
When Sam looked between Steve and Tony and his frown deepened, Steve said, “He’s usually very intelligent. I swear. But the last few weeks have been -.”
“But if you remember this-?” Tony indicated the tent and the supplies to thaw him all piled up in the corners of the tent.
Steve stood there, panting with his hand on his chest and his head bowed. Tony crossed the distance between them. Steve glanced up at him, his eyes only offered a remote haunted look that plagued him earlier.
Tony reviews the armor, all the pieces and realizes this is his chance. It might be his only chance once Raza comes back. It is also Steve's only chance. They haven't practiced anything, they don't have a synchronized plan, but they have to improvise with what they have. Tony steps into the armor and Steve starts to bolt it into place, following Tony's instructions and the blue prints laid out on the workbench.
“Well, as CEO I don’t see how that’s even an issue anymore. It’s not temporary Pepper, I told you that. I need someone to pay attention to the administration and logistics. I’m a scientist and idea man. You know that.” Tony bops her on the nose. She bats him away.
“You know that Estane declared his own rights as an alpha,” Jamison says as he checks the command station holographic display. “He’s going to challenge you on the floor of the Council for controlling interest.”
Tony doesn’t turn toward him which is odd because Steve found he has an innate ability to hone right the center of conversation without any assistance at all. He sighs audibly and Steve thinks it’s for his benefit. “I know. It’s been a long time since someone new learned I’m blind. It takes adjusting to – that’s all.”
Ignoring the tears prickling his eyes, Steve brushed Tony’s hair back from his face, kissed his temple and then his mouth. “You’re okay. You’re okay.”
“I get that. The monitors read normal sleep patterns, but his brain is acting like he’s in a coma,” Bruce says. “They would like to do a PET scan of his brain. See if there’s something there.”
“What the fuck?” That’s all he manages. “This is what you think of me? That after a frank, and open conversation I would punish you?” He knows, recognizes, fucking understands that he’s caned Steven for less. He’s not been consistent at all. This was supposed to be about him turning over a new leaf, finding a way they could exist together, forge a different relationship. “How can you fucking fight for me when this is what you think of me?”
Boarding his private jet later that night, Pepper nuzzled up to Tony. After a quiet dinner and wine, they ended up in the bedroom in the back of the jet. He fucked her with new enthusiasm as if he was a man who’d seen his death and it stalked him. To his needy lovemaking, she gave back exactly what he needed as she always did. When he thought he would go crazy with the need to finally finish but something deeply seeded inside of him prevented it – Pepper knew what to do. She whispered in his ear and then slipped a lubed finger up his ass and he exploded into her like a teenaged boy fucking for the first time.
“You know what they say about good intentions, right?” Tony says but his words are light and soft like the breezes kissing the trees. He squeezes Steve’s hand. “I know, Steve. I’m sorry too. I overreacted the first day. I shouldn’t have. This is a big adjustment for me.”
“Captain.” The word strikes a chord and he startles. “We all know your identity here. We thought it would be best to offer you someone who is paid to be discreet, knows what he’s doing, and will treat you well.”
Tony opened his hands and the emptiness ate at him, made him exposed and vulnerable. “I have to follow his lead. He is the leader. If he invites me to be more than a friend, I’ll do it. Happily.”
“What a donkey? A pack animal?” Tony says and maintains his flight toward the village. He will not have these asswipes bothering the locals. He’s here to clean out Ten Rings, not make things worse for the innocents. The defense departments are the world do enough of that crime.
“Not that I know of. He’s not due until tomorrow, right?” Happy shifted from foot to foot. “I only got animal blood, boss. I can put in another order-.”
“The contract: does it have a clause it in that says you can book me if the prince isn’t engaged?” Steve hisses. Any minute now he’s going to quit like the idiot he is. Bucky’s voice appears in his head telling him not to blow the only chance he has in getting any medical augmentation at all. He inhales and exhales a few times, trying to calm down.
Steve glances at Tony quickly and then back at the mirror twin of himself. The trio – Steve, Natasha, and Bucky are not here to invite them to a welcoming party. His twin is slightly off, different. His features are too perfect, his eyes far too blue. His uniform is crisp and clean, his hair perfectly coiffed. His jaw is razor sharp. His features sculpted from a Greek God. He looks nothing like Steve, but is his twin nonetheless.
Steve snarls at him, “It wouldn’t be messy at all if you didn’t interfere. It was fine. I made the deal-.”
Steve only bites his cheek and pushing on, walking past Happy to get to the lounge that the luncheon had been held in earlier in the day. The station is quiet now; it’s officially night time hours. Though many of the inhabitants on Prime don’t adhere to the standard hours, some do and the crowds usually thin out. It’s no exception tonight, only a few scattered groups of people pass them.
Bruce frowns but lets it pass. “Steve, before you go-.” He stops and his expression tightens. “Just be careful. We’re not used to playing with the big dogs. Not the likes of us. Just be careful. I-I got involved with a General’s daughter once and the results weren’t good. At all. I’m still paying for it.”
He towels dry. Slipping into his sweats and t-shirt with a hoodie, he finger combs his hair and doesn’t take the time to shave.  He should try more, but right now he doesn’t give a fuck. When he finally summons the courage to go downstairs and join Steve, the aroma of stew fills the air along with freshly baked bread.
“Yes, I did. Erskine made the serum, I made the catalyst to get the serum to work,” Howard said and pulled some of the schematics back onto the table. “It was a fairly simplistic design considering it was the 40s.”
Luke eyes Steve with an arched brow but he nods as he turns to the prince. “Titles don’t mean much in my shop. As long as you understand that, I think we’ll get along.”
“What? Gay marriage?” Tony frowns. “Yep. I told you about the legal case. It opened the door wide open for gay marriage.”
"You talk in flowery language, sir." Tony's hands on his knees burn and he wants nothing more but to jump up and race away, but that isn't true. No. It isn't true at all. He holds back, fists his hands not to grab Tony and jerk him up and plaster his lips against that arrogant mouth. The flame of the candle flickers in Tony’s eyes.
Tony grips his shoulder and – for one moment – his eyes grow serious and solemn. “Let me do this Steve. You need to heal.”
“You can’t, please,” he says and the idea, the very thought that his own decision on his health and well-being have been stolen from him hits worse than the pain tiding over him. “Don’t.”
The last thing Steve sees is the Red Skull screaming and dissipating into a fine black dot of nothingness. The last thing he feels is Tony’s kiss upon his lips and a whisper of goodbye….
Taking out her stethoscope, she places it in her ears and leans over to listen to his heart. It is the first time he notices he’s not wearing a shirt, but he is wearing simple pajama bottoms. He tries not to think about who put him in them.
was one of Steve’s most powerful trigger words. Just a whisper of that word sent him into subspace, deep and abiding for hours. A pleasure filled needy mindspace. Tony reserved the word for times he felt Steve needed it, for times after battle when the adrenaline rush was too high and the tension in his shoulders too taut. To ease it all, Tony would guide Steve to their home and bathe him, wash his hair, and then lay him out on the bed. He would use the word and then let him fall.
Steve licked his lips. He’d never truly thought about it. Introspection wasn’t one of his hobbies. He’d rather keep busy, do the mission, make himself useful. “I don’t know? I mean I was attracted to Peggy, but-.” He never really considered it, before now.
Steven drops to his hands and knees, legs spread and mouth open. Tony goes to his special drawer and pulls out the largest of his mechanical dildos and attaches it to the mobile arm of the rack. He takes a moment to appreciate the omega in his submissive pose. It’s beautiful and set him on fire inside. This is true bonding, submission at its greatest art form.
Steve finds his boxers on the floor next to the bed, scoops them up, and manages to shimmy into them under the blanket. He gets out of bed. He hates that everything Tony does is under the microscope, more so than it used to be ever since the interview with Christine Everhart and her series. She’s been an ally but at the same time Tony’s biggest critic.
“Are we going to do this or are you going to stand there and continue to insult my life choices?” Steve said and waited. He didn’t really have much more to pack – his life could be contained in a box and a duffle bag if he was honest with himself.
Before Steve knows what’s happening, they’re kissing. He’s not sure who moved first or initiated it, but something deep inside releases as if all this time he’d been carrying around a weight inside and now it’s gone, allowing him to breath.
Tony cradles Steve to him but then the larger man shifts and stands, but never breaks the kiss. He wraps Tony in his arms, and then lifts him off the chair. It’s all kind of bodice ripping front cover of an old romance novel carry, but Tony doesn’t care. He’s in Steve’s arms, and it feels natural, right, and so very hot.
She leaves and Steve stares at his closet. His clothes are the finest that the station has to offer. The Cage is very exclusive, and he’s heard it carries all of the most recent fashions from the Inner Regions. While he considers this a ping alerts him to an incoming call. He taps his implant.
She lays a hand on his shoulder. “That’s why Happy, James, and I are working so hard to make sure he has something to come home to.”
“No. Not soldiers. We wouldn’t be soldiers. We would be Earth’s Mightiest Heroes, the Avengers.” He chuckles to himself. “I always had a soft spot for Mother Earth. It was a stupid dream. I commissioned the ship right around the time the war broke out-.” He stops and glances at the guards around them. “But things change, times change. Plus, General Fury said I’m not a team player. So, we all turned into soldiers.”
Steve wanders out into the main room, his thoughts speeding ahead of him. Remembering the worn down hovel of the Brooklyn settlement, a cold ache chills him to the core. This is the wealth and riches always denied those in the Beyond Regions. Only in the last two months has he luxuriated in the warmth of regular showers, only in the last two months has his belly been full, only in the last two months has he had the funds to buy all the medicines his sickly body needs. Here there is an overabundance of everything. The whole bottom floor of the tenement Steve lived in could fit in his quarters on this ship. It astonished him and disgusted him.
“Prince Anthony, who are you?” Steve murmurs, realizing he utters the words out loud. Tony only gives him a jaunty smile and then brings him back up into a spin and then draws him close again.
Steve was stoic. Steve had confessed that he wrapped all of his emotions deep inside of him. So, it wasn’t a surprise that even digging a little along the link brought up nothing. Yet the link wove and thickened. It felt stronger, brighter, more powerful if that was even the correct term.
Tony looks at him. Belief is not something that Tony ascribes to, he doesn’t mock those with belief but as a scientists, the idea is foreign and counterproductive. Sometimes, he wishes he believed like that – sometimes he can understand the words to
“Your own comic book? Your own creation?” Tony smiles and Steve sits up properly as if his acceptance means the world to Steve.
“Why don’t you sit down and rest. I’ll go ask Vision what’s going on. Okay?” Steve waits, so patiently for him that Tony feels a bit embarrassed. He manages to nod and then Steve has him settle back into the recliner. “I’ll be right back. Don’t move.”
“What’s the difference?” Tony asks. He’s walking close to Steve as if separating now would cause him pain.
“Just not now,” Tony said and tugged Steve along, leaving Natasha standing in the hallway. “Don’t worry. She has Thor and the whole of the covens at her beck and call. We can take a minute to rest.”
Tony rolled his eyes and sighed. “We could make this fun. Like use the bed, be like teenagers. Sweat it out a little.” When Steve only glared at him, Tony sighed again. “Fine, have it your way.” He closed his eyes. After a minute he muttered, “I feel silly.”
“And so, my personal assistant isn’t the best?” Tony narrows his eyes and lifts his chin. He’s daring and expectant. His words goad the man for a confrontation.
Before he knows it, Tony’s crossed the distance between them. Steve wraps him in his arms. Tony crushes his bruised and ruined face into Steve’s shoulder. He doesn’t realize it until he pulls away, but he’s crying. Deeply. Honestly.
Clint interrupted him. “Trying to acclimate?” He swung his legs over the side of the gurney. “We all seem to forget that you were frozen just two years ago and missed a crap load of stuff. Give yourself a break, Cap.”
He wonders if the lion will free himself, get away from the drug lords and terrorists. Does he have a duty to go back and save the poor beast? He’s not one to know morals and ethics. Animal cruelty is right up there with shitty things people do though. He knows that much. Going back right now, though, is an impossibility. He needs to find shelter and get back to his life. One day soon he might come back.
“JARVIS should learn to mind his own business,” Tony commented and then reality came into focus as the last vestiges of the dreamscape dissipated. “Steve! Steve? You have updates on Steve?”
It doesn’t surprise Tony when they climb back up the hill again, but this time it’s a milder slope. The terrain turns lush and verdant. Gone is the dusty rocky landscape, replaced by a thin cropping of trees with undergrowth, and, if Tony’s isn’t wrong, the sound of a brook or creek not far. Blu leads him to the small brook. It’s serene and pretty. It’s not a deep water source. If he waded in it, it would probably only come up to his knees at its deepest.
“That’s good to know. Thank you, Doctor,” Steve says and finds a seat. “I think we need to strap in now.”
Steve gestures for Natasha, who is waiting on the ramp of the newly retrofitted Commando, to show the Stark party into the ship. She nods but has a slightly downturned look to her expression. He reads it and signals her that he understands.
“Doesn’t matter right now. I have to pack up and get moving.” He goes to the water’s edge, careful of snakes. He washes the water over his face and in his hair but leaves it at that. No sense risking his life to have a bath. He finishes and heads back to the camp but notices that Steve’s sits staring at nothing but the middle distance. He trudges back and knocks him in the shoulder. The wall that formed between them is surprisingly thick and well formed in such a short time. They are strangers, really. “Come on. You want to get back to civilization, don’t you?”
Steve nuzzles against Tony’s neck, enough that he hitches his breath and arches into Steve.  “No, but there are consequences.” Steve kisses lightly and then tugs at Tony’s shirt, wanting to feel flesh against flesh.
“It feels so right, so how can it be wrong?” Steve said as Tony found himself sitting on the bed and Steve kneeling at his feet. “Tell me what to do. I don’t know what to do.”
“That’s a little more complicated.” He didn’t want to explain everything. The idea of losing her as a friend repulsed him. “Just stay off the streets after dark. Okay?” Especially at early twilight when the danger was the highest because vampires were at their hungriest.
Standing by the door, Steve tried to smile and at the same time show no aggressive action. He’d never been with an alpha – or anyone else. Being sickly all those years had pre-empted his heat, and when he had gone through a peri-heat he ended up alone in his flat for a day or so crazy and needy at the same time. As he stood there, Bucky stared at him with his lip curled up into a snarl.
“Oh, it’s not what you think,” Tony says and there’s a glint in his eyes. “I don’t know where you stowed your boy. I can guess where he might be but I don’t have jurisdiction and so, that will have to wait.”
“Don’t give me that shit,” Tony said. “You’re not going to stop hurting him if I promise to be good.”
Clint launched arrows into the field of robots as Sam rocketed into the air, guns at the ready. Steve crouched down, protecting Nat from the barrage of fire. Thunder cracked through the sky as rain suddenly broke from a cloudless day. Iron Man whizzed passed them but the fire power from the Legion blinded Steve as he expanded his soul to encompass all of his pack.
Steve considers him as if this is a hard deal to make. “Only if you tell me the real secret you’ve been hiding.”
“Huh?” Tony says. Steve peers around the area looking for what’s amused him. He explains, “Five bedrooms, six Avengers. I wonder who was going to share in Natasha’s mind.” She’s the one who planned this whole teambuilding exercise. Sure, Fury insisted on it, but it was Natasha who worked out the details after the whole Ultron fiasco.
Steve drops his gaze, feels the warm ball of heat deep inside. He smiles and wishes he could bear better news. “I won’t be able to, I have a commitment to go out and find Loki and Clint, my deputy.”
“Yes, here. Is there a problem? Are you embarrassed?” Tony takes his hand away and shifts as if to get out of the bed.
Steve beams. This is exactly what Tony needs. “No sucking up, no special treatment, just privacy on all fronts.”
“I need you to say you’re ready. I need to know you can hold on, not come. If you come you don’t get to have me,” Steve warns, and he splays his fingers one more time.
“Damn it, that doesn’t matter,” Steve says and the pain in his shoulder amplifies. He allows himself to drop into his chair.
Pepper smiles. “You gave it to me. Lord only knows why you would give someone deathly allergic to strawberries a blouse with embroidered berries on it.”
Strange settled again in the chair opposite Tony. “Your captain is only isolated because he is doing it to himself. Think of the time he came from – it was a time when men were stoic and didn’t deal with their feelings. As his Beloved, you need to bring him to the point where he will deal with it, where he recognizes his feelings, knows what they are, and accepts them.”
Steven grimaces. There’s treason in his eyes but he nods. Willingly he opens his mouth. Drool smears his lips. He cannot deny his nature after all. The gland responds to Tony, and thus Steven responds to him. They are connected by biology, by the chemistry seething through their veins. Seeing Steven in position, his mouth open and glistening with saliva hardens Tony and he quickly unzips his pants to release his cock. It hurts he is so hard.
“Yes, if you want. Otherwise we can just jump forward and give you the injection of the nanites once I’m sure I have the programming right,” Tony says. It’s not like disentangling particles is an easy task. Just an impossible one, and who said Tony Stark didn’t do the impossible ten times a day? “Then we inject the nanites and they do their job. You’ll be free of him. Part of the procedure will actually tell us if it’s real or not. The nanites will be harmless to you, and should only affect the resonance. If it works, the connection is lost. If it doesn’t, well we have a different and perhaps psychological issues on our hands.”
Tony puts his weight on both feet and stands up. “Because I can’t see right?” Tony points to the digital art set up. “You’ll digitize everything. You can draft and sketch to your heart’s content on the table, but you’ll need to digitalize it. Then my computer set up, called Friday, will transfer those images to the set up you saw me using in the main lab. I can manipulate it and change it, revise it to what I need. Then you need to make the changes so that we can fabricate it.”
The edge of panic curls around Tony like whispers of darkness at the periphery of his sight. He knows what it feels like to be on the verge. He understands it more intimately than he wants to admit. Carefully, he reaches out and grasps Steve’s hand. “Hey now. I’m here. You don’t have to worry about protecting me anymore.”
“You sound like you’re waiting for the guillotine.” Tony snickers and then takes a drink. “You know, I’m excited about this but also exhausted. Like I can’t believe that it was just yesterday that we went on the bike ride.”
“I spent time with the rebels as ordered by my alpha. I infiltrated their ranks and spent time as one of their compatriots. I pledged the oath to them during the Uprising.”
“Trust you? I don’t even know you.” Jarvis huffs. “The only reason I am even talking to you and telling you anything is that you’ve signed the non-disclosure. You can’t legally say anything. But know this, Captain Rogers.” Jarvis leans in. He shadows the windows to the outside. “Master Tony’s put his trust in you. If you break that trust, then it will be me you answer to. I will ensure that you will be very miserable, Captain Rogers, for the rest of your days.”
“Hey you snot. What the fuck? I heard you left Brooklyn for Prime? How the hell did you manage that? You better not be getting yourself into trouble. Did you get Pierce to sponsor you as an artist on the station? That would be a sweet gig!”
“Let’s settle down,” Steve said and spread out his arms to keep everyone at bay. “You know that Bucky is not responsible. You’ve said it yourself.”
He sat up in bed, trying not to disturb Pepper as she slumbered beside him. Slipping from under the duvet, Tony padded across the floor of their bedroom and found his way to the main bar in the living room of his Malibu mansion. After the Battle of New York, Tony couldn’t stay in the Tower. He spent hours with Pepper planning the remodel, but finally succumbed to his need to be back in his home. Being home in California for a while provided him with sanctuary, but something still tugged him, inside. He pretended (even to himself) that it had nothing to do with not being chosen for the pack. He wanted to feel the warmth of the Pacific breezes again. Somewhere he could hide away and pretend the whole thing (New York or the soul pack) never happened. Yet, he shuddered awake with either dreams of a void, an abyss of nothing, or a need, a hunger so rich and deep that he barely managed to breathe. It felt like part of him had been halved.
He yelps and jerks backward as Tony goes into a convulsive fit. His eyes roll up in his head and his whole body seizes.
Steve smiled and closed his eyes. He wasn’t sure how long he slept – probably less than an hour, but he blinked awake to find Clint sipping water but still on high alert. Steve sat up and asked, “Any more of that water?”
“Twenty percent,” Tony says and slumps down in a chair. He pushes his fingers under his glasses and into his sightless eyes. His voice is mumbled, and Steve feels the heartache, the pain, and the promise all wrapped into it. “That’s all. I could gain some of my sight back or nothing and have to live like this.” He pulls off his glasses. “I can’t do it, Strange. I can’t.”
“But someone has to, Tony. You’ve made this big charade for years. Who do you think follows after you and cleans up when things get messy? How many times has Christine gotten close? So many you would be surprised.” She’s crying now and he hates it. He’s put that rock, that world on her shoulders, forced her to carry it up the hill over and over again. “You need to be kept safe and Steve didn’t-.”
“No,” Tony answered back the same word that Steve had used. “No. You are alive, and you are well. The universe didn’t call on Captain America, the universe called on Steve Rogers.”
“The Commando isn’t really fitted for a large party,” Tiberius replies, he’s practically in Tony’s face.
Tony leaned down and kissed Steve. It was more clinical than passionate. His mind still juddered along, analyzing and evaluating. Steve read him too well. He flipped Tony over and pulled back.
He puts a hand up. “I get it. We’re not really husbands. But we did still share something remarkable.”
Steve scoffs at Fury and then pulls up the assignment list once more. “What can I do for you, director?”
Steve doesn’t reply to the flirtation, but Pepper does. “Please ignore him. He flirts with everyone, including the Roomba.”
Steve nods. “Yeah. Everything was. The moment I came out of that pod, I took a breath and it didn’t hurt. I could walk up a flight of stairs without getting lightheaded. I could swim. It was phenomenal.” He finishes his four eggs over easily with six slices of toast on the side. “It was a miracle what your dad and Doctor Erskine did.”
Those last words depleted him of his rage until it only simmered under the surface. “Why? What did he do? What’s going on?” When her gaze dropped, and her hands followed, Steve knew she’d curled in on herself, closing up. She wrapped her arms around herself. So unlike the Natasha he knew, that he thought she either played with him or feared his reaction to the truth.
“Steve, Steve!” Tony grabbed for him, holding Steve’s head in place as he pushed further down his throat.  In response, Steve swallowed around the thick head of Tony’s cock feeling his throat try and lock up around it. Tony quaked as Steve swallowed again and again.
“When I walk into the room, you are to get on your knees. This isn’t the first time I told you -.” He’s brimming with anger, trying to keep it hinged and controlled.
“You could have at least changed it for Barnes,” Tony whispers and there’s an edge in his tone that implies the consequences of that decision.
He dismisses Steven to go and clean up as well as dress for the day. They have a long and difficult day in front of them. Steven leaves him, exiting to the omega rooms to the side of the presentation suite. Tony plans on keeping only Steven as his omega, though other family head alphas have been known to keep more omegas – one warrior and several drones for use. The alphas in his clan have omega drones or warriors of their own, all of which would be put to use if a war ever broke out, though Tony doubts the fabled omega warrior rage would be of much use in the age of Court Vessels and fleets of warrior ships.
He cups his face in his hands and tries to wish away the last few months. Yet, he knows it won’t work. Nothing he’s tried has changed things. Not even the letter. He can recite it by heart.
“You seemed to have taken up where you left off.” That was cruel. He hissed at himself. “Sorry, I don’t even know if that’s true or not.”
“Well, many don’t survive it when they are so close these days,” Fury states. “Back in the day it wasn’t as bad, but now it’s worse. A lingering after effect of the genetic era.”
The ride down to the ground floor isn’t long and Steve presses his lips tight, he wants to ask Tony what’s next. He stares at the floors clicking off. It doesn’t take long, but it drags out when the doors open, and he has no answers from Tony.
A little chuckle of air and Tony feels the rustle of Steve shaking his head. “Nope. That’s not it. Just relax. I’m going to touch you now, mainly your head and temples. Maybe a little of your shoulders and neck.”
“God, don’t do that or I’ll come right now,” Steve said and the words encompass Tony with such affection and love he’s pliant and open. “So open, Tony. Tony.” He keeps muttering his name and working him open with more lube and another finger.
Tony sighed. “Steve, open your eyes. I swear this isn’t going to hurt. What would you like me to do?” He waited as Steve looked at him and panted a little. “I want you, but I don’t know. I don’t know what men actually
Sorry for the long delay. My RBB is finished and posted (phew). And now I am back to my real love - this story. I hope to get the next chapter up by June 17. I hope you enjoyed this chapter!
The Silver Knight lowers his shield. As he lays it on the ground, he reaches in his boot to slide out a jeweled dagger. He has no hope of taking on the Red Knight. Before he’s even close the gap between them the Outriders would swarm him and kill him. He has no doubts about that – there is one thing he can do – one way to take himself out of the equation.
“The records don’t show whether or not they stayed together. Though there’s indications that Stark had a child. But nothing clear,” Steven says. But his voice falters as he talks about it. As if something bothers him about the history. Tony can only guess. Back then, the ideas that each of the castes were equal ran rampant through most of the society. Civilization experimented with the equal protections and prospects for all. It ruined things in the end.
Natasha takes in a deep breath and then releases it. “The client is Prince Anthony Stark. He’s coming to Prime for a conference on the state of the war. He’s requested an Escort for the entire time he’s at the station.”
When it was time, he put on his cufflinks and his black silk tie. Tony went across the hall and knocked on Steve’s door. It swung open to Steve with his own suit with white shirt and his wrecked expression that took Tony’s breath away. The pain hadn’t leaked through the bond and that only meant that Steve spent a ton of energy trying to protect the rest of the pack from his upset. Not having any of that shit, Tony moved into the room and took Steve into his arms. For a second, Steve didn’t react but then he wrapped his arms around Tony.
“Can you find something to ward off the cold from the hole in the side of the jet? Might help keep what little heat this gives off in.”
Steve wants to take him to task for the remark, but he lets it slide.  He knows in his heart Bucky only has the best of intentions when it comes to Steve’s welfare. “I’ll tell you what, you know I can’t run the Rails with you, but maybe I’ll come to a few of the runs, watch, and check things out.”
Tony laughs, full and bright and the light streams into the room all around him at the moment like a burst directly from the sun. “I promise you, Captain, I am anything but the devil.”
As they walked out onto the rooftop, the Quin Jet readied for take-off. Tony recalled how very perfect Pepper had been, how she tried everything to make him happy, how his soul embers were burnt and ash. When he glanced at Steve as they walked up the ramp to the jet, all Tony could think of was those frayed ends of his soul that had tangled and knotted to Steve. How the darkness within laid the foundation for the bond between them.
Maybe it wasn’t, but Steve still wanted Tony’s body close to him, wanted to share the joys of surrender and love with him. Giving Tony blood and offering his life became Steve’s mantra. Tony – so young as a vampire – yet with old eyes. Eyes of someone who had been betrayed as a human and seen his parents’ funerals too young. Eyes that shifted between the darkest brown to the lightest azure blue. Every moment those eyes landed on Steve, shared a glance or a gaze with Steve, were precious to him. The stars were nothing to Tony’s eyes.
That was when he stumbled to the doorway to the ensuite bathroom and clutched the frame with his hand. He closed his eyes and felt the throbbing ache. “Steve?” He felt it then, the openness, the raw wound. The soul pack was bleeding and their leader rudderless. “Where’s Steve? Right now, where’s Steve?”
“Yes,” Pepper says and her looks is far away, almost lost. “He remembers as Ultron would, what happened. Can you imagine, Commander, how terrifying that would be?”
Part of Steve’s ashamed, because Tony’s artful in his techniques of giving fellatio. And that’s what it is fellatio – Steve gives blow jobs, not this – not this feeling that centers all of Steve’s blood and nerves at his groin.
Steve allows the moment to pass but stores it away because it’s something he needs to know about Tony. As he takes his place next to Tony, Steve directs the way toward The Cage and by the time they get there the prince has relaxed a degree. He decides at least that’s a small win and brings Tony over to meet Luke.
“Which is his cover, his fake name that all Service members have to have when they go under cover in case they need extraction. He’s given it to you because you won’t let him go.” Tony turns on his heel to Rhodey again. “Isn’t that right?”
“She’d understand. I know she would,” Bucky said. “It’s the way of the alphas and omegas. You seen ‘em. Hell, you see it in the rich people, they walk around with their omegas on leashes.” Steve had gone pale at that one and Bucky only laughed and slapped him on the shoulder. “Oh, I’d only do that to you if you were getting beat up in alley ways again.”
The words clench tight in Steve’s groin and he growls out his release as he shoots over Tony’s face hitting him on the cheeks, in his open mouth, dripping down his tongue. He feels animalistic but free as he milks himself dry, hitting Tony’s eyes and hair.
Clint whines in pain and then another figure appears at the top of the hill. It’s not who Steve wants or wishes. It’s Laura.
“Yeah, he’s not the only one,” Steve said. Any other assignment wouldn’t have hurt quite so much, but to have Peggy so quickly replaced jabbed hot pokers into his chest. He turned away from Tony as the tears stung his eyes. He’d done enough crying – he needed to get it under control.
He only nods and she leaves. As he lies in the bed, he feels a certain emptiness. His hands are strong but empty with no shield to grasp. His muscles are powerful but useless with no cause to fight. His heart aches.
“Getting worse. I can only wear the glasses for about 4 hours.” Steve’s surprised that Tony admitted that little factoid so easily. “I really need you to upgrade the implant. Steve and I are-.”
Steve nods and then releases all of his hold on his hope to change things. He cannot. This is who he is now. This is his presentation. He will never bond again. This is all he has. So he follows the alpha’s lead. The soft touch in his hair hardens as the man grabs him by the hair and drags him over to the rack. In short order, he hangs from the rack, shivering with both pleasure and a deep abiding inner hatred for himself.
She closes the space between them and reaches out, extending her hand to him. He waits a moment before accepting it. He’d been resigned to the idea that he might never be her friend, her teammate again, especially after her words in Berlin. She sided with Tony, she went with the Accords. For some reason, she wanted to take the path of least resistance, and he could respect that in some ways. She wanted to keep the team together because the team was the only family she’d ever had. He couldn’t do it. He couldn’t see releasing control over his own destiny, over his decision about what is good and what is bad to an organization that refused to prove itself, refused to layer in safeguards. He couldn’t do it, so he lost her.
Pepper whines but it’s not a cry, more like a whimper as she works on the removing the reactor. “Yeah, I’ve got it.”
Bruce nods and goes to grab his medical bag. He stows his supplies, leaving some out on the bureau for Steve to use. Snapping his bag closed, he picks it up and exits the room again. When he passes Steve in the hallway, he says, “Tony won’t wait forever, he can’t. He doesn’t have the time. Consider that happiness, your happiness, his happiness wouldn’t hurt anyone, Sheriff, before you make your decision.”
Blu reaches his paw up and lays it gently on Tony’s shoulder. He blinks his big eyes at him and then nods.
“What?” Tony had snapped. “You think I ran because I’m selfish? I ran because of the crap role he gave me in the pack. I’m not there to protect, or to offer guidance. I’m there for a good fuck. And here’s the thing: he’s not gay. Or at least doesn’t confess to being gay.”
Steve fell onto the bed. “I feel like something inside of me is fighting to get out. It’s taking all of my strength away.” His shoulders and arms, his legs, everything loosened and slumped as he sat there on the bed.
Steve falls silent because he has no good excuse, no good idea why it isn’t. He had no free will if he’s to believe everything they’ve told him. For 15 years he toiled under the will of the Soul Keeper. He recalls the adoration he had for the mysterious creature as if the Keeper was his god. He curses low in his throat. “I guess you’re right.”
His parents fought a lot. Most of the time it had to do with Howard’s trips or what Tony’s mom called Howard’s obsession.
“It’s rough. I am basing a lot of this on assumptions. It needs a lot of refinement like I said. Not much in the literature quantifying soul mates or packs. I really did have to start from scratch in some ways. But I’ll get it there. It will help once I can clean it up.” He needed to know a lot more about the pack, understand the character traits, and be able to quantify them better. Maybe Bruce could help.
Steve’s guts tightened and he agreed. How could he not? First position was easy – it was presentation. The second position, Tony glossed over since it was face to face. Third position, he laughed at and said, “This is what we would call spitroasting nowadays. This is especially used for when two alphas or an alpha and a beta are having a tryst with an omega. One on each end. I kind of like the idea with you to tell you the truth.”
Steve opens the door and Tony, with glasses on, steps through. Inside the place looks even more gothic and medieval all rolled into one. What is a doctor of neurology doing with knight armor or other medieval and ancient instruments of torture? The grand staircase leads to a massive window, but Steve directs Tony to the left and toward the offices. A small plaque indicates the main offices and Steve follows it.
“She was a great woman, with a lot of potential. Way more than I had, that’s for sure.” Steve drops his gaze and picks at the grass blades. “She never taught me, you know. We never had enough time.”
Going to the en suite, Steve peers into the cavernous room and sees Tony laying out his purchased goods on the vast dressing countertop. Almost shyly Tony says, “I thought, I thought maybe you could pick out some of the soaps and lotions, and we could shower together. I promised you a shower, earlier. As a way to relax, and I’d like to take care of you, make it up to you.”
Ross smiled, an expression laced with venom. “Of course, it does. The design is specific for the coagulate that vampires use after biting the mate. Biologically, there’s no other molecule like it in the animal kingdom.” He paused and looked directly at the camera. “Dead or alive.”
But maybe he hasn’t come to his senses – maybe he needs to profess the truth and be honest with himself and with Tony.  He cannot stand the forlorn look on Tony’s face.
“See this, I got this in my chest because I used to be a dick.” He stops. “No not really. I trusted someone who was a dick, someone who led me down the path of denigration. So now I have to live with this thing in my chest so I don’t fucking die.” He places his thumb on the arc reactor switch and then twists. There’s a special motion he needs to do to free it from its chest port. He designed that after the whole Stane fiasco. “Here we go.” It pops out.
"Can’t find the prison block," Bucky replies, his breath thick in his throat as he turns a corner only to confront another group of troopers. He sprays them with blasts from his rifle and turns to race away.
“No,” Tony said. “Clint and his family went into hiding. Natasha helped them. Clint’s wife is due soon. They have to be safe.” Tony shook his head. “I don’t know. They might be here, they might be somewhere else. Natasha knows where they are, but she’s keeping it to herself. Thor and Nat should be here in the next hour or so.”
“Shit, sorry,” Steve said and kicked the door shut and locked it. “Tony? Are you- shit, you look like hell.”
He may be strong and stalwart. He may have been Captain America once. Part of him remains, but he’s been disgraced and disconnected. Stumbling back to the sink he gags as he sees the gland again and then a wave hits him. A wave of darkness and stinging light. He blinks a few times to try and regain his vision, but it fuzzes out at the edges. He swallows compulsively, trying to steady himself. Reaching, he grabs the letter that was on the sink counter with a bloody hand and trembles. He cannot step or move – the room swings and sways. Something is wrong.
“I thought you weren’t allow out,” Tony says. He’s both relieved to see her and slightly pissed as well. He cannot parse his feelings.
Leaning against Tony, Steve only nods and bites down on his lip as he begins the slow process of wrapping his wings inward toward his body. They drag on the floor, but he lifts them with a heave and flinches as he begins to close them. It hurts, and the pain it costs him afflicts his expression. A tiny droplet of blood runs from where he bites through his lower lip to mix with the tears streaming down his face.
“You don’t fucking touch him or his family!” Steve shouted at Ross as he tried to manipulate the shackles even as they tightened and constricted around his wrists and ankles.
And now that those bonds were locked in, what could he do to ensure peace within the pack? He doubted Wong or Strange would have answers. He had to fashion an answer on his own. His pack had finally started to come together, but now, he feared the future of it. He was bound to lose someone. Someone important. He swallowed down the taste of bile again and then dropped his hands and let the water rain over his face.
“How the hell?” Steve gulps for air and looks down at his gut. His wound is open again, freely bleeding. The rules have changed.
Focused, Steve clasped Clint’s trembling hand. “Okay, now we’re going to do this.” He closed his eyes as Clint cried out in a wordless sob. Steve steadied his heart, breathed in and breathed out. He let his nerves settle as he spoke.  All the other times Steve had visited, Clint had been still like the grave and nothing Steve could do would wake him. “Clint, listen to me. I’m calling you.”  Clint threw himself about on the bed, but Steve stayed rock steady.
“Please, sir. Please. These patients are critical. They deserve your respect,” the nurse said and then the light spread out and the ward around him appeared.
He grimaces and gets the other wire secured to the node. “What now? What now?” He can’t feel his face and they need a fire but right now he has to save Tony. “What now.”
“Right now, you’re going to leave me with him for a bit. You’ve been here for days. Go, check out the rest of the town,” she says and the meaning underlying, interlacing her words coil in his gut and he has no ability to deny it.
Finally, Steve finds his words. “Don’t do this. You can’t do this.” He whips around to Tony, beseeching him to believe his words. “I didn’t know. I told you it was indirect evidence. I didn’t see anything direct- Nat. Natasha tell him.” He’s forgotten himself. This isn’t Natasha, but a non-player character – another aspect of Ultron himself.
“So, let’s take advantage of that,” Steve interjects. “If he can manipulate the rules, then we can too. All we need to do is get to the Hub.”
“Now, I have some stuff to do. If you want, I’ll come back down, and we can watch something – and-.” His face blushes full red. “Cuddle?”
Disconnecting the battery is the easy part. The more difficult maneuver is getting the embedded jerry-rigged magnet out of the inflamed tissue. He needs to cut away at some of the healed tissues and then plant the new device into the cleaned out hole. He prays that Tony will stay asleep as he works.
“He’s Howard’s son, that’s why the board is interested in you. That’s why we thawed you out,” Fury says. “Howard wasn’t any piece of joy and many an angel never gained their wings trying to turn him on the path of righteousness and justice. His son is worse. You think Howard was a pill, a character, wait until you meet up with him.
“No, not right now, I think I’ll stay out of the fray that’s about to happen,” Natasha says and steps back into the shadows of the Boundaries just as a clunk moves the locks on the door and he stumbles away from it.
“No. But I guess you both had a choice about whether or not you were gonna be perverts, right?” Bucky glared at him.
"The blue compliments your eyes," Tony says and he reaches over to touch the cuff of Steve's shirt with his finger. "Perhaps you would be more comfortable without the coat?"
“A regular date,” Steve teases. He plays with the words because it’s easier to do that instead of the alternative and hope. He adjusts himself so that there’s enough room for Tony to straddle him. He bites his lip, and a nagging feeling rises in him – again. “Tony, can I ask you something?”
He stares only at Tony. He’s sure it’s rude, but he can’t help himself. Tony’s mesmerizing in the white tux with the blue amulet glinting in the crystalline light. “Tony.” Steve wants to wither away and die. He can’t get anything else out.
“Strip.” Steve stands to the side as Tony slowly disrobes, his trousers slipping down to the floor first as he toes off his shoes.
“So, the armor,” Tony concludes and curses under his breath. “Should have known better. Ultron had access to everything I built before he decided to rebel against good old pops. He must have stolen that too; it’s what I would have done.”
“Ha!” Tony barked at Steve. “So you do think gay people are perverts. You are a homophobic dick. And what the fuck do you think of your Beloved being a guy? Because I’m all guy, Stevie-boy. And I am fully loaded.” He grabbed at his crotch. Steve staggered away, getting out of Tony’s personal space. Even if it was crude, it was worth the absolute horror and revulsion on Rogers’ face.
Steve shoved his hands in his pockets. They didn’t speak, not until they were outside of Sam’s apartment. It was a second floor walk-up, but they weren’t going to go in through the front door. Steve directed them to the side where the fire escape scaled the building. He jumped and hooked his hand on the ladder to release it. They both climbed up without a problem. His foot was squishing in the too large sneakers. The bullet graze on his foot ached a bit, but not enough to cause him to limp or impeded his movements. When he knocked on the window, Sam opened the blinds and greeted him.
Tony gasps. “That’s it. You got it, Cap!” He shakes his fist. “I should have known; I should have figured this out. You and I are unpredictable to him; we’re free agents. He’s not. He’s learning as he goes and can only figure out a few things at a time – which is weird-.”
The air around them sizzles and Steve vaguely wonders what Ross is – is he an alpha? He can’t recall but assumes he must be a beta considering betas have been in power for hundreds of years.
The direction surprises Steve, but he follows the group through the door and sees that it is an interrogation room. It’s not morose or morbid, but a simple room with a table in the middle and chairs. It reminds Steve of a police interrogation room, not something the military might use.
“Negative that,” Bucky says as he grips Steve by the arm and forcibly gets him to his damaged feet. “Steve won’t be able to climb a ladder.”
He frowns. Where is Steve? How is he supposed to sit here in the clinic without his personal assistant? Just then Tony hears the door creak open, and he says, “Steve?”
He sits up straighter in the chair even though it costs him and he draws out his Colt Single Action Army Peacemaker. Brand new make and model of the Colt revolver, Steve carries it more as a deterrent than anything else, he prefers his rifle to the smaller less accurate gun. “No, I just protect it, since no one else around here wants to do the job.” He climbs to his feet again, and his shoulder aches. “You’re no hero, Stark, I heard about you. About how you’re only for yourself. You’re not the kind who would lie down on the wire.”
“Well, if you don’t mind the company, maybe we could get something to eat and, like, do the Mantra thing together?” Tony said. His eyes were hopeful, but at the same time Steve glimpsed the shadow of the ‘other Tony’, the one the world saw on a daily basis. He lurked on the perimeter, waiting for Steve to shoot him down. The ‘other Tony’ would appear and that fake smile would be plastered on his face and he would shrug off Steve’s dismissal.
Steve feels the heat rush to his face and he can’t keep eye contact with his host, regardless of how humiliated it makes him feel to look away.
He puts him off until only an hour before the arrival of the Stark delegation. Natasha has flown the newly renovated Commando into its bay. She’ll be escorting some of the ships with delegates on board as they make their way to the new Heli-carrier, the Lemurian Star.
“Oh shit!” Tony jumps out of his arms and nearly busts his knees when he falls forward into the coffee table, only Steve’s quick action of yanking him back saves him. He gasps and Steve’s lays his head against Tony’s back.
The clang of blade against vibranium rings in the darkness. The gravel under Steve’s booted feet slides away, making it difficult for him to grab purchase enough to get a parry to cause Clint to fall down the slope. He has one option. Leaving his back open he targets low – Clint’s knees. Not allowing reaction time, Steve strikes again and again until the construct cries out from the open gash on his legs and tumbles down the hill. The bag falls off his shoulder – Ultron’s mistake for not writing code to keep it with him. Unfortunately, it lands a good 3 meters from Steve’s position. Steve scrambles to the bag, the gravel a constant moving force beneath him.
Hands woven together, the energy of their history – their bond grew prominent. The promises of their energies linked, encompassed Steve and he could no more deny the truth of it than he could deny the moon a place in the night sky. It drew Steve closer, brought him to a place inside his soul that ached to be with Tony. Steve leaned in; their foreheads touched as he closed his eyes.
"You'll see." Coulson smiles as if he's watching a child at Christmas. "It really is an honor to meet you. I was there, you know, when they-."
Their kiss is not one of exploration but of hungry need. As the prince devours him, Tony gasps and tears a little at Steve’s shirt. Thinking quickly, Steve straddles the prince, unbuttons and pulls the tunic over his head. When he tries to do the same with Tony’s shirt, a hand stops him, and a pained look crosses the prince’s face.
“Lower the Captain,” Ross added, and the clatter and clank of Steve’s chains being dropped echoed in the cell. Steve collapsed in the single spotlight. The shine of the light highlighting the abuse his body sustained over the last day. If he hadn’t been drained, Tony knew that he would have been in fighting form still or nearly so. Ross turned to the researchers. “Your theory better be correct.”
As he settles between Tony’s legs, he whispers, “Tell me if this is okay.” He kisses and licks and then with a swirl of his tongue he mouths Tony. It feels like something might be aflame in his chest as he sucks and runs his tongue along the prominent vein. Tony gasps and moans in response.  He sinks deeper into the rapture that threatens on the periphery of his understanding. He should shy away from it. An angel seeking rapture through the mortal world is doomed, condemned. But he is condemned either way. He’s locked from the Boundaries, cannot see the Realms or the heavens.
Steve makes an unintelligible noise. Tony scrubs a hand down his ass and then fingers him, touching his hole. Steve jerks.
The sleek design, the colors mimic his Iron Man armor – it’s everything that Tony would have desired in a skiing outfit. His mouth goes dry. “I-mm- I like it. Yes, I do.”
“No, no, I’ll come by after that cup of coffee, sound good?” Tony says and Phil only nods in agreement.
Tony narrowed his focus on Steve as the vibrations along the soul bonds intensified. Steve pressed his lips into a tight line but then bobbed his head. “I know the mission is the scepter, but we also go in and try and get the twins as well as Bucky.”
“Yeah the principal of time travel – you can’t change the past – but that’s what they tried to do.” He slaps his hands and there’s a weird result where he stretches for a second and then returns to normal. It’s freaky. “They split realities and when they played around with a singularity shot the new reality at a different time.”
The slice of Clint’s sword slashes through the air as Steve throws up the shield to thwart it. He stumbles and falls back as the ground beneath him shifts, changing from level grass to a steep drop off of gravel. Luckily, he recovers and only counts a few scrapes as his reward. Clint advances.
While Tony still hadn’t allowed Steve into the sanctum of his workshop, they ended up spending a lot of time together – especially in the living room area with a lap top between them and Tony explaining bits and pieces of life. In many ways they both cut out the puzzles pieces and linked them together. Steve was a ravenous student, always looking for more, hunting like a predator for things that didn’t fit, for gaps in his knowledge. When he figured it out, the glorious smile he gave Tony always had him running – slipping away to his workshop to get away from Steve – and his ever growing feelings.
Fury shook his head. “I’m not sure it works like that, Captain. I think the urgency, or need, will happen and you’ll just say it. You won’t be able to stop from what I understand. You will, in fact, by instinct and nature connect. You can’t make it happen.”
In all the days he’d spent as a vampire, Tony had been lucky to never be trapped outdoors for too long during the day. Even when he escaped the terrorists, he’d done it at night and Rhodey had discovered him in the desert. It felt like a million years ago now. Rhodey wasn’t around to save him; he hadn’t seen his old friend in months. He wished, he prayed to the unknown gods of the dead that Steve might somehow be coming to save him, but he knew through his blood soaked tears he was only fooling himself. Tony tried to pull off the wooden cross, but the sun stole his energy, ate away at the last fibers of strength, and left him powerless. He couldn’t hope to save himself let alone Steve.
Only a breath away, everything Steve desires, the dreams and promises to touch another, to feel the bristle of a man’s beard against him. He should run, he should heed Bucky’s advice, because going down this path will only lead to ruin.
“That means,” Steve started but failed to continue again. It meant that Natasha and Thor had died at some time in the distant past as well and had been revived. It meant that Tony had died. It meant that Steve had been impotent to help Tony. It meant that all of the years that Steve worked to stop the torture of vampires within the ranks of the V-Corps was for naught.
“What the-?” He’s not even watching the movie. He’s staring at the little painting with its little trees and pond. This one even has a little lakehouse – like it’s trying to be part of the movie. Why does Pepper keep littering his house with all of these insanely Hobbit inspired pictures. It looks like she’s trying to establish the Shire or something in his penthouse.
“Not sure,” Fury said and then he crossed his arms. “On top of that von Strucker has someone, an enemy, already sniffing around the cell that’s dangerous and could put our operation in jeopardy.”
Scoffing, Jamison replies, “And you believed him? He’s not from Earth. Not from any Earth I know. There’s something strange about him. The way he talks, the way he looks at people. Like he’s seeing through you. I don’t know. He might have a mental problem. You should have him tested when we get to Council.”
Pepper percolates with happiness as she reports the different headlines to him. It’s a rare day that he’s visiting his office at Stark Industries. Over the course of the last week, the different tabloids and entertainment sites praised the new power couple. Darker theories popped up – the US government planted Captain Rogers to draw Tony under their wing. Happier news continued to counter those stories with theories ranging from stories based on An Officer and a Gentleman with manipulated images for Tony in Steve’s arms to stories of a lonely soldier who met Tony when he escaped from Afghanistan. The latter one came precariously closes to the truth.
“I know what you mean,” Tony says. “My eyes are actually fine. I have damage to the optical nerve. “During the crash I had a traumatic brain injury. It caused an aneurysm in my brain near the optic chasm. I was able to survive, but unfortunately, the optic nerve was permanently damaged.”
The warmth surrounding him, protecting him from Ultron’s assault becomes a bright light. Stronger still until he experiences it not only as a sensation but as thought itself.
“As was I,” Strange interrupted. “I assure you, Stark, I doubted as well. But the idea that there are forces outside our comprehension, that we exist behind the mere four dimensions, that we can tap it, is true. As I said, I can assure you of these facts.”
“Thanks.” They come upon a small brook. It’s not even a foot wide but Steve stops and eyes it. “We have a small stream. You’ll need to step over it. To miss completely about a foot and a half. I’ll for first.” Like a pro, Tony manages the stream without a problem. Steve beams but doesn’t compliment Tony because he might take offense to it.
“That was months ago, years ago really,” Tony jumped in. He hated to think about getting rejected. Talking about it was off the table.
“Yes, yes you did.” Tony lays his head on Steve’s shoulder. “You did and I know exactly how you feel about it. I know exactly who you are. You know how angry I was about it. You know me.”
Steve drinks his coffee and then asks, “So, how did you manage? I know you said before, but I still can’t believe it. I mean it’s been nearly 10 years, right? No one knows.”
Waiting, he watched as emergency crews started the chore of clean up. Some injured were removed and hustled away in ambulances. God, what was he doing out here. Why wasn’t he back with Steve – with his pack? Even out here, the ring of the pack resonated in his head.
“Not now,” Tony says. “I’ll deal with it. I’ll figure it out.” He means it, too. He’ll call Happy and Pepper and get the whole gang over here to move them out of this crappy building. He call in all the security guards. No one is touching Steve Rogers. Ever again.
It has been months. All they call him by is his number - 07041918. His birthday - but not. They tell him they don't want to call him by his real name because it would confuse his memories processes, that eventually he'll recall and it will be healthier for his damaged brain for him to slowly settle into his real memories without words and names being thrown at him. He never believed them. "We can leave?"
“Are you so sure? They made assumption about your abilities, your limitations. All of which would end up affecting the outcomes,” Steve says and stops.
Keeping pressure on his friend, Steve lends the whole of his strength of it. He's no novice when it comes to operations, and surgeries. In the war, he saw many a soldier pinned down and sawed upon, taking limbs without any relief of ether. There's no ether out in the middle of the Western Territories. Gulping back the nausea, Steve tries to focus on Bucky, tells him to let go and pass out. But his friend's eyes look like that of a rabid dog, crazed, pained, and confused.
“You could say that,” Steve said and smiled. It felt raw though, as if his facial muscles forgot how to do a simple movement of joy and happiness. When he considered all that happened, knowing that Sam was safe, Steve took his friend’s hand and clasped it. “It’s good to see you well. It’s good to see you safe.”
Tony leans in and Steve scans the room; they are alone. His hand is perilously close to Tony’s hand on the table. “I live an unconventional life, Captain, I’m sure you understand exactly what I’m talking about.”
The good Captain turns with the palette in his one hand and a thick paint brush loaded with green paint in the other. “Tony.”
Hurrying along, Steve jogs to meet up with Tony. Tony tentatively places his bag near the corner of the house and smiles when Clint walks up toward them. There’s a picnic table in what looks like a field that needs to be harvested for hay. Laura waves to them but doesn’t leave her task at the table. Clint’s in full Avengers’ team regalia.
“I think he’s up to something and this Tiberius is the key.” Steve cannot believe for one minute that Tony would truly intend to marry Tiberius. Even if Tony hadn’t remembered everything that happened, he’d have some information from Pepper. Pepper would never let something like this happen. “I need you to check it out, look around. Find out what you can and do it quick.”
“It’s universal,” Tony said. “Why wouldn’t it.” Thor furrowed his brows at Tony as Steve tried for a smile but didn’t quite manage it. “Well, Thor, welcome to the pack.”
Tony holds onto Steve as if they’re on a spinning ride at an amusement park. He’s not going to let go. Not now. “I know. We’ll figure it out.”
“Well, yes but how about something a little less visually centric.” The amusement on Tony’s face is clearly evident.
It seems like a million years ago now, but it had only been a few desperate weeks. A few weeks of the world descending into hell, a few weeks of pleading calls for them to do something about it, a few weeks of Secretary Ross promising them that there would be serious consequences to their actions. They have one shot to get this right.
“Resting,” Tony says and already hates the man. Irrationally he blames Logan for this, for what’s happened to Steve. He forces himself to be polite. He listens to Pepper in his head – show some manners Tony. “He hasn’t woken up since he had the seizure. The doctors say he’s just sleeping now.”
Steve gave a small smile and said, “She said that to me, you know. She said it to me. And now she’s gone. She’s the last, except for-.” He stopped and closed his eyes. “She was my Guide. I loved her. As long as she was still with me, still with us, there was a link to-.” He couldn’t voice the rest, but then again, he didn’t need to. Tony looked at Natasha hoping that she might have some magic words to make this right again.
“I’ve never heard of shield. What shield?” Steve replies as Tony leads him to the front: the cockpit.
The omega is tight, tighter than Tony would have imagined. He throws himself into his rhythm, pounding with a particularly harsh abandon. Beneath him, the omega groans long and hard as Tony takes his hand and clamps it around the base of the man’s cock. Orgasm control and allowance is one of the ultimate shows of power. The man hangs his head and makes little whimpers as he realizes that Tony won’t allow him to come after all. The idea that the omega knows this, comprehends Tony’s power over him throws Tony into an alpha frenzy and his knot expands, swelling in the tight ass.
“There you go, Sheriff, quiet,” Tony says and then Steve realizes he’s slowly wiping the come from his face and licking it off his fingers.
As they descend, they both shudder and then Tony’s embracing Steve, holding him close as if to protect him from some unseen enemy. In moments, he disengages and tosses the condom to the side. He slips his arms around Steve and in bridle style carries him to the bedroom.
“If you go by my biology, I’m gonna be twenty-seven,” Steve said. “Seems to me all the kids these days figure this stuff out in their teens.”
Steve hangs up the towel and climbs back up the steps, knowing that Tony will trail after him, passes the prison cells, toward the front office. Bucky is nowhere to be found, the extra deputy badge on the desk. With gun holster belted on, Steve takes out his own badge and pins it on waiting for Tony to explain.
JARVIS began. Most of the information seemed to be created by an underground movement similar to fandoms, where outsiders of the soul pack fantasized about what it might be, including shaping myths and rules about it. From having names scrawled on arms, to timers counting down, to not being able to tell a lie to your soul mate – how awful would that be? One interesting blog seemed to have an inside track on soul mates and soul packs.
“You like what they’re doing to you?” Fury asked as his black leather coat wrapped around him. Steve saw it as a cloak – that stilled like the blackest deep ponds.
He can see the stars from here, the vastness of space only an arm’s length away. The scatterings of Way Stations, of planets and moons, and other Living Stations are all just hops along the way of the Dream Stars within the Inner Belts. He used to wish on the first stars he saw as a child in the Rims, hoping to someday live here. Now, all he wants to do is escape.
Tony lifts his gaze to Jamison. The night has a decided chill to it. The platform from the main Council building jets out of the spire building like a pier into the oceans of Nod. Except the causeway bridges over a lush forest. The night flowers bloom and fill the air with sweet scents as the night birds and small critters chirp and call to one another. One day he’ll have a moment of peace. For a second he longs for those easy days as a rogue alpha – but then he recalls when Steven pointed out that Estane had maneuvered to get Tony out of the Stark Family and ruin him. History would not repeat itself. Estane would never have the Stark estate or the High Alpha Chair.
“I have a surprise for you,” Tony says and ushers Steve back to the table. They settle in their chairs.
“Because, Natasha, never in my mind have you ever been the perfect fit for the head mistress of a brothel,” Steve says. When she doesn’t flinch, he chances a reveal.  “Plus General Fury talks in his sleep.”
hand wrap around his mother’s neck, the delicate bones snapping under pressure of his fingers even as she cried.
Steve avoids looking him in the eyes. Instead, he stares at the bed. “I think I’d like to go to sleep actually. If you don’t mind?”
Steve hisses. His mouth foams and he still hasn’t spit out the paste yet. He finishes up and wipes his mouth. He chides himself. This isn’t a date. Tony’s not going to kiss him. He wets his hands and runs them through his hair, pushing it back. He can do this. He has to remain professional. His boss needs him to monitor the status of the upgrade. This isn’t a date.
Tony pushes him down onto the piano. “An apprentice, if I remember correctly.” Before Steve can retort, Tony takes his erection in hand and rolls the condom down on it. The roughness of his palms, the calluses throw Steve into a shuddering want. Tony recognizes the sensitivity and leans down to lick a strip of Steve’s erection. He doesn’t go gently, but borders on harsh. Steve arches into his mouth, moaning as he does. Tony looks up at Steve, a devilish grin teasing his lips.  “If only you knew my talents for a bare back blow job.”
Once Steven settles, Tony unlocks the harness and removes the dildo. He places both to the side to be cleaned later. Steven falls on his ass, wincing as he does, but he lowers his head as if he mourns something lost within him.
“That’s enough of that,” Steve said. Clint smirked and then a short ring signaled a call from his wife. He shrugged and walked a slight distance away for privacy.
The ample amount of pre-come dripping down Steve’s cock served as a lubricate and Tony gripped both of their cocks together in his hand. Steve shuddered as their cocks touched and he turned his head, closed his eyes.
“Okay,” Steve says. Keep it short and simple. He’s here for one thing. Let Tony use his body, keep his head out of it, and especially keep his heart out of it.
Tony stands next to Steve and hesitates before he places his hand on the small of his back. “Well, we can have sandwiches and coffee.”
“Marijuana but I don’t think that’s a good idea to smoke the first day with my PA.” Tony smiles at the little hiccup noises that Steve makes. “Don’t worry. I only use weed when it gets very bad and I have a script for it. Plus, I’m on the wagon and that will just tip over the cart completely.” The warmth on his face lulls him and he yawns. He shouldn’t be tired; he didn’t burn the midnight oil last night. Or this morning. “Can’t remember how much I slept last night. Tired.” The room’s interface has been shut off. The isolation is astounding.
The omega curls his face into his shoulders and tightens his hands into fists. Tony glances up and down his body, sees the fine sheen of sweat, the tiny tremors that a sub-omega could never hide, and the proud erection still dripping between his legs.
“Tesseract, yeah, I thought so,” Steve says and stands. “I’m gonna have a wash, then I’ll meet you at Darcy’s and we can talk with Thor. He still hanging out over there?”
Tony digs into the food, finding that he particularly savors the fruit. The sweetness hits his tongue and he swoons almost forgetting the phone in his hand.
The USO girls taught him some things, and he told Tony about that. But he’d never told Tony about Bucky. Not what Bucky did or what had happened. Or how it had nearly ripped their friendship to shreds. He couldn’t face it and he didn’t think it relevant. Bucky had been dead for seventy years. Steve wouldn’t find out that Bucky was alive for another two years. It seemed like a harmless obfuscation.
It isn’t a question. “I couldn’t ask you to do that,” Steve says. “You’re only just recovering yourself.”
With nothing to lose and all the information to gain, he answers, “My mother, I remembered my mother.”
Steve glanced at Natasha, who still whispered the mantra in a sing song loving fashion, and then he focused on Wong.
Tony ran his hands through his hair. His disheveled look, his roaming eyes, and the jittery feeling through the soul bond spoke loud and clear of his anxiety. “I put you to bed. You were supposed to be resting. I was fucking worried about you!”
“Family,” he uttered and the bond snapped into place. She nearly lost hold of him as she stumbled, but it wouldn’t have mattered anyhow. Metal arms encompassed him, tearing him away from the red flames, and then an army of iron men walled him off from her. With barely enough energy to keep his eyes open, Steve murmured, “Clint.”
"Not really," Steve had mumbled and Tony's face must have said it all. Steve leaned up on one elbow and added, "Don't make it weird. I can't have entanglements. That's not how this works."
“So you keep saying,” Steven says and Tony focuses on his exposed gland, the skin pink and perfect. The gland is swollen and fragrant. “I am nothing but a tool for you to use against your competition for the chair.”
He doesn’t know if another omega would have affected him so. It surprises him to know that Steven has, in such a little time, began to change Tony. He laps a little at the wound he leaves, cleaning it. Standing, he quietly adjusts Steven’s collar and snaps closed the leathers to the collar. He lays his hands on each of Steven’s shoulders for a moment.
Steven remains next to the wall, both broken and defiant at the same time. He swallows down and then nods. “If you wish, my lord.”
Tony curled his arms around his torso, not allowing anyone to see the markings that wove up his arm and disappeared under his short shirt sleeve. He’d intended to wear the under armor that he had been working on, not just a Dead Head t-shirt, but time too short.
A tight smile crosses her features, she nods, and then joins Gamora to plan and deliver the message. He prays he’ll see her again.
“Maybe the chasm between us is just too big, Tony. Maybe this whole charade is just that – a charade. I appreciate what you’re trying to do for my team. I really do. But this.” He lifts his chin to indicate the bonding collar. “It’s show and nothing more. I’m not bonded to you.” He sighs and closes his eyes only briefly before opening them again. “You know when those scientists first took my gland it was over. We tried to bond again, and it didn’t take. You got sick-.”
“Just tell me the location, okay?” Steve said and then thought maybe he should have called Nat. The possibility that their phones were off due to the fact they were in a safe house had occurred to him.
“Hmm that’s not a ringing endorsement of my as of yet unspoken proposal, but I will proceed.” Tony beams at him. “This upcoming event that Pepper’s planned at the Maria Stark Foundation. She’s convinced it has to be more than a gala. If it’s a gala it’s only a few hours long and my nemesis the reporter-.”
He tries and tries. The water pelts him and he mourns the days he walked around blind to the truths in the world, when he couldn’t see while he partied and played. Everything was easier then when he didn’t
Another one that went straight to his chest. He didn’t know Steve, not at all. He didn’t know the leader of the Avengers. “Well, we’re a bunch of bastards now when it comes to manners. What can I do for you?” Tony asked. He both wanted to flee the call and to sit here and bask in it. Steve looked great. That dark dying part of him, settled in his core, lifted its head. It felt like sunlight.
“Fuck you, Rogers. Fuck you.” He slaps a hand to his forehead. “You fucking bastard. I nearly threw myself off the cliff in Siberia. You god damned idiot. I wanted to fucking die.”
He gave up his soul to Steve, tried to coax him back to life. But all of Steve’s life had drained away, feeding the rocks, and dirt, and Earth below them. His soul was absent – gone – as if it had never existed.
“You really have to ask, Captain?” Clint said and then sat back into the seat. “He might not always be the most kosher, but he’s done things – good things – for me.”
“Well not to the whole of the US, that’s for sure.” Steve doesn’t open the dishwasher but fills the sink with detergent and water and washes the dishes by hand.
Of course that’s when the door crashes open. Tony leaps to his feet to be confronted by a man with dark long hair, a seething expression, and a metal arm.
“I’m sure. He can come to the conference. It won’t matter,” Steve says. He goes back to his desk and swings into the chair. Sweeping his hand over the console it lights up and he retrieves the diplomat listings.  The conference is huge, it isn’t a small affair; he doubts he’ll even see Tony.
“But I like to wander!” Tony yells over his shoulder and Steve yanks him out the door. Tony chuckles. “We should get some knives and pretend he got us.”
Shrugging, Steve says, “The people. There was my Ma. She was a nurse. The whole reason she ended up on Brooklyn was because she followed my Da out there. He signed up as a colony guardsman. But it’s a colony in the Beyond Regions so they used the firepits as the main defense against incursions.”
Steve shifts in his seat. He's not sure how they ended up discussing and debating religion. He opens his mouth to say something but then realizes he has no defense, nothing to say except for the obvious.
Same thing happened with vampires and mates. Logically, it made sense for vampires to be allowed one mate in a consensual relationship. But the Treaty and the laws of the US forbade it, because it meant a population that the ones in power couldn’t truly control. Too many. Vampires with their immortality, their supernatural strength, their supposed glamour, threatened the power structure of human society. If they also had mates that meant that a growing sub-population supported vampires and their existence. The ones in power refused to allow the concept to their own detriment.
“Just sit over there. This would have been easier if you were a lion. I could’ve ridden.” He is not going to be able to collect all the pieces and easily cart them back. He’s going to have to leave something to mark the area and come back for it.
Tony pushed aside the jarred foods and pointed to what looked like an electrical outlet. “I knew this place couldn’t be that Medieval.”
“You’re too proud of your work,” Natasha says and then whispers something that just might be an endearment. It’s shocking and odd. After all this is Ultron playing against himself.
I'm so sorry this chapter took so long! RL has been kicking my ass. I really am thankful to you all for your patience. I hope you enjoy it!
The nurse bows a little and excuses herself. “I’ll be right outside if you need me.” She points to the side rail where there are call buttons. She leaves.
He couldn’t see as the tears blinded him; he couldn’t breathe as the weeping blocked the air from his lungs. “What did you do? You god damned fucking bastard!”
With that he leaves and Steve is left with his water and crackers. He doesn’t eat any of the dry crackers but drinks all of the water. He supposes he should start thinking of strategies. Tony being here only means that the search for Bucky will swing into high gear. Steve needs to focus on that and not the state of his gland or health. Of course, taking the risk of getting the gland out might not have been his best decision. The best thing about it though is that he probably won’t present again for another few months. It buys him time, if anything.
“Sir, they also say the local criminals are cursed. They have a creature that is cursed and could be a demon,” JARVIS adds.
First, he went back toward Bruce who met him easily. Bruce was using his energy signature to check on the health and status of each of them. That was promising. With Bruce monitoring each of the pack members for their health and well-being, Steve turned towards their strategic points. Both Nat and Clint were following the stream, but Clint was on high alert, eyes always scanning as the energies from Nat were more subtle- reading the more grounded signs. A skip in her energy waves told Steve she discovered something before she actually called it in.
“Today, Today-.” He waited as the crowd quieted. “Today, Captain America saved America. Lots of times we like to ignore what’s going on around us. It’s easy that way, right?” He asked and several of the people closest to him nodded. “It’s easy to go along with our daily lives and just ignore that little voice in the back of your head that maybe the Patriot Act might be a little too invasive. Maybe those rules about how the government treats whistleblowers are just for show. We all love to hang out on social media, stream the good shows, find out what’s happening with our favorite teams. And we can do that. You know why?”
There’s a moments of hesitation before Steve reacts, but then he steps over to Tony’s side and offers him his arm. Tony grasps his bicep and Steve directs them to the stairs. He quietly counts them off for Tony as they turn and then make the second floor. Vision calls from the first floor.
Human society was steeped in contradictions. As a vampire, Tony finally got why it was important to have a mate and that it benefited not only the vampire community but also the human community. It kept everyone safe and happy. But humans and laws saw it differently. Tony liked to think of it as he’d thought of capitalism all those years ago. The machine of capitalism wasn’t to spread the wealth but to feed the monster at the top of the heap – the CEO, the owner, the Board of Directors. Those on the highest rung of the ladder wanted to ensure that the money flowed upwards and that the ones down below kept running on their treadmill of labor producing the profits. Union were a direct threat to that – union, socialism, worked toward spreading the wealth, evening out the playing field. Tony took enough economics and finance courses to glean the real reason unions got busted up and not supported by owners. Yet, the people at the lowest rung time and again voted and supported the big guys at the top, feeding off of the idea that if a union came in it would eat away at the vitality of the company when in fact it would mean that the owners and top percenters would suffer. People actively supported the idea of an economics plan to push the wealth upward with hopes it would trickle down. Never did.
Steve rolls his eyes. “For Pete’s sake, Bucky, can you be serious? This is a problem and I need help.”
Clint pauses. The air chills in response. Steve glances over his shoulder to the entrance portal area and that’s completely disappeared. Even if they wanted to, they couldn’t escape that way since it’s now been replaced with a field of corn. When Steve looks back all the constructs are paused. Laura has her hand on a pitcher of lemonade. Lila has her bow pulled back (she has good form – is that something that Ultron is hypothesizing or does Tony know about her abilities). Both the Barton boys are frozen in the field with a ball in the air between them. The sound of the birds twists into a high pitched buzzing noise like a thousand locusts descending.
“I’d do it again in a minute, Steve, so stop,” Bucky says and then Natasha’s having a good old time with his shoulder again and he’s biting down hard enough to draw blood from his lips.
He rams it with his shoulder to get it out of the way as she heaves Clint onto his side. Tony asks, “Should I call an ambulance?”
“No, I don’t,” Steven says and then he drops his hands. Tony feels a chill run up his spine. “I wish I could, I wish there was some way to bridge the divide. We should be a pair. I know we should. It’s part of our biology, but the way you were trained, this society trains you – changes everything. It’s not how it’s supposed to be – not with an alpha and omega like us.”
Tony presses a hand on his chest. “Not exactly.” He jingles the wires connecting them. “We kind of did that together.”
He mourns Steve as he pitches into the sands of the desert. It’s over. The insanity of his captivity is over and he couldn’t care less.
“All of our childhood dreams eventually get tarnished,” Natasha said as she walked over to join them. She looked tired, a little broken. The fact that Tony could read that spoke volumes. The nursing station on the floor was subdued and maybe that was because of the armed guards milling around it.
He smiles but it feels like someone's plastered it on his face. "That's nice, I wish I could believe you, sir. Have the doctors told you why I am here?" He doesn't want to get anyone's hopes up that he'll recover from his injuries. None of the new memories - or the real memories the doctors have told him about - have actually come back. Only the fake ones - they've become more real.
Tony sees the moment that Steven understands that Tony might listen to his words, his questions about nature verses nurture, but he hasn’t imbibed them and made them his own. Steven recognizes it.
“Yeah, great.” There’s not a workshop in sight. The team specifically picked this place out so that they could just hang together, binge watch series, play boardgames, cook together. That kind of kumbaya thing. Tony didn’t want to come in the first place, but he’d broken up with Pepper some time ago, and there’s nothing for it. He’s here.
As he reaches for his case, Tony grabs it and stops him. “Sit down.” Steve eases back into the chair. “Let’s see what else we have here.” He flicks his fingers to indicate he wants to look at the ad Steve printed. Steve pushes it across the desk. Tony opens the folded paper. No wonder Steve thought he was coming to an interview where music was a definitive part of the job. “Why’d you come to an interview that you thought musically inclined would be important to the job when you don’t have that skillset anyway?”
“Listen, my Captain,” Tony says and Steve should complain – should tell Tony to stop calling him Captain. But the word rolls off of Tony’s tongue, so naturally, that when Tony uses it, it feels right. It feels like things will work out and that the title has become his name in some obtuse and confusing way. “Listen, we’ll all a bunch of misfits. I’m dying, and I like my love with a little muscle, Bruce is a doctor with rage in his heart, you’re a war hero who also seems to like it on the muscular side. We’ve found a place here, a different place. I think that’s why I’m out here in the West. That’s why Stark Industries didn’t have a problem letting me leave. You can’t imagine the way the investors look at someone like me.”
He lets his mouth talk without thinking; it feels like he’s in a trance. “Shadows. It wasn’t like lightning, not like what you would think crackles would be. It wasn’t like Thor was there with his hammer and his power. The space around him crackled and split. Like it whipped around him.”
“The problem we have right now is that the program of Ultron invaded the whole of the internet including the dark web. It’s in every nook and cranny. It’s infected both the internet and intranets. It’s been growing for the past few months unnoticed.”
It rankles Tony but he appreciates the omega’s boldness – it will serve him well during the Council meeting. He could beat him, punish him now, but he needs to learn a little more about the omega before he considers what to do next. He assesses the omega, who still has the data streaming before them. So blatant. Considering his actions, the omega
Tony searches around the café and when he sees the lack of customers he says, “Do you want to sit down for a bit. Talk?”
Tony tasted the bile in his mouth. “God damn it, do you even get what’s going on here. Look at yourself.”
“Yeah, sorry about that,” Steve said. “We figured it out. Natasha is surprisingly good at – what they call profiling? And she put the pieces together. So I flew out to New York and had a sit down with Bruce at the SHIELD base there. He checked me over. We had lunch. It was nice.” Steve seemed so blasé about it like soul packs were every day occurrences. Not something special and coveted.
Steve hung his head and sat forward a little, gripping his water bottle with both hands. “Everyone should have a litmus test, Clint. Captain America doesn’t get a pass. The symbol is one thing. The person is another.”
“No. Stop. You haven’t eaten in hours, probably not since the flight. If you need more food- God, you do need food if I remember my father’s notes correctly. I can get you more. I remember from my father’s writings that you need like 4x what other people need. How did you handle this as a lion?” He hustles over to the refrigerator to see if he can find more of the deliciously fresh fruit.
“Come with me to bed,” Tony says and reaches up to caress the line of Steve’s cheek. “You’re intriguing to me, Captain, but more so the good in you, the good is my elixir. I want it. Come with me to bed. It’s why you came here, you know that, I know that.”
He jerks and rubs a little at his eyes. It will never do to have Captain America see Tony Stark – Iron Man – moping. “Yeah? What are you doing in my neck of the woods?” He climbs to his feet. He waves away the schematics, but the machine still vibrates with energy. He’s nearly done with it. He only needs one more finally piece.
He frowns in response. He only agreed to the red because Luke kept pushing it and he just wanted to finish the endless dressing session. The red will only emphasize his pale skin tones and make him look sickly. “I think the white or the blue. The red is too bold, too bright for my skin tone.”
The little girl pipes in. “My dad said he didn’t want anything else. But that’s not true, he said you have a very fine ass. And he likes your blue eyes.”
The man shakes his head. “You may be too late. Lion Hunter was here only yesterday. He’s after the lion.”
As they start to head out, Tony says, “It’s a surprise to me. Pep would say I’ve been mooning over you. I think she exaggerates when she’s been watching too much of the Viz. But I have to ask, was it as simple with your Carbonelli alpha?”
Steve looked to the window, the old lace curtain his mother hung only weeks before her death. “I wish too.” It was barely audible.
Steve gripped his bag with white knuckles. His jaw worked like he was trying to chew through leather. Finally he said, “I’d just like a little time to think through things. I didn’t realize you had a place for me to stay. I apologize for that. But if you could tell me where I’ll go there now.”
It comes in dark flashes first, the part that terrifies him. Where he sees the long tendrils of an alien entity reaching out to him. He shivers and fights to be free of the visions, but there’s no going back once he’s succumbed to the seizure. Steve knows he brought this on himself. He invited the seizures so that he could visit a time and a place that never existed. Yet he would give anything to be free of the demon lurking in the shadows of that forgotten future. He grits his teeth as the thing prowls around in his head, sending spears of pain like burns through his neurons. It eases as fast as it came and then suddenly he sees Tony – or his forgotten Tony. The alternate Tony.
Barnes is too smart to read it as a ploy, but he pretends to accept the deference Tony offers. “When he was younger, he was too sick to worry about it. He never went into heat. After Rebirth, he went into heat almost immediately. Or at least that’s what I’m told. Phillips wasn’t too keen on it. Sent him away. The military got him on some pretty strong illegal suppressants. The rest is history, I think.” He shrugs. “What the hell does it matter?”
“Make sure he suffers, Brock. He needs to be made an example of to the rest of the agents. When we’re finished, his dry husk will be hung in the training rooms for all of the agents to see.” Ross smiled. It oozed. “Human perfection.”
Leading Shield to the shore, they slip into the river, it’s only ankle deep for a few feet and then as they continue, the rushing waters splash and lap at the bellies of the horses. Steve feels the chill of the waters on his boots. He checks on Tony, and the man’s expression is pinched and he has one hand up to his chest at his heart.
As he hurried out of the car, he heard Pepper warning Rumlow, “Do not strike him. Mister Stark gave you explicit instructions.”
In the Tower medical center, there were two critical care bays. One was currently occupied by Barnes. It was in the opposite wing of the medical center. Yet, they could still hear the frequent screams and thumps coming from the room. Tony could only imagine what was going on. A brainwashed soldier, arm shot off, and nerve pain enough to set him mentally on fire – that was enough to know. Tony felt no compulsion to find out more – not now.
Steve’s hands sweated, and he rubbed them on his shirt. Talking about this – about everything right now – drowned him in the memories. The feel of them crawling over him, sucking out his blood, forcing their hands, their fingers, their fists into him. He stifled a sob. “You don’t know. You can’t. You’re one of them!”
He wished they would try – he planned to fight them, to resist with every molecule in his undying body. The thought of losing his mind, of living his undead life in a stupor like an automaton, sickened him. It would mean the loss of everything. There would be no way to save Steve. How had it all come to this? Tony recalled how his mother told him stories of the evil vampires. How his father lectured him to stay away from the vampire communities. Even with the treaty, vampires posed a danger to all humans, and their contaminated filth shouldn’t be allowed in any city according to Howard. Once though, Tony had ventured to their part of the city while he was at MIT.
In due time, Tony hears a clattering sound, then a clang as if metal hits metal – or more precisely as if metal alloy clanks against metal alloy. When Blu returns, he’s carrying what’s left of the suit in his mouth. He dumps it near the dead deer, huffs, and sits down.  He’s silent and watching.
The lift swiftly descends. It’s partially open so he can see the levels of his ship speed by. As a Court vessel it is one of the largest ships of his fleet. There are three main levels off of the forward section of the ship. The bridge sits up top, the engineering and tactical areas are in the mid-section, and the servant quarters are below that. His quarters and that of his Family are in the aft section where the other luxury areas of the vessel lie. He leaves the lift as it arrives, not even waiting for the final announcement of the level.
“Well forever is a long time, Maker mine, and you don’t have that. So I decided on something a little more descriptive.”
Tony closes his eyes and hates the sounds even more. He needs a way in, but the door is opposite the desk. Rumlow positioned everything perfectly so he could watch and fuck at the same time. On the desk, close to Steve is a gun. Tony won’t have a goddamned chance against it.
Steve frowns. “I don’t think that’s what it was, Tony. It’s just nice to hear my name-.” He doesn’t add the rest – how he longs for him to say his name within a loving embrace. That’s something that will never happen for Steve. He puts the mug aside without having tasted it. “I think I should get dressed.” He’s only in a hospital gown – when did that happen?
Tony waits, silently considering Steve’s invitation, but eventually he accepts and sits down. Steve’s wing automatically curls around Tony’s shoulder. He startles and Steve shifts his wing as if to remove it.
“You know, I know we shared close quarters for a while there, but usually I expect a little foreplay. Maybe a drink or two.” He doesn’t say dinner. Because he’s the dinner.
“It depends on the leader and the circumstances,” Strange said and left it at that. He turned to Steve. “It will be up to you. Since you have the brand of the leader, you will name each and every member.”
Aggravated and hating the dark that had become his day, Tony wrenched at the chains, but they wouldn’t give way. Twisting his wrists, he attempted to slide out of the shackles but that proved impossible as well. The door to his cell opened while he worked on the locking mechanism that had been cleverly concealed under the shackle.
“inclusiveness in your day still meant separation, Captain. You have to see that there will never be equity. Not with their strength, their glamour, their immortality always in play,” Ross said as he watched Steve with a critical eye. “They represent a threat to the health and well-being of every day, good American citizens. How do we know if they’ll keep to the Treaty? That treaty was flawed from the start. They could take a mate. They will always be stronger, faster, with superhuman abilities.”
A guard hurried to meet them. Tony frowned as Pepper parked. Maybe he should have called in re-enforcements? Maybe Rhodey should have accompanied them. Happy drove the large van to a stop next to their SUV. As the guard greeted them, Tony fingered his iron man bracelets like a security blanket. The armor wasn’t far and he peered back at the van.  Pepper eyed him, her gaze following his nervous fingers. Scowling he dropped his hands and gave a fake smile to the man awaiting his response.
“Yeah. No. We need to get all the information we can now,” Tony says but turns away from Bruce. He can’t face that a man who loves Steve is on his way. A man who Steve loved is coming. All this time Tony’s been fooling himself. Steve isn’t shy or naïve. He’s a man who has been loved and has loved another man. It’s only been a few short weeks. Inwardly, Tony admits his foolishness, his blind eye that he turned when Steve demonstrated a dichotomy of needs. He both wanted and shunned Tony as if he played a dual role in the relationship. As if he both wanted to pursue a relationship with Tony but felt guilty over leaving Logan. Tony tries his damnest to ignore it and forge ahead. “I’m going to get dressed and go see Steve. I’ll get JARVIS to set up a call with Richards. I want you to be on it.”
“But you said he wanted to find a cure for the vampire ‘disease’.” Tony used air quotes to set disease apart.
“Yeah, yeah, I-he did,” Steve smiles but it isn’t pleasant, only hurt, and colored with melancholy. He shifts the subject. “I got you an extra day off, why don’t you rest?”
“Out and about,” Tony says. “Not sure what she’s up to today. She spent all of yesterday getting the travel arrangements set.”
“Maybe we should talk,” Tony says. Every fiber in his body wants to rebel. His nerves are screaming as if he’s in pain. He doesn’t want to lose Steve. Not like this. Sure, he can fuck up the best relationship all on his own, but this – this is just evil forces of doom playing with him.
“Okay,” Steve says. He brings the water back to Bucky’s lips, who only tastes it but doesn’t truly drink any of it.
“Go, I’m fine,” Tony says but his words sound more strangulated than comforting. The river’s less than a quarter mile across but as they tread farther into it, the water slaps against their legs and Steve shivers against the cold, his arm and shoulder screaming in pain.
Tony steps up to his omega, snaps open the top of the breastplate to reveal the gland. He leans down and bites it, drinking in the elixir like its mana from heaven. It tastes divine. The omega shudders and, as Tony moves away, closes his eyes. “You’re mine, remember that. Should I punish you for your transgressions?” Tony wants to add again but doesn’t.
Before Steve accepted the offered hand, he bowed his head and said, “Is that still true? Are we still mates?”
“Do you even know his name?” Tony spat back at the man. How dare he stand there, cool and collected, as if this travesty was normal. Was it? What other seconds did Howard hide?
When the room resolves around him again, he’s flat on his back and Frigga has a cool cloth on his forehead. “Steven? Ah, there you are. Quiet now. It’s a process and dear Tony is apparently not very patient. I told him to go take a walk.”
“Apologize and tell him you’ll respect his vow. He’s a man of his word, Tony. You know that. It’s one of the things that makes him
“No.” Pierce stayed perfectly composed. Ross delighted in the performance. Pierce smiled at Clint. “He eats what we give him. He drinks that whole bottle or your youngest will be a snack for the next vampire we capture.”
Tony raised his hand, warding off any further explanation from Steve. “I don’t want to get into who had it worse. It stunk. Our own country did that to us. They tore apart everything. They turned me into this thing. And they-.” He stood up and Steve saw, for the first time, that his whole body shivered. “They tore us apart. They ripped everything away from us. And just for that, I want to kill them all over again. I want to go back to the States and I want to burn it to the ground. I want to fuck them over like they did to us. And you want to know why?” He didn’t give Steve a chance to answer. “Why? Because they took you – you, the most important person in the god damned world, away from me. I promised you, years ago, that we would be together and that I would be there for you.”
“Come, sit. Captain, you know Secretary Ross?” Pierce said as they entered the expansive room with its sleek, gray couches. The tables were glass and metal, reflecting the sunlight streaming in through the ceiling to floor windows.
Tony jolts and realizes he’s still standing at Steve’s hospital bedside. He hasn’t moved, but the nurse with the kindle is next to him, keeping him on his feet with one hand on his upper arm and another on his abdomen. He jerks away from her and focuses on Steve. She doesn’t react – thank god- but does step away. When he looks at Steve, nothing is amiss. In his mind he can still feel Steve’s touch, he can still experience every subtle beauty, but the echoes of horror whisper over the vision.
“Hmm, why are you here?” Steve said as he peered down the hallway and adjusted the straps of his bag that hung on his back.
Barnes is on his feet. “He loves you. Loves you like no one else. He sees you as the perfect omega. He never want you knowing he’s not the perfect alpha. That he’s Hermi!”
Steve digs in, though gagging a little on the meat and pushing it away. The cook keeps Steve handily in stacks of waffles for the next hour. After the Merry finishes cooking the breakfast and cleaning the waffle maker, Tony thanks her and dismisses her.
Pepper and Rhodes break their conversation and rejoin them. Pepper nods to Happy. “Can you give us a minute?”
Tony’s touch grounded Steve, and he clung to it as a child might clutch for safety. He glanced around the room – a hospital bay in a strange land. The weakness that had plagued him when he’d woken on the Helicarrier left only vague strands of memory. His strength returned as he breathed through the confusion. He felt his lung fill easily, his heart pump robustly, and he sighed in relief. Tony petted him and said, “We think you’ve turned the corner.”
“The mating blocks?” She shakes her head.  “Steve, you know that you can’t possibly go there and expect not to be recognized.” She folds her arms across her chest. She’s staring at him, fierce, firm. His energy, his heat, grows and he knows he might just fall on his knees in front of her and beg her to ease the pain, but he can’t. The team – or what is left of it – can’t be broken again. He can’t expect others to help him anymore. He’s on his own. He’s been there before – but he knows that’s a lie. He needs to stop lying to himself.
“You wanted to have the right to live without pain,” Peggy said. “You’re allowed that, Steve.” She supported him even as she stood a few steps away from him, giving him the space he needed. “You’re safe now.”
“And Sam, keep an eye on Tony. Don’t let him follow me,” Steve said and quickly disconnected to stop any interrogation. Was that necessary? The ramming of his heart in his chest like he’d just run the distance from the city to the safe house and back again told him he was playing a dangerous game. He didn’t want Tony to misinterpret what was going on. Yet, Tony focused only on one thing – the fact that someone with Bucky’s face killed his parents.  No matter how many times Steve uttered – but it wasn’t Bucky – Tony might never accept it as truth. So, Steve only had a one way avenue to take and that meant keeping Tony in the dark – for now. Just for now until he figured out what the hell to do. He’d come clean – just like he had with the information about Tony’s parents. It wouldn’t end up sacrificing everything they’d built over the last few weeks.
“Let me show you the truth, Captain, let me show you, you’re not damned,” Tony says and kisses him with a light, drag of a dry kiss. It titillates more than submerges him into the moment. And then Tony pauses, hanging over Steve waiting.
In his current position, the omega cannot get a good rhythm so Tony does it for him. Grasping him by the waist with his left arm and gripping his cock with his right hand. He pushes his own groin against the omega. Even through his trousers his hard cock presses against the omega’s cleft.  The man is skin and bones against Tony, but his own nature, his own needs heightens in his blood and he wants nothing more than to knot the omega. The scent of the omega thrills Tony and he longs to taste the bonding gland.
Tony reaches out because his brain is scattered and confused; that rarely, if ever, happens to him. He touches Steve’s wrist. “Steve, I’m not sure what you’re trying to say to me.”
And so it starts – a long stretch of weeks where Tony visits Steve on days he has ‘off’. They fuck, they watch television. They get take out. Tony tries to ignore the fact that Steve won’t take any money at all from him anymore. He tries to ignore the fact that sometimes a musky smell hangs on Steve. He tries to ignore the fact that there are fingerprints, bruises on Steve’s hips some days. He tries to ignore the fact that Steve’s friends are ill and getting worse as the days go by no matter how many times Steve sells himself and collects more money. He tries to ignore where all the money goes.
He pretended to be Captain America as a child, even went as his idol for several Halloweens. The pride he took in making his own shield for trick or treating energized him the entire night as his mother doting on him.  Yet, as far as his father was concerned,  it was all for naught. His father would grumble and scowl at him; nothing Tony ever did seemed to please the man. So Tony tore down all the posters, got rid of the Captain America sheets, burned his comic books, and laughed at his father when the idiot went looking for Rogers again – decades after the man had put a plane in the cold ocean waters.
“No, sir,” Steve says and fists his hands. He’s been confined to purgatory for the last seventy years where Guardians go when they cannot earn their wings. Ever since Bucky fell to the evil of Hydra and Steve could not catch him. Steve tried to rectify the sin, but what was done, could not be fixed. Not without another sacrifice, and the sacrifice ended up being Bucky himself. Steve shivers.
"You're not damned, you know," Tony says, as if he’s read Steve’s thoughts, knows his reservations. He's not deterred at all and this surprises Steve. He would have guessed that a person like Tony, someone born into and used to all that the best of society could offer, would be angry, even dissuaded in his pursuit, but he isn't. Instead, Tony offers words to soothe what he perceives is Steve discomfiture.
“Well, someone is. With the multiple assassination attempts and now the attempt on you.” Happy sniffs as if he’s trying to clean away a repulsive odor.
They talk a little more about Avengers business but fall into more intimate conversation as Tony explains his falling out with Pepper. “She couldn’t accept me as Iron Man. I understand her distress, but I couldn’t sit on my hands. It’s who I am.”
As Tony turns away to retrieve some of the small amount of water he has, Steve mutters under his breath. “It isn’t working. I can still feel them. You have to get me out of here.”
“Who is him?” Tony said and seriously considered whether or not he should be in the car with Bruce alone. Yet, they’d spent time together in Tony’s labs, and nothing had ever happened.
“Yeah. They wanted to keep me there. I wanted to see the city one last time,” Steve says and then must realize what he inferred. “Not that this won’t work.”
Steve follows him with a quiet demeanor. He tries to assist Tony, but he fumbles a lot and starts to try and cover himself with his arms. When he cuts himself with one of the sharp edges of the armor plates, he bends over and starts to lick at the wound. Tony grabs his hand and stops him.
“Have to admit not much of a fan myself. My ears aren’t as sophisticated, though I do love old 40s music. My mom used to listen to it a lot because it reminded her of her mom. I guess it’s tradition in a way,” Steve says as he recalls his mom slowly dancing in the kitchen as she did the dishes. “She used to dance to it all the time. By herself. Dad died when I was barely a year old, but she would close her eyes and dance in the kitchen like Dad held her.”
“Not like this,” Steve said and sat back, away from Sam. “Not even close to this. It’s real or it feels very real.  I think it might have something to do with the soul bond.”
Tony smiles that engaging turn of his lips and his eyes sparkle. Steve only rolls his eyes; he has a feeling this is the way it’s going to be – Tony charming everyone in town.  “Phil, thought you would have met the new blacksmith by now, this is Tony Stark. Phil Coulson.”
Tony shrugs as Steve continues to assist him over the uneven ground. “Vision is part of some European band or something. He likes the name. I don’t know. He’s Jarvis’ nephew. He only hangs out here to help because he needs the money.” Steve chuckles a little and some hope that Tony didn’t even know he had withers on the vine. “How’s that funny?”
Tony hisses and opens his eyes, glaring at Steve. “I want you to mak-. Fuck. I want you to fuck me.”
“We see it through your eyes. You project what you saw. That’s one of the abilities we have as demons.” He touches his face right between his red eyes. “It gives you the vision to see other’s reality in this realm.”
By the time he enters the kitchen the chef – an older woman with a look of a Pekingese dog that Tony never remembers exactly her name– has served an amply pile of blueberry waffles (not pancakes), alongside a bowl of fresh fruit, and a carafe of coffee. Next to his plate there is an empty plate waiting for an order. Tony asks, Mrs. Merry (well that’s what he’s going with right now and she doesn’t correct him) to load his husband’s plate up with eggs, bacon, and some waffles. Merry nods and toddles off to prepare the meal.
“Yeah, my daughter loves the story,” Scott chimes in but Steve can’t see him. In fact he can’t see any of them anymore. “The one Prime and one Omega are destined for one another. Their fate is tied to the fate of the world. They’ve always been together. One generation after another.”
Blu puts the armor plate down and then tenderly lies down next to Tony, manipulating him without success.
“What?” Steve jumps off the bed and crosses the room in one breath. Unlocking the door, he peers out. “Clint didn’t make it?”
During the flight, Strange pulls out a deck of cards. It surprises Steve that Strange would invite him to play a card game. They go through several rounds of gin rummy, but then Strange decides that games aren’t what he’s interested in. When he starts the magic tricks with the cards, Steve understands his real motive for the deck. He’s a master of illusion and Steve as well as the medics are amazed at the tricks. Tony ambles out of the sleeping cabin, his face haggard and his expression downcast. He ends up sitting next to Steve, watching but not really processing. Steve’s about to question Strange about it, but he quietly acknowledges it and whispers about the side effects of the medications.
In the moments that Steve’s allowed by the motion of the ship, he glimpses the sheer greatness of the Avengers starship. It’s unlike any battle cruiser or carrier that Steve’s ever seen or read about. It’s unbelievably large. It speaks to how very little that Steve’s seen of the ship. “How big is your ship?”
Steve only shakes his head. “I need to swim.” He doesn’t turn back to Tony, he only submerges himself into the healing oceans of the Earth. The salt water washes away the pain, the evil tainted there. He wonders if he could bathe in the waters and come out a different man. But then he recognizes he was never a man, and he shouldn’t want or have desires like a man. He’s a higher being, he should be free of these mortal yearnings.
“What the bond actually is? Will we communicate through it? Or just feel each other as team mates? What is it?” Bruce maneuvered the broom under the lab bench and swept up the shattered glass.
“No, not him.” Bucky wasn’t looking at Tony. He was standing up straight, staring at his friend through the window. “I’ve been around him plenty of times when he flirted with death.” He glanced at Tony and then back at Steve. “And let me tell you that little pisspot likes to flirt with death. Maybe not with dames or,” he stumbled over the words, “guys, but death – death is his mistress. He knows how to dance with her. He never quite finishes the dance, you gotta bring him back. It’s gotta be you. You know that, right?”
Tony squirmed inside because he’d tried to retire several times. Being Iron Man had become part of his definition. It was in his blood. Was it an infection or was it written in his DNA? The idea of leaving it behind – that was an entirely different road in life. When he glanced at Steve, a conflict of emotions warred across his features. The same feelings ached in Tony. Envy was an ugly thing, but when it mixed with relief it turned into something sickening.
“It is. Except when it isn’t,” Tony says and ushers him through the swing gate as it automatically accepts their passage.
“JARVIS?” Tony hands the steaming mug to Clint and then sets up his own coffee. He’s being too nice today. Something must be wrong with him. “JARVIS?”
“Got ya!” Tony said and didn’t wait around for Bruce to leave. Instead, he hustled his way to the bedroom en-suite and shed his clothes as he headed for the shower. JARVIS had the water steaming as he stepped into the large marble tiled shower with multiple shower heads. Tony stood in the stream and let the water hit him as he thought over what he’d learned in the dreamscape. If he knew anything now, it was that what happened in the dreamscape would affect their lives in the here and now. He had no other choice but to confront it and deal with the consequences. At least now, he knew that Bucky would eventually accept them – poor bastard.
Blu picks up his head and blinks. Lions sleep a lot. No wonder any time they went to the San Diego Zoo when he was a child, the lions were always clunked out. He just assumed they were bored in their enclosures. Blu yawns at him and drops his head back to the ground. Tony shakes him.
Below him Steve undulates to the feel of Tony’s fingers pressing into him. The sensual way he moves his body winds tight in Tony’s groin and he groans a little in response. Finally, he gets through to him. “Huh?”
Thor took a seat on a stool at the island. “I find myself thinking the same thing. Once, I dreamed of being the King of my people. I would conquer all the realms, I would sit in the Hall of Asgard and rule. Now, I wouldn’t wish that on my darkest enemy.”
“You always get up. Always stand up.” She coughed, and blood streaked her chin. Steve only stayed silent by her side. His grief too much to bear, too much of a burden to offer any more comfort. “Don’t let — them. Don’t let them beat you down.” Sara shuddered. Sweat covered her gray face.
“You know I don’t,” Tony said, and he felt the quiver of tears – vampire tears bloody and red- streak his cheeks. Steve leaned down and lightly kissed them away.
During that summer though, Stark Industries had invited a number of promising interns – post-doctoral fellows to train at the complex. Most ended up working with Tony. A few were in the bio-division. One woman, a young twenty something year old, used to sit in the common area outside to eat her lunch. She sat alone and most of the time looked distant and too cold to approach. One day, though, she sat there curled over her sandwich chewing but Tony guessed not even tasting it. He wasn’t the kind of kid with a lot of empathy, but he had fought with Howard the night before and he wanted some distance. He ended up sitting next to her at the picnic table outside the large buildings. She side eyed him but didn’t say anything. He didn’t have a lunch with him. He just wanted space. He remembered thinking that he should have just gone alone on the walking path around complex. But then she spoke.
“Is it true that Captain America attacked the US government today?” one yelled as phones and microphones were stuck in Tony’s face.
Steve hurries into his quarter and immediately taps his implant requesting to speak with Scott at the Brothel. He refuses to talk to Wanda; her accent will come on thick as she tells him what a mistake he’s making. Scott’s a much easier ear to talk to – at least Steve hopes that to be the case.
The medics come in and immediately report to Steve. They are Stark Industries’ employees and have non-disclosure agreements. Under Pepper’s instruction, they will transport Tony along with Steve to the mainland and transfer them over the a medically fitted jet that will wait on the tarmac for Doctor Strange to arrive. Once he has arrived then they will fly back to New York.
Cho did something to him. He doesn’t know what, but whatever she did it’s playing havoc with the serum and with his ability to function. Standing, he grasps the sink’s edge and stares into the mirror. A horror greets him. His eyes are deep wells, his skin sallow and hanging. He closes his eyes, swallows and reaches for the faucet, but before he touches it, he hears a voice.
Alone, he can admit that things are even stranger than he wanted to confess to Bruce. While it might be a funny little joke about his lack of a physical relationship with Steve, the fact remains that every time they get close Steve begs off. He hustles away as if Tony’s a swarm of angry bees and he’s allergic. Tony cannot fasten down what’s wrong. Bruce is correct, Steve spent the last year after the Battle of New York traveling the world with Logan. Maybe Steve’s just not interested.
“No,” Clint said. “Laura tried to accept it. That we mated, and it was destined to happen. She tried. I don’t blame her for it. We were a happily married couple with kids. Then Natasha came into my life and – things changed.”
Steve only shakes his head and drops to his knees in from of the alpha. “I’m sorry. I deserve to be punished. I shouldn’t have come. I shouldn’t even be talking.”
Tony considered them. He felt like he was on the playground and everyone was triple dog daring him to stick his tongue on a frozen pipe. That was not going to happen, but still the noise in his head ratchetted up a degree and then the grinding pain in his belly and leg hit. He recoiled and Natasha grasped his hand and yanked.
“Excuse me, what?” He hates that he has to look up, straining his neck. He should have stayed in the suit.
Tony stands. “Tell me you don’t sense something off about him with the Asgardians. No one dislikes Thor, no one.”
Tony shivered under his touch and a single blood tear trailed down his cheek. “Tell me what you see?”
Steve holds the hand with the smashed fry. “No, Tony.” Steve peels his fingers open to release the crumbs of the fry. “You’re not reading this wrong. I can’t -.”
“You want to do this in the gym?” Natasha asked. The doubtful look radiated not only a dismissive attitude but also some distrust. The latter was normal for her, but the former – not so much when it came to Steve.
“Steve, I-. I didn’t expect you here tonight,” Tony says and glances over at Pepper. She smiles and offers her hand to Steve.
“What?” Natasha said but both Bruce and Steve remained mum. She rolled her eyes at them but then Steve hustled to leave the conference room, heading toward the infirmary. He didn’t need anyone else listening in on his thoughts. Would this future just leave him be for a little bit?
The door opens and Tony’s on his knees in front of a guy with spiky hair, wearing two hearing aids, a purple t-shirt, pajama bottoms and a ratty looking bathrobe. He looks like someone ran him over last night and then came back to run him over a few more times this morning.
Tony grinned. “Then you’ll be happy to know that Clint’s wife said we had to double up in the sleeping arrangements.”
The Red Knight looks toward the hearth and then back to him. “Yes, only demons insist on a real name.” He settles on the edge of the bed without asking permission. “You know what that gives us? Autonomy. It’s our way out. Our way to find a new life.”
“Yep. I have a few loyal people around me who help. You’re in that select few now, Steve. Can you handle it?” Tony wants to move this along. He’s tired and he still needs to get Steve to understand how to walk with him, how to steer him through crowds. How to be his eyes.
Before Steve dissolves into the feelings echoing through Tony, Steve pulls back and asks, “You know I never knew. Why didn’t you tell me? I thought my feelings were only just mine.”
“Why wouldn’t it?” Tony asked. “We regularly share dreams in your 1940s tenement apartment. Why not share the moment of my mother’s death?” The tension wasn’t there this time, the words were angry but hopeless, and that terrified Steve.
“You know, I was there. I watched as they hung him on the tree. I sent the iron skewer through his chest.” Rumlow laughed. “He’s a corker, I can tell you that. Fights like a fucking mad dog. Bit quite a few of the Agents. Almost tore one of their heads off. Except we used the wood poisoned gloves.”
“Then I did my job. Stay safe, Tony.” He hung up and something deep inside him quivered with fear. If everything that Sitwell, Fury, and Hill said was right, then people like Tony would be on the chopping block. He had to keep focused, on target and not let his emotions lead the way. Even when it came to Bucky, even when it came to Tony. He did what he could and now he needed to zero in on the one thing of importance. The mission.  As he went to meet up with his team, he spoke the Mantra out loud.
Steve beams and shakes his hand. “Good to meet you, Prince Anthony. Though I usually don’t, you know, sleep with older men.”
The sword swings downward, sluicing through the air. The sound of it cuts out the silence. It’s a jagged thing and Steve barely has time to pull the shield from his back and block the vicious attack. Using the shield as his weapon and his defense Steve attempts to gain ground on the Ultron construct of Clint.  Unfortunately, Steve realizes too late that the only thing he can control in this world, is his reactions to it. Assuming the world around him remains stable and defined weakens his ability to protect himself.
“It will be your last duty as my PA,” Tony says, and he can’t keep the wistful tone out of his voice.
“Isn’t natural,” Steve whispers but nonetheless combs his hair and shaves for the second time today. He dusts off his boots and polishes them with some spit and elbow grease. He curses low and under his breath. At least there’s no one here in his little room above the jail. “Just for once, I want to try this just this once.”
“No. No! You’re the Red Knight. Devil of the Realm set to steal all the souls to torture-.” His memory falls back to the Soul Keeper and the Chambers Below – where the Silver Knight is not allowed to attend.
“So what? You think he’s- what? Ashamed?” Tony asks. He yells over to the lion. “Hey! You eat one of them, more power to you!” The lion rumbles and heaves his muscular body up. He turns around and gazes at Tony, licking the blood from his face. It sends a shiver up Tony’s spine. Holding up his hands Tony says, “No harm done. Just congratulating you on a meal well served, I think.”
“What the hell was that? What did you mean by that?” Something wild and untamed dances in those eyes of fire.
Tony drifted over to the bedside to watch Steve sleep. He looked young, innocent, almost at peace with life. The wounds on his neck puckered and scabbed. Over the next day the serum would work its magic and they would vanish. He reached out and touched the pulse point on Steve’s throat. Life. Something that he left behind. Did he miss it? Was immortality and the vampire curse worth it? Being with Steve made it worth it. Natasha had it right that his undead life centered on Steve – not on the coven, not on the many conclaves all over the world, not on the current political state of affairs. On Steve. Steve saved him from a long, undead life of loss.
Steve grimaces and then like a sleeper slowly wakes to Tony’s request. “It’s important to me too. What’s going on, Baby?”
“I love you.” He hears his voice before he recognizes that he’s saying it out loud and not in his head. He feels the comfort of arms around him and he smiles. “Blu.”
Steve bit back his words. Hawkeye took charge. He went forward to the cockpit and said something to Natasha Steve hadn’t caught – or maybe he had but his brain refused to process it. When the Quin Jet landed on the pad at the Tower, Steve escorted Tony down the rampway, with only Sam in tow. Everyone else stayed on board. Steve turned to question, but Hawkeye waved him off.
“But what about the rest?” Sam said. “We went into the fight of our lives without Bruce. Bruce, the big guy. He shouldn’t have stayed on the sidelines. We can communicate through the bond, maybe not direct thoughts, but enough that it would have helped to find you. It’s time, Steve.”
“Yes, sir!” Tony giggles. “This was tremendous, Steve. Can we do it again?” He bends to speak into Steve’s ear. “I bought the leather; can we please do it again. All day long.”
His need to get to the distant shore accelerates with each splash of the waves. He knows Tony’s in trouble, his expression, the paleness of his face scares Steve more than he’s willing to admit. As he firms up his grasp of the ropes, he kicks Shield faster, but then he hears a choked, gurgled response from behind as the snow flies in a flurry around them.
The doctor might be insane, Tony concludes. His brain blanks as he listens to the woman who looks like an Amazonian. She is tall and handsome in a beautiful way, and incredibly, unmistakably insane. Or an idiot. He’s not sure yet.
“Welcome to the outer rim.” Tony starts down the path to the house before Steve grabs his collar and jerks him back.
Bruce shakes his head and makes little noises that dismiss Tony’s words. “No, no, no. We all know that he met up with Logan or Wolverine or whatever that guy is called, and then spent the year with him. They traveled the States, went to Japan. From what I hear they lived together over there. They were an item.”
“Not now.” He could have asked for a vampire to please, please save him. He could have begged for Shuri to perform some magical scientific intervention to bring his friend back to him. Nothing mattered. It wasn’t their responsibility. Steve had done this – Steve had left Sam to fend for himself, thinking that saner minds would prevail.
“I thought we already figured that one out,” Tony said as he went through the newest diagnostics on the reactor. He never turned to look at her. “Ross declare all vampires enemies of the state?”
He closes up and asks to be left alone. They cede to his wishes and he turns onto the bed, and curls up. He wonders what memories are true. He used to be small, he was small. Is that a lie now, is that part of the delusion of being Captain America - the origin story. He feels wrong in his body, like the skin he's wearing is too big, he feels lost and concealed. The whole of his body suffocates him and he wheezes. He cannot breathe as he thinks about the loss of everything, his whole world, lost to memories eaten by injury replaced by false ones. A fabrication of time and space and he's in someone else's body, but then he's not. He doesn't know who he is.
