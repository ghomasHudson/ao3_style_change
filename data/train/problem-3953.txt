“Gee, Cas. No happy birthday? I didn’t think you were that cold hearted.” Dean replies, bitterly. Castiel doesn’t know how to respond. So he just ducks his head and tries not to feel too humiliated.
Of course, now, his current guards are placed outside the meeting chambers so Dean is greeted by no one as he strides across to the double doors and with a deep breath of courage – for there is no way out now – slips inside the king’s chambers.
The only thing he can change is how Castiel sees him. Because it's clear he hates his guts. But even if this doesn't work out, Dean just wants him to know that he never forgot about him. He just misunderstood.
They hit it off soon after that – the beers probably helping them to start – and the night goes on rather well. They talk about everything from general life to each other. Castiel learns about what Dean’s doing at university and where he comes from and Castiel dishes much the same. The topic of family – although Castiel’s not too keen to get into it – surprises him, finding that he has much more in common with Dean when it comes to family than he thought.
They walk in formation until every man has crested the hill. There are thousands of them. Enough to outmatch their army by a few hundred perhaps. But it’s only half their forces. They received word the other half were staying behind to protect the castle from invasion.
Dean lets out a shaky breath and rises. He dresses quickly, sitting down at his desk to stare at an unopened book in front of him. He thought that maybe with Castiel gone that whatever this is he feels might go away. But it never did, of course it never did, and when he saw him, standing there in the hall – hair mussed and eyes bright--
“Okay,” Dean says, and something lights up inside of him at Castiel’s words. It’s finally there for him to hear, not just something he has to guess. “You don’t have to be nervous.” And it’s so strange. Because that’s what Castiel should be telling him. But at least Dean has experience, even if it’s not with a man, it’s more than Castiel has.
Suddenly, he has the strange sense that he’s being watched. He looks up but the two guards outside of the door aren’t paying him any attention. He sweeps the small garden in front of him but no one’s there. He sweeps his gaze across the entire castle and there – a shadowy outline in the dark. Standing on Dean’s balcony.
“He’ll come back,” she says, sudden and sure. She squeezes his hand and Dean holds her eyes as she says it. “From wherever he’s gone. He’ll come back.”
Something deeply unsettling sits heavily in his gut. “No, tomorrow you and Sam will wait back with the healers,” he says, voice firm but he feels it’s weakening.
“And you’re beautiful.” Castiel’s lower lip tremors as a tear falls and Dean’s heart aches for him. “And I don’t understand how no one else can see what I see.”
Training is brutal. Much to his surprise, Dean takes them out into the fields but only just outside of the training hall itself giving them enough privacy for Dean to try and stare him straight into the underworld but not enough for them to speak freely.
William appears at the door of the carriage, helping both Sam and Castiel down the steps, Dean following closely behind and straight into the open door to the small inn waiting for them. The warm smell of freshly baked bread hits his nostrils as soon as he steps foot over the threshold. It's enough to have his mouth watering.
To believe the true story. Gods of Light and Dark. A fallen angel taking the fight into its own hands. The fall. The Three. The demon. The prophecy.
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean says, breaking into a run, his sword swinging back and forth against his side. Somehow along the way, he finds himself smiling. Not a big smile. Just a small one. Because he likes this.
“No, Dean, it’s – I’m not complaining. It’s just…” His brows crease. “Mixtapes take a long time to make.”
Eventually though, Dean has to pull away for air, but he doesn’t stray far, his head resting against Cas’. He smiles and the angel smiles too. It’s followed by the snap of the camera and this time they hear it.
Dean blinks, turning to find Elaria standing by him. A little way off, Emery kneels beside the boy, Adri, Catharlo standing, in new clothing for once. His guard’s uniform finally gone.
A guard shifts at Dean’s side but at the turn of Dean’s head, the guard stops. He turns back towards Castiel, head tilted to the side. “That perhaps you should fear me. That you should respect me.” Castiel stares back blankly. Dean’s eyes are dark in the dim light. “I can see that you don’t do either of those things. But we have time. Time to change that.”
Castiel lets his eyes close for a second before walking out to stand beside him. Dean pointedly looks out to sea, not acknowledging his presence.
For those who missed it, I was unfortunately sick all week from the first new meds but I've discontinued them as they just seem to not be working out at all and I was able to finally get the chapter up even though it was a little over the weekly schedule, so my apologies. The next chapter will hopefully be up in a weeks time so Thursday ~8/9pm AEST but I'll update here if it's not! Thank you all again for your lovely comments! They really help and encourage me <3
The answer as it has been since Dean fell, is plain on his face. For all the young boy does is cry more. With that, the woman follows and Reyne can do nothing but look on, unable to heal the grief in their hearts.
Castiel doesn’t waste another second, jumping forward, and Patrus’ meets his swords with a hard clash.
She nods down towards where Castiel and Dean’s hands are still tangled together and then raises her glass.
The guard opens his mouth to speak but another cuts him off. “Let him have it. It’s not going to do anything.”
“Sam, are you hurt?” Dimarus asks barely a moment after they’ve started moving. Mervyn and Sam both shake their heads, the former clearly already having checked.
It’s almost as though they have spent the last decade of their life preparing for this single moment.
"So, I'm gathering you liked the first one." Castiel peeks up through his glasses as he scans the book through.
Or worse, what if they’ve killed him? Because they can’t count on Castiel being able to bring him back now. For Castiel himself may not be alive at the end of this to do so.
"I'm glad to hear it." There's a small pause in conversation and Castiel looks around to find Dean's thoughts clearly somewhere else and Sam flicking his eyes between all of them quietly. "How about you all eat and have something to drink. I'm sure you're famished. And once you're done, we'll be in the kitchens so give us a call and we'll take you to your rooms and give you some peace and quiet to rest."
Dean turns back to Castiel and reaches a hand out. For a second, Castiel looks at it, not sure what he’s doing when Dean just rolls his eyes and grabs the sword from Castiel. He places the two swords back on the wall and starts walking back inside the castle.
The ninth is perfect. Her hair is light brown, matching the hazel of her eyes. She’s flirtatious and forward, her smile wide and mischievous.
“You said Leuric didn’t beg. And I am their descendant after all. Their replacement. What makes you think I would beg?” Castiel says, raising his daggers.
Another kick to the stomach has Castiel pulling his legs to his chest. He only needs to last until his head stops swimming and then he can show them what he can do.
He opens his eyes as he hears the door handle creak, heart lurching in his chest. Dean's breath hitches beside him and he hears Sam slap a hand over his mouth.
The guards were on the prowl for blood even more so when they’d been told he was some unhinged sinner – something that had Catharlo’s insides knotting.
Dean to his surprise doesn’t throw his hands in the air in a cheer that he expects him to but narrows his eyes at the comment, face sincere as he says, “Really?”
He can see it now. A young boy cowering in the corner, a dagger in his hand, already bearing too much despite the world around him asking for more.
“Don’t what? Say you fell for me.” Dean’s hands clench and unclench by his side as his eyes start to tear up. “Because you did. I know you did.”
Dean rubs his free hand over the back of his neck and toes his boots against the floor - which Castiel finds nothing but endearing - and nods. "Yeah, I was wondering if you could recommend me something else?"
They continue to follow Castiel's directions trudging through the sewerage that flows slowly beneath their feet, all the while Dean listens for the alarm bells of the castle. Castiel's skin is cold and clammy beneath his fingers and Dean scans his body for the wounds. There are too many to count and Dean hopes that once they are safely away, Castiel can heal them properly.
The most interesting part, however, is that the more he talks, the more Castiel feels like he understands Dean. He’s kind and smart and really funny – although he’ll never admit that last one – and while he can be loud at times and seemingly give of the vibe of no care in the world, he’s quiet and a good listener and cares deeply.
Dean hesitates, unsure of what he’s said wrong. “Daddy’s boy, then,” he jests but Castiel’s eyes are already flicking away towards the dorm building.
“I’m not saying it because I might not come back,” he says, and it aches inside of Castiel, settles deep into his bones but Dean’s eyes remain ever steady. “I’m saying it because it’s the truth. I love you, Castiel.”
“So for the lucky fifty thousand viewers who are watching this live - most of which seem to be in this hallway,” Dean smirks, earning himself a collective laugh from the students, “you guys get to see my partner of two years now, first hand! And brace yourselves because they are somehow the hottest and most adorable person I have ever seen.”
He stares at his meal before him, pondering Mary’s words before he finally takes his untouched bowl back to the kitchen and leaves the hall to the rising camp.
“No,” he says, a little too forcefully. How can she know? Well, perhaps because he is the person who Dean currently spends the most time with and therefore the most alone time with. But why does she look almost…panicked?
“Quite the experience, Prince Sam. I have never been on the inside of a castle before.” He never had the pleasure of entering the royal castle in Iowan. Well, at least not
Reyne trudges into camp to find everything packed and many of the injured bandaged and cared for by the healers. He finds Nyree by the wagons speaking to someone. He waits patiently a few yards away when he spots movement over the princess’s shoulder.
Walking through the halls, Castiel notices any guards or even servants and maids that walk past nod or bow their heads towards the prince, in which Dean responds with a raise of the chin. And to his surprise, most of them also offer him a smile but as Castiel trails behind him, he can’t tell if Dean offers one back.
He hasn’t seen Michael cry since… Well, since after the invasion when he cried for their parents. For everyone. Before he shut the sorrow away and turned it into rage instead. Turned it into pain and malice.
“Dean, I wasn’t going to kiss any of those girls. Why would you possibly think that?” Cas says, his voice calm despite all of Dean’s yelling. Dean sighs and the soft, confused look on his boyfriend’s face makes all of his anger dissipate.
Nothing interesting ever happens in this castle anymore. It’s not his fault if alongside proving his worth that he wants to indulge in figuring this mystery out.
They stuffed him with food and water not long after he blinked his eyes open. It appeared that others that had just been brought back also felt a little off their feet but since Dean had run after the demon at full speed merely moments after breathing his first breath, it was not surprising that he reacted so.
Dean holds his eyes, doesn’t let them slip away. “But to threaten Sam, your youngest son, a mere boy who had nothing to do with this – who had done nothing wrong…” He lets his words hang in the air, his feelings clear.
Dean raises a slow hand, caresses Castiel’s cheek as the other finds the warm skin of his hip, and feels him melt under his touch. He kisses Castiel slow, savouring every moment, every touch. Castiel’s hands are hesitant at first on his waist before his kiss becomes firmer and he grips the fabric of Dean’s shirt, untucking it from his trousers.
Castiel’s throws his jacket over his desk chair, so Dean does the same. He wanders over to the desk then, eyeing the assignment papers spread about before his eyes are drawn to the pin board above it, littered with what appear to be film quotes.
Castiel places the letter down on the table, frowning as he stares out the window, thoughts clearly elsewhere. Dean leans over and grabs the letter, flicking his gaze over it. It's short and vague. No location is mentioned – only the letters NE for north-east sentry point. There are no names – no address but there is a small N at the bottom of the page. He wonders if that's their leader.
"Anyways, so the actual point of this letter was to ask this." Castiel takes a deep breath. One more line and then this is over. "Dean Winchester, will you go to prom with me." It's supposed to be a question. But he doesn't read it out like that because it shouldn't be. Because the whole letter was ridiculous on the first place.
“Oh, Dean,” Charlie says joyfully, eyes lighting up. “It’s Leda, isn’t it?” Dean would laugh if it wasn’t for the nerves twisting inside of him. “I always thought--”
But he doesn’t feel any eyes on him and when Castiel glances over, Dean’s speaking to his friends as usual, back towards him. Castiel deflates in relief but it’s met with a strange sinking feeling. He shakes his head, standing and making his way down to the track, calling for everyone to follow.
“There was a ceremony at dusk. I was granted the wings. It was…almost surreal. They didn’t look like much. Just ashes at first. But then, it’s almost as if they recognised me as their true owner. And suddenly they were no longer ashes, but light. My eyes and veins lit up as the light poured over me, into me. I remember feeling broken. The same as I had for years. And then suddenly, all of my pain…gone. I had been healed. I was going to live. I barely even thought of the implications of it. I didn’t understand what it meant to be the Last Angel. You see, despite the wings on our backs, all of us, all angels are human. But with all of the Three, I wouldn’t be human any longer. I would be an angel. That’s why the prophecy says the Last Angel.”
“I don’t care what your fucking duty is!” Dean yells and Castiel flinches, stepping backwards. The grip on his heart gets tighter. “I can’t fucking breathe with you around me all the time!”
“And what of the war?” Dean asks suddenly, breaking his train of thought. And there’s that word again. War. He itches to correct it. But he doesn’t know what he can say to justify it. Dean’s eyes and voice are soft as he speaks. “You said you were there that day. What…happened to you?”
As he opens his eyes, he sees the cut on his arm, bleeding slowly down to his wrist. He watches it heal and remembers that time in the woods.
He wonders if it was a coincidence that Dean ended up across from him but glances to the side where his friends seem to be wiggling their eyebrows mockingly in Dean’s direction, tells him his answer.
She looks like she’s about to scream as she holds a hand to her head, as though all of this is giving her one awful headache.
And when they finally part for breath, Dean feels all these words on his tongue, all these things that he wants to say to him that have risen up inside of him in this quiet, empty room as Castiel stands here in front of him but he can’t get any of them out.
Michael is quiet for a few moments, the silence deafening before he breaks it. “You said it yourself,” he says, voice low. “It was your fault you were revealed.”
.” Castiel lays a solid hand on Dean’s shoulder, turning him to face him before he bats Dean’s hands away from where they’re fumbling with the laces of his jacket. “You don’t have to worry about your meeting. I’ve gotten word out that you will come when you are ready.” He takes the laces in his own hands and begins to do them up properly as Dean watches on, mouth parted and chest heaving from exertion. Castiel smiles at the stunned look in Dean’s eye. “You are king after all. And you deserve a nice--"
Emery’s eyes widen and he turns slowly to look at Catharlo. Beside him, Castiel hasn’t noticed, eyes still fixated on reading what is written in stone.
Dean stares at him. "How do you know that?" Castiel stares back. Footsteps to their right have them both turning their heads to find Sam running towards them, torch in hand. And it's far too bright for this dark night, causing Dean to panic. Someone could see it and come searching.
The meeting runs smoothly. The entrusted guards will be leaving for the Ellwood Forest tomorrow, stopping in Lithos on the way. Dean doesn’t really believe what they’re saying. They’ve had rumours like this many times before and they have all been false. Or at least, they’ve never been able to find anything.
“Hey, hey, I’m sorry, alright?” Because maybe he was fucking rude but Dean can’t stand the thought of Castiel being mad at him. Dean’s stomach unknots a little when Castiel appears to soften slightly beneath his pleading gaze. “And you know what? This ain’t so bad. It’ll make them more invested if we throw in a little ‘relationship drama’.”
They get off at their stop together, walking down the street, arms brushing when they get too close.
The twenty or so minutes pass quickly enough and Castiel and Dean are walking hand and hand to the end of his street. Castiel's about to let go when Dean's hand squeezes his own.
“And promise me you will come back to us. Maybe we don’t deserve you. But we need you. I need you, Castiel.” And her eyes shimmer in the light streaming through the foliage above. Castiel’s eyes blur, his throat closing. “You are our hope. You are the bravest of all of us combined. And you will make it back in time.” She squeezes his hand tight.
Dean smiles, face speckled with blood. “Yes. The man I love. The man you tried to ruin. And for that, I will enjoy ruining you.”
Sam stands a moment, awkward and unsure if he should speak. Dean’s unsure too for Castiel is still staring at his bandaged hand in his lap, when Sam instead reaches for something tucked in the back of his belt.
The dark room is silent save for their rough breathing. Castiel’s chest continues to heave, eyes closed as their foreheads rest together and it’s only when Dean’s hand rests lightly on his back – in between his shoulders blades – that it all hits him in a rush.
Dean never emerges enough for Castiel to speak with him and although he understands Dean’s reasoning for keeping away from him, he can’t help but feel wounded. He wishes he could be in there, helping him. Dean himself has helped him enough times – he should repay the favour. He knows he won’t be as good as Dean – he doesn’t know how to comfort others very well – but it would at least be something.
“Perhaps I am being too morbid. Especially too much so for the morning meal.” She rises from her seat, taking her bowl with her. She hesitates. “It is just that I thought I was safe here. From the atrocities I saw out in the world. But now I know of what you suffered at the hands of the angels. And that is why I would share my thoughts with you. I wouldn’t dare with anyone else. I’ll leave you to your peace,” she says, before striding away.
And yet, he thinks, it would not be a bad way to die like this. Fighting for the world. Fighting for himself and who he is.
But at least Castiel hasn’t turned out to be a snob or something nor given him the cold shoulder. In fact, Castiel appears to be liking him. Definitely liking him. Or at least putting up with him. Or is he just really polite?
Castiel rounds into a dark street, most people curled up inside their own homes this hour past midnight, and spots the inn. Turning his head both ways, he makes sure there’s no one around before he slips in behind to find the back entrance. He spies a candle alight inside as he knocks.
He’s hardly put his books back in his bag at the end of it when Castiel is suddenly waltzing past him, an amused shine in his eyes as he says, “See you on Saturday, Dean.”
It’s a relief when he sees where they’re taking him. It means that he’s not going to be killed or sent to the dungeons to rot for the rest of his days. He’s only being punished.
Castiel's head whips up from where he's leaning over his desk. Mr Crowley is walking right towards where he is sitting at the back of the classroom.
Emery shifts on his feet. "A while ago. I told Castiel a while ago as well. And I didn’t know Castiel would be here but this is the closest safe house to the castle. I hoped that’s where he would tell you to go."
"Dean, I don't want him," Castiel says quietly, although it feels like he's screaming it at the top of his lungs. And despite the rowdiness of the party raging on outside, the closet is suddenly dreadfully quiet.
Glancing out towards the gardens, he spies a few guards – none of which thankfully, are looking his way – before making his way carefully along to the window and crouching down beside the opening.
And there is something about it. It feels like a dream. Like he is wading through memories from another lifetime and he cannot figure out what is real and what is not.
And before Dean can say anything more, the darkness begins to spill from her mouth, her nose, her eyes, everywhere and beneath his very finger tips Mary’s body begins to decompose rapidly.
The easy grin finally slips into place. “Well, I was just wondering, you know, if maybe you’d like to go out and get a drink sometime.”
His head's still fuzzy and the light still seems too bright but eventually it clears up and he looks out through the side of the crate to see where he is. The lavish buildings and well-dressed women and men are distinctive.
And wander they do. Over angel after angel, eating and dancing, talking and laughing. Angels of all different ages and races. Wings of all different colours and sizes and in the light of the bonfire, paired with wide smiles and the sound of laughter, they don’t look as terrifying as they did in his dreams. They’re beautiful. Just like Castiel’s own.
Dean nods. “Right,” he grunts, taking a hold of Castiel’s hand and hauling himself up. Dean’s hand is warm and sweaty and actually pretty gross after all that running but for some reason, the touch fills Castiel’s stomach with butterflies as if he’s a teenager all over again.
Castiel chuckles. “Yes, well, thank you for flirting with me until I finally decided to ask you out.”
The man laughs. “Oh, c’mon, now. I ain’t gonna hurt you.” A few of the other prisoners begin to laugh. Castiel focuses on his breathing now – through his mouth to reduce the disgusting smell of the dungeon. In his peripheral vision, he can see the man reach out further again, straining against the bars. “Come now, sweet boy.” Castiel’s toes clench inside his boots at the sound of that name in the prisoner’s mouth. “We haven’t had one like you in a while. I’m sure you’d feel just like one of those ladies in the city’s broth–”
And without any further warning, Castiel disappears before him once more. But this time, as he looks down, he finds he has disappeared too. Catharlo’s breathing grows louder behind him. His grip hardens as he finds all he can see is the tunnel walls around them and dirt beneath them.
The guard’s eye each other and Castiel catches their fear. But this is their duty. They cannot stand down. “Alright, take a partner and we’ll split up. You…” the guard points towards Castiel, the odd one out.
He squeezes his eyes shut and with a heaviness in his chest, he wishes Michael was here. He would know what to do. He would’ve already learned the ins and outs of the castle and all its secrets, driven a sword through the heart of the king or whoever need be and burnt this place to the ground.
So, the thing is, his running crew all found out it’s his birthday on Saturday. And though they claim it was just a coincidence because his brother Gabriel just happened to drop it casually to Anna who he’s good friends with, Castiel knows that they very clearly conspired to get a night off and Anna offered to find his birthday so that they could.
Coaching hasn't always been Castiel's thing. In fact, a few years ago it probably would have been the last thing he would get into. He doesn't choose to be social. But he needs to get out of the house somehow. And so far, this casual running training that he's been holding at the local university track has been doing alright. All of the guys and girls he's been training for the last year have been nice enough and somewhere along the way he began to enjoy turning up every Monday, Wednesday and Friday to run these university students into the ground.
And it’s strange. Because he doesn’t think he’s ever been this nervous about a kiss. And this isn’t even a real one. Because maybe he really
“Did I say you could call me that?” Dean asks, fists clenching at his sides. Castiel doesn’t respond for a moment but eventually he takes a step back, flicking his eyes away in something akin to annoyance.
He can feel tears prick behind his eyes and blinks them back, forcing them away. He can’t show this weakness. It will only prove that this is truly hurting him. And he can’t let them see that. Can’t let them have anything over him. So, he shuns the thoughts from his head and lets his mind shut down completely, like he’s done so many times before.
But it’s only Nicolaus here so most likely a beating. He can deal with that, can’t he? No matter how hard he tries, though, his heart still pounds in his chest.
And Dean is reminded of when they were suspended in air as they cling to each other now, suspended and treading in the water.
He wonders if this was fate. Or if Dean just stumbled in the wrong direction and got swept up in Castiel's fate by accident.
Castiel’s eyes flutter open, his breathing unsteady. The night is still dark and when he sits, he almost thinks he’s still dreaming.
“I will take care of him, Castiel. He will be waiting for you at camp.” Castiel meets Michael’s eyes, lighter than usual before his gaze falls back to Dean.
His chest aches at the mere thought of it. Because even after his betrayal – after everything, what he feels for him…it won’t go away. No matter how hard he tries.
But Castiel’s weak. Because all it sounds to him is another night to spend with Dean that isn’t in a training session and that’s enough for him to say yes, even with the knowledge that everyone else will be there too. That’s how whipped he is.
He wonders where Dean is. If he’s waiting in the in between. If he’s afraid. If he’s free of pain. If he’s hoping Castiel will save him.
“Come,” he says, and the air is charged between them. “I will tell the others you will be coming with me.”
But when they reach his younger brother where he sits speaking to someone on the raised podium that was built just outside the castle gates, he finds it all slipping away.
“I’m sorry, okay? I’m so fucking sorry,” and he’s begging now, “but it was a mistake. I didn’t know and I swear I’ll make it up to you, I swear, Cas.”
“It’s nice to finally meet you in proper, Castiel.” Its voice is like the waves crashing into the rocks. Smooth and rough all at once. The kind of voice that could command armies at a whim. The kind that could command demons. It didn’t speak like that when possessing Mary, hiding itself away.
Her face clouds with anger as she begins charging down the hallway. Dean stands frozen, heart racing, not wanting to hear what she has to say, not wanting her to end their friendship right then and there because he has betrayed her and is a sinner and--
And just like that, she’s finished, packing her things but before she can make it to the door, he speaks, “Alissande.” She turns, eyes wary.
The day has come. He wished it never had. But he’s never been so grateful in such a twisted way. His brother has saved him.
The sound of Sam rushing back into the room has Dean pulling his hand away from Castiel's face - his other hand still clutching Castiel's tight - as he wipes the tears from his own face.
He stabs the god over and over, blood splattering his face again and again but he can’t feel it, can’t feel anything other than the otherworldly rage at his fingertips. Patrus’ chest as ripped to shreds, the fallen god long dead when Dean shouts his name.
There’s a small beat of silence where Castiel dreads looking up because what if Dean’s over him now and he doesn’t like him any--
“Dean, I – it’s not just you.” A broken, strangled sound falls from Dean’s lips and a tear falls down his cheek. Only then does Castiel realise the emotion rising in his own throat, tears pricking behind his eyes. All this time…
“There’s still some blood on your face,” he says, but Castiel doesn’t react, only stares at Dean as though he’s seeing right through him. Dean swallows, deciding to take it upon himself.
But he can’t stop to gather his surroundings, can’t stop to take a breath. Because the last time he stopped, the last time he--
Emery and Catharlo stare at him, lost for words and he’s about to sink to the floor, knowing he’s come so far only to fail, only to fail Dean when he notices the symbol on the wall once more for wings. And like they always do, Michael’s words come to him.
Patrus’ holds his eyes as their swords press against one another. “You seem upset. If it makes you feel any better the night your brother found you, arm healed, blood everywhere and understood what you had done,” Castiel growls, pushing against Patrus’ swords, muscles straining. “What you had tried to do…he left you. And for hours he tried to summon the strength to take his own blade and press it through his own heart.”
“She decided to go travel for the week with a friend of hers out to a small country town in the east.” The final light appears to die from V’s eyes. “There was raid by bandits and guards from the royal castle were sent to help.” Guilt washes over Dean. “And help they did. They eradicated the bandits, killed most and sent the rest fleeing.” She hesitates. “They must have felt they deserved something for it.”
At last he pulls on his clean undershirt but leaves everything else lying in a pile on the floor. Dean glances up at him as he sits down on the stool opposite him. They’re close – close enough that their knees nearly touch.
Castiel turns slightly, resting his head against Dean’s and clutching at his arms as he settles. And Dean holds him firm, tears of his own eventually falling, until the sun is well above the horizon.
This story will have four chapters, roughly around 4k words each. The chapters will be posted every five days so the next chapter will be up on the 10th at ~8/9pm AEST time!
The two men drag him away and away and Castiel continues to scream out but doesn’t hear anyone coming for him. His chest pulls tight, heart clenching. He closes his eyes. This is useless. He knows he can’t do anything – not in this state. He shouldn’t waste his energy. Instead, he goes limp.
Their body reacts, wings fluttering on the ground, muscles tensing but Patrus’ gaze remains passive. And Castiel understands that this is what they want. And Castiel knows he shouldn’t give them that.
Castiel turns to head back into the classroom but before he can he’s whipped back around to face the complete silence and slack jawed students in the hallway.
Because she turns, slower than the sun falling from the sky, to face the white woman. Her eyes are narrowed, her lips pursed and she’s short and solid and her hair is braided and spilling down across her chest.
Dean almost laughs. Almost. “Uh, okay. Great,” he says, remaining as calm and casual as he possibly can but all he can think is goddamn,
He can see her piecing it together because although words travel slow, she would have heard of when the two princes were kidnapped by some crazed sinner.
The king pulls the halo from what must be a hidden pocket in his sleeve. “I also know that your angel is alive.” Dean clenches his jaw, but doesn’t dare drop his gaze. “Oh, don’t be disappointed. I knew from the beginning it was a ruse. You may have been able to fool everyone else but not me. I saw how much you cared for the beast. And I simply let you feel like you could run free so I could catch you in the act of looking for this,” he twirls the ring in his fingers, “and confirm my suspicions that you were working with him and had helped him escape from the castle.”
Some of the students squeal but most of them are looking around confused  as to who it could be. Most of them are eyeing Mrs Braeden or Mrs Talbot.
Dean’s lips turn down, a soft kind of sadness washing over him at the bitterness in Castiel’s voice. He’s never before looked at Castiel and felt sorry for him. Because…well, because his reputation is based off his own wrong actions. But looking at him now, the way he can’t meet Dean’s eyes, the way his lips are pursed in a thin line as he waits for Dean’s response…it doesn’t seem right.
Castiel's eyes flutter shut, the feel of Dean's lips is completely overwhelming but he wants more. Before he can get any further though, Dean is pulling away to the sound of students whistling and Mr Crowley telling them to 'get each other's tongues out of their mouths and get back to work'.
“Yes, I know, okay? But you should’ve seen him, Leda. He’s the best fighter I’ve ever seen and I couldn’t miss that opportunity. And if I did get rid of him how would that make me look? Like a fucking fool, that’s what,” Dean punctuates, raising his voice. “My father wouldn’t trust me with anything ever again.” Leda’s hand on his arm reminds him to take a breath. He’s in company – the guards, while out of earshot, aren’t far behind. He can’t be heard speaking ill of the king. “And he’s interesting.”
He raises his fists again. “Leave me be,” he says, harsh as always before he begins to attack the trunk once more. Castiel almost looks away, not wanting to imagine the pain, even though he himself has known it so closely.
He lurches forward, on his hands and knees once more but the ground is different, green grass beneath him and--
Castiel blinks and suddenly his eyes are wide and glimmering. “Romantic?” he mutters, almost a whisper.
Castiel’s fingers tremble as they brush over his jerkin, flattening the non-existent creases from the fabric. He tries to keep his breathing calm, not wanting the two servants still attending to the last of his attire to notice how terrified he feels.
When he lifts his head, however, Castiel eyes are already on him. Dean wonders if they ever left. And Castiel’s eyes are knowing, seeing all and warm fingers are grazing his cheek before Castiel’s leaning in and capturing his lips with his own.
“Oh, of course. What a coincidence, hey? So good to see you,” John says, before suddenly he’s being dragged into a greeting with Samuel.
They wait as his father makes the slow trail down to the platform. Dean fidgets with the back of his jacket before craning his neck over to Castiel. “What were you doing with those arrows? You know, before at the game.”
The messenger nods. “You’re right. Reyne thinks the demon sent someone human in for the boy. Which possibly means--”
Emery nods. “Good. Because we’re escaping. Now.” He doesn’t waste anymore time, pulling Dean forward by the firm grasp on his wrist. Joren meets his eyes as he passes through the doors, a relieved look in his eye.
It doesn’t take long to find them. At the very back of the camp, waiting with horses and a few supplies already packed.
Dean huffs a rough laugh, standing from the table. “Oh, I’m being selfish. They kidnapped me not you, Cas.”
The sound of his doorknob turning has him whipping his head to the side, hand reaching instinctively for the sword at his bedside. But he retracts it when he sees it’s only Dean. Dressed in his nightclothes with his feet bare, the prince stands in the doorway, the light from their dining hall illuminating the soft lines of his face.
He’s not quite sure why he couldn’t summon the words to tell him the truth but something felt wrong about it. Or perhaps he felt guilty that one of the two very things they had been looking for this entire time to defeat the demon had been sitting on the bookcase in his own chambers for years.
He takes off sprinting, as fast as his legs will take him, almost tripping over the bodies that block his path and now all he can see is the man behind him, Dean’s own family insignia painted across his chest.
“I had to be careful not to be seen. Any of my own soliders would recognise me. But I knew I had to do something. Knowing about the demon now, I had to do my part to protect the prophecy.”
“Dean.” Dean stops, letting his mouth shut. “It’s fine. Really.” And he wants to say more but finds that he can’t. The words just won’t come to him. Or more like the courage. He’s never been good at this.
Reyne attempts and almost succeeds to get his sword on him but Castiel blinks at the last moment and ducks out of reach.
“I’ll get the supplies, then. And the rest of your clothes.” He promptly leaves the table, frowning. When he returns, Castiel is standing by his door. Dean hands everything over.
Something flashes in Castiel’s eyes before he has time to make it out. And then a sigh. “I don’t know if any of it is true.” Something lingers in his voice. “But I do believe. Just like you believe in your own.”
“I don’t think we’ve had a proper introduction,” the older man says beside Castiel. He holds a hand out and Castiel stares at it, swallowing. “Mervyn.”
Questions that he doesn't want to think about right now. The only thing he needs to focus on is getting Castiel and Sam out of this city safely. And once they are, then he can focus on them - then he can dare to ask.
So, instead, he followed Dean all the way through battle, protecting him, saving him, over and over.
He shakes his head, still finding it hard to believe what has happened himself. The angels. The battle. The king… Dead. He’s been quiet for most of the journey, a few times almost insisting to turn around. But there’s nothing for him back there. Most of the guard were killed in battle. And the rest captured and held at the castle. Emery assured him they wouldn’t be executed.
Somewhere along the way to the final tower, Nicolaus decides not to tell the captain and the birthday carnival – while unfortunately moved inside due to the rain – goes on. It goes on and on into the night, everyone, including the Crown Prince himself having a wonderful time despite the weather.
Castiel presses close and he can hear the orders being shouted by Nyree – to fetch hot water and a tub to bring to the cabin. Castiel shivers at the thought, the cold still clinging to his wet skin.
The crowd cheers and Dean finds his gaze falling upon the crowd, taking in the different people. He spots a few familiar faces. Nobles he’s met before, women he’s danced with at balls.
And because of the ball, the library is as empty as it ever will be although it doesn’t stop him from finding the hidden nook he claims as his own – one tucked away on the second floor, towards the back of the large hall. The nook he found on one of the first few nights in this castle when he felt suffocated by all that was his life then. The nook he moons later dragged Dean into when the prince needed a quiet place to breathe.
The ominous threat that’s emanating from the direction of the dungeon becomes stronger as they approach, and Castiel sees a boiling rage in Michael’s eyes as they walk through the door.
How could he be so good with an angel blade, and so bad with a gun? Castiel frowned, handed more tickets to the vendor, and tried once more. This time, he felt he missed by an even wider margin, and he sighed sadly.
As Dean left the kitchen, Castiel could hear him muttering under his breath, but didn't catch what he was actually saying.
It's a good thing he's impervious to temperature, because it is sweltering. "I can't imagine why there are demons guarding an archangel blade. But we need to get to the bottom of it quickly."
Castiel looks again, and yes… he can see the black eyes now. There must be something different about them in this world. He withdraws his angel blade and prepares to strike.
Soft, plush lips pressed to his tentatively, then more firmly. Castiel moaned into it, and he could feel Dean's grin at the sound.
Gently, he begins, "Cas, I think Balthazar's right. He's gonna need someone who's familiar with the blades. And with his affinity for… unscrupulous business practices–"
Bobby and Rufus are working together, as always, and for two old guys they’re doing a damn good job. “These demons are a pain in my ass,” Bobby says, as he dispatches one with a crack shot right between the eyes.
When Castiel and Lucifer fought their way through what felt like every demon in Hell, Castiel had been desperate to get to Dean. Dean’s prayers had become increasingly frantic, and when he finally got to the kitchen he feared he might be too late.
Approaching the open door, he's hesitant to walk through. Like if he doesn't actually see what he's expecting, then it won't be real.
Dean walked back inside and stalked into the bedroom. Castiel saw him flip down on the mattress, then get back up and grab his duffel bag from near the door. The man moved over to the couch and dumped the duffle on it.
Slipping his hand between their bodies, he takes hold of Benny’s impressively sized cock, and gives it a stroke. It feels wonderful in his hand, and he wonders what it might feel like if it was inside him… if Benny fucks him the way he fucked Dean. He hasn’t really thought about doing it that way before, but now… now he can’t get it out of his mind.
“How does it feel?” he asks, as he makes the barest of movements in and then out, before repeating his actions. “You like being fucked? You like having me inside you?”
Between the two of them, they give Dean's morning wood the treatment it needs. A few moments later three bodies are tangled together on the bed, sated and fucked out.
The vampire leans in and kisses him so hard he bruises Castiel's lips, not that he's complaining, because Benny thrusts one last time and comes inside him, hips softly rocking as his seed fills Castiel up.
Dean leaned his forehead against Castiel's and whispered, "Sounds like good advice. What do you say we head home, sunshine?"
And it’s not just the physical form that looks the same. This Benny’s essence is identical, too, and that is disconcerting. But it gives Castiel an idea. If they really are that similar, maybe this is connected to why they were pulled into this world.
He likes the feeling of Benny doing what he wants with him, more than he would ever have thought possible. “So am I. I want you to make me yours.”
Of course it isn’t possible to suffocate a vampire, but it lightens the mood and stops Dean from worrying too much about what might have happened if Cas hadn’t turned up in time.
Benny uses Castiel's thighs to support himself as he starts fucking him even deeper, nailing Castiel's prostate every third or fourth stroke. He loves the ripple of muscle under the vampire's skin, the sweat starting to drip down that solid torso. Loves the way Benny has him positioned just right to see the way his dick is plunging into him with each brutal thrust.
Castiel didn’t often drink beer, but he didn’t want to seem unfriendly, so he took the bottle Dean was offering, and thanked him.
He handed the stall owner a handful of the tickets Dean had given him, and picked up the gun that he would shoot the painted ducks with. Even though Castiel had never shot a gun before - real or otherwise - he was certain he would hit enough ducks to win the panda.
"Yeah, sure thing, man. I've got all the stuff. It's a date." He flushed slightly, and Castiel started wondering if this attraction was more than one-sided. "Um, sounds like a plan, I mean."
"Maybe you should talk to Sam first. Might weird him out to see me looking like this," he says, pointing to his lack of facial hair and slighter frame.
When Benny shakes his head, it looks like it takes a monumental effort. "Nah. I’m not. I… I’ll see you on the other side." There’s a slight pause before he breathes out, "I love you."
Castiel wonders how many hunter’s funerals they’ve had to hold, for an angel to know the procedure so well. It’s a sobering thought, but one he’s not able to dwell on for long, as he finds himself helping to carry the body of their fallen comrade.
He watched as Dean thunked his head back against the headrest and bit his bottom lip. His right hand reached up and turned the key. "Tell me to put my seatbelt on and drive us to the bunker."
He's thoughtfully pacing the stacks when Dean and Cas come in. They both look ragged, and the coffee's a great ruse. If he didn’t know any better, he'd think they hadn't had a good night's rest. Though the angel doesn't need it.
"Yeah, man. I'll be okay, promise. You ever slept in a no name motel room with a magic fingers bed? 'Cause that's the next step up from sleeping on the floor, and I've done more than my fair share of it."
Castiel stared at the piece of paper long enough for the water to go cold, and yes… a few tears spilled down his cheeks too. He hadn’t meant to imply that at all; he’d been trying to gauge Dean’s intentions. But as per usual, his non-existent people skills had ruined everything.
"Oh, I'm gonna fuck that filthy mouth of yours later. But right now, I want to flood you with my come. Fuck you full until you're spilling around my cock." He leans in, nearly bending Castiel in half, and adds, "And I want you to scream so loud the entire bunker will know who's owning this sweet ass of yours."
Castiel felt no sympathy for the man, but he was surprised to hear Dean asking for a cuddly toy too. He hadn’t expected that.
Dean moves to stand next to Sam's nightstand and picks up a picture frame that was laying face down. He peruses it, and his face transitions from slight confusion to something between sadness and resolve.
“I had intended to wait until everyone got here, but then I decided that unless I wanted to ask him in front of everyone, I didn’t need to wait. We’ll just announce as folks come, and it’ll be less crazy.”
“We’ll need to find somewhere with a heated patio since we have Miracle, but I understand Denver is a dog friendly city. We should be fine,” says Cas in his supportive voice. A grumbling sound comes out of the speaker, and both Dean and Cas can visualize Sam’s eye roll.
“You know I’m used to a driver, a bodyguard, and a few minions — at the very least arm candy. You can’t deny a woman a few perks.”
“I think it was meant to hold sheet music, or paper. Mom, helped me find it,” says Charlie. “But that’s not the gift.”
thinking about Mom and his Bobby in the apocalypse world camps.” Sam immediately starts to go toward the other room and the stairs, when Dean holds him back. “J’s got it. Leave ‘em be until dinner, and then just treat them normal.”
“I didn’t think I’d say this, but I don’t want to take any more pictures for a while,” says Jeremy as they walk outside.
Jack still manages to put his hand on Jeremy’s shoulder, turn him around, and look into his eyes and earnestly say, “Let me help.”
In honor of it being Valentine's weekend coming up, and there being a lot of people doing destiel wedding fanworks, there may be some feels this chapter.
Instead Dean says, “Rowena, you cannot make our innocent child look too good. People are going to hit on him.”
Dean holds Jack’s face in his hands and gives him a kiss on the forehead like he’s seen Cas do with Jack. Then he tries to wipe some tears from Jack’s face. “Maybe I need to find some tissues,” he says, and Jack responds with a weak smile. His cracked phone vibrates a notification that perks Jack up a bit. He tells Dean, ‘It’s mom. She wants to know if I’m ok.” Jack quickly types and immediately get a response. He types a little longer message, and then sets the phone down again.
Jeremy has been prepped for this, so he takes a breath, says, “Hello my name is” and then finger spells Jeremy. “It’s nice to meet you” he says while signing with index fingers up apart and then brought together. “That’s all the ASL I know. Figured it would be weird not to take the opportunity, to use it though.”
We need a couple field educators, but the staffing is minimal. I’ll still help Garth, Jody and Eileen with current hunters, but the non-profit will be my priority.
“Don’t be so serious,” Charlie says with a nudge. “But I did go ahead and put on all the files for you anyway.”
“Since you were the one who got killed, maybe I should cut you some slack and we should talk about how you’re feeling?”
Dean looked at the sky and lengthening shadows that were starting to edge into a sunset. He put a hand on his heart and started to pray.
“When I was going to separate from Amara, and everyone had to make their choices, she asked me if I wanted to come back as a baby.”
Rowena is sitting next to Charlie sharing a drink of something stronger than hot chocolate in their mugs. Making sure they’re not overheard, Rowena tells Charlie a campfire story from her road trip with Charlie’s apocalypse world doppelgänger, and Charlie blushes a little.
Jack has a lightbulb moment. “Oh, so this is why Canada, wrapped her ladder rungs in pool noodles,” he says. “I thought she just liked the colors.”
“No, he’s good to me. I like Dean. He taught me how to fish and to drive, and I like spending time with him. Just a lot of stuff happened, and he and Sam didn’t have the best family situation. His father would say… would do… terrible things. Dean practically raised Sam. Mia said that he has to unlearn some stuff.”
“He was very polite. Quiet. I’m not sure if that’s because we’re parents, or because he’s feeling down. He’s warming up to us though.”
Jeremy gives a wry half smile. “He said that it bothered her for while, but then she found out how popular he is.”
Jeremy’s not sure what to make of that, so they sit in silence a while, until Jeremy’s ready to speak again, “You know, I didn’t think something like this would happen. Jack’s always so cheerful and calm — ok sometimes he does get high key excited — and then sometimes he’s stubborn as fuck over something, but then he’s usually stubborn and calm…maybe just occasionally bossy.”
“Surprisingly so,” says Sam with a smile on his face. “They’re going to a place with a brick oven, and they’re getting me a garden pizza. And we know everyone else’s faves by now.”
“They’re ok,” he deadpans, as he looks over to where Cas is trying to get the lipstick off Jack with a
Charlie says, “Ok, whoever wants to wait can wait, but I think at least these should be opened.” Charlie points to the pile of gifts that are flat and obviously go an a wall. Those are for Kelly and the dads, and get passed out as well as the aunt and uncle gifts. Everyone gets a printed photobook with pictures from the holidays and selfie museum. They all have a different set of pictures, and once everyone realizes that, there’s a lot of passing around. Fortunately the books have names, so they don’t get mixed up. Gertie is surprised that she gets a thumb drive to use to transfer pictures of Charlie taken at the selfie museum to her tablet. There’s even a picture of Jeremy in the scarf that she gave him — heavy on the scarf since Jeremy has it covering most of his face. Gertie laughs.
“You’re on,” says Jack with a smile. Jack unconsciously mimics Dean, sitting on the arm of the newer, less comfy sectional next to Jody and Donna’s love seat. Sam grabs one of the club chairs.
“My mom sounds like Dan Levy’s character,” says Jeremy. “She’s always saying ‘screw the patriarchy’ — but she mainly does it while driving a V90 station wagon, so…”
“I suppose I should tell you that my dad doesn’t do well with crowds. He has a phobia or anxiety. That’s why I didn’t want to have them come. By the weekend, all your family will be here. That’s a lot of people.”
Canada checks in. Non-civilian stuff happens. Sam finally gets to the mountain. The AV club presents on Heaven, Hell and the Family Organization
“Oh now, that’s not fair. We all know that your wonderful meals can make a stack of dishes,” says Donna. “And Jodes and I want to make a couple of casseroles for Christmas Eve dinner.”
Rowena gasps. “I confess that I’d had a bit of a heads up on Eileen’s intentions, but I never expected to be shocked and honored like this.” Her eyes water and she grabs a napkin. “Here’s the test of my new mascara.” Sam and Eileen come around the table and give her a hug. “Yes, yes of course, I’ll preside.” She pulls them in for another hug and whispers to Sam, “what heaven and hell bind together no being will ever be able to pull asunder.”
Jeremy goes to the bed that doesn’t have Alex lying down, resting her head on a Tsum-Tsum, and sits still like Patience is taking a picture.
No matter what age he might look like, Jack is still the baby of the family, and his enthusiasm draws attention. Kelly and Rowena joined forces on his gifts, and it’s well-known that Rowena loves to get Jack clothes, so there’s going to be a pile of them, and curiosity about what he got.
“Shit, I didn’t mean to bring up anything bad. I didn’t think you’d ever had problems with Dean. You’re always so happy when you talk about him.”
“Which is why they put up with it, and may even be secretly pleased about it.” Cas moves a little further down Dean’s shoulders. “Sam confessed there was another reason he and Kelly didn’t want mistletoe.”
“Gadreel whooshed us and I didn’t have time to get my phone out,” says Rowena. Cas raises an eyebrow at that. She gets a package out of a shopping bag Gadreel is carrying, and then Gadreel heads for the tree to put some other things down. Cas follows him and whispers some questions to Gadreel who looks stoic as he answers. Dean goes to the kitchen to start getting things out for the s’mores. Jack and Jeremy arrive, and Jack rushes up when he sees Rowena.
As the brothers hug, Cas turns to Jeremy with a smile and a nod, and they walk over to say hello, too.
Cas has to take a call from Jeremy’s mom. Setting himself to dad duties, Dean grabs a laptop to research Jeremy’s electric car, investigating charging station locations and miles per charge, and thinking about whether or not to propose parking it. Miracle lays on top of his feet. Eventually Cas comes by with a sigh. “So what’s the plan?” Dean asks looking up from his search.
“She sounds pretty badass roughing it with her grandson. I think it’s pretty cool that you got to spend time with her like that. I don’t know my grandmother that well.”
He wonders if disliking bunk beds and camp is a left-over from resenting mom and dad for sending him in the first place, since they apparently thought he needed socialization like a puppy. Typical only-child parents, he thinks, but the whole learning to swim thing turned out ok. Thinking about his parents reminds him that he and Jack need to get online and check grades, since he’s promised to at least FaceTime Mom once he gets them. He sighs and then…
Dean says, “Hey everybody, Donna baked the casseroles. Have I said how much I love the double ovens?”
“Pool noodles?” asks everyone, except Eileen who’s already seen them and Jack who asks, “You and Rowena got gifts together?”
The more logical part of Jeremy’s brain explains to him that Claire and Jack were just playing. When Jack tapped her head it was him telling her he could have pulled her hair to break out of the hold, but didn’t. The less logical side seems to be highly suspicious of Claire. Jeremy’s eyes are still following her as she goes to Cas who embraces her and gives her a loving kiss on the head like she’s a precious toddler princess and not someone who gives dangerous wrestling holds as tokens of affection.
Kelly signs a quick conversation to Eileen that leaves Eileen with a sly smile, and which even Sam only seems to get part of. Ignoring the question marks in Sam’s expression, Kelly finally says, “Dean,” and motions for a hug, which he gives.
Sam blushes, and walks forward saying, “I’m coming. Find your sweater and we’ll get you ready in our bathroom.”
“Hello Samuel,” Rowena says in a lilting voice. “Now don’t you worry. I know you have guests, but I was thinking of coming in tonight. I promise to be on best behavior, but you be honest and tell me if I shouldn’t come.”
“Well, I’ll take getting old over the alternative any day. Get over here Charles!” says Dean with a big smile.
Claire’s face goes on a journey to somewhere filled with sarcastic comments, but Kaia calls her back with a touch of her arm and a soft, “Eyes on the tv.” Claire dutifully restrains herself.
made breakfast?” says Dean. He heads to the fridge and immediately starts pulling out eggs, as Cas gets two mugs for coffee.
Jeremy exhales, and thinks about it. “I like what I know of them, but they don’t share everything about themselves, and I don’t like
I head canon that like Cas, having been an angel/nephilim Jack doesn't really think about gender, so he'd see himself as NB, regardless of how others see him.
“So that’s why Gadreel.” Sam looks about and then whispers, “Why did Team God let an angel come down?”
Cas joins in, “Let’s approach it another way. Charlie, how much time do you need to get to your appointment and get ready? If you subtract that from the available time, how long can you spend with us?”
Dean looks at Cas again. He still looks confused but there’s affection for Jack in his eyes. Confused affection is another one of Cas’ adorable looks. Well, no reason not to make them all happy, he thinks.
“The supercharger station there?” At this point, Jeremy and Dean have a map of all the charging stations on I-70 in their heads.
Kelly moves over to sit next to Jeremy, since they’re the only ones left in the room. “Don’t worry about the peer pressure on changing,” says Kelly. “The KU royal blue is nice,” indicating Jeremy’s slightly baggy long-sleeved t-shirt, “be warned that once you meet Rowena, you’ll probably wind up getting a sweater or two for Christmas.”
Claire says, “You know, Cas gave me a grumpy cat from — she makes quotation marks with her fingers — ‘Hot Topical’ years ago…”
Mary stirs her coffee a little longer than necessary and answers. “John’s with Bobby, Rufus, and Bill Harvelle on a fishing trip.”
. It’s the middle of the week, so it will be a small ceremony for close family. Then we’ll have a big party on the weekend,” says Sam.
Sam raises an eyebrow at Jack getting a Macleod tartan, but it’s clear Rowena takes being Jack’s aunt very seriously, and Jack may as well be a Macleod heir.
“Wow,” Kelly says. “It’s like they can tune everyone out. Oh, is it ok if I finish off this whipped cream? I promise to get you some more tomorrow.”
He raises his hands defensively. “I didn’t expect anything in return. I just wanted to do something, because I’ve had a great time with you all. To be honest, Cas gave me the money my parents had sent to him and Dean for my expenses, so I figured it should go to gifts. Charlie helped me find somewhere that would get everything printed in time, and picked things up.”
“You have time to change that. There’s never as much as you think there is, but you have some time to talk to your family. Everyone here is very special, and it does make them easy to talk to, but I assume you must be, too.” She sighs and stretches. “I think I’m getting tired. Would you run down and let Charlie know that I’m ready to go home?”
There’s a moment of silence and then Alex says, “Screw avoiding potential injuries, you’re just lucky Jody and Donna were out, since Jody told you about six times not to spar — and you know this counts.”
Dean and Mary head back to the sofa. This time Miracle must sense something because he’s in Dean’s lap and being particularly distracting. Dean plants a kiss on his dog’s head, and says, “Hey, settle down.”
Charlie and Gertie both give their congratulations. While Charlie starts a round of hugs, Miracle goes back to sit by Gertie on the couch, and Dean passes the leash to Cas who sits down next to them. Charlie glances down the couch, and seeing her mom looking comfortable petting Miracle, and with Cas admiring her knitting, she settles in for some animated brainstorming with Eileen, Sam, Dean and Kelly about a joint bride-groom shower, and possible stag parties.
“Maybe if you can figure what he wants we could get somebody to make a 3D printer pattern. I know a junior in design.”
Charlie wipes a tear with her free hand, but they all sit in comfortable silence for some time lost in thought, but finally Kelly says, “Anyone want to go with me to get some kettle corn before we head to the house?”
Far too quickly late-afternoon arrives, and they have to get ready for a visit from Jeremy and his parents. Sam gathers everyone in the living room.
“But most of the day I’d be prepared. I’ve lowered the odds that I’ll need to do that,” says Jack, as if it’s a simple fact.
“I suppose the hard part is knowing when to be one or the other. For me, it hasn’t come up, though.”
“Souls coming from the veil immediately come to hell and are placed in their memories, unless there are special circumstances that have them going straight up to heaven. Heaven kept souls repeating their happiest memories, but that essentially trapped them and kept them isolated. Instead, people will relive memories and be assessed as to whether they have enough empathy to move on to live with others in heaven. If people are cruel, they aren’t tortured, but they do have to relive their memories from the point of view of the people they wronged.” Rowena shrugs. “Until we can figure something else to do, people either trap and torture themselves or eventually move on to heaven, as they come to understand their actions.”
Still whispering Rowena says, “No, t’isn’t. Not any more. And they’re asking for a consultation, not for you to run things. It’s quite all right to say no to heaven. That shouldn’t be a problem for The Sam Winchester who shot god, or am I wrong?” Her look is challenging, but eyes show sympathy.
“It’s always a bit of of struggle deciding how much it’s safe to interact with strangers, but I knew she’d be sad if I didn’t let her meet you.”
“Good point. Get in. I’ll take you back to the Roadhouse. You can see Bobby and I’ll figure out how I call Cas. You can find Eileen. I thought that ride would calm my nerves, but I’m shaky.”
“We were talking about camping, and I started thinking about the camps with Bobby and… Mary,” Jack’s voice crumples on Mary, and tears start rolling down.
Sam looks a bit sick. Eileen smiles an amused, unworried smile, because she’s a complete badass. Rowena gives a sly smile and a devious look. Dean nudges Cas, and says, “History,” while Cas tries to look anywhere but Rowena.
“No, but it helps to focus and it’s a symbol of both initiation and completion, summoning and sending. It’s good form.” Kelly smiles. “I guess some of them also like to use it to be dramatic, like signing your name with a flourish. Both Michael and Gabe snap. Does it seem over the top?”
Jeremy half falls, half rolls out of his tube, and then gets hit with giggles. Kelly is upright and undoing their connectors before Jack is out. Jack attempts to step out, but sinks pretty far into the snow with a laugh. They manage to extricate themselves and drag their tubes behind them. Kelly looks over her shoulder at them with a big smile.
Canada says, “You should make King come to our weekly dinner out,” she pauses and then in her more demanding persona says, “Otherwise he’ll commit you to a study group that messes up our schedule, and have you eating out of a library vending machine. I cannot have that.”
She glances at Cas. “I’d have to talk to all your Dads. I’m happy to be at the Bunker, if I can be of use, but I don’t get lonely that way anymore. Lawrence might be better.”
“But you didn’t ask me to wipe his feet off when he came in the room. After all, Miracle doesn’t have shoes.”
And apart from the content notes, I just want to say thanks to the people who have kudoed. Also, BIG thanks to Velvet for the comment, which helped me to plow through this chapter.
They have less than an hour to The Mandalorian episode. Everyone migrates to the rec room floor. Jeremy has brought his laptop, and is editing images off his camera’s SD card. Patience suggests that he shouldn’t work on his laptop so late during a party, but Jeremy protests that it’s his hobby and for fun.
“Handled the past year earthside like a champ. Lots of Netflix binging.” Dean nods looking sad. “Hey Dean, we both know your mom’s situation was different.”
“Kelly is supposed to be Jack’s mum right now, and no one wants to drag her back. She became an angel because Cas became human. They learned their lesson from Cas and Jack, and no one will deprive him.”
“That’s unusual,” says Cas and he stands and does the thing where he’s automatically dressed in jeans and a t-shirt, with his wings unseen.
They have a group hug and leave it at that. Patience will decide if she wants to bring up her father again.
“You’re right,” Sam sighs. He suggests that they leave the luggage there until after the tour, so they’ll know where to take the suitcases. There’s hallway on the left with doors on either side. Sam says, “The house has a strange long space that I think was the original garage, but it’s impressive what the owners did.” With that mysterious preface, Sam leads them and opens the door. The room has a skylight above and large windows at the far end. The floor is grey, possibly slate. There’s a treadmill, elliptical, and exercise bike facing the windows. Closer to them is what Dean describes as, “the smallest, most narrow pool ever.”
Dean throws the ball in the small dog park and watches Miracle twist around trying to get it. “Almost buddy!” Miracle answers with a bark, and picks it up to bring over. Dean turns back toward the travel plaza and sees Jack and Cas with all the Starbucks orders. Jack veers off toward the limited outdoor seating to save a spot. Dean strains to see the charging stations farther off where Jeremy backed his car in. Of course charging stations get relegated to the back of the plaza. As Jeremy sees Cas and Jack, he gets out of his car. Dean turns his attention back to Cas walking toward him with one of his canvas bags on his shoulder. It’s the one with a bee and honeycomb pattern they got at a farmer’s market. There’s something in Cas’ deliberate pace that has Dean back at the barn in his head. They have a cold, bright day, but Dean thinks about all the sparks that night, and feels that familiar and still thrilling swoop in his stomach and tingle in his arms seeing his husband, dorky and hot at the same time. He pockets the ball and steps out to the other side of the fence. Cas walks up until he’s about two inches from him.
“You know, I don’t think we need a video to figure out how cut open pool noodles and tape them to the rungs,” says Jeremy.
Sam puts a hand to his head, massaging a sudden headache. ”This is beyond my pay grade, Rowena,” he says a little louder.
“Enjoy the respite. I think it may last a couple of years. Your visions should be friends and family. You’ll eventually have visions of monsters again, but I believe it’s likely the monsters will be the ones in trouble. I mean that as more of them try to live peaceful lives, there will be a backlash, and possible problems from ex-hunters or victims. We’ll need to make sure that Garth maintains strong communication with Eileen and Jody about lycanthrope and other creature communities.”
Everyone breathes a sigh of relief, and Dean breaks out an enormous container of puffed cheese balls as a treat, and hands them to Sam to pass around. Eileen gets a few more sodas to set on the table.
“Yeah, no choice — didn’t even realize she was in heaven. Amara just yanked her out to be a thank you fruit basket, so no wonder she decided to stay in heaven the second time around when she could choose.”
“I’m trying not to envision anything, but yes, I do worry about people getting hurt if Jack’s not ready. Regardless, we have to trust him.”
There’s a lot of emotion in the intensity of Cas’ hug, but when he lets go of Jeremy, he just says, “Thanks.”
Jeremy politely holds the door for them as they enter and head for the window booth. Dean slides in next to the window on one side, with Cas following. Miracle licks the glass once as Dean taps on it. Cas rests his chin on Dean’s shoulder as he coos at Miracle. Jack quickly grabs his phone and takes a picture of Cas and Dean with Miracle on the other side of the glass.
It’s hard for the music to really register between smiles, bites of pie, and staring into the eyes of the only angel who he’s ever seen blush, but Dean can’t help but hear a couple of lines.
“The Road House group — Ash and Pamela, the Harvelles, and some others have become a council of sorts, running heaven for human souls, so fewer angels are necessary to assist humans,” says Kelly.
“Brah, I already know you’re all about the women in music. No surprise there. Besides, we listened to my stuff on the way to Lebanon.”
“He couldn’t have faith, because he was afraid,” says Donna. Patience gives Donna the darkest look any of the sisters have ever given Donna, but she holds up to it. “I’m not trying to defend him, Patience.”
“I wouldn’t fight Eileen for it, though,” warns Jack, but with a smile to show he’s not too serious.
“Cas, they’re still groggy. I have the reservation info you sent. Why don’t you steer everyone to the lobby in a minute. I’ll go ahead and get us checked in.”
“Heavens!” says a striking older woman walking out of the kitchen. She reminds Dean of Ellen, but with dark brown hair shot through with white. She notes Dean and Sam with a nod and yells over, “I hope that you boys like Willie. The rule is my shift, my music.”
Donna blushes and Jody sets a hand on and her knee. Jeremy smiles and raises an eyebrow and a questioning look at Patience and Alex, not realizing their adopted moms were a new thing. Patience smiles back, and says softly under the other conversation, “I saw it coming, but it was still kinda weird at first.” Alex rolls her eyes and whispers, “Yeah, they were friends a while. It’s newish. It’s good, though.”
Dean and Charlie look like they’re about to cry again. Jack gives Patience a questioning look, but she rolls her eyes and crosses her arms.
“Yes, I’m not human anymore. If I get bored, I can concentrate on the voices of my fellow angels in my mind. Or I can just text Rowena about Christmas gifts. Maybe you two should try out the soundproofing, too.”
Sam says, “With the girls coming today, I know tomorrow morning you’re going to make a heart attack on a plate. You, Eileen, Donna, and Claire could each eat a slab of bacon. Consider this a cleanser.”
“They’re making sacrifices to ‘utilize space,’” Jeremy says with finger quotes leaving the group surprised, and looking at Cas as if he infected him in some way, to which Cas just shrugs, “and
Arlette comes by with paper place mats. Sam waves off a straw as as she also sets paper napkin-wrapped cutlery down.
Thank god, Jeremy thinks to himself, but aloud says, “So want to try the other room? For comparison?” He’s thinking that if Jack doesn’t like the other room better, he and Jack’s dads are going to be looking for pool noodle substitutes to duct tape on the rungs tonight.
Jeremy gets his tripod set up and tells Jack, “I’ve wanted to try low-light night shots, but I’ve never had anything really interesting to take pictures of besides the moon. Either these will be little blobs, or they’ll look amazing.”
“Yep, he wanted to learn all the traditional dishes he could, so it was a scheme of theirs. Dal is his specialty,” says Jack.
Jeremy smirks a bit at Jack and everyone else in the universe calling Grogu baby Yoda, but adds, “We didn’t stay up late. It was a long day and I’m still on Central time.”
“The cookies we had in Denver really were cool, both the baking and the decorating. I was serious when I said that Cas should do a vlog or something,” says Jeremy backing up Jack’s enthusiasm.
This was his house. Where he grew up in. Dean suddenly feels like he is intruding but doesn’t want to leave in case Castiel does something to hurt himself.
"What? You're comfortable." Castiel feels a flush spreading up his neck. If only he could actually see. He wouldn't know what to do with himself.
He’s about to kick his horse on when a hand grabs onto his own trembling one. He looks down into her deep, brown eyes.
Castiel’s lips quirk into a small smile. “My mother did too. Except not only did she tell me about just our gods but all of them – or at least all she knew.” Dean remembers Castiel telling him about how his mother and father were travellers and how they learnt of many different cultures and religions. He wonders if that really is true.
Until suddenly Castiel lifts his hand to point at the stars and speaks. It’s of a religion a few hundred years old, belonging to the people from an island off the Western coast of Akwanyo – long gone now. He speaks at length then pauses for a while and continues, voice even and words unrushed.
Emery and Catharlo at least make up for him, inhaling their own meals like they haven’t eaten in days. Have they? Castiel doesn’t even remember. Everything has been such a blur.
Castiel holds his eyes and it takes him a moment to understand through the fog over his mind but then--
He’d felt sick. The fear in Castiel’s eyes. The shame as Dean stood there staring. His voice cracking. All of it.
Castiel rolls over onto his feet. “I may have let my guard down for a moment. We’ll have to work on your pinning as well. I could have easily gotten the upper hand.”
And strangely, his heart sinks. Michael’s not there. He doesn’t know why for a moment there he wished he was. Perhaps the display of love from family before him gave him hope he’d receive some similar treatment.
Castiel continues to stare at him, eyes flicking down and back up once before he says, “You can call me Cas if you want.”
Castiel looks at him for a long time, full of nothing but overwhelming love and emotion. Dean’s heart aches for everything that he is.
Because Benny’s text message from that night was a simple ‘you guys really need to get that snog on’. And it’s safe to say now they’re all pretty happy with their achieved outcome – Dean’s friends teasing him the most about getting his little ‘crush’, despite the fact that they all know Dean and Castiel would have got their ‘snog on’ on the next date whether his runners conspired to set it up or not.
"Dude, he's been looking at you all night. How can anyone resist those big, blue eyes?" Dean says teasingly, and Castiel laughs awkwardly to cover up the way his whole body warms.
