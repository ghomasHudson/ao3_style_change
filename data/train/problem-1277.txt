MRS. HUDSON
John, however, doesn't dare to linger. Once he pulls the key card out of Sherlock's pocket, he unlocks the door and without taking a pause to break the kiss, he pushes Sherlock over the threshold.
Sherlock's reflection in the mirror - smiling.
It was more than difficult to leave Baker Street in the spirits like this. Sherlock would give everything for that he and John could do this together, solve cases, simply strolling along down the London streets side by side, just as they used to before. But in this particular case he was unfortunately personally involved and that was an obstacle always too exacting to overcome. Sherlock knew better than anyone else.
Focus, John. Wedding bands?
Dr. Watson here is going to take good care of you, no doubt.
From inside the flat, through the door - John and Sherlock, walking up the stairs.
Yes. I plan to take him somewhere nice, somewhere special. I hope he'll say yes.
,“ John chuckled. “And besides, he’s armed.“
“You can’t be serious,“ John gasped, crossing his arms. Sherlock could hear him approaching but he remained standing still, paralysed in one spot, almost as if he was too afraid to turn around and look John in the eyes. But then John uttered his name, once, twice, a mere whisper, his warm, sooth voice piercing through the ice cold façade Sherlock wore in order to give away none of his true emotions. Sherlock had hoped that this time they’d manage to avoid leading such intimate, tedious conversations but judging from how John hesitated to speak, shuffling his feet and clearing his throat so awkwardly, it was quite obvious where all of it was going.
, John, is the most cunning enemy,“ Sherlock added, ignoring John's stunned face. “It’s able to control you, to exploit you, making you do and say things you’d never commit otherwise. Never
notice and found it weird that Sherlock didn’t take a seat in front of John. Instead, he stood idly next to the arm of John’s chair, sipping from his mug and silently glaring down at the other man as if he still couldn’t believe that he’s real.
It's a matter of life and death, Mrs. Holmes.
You're going to need to get that washed.
Absolutely. Better not neglect anything... That being said, I hope you don't mind me staying the night as well. Shall you protest, I might as well chain myself to John's bed.
MRS. HUDSON
Sherlock took a deep shaky breath. “Then why are you here? Aren't you... aren't you supposed to be enjoying your
John didn’t even offer a reply, he simply forced a smile. Once he glanced up at Sherlock however, that artificial expression was gone. John nearly choked on the air he was about to inhale. Sherlock was too close, so close they both could see the ever present love and fear in each other’s eyes, so close that if they were ready to breach those walls between them their lips would be already brushing. It lasted for only a mere second however. Having quite trouble breathing, Sherlock had to take a swift step back in order to not do anything inappropriate right there and then, leaving John stand frustrated in the middle of the room.
“I am fairly convinced I had a tea yesterday evening,“ Sherlock retorted. “Do I need to remind you for how long is an average human body able to last without any need of water or food?“
“Slower?“ John tilted his head, releasing Sherlock’s fingers with a sloppy pop, proceeding to leave small chaste kisses over each of his knuckles instead.
“Please, Sherlock-“John pleaded, once again stepping forward to close what felt like a giant hollow abyss between them.
else. It hurts to know that you refuse to believe you could be anyone's top priority but know that you are mine. Always. I know it's why you're acting like this now, but, Sherlock, I have made my choice and there is no force on this Earth or elsewhere that will change my opinion. Not even that baby. So please just stop with this madness. Please, just try, Sherlock, you have to try to stop tricking yourself into thinking something that is not true at all just because you believe you deserve no good.“
” Sherlock approaches him and gently grabs his arms. “Contrary to popular belief, I don't
“Have you always felt like that? About us?”
“You worked for Moriarty,“ he said bluntly, the first thing that crossed his mind, expecting either an instant shot or at least a glimmer of reaction on Mary’s face but it appeared to be made of stone.
(chuckles)
John’s eyes flew wide open, quite an efficient way how to snap him out of the drowsiness. “N-nine? Come on, don’t exaggerate.“
Yup, and it's working.
No reply. Sherlock throws but a glance at John, then reaches for the handle, opens the front door...
We're not letting her sleep in the bedroom, though.
CUT TO:
John doesn't seem to be fully aware of what he's just said. Nor done. He wordlessly leads Sherlock through the mass of dancing bodies, but just before reaching the door Sherlock suddenly breaks the silence between them and brings them both to an abrupt halt.
-a huge beaming grin on his face. He completely loses it.
“ he purrs, the word itself melting on his tongue.
The tension in the room was growing to be unbearable.
John's smile drops as his mouth ever so slowly falls open.
“John?“
SHERLOCK
Alright. But just this once.
, please,“ John pleaded. “Why are you like this? You can’t just pretend that you don’t care, that’s insane. I know you don’t even want this, so… why don’t you just tell me the truth, Sherlock? You know you can trust me. Sherlock-“
“How?“ Sherlock frowned. “What are the benefits of being imprisoned in your own flat?“
Once he breezed in, his eyes welled up immediately; he couldn’t prevent himself from whispering John’s name upon seeing him in such condition like this. Even if the man himself couldn’t hear him. Carefully, as quietly as if he was just a mouse, he closed the door behind himself and walked toward the bed, never darting his eyes away from John’s face.
“Come on, then. Before the bar gets crammed with people...”
“What I meant,“ he said, stepping forward so the distance between them had been shortened again, “is that if you’re so
MRS. MERRILOW
“Come here.“
“Well, you’ve saved my life, John. Again. You’ve made me understand what I was actually supposed to do,“ Sherlock said, leaning back in his seat so to put more distance between them.
Sherlock... For me. Please, wake up, for me.
John's lips spread into the soppiest smile.
rather proud of it,“ Sherlock mumbled, fiddling with the hem of his gown. “Listening to such music… One can hardly resist to...“
“Don’t you dare to tell me we’ve gone too far too fast.“
hard so he doesn't break into laughter.
The second Sherlock allowed himself to remember the face of that atrocious woman, his fists clenched in untamed anger. All those intrusive thoughts he tried to sweep away in order to not descend into derangement were suddenly coming back in vivid images painted all over his mind. First there were just words, ‘
“It’s forbidden to smoke inside the building,“ Sherlock grumbled.
Oh. Does that mean we get to hold hands, cuddle and kiss... All the time?
Mycroft? I have a favour to ask.
John snorts, mildly disgruntled. He walks up to the counter again, picks up the food he'd prepared, places the plates on the table. Then sits down, opposite Sherlock.
I've tried, John. I've tried not think of what had happened, but these memories... Every once in a while they come back to haunt me. To torture me. The more I try to suppress them, the more violent they become. It's preventing me from doing my work. I can seldom concentrate... Take the last case, for instance... All it takes is a one inconvenient word, it's like pulling a trigger and it starts a storm in my head. I've become an absolutely useless, worthless shell of a man. What even is my purpose, when I can't properly use my brain anymore?
“She just wants to… talk I presume.“
But even though they
After a few seconds of mindless groping in the dark, he finally located the last pack of cigarettes that he had hidden in the cupboard, behind the cookie jar and hastily lit one. He knew he shouldn't but he had to admit to himself that he didn't care anymore.
Sherlock seemed to froze upon hearing those words, his eyes glassy, full of tears and lips wobbling in shock. The mere sight sent shivers down John’s spine. He was convinced that he had just made the biggest mistake of his life, his left fist clenching and unclenching frantically as the result.
What?
INTERCUT - Sherlock, scowling, terrified.
John freezes, his phone almost slips from his hand.
What?
“I am sorry, Sherlock,“ she said at last, “but the discussion’s over for once. Your plan has failed and you’re going to pay for it.“
SHERLOCK
, precisely. Last time at 4:37, that’s when you
Just the idea of John living at Baker Street again left Sherlock speechless. John belonged there, without him it was just a plain, boring place Sherlock loathed because everything was a constant reminder of the man he loved.  But he rather showcased no happiness but paradoxically something weirdly close to impassivity. Almost as if he couldn’t believe that John was moving back for real. He wouldn’t believe it until all of John’s belongings were moved back to Baker Street.
“You know-“ John took a pause, so to steel himself. Whether it was an utterly bad idea that could partially ruin their relationship or not, he decided to not back pedal. “You remember how you said you want
SHERLOCK
“Oh, he seemed to be in a hurry,“ she said coyly, “all he wanted from me was to deliver you a message.“
Er... Because they want money?
“See? It's fine. We’re fine.”
JOHN (CONT'D)
“It’s – it’s nothing, forget about it,“ he waved his hand.
Sitting there with Sherlock all by himself, John realised how much he wished he’d never have to leave the flat again. He wished he could stay, taking care of Sherlock forever, loving him the way Sherlock had always deserved and eventually, maybe even confess what he’d felt ever since the minute he’d walked into that lab all those five years ago. Even though the fear of being rejected had been present, always, preventing John from being fully prepared, he could no longer pretend he wasn’t so unconditionally, so profoundly in love with Sherlock. He was too tired of waiting for a miracle that would solve all his problems, too tired of pretending he was happy with someone who had betrayed him and lied to him about everything, he’d never been.
The text (and each next one) appears on the screen: I can't sleep.
“You mind?“
?” John blinks. He's
(glances at her watch)
Them - Sherlock and his brother. Sherlock’s mind clicked upon realising that Mycroft should have known about what just happened. He dialled up his number in an instant, hoping that Mycroft won’t be trying to stop him, but as soon as he answered - his voice all huffy and peevish , Sherlock figured out that what he was about to do will anything but please the man.
He begins to rise, but...
“I am just saying… it’s late enough, John,“ Sherlock pointed out. “Mary’s waiting for you. You shouldn’t be leaving her alone like this.“
John’s brow quirked. “Save your life?“
“Y-you?
A familiar voice. Strained. Sorrowful.
John was so absorbed in his fantasy he didn’t even notice that Sherlock had approached him. He throws a glance at him then beckons toward the monumental window.
Groaning, John falls back against the cushions. Vexed, he reaches for the remote, turns off the TV.
It's late, Dr. Watson. You better wait until tomorrow.
CUT TO:
A beautifully ethereal face bathing in the mellow pink light, sun’s rays drowning in the vast azure ocean of his eyes. And as the breeze ever so gently blows through his dark hair, it’s like watching the most breathtaking painting come to life.
Sherlock purses his lips, finally steps forward, closing the door behind him.
SHERLOCK (CONT'D)
Mangled? Who would have done such a thing?
John freezes. That wasn’t a mere observation. More like a compliment, a small, timid, half-whisper. A compliment John can only hardly formulate a proper response to.
On Sherlock's face again, frowning. Was it just a dream? He closes his eyes again, tries to calm himself, but then-
“Jesus, you scared the hell out of me,“ John breathed out, “I thought-“ he was cut short once Sherlock tossed his arms over his shoulders, pulling him into even a tighter hug. John decided to ask no questions once Sherlock nuzzled against him, burying his face against the crook of his neck. He embraced him, letting him cry on his shoulder. John ran his hand up and down Sherlock’s sweaty back, soothing him, calming him down, making sure his breathing was soon about to return to normal.
“So, our lives
Sherlock thinks for a moment, points toward the kitchen.
I mean, we weren't cuddling! God, we accidentally ended up tangled in a position of... um, very intimate nature, which happens sometimes, by an accident... so, what I am saying, I guess is that I shouldn't have overreacted the way I did. Yes.
Once the majority of people disperse, he pulls a phone out of his pocket, dials a number, puts it next to his ear.
SHERLOCK
He hesitated for a couple of more agonizingly long seconds, but then he turned around and stepped forth for the exit, snatching the cigarette out of Mycroft’s hand before finally leaving the room.
Now properly awake, John bolts upright and springs out of the bed, hoping Sherlock didn’t just disappear and he’ll find him somewhere else in the suite. To his disappointment, however, the other room seems to be as vacant as the bedroom.
CUT TO:
On an empty doorway. A moment later - Mycroft Holmes appears, aloof as always.
, not mountaineering.“
“Sherlock, are you-are you
“Fine then, let’s say, that I asked you on purpose. Would you-“
Sherlock tilts his head, staring at John. He opens his mouth a few times, but finds himself unable to respond.
John can’t blame him though. ’A kiss or two for a case... no problem’ those were his words, he remembers. Backpedaling now would make it seem like he was fibbing and in fact doesn’t want to have anything to do with Sherlock’s lips. Not even for a case. Which is nowhere near true, obviously.
SHERLOCK
On Sherlock's face. He looks over his shoulder, at John.
Look. If you don't want to tell me, then don't. The last thing I want is to make you feel pressured. I just want you to remember... You can trust me. No matter what.
To be entirely honest, John. I expected you to forgive her.

“Pull through as before. Thanks to me and my undying support.“
You don't even see me.
-Mrs. Hudson - bursting into giggles at the sight.
Nope. Saving that until the wedding. It's a tradition, remember?
No, that’s not what happened. Sherlock shook his head as if he could get rid of those thoughts that way. His world - John was still there, alive, still fighting, only a loser would give up while there was still, even the smallest fragment of hope. And Sherlock wasn’t a loser, he refused to reclaim this nomenclature, especially after all the torment and excruciation he’s already survived, after all those years he refused to give up even when there was no more light at the end of the tunnel.
Turtle.
Lestrade - a man on the brink of hopelessness.
But I must. Bottling it up inside... it's driving me mad. I might as well burst. I need you to listen to me, John. Please.

Sherlock flashes a smirk. “
have to be changed, neither the flat, nor you, Sherlock.“ John wished he could grab and hold both of Sherlock’s hands, tackle him into a hug or even smooch his pink flushed cheek. But after Sherlock sort of rejected him twice already John figured out that he should be careful and take things very slowly.
good, John cannot last as long as he wishes he could. It takes merely a few strokes of Sherlock's hand and but a couple of twists of that deft tongue and John comes hard and with a raspy moan on his lips.
“Wait, she’s went off to somewhere?“ Sherlock’s brow rose. He immediately reached for his phone in fear that he missed the text while his attention was entirely focused on John, but there were no new messages.
But Sherlock's there, present to wipe his tears away. Warm, soothing touch like a medicine for John's wounded soul.
SHERLOCK
“Well, considering I got us nearly killed again… yes. I should have predicted that they would make such drastic attempts to lose us. If it wasn’t for you, I’d be now-“
dangerous. John, I needed to destroy Moriarty’s network, his impact had reached a colossal dimension.

“No, I

John's brow furrows as he takes a moment to contemplate Sherlock's plan. “So... we get to spend a whole week in Spain
You were... worried about me.
“As if you were the one to obey the rules, brother,“ Mycroft smirked. “Look, I am not persuading you to take it. Right now I am suggesting you to go home so you can pull yourself together. It’s been a rough night.“
“R-really?“

“You are such a... naughty tease, John Watson,“ Sherlock sighs, feeling John’s grin against his neck and then a hint of tongue and maybe even teeth very gently grazing on the sensitive skin and Sherlock’s mind once again goes blank.
“I-I thought we could get some food before heading home,“ he says, licking his lips. “Or better yet, eat somewhere out, I am already starving. You
-slowly, the door opens, only ever so slightly. Through the gap we see a silhouette of a woman, wearing a thin black veil. Ms. Ronder.
“It’s not a memory I enjoy coming back to, John.“
Sherlock bit his lip, gazing down shyly. “That piece… it’s so perfect because, well, when I was composing it, I was thinking of…
“What a waste of time.”
“My pleasure,“ Sherlock whispered, biding John goodnight.
John purses his lips, throwing a glance at the cabbie as if to check if he can hear them. With a sigh, he leans closer to Sherlock, his voice barely audible. “
On Sherlock's face again, pale, mouth open in a silent gasp of pain and shock. Close on, as he shuts his eyes-
SHERLOCK
“Sherlock, listen, I-“
In perfect unison, John and Sherlock's heads snap to look at the client, who has just raised up and entered the room. A bit abashed, after having witnessed them squabbling.
Sherlock shrugs phlegmatically. “I fooled around a little in high school, out of curiosity. But it didn't count. Yesterday did.”

“What do I say? I say we stop wasting time
John sniggers at that, but then notices that Sherlock hasn’t even glanced at the menu yet and his face scrunches into a frown. “You’re eating too.”
“Are you – are you sure that all
Is that-?
John Watson, are you trying to conceal something from me?
doing fine. But it takes a lot of time to heal completely,“ Sherlock remarks, stroking John’s hand to appease him. “It’s a long, difficult process, full of obstacles, John. But look at yourself, look at what you’ve achieved already. You’re getting there, step by step. I am so proud of you for doing so well, John.“
“A-a week? Isn’t that perhaps too rushed?“
“What-what are you doing?“

John - in the background - paying for the cab. Then, he walks up to Sherlock, carrying a duffel bag.
Are you okay?
Sherlock had to gather all the control he still possessed in order to not simply push Mrs Hudson out of path. He knew she didn’t deserve such an odious attitude but he could also predict that speaking up and therefore opening these still too fresh wounds would push him over the edge again. And breaking into the tears in front of yet another person was certainly not something he desired to make a habit of.
SHERLOCK
John. I didn't know you were awake.
“Yes, she's certainly an expert in playing the victim card but why am I supposed to give a shit about these fabricated lies?“
“Feel what?“
Easier said than done, Sherlock thinks, moaning loudly the very first moment John’s tongue brushes past the head of his cock. He wants to look, he
“You think I am going to simply forget about it?“
“Oh, God, I almost forgot,“ John cleared his throat, loudly, oscillating for a short while before striding to the kitchen. “I-I was about to make you a cup of tea, but then-“
. Speaking of which - I apologise for leaving so hastily. You know I am not suited for
Mary. She... shot you.
“Will you have another dance with me now, please?“ John asked once breaking their lips, sparks twinkling in his eyes.
“Sherlock,
Two years ago? No. No, Sherlock...
Oh, God help me, yes, I do.
SHERLOCK
“Dificult or not, I am not going to change my mind anyway,“ John shook his head in a resolute disagreement. “I can’t stay with Mary much longer, not after everything she’d done, definitely not so I could take care of a child she has with whatever random rascal. If I knew that you were about to do nothing despite the fact that she had bloody shot you in your chest I would have taken this matter into my own hands in the beginning. Maybe it wouldn’t have gone this far. Now it's too late. I-I, don't expect
“And there are no cashew nor peanuts, what are you going to munch while watching one of those ridiculous shows in the evening, I have-“
Sherlock watches him for a brief moment, angry at himself for allowing the fear to get in the way yet again. But the time has come to beat that beast for good. John’s right. There’s no use trying to pretend, trying to escape from their feelings, not any longer, not after today, Sherlock concludes. Taking a deep breath, he ever so gently grasps John’s wrist. It’s like he’s watching himself from outside his body, his actions, commanded by his heart rather than mind.
Of course we can keep her.
Holding on John for a few seconds.
A coma?

He hesitates no more, turns to approach Sherlock. Stops a few feet in front of him. Crosses his arms.

SHERLOCK
“John, you should bear in mind that Mary is currently under the influence of very strong emotions. Just look at the two of us. You-you said you
A soft, cheerful whisper resonates in John's ear and gently wakes him up. The first thing he gets to see once he opens his eyes is Sherlock's beaming face and a smile so bright it could light up the darkness. It takes his breath away.
Sherlock - trying to make a sense out of this situation.

of what is happening. I - for God’s sake, what is all this supposed to mean, John?“ he asked, with a touch of theatricality, tossing his arms in the air. He sprang up from the sofa, walking round the room in circles like an anxious lion inside his cage before he stopped all of a sudden as if his mind just clicked in an unexpected realisation.
Sighing, he has risen. As he walks past Sherlock, he reaches to gently touch his arm. It's brief, but it still makes Sherlock's brain malfunction for a second.
(encouragingly)
“You look awful, my, have you been crying? Christ, and what is-is that blood on your clothes?“
“I... I know,” Sherlock swallowed emptily. ”And I am so,
And biscuits.
Clocks were ticking too fast and there was only one thing that could have been done in order to save his life. Something Sherlock wished for never having to do, but here he was, having no other choice.
John's ward. On John, half-lying in the hospital bed. As he notices Sherlock, he grins, sits up.
CUT TO:
John can hardly tame his voice so he wouldn’t sound so shamelessly ecstatic over what Sherlock has proposed.
Sherlock’s cheeks flushed pink, his eyes flying wide open as he stuttered through his response. “H-how do you know- you-you were unconscious.“
She shot Sherlock, of course she's my concern.

Oh, was she flirting? I haven't noticed.

“You-you remember the date?“ John all but melts into a puddle but a sudden epiphany somewhat spoils the moment. “Christ, of course you
“Has he been pestering you?” he asks, addressing the words to Sherlock, but his gaze is fixated on Marco.
With all due respect, the violinists you've recommended were awful.
Sherlock frowns.
“I’ve done nothing,“ Sherlock protested, heading for an opposite side of the room because John was suddenly standing too close and the conversation was leading toward the way Sherlock would rather avoid walking. “I just-I just called an ambulance.“
“God...” John almost forgets how to breath for a second.
. I won’t do anything reckless, I swear. “
“A question, actually. What happened to
Sherlock didn’t even have to ask. As soon as he said those words, John’s face turned pale, his jaw clenching. “But those are-those are Moriarty’s words, Sherlock,“ he breathed out disbelievingly.
“I-I mean, no, I am not, not that much anyway,“ John shook his head, eyes pinned down upon the mattress. “I could’ve expected but when you put it into words like this…“

needs to flee the scene. Having said that, he reaches for the handle and quickly shuts the door behind him, trying to avoid Sherlock's gaze at all cost. Sherlock makes no further attempt to stop him, for the truth is, even if he did, he wouldn't know what to say afterward.
“John, let’s not pretend, you’re making it even remotely difficult.“
SHERLOCK
“Hold on. You-you forgot about something,“ Sherlock whispers, lowering John’s hand to his lips, pecking it just so tenderly.
John had never experienced such a silent ride back to Baker Street, not even when he’d had to return home all those years ago, all by himself, thinking he’d just said his last goodbye. This time, Sherlock was sitting right there beside him but his mind didn’t seem to be present at all. He was quieter than usual, remarkably so,
? I am taking our crime-free holiday one hundred percent seriously,” Sherlock insists, the crease on his forehead growing deeper. “He's still glaring. I don't like it. Told you that we hadn't been cautious enough.”
, Sherlock. I assume you’re just too happy,“ he chuckled, bumping Sherlock’s nose.
“Are you sure? It seems to be important for you.“
Maybe John was still a little besotted, but as soon as Sherlock mentioned the possibility of leaving the flat, he was back fully concentrated in an instant, ready to coax Sherlock out of this idea.
SHERLOCK
Turns out he doesn't. On the contrary. Slowly, John slides his fingers underneath Sherlock's shirt, pulls it off his shoulders and proceeds to stroke further down his back, dexterous fingers making Sherlock's skin tingle and burn and crave for a more intimate touch.
Silence. John walks up to Sherlock's bed.
who you are, you are the kindest man I've ever met, John.
A smile that morphed into a wry crook as soon as John shifted again, the moment he noticed that someone had been occupying the spot on the further side of the sofa. At first he was disoriented, blinking to open his eyes only slowly, Sherlock’s pale face being the first thing he recognised. Sherlock looked nowhere near as haggard as the day before but there was no spark in his eyes but sorrow, hidden behind the thin layers of blue.
“Your muscles are tense,” John observes as he rubs up and down Sherlock's nape. Sherlock suspects it's the doctor in him speaking, which only makes it harder to keep it together. Literally. He can only wish that John doesn't intend to stop anytime soon.
, I can’t take it on my own anymore. I want to tell him, I do, but how? I don’t think he would understand
But you love your work!
A sweet, beautiful woman in the client chair. Eyes on John, rather than Sherlock. Looks like she's trying to catch his attention.
Mrs. Hudson...!
That was until John changed the angle, hitting his prostate. Sherlock’s voice cracked, he arched his back, allowing John to pound into him so deep so he was being furiously driven against the wall. One of John’s hands flew to get a grip of Sherlock’s hair, tugging and pulling, the other one roamed round Sherlock’s body, stroking the moist skin for a brief moment before he sped up one more time. There was only one thought on Sherlock’s mind, he had never experienced anything that he’d consider more erotic. John holding him so tightly but still carefully enough, craving for his lips and body like one craves for his drug, kissing and sucking hungrily, each patch of Sherlock’s skin he could reach, bringing him close, so close with his cock and tongue and filthy praises uttered between open-mouthed kisses.
What I am saying... is that I want to spend the rest of my life by your side and no matter what, Sherlock, I won't let anyone ever harm you again.
Sherlock let out a tired sigh. It was ridiculous.
“I am aware,“ Sherlock replied. Mycroft smiled at him once again, but this time it was a warm, honest smile, full of encouragement. Then he simply turned on his heels and left so Sherlock could finally enter the room.
There are tears starting in John's eyes. He seems to be struggling inside, as if yearning to do something but isn't sure whether he is allowed.
What about... Him? Can't he help? Sherlock Holmes.
JOHN (CONT'D)
“We've spent half the day following Harrington around and what for? Such an... insufferably ordinary man. No skills, no brains,

Sherlock’s entire face is but a flushing red pepper, his eyes however, shining bright like fairy lights and his lips, spread into the widest possible grin. One fleeting look is all they exchange before they both burst into giggles again.
Clinging the borders of sink, taking deep breaths and filling his mind with bright, good memories of him and John, Sherlock eventually managed to lock off those thoughts that tried to poison his brain. It was as if someone suddenly switched on the light, darkness that enveloped his body and brain vanished into the nothingness as the man collapsed down on the floor.
Mary's not dead, stop rambling Sherlock, you're crazy.
Sherlock squirms in his seat. “I am doing... nothing special. You’d do the same for me. As a matter of fact you’ve been taking care of me since the very beginning. From that very first day, from that very afternoon on January twenty nine, you’ve been…

Three. God, how much John wants to kiss him now. The crinkle between his eyebrows, the tip of his nose, his pinkish cheeks, his

“Don’t be ridiculous. I need you.”
At this, John frowns,confused.
“Well, that's certainly not what I expected you to ask, but eventually-“
God, no, that's Lestrade.
SHERLOCK
“Are you sure?“ John drawls, taking a deep breath before reaching to intertwine their fingers yet again.
I am not actually
“As long as you’re ready,“ Sherlock exhales, his voice much higher he intended it to sound.
Terribly sorry, John...

Suddenly, Sherlock reaches for his glass of wine, throws it in his face.
Sherlock stands frozen for a few more seconds. The phone still next to his ear, trembling in his hand.
“Welcome home, John.“

At the bottom of the Thames.
Back on Sherlock - he returns the smile. Positively besotted.
I'll take everything from you, Sherlock, do you understand? It's your fault that John has learnt the truth about me. He's left me, just because of you.
Hands in his pockets, he comes to a halt.
“You’re such a child, Sherlock. I can see through you, you’re so transparent, like made of a fragile glass. You know, I don’t want to get rid of you solely for that you staying alive would destroy me. If John learnt the truth, he would crawl back to you like a loyal dog he is. I am repulsed by the mere thought of that. Who knows, maybe you two would-“
“I didn't actually
As soon as he retreated however, John squirmed in place, mumbling something incoherent in sleep, something sounding so close to Sherlock’s name that Sherlock almost fell from the chair out of shock.
. She loves you. Why would she continue hurting you on purpose?“
As soon as they enter the little (and rather minimalist) bar on the first floor, Sherlock orders two glasses of tequila and leads John toward a small table with two bar stools. To their relief, the music isn't too loud and most people are busy dancing, so the two of them can enjoy their drinks relatively in peace.
Thanks, I have a brilliant teacher.
I am not sure it's a good idea.

“I’ve seen your face before. You are… Sherlock Holmes, aren’t you?“
MRS. HUDSON
“Yes you can…,“ Sherlock sighed, whipping around, “stay here, John, it’s for your own good. Trust me.“
Sherlock looks deeply disappointed. He sits on the chair opposite John.
Silence descended. Sherlock offered no response but another utterly confused look before he squinted at John, gazing at him as pensively as if he was trying to deduce what was actually going through his head. “Is – is

“Well, as a matter of fact, I am surprised myself, John. I should’ve known better at this point. I should’ve known you were going to figure it out yourself. There’s no use fooling such a smart man like you, is there?“
“Christ of course I
Sherlock pursed his lips. That's exactly what he had always wanted, but judging from John's tone, he didn't share the same enthusiasm. Or so it seemed.
“You say the same thing about eating,” John murmurs, closing his eyes, feeling so tired he can barely keep them open. “And the Solar System. And singing... Come to think of it, is there
“When were you planning on to tell John?“ Mary asked, turning Sherlock’s concentration back to herself.
Sherlock didn’t even need to say a word, John knew exactly what he wanted. He seized Sherlock’s waist, dipping his nails into Sherlock’s skin before he pulled the man even closer and thrust faster, leaning forward to claim Sherlock’s lips once again. He sucked and kissed with such voracity so Sherlock melted into a gibbering mess,sliding up and down the wall quite roughly but he couldn’t care less at the moment.
John frowns, as if he hoped to hear a
For the first time in forever, Sherlock's face lightens up. He musters up a small smile.
“The only thing that kept me alive was the thought of you, John,” Sherlock's voice cracked but he kept talking. It was the first time he truly allowed himself to show his most vulnerable side to John, but he didn't care. He had to let the truth out.

“Sherlock, come on, you can’t shut yourself out like this,“ John lamented, making sure it didn’t sound too reproachful.

I know you said after breakfast, John, but-
Sherlock is quite certain he must be blushing embarrassingly hard at the moment but he tries to ignore it. Fortunately enough, John’s tender hand on his back helps so he can collect himself, turning each of his insecurities into dust.
Before making further inquiry he reaches for the mug Sherlock prepared for him, taking the first tentative sip.
Compared to you. Definitely.

“I am certain of it,” Sherlock asserts, pushing himself away from the wall.
“I don't blame you. I'd say something myself but, to be perfectly frank, my brain malfunctioned when you kissed me.”
“For someone who claims to be a genius, you can be a pretty rubbish observer sometimes,“ John giggled, watching his own fingers brushing Sherlock’s skin. Once however he spotted a group of people approaching them, he quickly retreated and shuffled a little away from Sherlock as if what he was just doing was something illegal. Sherlock on the other hand kept his gaze fixed upon his hand, not paying attention to anything that was happening around him, not even John who addressed him at least three times since then.
SHERLOCK
“I told you I have plenty of work to do,“ Sherlock lazily waved his hand. “I will hardly even mull over the idea of sleeping in the course of the next few days.
“I know that I made it seem like I don’t care about us,“ Sherlock whispered, not leaving John a chance to react. “But that was just because I care
“Of course you are,“ John grinned, planting a tiny smooch over the one of Sherlock’s cheeks that wasn’t injured.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock appears to be bemused because
“I know,“ Sherlock swallowed before speaking up again, but it was more than difficult to pronounce words at the moment. “John, Mary was planning to deliver a baby… somehow- no, wait, I am getting there, don’t worry. You were so thrilled and I-I didn’t want to hurt you,“ he spitted out, avoiding John’s gaze. “Sure, soon you would learn the truth anyway but I had no idea how to tell you while Mary was still in the picture, I was scared that you wouldn’t believe me if I told you and so I-“
“Anything of importance?“
The saddest part about these thoughts is that right now, in this very moment... John is having

. Obsessed with John and not in a nice way. I wish you would just shoot me already,“ Sherlock sighed out in hope that she will do the right opposite of what he was requesting. He had no plan, no serious way of how to prevent Mary from pulling the trigger.
Sherlock's jaw dropped ever so slightly. John kept twisting the knife and God, did it hurt.
There was?
As she walks up to his bed, to check some equipment, Sherlock throws a glance at her, finally acknowledges her presence. Then looks around the room, still typing. He blinks, slowly, as if he's just realised something.
He looks at the screen, frowning deeply.
“And if they don't?” he raises an eyebrow. And as it happens, the banging on the door only gets louder.

It's 11 PM.
“Nothing,“ he faked a smile. “But I am afraid
Sherlock's face breaks into a huge grin.
“Yeah, it was quite a day,“ John sighed in bliss, staring off into the empty space as if he was replaying the memories in his head.
“Not eating will make you the opposite of one hundred percent fit,” John insists.
“Well, the bed up there is pretty small, all loose and cranky,“ John brought out, beckoning upwards. “Yours on the other hand is silk sheets and cotton covers and I can actually turn around without the entire bed creaking under me.“
What the - what are we going to do about it?
Sherlock opened his mouth to protest but then he had to admit that his reaction was perhaps too harsh. So they continued up the stairs, Sherlock supporting John with both of his arms, eyes fixed on his face, studying his expressions, waiting for a sign that John is too tired to walk anymore but they managed to reach the platform without any further distractions.
Sherlock's mouth falls open.
Marco huffs indignantly at that. “Geez, who hurt you?”
“If it’s not too much trouble.”
“Sherlock, there's nobody here.”

“Sherlock you’ve been staring at me like this for the past five minutes, is there something you want to say?“ John asks, his voice oddly soft, nearly velvet.
SHERLOCK
It was all too simple, the easiest option was to simply get high and forget about the world around him, but Sherlock had no heart doing something such unfair to John, not after he saved his life and his own was imperilled. He was staring absently at the cigarette squeezed in his hand, disgusted, swallowing down the taste of gall in his mouth. His hands were still smeared with dark drained blood, John’s blood, Sherlock felt its foul taste on the tip of his tongue. If he didn’t avert his eyes away he would probably throw up on the carpet.

Panning out, as John turns to sit down on a chair again. And there he waits.
“Well, it would seem so.“ John flashed him an uncertain smile, drawing up in his coat when a chilly gust blew around. “Not gonna lie, Sherlock, I thought I was never going to come back,“ he added, “not permanently.“

, John,“ Sherlock titters, rocking back and forth on his heels. As it transpires, John has successfully managed to turn his brain into a useless mush, touch of his lips being the only thing Sherlock is capable of focusing on in this surreal moment.
“Who knows,“ John shrugged his shoulders. “My doctor said it’s a miracle that I pulled through so fast and without any consequences. But then again, as it transpired, it wasn’t as bad as they thought. I apparently didn’t even lose as much blood as it seemed so at first. What I estimate is that they keep me here for about a week before I’ll be able to walk away by myself.“
“Didn't you?” he furrows his brow.
John offered no answer at first. He leaned down and pressed a sweet loving kiss over his cheek. “I am constantly worried about you,“ he whispered. “Don’t you dare to do anything that could result in your death, you sod, okay?“

I can hardly stay away from you for more than two minutes.
“She’s acting strange,“ John continued, taking one more sip before putting the mug on the stool next to him. “And no, it’s not the hormones, Sherlock, she often disappears for hours and then when she comes back she has no decency to tell me where she’s been. Sherlock, I swear, if there was no baby, I would… God, she stormed out of the flat once again, right before I left.“
FADE IN:
“We should... go back to our room,” he hears himself say but doesn't make a move until Sherlock replies.
John lifts his gaze, gives him a questioning look.
(in a hopeful voice)
Panning to the front door. Holding on the 221B for a moment.
As soon as he locked their lips however, Sherlock’s phone beeped in the pocket of his jacket and such positively charged moment was irretrievably gone.
“That went well.”
It wasn’t until he heard that voice again, now close and real, almost palpable, that Sherlock realised where he in fact was. Memories started flowing back all at once, loading his brain with a ton of information.
“Jesus... Jesus, John.” Sherlock sighs loudly and loosens his grip on John's hair, threading his fingers numbly through the silver strands as if trying to calm himself again. As soon as he catches his breath, he pulls John up to his feet and into a sloppy, dirty kiss and wordlessly pushes him out of the shower and toward the bedroom.

The... one with the... lizard eyes?
(scowls)
“You can stay for longer, if you want,“ he remarked, his lips crooked in a bashful smile. John was caught off in a surprise but this time he had no doubts that Sherlock let to drop a hint right in front of him, whether intentionally or not. He would lie if he said it didn’t make his heart race. They somewhat seamlessly skipped the awkward initial phase of figuring out what label suits their current relationship the best and here they were, basically flirting with each other, or at least, that’s what Sherlock seemed to be practicing at the moment. John was confused however. Not even twenty four hours had passed since they agreed on that they won’t talk about their feelings anytime soon, especially because Sherlock seemed to be reluctant to do so back then. But maybe he was just too scared and insecure. Maybe he simply wanted their relationship to progress naturally, without having to muse about it too hard. John decided to hold onto this conjecture, because it made him believe that maybe he got a chance with Sherlock after all, however small it was. For years he had been convinced that Sherlock won’t be able to reciprocate his feelings, but after all that had happened, after what Sherlock confessed, after such a drastic change in his attitude, it seemed there still was a hope after all. Besides, John had already admitted that they were moving forward, he already told Sherlock that he had always been the most important person for him, so he could have as well played along and coquet a bit, whether it turns out great or unpleasantly wrong.
You are so much more than your brain. You've always been and I've always known. Sherlock, you... You have the kindest of hearts. You're caring, you're tender even though you scarcely show it. You help people who deserve to be helped and never ask for anything in return. See, these thoughts... these nightmares that invade your mind, do not define you. Don't trust anything they say, it's all lies.
“Mhm, you really are in a rush,“ Sherlock sniggered, he couldn’t pass an opportunity to banter with John. “Not that I am complaining. In fact you can do to me

What John felt in that moment wasn’t even rage. He was scared. Just the idea of Sherlock’s life being in danger again awakened the protector inside of him. He was ready to guard Sherlock for twenty four hours a day if there was a need. Sherlock surprisingly enough didn’t argue against him for any longer. Not this time.
Quietly, John leaves the room.

“What do you suggest then? D'you want to abandon the case?”

“Fine, then,“ Sherlock pouted, giving a surrendering nod. “But let me have a question, last one, people do that, don’t they?
, Sherlock thinks, assuming that John is wasting time on purpose just so he can drive Sherlock completely mad with need.
“Name's Marco.”
And so Sherlock does, surprised to find how close they're actually sitting.
Sherlock utters no words but John suspects that if it wasn’t for the cloth covering his eyes, he would be giving him the filthiest look right now. It’s hypnotising, watching Sherlock’s mouth closing around his fingers, tongue briskly twisting around each one of them, each such a contact making John crave for those luscious lips more and more until Sherlock’s moans turn so needy so it gets impossible trying to keep their mouths apart.
“Hmm, since about the moment I saw your cheeks turning pink for the first time,“ John chuckled.
“I thought you'd like to know -” he pulls out a pen and a small notebook from his pocket, quickly scribbles something inside, then takes a step toward Sherlock, holding it open for him and John to see. “

If Mycroft didn’t approach them in time Sherlock would definitely have to be dragged out of the hospital against his will.
He offers the document to John.
John frowns at Sherlock.
SHERLOCK
John’s sobs echo loudly in the quiet room. He’s been slouching in his chair for several hours already, his head down and face buried in his hands as if he’s been carrying the heaviest burden upon his shoulders. His body aches, drained and exhausted, craving the comfort of a warm bed and yet, he makes no effort to move, for he has neither will nor energy left to get up and return back to his bedroom. He is vaguely aware of Sherlock’s voice piping up somewhere in the distance, calling his name for an umpteenth time but John doesn’t respond to the other man's worries. He rarely does any more.
Make me.
Neither him nor John say much for the rest of the ride, barely a word during the flight. It’s not until they arrive at the hotel that John finally breaks the ever so heavy silence.
Sherlock wasn't prepared for such a sight, however. John was standing there behind the glass, utterly terrified, looking down at Sherlock so hurt as if he was losing a piece of his own heart. For a moment Sherlock stood bewildered in the middle of the street, ignoring the droplets of water that seeped uncomfortably through his clothes. Even through the thick wall of rain he could see John’s pained face quiet clearly, so clearly he nearly took a step back and returned to the flat so he could take everything back and explain, never mind the consequences. Talk to John. Anything to be in his presence.

“Please tell me what’s going on.“
SHERLOCK (CONT'D)
All right, you win.
They’re the last to leave the restaurant, uttering barely any words ever since. Walking side by side in silence that is somewhat difficult to break, they soon find themselves back at Baker Street, Sherlock gazing at John, longingly, like the deepest desire it is, wishing he could read the man’s mind. Just once, just this one time to learn what kind of thoughts are currently going through his head. Sherlock yearns to know what John
“You think I am…
John had never seen anyone’s cheeks turning so pink so fast. Sherlock’s face softened around all the edges, like it was about to melt into a puddle.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, but not even he could believe the sentences his mind knitted in order to derogate the situation. “I am not ruining
John gives a strained laugh. The prospect of him and Sherlock visiting the most romantic city on Earth is definitely not what he wants to be discussing right now.

. But no more tears, please,“ he implored, gently caressing. “I don’t ever want to see you hurt again, Sherlock. All I want to see is this gorgeous smile on your face, all the time. I am here for you, to protect you and keep you safe and happy. I know you can manage to take care of yourself, but I do want to be here for you. Always.“
Sherlock can feel John’s fingers threading and tangling his hair before he tugs so firmly so Sherlock’s scalp tingles, just the right way, but then Sherlock pulls even further, taking the whole length of John’s cock into his mouth so this time John truly, completely loses control over his movements.
“Mhm. And you haven’t even seen the bedroom yet.”
Seeing that John's struggling to think of any other flower-
A red hair. To be precise.
SHERLOCK
Yeah, Sherlock, he's...er... Well, um-
(surly)
In case you need anything, call a nurse.
But I am better than I was. Still a little muddleheaded, but other than that... much better.
“Well, but that’s why we called upon your brother, didn’t we?“ John smiled, relieved that Sherlock finally decided to listen to him. He turned around toward Mycroft who was purposefully looking the other way.
The call has been ended.
. My left eye doesn't even resemble an eye any longer, an inch to the left and I'd lose it completely. Admit it, Sherlock, I am an ugly, broken man now, no need to fake kindness to make me feel better.” John allows himself to cry some more, loudly and shamelessly, tears streaming down his face.
Silence. A moment of utter shock. Sherlock - his mouth falls open.
“Yup,” Sherlock nods, popping the p at the end, then returns to his phone as if they didn’t just have one of the most awkward conversations ever.
DR. MASON
John blinks at Sherlock, half in disbelief, half confused, still, despite everything, but he doesn’t try to argue with Sherlock any longer. He takes a moment to ponder, his right eye fixed on Sherlock, thoroughly studying his expression.
A few seconds later - John's phone starts to buzz, immediately waking him up. Sherlock just stirs, sleeps on.
“Of course I did. Where do you think I disappeared?“
On John, there is a frown on his face. Infuriated.
, otherwise, he might as well drown in his repressed emotions.
“What? That’s it? What is that supposed to mean?“ Sherlock frowned.
, John. I’ve been scared. I’ve never felt like that before. Before I met you, there had been no one like you.“
“What about them?“ John scowled, breathing a little heavily. “You just said you think that Mary was the one who sent you this and now-“  John’s voice halted once he managed to put the pieces together.
the man’s going to be there. Sherlock is always two steps ahead...
“You think I would let you getting shot again? Or worse?“
It wasn’t the entire truth but enough to begin with. John had omitted the most important part of his confession, he didn’t say anything about love nor how from the first moment he laid his eyes on Sherlock he wished for nothing else but to kiss those firm enticing lips. But Sherlock wouldn’t want to hear any of that, at least that’s what John thought.
times last week. And now… she’s not around anymore,“ he chuckled.
hiding. Nonetheless, John couldn’t feel more relieved. He tosses the phone on the bed and steps forward, quietly pulling the door open. His gaze immediately goes to Sherlock’s tall, slender figure leaning over the railing. Sherlock has yet to realise that John’s watching him, for John’s somewhat stiffened silently in the doorway and he himself seems to be deeply engrossed in admiring the sea view.... or not. As it transpires, Sherlock’s preoccupied doing something entirely else and it’s something John did not expect, let alone wished to witness him doing. First John notices the foul smell, and in turn, his eyes are drawn to the thin stream of smoke emanating from the cigarette Sherlock’s holding. John’s heart sinks at this sight.
“You want to go outside like

She shrugged. “Because I have questions.“

“You’re exaggerating,“ John snapped him. “You and all those bloody physicians too, I am fine, can’t you see?“ John tried to prove it by taking a few brisk steps, but as soon as he hastened his pace a sharp cutting pain hit him in the ribs and he had to reach for the railing in order to not collapse on the pavement.
“Well, excuse me but the first time you got shot it was your shoulder,“ Sherlock said earnestly as if it was a fact John wasn’t aware of. “
He turns to walk where the sound is coming from - sitting room, coffee table. He grabs the phone, cancels the call.
LESTRADE
“Oh, I hated that scarf, John-“ Sherlock utters, silly smile on his lips so John would stop feeling so guilty. “Until of course you put it into a much better use. It’s such a shame we’ll have to use a different one next time.“
John’s stomach drops at those words. The taste of remorse is much more toxic now that it hits him how ridiculously rude he was toward Sherlock. “I said I didn’t want you here,“ he exhales, disgusted of his own words. His voice appears to be tired, barely a raspy whisper.
The sound of a wheezing kettle distracts them.

“You know what? Forget about it,“ he hissed instead. “You sure are damn lucky you haven’t met him sooner, he would have happily reveal all of your dirty secrets in ten seconds flat and you’d
“Obviously,“ Sherlock nods. “Next time when you’ll be the one lying in bed, blindfolded. Assuming you want to try that too, naturally.“
“Oh, for God's sakes.” The flirty smile has turned upside down, much to John's confusion. Sherlock isn't even looking at him anymore, his gaze seems to be drawn to something in the distance, far behind John's back.
“Let’s take a break for a moment,“ John suggests, his mellow voice snapping Sherlock out of daydreaming.
You're doing that constantly.
“Jesus, this isn’t a conversation I intended to have so early in the morning, especially not after what happened,“ John uttered at last, rubbing his eyes so to prevent tears from bursting but he couldn't stop a broken sob from escaping his throat. “Sherlock, you can't just say it doesn't matter what
“...Yes.”
“Torture?“ John frowned but kept his fingers dancing lightly across Sherlock’s forearm.
“Sherlock, are you all right?“
“Wasn’t that hard... it is anything but a pleasure to meet you, Aksana.“
“John, I understand that you must be frustrated,“ Sherlock said as bluntly as if he wasn’t even listening, still caressing John’s arm. “I am making you wait for something you had a lack of for how long? A year?“
“How would you-? How the hell did you deduce
. Fortunately enough, Sherlock comprehends, easily switches to Spanish and places the order. With a smile, the waitress takes a few notes but it's only after she walks away that John collects himself again.
Sherlock reaches across the table, takes John's hand.
“Were you any lucky?“ he asked, his voice so soft and warm that Sherlock felt he could melt if he was listening to it for too long.
Ah, certainly. If I were you I'd go through the files of every single male bank employee in London. The redheads, obviously. That's where you'll find the men you're looking for. I am about ninety nine percent sure.
“Well, this is...
Sherlock rolls his eyes, standing up from his chair before he takes a long step toward John. “Isn’t it obvious that I am just making ridiculous excuses because I prefer to stay in your company?“
“Sherlock, I-“

“Mr. Harrington claims you two were pestering him and followed him around the hotel,” Lidia explains. Judging by the tone of her voice, Sherlock suspects she doesn't quite believe the story. Ironically enough, Harrington
CUT TO:
By the time John and Sherlock arrive at the suite, the sun has already begun to set. The few hours at the pool was time well spent and afterward, Sherlock took John to the restaurant again and ordered a bowl of spaghetti so big that John would have probably not even finished it if he weren't that ravenous after swimming.
It was difficult however. But not because John wasn’t willing to wait for them to get even more intimate with each other for as long as there was a need. What they’ve had so far was more than enough, more than he could’ve wished for a month ago, but the truth was that Sherlock wasn’t making the waiting any bearable. Even though he decided to wear at least pants into the bed in order to prevent any awkward accidents and because of still feeling rather shy and insecure, he didn’t care that much about decency when it came to different parts of his body.
On Sherlock's face again, turns white as sheet.
Dr. Mason throws an apologetic look at John, then heads to the door. Nurse Barton, right on her feels, closes the door behind them.

to act now before he is able to change his mind again. Clutching the lapels of Sherlock's shirt, he moves to push him against the nearest wall and locks their lips in the most fervent, passionate kiss. He's been holding back for
Oh. You're updating your blog.
“Thank you. Believe me, I did want to reply to your texts. And answer your calls. But I was so... angry and frustrated and still in shock and what you'd said left me so confused, my feelings were all over the place. And Mary wasn't exactly helpful either. She kept talking about the wedding, that I should concentrate on the preparations, that it would help.”

“I would never do that to you, again,“ Sherlock turned to the other man, meeting his lips for a brief moment. “But that doesn’t mean I am done pursuing her, John,“ he mumbled once pulling back.
Sherlock, I didn't... I don't mind.
“Why of course,“ John nodded, a chuckle escaping his throat. He simply couldn’t contain the joy he felt in the moment. “It took me an awful lot of time to realise but better later than never, hm? We’re finally

DR. MASON
“Now,
“I understand, it’s difficult for both of us,“ he said, his thumb rubbing a circle over the pliant cotton of Sherlock’s coat. “I guess we still haven’t quite recovered from the last serious conversation we had. We’re definitely not ready for another one it seems.“
Alright, I am sure your story is very entertaining, Mrs. Hudson, but I have to go. Right now. Proposal, remember?
“I am sorry, okay? I am just not sure if you’re prepared to hear the worst about her,“ Sherlock said.
Dr. Watson... what are you doing here?
Forcing a weak smile, he pushes open the door to the flat.
“I know, I know,“ John sighed. “So what? Are we going to call Mycroft?“
Close on Sherlock opening his eyes again.
Thank you.
“And now…
Right... What about your leg?
A cry was close to escape his throat when he realised how much blood John already lost and how much precious time he’s already wasted just kneeling down there, serving no purpose at all apart from blaming himself for what happened. Not letting off the other man, who wasn’t responding, but fortunately still breathing at least, he managed to reach into his pocket to pick his phone and then call an ambulance, something which he knew he should’ve done seconds ago.
“Up-upstairs?“ Sherlock’s brow furrowed as if he suddenly wasn’t even aware of that the John’s room was indeed up another flight of stairs.
-panicking. And so is John. Wondering how might Sherlock possibly finish that sentence.
“What if I don’t care?“ She narrowed her eyes, not changing her stance. “What if I told you that Sherlock is going to die if you won’t kill me?“
“I-I-I’ve never been better, John,“ Sherlock exhales, still trying to return back from high so it takes him a couple of seconds until he’s able to continue. “That-that was the most – the most intense climax, I-I’ve ever… God,
“What the hell was
“About what?“
in particular. John had never before felt as affected by a mere sound as in that single moment. He had trouble finding the right words to describe Sherlock’s voice however. Usually it rumbled deep like a thunder with an enormous ferocity and strength, sometimes on the other hand, his voice resembled a sea - calm, peaceful, blending with the blue sky on the horizon. This time however there was something new about it, something strangely mysterious, yet sexier than ever before. John could listen to that voice until drawing his last breath, but the temptation to chain their lips again was suddenly far more alluring.
John's eyes widen in sheer disbelief. Sherlock, on the other hand, looks only mildly intrigued. Still... intrigued nonetheless. And it's not like he can argue with the look that John's just given him.
Sherlock sighs happily.
Means tomorrow the entire London will now.
VICAR
Hold on, what a brilliant idea, we must start preparing the wedding. Right. Now.
I know. It's always been true.
“I told you, you don’t have to be embarrassed, Sherlock,“ John uttered in rather a serious tone, but then suddenly he found the whole situation so amusingly bizarre that he couldn’t prevent a snigger from escaping his throat.
loss. They have absolutely no right to judge you. Whatever they say, they’re always wrong anyway.“
think that’s weak. I – I appreciate it,“ Sherlock added, taking a pause almost as if he couldn’t find a word strong enough to express his gratitude.
What are you- you're leaving? But I... I don't want you to go.
“You wish.“

It was difficult to concentrate on anything but John’s warm touch. Sherlock took a couple of long, deep breaths, almost as if he had to brace himself before offering a reply.
Oh, right, sorry.

, please, you are extremely good at it. Even if you would finally find her one day, what would happen? You think she wouldn’t be prepared? You said she knows that you are trying to get to her. Sherlock, please, I am asking you one last time - give up on pursuing her, forget about this… revenge or whatever it is that’s driving you right into the devil’s snare, hm?“

On Molly, seated next to Sherlock's mum, she and the rest of the guests laugh.
“N-no. I...,” Sherlock cleared his throat and clasped his hands in front. Never before he had felt as lost and clueless as during that conversation and it showed. “To be perfectly honest, I don't know what I expected. I guess I was naively hoping that I'd come back, I'd find you here and we'd, perhaps, maybe... I don't know, could-”
