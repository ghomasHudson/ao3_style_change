project anyway?” He turned fully toward him, inching closer on the bench seat.
“TWO, I just had Diablo Tacos,” he paired his upheld finger with another one loosely and continued.  “Can’t blame a man for being affected by hi-octane spice, Cas.”
He smiled wistfully into the middle distance.  “There will be a day when I won’t have an answer, or you won’t want my help to tame that creature.  I would just like the chance to regroup without you thinking I’m running away.  More than that, I want the chance to not use it – to show you I am not going anywhere, even when you brandish your claws.”
Dean’s heart hammered in his chest.  He drank the nearest glass of whiskey down in one go, but kept his clammy right hand wrapped around it like a lifeline.  The silence between them rang out like church bell, but his hand returned to his lips to prevent him from calling out the harsh truth he hoped his story wouldn’t give voice to.
He guided the body leaning against him onto the mattress and tossed the crumpled comforter on top of him.
“Good thinking,” he said with a low labored exhale that stopped the angel in his tracks.
His long strides brought him into the chilled night air before he could hear the end of his lack luster platitude.   He slammed the door behind him, knowing no one aside from them could hear it anyway.  A foreboding silence rode shotgun on his entire ride home.  All he could hope was that Mick’s confession would sooth them both before Dean found out what trouble was headed his way.
His fingers mushed over the digital keyboard mangling his words nervously.  After correcting and re-correcting the words he sent an affirmative reply.  Just as suddenly, a response came:
“I fucking know, Ketch,” he sneered.  “Scout’s honor and all that bullshit.”
“Point taken.”  Sam pointed his bottle neck towards Castiel and made an affirming groan mid-gulp.  “So what’s this about you inhabiting James or vice versa?”
He loosely crossed his legs and continued the interrogation unimpeded.  “On what?”
“Let me finish, please,” he begged, eyes subverting Dean’s gaze for a moment.  “After we moved further east to the manufacturing facility the second in command began connecting the dots as to why they had less money and even less bullets than they accounted for.  I was successful in pointing the fingers in another direction, but had to explain why I made trips out of the compound to make calls to a Virginia telephone number.  The alias I picked had no family and no love for the government after being wrongfully detained for armored robbery for 6 years.  They tracked the calls to the FBI switchboard on my burner phone even with the call masking software somehow.”
Sam laid a firm hand over his clenched fist for a moment, drawing him out of his desperate plea.  “We won’t let anything happen to him.  I’m just not sure I believe your explanation.  I doubt anyone at the bureau would either.  Aside from his abnormally fast healing ability, I can’t see any part of him as paranormal.  Just because he lacks the ability to tell us he’s a foreign agent or secret military officer, doesn’t mean he isn’t.”
First, he would to weed out other possibilities before by engaging further.  Maybe this guy was deaf, or didn’t speak his native tongue, or was autistic, or was just incredibly disoriented.  The battered badge returned to his left breast jacket pocket and he opened his hands to show the confused man he was not a threat.
The agent chuckled at him.  “I knew you went through all my stuff.  As soon as that record player came out, I… Oh, fuck...” he melted into the silky feel of Cas’s lubed fingers stroking his cock leisurely.  His hips pistoned forward into his grasp which guided him back between Cas’s thighs.  His deft fingers paid special attention to the head, then massaged the slickness all the way up and down his shaft as the agent mewed raspy pleasures.  Cas lined up his cock beside his own slippery mast and gripped them both sending shivers running down his ramrod straight spine.  Dean propped his forehead on Cas’s for support and laid his palms on either side of his tensing torso.  Cas grabbed the globe of his ass cheek to better guide him to push and withdraw in time with his firm tugs until they matched their precise wavelengths.  Otherwise empty hands clamored for each other’s lust warmed flesh; tugging and claiming desperately.  Their movements and slow deep breaths quickened into clipped gasps as he picked up speed.  The slip and slide of friction turned manic as their lips found each other again.  A frenzy of slicked fingers and searching tongues brought them to the edge of orgasmic inevitability when Cas covered Dean’s eyes with his free hand.  The agent pushed his face into the odd sensation and fell over the edge, sputtering his spend all over his welcoming belly.  Moments later, Cas’s hand held firm at the end of a stroke at the base of their cocks and Dean felt warmth launch all the way up to his chest, freckling his chin.  After they stilled the blind folding hand lead his lips back to Cas’s and they kissed with renewed insistence, leaving the ending of one man and the beginning of an angel up to the cosmos.  They panted loosely once again.  Cas released Dean giving them a chance to calm their heaving chests, lying back on the rumpled comforter.  Dean added with a mischievous grin, “Not that that wasn’t hotter than I could have imagined, but please tell me you’re gonna fuck me next time.”
“That was tea, Dean.  You know what?  Just forget it.  Let’s just focus on the dinner.  I have a laundry list of questions to ask him,” he simmered down focusing instead on a bullet point text document scrolling far too close to his eyes.  “The guy looks good on paper: two previous small community projects with a great ROI, hands off, and willing to put the work in to learn the ins and outs of the business.  It looks like he even has an address listed a few miles from here, so he would only have a half hour commute to the brewery, if his intentions to be hands on are sincere.”
“Hey, where is that mind of yours taking you?” he lowered his head to center himself in Dean’s view.  “I’m not disappointed.  There’s just so much I don’t know about you.”
“Better than us?” Sitting straight up, he grated against the idea.  “Better than his family?”
At the tail end of a breath he didn’t remember holding, his feet landed on solid ground.  Back within the protective brick walls and grey pillars of the bunker, home in the halls of the life he knew, he turned his head from the vanishing pinhole of space beside him to the doorway of Dean’s man cave.  He barely registered where he landed, only feeling a rift in his Grace where the link probed into the vacuum of empty space.  Glimpses of the agent bounced back at him, but he knew it was only a residual sensation in the oversensitive and withering tether.  He brushed the back of his sleeve over his face, not entirely sure if it captured more of his tears or the agent’s.  Everything atom around him suffocated him with its wrongness, like he was the round peg on this square universe.  Then again, it wasn’t the first time he felt out of place on this planet.  Not even close.
“Alright, but don’t uncuff him unless you have to.  The assistant director wants this cleared up quickly and if he runs off and we have to track him down.  It will cut into a case actually worth our time.”
“You can’t be serious,” he scrubbed the sleepies out of the far corners of his eyes and sat up.  Seeing the edge worn envelope with Cas’s distinctively neat handwriting on his bedside table out of the corner of his eye made his stomach churn anxiously.
About fifteen feet from the archway to the kitchen, Dean stopped Cas before they got in line of sight and gave him a long solemn nod.  Cas canted his head, but nodded uncertainly in return.  With renewed fervor, Dean bounded into the kitchen and exclaimed, “Who was it, Sammy?!”
Not wanting to disturb the angel on the twilight of rest, he lightly shook his head, “No more than you are already doing, Cas.  Just let me hold you while you sleep.  Being close to you like this will remind me that this is our normal, however new it may be.  Having your hands on me tomorrow won’t be quite as embarrassing if … you know.”
“Oh thank fuck,” he exhaled loudly.
“That’s good though, right?” Sam attempted to assure him.
Sam twisted his mouth around in thought, not entirely opposed to owing Gabriel one.  Before he could offer anything Gabriel grinned wide.  “Consent, Gabe.”
Sam sat up angrily.  “You think Davies is a counterspy?  That’s ludicrous!”
Never had he been so eager to agree with him.  He marveled at the exotic baubles and tchotchkes that lined the inlets along the far walls, noting the prominence of the exotic weapons first.  The burgeoning well of questions began to overflow.  While the novel expanse of books varying from broad to impossibly specific glittered in Sam’s corneas, Dean checked the time on his phone sporting a pained grimace.  Sam gave him a consternated huff.
--------------------------
He climbed onto the bar stool opposite Cas and scooted around the hard wooden seat uncomfortably.  The all stainless steel kitchen appliances and intricately tiled backsplash made the modern kitchen the crown jewel of the on the first floor.  Strangely though, the countertops and island were barren.  No utensils or cooking tools were hidden away in their corners.  Maybe the cupboards were bare as well.  “Did she make it through your security protocols, too?”
He scooted close enough to feel the heat of his shoulder through his jacket.  “What’s it called?”
“Look, I’m not here to judge, but uppers are hardly the way to keep up with the workload around…”
The smug expression on Dean’s face as he detailed the inner workings of his domain sent a flutter through Castiel’s middle like a temperate gust of wind.
He panicked but remained seated fixed in place by unknowns until Dean cleared his throat sending a hush across the yard.  He frowned spotting the hesitance in Dean’s mannerisms.
A silhouette clarified against the intruding light beyond the open door.  The figure was male, lean with an athletic build, short hair, his clothes swaying with no wind to ruffle through them.  It was worse than he thought.  It felt like he was being probed.  Fear’s clutch closed tighter on his shoulders inch by inch.  His breath crystalized in the air the moment it left his lips.  The man’s footsteps halted a few feet from him and paused at the threshold.  The light was so bright he had to close his eyes, but he guarded his face with upturned forearms.  He was braced.  He was ready.  This man’s foreboding presence swatted away the cold daggers of fear’s needling grasp.
He turned around to lean over the railing and waited for Sam to join him before he spoke.  “At first I thought it was a Djinn dream or some magic induced façade.  I fell again but as time passed, it became apparent I wasn’t on Earth.”
Cas shook his head and looked out into the light of the hall.  While they had a head start, he could think of nothing he would hate more than to have the younger Winchester walk in on them.  “Hold on,” he grunted.
“Depends,” he crowded into his space inch by inch.
people and let them roam free?” he harangued.
A breezy simper seeped into his reply, “That’s a new one.  He’s normally the cool headed one.”
“Do it, Cas.  Show me.  You’re so hot right now,” he whispered into his mouth.
He pulled a face at her.  “Don’t you start, too.”
The angel leaned forward with his forearms hanging over the railing silently.  If he was closer to human on the mortal scale, he was dressed too lightly for the evening winter breeze, Dean fussed.  He had been gone for way too long.  He was lonely.  There were a thousand reasons to wrap his arms around his shoulders and never let go.  Still he stood firm gazing at the friend he scryed universes for in vain for days on end.
He smile apologetically and took the opportunity to return the exploratory touches, but couldn’t garner the meddle Dean had in the range of skin he broached.  “Ever since you mentioned your memory foam mattress the other day I couldn’t help but wonder what kind of place your inner sanctum would be, what comforts you surrounded yourself with,” he smirked diverting his gaze away from the sulky emerald irises to the record player momentarily.  “I must say it wasn’t what I expected.”
Several puppy eye configurations ricocheted off of his visage in an attempt to weasel a better answer out of the obnoxious angel.  “There’s gotta be something you can do.”
“After I place the vessel on you, stay as still as possible,” Cas commanded firmly.  “Don’t fight the trap.  It will do the pulling for you.”
He shot a puckish grin over the hood.  “Less rude than the ribbing I would get leaving a party early with such a hot guy.  If you think we’d leave without a chorus of wolf whistles, you clearly don’t know them well enough.”
Wisps of chest hair inches from his nose bayed beneath the force of Dean’s rough contemplative sigh.  “Is that why you always cover them up?  You think he won, too?”
Murmurs of meandering jazz serenaded them from inside, bursting into clarity momentarily as the doors swung open and closed.  Sam and the stranger prattled on about the weather and the drive, clearly holstering negotiations and veiled interrogations for appetizers.  They trudged forward intermittently, eventually making it to the host’s stand just inside the door.  Sam took the reins, confirmed the reservations, but let him walk ahead.  The oaf stood in place, letting Dean catch up only to stop him in his tracks.  His whisper was an off-key song of judegment, “Are you planning on being a struggle bus all evening?”
--------------------------
All it heralded from what he could guess was a frustrated grunt.
Turned towards his reclining frame get a better view, he canted his head and waited out Dean’s dodging glances.
“The Notice to Accelerate was sent out at the beginning of the week,” she replied, mildly cowed by Dean’s outburst.
A gigantic smile shined as evidence of his instant relief.  “That’s all that I’m asking for.”
“I think I can make that happen if you ask real nice.”  He detangled their limbs even though he loathed to, but he had to go get changed out of this cumbersome costume.  A quick shower to scrub the sweat off couldn’t hurt either.
“Well, tonight we will have to make an exception.  Oh yeah – and bring Cas.  He’s gonna want to hear this, too.”
The angel in question carried their glasses over to opposite sides of the floor mounted metal table.  Hunger urged him to tilt his head for Dean to follow with their diligently prepped meal.
Sam stepped back directly into a free standing cabinet and crossed his arms over his chest with all the elegance of a middle school slow dance.  “If you’ve been in my head, you already know what I want.  Also, ask next time.  They say consent is sexy.” His ham-fisted attempt at flirting only spurred the wily archangel on.  And that’s what he wanted.  Right…?
Dean crossed his arms then unraveled them when he saw Cas pull the plate away further.  “Okay, so you’re a shiny new top of the line mash lauter tun.  You take in malt and water and spit out hot wort, the first step reminiscent of the final product.  Sure Balthazar is a massive fermenter and that lady Naomi is probably just a gigantic bright tank, but when people think of brewing, what’s the most iconic piece in brewing line?”
He bit the inside of his bottom lip and nodded weakly.  “Fine, but just one.”
Dean’s leg bounced up and down at a staccato pace but he clamped his fist over his mouth once more deferring to his brother’s tactical nature.
The crinkle of irreversibly creased paper made for an odd off tempo compliment to Seventies Hobbit rock, but he gave Cas all the time he desired to read and re-read the tattered edged pages on the drive back home nonetheless.  The uniform penmanship Dean caught snippets of matched the impressions Cas had given him of Balthazar, but whatever information was imparted in its lines left Cas speechless, retreating back to fill in the gaps of each line between long stares at passing roadside vegetation.
“It’s gotta be a movie that sounds like it was made on a dare like ‘Zombeavers’ or ‘Naked Brain Surgeons’.”
“What are you talking about?”
“I have my fair share of burns from working on engines and gnarly cuts from construction jobs.  You probably saw the big one on my shoulder before.  It’s from my first construction gig.  At five a.m. Bobby drove clear across the county to drop me off only to have to drive back a few hours later to lug my ass to the hospital.  Never tried to get that friendly with unfamiliar machinery again, but…” he stalled out pivoting clumsily.  “Even that one isn’t really as big as even one of yours.”  Timidly, he circled just outside of the off colored long since healed abrasions on either side of his wrists then brought his knuckles closer to drop modest kisses on his knuckles.
Three meals passed without his appetite picking up the slack of his absent grace.  Usually without it to sustain him, he would be ravenous the first few days.  A stubborn malaise trapped him inside his damaged body so tightly he hardly stood up with the help of the nurses to empty his bladder, the most trying taskmaster of the body in his opinion.  The doctor became stern with his lack of appetite, threatening to force a feeding tube into him, he guessed from her crude hand gestures, when a sight for sore eyes shuffled into the room: the taller Winchester.
With a wide smile, he separated their quavering torsos even further and whispered, “Awesome, then be a good multidimensional being and stay right where you are.”
“You don’t have to, Cas.  Just, give him something or he’ll be on you like a fresh steak until you do.”
“Seemed relevant, but okay sassy pants.  What do you wanna talk about?”
“What’s this?” Sam asked unwinding the twine sealing the top closed.
Nevertheless, his questions hit home, pulled at the coattails of his absent family in a way he didn’t expect.  Try as he might, he couldn’t help but let the heartache that echoed throughout his chest show when he thought of his Dean, his Sam, or the life he had known.  But the sympathy, the genuine fidgeting concern he discovered in his green eyes yanked at every fiber of their bond just as his Dean had at various points in their shared history.
“Cas, I want you to listen very carefully,” he warned and sat up straighter.  Cas tried to pull away, to look him in the eyes, when Dean’s grip tightened.  He wasn’t sure if he could pull off his hail mary while looking him in the face.  “None of what happened was your fault.  I wanted to help you so I did.  I wanted to protect you so I did.  I wanted to love you so I did, and I’d do it over and over again.”  He felt Cas bury his face into his clavicle and hold his breath.  Loose droplets seeped into his shirt, so he rubbed his wrinkled breaths flat with his palms.  “You didn’t do me wrong, but if you need to hear me say it: I forgive you.  So, please forgive yourself.”
His small smile and nod in return was the proof Dean wasn’t sure he wanted.
“Being apathetic about these kinds of things in the past has brought me nothing but trouble,” he shrugged.
“If you make another pass at Jo, Ellen is gonna kill you and then me.  After all that flirting at that beer flight event last month, Jo strained that bar kid tolerance of hers agonizing over why you didn’t just ask her out.  Ellen still wants to run you over with her pick up for playing with her little girl’s heartstrings like that.”
Another alien moan escaped his lips as if his body spoke a language Cas invented just for them but he could only respond in with deflated breathy vowels.
‘(XXX) XXX-XXX_. –Jimmy.’
“Yeah, Cas.  Anything.”
The deep blue eyes rolled at him and he blinked the sleep out of the corners of his eyes.  Dean took the opportunity to quickly reclaim his navy jacket, which the stranger took half a moment to notice.  He crossed his arms over his chest and eyed the vulnerable mossy denim jacket at the foot of the bed, looking away just as quickly.
“He ran for the hills.”
“I would have enjoyed that a great deal more, if I’m being honest.  Bit too much pomp and circumstance for my taste,” he admitted.  His hands drifted over the folds of Dean’s button down chest pocket aimlessly.
The switch of annoyance to intrigue flipped in an instant.  If she didn’t want the Bureau to know why did she make the call at her desk?  More importantly, why did she pick the site of his last overindulgent work outing?  With the more alluring thoughts about his secret work affair all but forgotten, he left the airport with just enough time to slip into a booth in the back section of the restaurant by seven if the early evening traffic gods were merciful.
Throughout the breadth of his tale, Dean wished he had a photograph of Cas as such a young man.  Even though he could summon the crinkle of his pondering brow, awkward nervous smiles, and open mouthed awe in the midst of passionate throes, he couldn’t form his expression the second he first knew what love felt like with Ion no matter how he tried.  Part of him ached for Cas and Ion’s love affair cut short as we would for any dear confidante, but thousands of things would have probably drawn and quartered their naïve young love even if they had stayed in each other’s orbits.  The other part of him was thankful to their tragedy dulled by time and distance because it pulled them into each other’s gravity; and the raw power of that gravity knocked him off his axis in the best way.  In the days since the barbeque Cas’s subtle reciprocation of his feelings blossomed into a naked joy he basked in the presence of.
Several boxed and canned ingredients assembled on the kitchen island under Castiel’s careful watch.  Dean couldn’t say if being watched while cooking for two for the first time in a great while made him any more comfortable in his well-stocked but hardly utilized kitchen.  Pasta was simple enough and very forgiving if left to cook a little too long, but forced them to remain in the kitchen to stir every now and then or add ingredients to taste.  Castiel volunteered himself to help mix herbs and other spices into the sauce by stepping into Dean’s personal space purposefully.  Dean accepted by pushing the small jars closer to the sauce and gesturing into the pot just as silently.  For the past couple of weeks Dean let this stranger’s steady nature wash over him, almost recalibrating his definition of what it felt like to care for someone outside of work, as messy as those interactions ultimately were.  His eagerness to riffle through his pockets just for curiosity’s sake was mischievous for sure, but the man let himself be serenaded into sleep by old records.  These weren’t your textbook examples of mental illness in Dean’s experience.
Dean crossed his arms over his chest with a mock pout, “Aww, you don’t get to spend time with tall, tan, and limber over there?  Such a shame…”
“You mean spicing it up with chapters like you sent Sam and me?”
He hushed him carefully and pet the side of his face until his cracked voice box relented.  Guiding his breaths to a slower pace, Cas inhaled deliberately and exhaled his own hot breath down his shirt, making his chest flutter unexpectedly.  “He gave me everything he could: security, careful consideration at every turn, humor, a rich home life, and bottomless love.  But without my family, my friends, and the reckless, ornery, captivating, unflinching loyal you, I was not enough.”
He reclined back against the couch cushions and nodded.  “We’re starting in five with or without him.  But hey, if he doesn’t show we’ll see if you can pry me off of you before the first creepy synthesizer solo.”
Dean stabbed his pancake and introjected, “When I interviewed Kirk Blackbear, he said he couldn’t actually remember his parents setting a fire, just that he got out after a large explosion.  He might have just been filling in the details being he was severely burned.  It wouldn’t be the first time a witness’s story changed after a few years.  Memories can warp when people are under duress.”
Lead footed realization stomped holes into the imagined cookie cutter suburban life Cas detailed for him.  “So there were copies of Angels there: a Gabriel and a Balthazar to muck with that world.  I can imagine baby angels running amuck would cause a problem or two.  You think this FBI agent is up to the task?”
“No, it wasn’t…” he fought back.
When his secretive gaze wrapped around the edge of the door, it was as plain as day his fondest wishes for this best friends were heard.  The dark haired angel reclined at the head of a bare mattress laid on an ancient bed frame, pushed his rolled sleeves up, then showed Dean the track list of the LP they were listening to.  The telltale affection of his inordinately tender smile shone so brightly.  He thought for an instant it was some embodiment of his angelic influence on his brother, not simply a tender interaction only his brother could have coaxed out of him.  Dean laughed lightly at the angel recalling when he heard the singer’s music for the first time standing in front of an appliance store’s window as it played live on late night TV.  The album cover was flipped over again and their hands met, he assumed not entirely on accident.  Dean pulled him closer and placed teasing kisses on his cheek between light touches on his exposed forearms.  The open physical affinity between them pulled at his heartstrings so hard he wanted to jump into the air and shout.  Finally, finally all the pining and worrying and pointless manufactured fighting was over!  Then a snort found its way to his nostrils.  Who was he kidding?  Did he even know who he was talking about?  If they could find a way to fight about the chupacabra’s preferential cut of French fries, they would.  Crinkle, obviously.
This particular Friday night, nothing was going to keep Dean from enjoying a child free evening.  The instant his door was locked, he shed his monkey suit and shined up loafers.  Absent the oppressive layers, his skin tingled, ejecting the lines that his button down and slacks had imprinted onto his flesh.  His plush new mattress pulled him into its dead center; giving him enough space to prop up his head on his pillows and lay his laptop to his right.  His first inclination to doom scroll ‘safer’ internet sites as a small child could tornado in at any moment and sideline anything on his mind was thrust out his locked door and into the ether.  He had time, opportunity, and impulse to indulge in neglected needs.   The background buzz of whiskey spurred those ideas into the forefront of his mind.
The sun setting deeper into the horizon claimed his focus.  Loose concepts, painful sensations clouded their tether, but Dean waited patiently on his end.
Dean bit his lower lip and felt his cheeks instantly warm.  Changing the subject would at least divert his attention.
, his eyes flicked away from Cas’s a handful of times as if to gather the courage to hear the unwelcome answer.
She leaned over the front desk, lifting an eyebrow sky high.  “Give me a name before I pry it out of your brother,” she demanded.  Seeing no give there, she turned tact.  “Or what’s that cunning little minx’s name?  Charlie?”
The weary man studied his surroundings with a seemingly unnecessary amount of scrutiny. Wet soil seeped between his bare toes as he strengthened his stance, posed to strike at the most miniscule of offenses.  How were his feet so clean if he was traipsing around in recess of damp earth? The agent had various nefarious theories, but gaining trust was more important than proving himself right.  The tense gaze returned to scrutinize the agent further, still without a solitary peep.
Jo stood at the driver’s side door and placed a fist at her hip.  “Look at blue eyes, here.   You just for show or ‘re you gonna help him with the heavy lifting?”
Formulating a plan to get Cas back to his mojo’s equilibrium as soon as possible, he launched into its preliminary steps.  “How about after you finish, you take a long hot shower?  I gave the bathroom a pretty thorough scrub last week, so those shiny showerheads have guaranteed grade A water pressure.”
They drifted off towards the loading dock where the delivery van idled stocked with kegs of their most popular ales, promotional materials, brewery logo printed giveaways, and a couple of newly printed vinyl signs to hang from their booth.  Their newly minted Salvage partner hit the ground running setting them up for regional expansion.  They had several brew fests on the calendar, a new package of marketing for all the local bars, and mock ups for liquor store end stands for their staple beers.  All that was just the ramp up to the real trial: scaling up brewing with new equipment if they could stretch their pennies that far.  With all three of them putting their heads together, he knew they had a shot at the end of the quarter.  The challenge was invigorating, but mostly because he was surrounded by a dedicated team just as eager to see the brewery succeed as he was.
“You’ve been too generous already…”  He stood up and waved his hands between them.  “You’ve given her so much… given
Eyeing his whiskey, he combed over their conversations concerning his latest manuscript and he licked his lips.
He could hear Cas respond in some fashion, but he darted off so quickly the meaning of the sounds was lost.  Once behind the sanctuary of his closed door, he stripped off his overly comfortable house clothes and scrambled to pull his not too casual date night clothes on.  Once he smoothed out his hair and looked himself over in the mirror above the sink, he felt more even keel.  Sure, he looked a little tired, but he agonized over the events of the evening every day since the barbeque.  A splash of water on the face would have to be enough to wake him out of his planning mindset and into the here and now.  After all, this could be his only shot to convince Cas to take a risk on him now that there was not financial obligation to smear his perceived intentions.
He leaned over to hear her. “Yeah?”
Sunlight warmed his face out of a much needed restful nap a couple of hours later.  His fractured bones felt too inert and although he knew stretching would hazard more pain than it was worth, he played the odds.  His left arm reached out into the sunlight, warmth gathering some dewy sweat on his palm.  He pulled his right arm up but was stopped inches from where it started and kept from seeking the relief of a good stretch.  That asshat copy of Sam had handcuffed him to the bed.  The cuff’s rattling against the plastic molded rail drew Sam’s self-satisfied smirk from behind his screen.  Castiel ran his tongue over his top teeth unamused.  Sam all but ignored him and spouted off some configuration of words that included a new word: resist.  Although he was irked at his new wholly unnecessary restraints, he was encouraged by his new two word vocabulary.   As the afternoon passed, he listened more intently to the nurses passing by his open door for more words and concepts he could cobble together into more usable language.  The agent’s unabashed mistrust of him forced him to take phone calls right in front of his charge, not bothering to care if he knew how ticked he remained over his previous overstep.
Minding his footwork past the large grate in the floor, he spotted Garth’s bright yellow rain boots.  Once they caught his eye, it appeared everyone was wearing them accept for him.  Before he had the chance to ask if he should invest in a pair, Garth continued on, “If tasking gets thin on Thursdays, we cut out early.  As you know these beauties are send out into the wild on Fridays, so there’s little to do other than clean and prep.  When we brew seasonals, it can take up a whole weekend for just one batch depending on what Benny has in mind.  The most recent attempt at a seasonal was dead on arrival mainly because of a vendor’s mistake, so everyone’s minding their p’s and q’s for next weekend when we begin the kickoff batch.”
He nodded, but his focus darted off once again.  “She knew Arthur didn’t just slink off into hiding after the raid.  They made finding him their top priority.  Sam, I think they made him.  There’s no reason to think they will keep me alive even if they return him to the fold.  I’m an inconsequential loose end.”
“I appreciate that, Sam.  How would you break this kind of news to your partner?”
“Ugh, when we look for black holes, we look for what’s missing in the darkness.   What DON’T you see, D?” she typed quickly.
“I fear humanity’s wrath more than the abstract rage of god’s second born, possibly even more than god himself.  But that’s the why.”
“How long were you in that other place?” He kept a distance from him, sensing his unease.
The idea sloshed around his mind and more bright green foreign characters seeped out of his ears
“Oh, that’s nothing,” Sam smiled.  “You should have seen what Dean and I did to each other one Halloween.  The house at the end of the block was giving out full sized candy bars and we fought over a Butterfinger so hard our dad thought someone had beat us up and mugged us.”
Sam and Dean brought Claire to the family little diner in Lebanon that served her favorite pie a la mode, even ordering her a slice all to herself.  The rare treat made her eyes glisten as she lapped up the soupy mix of sweet cinnamon apple and dripping vanilla ice cream.  By the end of the meal both of them had butterflies in their intestines fretting over how spectacular a tantrum she would throw when they crossed the threshold into the bunker.  Although Dean reminded her they were moving all week, the differences between their old home and the new one would be more startling to the child.  On top of the new sights and smells, she had just made the same maneuver months prior.  This time, there would be no yard to play in, no fence to bang on with sticks, no butterflies to chase.  On the bright side she would have a tub so big it would serve as her personal swing pool, waffles every Sunday morning courtesy of their industrial waffle iron, a library shelf decked with all of the picture books they could gather from the second hand store in town, and a brightly painted room to call her own.  He crossed his fingers it would be the key to his success especially since it greatly outshined the makeshift bedroom he threw together for her on their visits the comfort the ailing Bobby.  Sprucing it up for a seven year old’s liking never made in onto his to do list between everything else.  One full Saturday was spent channeling all his overworked nerves into obsessing over every inch of her new sanctuary.  Only once he stood back and admired his work did the vibrating din of self-deprecating thoughts resolve.
Carefully creeping over to Cas’s side, he caught the scribbles and sketches half hidden underneath the angel’s hand.  A surreal drawing of an angry looking dog surrounded by smoke and light spots covered half of the page.  He could make out some boxy looking foreign letters, but no notes in a language he could read.  He could glean half of what looked like a bug zapper with fluff on the side beside the demon dog, but couldn’t figure out how they were related.  He looked up the dimmed laptop screen and ran a finger over the mousepad to wake the screen back up, hoping the information on it was in English.  Luckily, there was enough English on the page for him to suss out what the drained angel had discovered.  With slow, deliberate movements, he squatted beside him and avoided waking Cas as he scrolled through the pages of folkloric creatures with names like Okikumushi and Maikubi.  Whatever this being was, it wasn’t from Kansas.  Progress was progress and his friend had them pointed in an entirely different direction.
Sam closed the door and stood tall beside it.  “He’s unharmed just overwhelmed, I think.”
“But that one angel wasn’t normal for one hundred years right?  We’ll be long gone by then.”
A mahogany laugh bellowed out of Dean.  “Yeah, well, not as old as you.”  Splayed out fingers pressed Cas into another firm embrace.  “This is the most awesome, most extravagant thing you could have done for me, but there’s no way our first time wasn’t going to be the best first ever; not better than my first kiss, first time riding in Baby, first time hearing Zepplin, nothing.  You’re the best first for me, Cas. ” His lament was solidified by a long kiss on his bare neck.
Dean’s eyes widened and Cas scooted forward and drew him in between his legs.  The Angel shepherded him into a lazy embrace yet pulled their torsos together so their every inch barely met.  “Agreed,” he breathed into his ear.
Cas returned a pensive stare and stroked his chin, distracting the agent with the brush of a forefinger across his bottom lip.
The hunter inched his left hand towards Cas’s on the railing but laid it to rest an pinky’s reach away.  He craned his neck upwards to find the star that captured Cas’s seemingly unshakable attention.  The sun had long since set and the stars twinkled brightly in every direction.  If it wasn’t for the chill, it would have been a downright romantic view.  If this billowing uneasiness wasn’t plaguing his love, there would have been the possibility of it still heading in that direction.  Over the years, they came to know each other in the silence between thoughts.  Cast off glances and abandoned stares steered their ships into each other’s paths, but their poorly timed or ill-considered thoughts careened them in opposite directions of the globe.  Behind his ribs, he sensed the silence driving them apart again.
“Fine, I told them we were friends.  Senegal,” he waved off his concern.
“I know what you’re doing, Sammy,” he muttered.
Dean rolled his eyes but turned halfway back towards him.  “Hn?”
He walked closer step by step, monitoring for the same unease the proximity to Dean pressed into him.  Bewildered, he found none.  He walked right up to him and wrapped his long arms around him hugging tightly.  “Where the hell were you, Cas?”
“What?” Davies asked acutely aghast.  “Is that what the incident report said?”
“I don’t know.  I feel like there was another time someone referenced the bunker, too.  Ah, well, couldn’t have been too opaque or I would have remembered it more clearly.”
He harrumphed dismissively.  “I don’t stare at him like that.”
Cas appeared to slowly sway on his bent knees forward and back a little bit, almost as if his movements clinked the segments of glass together.  Sam could almost hear movement.  After a few moments, Cas lifted his head slightly, canted towards his tall friend and said, “Eventually he will tire of his private hunts.  Time will shred his beautiful form and experiences on this plane will ravage his mind.  He will become unable then unwilling to sacrifice so much for this world.  As always his iridescently glowing soul will shine brighter than any other I’ve held in my hands. The distractions will fall from his view and I will still be there right beside him - beside you both – whenever and always.  If it takes until his dying day, I will watch, wait, and breathe in any of his affection.  His mind and body may deteriorate and decay and I will not care for him any less.”
============================================
“Come on, Dean.  Giving him the silent treatment back is only going to delay the inevitable.”
“NO!” he desperately yelled back.  Even with his eyes closed, he could make out the sources of light growing brighter than any star he could have imagined hanging low in the night sky.  “That’s not how we handle things!”  He reached out with his free hand and desperately crawled at their tether.
“How did you prove you were an Angel without your Grace?”  He relaxed his elbows and hunched slightly forward.
“No, no,” he snatched up his scruffy chin and smoothed out the fear taking hold.  “You’re amazing.  Climb down and follow me,” he said.
He smiled serenely at him and shook his head.
The cynical squint he was giving him didn’t lessen any even after waxing poetic about what was clearly the soundtrack to his first real heartbreak.  “You’ll just have to listen to it.”
His hands were noticeably colder than expected, which was probably due to the low temperate in the room or he simply had bad circulation.  His fingernails were even and cut short like he worked with his hands not soft like they would be at an idle nine-to-five desk job.  The color of his skin did not stop at the wrist like your average white collar.  Logic dictated he could just as easily have been a weekend gardener.  There were no thick knuckle, finger pad, or upper palm calluses like a tradesman or athlete would have built up from repetitive movements.  His fingers and palms bore markings of work, creased and worn in like leather driving glove.  While his trade was unknown, these hands showed proof of studious rigor.  He flipped his hands palm down and saw no tan lines from jewelry like a watch or wedding band.  Further up his arms there were no sunspots, freckles, scarring, bumps or bruises; only toned muscle.  This muscle to fat ratio took consistent effort though; like he was a hobby runner or he engaged strictly in cardio workouts that did not involve equipment like weights or rowing.  Toiling through if’s and maybe’s showed clearly on his face as the stranger stared deeply into his eyes, attempting to drag his thoughts out of them with failing efforts.  The draw to stare back into those cooling pools was mighty, but it was a luxury he should not delve into while on the job.  Ignoring them would be demanding nevertheless.  Through the hospital gown he couldn’t make much else out other than what his already saw in his casual clothes; a healthy slim build, around six feet tall, able bodied, hygienic, haplessly styled, and otherwise appeared stable.  What was he missing?  Military personnel had varying identifiers depending on country of origin, department, and discipline, but he didn’t come across as military let alone a military pilot.  What about the tattoo, though?  Was it service related?
The hunter followed the dimming gaze of the angel’s eyes with an inquisitive squint.  Sam was still in his bed, deep inside the bunker away from most harm that could be warded out.  Why would he have to worry about Sam especially right now when they were just investigating each other’s tonsils with curious tongues…
“Card carrying.  The only reason he checked into the sanitarium in Maryland after his first major episode was at the urging of his parish priest.”
In that instant he understood,
“As sure as Benny needs an interpreter once he’s had a few,” he chortled.  “No pressure.”
“Sure,” he said sarcastically leaning over to toss the bat under his bed.  Who knew when a late night visit would necessitate a low level melee weapon again?
“Of you, of Sam, of Claire, of everyone!”  His cramped expression darkened the clear skies of Cas’s eyes into the near pitch black of a thick storm over churning seas.
Dean leaned over his elbows on the desk.  A misshapen pebble gathered layers of anxiousness in his belly as his firm tone commandeered the discussion.
Cas wrestles with the idea of each Dean then both at once.
With their shields gone, the men finally dared to look at each other, their tongues still while their hearts raced.  Dean’s wondrous touch traveled up his back, over his shoulder, and down his arm, tracing every step with an equally hungry gaze.  A blaze as hot as the backyard inferno seared along those same stretches of skin even through his layers.  Ultimately, intertwining their fingers was his goal.  Gingerly, he pulled his knuckles up to his pink lips, with a grip light enough to pull away from.  His lovely eyelashes fell onto his rosy cheeks.  For the first time Castiel noticed how freckles scattered across them like constellations in the bare sky above.  He tried to swallow the knot climbing up his throat when those lashes parted again.  Flecks of light escaping upwards from the fire a short distance away reflected in his irises.  How could a man such as this have crossed into his infinitesimally small orbit let alone have crash landed on his planet?
“Killjoy,” he mumbled and submerged into another labyrinth of kisses.
“Are we procuring tires for Baby in Tulsa?” he asked with some trepidation.  He hopped up onto the car far enough to let his feet dangle over the edge.
“You think I could deny her anything?” his buttery soft tone signifying their little talk had gone well on his end as well.
“You didn’t know there’s a bunker was in Kansas,” he realized out loud, filling the dry air with a dank heaviness.
“Any other details?”  She began typing away soundlessly on the digital keyboard.
Her small mouth heaved out a loadbearing yawn.  “He gave me apple slices.  We played with the funny dog.”
The skin over his chest seemed to thin, letting them peer at his lightly glowing heart pounding excitedly under the threat of his imminent touch.  “Whhoah, Cas.  Tell me that was you at least.”
“Exactly.  While you may not be the sole focus of your Malkuth book, the reader will identify most with you, thus react strongly to the insidious culture of the Malkuth because they grow to care about you.  I mean, think about why you sent me that chapter in the first place: you wanted me to understand how far the Family’s talons were sunk into you and how much it hurt to have them ripped away because of who you are.  Their loss, by the way.”
“It’s not possible.  There’s no such thing.  Angels are just fictional side characters thought up to make God seem like less of an angry, controlling asshole; like conscience fluffers for the morally impaired.”
“Don’t strain yourself.”
“Don’t.You.Dare,” he laid down the law gaining on her shorter strides.
“Get Davies out of here!” he ordered Sam.
Sam smiled proudly at him.  He pushed himself away from the table and opened his arms as if to pull him in.
“If she wakes up, just tell her I’ll be right back as soon as I can.  I’ll call if I need you.”
Amusement was far from his list of accessible reactions to Claire’s soapy antics.  “You gonna keep gawkin’ or are you gonna grab us a towel?”  He finally braced an arm around her middle.  With it a tidal wave of bathwater cascaded over every dry fiber of clothing he had left.
He shook his head and craned his neck back to extract every last speck from his glass.  “The first time I met Charlie was at an independently owned bookstore; in the self-help section of all places.  To be more specific, I was searching for a book my editor recommended about recovery through the lens of an addict and Charlie was in the romance section nearby.  She sighed rather heavily when the selection of lesbian erotica was very limited.  I asked her what she was looking for and we bonded instantly.  It was right there between those tall bookshelves I heard about the Bradbury’s narrow parameters for acceptable adolescent behavior.  If I remember correctly she said ‘it was a narrow as her mother’s vagina’.”
“He and I could communicate in a similar way to how I did with both of you using my Grace and something else, but it was unhampered by mistrust or fear.  The new permeations, the fresh growth of my augmented Grace allowed for our bond to establish such a link.  As powerful and altering as it was, it was not in my power to blink into another world no matter how malleable my Grace became.  In that link, he showed me he felt it as strongly as I did,” he admitted.
“I believe so.  He shot Davies, but not mortally.  I would have healed him, but didn’t have enough Grace to heal him, the agent, and return.  His boyfriend was there when it happened.  I am confident he handled it efficiently.”
Although it was a quick touch, he couldn’t help cover the point of contact with his palm.  A pleasant zing sprinted up his leg and into his chest.
Helplessness clawed at his ribs where hopeful relief should have rested in solitude.  He clenched and released his fists trying to quell the anxious irritation.  With a spotless kitchen, bathroom, and library, he searched for something to tidy up while biding time.  His booted feet dragged him back to their room.  Even during their separation it never stopped being their room.  Sure, Cas had his spartan room close by, but after the raijyuu incident, they rarely spent the nights apart.  Their bed was still neatly made from the morning with the extra blanket folded in quarters at its foot.  Without the extra heat trapped under the blanket, he resorted to extra blankets to warm his feet.  He toyed with returning it to the footlocker, but settled on tossing out old food containers and stacking the scattered notes on his desk.  Sam had coerced him into eating on a few occasions by bringing him take out, often punctuated by small tins containing sweet pie slices.  After the nearly botched hunt in Arkansas, regular meals were a luxury.  He doubled down on examining the lore, as useless as it ended up being.
“She sounds like a peach,” Dean quipped.
“Ah, but Sammie-long-legs,” he draped an arm around his back with a flourish.  The saccharine grin faded slowly and a sincere smirk took its place.  Neither expression looked foreign on his face, even up close.  “I don’t know where Cas is.  If God’s not reaching into whatever world he landed in, I can’t take a peek either.  I can, however, suck you down like my favorite lollipop.”
============================================
Dean looked as if he’d taken a less severe kidney punch.
he mused.
Cas’s head bobbled in his peripheral vision as he chuckled against his ribs.  “You were pretty quiet on the way there.  Wondered if I was making you nervous.  Good to know you were just making sure Mother Nature minded her p’s and q’s.”
Dean’s breath caught for an extra second in his chest and he smiled back.  “You feeling any better today?”
Cas sported a chiseled frown with crossed arms, giving Dean the silent treatment as he vibrated with laughter in return.
“I don’t even know where to start,” he lamented.  Fiddling with the hem of the jacket didn’t clarify matters.  “What if… what if he prefers him over me?  What if this just makes him feel worse?”
Cas rubbed his cheek into the inside of Dean’s upturned knee so much like a housecat obstinately demanding affection no matter what its human thought was more important at the time.  “Patience,” he growled and slipped his pinky inside to prove his point.
He shook his head and shoved his hands into linen house pants Dean craved to pull him closer by.  He briefly envisioned how they would look pooled on the linoleum beneath his bare wiggling toes.
(See the end of the chapter for
“She was,” he flashed an unreserved smile.  “Make sure to come visit us again.”
He was immediately silenced by a hand rising to stop the unwanted explanation.  “I need you both to get out.”
Dean scooted closer and spat, “I could come with you, assuming it’s not the Lebanon across the ocean…” He imagined travelling that far with Cas, watching him converse in yet another language. He would fight the jelly his bones would become listening to the confident foreign tones cascading off of that familiar palate.  New smells and textures would surround them; new sensations bound to every surface, forcing him stand even closer to the angel out of fear of bumping into strangers.  They might react to his slight in unintelligible phrases and Cas could carve out a humble apology with his brilliant reassuring smile.
=====================
“Fair point.  Oh crap, I can’t remember if we gave Jo the right security code for the door.”  He pulled out his phone to check their messages.
Like innumerable moments before, it was in that moment Cas decided he really liked this version of Dean.  Like his Dean he was molded in the clay of his reality, but innately gruff and critical of the food placed freely on his plate.  Every truth came with a price, yet truth in some variety was always there if he dug down far enough.  While his Dean was willing to pay whatever price to keep people out of harm’s way, this Dean wasn’t aware that his actions would cost him, not really.  This Dean only had one life, one soul, one chance but was far less eager to toss in his chips if there was a smarter way.  Maybe he saw two moves ahead more often; had more training and resources to create contingency plans with.
Both agents looked in his general direction in a shared professionally practiced monitoring silence.  The dull hum of the needle floating on the record heralded the continuation of their chat.
“That world had its own complications, its own threats.  For the most part, this man guarded me from all of it until facing up to it was unavoidable.  He spoiled me, bolstered me when my resolve waned, cared for me tenderly,” he almost hushed himself, daring the confession into being.  His palm ran over his chest absently.
“Sure, Dean.  Whatever you say,” he monotoned and slammed the back doors shut.  “Need help loading up the truck?”
It took a few words for his tone to return to less turbulent depths.  “Angels are not so flexible.  To change our minds, bend our hearts, it tears at our Grace.  Our mission, our purpose is so integral to our being that willing it to change forces us to rejoin these tattered segments into different configurations.  When other angels see my Grace, they see its unnatural curves and jagged edges where I question God’s plan, the uneven knots where my doubts have devoured that once perfect globe of conscienceless fortitude.  They don’t see their reflections in it anymore.  Yes Dean, you have changed me in every measure big and small on display for the world to see, but these changes are not so different than the changes you endure as a human in love.”
“Any of our coffee cakes catch your eye?  I am partial to the crumble topped cinnamon cake myself,” he pitched smoothly over the plate of Dean’s growing stomach.
Sure there were endless questions he had about Dean’s past, his lovers, his friends, his struggles, but this was still the first date.  Granted they were physically becoming more attuned to each other where he was most comfortable, but there were limits to Dean’s current benevolent nature. “Let’s say we get Salvage back on her feet, working again at full capacity, and achieve all the goals we set for ourselves and an interested party present a very attractive offer to sell.  You could live off of your handsome share and she would be in good hands.  What would you do with your time?”
Dean stepped back to soak in even available inch of his exposed skin but was firmly barricaded by the top button of his pants.  Cas nodded cheerfully and let Dean take the lead in stripping the last barriers to his enthusiastically painted bare flesh.  He walked behind him and put both palms against his hips inside his pants to guide down the offending garments while caressing the sides of his legs all the way to the ground.  The long glide of skin on skin sent a rush of spectacular thrill back up his core.  The determined greens studied every feather and leaf and insect inked down his sides and across his back, framing his masculine curves masterfully.  Cas felt a labored sigh against the flushed skin of his back.
“Nah, we’ve got it covered.  You three get out of here or you’ll hit evening traffic outside the city.”
“There was no magic there, nothing supernatural anyway.  At least until I touched the amulet, then I could feel Angels appearing all over the globe.  Hundreds, maybe thousands just sprang into being.  That’s why I couldn’t leave the moment I regained my Grace.  I had to tell him to look out for them and to find the other one.”  This admission stole the wind from Cas’s sails, like he was tensing for a low blow.
“I see you found the latest and greatest of the Winchester family tech. Listen to any gems?”
“So what?” Sam spoke up.  “Even if he told her you were inaccessible, she would have sent someone to find you.  You had dirt on her.  You were part of her ‘family’.  You beat and kidnapped and killed in her name, with her blessing!”
“You remember last fall the head of Biggerson’s had that law suit brought against them for discriminatory hiring practices?  The CEO ended up resigning but there was no legal action brought against them.”
“Cas, were you in love with him?” he asked, unsure of how betrayed it came across.
A conciliatory smirk brushed over Cas’s face, “Pizza, yes.  Lots of beer, no.  I need your minds clear and focused but your bodies still.  The unfortunate side effects of a hangover will not be helpful come tomorrow.”
His hands raised around his head to guard his reactionary thoughts from bursting forth.  While he paced in a large circle around the library, Dean seethed in place, his eyes never leaving his brother’s center mass.  The intrepid way his brother’s focus could be so solitary and so far off unnerved Sam. Different versions of this conversation trotted through his head with percussive pounding.  In various hotel rooms during countless jobs, he thought Dean’s emotional blockage would have enough force behind it to confront Cas’s longing stares with anger or embarrassment or questioning or any emotion really.  He would just have to give them the room one more time, find a cute waitress to flirt with until closing time - then merely give her a polite ride home - spend just enough time away to give them space.  After each attempt failed, he resolved to just grab his brother’s head and force him to stare into Cas’s steely blues and tell them to just kiss already, hold hands, just not look away once it finally sunk it that they were already bonded profoundly. Why not admit the easy part – they care about each other in a romantic way as well?  Being maneuvered by Dean into confessing his frustration with them made his whole body violently contract in a way no amount of Bikram yoga would fix.  What had Jody said last time they spoke?  Ah, “I” statements.  In the eighth attempt to push his hair behind his ear today, he let his hands drop to his sides and return his gaze to his silent counterpart. “I love you, Dean. You’re my brother and as my family I expect you to be transparent with me on the big, important, and undeniable things. Yes, I know when you drink the last beer but lie terribly about me drinking it and forgetting.  We have lied to each other in the past, thinking we knew what’s best for each other just like the angel in question.  Historically speaking, no Dean, we are not any better decision makers than Cas, but as family we ask for each other’s input and help.  I hope you expect the same from me.”
The agent followed, pulling out his phone to see who almost got him stabbed.  Though he knew those kids hadn’t made him as an agent looking in on their boss, he was certain it wasn’t beyond the realm of possibilities he wouldn’t be stabbed. He was a tad too invested a spur of the moment ball game within feet of their coke dispenser’s established itchy get-em-boys finger.  Being in his good graces meant more blow, and he had seen desperate people do far worse for a lot less.
The pit of Dean’s stomach fell hearing his robotic recollections float into the air.  Cas’s eyes volleyed from different points in space around his head, but never rest on Dean’s face, too uneasy to land safely.  He traced the outline of the bottle with his darkening ocean blue irises which Dean took as an invitation to pour the last dregs of the bottle in the glasses and brace for new revelations about his friend.
“Open it,” he urged him with a leading smile.
anything, yet,” he took up his ballpoint again and drew invisible shapes on the surface of the table with the retracted end.
Several bits of gravel bounced off of his shoes as his feet crawled tenuously towards him.  “How are you feeling?”  He perched on the railing a few inches from Cas to test how bothered he would be by it.
Their fearless leader joined them around two filling and sealing up boxes.  A static quality bounced around the air whenever Dean was around.  Hoping his sparse conversation was the product of a busy mind, Castiel didn’t push him into vacant conversation just for the sake of easing tension.  Once the rest of the team had left for the day, he noticed Dean dodging his inquisitive glances, the buzzing around them escalated to an uncomfortable hum just below his skin.  Once their Friday haul was stocked up on the pallet directly in front of the small docking bay door, he made the effort to sooth the sensation with a whitelisted work topic.  “Seeing as Thursdays are short days for everyone else, what do you get up to after they leave?”
“Sam I – I told them everything straight away.  There was no point in holding out.  I was fucked either way.”
Cas broke his chips into thirds and took small digs of the guacamole, thinking fiercely about something in the distance between them.
That same focus drew up to his face, still fidgeting with the empty packaging.  The broken stone and pulverized detritus underfoot crunched as he pivoted his weight from one foot to another.  He tossed the packaging into the same coffee can, exposing a small tattoo of a wing on his inner bicep. He caught Dean spying on him and crossed his arms.
He slammed the door to the frigid one car garage and took up residence next to the slightly shorter man staring indecisively into the panty.
They both groaned in aggravation as they parted.  Cas kept both hands on him as he retracted from his hold, unwilling to relinquish his claim for even a moment.
“Thank you.  Pleasantries aside, you look like you’ve had quite the day.  Did that last minute errand make it better or worse?”  He chowed down, but kept a keen eye on Sam.
The stern grimace thrown in his direction thinned as he walked around them, a low murmur about repairing something trailing in his wake.
“So what’s this favor, D?”  She clung to the tablet to her chest, clearly holding in the myriad of questions oozing from her ears.
“Wait, you think he dropped out of the outer atmosphere and plummeted to earth in a military safety vest and miraculously didn’t end up squished like a bug when he touched down?”
Garth caught his lingering look from the corner of his eye.  Castiel stilled as he cautiously approached as he placed boxes folded into usable vessels in stacks taller than both of them against the far wall.  He was unsure as to what expression he was sporting when he ensnared Garth’s curiosity.
“You’re such a dork,” he smiled widely, straining his neck sideways to see him click his tongue in response.
“Family may begin with similar genetics, but it stretches beyond that to bring the ones you care about in.  It’s taking someone in so far you can’t see your life without them, like their heart beats in your chest through the good and the bad.  Tell me you don’t feel that when you think of him.”
He withdrew and plummeted back in achingly slowly.  Dean’s impatience crystalized a few strokes in, driving him in faster by he digging a heel into his flank.  “Oh fuck, Cas.  So fuckin’ full of you.  More, I need…”
One eyebrow shot up the ceiling fighting his hard squint.  “You certainly have a way of re-framing terrible situations in the absolute best light.  Not that I deserve all that praise, but I appreciate the sentiment.”
The ‘tasty treat’ was an ice cold beer out of their newly restored industrial sized fridge.  Its behemoth storage capacity made him wonder how many people could reside there at maximum occupancy.  He filed it under yet another unknowable he had about their new home’s history.  They took a few swigs, recounting all the headway they made that week like the most informal of business meetings that degraded into an elementary back and forth over the best bar finger foods.  Eventually Sam veered the topic back to something that had been bugging him for days.  “With us having to purchase the other half of Columbus for this quarter and fronting the Mills the money to buy the Comet, I think we should take Charlie up on her offer.”
He nodded.
“So you ran from the bright lights of urban life to chase down the Malkuth.  How far are you through the book?”  His attempt to redirect the conversation was a bit clumsy, but the cold look in his friend’s face had to be ousted.
Dean took the album from him and flipped to back cover to read the track list.  “Oh is this the one with all the fantasy story references?  Not knocking it, but their stuff was more of my father’s speed.”
Finally giving himself over to the bear hug, he let his chin rest on Dean’s lightly swaying shoulder like a sturdy hammock.  “Finnne,” he groused into his aged cotton tee actively bristling.  Dean’s buoyant laugh suffused Cas from head to toe like a tingling salve.
Sam ties Dean and Cas to the train tracks.
“These are Bobby Singer’s boys, bless his soul.  Boys, this is the love of my life, Jody.”
The expressions on his face would fail him the moment he saw him, because Sam knew.  He didn’t notice the doors open to his floor until a familiar agent pushed her way past him.  Schooling the normally pleasant greetings he always gave into clipped mono syllabic words would be step one.  Mapping out step two careened to a halt as a shorter blonde agent matched his walking direction and speed.  “Oh, hi there, Dean-O.”
“No, no,” he tilted his head to the side a bit, finding the right sentiment somewhere in Davies’ tasteful wallpaper.  “Not physically.  You were pretty out of it, but at Theta…” Paranoia zipped up his spine as he looked around not sure what sign of otherworldly life he was looking for.  “Someone showed up and helped subdue Ketch.”
A chipper voice piped up into the air the second he put them on speakerphone.  “Hey, Dean.  Haven’t spoken to you since Garth’s birthday at the Ellen’s.  How are you doing?”
“Yeah, I’m right outside,” he tried to squeeze his grumble into a cordial smile.
The needle found its groove again, leaving him with only a lazy bouncing melody.
“But, Dean,” he attempted to stop him.  “Do you think Bobby knew about this place?”
“Hippie communes make for light reading,” he clarified.
He tucked the bag of mediocre Chinese takeout and midrange bottle of whiskey under his arm so he could knock on the familiar oak door.  The distance between him and doorway seemed like an open unending desert.  Still he stood back as far as he could with his heels backed in the lawn.  Who knew how paranoid or challenged he would be by re-acclimating to civilian life.  Last thing he needed was to crowd him even if it was the first thing Sam wanted to do.
The surly maid who answered the door stood beside the car and rolled her wrist in a circle.  He lowered the window on her side.  The moment there was enough clearance; she shoved an envelope through the slot and dashed back to the house and out of the downpour.  He picked up the bleach white envelope to read the words sprawled across its face.  The compound’s address was listed at the top left with a virgin stamp affixed across it to the right.  In the bottom right, his own name was written with the address portion blank.  He knew the handwriting. The edges looked worn and thin, as if the letter had been moved from pocket to pocket like a wartime correspondence.  His heart pounded erratically, drumming louder than the rain dive bombing his car.  With the window rolled back up, he could see her towering form in the window above.  Restlessness slithered around his intestines. Although he was road weary from the trip in, the only thing he wanted in that moment was to have that place in the rearview mirror.  He backed his sensible sedan out of the driveway and into the road.
The overly cautious nod hinted at a story he couldn’t wait to hear.
“Belarus it is then.  I landed in Minsk shortly after I was let out of custody on a technicality but you haven’t heard from me since.  I had to ditch my phone in the States.”
He pulled on his beer silently, tearing Sam a new one with his glassy stare, but at least stayed quiet enough to listen as he gamed it out.  It was improvement from the previous week’s attempt.
Cas agreed and crawled out of bed to recover his clothes.  As the diameter of the link shrunk Dean spied the young man he met at the diner in the back seat of his car through it.  The blonde’s quaffed hair wavered in the wind streaming past the rolled down window and he smiled vacantly at the passing landscape.  An immense swell of pride wafted from the image, but their shrinking bond pinched his view hole shut.
“Oh, Naomi,” he mimicked her dismissive tone.  “Don’t tell me the den of your archrivals was only a few hours away this whole time and you were oblivious.”
“Hello, Dean,” he said warmly.
“What do you think?”
“When that second witch caught us with our proverbial pants down, she stopped us from finishing the spell to trap Cathryn’s familiar correctly.  Maybe we sent it somewhere else. What if we sent it into someone else?”
“Huh, I thought this room was full of the Men of Letters’ personal journals,” Sam stood behind Dean holding a cellphone up with the flashlight function on.  “Did you move them?”
Dean scraped the wooden chair legs across the floor to sit back down, but a light noise condensed in the background amongst various everyday bunker hums.  He pushed the chair back to position and turned his head slowly from side to side in an effort to isolate the noise.
“Did the honey go bad or something?” he asked eyeing the squeeze bottle.
A loud embarrassed groan drifted from the head perched on the table.  “This is the worst.  If I wig out I could get myself dead and Cas zapped.  I can’t control how freaked I get around him sometimes.”
He shook his head.  “Not with Counter Intel.  That ship has ran aground and taken the docks with it.  I’ve been reassigned.”
He grunted weakly.
“It was lovely to meet you both.  Have a good evening, Sam.”  He drew Sam into a brief handshake upon their parting.  That cool palm then landed in Dean’s outstretched hand.  His gravel logged tone lowered a half step, “Dean.”  A lingering gaze bounced back and forth between them.
“You are not a small rodent, Dean.  If you were and I was your keeper, rest assured, I would give you all the sunflower seeds you want,” he said through a grin.  He adjusted to sit up beside Dean’s lower torso with crossed legs.
“Well it’s good you had support, right?”
Dust particulates drifted in front of the flashlight’s beam.  Other than watching his feet descend from one intricately designed stair to the next, he could see little else.  Echoes from his steps bounced from wall to ceiling and across a larger room.  The outer wall to his right bowed into his path so he followed it with his right hand tucking the knife away once he was confident the only noises he heard came from the floor above or his own clodhoppers.  A thickly padded metal chair came into view to his left, then a table long enough to fit the ten people.  It was cold to the touch, possibly also made of metal with small wiggly lines over its surface.  The light from the small LED’s on his phone hardly illuminated his hand in front of his face let alone the room a few feet further ahead that carried the echoes into its maw.
His hands rose up defensively and he backed into his car door.  “A’right, man.  Here’s what we’re gonna do.  Tomorrow morning, we’ll have a little pow wow about you trying to lock up a civilian indefinitely because you missed me.  Until then, think about how you’re planning on rephrasing that hot mess of decisions in a way that doesn’t sound heinously illegal.”  He pushed his partner from his car with a victorious smirk and hopped into the driver’s seat.  Ketch stood beside the vehicle radiating hurt and outrage.  Keys found their way into the ignition and Dean rolled his window down to end with, “See you at 9 a.m., partner.”
Dean was noticeably intrigued, leaning over his open driver’s side door with a cloying grin.  “Someone have you rolling around that early?”
The stranger looked at the food then back at Dean, as if he was letting his stomach win the argument.  They made their way to the table near the front window and volleyed unspoken thoughts at eat other as they mowed down.  The idea of muffling their voices with background TV noises occurred to him, but there was no conversation to be had other than joyous moans at the best burgers that side of Virginia.  The steak fries weren’t half bad either.  The blue eyed stranger wolfed the mushroom swiss burger down quickly like it was the first truth he’d known in weeks of jello cube shaped lies.  The smile that graced Dean’s face in reply stretched so wide it almost hurt his cheeks.
“Dick,” he hit his brother back playfully.  He remembered the trip he took to get replacement tires for Baby but spliced in flashes of holding Cas’s hand and having him try the pie at the bakery he found along the way.  Nothing could beat a day trip with his best friend, or whatever they were now, after all of this nonsense.
“See you on Monday then, Cas,” Dean huffed slamming his door shut.
“I’ve never known you to hide from anything.  You didn’t hide from Dad.  You didn’t shy away from being yourself.  You didn’t back away from that bundle of blonde hair in a green blanket when no one else would step up.  You’re the bravest man I know, so you need to get back out there.  If you don’t do it for your own sake, do it for us.  Show us you’re not afraid to find happiness outside the Salvage’s walls.”
Putting the other other car into park beside his beloved Impala, he looked at his dashboard clock.  If he threw Castiel inside, changed into work attire, and sped all the way to the office, he would still be suspiciously behind the eight ball for anyone paying attention.  Quick enough on his feet, he shot off a message to Charlie to make sure the one person watching was otherwise away from their desk until he returned conspicuously busy to his desk.  It would have to buy him enough time to do things right the first time.  He gestured for the stranger to follow him into the house with his bug out bag.  He followed closely taking in the suburban house with more than strictly necessary enthusiasm.  Maybe he lived in a crappy sublet apartment, who knows.
“Excellent.  Except this time it’s not a duck, is it Dean?”
“Yeah, I’m good.  I’m good.  Did you find him?  Is he a’right?” He pushed his palms into the comforter to help lift himself up when Sam raised a flat palm motioning for him to sit back down.
“Don’t,” he warned.
He leaned over and pushed his shoulder into Castiel’s with a shy smile.  “Benny’s practically has the patience of a saint compared to the hotheaded asshole stomping around in the office all day.”
Castiel smiled despite still being on the outside of some understanding the rest of them had, because that’s what you do when people give you gifts.  He unfurled the twine binding it closed and pulled out a single page folded in half.  A handwritten recipe for something called “Swarm Under the Hood” that was scrawled down the center of the page.  The volume of ingredients was too large for a kitchen recipe, but as soon as he read the particular strain of yeast and the name of a locally sourced honey listed it dawned on him.  “Is this a honey mead recipe?”
Intruding on his cloak of silence ran the risk of rubbing him the wrong way, but the surface tension of his emotional processing was teetering on the breaking point anyway.  “All baking recipes or…?”
“Come on, Sammy.  That ornery coot didn’t spend all that time locked in his office shuffling papers.  We must have some info on the guy.”
His body language dropped in temperature: elbows straight, legs crossed more tightly.  “You sound like a journalist.”
“But you wanna know too, right?”
The copy caught him, propped him up by the side with a tight grip, hoisting him to rest on a cold gray bench a few feet away from the pit.  Ragged breaths clawed back up his throat as the man knelt in front of him and pulled his shirt closed.  The dusky moor irises inches from his dipped from the buttons his nimble fingers popped back through button holes and his face.  There was no recognition there, not a single thread to tie them back together.  Though there was pain echoing through his bones, satisfaction reigned around his crown knowing even a pale comparison of his Dean would have the kindness within him to help a stranger in such a state.  Immediately after buttoning the last button, the copy shed his jacket and draped it over his shoulders, the warmth of compassion nearly searing the arctic grip on his skin away.  He left him to hunch in on himself shivering in the cold wind while he made a phone call a few paces away.  Cas gripped at the collar of his jacket and inhaled deeply.  His olfactory senses sent no molecular information to his mind.  His Grace must have been all but gone. The smell of redwood and sweat permeated the navy fabric of the coat.  There was also sweet musky cologne he had never smelled before on the coat, but it was faded, like it had been applied the day before.  While the high notes of Dean were there, the low notes were disturbingly absent.
Dean and Cas's soft interlude is cut short.
Dean felt a modest peck on his jaw.  Cas tested a smile against the agent’s day long scruff.
The incredulity dripped from his hairline and onto his plate with flailing arms and wondering groans.  “Now what does that mean? Also, how could you be in on this Cas?  I thought you were better than stooping to Dean’s pranks,” he bemoaned.
His mug shuffled to the side, he rubbed his neck queuing his thoughts in order of relevance.  “Anna is her name.  She and I met up for coffee to review a legal matter – she’s a lawyer by trade.”
“Wait, are you saying he walked out of a forest somewhere without the ability to use human speech?” he looked up from his note taking flabbergasted.
Sam paused for a long moment.  “You done?”
The silence that followed was only broken by the lapping of his sheathed member.  His focus remained down on the head of his cock proudly breaching Dean’s grasp.
“What’s that?” Sam asked, his knee starting to bounce up and down nervously.
“Eh well, I’m putting that under the ‘ain’t broke’ column.”  He switched on the lights for a large dormitory style bathroom and added.  “The water pressure is fantastic, by the way.”  The light toggled off again and they made their way down the stairs to the next floor.  “Look, little brother, let’s not go all ‘geek’ on this place.”
Cas leaned against the side of island adoring the man sloppily masticating beside him with every cell in his body.  When the muted adoration went on for a bit too long Dean looked up from his empty plate with a quirked eyebrow.
He handed the younger man the coffee, a gift no government agent could resist, and returned a quick grin.  “I’ve been riding the desk four a few days and got to thinking about our man here.  He say anything, yet?”  He was positive he hadn’t but needed to test the young agent’s attentiveness, nonetheless.
The warm hands roaming his back and carding through his hair were the revelation he had been chasing for long before he could give this sense of peace a name.  Now he knew its diminutive name like its claim to him was etched on his bones.  “Don’t cash in that chit so quickly next time.”
If Dean thought he could get away with merely promising cookies, he clearly didn’t know his kin.  She reminded him no less than three times during dinner that he promised dessert to which he countered with a pudding cup if she ate all of her broccoli.  Her desire for the sugary confection morphed into firm demands for the aforementioned delights immediately following the final floret disappearing into her reluctant maw.  Fussiness melted into pouting then into a full-fledged meltdown.  Annoyed but not at all surprised, he ordered her to her room so he could make the prize she sought if and only if she wasn’t a complete pill in the interim.  Another motivating factor was that he wanted a few for movie time after she went to bed.  With the batter mixed and the first batch in the oven, he set a timer on his phone.
“Does it affect Salvage?” She stood upright; miming a pillar Dean could lean on if he wanted.
Dean tossed the cheap pen at his nettlesome brother’s face. “Shut up!”
“You didn’t know?”
He raised his head slightly in the direction of his room at the far end of the hallway, but crinkled his nose as if to say it was much too far away.  “Here is adequate,” he attempted to detangle himself from Dean’s side but found himself firmly in place. Too tired to fight, he stayed huddled against his friend’s firm pajama clad side.
There was a mid-range squeal on the line like he was being recorded.  Come to think of it, why was Sam calling the work line?  They still did all their business calls on their cellphones, yet another business expense.  “I’ll give you seven.  What’s up?”
“Well, that’s what insurance is for.  So, is Cas still there?”
The pouting hunter pulled back to look at the self-indulgent grin plastered on his face.  With an annoyed squint he nodded and a whoosh whisked the angel away.
“Ah.  I hid until you were probably halfway back to town.”
A lively rainfall slowed their progress.  The even tempo of a wonky right windshield wiper made the twenty minute drive drag on especially after work related conversation ground to a halt.  The hollow patter of rain against the vehicle drowned out every other word, so the creaking of the van’s shocks over country roads became the dominant soundtrack.  The restaurant’s dim neon sign guided them into the parking lot despite the sudden downpour’s efforts to send their haul into a roadside ditch.
“Even after I gained my cell’s trust, I had yet to even lay eyes on their enigmatic leader.  My cell’s leader – a hauntingly beautiful but undeniably psychopathic brute named Covarrubias endorsed my induction into the family officially, but that required a unique swearing in.  I was dispatched to Lerona with a captive in tow; a gangly blonde in his early twenties with a striking set of soft blues,” he hummed wistfully.  Something called his attention to the far left, tearing his steely voice into a listless lament for the last few syllables.  “What put this man in danger’s path became apparent a few days after I threw him in the freshly dried cement of his solitary cell.  The central sect of the family completed the compound’s construction only a week before.  They didn’t even have time to trash it with anything other than their twisted ideologies.  I brought my captive tiny portions of prepackaged junk food and water once a day for over a month since no one else bothered to keep tabs on if he ate.  He grew frailer and weaker, but never pleaded for more, never kowtowed.  This young man was braver in the face of impending death than most of the men we stand shoulder to shoulder with.  Although he did not speak much, he uttered volumes with his fearless stoicism in the face of countless interrogations, multiple beatings.  They let the bruises grow yellow and brown before they started in again.  The imbeciles even gave him a concussion a couple of weeks in when the whispers started that his family wouldn’t give in to Krycek’s demands.
A smidge less tired, he propped himself up against his headboard and flicked a creaky thumb through his three e-mail accounts, sorting the messages from his alias cult inductee contact and writing accounts first.  If he received a reply back from Dean about the select unedited chapters he sent, he would have responded on his personal account, so he saved that one for last.  When he expended the courage to open it, much to his astonishment he found nothing.  Now leaning towards Dean not having read it at all, he checked his Salvage e-mail on a whim.  In a regular week, there were a handful of messages concerning final versions of marketing mailers, links to collaborative documents, or vendor anniversary notifications, but rarely anything he needed to weigh in on while out of the office.  His first day of each week at Salvage, one of the brothers would catch him up all the noteworthy matters from the beginning of the week rapid fire style while tackling another operational tasks like sorting stock, unloading the vans, or futzing with the bottle labeler.  Assuming since Sam announced he wouldn’t be in for their regularly scheduled program, that morning Sam sent them both a quote for three new heavy duty doors and a much more sensitive alarm system from a security appliance company.  The quick note attached alluded to a need to bolster their current system “to avoid further break-ins”.
“I remade you and reconstructed your broken parts many times over.  I can tell you have been wearing yourself thin,” he said, his voice crackled on the deep o’s.
He knew better than to entertain the idea that Ketch would try to stop him from walking away.  Out in the nipping autumn wind, he pulled his warm keys from his pocket when he heard a bass tone call out his name.  He half turned to see Benny standing closer than necessary to him with telling honesty, a need to give him comfort after seeing the frustration on his furrowed brow.
He could hear typing in the background and light murmuring. It had to be official business if she called from inside the building.  “No, just landed.  What can I do for you?”
“He mentioned going out for drinks after work with you a handful of times.” She studied his face carefully as she pointed his nose at the matter at hand.  “McClanahan’s, Dyatlov’s Pass, Roscoe’s East…”
“Uh huh,” he replied sarcastically.  “That angel whose been pining harder for you than any human could possibly pine just… broke?  The dam just spilled over without any angsty prodding?”
Dean stood taller and tilted his head slightly.
“What?”
The first morning he woke up with Cas sleeping soundly beside him overcame their link.  The boneless pleased sensation lingered on his right knee, crawled up his back to the skin over his sciatic nerve, and zipped up his spine to his racing heart.  He exhaled deeply ushering the frazzled bundle of energy working its way out with it.  The tender sensation floated up to his left eye and seemed to escape out of the top of his head.
The other agent sat up, his eyes keen on Sam’s face.  “What is it?”
As he showered, the agent spoke of this world’s Benny with reverence and respect.  This Benny seemed just as ravenous, but instead of human blood, he hungered for justice.  What a pure sentiment for a twisted and depraved thing as a vampire, he thought.  Still yet another person they knew gave this Dean companionship, and for that he was grateful.
“You need another phone to break?  Why didn’t you just call him if you
Somewhere mid-sentence she leaned over and crashed into his shoulder making overt sniffing noises.
“Cas?” he asked, grinning so widely, he thought his face had split in half.
“Good point,” he agreed, practically skipping in relief alongside her.
Brisk throaty exhales climbed to the ceiling past the door.  Exhales devolved into panting as a flesh against flesh syncopation escalated rhythmically.  The blood pooled up in his cheeks and dove further south as the full realization pulsated through him thrumming further and further into his extremities with every heartbeat.  A dusky inscrutable groan leapt from Cas’s throat but digressed into a weakly placated moan from climax.  The blood floated up to the agent’s ears and he forced himself to step away from the door.  Only then did the patter of the showerhead he expected to hear earlier start up.  Feeling an abruptly provoked arousal he sorted through his options from most satisfying to the least appealing: burst down the door and show Cas what state his little unintended display had left him in, and take care of himself in the privacy of his bedroom at mach speed leaving Cas none the wiser, drink his beer very quickly and will his situation away with bad reality TV, or sit down in the three seasons room and let the cold bury the alluring imaginings of the damp, nude, otherworldly beauty in his bathroom into the subbasement level of his mind.  Considering all outcomes, Cas would be able to sense his frustration if they melded if he wasn’t sorted already.  The last thing he wanted was to make him feel obligated to handle it himself.  There was no help for it, he concluded.  Feeling like a wildly hormonal teenager again, he passed by the bathroom once again, heard the water still running, bolted into his room, and locked the door.  Within moments, he pulled out the lube from his side table, got comfortable on his side of the bed, and began replaying the fresh memories now firmly nestled into his spank bank dedicated to Cas’s filthy moans of self-pleasure.  The imagined pained, needy, erotic face of his growling want erupted from his center.  The agents’ hand flew up and down his shaft mixing the liquid pooling at the head with the warming lubricant forcing a strangled moan into the cool bedroom air.  His hips moved of their own accord as he heedlessly fucked into his clenched fist.  His teeth pinched his bottom lip tighter between them sensing the tension of his loadbearing coil of sensuous pleasure.  A flash of Cas’s envisioned wanton chest falls and arousal tinging flesh flooded his being from the tips of his toes to his slick finger pads with the inevitable tingle of orgasm.  Lightening flares of hidden lust unfurled from the inside out and he came croaking Cas’s name between the end of one wrecked grunt into another trying to stop his heedless vocalizations.  Damn it, he was a teenager again: horny, messy, and moderately embarrassed at his body’s response.  He cleaned himself up with his now stain shirt and closed the drawer beside him, lamenting that if he didn’t shower now that he might smell unpleasant if Cas wanted to share his bed again.  Would that be normal for them going forward?   He listened for the flow of water from the shower while gathering lounge clothes, but heard nothing.  Suddenly there was a hesitant knock.  Oh god, he berated himself.  Now he was fucked.
“You’ve gotta talk to me.  Cas, man, you’re scaring me.  You’re going to freak Dean out even more,” he pleaded.
“I’m sure you will be,” his rejoinder was soaking in reassurance.
“What’s he talking about?  Does a company as small as Salvage even have a Human Resources department?” Castiel asked just as clueless as when Benny pleaded for a tiebreaker vote on which team would take home the state win this year.
(See the end of the chapter for
He tilted his head up slightly distracted from how well their fingers laced together and confirmed.  “I remember thinking the crops looked thirsty during the drive and voilà a storm barreled in.”
Sam nodded passively.  “I know, Dean.  Just…” he half attempted to make a contrary point but was waved away.  “You start removing the arch angel warding.  I’ll go get the ingredients.”
Jody cocked her head to the side, reading Sam’s flattery at face value.  “That nugget was Donna’s idea.  If you wanted to extend the deal, you could have dropped off a new contract, but I don’t see any briefcases, just fancy shoes,” she eyed Sam’s loafers.
Castiel let himself be ushered out of the office, following Dean as he locked up the front door and out to their unpaved parking patch.  “Yes.  Is eight-thirty acceptable?  I have a few things to attend to mornings. Any earlier would be troublesome for other parties.”
“Well, I have most Sundays off unless Sam needs a hand,” he answered with a tinge of defensiveness.  “You on the other hand are free help out whatever days you want after the first two weeks.  I thought you and Sam got all this sorted yesterday after I left to pick up my kid from daycare.”
The lump in his throat stubbornly wouldn’t pass even with a hand lightly gripped below his adam’s apple to help guide its way.  “If only it were that simple,” he nearly whispered.
Several days and an eternity of empty hours slipped by since that woodsy voice last soothed his frayed wiring.  Now that he could see him standing sideways mostly behind the heavy oak door with hair like an abruptly woken toddler, he let his rich voice smooth down his jagged spring loaded barbs. So starved to follow those warm measures anywhere, his urge to reply was all but forgotten.
He hummed and hawed internally, clearly more at ease with the black and white subject of black or red numbered ledgers.  “You could afford half and half as well as fill this need for a security update, if that’s what you want to do.  The other reductions would be non-negotiable until you review profits after the end of next quarter.”
Any reply he could have mustered was stuck in Dean’s throat like an entire swallow dive-bombed into his slack jawed maw.  With weakened knees he practically collapsed into the middle of the couch.  Cas pulled the hunter’s impractically tight jeans and boxer briefs off of his hide, barely giving him an instant to lift his rump off of the couch for easier extraction.   His eyes grew wide at the desire given voice in his angel’s orders.  He watched as Cas’s knees hit the cold cement floor between his open legs inches in front of the couch.  Impatient hands ran up his outer thighs to grab ample handfuls of his ass greedily.  Dean’s face telegraphed how badly he yearned for the pink tongue that darted out to play on the angel’s lips.  When his palms didn’t move at first, a speck of fear appeared between his eyebrows.  Catching that alarm, Cas wouldn’t let that discomfort mar their first foray inside each other.  His hands glided up his sides and onto his broad shoulders as he climbed playfully to sit on his thighs.  Once he undoubtedly had Dean’s undivided focus, he caressed his chin, “There will come a day when I can no longer dam up my perpetual desire to own every part of you, and I will take you.  I will fulfill your aching want over and over until I have satisfied your every need to be owned, loved, and used by me.  This time, you lay back and let me spoil you.  You have done so much for me, changed me for the better, so let me do this for you.”
Her shit eating grin loosened as Dean’s eyes kept glued to the dirt floor.  “What makes you think he’s lying to you?”
He shook his head, not one hair falling out of place.  “I have official business to discuss.”
“I’ll be good. I’ll be good!” she answered, the sudden waterworks entirely forgotten.
Dean reflects on a great morning.  They test how far their link will stretch.
The conjured scenarios of returning to a man he’d never met plagued him from the night before, when he finally gave into temptation.  Sometimes they met in a coffee shop or a bar or just out in the street.  Their eyes would lock.  That same reassuring smile would drape over his mouth effortlessly, tying their tether back together as the distance between them diminished.  Other times he would dwell on James Novak’s mental illness, dream up a horrific meeting where seeing him would send him into a schizophrenic episode.  No matter the situation he brought to life, it always stopped the moment the dark haired man opened his mouth.  He knew in his bones what Cas’s voice felt like, how it tore at his bark and slivered down to his roots.  But the sound – how his utterances would fall on his eardrums was a complete mystery.
Letting steam pile out of the bathroom, he turned the right corner to his room where a brighter luminescence caught his eye.  He blinked a couple of times to make sure water droplets on his eyelashes were not playing havoc on his peripheral sightlines.  Was that wall lamp always so bright?  Staring into it from a couple of feet away, the arc of electricity swayed to a soundless rhythm.  He rubbed his eyelids to try to smooth out the bright spots on his corneas.  The hangover must have had more of a hold on him than he thought.
“I’ll get your breakfast together.  Now go,” he insisted through an encouraging but fake smile.
============================================
“Oh, Benny said I should…”
His stomach churned and folded over on itself about halfway through the pile.  The clock on the face of the borrowed phone told him it was late afternoon, which was about the time he fell headlong into his third nap of the day slumped on the carpet.  Letting his Graceless form dictate his action fecklessly, he turned the volume down on the player and his head lolled to the side.  Within three bridges of a long dead balladeer’s opus, he was out.
“Yeah, I know.  Are you back?”
“I got another idea!”
He ripped his eyes from the darkness outside to retrieve the items Dean listed.  He padded over to the couch and placed the box on the coffee table.  A large constipated huff escaped his lips as he read the box’s logo.  Some unnamed pride climbed over his face but flushed away leaving a peculiar sadness in its wake.
“There are only glimpses when I try to remember my biological family.  I had a mother and a father, and a slightly younger brother to round out the lot.  All of us had similar features except my father.  All evidence pointed towards his genetics contributing very little to our makeup.  The one thing my father passes onto me was an obsession with the written word.  There were stacks on stacks of old books and the loudest typewriter you’ve ever heard in his study.  I think we had an aunt close by as well, but I couldn’t tell you her name.  I was very close to my brother, but our parents both worked, so we took care of ourselves just fine.  There was always plastic wrapped food waiting the fridge and clean clothes in our closets.  Our mother’s love for us was obvious in that we wanted for nothing but she always seemed to forget the most important part, the everyday shows of affection.  From arm’s length, I imagine we seemed like the pinnacle of suburban success.
“So Dean wasn’t hurt?  That’s at least something,” his response emanated relief but Sam’s distracted expression told him to pry more.  “He was?”
He stood ramrod straight and pulled his lapels towards the center anxiously.  “Come on.  We’ve got a mission,” he stated stiffly, then shoved Sam’s elbow forward as his sentient social shield.
==================
That all too familiar thinning stare punctuated by crow’s feet ended her journey to the point of the matter.  “The family needs to know why it happened, how it happened.  You have the means to provide those answers.”
“In case it wasn’t obvious, I’m still not interested.  I will never kowtow to the founder’s or their sadistic teachings.  Just get on with it, already.  I have business to attend to elsewhere.”
The expressionless stare spilled off of the stranger’s face.  Fear carved its talons into every pore and crease.  He looked around the corners of the room behind Dean and drew his arms up around himself, as if pulling his body into a smaller target.  His broad shoulders bunched up beside his ears and began to lightly bounce.  Dean stood to reach out and comfort the terror out of him when the bouncing shoulders gave way to light grunting puff of air escaping from a stiff smile.
Dean’s breath quickened when his eyes moved to Cas’s fast approaching hands, “Cas?”
One of the many advantages of a well-positioned opponent staring you down is that they aren’t paying attention to the world at their sides or at their flank.  If you can keep them distracted and have synchronized allies, you could out maneuver an enemy many times your size depending on what weapons you have at your disposal.  Cas had no allies in this war of one sided words and no slingshot or stones.
Not that he minded the nickname, but hearing such an affectionate diminutive from the same mouth that housed such a myriad of curses earlier in the day was startling.
She patted his shoulder affectionately.  “No, brother.  He does.”
Her mischievous smirk added layers to his suspicion even though he prayed for a sturdy shovel to lessen their burden.  “Ever heard of an angel investor?”
Instantly she leapt out of her chair towards the door.  He grabbed her mid jump by the middle to stop her in her tracks, just to frustrate her at first, but then it was just for the fun of feeling her desperately try to claw towards the door.  After a few moments, she surrendered to defeat, hanging loose in his arms with a huff.  “Can I have a cookie now, Dadda? Pleeease?”
“If there can be evil cheerio creatures that eat people, there has to be its opposite somewhere in the world, right?  There’s gotta be a burger fairy.  Now tell me you found something.”  He looked a fries with less interest and searched for any way to be useful.
Cas and Dean cleared the piles of closed books to the far end of the table but left the open face pages in the center.  Prints of stilted reverent uniformed figures and diagrams described in a language Dean didn’t know lent an ominous air to the room.  “So what’s all this about?”
She whisked past them staring her down along the way.  “Four years doesn’t make that much of a difference.”
She smiled, and then half stepped out from his shadow.  “I’m Claire, mister.”
“The job center and afterschool tutoring programs,” he recalled.  “You once said you wanted to give back to the community that took you in, but that was only part of the story.”
His eyes darted from one side of Dean’s head to the other as if to weigh his options.  “I mean it doesn’t solve all of our problems but it does get us closer to finding him.  This isn’t a good idea, though.”
“He hates it here now.  God, he wants to leave again.”  The whites of his eyes widened as his irises ping ponged back and forth frantically.
Back in bed with headphones blocking out every other noise like the inky black of the bunker’s dark blocked out every ray of light, he started up the newest iteration of his childhood favorite slaughterhouse flick.  The accelerated pace of the day caught up with him quickly, though.  The bloodcurdling shrieks of frightened coeds couldn’t stop his eyelids from drooping or his chin from sagging down into his chest.  Before the scythe wielding serial killer could hack off his first victim’s head, darkness overcame him.
“The dead can’t feel anything let alone ‘put out’.”
------------------------------
Dean clenched at the counter edge absently and grunted in aggravation.  “Fine.  We look into Bobby’s involvement and we make the financial case to Cas that we need to reevaluate security.  I mean we have to.  I can’t risk Claire’s or anyone else’s safety on the off chance they come snooping around again.”
Fluctuating tones echoed off of those same office walls as he listened to him half read half breathe on speakerphone. He could count the number of times he sat on the opposite side of the desk and waited the old man out on one hand, but he stopped keeping a tally of the times he sat in his place worrying his nails to the quick over if the business would fold by that point.  “We’re burning daylight.  There’s maybe a fifteen minute window for me to pick the squirrel before the daycare calls and it’s a twenty minute drive.”
His bottom jaw slammed shut and he nodded at Cas with his shoulders hunched slightly.
His telltale head tilt landed his dark locks closer to Dean’s head.  Questions in an unknown tongue leeched from his head in all directions and vanished into the air.
be mad at the assholes that tied you up and prodded you.  Instead you’re all
“GET OUT!” he shouted without even moving his head, fists still tightly woven around the leather grip of the wheel.
“Yeah that was like once…” he flitted his eyes over to Cas and pouted.
Just as he found it, he arranged the notes and book back where they were and listened for Sam pacing right where he had been grumbling into the phone.  With sweating beers in hand, he walked past him again, gauging his distracted mien for guilt or knowledge of his mistake but came away with only embarrassed grumbling at whoever was on the other end of the conversation.  They exchanged a nod and he carried on back down the stairs.  The same snippet of terrified bloodcurdling shrieks replayed as he entered the room.
Sam opened the door and slid out of the tiny car’s claustrophobic cabin.
Ketch’s wide grin could have caught a stray canary.  He gave Dean a pointed look and waited.
Everyone clapped and hollered, jubilantly clinking plastic cups in a ring around the fire.  It finally dawned on him that they had all played a hand in making this tremendously thoughtful proposal.  The brothers approached him, obviously eager to shake his hand in an informal pact.  There were details to settle and a mountain of questions to ask, which piled up taller the closer they strode.  The appropriate words to convey how affected he was failed to do him any justice, again.  Instead he mashed the crux of the matter into a discernable shape.  “I’m a writer,” he blurted out.
He motioned towards the unopened bottle of red wine perched on the counter.  He filled two glasses midway and offered one to Sam.  “It’s a long story.  We’re gonna need these, though.”
“James Novak,” he said with less authority than his enthusiasm for tall and hairy’s personal barbell.
“It’s… an evolving situation,” he hollered with intermittent splashes muffling his reply.
The agent deals with the left over tensions from a big case then attempts to interview the fallen man.
“You’ve really screwed yourself when it comes to future work parties, then.  Gonna ask you to make ones in other flavors.”  He grabbed the final flavored cookie the moment the second cookie was gone and held it out far enough to inspect it.
Charlie reclaimed her spot across of Sam at her tablet, but didn’t unlock it.  She chewed at her bottom lip, patient for Sam to give her an inroad.
Her squint accused him of treachery.  “Smells like cookies.”
He rubbed his hand on the short hairs on the back of his head and subverted his gaze.  “I know, but I also have you to protect me.”
He bit at the inside of cheek and tried to siphon the giddiness out of Dean’s predatory gaze with a harsh stare.
“One, we have theories, but don’t know anything for sure quite yet.  Two, after how grumpy you were when I called this morning, I know you miss him already.”
“Dean met with one Chester Wallis at an independent bookstore a few miles from the site who gave us crucial details on their grand design.  It was genius really.  It used the infrastructure of the sewage system to… nevermind.  That’s a tale for another time.  Five minutes after spilling to our man had a proper rat’s send off.”
” was all but tattooed to his scrunched up forehead.
“It’s a diagram of ten creative forces or ‘Sephirot’ that intervene between God and our world.  Through these powers God created and rules the universe, and it is by influencing them that humans cause God to send forces of compassion or severe judgement to Earth. The Malkuth are the tenth Sephirot, the one at the bottom.  They give tangible form to other expressions of the divine on our plane of existence.  In the most basic terms, they believe that angels fell from heaven during an angel on angel battle and in retaliation God emptied heaven of its angels and shut its doors.  The primary goal for Malkuth is to locate these beings.  But most of its members aren’t born into their faith, they are found.”
The agent’s tongue slid over his front teeth, reminding him he had yet to perform his daily routine.  Yet again, he was leaving his fate in the supposed angel’s hands by leaving him unsupervised, but his teeth felt like they were wearing sweaters and his personal smell left a lot to be desired after all of the sitting and running from the previous day.  The chair scraped against the cheap linoleum as he backed away from the kitchen table.  “Don’t go fluttering away on me while I shower.  I wouldn’t want have to hunt down a big ass net to pull you down,” he muttered as he made his way to the bathroom.  Once closed inside the room lit with a pair of struggling incandescent bulbs, he started the shower and attempted to push the bubbling existential question aside.  He had to plan out their next steps.  If he went about his business as usual, Ketch was sure to have questions he didn’t have good answers to.  If he didn’t, Pileggi might send another agent to bring him in.  With several active cases, if he skipped out he wouldn’t be any closer to solutions and more people could be hurt in the meantime.  There was no help for it; he had to stash Castiel somewhere safe and head back into the bureau.  Castiel was so cumbersome to say, plus is sounded vaguely Italian, Dean mulled.  Angels weren’t even European, if his memory served correctly.  Dean stuck with the mentally unwell theory with a dash of psychic which was one thousand percent more believable than angels.  At this point the truth was still subjective, but committing his theories to a report would end his career.
He grabbed the beer offered and flicked his wrist a couple of times into the ether.  “Just a bit hot in here.”
Silently, Dean leaned a hip against the desk and fished a donut out for inspection.  “Maple or traditional glaze?”
“I have one condition.”  Standing taller, he smiled like he was holding the punchline to an old joke on his tongue.
“Ion?”
“Wait, you’re going to down-the-road ‘Lebanon’?  There’s no hunter’s shop within a couple hundred miles of here.”
Dean rearranged his room a couple of times during lunch breaks for an activity to tamp down his mounting worries as they spewed from the cave he shoved them into like a last minutes camping trip duffle.  Eventually he pushed the bed up against the wall furthest from the door with the desk on the left and freestanding wardrobe on the right.  Since he sold or donated most of his possessions for the move from the city, he didn’t have much taking up residence on the ledge above his bed: a record player with two empty milk crate’s worth of records, a pile of vintage magazines, his laptop, various chargers, and a cigar box full of family photos.  The rest was shoved into the desk or into the bottom of the wardrobe.  Out of all the concession he had to make, Dean never earnestly complained about a single sacrifice he had to make to take up Bobby’s mantle.  Only when it concerned his little girl, did he lend voice to any of their misfortune.  It was one of the many of the things Sam admired about his brother; his unwavering dedication to his little one’s happiness and safety.  Laying eyes on that cigar box stirred up a well of concentrated frustration as his gaze passed over it.  The painful memories layered onto faded printed photographs beneath its splintering lid pressed Sam’s dense anger into his constricting throat.  Images Dean dissected in moments of reflection held no solace for Sam.  Everyone in those candid photographs was six feet under except for the Winchesters housed in this art deco inspired subterranean fortress.  Once again dwindled down by illness, their miniscule numbers hang heavy in his heart.
Hot affection bloomed up from his flushed chest like a plants springing to full form in a time lapse film.  Its stem knew their destined path even before its sun greedy leaves broached moist soil.  From a seed to a winding outstretched flower, it needed no reassurance that its destination was fertile and vigilantly protected.  Inklings of bone deep feelings were planted long before; he just needed a chance to let it take root.
He leaned over the table and scanned the table of contents warily.  “A’right.  You go get some sleep and I’ll pick up the first shift.  And uh, thanks for coming back so quick,” he ducked his head back into the pages and shoved a fistful of fries in his face before Sam could make it a moment.
“Dean please don’t…” he attempted to beg.
“Yep, guess I’ll have to ask HR what their policy is on employees dating.  Might have to make some changes to the contract,” he jested.
“Every fucking day some facet of this case horrifies me,” he ranted, his leg beginning to bounce in frustration.  “So this was one of the files from Dean’s computer.  What other changes were made?”
His eyes nearly bugged out of his head as the pages unfolded one by one.  “It’s not possible –“
His life looked pretty planned out, even noting recurring events no one else would bother to document like when he went for runs outside or saw movies at the theater.  The movies were mostly at the local independent theater.  The agent had been there a couple of times with friends, but was never prompted to go there by himself by any particular film.  James had been there the night before to see a spaghetti western he’d never heard of.  Dean dug back into his calendar for the past two years.  There was a gap in reporting activity for the couple of months that overlapped with the period he was committed.  There was an attachment for the medications he was prescribed as well as original issue and refill dates.  Some were never even filled.  He tried not to judge him on that info.  He wasn’t a doctor of any stripe so extrapolating any assumptions would have been exercising bias versus analyzing the facts as they were.  Tonight he had an amateur photography exhibition listed, but no address.  It was too late to make it to the exhibit’s opening time and he would have no idea how to start that conversation despite hundreds of walkthroughs in his head, even if he knew where it was being held.  The last file was a copy of all of his social media posts.  He only had one account to which he posted no photos of himself or any other people.  The artistic shots dispersed on his posts led him to believe he had one of the exhibits at the show that night.  Chasing that lead down, he searched the name of the show in search of the gallery.  In for a penny, he ventured over to the gallery’s website to find any representations of his work.  The gallery seemed low budget, possibly community run for afterschool and adult learning programs.  It was indeed a group show, but no photos were included so he would have to haul his ass all the way back downtown to see the one night only show or lose the chance.  He checked the clock at the bottom right corner of the screen.  If he got back in the car right that moment, he might catch him if it was that kind of art show where the artist makes small talk about their works and declines selling it to someone there too drunk on free booze to offer up a decent amount for their time and dedication.  He looked down at his suit and resigned himself to a very quick change and another hour in the car.
The man guided his head into the car carefully and buckled his seatbelt for him before closing the door.  Castiel caught these new green eyes fishing into his shirt and up his face while they remained close, not entirely sure what to think.  They pulled back onto the busy city street then briefly onto an elevated highway.  The highway arched up over the city putting the skyscrapers and many large historic buildings on display around them.  His eyes shambled from landmark to landmark trying to compare them to sights he knew, but he drew a blank.  The tall billboards with five foot high bubble letters scrawled across their center conjured no meaning.  The sun ducked back behind the skyline as they exited the highway down onto street level.  A few more turns brought them to a seven story large building with rows and rows of windows with the curtains pulled closed.
“Wouldn’t leaving without saying goodbye be rude?” he asked, following him past Sam’s brown vehicle to the driver’s side door of his own.  The warmth between their palms had already evaporated into the cooling night air.
Cas’s skepticism returned.  “That sounds ominous.”
“Ah, that’s right,” he hummed like he was remembering a passage from his favorite novel.  “You want me to ‘fill you up’,” he purred at the recollection.
Outside the building, a familiar green SUV was also parked on the gravel with its headlights on.  A tall man circled around its hood and waved at him.  He eased on the brake gingerly and parked as to not wake his precious cargo.  Leaving his headlights on, he stepped out to take stock of the situation.
“He wants you to yell at him,” Sam chuckled.  “I think he’s got one of those afterschool discipline kinks.”
“I never thanked you by the way, for giving her so many issues.  I didn’t know you were the one buying them for her for a long while.  Thought it was her favorite uncle,” he admitted his oversight weakly.
“You still want this, Sam?” he asked timidly.  “I’ll only cause you trouble.  There’s no way this thing ends well for me, and I don’t want to drag you down, cause you any pain.”
“Do we need to go over the questionnaire again today or can we just skip the formalities?  You tell me you are just an innocent experimental aircraft fighter pilot and we send you back to some country past the iron curtain.  How does that sound?”  Flat toned annoyance peppered the air around him.  His eyes fixed on the coat still wrapped around his shoulders like he was staring at the wrong skin on the wrong body.
Dean caressed the meat of Cas’s thumb with his own restless digits and let the expectant air form an ever growing bubble in their tether.
While Castiel was curious what he sent him, he tried to locate any constellations he knew in an attempt to give him privacy.
“What was this knight in shining armor’s name, Cas?”  He shot to his feet, even if it was just to give him enough leverage to self-servingly lord over him.   His silence plucked at every nerve in his body capable of hurt and annoyance at once.  “Who was this perfect specimen capable of wooing an Angel of the Lord in a freakin’ fortnight?”
On the Sunday of that final weekend, the bank representatives showed up to assess the property, validate no major damage had occurred since its last appraisal, then unceremoniously asked for keys they would change the locks for come Monday.
“And when you were replacing the parts for the refrigeration unit, what year did you say they were made?”
“That would make sense,” he answered with chillingly terse logic.
“Strike one.”
“Trust me, it will be worth your…” she cleared her throat and hung up abruptly.
“Stop it,” he chided looking down at his watch.  “I’ll be back right at the last bell.  You’ll be home in time for Dr. Sexy. Don’t you worry.”
“A melittologist.”
, he smirked and lifted himself up.  He rocked back down and lifted slowly several times, monitoring Cas’s face below him for anything worrisome.  After their first experimental movements proved good enough to repeat, he began fucking down on him in earnest.  Cas’s hands traveled back up to his hips to reposition him every few strokes to claim that sweet spot once again.  Dean cock bounced up and down against him with a light thwap and the head engorged all little bit more with every little smack.  All at once, Cas pulled him down at just the right angle and the bundle of nerves in him sang out, whiting out to the back of his eyelids with every swift grind.
The man beside him who leaned a palm against the sturdy wooden fence stood straight up as he approached.  With light winged flutters playing havoc in his middle, he hazarded to stand close as he listened to the women chatter.  The option to reach out under the cover of night buzzed in the sparse inches separating them.  Both stared unwaveringly at the happy pair, playing chicken with the thickening tension.  Castiel licked his lips, his cresting heartbeat heralding blood upwards to the tips of ears.  If anyone called him out on it, he could blame in on the beer, but by the time he felt the warmth of four fingers caress his lower back, there was at least one person he couldn’t have lied to about it.  A deep sigh spewed out of the man now connected to him with increasingly brazen touches.  A thumb joined its brethren, then a palm soon after; painting long smooth strokes all across his back.  The movements drew the tingling electricity meandering in his gut right to the skin, magnetically pulling him closer into Dean’s reach, but slowly enough that the infatuated couple near them giggled on none the wiser.  Their high pitched laughter caught Starr’s attention and she called them back to the fire pit with two cups in hand.
Sam could make out a mumbled reply, but felt helplessly hobbled from after effects of the ritual.  How could he help Dean through this pain if he was out of commission himself?  It wasn’t the worst pain he had ever endured to be sure, but support is support.  Straining desperately not to flex his core muscles eased the stabbing flashes, but only time and secluded darkness would quell the temporary discomfort.
Dean leaned forward and grabbed her focus away from Sam’s overpriced footwear.  “We want to extend the contract, no question.  However we were thinking about Comet hops instead of Columbus.  Is that viable on this land?”
Looking down at the crown of his dark head, their intimate moment stoked a fire within him he needed to quell if the words he hunted for were to be caught.  Mick was professionally cautious, but brazen when comfortable.  “Me, too.  If you don’t mind wearing the same clothes twice, I would enjoy it if you stayed over.  We could just watch a movie or just talk if you want.”  Their comfortable embrace must have knocked something loose in him as it was at that moment a loud rumble sounded from Sam’s stomach, sprouting an amused laugh out of Mick.
“Dean?” Charlie called out.
Sam and Mick have a tussle.  The agent and Cas grow closer.
“Wait, ‘talked’?  You said you couldn’t.”
Every bone in his body quaked for the angel, craved his nearness like the last inch between opposing magnets.  Nothing about his posture mirrored that sentiment in return. His focus drawn in the other direction hunched over the pile of black discs in colorful cardboard sleeves.
With more than an ounce of trepidation, he tilted a head to the Impala. “It’s unlocked. I’ll be there in two shakes.”
His eyebrows pulled together and he shook his head again, almost looking annoyed.  In his peripheral vision, Dean saw him wiggle his toes.  “Nothing to do with anything, but have they given you any socks?”
