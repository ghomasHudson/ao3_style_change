Dean arched an eyebrow. Cas knew about the subject, really? He found that hard to believe.
Castiel let out a soft breath before smiling at Dean. "I'm proud of you, even if you would have been drawn in. You made the choice of talking first and not hitting him right when you saw him. That's all I asked. I was hoping he didn't provoke you because you would have beaten him up and I would not defend him and saying you were wrong to do so. I'm very proud of you Dean." he told him. "Also, you have bruises on your knuckles. I was wondering when you were going to tell me what really happened." he added.
"Yeah, we're don't know a whole lot about this. I'm up for whatever, as long as I can keep my own clothes on." Dean replied.
"Yeah Dean, don't you want like 50 of these babies running around you house?" Jo teased, taking one of Dean's fries and eating it.
Castiel waited anxiously for Dean's reply before jumping slightly when his phone went off and he read the message. His eyes widened and he didn't know what to feel. He started flailing his arms a little in a panic to keep his texting etiquette going. He flipped through more of the magazine but couldn't find anything and he scrambled back off the bed and got the rest of the magazines and spread them all out and tried to find out how you respond to this. They told him to be seductive and lead the other person in the right direction of what he wanted. He didn't even know what he wanted from this. He wasn't even expecting what was next. He texted in his reply to Dean before he covered his face with his hands in embarrassment and flopped back onto the bed with a pillow on his face, flailing slightly at how bold he was being.
Castiel looked at the clock again before grabbing his bag and heading out the door to gym to find Dean. He got crowded in the hallway but he didn't think much of it since it was always crowded so he just tried to weave his way through, saying excuse me before someone pushed him roughly and then another push and he hit a locker by stumbling and dropped his things. Thankfully, nothing scattered out like the first day of school so he quickly stooped down to gather his things, trying to ignore the laughing. He needed to get to Dean to see if he was okay.
"I know I'm gonna regret this, but dare." He said after a few moments.
Castiel held the stockings in his hand, seeing them a little dusty. He waved them out to get the dust out and looked pleased when the color was a bit more vibrant. "Oh well, you would know better than I. I am book smart and you are life smart, so I'll just follow your lead." he said.
"I'm sorry." Dean replied, hating that he couldn't have been there. He didn't want Cas to feel alone or to hurt, not now or ever. "I'm here now."
The drive didn’t take long and Dean saw Benny’s truck already parked so he pulled the impala up by it and got out the car, going to Benny’s door and went inside. “Benny, where are you?” he called out before a dog padded over to Dean, eagerly wagging his tail for Dean to pet him.
Dean settled in next to Cas, letting out a contented breath. "Night, Cas." He replied quietly. He really didn't want to go back to school and he was worried about how hard it would be for Cas, but they just had to face it for now.
"Yes, that sounds fine. There's more room up there anyways. Plus it has a nice view of the school." Castiel nodded, he didn't think much of the reason why Dean said they should stick to the roof. The roof was where they mostly were for the school year before it got cold. He ate away at his cereal before it was done and he put away his and Dean's bowl. He looked at Dean, after and wrapped his arms around him. "Can I have a kiss?" he asked.
"Oh! I must show you my collection!" Castiel swam off and Dean followed after him, glancing at everything. Castiel swam back out so quickly he nearly smacked Dean in the face. He was holding a seashell in his arms and was looking at Dean proudly. "I found this. Isn't it pretty?" he asked.
"I like that better anyway. Less pressure if I'm here just 'cause you want me." Dean replied with a light laugh, shifting slightly against Cas. He wasn't sure how long it would take for him to be able to put some space between Cas and him, but for tonight he just wanted closeness. He rested his cheek against Cas's shoulder, letting out a soft, contented sigh.
He gently licked Dean's lip, feeling it swell up a little. He gently kissed it before kissing him deeply and slowly while the hand with the vibrator moved down between them and gently ran against Dean's cock. The other hand was just resting on the side of Dean's head, playing with his hair as he kissed him. He teased him with the vibrator, running it up and down then right on the head and just keeping it there as he kept the kiss going. He felt little bursts of arousal seeing Dean like this under him and knowing it was what he was doing that was making him react this way. He gently nudged Dean's legs apart, settling in between them. He wondered how far Dean could take it. He broke off the kiss and turned off the vibrator, looking Dean over. He looked completely willing and aroused. He reached behind Dean and slowly pulled down the panties, just a little to give him room around Dean's entrance. He rested his hand on Dean's thighs, looking up at him.
Dean glanced to the kitchen, "I'm gonna make you guys some food okay?" he said to no one in particular before getting up to heat up pizza that they had from yesterday. He rubbed his head, trying to call him thoughts from thinking this wasn't going to work. He believed in everyone, they were capable, but what if it isn't enough. Dean sighed, before coming back with plates and sliding it in front of everyone. Everyone mindlessly ate as they worked.
Castiel smiled, keeping in step with Dean and having a small bounce in his step. He glanced back at the place before looking at Dean. He was excited to see whatever else Dean had planned. "So if I don't have to control myself the whole time are you taking me somewhere more private?" he asked with a smile.
Dean opened his eyes as Cas tilted his head, letting out a soft breath at how Cas was looking at him. His eyes were full of love and affection, and it felt completely intimate and personal. Knowing that he was the only one to share such a look with Cas sent a shiver up his spine. He leaned willingly into the kiss, letting Cas lead it and following his lips.
Dean hummed slightly in pleasure as Cas pulled at his hair, Cas's roughness stirring his arousal. He wrapped his hand across the small of Cas's back, keeping him close as Dean moved along with Cas's lips.
He sighed heavily, he reached for his phone, ready to make the call. When night rolled by, he got ready and laid in bed. He stared at the tank, feeling a sort of emptiness in his chest at not seeing the soft blue glow that was usually in the corner when he went to bed.
"Good." Dean said and smiled against the kiss before pulling away and resting his chin on Cas's chest. "So you're on bed rest and I'm your servant for the day." He said, thinking out loud. "Anything you want me to do for you? Other than just lay on top of you." He added with a laugh.
Dean Winchester: H-Hey.
"Wow, you really cooked up something." Charlie commented. "The little chef." she laughed lightly before walking over to Castiel and hugging him. Castiel smiled a little and hugged her back. "I'm glad you're okay." she said quietly.
"For what?" Dean asked curiously, looking down at him and smiling slightly. He felt a sort of impatient energy in him that made him not the least bit sleepy, though he was comfortable and relaxed with Cas against him.
Castiel gasped and moaned, rolling his hips roughly against him and let him lick his neck. "Want to lick more off of me? Take it then put it where you like."
"No, only when I want to look nice." she said. "Some girls do." she said.
"Taco pizza." Castiel replied.
Dean smiled slightly and gripped Cas against his chest, reaching up and untying the gag carefully. He continued to stroke his back, grounding him and letting him slowly come down from the high as he held him.
Castiel was already drifting to sleep before Dean settled against him again. He dreamt of the future for once. What it would be like with Dean in the future, having a home together and raising a cat. He loved that dream so much, they were so in love. In his dream, they were much older and Dean was still as handsome as he was now, maybe even more and he still loved him to bits and that's all he wanted. He smiled softly in his dream as he squeezed Dean in his sleep, the person who gave him such happy memories and experiences.
Dean rolled his eyes, Cas was getting more of an attitude as he got bigger. When he first came home, his only concern was just being near Dean. Dean sighed softly, hating the thought of Cas sulking or just being upset. He loved seeing his little friend smile, the way his eyes lit up and he would hug his hand.
"That's up to you, maybe you should learn more about him first so you don't hurt his feelings." Sam offered.
Charlie smiled, "Thanks Dean." She said happily, scooping a little on her finger. She offered some to Kevin who shook his head.
"You by my side with your hand in mine." Castiel smiled a little as he squeezed Dean's hand. He looked up at him. "The ground at our feet, you are my strength and hope so I will not ever be in defeat." He translated. He smiled gently at Dean.
"My, my. You guys are quick to defend each other. Seems like I'm the outsider." Balthazar commented. "
"Never." Dean smiled, hugging Benny and patting him on the back before Benny left.
"That's sweet of you." Castiel smiled. "I would enjoy spending the day lazing around with you." He said. He turned slightly in the water to have his back more against Dean and adjusted their hands to wrap around him. He lifted his free hand out of the water, spreading all his fingers. "Five days until New year's. Five days and we can start a new year together." He said.
"Okay." Castiel smiled, taking his clothes before leading the way. "There's not anyone around so we don't have to worry about dressing." He told him, lacing his fingers through Dean's. "But I feel weird naked so let's run." He smiled back at Dean before pulling him faster and toward the room become pulling open the door and taking them inside. "...I know it's a bit forward, but I know these rooms have mirrors... But we don't have to do it now...maybe tomorrow since we can spend the weekend here." He said. "I brought us spare clothes."
'Smooth Winchester...'
"Vanilla wafers and whipped cream, I can do that." Dean smiled at Cas before finishing up the last main bites of pie. "Want anymore of it now though?" He asked, scooting the plate over to him in offering.
'Okay don't screw this up. legs front, bend knees, legs front, bend knees, legs front, bend knees...'
There was an announcement on the intercom, "Good Morning students as you know, any student bullied will have consequences, but we are leaning more to suspension. A group of kids were recently suspended, off campus for their actions. If you do this, we will find out. Don't bully anyone, thank you. Have a nice day." And it was quiet again.
"God, Cas... see how fucking hot you are?" Dean groaned and he thrusted roughly against him, eyes glued to their image. He watched Cas rocking with every movement, the pleasure and want clear across his features in the same way they were across his.
"Hello Castiel." Ellen smiled. "And who's this?" She asked, looking at Dean.
Castiel would cry but he had no more tears to cry, they were all washed away in the water when he had to let go. Dean held onto Cas, taking his warmth from him. This was much better than him freezing not long ago and much more comfortable. He felt safe.
Dean perked, propping himself up on his elbows. "Hmm, what kind of reward?" He asked with a grin, definitely thinking that any reward from Cas would make homework more interesting.
Dean smiled against Cas's lips, leaning forward slightly as Cas pulled away. He licked his lips as well, slowly opening his eyes to meet his. "It is pretty good. Probably the best bowl of ice cream ever." He said with a grin.
Castiel lets Dean hold him, to calm his nerves, the longer he was human, the more he understood touches. He longed for them, just a sense of comfort, reassurance, he craved them. Sometimes in different forms and usually they are all from Dean. It took him a while but after he kept getting hurt and Dean would embrace him, he learned how to wrap his arms tightly around the hunter.
"Yeah? Do I look cool?" Castiel laughed. He could feel his hair sticking up. "I would have to put gel in my hair more often if I style it and then more showers. That's a lot of work." He complained with a smile. "I wouldn't want to do that." he said.
Also I didn't proof read, so....if there's weird stuff in it, lemme know.
"He definitely sounded like the type, nothin' wrong with that." Benny smiled. "But if you'd like, I'd really help ya out Dean. I'd talk to Cas so this Balthazar won't do anything to far." he said.
Gabriel looked at Dean, "Your choice." he said as he went back to Charlie.
Castiel laughed a little at his kisses, wrinkling his nose slightly. He licked his lips a little, smiling. "It's okay. We have all night." he said happily. "Well until dinner." he added. He tilted his head to let Dean kiss him more easily, putting his arms around Dean loosely.
Dean Winchester: *Looks at Cas and smiles* Yes it does. It makes me feel a whole lot better.
Castiel glanced back at him with a smile, "I had the best cereal at your house." He said before turning forward again. "I think we should make omelets. Sound good?" He asked.
Castiel smiled at him before taking his phone and rearranging the cookies slightly and taking some pictures. He got them before he turned slightly to Dean and took a picture of him. He checked the picture and laughed a little. "I want this picture too then." he said.
"Thanks. She is pretty great, huh?" Dean replied proudly. "She drives just how I remember. Except now I'm actually legal to drive, and she's mine." He said with a chuckle, enjoying the freedom of the almost empty road and speeding up some more.
"...That's what the pizza man taught me." Castiel said softly. "I...I didn't watch much more after that."
"What did you a Lisa do when I was asleep?" Castiel tried to keep the panic out of his voice but with the time period in between and Dean smelling so much like Lisa made him scared that maybe they got back together or they mated while he was sleeping. He climbed up Dean's arm and immediately started to check him over.
Dean followed Cas as he leaned back onto the bed, keeping the contact between them. He saw Cas blush a little more and smiled, breaking off their kiss for a moment to kiss his cheek before returning his lips against Cas's. He positioned his hands on either side of Cas to hold himself up, still leaning slightly into him.
"Sam. You just have to trust me on this. I'm perfectly healthy and I'm okay, isn't that what matters?" Dean sighed.
Dean smiled before heading off. He was thinking of when he first met Cas and he felt a nice warm feeling settle in him. He spent longer than he thought with Cas, but he didn't even notice. He didn't even mind. He drove back to the boat and waited for Sam.
Charlie shrugged, "Maybe, but who knows. I might get something out of him." She said. "He's like a new slate, it's kind of endearing and a bit odd." She thought about it.
Castiel felt Dean tense up from underneath him, he lightly stirred and blinked awake. He rubbed his eyes a little as his eyes adjusted. He looked up at Dean, "Dean?" he said quietly before he yawned, "What's wrong...?" he asked.
Happy 20Quarantine! After fucking years of not writing fucking shit, i wrote the epilogue to finish this series. -confetti-
Castiel didn't look up at him, "No. I don't." he replied curtly. "I can handle myself." he climbed back into the sink to peel the shrimp.
"I would be very touch deprived. I don't think I would stop myself from kissing you in school if that happened." Castiel told him. "I think us living together has spoiled us." he laughed lightly. "We know what's it like to sleep, eat, shower, waking up together, etc. It would be hard to go back." he said.
Dean smiled. "Well, they're not too hard. And even if I did screw them up somehow, we can just drench them in syrup." He laughed, flipping the last one. "But I think they'll be good."
Castiel smiled, accepting the kiss. "It does, but if I didn't want that as a reward what would you give me?" he asked with a light laugh. He sipped on more of the water, glancing over at Dean. The water made him feel a lot better than before so he was awake.
Dean smiled softly, listening to Cas sing. "You know all the words?" He asked in surprise, looking down at him. He wondered how often Cas had listened to the music. He realized that he hadn't had anything to remember Cas by, and he tightened his hold on him slightly.
Dean smiled, relieved that Cas had been able to take the bite and stay relaxed and happy. "I like being alone with both of my loves." He replied with a grin, taking another bite. "Although this one's not gonna last much longer." He added, glancing down at the nearly finished slice.
"Not even if I was here to play with you?" Castiel said casually.
Castiel thought he was going to face plant the floor. “How about you just sit down?” he said softly. He led Dean over to the corner area. The lounge like area for when Castiel feels tired of practicing and paperwork. He gently sat Dean down, “There you go.”
"Yes, we just threw out the trash not long before you came." Gabriel snorted.
"Cas, I brought someone over." Dean told him.
"I get lazy and I'm not usually here. Plus Cassie had a knack for it and enjoys it so why burst his bubble?" Gabriel shrugged.
Charlie gaped, "Wha-I.." she looked at Kevin. "You really do make a cute girl though..." she said. "You're just really cute in general, like Cassie over there." she laughed lightly.
“Not today Cas. I didn’t bring my gear.” Dean told him. “But you’ll have me tomorrow and the rest of the week.”
Dean laughed at the look on Cas's face at being hit before making another snowball. He managed to block Cas's hit with with his arm but it broke apart and showered him in snow. He grinned and crouched down, hastily forming some more balls and sneaking around the impala to try to catch Cas by surprise and threw a few snowballs at him.
Dean got ready for bed before crawling in behind Cas, scooting in next to him and opening his arms invitingly. He wanted to make up for making Cas so upset earlier, and he knew cuddling would be a good way to do it.
Dean grinned. "Well, I liked teaching you to defend yourself and to shoot, and I really liked teaching what came after that." He replied with a chuckle.
Anna was going to say something before Gabriel spoke up first in a flat tone. "Anna go get Castiel." he said.
"No, no buddy." Dean said quickly. "I wouldn't kick you out, I just couldn't keep you here. There's no place to keep you and the water would be the only place left for you to swim freely and have a place to stay. I would still come visit you, every now again when I go diving."
Everyone got into a line and stood there for a second. "5. 5...6...7...8" the guy counted and everyone in a line did a back hand spring right after each other. They stood back where they were and the guy counted again. This time everyone did a backtuck. "Alright last time, your choice." he said.
"Are you sure you even want to go through with that?" Kevin asked. "We just started." he said.
Castiel smiled back at him, "I'll come back tomorrow, Goodbye Sam." he said politely.
"Good. I'll be cooking other things while you do that." she said as she ran warm water and put the bowl of shrimp under it and turned it off after it filled up.
Dean watched Cas take the first few bites of everything, grinning when he smiled and said he enjoyed it. "I'm glad you like it." He replied, grabbing some toast and smearing peanut butter on it. "I think this proves that I should leave the cooking to you, but it's the thought that counts, right?" He said with a chuckle, eating through the toast and taking the other glass of orange juice.
Castiel shivered, making soft sounds. He clenched involuntarily at nothing when Dean kissed the ring. He clutched the tub, nodding. He knelt up a bit more, still settling slightly embarrassed but wanting that feeling.
"That's what I'm saying, he hasn't done anything!" Dean replied. "I dunno why, but people just target him." He shook his head slightly. "He doesn't deserve the shit people give him."
Bobby shook his head slightly, surprised. "You cook and get Dean to do school work- I hope you do too." He said with a chuckle.
Castiel rubbed his thumb across Dean's knuckles, "You know, when we held hands here. I noticed how much bigger your hands were, they were a little rough and that they had freckles on them too." he chuckled.
Charlie hummed before an idea came to her, "Don't people play games that need a lot of people like truth or dare, would you rather, never have I ever, you know those types of games." she offered.
Castiel watched him go, trying hard not for his eyes to trail down the man’s back. He needed to go home and sleep.
Kevin looked over at Charlie, "...I'm sorry Charlie. Every hero needs a sidekick." he said.
"No, I dont want you to go through that again." Dean replied as they walked. "I don't want you to cry from being upset, but there's nothing wrong with crying." He added, thinking of when Cas had cried on Christmas Eve- although that had been fueled by a very different kind of emotion.
Again, Dean kissed him before slipping his fingers back into Castiel, rubbing his slick all over his inner walls. Castiel panted heavily, barely able to focus on the kiss as Dean put his third finger in, pumping them in and out of him.
Sam glanced between Dean and Cas, then looked over at Bobby. Dean really wanted Cas to stay, and he could see that. Break wasn't that long. Bobby sighed, "Okay, fine. He can stay over the break, but after that...we'll figure out something." He said.
A slight shiver ran up Deans spine as Cas pulled at his hair. He hadn't quite realized just how much he'd missed the feel of Cas pressed against him. He ran his hand up over Cas's pants before resting lightly on his hip, just under the hem of his shirt so that Dean could drag his fingertips lightly across his skin.
"Make your own walls first before sticking it together. Then it won't break." Said Sam.
Dean looked startled at the thought, "No way Sammy! Who knows what they'll do to him! What if they do some freaky tests and he gets made into like a handbag or whatever?! No, if I'm going to let him go. It'll be back to the water, his home." he denied.
Castiel made a sad sound in Dean's neck, he squeezed Dean tightly. "But today was the first time you did...today was the first time I saw them back...it's not okay..." he replied. "I was being so cautious but it didn't even work." he let out a shaky breath.
Castiel squealed and started moving his limbs around in excitement and reached for her. Lisa held out her hand and he jumped up and climbed up her arm. Dean watched and he felt...jealous. He should feel happy that Cas is making friends with Lisa but he felt jealous that he was reacting like that around someone else besides him, but he didn't know that. He just brushed off his feelings and smiled at seeing them together.
"That would be only right. You can't really see much of yourself or examine yourself that closely, where I can see you all the time so I see things that you overlook because it's always there. There's always tiny aspects about someone that someone else will see but you'll forget because it's just a part of you. You can only really see yourself twice. Once in a picture and in the mirror. You don't get to see yourself constantly like I can, the way you smile, the way you look at me, the small expressions you have, the gestures you do, all the small details that you cannot see and overlook, I see. So if you overlook them, I'll be here to tell you what I see." Castiel smiled at him. "Every aspect of you, if you think it's a flaw or not is perfect to me."
Castiel nodded, looking at the house before slowly turning back to look at the car. He caught glimpse of something in the garden. He turned to look at it, he froze.."...Lucifer..." He breathed out.
Castiel: Well usually I arrive at around 4. I don't have much to do on the afternoons, so I have a lot of free time.
Dean grinned proudly, turning back to face Cas. He blew the end of the barrel and laughed, enjoying his praise. "It just takes practice. I've been doing this for years." He replied.
Castiel smiled, "Come closer. I want to hug you." he said softly. "I want to cuddle." he laughed lightly. "I still need to put on clothes eventually and get out of bed." he noted.
Castiel gripped the railing as much as he could with his free hand, trying to keep himself up. He stood up a bit straigher and leaned his head against the railing before his free hand snuck up his shirt and he started pulling on his nipple and Castiel whimpered, staring over to where Dean's balcony was before he looked down as he went back to fucking himself with the toy.
Dean moaned into Cas's mouth at the hair tugging before he broke off their kiss to lavish at his neck again. His hand dipped beneath the water again, tracing down Cas's side and along his thigh before moving around to hold his ass. Dean pressed against Cas, though not hard enough to make the edge of the pool hurt against Cas's back.
Castiel moaned, trying to indulge into the kiss but also wanting to savor the feeling of Dean's fingers in him. He moved his legs more apart, shifting them slightly. He felt Dean brush his fingers by his prostate and he whined at the pure pleasure that shot up his spine. It was like the first time he ever felt it and it was addicting. He moved his hips against Dean's fingers, trying to chase the feeling.
"Yeah, I definitely didn't think I was a cuddle person." Dean replied with a chuckle. "But I didn't think I'd be the kind of guy for a lot of the lovey-dovey stuff we do, but I like doing it with you." He said, smiling and giving Cas a slight squeeze.
"So, so worth it...Promise.." Castiel replied. He didn't tell Dean about the plug or the heart on the back of the panties, he would have to be here to know. He rolled his hips a little, feeling the plug move. He wondered briefly if he should should turn it on. He decided to when it was closer for Dean to come home.
Castiel was the next to wake up, not long after Gabriel left. He slowly blinked awake, stretching out slightly. He looked at Dean who was wrapped around him, he was sleeping peacefully. Castiel smiled a little, kissing Dean's cheek before slowly getting up. He pulled the blankets back over Dean and started toward the door to go get food ready. He saw Gabriel and Anna once he opened the door. They both looked at him and called him out. Castiel looked back at Dean before leaving like Gabriel did.
"What can I say, I have a weakness for pie." Dean replied with a chuckle. "It's not as good as yours, though." He said.
Dean hugs Castiel tightly and as carefully as he can without hurting his new wound. He sees the scars, the cuts, the blisters, the pain of what this new life has done to him. His voice shakes as he holds Castiel.
Castiel talked to Dean for a moment, nodding a bit before he said okay and hung up. He looked back at Dean, "I have to go home now. Gabriel wants me to make him some sweets for his coworkers." he said. "I suppose I'll see you on monday?" he added slowly, unsure on what to say to Dean now.
"Well, it was the first time I started having feelings for a guy which freaked me out a little at first." Dean replied with a chuckle. "And everything about you that gave me those feelings in the first place were pretty distracting." He added.
Dean felt Cas clinging on to him, knowing he was still afraid. He held him tightly, hoping that school wouldn't be too bad. There hadn't been too many issues with bullying for a while before school had let out, but Cas had also been gone for almost a month. If he'd been protective over Cas before, he was going to be even more so when they got back. Dean hadn't been able to protect Cas from all the bullies, his attackers, or even from his own father, but he wasn't going to let this keep happening. He was determined to be better, to be the sort of person Cas deserved.
Dean grinned and shook his head slightly, finding Cas's shyness incredibly endearing but also feeling an urge to replace his light blush with a full flush of pleasure. He didn't reply but instead closed the space between them, moving his hand around the back of Cas's neck to pull him into a rough kiss.
"Yeah, we can see. We're lucky you guys don't cupcake in front of us." Charlie laughed. "Didn't tag you as cheesy though, so it's definitely adorable to see you like that, melts my heart." She said.
Dean thought for a moment, looking between Cas's eyes. "Honestly, I don't know. I'm not exactly an expert on long distance relationships, and I don't have any idea what it's going to be like when we're 81." He replied with a slight frown. "But I do know that nothing's going to change how I feel about you. I know that I'm not going to meet anyone else that will ever make me feel the way you do. I know that I love you, and I always will." He continued, ending with a soft smile.
Dean smiled against his lips as he kissed Cas. "So bossy." He murmured with a chuckle for the brief moment he broke the kiss. He pulled Cas closer and brought their lips together again with a smile, running his hand up his back to rest against his neck.
Castiel leaned in to take the spoonful but leaned to the side a little so it would come off the side of his mouth. He slowly melted the ice cream in his mouth before he swallowed it. He looked over at Dean again, "Yes, but you taste sweeter with ice cream on your lips." he said.
Castiel shook his head, "No, you can't move away. You have to stay close, somewhere I can reach you. Don't go….don't go where I can't follow or see you again…" he whimpered.
“May I sit here?” Castiel asked Anna.
Castiel was looking at Dean again with that soft look, the ones that he does whenever Dean touches his heart and makes it flutter wildly in his chest. Dean always melted away his worries and doubts, it was always so loving. He turned his hand in Dean's and held onto it. "I guess I'm not the only one one opens their arms to catch them when they doubt." he said softly. He just kind of stared at Dean for a moment, not really able to say anything. He didn't have words.
Castiel glanced at Dean to see how alert he was and he walked closer to Dean and held his pinkie again. "It's okay Dean." he said softly. People in the hallway were clearly avoiding them, not looking at them but talking quietly to themselves and pressing to the lockers. They were still riled up and scared of what Balthazar did. Most of them were looking at Castiel, gossiping.
Castiel let out a shaky breath, putting his head on Dean's back. He swallowed, "I...I don't want to go anymore..." He said quietly.
Dean smiled softly, releasing one of Cas's hands so that he could tenderly brush away the tears that fell. "You're more than welcome. That was amazing." He replied quietly, resting gently against Cas and feeling perfectly content.
"He's still sleeping." He told her as he sat back down.
"Sound like a challenge to me." Dean replied with a jaunty grin. "We're on the same side, but I bet I could take you."
Castiel looked down at him, “Go to sleep Dean.” he said, tossing a blanket over him and brushing his hair.
Castiel glanced at Dean, "I was half expecting you to actually not listen to me. I wouldn't have been mad, a little sad if you were hurt but not exactly mad. I'm happy you chose not to engage in a fight Dean. I wouldn't want you to be in trouble." he told him.
Castiel nodded, rubbing his eyes from whatever was left. He looked up at Dean, "I cry a lot huh?" he commented. "I'll be sure to talk to you whenever I get nervous or scared..." he told him. "I don't want to go through that again..." he said.
Dean's eyes fluttered open to meet Cas's as he broke apart. "So? That's never bothered me before. And this time I have a good reason." He replied breathlessly, smiling slightly as his eyes flicked down Cas's face before meeting his eyes again. "You're really going to do that and then send me off to school?"
"Yeah, I think Sam has the right idea. Thanks, though." Bobby said with a chuckle, taking his upstairs as well.
Castiel lifted Dean's hips just slightly, pressing the toy to his entrance. He held it there for a moment, looking up at Dean once again for the reassurance. Once he got it, he slowly pushed it in, he rubbed Dean's hip with his thumb as he did. Each of the beads dipped in, slowly disappearing until he had it settle at the base and just left it there to let Dean adjust. He grabbed the panties and slipped them onto Dean, having some of the lube drip onto it. Castiel seemed pretty pleased on how this turned out. He could see Dean's erection straining, red and flushing against his stomach. He wiped the top of it, smearing away the pre-come.
At first, Dean hadn't been too worried- maybe Cas was just sick or finding out more about what was going on with the company- but his worry started to increase as Cas didn't respond to any of his texts or answer any of the calls he made after school. He still tried to make himself believe that everything could still be fine, making up all sorts of excuses as to why he miss a day of school and not mention anything to him. But then Cas was gone the next day. And the next.
"What has changed?" Castiel asked, looking over at Dean with a small smile. They didn't come here often and it's been a few months since they've been to it again. It was colder now and the leaves were changing. This is where Dean kissed him for the first time. "We kissed in a tree, that sounds cliche and romantic." He said.
Castiel didn't say anything in return, he was too wrapped up in his own head. Dean didn't want Cas out of his sight for even a moment. He texted Sam really quickly before sitting there in silence with Cas.
Gabriel was making kissy faces at Dean, chuckling a little. "I already told you, I'm here to say hello." he said. "You didn't answer my question Cassie!" he said.
Dean watched Cas lick the cream off of his finger, now getting much more interested in tasting some of the cream. "Really, you won't share for anything? What about a trade?" He offered, wondering if that would interest Cas enough.
"Who's boyfriend is that?" Some girl asked.
"It can use a little work but I think it turned out a lot nicer than all my previous drawings. You must be my muse. I have already told you this...so you /are/ my muse." Castiel smiled at him, looking at him fondly.
Castiel chuckled before he leaned over and took the forkful. He sat back in his seat, "I think that's just you." he teased as he chewed the piece of pie.
Castiel held onto the ball and put his fingers over the lace like Dean demonstrated. "Then do I just throw it?" He asked. "What are these ridges for?"
"Well, you have Charlie and Kevin, plus Benny now. And I know we're a lot more than friends, but I'm your friend too." Dean replied with a shrug. "It'll be good though, one more person in our group now. Well, maybe. I haven't known him that long, but he seems pretty cool." He continued, wanting to keep talking just to fill the empty space between them.
Dean grinned as he drove, stealing a glance sideways at Cas. "Well, hopefully no one will notice, and you and me will be the only ones who know." He replied, admittedly enjoying knowing that Cas was feeling the same sort of excitement. Dean knew how it felt, especially the first few times, and he figured Cas would like it once he got over the initial paranoia that someone would know.
Dean nodded. "It does. It feels like we've spent everyday together for the past year." He replied, wondering when they would get to spend that time together again. "So you don't know how long Raphael's staying, but once he leaves, will we go back to how we were?" Dean asked. He didn't want to say back to normal, because in reality 'normal' was how their lives were without each other, and he didn't want to go back to that.
"Ah! Dean!" Castiel moaned loudly, cumming almost immediately after Dean said for him to. His body just let itself go on his command and he came over their stomach and chests as he tipped his head back and held onto Dean's shoulder, clenching down hard. His mouth hung open as his eyes squeezed close when he moaned.
"You seemed more concerned about him and it really didn't matter what happened." Balthazar shrugged.
Dean smiled and rested his head against Cas's. "Of course I'll take care of you. Plus the rougher I am, the nicer I think I should be afterwards. We have a pretty good system." He chuckled lightly.
"And this is why I'm thankful I am a boy." Kevin replied.
Dean's breathing came in ragged gasps, completely overwhelmed by the intense bursts of pleasure but still wanting more. He moaned shamelessly, understanding now how difficult it would be to try to stay silent- he could hardly focus on anything other than the sensations Cas was giving him.
"No, I'm not his lover." Lisa replied. "We're friends, but we used to be." she answered.
"Well I'd be happy to practice with you whenever you want." Dean murmured with a grin. He felt warm and comfortable, but above everything else he felt happy, content even. He couldn't think of anything he'd rather be doing.
"I want to put the head on." Charlie told them. Sam sighed a bit before picking her up and her putting it on with a grin. "Thanks moose." she said.
Dean smiled slightly, knowing exactly what Cas meant. Despite being tired from their activities in the pool, he was already looking looking forward to it. "If you ever want to ask that question, just assume the answer is yes." he replied with a chuckle, following Cas into the bathroom.
"Oh no, I'm a lesbian." Charlie told him. Kevin shrugged.
Castiel had his eyes closed, calming his breathing before opening his eyes a little to look up at Dean. He smiled a little, enjoying Dean running his fingers through his hair. He was catching his thoughts again, "'M' glad..." he murmured. He was tired now, feeling pliant and sated. He nuzzled more into Dean, feeling sweaty now. "Wash cloth..." he said softly.
Dean sat up, staying next to Cas and arching a brow at Gabriel. "Hmm, I dunno how much I trust you with dares." He joked. "But uncensored is more fun. To a certain point." He said with a grin. "Just don't scar anyone."
"Well, I'm not exactly doing anything else, so if you want to we can. I'm kind of interested to see you draw." Dean admitted, curious of how it would come out. "Especially a drawing of me." He added with a grin.
"That's good- any progress is." Dean replied with a smile, glancing down at Cas's hand. He didn't move any closer, letting Cas set the space between them, and he rested his hand on Cas's shoulder.
Castiel leaned against his hand a bit before glancing up at him. He slowly moved the dark cat into Dean's lap. "Then you'll have this cat." He said softly. He smiled a little. "Then we'll both have something."
"Hey, if Cas is the one writing them, of course I'll read the books." Dean replied. "And yep, number one fan already." He added with a chuckle, though he really did like the things he'd read in Cas's notebook and such.
Castiel laughed lightly, carrying the basket down the stairs. "How do you do your laundry here?" he asked. He wasn't sure how Dean did his laundry, he knew that everyone in his house did theirs different. Separated colors, bleached, soft to delicate, softener, etc. "Do you have a washer and dryer here?" he asked, glancing over at Dean.
Castiel was more than gone. He turned onto his side and just laid there as he panted. He didn't ever register the cum leaking out of him. He felt the light sheen of sweat on him but that was it. No thought even could process on his mind. He was blissfully high with pleasure.
"Cas, I know you're scared, but it's okay." He said, managing to keep the desperation out of his voice. "You're safe. I'm not going to let anyone hurt you."
Castiel giggled, smiling at Dean's soft kisses. They kind of tickled. He felt Dean kiss him back on the lips. He hugged Dean closer, filled with affection and adoration.
Castiel nodded slightly, not saying much on that comment. He started cleaning up the table and putting the dishes up together. "How are you going to get home Dean?" he asked.
"You look well. Seems that you aren't struggling with eating that much are you now? You look very dashing tonight." Balthazar complimented.
Castiel laughed a little, "Maybe some other day, when we haven't been on this late streak." he said. He smiled a little, "Glad you like it." he said, picking up little pieces of his food and eating it.
Dean moaned softly into his mouth, scooting up a little to give him easier access to Cas and moving his legs so that they were entwined with his. He was enjoying himself immensely, but he made sure he was thinking about time. As much as he would love to stay like this with Cas, he had to keep up with his plan.
"Whichever one you want Dean." Castiel smiled before picking up the bunny and the pictures and held them. "Which one looks the most appealing?" He asked.
"Oh, I definitely want to take you to the bedroom. It's not fair that you can make putting away dishes look so sexy in those jeans." Dean replied, kissing Cas's neck again. "So let's go lock ourselves in and not come out for a while." He suggested with a smirk.
“Hmm...never thought about it like that.” Dean commented thoughtfully. They heard a groan and shifting, both of them looking over to Sam’s figure. “I think he’ll be up soon too. I’ll get started on some breakfast meals so we can do a lot of exploring today.” he offered.
"No. They probably just have the wrong desk." Balthazar replied calmly.
Dean glanced up, that afternoon's events rushing back to him. He managed to push his failure to sort things out to the back of his mind, but now the guilt was back. "It's not gonna be nice though. My talk with the guy didn't exactly work out." He said, suppressing a sigh. "We'll have to figure something else out."
"Maybe we should invite Charlie and Kevin over to come help us." Sam offered.
"Then why won't you let me examine that area?" Castiel asked with a hint of frustration.
Castiel let the words sink it, letting it wash over his nerves and doubts that he has been feeling since he started talking, he tilted his head a little with a slight smile. He leaned over and kissed Dean on the cheek. "I know... Thank you Dean." He said. "Bringing you here was very special to me. So I hope you like this place." He swung his legs slightly over the side. He felt extremely nervous when he was done, scared that if he looked over at Dean, he would have looked at him with disgust or pity. That he was far too much trouble for just one person, but the look in Dean's eyes when he finally met his gaze washed those thoughts away. There was anger there, sadness, but there was also the determination in his eyes that looked like he would do everything in his power to protect him. That is what made him relax and know that Dean was the safe place he could come to. It would be hard for him to remember, but somewhere in the back of his mind, he'll know.
"That's true, you definitely distract me just as much. If not more." Dean replied, bumping their foreheads together gently. "But I'm definitely not complaining."
"Sure, if you guys got me a whole pie, the least I can do is cut the cake." Dean replied with a chuckle, taking a knife and cutting it into fairly even pieces for them. "There, that's pretty good." He decided approvingly.
Dean had a gingerbread one with little white stitching. Castiel tilted his head again, opening up his and it was a blue one with snowflakes and snowmen. "I don't believe they are ugly." he said. He put it on over his clothes and like Kevin, it was slightly big on him. The sleeves draped over his hands. He pulled on the ends to look at it. "I like it. Thank you Sam." he smiled.
Dean felt Cas move his hips forward and returned with equal pressure. He ground against Cas and tugged at his lower lip with his teeth, sucking it as well. The normal rush of heat he felt when he kissed Cas like this was intensified by his still-roiling emotions, determined to prove to himself that Cas really was his as much as he was Cas's. His hands moved around to untuck Cas's shirt, fingers trailing across his skin hungrily.
"Fix it. Stop fucking sulking." he told him and he went back upstairs and closed the door.
"Duh, You don't go on a rescue mission with guns ablazing without a plan. That's like a suicide mission and I like to win." Gabriel grinned. He sat down next to Charlie watching her work as everyone did what they're supposed to. "Oh and Dean, since you said that Raphael caught him last time talking on the phone, it would probably be better if you don't texted him because Raphael could actually text you back if he has Castiel's phone. Calling would be a risk but he wouldn't know." he said.
Dean smiled, feeling relieved that he'd been able to erase Cas's doubts. "We're here for each other." He replied, stroking his thumb across Cas's knuckles before kissing Cas softly. He never wanted Cas to think that he didn't compare to him, because to him it was Cas who constantly outshone him. He felt like he was playing catch up, but he didn't mind it.
Dean sighed in exasperation, figuring he should have known Cas wouldn't let it go that easily. "Of course I don't think I'm more than enough for you." He snapped, his frustrations finally bubbling over. "Of course I'm going to wonder how I could ever be enough for you when there's charming bastards like Balthazar running around trying to impress you. I'm not exactly a catch, Cas, and I know that. You haven't had other relationship experience, so maybe you don't realize it, but there are so many people that would be better for you. I love you, and I know you love me, but I'm nothing special. I calm you down, I take care of you and all that. But that's what couples are supposed to do. I just-" he broke off with a sigh and ran his hand through his hair, exasperation leaving as suddenly as it had come. "I just can't help but think that the reason we work so well is that I just happened to be lucky enough to realize how amazing you are first."
"See now the world is back in order." Charlie laughed. "Well with one new exception. Now I get to question you." she said as she looked over at Benny.
"I love being this close." Castiel smiled at him. He continued to brush back Dean's hair, he could feel Dean's heartbeat. He let out a soft breath, he leaned down again and kissed Dean softly. "I love you." he said quietly.
"I think it would be a good idea to start on dinner then. You will be hungry by the time we're done." Castiel told him. He gathered his clothes and slowly started putting on his cleaner ones. He toweled off his hair one last time before looking back at Dean, "Coming to help Assistant chef?" he smiled.
Sam nodded, "Yeah. We got mexican food this time." he said. "We also stopped by to grab pillows and blankets, just in case you guys were okay with them staying." he added.
Charlie laughed, "Girls love tall guys but not towers." she teased.
Castiel chuckled, "You can get me back in later rounds." he said.
"It was pretty good." Dean replied, feeling happier than he had all day knowing that Cas wouldn't have Balthazar in every single class. "I met this one guy, Benny. He seems pretty cool, I bet you'd like him. So he's going to eat lunch with us today." He said, figuring to give Cas a heads up.
Castiel hummed before rummaging through Dean's drawer and finding the little book and flipping through it. He put a lot of task that they have done together but also things he thought they might want to do together in the future. Simple task as a long embrace, paid in kisses, brushing your hair until you fall asleep, singing to you, a date, a pie, any dinner you wanted, etc etc. There was a lot in the little booklet. When it came to the back of the book for more personal and intimate things, he had to do some research and find things that would be suitable.
Castiel's head lolled a bit, he was barely with Dean to know what he was doing. He had dry tears on his face, streaks of spit. He just fell asleep in between each action, trying to stay up but he dropped his head back onto Dean's shoulder and laid there.
"Cas. I'm not gonna get tired of you. Gabriel and Anna might think I stole you and come kill me in my sleep, but other than that you can stay as long as you want." Dean replied. "I'm serious. If you manage to not get sick of me, I definitely won't be tired of you."
Dean laughed and looked at the cat that supposedly looked like him. He didn't see the resemblance, but that would explain why he'd wanted it so badly. "I dunno about that one, but the black one definitely looks like Cas." He replied, smiling.
"Cas, be nice." Dean scolded.
Don't drink and Drive people, it's not safe, even if it's just a little. Don't be like these fictional characters.
"That's because you are cute." Dean replied with an unapologetic shrug. "But fine, fine, I guess you don't want to be late." He resigned, starting to walk again beside Cas. At least the tension seemed to be gone.
Castiel pressed his lips together slightly, he wasn't all too sure how to ignore them. He had a hard time to. "I can try. I'm not sure if I can but I can try." He said. "Do you think I should? Do you think I'll be able to?" He asked.
"So snappy Lis. This is my kitchen, so what are you going to do about it?" Dean teased.
Of course, Dean’s stomach growled, reminding the two what was happening before this whole instigation. Dean laughed a bit, “I should probably whip up some dinner.” he said, brushing back Castiel’s hair slightly.
"You guys are fucking assholes! I'm going to call the cops!" The cashier took out his phone and started dialing 911, the guy with the buzz hair picked up whatever he could find and hit him upside the head. It was a wood plank. "You fucker, if you call. We'll all get in trouble." he seethed.
“Just reminding you just in case that head of yours is injured.” Benny smiled slightly.
Castiel nodded, "Okay. I will." he said before going back to eating. He ate the burger appreciatively, enjoying how it came out. Everything came out really well and it made him really happy. The thoughts of what happened earlier wasn't in his mind anymore.
Charlie dug her knuckles into his hair, "What was that Kevin? What am I?" she asked as she tortured him.
"Oh, that's cool, I'm glad you got a chance to write a little." Dean replied. "And yeah, I got everything on the list- I'm pretty sure." He added with a chuckle.
"I like having you this close." Dean murmured, turning slightly to kiss his head lightly. "And you're definitely comfortable. Like a big, soft pillow, but nicer and warm." He said, chuckling slightly.
Dean grinned smugly, sitting down beside Cas. "Trust me, I know. Lemme guess, one of the best things you've ever had, right?" He asked, taking one as well and trying it. "Cas, I don't know how you do it." He said in wonder, taking another bite.
"Sure, we already share most of my shirts." He answered with a laugh. "And I think you look awesome in plaid." Dean replied with a smile, pulling Cas closer to him. "Especially right- there." He said, poking Cas's side and wriggling his fingers against him.
Castiel chuckled, after finish washing the last of the broccoli. "Yes I do, I would like you to cut the chicken, but in diagonal slices. The concept is the same but you have your hand at the end this time and you cut under it." he said. He hummed lightly, "Do you a rice cooker here?" he asked.
Lisa nodded just a little before setting aside the blanket, "Dean, I think I should go home. I just remembered about things I have to do." she told him.
Sam nodded, "Yeah let's just go home." He said.
Castiel grinned at Dean, "Would you like to start her?" he asked after Dean closed the hood of his car.
"Any weather is ice cream weather." Charlie grinned. "Besides we don't even know what we're going to eat or where." She said.
"Please." Castiel nodded. "I didn't realize how much I needed to drink some before I took a sip." He explained. "Your cooking isn't bad. It's not bad at all. It's actually quite good for someone who doesn't cook regularly." He said.
Kevin looked at him with a shocked looked, "Wow you're not kidding. Why the hell would he even do that?" he said in a disgusted tone. "How am I supposed to help anyways? I'm just an AP student." he said.
"Okay," Dean replied, standing and keeping his grip on Cas's hand. He felt so secluded here, completely set apart from any of the problems waiting for them beyond the woods. He could understand why Cas would come here to escape; it really was a sanctuary, with an air of security in the serenity it provided.
Dean gripped Cas's upper thigh tightly as he started to rock against Cas, arching up and laying down to get the most movement as he pushed and pulled Cas against him. He broke off their kiss and panted heavily, grunting slightly with each thrust.
Bobby looked at him questioningly as he got a few for himself. "How much are you making him feed you, Dean?" He asked with a chuckle.
Why the hell had he let Cas clean there, out of everywhere else in his room? The one place that seemed to have the one thing he'd most like to keep hidden under a pile of laundry. "I, uh..." Dean started, feeling a flush creep to his cheeks. "They're- I mean, sort of." He said, not having any idea how he was going to explain this.
"Can't I?" Castiel glanced at him.
Sam sighed, "Now I feel lonely. I don't have someone to bicker with or whatever." he said.
"Yeah. It's been a really long time huh?" Samandriel commented.
"Why would we?" Kevin asked.
Gabriel grinned, "Alright, truth or dare huh?" he said.
"No running off to another city?" He joked. "Nah, that's okay, a nap sounds good to me." Dean replied, loosening his hold on Cas to allow him to step away.
Castiel shook his head in Dean's neck, still blushing so he didn't want to come out. He peeped a glance at Dean before hiding away again. "No reason..." he mumbled. He look back at Dean before breathing softly, "Maybe...maybe because I..." he blushed again and hid his face again. "Cause I think about it and I don't think we're ready for it but I still think about us getting married." he said in one go before just burying his face into Dean's neck and not moving.
"Right okay. You seem like the guy who flirts with everyone so I don't see how you wouldn't fit right in the normal cafeteria with a bunch of friends." Charlie told him.
Kevin took one cup and sipped on some, "Not bad." he said. "Still tastes like alcohol but it's not that bad." he said. Castiel took a cup and took a tasting sip, he gently licked the side of his lip.
Castiel smiled, "Sounds perfect." He said. He actually was a bit sticky and sweaty but it was okay. He didn't really mind, but the thought of moving didn't sound very easy at that moment. His legs still felt a little like jelly. He traced little shapes onto Dean's chest. "Movin' sounds hard." He commented.
"You know, I heard that he got kicked out of his previous schools." one student started.
Benny laughed, "Little late to the game, but I'm glad y'all accepted me into yer group." he said.
Sam was already waiting, figuring to take the backseat. Castiel took the front seat and buckled in. They were off to drive more into town where all the bars and liquor stores were. "What do you think he'll be wearing?" Castiel asked, looking at the people as they drove by to see if they would catch a glimpse of him.
Castiel nodded slightly, "Okay...I suppose we'll have to try tomorrow, but I still have to face him regardless tomorrow even if it did work. Where would I go if I didn't go? The nurse?" he asked.
"Nuh uh." Gabriel stuck his tongue out.
Castiel didn't sleep for a while, just holding Dean before he drifted to sleep. It won't be long before he had to get up again to get food for Dean for breakfast. He didn't know if Dean has eaten but he'll take care of Dean. He will. This time.
Castiel hugged Dean again, "I don't know if you're being cheesy or the term, flirting." He chuckled. He smiled, "Though I do enjoy both, mostly since they're coming from you." He replied.
One of Castiel's hand flew over his mouth as he squeeze his eyes shut, arching back. His hand clutched Dean's shoulder and he muffled his moan. He panted through his hand, it was so difficult to be quiet. He had to think about being quiet and it was hard to think in general. He wondered slightly how Dean was able to keep so quiet when he was teasing him because this took a lot of sheer willpower.
Dean laughed a little himself, "Neither do it. I was actually thinking of finding someone else who might have an Enochian and maybe helping me out with Cas, figuring him out." he said.
Castiel: Okay, I got this. *swings and this time he actually gets it right*
"Potato skins. It's filling and a food you can eat with your hands." He said as he cooked them. "I'm not putting anything on them except seasoning to let everyone choose what they put on it." He said. He looked back at Dean, "Do you want to help me make sandwiches?" He asked.
Castiel looked delighted as he took the book, he smiled and held the book to his chest. "Thank you, I've wanted to try some recipes. I'll be sure to attempt some." he said happily.
"We should swing by when we're close to having to go because I don't want you to see me change." Castiel bounced a little. "I want to impress you like they do in books. The moment your date takes your breath away. I want to do that." he said excited. "Can we do that? I won't see you change either if you want. You can just bring it over and we'll change separately." he offered. "I mean...we don't have to if you don't want to." he added.
"Oh, that's a mysterious name for someone like yourself." She giggled.
“Alright, just let yourself in. I’ll be there.” Benny told him.
Castiel smiled at Dean. "So we can be?" He asked. "This isn't something you would get bored of in the span of a week and find someone else? I'm not a conquest?" He asked.
Dean woke up relatively around the same time Cas did, but only a little later. He laid in bed for a few moments, almost forgetting what happened the day before but his mind was full of it. It was wrong to say but he really didn't mind kissing Cas, he didn't know how to feel about that thought. He ran a hand through his bed hair, glancing around his room. He decided to make the room look even slightly decent before Cas came and just threw everything into his closet. He pulled on some jeans before going to do his morning routines. After that he went downstairs to eat a bowl of cereal, now having time to just think in the morning quietness.
Castiel made a loud sound, he bit down in the gag. His knee buckled from underneath him, shaking. He tried to hold himself up but it was difficult to concentrate. His toes curled and his eyes squeezed shut. It kind of hurt but he was still a bit pliant from yesterday's activities. It was really tender and puffy. His eyes glossed over at the feeling.
Lisa came back in with three cups and she set them all on the table before giving one to Dean then Cas. "What was all the excitement about?" she asked.
"I ran into that ass in the hall." Dean shook his head, trying to clear some of the anger. "I didn't do anything to him." He added.
...Did he just ink? From being overly excited? Dean felt his heart melt. He also felt the urge to punch something so he could feel manly again but he decided to push away the thought to help his little embarrassed friend.
Castiel laughed a little, "Great it's not just me who thinks that." He said, he took Dean's hand and pulled himself up.
"Juice or water." Charlie replied. "Thanks." She smiled.
"Oh...yes, yes I want that. The people next door will know your name, hearing me moan it so often." Castiel groaned. He slid in another finger into himself as his free hand moved aimless until he found the little red ring and he removed his other fingers to rub lube on it before going back to what he was doing. He slowly slid it on and he panted. "I'm going to be so ready for you Dean...ah...ready for when if you come home, you can just slide right into me..." He told him, curling his fingers slightly and whimpering a little, it was something but not enough. He wanted more.
Castiel smiled, "This is the best Christmas." he said, "Thank you." he glanced at everyone.
Dean leaned up and kissed away the tear as it fell down Cas's cheek. "I love you." He echoed softly, repeating the phrase between kisses across Cas's cheek, nose, forehead, and eyes. He kept his eyes open, memorizing every detail of every feature. "More than anything else." Dean added lowly, his emotions and sensations heightened by the intoxicating mixture of pleasure and love as he moved slowly inside of Cas.
"Wait, you looked up where-?" Dean stopped, figuring he didn't want to know. "Nevermind. We're hacking them to send fake orders to one of their bastards, Raphael. He won't leave unless he gets orders, and we need him gone." He replied, not wanting to give too many details in case it upset Cas or something.
Dean hesitated when Cas breathed, afraid that he would have been scared or nauseous, but he grinned once Cas started talking about everything he'd loved about it. He was ecstatic that Cas enjoyed it as much as he did. "Oh I know what you mean, and the wind flying through your hair is amazing." He replied animatedly, "Well come on then, we have a whole park full of other ones to ride!" He said giddily, excitement coursing through his blood from the ride.
"Better than mine?" Castiel glanced at him, smiling a little. He nudged his shoulder against Dean's, "Give me a sample of your food then." He said. "I need to try my competition." He laughed a little.
Dean nodded, still grinning. "Yeah, you're right, I'm not sorry at all. You're laugh is too nice, not my fault." He said innocently, holding Cas up against him.
"Uhnn...Dean...Dean. Ah." Castiel tipped his head back, running his hands up and down Dean's back and into his hair, pulling him closer. He met Dean's thrusts, hearing only their labored breathing, moans, and the sound of their skin meeting. "I'm...ngh...close Dean.." he panted, clenching a little before reaching between his legs and stroking himself with Dean's thrusts. His breathing became a lot heavier and labored, as he rested his head onto Dean's shoulder.
Dean knew it'd be better if he went to school by himself but Castiel is still worried about him, so to make up for it. He'll have plans for Dean when he comes back.
Dean quirked a small smile before taking steps to the chair. “I’ll be in and out of your hair soon, so you can go to bed since you look like you really need it.” he joked slightly.
"Good." Castiel snuggled his face back into Dean, sighing contently. "You're my warm blanket." he said. He glanced at Dean before kissing him softly. "Do you want to cuddle a little longer before we go get breakfast?" he asked. "Or are you hungry?"
Castiel gasped a little. "Plaid?" he said in fake horror. "What will you do if I don't like plaid?" he asked. He smiled at Dean, "Plaid doesn't look nice on me, I can't be a Winchester if I don't like plaid." he chuckled.
"What if I didn't want to pay you those kisses?" Castiel asked, kissing him again and smiling a little. He hummed softly, sliding his hand into Dean's jacket and settling it on his side before he smiled at Dean sweetly and started wiggling his fingers against him. He scribbled his fingers across Dean's torso, "I'll pay you back after I get to play with you a little more." he smiled.
Dean leaned into the kiss happily, smiling as Cas pulled back again. "Hmm, it's not guaranteed, but it's a lot more likely I'll live." He replied with a grin. "Now I can keep being your date and knight." He added with a laugh.
The offer made Dean shift slightly in his seat, his mind immediately imagining Cas being ready and waiting for him when he got home. He closed his eyes and took a slow breath, trying to stop the images of Cas spread against the bed, finger in his mouth like in the picture, just waiting for him. Deans eyes popped open again, realizing that wasn't working, and tried to focus on just the words he was typing.
Castiel smiled, putting his arms around Dean's shoulders. "Yeah that's true. Don't tell anyone that though. It might be scandalous." He teased. It was a nice thought that Dean had so much faith in him that he was going to be a big author. "You know we should go on a date before the break is over. Maybe. Or we can stay and make the day with everyone else like we said." He offered.
Dean wrapped his arm around Cas's waist, tangling his fingers into his hair and matching Cas's desperation to touch him. The others were completely forgotten in his mind and all he cared about was feeling Cas and pouring out his emotions through their kiss.
"What do you think would be most beneficial to him then? What doesn't he have?" Castiel asked. "I have an idea on what to get for Charlie, not so much for Kevin but I can figure it out. Also you haven't told me what you wanted." He added.
Castiel hummed, before reaching down with his other hand an took Dean's tail into his hands and stroked it a bit. His fingers slid more to the base, giving it soft tugs. Dean whimpered, arching up.
Castiel moaned into Dean's mouth, sliding a hand into his hair and one back into the hem of his pants. He gently massaged the area with his fingers as he softly tugged at Dean's hair.
"Not always but maybe one in a while so the other doesn't forget." Castiel ran his nose a bit along Dean's cheek. "Or maybe just between us, when we're alone." He smiled. "Either is fine." He said before kissing Dean on the cheek.
"No, it's fine. And it's not true." Dean added, wanting to make that much clear. "Damn, I'm friends with the guy for a day and a half and people already assume we're dating." He muttered, suppressing a sigh.
"Yeah, all those fishing trips we went on definitely comes in handy." Dean replied.
Castiel smiled, squeezing Dean's hand when he felt him kiss his head. He knew lunch was going to be over soon but he enjoyed their time together and Dean's kiss just made him feel like he could do it. He didn't want to leave but they couldn't avoid it.
Dean moaned softly against Cas, pushing his tongue in as far as possible and working it in and out. He ran his hand down Cas's stomach to massage his balls, and he pulled away to kiss the bottom of his spine again.
Dean tightened his grip on Cas slightly, knowing exactly what he meant. Dean wanted to run his fingers over every inch of him, wanted to memorize the feeling of his kiss and the skin beneath his fingertips. "Let's go upstairs." He murmured, breaking off the kiss. He looked into Cas's eyes for a moment before moving towards the stairs, reminding himself that Cas was really here and here to stay.
Dean nodded slightly, moving up to kiss Cas again. "Then just let me know if you want to stop." He replied simply, meeting Cas's eyes before kissing him again. He curled his fingers into Cas's hair with one hand while he teased Cas again with the other, shifting slightly underneath him to bring Cas closer still.
Castiel was a little curious on why Charlie wanted him to go with her but it was fine with him. Kevin ate the last piece of his food and put the plates away. "Okay let's get a move on. We have the whole day ahead of us." He said. Everyone slowly put their plates away and grabbed their jackets and everything.
'Oh god. I didn't think he could get any cuter'
"I like that." Castiel let out a soft breath. He had his eyes closed, just listening to their breathing again. He was getting tired. "Dean, we should change and cuddle." He offered. He didn't exactly want to move but he didn't want to fall asleep on Dean's nice clothes.
Dean stayed over him, gently trailing soft kisses across his skin as he reached up to remove the gag and set it aside. He kissed the corners of Cas's mouth, which were slightly reddened, and kissed his drooping eyelids. Dean could see how completely drained Cas was, which made sense since they had taken so long with all of it.
