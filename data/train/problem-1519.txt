Bruce light punched his sons arm in good spirit "That's my boy. Let no man stop you. You got the makings of a true tough. Unlike the fancy poofs these days who can't seem to understand what goes into a hard days work."
"John look..." Mike said as he grabbed John. "You're my best friend so I'm doing this because I care about you." He then slapped him in the back of the head hard. "WHAT THE BLOODY FUCK WERE YOU THINKING!"
After dessert people retired to the sitting room. Some of Sherlock's cousins pulled out their violins and cellos and started playing. People grabbed their mates and started dancing to the music. It was peaceful and wonderful to witness.
John stood silently. Jesus, this family fawned over Sherlock and loved him dearly. Sherlock wasn't kidding when he said that his family was going to kill him once they found out about the baby. He was scared to find out though.
"Yeah um..." John cleared his throat. "Yeah he did." he took a step toward his Da. "Are you okay with that?"
Sherlock nodded as the paramedics started hooking him up to a blood pressure machine and taking vitals.
John got close to Sherlock. "What if you didn't ask me? What if we say fuck the rules?" He grabbed Sherlocks hand.
Mike stopped laughing when he realised that John was serious. "Fuck me John! Why would you marry him? We came to England to graduate! Not add more to our lives! What could have possibly gone through your head?! There is no good explanation for this unless....he's up the duff!"
John rolled his eyes in frustration as he saw Sherlock huff his way into their bedroom "Sherlock!" He cried after him and followed him into the room "Sherlock! Can we please be adults about this?!"
They came out to the roof. Sherlock walked towards the edge of the building "I've never taken anyone up here with me. It's like my sanctuary for when I need to think. I know it may be a bit odd but when I look out I feel as though I can see all of London stretched out before me."
John nodded and delicately carried Sherlock down the hall. He tried reaching for the door handle but it was rather difficult trying to do that and carry his husband at the same time. After a few tried and failed attempts Sherlock opened the door but not without laughing at his husband pouted face.
True he has his royal duties and meetings at the palace but at least he knew that nothing could start without him and he used that to his advantage. Greg woke him up by cruelly taking away his blankets "Get up lazy bones!"
John got two glass and put them under the tap. "By the way if you just call it a beer people will know what your talking about. I don't think I've seen you around here before."
At the moment a young girl who looked to be in her early twenties stopped looking through the stuffed animals and walked up to Sherlock and Siger. She had short blonde hair and was rather thin. An omega Sherlock could tell "Hi, I'm sorry to interrupt but I couldn't help overhearing you mention the name John Watson."
Oliver quickly put the baby up on Sherlocks chest as he leaned back on the gurney. "It's a boy!" He said excitedly.
I'm not very good at case fics. I really tried with this one. Hopefully it all makes sense. It was hard trying to do this while somewhat following the story line of this song.
Determined to give his parents hell he rushed out of his room and went straight to his fathers office where he knew they were having a meeting at the moment.
George looked back and forth between Sherlock and Greg before nodding "Fine." He pointed towards Sherlock "But I don't want to hear him saying anything like that again! I know times are different but I still believe in treating Omegas with respect. I also think it's best that he leave and sleep this off."
Mycroft came to stand next to his Father. "Now no need to get angry John. It's just interesting that a lower class Omega, who's a full time student, and has a full time job would be suddenly found in the arms of a prince."
Persephone walked down to the landing and crossed her arms "I deduce that there is a handsome Alpha that our mother is not only close too but seems to be interested."
His last night in London he couldn't help but cry. He walked by the pizza place and ended up at St. Barts. Whether it was fate or coincidence, the door to the roof was open. He didn't remember how long he stood there thinking about everything that had happened and everything that could of been. It hurt, more then he could possibly imagine.
The officers backed away to revile John. Sherlock gasped in shock "John?", he was the last person he thought he'd ever see. He stood right behind Greg so John couldn't see his stomach.
Without a word John nodded in sadness as he began to walk out. He caught a cab and gave the Holmes address.
Sherlock came to stand in front of John "But yet you have not once apologised for what your Dad said nor said he was wrong!"
John went over and pulled the roast out of his Mum's hands. "Mum, please, please, please, be normal tonight. He doesn't even eat much. Just treat this as meeting any other boyfriend. He's already going to be out of his element being here so let's not make it anymore disturbing."
Clara and Carter dropped the box with a heavy thud. Clara looked at her Dad "We wanted to help get the big stuff."
"The decor is a little...." Zachary tried searching for the word "Morbid. You would think the university would be a little more strict on this."
John was then brought out of his thoughts by an annoying tapping feeling and looked up to find his sister Harry sitting across the dinner table flicking peas at him.
Sherlock thought about it for a second. True it would be difficult but his Father was right. And besides John may want to come back and live here at some point. But the thought of leaving made him sick to his stomach.
"I'm not squeamish! It's just I don't like....thinking of how and where the baby is going to come out." John says cheeks going red.
Siger put his hand on his sons shoulder "You know if you were an Alpha Mycroft I would happily give you the throne. But you know my feelings about laws and traditions."
John cleared his throat "I'm sorry I don't mean to be rude but I don't remember meeting you before."
Sherlock took a deep breath "It's no trouble. Better then the first time you met my family anyways. At least no one tried to pat me down and search for weapons."
She pulls the covers off of her and has a go at standing and the earth shifts under her feet. Standing is so much harder then it was yesterday. She finds a pair of pyjama pants and a tank top and heads down stairs.
"Now Violet...." Siger tried to sooth her by putting his hands on her arms "this is a good thing. John is our guest and we are perfectly happy with Sherlock bringing him."
Charlotte shared a small peck on David's lips. "I hope you find what you're looking for pipsqueak." David said.
The omega didn't look up when John stood right next to him, too immersed in his project. John cleared his throat to get his attention and the omega kept muttering to himself.
Mycroft turned towards his parents "Well it seems like Sherlock was already headed for that number of offspring, I guess bonding into a family that size is a speeder and shall I say less painful way to do it."
John started to walk around the study and stopped in front of a shelf full of pictures of two little boys. He picked up a frame with a small boy smiling with dark curly hair and a melted ice lolly in his hand and the juice of it all over his face. "Is this Sherlock?"
John has gone from stiff to worried in a second flat. All his anger has been replaced by worry. "What?" He asks carefully.
“I don’t want to do this Jim.” John said as he was being lead down the hallway of the children’s hospital. “I need to be studying right now.”
John pulled out the small container and sniffed it "It smells like my mums kitchen." He pulled out a fork out of the basket, took a big bite, and made happy noises "Steak and onion. It's taste exactly like my Mums." He kissed Sherlock on the cheek. "Thank you love."
Sherlock's cheeks reddened at the statement and he started feeling rather exposed. He started to grab the sheets of the bed to cover himself but John grabbed his hands to stop him. "No." He said. "It's alright. It's rather brilliant actually. It just hit me is all." To prove his statement John started to kiss Sherlock's stomach lightly before he moved on to his trousers.
Thank God for Tristan. His grandson kept him sane and for all it was worth he was happy that David was with him as well.
Sherlock had tucked him to the bed and slid behind him. He kissed the side of Johns head "I love you."
Sherlock packed his books in his bag as John stood up. "I'd like to show you something if that's alright with you." He said shyly.
Sherlock's eyes widened but took John's hand anyways. They walked out a little but not to far away from where they were sitting.
John helped him by removing his jumper and shirt then began to remove Sherlock's suit jacket. He then started unbuttoning his shirt slowly one right after the other and kissed the spot where the button had been previously.
Caleb looked a bit chuffed at being corrected for a second but started speaking again "Captain, am I going to have to go to school again?"
Sherlock opened the door slowly. With the robe and the pyjamas you couldn't tell he was pregnant since he was still on the rather small side. "Hello." He said.
Greg's eyes went wide "Sherlock....have you thought this through?....what about school? What about if you need help with the baby?"
The next few weeks went by in a blur. Charlotte was happy and the angsty teenage girl had become this bubbly young woman.
They decided to meet in between classes in a vacant hallway. It was torture being apart and with John approaching heat they knew they would be separated for a few days and needed to make the most of it.
Everyone tells you that the minute you get married everyone woman suddenly find you attractive. Well I'm here to say that's not true.......it only affects the woman you always wanted to sleep with.
Sherlock was smiling at John outside the building "I want to show you what I do. Hopefully it will persuade you to understand why we can't leave London." Without another word he marched into the building.
John laughed and crossed over to plant a kiss on Sherlocks lips. "It was true. I forgot how amazing you look with a baby."
Finally the walk began for the graduates to pick up their diploma. Sherlock stood with the rest of the crowd and smiled at John who spotted him in the crowd and smiled back.
Jim tapped his fingers to his chin. “Well maybe....there’s a away you don’t have to be.” He said giving a wicked grin.
Charlotte tries to wipe away her tears but it's no use. "There's a part of me that loves him to death. That wants to be there every waking moment of his life and detests the decisions I make to be away from him. Then there's the side of me that's greater then that side. The side that can only see all failed hopes and dreams in his face. What makes me so angry and frustrated though is he's a perfect baby!" She's out of her chair starting to pace and yell. "I feel it would be justifiable if my son was a whinny little snot nose baby but he's not! He doesn't cry, all he wants to do is smile and laugh! Since he was born I wanted to hate the baby so much but I can't! I want my own life back! When David raped me and forced me to bond with him I had this argument with myself about why I couldn't let Uncle Mycroft stuff his body in a bag and throw him in the Thames and the bloody fucking reason is because I somehow love the bastard! After what he did to me I couldn't let him go! Who else would love me after what happened?! No one would see me as anything but another alpha's omega whore! I could no more live without David then I could breathe! Then I got pregnant and the thoughts I had of it just being David and I pursuing our own paths with each other burned down in flames! I kept Tristan because David would have left if I didn't and I would have killed myself before I would let that happen! Tristan is just the reminder that no one will ever love me the way I want them to! My dreams of traveling across the world under a ballet company are gone! You know what I realise though?! That this all wouldn't of happened if it wasn't for you two being such shite parents!! When I needed you most neither of you were there! Papa, you promised you would always be there and that bad guys would never win and what a load of shite that was! You two are the worst parents because it was you Dad who killed Moriarty! It was you Papa who let him! It was Dad you didn't tell you about Sebastian and it was you Papa that let him kidnap me and force his son to rape me! Both of you are the most selfish, inconsiderate, lothesome, arsehole, parents that don't even give a fuck about what happens to their daughter as long as they have their next criminal to chase! So thank you so very bloody fucking much for the life you set me up for! You two have done a splendid job!"
The instructor pursed his lips. "I hope so. Do not make me regret my decision of letting you into my company."
Mycroft came to check in on his brother like he did every month for the past three since Sherlock was sent to the University. He was sitting at the desk as Sherlock sat cross legged on his bed with his arms crossed giving Mycroft a glare.
Sherlock watched as John grabbed his coat and left. Sherlock pushed his hand through his hair trying to get his feelings under control.
"HE HAS TEN KIDS!!" All eight screamed. Then all hell broke loose as they all started expressing their concerns at once.
They continued with their project and got quite a bit done. When they started packing up John came in with some of his friends into the lab "I don't know, that oral test was just stupid! They taught us nothing on stitching yet and they expected me to go in and do it on some poor kid?"
Mycroft sighed "It seems that my young brothers little brawl at the pub last night didn't go unnoticed. Someone recognised him and sent pictures to the media. They were able to dig up the fact that he is attending University. I know we knew this was a possibility but be on the look out. In fact I think it best you walk him to and from class today."
It's a sad realisation when the child you loved and supported all these years becomes someone you don't even recognise and can't wait for the day she leaves so there can be peace in your own home again.
He had told them all to dress nicely and wanted them to match as much as possible so all the girls wore white skirts and light pink polo tops while all his boys were in dark blue pants and green polo tops. If any jewellery was worn by any of his girls it was either simple pearl earrings or necklaces.
Sherlock turned to the two beta girls "And I'm sure you two have a lot of cleaning up to do after your artistic expressions. Go on."
John stands up and leans over the table to get in Sherlocks face. "This is what happens when you're so into being right all the time Sherlock!" John stands straight up and knocks the chair he was sitting in to the floor. "If you would have just told me what was going on none of this would have happened!"
"We haven't. We just met up again about three weeks ago. It was love at first sight and all that nonsense. Nonetheless he asked me to bond with him that very night and I readily agreed."
John sighed "Sherlock and I had a fight, and before you say it was just a fight, it wasn't. It was like....an actual fight. Nothing physical but it was pretty bad."
He tried waiting up for John at night but soon was overcome by sleep. He didn't hear John come in or get up in the morning. The only sign that he did come home was the ruffled up sheets on the right side of the bed.
"Mate! You know as well as I you're not going to last if you have distractions! Think about yourself!"
"I'm sorry dear, you must get up" Mrs. Hudson said almost swatting his arm. "We have a very busy day. You are hosting the Omega lunch along with the Queen and tonight you have dinner with the Ambassador to France."
Sherlock called all his children to a family meeting. They sat in a circle so that way no one was superior to the other. Sherlock was breastfeeding Archimedes and cleared his throat.
He looked over to the cradle that harboured his sleeping son. How could Charlotte say she didn't want their precious baby? That is what hurt him most of all. Their son was a gift and David couldn't imagine life without him.
"That's enough!" John yells in his alpha voice and Sherlock immediately silences. "I am the alpha in the household and how dare you speak to me in such a way! From now on you are to start submitting to what I say and ask for permission on what you do! Maybe taking on your traditional omega role will teach you not to make a mistake like this ever again!"
"Okay." David said. He walked Sherlock to the door and closed it behind him. David leaned against the closed door and sighed. "Well little man, it's just you and me."
Sherlock shook his head. "No more gathering information on the decomposition of muscle after death."
One he knew the guards schedules though he devised a plan to sneak out dressed in disguise. He dresses as a butler and was able to get a hold of some make up to make himself look older and put a hat over his head. He quickly snuck out the back gate then hailed a cab to take him to Johns house.
John took a deep breath and opened the script and started to read "Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, which mannerly devotion shows in this; for saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, and palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss."
The girls all curtsied while the boys all bowed “Nice to meet you Holmes family.” They all said in perfect unison.
John saw the hurt and the slight hint of tears in Sherlock's eyes. He embraced him "I want to. I don't want to loose you and will do whatever it takes. I promise."
He opened the study doors with a hard smack. He was ready to really lay into his parents before he stopped short.
Mycroft looked at Sherlock "Yes, brother mine seems like you're hiding something." Mycroft gave Sherlock a sly smile.
Molly gets really close to him to whisper her information "I heard that since he just got out of rehab he found a whole new side of himself. Apparently he begged his parents to give him another chance and as such he will be attending our school to study society and to ask us about how we think and feel. He's also really dreamy."
Sherlock laid his head on John's shoulder and took a deep breath of his sent. "I'm exhausted. I had classes all morning, then I come home and find all this nonsense waiting for me, and this baby won't give me a moments peace."
Sherlock groaned and sat up "Can't I just take a test to show that their curriculum is beneath me? I guarantee I'm twice as smart as these professors."
John’s heart constricted at the words. ‘We love each other right? It was kind of foolish of us to think that everyone would get along swimmingly.’
When John walked into the flat neither of them regarded each other. John simply walked over to Tristan who was currently playing with blocks on the floor.
Josh tossed and turned all night but eventually fell into a restful sleep. Around noon he woke up to the sound of his phone vibrating, in a sleepy voice he answered "Hullo?"
John suddenly became angry. Did Sherlock think him not good enough to be seen in public now? He had half a mind to just say 'fuck it all' and leave.
John started to grasp at straws "It wasn't the baby though Sherlock, you're brilliant and interesting. I'm sorry about the baby but you and I need each other to get through this time, together."
John comes out of the restroom and his heart nearly stops at seeing Sherlock again. "Sherlock! It's nice to see you again. I tried finding you but you seemed to fall off the radar."
John smiled and held his hand out, still not looking on, and felt Sherlocks hand in his. He so badly wanted to turn to lay eyes on his beloved but knew it wasn't time.
Now this is not to say I'm not happy because I am. Everything is going great in my life but it's just a challenge to resist the temptation.
Mike and the other lads laughed and started playfully rough housing with each other as they walked off to the locker room to shower and change.
Mike opens the door and comes face to face with Sherlock who looks like he was about to knock on the door.
John couldn’t help the smile on his face from the cuteness of his four-year old “Of course solider.”
As Harry took his hand she began to laugh in disbelief "Oh my God. Of course the golden child would bag himself a prince."
Trying to relive the tension John spoke up "Well Sherlock is always full of surprises and that why I like him."
Odessa came into the room wearing jeans and a blue blouse. She had her favourite black cardigan covering up the ensemble. She saw Darius sitting on her sister’s bed so she decided to join him and watch her sister apply the finishing touches to her red lips. “So what do you two think about tonight?” she said wearily.
Soon they were the only two left in the restaurant until the waitress informed them that they were closing.
John laughed "Just a bit. You say your family, school, and work is here but the same goes for me as well. My life is in Scotland Sherlock. You could finish school there and there's police departments there as well and it'll be great."
Sherlock did not like where this was going. There was something off and fake about this woman. Wore too much make-up to look older. Wanted to fit in and slept her way through too many Alphas but pretended to be a virgin for her parents sake. Would rip you to pieces once you turned your back. "Yes I believe we speak of the same John Watson."
Sherlock rolled his eyes and kept leaning over and looking out into the city "The only way for anything to happen to me by standing right here is to jump and since I have no want to commit suicide I will not being doing such a thing. You on the other hand might want to stay put before I make it look like YOU committed suicide."
All the sudden my love rushed out the door and didn't say much else. I had to sprint after him to keep up until we came back to the tailor shop.
Unable to resist the temtation he walks over and lightly smacks his bum. "Now this position I like."
John walked over carefully and sat down next to him. Sherlock didn't even acknowledge his presence. John took a deep breath and swallowed the lump in his throat "Look Sherlock....I want to apologise for what I did and said earlier."
Is this because you're disappointed that I'll be back on tour for the summer? Or is it because you and I both thought this would be easier then it is. Just please talk to me.
Sherlock turned his head and thought "More like a consultant for the police force. I have a very low tolerance for stupidity and unfortunately for the mass population, majority of them are extreme dull so I wouldn't be able to survive working along side them on a day to day basis. I'd like to pick and choose what I do and not have it assigned. Perhaps make my own job for them. Like be a consulting detective, so when the police are out of their depth they can come to me."
Sherlock was walking around the dorm room looking around at the different objects and wrinkling his nose at the naked omega model calendar that was on the wall. Alphas. "No, we are going to my parents house. There's going to be a small gathering with a few family members and close friends. I think it would be an opportune night to just introduce you to all of them at once so there's not much gossip and rumours running around later."
John smiled and looked to Sherlock for permission. Sherlock tilted his head to the right and bared his throat. Johns mouth watered at the sight. He then leaned forward and breathed in Sherlocks sent, he then lightly kissed the sight and then bit.
John and Sherlock we're playing it off beautifully that nothing had changed between them. It was for thier daughters sake though and they both knew that.
Sherlock's mouth went dry looking at John. The jumper went perfectly with his skin tone and matched his eyes. Even if it was a little too casual it looked really good on him. "Perfect." Sherlock said as dignified as he could possibly be. "We better go though. Fashionably late is okay, we are boarding on just rude."
"Sherlock." John said as his breath left his body. He cleared his throat, over taken by emotion. "Where have you been?"
Sargent Smith got in his face "Watson, get your head out of your arse or I'll do it for you! I have no time for ninnies who day dream all day! Come to work or don't come at all! Do I make myself clear soldier?!"
All the girls ran fast and Charlotte took a deep breath as she placed her hand on the bar and straightened her posture.
Sherlock shook his head "If I'm to be honest, quite the contrary." Sherlock put his hands to his side and started to clench them with nervousness. "I find you interesting and exquisite. I want nothing more then to kiss you again and spend every moment with you but for the better of us, that can't happen."
Sherlock looked to John but straightened himself up "I have nothing but the best intentions for your son." He put his hand over his heart which was a very old fashion of a sign of respect to the Alpha of the household. "Your son means the world to me. However far this relationship will go will be completely up to John. Whatever capacity he'll have me I will gladly take." He then turned to John. "I want him to do everything he wants. Become a doctor for the army, travel, anything he wants I want to be the one cheering him on. I'm lucky enough to be the one he deems worthy to be in his presence and that is more then I could ever hope for."
The thing about each of Sherlocks children was he treated them all as individuals which defiantly showed in their style of clothing. Persephone tended to lean towards dark colours while Darius preferred lighter colours. If Greg could say one thing about Sherlock he was a good parent and proudly supported each of his children no matter what.
Greg patted his shoulder. "It doesn't work like that Sherlock. It's time to grow up. You're married and have a kid on the way. You're a genius and I know deep down you realise that what you did is wrong. This is not about the pregnancy or the marriage. This is about going behind everyone's back. That's not something families do."
"But surely three weeks isn't enough time to get know each other again." Violet said. "I mean does he know about the children? Is he prepared to take up the responsibility of ten children?"
Sherlock's parents Violet and Siger as well as Mycroft were over for their monthly visit. Ever since Sherlock had gotten pregnant with Persephone his family found it necessary to visit him and his children.
Sherlock glared and looked down at the cheesecake in the box he was carrying. He could see that the crust was starting to flake and suddenly what he brought wasn't good enough. He sniffed and stood straighter, he wiped his sweaty palms on his pants for the fifth time, drew a deep breath and knocked.
The omega jolted out of his project almost with a startle but with a very big hint of irritation and stared at John. "What!?" He said in a baritone voice as smooth as silk.
Sherlock took a deep breath "Mother, Father, I'd like to introduce you to John Watson." Sherlock said standing besides John and grabbed his hand "John, these are my parents Violet and Siger Holmes."
John couldn't keep his mind off the kiss. Sure he thought Sherlock attractive but the kiss threw him off. Was it just a moment thing? Was it for real? What would he do if Sherlock felt something for him?
Greg had to contain his excitement "He won't. He'll be at Scotland Yard all day to tie things up on a case. Meet us there and I promise Sherlock will talk to you."
David fell into his role of fatherhood smoothly. He loved to spend time with his son, making him smile, putting him to sleep, everything that his own father seemed to never have time for. David easily gave up spending time with his friends to spend even more time with his baby.
"Poor baby Johnny, no longer a baby anymore. Instead full of cock just like a good Omega should be. Bet that's what you really did for the army huh? Gave those Alphas a proper thank you for serving our queen?"
Happy Christmas faithful readers. I'm sure you're enjoying your Christmas festivities. To add to your celebration I've decided to share with you a Christmas story, or I probably should say a Christmas case.
David sighed. "Look Charlotte.....I know there's a lot you regret and I know I'm the center of that regret so I've been thinking....if you want to break out bond I won't fight you. I'll even take Tristan off your hands and you'll never have to see me or him ever again. You can have the life you always dreamed about without us being a millstone around your neck." Those words taste like bile coming out if his mouth.
Chloe tossed her long blonde hair and swivelled her hips in a playful manor "But Daddy my shoes could get dirty. I have to inspect my room before I decide where everything goes."
As much as it was normal for his family to move around he could tell that it was a toll on his family as it was the first move since Mary, their mother and his Omega wife had died. She died in a car accident three years prior and the family was just coming out of their grieving period and even Chloe who was abiding by her mothers wishes for her Dad to move on was trying to encourage him to meet other Omegas.
John rarely came home and Sherlock invested all his time and energy into taking care of Tristan. David was sure if it wasn't for the baby Sherlock would have died of a broken heart.
John was taken out of his thoughts and looked down at the man who was clearly annoyed with him. "I'm sorry. Just not used to this sort of thing."
John turned to the truck to see Clara aged eight and Carter aged six struggling with a big box as they tried to carry it together. Out of all his children Clara and Carter were the closest. "Do you two need some help?"
He had won a paid-internship at St. Barts for his academics in the medical field. It was hard leaving Scotland where his parents currently resided as well as his friends but this was too good of an opportunity to pass up. His parents used to live in England when he was no older then three then his Dad's company transferred to Scotland so even though his roots were English the place felt foreign and a little too big for his liking. He was making do though.
Both boys fell into a fitful sleep and when John awoke the next morning he was the only one in the flat. Sherlock had an early morning class on Tuesday's so it wasn't surprising to find him not there.
John's palms were sweating. He was called into Sargent Smith's office and he was mentally going over everything he had done wrong in the past few weeks. He was certain he was going to get some news along he lines of not graduating in three weeks like he was supposed to, he stood at attention though waiting for the inevitable.
John felt even lower at this point then he did with Mrs. Holmes. When he looked over at Sherlock the boy had a look of guilt on his face as well.
Sherlock stood straight "Inspector." And nodded his head then shut the front door. He then turned towards his two older children who were smiling. "What?" He said getting annoyed with his children when they dawned the look of 'I know everything.'
He circled around her until he came face to face with her once again. "You're a very passionate dancer Miss Watson-Holmes. Elegant, refined, your moves are ones of perfection. But only a dancer with a lot of pain and sadness dances the way you do. As of she's trying to escape from something."
As he sat there scrubbing he went over Charlotte's biting words. He knew it was his fault they were in this situation but he thought they were passed that. Did Charlotte really feel that way or was it just the alcohol talking?
Sherlock lifted the baby into his arms and yelled after the two twins who ran down the stairs to the second floor of their three story apartment building which Sherlock owned "Don't break anything!" He said.
Both needed to stop eventually because of lack of air but they still held their faces close "I know we can't bond until you go into a proper heat after the baby is born but I think we're meant to be together." John got down on one knee and took off his class ring.
You promised you book tour would give you a break during the summer and I can't help but count down the days until I see you.
John laid awake all night staring at nothing. The words his Father said playing over and over again in his head. He knew Sherlock wasn't sleeping behind him but he was thankful that he didn't try to start any conversations, he didn't have it in him to explain what had happened but he knew that Sherlock had already worked it out. When he felt Sherlock stir behind him he just scooted over so he could give him some room.
All of the girls confidences diminished with his harsh words. The once bright, smiling faces turned into faces of despair. What if you weren't good enough?
Zachary who had been in the kitchen entered to sit at the table but he had heard what his son had said. "What the hell for son?"
Mike smiled "Yeah word around the street is they're looking at you to be the next Lieutenant Colonel. Congratulations John."
John is silent a while longer and then his friends come into the room and luckily picking up on the tension immediately turn silent.
Sherlock kissed his neck. And lined his prick with John's hole and started rocking himself in. "God!" John said "Don't stop....feels so good..."
Sherlock had unfortunately been too busy to help John with any of the preparations of their upcoming ceremony. Jim had graciously stepped into help. Since Sherlock was not overly fond of Jim, John felt like he had to sneak him around . It made John feel terrible lying to Sherlock but it’s not like he had any friends here.
Sherlock was in no mood to play these childish games and snatched the pillow off his head "John! This is important!"
Persephone slammed the cap down on her lipstick “Yeah but not like this, and not with someone who has a family that large. I mean…..there’s already enough of us to practically start a town of our own but know there’s going to be 18 of us! It’s insane!”
"Mm...." Sherlock said. He signed the bottom of the last page and handed Greg the packet "Now I'm done."
"Well then we'll start with the basics..." Zachary said "they will live in Scotland. John's base and our home is there and that way if John gets shipped off Sherlock will have us to help with the baby."
Josh sighed and embraced him "How about we not talk about this for awhile. We've got a couple months before we leave and until then we'll just worry about the baby. Okay?" John said tilting his chin up to look at him.
"To be honest in a way yes, but Tristan is what matters and Charlotte will be coming home in about a month so I can tell everyone then. Until that point can we keep this just between us?"
John walked into St. Bartholomew's Hospital after sending off his kids to their first day of their new school. John dropped off Caleb himself as the little boy was still convinced that his Dad was going to leave him there. John would kill Clark for torturing his brother if he didn't love him so much. After much coaxing and tears, John was able to remove Caleb from his leg after a promise that he would be back soon.
John huffed a laugh and brought his hand up to his face and started rubbing the bridge of his nose. "Sherlock, no. Just no."
John looked in the mirror trying to tie his tie and repeatedly failing. Graduation was today and he knew that the past few weeks were taking a toll on Sherlock. He'd been chickening out of telling him they'd be moving a thus staying away from his husband but with a week away from needing to be in Scotland he knew he had to do it today.
Mrs. Holmes shoved him back "May God have mercy on your soul you thief." She then walked away with tears streaming down her face and leaving John to feel like the worst person in the world.
In all his life John had never experienced the world move so quickly. Even getting shot and transported to medical aide seemed like slow motion compared to the media flooding in and Sherlocks guards coming and hauling then away into a private car.
"Yes, well….” John said feeling like this night was already turning into a disaster. “Who’s hungry?”
Ballet was so much more then dance, it was an escape. Between being a mate, a mom, and Sherlock Holmes and John Watson's daughter this was the only place where she felt like herself and not a label.
Having a new baby in the house should have made Baker Street a whirlwind but Tristan was nothing short of a perfect baby. Sherlock even commented on it when his grandson soiled his nappy and the infant didn't make so much as a peep.
Sherlock enjoyed the frustration Greg was experiencing as he wanted to make the copper regret coming over to his house on a Saturday when he was supposed to be off and enjoying his time with his ten children, he would remind himself that his his children deserved extra sweets tonight.
Sherlock threw his head back and screamed "Why does it hurt so much! The books never said it would hurt this much!"
That morning her parents wished her good luck. She kissed Tristan goodbye but David didn't really acknowledge her which threw her off a little bit but was determined it wasn't going to mess with her mind frame.
Sherlock held his head up high "Is it not my life? Can I not decide for myself who I fancy and choose to spend time with?"
Sherlock gave a long sigh to calm himself down. He walk towards John and embraced him. “I know this is not the easiest life and a lot is expected of you but please try. There is a lot at stake and I want everyone to love you as much as I do.”
Sherlock hated small talk but it was a nice break to think about something else "Fine. We've finally fallen into a rhythm with each other. We've also established each other's like and dislikes. Even have gotten used to each other's natural habit. I must say I find when he bites his lips its endearing."
The words stung but Sherlock remained silent and stared out the window looking out at the country that would one day be either his kingdom or his prison.
John ran into St. Barts hospital. He was out of breath when he got up to the head nurses counter "Sherlock Holmes room please." He said breathless.
John looked at Sherlocks direction "I'm sorry. But you said the possibility is not completely gone perhaps someday our little one could get a cousin?"
Richard slightly bowed "Thank you sir and Master Sherlock." He gave a kind smile. "I take it you made a friend Master Sherlock."
If this were a perfect world there would be no temptation. It would just be you and I and everyone else would look like they had a arse for a face.
I wouldn't have loved you at all if you weren't who you were I just want the support I show you every day.
"I agree." Siger said "They have good heads on their shoulders, they're financially stable, and they are seeing this thing through."
Both parents faces fell but Siger's face was more one of worry as he looked at his wife. They shook hands but Violet gave John a piercing stare. "Sherlock dear, you never said anything about bringing an Alpha around."
He barely pushed through his classes as well. The only class he pretended to at least care about was the Bio Chemistry class and that was only because John was on his arse to do his work.
"Don't worry about that right now John. I'll have someone get it and bring it up to you. It's very late and I think you just need to sleep."
Before John could once again have this argument with his mother a big burly voice from inside the house came "Is that my boy?"
John turned around and was met with Sherlocks gaze. His wild, curly hair was slicked back and he looked so majestic in his uniform. It was black with gold tassels on the shoulders and hold buttons going down the front. He wore a white sash that went across his left shoulder that had a few metals on it and there was a diamond cross on his right shoulder with the Holmes family crest of a knight in gold in the middle.
Bruce gave his son a dark look and swallowed the rest of his glass in one go. "No." He stood up and his face immediately went angry. "I gave up so much for you! You were supposed to do something with yer life! Now yer just goin to be someones fukin whore!" The closer he got to John the louder his voice got.
Sherlock so badly wanted to be done now but trying to get it over with quickly he gritted his teeth and made a low grunting sound which turned into a full blown yell as he pushed. "How big is this baby?!"
David sighed. "Yeah. I honestly have been thinking about it since before Charlotte left and well....it's just best for everyone."
They were getting married in the Holmes's backyard. John and Sherlock wore matching suits and Christopher was in a comfy white onesie and wrapped in the blue blanket with the lamb.
"Don't sell yourself short John. Look where you are now." He said gesturing to the class "They don't just let anyone in here."
Charlotte started laughing "Yes I am.... imagine that. I have to be drunk to want to sleep with you..." Charlotte started laughing harder and in the middle of it suddenly became green and she threw up all over David's feet and the floor. David had to suppress himself from throwing up also, it smelt really bad.
Sensing John didn't want to talk nor was he in the right mind to make any specific decisions in where he had wanted to go he called Sherlock letting him know he was bringing John back to the palace. Sherlock was already waiting for them in front of the palace. Once the car came to a stop he threw himself at the door opening up to a display of such intense sorrow. John was sobbing so hard he hadn't even noticed Sherlock opening the door. Seeing his love in such despair and not knowing what to say; he just moved into the car moving various items aside and held John. John still didn't let the bag go and only held it tighter as Sherlock held him to his chest. The heart breaking sobs kept coming and Sherlock could do nothing but hold John. After about 20 minutes John seemed to have tired himself out as his sobs become softer.
Sherlock took a deep breath and looked at his watch again. 45 minutes to go. He was already starting to think about his nightly routine with his children when a scent it his nose. It was familiar yet in a way different. The smell of tea and the forest after a heavy rain with a light hint of pine, yet it bared an overtone of gun oil and a faded scent of apples. He looked around the room until he saw him......
John looked around as if he was scared to say it out loud. Then then took a deep breath and said "Look, please don't think that I'm a stereotypical Alpha who feels like they're lot in life is to only reproduce, it honestly just sort of happened but...." he took another deep breath "I have eight children."
Sherlock showed him another picture of a woman laying face down in a pink coat "A list of suicide murders. The murder was a cabbie who was going to die of a brain aneurism. For one last thrill he would make people take a pill which would kill them. I figured it out and stopped him."
Mycroft leaned over his desk and brought his hands under his chin. "Have you considered the effects it would have on your son?"
I'm tired of fighting with you. Tears spring to my eyes and you just stare at me. I know you're still going to that party. I swear I'll never understand how you can stand there and see I'm crying and not do anything at all.
Sherlock looked offended "It's not a magic trick. I'm just observing. And when things go wrong at the palace you don't seem to mind it."
Thank God for people like Jim Moriarty. Jim had proved himself to be a good friend in the last few weeks. Sherlock was hesitant with John hanging around him but John begged Sherlock to trust him when it came to people he decided to spend time with. Jim helped him navigate the finer points of the upper class society and it had been super helpful.
"Well anyways, while you were gone he was bonded and is now expecting a baby! His mother Katie told me and they are over the moon! But it does lead me to wonder...do you ever consider yourself doing that?"
Sherlock turned towards his four year old Killian and the other set of twins who were from Italy Valentina and Edelweiss aged 10. "Yes?"
John eyes widened "Sherlock...." Fear struck his heart and he knelt in front of him and grabbed his hands. "Sherlock please....I don't want to loose you."
"I feel like where on one of those prank shows.” Odessa said. Sabian they elbowed his sister. "Ow!” she said.
Sherlock grabbed John's hand and lead them into the bedroom. They both stripped and Sherlock laid down on his side as John got behind him and started to gently knead his back.
David puts his nose to his blissfully unaware son's head. "Can we just wait to see if you get into the company then go on from there?"
"Siger! I wouldn't be so upset if the boy talked to us! You never communicate with us! First you run around risking you life on these wild goose chases then you scare us to death with your drug use-"
“As long as you give your formal consent. It really only matters that there is an official face from the palace, there’s no saying what face it has to be. There would be no push back if that’s what you’re worried about.”
When Sherlock told him about their impending marriage as well as the need for a child as soon as possible he almost felt the world closing in on him. While the idea of bonding with Sherlock wasn't unpleasant and if he really had to admit to himself something he was secretly excited about, the idea of having a child was almost a panic-attack inducing thought. As if he didn't already have 3,000 other things to worry about now he had to think about squeezing out another human almost again his will. Sherlock ensured him though it would be something they would decide on together, when the time would be right and all John could think of was the fact that he would never want children. Sherlock looked so wide-eyed and scared that John didn't have the heart to break the idea that he would want children. Finally he just nodded and kissed his beloved cheek which made Sherlock smile. God, he was hopelessly in love with the beautiful prince.
Persephone darkened her cat-eye eyeliner in her vanity mirror. She wasn't looking forward to tonight. Her mum had been insanely happy the past week.
He plopped on his chair "I'm getting to old to play like this." He said with a huff. Sherlock picked up a book that was sitting by the chair. "What do you say to a wind down with a story?"
John rolled his eyes at his Mother's worrying "Not exactly on the priority list, giving us a home cooked meal. We had better things to do."
"Charlotte Watson-Holmes?" Charlotte perked her head up and grabbed her bag. She gave her iPod to the person controlling the sound system and showed him the song to play. Afterwards she stood in the middle of the floor with with feeling of being completely alone in the universe.
Sherlock sighed "Hello love. I'm trying to call you...again. Just letting you know that I'm on the way to the class. Text me when you're on the way." and then hung up.
Cynthia and Zachary gave each other a glance. After a moment of silent agreement Zachary spoke. "Yeah alright." He said in a scratchy voice.
Sherlock had John pressed up against the wall with his legs wrapped around his waist. God it felt good.
Sherlock nodded "Right, check-book is in my room and take Persephone with you so you two can go grab some things from the market. Seems we're out of milk and bread."
John took off his jacket and hat and laid them down on the chair next to the bed. He then turned and stared at Sherlock and for a second they both just looked at each other before they crossed the room and began to kiss each other passionately.
Violet cleared her throat "John Watson I kindly ask that you leave before I need to call the police. You are no longer allowed anywhere near my son. Believe me sir, I have been waiting for an opportunity like this since the moment I met you."
Sherlock was pulled from his thoughts "Who said I'm not? I'm just sizing up my classmates. Do you see that girl over there? The one who has tear streaks in her eyes wearing the lavender top? She just recently found out the Omega she was sleeping with, not dating mind you, is pregnant now she's certain she'll have to give up school and get some low level job."
The Watsons were in the main study room. Compared to the room and environment around them they looked very underdressed.
John had a history book opened and was trying to concentrate as Sherlock was kissing his neck. "You know I actually have to study." He said playfully pushing him away.
Greg ran out yelling at his team to get an ambulance while John helped lower Sherlock onto a chair. "Good, breathe, like you practiced."
"John! John! Turn here!" the paparazzi where outside the store but he could clearly see them through the windows. Immediately people turned towards him which immediately made him go red with embarrassment.
A few hours had past and the pains were getting closer. Not bad enough to be incapacitated but enough to think he may not have as much time as he thought. There was just a few more loose ends he had to wrap up.
Trying to diffuse the situation Siger spoke up "I think what my mate is trying to say is that the Holmes name carries a lot of weight. We don't mean anything bad by it but we are sought after in high society. We feel that your life style is...a little less then advantages for our grandchild and son."
As she started heading out the door Amanda grabbed her arm. "Where do you think you're going?" She said almost yelling to be heard over the music.
The room he was lead to was the same one he had had his fitting in for the royal announcement. It felt like a lifetime ago being happy and now this room felt cold and hollow. Sherlock undressed him and got him into some sleepwear. John was practically a zombie going through the motions and Sherlock didn't blame him. He could only deduce what Bruce had done and knowing that John's Father was such a big part of his life, it was understandable that John had mentally and physically checked out.
As John walked to his first class he noticed a sort of buzz around the campus. Not the usual nervousness or the greeting of friends but an excitement.
Greg and Sherlock sat in the back of the pub as Sherlock stewed and Greg drank. "At least act like you're having a good time." Greg said almost under his breath.
Violet touched her sons arm with tears in her eyes "Son you could have told us. You didn't need to hide this."
Sherlock never really talked about what drove him to become a parent, all he knew was that with the help of his brother Mycroft, Sherlock was able to have five of his children by sperm donors and his brother also helped push through the adoptions of the other five children.
Sherlock glared at John and kept walking forwards. Each step that John followed in gave him more anxiety. If Sherlock's mother was as bad as everyone seems to be making her out to be once she found out about the baby she would probably arrange to have him murdered.
The man with the prince slightly bowed his head "My apologies the Prince's security was somewhat compromised this morning."
The Holmes parents say across from the Watsons while Sherlock and John sat together on regular chairs.
Greg groaned "You know it might help your situation if you were pleasant. Maybe then you could make some friends and make this place bearable."
"How can you be so thick?" She said in a playful annoyed tone "You go to work then you come here and take care of us. You've done that every day for the past 16 years Mum. When's the last time you had one night to yourself?"
After a few more beats of silence Violet finally spoke up "I'm sorry I can't do this. I can't pretend everything is okay!"
They walked out of the building and turned a corner "Still what kind of selfish arsehole would forget his husbands birthday?"
"Come off it John. Just because no other man can measure up to your standards doesn't mean we can't have a laugh at your expense." Mike said.
Greg let out a breath, Sherlock was right, in the last eight years that he had known the Omega he had seen how the addition of children that either Sherlock adopted or had, added to the chaos that was already the consulting detectives life. In all honesty when he met the Omega he was surprised that this selfish, childish, man was a parent, much less an Omega parent who had never been bonded.
John looked at Sherlock who was staring ahead but not saying anything. John felt completely alone in this fight. "Well thank you for a lovely evening but I should be heading home soon. Don't want my patents to worry."
Cynthia chimed in "John is not the one to blame here. They are both equally parts guilty. Young minds wonder and things happen."
John turned his head to look at Sherlock. With the glow of the city below Sherlock looked absolutely breath taking and John couldn't resist leaning over and kissing those lips.
Mycroft came up behind him "Well you did get married in the middle of the night without us last time, the least you could do is indulge us in throwing you a proper wedding this time."
"And you, William Sherlock Scott Holmes, do you promise to love and honour your Alpha? To obey and cherish, in sickness and in health, as long as you both shall live?"
Once they were loaded into the ambulance the car started moving fast. They removed Sherlocks trousers and laid a blanket over his knees to give him somewhat privacy.
Sherlock was over come by emotion and lifted John off the ground so the Omegas legs were wrapped around his waist. The kisses they gave each other were desperate and rough. It was absolutely wonderful. Sherlock pulled back just a little. "You sure about this John?"
Valerie looked at her husband "It's a legitimate question! You and I are not getting any younger dear and John needs to settle down. All this army doctor stuff is fine for now but John, you have to understand that you'll want to have a family."
"My mother sees me as a two year old. I'm an adult and I can make my own decisions." He says frustrated.
Before he could finish Sargent Smith patted his back. "Congratulations Watson." He gave a warm smile.
We were about to just chalk it up to a case of maybe this person doesn't want to be found until my love discovered a box.
Now his heart really has stopped. In no way is this happening. This cannot be happening. Please God let it be a dream. "Mine? But I used a condom. And you weren't in heat." John says all too calmly.
"Thank you Richard." Sherlock said handing his coat over. "John?" Sherlock said giving a questioning look.
Mary looked like she wanted to vomit but put back on the fake smile "Wow....so much going on for John isn't there....well um.....congratulations." She started backing up and hit the display table. She said a rushed apology before practically running out of the shop.
"Um...Sherlock I really don't think...." Within a matter of seconds the door was unlocked and Sherlock was on the other side of it.
The woman gave him a questioning look but continued on. Sherlock took a deep breath. He needed to get a hold of himself for John's sake.
Sherlock was working in the lab at St. Barts on a biology project that was due. The one girl who he could semi-tolerate Molly was his lab partner and was putting their poster board together.
John finally caught up to Sherlock and grabbed his arm "Sherlock! I have been waiting for an opportunity like this my entire life!"
"We have to do a persons check. We don't know you and we have to know that you won't pose a threat to the Royal Family." A guard said turning his nose up at John. Obviously they wanted to make him feel as unwelcome as possible.
After the covered the grave Charlotte stood in front of it as John and Sherlock watched her from a distance.
A younger cadet passed out waters to the tired ROTC students. John gratefully excepted and drank it so fast his head spin but the pain was worth the reward.
John's heart clenched at the guilt. He vowed himself he would tell Sherlock of their move after graduation "Thank you love." With one last look at himself in the mirror he dignified himself 'good enough' and held out his arm to Sherlock. "Shall we?"
Sherlock has a slight deer-in-the-headlights look and puts his hand down quickly. "I apologise. I was look for John Watson but it seems I may have gotten the wrong dorm room number." He says and immediately starts to walk away.
Greg rolled his eyes "You should call John and call off all this divorce business. He'd be able to help you!"
I can't believe you're actually are here. Your book tour that you've been on seems to have stretched forever, but who could not love the words you write about our adventures? You are an amazing person.
John leaned against the closed bedroom door. What did he just do? The alpha rage completely took over his body like he was a pubescent teenage boy. When alpha rage struck it was anyone's guess what would happen and unfortunately now it was the worst.
John was touched at the kind heartedness of the woman but with all the rushing didn't really have a chance to thank her.
John stood outside the front door of their new town house and blew his whistle mostly to make his children roll their eyes. "Head count! Christopher!"
Sherlock lifted his head up in an effort to show the 17 year old Omega that he was not fooling around "Because I feel better if you two went together. Satisfied enough with that answer?"
John slowly walked up the steps of 221B, trying to come up with a way to break to Sherlock that their deal was off and they could not stay in London. As he opened the flat door he braced himself for what was on the other side.
"Pleasure sir." Sherlock said with his hand stretched out. Bruce took it and almost cursed Sherlocks fingers in the process.
Persephone stood up and checked herself in the mirror. She wore a black corset looking top with black lace sleeves and a long black lace skirt. Usually she wore more revealing clothing preferring to show off what God gave her but felt that wouldn't be very appropriate to meet the Captains family.
Everything is new to me and while I have a good teacher I often feel like I come up short. You have patience for me though and you guide me through.
John remembers his mother talking about the recent happenings with the royal family but never cared for celebrity gossip all that much. "Oh yeah. Whatever for?"
Sherlock weighed his options and knew he only had one choice. He had to rely on his funds to continue his experiments "Fine."
He went to check in at the nurses desk again and thank the Lord it wasn't the same male nurse as the day before. Instead it was a pretty female nurse who smiled wide as John approached. "I'm here to see Sherlock Holmes." John said.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and turned to his brother "The divorce papers never went through and as you can clearly see from my bond mark John and I have done everything already to be recognised as a legal bonded couple. Our parents and you are just making my life miserable."
Before she could show him the picture John looked at his watch "I'm sorry Molly but I have to go or else I'm going to be late. Catch you later?"
Sherlock opened one of his eyes a glared as much as he could "I'm doing stretches and breathing exercises. Some of the research I've done says it helps with the birthing process."
Sherlock shook his head and tried to remember the breathing exercises he was taught in birthing class "I thought I'd have more time....oh God I need to sit down!"
Another boy Stephan walked into the conversation. "Prove it. Come out tonight with us. Don't worry your precious papers won't do themselves."
John smiled back "Get used to it. You may be the Prince but I'm the King of this pub and you're under my rule. First things first..." John went over and grabbed a mop and bucket and then shoved them at Sherlock "Clean the loo. And make sure you REALLY scrub the toilet bowls. The football team was here last night and they tend to wreck the place."
My hands fidget at my side. I've never been more nervous in my life. I know you love me but it still doesn't ease the fear that you might say no to me.
John nodded and they assumed the position that they held. After a few more missed steps they started flowing together like water. Soon it felt like there was no one else in the room and for a moment they just stared at each other.
Mycroft smiles at his nephew "A little structure never hurt anyone. You all have been blessed with a parent who is also a child and therefore has no discipline or boundaries whatsoever. I think a little military influence would be good on all of you."
Adding to the usual chaos was the fact that he had to plan everything according to centuries of traditions. John wanted to wear a blue suit but was being forced to wear white to symbolise his purity. He didn’t want roses because they were cliche but had to have them because they were in the Holmes family crest. He wanted his father to walk him down the aisle but since that definitely wasn’t going to happen there was no point of even wishing for that. It became more and more difficult to stamp down the longings for his parent.
Mycroft nodded "I know Father. Being an Omega is my fates curse but I think I better serve from behind the throne then on it."
Charlotte thought about what her parents said earlier but not wanting to be ruled by anyone and having really no desire to go back to the world of nappies and spit up yet gave her the decision. "Sure that sounds lovely."
All the children started talking at once, making their own deductions about how there Mums night went.
Sherlock looked at his children "You'll all love each other. I'm not so delusional that I think it'll be easy for all of you from day one. Especially since they'll have to move here."
As Greg watched the door close he received a phone call from Mycroft. Trying to be quiet he spoke in a hushed voice "I thought we agreed to call each other once Sherlock started class."
Sherlock embraced the feeling. The electrocution going through his body was more then he thought he could handle yet he never wanted it to end. Only when he needed to breathe did he pull them apart. Once he did he stared in Johns eyes and all the sudden the horror at what he just did over took him "I'm....I'm so sorry." He began to push John away and stared to walk off the stage.
John laid Sherlock down on the bed and straddled him so he could begin kissing his neck. "You're so beautiful." He said in between kisses.
Sherlock moved a little to allow his husband to get up slightly "You need to see why we shouldn't move to Scotland."
The hailed a cab and Sherlock gave the address. The pair were silent and nearly hugging the doors and their side of the car, trying to put as much distance between them as possible.
John's Mum could tell her son was struggling with something. She held out her hand none the less "Hi Sherlock. I'm Cynthia Watson and this is my husband Zachary Watson."
John yelped at the slap but knew he deserved it....slightly "I'm doing the right thing. I've got a kid on the way and God help me I love Sherlock. Just because I found it fast doesn't make it wrong."
Sherlock gained enough composure to turn towards John. Tears filled his eyes "John I-" another pain tore through him and he hunched over gasping.
I look at the brilliance that is you and I want nothing but it. I finally feel like I have something worth while to wake up for each morning (besides a good murder.)
John was having enough of this pricks attitude "I'm his bloody husband! I demand to see him!" He said slamming his hand down on the counter.
David smiled and walked over to the cradle. "Brilliant. Thank you." David then went to pick up his sleeping son.
Sherlock stood and semi shoved John "Non, vous êtes un menteur . Enfoiré! Regardez vos boules parce que je vais les couper ce soir!" Sherlock said then stormed away to the bedroom slamming the door.
“This matches your outfit princess!” Persephone yelled and wiped her red sauced hands on Chloe’s clothes. Chloe screamed and tried to fight her off but soon the girls were rolling on the floor trying to pull each other off.
John was trying to stay still while the tailor pinned the bottom of his pants to take them up. The announcement was in three days and each day gave him more anxiety. Tonight he was to have dinner with the royal family and it was making him nervous.
Sherlock relaxed a bit at that statement, apparently he wasn't ready for anyone to know what John was to him.
Bruce leaned forward on the table "I want to know what will become of my boy. Are you planning to stay with him? Is this a one time thing?"
John nodded "Yeah it's good to be back. I'm glad I could give my children an opportunity to live in London for the time being, until the ship me off somewhere else."
Sherlock stood in front of John as to shield him from from his family "I was the one to instigate this relationship. John is a willing participant and I will not have it said that's he's a common gold digger."
"I'm sorry John." Sherlock said sipping his wine and looking over John's shoulder to see his security looking back at them. "Maybe you should consider letting me arrange you your own security."
They managed to get in the car and then they were off to Buckingham Palace. Sherlock crossed is arms and slid down in his seat. Mycroft was giving his stupid superiority smile to his brother "You know we sent over the nice suit for a reason. I'm sure Mother and Father wouldn't appreciate you showing up in an old t-shirt and sweats."
Before he allowed himself to wallow in self pity there was a hard knock on the door. He struggled to get up for a second but eventually made his way over. When he opened the door he saw John being supported by Mike and Andrew clearly drunk out of his mind.
Sherlock gave a huff and narrowed his eyes "Not that's it's any of your business but no, she does not I was on my way to introduce John to our parents."
Charlotte crossed to be in the middle of them and cleared her throat. Both her parents looked up and when she was sure she had their attention she began. "I'm sorry for how I behaved and I wanted to let you know David and I came to an agreement. We're going to grow up apart from each other while I'm gone with the ballet company. I think it's best that I not be here for awhile. I know I'm putting stress on your relationship and it would be better if I was out of the picture."
John's eyes filled with tears as his heart broke with every one of Sherlocks words. "No, Sherlock. None of that is true. I do truly love you."
Sherlock was taken back by the kiss but after John spoke he grabbed his face and kissed him once more. "I can't ask you to hide away like we are committing some sort of crime."
Chloe walked over to her Dad and John handed her Caleb "Can you put Caleb down for his nap? My mattress is already in my room so he can lay down there."
