Cas shows up.
His morning is like all his mornings except, it’s Tuesday. He has the downtown route on Tuesday. It’s not that the route is hard or anything, but he hates having to fight with traffic. Residential areas are easier because it’s easier to maneuver around cars, toys, and other things people leave lying around. People are terrible drivers downtown. He just doesn’t have the time or energy to deal with them most of the time.
"I want to try, but it just doesn't seem like I can. I guess I want Sam and Cas to know that I'm okay. I want them to know that even though what happened happened, I’m not going to try anything."
“I know what it’s about and you should too,” Dean accuses. Cas does know and he’s been avoiding it. He doesn’t want Dean to backslide and if there was a time for it, it would be right about now.

“Oh, ol’ blue eyes, huh?” She laughs. Dean realizes there’s a story there, but doesn’t ask any questions.
“I’m sure. He’s a new kid. Just got here a few weeks ago. He’s nice.” Gabe says sadly. Dean knows what that means. Dean was nice once too. They like it when you’re nice.
Dean turns his head and meets Cas’s eyes. It’s not that he’s shocked, not really. It’s that he never thought in a million years that Cas would be the one to say it first. Not because Cas isn’t capable of love or anything but because he just wasn’t one to just say things.

“Thanks. I uh- I brought you something,” Dean hands her the folder and makes his way to the couch. It’s best if he’s sitting to talk about this in case he has a panic attack and passes out.

“You're brother is an ungrateful little shit.”
“Hello?” There is a female voice he doesn’t recognize on the other end. He’s only able to make out a few words in his sleepy haze, but they’re enough to have him running through his apartment gathering his things to get to his car as fast as possible.
If you or someone you know is feeling like ending their life, please call 1-800-273-8255.
“I wouldn’t expect anything less from you, Mr. Winchester.” Agent Mills says. She has a kind smile.
Dean spends his time not with Castiel thinking about Castiel. He still doesn’t talk much, but they see each other almost every day. Summer is coming to a close. Dean knows he’s going to have to leave Castiel behind and go back to school. It makes him feel sad. Besides Sam, Castiel is practically his only other friend. Sure he has a few kids he likes back home, but they aren’t his friends.
“Yes. Trust me, it will be worth it.”
“I don’t want you to go.” Dean says. Suddenly his hands are super interesting.
“Dean, focus.” His father’s words are harsh. Dean tips the kids head back again. His dad continues the compressions and Dean stares down at the kid’s face willing him to wake up. He starts to see movement behind the kid’s eyes and then they open. Dean’s hands drop to either side of the kid’s face and his whole world is now blue. A deep, sparkling ocean, blue. The bluest blue Dean has ever seen. Next, comes the kid’s breath and the coughing and vomiting. Dean carefully turns the kid’s head so the contents from his body will spill on the dock and not cause the kid to choke. John roughly shoves Dean to the side and lifts the boy by his shoulders. He places him in a sitting position, patting his back gently while he coughs. The neighbor is still mumbling, and Dean watches tears fall from his eyes.
Dean pours himself some coffee and waits. He takes a look at his watch. Six-thirty-four. He takes if off briefly to look at the back, running his finger over the letters. It’s weird to think that it was just given to him. Sam comes rushing out of the bedroom, hair soaking his shirt. His shoes and clothes are thrown on and he’s clutching his backpack like a madman.
“Yes, Sir,”  Dean replies and follows behind his dad. As he gets to the end of the dock, he takes Sam by the hand and leads him back to the house.
Dean sits on the couch facing away from his dad and puts his head in his hands. This isn’t the first time that this has happened and he’s sure it won’t be the last.
“Dean.”
He can picture Cas sitting there on his couch in the apartment they have shared for the last few months. He’s probably sitting in the light of the Christmas lights they put up a few days after Thanksgiving. He’s probably straining his ears to hear the sound of the Impala pulling into the parking lot. Or maybe he’s wrong. Maybe Cas left. Maybe he won’t be there when Dean gets back. He doesn’t want to think about that so he carefully dials Charlie. She picks up on the first ring. He explains what happened and she listens without saying a word and she promises to let Cas know that he’s on his way back and that he’ll never ever leave Cas again.
That’s all is says and that’s all Dean will need until they see each other again.
“Oh, thank God!”
“What just happened?” Benny asks, now at Dean’s side.

"Dean, I love you. I can't imagine my life without you. I know that you know that, but I feel like I need to remind you.."
“I-I just wanted-I’m sorry.”

He gives Gabe a small smile and heads down the alley to the tent. He gets catcalled a few times by the locals it makes him want to take a three-hour shower and scrub his skin until there is nothing left but bone. He gets to the tent and waits. There are no sounds coming from inside so he rings the small bell next to it. There’s no answer.
“Don’t ask me to stay.”
He sits and watches the other patrons in the place. There is a couple in the corner leaning in towards each other talking quietly and laughing. There are a couple of families with kids and an older gentleman at the counter sipping his coffee. He smiles at the simplicity of it all. Sam shows up a few moments later.
“I told you not to look for me,” Cas states. It’s the first thing he’s said directly to Benny.
“I like it,” he says and Dean smiles.
Things are going to kinda shift and move a little quicker now. Thank you for reading. I appreciate it a lot. :) If you have any questions please ask!

“I understand pain and regret and I understand having a past that you want to run from,” Cas says and starts walking again. His tone wasn’t angry, but there was some pain there. Cas leaves Dean standing next to his car confused and wondering what the fuck just happened. This was not how he imagined his day going.
“I suppose I take after my mother in that area,” He says simply. Benny pauses and looks at Dean who meets his eyes. It’s like he’s trying to convey some kind of message. Like something important had happened and he missed it.
"Dean, how does that make you feel?"
“Okay,” I tell him and sit up and scoot to the side of the bed. I’ve topped a few times but never like this. This is different and suddenly I’m kinda terrified of what this means. We had already broken rules and now this. Something is happening, but I can’t quite figure out what it is. All I know is I’m about to fuck Cas. I look at him one more time and the desire and want are back in his eyes.
“Mr. Winchester. Castiel Novak, I represent Heaven’s Gate Development.”
“I can just... keep watch outside.” He says.
Cas watches him in the manner of a gazelle waiting for a sudden deadly movement. Dean's gaze flits to Cas’ lips again.
“You’re serious?”
There were three reasons Dean wasn't going out there.
“I’m sorry if I worried you, Dean. I told you I was fine.”
He didn’t know where the hell Dean had gone, but once Cas emerged from the last stall to rip off the mask, lower back aching and shoulders horribly sore, it wasn’t long before Dean popped up in the front doorway.
“What kind of things?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Please let me know what you think or if you have any questions or comments!
“Do it,” He breathes. I move my hand down to my dick and line it up. Cas’s nails are digging into my back in anticipation and I slowly push in. The heat is almost too much. I don’t think this is going to last long. I push in slowly and wait a few moments for him to get adjusted.
He thinks.
"Normal things?”

“Sam is your brother?” Cas asks and takes another huge bite of his burger ignoring the napkin in front of him. They hadn’t really talked about their families before. They hadn’t really talked about anything before. Dean had tried to avoid talking about himself too much. He didn’t want people to get too attached in case he had to leave again. It’s not like he’s on the run, but after a few years he gets that nagging feeling that he has to leave and start all over again.
The strange phone calls don’t stop.
I know I shouldn’t move because we have an agreement that I’m to do as I’m told. Just standing there in his doorway when he’s this close to me is too much and I lean forward to place a kiss on his full lips. He pulls away from me and grabs me by the hair on the back of my head. He pulls me inside his apartment and slams the door without letting go of me. It hurts, but it feels so good. I need the pain and he knows it.
Confused? That's okay! Head back to the very beginning to re-read the story with all the new additions.

," He thinks, standing to walk back to his room. He was almost to his door when he hears Cas call out to him.
“I help where I can, but sometimes I feel like I’m not doing enough. Most of these people are good people. They just...they’re doing what they have to do.” Dean doesn’t miss the way that Castiel’s voice changes when talking about people doing what they have to do. He knows the kinds of things people have to do to survive. Cas turns and starts walking towards the tents. Dean follows.
“Fuck, Cas.” I have lost the ability to think. He’s perfect. Laying there fucking himself with his own fingers. I crawl up the length of Cas’ body and kiss him. His arms come up around my neck and he rolls his hips up to me. His erection pressing into my stomach.
Dean drives for nearly two days. He knows he hasn’t made a smart choice but being out here in the open is better than being in the bunker watching Cas give up his life for some half assed vengeance mission he and his brother started 8 years ago.
“You’ve been drying that same dish for ten minutes. What’s going on?”
"Thanks, Cas. You're pretty great yourself."
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dean?” Cas pokes his head in the doorway of Dean’s room, causing Dean to stop pacing and look at Cas for the first time in a few days, “I was going to make a trip to the store..but I’m...I’m not myself. Would you take me?”
Next Update: April 13th.
“I dunno, guy stuff?” Of course, it comes out like a question. Charlie plops down in the chair next to him and scoffs. He’s clearly not passing any of her tests.

The day approaches quicker than he had anticipated. He does his best not to show how nervous he is, but he can sense that Cas knows. He's been extra helpful. Making Dean breakfast in the morning, offering to wash his hair in the shower. He even brought him his pills and offered to drive to the appointment. That part wasn't going to happen, but Dean appreciated the effort.
“I had no idea, Cassie. Why didn’t you say something?”
“Do you have it?” I ask. I know he does. I don’t need to ask. He places a hand on my waist and pushes me until my back hits the ledge of the counter. I hear a sound and I’m sure he placed the container on the counter behind me. His hands find their way to my back. His fingers play with the hem of my shirt as his lips kiss up my collarbone and neck. I let out a breath that I didn’t realize I was holding.
“How do I know this ‘Dean’ is gonna help me out?” Benny stands facing the angel.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Cas, I’m glad you called.” It’s not a lie. In truth, he had been missing him all week. It was nice to have someone there even if it was awkward half the time they talked. They never really talked about anything substantial until the day Dean went to the camp and even that wasn’t an actual conversation.
The next time Dean sees Andy he’s a completely different person. He’s cleaned up and almost shiny. He’s in uniform and Dean can’t help but think he looks really good.
"I agree," Cas says. Sam nods.
“Thank you, Charlie,” Dean says and walks over to talk with her in the kitchen. Cas stands there in awe of the man he loves. In the past, Dean would have totally shut down and ignored her comment. He would have rather talked about his failed conversion therapy than his mother. This was big. This was monumental and Cas isn’t sure he can deal. He watches the two as they share a short hug. Dean looks up and Cas and his face changes to something a little darker. It’s there and then it’s gone.
"That asshole was trying to get Benny to do business with him. Turns out that sad sack is wanted in like seven states for drug trafficking." She's just finished talking when the agent and Benny walk out.
"I'm sorry, Dean." Sorry? He was sorry. Dean took a deep breath and turned to face Cas. Anger was the only thing motivating him at this point.
“Do you want to go on a walk with me?” Dean asks. Castiel’s eyes widen, then he nods.
“I don’t need him looking at me any other way than he already does. He would be embarrassed that his brother was some kind of street whore.”
“I want you so fucking bad, Cas. So fucking bad.”
“Charlie, could you check on the order again? I think I missed some things.”
“I’m not leaving with you. I can’t go back,” Cas looks towards Dean to make sure he doesn’t hear their conversation.
"I'm in awe of you." He says simply.
Tumblr? sawyerday.tumblr.com
My thigh slots between his legs and I lean into him while holding him in place against the wall. He feels perfect moving against me. Grinding his erection against my leg like he was born to do it. His breath hitches and he lets out a low groan. I kiss him hard and turn us so his back is to the door. I push him back until he’s up against it and reach behind him to find the lock and flip it into place.
Dean drives home more confused than anything. Why had Cas made it a point to come out at that moment? He didn’t seem angry. It was like he just wanted Dean to know, but didn’t want to talk about it further. Maybe it was his way of saying that he understands and that he’s there if Dean needs anything. He had blurted it out and took off before Dean had time to process anything.
Day three Dean wakes up early with the intent to make Cas a giant breakfast. He walks out to the living room, but Cas isn’t on the couch. His bedding is folded in a neat pile and his shoes and backpack are gone.
Gabriel takes his brother’s hand and holds it for a long time. He doesn’t want to let it go ever again. He knows there is more to this story, but he doesn’t know if he can listen right now. Right now, he wants to go to his mother's house and burn it down.
They stare at each other until the timer in the kitchen goes off. Dean turns and leaves Cas sitting on the stairs. Seeing Dean should be making him happy. He should want to hug him and kiss him all over but all he feels is fear and uncertainty. What if this is one of the last times that he sees Dean and he’s not even allowed to touch him? What if Dean decides that Cas is better off without him and disappears?
“Cas, this isn’t your fault,” Dean stands up. He doesn’t want Cas to know about his past. He doesn’t want to see the look on Cas’s face when he knows what he did.
“You sure?”
Hunting is a job that guarantees death. It guarantees pain and suffering and it also guarantees losing people. It meant losing a battle that shouldn’t have ever been started. Sure, there had been some good times. There were small victories, but they were quickly pushed to the side when something bigger came along. They never had a day off. There was no time for celebration of birthdays or holidays. There was no time for mourning loved ones who were ripped from the world too soon.
Sam left for school with a fat wallet and an even fatter savings account. Dean didn’t tell him that he had nearly a quarter million dollars saved up for Sam and himself. Dean had just simply told him not to worry about anything and he would give him money as he needed. Dean watched Sam’s spending and sent him three hundred a week. Sam still got a part time job and saved most of what Dean sent him. The largest purchases he made were books and computer programs.
“Who’s this?” She asks looking at Dean. She then promptly stuffs the bagel in her mouth. She stares at Dean while she chews and it makes him feel like a bug under a magnifying glass.
Next, was page after page of typed text. Most of the pages have been blacked out and there are notes written in the margins. Phone numbers, addresses, and states. He skimmed the parts he was able to read, but one part stuck out the most:
He arrives at the motel in early afternoon with nothing but his wallet, jacket, a duffle bag filled with clothes, and few necessities should he run into trouble. The motel is old and creaked in all the right places and he felt oddly at home there. It reminds him of Bobby’s house when he spots the floor to ceiling bookshelf on the far wall. Dean smiles at the thought of Bobby and his books but he doesn’t let the thought linger too long. Thinking about Bobby means accepting that he’s dead. He knows Bobby is gone but who wants to think about the finality of death of their loved ones? He wants his death to be final but thinking about it for others while he was still living is maddening.
“This isn’t your house. This is Dean’s house. He pays for everything. He buys the food and cooks our meals. Hell, he’s even paid rent a few times.”
Sorry it took so long to update. I moved again...
Dean walks to the couch and picks up his jacket and shoes. He slips them on and leaves the other two standing in his living room without saying a word. He has to get away from them. He can’t let them get more hurt than they already have. He has to leave town. Maybe if he goes, Alistair will follow him and leave them alone. Maybe he won’t hurt them anymore.
“You’re right. It won’t-”
“Tell him I’ll be back in a few days to collect.” Crowley makes a face at the cupcake and then drops it on the floor, “You should get someone to clean that up.”
“I bother you?” He asks quickly. His face is very serious. Dean takes a step back and puts his hands up in defense.

“Cas, please don’t.” Dean pleads half-heartedly. Cas takes another step forward. Dean feels light headed. He knows Cas wants to show him more, but he’s not ready. He closes his eyes. He doesn’t want to hear about Cas’ pain anymore or think about Benny. Even with the truth hanging out there in the open he still doesn’t want to reach out and grab it.
Dean keeps his mouth shut but continues looking at Benny who had already gone back to sharpening his blade. Does he love Cas? Of course he does, he’s his best friend. But does he
He looks down and see’s his phone buzzing on the coffee table. He picks it up and stares at it for a moment before he finally answers.
Dean paces back in forth in front of Sam who is practically buried in papers, books, and lore. It seems like the only time that Sam is relaxed these days is when he’s in the library, searching through stacks and stacks of information, or organizing paperwork that’s older than dirt. The eight foot table is totally covered except for the small area around Sam’s laptop.
“Dad, come on. Let's get you in bed.” Dean says and stands, turning to face his father. He ignores the tears stinging in his eyes and walks to the kitchen and reaches for his dad's arm.
“Benny,” Dean eyes Benny from where he sits, his back up against a tree, “Do you think we’re going to find him?”
Even though his shower had relaxed his body, his mind is still racing with thoughts of what’s going on at the bunker. He takes a few more gulps of whiskey and sits at the table in his towel waiting for the thoughts of Cas to slip away. He’s just over half way though with the bottle before he’s drunk enough to get into bed and have a real nights sleep. He stumbles to the bed and falls on top of the blankets, his towel still secure around his waist. Somewhere in the back of his mind he knows no matter what happens now he won’t remember it in the morning.
glanced
It’s around noon and near the end of his route when Dean takes a break and parks the truck for lunch. His lunch isn’t much, but he enjoys his turkey sandwich and chips. He doesn’t usually eat in the truck, but he’s running a little late due to the horrific traffic. Summer is nearly over and everyone is coming back to town to get ready for winter and the school year. When he’s finished with his sandwich and chips he opens his water and takes a few sips to wash it all down. He’s screwing the cap back on when his phone rings.
Dean doesn’t go to school.
"I guess it's my turn to apologize. God, we really are a bunch of idiots, aren’t we?”
“It’s not so bad,” Andy says before Dean can get a word out.

“Don’t do that.”
“Yeah, sure,” Dean shoves his hands in his pockets as they walk back to the line in front of Benny.
“Good. That’s really good,” She says. He takes a quick peek at her face and she looks genuinely happy for him, but there is a hint of sadness in her voice that makes Dean wonder what the story behind the sadness is.
“I’m not going anywhere, Dean. It’s spring break.” Cas laughs and wraps an arm around his friend.
“Yes, sir. My brother got into Stanford.”

“I’ll do it. But, I’ll kill you if I have to,” He says. He doesn’t know this vampire but he decides that finding Cas is more important than letting this vampire go. Everything inside Dean screams for him to run the other way but he needs to find Cas and if this vampire has any information, he needs to find out what it is.
“What the fuck is going on?”
“Samm-”
“What are we doing here, Cas?” Dean asks, feeling defeated and confused.

“Come on, man. You gotta go if you gotta go.”
“Bring him back.” Sam says. His voice is too calm. It’s too even and it makes Dean worry. He’s clearly keeping something from him. Dean stares at Cas’ lifeless body and he regrets ignoring him. What if this had been the last time that he got to see him? What if this was it? He looks down at his hand. It doesn’t burn anymore but it’s warm to the touch. It reminds him of the time Cas healed him. His wounds had disappeared but his skin had been warm where the wounds had been. He closes his phone and turns the car around and heads back to the bunker.
“What does that make me, then?”
“Sorry, dear, just scarfing dinner.” She said, balling up the napkin and tugging the front of her vest straighter. It had several birdhouses and a white picket fence on the front, along with what could only be described as an outbreak of flowers.
Dean shrugged. “You always talked about what you were working on at your internship. Like it was all you had time to do.”
“It was a mistake.”
“It’s not pasteurized. I’ll get sick.”
“Because you have a bed. I’m kipping here. Scram.”
Castiel waited patiently with his open listening face on. Dean sat back.
“You’ll need those, though.” Dean threw him a cheeky wink and stepped back inside.
Dean gave the facial equivalent of a shrug. “I saw an opportunity. Ain’t sorry I took it.”
It was starting to sink in that he was going to have to get up at the crack of dawn tomorrow and drive back out to the farm, drive back out to
Sam draped Cas' rescued trench coat over Eileen's shoulder, breaking away to creep up to Dean's motel room window, ready to bang on it and crow HAPPY NEW YEAR at the top of his voice. Eileen was already giggling when she saw Sam completely lock up, mouth agape. Her stomach tightened.
“He is not taking other offers. This is his ultimatum. We agree to this, or nothing.” Castiel said. “Remove me and send someone else in, find out for yourself. This

“I mean I’m more like her babysitter, not her owner.” Dean said, swinging back over the fence and dropping onto the grass. “Wilma belongs to this kid in town, Jack. He comes out to visit her, maintain her stall, look after her. Part of the 4-H program.”
And if Dean could pry him out…
Dean seemed to take his hesitation as confirmation. Those eyes, the eyes that Castiel realized he was still

“Bracing, ain’t it?” Dean said, gleeful. He twisted the sack around so Cas could read what was printed on the side.
“Hey, uh, you eat yet this morning?”
Cas went to plunk down on the padded bench but jumped back in alarm when a shape darted suddenly from underneath it. Dean wasn’t phased at all, he just watched the dark thing run across the yard as he reached for the screen door to go inside.
Castiel turned and scanned the yard, squinting towards the barn that he’d passed on his way up to the house. There was a pen with a low fence on the side that faced the house, and if Castiel knew his farm animals, the three dirty lumps he could see inside were probably pigs, mud-bathing in the shade of the hot afternoon. Across from the barn there was a large, grassy paddock, and the gravel drive cut between the two like a chaperone at a middle school dance. Past the stretch of paddock there was nothing but trees; rows upon rows of them that swallowed the bend in the gravel road and made the main road impossible to see.
Cas glowered at him.
“Sam.”

“I was probably in the
“Won’t the milk go bad?”
“Very perceptive.” Castiel agreed, sitting up straighter and opening the folder between them on the table. Dean dropped his chair back onto all four legs.
Except if Dean woke up to find them like this, it wouldn’t be all smiles and endearments. It would be a panicked scramble to disentangle, a cleared throat, an escape to the bathroom. Then, when he emerged, they wouldn’t talk about it. He’d be gruffer with Cas, all careful distance and back slaps, and he might not even hug Cas goodbye when he went to leave, despite the fact that they always did. Cas didn’t want that. So he was going to absorb this moment like the dried-up, cracking sponge he was, and then he was going to pull away. Any second now.
Cas woke up with his arm trapped and the strange impression that he had tumbled into a ravine. He was only mostly horizontal, and lying on top of something very lumpy. And warm. And… moving. He opened bleary eyes.
He swirled the last dregs of his beer at the bottom of the bottle, tossed it back, and set the empty bottle aside on the thin motel carpet.
, Dean, chicken eggs are white or brown.”
“Asleep? Yes. I thought that was the idea.”
He could feel springs underneath himself and vaguely wondered how old that made this mattress, then decided that wasn’t a productive line of thinking if he planned to get any sort of sleep here. Pulling his tie loose, he turned his head to look at the briefcase beside him, still open like a boxy leather mouth yawning. The contract was with his laptop, poking upside-down from the top of the padded pocket. He could see the full, round swoops of the D and the W in Dean’s signature, like a damn work of art next to Castiel’s sharper, more succinct handwriting. He stared at the name until it blurred out of focus.
“…That’s all kinds of cryptic, man.”
“Sam.”
feel good about it. Not even a little bit.
“It’s not very sporting.” Dean agreed, unwrapping his sandwich. He took a bite out of it that made Cas’ jaw ache just to look at. Dean glanced over at him. “Don’t like ham salad?”
He rinsed out his mouth, stared at his reflection in the mirror for a long moment, and then turned out the light.
Dean emerged from the barn up ahead, leading the red and white cow with just a gentle hand on the side of her neck. He caught sight of Castiel and tipped his chin up.
“Who’s this?”
.” Cas said, pushing himself back to sitting. His heart was still racing. Dean paused in his approach in order to clutch his knees and laugh, and Cas scooped the wrapped sandwich from the grass, as annoyed as he was embarrassed.
Cas didn't have a comeback for that one apart from a half-hearted shove to Dean's arm. When Dean checked from the corner of his eye, the tiny smile was back. He settled in further on the couch.
Cas squinted up at the cloud again, watching the tattered, raw-cotton edges shift and morph. He let his eyes slide out of focus.
Jo glanced between them, then grabbed Dean by the elbow.

Cas clamped it under his arm and picked up two of the smaller milking pails, following Dean back out into the pastel light of the breaking dawn. Dean had the largest milk pail up on one broad shoulder, two smaller ones on his other arm. Cas tallied up the pails and glanced towards the paddock.
Dean rapped his knuckles on the sad blue paint. 'Blue' was generous. It was only blue in the way that blueschist might be.
“Rule number ultimate.” He said, turning to Castiel. “
Cas really wanted to hate him.
“You want Winchester Farm, you’re going to have to

"That's what the cheese drawer is for."
There was a sticky silence.
In one fluid, sweeping motion, Dean bent and tossed the bundle at Cas. It hit him square in the chest and he managed to prevent it from falling onto the dirty floor by jerking one leg up and fumbling the bundle in a rather undignified, first-day-with-the-new-limbs manner; but ultimately, he caught it. Dean seemed mildly impressed.
The thought of going back out into the blazing afternoon sun, cramming the clammy landscaping gloves back over his blistered hands and digging into the manure kind of made him want to die. But this was exactly Dean’s plan. Teach the businessman a lesson, make him regret everything, send him packing. It would be pathetic to cave on day one. Castiel was stronger than that. He had to be stronger than that.
“Look, Sammy, passing out is passing out, sitting or lying down. This is a
“I don’t care how far you torque up the charm. You’re just wasting my goddamn time, and your own. The only way you’re leaving this farm with
He slapped off the disgusting landscaping gloves and just let them drop into the grass, grabbing the mason jar in his sweat-tacky hands and nearly draining it in its entirety, desperately parched and overheated as he was. Dean gave an awkward laugh.

Dean raised his eyebrows at him, waiting, and it was the little
Two, a packed room full of buzzed strangers meant he had to turn on the charm, and he just didn't feel very charming after such a long fucking day. Plus, the collar of his coat wasn't quite high enough to hide the stinging scar angry across the back of his neck, just cutting into the hairline, and he'd be happy to avoid the cheeky improv that curious eyes required. The gash was a souvenir from the hunt, just par for the damn course. Bitch had dragged him across the scrap-laden floor of the workshop and thrown him into a bench before Cas got her beneath the shoulder blades. Dean was still acutely aware of his back and all the ways in which it smarted, so, better he just continue to laze around here on his stomach.
“Jerk.” Sam mutters from the backseat, almost inaudible.
Cas scowled at him and Dean just laughed, resting his head into the crook between Clementine’s belly and her back leg as he milked. Cas watched for a while in silence.
“That looks like some hard thinkin’ for such an early hour.” Dean said, his voice rumbling through Cas’ hand and cheek. His thumb stroked absently at Cas’ shoulder. He wondered if Dean even knew he was doing it.
“That was Bobby.”
“Is that

He smiled around his swig.

“Castiel.”
Dean glanced at the tv across the room. All focus was up on the glittering ball now, flashing and winking in its slow descent towards the four digits below.
“Yes, I am aware.”
“Coulda fooled me. Go check Jemima over there.” Dean said, indicating a nesting box at the end of the row. The egg that Cas pulled out was a light sage green.
“Make yourself cozy.” He said, turning to the sink and soaping up all the way to his elbows. He scrubbed extra hard at the yellow residue on his arms. “You want some lemonade?”
“Not at all. I’ll fill you in when I know more.”
“Here we
“You know what?” Dean said, tossing the paper onto the table and leaning back in his chair again. “You’ve convinced me. I’ll negotiate.”
At the first touch of Dean’s lips, Cas melts. A tiny sound escapes him, not quite a sigh, not quite a moan, and he’s grasping Dean’s shoulder like it’s the only thing preventing him from falling into the footwell. Their mouths part with a soft, wet noise and Cas meets Dean’s eyes, almost too close to focus on.
Dean almost sprayed his swig of beer. "Bitch thinks he's
Castiel swallowed hard. “What… do I do?”
“Was I…?” He clears his throat. “Uh.”
“No, Dean.” Cas grit out, because he absolutely would not give Dean the satisfaction. He closed his hand to protect his smarting palm and drained the entire water bottle, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. He grimaced when he felt hay dust against his lips.
“Is there going to be enough, um. Manure.”

Cas flinched when Dean suddenly lifted an arm to point at the sky.
Castiel met his own eyes in the rear-view mirror. The scattered scraps of his rational brain worried that Zachariah was right, and that he was in the middle of making the most egregious mistake of his life. He refocused on the chicken in the yard, the one that he could barely convince across a short stretch of grass. His pulse thundered in his own ears.
tomorrow. He can't pull Dean more flush against his side without the risk of waking him and sending him into a conniption of bruised heterosexuality, so instead, he carefully lifts his arm. It works perfectly: Dean slides forward, falling to lying down with his head in Cas' lap.

“Do that again.”
“It’s lonely.” Cas admitted, a tiny thing almost lost in the space between them. Dean forgot his tight stomach to the horrible sensation of his heart cracking. Cas was quick to keep talking, as if he could bury the confession if he babbled enough.
Dean grabbed two empty boxes that were waiting in the cargo bed and tossed them at Cas without warning.
The quiet hiss of an open line. Dean pressed the phone tighter to his ear, eyebrows scrunching.
“Thank you, Dean.” He said, mystified.
“Nah. You gotta be firm else we’d be here all night. Good forearm workout, though.”

“Goodnight, Dean. Sam.” Cas murmurs.
“Well not so fast there, slick.” Dean said, thumbing over his shoulder at the pigpen. “You can only get so wet.”
Castiel’s mouth pinched. “It’s all I have.”
Castiel’s attention caught on the chicken from earlier as it emerged from behind a raised bed and began to explore the open yard. The hen’s tawny feathers were outlined in a vibrant blue that caught the late afternoon sun, like it was draped in an iridescent lace. He watched the way that it walked — unhurried, unbeholden to superiors, free from the minefield of diplomatic manipulation, unaffected by the beauty of
Dean’s eyes twitched narrower, looking Cas up and down.
Somehow Cas hadn’t expected this whole ordeal to include three meals a day, but then here Dean was again, making sure he got fed. He wished that made this feel any less like a prison sentence. At least the food in this situation was exceptionally better.
“It’s my day off, bossman. What’s on fire.” A voice said by way of greeting.
fast.” Dean gestured to the soft bundle Cas was holding. “Put those on.”
“Why not?” Dean deflected, and pulled the milking stool up to sit right at Clementine’s back haunch. He grabbed one of the pails — the one without the cheesecloth over it — and set it under her udder. “Go on, dump it in.”

Two large cardboard boxes stood open on the kitchen table. Cas was just tucking one last carton of eggs inside when he heard the sound of tires on gravel. Dean leaned backwards to peer down the hall and out the front screen door.

He did it.
Castiel tied the repurposed flannel around his waist and tried not to feel colossally stupid.

Dean looked smug.
The trouble is, nothing short of a fucking catastrophe could pull his eyes away from this. Dean is so beautiful, so calm and easy in his slumber, and he's right
Dean went straight to the back, where several pails covered in cheesecloth sat on the floor beside a strange sort of platform that looked like a low wooden chair with a very long seat. A short three-legged stool stood nearby, with a neatly rolled bundle of something soft on top.
The room was green. Wasn’t that just the goddamn color of the day.
WELCOME TO FARMBOY!!
was sun-bleached hair standing up in brassy spikes; prominent freckles dusted liberally across soft, sun-kissed skin; big, striking green eyes and full pink lips, framed by stubble that shone copper and gold in the afternoon sun. Even with sweat and dirt on his face and some strange yellowish residue streaked on the bare skin of his arms,
in one another.
Outside, the drumming rain gradually eased into a soothing, steady patter. Looking south, stars were starting to peek through sinewy gaps in the cloud banks. Dean's eyes grew heavy as he half-watched the quiet black and white film, his long day, long drive, and subsequent adrenaline crash catching up with him. It took longer and longer to open his eyes following each blink –
“Nothing." He said, and sat up. "Seriously, man, you’re gunnin' to make a stop sign jealous. Sunscreen up.”
Cas took it. The milk inside was so fresh it was still warm.
Dean met his eyes, forced to cross them slightly, their faces were so close.
yesterday afternoon meant there was a lot left to do and little time to do it, so fair warning, there might be a few broken eggs. So it goes.” He indicated the nearest chicken with a flick of his eyes. Castiel recognized the amber feathers and blue lace of the one that had untied his shoe yesterday.
Castiel blinked.
Cas had thrown his arms around Dean, half knocking the wind out of him. Dean set a hand on his back, nonplussed. Sure, they’d hugged before, plenty of times. But this was wrong. It was desperate, almost like a frightened child.
Dean slipped out of the paddock and dropped the latches, giving the gate a good rattle to double-check that it held.
Dean snorted and started walking off. When Cas didn’t follow, he beckoned him over with an exaggerated arm motion.
“D’you make a new friend?” Dean’s voice interrupted, and Cas refocused to find Dean standing, a small paper cup in one hand. Dean indicated the red bucket that Cas was still holding to his chest. Cas set it aside and Dean offered him the cup.
“Didn’t have much time to spruce the place up for visitors.” Dean said, clapping Cas’ shoulder and causing him to sway forward. “I normally gather eggs when I’m tucking the girls in for the night, but certain
Cas looked up to find Dean blocking the sunlight. He’d changed into a soft grey henley, clean and dry, and Cas tried not to burn with jealousy.
He could hate himself later. He always did.
"Is that a caution or an insult?"
Cas clenched his jaw, snapped the dust mask into place, and had at.
Dean’s fingertips grazed the edge of his phone in his jeans pocket. He pulled it out, tapping it against his palm and chewing at his lip. He turned the phone right-side up and dialed.
If he’d ever even had it.
“Yep.” Dean kicked at the bottom of the screen door to the house, making it bounce in its casing, and caught it on the edge of his boot before it closed. He popped his eyebrows at Cas and then held the door open with his hip. “Kitchen counter next to the stove.” He told him.
“How many
It was too dark to see much in Cas’ expression, until the room lit in a brilliant strobe of purple-tinted lightning. It revealed the soft, all-in-the-eyes smile that Dean always wanted to fold up and keep in his pocket for rainy days. Like today.
Jesus. This,
“Bad fucking idea.” Dean snaps. “I wake up in the middle of the night and see you out there lurking, I might shoot you between the eyes. You’re staying in the damn car.”
“Uh, alright.” Ash said, still sounding skeptical. “Thanks.”
And what the hell had that comment been over lunch, watching clouds? Dean had assumed Michael must’ve been a friend of Castiel’s, but when he’d been corrected (a fucking
“You’re the guest here,

He tasted like fruit, like peaches and berries and the sharp tang of alcohol, it was simultaneously something so innocent yet absolutely
He’d gone from T-900 Businessman to someone uncomfortable in the stiff lines of his suit and everything it represented, someone legitimately wounded by Dean’s harsh words, someone that didn’t want to be where he was and doing what he was doing before he’d pulled himself back under control again. It set off alarm bells in Dean’s head, because he knew that look. He’d seen it in the mirror.
"You should tell him."

"Six." Cas reached into his suit jacket and placed an assorted handful of party poppers in Dean's lap.

"Fine. Since it's utterly wasted on you,
Castiel ran the cold tap and splashed his face and the back of his neck. He used the hand towel to scrape off the dirt and sweat and then just dropped it, crumpled, onto the side of the sink.
Dean blew a raspberry. "Best keep working on that tight five, Chuckles, cuz that ain't it."
Castiel took a step back to glance out the glass door of the motel office. The small parking lot was next to empty save for his rental car, a rusty pickup truck, and a blue Dodge Neon that was parked right outside the office door. The faded sign suction-cupped to the window was flipped to say “OPEN”, and there was nothing on the desk that indicated someone had been here and would return shortly. The ancient desktop computer sat dark.
“Don’t make it weird, Cas.”
He glanced towards the bowls drying in the dish drainer as he pulled a beer from the fridge. Damn, and the way Cas always seemed
There was a subtle wooshing sound, the familiar snap of feathers, and then a body sat down heavily on the end of the mattress, jostling him. Dean raised his head to find Cas, missing his trench coat and with his tie almost completely pulled apart, hiking one knee up onto the mattress to face him.
“What?”
“Just Dean is fine.” The man said, eyeing the folder under Castiel’s arm. His eyes grew slightly narrower, but his outward demeanor didn’t otherwise change. “Here, uh… let’s get out of the sun. You look like you burn easy.”
“Careful. It gets sloppiest under the roosts.”
Dean dropped his arm and looked up at Cas with his eyebrows pinched into tildes. “Really? Bit rusty in the imagination department there, Agent Smith.”
, all of it clinging to his aching body like a disgusting aura. He was surprised Madge hadn’t tried to chase him off the motel property with a broom, shrieking that he go back to the lagoon from whence he came.
That had been a theme all day, hadn’t it. Dean shouldn’t be finding this jackass cute at all, no matter how small the ways.
"Tell him what?"
“What was your name again? Cas-something-or-the-other?”
when you see small furry things, because you
Castiel shook his head. “I don’t see it that way.”
Cas narrowed his eyes. “How long have you been awake?”
Cas looked down at his hands. Dean leaned in until he caught his eye again.
ladies, Jolene and Dolly.” Dean said, pointing to each in turn, and then patted the smaller pig that was standing between his legs. It was pink and had normal ears, more like what first came to mind when Cas thought of pigs. “And
The chicken only shifted and made a low, annoyed warbling sound. Castiel pulled the egg out without incident and no small amount of relief.
“Ass. Why aren’t you freaking out?”
"It kinda fuckin' is." Dean says, hoarse.
“Thank you, Dean.”
The neon “NO” is hidden behind an overgrown shrub, so Dean pulls the Impala into the motel parking lot before they can see that it is, in fact, lit.
"Do you want to find out?"
There was movement from the direction of his car. A chicken came around the front bumper, casually strutting towards the house, pausing to peck at the ground in a noncommittal sort of way. Castiel glanced at the paddock, where he could see several chickens roaming freely, but
“You’re telling me the marketing team wouldn’t have a field day spinning something like this in our favor?”
She dragged Dean away past the front bumper of the truck and immediately leaned in for a vehement discussion, her eyes intense.
Nothing said he couldn’t be petty.
Had he truly met a human when he’d met Dean Winchester today?
“Awesome.” Dean says in a tone that clearly doesn’t think so, and whips the car around to pull back onto the dark road. They immediately hit a pothole and Sam’s head bumps the ceiling.
There was nobody at the front desk.
Dean’s shoulders shove up under his ears. “You turn eyes like that on some innocent girl she’s gonna up and devote her entire life to you, Cas, I’m just letting you know you gotta tone it down!”
He grabbed the damn folder and hauled himself up out of the rental car, the gravel crunching under his shoes. The afternoon sun beat down on him from the bone-dry central Kansas sky, making him squint hard. On the front porch, a small set of wind chimes tinkled gently to itself in the stagnant breeze. Castiel eyed the rampant weeds that spilled from the flower bed beside the porch steps, a ratty mess of tall stems and dense, scrubby vegetation with sporadic flowerheads that poked through the balusters of the porch railing like the faces of curious children.
his pasta salad tonight, and it had been subtle but still very clear that Cas thought it was the best thing he’d ever put past those soft pink lips. It was in the way his shoulders loosened a little bit and he’d kind of curled over the bowl, like he was afraid Dean might try to whisk it away from him. It was almost adorable.
any friends. He had to, right? Even oddballs and idiots and douchebags found their people.
"Y'know, the countdown." Dean said, gesturing to the tv with his beer.
Dean just nodded behind a sip of his own coffee. He glanced down the front hall at the sound of tires on gravel again and shoved the coffee aside on the counter, grabbing a small styrofoam cooler from one side of the fridge. He nodded at Cas’ plate on his way out the back door.
“Come on, Le Pew, front porch.” Dean said. “Then you can knock off for the day, cuz
“Learn somethin’ new every day.” He dismissed, and waved at Cas to hurry up. “
“Cas, hey. You alright m—”
Dean shut the kitchen door on the backyard, the porch light barely reaching all the way out to the raised beds. He was really proud of that duck manure idea. That had been fucking
“Okay?”
When Sam returns, approaching the Impala with caution, he finds his brother asleep with his angel hugged against him like a large, man-shaped teddy bear. Cas glances up, clocking the motion of Sam leaning over to peer through the driver’s window, and there’s a smile on his face that Sam’s never seen on him before.

little sausage is Wilma. Though technically, she’s not mine.”
Castiel rolled up his metaphorical sleeves.
“Hello?” Castiel called.
"Cas. You–"
Dean watched him take a discreet, steadying breath.
“Alright, that’s good for now.” He said, dusting off his hands.
It was Dean!
Dean stepped out into the rainy evening and finally had a chance to check his phone. He could feel it buzzing in his pocket earlier but wasn’t in a situation where he could answer it.
Besides, if he actually managed to pull this off, it could mean big things for him. Maybe his superiors would finally sit up and pay attention, maybe they’d finally think about paying him more like what he deserves. Maybe he would finally be able to afford something nicer than his shitty one-bedroom apartment with its defunct dishwasher, that one window that won’t close all the way, and the buckling bathroom floor.
“Why would I turn eyes like this on some innocent girl?”
Castiel was staring again. He really wasn’t fond of feeling thrown sideways by every little thing that came out of Dean Winchester’s mouth. He shut his jaw with a clack of teeth.
“So how the fuck was I to know? And why are you out here sleeping on the couch?”

“Fine. I’m done.”
“… Dean. I think you’ll —“
Dean was looking at him strange.

that this was what Dean had been waiting for, had been
The pitchfork came at him horizontally and hit him across the hipbones. He clamped it against his thighs before it could clatter to the barn floor.
Castiel nodded.
"You love him."
To be this close to Dean, to wake up beside him, to feel him breathe in the soft, unhurried quiet of a day just beginning. To lay his head on his chest, just like this, and listen to his heart. To see his lashes lift like stage curtains, revealing the beloved green of his eyes, and watch a smile curve onto pink lips, feel his sleep-rough voice rumble an amused

The short hair over Dean's ear is mussed from the way he was slumped like a grumpy turtle past the collars of his shirt and jacket. Delicate, Cas brushes it right again.
“Good, cuz I’m poppin’ fuckin cavities. Get up.”
much with him. This was supposed to be a one-day venture.
“Rich with the kind of vitamins and minerals
Dean gave the waiting car a distracted wave, busy monitoring four goats as he ushered them towards the open gate of the paddock. A long stretch of wire fencing blocked the entire road, almost reaching the barn, and it definitely hadn’t been there yesterday. Castiel watched Dean dart to the side to thwart one goat’s lazy wandering, but then all four of them were out in the grass and Dean was swinging the wide gate shut, securing several latches. He hustled to roll the extra fencing out of the road and then manhandled the thick coil behind a bungee that was anchored to the paddock fence.
“Why do I have to be the one to ask? You never do, so I'm sorry if I got the impression you were too busy for me.”
He was on the ninth bed and halfway through the second bag of manure when Dean came out to check on him again. Cas felt like some grimy goblin, crouched and sweating behind the garden beds, dragging around a bag of the worst smelling crap he’d ever had the displeasure to meet. This was probably just how Dean thought of him, anyway. A sack of shit with a sack of shit.
“About an hour.”
"Suit yourself." He said.
“Dean.” Dean corrected smoothly.
Clementine stood waiting, the low milking stool and two pails sitting nearby. Dean slapped her rump on the way past her, grabbing a red plastic bucket which he handed to Cas.
Cas cast his eye over the long stretch of raised beds. There had to be something like twenty of them, at least twelve feet long and four feet wide apiece. It was a lot of plants.
, sticking thick to the back of his throat and clinging to his nose hairs. He buried his nose against his shoulder, but that only served to make him aware of just how much he’d been sweating under the full brunt of the Kansas sun. He grit his teeth and started to pack the manure into little mounds around the bases of the plants. He tried not to think about how full and lush they already were, and how that probably made this a needless task. He had

He turned his head to the tv just in time to see Cas graze past a dusty, spur-clinking old Western film. He sat up abruptly, grabbing the remote. Cas was still holding it.
Dean dropped onto his couch and put his feet up, cracking open the beer. Man, if Cas he thought he was feelin' sore
“Here. Right of passage.”
There were two stock pots waiting on the stovetop. Dean shoved all of the pails aside on the counter.

“Doesn’t that hurt her?”
Cas sank under the surface of the water and let the cold turn him numb. Maybe he could try washing his clothes in the tub. If that didn’t work, maybe he’d burn them. Anything to try to get away from that stench.
“The uh… Willow Tree Motel.”
Sam poked an elbow against Eileen's ribs, nothing but glee on every square inch of his face.
There will be at least 14 chapters since there are at least 14 days to cover. The outline by itself is insane at a whopping 40k, y'all. I'm having fun.
“Elaborate.”
Feeling helpful, Dean pinched his shoulder, hard. Cas hissed and jerked away from it.
He patted the roof of the car and turned away in the direction of the barn. Castiel swallowed hard and rolled up the window. The scent of Dean’s aftershave still lingered.
“It's not Everest." Cas whispers.
“What
chickens grazing freely across the backyard were any indication.
“What do you mean?”
“Seriously, you got nothin’ to worry about, Ash. Farm still needs you. Just take the extra day and enjoy it.”
Dean kind of laughed, but when Cas just kept looking at him like he didn’t appreciate the prank, the smile dropped away.
“Does that help answer your question?”
From somewhere behind the fence, the black plastic rustled and then crunched in the distinct pattern of human footsteps.
somehow coming into contact, so he just bit the bullet and dumped the oats and barley into the trough, receiving a strong nudge to the arm before he could back clear, the bucket clutched to his chest. Dean gave an impressed whistle.
“Will she bite?”
“Yeah?”
“You good?”
“Yuh-huh.” Dean said, unconvinced. “And I’m not talking money. I’m talking blood, sweat, and tears.”
was a plastic-wrapped sandwich before he picked up on Dean cackling behind him.
Cas wanted to leave. He wanted to rewind time and miss the turn onto the farm yesterday, and just keep driving until he was somewhere far, far away, and then never look back.
“Good. Get up, wash up.” Dean said, gesturing up towards the house. “Cow time then chow time.”
Cas caught one of them, clumsily, but the other bounced off the knee-jerk leg that he’d raised again and it thumped into the dewy grass. He swiped it up, throwing a glare at Dean as he stacked both boxes on the dry back porch. Dean hopped down from the truck bed and bumped Jo’s shoulder.
Cas offered a hand out to Jo. “Nice to meet you.”
“Just reach under her.”
“Welcome to stop number whatever-this-is on the Winchester Farm Family Fun Tour.” Dean said, and hopped up to swing one leg over the pigpen fence. “My muddy gals.”
Sam slides carefully into the back seat and shuts the door as gently as he can.
Fuck.
“I got her all set up, ‘cept for this.” He said. He gestured to the trough attached low on the wall that Clementine stood facing. “Thought we’d start putting you in her good graces.”
“You don't get to use that tone with me. You didn’t call me back when you saw there was a missed call, did you?”
“…Why?”
his shirt started sticking to his back, and the way the hay dust began adhering to the thin sheen of sweat on his arms. The small pocket of air inside the dust mask was stiflingly hot and smelled like his own recirculated breath, layer upon layer of it. Beads of sweat tickled his skin, feeling like the crawling bodies of the countless spiders he kept seeing running up the walls and across the floor, and he’d almost torqued his neck in the jerking reflex of wiping that horrible sensation away.

Sam shuts the car door and Dean sits bolt upright. His gun, dropped in the footwell before he fell asleep, is in his grasp in a blink.
Castiel looked down. His toes were dangerously close to an obvious line of droppings right beneath the railings.
Castiel had no idea what he intended to do. At least two weeks gave him more time to think.
“I am.”
“This is a joke. You’re laughing at me.”
"They were quite good."
“Sweet kid. He’s out here at least twice a week. You’ll meet him.” Dean eyed Cas sideways, his gaze lingering long enough on his hair that Cas ruffled at it self-consciously. A shower of hay dust and some strands of hay fell into the grass.

Cas risked opening his eyes to look up at him. Dean smiled, a small, lazy thing that crinkled the corners of his half-open eyes more than it showed on his lips.
for the past ten years? Thank fuck I had you come along and set me straight.”
“What do I…?” Cas said, holding up the bundle.
The murmur of constant din coming from across the street suddenly gathered into a loud, collective chant of raised voices.
Cas raised his stony expression to the middle distance. Clenching his jaw, he bent over the task of dry-brushing the eggs clean. The screen door squeaked open and several empty cardboard egg cartons landed on the bench seat next to him.
“Don’t ask.” Cas said, and had to use the side of the raised bed to push himself back to his feet. He stumbled, squeezing his eyes shut against the sudden violent rush of light-headedness, his vision going white and his ears ringing. His legs were numb and he didn’t know when they’d gone to sleep.
Cas watched him — the subtle movements of his back and shoulders, the way his leg stretched forward under Clementine’s body, the soft press of his hair against her side — and felt a stab of jealousy again. He’d never worked anywhere that brought him such contentment as to inspire humming like Dean was, quiet and a little disjointed, like he wasn’t conscious that he was doing it out loud. Or like he just didn’t
One, it was goddamn cold. He was quite warm where he was and didn't much care for the thought of that heat leaching away on the walk from the motel to the raucous bar across the street.
, and the verdant life outside the farmhouse windows? Why did it suddenly feel like, horribly, he wasn’t
She gave him a very grandmotherly sort of smile, the kind that typically arrived behind a plate of fresh oatmeal raisin cookies.
"It looks old."
Like that morning there were five pails of milk to take up to the house, the goat milk set aside and waiting for them at the back of the barn. Dean must’ve milked them before he’d come to get Cas. He’d probably seen that he wasn’t done with the duck shit yet.
But the man that emerged from the gateway, slapping a pair of gardening gloves from his hands to tuck under his arm in echo to the folder under Castiel’s, was
"Hm. Not tired my ass."
. Not interested. Not for sale.”
Cas turned baleful eyes on the morning sun as he followed Dean out of the barn. It still was too low in the sky to be much past 10AM, if that. Should he have taken more time to muck out the stalls? It was torture, but at least it was a
that was so loud between them. He thought about rolled sleeves and freckled arms, knee-clutching laughter, and a calloused thumb absently wiping a streak of sunscreen from the back of Castiel’s neck, where he couldn’t see.
Cas hasn't realized he's smiling, yet. It's a tiny, soft thing, the one he gets when he's looking at something precious.
The person who jumped out of the truck cab and came around to punch Dean in the arm — despite the fact that he was carrying a heavy box full of bruisable produce — was not a man like Castiel had expected when he heard there was a “Joe” on the way. Instead, it was a young blonde woman, almost a full head shorter than Dean. She dropped the tailgate and helped Dean shove the box along the cargo bed, glancing back at Castiel with naked curiosity.
“Done?” He said, and Cas saw his arm swing back to toss something his direction. He barely reacted when the bottle of water hit him in the chest and dropped to the floor.
that Dean had cultivated around himself, that he nurtured and watched over. It was about more than a landowner’s attachment to a plot of land. It was about a soul bound to the earth.
“Every single one.”
Cas wouldn’t meet his eyes. His lips pinched in something like embarrassment.
"Hey hey hey! Boots on the furniture!" Cas yelled, trying to knock Dean’s legs down as he pulled them up onto the sofa. Dean turned his back and used it to shove against Cas instead.
“Excuse me?”
“Cas, talk to me, did something happen?”
Dean slipped the bottle from his grip and cracked the seal, handing it back to him opened.
“You need a minute?”
Dubious, Castiel stepped closer. The five-by-three grid of nesting boxes was raised off of the ground like a cube bookshelf on stilts. Each cubby had a lip that kept the straw lining from spilling out, which the surly forms of the birds hunkered down behind as he got closer. Each row had a railing that jutted from the boxes like a long drawer pull.
There was a loud slapping thump from somewhere behind him and Castiel spun to face it, almost dropping his folder. The chicken gave an irritated cluck and scuttled away, but he didn’t think it mattered anymore, if the half a dozen
The window above the bench opened.
"Why not?"
Cas pocketed the first egg and reached under the next chicken, wary of the way she was watching him. Sure enough, she snapped out and he hissed, yanking his arm back. An angry red pinch throbbed on his arm.
. Dean, I -- "
There wasn’t even a welcome mat anymore. That had been Dean’s, too.
“You gotta passcode lock your phone, man, you can’t keep butt dialing me.” Dean muttered, dropping into the driver’s seat. The gentle patter of the rain gave way to the close silence of the car and Dean froze, the phone still pressed to his ear.
Dean set a glass in front of him that had something green and leafy floating in amongst the ice.
The slump of Dean’s body across the seat means that his head is the only thing supported, and it has his neck at a bad angle. If Dean's an angry sleeper, he's even worse with a crick in his neck and Cas doesn't love the idea of being stuck in a car with
But… could he use that?
try to make a break for it before he could close it? He wasn’t going to be able to herd a cow back
Fun author’s update: I’ve just lost my job. 🙃 Guess that means I have more time to write. If you’d like to buy me a coffee while I process this breakup,
It was the nicest henhouse he'd ever seen. He supposed perhaps it was due to the fact that he hadn’t seen many.
something about it? Yeah, goddamn it, he couldn’t just let this thing mosey off and get hit by a car or torn apart by a dog. The idea was
“Ah, there he is, dressed for a day’s work on the farm.”
Turned out, the colored eggs had been enough of a shock to throw him on their own. Dean shook his head to himself, a tiny smile tugging at his mouth. It was interesting to have this new set of eyes on the farm, experiencing everything for the first time. He was like this wide-eyed baby, those big blues full of reluctant wonder at things that Dean took for granted, like green eggshells and fresh milk and cold pasta salad. The kind of dull-ass life this guy must lead.
been a siren or some other kind of supernatural…
The chemical whiff of the charges tickled Dean's nose. The streamers caught in the front of Cas' shirt, gently tumbling into his lap.
"You know your brother, Sam.” Cas says, unable to stop himself from stroking light fingers through Dean’s hair again. “And I’m happy. I refuse to risk losing him in pursuit of something I don’t
Cas pets Dean's hair, feeling that dangerous constriction again, something so huge and profound it might very well burst him. Dean sleeps on.
Cas unrolled the soft tube. A pair of worn leather gloves fell out of what appeared to be a flannel shirt… but there was something terribly wrong about it. He held it up and turned it, trying to figure out how he was supposed to wear it. The sleeves were just long, thin strips and the body was too short, and even
“Dean, there’s not enough
, and he definitely hadn’t expected to immediately feel sort of guilty about it. Because Castiel hadn’t shut down like the kind of soulless, spineless dick that worked for companies with ‘Development’ in their name, like some fuckin’… android type with perfectly tousled black hair and crisp blue eyes. He hadn’t gone blank. He’d gone
“Cas, god damn it.” Dean rubbed at his forehead. “Fine, yeah, you're right. For the record, I thought you were too busy, too.”
"Stealing, angel?"
“It’s literally ten feet away.”
He watched the Prius drive off in a cloud of gravel dust that slowly drifted towards the barn and dissipated in the next-to-nothing breeze, shoving his hands into the pockets of his jeans.
“He has made it clear that he is not interested in pecuniary terms.”
“Cow time?”
Castiel knocked on the screen door again. “
“What am I
“Dean.” He croaks.
Well, what was one more assault to his olfactory senses?
“Of course I don’t
The man wiped his hand on his jeans before he clapped it into Castiel’s palm, his grip warm and rough and finally some familiar ground: tight enough to serve as a warning.
Cas bent his head graciously and continued. “But it’s not. To me. I like living here. I like finding things and getting to keep them. It’s quiet. It’s nice to see people in the morning when I’m walking. Deborah baked me a pie.” It’s absurd for Dean to feel jealous. Dean shouldn’t be jealous of Deborah, who probably didn’t even use lard in the pie crust and had probably never seen Cas on less than one cup of coffee in the morning.
But mostly, Dean just closes his eyes and imagines Cas waits at the threshold of the Bunker door for him. Sometimes minutes, sometimes hours. Cas stands there and waits and then, in Dean’s best fantasies, he starts speaking to Cas. Even while there’s a him standing there watching Cas leave, in his head, there’s another Dean who is telling Cas everything that bubbles up in his throat, everything that thumps against his teeth, everything that circles his jaw.
He was falling back onto the ground, dragging an unconscious Cas shaped thing out of the crack before Rowena snapped it all away. Dean’s shoulder stung. He shrugged Rowena’s hands off and put his hands under Cas’ armpits.
Besides, Dean was forty now. Fuck. Forty-two. Still living far past what he thought he’d live to, and sometimes it felt like he carried each and every one of those years around with him.
They were going to try it tomorrow. Sam and Rowena talked it over -- while Dean was sleeping -- and decided that was the best course of action.
All totaled, it took almost seven and half hours and most of the not inconsiderable resources and magic stores already in the Bunker to open the Empty; but after seven and half hours, the sky cracked purple in front of them.
The tips of Sam’s ears went red, which made something heat up nice and warm in Dean’s chest. It hadn’t been easy like this between them -- Dean didn’t wanna think how long. Didn’t want to think about why two extra people filling out the spaces they couldn’t reach made it easy again. Just wanted to take a minute and bask in it.
Sam flipped him off and Dean whooped loudly, while Eileen rolled her eyes. His voice bounced around the walls of the Bunker for half a second after Sam left, then faded into the emptiness. Dean frowned, pulled out his phone, and ordered pizza.
Dean felt like he’d answered wrong somehow. On the screen, the beefy dude explained all about his soul and his guilt and his quest roaming the earth for some sort of redemption. And then the girl just stuck her throat out at him like there was a neon sign saying DRAIN ME VAMP BOY stuck to her clavicle, which made even Dean’s eyebrow jump up.
Cas doesn’t say anything.
Dean slept under the stars after Sam suggested Dean make or buy Cas some sort of housewarming gift. Dean’s joints felt frozen over and rusted in the morning. Taking a shower, Dean was surprised the pounding droplets of water didn’t leave any bruises.
“Can’t blame a girl for trying,” she replied and then exchanged sickeningly sappy glances with Sam. Dean looked back down at the plate of pancakes. They were still warm, which meant everyone must’ve just finished eating. Slowly, he became aware of how much heat Cas’ newly human body, inches away from his, seemed to radiate. Cas always ran warm, though. Even when he was an angel. But then it wasn’t warm so much as bright. Like something powerful and hard and glaring and painful to look directly at. Which was kind of how Dean still felt when Cas looked right through him, even when Cas didn’t have the cosmic power up.
“Dean?” Cas’ voice came from behind him. Dean, unthinking, turned towards Cas’ voice, bringing his forehead against Cas’.
Dean rubbed his eyes with the back of his hand and yawned. Then, he swung his feet over the side of the couch and pushed himself into a standing position. Oh that did not feel good on his back, shoulders or neck.
“Thank you, Sam,” Cas said dryly. Sam had the grace to look a little embarrassed.
“Cas saved me,” Dean said.
Dean had to masturbate. Obviously. And he had to do it before Cas woke up.
“I sent a photo,” he said. “Jody said both of ‘em were still in.”
Sam snorted. “You’re confusing real life with Doctor Sexy again.”
“Not sure what I did to trick her into it --”
The sun stayed harsh and the land stayed solid but Dean stopped staying still.
“Dean.” Cas didn’t sound amused. He also didn’t move out of the doorway, leaving Dean nervously exposed on his step.
Dean hadn’t tried since. He hadn’t even thought about it until --
“Well, clearly, the mature adult conversation didn’t work,” Claire said, “considering Alex goes through boyfriends like tissues.”
Twenty minutes of browsing later and Dean was slamming his computer closed. What the fuck was wrong with people? Some dude clearly trying to shill some sort of religion? Another dude out there talking about his loss of hope or faith in humanity? Jesus, you’d think impotence was a worse punishment than hell from the way some people talked about. Dean didn’t -- Dean didn’t want to be junkless or shit, but it wasn’t like his equipment had been seeing a lot of use these days. Probably for the better. Not like Dean ever brought anyone any sort of happy ending. Maybe this was just fucked up cosmic justice.
Sam pounded his fists on Dean’s door. “Cas is awake,” he said. “I don’t know what’s up with you two these days but he died for you and he’s your best friend.”
Rowena sunk the small rock shard at the bottom of their Quartz, Rocks and Shit Like That box into Dean’s shoulder. Dean stood as still as he could, letting her etch back into his shoulder the shadow of the handprint that pulled Dean from Hell.
“Big time,” Dean confirmed.
Dean closed his eyes and felt something sharp and cold flood through his entire body. He didn’t move. “And?” he shoved out.
Dean felt something uncomfortable lurking under those words. “He’s doing a lot of good now, though. Helping her, fighting the forces of evil.”
Dean poured himself a cup of coffee, took a sip and frowned down at it, startled by the taste. “This isn’t the usual burnt swill Cas likes.” He pointed accusingly at Cas.
“And what makes me so different from you?” Cas asked. He actually did sound lost, and maybe angry. Dean couldn’t tell. “What’s stopping you? You’re a good man, Dean.”
“Oh,” Dean said, and cleared his throat.
Dean likes to go to the kitchen when he can’t sleep. He thinks the floor is hard and the fridge is cool and if he sits there long enough he can almost feel like everything is stopped.
“Eileen,” Sam said, plaintively.
Sam crossed his arms and stepped forward. Dean held his ground. “Like you think you gotta be dad or God or whatever. Big man with a plan. To every fucking person in the universe, like we don’t have some pretty concrete evidence that playing God is a stupid fucking idea.”
“Sam,” Rowena said, “don’t you think a big tall thing like you ought to take the legs?”
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean interrupts. “Angel business.”
Cas stared at Dean, eyes wide, before he also started to laugh.
“I don’t --” Dean protested.
“Yeah, maybe a little too much.”
“Did you want something, Dean?” Cas asked.
Sam gave his regretfully chosen outfit a last, sad look and trotted after Dean. “We’re going to have to talk to Rowena,” he said. “We’re going to have to owe her one.”
Dean scoffed. “It’s Cas’ life, man. I’m fucking ready. It’s about time we pulled him out of the fire instead of tossing him in.”
Dean grinned widely. “Let me guess,” he said, “you’re the chef.”
“Suck and fuck?”
Dean swallowed thickly. “Well, you did,” he said, which was mean and petulant and selfish and that Dean couldn’t have held back if he’d tried.
Dean scoffs. “Course I’m okay,” he says. He doesn’t expect Cas to believe him. “I just had a nice suck and fuck in the back alley of that burger joint downtown. Why wouldn’t I be okay?”
Dean looked Sam in the eyes at that. He hadn’t heard that one in a while. “Bitch,” he said.
Cas frowned. “She is mad at him. He’s a vampire. He’s spent centuries doing horrible things. Feeding off humanity.”
Dean let himself bask in this moment too: Cas, with a smile and Dean, the one who put it there. Sam interrupted with a scoff. “Yeah,” he said. “And we’re the nauseating ones.”
“Cas, buddy,” he said, something taking lift under his ribs, “me neither.”
“Boys,” she said. “Shall we?”
“Dean,” Sam said, stopping him. “I don’t know what you’re thinking right now, and I’m not even asking you to talk about it, but you gotta stop trying to be whatever it is you’re doing. It’s not working. And it’s not you.”
Dean chuckled. “What we have here is a failure to communicate,” he quoted.
It didn’t change anything. Dean blinked it away.
“No,” Dean said.
Jody grinned up at them both. “You boys don’t spend much time in the great outdoors, do you?”
Whatever. This was fine. Not great, but. It was stress, Dean told himself. Cas would wake up and they’d talk and it would be like a Fountain of Youth in his pants.
“He’s in the Bunker, Dean.”
“Nope,” Eileen signed and spoke, just as happily. “I’ve kept myself alive for the past thirty-three years, but that’s about it.”
“He’s safer this way,” Jack disagreed.
“Jesus Christ, Cas.”
He cleared his throat. He tried to say, “this isn’t what it looked like.” The words stuck in his mouth. Dean, much too late, shoved his legs under the covers of his bed.
“You have to know, Dean,” Cas said, voice rusty with something Dean didn’t think he wanted to recognize, “I meant it. What I said before I died.” Cas looked down for an awkward beat of time. “I’m sorry you had to hear it.” Then he paused, and looked back up at Dean. He had a look in his eyes that Dean hasn’t seen in years. He thought it was anger, or confidence. He remembered seeing it when they met, when Cas told him angels were warriors. “But I am glad to have said it. I love you, Dean. This cannot be taken from me.”
“I want you to know,” Cas said, carefully, in the middle of the next episode, “that I did not think about it in this way.”
“I wanted to tell you something. That’s why I’m here, I guess. I mean, I know how heaven and all that works but ... “ Dean paused. “I’m really sorry, Mom. I don’t want you to be mad at me. I’m sorry.”
“Oh, don’t think you're exempt, Sam,” Jody said, sloshing some beer onto the ground when she gestured at him.
“I have done my best to ignore it,” he tried to reassure Dean.
Sam appealed to Cas. “Come on, man. Tell him he’s being ridiculous.”
“It’s nice,” Dean couldn’t stop himself from protesting.
Sam brought his hands down. “Right,” he said. “Not like I grew up with you or anything.”
It took a while to find Mary’s grave.
Nothing had happened, though. His dick had sort of just sat there. Floppy. Undercooked meat. Dean had shrugged, mentally, and put it out of his mind. Drugs could be a hell of a mood killer.
“For real, Dean. You’re not going to like it. We’re going to have to let her look through the Bunker’s artifacts.”
“From Ireland,” Eileen signed while she spoke.
Cas, Dean realized, was laughing at him. Inside. On the outside, Cas was giving the side of the couch a small smile. Dean realized he was grinning a bit too.
“It’s not,” Dean said. “It’s true.”
“Yeah,” Dean gestured. “Who says it’s such a bad thing to be impotent? Boners cause a lot of problems. Some people’d be better off without him. You know. Who says impotence even needs to be a problem.”
“Yeah,” Dean told him. “You are. You just said you weren’t -- feeling emotions and shit. That ain’t living. You’re giving up a lot of stuff you want, your life, just ‘cause you gotta stop anything bad from ever happening.”
“She’s a teenager!” Dean squawked. “I think,” he added, in a deeper voice.
“That’s not what I’m doing.”
“Nah,” he said. “I doubt I got that much gas left in the tank.” The accompanying grin came easy. He knew how that grin looked. How it made him look.
“I am unfamiliar with this type of woman.” Cas’ voice is stiff.
Dean grunted. “You’re going to want to steer clear of shit built before the seventies. Soil ain’t right for it here.”
“Morning, Dean,” Cas said in a voice that Dean could swear hadn’t been that deep a minute ago. Dean cleared his throat.
“I have found it hard to sleep in here,” Cas admitted. “It’s hard to tell the night from the day. It makes sleep difficult.”
Dean entered the cemetery.
Cas blinked. “Don’t,” he told Dean, “tell me what I have sacrificed for you was not worth it. Don’t tell me my sacrifices were not worth it to me.”
Cas nodded. Something in his face softened. “He came by. We talked. It was -- very moving. He’s thinking about stepping down as God. Letting all that power go back to the Universe.” He frowned. “And Amara, I suppose.”
Kenny was smart, though, like Sam, and sometimes he’d slow and stand outside the motel with Dean to talk him through the classes Dean got tired or slipped off in. Whenever Miss Marbel saw them around the parking lot she’d come up on over and shoe Kenny off. Motel wasn’t a place for loitering so come on in or get yourself gone, she’d say and Kenny would get himself gone without a moment's hesitation. Dean felt strange then. Like he wasn’t sure if he was disappointed or not.
“Me neither,” he agreed.
Dean and Cas didn’t stop having movie nights. Every time Eileen took Sam out, Dean went right to the Dean Cave and put on the television at the lowest volume he could stand and strained his ears for Cas moving in between rooms. He’d call out as soon as he heard Cas, beckon him over. Dean’d had a few bad calls and false starts at a creaking old underground bunker, voice flying mortifyingly back into his face, but Cas always eventually poked his head out. And he always came to join Dean.
“I am glad you talked to him, Dean,” Cas said.
Sam’d been pissed off on behalf of the woman and grossed out on behalf of himself, all of which meant he left well enough alone.
“Don’t be such a girl,” Dean told him. “I bet Eileen takes less time to get ready than you do.”
Dean was surprised it took Sam a full week and a half to bring Cas back up again. “You know,” Sam said, conversationally, cornering a surprised Dean over breakfast, “Cas told me what happened.”
Dean grinned lewdly and told Sammy that back alley blowies didn’t take long, not that he’d expect a virgin like him to know that.
“I want you going down the right path. This motel’s got standards. Morality and shit. But like I said, I know you’re a good kid. You got some bad friends, but I know you’re not a bad kid. Right, Dean?”
“Bullshit. That’s such bullshit. God, Dean, you don’t even believe that. I know you don’t believe that.”
“No,” Dean blurted out. “I mean, are you?”
“Does this mean you’re going to fix things with Cas?” Sam asked.
“What a man does with his junk is his own personal private business, Sammy.”
“You boys live here?” She asked. “Been camping out a bit too long for a vacation.”
Cas wasn’t moving. “Yes?”
Dean raised an eyebrow at that. “That’s a little fucking creepy, dude.” He felt weirdly warm and lit up inside, though. Still. Doesn’t detract from Dean’s point. That there’s no point.
“Castiel has been praying to me.” Jack looked away from Dean. “I remember feeling -- love. For him.”
The discomfort from earlier came back. “He’s trying now,” Dean said. “He’s still a monster though. A vampire.”
On the eighteenth day after Cas had left, Dean looked up his address on Google Maps. Some shack only four hours and change away. Wasn’t too bad. Couple of stores Dean wanted to hit on the way, which was good. The Doc had been recommending Dean try a few things out when he had the time.
“Thank you Miss Marbel,” Dean said on autopilot. He stuffed the magazines down his shirt and spent the next thirty minutes keeping his mind carefully, precariously blank.
“I can leave.”
Dean scrambled around for something to say. “Shut up,” he said. “That’s a guilty pleasure. And it’s Doctor Sexy, MD not Doctor Sexy.”
Cas narrowed both his eyebrows at Dean. “I see,” Cas said. “But you’ve watched Doctor Sexy? Multiple times?”
Cas didn’t stop. Something was lighting him up inside and whatever it was, it was ugly. It was rolling over him, and Dean could only sit back and think about how much worse this all was now that Cas kinda sorta thought there was some sort of a chance when there wasn’t any chance, wasn’t anything, wasn’t anyone. “-- important than people realize to sexual activity. Penetration is an arbitrary --
“Not sure even you can do that, bud.”
Wordlessly, Cas held up the remote. “Do you want to change the channel?” he asked. “There is a nature documentary I’d been meaning to watch.”
“You trusted Benny with your life.”
“I know,” Sam said. “I stopped worrying about that part so much when I realized that Cas would never let you die.”
“I think,” Cas was saying, when Dean pulled himself back, “I would like to try to pray to him.”
“The coffee?” Dean blinked blearily at her.
Dean gave Claire a little open handed shrug. “It’s not the worst thing to work around.” Claire gave him a puzzled sort of look in response and raised an eyebrow.
“It’s kind of short notice, Dean. People have work, lives --”
“Buffy.” Cas frowned. “Is that the one with the vampires? Claire likes it. She told me not to tell anyone, though.”
“So?” He opened his hands expansively. “Me and my brother are fine.”
Cas turned away, hand flexing. He was trying to stay calm, stay here, for Dean, but Cas was angry. Dean’s stomach sank. He stood, empty handed, in front of Cas and considered just letting it go. Cas would let it go. Dean wouldn’t -- he’d never have to say anything. Sam wouldn’t push. Hell, Dean wasn’t even sure Sam would know to push. Not like he’d been out of the prowl or getting himself laid in, God, years. It was -- everything could just continue as it was.
Cas ignored that. “A nocturnal erection indicates that your impotence is psychological, not medical.” He sounded -- excited? Hopeful? Cas’ speed picked up. “The male penis is far less --”
“Great,” Dean grunted. “Thank you for that. I feel all cozy inside right about now. Real great talk Sam. Let’s do this again never.”
Dean tutted at his brother. “Talk like this is what’s going to get you at the bottom of the food chain.”
Reverently, he brought the hand that had just been on Dean’s dick up to his face. Dean grabbed Cas' wrist and pulled it down. Whatever was happening on Cas’ face stopped, stilled. “You want to have sex with me?” Cas asked.
“Because she doesn’t have to help us. I mean, this is out of the kindness of her --”
It wasn’t like that, now, though. Sam was -- happy. Dean thought. It eased something in his chest and tightened something else a little lower, watching Sam.
“Thanks for the ringing endorsement,” Dean snorted.
Dean thought and then bit his cheek. He grabbed the remote and clicked on the television. It only took Dean a second to realize it was MASH reruns.
“It was a good pie,” Cas told him. “The secret,” he leaned in, “is using lard instead of butter in the crust.”
Doctor Sexy, no longer poisoned, celebrated the return of the full use of his dick with a threesome. The final shot of the episode was over the coma guy waking up. He’s Doctor Sexy’s secret son, but they won’t reveal that until season ten.
“Sam,” Dean warned. “We’re not talking about this.”
“Dude.” Dean said, sternly. “How are you?”
“It is perhaps,” Cas chose his words carefully, “Not how I would have chosen to confess. I remember being human. It was -- overwhelming. There was so much I didn’t understand. But so much else I did understand. It was … strange. I was aware, in a way I hadn’t been before. But it didn’t make me understand. It just made me more aware of my lack of comprehension.” Cas paused. “Humans are remarkable but they are also fallible. The capacity for pettiness. Hunger. Cold, and to come in from the cold. It was a very isolating thing to be human, but I never felt more connected to --”
“S no trick,” Dean told him gruffy, the way he could remember imagining Bobby would’ve said to him. “It’s just you, dude. I’m,” happy for you. But the words wouldn’t leave Dean’s mouth. “She’s good for you,” Dean said instead.
Cas opened the door. His face was creased. Dean watched, in slow motion, as Cas recognized him, smile dropping off his face, hands falling to his side.
Cas’ eyes widened and drooped. His jaw tightened. Dean felt that. The thought of getting up, walking to his room, just to sleep alone, filled Dean with a kind of full body dread.
Dean scowled, neck flaming. “That was a gesture,” Dean said. “You know, a symbol and shit. That I’m working on my issues, or whatever.”
Cas looked surprised. “I wanted to stay,” Cas told him.
“The game?” Cas asked.
“Yeah, well.”
“It’s not -- I’m impotent, Cas,” Dean said.
There were some exceptions to these one and done affairs, of course. During rare moments of privacy, Dean liked to savor them. Pull out all the stops, really make it nice. Problem was, he didn’t get privacy near often enough. Helped keep me on the straight and narrow, though, the lack of privacy. Dean could get pretty -- unconventional, left all by his lonesome too long.
That made Cas smile. “I love you,” Cas said.
“No, what, I don’t,” he sputtered. “That wasn’t, Dick was a big, he was --”
“I don’t want to upset him. That’s why I don’t go. I’m not -- myself.”
“Don’t be fucking sorry,” Dean snapped. “God, I thought -- in Purgatory you told me you understood, that-that I never asked you to stay. I tried, Cas, but you didn’t fucking listen. I told you not to do this. I didn’t want this, Cas. I didn’t want --”
Sam sighed. “You’re not going to let us live that one down, are you?”
Jack closed his eyes for a minute and everything was very still and nothing moved and then Jack opened his eyes again. “Yes,” he said. He looked upset. “But then things might get bad. I wouldn’t be able to protect you and Sam and Cas. I think it would make -- people would be angry.”
“It’s not,” Dean insisted, then rubbed his neck. “Man,” he said. “I don’t know why you’re talking to me instead of Cas. I really don’t.”
Cautiously, Cas held up a plate. “Sam told me I could help myself.”
Dean looked at Cas. Cas actually loved him and Dean was about to -- Christ. Dean was the worst kind of friend. “Yeah, no,” he said. “You’re right. Dumb idea. You wanna move to the Dean Cave?”
Dean cleared his throat. “You moving in with Eileen?”
Cas took a breath. “Should we --” he started tentatively. “Talk about it?”
“Sammy,” Dean started, with no intention of finishing.
“Yeah, asshole,” Dean said, warm and pleased. “Okay. I get it. You love me, I love you, we’re one great big family.”
“Impotence is a common affliction,” Cas interrupted.
Cas looked down. Dean looked away.
“It doesn’t bother you?”
“Dean,” Sam said, “God, we have guests. Chew your food before you talk.”
“I --” Dean, for a second, was worried, he wouldn’t be able to speak. He tightened his grip on Cas’ wrist. “Course.”
“What the fuck --” Dean panicked, shoving the magazines off him. “Lady, I can’t have these.”
He’d probably stick around while Cas was recovering. That was good. There was a blank spot in Dean’s head when he tried to think about after Cas had recovered. Dean pushed the blank emptiness back into the far reaches of his mind and plugged in the coffee maker.
Cas thought about it for a second. “Yes,” he said. “You are.” He sounded proud.
“Alright, alright --” Dean tried to interrupt, but Cas beat him to it.
“I can keep going,” Cas said.
“Thirty-seven and you still need a little wingman action?” Dean forced. Thankfully, Sam ignored him.
Cas stepped forward then, and pressed Dean into the wall, mouth clashing awkwardly around Dean’s cheeks. It was barely even a kiss. It was funny. Dean didn’t laugh. Dean just put his hands directly on the side of Cas’ face. He could feel Cas’ throat with his thumb, swallowing compulsively. Dean brought their mouths together. Slowly. It wasn't a good kiss. It was terrible, and it was also the best fucking kiss Dean had ever had in his goddamn life.
Sure enough, the two figures on the screen stopped fighting and started talking.
Dean doesn’t know where Cas goes. Heaven, he supposes. Cas doesn’t talk about it, though Dean’s asked a few times. Once. Dean's asked about it once. Cas had looked at him like it was obvious.
“Only if you want,” Dean added hastily. “I mean, Sam likes to keep his hair all nice and shiny long like a little girl and if you want to keep yours like that --”
“She is quite vicious,” Cas said.
“Cause I’m a dumbass,” she told him. “Your daddy ain’t around much.”
“No,” Dean shook his head and it was a mistake, he shouldn’t have said anything at all. “It’s my dick --”
Miss Marbel snorted loudly. “And I’m a bright and bushy twenty-one,” she said.
“Hey, Samantha,” Dean interrupted him. “Which one do you think is better?”
When he got back home, he made sure to crow to Sammy, who made some sort of snarky comment about Dean scaring this one off in record time.
Dean had gone to his bedroom. He’d gone to bedroom and sat on the edge of the bed and held himself rigid. But even after a few hours, he was still feeling ill. Hot, and ill, and sweaty. So, Dean gets up. His body only shivers a little and the icy chill of the Bunker floor calms him. This is when Dean goes to the kitchen. This is why Dean goes to the kitchen. It’s cold and it’s empty and it’s usually dark enough that if Dean is still enough, it’s like he’s not there at all.
“There is nothing wrong with changing things up.”
“Oh.”
Sam didn’t give him the time. “Then, I thought he was just that angel, that terrifying angel that hung around my brother. He betrayed us, then died, then became my friend. I still thought he’d get you killed, but I also worried maybe you’d get him killed now. I thought you were both so stupid. You -- you -- you’d be dressing him up and making him recite Clint Eastwood monologues one week, and then getting beaten within an inch of your life the next, Dean!”
Dean shrugged and put on the pink plaid one. Sam rolled his eyes. “The gay community thanks you,” he deadpanned.
Unexpectedly, Jack grinned. “Cas is good at getting out of death,” he said.
“Too hot?” Dean guessed.
Sam raised an eyebrow but otherwise didn’t respond.
Dinner went fine. Well, passably. What counts for good in the Winchester extended family unit anyway. Claire had stood in the doorway, staring, and then pushed Cas off when he tried to hug her, which had been awkward, but Jody had brought out the wine and soon enough they were off to the races.
“Woah!” he couldn’t stop himself from saying as the small blond girl took the big beefy one’s shirt off. “That is not -- that’s not okay!”
Dean slumped forward, letting his forehead slide past Cas, away from the searching fondness and confusion in his blue eyes, shaking silently, until Cas, hesitantly, lifted a large hand and clasped it down on the back of Dean’s neck. They stood like that, still and unmoving, until Dean pulled away.
He turned off his light and laid awake through another sleepless night.
“The recipe,” Cas said and Dean felt dumb.
Dean started crying. Fuck. His face crumpled around itself, hideous, and he started to shake.
John didn’t call it advice and he didn’t call it a lesson but it was a warning for Dean. He had to start working on how to see the world the right way. The next time they were stopped over, Sam sprouting up a size while Dad was gone, Dean had gone straight to the back, taking a night off of eating dinner to afford something with less flash.
“I think I should go,” Cas said, finally, after a long pause.
“I don’t,” Dean snapped. “How the hell do they make me act?”
“You can’t -- you can’t think like that, man. You can’t just fuck off and take on whatever just to stop bad things from happening.” Dean’s ribs felt like they were constricting around his heart. “It doesn’t work. You can’t stop them, Jack, and you’re just gonna hurt people trying to protect ‘em.”
going to find Cas. They’d gotten people back from the Empty before. Hell, they’d gotten Cas back from the Empty before. Sam didn’t know what he was fucking talking about and Dean’s dating habits were his own private business anyway. If he wasn’t seeing anyone, that was just because Dean was grieving his best friend. A dude’s best friend dying right in front of them was a boner killer if ever a boner killer existed.
Dean gritted his teeth. “I’m pretty sure you don’t,” he said.
“No?” Cas asked, and he was smiling softly but there was still something hesitant in how he held himself.
“I don’t know,” Jack said, eyes starting to glow. “I don’t know what Castiel wants.”
Dean used to tease Sam about that, ask him why he couldn’t draw real things and always had to do that smart crap. Sam hadn’t stopped but he’d given Dean one for his birthday that started out dark and then as the shape got smaller and smaller, Dean could make out the impala, driving away. He’d cuffed the kid on his head and tucked it away somewhere close, with all the other shit Dean didn’t want to get stolen during the day or passed over during the classic mid-morning post-hunt flight from the unpaid motel tab.
Cas brought his hand up through his own hair which made Dean clench his fist into the back of the couch. He frowned at Dean. “You want to cut my hair?”
“Yes.” Cas told him. “Sam made it. It was kind of him to share.” He paused, as if searching for words. “I appreciate the gesture, but it is not good.”
And Cas leaves.
Dean wished he had a camera for Cas’ expression: eyes guileless open, mouth slack with surprise, Dean’s shirt falling loosely from Cas’ hand. “The Bunker --”
Unexpectedly, Sam said, “It's been three months. You want to talk about it?”
Cas smiled. “No,” he said. “Me neither.”
Cas looked back at the two characters on the screen. “They’re in love?”
“You’re not the only one who cared about Cas,” Sam told him.
Miss Marbel slapped his back when she laughed. It was hard enough to hurt but Dean didn’t move. “Good one,” she said, and something small inside Dean’s chest was warming.
“I think I’m going inside,” Cas said, suddenly. “Sam was right. It’s cold.”
“Oh, yeah?” Sam asked. “Then what are you doing? ‘Cause I’d love to know.”
The noise coming from the Bunker, after three and half months of Sam skulking around him and later, Cas recovering, was discombobulating.
“Nah,” Dean said and shivered.
“Nothing a few minutes away from this bullshit won’t fix,” Dean told her, gesturing expansively at the magazine.
She smacked her hand against it once when she finished, and gripped tight. Dean fell to his knees as a pulse of some blue fire magic rushed through his arms.
“I forgave him,” Dean told her. “I forgave Jack for killing you. God wanted -- God wanted me to kill him but I just saw -- I couldn’t see anything but Jack. He was a good kid. He wasn’t.” Dean stopped. “I know he wanted more from me. Stuff I didn’t give him. I couldn’t. I tried with Sam. I tried to give Sam some of that stuff, but I did it all wrong. I know that. I don’t have that stuff to give.”
Dean’s had his milkshake pajamas on, but felt weirdly -- cold. He stood, dumbly, in the Dean Cave for a minute before retreating back to his room to grab a grey hoodie and shove it on. Dean gave himself a sniff and a once over in the mirror, then shrugged and went to join everyone in the kitchen.
“Dean,” his hand tightened on Dean’s shoulder, but Dean wrenched himself away.
The kitchen is completely dark except for the two red lights on the microwave. Dean closes his eyes anyway. “You wanna get your dick wet,” he says. “Shows she’s taking charge, shows she’s choosing when and what. You don’t gotta think at all. Just feeling that hard, gravelly alley at your back. It’s colder than you’d think. Wetter, too, but don’t flinch at that. You just keep it straight up and stay still enough, and then you’re fucking. And it’s slow at first, but she’s already warmed you up and she’s all ready to go.” His eyes fly open. “You let her set the pace, though, Cas,” he impresses on Cas. This bit is important, he isn’t saying. “She got you all ready, but you want to make sure she’s ready too, alright?”
“For now,” Dean replied, squinting up at her against the sun. She was smoking, but she put the cigarette down to talk to Dean.
He started trying to deal with his penis problems. Even called a medical helpline, and, after a couple of heated exchanges with the operator on duty for the Lebanon free public health clinic, dumped out his liquor. Apparently a non-negotiable first step in getting semi-functionality back in his boneless boner. He wasn’t bailing on the red meat, though. He’d take a limp-er than normal dick over Sam’s rabbit food diet any day.
“Dean!” Sam snapped, forcing Dean to tune in to whatever his brother had been trying to say.
Cas had the grace to look embarrassed. “I’m sorry,” he told Dean. “I do not sleep easily and there have been … occasions where your penis has tumesced --”
“Come on, Sam,” Dean told him. “It’s important stuff. Stuff you gotta know before you go get your dick wet the first time. I’m not too worried, though. Eileen seems like she’s got you in good hands.”
“So you’re ready to pull out this whole thing now but when I need back up on the maturity and importance of adult discussions before making adult decisions, like going on birth control, you’re in the wind,” Jody said.
“So.” Sam’s voice was only a little forced. “Do you want pancakes?”
“Do you think she’s going to kill him?” Cas asked.
“Cas ruined it when he told you he loved you, didn’t he?” Sam continued, posture straightened. Sam had gone from a bent over question mark to a straight line the longer they looked for Cas, the further they got from Chuck’s shadow. Maybe it was the sunlight he kept bragging about from those dates with Eileen. Maybe it was Eileen. Maybe the lack of an outstanding world threatening disaster, maybe it was turning thirty-seven. It was like looking in a mirror that stretched back two decades that stopped and snapped, a perfect, complete, circle. Sam had solidified and taken form in freedom. The only thing that happened to Dean post-Chuck was his dick broke down.
“I wanted to do you a favor,” Miss Marbel said. She put a hand on Dean’s knee. “You seem like a good boy.”
Sam signed something quickly to Eileen, who turned to Dean with a big grin. “Sam’s a big boy. He’s good at handling little things.” She waggled her eyebrows.
“Damn, Sammy,” Dean said, making sure Eileen could read his lips, “what have you done to your girl? Scared her off already?”
Dean shivered in the warm, damp night. “I’m sorry,” Dean said.
“Sam,” Dean said. “Don’t do this.”
“What?”
Dean squinted. Heh. That was a role reversal. “Is that salad?”
“No, m’am,” Dean said, smiling back.
Jack’s expression cleared. “You’re talking about Sam,” he said. “Castiel told me that you sacrificed a lot to protect him. He said you were protecting Sam when he met you.”
“Now, hang on a minute,” Dean said before his brain was able to communicate with his mouth. “Why’s it got to be such a bad thing?”
Like when he went out to grab some shirts for him and Sam, came back with the cheapest rags in their size and Dad just raised an eyebrow asked, “what, you and Sam sign up for the fairy brigade when I wasn’t looking?” Dean hadn’t even realized the shirts were brightly colored.
“We’re gonna have to cut your hair soon,” Dean said, before his mind caught up to his mouth.
“‘Lo,” he answers.
“Dean, you’ve been sitting here and going on hunts and putting on this happy face, but I know you. I can’t remember the last time you went out, or hit on a waitress or, hell, opened one of those disgusting magazines I know you’re still subscribed to ‘cause they’re still getting delivered here --”
“I don’t know!” Sam told him, exasperated. “You ever think that maybe that’s why I’m asking, Dean?”
Dean could grumble all he wanted but Dean was in and Sam knew it.
“My dick’s broken,” Dean told him.
“He said he loved you,” Sam said and Dean was surprised when Sam pressed, “and that’s where he lost you, because you can’t imagine why the hell anyone would do that. You’re
After a long pause, Cas says, “Dean, I know that’s from Dirty Dancing.”
“Dean,” Sam said, signing for Eileen, “you’re not coming. Eileen, you promised me you’d go hiking if I -- ah,” he blushed and stopped. Dean waggled his eyebrows but did not press. There were some things brothers did not need to know about each other. “You promised,” he said.
Dean winced. He pushed the door open with his foot. “Uh,” he said. “No. It’s me, buddy.”
Sam blushed but kept Dean’s gaze. “I thought it’d be nice if she came to the dinner thing tonight, and she agreed, so.” He shrugged.
Dean had to stop this. “Cas,” he interrupted firmly, putting a hand out. “This doesn’t change anything.”
Dean’s dick wouldn’t get hard. Dean tried -- he tried everything, alright? Pulling at the skin, pinching his nipples, even the stupid reflexive dick-hard move he’d found on some google sites he’d lie about ever accessing if Sammy asked. His little man was just sitting there flaccid for the whole show. Flaccid! Sweat was working its way down his back. He couldn’t stop thinking about Miss Marbel on the stoop and Cas down the hall and when he closed his eyes and put his hand on his dick it was like he pulled the two of them across time to the same fucking place.
It doesn’t matter, because Cas just says, “Not really.”
He gave up on the porn and opened Google. He couldn’t be the first person to have these kinds of problems.
“Which one do I -- sorry, did you just ask me what t-shirt I thought was better?”
“So, Cas didn’t tell you he loved you, die, come back, and then move out?”
“What?” he snapped, regretting it. Snapping at Sam made his stomach curl up in half and his mouth tighten, like if it tried hard enough it could keep him at bay from the world. Seemed to be all he was doing these days, but still. Sammy should know better. Ask a stupid question, get a stupid answer.
“You’re an idiot,” Sam told him. “You can’t just decide to cut people out of your life because they don’t hate you enough.”
Dean ignored him. The pancake felt cold and grainy in Dean’s hand. He swallowed it anyway, then pointed at the last pancake on the plate. “Anyone gonna finish that?” he asked.
“Why would I want to watch the game?” Cas asked. He sounded bewildered. Dean winced.
“Yeah, man. Too long.”
“I overbrewed it.”
“He’s a poet,” Cas said. “I found one of his books on your bookshelf.” Cas looked away. “I hope it was alright for me to take it.”
Cas stiffened further. “You do not have a monopoly on personal problems or self-sacrifice, Dean.”
“Yeah?” Dean asked.
“He’s not avoiding you, Dean,” Sam said, exasperated. “He’s just resting. Sleeping. Maybe you’ve heard of it? Besides, Jody and Claire are coming by tomorrow. I’m sure you’ll get plenty of time to see him.”
Dean choked a bit on his laugh. “Course you loved him,” he told Jack. “He’s your father.”
“What?”
When Dean fell asleep, it was restless. Only good thing an orgasm ever gave him: a good night’s sleep.
Cas took the Ginsberg book. Dean huffed with a short laugh, looking at the bookshelf. His chest clenched. Sam said Cas was building his own bookshelf. He showed Dean a picture. It looked terrible. Dean told Sam that Cas could probably cover up a lot of the cracks with a good coat of paint and Sam said he’s pass it along. He’d tried to show Dean a copy of the finished product, but Dean hadn’t looked.
Turns out, Google Maps had nothing on Dean. Took him three and a half hours, rounding down, to pull up outside a dark green, single story house at the edge of New Salem. Dean looked over the splotchy trees, scraggly bushes and spaced out ramshackle houses. He could almost picture Cas there, walking, taking Jack to the lake, growing plants. Sitting on the porch and watching the sky.
“Oh, dude,” Dean said. “No one wants to hear that.”
“It is,” he said. “I’ve been in the shit my entire life and you don’t stay down here without getting dirty.”
Dean shrugged. “So, let’s get them.”
He considered using one of his magazines, but why settle for static images when he had some long time live action favorites right here in his browser bookmarks? After a split second, Dean dragged his laptop over to his bed and pulled down his boxers. Nothing to be weird about. Just a man getting down to business.
The grass beneath his fingers grounds him. Dean pushes his hand against the dirt. It’s usually hard in the day. Hard, cracked, dry. It’s still dew-damp now. Dean can push it around a little bit. Not much. It’s still dirt. Still hard Kansas soil. But right now, in the transition between a late night and an early morning, it’s less like rock fragments and more like clay.
That sent something ricocheting around between Dean’s ears that he dutifully ignored. “You’re freaking apologizing for saving Jack’s life and mine. What kind of asshole does that?”
Dean scoffed loudly, but Eileen beat him to the punch. “You almost ruined the pasta last night,” she said.
Dean had grown up talking to Mom. Not the real one. He wasn’t insane. He knew she was -- whatever. He talked to her sometimes. Asking her questions inside his head. Telling her things. Imagining her hand, the kind of soft that had never seen a day of work in its life, on his head. Made him smile to remember that now and think about Mary. Mary’d be more likely to cuff him around the head, too nervous to reach out and touch him and Sam and yeah, that part wasn’t great, but they’d been working on it. She’d been real enough to see and she’d had terrible advice but she’d been there.
“Then let’s go.”
Sam looked around before catching himself. “Actually,” he said, “think we’re going out.” He frowned at Dean. “You can make sure Cas has dinner, right? You have to sort of sit with him and make sure he actually eats it.”
“He told me.”
Dean shook his head. “Never mind,” he said. “‘S not important.” He moved further into the room, coffee clutched in each hand. He glanced around awkwardly.
He started packing Baby.
“Oh, really?” Sam scoffed. “And this is, what? You processing?”
“Yes,” Cas said stiffly. “Sam informed me that you two have not been able to contact him. That he is … god, now.”
Dean did not know where to start with that. His first thought was thank God he couldn’t get boners anymore. Dean shoved that away. “That’s good,” he said. It felt lame. He started to say something else -- what, Dean had no idea -- but thankfully, Cas cut him off.
Normally, Dean liked to do his little manual override in the shower if he couldn’t find other company to bury himself in. Force of habit, really, after forty-odd years sharing a tight space with blood relatives. And when you had three and a half minutes of hot water, you used whatever images got your train to pull out of the station. Didn’t mean anything. Dean would repeat that, remind himself again, and then hop in the shower. And it would be off to the races.
And in a home base with a million and a half empty rooms, Dean had more privacy that he could spare. Once, Dean would’ve killed for that kind of space. Now, he couldn’t really be bothered.
The book was gone the next day. Dean hadn’t brought anything to read. He sat. This was his life. Hunts dwindling, Cas gone. Just him, Sam, and the cold, relentless beat of the sun.
Dean’s sitting on the kitchen floor. His phone is next to him. It’s just starting to get late. It’s nearly pitch black. Cas didn’t call yesterday, so he might call today. Or tomorrow.
Dean squirmed. His knee knocked against Cas and he stilled, letting the heat bloom into his leg. He drew in a breath. “Understand?”
“No,” Cas agreed mildly, “But I have been human before. And I do -- feel.”
Unlike Doctor Sexy, Dean didn’t have a threesome. But Dean did start trying to masturbate again. Well, not physically.
“Are you and Sam happy?” Jack asked and Dean couldn’t help himself. He laughed. It was the bitter kind of laugh that scrapped against the back of his throat on the way out. Jack tilted his head and furrowed his brow and Dean tightened his grip on Mary’s grave not to buckle under it all.
“Exactly, you grew up with me. So you know what this life is like. You see why I gotta be -- not Dad, but, I don’t know, on the lookout, man.”
Cas was tilting his head and squinting at Dean and Dean was breathing and glaring and trying not to start fucking sobbing in the middle of his living room over a fucking movie night with his best friend and Jesus, how had watching some demon fighting chick brought them all to here? “I -- you want me?”
“I know.”
“Now, you idiot,” Rowena told him and Dean reached deep, deep, deep down into the cracked purple sky until he felt something latch on. Dean pulled and strained and stayed perfectly still until --
“I don’t understand,” Cas repeated.
Dean didn’t realize until after lunch the next day that Cas had meant leave the Bunker, not leave the Dean Cave.
“Thank you, Dean.”
“It’s fine,” Cas said.
Dean shook his head. “I’m talking about you,” he said. “We -- I -- was wrong. You should’ve never tried to become a bomb. I’ve, uh, I’ve actually been in the role of bomb to blow up God’s sister before. Told Cas he was my brother,” Dean’s mouth soured, “hugged Sam, everyone. I didn’t want to go, but I was glad it was me. Felt like I’d get to rest or something. Stupid, I know.”
“I don’t have boyfriends,” Dean said, strangled. It was important that everyone knew that. “Dick was -- Dick Roman, he was a person, Leviathan, okay, sent me and Cas to purgatory --”
“I want to say,” Cas said. “I love you.”
She pulled them out. “Good boys can get into a lot of trouble, if they’re not careful.”
“You gotta talk to him,” Dean said. “He misses you.” You’re his family. He loves you.
“All it can do is pull people out of the Empty. It’s not dangerous.”
Dean hadn’t told Sam. Dean didn’t know how to tell Sam about these moments. Sam would’ve just said John was right. He wasn’t the father the boys deserved.
Dean licked his lips. “Uh, yeah,” he said. “Can’t make you do all the heavy lifting around here, now can I?” He tugged Cas’ belt. “Come on. Less serious talk. More, uh,” and then, fuck it, Dean leaned down and swallowed whatever else the love of his shitty ass life might’ve said.
“Being able to feel. To choose. Dean. From nothing, I went to everything. And it hurt. But there is so much good down here inside and around the pain. It is real, Dean. It is good because it is real and because it hurts. And I would not trade it. I would not trade the choices I have made. You have given me -- everything. And I would give you everything. If you ever wanted. I know you do not understand. You don’t love me. You don't --”
“Okay, laugh it up big guy. But just remember, you’re stuck with me.”
It wasn’t very good. He finished it, put the book down, and then slammed his fists into the cracked and scorched Kansas earth as hard as he could. It felt good. Better than reading. Better than hunting. He did it again. And again. And again.
“Dean,” Sam protested, “I want him back too. I’m just saying. We gotta be realistic about this. Jack isn’t around, or if he is, he isn’t answering. You’ve been pushing yourself. Hard. I just think we have to consider the possibility that we won’t get Cas back.”
“Sam was going to show me his favorite hike,” Eileen signed. She leaned closer to Cas and Dean. “I don’t hike,” she told them. “Please join us.”
Dean chuckled. Cas found the words all right but apparently not the tact. “Yeah,” he said, “I know that song.” He patted the couch next to him. “Come here. I still got some leftover pizza.”
“Yeah?” Dean asked. “He your type?”
“You’re the only one that thinks that,” Sam said. “And even you know it’s not quite true. Dean. There’s no way you don’t know.”
Dean can only work his mouth soundlessly, chest gaping and empty, suffocating.
“Man, what are you talking about?”
Something was happening in Dean’s chest. His ribs were jutting, sharp, into his body and his teeth were aching. “You don’t know what you’re talking about,” he said without looking at Sam.
“Hydration is important,” Cas says, seriously.
Sam’s smile was lopsided. “I think it’s enough that I love her and I want to see what it means that we love each other. Good or deserving don’t really factor into it.”
As soon as they were both gone, Cas pulled out of the table away from Dean. “I’ll get out of your way,” he told Dean.
When it was clear Jack didn’t have anything else to say, Dean started to speak. It was like the words were pushing themselves out now and they needed to get all the way out of his throat before whatever this was snapped closed within Dean. “I don’t got a lot to offer. And I guess I give a lot of it to Sam. And I saw you needed better. Deserved better. I knew I couldn’t give it to you. After Cas -- I mean, I didn’t have anything left. So I got mad at you. And now I’m pushing Cas away. Cause it’s easier. But it isn’t right.”
“I thought it was clear, man,” Dean said quietly, trying to swallow around the lump in his throat. “I’m not --” he cleared his throat. “I’m asking to stay.”
“What?” Dean asked. “Why would I say that?”
Dean laughed.
“Shit, Cas,” Dean struggled to breath. “You can’t just say shit like that.”
Dean forced himself to swallow down his reply and not smash his hand into the wall. “Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do,” he told Eileen, smirking, instead of answering his brother. “Probably don’t want to do too many things I would do either.”
“Don’t be a bitch,” Dean replied. Sam made a face.
Cas was still frowning. “We? You and Sam?”
Dean reached the turn for the liquor store. He kept driving. He turned and got on the road just out of town to the cemetery. They’d burned Mary. Hunter’s funeral. Dean got a plot for her out here anyway. Dragged Sam over with him to pick out the headstone. Mom.
“Exactly?” Sam asked.
“The first time Eileen told me she loved me,” Sam said and Dean inhaled sharply. “I almost called you.”
Dean sunk his teeth into his cheek. His hand kind of hurt. His dick really hurt. The skin was starting to look kind of red and raw.
“Dean,” Cas said, “please stop harassing your brother. It is obviously Eileen who will be “putting a ring on it”, as you say.”
Cas gave it a squeeze. “It feels fine,” he told Dean, who went completely red.
“Right,” Dean agreed, weakly, mentally resigning himself to more poorly thought out puns and low budget effects. Him and Cas could probably get through the whole show over the next few months, if they really put their mind to it. Dean relaxed into the couch, planning it out. He let his fingers open slowly, twitching against Cas’ hair. Cas didn’t move. Dean relaxed his fingers a little more.
Dean bit back a laugh, still keeping Cas in his periphery instead of looking at him directly.
Dean didn’t like it and told Sam so.
It wasn’t good and it wasn’t right and it wasn’t how he was supposed to feel, so Dean tamped it down, but it was there. Only apparently not anymore.
Getting closer to the kitchen, Dean thought he could actually smell something besides just the barely burnt coffee Cas liked to make (“I am drinking coffee because I want to taste it, Dean. If I wanted to taste nothing, I’d drink water.”). Pancakes?
“My apologies, Dean.”
He didn’t, but fuck Sam for knowing that. “It’s not bullshit, Sam, it’s biological shit, okay? Cas’ angel biological clock doesn’t tick tock on the human button, no matter how much he’s changed up the rhythm.”
“No,” Cas says. “I am not with you, Dean. I’m in rural Montana.”
“Dean?” Cas asked.
he loves you because you like him and you don’t like seeing people you care about mess up. And dying afterwards? It’s just another piece of evidence that loving you is some kind of death sentence.”
“That’s fine. You don’t have to like it. It’s what’s happening.”
He rolled up his sleeves. He would masturbate, then he would go rescue Cas. Easy peasy.
Dean guffawed loudly. “You’re right,” he said. “Sam’s definitely the girl in that relationship.”
Miss Marbel put one of her hands into Dean’s shoulder and pressed down. “Like I said. This motel is good people. I’m trying to look out for you and your brother. I just wanna help you. Make sure you’re not into any of that faggot shit.”
“Dinner thing?”
Sam rolled his eyes, but he was smiling a bit. “No,” he said. “You are a jerk. And an asshole. And an anal retentive, insecure control freak who plays petty pranks and talks too much and has terrible taste in music. And you’re my older brother. I am terrified of what you would do for me. But I know you love me. I know you hunt because you want to save people, not because you want to kill monsters. But you can always kill monsters and you can’t always save people so it’s easier for you to pretend it’s the other way around. And,” he paused. Then, deliberately, he added, “you sleep with men.”
Cas swallowed. Dean waited. It was his turn to wait. Cas’ lips parted slightly and he tilted his head, as if he couldn’t understand what Dean was saying. Like he was trying to process. “You haven’t,” he voice was hoarse. “But Dean, I’m not -- I’m not going back to the Bunker.”
Dean tutted at his younger brother. “Now,” he said, “that would be telling.”
“Dean,” Sam said in his I-don’t-have-time-for-this voice, “I don’t have time for this.”
“You know,” Sam said.
Cas leaned back on the couch. Dean couldn’t stop his sharp inhale. He locked his fingers when he felt the back of Cas’ neck hit them. Loose strands of hair tickled the back of his hand. Dean started jiggling his foot. He let out a slow breath through his nose.
Cas could do whatever he wanted with his new house. Wasn’t Dean’s business. It made Sam get all grouchy when Dean said things like that, though, so Dean took to avoiding the Bunker even more.
“I know,” Dean replied, but didn’t ask.
“I think the pancakes are very good,” Cas told them all. “Sam, they are much better than your usual efforts.”
Dean grunts and brings his knees up to his chest. His jaw is tensed up near completely. He takes as deep a breath as he can manage and then picks the phone back up again. “I’m back,” he says.
Cas didn't try to say anything for a long time. When he did speak, his voice was hard and flat. “When I first touched your soul,” he told Dean, “it was blinding. You were blinding. I spent eons, eternities, believing in God, fighting for God, fighting on behalf of God. I was an Angel of Lord. But touching your soul in Hell is the only time I have ever felt holy. Is that a waste?”
It was so much easier to shut out these conversations in Baby when all Dean had to do was turn the tape deck up until he couldn’t even hear his own thoughts, let alone Sam’s. He could just watch his body cruise along beneath him, separate from the suffocating pressure that followed him around like a bad scent.
“Right,” Dean said. “Of course.” Nothing like a little gay poetry to get the mood up.
“Dean,” Sam said, through a fake smile and gritted teeth.
“It’s not my fault it’s a frigging comfortable couch.”
Cas is gone. He left two days ago and Dean had stayed late in the library doing research.
“Sorry,” Dean said. “I didn’t catch that. Pretty sure your girlfriend didn’t either.”
“Right,” Dean said, and put his hands in his pocket. “It’s true. I didn’t treat you right. I was --”
“Dean,” Cas said, pained, “I do not require sex to be happy with you.”
Dean didn’t move. “Not sure you’ve really been paying that much attention then,” he said.
It was hot in Kansas. Dean liked it. The Bunker was temperature controlled, perfect in every room. Outside, Dean’s shirt got sticky with sweat and his skin burned when he kept in one place too long. The ground was hard and dirty and the grass was short and scratchy and sometimes wet. There were bugs.
Dean didn’t answer. Maybe Sam would leave.
Cas, thankfully, let that one go without comment. His hand dropped off Dean’s shoulder and his expression got serious again. “It’s not about the pie specifically. Though the pie, of course, very nice. It’s,” Cas struggled to find the words and Dean watched him and Dean waited ‘cause Dean knew what that was like and he knew what it was like when someone didn’t let you, “it’s nice to choose things. As an angel, I wasn’t --” Cas cut himself off, looking around crowded, cluttered living the room a little embarassed. “It’s not a freedom I am familiar with. Perhaps I have not done the best job.”
