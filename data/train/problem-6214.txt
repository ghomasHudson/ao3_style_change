"I can't tell you what to do Becca. Just be nice." Steve dismisses her by pulling Tony back into his arms. She remains only for a moment before disappearing off. Steve sighs, resting his forehead against Tony's. "I'm sorry if I have to go clean that up."
"You're not asking." His voice has a finality to it that Steve knows means there was no talking him out of the obscene number. Tony kisses him on the cheek. "Now do you wanna get out of here or what?" Tony runs Steve's suit jacket between his fingers with a suggestive glint in his beautiful eyes.
Steve opens his eyes, nodding his head shakily. Tony caresses his jaw gently, running his hands down to shoulders, then to his arms, pulling them out of where they were locked together. Once that is relieved of him, he sags backward against the wall.
"Mr. Pozdnyakov, I presume?" The mans voice makes Steve's skin crawl. How much blood was on his hands, how much more would be there by the time he was dead.
"I know. But I owe it to him. I read the files, I know where he should be soon. Even if you won't help me, I have to."
"Ha ha. I may be dating your uncle, but I'm still your girlfriend's family ya little jackass," Steve counters, resisting the urge to flip him off. He really did like Victor, and he was pretty sure Victor knew that, even if he was a little shit (he was raised by Tony though, so it was excusable).
Tony digs his heel into Steve's thigh in response, not ceasing his attempted bruising of Steve's lips. Steve moves to suck at his jaw. Tony bares his neck, breathing heavily into the still elevator. "JARVIS, can you.. penthouse."
"Jeez, I'm sure he can't wait to meet you. Hasn't shut up about how he can't believe that we didn't recognize the Tony Stark." Bucky rolls his eyes. "It's cool that you're famous or whatever though. What do you do?"
"Sure, cap. Thanks." Steve doesn't reply, but he makes the pancakes. Thankfully, Scott has the mind to keep quiet, until Steve sets a stack of pancakes down in front of him. "These look good. We need to get going in thirty."
Steve shakes his head with a chuckle. "Peter has got to have some crazy ass stories. Hanging with royalty and the Tony Stark? He must be pretty popular," he jokes his eyes finding the road to make sure Tony's taking the right turns.
"They'd have a field day with you. If you were Italian, I'm almost sure my mother would have you sniffed out as the perfect husband by now. She's uncanny."
Steve hums gently. He was definitely feeling sleep tugging at his body, just laying here in the dimmed lights with his very warm boyfriend cuddling onto his side. "Good night."
Instead, Bucky Barnes walks into his penthouse, giving Tony a once over, confusion drawing on his face. "I'm guessing you forgot we had a.. um a meeting."
"Reassuring. What you can't do, hopefully the serum can." Steve says, peering down at his own face. "Nat, how do you feel about dressing up like you're pretending to be from the 40's?"
"Can you fuck out of here for a minute," Tony snaps back at him, "we don't need your dumb shit riddles."
"Your kids in danger. We can make a plan." Steve sets a comforting hand on his shoulder, falling into the co-pilots seat next to him.
Wanda shrugs at him, the corners of her mouth twitching up. She looked very well put together, and not at all like she had been woken up two hours ago (with terrible bedhead) by Steve going back for Tony's gift. Victor looked equally nice, which was a stark comparison to Peter, who had his fists clenched so tight, that Steve couldn't imagine it not hurting. He seemed to be wearing the same clothes he had worn to school yesterday, but other than that, he seemed to have tried to pull himself back together. Steve couldn't imagine him not being torn up though, even if at first glance he looked just fine.
"You're not gonna leave me for married men are you?" Steve jokes, folding his and Tony's fingers together and pulling their joined hands into his lap.
"As if this wasn't evidence enough?" He teases, pausing his tying to gesture at the bathroom with a raised eyebrow.
"Scared? No. Justly concerned? A bit. I saw what he did to Fury's car, and I like all my cars a lot. If they get destroyed, it should be by me."
"She's my roommate. And my employee. And a brat." Steve shrugs, tangling his fingers together with Tony's, still holding it firmly against his hip.
He snorts. "Go wash your hands, Tasha." Long ago they had agreed upon the need to keep up some pretenses even in their room, there could easily be a bug in the room and it was better to pretend then to die. The only real conversations they could have were in Morse code, tapped out on each others skin quickly. He walks into the bathroom, ending the possibility of an honest conversation with the click of a door. He looks down at his fist, already healing from the damage it had sustained from his little show. The blood soaked clothes get tossed right down the laundry chute, and he climbs into the small, one-person shower. His reflection is hardly his anymore, so he doesn't bother to look. His hair is still dyed black, and he hardly feels like himself after being here for so long. The cold water and scratchy soap can't get the feeling of blood off of his skin.
"Sure thanks man. Nice decorations," he says, handing over the box. It's lighter than Steve expected, even given the size of the box. Even he couldn't help but wonder what it was. Tony had been harassing him for a chance to open his presents before anyone else got there.
Tony looks over at him and smiles. Sure, they were both worse for wear, but they were alive and together, against all the odds. Against the universe itself. Now, they might actually be able to settle down somewhere. Together. Alive. "You can sleep too." Tony says, looking back at the, indeed, mostly asleep group of teens, and even Happy.
"Hm?" Tony's eyes flutter shut, dark lashes over tan skin. He's beautiful. He's everything Steve ever wanted and more.
Tony puts the car into drive and pulls out of the parking spot onto the busy New York roads. "Yeah, how'd you know?"
Tony lands after what he would guess was a half hour of flying, laying Steve down on the floor. "Hey winghead. You still with me?"
Woooh so that was a big one! Now our boys have to find the love on Bucky‚Äôs life.. stay tuned, and thanks for the encouragement üíïüíï
Steve takes the first step, cupping Tony's jaw and pulling him up into a real kiss. Tony's arms slide up around his neck, so really what's Steve to do other then what he does. He picks Tony up, clean right off the floor and carries him to the window. Tony's legs wrap naturally around his waist, but he's clearly entirely comfortable with the new position given the way he licks into Steve's mouth. He was beautiful, he really was. Like the stars in the sky or waves on a beach.
Tony had been on this complicated stealth mission with Steve for three days now. They had to check up on five bases in the west of China. Really just checking if the signs they got from that area would become something troublesome or false alarm. It was mid-July so approximately 15 ‚ÑÉ, so their dingy wooden cabin wasn‚Äôt too bad to stay in. Tony had shot a prayer at the God‚Äôs above for the cabin having two bedrooms, the god being Nick Fury, Maria Hill and Phil Coulson. If it were up to the other Avengers they would put them in the Hulk room and not let them out until they finally kissed and made-up. Tony was not feeling that method.
Tony took the lead for several minutes, dancing the easier version of the waltz. Tony‚Äôs eyes were sparkling with joy and Steve had never felt this right at a gala ever. All their friends were there, they were celebrating a successful battle and everyone was enjoying themselves!
Several kilometres away they landed and walked back circuitous to avoid being followed to their cabin. Steve seemed to limp and Tony slipped his arm around the man‚Äôs back gingerly.
They looked extremely neutral about it all. Sam shot him a look which Tony interpreted as an 'I want to talk, please?'-look and Bucky's face did something complicated, regret, relief, shame, guilt. It was a weird mix and Tony would definitely talk to him if he wanted to.
Scott and Wanda seemed indifferent and he couldn't be more glad he assigned them room on the other side of the compound. Vision would keep Wanda busy he had promised.
‚ÄúI just wish you would have come to me about it. You‚Äôre doing really well in this odd new era despite only being here for less than a year and I just forgot for a minute you might not know things.‚Äù Tony rambled to him.
‚ÄúExactly, everything for my boyfriend. I‚Äôll become an expert for him on anything.‚Äù Tony wiggled his eyebrows when Steve looked at him with his red-rimmed eyes and tear-stained cheeks. Tony cupped his face and gave a kiss to his forehead and then his nose and then a lingering kiss on the lips.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I will. I know that Steve is still here and I know how to handle nightmares when they come back. I might try to find something like how to reduce stress and exercise to relax, like PT. That might help both of us, I hope. And Steve needs his sports to calm down so he needs to find new ways to do that, at least stuff like boxing I mean.‚Äù Tony rambled a little incoherently.
After that, they focused on the two meetings left and four hours later Tony left the building. The text from Steve had only been an ‚ÄúI miss you and how are you doing‚Äù text, which Tony answered just before going into his third meeting of the day. Now, it was 5 pm, and he was on his way to the Tower, with Pepper. He texted Steve he would be in his workshop finishing up some papers and other minor tasks before going up to have dinner.
Steve huffed, ‚ÄúAnd you think you‚Äôre the only sassy friend I have? I‚Äôll have to introduce you to them then.‚Äù
After their fight all that disappeared and Steve kept up this facade, he had been fine, but could not just be anymore. He needed to be the leader of a group of people who chose his side and he couldn't back down anymore. He had been so confused and there seemed no way out with the route he had picked. He had chosen to fight for Bucky and a level of freedom,  apart from the USA Government. He was all alone in his decision, even though he wasn't so sure anymore about it. He had admitted to Tony that he should have been more open about his struggles with losing so many people around him and hadn't seen how he could have influenced the Accords with amendments.
'You sure Steve? You sound unsure. Who did you dance with? I'm sure someone wanted to swing around with Captain America on the dance floor!'
After several minutes of coaxing Steve had let up a little and started breathing as Bucky instructed him to, which helped.
Steve was pulled out of his deep thoughts when Bucky pushed his drink in his hands and said something about dancing with Sam.
Two weeks later they would have to leave for the mission and after a week Tony called Steve down to the shop.
"No, of course not. It's just dancing together, not our first dance after marriage, we‚Äôre not together, and these people are too busy with themselves to care about two men dancing together." Tony looked convinced.
Tony had given the team the limited information he knew and then passed out again. He woke up roughly half an hour later when the team had reached them. Tony had stumbled towards Steve, pushing away anyone who tried to catch him and stop him from reaching his boyfriend. Tony saw a rescue squad lifting his Steve onto a stretcher and into a trauma helicopter. All alarm bells started ringing in his mind. Steve looked so unnaturally pale and he hadn‚Äôt moved at all, Tony sunk to the ground on his knees, somewhere distant he felt rubble puncturing his hands and legs and his ankles were throbbing, but he did not care, his probably lifeless boyfriend was getting carried away into a trauma helicopter. A body had sat down next to him, wrapped his arms around him and let him sob into his shoulder, the distinct perfume of Rhodey he noticed. Tony had passed out from shock, which resulted in him waking up in a hospital bed. Rhodey and Nat sat next to him and Rhodey had given him a glass of water while Nat had asked a nurse to come and look at Tony. He had gotten some saltine crackers, later when the shock had completely worn off he got an actual meal.
Tony wasn't surprised to see the broken sadness on his friends‚Äô faces. They again hugged him and if they felt him trembling in their arms, they were nice enough to let him cry it all out, instead of consoling him and saying 'it would all be alright in the end' because even they couldn't promise that.
"Thanks,‚Äù Steve said, ‚Äúnot getting time to practise my dance skills doesn't help with formal events like these," Steve said softly.
Tony woke up with an immense headache, a great way to start the day. Today was the long-awaited day. He felt a panic attack lingering, he hadn't minded his anxiety medication ever since he heard about The Rogues wanting to return. It all felt wrong but he refused to show how much it scared him. Repairing broken relationships was not one of his talents. Steve, Natasha, Clint, Sam, Wanda, Scott and Bucky all signed the Accords. T'Challa and Tony had had many calls discussing the amendments demanded by The Rogues and now 5 months later, they would move into the Compound in up-state New York. He had five hours to entertain himself and try to avoid spiralling. Rhodey, Pepper and Peter were at the Compound for that exact reason. It was a Saturday so he could tinker around with Rhodey and Peter in the shop, work on the Spiderman suit and Rhodey's War Machine armour, a dark blue version with better cushioning and support for his lower half.
"Yeah, I think so too, we were pretty bad I believe. But I wanna celebrate too, with you, if you don't mind?" Steve peered through one eye up at Tony.
The big oblivious blonde man who was too handsome and funny for his own good. Steve felt like safety, Steve cared, Steve dragged him upstairs for food, team bonding and was his pillow for when he fell asleep halfway into movie night.
Steve sighed. In the 9 months after the battle, he had been talking with Tony a lot. Tony had been recovering for the first two months, the snap took a lot from him. He lost his right arm, he had gotten pretty bad scarring over his neck, face and chest. He lost his eyesight in his right eye and had been sleeping the majority of those months because of fatigue. Steve had helped with the organisation of the recovery, however, he had also sat long evenings by Tony's side. Tony hadn't had enough energy to talk those first three weeks so Steve had mostly helped him with eating and drinking. And sometimes comforting him, when Tony would wake up gasping for air and extremely disorientated. His nightmares were mostly about his time lost in space, losing the battle and everyone close to him in the snap. Steve hadn't known what to do at first but his instinct kicked in and he helped Tony breathe, get orientated, told him where he was, which day and year and anything factual to ground him. After weeks, he and Tony had talked about it all, all the things they could have done better, things they shouldn't have said, apologized to each other and made peace with it all, Tony wanted to move on and Steve solely wanted to declare how sorry he was and he would be going to therapy to deal with all his struggles, survivors guilt, the panic attacks and anxiety, the PTSD and his feeling of responsibility for what all happened to his friends. They had made a deal to be as open and honest as possible, Tony would go to therapy as well, as soon as he could leave the hospital.
"I definitely won't mind, I would gladly celebrate it with you. I missed you, you all, but especially you." Tony whispered.
Tony slipped further under the blankets, into Steve's arms, and let their noses just touch, breathing the same air.
'Do you wanna give me another round of lessons? You're very good and I would love to learn from the best.' Steve smiled at the man.
‚ÄúI know Tony, thank you. I love you too, so much.‚Äù Steve‚Äôs voice quivered and new tears formed in his eyes, which Tony whipped away.
‚ÄúAre you sure? That‚Äôs your private space almost.‚Äù Steve asked a bit in shock, that Tony would offer him that.
Steve had grown out a beard and his hair was long! Tony thanked God's above for his immense self-control.
"All those champagne socialists, yeah, very exhausting, right? To be one as well." Steve smiled playfully at Tony scrambling his confidence together and hoping that Tony would laugh at his joke.
The Avengers were at a fundraising gala for the repair costs of New York. It was several months after the Chitauri came pouring from the sky and they, the Avengers, had defeated them after a nerve-wracking battle, and Tony had flown a nuke into space. Tony had rebuilt the Avengers Tower, as it was now known as, and everyone had moved in. The six adults enjoyed living together, although it took several missions, team bonding training and movie nights to get there.
Rhodey, Peter and Pepper followed him to the landing platforms for the jets. He nervously wrapped his hands behind his back, the presence of Pepper and Rhodey on his side helped a little. Peter stood in front of Rhodey and shot a nervous and excited glance to Tony. Vision landed behind Tony and laid a hand on his shoulder.
'Let's pack, guys. We have a meeting with the King in a few days and Steve, you need to see your buddy and Sam you need to stress bake some cookies and cake for that meeting. Be at the jet in 30 minutes." Natasha folded the newspaper and went into her room to pack her bags, remove any trace of her stay there and pack the leftover of food. 45 minutes later they were on their way to Wakanda.
‚ÄúYeah! It‚Äôs me, Tony. Come on, take some deep breaths. In and out.‚Äù Steve kept up his rambling about factual stuff.
Tony shot Pepper an apologetic look which Pepper just disregarded. They worked another hour and Steve seemed to fluctuate heavily between crying, build up energy and frustration, defeat and an intense need for comfort. Tony did not acknowledge Steve‚Äôs tears except for rubbing comforting circles onto his hand and thighs when he had his right hand free. Pepper left for the communal kitchen to eat with the team, while Tony stayed behind with Steve.
Steve let himself be steered towards the couch where he normally would be sitting to draw. It hit Tony that Steve couldn‚Äôt draw anymore, he was right-handed. He pushed that idea out of the way and comforted himself with the thought that he could draw with his prosthetic or left-hand.
Tony snorted and rolled over into Steve‚Äôs side, with his head buried in the taller man‚Äôs neck. Steve planted a soft kiss into the thick, coarse, black hair.
A new message on his private phone came in, it was from Steve, which made Tony a little nervous. He was hoping for a neutral or positive message. It had been a month since he had been at Stark Industries the last time, because of their last mission.
This plot came to my mind because of the lovely pineapplebread (Twitter, Tumblr and Instagram), please look up her amazing art. She made this piece of Steve and Tony in these gorgeous suits and well... this happened. I hope it does justice to the artwork!
"He said yes. Holy shit Steve," Bucky mutters, clearly doing some mental math about exactly what that much money would do for them. Nothing Steve hadn't already thought through. Steve gives him a thumbs up and Bucky goes back around, apparently to let Tony know that that was all good, because the door bell rings with the sound of someone leaving.
"Wait... he's your..." that didn't make sense, not really. Steve knew Tony had a kid, but it didn't seem like him to purposely omit information about a second biological child, especially if Steve knew him already. Not to mention that Victor had called him Uncle Tony. Maybe that was... something. Steve couldn't say he understood exactly.
"Oh more than anything," Tony responds, absolutely hooking on to Steve's plan. "I haven't been able to stop thinking about that cake."
Nat pinches both Clint and Sam, stepping up between them. "Yes we were. We're glad to see you back. And yourself."
"Your daddy thinks you're not going to be named after your favorite uncle," Tony says conspiratorially. Pepper rolls her eyes. "We can't wait to see you."
"Strawberry creme. But I'm also partial to lemon poppy seed," Steve answers easily, grateful for a distraction from his twisted mind.
He starts walking, his boots leaving heavy footprints behind him. "J, uh. Right for yes, Left for no. Is Steve's emergency tracker working?" Left. Damn. "Is mine?" Also left. "Great. Do we have enough power that I could fly to look for him?" Right. Great. Finally some good news. "Alright, up we go. Talk to you later buddy." Tony soars up into the air, frigid wind rustling through his hair. His helmet was jammed though, so he knew very well that he would just have to deal with it. He flies low to the ground, and slow, searching for any sight of red and blue. His arm hurts like a son of a bitch, but he would just have to live with that. As he flies out further though, he spots a distinct grey smoke against the chilly white clouds. That might be Steve.
"Like I said, I can have my lawyers on it doing damage control, but it's already." Tony waves his hand. "Sorry. I feel I probably should've caught this before, well... you can blame me if you want." He says it so nonchalantly that Steve thinks Tony must be used to people blaming him for things that aren't his fault.
"Wait... how long has it been," Tony asks, wrapping one arm around Steve as best he can while trying not to mess with the wires. There was no telling what they were doing.
"Ok, we've definitely got some explaining to do," Steve says, offering Nat a hand. She takes it, pulling herself to her feet. She leans against him even once she's up, which is how Steve knows it's serious. Personal feelings aside, he had to make sure she was ok as soon as possible.
"How can I. You're taking all the stupid with you," his voice is cold, but he doesn't resist when Steve pulls him in for a hug. "I'm gonna miss ya, Buddy."
Steve slices through the neck of a prisoner with his shield, feelings claw scrape at his skin. "Well I'll have to meet her then." Truth be told, he had met Jane once at one of Tony's parties shortly before Ultron. She was nice, smart. Reminded him a bit of Peggy, especially when Thor retold the part of their relationship where she slapped him... twice. Thor had eyes for her and only her. A week later, they were broken up and nobody could ask him why because he was MIA for a few days, only returning at the beckoning of Strukers base. Then he was gone for entirely different reasons and Steve didn't see him again until the battle of Wakanda.
Tony opens the back, letting it hover near the bridge. "We can't set down so you can just jump in here!" He shouts back at Peter. Seconds later, Peter jumps for it, with the girl who Tony could now recognize as MJ from the academic decathlon team, clutched to his side. He was bleeding more than Tony liked, but somebody had to fly the jet. "Hey kiddo. Hi MJ"
Mmmmmhhhhh maybe Tony needed some endorphins right now. Jesus fucking shit. Fuck. What the hell? "No you don't." Tony's brain responds almost immediately. Seriously, there was no way. Tony knew Steve, and Steve did absolutely not have a crush‚Äîas cute as that was‚Äîon Tony. On any man. Steve hadn't expressed overly homophobic feelings, but.... not even once. He hadn't mentioned anything of the sort‚Äîno. Steve was high. Or dying. Not serious. Maybe he was joking. That made more sense.
"He's having a panic attack. And he turned down a marriage proposal that he wanted to accept, so well, I'm guessing there's another person I'm going to need to find too. You don't have to come with," Steve offers, looking up at the waiter coming back towards them.
Belatedly remembering himself, Steve hurriedly pulls a clean white tank over his head and tugs it down to his waist. He grabs the first shirt finds in the closet, a lightweight blue plaid, and slips it over his shoulders. He‚Äôs starting to button it up when Tony catches his attention.
‚ÄúHe lives!‚Äù  Darcy shouts, throwing her arms up in a triumphant V and nearly punching Jane in the face.  Luckily Jane‚Äôs a quick thinker and ducks, leaving Darcy‚Äôs hand to smack uselessly against Thor‚Äôs broad chest.  ‚ÄúStark‚Äôs back, Clint you owe me five bucks.‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs SOP where Stark is concerned.‚Äù  Phil kisses Pepper‚Äôs hand in a very gentlemanly, respectable fashion and Tony rolls his eyes.
He hears it first, and then moments later Tony sees a Mi-24 helicopter flying away from the building, so close that he feels if he‚Äôd just been quick enough, he could‚Äôve touched it.  There‚Äôs a flash of blonde hair he would recognize anywhere, a prone form lying deathly still near the ‚Äòcopter‚Äôs open door.
He‚Äôs wearing the shirt Tony bought for him at American Apparel last week; the deep vee of the dark maroon tee is partially covered by his scarf, but Tony can still see a hint of his sharp collarbone, the fabric clinging deliciously to the muscular cut of his pecs.  A threadbare grey hoodie is zipped halfway up his wide chest, and a brown corduroy blazer somehow sits un-rumpled over the whole ensemble.  Despite his broad shoulders, his waist is impossibly narrow, and Tony slips his hand down to rest there, sliding underneath the layers of his clothing to touch the warm bare skin of Steve‚Äôs back, just above the top of his dark wash jeans.
Stark pushes away from the table and stands. Leaving the remains of his and Steve‚Äôs breakfast for someone else to clean up, he heads for the elevator.  Bucky can hear him direct JARVIS where to go.
It‚Äôs ridiculous that even as he and Steve are rutting together, Steve actually blushes.   Tony captures Steve‚Äôs mouth, the kiss graceless and eager and totally desperate.  He licks his way inside and draws Steve‚Äôs tongue out against his own.   Steve groans quietly, hips arching in an aborted thrust.  Tony whispers an encouragement, not wanting Steve to hold back.
girl. This is the first picture we make, we can‚Äôt start lowering our standards right off the bat. It‚Äôs gotta be perfect if we‚Äôre going to make a lasting impression, let the Hollywood players know that we mean business.‚Äù
hits Tony hard, a wave of absolute want and need crashing over him in a way he was simply not ready for.
Steve forces an awkward half-smile of acknowledgement; although they have different reasons, he does share Jan‚Äôs frustration. He pulls at the lapels of his coat, directing his eyes carefully away from Tony even though all he wants to do is look. Despite the fact he knows his clothes quite literally fit him perfectly at the moment, the collar of his shirt is starting to feel tight. He loops a finger under his black bow tie and tugs; he can't breathe.
Tony peeks upward, instinctively concerned at the noise. Steve‚Äôs head has dropped forward, chin almost to his chest. His hair falls into his eyes, which look nearly black in the dark room. His perfect teeth are worrying his full bottom lip and his chest is rising and falling with his rapid breath.
Steve wants to feel outrage over the presumption, but the fact of the matter is that he hadn‚Äôt so much as glanced at the menu and he has no idea what he might have done instead.
Tony brandishes the bottle opener and expertly pries the caps from each bottle.  He flips the caps into the sink with the rest of the empties.
Tony brushes a thumb in small circles over the back of Steve‚Äôs hand, thinking for a long moment before deciding just to tell Steve the news he‚Äôs been sitting on for awhile.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre going to be appalled at a great many buildings besides my tower, Cap, give it time.  Mine will look positively restrained by comparison.‚Äù  Tony winks.  With most of Park Avenue and parts of Midtown destroyed in the Chitauri‚Äôs attack and the Lower East and West Side being gentrified like mad, there‚Äôll be less of old New York around than ever.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù  She runs a hand over her hair, sighing in frustration.  ‚ÄúIs this not enough for you?‚Äù  Pepper gestures between them.  There are tears in her eyes and Tony wonders how long she‚Äôs been on the verge of crying without him noticing.  ‚ÄúWith me running the company, and let‚Äôs face it, you basically running the Avengers Initiative, we barely see one another.  The fact that you‚Äôre not in the armor rushing headlong to take on every danger does makes you safer, Tony, but it doesn‚Äôt make you
He nods, locking into Steve‚Äôs intense gaze, trying to tell him just how much this will mean to him.  It means everything.
Janet Van Dyne is the most sought-after costume designer next to Edith Head, and she‚Äôs been staying with a friend in the apartments across the street for two weeks now. Steve tries not to listen to gossip, but it‚Äôs been everywhere that she and Hank Pym, her actor husband, are on the outs and quite possibly heading for a scandalous divorce.
‚ÄúThe lovebirds have reconciled?‚Äù Thor asks, gesturing between the pair and Natasha shrugs, shaking off James‚Äô touch and fixing her black pork pie hat that he‚Äôd jostled askew.  ‚ÄúOr perhaps not.‚Äù
He loses touch with reality for a moment. The world goes foggy and dim. When he comes back to himself, he realizes that in the heat of the moment, he‚Äôd wrapped his right hand around Tony‚Äôs atop the towel rack.
‚ÄúLike that‚Äôs possible,‚Äù Clint mutters under his breath as Bruce ducks out after Tony.  Steve ekes out a smile somehow, even though Clint‚Äôs comment was barely funny and not a single person in the room cares.  It just seems like he should try to react normally to things; they‚Äôre expecting him to handle this.  He couldn‚Äôt fall to a million pieces when he woke up in 2012, and he can‚Äôt fall to a million pieces now.
Tony can‚Äôt quite believe it and doesn‚Äôt know if he ever will.  That might be for the best, because the last thing he wants is to take Steve for granted the way he has others in the past.
Steve steps out onto the red carpet under an absolute onslaught of bright lights and deafening noise. The car door falls closed behind him, and with it his last means of escape. He‚Äôs in this now. Flash bulbs pop and reporters shout, and he clings more tightly to Wanda as she gracefully sashays under the brand-new marquee. Where only last month it had read Spencer Tracy and James Stewart in
‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù Rhodey asks softly. Tony can hear the concern in his voice but can't bring himself to look at him and see all that pity directed his way.
‚ÄúPressure‚Äôs good.‚Äù  Steve‚Äôs too close and it takes Tony a second to realize what he even means.  ‚ÄúWater stayed hot too.‚Äù
‚ÄúStark‚Äôs trying to figure out a way to fix me.  If there even is a way.  Fury‚Äôs been letting me come here nearly every day though; seems like I‚Äôm hardly twitchy at all ‚Äòround you.  I remember things better.  Course I get lovely escorts to keep me in line.‚Äù  Bucky runs a finger along the catch of the handcuffs.  Steve can see where his wrist is red and irritated.  He‚Äôs not wearing prisoner‚Äôs garb though ‚Äì just the SSR t-shirt and beige trousers that Fury seems to think is standard issue for anyone who has been displaced in time.  ‚ÄúHe asked about you, you know.  Stark.  Didn‚Äôt really seem much like he wanted to, but he did anyway.  Asked what you were like, back then.‚Äù
Tony pulls up a stool and sits beside him, and Peter shoves his hand in his hair anxiously and forces a tight smile onto his face that he prays comes across as totally innocent.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got some of the reels in here, don‚Äôt we?‚Äù Tony had seen the box sitting along the back wall; he‚Äôd been purposefully ignoring it until now. ‚ÄúSlap one on. I‚Äôll take one look to satisfy your insanity and then we can talk about selling off the rights to the highest bidder. Then at least
The second photograph is in lackluster color, a modern machine-printed SHIELD-issued ID that renders the details of the man‚Äôs uniform barely discernable save the white star against the dark navy material. Rogers‚Äô hair is blond, his skin pale, but the color of his eyes is not readable. He only knows they are blue because he has read it in the stats.  Nevertheless, Rogers looks nearly the same as he had in the previous snapshot.
‚ÄúI know‚Ä¶but I should go before it starts to get light out.‚Äù Tony reluctantly admits, slipping off to Steve‚Äôs side again as he glances toward the window. Steve nods, knowing that‚Äôs true.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôll just meet up and go anywhere if both Nat and I ask,‚Äù Steve remarks, and then looks over Tony‚Äôs shoulder to explain their destination to Bucky.  ‚ÄúL‚Äôs got a magic show at a club in the East Village.‚Äù
He turns to find Tony leaning in the doorway, looking suave and relaxed and exactly where he belongs.
And so as Howard fawned over Steve Rogers like he was the obedient son he‚Äôd really wanted and never had, his real son nearly got blown to smithereens while on a mission in Vichy-held French North Africa. It was the Germans, not the Italians, who held him captive in Morocco until Operation Torch brought the Allied forces to his rescue.
‚ÄúYou could have called.‚Äù Steve points out flatly, which Tony knows is reasonable, even if Tony had just told him he‚Äôd been lost in the throes of invention and clearly was not thinking about any real life practicalities like phone calls or dinner dates. ‚ÄúI know you at the very least have my number on all that contract paperwork, I wrote it enough times.‚Äù
But he‚Äôs already pulling Steve back, and Steve, despite his strength and bulk, comes crashing toward him. Maybe he hadn‚Äôt been expecting Tony to try and stop him from going, because all of him is suddenly in Tony‚Äôs arms, body pressed tight along his and his mouth so close and‚Äî
Bucky‚Äôs bedroom door is shut, his light off. The snore that interrupts the silence assures Tony that in his stupor Bucky must have tumbled into bed and he probably, hopefully, won‚Äôt wake until morning.
‚ÄúOf course I mean it, Cap.  Why don‚Äôt you go find Natasha and do some more making up, making out, whatever it is you that two are doing, and I‚Äôll come find you when I finish fixing your friend.  Then the two of them can battle it out and you can leave me out of it.‚Äù
, as a means to an end ‚Äì a mere stop on the way to being a better soldier, becoming a more useful man. It was never meant to define him, and he doesn‚Äôt want that kind of attention ever again.
‚ÄúShe likes you,‚Äù Tony says after a long pause.  He walks slowly across the wide room, keeping a few feet of space between them as he passes by.  ‚ÄúSome folks consider her a good judge of character, so you should take that as a compliment.‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the third one this week, Barnes,‚Äù Stark comments, pulling his attention away from doting on Steve long enough to notice what‚Äôs going on in the rest of the kitchen.  ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt like the pattern, there are other ways to channel your inner Martha Stewart.‚Äù
Tony actually has to reach down and pinch the base of his own cock to keep himself from coming. He groans around Steve and the sensation must be too much to handle even for Steve, because his hips buck upward and his cock slips too far down Tony‚Äôs throat. Tony gags as his throat spasms.
‚ÄúMe, I was nothing but bad luck.  He was always stuck digging me out of scrapes, savin‚Äô my ass when some bully had me cornered‚Ä¶can‚Äôt think of how many dates ‚Äòa his I ruined because he insisted his dame bring a friend so I could tag along.  You shoulda seen those poor gals‚Äô faces ‚Äì expecting a setup with a good lookin‚Äô guy like Buck and then looking over, lookin‚Äô down, seeing me.‚Äù  He chuckles, but Tony doesn‚Äôt.  ‚ÄúAnyway.  Point is, Bucky‚Äôs had a million and one reasons to turn his back on me.  Things would‚Äôve been a helluva lot easier for him if he had.  But he never did.  Not once.‚Äù
‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt my first, exactly.‚Äù Steve admits, casting his gaze about the lobby. He‚Äôs not looking for Tony ‚Äì he‚Äôs
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a reassuring start.‚Äù Steve's tone is somewhat resigned, like he might already know what‚Äôs coming.
He actually hates lavender, but he doesn‚Äôt think he‚Äôs ever bothered to tell her that.  Someday when she‚Äôs not three seconds from leaving him he‚Äôll bring that up.
He repeats Bucky‚Äôs words to himself, almost like the feeling of it all isn‚Äôt enough to convince himself it‚Äôs all real, either. His best friend is inside him.
He sighs in frustration and sets his sketchpad aside.  The air is still heavy and damp with this morning‚Äôs earlier rain and the sky is flat gray.  It makes the sculpture seem darker both in color and tone, the Mad Hatter looking vaguely sinister and Alice forlorn.
Giving in to his worst impulses, Tony jumps up, nearly tripping over his feet in his hurry to catch up with Steve before he‚Äôs gone. He slams through the door and darts down the stairs, feet clattering gracelessly in an undignified scramble.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine, Stark, thanks.‚Äù  Steve mutters darkly as he drags himself toward the pond‚Äôs edge, his clothes a clinging, wet weight on his body.  Tony‚Äôs mood may have shifted, but his hasn‚Äôt.  He‚Äôd been perfectly all right not fifteen minutes ago and then Tony had to come down and ruin everything.  Now he‚Äôs wet and tired and upset, and Tony‚Äôs enjoying it.
It makes Tony wonder what gossip is going around SHIELD about his and Steve‚Äôs tense, acrimonious start, because somehow, despite any misgivings he has about Cap, he doubts that Steve‚Äôs the one gabbing at the water cooler, sharing all the dirty details.
Steve looks at the twisted shards of highly polished and shaded red and gold metal, the blue-white broken glass, the shining light, and it strikes him that Bucky is right.
Jane brought her wine glass outside with her, and she smiles at him around its rim as she takes a sip.
Bucky ‚Äì looks as tired and pale as he had when they‚Äôd finally taken him down and brought him into custody.
ass.  ‚ÄúAnd I know we got a lot to talk about and all, but I swear to god I‚Äôm not gonna be able to think clearly until I fuck you.  Or you fuck me.  I don‚Äôt even care; I honestly cannot concentrate on anything else besides getting your clothes off right now.‚Äù
‚ÄúAlways for you,‚Äù Steve replies. ‚ÄúKept thinking of you. Kept wondering what it‚Äôd be like if you were watching.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe can stay at the mansion, Tony.  We don‚Äôt have to move.‚Äù  Steve squeezes his hand, knowing without being told that he has his reasons for not wanting to go back there.  ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs fine there.‚Äù
be shocked when you make horrible decisions. I should be used to this by now. But somehow, you still manage to surprise me.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou know Zola was in the midst of testing a new variant of the serum on Barnes when you first rescued him from HYDRA.  While not a success, we believe the lingering effects might have contributed to his survival.‚Äù
Tony wrenches the shower on and disrobes quickly, climbing in before the water has a chance to heat.  The fact that his dick‚Äôs already half-hard sends another wave of guilt crashing over him for having hung up on Pepper.
‚ÄúWhen have I ever lied to you?‚Äù Tony is caught off-guard by this accusation hitting before others. It usually doesn‚Äôt play that way in his fights with others.
He‚Äôs no danger to Tony and Steve. He‚Äôs seen the way Steve looks at Tony, and Tony has too. They both know he doesn‚Äôt stand a chance.
But when he'd seen Loki's lips on Steve's, he'd seen red. He had instantly become violently angry over Steve with another man, as if he had the right. And that makes him all the more sick to think of what had really been happening. What Steve had been willing to do, to stoop to, all because Loki caught them in the one place Tony had thought would be safe.
It‚Äôs odd, his former girl and his bodyguard getting hitched, but Tony thinks it should feel worse than it actually does. Ninety percent of the time he‚Äôs thoroughly thrilled about the match. It‚Äôs just late at night when he‚Äôs both alone and lonely that he feels the pang of regret and the sting of jealousy.
have suspected.  ‚ÄúI mean, just look at them.‚Äù He gestures toward the pair.  ‚ÄúThere should be cartoon hearts in their eyes.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, Phil, Mr. Stark has just stepped out to lunch. May I have him ring you when he returns?‚Äù She jots down another note on the pink pad and then says her good-byes.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs quiet.‚Äù Steve comments, crossing to the railing. The pool lights have only now flickered on below, giving the water a warm, aquamarine glow. They both stand in silence for a long minute, the time short but stretching. ‚ÄúYou can
‚ÄúI thought you weren‚Äôt interested.‚Äù Tony starts to look a little self-satisfied, so Steve dashes his hopes quickly.
‚ÄúWe can talk about something else then.‚Äù Tony leans back in his chair, crossing his arms over his chest. It reads as lazy, casual, rather than churlish. The rest of his body language is open and he keeps looking back at Steve as if he can‚Äôt be the first one to look away.
‚ÄúGot in around midnight, came straight here.‚Äù Tony tucks his head over Steve‚Äôs shoulder. His words are close, warm breath on Steve‚Äôs skin. There‚Äôs a tinge of bourbon there, but it‚Äôs faint. He must have had a drink to relax on the plane. Mostly, all Steve can smell is the comforting scent of Tony‚Äôs far-too-expensive cologne. ‚ÄúI almost didn‚Äôt wake you.‚Äù
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so," Natasha replies more calmly and Clint, who‚Äôd been staring fixatedly at the table, snaps his head toward her.  His eyes flare with unexpected heat.
Around day eight, Tony decides he needs to break the unspoken rule of minimal conversation.  Steve‚Äôs been sketching for four hours already and his presence is distracting.  Tony can‚Äôt focus when Steve‚Äôs only a few feet away, biting his lip as he concentrates on whatever he‚Äôs drawing.  He‚Äôd tried turning up the music to drive Steve out but it hadn‚Äôt seemed to register.
Bucky answers this by stepping into Steve‚Äôs embrace. He looks over Steve‚Äôs shoulder at Tony, and doesn‚Äôt waver in meeting the other man‚Äôs cold stare.
There‚Äôs a sense of acceptance in the kiss, as if Steve knows this is as close as he‚Äôll get to what he needs.
Steve musters up everything he‚Äôs got and climbs into the helicopter.  His body protests, muscles screaming.  His teeth cut into his bottom lip as he holds back a pained grunt.
‚ÄúWhy‚Äôd you hire her? I mean, she does that kind of stuff. It‚Äôs not exactly hard-boiled detective fare.‚Äù He points over his shoulder to the monster movie one-sheets, which make a lot more sense now that Tony knows his connection to them. They did seem a little low brow for a cinematographer of Bruce‚Äôs caliber.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm being serious ‚Äì just think of it ‚Äì the two of us on set, every day for weeks?‚Äù The corner of Tony‚Äôs mouth curls up in a delighted smirk.
‚ÄúBut you have an opinion, you always do.‚Äù  Tony turns fully to face him, stepping in closer so they can converse without straining to be heard over the din.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really fine, you guys.  You can say his name, he‚Äôs not Beetlejuice.‚Äù Steve tells them, holding back a tired sigh.  ‚ÄúNatasha has been staying at SHIELD headquarters for the past month in order to be with Bucky.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhere the hell did you come from?‚Äù  Tony looks around, startled.  Clint just winks at him and leans forward to help himself to a handful of popcorn.  Sam and Thor enter the room shortly after, far more obvious and loud.  Even when Thor tries to tone it down, it‚Äôs easy to hear the man coming.
Tony slips his hand slowly over Steve‚Äôs stomach to the elastic band of his boxers, fingertips daring to dip underneath and follow the faint trail of hair downward. Steve‚Äôs hips aren‚Äôt as wide now but they‚Äôre just as sharp, his body strangely muscular in the sense that he‚Äôs so thin that Tony can see and feel every angle and cut of sinew and bone under his pale skin.
‚ÄúAs much as I‚Äôm sure Sam would appreciate an upgrade, I was under the impression that your Iron Man tech was exclusive to you and Colonel Rhodes.‚Äù
Bucky works up to longer, deeper thrusts, but he doesn‚Äôt shove into him sharply, instead rolling his hips in this fantastic, languorous way that makes Steve‚Äôs whole body want to draw Bucky in closer. Unable to stop himself, his greedy hands find the muscled curve of Bucky‚Äôs ass, fingers digging in to warm skin as he feels every shift and flex as Bucky moves.
‚ÄúI was just gonna hop on the treadmill for a bit, give the ol‚Äô ticker a workout.‚Äù  Tony stands up, pushing the chair aside.  He stretches overdramatically.
‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to say I had the faintest idea about anything, Buck, but to be honest I‚Äôm probably more lost than anyone else.‚Äù
‚ÄúEh-eh,‚Äù Tony holds up a finger to cut him off as Happy picks up. ‚ÄúHappy, my good man! I knew you‚Äôd be there. Can you come around for Steve, please? Thanks, pal.‚Äù Tony drops his hand. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll be here shortly, soon as he wraps up that hand of poker he‚Äôs playing with the night watchman‚Äîthough he‚Äôll deny that to his grave, let me tell ya. Sorry, were you saying something?‚Äù
. ‚ÄúThis isn't the only place. Used to go down to the pier in Santa Monica a lot too; closest thing to Coney Island we could find when we were feeling homesick.‚Äù
‚ÄúPeople today pay good money to crush digital candy and raise make-believe animals on virtual farms, Stevie. I think good sense is a thing of the past.‚Äù
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean it like that.‚Äù  Steve‚Äôs frustrated, and Tony knows exactly how he feels.  He‚Äôd be better off banging his head against a wall.  ‚ÄúI know what Pepper means to you and I thought maybe if I could make her see ‚Äì‚Äù
He‚Äôd slumped over sideways in the night and he‚Äôs hugging one of the throw pillows against his chest.  Steve blinks slowly and sits up, taking a moment to remember where he is and why he‚Äôs there.  He rubs the back of his sore neck and looks up at Clint.
‚ÄúOh shit,‚Äù Tony swears, lunging forward to catch her in his arms. He grunts and staggers to support her. Having held her up himself, Steve knows she‚Äôs light, but she‚Äôs also soused and her body is dead weight. She‚Äôs doing none of the work to remain upright and standing. Jan‚Äôs peal of laughter is light and airy, seemingly unaware of the danger she put herself in, and she gazes up at Tony with a dreamy smile. She lifts one finger and taps him on the nose.
‚ÄúAll the same.‚Äù He‚Äôs too busy trying to arrange her safely between himself and the railing before he guides her down the stairs that he doesn‚Äôt realize someone else is already outside.
‚ÄúLast time I saw the ball drop in Times Square, it was 1941.  And now it‚Äôs 2014 and here I am, in New York again.‚Äù He looks back out over the city, still a little mystified over winding up here in this time.  Some days it really hits him how strange this all is, how awful and how wonderful.  Mostly wonderful.  He looks back down at Tony.  ‚ÄúFunny how things turn out.‚Äù
we need to worry about, and everyone knows that Daddy‚Äôs the one who really holds the purse strings. I‚Äôm gonna hit that bastard where it hurts.‚Äù
‚ÄúSure you haven‚Äôt.‚Äù Sam‚Äôs clearly not buying it, and both Clint and Natasha smirk to themselves.  Bruce‚Äôs attention is too obviously focused on his work, refusing to take part in speculation.
Steve shifts in his seat. He‚Äôs growing hard, right here, in the middle of the restaurant. As he moves, his leg brushes Tony‚Äôs. He hesitates for just a moment but then decides to let it rest there. He knows the signal that sends and right now, he wants to send it. He can feel Tony‚Äôs skin, warm against his own body, even through the fabric of their trousers.
With his slightly longer, darker hair and the full beard, Cap still doesn‚Äôt look quite like himself, but that deep, reassuring voice of his is the same.
They sit and listen as Sinatra fades into the Inkspots, minutes slipping by peacefully and without comment.
‚ÄúThank you, Bucky. For calling. I mean, I can imagine someone else would‚Äôve read a note like that and just went for it‚Ä¶it means a lot that you waited until you could talk to me.‚Äù
He‚Äôs in Tony‚Äôs space ‚Äì or Tony‚Äôs in his ‚Äì and all he‚Äôd need to do is lean in and they‚Äôd be kissing. Tony‚Äôs gaze dips to his mouth, then back up to meet his stare. Steve‚Äôs surprised by the desirous look in those beautiful brown eyes, startled by how positively electric the connection between them still is, despite Tony‚Äôs earlier cold shoulder.
Steve frowns at him, but Tony doesn‚Äôt regret it. Better to be blunt, or they‚Äôll end up miscommunicating and misunderstanding. They‚Äôd learned that early on in their relationship.
Tony ruts against Steve shamelessly, earning him a small, surprised gasp.  It shouldn‚Äôt be so hot that Steve still gets shocked when he feels Tony‚Äôs arousal, like he can‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs the one who can cause that reaction.
Steve tries to stop him there, grabbing Tony‚Äôs wandering hand before starting to speak, but Tony evidently has more points to make.
‚ÄúAh, yes, the name sounds vaguely familiar, I think Fury might have mentioned you in one of his ragey ramblings but I tend to drown those out if and when at all possible.  I‚Äôm guessing Fury told you to drop by?‚Äù
‚ÄúYou are‚Ä¶‚Äù Tony‚Äôs hard too, Steve can feel him rubbing against his thigh. ‚ÄúSo. God. Damn.‚Äù Tony‚Äôs hands smooth over his waist and down to his ass, grabbing and holding rather than quickly groping. ‚ÄúBeautiful.‚Äù
Bucky lets out a long, deep exhale and watches the cloud of smoke blow away on the wind. His breath, fogging in the cold December air, chases after it.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù  Just like that Tony‚Äôs inside and out the door before Steve can say another word, leaving him both dumbfounded and dazed.
‚ÄúIs this why you gave up Iron Man?‚Äù  For a second Tony hears judgment in Steve‚Äôs tone, criticism of his weakness.  But it‚Äôs not really there.  He simply sounds curious, concerned.
The stereotypical mysterious Russian spy, who was actually so soft at her core and he could have the best moments with her during sparring, movie nights or team dinners. Nat had been like the younger sister he wished he had had.
'I don't know what to tell you. I had to step up as a leader for the new group, while I didn't want to. I want to not be in the public eye for once and not have people getting suspicious of it, but that's just not going to happen, is it? I lost the majority of my friends and people want me to confidently lead this group I barely know. I just‚Ä¶ I hoped with this new armour‚Ä¶ maybe it's just really naive, but I just wanted to try to get rid of all this attention, focus and harsh criticism. I can't keep people around, except for you two and lord knows why you are still here, and everything I do just gets torn down, despite meaning it well. I just-... I just can't anymore! I just want to disappear for a while and I don't know, do something which feels good you know? I want to feel like that first time I flew in my armour, Mark ll.'
It felt good to have his friend matching with him and having him back flying by his side. Rhodey was determined to get Tony to enjoy flying again and Tony was determined to get Rhodey to enjoy flying again, maybe not healthy to deal with it like that, but hey, it worked.
Tony looked up at his two friends, the only two he would always look in the eyes and be honest with.
Tony was just going through some paperwork when the doors to his workshop opened and he felt a body collide against his back and one arm wrap around his waist grabbing a fistful of his shirt. He got the wind knocked out of him and when he turned around he saw Sam and Bucky standing in the door opening looking apologetic and sheepish.
'Don't worry about it genius, I would tell you if you hurt me. You know that, and you would have to squeeze real hard to hurt me, which you won't. You would notice and I'm sure the R&D department of SI with Peter and you isn't making anything that is the absolute best of quality. Let's go, okay?' Steve searched Tony eye for any signs he didn't want to. He didn't find it, so he pulled softly and they walked to the floor. Steve rubbed Tony's prosthetic arm softly, knowing the sensors would pick up such subtle touches, and he heard Tony sigh and lose some tension.
‚ÄúTony‚Ä¶don‚Äôt you think you‚Äôve done enough?  You don‚Äôt owe them anything.  You certainly don‚Äôt owe them your life.‚Äù
Steve Rogers. His hair is in disarray, his tie pulled loose and his shirt hopelessly rumpled, his suit jacket barely hanging off his shoulders. Even in the dark of the room, Tony can see the color high on Steve‚Äôs cheeks, the way his lips are red and swollen from both the force of their kisses and from biting back his moans. His pants and underwear are pooled around his ankles, covering his shoes. It should look silly, but his cock is still half-hard between his front shirttails and all Tony wants to do is get back on his knees.
Tony shifts onto his back in the aftermath, Steve resting his head on his shoulder and his hand splayed out across Tony‚Äôs chest. He traces patterns there still, the way he used to idly play with the shadows and light when the arc reactor was there.
mentoring someone?‚Äù Steve tilts his head toward Tony, then realizes he sounds oddly over-familiar. As far as everyone else is concerned, Tony‚Äôs the film‚Äôs producer, and Steve‚Äôs merely another actor. ‚ÄúMr. Stark.‚Äù He adds, far too belatedly.
‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶okay, I don‚Äôt know what just happened there.‚Äù  Clint shakes his head at his two friends; Tony knows he just kind of wandered off into a world that centered almost entirely on Steve, but he can‚Äôt be bothered to care.  ‚ÄúBut I can‚Äôt go either.  I was going to go check out the Rain Room at MoMA.  I think there‚Äôs an Oldenburg show too.‚Äù
Pepper has already reached into her purse and pulled out the glass bottle. She hands it to him. He takes it gratefully.
, more like, and Steve resists the feelings of shame and immodesty that start pricking under his skin as he‚Äôs laid out, bare and open, to Tony‚Äôs eyes. He squirms a little under Tony‚Äôs scrutiny, and Tony squeezes his knees as if to tell him to keep still.
‚ÄúNeed to see you.‚Äù Steve begs, attempting to twist in Tony‚Äôs embrace to switch their positions. Tony rolls Steve onto his back and haphazardly shoves their underwear down around their thighs, peeling off Steve‚Äôs first and then tugging down his own before laying his weight down on top of Steve. It‚Äôs not the smoothest they‚Äôve ever been, hurried and uncoordinated, but when his cock lines up next to Steve‚Äôs, Steve moans into his mouth like it‚Äôs perfect and Tony wouldn‚Äôt change a thing.
Steve gets up from his place beside Stark at the kitchen island, feet far enough from the floor now that he has to hop down from the bar stool. Bucky doesn‚Äôt miss how Stark‚Äôs hand trails down Steve‚Äôs rail thin arm as Steve moves a few steps away, like every possible second of contact has to be utilized. ‚ÄúTony, maybe you could ‚Äì‚Äù
‚ÄúLike this apartment is comforting?‚Äù  Tony raises an eyebrow.  Steve doesn‚Äôt reply but he visibly swallows hard, a shadow crossing over his face like a power source abruptly cutting out and then switching back on ‚Äì brief but very dark.
‚ÄúYou glad to be seeing the other side of this?‚Äù Sam asks, taking a short sip and raising his eyebrows at Steve over the rim of his glass. Steve takes a much longer drink, draining it near down to empty. Sam‚Äôs eyebrows climb higher. ‚ÄúOr maybe not?‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like running the gauntlet, isn‚Äôt it? But we made it out relatively unscathed.‚Äù A much too expensive bottle of wine is brought tableside without Tony placing an order; Tony foregoes a tasting and just signals the waiter to fill both their glasses. When the waiter departs, leaving them to their menus, Steve decides that it might be best to be frank now while they‚Äôre alone and the night is still early.
Tony opens the door to the walk-in closet and gestures for Steve to come inside.  Steve closes his gaping mouth and follows him.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it costs more than it should.‚Äù  Steve stops beside him, sliding his own card over.  ‚ÄúOn this, please, Miss." Tony looks from the small piece of plastic to Steve.
‚ÄúNo.  I used to think he was, though.  Before I met Steve.  Maybe even after.‚Äù   Tony shrugs, rubbing his face as he steps away from the window and from Pepper.  He needs another drink.
‚ÄúHave I argued any other way?‚Äù  He asks, glancing back, and Natasha offers a slight shrug in response.  ‚ÄúRight now, you‚Äôre what‚Äôs best for the situation.‚Äù
‚ÄúOkay boys, behave, we‚Äôre here.‚Äù  Tony interrupts as the doors open on Steve‚Äôs new art studio.  He steps out first, making a sweeping gesture toward the newly remodeled space.  ‚ÄúCheck it out, Rogers.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm going for a run.  Do you want to join me or not?‚Äù  Steve bluntly asks after the awkwardness stretches on too long and he‚Äôs faced with either standing here and staring at his own sneakers, or leaving.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs different though.  I got hijacked, taken out for a joyride, and returned not much worse for wear‚Ä¶comparatively.  I mean, I was under Loki‚Äôs control for less than a week ‚Äì your pal‚Äôs been in and out of commission for what, like, sixty, seventy years?  From what I‚Äôve gathered, his whole engine got rewired and most of his parts got swapped or replaced.  Kinda looks like the same car outside but inside‚Ä¶not so much.‚Äù
‚ÄúSorry, sorry,‚Äù Tony mumbles half-heartedly to Pepper as he practically crawls into the backseat of the Bentley. ‚ÄúOh god, it hurts.‚Äù He winces as he reluctantly takes off his sunglasses to read the headline of the paper that Pepper has thrust into his lap.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, Buck‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not.‚Äù  He admits, stopping himself as he goes to pat his friend on the knee, reminding himself not to touch.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm hard for you too,‚Äù Steve rocks against Tony, pre-come dripping to Tony‚Äôs lower back. Tony sighs like it‚Äôs the best thing he‚Äôs ever felt. ‚ÄúSo fucking hard, Tony.‚Äù
,‚Äù Steve sighs, wondering if he can possibly explain, or if he even wants to.  But Tony‚Äôs showing an interest and knowing Tony even as little as he does, he feels that should be rewarded for the effort with some small show of faith.
Someone works past them in the crowd, weaving their way down the train car and handing out flyers for the next March against Monsanto in Union Square.  Steve takes one, but Tony doesn‚Äôt look enthused.
‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs fine.‚Äù He‚Äôs pretty sure he‚Äôs not lying, but he guesses he‚Äôll find out for sure in a few days‚Äô time.
Bucky lets go of Tony and gets his hands on the backs of Steve‚Äôs knees, bending Steve‚Äôs large body in on itself. He slips his palms up Steve‚Äôs calves and wraps his fingers firmly around Steve‚Äôs heels. Bucky has ample leverage to lift Steve‚Äôs hips and spread him open; all Tony has to do is push forward and slide inside.
With his life on both coasts effectively wiped out, his suits of armor destroyed and his chest free and clear of both the arc reactor and shrapnel, Tony should feel like his slate is wiped clean.
‚ÄúMark my words, Steve ‚Äì the guy thinks he‚Äôs gonna be the next Selznick and you remember what happened last time Selznick came around. Getting through the
As Tony steps out of his clothes and climbs onto the bed, Bucky slides his hand down between Steve‚Äôs legs, a single finger pushing in.  These two are all action and no talk, which surprises Tony quite a bit even though it makes sense in retrospect, all things considered. Secret relationships conducted in wartime probably weren‚Äôt conducive to long chats and extended interludes. Their circumstances have changed considerably now, but Tony supposes habits are habits.
‚ÄúI think I‚Äôve made it pretty clear that I‚Äôm up for a threesome,‚Äù Tony replies, laughing lightly. ‚ÄúI‚Äòm thinking that‚Äôs not what you mean, exactly.‚Äù
‚ÄúNo, do it, fuck my mouth,‚Äù Tony gets his hands on either side of Steve‚Äôs ass and urges him back in.
‚ÄúWhen he became Captain America, everyone finally saw what I saw. He could finally‚Ä¶Steve could have the life he‚Äôd always wanted. There was Peggy and now there‚Äôs
After throwing away the evidence of his less-than gentlemanly activities, he opens the door once more.
He doesn‚Äôt know who it is on the roof of the office building across from Avengers Tower. He doesn‚Äôt know who is laying flat on the cement, loaded gun propped on the ledge and ready to fire.
He jerks toward her and sloshes orange juice over the counter.  He quickly sets the bottle down and grabs a rag, mopping up the mess while trying to think of an appropriate response.  One that doesn‚Äôt involve telling Pepper she‚Äôs gone insane.
Nevertheless, he can‚Äôt stop himself from liking Clint best, so he falls into step beside him and doesn‚Äôt say a word as Natasha leads them to some hole-in-the-wall dive bar off of Tillary.
‚ÄúA heads up would‚Äôve been nice.‚Äù Tony comments as he lets the fridge door slam.  He cracks open the water, glaring at the other man as he takes a drink.  ‚ÄúThis
‚ÄúI think I do,‚Äù Steve admits aloud for the first time. Though he‚Äôs known it for a while, it‚Äôs still kind of a revelation. ‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶I think‚Ä¶‚Äù He screws up the courage and finds the words. ‚ÄúI want Bucky to make me come while I‚Äôm looking in your eyes. God, Tony. I‚Ä¶I want you to hold me, and touch me, while he fucks me. Does that make me
‚ÄúYou know, this time, last year, I was in China with Natasha, chasing after the Winter Soldier, not even aware I was really chasing Bucky.‚Äù  Steve speaks first, walking closer to the railing in an unspoken invitation for Tony to join him.
He sets his hands on Steve‚Äôs shoulders and forces himself to look Steve in the eyes. What he finds there is a mixture of panic and anger. He presses on despite it, knowing it‚Äôs for the best.
"Sure we could.  But we could also go to Delmonico's, get a decadent dinner with huge, juicy steaks and the highest of high end scotch, take in a show, maybe go dancing ourselves..."
Across from him, Nick sighs in frustration and wipes the bar top down as if Steve‚Äôs no longer sitting there.
‚ÄúOh, did he now. Could you send that over?‚Äù Her phone buzzes almost immediately and she takes it away from her ear, clicking on something and then nodding once to herself. She returns to her phone call. ‚ÄúI see.‚Äù Pause. ‚ÄúNo, this is the first I‚Äôve heard of it. It certainly is very enlightening and clarifies quite a few things on my end.‚Äù Another pause. ‚ÄúYes. Let me confer with Mr. Stark about that matter, and I will have him get back to you shortly.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou might be less excited once you discover how Fitzgerald is being interpreted in the twenty-first century, Cap.‚Äù
Clint and Sam turn away from Bruce‚Äôs departing figure, glancing at each other and then at Steve and Bucky.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not‚Äî‚Äú Tony gets up, pacing the length of the airplane cabin. He doesn't know how to make Pepper understand this, and he shouldn't have to, but here he is trying anyway. But he supposes if this thing with Steve and Bucky works out, he's going to have to get used to explaining; very few people are going to look on this situation with approval. ‚ÄúLook. Steve and I had a conversation, in which we decided that he and Bucky needed to have their own conversation. And I just‚Ä¶I wanted to let Bucky know in advance that I was okay with that conversation happening, so they‚Ä¶didn‚Äôt need to stop mid-conversation to loop me in. So I know that they might be‚Ä¶
Tony smirks at him. "Just be glad I'm not in the mood for 3D models." Bucky lets out a choked off laugh. "Ok, come here." Bucky obliges, and Tony rolls the short sleeve of his shirt up to get a better look at his shoulder. He would've preferred the shirt left off, but he was trying for good impressions here. "You did some serious work here, pal. I don't think I ever got the full story." Tony looks up at him, a bit expectantly.
Bucky nods, looking a bit bewildered. "C'mon terminator, I had my robots clear out a floor for you," Tony says, leading Bucky around them. Steve's gut twists. He didn't know why, but it felt like loosing both of them.
It's a real, honest to god laugh that escapes his lips this time. "Aw come on, aren't you going to get all sad and thank me for my service," he teases, bumping Tony's arm with his own.
Tony blows him a kiss as he walks off, and Peter scrunches his nose, saying something that Tony probably deems disrespectful, given the look on his face right before Steve turns away. He walks to the back corner, pushing through clumps of mingling people, where there was a door with a sign that Steve knew without needing to read said "Wedding party only... and also Tony Stark. Hi Tony." In fact, Tony wasn't actually supposed to be back there, but Sam has insisted after Tony RSVPd to the event. After all, how many people have billionaires come to their wedding.
"Duh." The song comes to an end, and one starts up that Steve most certainly knew all the words to. I Wanna Dance with Somebody, was in his personal list of all time favorites. He's pleasantly surprised to learn that Peter also knows all the words. "Peter, I wouldn't expect you to jam to Whitney Houston."
"He put you in the river!" Tony roars, turning back on him with a finger pointed straight at Steve's chest. "And he killed my mom. An unknown number of political enemies. Innocents. Civilians! He's not the kind of man you save, Steve, he's the kind you lock away!"
"Steve, thank god your back," Nat says, about to step into another door with a pile of boxes in her arms. She halts and Steve walks up to her. "Bucky is having a little anxiety, and we don't want Sam to know cuz duh. Go talk to him," she says quietly.
"I'm serious, you don't have to do anything." Tony says, leaning against Steve side on his phone while Steve stared at the paused tv screen.
"Lunch then," Nat agrees, walking purposefully towards the SHIELD cafeteria. There was already a table set for four with two extra chairs for Howard and Peggy. For the most part, the facility was shut down entirely, so there was little chance of interruption. Steve jr sits next to Bucky and Nat sits across from him. The two of them do most of the story telling this time around, Steve only butting in to add that Tony was currently almost 2 in this reality.
But the number was spelled out correctly under the name, addressed to Star Bakery. Steve would've been fine with no payment after the way he acted but this.. this was far from what he had expected.
Tony walks up to the couch, holding two bowls of reheated spaghetti. Steve takes it, watching as Tony plops down onto the couch next to him. "They're not wrong there. Very kind of me. I think I should get an award."
"That's what Loki would‚ÄîNatasha?" His eyes land on Nat and dart between Steve and her. "Are you okay?" He says, apparently aware of the fact that she is still on the ground, clutching her chest.
A chorus of congratulations and compliments erupts and severally hugs occur. Tony stays silent, just staring at the photo with his head on Steve's shoulder, which happened to keep Steve exactly where he was.
"Of course." Steve feels the smile firmly on his face through the rest of his shift, overjoyed at the prospect of two of his best friends finally getting hitched.
"I'm not... Steve, I'm not what you want," she says suddenly, pulling her forehead away from his suddenly. Steve furrows his brows, but before he can get a word out, she continues. "I can't.. they sterilized me in the red room. I can never give you the life you deserve‚Äî"
He was a celebrity, which Steve had been polite about up until now, but there was no telling what he would do now. Tony could see the tabloids now, TONY STARK FORCES HIMSELF ONTO STRAIGHT MAN. It wasn't exactly true, but they never really were. His feet splash against wet concrete as he walks out to his car parked at the end of the street. He unlocks it and slumps into the drivers seat, setting the cake box on the other seat. Dazzling blue eyes swim in his thoughts, crinkled with the lines of happiness.
The elevator doors slide open and they walk into the small compartment side by side.  He smirks to himself as he notices Steve standing at soldier‚Äôs ease, feet a shoulder width apart and hands folded behind his back.  Tony lounges against the wall lazily and lets Steve feel him looking.
It took Tony to see it, to realize it, and even then it probably never would have happened if he hadn‚Äôt lost the serum. Staring in the mirror at his old self forced him to look long and hard at what exactly he‚Äôd left behind.
‚ÄúNot the faintest, sport.‚Äù  He looks out the window as Happy smoothly navigates the car around Columbus Circle and glides down 8th.   Tony‚Äôs jaw tenses again, teeth grinding.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not‚Ä¶why would you even‚Ä¶‚Äù Bucky starts, and Tony chuckles, bitter and not at all amused.  That sets the other man off.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt want to talk about Natasha right now,‚Äù Steve mutters, twisting at something that Tony can tell didn‚Äôt need to be tightened.  He wonders if Steve has the faintest clue what he‚Äôs doing.  He bends down next to him, eyeing the machinery.  He pushes up his sleeves.
Steve runs a hand through his sweat-drenched hair and glances down at the floor.  His cheeks are surprisingly flushed.  Tony wonders exactly how hard and how long a man enhanced with super serum has to work out before he sweats like this.  Steve‚Äôs white t-shirt clings to his chest, droplets of perspiration clinging to his biceps and dripping from his face.
Beside Thor, Sam struggles valiantly to keep a straight face and Steve widens his eyes at his friend in warning, telling him to keep it together.
When Steve turns from the shower, deciding to wait for the water to warm, he comes face-to-face with his own reflection in the mirror of the medicine cabinet above the sink. What he sees is startling.
‚ÄúVery.‚Äù Tony moves in first for the kiss this time, still smiling as their lips brush.  Tony‚Äôs teasing, promising more and then easing back until it‚Äôs more like they‚Äôre sharing breath than kissing.  The playfulness gives way to something dangerously passionate when Steve finally slips his hands into the back pockets of Tony‚Äôs jeans and urges their bodies together.  He doesn‚Äôt even care that they‚Äôre not alone, that anyone can see.  This isn‚Äôt 1940, and this isn‚Äôt Bucky.
‚ÄúBecause when your best friend plummets to his death at the bottom of a snowy mountain ravine, it tends to stick with you.‚Äù  Steve says, a bit sharply.  He knows that Tony
‚ÄúIn the end, I'm afraid pursuing anything with Agent Carter would be leaning less toward nice and more toward creepy."
‚ÄúWe‚Äôd agreed that we were dropping playboy from that string of epithets, didn‚Äôt we? I remember having that conversation. ‚ÄòPepper, I need to focus on the work. Pepper, I need to be taken seriously. Pepper‚Äô‚Äì‚Äù
how it goes when these East Coast moneybags roll into town, Steve. They have no creativity, no inspiration, no idea how to make a decent picture. They just want a piece of the Hollywood pie and to see their name up on the big screen so they can brag to the young broads they want to trick into replacing their old wives. They got no idea how to be actual producers, all they do is get in the way.‚Äù
‚ÄúTony,‚Äù Steve sighs, going boneless in his arms as Tony rocks underneath him. Tony‚Äôs growing hard, his erection already obscenely slipping free through the front flap of his boxers, and he can already see the outline of Steve‚Äôs thickening cock underneath the cotton of his sweatpants.
There‚Äôs a beat of silence and surprise as everyone realizes Bucky‚Äôs joined in, causing a hiccup in the rhythm of the conversation, but Steve quickly recovers.
Clint spends the majority of the car ride alternating between iterations of ‚ÄúI love you, man,‚Äù and ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a good guy, Steve,‚Äù occasionally reaching out a hand and pinching him on the cheek like someone‚Äôs soused grandmother.  Natasha leans her head against the window and closes her eyes, a faint smile on her face.
‚ÄúTony‚Ä¶‚Äù Steve gasps, and then his eyes roll back into his head, his mouth falling open in a moan that chokes off.  ‚ÄúOh god, oh god, oh
‚ÄúAnd?‚Äù Steve prompts, bending down out of sight to pull on his trousers. When he comes back up, Tony still hasn't answered. ‚ÄúIf you're regretting casting me, I can only say I told you so.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs part of it. But only part of it.‚Äù Steve tilts his head, pulling back to look up at Tony, finally. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be an
‚ÄúSteve,‚Äù Tony breathes, somehow unprepared for the sight of him looking so perfect in this casual nothing of a moment.   He‚Äôs dressed for bed, and these days that means he‚Äôs barely dressed at all.  No more oversized grandpa pajama sets; just a pair of low slung pants sitting loose on his slim hips.  Tony rakes his gaze over Steve‚Äôs broad shoulders and down his bare chest to his stomach, following the light barely there trail of hair down to the half-untied drawstring of his pants.  It doesn‚Äôt seem like he‚Äôs wearing anything underneath.
‚ÄúHuh.  Then I suppose it‚Äôs not pointless after all.‚Äù  He grins and ducks inside before drying off, dripping all over the plush carpet.  Pepper huffs.  He grants the pond a reprieve, popping back to glance over Pepper‚Äôs shoulder and waving toward it like its been forgiven. ‚ÄúAll right, you can stay.‚Äù
Steve looks away as Tony slides an arm around his waist to pull him closer, a proprietary move that he always uses if Bucky is around.  When they hang with his best friend, Tony has to find a way to touch whenever possible, as if constantly both assuring himself and warning Bucky.  Tony insists he is above jealousy ‚Äì far too aloof and cool for such trivial nonsense ‚Äì but it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that ever since he found out that Steve and Bucky had briefly fooled around in high school during a period of shared bi-curiousness, he becomes pretty grabby when Buck‚Äôs there.
Nick Fury, Maria Hill and Phil Coulson had returned as the leaders of the Avengers, new and old. Those three had collectively decided to send Tony and Steve, together, on a stealth mission. Tony suspected some conspiring between the three and the others from the Avengers team. Steve had looked apologetically and guilty but he did not hesitate to agree to the mission.
The bartender just gave Steve his cocktail when Tony appeared at his side. Steve grabbed his drink and took a swig.
‚ÄúAfter lunch, it‚Äôs no infection. Sam told me it could be phantom pain.‚Äù Steve told him when he had calmed down a little. Steve was clasping the residual limb, it got amputated above the elbow.
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go on Sunday, okay?‚Äù Tony asked softly with the fondest smile on his face Steve had ever seen.
"All those fat cats, they exhaust me. It's nice to have the Avengers, Rhodey, and Pepper close by though. Way more bearable than SI gala's." Tony took a swig from his glass and leaned against the bar giving Steve his full attention in that way which made him feel completely exposed. Those damn big brown piercing eyes, they saw everything it seemed.
And, Bruce and Thor. He missed those two a lot. Ever since Ultron he hadn't seen those two. Tony knew Bruce needed his space so he wasn't tracking him. He missed playing around with Bruce in the lab and going for the impossible. Bruce wasn't scared, as most assumed. He was shy, but not with Tony. They knew they would never hurt each other, their mutual respect was too big to ever let that happen. They would protect each other and defend each other‚Äôs points, Bruce a little more from the sideline, while Tony was loud and vocal about it.
Bruce and Steve were the outsiders in this case. Bruce felt too uncomfortable talking about donating money, talking about science was fine but he still seemed to want to run home to the tower.
Steve had just settled into his bedroom when he heard the way too familiar clang of metal. He looked outside and saw that Tony had landed on the landing platform. He saw Tony tap the arc reactor and the armour peeled off of him in the most captivating way, it felt like intruding on someone, who was very vulnerable, taking off their mask and revealing how they really felt. All Steve saw was an extremely exhausted man, like everything ached. Someone who was in need of relief of all that pain and just didn't know where to search for it anymore. A man who had accepted the permanent pain as just a side-effect of life.
Tony's cheeks turned a little red and Steve felt like he succeeded in life, he made Tony feel flustered. Maybe he could do this without making a mess?
So here they were, a Wednesday night, Tony had retreated to his bedroom and so had Steve. The walls were thin, however, so they could hear each other as if they were in the same bedroom and that was unnerving. Tony had forgotten to take his anxiety medication this morning and felt a panic attack creeping upon him. He tried to inhale through his nose and exhale through his mouth for half an hour and in the end, he did felt better and after another half an hour he nodded off.
'Let's get some drinks!' Bucky pulled away from Sam, shot him a bright smile and grabbed Steve's jacket and walked straight to the bar. He ordered their favourite drinks. Steve and Bucky couldn't get drunk so they got mocktails and Sam got a simple coca cola with Bacardi in it.
Tony had this gut feeling that something was wrong. He did not know what to expect though. The base seemed desolate, it was on the side of a mountain, a mix of royal and sober-looking floors, hidden away from civilian life and no obvious arrival routes to it. It was hidden by the forest surrounding it. The atmosphere was plain unnerving. Steve was doing surveillance from the ground, as best as he could with no roads, and Tony from at air with help from Friday.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll get you a glass of water.‚Äù He heard Steve whisper and then heard his footsteps leaving his room. Tony zoned out a for minute focusing on himself and grounding himself. The tips from his therapist had helped a little at times like this.
Tony found some odd energy waves coming from the base. Before he got to warn Steve he heard gunshots and explosions.
Tony nodded and closed his eyes for a minute, letting his head lean against Steve's shoulder. He slipped his hands around Steve's tiny waist and settled his hands on Steve's lower back.
‚ÄúHey, sweetheart, what‚Äôs going on? Everyone is here in the tower, we‚Äôre fine. Did you have a nightmare?‚Äù
‚ÄúIt would be an honour.‚Äù Steve smiled, feeling positively hopeful and actually happy in ages. He took Tony‚Äôs offered hand and thoroughly enjoyed the rest of the evening with Tony, drinks, and talking to other people.
He just wished it did the same for the deep ache in him which longed for a friendly touch, some encouraging and comforting words. He pushed those feelings rapidly to the side, there was no space or time to grief or pity himself for messing up another friendship.
'Close your mouth Steve or you'll catch flies.' Tony said while sauntering over to him. Tony took off his glasses and smiled up at Steve.
After their dinner, they went up to the penthouse, showered together, Tony helped Steve change the compression dressing for his arm, pulled clean shirts on and went to lay in bed. While softly kissing, Tony told about his day. Occasionally Steve tensed up with a new wave of pain coursing through him, Tony comforted as best as he could and eventually they had fallen asleep. Tony thinking about a possible service dog, a prosthetic arm and that he needed to speak to Bruce about making the phantom pain manageable.
Steve had just taken a sip from his drink and almost coughed it straight up, luckily his freaky strong control on himself prevented that.
‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm fine. Just go to bed, we have another two days of this mission and then we can both go our own way again.‚Äù
It was nine months after the battle against Thanos and his army, nine months after they obliterated the villain and his immense army, nine months after Tony snapped with the six Infinity Stones. Steve still could not believe he was standing here, in a brand-new velvet suit, at the gala to celebrate that they had won and repaired the damage done. Everyone who battled those nine months ago was here as well, even Natasha who had sacrificed herself at Vormir thinking she would not return. Steve had returned the Soul Stone and The Red Skull had granted Steve the option to get one person back and Natasha had returned as Steve had wished.
'I love you platypus.' He kissed the taller man's cheek and wrapped his arms around the man's waist. Tony tucked his face into Rhodey's neck and took some deep breaths. He felt another pair of arms wrapping around him from the back, Pepper, and a soft kiss on his shoulder blade. It soothed the deep ache for a few minutes and he was so grateful to have his two guardian angels still with him, but god, did he miss his other friends.
‚ÄúThanks, Pep. I‚Äôll definitely do some research into that and yeah, we‚Äôll be alright, just going to take a while.‚Äù Tony sighed.
‚ÄúHonestly, no problem. Kinda my job as a ‚Äúfuturist‚Äù to help you, right?‚Äù Tony looked happily at him.
The Metal Crusader, that's what Tony named the new armour standing in front of him. It was past midnight and eerily quiet in the compound. The Rogues were somewhere in Asia, Tony compulsively checked in on all of them, Jarvis, Pepper and Rhodey would disapprove, but Jarvis wasn't here anymore, Pepper was on the West Coast and Rhodey was on an army base in the USA, not near the compound at least. So there he was, sleep-deprived, lonely, angry and he just finished his finest armour. Nanotechnology coming from the core of an arc reactor, a sleek vantablack armour. New armoury, a shield, new more powerful repulsors and another helmet just in case the other gets bashed off. "Thanks for that feedback, Rogers" Tony thought bitterly.
They then went to grab some food and talked about all the mistakes they had made themselves looking back at the situation. For the first time Tony opened up to someone who wasn't his therapist about the vision Wanda had shown him and the following disaster of it all and Steve opened up about him still feeling disconnected despite all the tries from his friends and when it finally seemed to work Peggy had died, Bucky had appeared, Ultron happened and then the Accords resulting in the airport fight and Siberia's bunker fight. Steve apparently thought of himself not being worthy of happiness and that was where Steve and he seemed to connect the strongest.
Tony had felt bad about it until Pepper had pulled him along to the two meetings. They had eaten lunch together in his office, Pepper trying her hardest to distract him from thinking about Steve. She had gone to the bathroom and when she returned pulled him out of his stupor when the door closed a little harsh.
So, the gala. S.H.I.E.L.D. had organized it and all six Avengers were at the gala. There were many wealthy women and men walking around, drinking, eating, talking, and occasionally dancing to the tunes of the live band. Tony seemed very fluent in talking to the wealthy and getting them to gift money. So did Natasha, Clint, and Thor. Natasha and Clint were spies and extremely good in getting information from others, so that didn't surprise Steve at all. Thor just had this powerful aura around him, he was a God after all and prince of Asgard, so royalty. People, literally but also figuratively, looked up to him. And Tony grew up with going to gala‚Äôs and learned it from a young age.
The jet landed and out stepped the seven. If Tony hadn't been prepared for all kinds of shock or awkwardness he would have ceased to exist right there.
Steve grunted an agreement and swiftly Tony swept the taller man up and away, protecting him from the flying knives.
Tony took Steve to the dance floor and put his arm in the position so Tony could lead Steve. Steve appreciated that since he still couldn't dance, besides the several steps he learned from his mum and Bucky. Slowly Steve picked up on the steps and the rhythm.
‚ÄúNo, no, don‚Äôt worry. I was just thinking about...you know? It‚Äôs been a rough few weeks. The distraction is nice and all, I‚Äôm glad to be back doing what I love, but it just hit me what happened I guess?‚Äù Tony explained. Pepper sat down on his desk and took his hand and squeezed it softly.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a great beginning. I like the sound of Partner in crime more, although that suggests we would be the bad guys, which, obviously, we‚Äôre not.‚Äù Tony rambled on, while Steve changed the positions of his hands in the pose he wanted. He slid his right hand to Tony‚Äôs shoulder and grabbed Tony‚Äôs right hand, so they were standing in the classic ballroom position.
‚ÄúNo, wait, Steve, I didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù Steve felt Tony‚Äôs hand clasp the sleeve of his velvet suit. Steve looked over his shoulder at Tony and felt his heart speed up when he saw how expressive and open Tony looked. The light was enhancing his already flawless face and styled facial hair. It took Steve‚Äôs breath away for a minute.
‚ÄúHey Steve, come on, let‚Äôs rearrange so I can finish all these little tasks. I‚Äôll sit in your lap, okay?‚Äù
"Hey, having a good evening?‚Äù Steve asked. Tony slid his glasses into his breast-pocket and ordered a whiskey.
‚ÄúHow was today?‚Äù Tony asked while laying them on the couch. Tony half-sitting, half-laying on his back, with Steve half on top of him, his arm wrapped around Tony‚Äôs hips and ear pressed to Tony‚Äôs chest so he could hear his heartbeat. Tony started rubbing Steve‚Äôs back when he felt the tears soak his shirt.
And Steve, he was drinking silently, alone, on the side of the venue. He missed Bucky and Peggy enormously at that moment. Having either of them at his side would have been such a relief, they were both determined and charming. They were always so sure of themselves it seemed and that comforted Steve, which he could use at that moment, but they weren‚Äôt with him, hence the drink. He chugged the rest of the cocktail and walked to the bar to order another one. He looked around and made eye contact with Tony. The man was wearing a grey three-piece suit with dark red accents. He looked breathtaking and that was an understatement. Steve had been studying his movements so he could draw him later tonight in one of his many sketchbooks.
'Thank you, Steve. Yes, I am- I mean, we are allowed to enjoy ourselves. No guilt and we're safe.' Whispered Tony against the soft black velvet of Steve's jacket. Tony didn‚Äôt sound so sure but at least he tried to convince himself.
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to pity me, Tony. I‚Äôll just go now‚Ä¶‚ÄùSteve trailed off and walked away towards the bar again.
‚ÄúYes, I am sure, otherwise I would not have invited you.‚Äù Tony looked at him earnestly with his big, Bambi-like, eyes.
Tony had to return to his work at some point though. Which was today, an arbitrary Tuesday, stocked with meetings. He had arrived at 8.30 am and he had had two other meetings already. When he left in the morning Steve had clung to him as if he was his lifeline. Bucky and Sam had arrived several minutes later so they could distract Steve, leaving him alone was the worst possible plan, so there they were. They had planned to make a big breakfast, lunch and dinner together and watch some movies. They also offered to do some stretching exercises with Steve. Tony wondered if that had succeeded knowing how passive and stubborn Steve had become. Bucky had held Steve back from running after his boyfriend and Sam had pushed Tony out the door before he would succumb to the kicked puppy-eyes from Steve, which were shining with tears.
at the moment.‚Äù  Pepper rubs her forehead, leaving her bangs in slight disarray.  She‚Äôs been holding her briefcase in her other hand and now she lets it drop to the ground, her shoulders sagging.
Steve works him through the aftershocks, going until Tony‚Äôs entire body is trembling and every thrust makes him gasp.  Steve starts to pull out, still hard, but Tony reaches back and grabs his ass, shoves him back in.
‚ÄúI still have the photograph,‚Äù Jane grins, and then gasps, looking back to where her husband stands in the living room, gesturing wildly as he regales Bucky with some crazy story from his youth. ‚ÄúMaybe Thor
you hated me back then.‚Äù Bucky smirks, nodding his head back toward where Steve is safely ensconced indoors. ‚ÄúThat punk never believed me.‚Äù
The lights come up low, illuminating the screening room softly. They‚Äôve been locked in the darkness for so long that even this seems offensively bright. Tony squints uncomfortably as his eyes adjust.
He does that now, kissing and licking his way from behind Bucky‚Äôs ear down the curve of his throat to the sharp line of his collarbone, his eager hands tugging and stretching the collar of Bucky‚Äôs cotton tee. Bucky‚Äôs plaid shirt is already hanging off his shoulders, half-down to his elbows. Steve considers tugging it all the way off, but he doesn‚Äôt want to rush things, doesn‚Äôt want to push too far, too fast.
Getting closer, Tony realizes the man is asleep, or doing a good impression of it. He knocks the man‚Äôs leather work boot with the polished toe of his Oxfords.
Part of him wants to hear Steve scream when he realizes what‚Äôs happened. That while he‚Äôd been in the throes of passion, his lover had been killed right in front of him and there had been nothing he could do to stop it. That he hadn‚Äôt even seen it coming.
He has hacked into their comms and the one who speaks is the one they call Iron Man.  Iron Man is the only one deployed alongside the Captain at the moment, making this assassination job easier than originally planned.
Steve sighs heavily and moves toward the pair. It‚Äôs really not his business, but Tony seems displeased and he knows Scott must be down to his last nerve.
‚ÄúI won‚Äôt leave you like this, Tony.  Not now.  I‚Äôm here until we bring Steve home, safe and sound.‚Äù  Pepper rubs the side of his arm gently.  A single tear slips down her cheek, a mere prelude to more.  ‚ÄúBut when he‚Äôs back‚Ä¶I‚Äôm going to need some time away.‚Äù
Tony takes a moment to consider before shaking.  Sam‚Äôs a bit shorter than Steve but just as built, and he seems bright, flashy and slightly insincere.  He‚Äôs also wearing a NY Jets jersey, which, just‚Ä¶no.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still alive,‚Äù Tony points out, but Steve doesn‚Äôt reply.  Tony sighs and drums his fingers against the edge of his plate, then drops an elbow to the counter, resting his head against his hand.  He tries to switch back to a casual tone, like he‚Äôs gently poking fun. ‚ÄúHate to say it, Cap, but you almost sounded cynical just then.‚Äù
"You know, I think the team was conspiring this plan to get us to talk and I think they'll be celebrating it."
After several minutes Tony seemed to release the tension in his body. He sucked in air desperately. He slumped against the headboard and dropped his head in his hands.
He dressed in some blue skinny jeans, a black sabbath short-sleeved shirt and a grey sweater. He shuffled into the kitchen where Rhodey handed him a glass of water and pointed at one of the chairs at the dining table, a cup of coffee stood next to a plate with a sandwich with scrambled eggs and a bowl of yoghurt with cranberries on top and some syrup.
‚ÄúCome on Steve, you‚Äôre crushing your boyfriend and you need to breathe as well. Come on, let go for a minute.‚Äù Bucky had pulled softly, trying to avoid actually hurting him even more.
