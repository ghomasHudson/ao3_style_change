And what a magnificent body it was.  Those elegant red-tipped fingers that poked out from beneath the sheet lay next to a face made angelic by sleep (John knew exactly just how devilish that face could be when conscious).  Eyelashes gently resting against cheekbones any catwalk model would pay for.  The mouth a glorious, pouty bow, still faintly stained with rouge paint.  John took a deep breath to relax but he could already feel how just glancing at his lover was affecting his heretofore happily slumbering shaft.
Sherlock looked searchingly at his love’s face.  John smiled steadily back at him, offering reassurance.  Whatever he was looking for he must have seen it because he hopped down from the ledge and moved around to gently remove the toy and press his groin to John’s arse.  He placed his hands on John’s legs and rubbed some feeling back into them.  He stood lightly in the water, letting the bubbles bounce and jostle him against John.  The free feeling of the water caressing their bodies was exquisite.  He reached down and gave himself a couple of good strokes and lined himself up with John.  He suddenly felt a bit afraid of the moment, like he might bugger it all up.  He hesitated and looked up at John.  John was looking at him intently.  As he watched, frozen, John reached out one hand to him.  He placed his palm on John’s wrist in a monkey grip and as they held each other, he slowly pressed inside John and Sherlock felt an unfurling deep within.  That was it for him.  He was utterly taken.  Forever.
John straightened and stepped in close directly behind Sherlock.  The heels on his boots gave him a little more height than he'd normally have in this position, and he could hear Sherlock panting as he rested his right cheek on Sherlock's left shoulder.  He slid his right hand around Sherlock's hip until it splayed against his belly and the crease where belly met thigh.  He placed firm pressure there, pushing Sherlock's plump arse back against his groin.
Sherlock fidgeted in his chair and turned back to his microscope.  “Don’t be stupid, John.  If I wanted some of your semen I’d hardly have to ask for it.”
John had been staring so hard at himself in the mirror, so wrapped up in feeling out of place in the very tailored, very fashionable clothes Sherlock had left on his bed, that he had completely missed the fact that Sherlock himself was dressed to kill.  Skin tight, midnight blue, arse-hugging jeans ending in boots that look so expensive John can only imagine how many people worked on them by hand.  Polished to a deep burnish, the leather hugs his feet lovingly.  The tips are covered in pointed metal toes studded with spikes, while chains hang in loops between the top eyelet and the centre-back of the heel.  When Sherlock lifts his foot to pivot into the bathroom John spies a traditional Japanese samurai image embedded in the sole in colour.  How expensive do shoes have to be to have patterns burned into the bloody sole?!
“Alright,” John promised, but his expression changed completely when he eventually scrolled through the text. He read it a second time to make sure he wasn’t too pissed to just see what his eyes wanted him to see. “Oh, sweetheart… I’m so sorry,” John choked out and pulled Sherlock closer against him with his free hand. “I know what this must’ve looked like to you, but I love you. I’d never…
“Remember when you said that Lestrade can manage the case on his own? You might want to take that back now.”
“Yes, sir,” Sherlock breathed. He was thankful that John helped him yet again to get into position. Moving gracefully with his wrists cuffed together behind his back was not as easy as he had thought it would be. Sherlock sighed when the plug shifted inside of him and nudged against his prostate with the changing posture.
The shorter man leant forward and kissed Sherlock affectionately until he began to calm down a bit. “I’m glad you told me that you’re rather concerned about the entirety of the relationship than the kink itself. But I’m afraid we’ll have to talk about either.”
It was the only possible explanation for all those questions. Other than the crying, John had had no reason to assume that he’d pushed his limits. Sherlock felt safe, respected and cared for when they were playing. He couldn’t imagine wanting to play with anyone else anymore, even though they still had to find the right balance in their dynamics.
John brushed his thumb over Sherlock’s cheeks to wipe the tears away, then moved his hand to Sherlock’s hair and gently caressed the sweaty curls. After a while, John assessed that Sherlock was calm enough to go on with the scene. “Do you still remember the instructions I gave you?”
“Strip,” John commanded and closed the bedroom door behind them. The army doctor stripped down to his pants as well, revelling in the reaction they provoked from his lover.
John stretched and slowly got out of bed, careful not to wake his boyfriend. During-case-naps were few and far between and much more important than Sherlock would ever admit. He snatched his mobile from the bedside table and checked for any new messages from Lestrade – fortunately, there were none.
Sherlock felt like he was on the verge of tears. He had disappointed John with his disobedience. He’d never felt bad about it with other doms, but John was the last person to deserve this. John loved him, he cared about him, cared enough to remind him of his safeword before the scene. Sherlock swallowed the feeling down before it could get the better of him and quickly locked the door. He had no idea how long John would need to choose all the items, so he stripped as hastily as possible and knelt down on the soft carpet between the fireplace and the coffee table.
you!” Sherlock huffed in mock-annoyance and managed to bite back a low moan when John’s warm, wet lips caressed only the very tip of his throbbing cock. Both of them knew that if John kept things light and slow, Sherlock wouldn’t be coming anytime soon.
Sherlock turned around and gave John an affectionate kiss. When they broke the kiss, he looked squarely into John’s eyes. “You like taking care of me,” he announced matter-of-factly.
“Same as usual, John?” Greg asked already heading for the counter and John nodded in approval. He didn’t normally drink alcohol as a Dom (it wasn’t worth the time he had to wait till he was completely sober again for the next session), but he assumed he and Sherlock weren’t going to play anytime soon…
“Why else would I be here?” Sherlock retorted and slipped on his usual mask of aloofness. He decided to let nothing on about his thoughts or the fact that they had nothing to do with the case.
Sherlock swallowed and took a deep breath before he opened his eyes again. Some things just wouldn’t stay buried in the basement of his mind palace after all. “I’ve got a bit of a history when it comes to my military kink and the BDSM-ish relationship that followed. Things didn’t end well for me last time.”
convinced. He decided to test Sherlock’s obedience one last time. He switched off the telly and focused solely on the trembling, sweating man at his feet. “You’re doing so well, sweetheart. Didn’t even beg for mercy when I edged you with the highest settings.”
It took a while till the question registered in Sherlock’s mind. He turned his head towards the man next to him and managed to lock eyes with John. “No, sir.”
“You’re lying! We had a bloody deal!” Thomas brought even more distance between him and the police officers.
“Please hear me out, yeah? It’s about your punishment yesterday. I have already told you that I don’t like inflicting too much pain. Of course I checked in with you to make sure that you were completely okay with the things we did, but it’s still a bit difficult for me. We already are in a relationship. I care about you in ways that exceed simple aftercare for a sub and I just…” John heaved a sigh. “I’ve never seen you cry, Sherlock.”
Mrs Hudson came out of her flat when she heard the front door close. “Oh, hello, John!” she greeted him and gave him a motherly hug as soon as he slipped off his dripping wet jacket. “Are you alright? You look terrible, dear!”
“John, you– your pants are…” he blankly stared at the red fabric clinging to John’s erection tightly.
“Please, sweetheart,” John pleaded and tried to arch his hips up, but Sherlock gently pinned him back to the bed.
John took a few steps towards Sherlock who was standing in the middle of the sitting room. “Good. If anything becomes too intense, I want you to use it. If anything I do exceeds your limits, don’t hesitate to use your safeword, Sherlock. You don’t have to justify or explain anything if you do.” He couldn’t stress this often enough.
Sherlock released John’s balls and moved higher, kissing and nibbling his way up John’s length. Once he located the head of John’s cock near the elastic waistband, he focused on that. It was impossible to actually close his lips around it, but Sherlock enthusiastically lapped at it, wetting the annoying fabric with his saliva. The tip of the crop stopped caressing Sherlock’s arse and Sherlock moaned into John’s crotch when he was rewarded with a slap. Sherlock continued what he was doing, earning himself eight more slaps. Just as he figured out what worked and what didn’t, John pulled away.
!” Sherlock snapped impatiently. “It takes a lot to push my limits within the boundaries we negotiated. Apparently, a lot more than
Sherlock followed him hesitantly. He couldn’t be fooled by John’s carefree demeanour. John was nervous about something; it was more than obvious from his elevated breathing rate and the one too many smiles. Sherlock joined his boyfriend on the sofa and gracefully sipped his tea, pondering on random case facts and John’s behaviour.
“I don’t know, sweetheart. I don’t like the idea of leaving you alone with a man that almost shot you.”
“You just solved one,” John reminded him decidedly friendly, paying little attention to the man who was gradually working himself into a frenzy. Underneath the façade of stoic calm, the army doctor was everything but.
enough,” Sherlock rasped and grinned like a Cheshire cat when he slowly crawled over John, the blanket slipping off his shoulders on the way.
…” John gestured between them, “kink negotiations and open communication are just as important. So yes, I am more than amenable for all of this, Sherlock. But considering everything you’ve already experienced, it’s more than important that we start this the right way. Like it or not, communication
Sherlock hadn’t anticipated John’s move at all. He gave a gasp that turned into a drawn-out moan when John closed his lips around the small bud and sucked gently. Sherlock dug his short fingernails hard into the pleather in order not to press John’s mouth closer against his chest. When John had sucked the pink flesh to full hardness, he focused his attention on Sherlock’s other nipple and pinched the left one between his thumb and index finger instead. Sherlock tilted his head back and arched his chest into the teasing touch. He almost sobbed when John carefully worried the right bud between his teeth. “Please, sir,” he groaned without knowing what he was actually begging for.
“That’s not what I thought. Well, not all of it,” John admitted. “But of course I was worrying I had crossed your limits. I care about you, Sherlock, and I still want to understand why you were crying during the scene. You weren’t in subspace then.”
“Don’t be daft, John, of course it’s my stupid brother!” Sherlock’s expression became softer when he looked at John again. “You look surprised. Why?”
John only watched while Sherlock sprawled himself on the couch. The dark leather complemented his pale skin beautifully. He sat down between Sherlock’s spread legs and continued teasing him with light, oh so light butterfly kisses on his thighs.
John groaned and trembled through his orgasm and Sherlock slowly pulled away, licking John clean as best as he could. He kept massaging John’s perineum till there was no more come leaking from his twitching cock and swirled his tongue around the glans one last time. John gave a weak moan when Sherlock withdrew his mouth completely and licked his swollen lips to wipe even the tiniest remnants of John’s powerful orgasm away.
Lestrade and his team of two uniformed police officers were waiting in a less crowded part of the arrivals area. Greg looked mildly distressed and John had a faint idea that it might have something to do with one of the many text messages Sherlock had typed out furiously.
John made a strangled noise when Sherlock rutted their hips together in a frantic rhythm, but he didn’t want to come like this, didn’t want Sherlock to come like this. With his hands he stilled the thrusting movements of Sherlock’s hips, but before the other man could complain, he hooked his thumbs under the waistband of Sherlock’s pants and pulled them down to his ankles, then quickly got rid of his own pyjama bottoms and pants. John could clearly see the pleading look in Sherlock’s eyes but God, how he loved to tease him. He wrapped his hand around Sherlock’s cock and gave it a couple of firm strokes before he closed his lips around the glans and sucked gently. Sherlock clenched his hands into the sheets, threw his head back and moaned shamelessly when John hummed around his length and took more of him into his mouth. John enjoyed this as much as Sherlock did, but he did not want to make his boyfriend come like this either. He knew that Sherlock would beg for more if he brought him to the edge without letting him come and
Sherlock let the blue dressing gown slide off his shoulders and placed it over the armrest of the sofa. He unzipped his trousers and shuffled them off just as quickly, then efficiently unbuttoned his shirt to get rid of that as well. The black boxer briefs were tented by a massive erection and Sherlock sighed when he finally took off the restricting fabric.
Sherlock licked and nibbled at the outline of John’s cock through his pants, all the while looking up at him. “Can I suck you off? Please let me suck you off, John,” he demanded, voice sounding innocent and completely at odds with the way he teased him.
“That’s bribery.” Sherlock tried to keep his breathing steady, but he was already close to panting and definitely getting hard again. John had learned exactly how to make him come undone. “
Sherlock nodded frantically, but when there was no verbal response to John’s question, John leant forward and teasingly breathed on the dark, wet head of his cock.
“Good boy,” John cooed when Sherlock let go off his finger. He didn’t miss how Sherlock’s cheeks tinged pink at the praise.
Eventually, John broke away gasping for breath and as Sherlock opened his eyes again he was a bit overwhelmed with the sight before him: John’s lips were kiss-swollen and slightly parted and his pupils were dilated to two black pools of arousal.
. 'Delete possible scenarios,' Sherlock thought and refocused on the present situation. Thomas handled the gun in a way that would probably result in injuring or killing someone, even if he set it off accidentally. Sherlock’s gaze wandered over the charcoal steel: apparently, the man was so nervous that he hadn’t noticed how the safety was still on. Sherlock approached him slowly.
“I put myself in fatal danger because of that. But you saved me, like you always do.” John tugged a bit harder on Sherlock’s curls and elicited a low moan. “You were afraid that you wouldn’t be there in time; I noticed the panic in your eyes. You like to protect me, it’s like an unspoken vow you’ve burdened yourself with, but sometimes I’m taking that option right out of your hands.”
about you.’ Mycroft drawled, his best attempt at sincerity. John had stopped at his shoulder and the alphas shared a glance. Mycroft raised an eyebrow.
They opened the oldest looking one. Page after page of neatly printed columns. Postcodes , dates and then two columns of numbers.
Sherlock filled him in on what he had missed and John let him get to the part where Greg had called Graeme before he broke in sharply.
'Dr Watson, this is all Sherlock himself. I think...' The Doctor looked at him awkwardly. 'I think his brother may have requested you as next of kin because he thinks you could help.' She finished.
The moment crumbled and they both turned.Mycroft Holmes leant on his umbrella in the doorway. Holding a file in one hand. His scent and expression impossible to read, no doubt through long practice, though John was sure Mycroft knew exactly what
John made tea for them both. He was just placing a cup at Sherlock's elbow, that he knew would likely be left to go cold, when he heard two female voices. Mrs Hudson and
The doctor left him with a weary smile and he made his way back to Lestrade who squeezed his shoulder. Not asking, which Sherlock was grateful for.
The slight background buzz of after work drinkers surrounded them as Greg, with a careful glance round, passed him an envelope. Even Sherlock would have to concede he'd been thorough.
'You're going to have to explain it better than that. An A-Z?' Dimmock stood beside the ambulance where John and Mycroft were being checked over.
'Don't apologise. You were very subtle, a normal unobservant person wouldn't have noticed. Besides, I was looking at you too.'
The alpha left and they could hear him being accosted by Mrs Hudson and her cousin on the way down, much to Sherlock's amusement.
‘No you didn’t. It’s how you get your kicks, isn’t it? You risk your life to prove you’re clever.’ The alpha was pulling him closer. He could see Donovan, Anderson out of the corner of his eye, the fools more interested in the romantic angle than the fact the alpha had obviously killed someone. For him.
He realised everyone else in the room was waiting for a response from him. Joe with a slight smile as if he knew exactly where Sherlock's mind had been. He hurriedly tried to recall what Richard had said which had in fact been
The sound of the front door had hope swelling in his chest but he knew the confident heavy tread on the stairs and it wasn't John .
'Well we could look into this. If I'm being forced to visit my parents tomorrow you could indulge me with a little breaking and entering afterwards, hmm?'
'In the flat – no. Aside from the unforgivable breach of privacy. My brother would have found them in the first day. There is however a security camera on the landing. A sensible precaution in an old building.'
John was obviously fighting his own body's urge to submit, it could be read in the tilt of his face,the softening of his shoulders. Sherlock felt an (unwelcome) stab of pride because Lestrade hadn't had this effect on the omega. He wanted to touch John's hair but his balance was too off with the crutches. The omega arched expectantly.
of the riding crop hitting Sherlock’s skin and eliciting a moan from the detective, followed by Sherlock thanking his Dom. When Sherlock thanked him for the ninth, he noticed tears welling up in his eyes and by the time they reached fourteen, he was sobbing uncontrollably. What faintly sounded like “Twenty, thankyou, Jawn,” was barely recognisable between the ragged gasps and sobs.
Sherlock felt the heat rising in his cheeks and cleared his throat. “The thing that you did yesterday… I liked it a lot, John. It was good,” he admitted and smiled when he was rewarded with another kiss.
“Yeah, of course, love,” John said tiredly and wrapped his arm around Sherlock’s waist when Sherlock snuggled up to him. “What about the tears? Are you ok?”
“Escape? No, no, no, I’m sure he went to Seville to enjoy the nice weather! Of course he would try to escape!”
“Oh fffuck, Sherlock!” John was done for. He came hard all over his abdomen and hand, but he didn’t allow himself to ride out the afterwaves of his intense orgasm. Instead, he wrapped his hand around Sherlock’s cock, using his own come as lubricant to reduce the friction. Sherlock squirmed under the touch, but he obediently kept his hands on the armrests.
Sherlock was utterly satisfied. Not only physically, though. Apparently, a single word was all it took to spice up their morning sex. A single word and a kink that – as he now knew – both of them were up for. The following days would definitely be fun.
Sherlock was out of his depth. Why couldn’t John just get on with the fucking punishment? “I don’t know.” John grabbed a handful of curls and pulled moderately until Sherlock looked up at him. “I don’t know,
Sherlock forced himself to stop before he got too close and focused on John’s pleasure instead. He leant forward and placed affectionate kisses on John’s cheeks, the corners of his mouth, his jawline, followed by some less affectionate and hungrier kisses on John’s throat and chest and abs. Sherlock smirked when John’s breath hitched as he dipped his tongue into John’s navel on his way down, but he stopped just before his lips reached the waistband of John’s pants.
“Rules are rules, Captain,” Sherlock rasped and 'accidentally' brushed his erection against John’s naked hips. He made a show out of getting up and stretching once he stood beside their bed, drawing all of John’s attention to his slim waist and the obscenely tented boxer briefs. Walking towards the bathroom he let his hips sway a bit more than usual, showing off his full, rounded arse. Sherlock slowly turned around and brushed some stray curls out of his face. “Care to join me in the shower, John?” he asked and John almost jumped to his feet. Sherlock smirked. He held out his right hand and John let himself be dragged into the bathroom.
“I’m sorry, sweetheart. I want to enjoy this moment as much as you do, but I have to leave in a few hours. Clara just called me; Harry’s had a relapse, rather bad one from what I can tell. I have to stay with her till Clara gets back from work, but I can worry about that when I’m there. Right now, there are more important things. So… you wanted to talk about yesterday?”
Though his face was turned away from the door, Sherlock closed his eyes instinctively as John entered the room. He heard the rustling sound of fabric hitting the floor and seconds later John lay down next to him. “Sherlock?” he whispered into the dark silence between them. Sherlock opened his eyes. At least John’s speech wasn’t overly slurred. “Please look at me, sweetheart. I know you’re not asleep yet.”
Sherlock took John’s hand that still rested against his chest into his own hand and guided it down to his crotch. John only gasped when Sherlock pressed John’s palm against the damp fabric of his pants and the throbbing bulge underneath. He kept John’s hand pressed firmly against his erection when he leant closer towards the other man; so close that his lips brushed against John’s ear when he spoke.
Sherlock loosened his grip on John’s cock and fondled his balls instead. With each downwards movement he took more and more of John’s cock into his mouth and he varied the amount of suction with each upwards movement. John was a writhing, groaning mess and eventually his hips jerked up on their own accord. He wasn’t impatient per se, just unable not to thrust into the tight, slick heat.
is the clever one; only used you like a marionette so he wouldn’t have to get his hands dirty. But the best part is that you fell for it, completely. With the substantial evidence you’ve both left behind it was child’s play to convict your brother. But he’s trying to attenuate his sentence, so he sold you down the river, Thomas.”
deep in his mind palace that rushed to the surface in a dizzying pace. He’d have to do some research first, though.
“Sherlock, did you use my laptop again?” John sounded irritated, angry even, and Sherlock knew exactly why – not that he could be bothered to answer him though.
“You cried when the scene was over. I mean, you were very deep under, but it wasn’t that. I’ve pushed you too far and I didn’t even realise it at first, but that’s exactly why you acted the way you did yesterday. Subspace puts you in a very vulnerable state of mind and instead of helping you get back to vanilla space safely, you dropped.
Oh. He still hadn’t read it then. “I sent you a text message a couple of hours ago,” Sherlock explained and angrily wiped the tears away with the back of his hand.
because that’s all I wanted to be again. It was a bit overwhelming to actually hear you say it after the punishment.”
Sherlock’s breathing rate increased and he realised that he was getting hard again. He had promised John to get to bed before the other man would stand up and to be honest, Sherlock did not want to be anywhere else now. It already was seven in the morning and – having memorised John’s sleep pattern months ago – chances were that John would wake up as soon as Sherlock climbed into bed. Chances also were that John would not object to a round or two of casual morning sex.
who dropped. Dom drop is far less common than sub drop, but obviously it’s not a good place for you, so please let me help you get out of it.”
solved the case, but I need an official statement for the paperwork. Thomas didn’t say anything about his motive or the murder itself.”
Sherlock didn’t reply to that because he felt that even a simple 'yes, sir' was enough to violate the rules John had just set for him.
, so to speak. As your sub, I’m also responsible for helping you cope with Dom drop, or better still prevent it from happening in the first place.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “When it comes to the things that escape your understanding, you’ll have to be more specific, John.”
“John?” Sherlock asked quickly before his Dom could stand up and looked at him with dilated pupils. The pain of the punishment made him drift around the edges of subspace, but it was just out of reach.
First of all, sorry for being away for so long! Real life kept getting in the way of writing, but somehow this still turned into a 9k words chapter.
For a while, John didn’t move a single bit. He simply kept on leaning against the fridge; his mind pleasantly confused, trying to make any sense of what had just happened. Sherlock had never even kissed him like that while working cases before! John took a steadying breath, but when he still didn’t move, Sherlock addressed the matter at hand without even looking at him.
John smiled. “Whatever you need, pet.” He leaned in and pressed his lips against his boyfriend’s in a soft kiss.
“It’s rough and intense, but I like it. I’m moaning around your cock, tears stream-streaming down my face when you make me take your entire length down my throat, but you don’t care. I swallow around you, want to please you so badly. You keep on fucking my mouth but sssuddenly pull out when you’re close. I’m beg-begging you to let me suck you off, but you say that I don’t even deserve to swallow your cum until punishment’s over.” John withdrew his mouth from Sherlock’s cock to fill his lungs with some much-needed oxygen.
John had become overly concerned about his well-being and – Sherlock suddenly opened his eyes, there was something, a tiny little
Sherlock crawled back over John’s upper body and lay down on top of him. John buried both hands in his hair and pulled him down into another passionate kiss. “
followed by a nasty stinging sensation. “One, thank you, John.” The next one landed merely an inch under the first. “AH! Two, thank you, John.” The third blow landed where Sherlock’s left arse cheek met his thigh and Sherlock cried out at the intense pain. He took a shuddering breath. “Th–three...” he managed to gasp.
John took a deep breath and exhaled in a slow, steady stream as soon as he was alone in the back of a cab. He watched as a particularly big raindrop trickled down the window and realised that his mood had become just as changeable as the London weather.
Sherlock mentally flipped through the diverse collection they’d purchased over the months and couldn’t suppress a grin. “Hm, yes.”
“Of course you can imagine how disappointed I was when I found you smoking in the loo at Scotland Yard. I wanted to celebrate with you because you’d just solved a ten, but instead I spent the night at Harry’s.”
John turned to Lestrade instead: “What is it with you and Sherlock lately?” He hadn’t missed that Sherlock picked at the DI’s mistakes more than usual.
John finally took pity on him and pressed the plug deeper into Sherlock’s arse. Sherlock whimpered as the thickest part was slowly pushed past his rim. John tapped against the end of the plug when it was fully buried in Sherlock’s tight arse and Sherlock moaned in response. He was enjoying this way too much. “Put your hands behind your back, now!” John demanded and Sherlock hurried to obey. Before the detective could wrap his mind around the purpose of the unexpected command, he already felt the soft leather padding of the handcuffs around both wrists.
need your help with this case. Our suspect is already waiting in one of the interrogation rooms.” The three of them headed for the lifts since the interrogation rooms and custody section were four floors beneath the DI’s office.
John followed him down the corridor to their bedroom, eager to finally play with his boyfriend. The last two weeks had been cluttered with cases, leaving no space for any kind of scene. There had been lonely handjobs in the shower for John while Sherlock had ignored his transport as usual. The man must have been
Apparently, Greg’s pulsing cock got the hint. He decided it was a perfect moment to communicate with his brain by rewiring a few neuronal connections linked to unsearched themes in porn sites.
“My mood” and with a final patronizing look, he tied another piece of cloth around Sherlock’s eyes, tugging a bit more than necessary, lingering a bit on Sherlock's long pale neck, feeling his sudden pulse-rate increase; and oh how they loved to do that, combine lust with medical semi-useless knowledge.
“We had thousands of books and a family dinner every couple weeks, for our parents, that was enough human interaction. So, we never saw anything wrong with just keeping each other company.”
He pulled himself from the tongue getting into his throat and pinned Sherlock’s arms above him while kissing his neck, leaving a trace of marks and bites all along down his collarbone. His other hand started to rub Sherlock’s cock above the fabric of his trousers. Sherlock let out a loud moan as he wrapped his leg around John’s waist. Damn, in fact he was short.
“I was also heartbroken; he could’ve fought more to stay with me but chose to leave and let me figure out the world on my own. Again, now I see how that’s a good thing, but it still hurt like death. He promised to get “treated” for his indecencies and never put a hand on me again. He’s the gatekeeper wishing to be the one locked out.”
“We’ll have about 45 minutes before Lestrade convince Mycroft to stop being a ridiculous berk and comes back.”
Sherlock dragged himself up to his chair and stuck a hand between the seat and back cushions, emerging with a crushed packet of cigarettes and what seemed to be a very expensive silver-made lighter. He pulled one little roll of death to his perfectly swollen lips, using his long slim fingers to shield the flame as the tip of it lighted with a red copper colour. A secret reward for special occasions.
– would suffice for John to understand his plea, as he felt how his capacity to formulate coherent sentences fell apart.
And just like that, like so many times before, John Watson's voice, not even knowing, was the perfect conductor of light for the darkest times in Sherlock's madness.
- rarely, Sherlock Holmes felt as guilty as when he put John in uncomfortable situations due to his recklessness.
Mycroft began sketching; emphasizing a very purplish vein now pulsing next to Greg's thumb, "Testicles now, if you'd be so kind."
The slick muscle kept penetrating the doctor as he felt how, with each new thrust, his frenulum suffered from being stretched too much. He soon would need to migrate to other limbs, Greg thought. His whole body moved forward up John's back as he blindly reached for the bottle of lube.
it took them twenty-five steps to get to what everyone thought was nothing more than an abandoned attic.
, you cease all movement at that precise second and resume until I say so. This is a craft that demands precision; this requires patience, dedication, respect of the process, are we clear?"
Sherlock hummed as he tried to rock his hips to brush against anything! Being like this, with John whispering in his neck was as exquisite torture. John kept licking all the way down to Sherlocks nipples, never releasing the strong grip of his hair. Nibbling slowly as his other hand wandered all over Sherlock’s torso. Ironically, the sensation of each small scar under his fingers only made him harder. He felt he was going to have a heart attack if he didn’t do something.
Greg grabbed him by the waist from behind and nuzzled the nape of his neck, slightly rubbing against the fabric of Mycroft’s expensive shirt. Where those things meant to endure the perspiration of more than a day of watching live-action orgies in the name of altruism?
Sherlock's face reflected the momentary horror and involvement of those words and his vivid imagination. How grotesque it must be for the common siblings to learn that your brother finally had the life he deserved and was deprived of for so long.
– Sherlock closed his eyes, vibrating with anger. What could he do? Retrieve to his mind palace to forget about the exquisite agony of having John Watson riding all over his aching cock? That wouldn’t help, he had an entire wing destined to all the lustful thoughts he created about John daily.
–with that final statement, Sherlock grabbed John’s arm pulling it closer to him while using his leg to trip them down. It took John by surprise and before he tried to counterattack, he was already facing the floor. Sherlock straddled him and began to undo John’s shirt buttons with his mouth. He gripped John’s crotch, his prick encased by his trousers, rising more and more with each button left behind.
Both started jiggling at the stupidity of the whole situation. Mycroft didn’t recall the last time he had laughed so much; his eyes were teary, and he had to cough back a few more giggles before being able to breath. Their amusement was interrupted by the car pulling over at the Yard, and the driver opening Lestrade’s door.
“Those are not valuable, when I came back from Afghanistan and started therapy, the doctor suggested me to keep journals, supposedly, to be able to heal myself since she was not making a progress. I think she was worried I would get cancer from all the resentment and anger. It all started with napkins during tea time and escalated to … this.”
Shivers started to rove down his spine, not ever knowing that the soft spots of his legs could feel so arousing. He realised it was not his anatomy and perfect genes doing the work. John's tender care and sweetness, always gentle and caring. Soft on the inside but ready to slash your throat without blinking, if the situation required it.
John looked up in exasperation. Couldn’t Sherlock see he was about to do something QUITE important? Spoiled brat, this is not always about him. Nevertheless, he stood up and went looking for another pack of rope.
Now Lestrade was going crazy finding a way to buy time for the pair of stupid advisers to return that crucial piece of evidence before the entire case was dismantled for mismanagement of resources, and the suspect was released. He pleaded calmly while pulling out a bottle of Jack Daniels from his desk and vigorously placing a paper cup on the table:
Not even after paying for a premium porn subscription John saw and felt anything like that. Lestrade's warm fill worked the perfect lubricant for John to brutally begin thrusting as Sherlock arched harder to get John closer.
“Depends entirely on who you ask,” he said, lifting his gaze, cutting an even smaller piece of duck, using the same seductive mannerism. His tongue became a hook, catching and constricting the bite; swallowing audibly, making his Adam’s apple bob.
But the good doctor took all his remaining bravado, drawing back his attention to Sherlock’s perfectly toned legs, pulling out his tongue in shape to lick his way up to an anatomy class like those he always would’ve wanted to impart.
He shifted a bit, closing his eyes and resting his head more comfortably in John’s tight letting the reassuring hand of the doctor to stroke his hair
Suddenly he felt extremely exposed and cursed every Spanish lesson he ever took. Other than the sound of police sirens in the distance and the occasional car passing by, not a soul was near to be seen. He found himself wondering if he was terrified of a city that he practically controlled or if it bothered him that he couldn't handle the spontaneous plans Greg, Sherlock and John were used to.
They run to the kitchen as Mycroft pulled a towel from the sink and put the little bird in it trying to heat it with his hands and breath, giving small pumps to his chest. It had a deep wound right below the right wing. After a few minutes, the bird chirped, and Sherlock let out a huge sigh.  He began to jump with joy and clung to Mycroft's waist.
. A truthful translation of feels and intention with every brushstroke; touch and oil paints mingling for the sake of artistic conception. If the thought of sliding wet bristles against a canvas couldn't redirect his blood flow instantly to his groin, it wasn't a work worth the effort.
He continued sucking him while the world went blank, in a symphony of raged breaths accompanied by John's heaving chest. He kept preventing Sherlock to retreat, and vigorously pulled from Sherlock’s hair for him to look up straight in the eye, "Swallow me", he tightened the grip, "Can you do it for me, love?", he pulled his head to one side sucking a bruise on Sherlock's pale neck, "Can you?".
While Sherlock kept struggling to get a little friction, whatever it was, whatever life wanted to give him; John interrupted his ministrations as he held and squeezed it.
“Even someone as obtuse as me can figure out you’d both die for each other, quite literally. I can tell because I’d do it myself.”
Sherlock remained firm on the spot, waiting for John to react; this was not a battle he was willing to lose. Not this time. His mum would be proud of him.
Indeed, if there was a God watching, then elegance and manners could very well go fuck themselves, he had work to do, and his brain needed to keep cooperating soothingly! “Wait not here, bedroom, now.” he spun on his heels before remembering manners, “if you all please.”
John's smirk was visible even with half of Sherlock's prick invading his mouth, "… how? erotic and divine?"
John obeyed; Greg’s fingers dug deeper, thrusting, slicking and piercing him. A smile appeared on Sherlocks face as he felt how John’s body rocked above him, dancing along with Lestrade’s ministrations.
Sherlock gripped the backrest firmly, panting without taking his gaze away from Mycroft. Oh, the way his mouth formed a perfect oval, and his eyes began to close away from reality, plunging into bliss. There wasn't enough time, words and materials in the world to capture something like that, something so ethereal and a tiny bit sexy. This is what Goya must have felt throughout his dark period.
His considerations were interrupted at the sight of the perfect curve Greg's glutes formed as he undressed, immutable to everyone's piercing looks.
John Cleared his throat, “So, it's almost 6 a.m.; you fancy some shitty petrol station snacks? I'm starving.”
Both were grown men around their 40’s, who still haven’t got a clue on how to handle difficult conversations. They kept doing what they did better, and that didn’t work for a good part of their lives: recluse on themselves and get offended by the other one’s behaviour.
“Oh! … no, and that quite a good story actually-” his mouth opened and closed while sorting his options,
“Precisely! … But then… she entered the room, and I was so shocked I couldn’t breathe, cry or speak; all our suppressed shame, I guess, converged in a single person for an instant. I’m so glad I couldn’t deduce people then as I do now,” he huffed, “It would’ve been mortifying to see all that yelling and sobs coming. The room felt gelid; I felt all blood running out me.”
John flushed, unable to blink or say anything more understandabe than a soft whimper equivalent to a -
John almost fell face down the bed as he hyperventilated, soft-silky fabric touching his sweaty skin.
He tried to fix Sherlock’s mess of curls as he cupped his cheeks and kissed him tenderly. Sherlock took the opportunity and shifted John, grabbing him by the waist, putting him back against the front of the couch. He straddled John and kept going with the interrupted snogging.
“You are a DOCTOR for God’s sake!”, he attacked back, “Can’t you see that this is all in your head? That it’s just a malfunction in all the neurochemical transmissions and synapsis your brain is not doing!? You could fix it if you want to, you know how this works!”.
Greg dropped to the floor and began to unbutton Mycroft’s trousers, feeling how his cock bobbled out of the wool encasement already leaking obscenely.
– Sherlock wasn’t even mad at them, he was furious with himself for not being enough for John to stay alive.
He repeated the sequence, until Sherlock’s legs were completely parted, and his pants were no longer a safe barrier for the rising erection he couldn’t seem to control, obviously. John paused his train of thoughts to look at his flatmate right into his eyes. He just nodded, still breathing heavily, full of anticipation and secret untold desires. John lowered his gaze to Sherlock’s crotch and leaned down to lick it; even with the fabric covering it, he felt a shiver roaming down his spine as his tongue slowly licked all over his length. Sherlock let out a soft moan.
What someone would typically expect from an older brother is that he would dedicate himself in life and soul to protecting his siblings, especially someone like Sherlock; fortunately, Mycroft boasted of being a terrible older brother in Sherlock's own words. Greg had no trouble reading between the lines the nod he received.
Both not even trying to hide their moans and groans anymore; this queued Greg to let himself go painting and kissing John’s back. Sherlock felt how his hand was covered in something hot sliding between his fingers while John writhed from overstimulation. He was still holding him while he came. With a last tug on his hair and John gasping, he also resigned himself to ruining the sheets under them.
When John’s knees hit the floor, he tried to distract himself, remembering that if all went well, maybe then he and Sherlock could have dinner and fuck in the men's room again.
Sherlock seemed eager not to let a single opportunity go amiss as he took John's cock tightly and began to caress him while savagely introducing his tongue into his mouth, spilling all over their necks, entwining in the, probably, best and filthiest kiss he could remember.
“I wasn’t aware that among our five-thousand books library, there could’ve been somewhere some chivalry manual I never found that says you can
He took him in his mouth in one long swallow, hollowing his cheeks and rapidly pulling out. Sherlock cried at the loss of warmth around his cock, but John didn’t seem to care about this a bit. He sucked again and pulled off. Sherlock threw his arms and covered his eyes, whispering a soft “fuck” as he tried to calm down, understanding that John was doing it on purpose. He would not comply to such poor and dull vengeance. How dare he. He didn’t need to come … not yet.
Mycroft Holmes was the type of person not easily carried away by trivial eventualities, London’s weather was still unpredictable even for one of Britain’s greatest minds.  The sky opened and it started pouring.
“Mycie, he’s hurt! Fix him! You always fix everything” – the kid’s eyes were teary. Fearful of something, Mycroft wished would take a long time to face with. He stood blankly at the bird and took it from Sherlock’s hands
He turned, Greg stood talk and naked before him. The tiny wrinkles forming on his brow gave him the irresistible responsible-and-mature-but-still-super-fuckable adult look that made Mycroft want to bend him over said impossible-to-get-stained marble counter and fuck his brains out.
Even the prospect of punishment seemed to get to Sherlock. John was glad that he had already planned out the details of the scene during the cab-ride because one look at Sherlock’s face would have been enough to destroy John’s plans if he had to make them now. “Give me your safeword.”
“I think we should move this to the bedroom before Mrs Hudson walks in on us. Get up, pet.” John deliberately skipped the mention of clients, but when Sherlock stood up a little shakily, the prominent bulge in his pyjama bottoms at John’s eye-level, it was obvious that his priorities had changed rather quickly.
“John,” Sherlock breathed, his voice raspy and filled with desire, and leant in for another, more passionate kiss. John was still half-asleep, the movement of his lips a bit uncoordinated and sloppy in his current state of mind, but Sherlock happily took the lead. He sucked John’s bottom lip into his mouth and carefully nibbled at it, sighing when John subconsciously pressed their hips closer together. Then Sherlock let his tongue slide past the seam of John’s lips and flicked it against the tip of John’s tongue, pointedly slow and teasing. Sherlock tried to keep up that deliciously slow pace, but he couldn’t fool himself. The small licks and gentle sucks soon became rougher and more demanding until he lost himself in that kiss and John hummed approvingly. However, when Sherlock began to tug at the hem of John’s shirt, the shorter man broke the kiss and looked at him with the same confusion in his eyes Sherlock had seen earlier, when he had kissed him in the kitchen.
Sherlock was taken aback by John’s openness and seriousness. For a fearful moment, he’d expected him to reject the idea altogether. “I still hate talking about this, but I know that you’re offering me a change for the better in the long run.”
John didn’t pay much attention to where he was going. Regent’s Park would be awfully crowded on a sunny Thursday afternoon, so he decided to head for the inner city. Other than that, he really didn’t care about directions. All he needed was some time to himself, some time to think about their quarrel.
John thought about it for a moment. This was definitely not unwelcome but still a bit unusual for Sherlock.
Sherlock sighed. “Fine, I do have a military kink and I rather liked the way you took charge of that, but can we just…” Sherlock made a small pause, searching for the right words, “…go from there and
“I’m okay with most names unless they’re downright humiliating or insulting. You can use belittling ones, but don’t
sometimes. I enjoy discipline, but I don’t like pain or humiliation when it’s too excessive. I’m clearly into roleplay and–” Sherlock sighed as if exasperated with the inability of phrasing his own thoughts, “
– and sucked again, this time much faster, making Sherlock gasp in a useless effort to control himself.
"No, I do remember you, my sweet cherub." a sudden feeling of nostalgia filling him, "We'll start with you."
“Mycroft what would you say is my most attractive feature, cheekbones or arse?” asked a nonchalant Sherlock while cutting a small, tiny piece of veal, taking his time to suck in and frame his hollow cheeks while the juiciness spread over his tongue.
“When I failed to sleep, I liked to count how many breaths he took or how many strokes he would give my hair before falling asleep, humming songs I didn't even know where played by but caught the melody coming from the servants' radio.”
'Was it because of this morning?' The detective said, slowly rinsing dishes, eyes fixed on them like they were a delicate experiment.
'Indeed, my brother has his uses. I assume if I sneak backstage you'll follow? There may be a scuffle.'
He'd thought about changing things, booking the usual hotel but something always seemed to get in the way. Lestrade had a case, his brother needed something doing that was of national importance, Molly had an interesting cadaver.
‘A Ritchie, Director.’ Sherlock said, tapping the paper. ‘We know a Ritchie from elsewhere don’t we John.’
‘I’ve been thinking over the last couple of days,’ John said, head resting on his collarbone. ‘This is all so quick. Are you sure it’s not too quick for you?’ John risked a look at him, hard question now asked.
Sherlock was touched. He believed that was the expression. Touched and suddenly protective all over again as he realised John-Captain Watson - had found that incredibly hard to say.
'Nor literally doing everything but pulling the strings. I think they're working up to something. Crime it has a normal rhythm, ebb and flow. Drugs, stolen goods move in a pattern. In London, over the last few days, something has happened. Everything slowed. That's why I've been so bored.'
'Did you even listen to me?' John laughed, his mate had changed a lot from the brittle eccentric he'd moved in with all those months ago.
John could see Sherlock's patience, never his best quality, was fraying a little more with each minute they didn't find something.
John was now sitting on the sofa beside Mrs Hudson who had taken it upon herself to keep them both company. The landlady was absorbed in a jaffa cake and some daytime TV abomination, antiques by the look of it. John was looking at him carefully.
Mycroft had no problem with the peachy colour Sherlock drew on his cheeks compared to the disgusting, ordinary burnt red of any other human. He also didn’t care to describe how those turquoise silver eyes tinted black each time his pupils dilated and how his eyelids fell helplessly when he felt happy. He had no problem with how adorable it was to see Sherlock choosing to
He tilted his neck a bit leaving space for Sherlock to manoeuvre. Sherlock tickled with the tip of his nose and then his tongue, all the way up John’s shoulder to the beginning of his hairline, making a small pause to nibble his earlobe.
Sherlock didn't seem to care. Was he really so confident in John that even to hurt him, she seemed to enjoy it?
None of the three nude men realized that about half an hour ago, Mycroft let go of everything in his hands and proceed to unbutton his trousers; he began touching himself at the same time he covered his mouth to avoid yelling more orders or obscenities, perhaps even encourage them.
“I would love to make all the work for you; make you realize how wonderful you are, all the bravery living within you; but I can’t … first because I don’t know how, and second because it won’t work unless you cross that tunnel … so, we’re going to cross that tunnel, John; together”
“Bluff, he knew I wasn’t going to do it, and I knew he would do this … for me. It was a relief you intervene, and we could stop the charade; we get heated pretty quickly.” Sherlock sighed heavily, “Anyway, now you know, please feel free to run in mixing awe and disgust to the nearest bush and throw up. I won’t get mad.”
Mycroft instructed. Sherlock started to undress himself; pulling off his scarf and coat, then took off one shoe at a time. He looked annoyed but expectant, it wasn’t supposed to be his turn this time, he already had planned all he wanted to do to John. He even made a checklist. With bullet points.
Even though the rhythm sounded mouth-watering, and John's cock was beginning to turn dangerously reddish, the growing pool of semen between his legs served as a warning that John was still using all of his willpower to stay in place. John was sure that if he could rub himself, he wouldn't spend half a second before spitting all on Sherlock and ruining Mycroft's moment of contemplation. A guttural cried escaped his throat.
Sherlock called since John didn't realize he was daydreaming, looking at him fondly while his neglected cock began to drip.
!) weren’t enough to stop him from dozing. Greg offered him a polite smile striding to the sweets aisle, but Mycroft winced at such a subtle universe sign of how fucked he was.
John winced while trying to move to a sitting position, “Shit, I think you broke my back”, resenting the weight of the years and inevitably, the weight of the man riding him senseless until a few minutes ago. He would need a chiropractor, a psychiatrist, but most of all … alcohol. Tons and tons of alcohol. The pain was manageable, but the shame of getting old was unbearable.
– and John’s moans were silenced by Sherlock grabbing his jaw and pulling his head back much more down his own shoulder, licking his jaw line.
It started as a sign for comfort and silent cries for help during rough days. Just like that precious moment, holding each other as Sherlock’s orgasm came.
Immediately having realized his mistake; Mycroft furiously crossed out the word and wrote a side note:
Sherlock obeyed as he left all the liquid spread down his chin and chest. Nevertheless, he licked a bit of it from his lip and grinned in approval.
After being completely sure that he could not have prepared the man in front of him better, Greg slowly got up, gently stroking John’s thighs, lining up and inserting himself just a few inches, horribly slow, before beginning to fuck him brutally. Each thrust was faster and deeper than the last. Greg made sure to raise the angle a little higher with each lunge, knowing he was hitting just the right spot to break John.
Mr Saunders, a painter in his mid-80's, laid restless in the stretcher; waving his burned hands, yelling and whining incomprehensible statements on Sherlock, Lestrade and John's direction. The paramedics' futile struggles to calm him only made him angrier. Each sob was a statement on how his case was solved but his life ruined.
Sherlock escaped from Lestrade’s embrace and threw himself to the paramedic. He beat him merciless until his nose was broken, dripping with fresh blood, coughing in shock. Lestrade and two other police officers retrieved Sherlock trying to contain his fury.
That's what the game would be about; with a small grin, Greg wished John all the luck in the world in his quest for self-control and turned around.
If his Neanderthals were already willing to continue inserting all their digits in every possible hole they had at hand, for at least one night, Mycroft thought he could allow himself and his fantasies to serve a better purpose… anyway, his whole life had been based on the sole and absolute guilt for being also an irrational pervert.
John obeyed Mycroft as a sore Sherlock articulated his mouth enough to regain the mobility of his jaw. If looks could kill, his brother would’ve been dead by now. How dreadful this was not an intellect competition, besides, he hated to admit he was a bit concerned of what was coming now that he made that terrible joke about his brother’s sexual potency a few minutes ago.
Sherlock couldn't stand the urge to stop being rightfully surprised and start behaving like the insufferable fuck he knew he was.
John stood up suddenly, anger filling his features, and threw a long-forgotten cup of tea at the wall. Leaving a trail of broken porcelain as it fell to the ground.
They kissed until their lips were swollen. Sherlock removed his trousers and began to impale himself incessantly using John’s palpitating manhood. With one hand, he held firmly by John’s neck and with the other, his long and graceful fingers slicked up John’s entrance, he still had them slightly lubricated with John’s come, but nevertheless, he licked them, letting his two fingers make their way up to John’s prostate, making him grunt at the unison of Sherlock’s own moans.
They hadn't even started, and Mycroft was already exhausted. Could he still change his mind and refuse?
They cheered and made a toast, not for such a corky context as “friendship”, but for secrets and the peace of mind of having taken a weight off their chests. Four grown men taking care of their impulses. All of them being quite drunk when leaving the bar, but all too stubborn to admit it.
His words were muffled by the expertise of someone who enjoys the lack of shame, in one long move, Greg sucked Sherlock. The delicate and thin member quickly found its way down his throat to the bottom, leaving a salty trail on Greg's tongue. It wasn't that long; it left enough room to stick his tongue out each time his lips returned to the base of the penis. His saliva slowly began to trickle into the crevice between Sherlock's legs, a slow promise of what would come if he managed not to come in the next ten seconds.
With this question, four extremely busy and stressed men began a six-hour talk where an agreement was reached to reserve a whole Saturday night, a month, for the sole purpose of “help each other to unwind” … using quite unorthodox methods. They decided unanimously that the best place to carry out their recreational activities would be Mycroft’s place at Crusader House, in Pall Mall.
John and Sherlock were fascinated by how each of the vertebrae of his back was accommodated in perfect synchronization with the hand tightening as he began to massage. Up, and down ...
This was just Sherlock and him like old times, just that now … even when he was resisting, his cock wasn’t cooperating that much, succumbing to Sherlock’s touch.
“Well… that’s not something I could read from the fluffs on your clothes or your fingerprints; what else are you giving away?”
"Allow me…" Sherlock spun him forcing the John to look directly, "John, we will suck each other until the joint of our lips feels like falling apart, with such an amount of lubricant, semen and other fluids inside that the difference between utter bliss and the confusing agony of the possibility our rectums were ripped causing an imminent death by bleeding, will look very, very blurry."
– and stepped into the dark room. They got as comfortable as they could, moving boxes and sacks, setting up a nice shelter for the night. For the “sole purpose of getting warmer” for the “benefit of Sherlock’s help”, John suggested they should cuddle, but not before having searched the entire inventory for a bottle of whiskey.
Mycroft remained silent, considering his options and the possibility of throwing himself into the arms of arrogance and greed, asking for more than they were surely willing to give him to shake off such a tedious request.
Sherlock didn’t say anything as he was just struggling to keep his head up enough to look Watson in the eyes.
Sherlock shut his eyes even more, throwing his hands to his sides, trying to grab from the carpet, unwilling to lose this battle of will power. Yet, he was so close to … and then John stopped and released his cock again.
John advocated reason, as always, "It should be on the fridge, right? It's a vial it needs to be refr… JESUS!".
“Cheekbones; your backside reminds me when mummy forced me to change your nappies. You used to piss all over me. I still think it was on purpose.” Mycroft licked his lips.
Sherlock’s eyes looked dark. He wasn’t ever amused about receiving orders from Mycroft, but for now he had won this match.
“Can I stay over?” Greg's voice sounded far away somewhere in the room as he was probably looking for his pants.
Sherlock became truly aware of this recurrence a few weeks ago. Something was preventing his good doctor of the calmness to endure the whole night; there weren’t nightmares anymore; just crippling anxiety about something he couldn’t just put his finger around and was forthrightly afraid to ask.
