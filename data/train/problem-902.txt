John shifted in his seat, the picture of a boy whose Mum has asked his first date an embarrassing question. He opened his mouth to deflect, but Sherlock beat him to it.
“John,” Sherlock breathed reverently, relief clear in his tone. “Thank god. Just keep your eyes shut for now,” he said gently. John was only too happy to comply; he heard the rustling as Sherlock moved, then the tapping of his shoes across the room.
The picture stapled to the front of the file was that of an older man, a few days’ grizzled stubble peppering olive-tone skin on a lean face with unexpectedly full lips, now pale in death. He had a shock of scarlet blood down the side of his jaw and neck, starting from over his ear.
He was right. Aunt Brigid went a bit pale, and clutched her fiancé’s hand tightly, but said “I know it’s what you have to do, and what you want to do, too. I’ll worry about you, of course.” Uncle-to-be Tim solemnly shook his hand and said “We’ll keep you in our prayers, John.” Harry threw a shouting fit, which her plus one, Clara, observed calmly until she took Harry’s hand and drew her into a hug, stopping her mid-rant. “Oh, you’re a keeper, you are,” John told her fervently. “I know,” Clara said placidly. Harry was not the only Watson who loved Clara after that.
“Come on, then,” a presence loomed at his side, and he looked up, puzzled. John held out a hand to him, and bobbed it insistently while Sherlock stared blankly back. “You are dying to be out there, and I am your partner, and therefore I am asking you to dance.” He bowed a bit from the waist, ever gallant, and waited. He stood as though he would wait forever, lopsided smile never faltering, until his offer was accepted.
“I don’t like it,” Clara declared darkly. “That girl isn’t quite right, if you ask me. You take care with that one.” John nodded, and their talk turned to happier subjects.
“So,” Duck said after a moment, “let’s get you discharged and back out in the world again, what do you say?”
His thoughts were interrupted by a fresh-faced waitress delivering a carafe of water, a plate and a drink to his table. He was about to protest that he had not ordered anything when she winked and handed him another envelope. “Enjoy your evening, Mister Holmes,” she chirped, and disappeared back into the crowd.
“Of course I am, I’m shattered, but this is a wedding and one must make an effort,” she said sharply. “And I intend to catch up with John, which makes me glad.” She scowled briefly at him, then schooled her expression and turned back to John and her father.
"And my mind is going round and round and shaking itself to pieces, and the only thing that makes it settle down is a really complex problem to sink my teeth into. You KNOW this. I've told you! A case, a case, I need a case - right - NOW!"
Hours later when John came home with a bag smelling of Indian takeaway, Sherlock had moved on from his contemplative mood and greeted his friend with enthusiasm and actual appetite. The two worked into the evening on their respective projects, John on his blog post and Sherlock on his write-up of the low-pressure experiments, bouncing ideas back and forth as the thought occurred. Sherlock took himself off to bed when John said goodnight; no sense in writing that he’d just redo when John got a look at it. As he lay under the cool covers, waiting for them to warm up, it occurred to him that the evening had been almost exactly like the vision of home in his head while he was away. The thought followed him to sleep, and his dreams were hazy with firelight and shared companionship.
“Er, she said she left something in her room, or maybe her car? I don’t know!” Stephen stuttered, while the ushers he was chatting with pushed Sherlock back.
John kept alongside until Duck dropped to a walk, then stopped and curled his upper body and put his hands on his thighs while he caught his breath. Seemed he really had gotten out of training. He could manage a decent sprint when it was needed, but as for stamina... while he had seen worse in his patients, he’d generally kept in better shape than this.
For John, this was a little different than the hugs that had come before. John was not overtly in need of comforting at the moment, when his feelings upon seeing his daughter and Sherlock had been warm affection.
John was home again. Really home, as in moved back in, his bed made with tight hospital corners and his shoes lined up in the hall. It still seemed a little unreal to Sherlock, and certainly counted high among his blessings.
and tried to slow his panicked breathing. When he regained some of his composure, he merely lay limply, strength sapped and limbs heavy.
The water felt wonderful sliding down his throat. His skin tingled and was swiftly coated with a skim of sweat, which occasionally gathered and slid down his contours in sensual rivulets.
Settling back down against the length of John’s body, Sherlock bent in to mouth up and down the strong column of John’s throat: scraping his teeth across the Adam’s apple, tonguing the tendons that strained to present themselves, resting sensitive lips against the pulse point to feel the rapid thumping. John’s hand came up again to rest against the back of his head, guiding him up to meet for a searing kiss, all sloppy tongue and eager lips. Sherlock slipped into a fugue of sensation; the heat of the kiss, John’s strong chest against his own, a hand holding his head steady, another stroking down his spine, raising goosebumps in its wake. In his trousers, his cock throbbed, constrained and uncomfortable.
John’s smile turned wry. “My friend can be plenty of trouble all by himself, even when he’s not having a tantrum.”
“Come on Gary, don’t be such a lump. This might be the first unexpected thing you’ve done all year!”
Luck was on his side, and he sank gratefully onto the bench with a sigh. He usually had something on his mind after a morning in Duck’s company, and today he had two big topics to chew on. His thoughts shied away from tackling the conversation they had had about James, and his dogged insistence that he was not gay. Something so fundamental to his understanding of himself seemed like too huge a thing to just figure out with a morning’s hard thinking.
He tried to think if he had ever been aware of that quality of feeling for any man. If it had happened, it would have been swiftly buried, and vehemently ignored afterward - that was the whole point of this exercise, after all. John frowned and dipped up a little more steam. There was something... a niggling idea, elusive and hard to grasp as a fish; he racked his brain to catch it.
and here she swung her leg entirely over the dancer’s head, slotting down in front of him on the motorcycle and winding both legs up around his waist; he flashed the brightest of white, toothy, delighted grins -
Back in his room, his phone buzzed where it lay on the rumpled coverlet. A block of texts, complete with photos, scrolled upward across the screen, ending in a demand for response, which was not forthcoming.
Duck let the silence stretch between himself and John until John began to feel a little uncomfortable. Abruptly Duck grinned and held out his hand. “John, I think you and I are gonna get along just fine. I’ll help you all I can, and your Sherlock, and Rosie, is it? Will get you back in one piece as soon as we can manage to find a big enough shovel, alright? I’ve got a good feeling about you.” He grinned as John shook his hand firmly, wiping his eyes one last time and nodding his head.
) John’s smile spread over his whole face and into his hairline, where his hair was a tousled mess. Sherlock’s face split into a smile, too. He blew out a long breath through his nose, and suddenly they were both laughing. Chests heaving, mouths open, they laughed their joy and relief that this moment existed.
.” His voice sounded a little strangled, or maybe that was because it was bouncing off the wall first?
He had not intended to go back, those months at Baker Street while he helped Sherlock recover. He had raged against it, shouted at Sherlock where he was laid out on the sofa because the man was too weak and sore to stand. And every time, Sherlock had logically, dispassionately, explained to him why it had to be that he go back. For the baby. Because Mary would eventually crack if he never relented, and would come after him. Because Sherlock knew John loved her, and he would be happier with his family.
During the time John had been married, the flat had felt empty. It was worse even than when he had been dead (“away!”); at least when he was hiding in some grotty bolt hole, or chained up in a Serbian cell, Sherlock could still imagine coming back home so clearly he could smell the books and feel the steam on his face, rising from his tea. He held to that image like a lifeline – the glow of the fire, the rich colors and patterns of the flat, and he and John in their chairs. Home.
I said once you were the best, and the wisest man I have ever known, and the most human, human being, too. It’s true, you know. Never doubt it. I am so sorry for all the hurt I have caused you. Despite my failings as a friend and a man, you only ever wanted to help me, I know that. At least this will be the last hurt I ever cause.
“You laugh now, but he has a theory that exercise helps people work out problems because they think differently; their brains are busy keeping them moving, and so the higher processes can get on with things without constant self-censoring.”
John looked searchingly at his friend for another moment; then, still having said nothing, raised his own arms around Sherlock and dropped his cheek onto the warm chest in front of him, exhaling a long breath and closing his eyes. The tension in the body against him drained away as the seconds passed, until they both merely stood, relaxed and breathing against each other.
“Gary,” the tone Davies employed carried a cold threat, but the man was deep in his self-recriminations now, muttering about how he was sorry, he hadn’t meant to, please, he was so sorry. His about-face from tough guy to blubbering mess was so quick and so marked a change that John wondered if he had been using before they arrived. “Gary!” Davies shouted. “Get yourself together, you stupid cunt! We’ve got a problem here!”
Duck let out a long, sighing breath as they held the pose, then casually asked, “so, how was your last night here?”
John had checked his wheezing friend over quickly, but the bloody prat insisted John apprehend the fellow; Sherlock would be right behind him once he’d caught his second wind.
“Doesn’t everyone?” John scowled at him. Was he so obvious, that Duck was able to pick up on his churning confusion about his newly discovered feelings?
John popped up between them, blowing out a whooshing breath and handing the pen back to Sherlock. “Well, that’s all signed, in duplicate, et cetera. What’s next?” He looked from one man to the other, surprised by the new bonhomie between them. “What?”
John felt a prickle on the back of his neck that drew his focus away from the pleasurable sounds and sensations of his dream lover.
“Yeah, or mine...” John grumbled under his breath. Sherlock glowered at him for a moment, then turned back to Dr Harrington, who had observed them impassively. She was fully aware that she could not force John, since he was voluntarily agreeing to continued treatment. If he were being sectioned, then she would call the shots. But in this case, he’d do better to come to a treatment plan that he had a part in devising.
It abruptly dawned on him that agreeing to pretend to be John’s partner might be a colossal mistake. If a single hug and fleeting kiss affected him this profoundly, how can he give it up when the pretense is over? Could he give it up? Or would he drive John away after he could no longer hide how he felt, how he craved more? He sank down into his chair, staring bleakly into a future where his best friend was gone because his inconvenient feelings (Love! Call it what it is!) made it impossible for John to stay.
Rosie giggled and grinned as Amina growled charmingly at her. Once again, John considered how lucky he was that she had come into their lives when she did. “You’ve done wonderfully, Amina. Thank you,” he said, throat unexpectedly tightening. “And… and I’m sorry that…”
The amber liquid in his highball was almost gone, Sherlock noticed. He rattled the ice gently, debating if he should have a third drink so early in the evening, but he was bored stiff by these dreary wedding guests. The bride was the daughter of a new-money type who liked to flaunt his wealth, so no expense was spared for this little get-together being held for the business contacts, elderly relatives, and more distant kin of the happy couple. Which meant the whiskey was excellent, Sherlock thought. Point in favor for a third.
John shivered as the cool of the room seeped into his front where Sherlock had warmed him. He peered up and met Sherlock’s eyes in one of those shared moments where it seemed neither could look away. The silence stretched between them.
As the afternoon began to fade to twilight, Sherlock packed up Rosie’s things to take her home. “I’ll let Amina know you’re likely to be home in a few days,” he ventured.
Strong arms surrounded him, skin to skin everywhere; grounding him in the warmth and silky smoothness of the body embracing him, the well-known voice soothing. “Sherlock, yes, God yes, for as long as you want me, yes.” Sherlock heaved out a breath that was part-laugh, part snort. As if there would come a time when he wouldn’t want John; impossible, now that he had had this taste.
Sherlock nodded, and stepped out into the hall. Before he had fully disappeared, John called, “And bring some decent tea, for chrissake!”
John batted at Sherlock’s arm to get the phone away from his face, then caught him by the wrist and spun around, trapping the arm under his bicep against his rib cage and pinning his friend behind his back unless Sherlock wanted to sprain himself escaping. He positioned the phone, still held in Sherlock’s hand, at a more comfortable distance so he could look at the photo the phone displayed. “Just hold it still for a minute, Christ!”
Sherlock sat down on the bed beside him and looked out the window, brow furrowed in thought. After a moment, he suggested, “If you had had a heart attack and been in hospital, you would expect those around to treat you differently when you were first home, right?”
John dropped his head into his hands for a moment, then with a deep breath looked up again to answer. “Because there are some things it’s easier to talk about with a stranger.”
Later that day John had dressed but skipped socks and sat in his chair with his feet tucked up. He was hammering at his laptop again - writing something, then deleting it, then writing something, and so on. Eventually, John made a ‘sod this’ face (Sherlock had seen – and caused - that one enough to know it well) and clicked with finality. He got up to fill the kettle, then ambled into the loo.
John dropped his face into his free hand for a moment, then looked up with a half-smile Sherlock found utterly adorable (though he would never say so out loud.) “You’re mad, you know that?” And, dropping the package of underpants in his chair, he stepped forward to embrace his friend.
As they left the building to look for a taxi, a sense of heavy exhaustion settled over John, and even Sherlock’s boundless energy seemed depleted. Once they had found a cab and were on the way to John’s flat, Sherlock sagged into the seat and listed over during a turn until his unwounded side pressed into John’s, a warm, solid presence that John found very welcome. It proved his friend was still there, even when John’s eyes inevitably closed.
John wondered as he bent to get into the taxi that had appeared like magic at Sherlock’s slightest gesture. As they drove off, he observed his friend out of the corner of his eye. His cheeks and the tips of his ears were pink, though the day was brisk and it could have been from the wind. Sherlock noticed him looking and raised a sardonic eyebrow, then turned without a word to look out the window.
John thought wryly. His gaze drifted downward and snagged on the pigmented spot on Sherlock’s lean throat; the little mark that had begun the torrent of feelings and realizations that had sent him into the night. It was just as mesmerizing in person, and John felt a frisson of something dangerous at the sight.
Sherlock closed the email, and then the laptop, taking up his violin to play by the window. He felt unexpectedly solemn, and the sweeping notes he coaxed out of the instrument brought to mind John’s profound, far-away expression that occurred less and less often lately. Sherlock played to that deep stare, and in his mind, his arm supporting the violin was around John’s shoulders, and his bowing stroked through ash-blond, silvering hair.
“John?” A horrible rasping croak broke his reverie. He shook the memories off, and regarded Duck sheepishly.
“Not for long,” John said, “They’ll be remembering when they run my laps – I plan to make them sprints, and ten laps is two and a half miles!”
He ruminated a little more while John tried to interest him in a sandwich and he waved it off. John was just wiping crumbs off his shirt after putting his plate in the sink when Sherlock’s phone pinged. “Text from Lestrade,” he drawled, “what do you know about the effects of uncontrolled decompression on a body?”
He wasn’t sure how much time passed while he clung to his baby girl and wept, but by the time the door opened and Sherlock’s curly head poked in, he was utterly exhausted and the baby was asleep. John was almost asleep himself, salty tracks down his cheeks as he slumped back on the inclined slope of the bed, Rosie firmly held close. The sound of the door roused him enough to open one eye, and he was able to glimpse Sherlock schooling his expression back to its usual sober neutrality.
He felt Sherlock’s cheek lift from his head. Sherlock inhaled and exhaled long and slow, then lips made contact with John’s forehead in a soft but unmistakable kiss.
after a particularly lascivious dipping maneuver, and he leaned forward to get a better view of the fox and the dove.
John’s hands tightened, then released as the words penetrated. He leaned away, shaking his head, and reached for the lamp on his bedside table. Yellow light bloomed in the room, revealing Sherlock panting under him, breaths wheezing as he rubbed his neck. Red marks were already starting to show on the pale skin of this throat; bruises emerging in the unmistakable shape of hands.
“And that’s supposed to help, is it? Just relax and not be bored anymore? Excellent advice, I don’t know why I’ve never considered that.” Sherlock stated waspishly.
“I can’t imagine they would ever say anything like that,” John snarked. “But I get what you were trying to do. Bloody hell, Duck.”
Aunt Brigid was right behind him, beaming as she sipped. “Sometimes the second try is the one that sticks,” she said pointedly, poking her husband’s arm. John and Sherlock laughed with relief and raised their cooling cups together.
“Alright, then?” Duck’s harsh rasp called from up the path a bit. John cracked a smile as he raised his head and waved vaguely at his companion, who still looked keen and chipper.
Duck huffed a breathy chuckle. “I am, because I think it’s one of those things you need to suss out for yourself. Ask me again another day.”
John regarded him with a raised eyebrow. “I doubt I would find anyone with a similar set of circumstances to mine, Sherlock. Unless there’s a group for anger-challenged, assassin’s widowers whose best friends came back from the dead?” John’s tone tried for jovial, yet he didn’t miss the fleeting stricken look on his friend’s face as the comment passed. Sherlock resumed his poker face in an instant, but John still felt like a heel. He sighed. “I’m sorry.”
John merely nodded shortly, and shuffled along the beam behind Sherlock’s confident steps. The breeze was stronger now. It tickled the back of John’s neck and made him shiver.
Sherlock watched all this, nonplussed. He sat up to better see his mad lover sprawled across the bed. “All… right,” he drawled, “should I take off my shirt, too?”
“Why ever,” murmured John, stretching up for a taste of his own, “can’t we, then?” He dipped in again, shifting his hips minutely against Sherlock, a delicious friction for both of them.
John turned his head to look into Sherlock’s eyes for a moment as they so often did, his own eyes shining. The moment stretched, and tension tightened between them. Sherlock leaned in –
"No!" John took a breath and blew it out, swallowing his irritation. "No mantras, Sherlock. Right, okay. Sit comfortably and close your eyes. Take a breath."
“Erm,” his friend replied, clearing his throat, “I thought I saw a hawk moth on those flowers,” he waved vaguely at a swath of bluish-purple spikes of flowers. “Lavender is attractive to bees, of course, but moths are more rare in this area.” He regarded John from the corner of his eye, then swung round back to the chair where his coat lay. “You said you had a run?”
He blew out a breath. “Yes. We’ve at least made a good start.” His answering smile was brief and sheepish.
– and softly, gently, pressed his lips to John’s. His eyes fluttered shut. The kiss was short but lingering, and he felt John’s lips spread into a smile under his own. As he pulled back, John’s lopsided smile came into focus, bright and pleased. John was a better actor than Sherlock had given him credit for, if this was him shamming a boyfriend reaction. As it was, he had no idea what expression was on his own face; he was breathless with his own daring and the pounding of his pulse.
Sherlock had initially broken into a pleased grin, which faded as John went on. “I’m sure we’d all be glad to have you home,” he suggested tentatively.
John stepped into his scuffs and started to walk back toward his room, snagging a bottle of water on his way out. He cracked it and handed it to Sherlock, putting his other hand on a wool-swathed arm to halt his friend’s rush for the door. “Here, drink this - you’re a little flushed, and no wonder, in the sauna in your coat like that.” A shiver ran through Sherlock, and he took the bottle gingerly, sipping with clear reluctance. He handed it back with a nod, eyes dark and hooded despite the fluorescent lights. “Are you alright, really, Sherlock? You’re not coming down with something are you?” John squeezed the arm he had been grasping, then absently slid his hand down and off as he continued on toward his room while his friend waved away any notion he might be ill with impatient strides and scoffed denials.
A garbled mess of voices protesting these accusations competed with the shouted insults. The group of spectators stepped more tightly up against the doorway to watch the show, and didn’t turn at the squeak of John’s trainers on the tiles. He tapped one on the shoulder, a tall, thin bloke who was craning his head to see over the crowd and into the room. “Can I get through, please?” John asked mildly, indicating the doorway. “I think they’re wondering where I am.”
He left John to pay the fare as usual, but waited for him at the door of the shop full of ready-to-wear, high-quality suits and assorted men’s clothes. John uncomfortably scanned the interior as he entered; noting the lack of price tags immediately and with trepidation. “Sherlock, how much is this going to cost? I don’t think I can afford a new suit like this.” He indicated a flashy shop figure swathed in rich mahogany fabric with a muted shimmer.
“Right then, let’s get down from here, okay? You must be freezing your tits off.” He began to turn, then paused at the expression on his friend’s face. “Unless there’s something else?”
Sherlock flopped back into the absurdly soft bed, groaning. He had squandered a chance to observe John as he woke up because his transport had failed him. Admittedly, he had probably done that to himself, since his sleep patterns the last week had not been very regular, and the journey to the hotel-and-reception-facility in the countryside near Bath had been taxing, and his resolution to stay up and observe John as he slept (“yeah, that’s kind of creepy,” “Hush, John.”) so as to miss nothing probably had not helped matters.
“Now, John, there’s nothin’ t’apologize for. Your girl here is a pure delight to watch, and I’m happy to do it. We’ve become friends, you an’ I, haven’t we? Friends help out.” She chucked John on the shoulder, not at all as gently as she had Rosie; he rubbed the spot absently. “And it’s what you pay me for, so I come out ahead, don’t I?” She laughed musically, eyes sparkling.
For tonight’s outing, he had redressed in some of his finest: a deep sapphire silk shirt open at the throat to the third button, and a smooth, black suit, tailored to cling to his form and emphasize his long lean neck and rounded rear, arguably his best features. John loved him in this outfit; he had stuttered and licked his lips obsessively all night the first time Sherlock had worn it for him. In keeping with the plan, Sherlock had styled his hair in a sleek swept-back shape that slicked his curls into lustrous waves close to his head. He had even dipped into John’s own bag of tricks, carefully applying sooty eyeliner and shimmering eye shadow to his lids in a color that matched the shirt and caused his kaleidoscopic irises to flash blue one moment, green the next. Sherlock was determined that John should suffer some of the torture that today’s waiting had inflicted on him, and seeing him in the audience looking like some kind of David Bowie wannabe would drive his lover a little bit mental. He couldn’t wait to see John’s face.
“Aha! We have an ID of the victim. Luca Romano, formerly of New York.” He groaned. “Dear god, he is the most stereotypical mob enforcer I’ve seen outside of those ridiculous films you were always watching. He might as well have been cracking his knuckles while wearing a bad suit and telling people he’s ‘goddan offuh yooo caahnt refyoose!’”
John awoke the next day feeling tired. He had spent a comfortable afternoon with Rosie and Sherlock, heading indoors after John started to worry about Rosie’s fair skin, and even Sherlock was showing a little color. They had talked some more about John’s appointment with Duck, and what being in counseling would be like. John didn’t feel comfortable raising Sherlock’s hopes, and stayed guarded on the whole topic. Sherlock seemed to take that as self-conscious pessimism on John’s part and tried, in his own emotionally tone-deaf way, to encourage him as he left for the evening, Rosie asleep against his shoulder.
“I think he’ll see me,” Sherlock replied with unruffled confidence. “I have some business to discuss with him.”
Marjorie regarded John with wide eyes as they turned to walk back toward the school. “Sorry about that,” John said, letting the boys get a bit ahead, then leading her back to the building. “They’re not the brightest, those two.”
Silence fell between them for a painfully long minute, John flexing and releasing his hands while Sherlock stared at him.
Sherlock looked up, and with one of his Mona Lisa smiles, climbed to his feet. His laser-like gaze was already sweeping John from head to toe, and he stepped forward to enclose John in a comfortable embrace without a word.
John bristled defensively. “What? No, no, of course not. What people do together is none of my business, as long as it doesn’t land them in my surgery.” He was disconcerted by the very direct tone of the question.
John was pleased to see he’d been correct; when they made it to the far corner of the structure, it was clear their slingshot sniper had set up there and not up another level. There were another set of scratched marks in the iron of the vertical girder that formed the corner of the building, as well as an area of damp footprints, too smeared to be discernible, but clearly tracks of fresh mud from the site below.
He shook John a little in his earnestness. “I couldn’t know what it felt like, you see. I’d never lost anyone important, just my dog, as a child, and that was horrible and upsetting enough that I turned away from sentiment to avoid feeling like that ever again; I couldn’t cope with it. For the most part, it worked. But then you… in my arms, John, you…” his grip tightened, almost to the point of pain, and John brought his own hands up to grasp straining wrists, swiping his thumbs back and forth soothingly.
“Oh, yeah. Well, my sort-of, not-really stepbrother, Marjorie’s little brother Stephen, is getting married for the third time. If I was chuckling, it’s because after this Harry won’t let me hear the end of how I ‘taught Stephen to charm the ladies, and now look at him!’” John wiped a hand over his face and shrugged his discomfiture. “I might have coached him on asking a girl to dance at a family wedding, once. I had nothing to do with the wives. I don’t think I even met the second one.”
and she placed a sparkling, deadly-looking stiletto heel onto the dancer’s bent leg. He mimicked a dizzy spell at the contact, and Sherlock felt unaccountably angry at the dancer for being so close to her, having her touch on him. Lady Grey - and John - were
He covertly observed John in the mirror as his friend emerged, clean-shaven and scrubbed, dressed already in the trousers and shirt from his new suit. The waistcoat, jacket and tie awaited John on the bed, and he stepped over to them with an absent look on his face.
Sherlock huffed and rolled to face the back of the sofa, tightening his dressing gown over his hips and digging his bare toes into the cushion. His brow furrowed a bit as he contemplated the dark times.
Sherlock opened for him inelegantly, awash in competing sensations of the hand in his hair, the supple friction of kissing, the growing hardness pressed against his hip. John’s tongue slipped in and stroked his tongue lightly, teasingly, encouraging Sherlock to reciprocate. John’s leg drew forward to press the bed between Sherlock’s legs, pressing their bodies more fully together. Sherlock could feel John’s erection against his hip and his own pressing into John’s thigh. His abdominals tensed, pressing him harder against John’s solid muscle, and he breathed out a faint moan. Dear God, that felt… he did it again. Oh…
John felt his lips pull into a half-smile, and sent Sherlock a link of a wrist-mounted slingshot, with triple-strength elastic tubing and high-tech carbon-fiber body, complete with arm brace and optional screw-down tripod.
His opponent bucked like a wild horse, trying to shake John off and keep fighting. John managed to take Spike with a vicious uppercut to the chin, slamming his head back and cracking it audibly against the unforgiving floor. Spike went limp, dazed by the thumps to his skull. John rolled him over and knelt on his back to keep him down while he looked frantically around for Sherlock.
The silence stretched again, Duck seeming content to move and look about them. John jogged along a little longer, then ventured, “when I first came back from Afghanistan, I wasn’t sure I’d ever be able to run again.”
John was uncharacteristically quiet in the morning, deep in his own thoughts in a way that made Sherlock want to crack open that silvering head and see what was going on inside. (“Bit not good, that,” “Shut up, John.”) He was the one who was supposed to not speak for days, but John had hardly said a word when he returned to the room last night; merely performing his ablutions, wishing him goodnight, and going right to sleep. And now this morning, he had said good morning like he was a long way away, then disappeared into the bathroom to shower and start getting ready for the wedding.
“Just show up. You’ll get the hang of it soon enough. It’s the ‘gentle’ class, good for beginners and those who need to take it easy. I’ll warn you though - there’s a pair of octogenarians in the class who will whip your arse for you!” She laughed merrily. “They’ve been coming for years, but the slower pace works for them.”
“It’s enough to be his best friend?” Duck asked with carefully mild curiosity, propping his chin on his curled fists which were braced on his knees.
Sherlock offered John a cup of water with a straw without asking, and when John was done sipping, he took John’s limp hand again, clasping it more firmly. “Rest now, John. Amina has young Watson in hand, and I will be here when you wake up.”
Sherlock did as instructed without comment, perhaps impressed into compliance by John’s businesslike description of the perils of falling. Once John was satisfied, Sherlock indicated the path ahead with a raised eyebrow as if to say ‘now may I get on with it?’
Over the next few weeks Lestrade kept them quite entertained with a series of escalating street robberies that culminated in a chase on foot, then on ‘borrowed’ bicycles, and lastly over the rooftops of some disreputable row housing. Lestrade had been left panting in their dust as Sherlock and John scrambled up a fire escape after their surprisingly nimble perpetrator, who had been disguised as an old man missing a leg. As it happened, the leg was not missing, merely folded up tight, and the old fellow was a 25-year-old former track star who had gotten himself entangled in a drug scheme. They might not have caught him except he hadn’t had as much experience on rooftops as his pursuers, and didn’t see the missing shingle before he stepped on it and put his leg down into an attic. Sherlock and John skidded to a stop nearby and dissolved into wheezing laughter. Sherlock left their swearing, shouting culprit stuck in a hole, with a text to Lestrade to come get the thief and bring a roof patch while he was at it. John’s shining eyes as he read the text and giggled uncontrollably were fantastic. He put them in the front of John’s display in his mind palace.
Sherlock smiled, and moved his gentle massage to the muscle of John’s calf, which twitched at the contact. John groaned his approval, flexing the foot back and forth and rolling it at the ankle once Sherlock released it to give the same treatment to the other foot.
Before he could stop himself, Sherlock had taken John’s hand and given it a gentle squeeze. He was about to let go, shocked at his audacity and starting to come up with an apology, when John’s fingers tangled with his and squeezed back. John shot him a grateful look, tinged with surprise, and Sherlock realized with startled glee that he was
Clara noticed his grimace as he took his new sister-in-law for a dance while Harry made another run at the bar. “That girl’s making you nervous, isn’t she?” Clara said. “She’s been staring at you all night. Even my mother’s noticed, and she’s half pissed by now.”
“Only, you used an interesting word choice a minute ago, y’see, John.” Duck spoke as gently as his ravaged throat would allow. “You said ‘the person who made the accusation.’ You get accused of a crime, John. You’re accused of doing something wrong. Which made me wonder whether there might be room for some more thinking there.” Duck leaned back into his chair, lessening the intensity of his body language as he delivered this pronouncement, but John was still floored by what he said.
John’s expressive eyes drew down in concern. “Marjorie, I think you might have gotten the wrong impression. I didn’t say what I did so that you would wait for me.” He huffed for a moment and collected his thoughts. “I want you to turn your attention to someone else, who can appreciate you for yourself. I can’t give that to you. The best outcome is that we both find other people who are perfect for us, and don’t have to settle for each other just because we turned a year older. Do you understand?” John fervently hoped this little speech did the trick; he did not find it easy to speak about his feelings, and even less so when he had to let someone down. Marjorie’s face fell, and after a moment she took a deep breath.
“Ah, brilliant! How could you possibly have seen that?” he said in a strained voice before confining more giggles behind his hand.
Sherlock had stalked to the door and shut it pointedly on the woman’s pink-shod heels. Then he whirled and groaned in a theatrical way, returning to John’s bedside and slumping in the guest chair pulled up close. He rolled his head against the chair back until it pointed in John’s direction. “I’m having second thoughts about this place after meeting that... person,” he complained. “Perhaps Mycroft is having his little joke, putting you here where the staff has been so carefully vetted by his people. It would be like him to instruct them to vex me incessantly.” Sherlock’s face settled into a petulant frown as he contemplated his brother’s possible culpability in the pink nurse’s irritating presence.
John had been observing Spike’s return, and couldn’t help but see his expression as his boss blithely threw this comment at him. As obvious as street signs, the emotions were passing across the big man’s face: surprise, guilt, anger; each chased across, then settled into stoic implacability. John saw his own death written there, and Sherlock’s.
, and was utterly lost. There was his John, hair swept back from his forehead, blue eyes picking up sapphire lights from the tie at his throat, his skin honeyed by contrast to the dark collar of his shirt, his fit body hugged and flattered by the lines of the pale grey suit. His expressive face entreated Sherlock while his sturdy hand beckoned. Sherlock felt like he was floating as he took John’s hand and rose from his chair. They stepped out to the floor, and John said sheepishly, “you’d best lead; it’s been a long while since I danced.”
“Not at all.” Sherlock reassured her. He wanted to keep her talking; the clicks of deductions were ticking away in the back of his head the more she spoke. “So, when did he fall ill? Richard, I mean.”
“So, that was Sherlock,” Duck began, once they had sat down in their usual places. “He’s taller than I imagined, actually.”
“John –“ Sherlock growled, embarrassed and aroused all at once. He shut his eyes and dropped his head back, chin to the ceiling. “Just – I don’t know how to do this, John.”
Duck’s eyebrows climbed his forehead in surprise at the sudden change in tone of their conversation. “John, your shirt says ‘I Don’t Shave for Sherlock Holmes.’”
“Sort of. I’ve wanted this, John. For so long.” Sherlock huffed another breath. John’s arms squeezed him tighter for a moment.
John seemed to remember such a thing, but vaguely, as if he had thought about it but not actually done it. Abruptly anger flared in his chest, and equally fear, though of what he wasn’t sure. Both found a focus in Sherlock. “That wasn’t a free pass to come in whenever you like, damn it!” He threw up his hands and paced again, words spewing forth almost without conscious thought. “You don’t live here, and I thought you were an intruder - I could have killed you, Sherlock, can you get that through your massive brain? What right do you have to come and go in my house whenever you like?” John rounded on Sherlock, causing his friend to flinch back from his rage, face white and stricken. “I’m a trained killer, you goddamn idiot, and you can’t know what I’ll do if you surprise me. What if I went for my gun instead of jumping you? I could have blown your head off!”
“Amen to that,” Duck said fervently. “I’ll take truth over bullshit every time.” Sherlock’s eyes narrowed, and he shifted his weight in a sort of hip-swaying posture that John knew well; it presaged the torrent of deductions that were always true, but almost never flattering. John figured he’d better step in before things got out of hand.
“You’re the one who always tells me we need food for these ‘escapades,’” Sherlock indicated the air quotes with his eyebrows, “and even I know the heat will do you good. I think you should eat.”
“Of course I got you the pants. You can’t wear a suit like that with shabby undergarments. It’s disrespectful.”
They stared at each other for long moments, neither seeming able to break the stalemate. At last Sherlock said, “may I help you change?”
Sherlock smiled serenely, his head nodding. “How many flannel-wearing delinquents did we see head into the grove of trees, John?”
Toward dawn, the dreams seemed to change and calm; an enormous hand grasped his own as he moved through the dreamscape, and although everyone still looked to him to solve the nameless problem, while his hand was warmly clasped, he was grounded and confident, capable of meeting whatever the mysterious trouble was.
John rested against Sherlock’s shoulder, rocked gently by the quiet sobs of his best friend, who was begging him to stay, please, don’t go;
“I knew it then. The fear, the pain of losing someone I -” Sherlock averted his eyes, his voice coming more strangled as he continued. “I know what that feels like, now. And today you said, up on the building, that you had seen my brains out on the pavement once and out of nowhere it occurred to me that was what you must have felt that day at Bart’s, and perhaps even while I was gone.” John’s biceps were released, and he was gathered into Sherlock’s embrace and held tightly. “I didn’t really know, and,” he hitched a breath, then another. “I’m sorry.” His voice was thick and muffled from where he pressed his cheek against the top of John’s head.
“Hmm?” he said, trying for nonchalant and failing by a mile. The sound squeaked in his throat and he covered it with a cough, dropping his eyes to the side.
John smiled at him indulgently. “Actually, that one’s not mine. I found it in the back of the wardrobe the first night I was here.” He smirked. “Some other sod must’ve smuggled in a phone and then forgotten it there.”
“You look… your face, it… looked like there was something.” Sherlock’s eyes were huge and deep in the dim light, soft with concern. “What were you thinking, just now?”
They sat for a few minutes, not looking at each other, not speaking, hands clasped. John cast his mind back over the morning, and the talk he’d had with Duck. How he’d realized what a unique place he held in Sherlock’s life (and heart?) and that he’d almost stolen that from his friend.
“It aches now and then, and I could swear I can feel my toes sometimes, even though they’re long gone. I need to pay attention to the skin, make sure it’s not rubbing or getting irritated under the sleeves I wear. But for the most part, the running is more comfortable than it’s ever been, now that I’ve got a vacuum attachment and this running blade. Much better than on a pegleg, more bounce, more give to it.” As they talked, Duck had been increasing the pace until they were moving along at a good clip, keeping an eye on how John was keeping up.
John fit him perfectly, Sherlock couldn’t help but think. He was shorter, but that meant Sherlock could rest his chin on top of John’s head. His arms reached most of the way around John’s shoulders, and when he spread his hands on John’s back, he could feel the muscles along John’s spine adjusting to support the new position. He could feel John’s hands doing the same, splaying from under one arm up over his shoulder and the other over his spine. They both were still rather wooden, and there was a bit of space between them, so nothing was pressing into… anything, thank God. But John’s body was firm, and his warmth came through almost immediately, everywhere they were touching. John’s hair smelled like rosemary shampoo.
Sherlock’s voice dropped, and John had to strain to hear his reply. “I surprised John out of a sound sleep, alright? I should have known better than to creep up on him in the dark, and him, a soldier. Of course he lashed out when he sensed someone in the room who he didn't expect. It’s not his fault; he’s dealing with a lot right now and he just gets angry, and I know that, and it’s fine. He didn’t even know it was me. I’ll be more careful in future.”
John’s mouth opened to retort indignantly, and he felt his cheeks heat up, but no words formed in his mind. He tried again - nothing.
John looked at the facing page for the initial forensic report. “Catastrophic skull fracture over the left ear,” he mused, then looked up at Lestrade. “Says there was a hammer partially under the body? Isn’t that your murder weapon, then?”
John, ungraceful and loopy, was dragging his feet, grabbing at cars - doing his best to hinder her attempt to take him. Sherlock couldn’t help but feel a swell of pride, however poor the timing; his soldier, never giving up, fighting to the last. John was protesting as he struggled, his words blurring with the drug in his system. “tha’s stupid, Marjorie. We w’juss kids!” he picked at the tight grip on his hip, trying to pry away her hands. “Said ‘f we werr… ‘lone. ‘M’not alone.” They both went over in a tangle of limbs as he flailed. Marjorie emitted a shriek on the way down.
Coming down post orgasm, however, Sherlock would remember that he would never have John that way, that even the little intimacies they were practicing this week were only pretend, and would end after the weekend. His replaying of favored moments took on a discouraged, desperate flavor in the wee hours of the morning, and he would slip into sleep with a hand pressed tightly to his scar.
John’s mouth worked soundlessly for a moment, then he dropped his head into his hands. “Yes,” he said. The word emerged small and defeated from behind his palms.
“I have always cared very much for John, from the first,” he found himself saying. So it was to be the truth, then – he wondered what was possessing him to say this now? “But I had almost no experience with caring, or with feelings – always thought they were a weakness and tried to stamp them out in myself.” He looked intently into his coffee so as not to see John’s face as he spoke. “I didn’t realize what it was I was feeling until much more recently, and then circumstances got in the way. So, if it is a surprise, it’s that I can be honest with John now, when I couldn’t before or didn’t understand.” He couldn’t resist peeking aside at John to gauge his reaction. Bemused, fond, and intent in a way Sherlock couldn’t interpret.
Lestrade met them just inside, and led the way deeper into the site with little discussion. They stuck to what looked like the access path for heavy trucks leading toward the structure and several stacks of I-beams waiting to be raised. Sherlock was spinning as he walked, trying to get a sense of the surroundings as they moved through the late afternoon light. In the course of his revolutions he leapt a wide puddle, landing lightly on the other side with an unconscious pirouette. Lestrade caught John’s eye, indicating the graceful form with a ‘get a load of that, eh?’ smirk. John smiled weakly back; the lithesome movements had reminded him forcefully of lean muscles he’d felt through Sherlock’s shirts during recent hugs, and he swallowed against the rush of heat he was feeling.
John squirmed in his chair. Thinking about being back home, playing with Rosie, going on cases with Sherlock, even just talking to Amina or Mrs Hudson, filled him with uncomfortable shame.
For his part, Sherlock was staring into space, blinking rapidly, his mind awhirl with John’s statement. John had told someone (anyone!) that he was together - meaning
“No, John,” Greg’s eyes were warm and brown in the horrible fluorescent lights. “That’s just it - you don’t have to, if you don’t want to. If you’re not ready.” He clapped a hand to John’s shoulder, squeezing gently.
During this time, John began to exhibit a new pattern of behavior toward his laptop. Sherlock, who missed little when it came to John, hadn’t put the pieces together until they had finished with Lestrade, though the symptoms had been scattered through those weeks. It started small, just an irritated huff or a tightening of the lips when he would open up the screen, or an unusually firm closing of the cover when finishing up. These little tics intensified as John and Sherlock resumed the routines of their life – John opening the laptop, looking at it for only a moment or two, then clacking it closed again; occasionally looking at it like it might bite him, whether it was on or not; clearly having to make himself get on it and hammer away. He also stopped leaving it around the common spaces of the flat as often, bringing it up to his room with him or even taking it to work a few times. It puzzled Sherlock; he observed these little oddities in his usually composed friend and turned them over in his mind like one might run a worry stone through their fingers. He found dwelling on John, any facet of John, soothing and absorbing.
John frowned. What was all that about? Was he figuring out something was up with John? Was he figuring out
Sherlock uttered a sound of purest frustration and headed for the stairwell to the guest rooms, using his long legs to cover the distance as rapidly as possible without running. Not the best idea to be turned out by security before he had found John.
“Was, you say? What has happened to her?” Davies leaned forward, displaying the first interest John had seen on his face since they arrived.
With a rush of frigid air, the door to the sauna swung wide. Sherlock burst in, already speaking at a breakneck pace and brandishing his phone. “Ah, at last, John. I had a devil of a time finding you hiding in here. This is fascinating, and I need to you look at it-” he finally looked up from his mobile to see John, towel clutched in his lap, glaring indignantly at him. “John!” he exclaimed, blinking rapidly but seemingly unable to look away. “You erm, you're -”
Sherlock paused, perhaps expecting John to have questions. John nodded yet again, then passively waited for him to resume talking; nothing he had said was a surprise, except perhaps that Sherlock had unbent enough to go to Mycroft for help.
John staggered back to the other side of the table, anger full in him with nowhere to go. He lunged for the bowl of cereal and hurled it at the cupboards, the plastic bouncing and leaving a splatter of wet paste. Still seething, he seized his mug and sent it following, tea spraying everywhere and ceramic shattering, then stood, breathing hard, hearing his baby screaming in fear and distress.
“I’m not so sure,” John confessed. “I haven’t really spoken to anyone except Sherlock, since I... got in here.”
“John?” At the sound of this name, John shook himself out of the increasingly panicked reverie he had fallen into. Sherlock had stepped close, and was regarding him in the mirrored window; their gazes met in the glass. A stray curl had fallen across his friend’s high forehead. John pictured himself stretching out a hand to brush it back into place and, with a shiver, took a step away from temptation.
To his surprise, Sherlock slowed his pace until John had caught up with him. “Where on the structure would be the best spot for a clean shot, John?” he asked as John came up to his side.
John’s intriguing nibbling of Sherlock’s collarbone stilled. “I’m sorry, what?” He said breathlessly.
And now… now his father was long dead. John had been places; seen and done and lived through things that would have made that bastard shit himself with fear. What right did a person long dead have to dictate John’s life now? How dare he, that piss-poor excuse for a father - for a man - still be messing with John’s mind after all these years? Anger rose in John’s throat and he pushed down the urge to yell obscenities or punch something. Such demonstrations wouldn’t help him now, in the middle of the night with the nursing staff just around the corner; they’d only get him held here in the facility until the staff felt he was more stable.
John was indeed at work, and wouldn’t be home for some hours. For form's sake, Sherlock dashed off a text - 'Home now. Protective gear was a good idea; no repeat of the pig incident.' - and pictured John's smirk when he received it. The flat was silent and held a ghost of the emptiness that Sherlock hated. He considered his options. He could write up the results of his experiments for his blog. While that was interesting, he found writing up experiments while explaining them to John to be much more stimulating. Having to go over the parts that were obvious to him but opaque to John meant his results were received more positively by the small following his blog maintained. While he scoffed that his readers, mostly forensic techs and researchers, should be able to follow his reasoning without any hand-holding, empirical evidence demonstrated that his articles were better understood when he had John to vet the results. The reduction in asinine requests for clarification was worth having to wait a few hours to get to the writing.
Most of the guests had filtered into the room by now, and the wedding party milled in the foyer waiting to be announced. The bar was doing brisk business. Sherlock looked around and indicated the situation to John. “Into battle,” he said for John’s ears only. John nodded in understanding and squeezed his hand briefly.
“A few months after that. He had been not quite himself for a while – trouble sleeping, feeling run down, you know. He got rashes, too, on his skin, and then his blood pressure went up, and his heartbeat got irregular, I think Marjorie said. In the end his kidneys failed and he passed in his sleep in the hospital just after he was admitted. Marjorie was right with him through it all. Quite the stiff upper lip, she had. I don’t think I could have held up as well as she did, if it were my Tim to go so fast.” She looked morosely into her glass, then searched for her husband on the dance floor; his turn with the bride had just ended and he was making his way back to the table. She held her hand out to hurry him along.
John jogged along for a few meters before answering, lost in thought. “Yeah, actually. I met a person who changed my life.”
Sherlock said nothing; he was still recording everything he could about John in this moment, and absently brought his fingers to his lips to taste the fluid there. Salty, somewhat bitter. Viscous, almost sticky. It was not unpleasant, though he couldn’t say he liked it, per se. John opened his eyes just then, and widened them at the sight. “That… is incredibly sexy.” He said in a hushed voice. “God, you gorgeous creature – your turn now; lie back, please, let me, let me…” As he spoke, he sat up, ignoring the mess on his stomach to help Sherlock lay down, then pressed his own body against a lanky flank. Strong arm muscles flexed and sturdy fingers tickled his pubic hair as John’s hand swept up the length of his cock, stroking firmly, then again.
"Well, until one comes to our door, you're going to have to cope. Can't you, I don't know, go work out or something? Practice swordplay, or Baritsu?" Sherlock speared John with a look. "Not my gun, Sherlock, it's not an option."
“This is - yeah.” John scrubbed a hand across the back of his neck. “This is really nice, Sherlock. Thank you.” He caught himself just as he began to move; he very much wanted to hug his friend in that moment, both in gratitude for the gesture, and because the faint blush and uncertain expression on his friend’s face was so appealing.
This chapter exists because Lumin57 didn't give up on this fic. Thank you, friend - knowing that someone is waiting and wishing has kept me chipping away at it whenever I am able.
Sherlock moved from his chair to the sofa and wondered if he might need a brisk walk himself; his thoughts crowded one another, all clamoring for attention, one on top of the next. One thought stood out among the rest: if he had thought it would be difficult to watch as John married another person (and it was, it had been excruciating) how then would it be to have John, at least a little, and then have to return to the ‘just flat mates and best friends, not more’ of their daily lives? He found himself taking slow, deep breaths as he sank into his mind palace to deal with the cacophony. Perhaps John’s calming ritual would work for him this time.
“Would you like more water? The nurse said they’d bring you something to eat whenever you wanted.” Sherlock came back with the ubiquitous cup-and-straw, and John obediently sipped. Another feature of hospital stays John abhorred; eating and drinking became the highlight of your days. Even using the toilet was an event. When nothing was happening to you, anything you could occupy your mind with assumed increased importance to stave off the boredom.
Lestrade had come up beside the foreman now, and was speaking quietly to him, wearing his best ‘this is serious business, let us get on with it’ expression. John left them to it, and snagging another harness for Sherlock, he shuffled down the beam with the hangers attached to his ropes clanking along the steel behind him.
Aunt Brigid returned in a rush, this time to collect Marjorie for more photographs. “Come along dear. Leave these two lovebirds to each other. They have years to make up for!” Aunt Brigid was clearly tipsy now; she actually patted Sherlock lightly on the cheek as she made her declaration.
“Don’t call me dat!” a switchblade had appeared in Spike’s hand like magic, and he gripped it tightly.
John smiled easily. “I knew it. Well, that’s great, lads. How about ten extra laps of the track at tomorrow’s practice, then? That’s the best place for enthusiasm like that.” His teammates blinked as the words sank in. “I’ll see you there. Oh, and you know - if you had asked nicely, she might have helped you with your notes. Try that next time, yeah?” He nodded firmly. “Best get off to the lockers to clean up, then. If you feel like me after today’s practice, you’ve got mud in places even your Mum’s never seen.” Jones and Fitzhugh guffawed and turned to go, sniggering about crude places where one or the other might be hiding mud.
The rest of the trip went smoothly after that, though Sherlock had to turn aside and breathe deeply more than once as John tried on one of the cashmere jumpers or some casual trousers. He had quite severely underestimated the effects of the opportunity to pay such focused attention to John’s body. John’s lovely, lean, fit body with its sculpted arms, muscular legs and toned arse, now actually discernible in decently tailored slacks. Sherlock was rather spoiling the line of his own trousers after an hour of smoothing seams over John’s strong chest and ogling John in several different, very flattering outfits. He had never been so grateful for his long coat.
Duck trotted back to John, looking him over critically. “Yeah, I reckon you’re off your game, mate,” he said calmly. “Why don’t we head back to my office and stretch, and if you’re anxious for more work, we can do a few asanas.” He clapped John on the shoulder and grinned a little bit too wide at the prospect of indulging in some yoga. John groaned, and Duck snickered at his antics. “Come on now, don’t be like that,” he continued, prodding John along the path toward the turn off that led back to the facility, “a lot of these poses build muscle along with stretching you out, you know that.”
A moment later, John was climbing behind his lanky friend, glad of his grip-soled hikers on the wobbly planks. How Sherlock kept his feet with thin leather soles was a source of endless mystery to John, but he seemed as comfortable at height as he did on the ground, swinging gracefully from the scaffolding to the beams and walking along them as casually as a cat. John bit back a demand that Sherlock be careful, certain all it would earn him would be a scathing look. He cautiously stepped onto the beam himself with a tight grip on the vertical steel at his side, then realized it was solid and a bit wider than his foot - nothing like the balance beams he’d walked in phys ed as a kid. The steel girders were marked with dusty footprints from many feet, coming and going along the beams in scuffling paths.
John waved wryly, shaking his head at such enthusiasm, “yeah, see you.” He headed toward the lifts, where Sherlock was impatiently waiting. He felt his face crease in a smile.
John Watson’s parents died when he was 14. John’s father had been drinking as usual, as had his mum; what was unusual was that they were out of the house, at a company party for his father’s factory job. His father wrapped their battered hatchback around a tree in the early hours of the morning. By the time the car was found by police, both his parents were dead. John comforted himself with the thought that they likely hadn’t suffered long, and ignored the tiny feeling of relief that he wouldn’t feel his father’s drunken fists ever again.
. Kissed him with a bit of challenge in those blue eyes, and with lips slightly chapped but pliant and sweet, shaping into a pout from their earlier laughter. Already he wanted it again, ever the addict.
Then Spike, splattered with gore, rose from his victim to face the two men left in the room. “I’ve done it again, now. Killed someone,” he said woodenly, holding up the dripping knife.
“Good morning, John.” Sherlock replied, attention captured by the half-lidded eyes, the relaxed smile. John was lovely just then. He wasn’t sure what to do next; what was the protocol when your pretend boyfriend became your real (more than) friend? He settled for touching John’s jaw with gentle fingertips. “How are you feeling?”
“Er,” John hedged. He’d have to get right up close to Sherlock to get a line on the shot. “Are you sure that’s a good idea?”
Sherlock considered a moment, seeming about to speak, then changed his mind as another breeze ruffled his curls. “No,” he said shortly.
And it was offered, almost every day thereafter. The next afternoon, Sherlock had arrived with Rosie to find John wilted and distraught after an emotional session with Duck where they had discussed his being shot and invaliding out of the army. No matter how he tried to think of something else, John kept coming back to the hopelessness he had felt when the nightmares were unceasing and there seemed to be nothing for him except his limp and the dim bedsit with the drawer where he kept his gun.
“John?” A long-fingered hand grasped his bicep and squeezed; Sherlock stepped into his line of sight, brow wrinkled in concern. John desperately wanted to lean in and be sheltered by the tall body and enveloping coat, perhaps for the rest of the afternoon.
Sherlock’s elfin grin slid off his face as his jaw loosened with the familiar “ah-HA!” expression. His eyes widened and, though unfocused, flicked back and forth at unseen things. “Goliath, yes!” His big hands came up and clutched at John’s where it still laid against a lean chest, then John was unexpectedly caught up in an enthusiastic hug, all wiry arms and flapping coat and muscled front against John’s cheek. He was enveloped by warm air scented of Sherlock, and gasped in a surprised breath of it. “John, that’s it!” his friend was saying. “That’s how he was killed!” John felt a pressure on the top of his head briefly, though Sherlock had no hands to be patting him with, then the madman was spinning away in one of his paroxysms of deductive ecstasy.
“You’re a very good kisser, John. You’ve clearly honed your skills.” Sherlock delivered in his drollest deadpan. (
Convincing John of this fact turned out to be more difficult than Sherlock expected; John was righteously furious at Sherlock’s injury and Mary’s seeming lack of remorse for causing it. It took considerable and increasingly less subtle manipulation on Sherlock’s part to get his friend to see reason. Sherlock had pointedly ignored the flare of warm satisfaction John’s stubborn loyalty inspired; just a twinge from the healing wound, clearly.
Behind him, a satisfied ‘Ha!’ sounded. He spun, to see Sherlock putting on his coat. “Something up?” he asked.
Sherlock let out a breath he had been holding for far too long. He sucked in air as all around him the room erupted with whistles, cheers, and thunderous applause; the crowd had gone utterly wild for Lady Grey tonight. The lights came back up, and the performers for the first act of the show came out to take their bows. Lady Grey, striding effortlessly in her towering heels, acknowledged the standing ovation and shouts of approbation with her usual flair, waving into the crowd and puckering smooches at her especial favorites. After a moment, while she stepped forward with a murmured word to accept a bouquet from a stage hand by the footlights, she looked over at Sherlock to send him a lascivious wink and a blown, deep maroon-colored kiss. Sherlock mimed catching it and returned his own, entirely unselfconscious in this moment of connection with his lover, his amazement and admiration written plainly on his face. Dear god, how he adored John!
He returned for another, then another, each kiss more heated than the last until they were smearing lips over each other’s faces, sucking at tongues and moaning, fingers clutching at the muscles of each other’s backs. John’s blunt fingers traveled down, tracing Sherlock’s long spine vertebra by vertebra, then scrabbling at the waistband to his trousers. “Sherlock,” John gasped between kisses, sounding desperate, “please, Sherlock, let me see you, let me touch you, please, please.”
The paramedics barreled up, sirens wailing, and assessed the situation as they broke out their gear. The two technicians spoke urgently back and forth, and John heard enough of their dialogue to realize their patient was in a bad way. “Lung collapsing,” said one, “Ribs likely broken,” said the other; “this arm is broken.” “Nose, too. Jaw possibly dislocated.” “Christ, check for internal injuries.” “Possible kidney rupture; looks like a kick.” “How many attacked him, did they say?” “Never mind, let’s get him to the A&E, right now!”
He was dismayed at how long it had taken him to identify that the fundamental difference between his vision and the disappointing reality was John’s absence. John was living with Mary, not at 221B, and therefore 221B did not feel like home. The flat felt warmer when John would visit. It felt just like old times when they played that silly drinking game with the sticky notes on John’s stag night. Then cold and dull again after the wedding; Sherlock had connected the dots that night at the reception, when he realized John and a pregnant Mary would have obligations – an entire new person! – which would take precedence over Sherlock. There was no hope of 221B feeling like home again, and the emptiness of it had sat heavily in his chest.
“I think I understand, John. You’re right, and I will look for someone to love who can love me back. He couldn’t be as wonderful as you, of course. But… but if things turn out that we’re both alone when I turn forty… we still have your promise to fall back on, right? You’re not taking it back, are you?” Marjorie’s fingers clamped tight on his hand where they clasped in the dance, and her eyes seemed to bore into his own.
John was comfortable in his spot against the pillows, drowsy with fatigue and the warm sunlight coming in through the big window. Just thinking about the possibility of a nap caused him to crack a huge yawn, which noticeably startled his fidgeting friend. “I dunno, Sherlock, I might want to have a bit of a nap, and then do what you suggested; just walk in the garden later.” He stifled a second yawn with the back of his hand, and continued speaking. “I don’t know if it’s wise to go digging up all the little dramas in a place like this - these people are in charge of my food and my medications, after all. It wouldn’t do to rile them up too much.”
When he glanced up, Sherlock had considerately turned to look out the window, finding something in the garden to stare at. John noticed his cheeks were a bit pink, probably from all the snickering, the prat. John briskly toed off his trainers and dressed in fresh pajamas, unconcernedly dropping trou to slip into the bottoms and picking up the jogging pants to put in the laundry bin.
Duck’s smile never wavered. “Yeah, definitely.” He clapped John on the shoulder and squeezed, Sherlock observing the interaction intently. “John, you’re free to go, and I’ll see you tomorrow.” He picked up the papers, looking over the signatures and shuffling them back into the folder as John and Sherlock picked up John’s things and headed for the hallway.
“Hello, lads, what’s happening?” John said, observing the tableau. His teammates whirled around to face him, looking innocently nonchalant.
Duck assured him that was why they’d keep up with their meetings, frequently at first, and when John felt more confident, stepping it back to less often. “People do it at all sorts of different paces, based on their situations. We’ll keep a close eye on that.”
At NSY, the video booth was dim and quiet, and the paper cup of tea John cradled in his hands raised subtly fragrant steam against his cheeks when he blew on it. He closed his eyes for a moment to appreciate the opportunity to catch his breath after all the activity of the day.
From downstairs the front door opens, and John’s footsteps pound up the stairs in his usual efficient cadence. In Sherlock’s mind the wardrobe door slams; he spins around, dressing gown flaring, to face his friend. John comes in with a bit of color on his cheeks from the brisk wind outside, and a pleasant smile on his face. “You’re up off the sofa, I’m impressed,” he said, “Did Lestrade text?”
“I think you’re right, what you said early on in here - he really cares about you,” Duck let the sentence trail off.
he thought hopefully. A coincidental erection to the time he was looking at the picture, and not about Sherlock at all. With a mixture of anticipation and dread, John dragged his finger downward, bringing the photo into full view. He tapped it to make it fill the screen, so small to have so much impact. Again his eyes were drawn to the open collar, the defined jaw, the tiny moles on fair skin. Again his breath caught, struck by the unexpected clench of want in his belly - so new, so frightening in its implications. But there all the same.
John squinted, and yes, could see the yellowish line, crossed with brown, that might have been the hairs Sherlock was referring to. He shrugged; the hairs and scrape didn’t immediately strike him as relevant, but maybe Sherlock thought something different?
The rest of the afternoon was a revelation for Sherlock. He expected to feel inept and unnatural where casual intimacy was concerned, (not really his area) but after a stilted beginning, all he had to do was relax the hold he maintained on his impulses toward John. He ostentatiously helped John on with his coat as they got ready to leave the flat, looking him firmly in the eye as he did so. John nodded and put a hand to the small of Sherlock’s back to usher him out the door, so light as to be barely discernible.
They were neither at their most precise after the whiskey, so their aim was off a bit. What Sherlock expected to be a more lingering kiss like they had shared earlier, instead was a series of soft touches that made Sherlock’s mind spin with sensation: the lithe body in his arms, a hand sliding up his shoulder to skim into the curls at his nape and another slipping around to his lower back; John’s lips, mellow but insistent, returning for press after press against his own; John’s breath whispering past his ear, against his skin. He attempted to record it all and could not – there was too much. John’s mouth returned again, slightly wet as his lips opened and latched to Sherlock’s lower lip individually; Sherlock’s lips parted with his gasp. John’s tongue made darting little licks to each of Sherlock’s lips in turn: first top, then bottom, then top again, then dipping in for a brief taste of tongues touching, then a deeper, exploratory tangling. Sherlock realized he was ferociously hard, his erection pressing against his trousers uncomfortably. His hands had been sweeping up and down John’s spine, caressing the red cashmere and the muscles beneath; now they clutched the fabric as he clung to John.
growl rumbled in his chest, inaudible over the blaring music. His crotch throbbed. He was walking the line of pain, his body so fervently keyed up by his lover’s performance. Only John could ever affect him like this; dear god, how he adored John.
Jones, the boy holding the satchel up, was speaking. “I said, what are you gonna do about it, then, eh? I need your chemistry notes for Friday’s test, and I’m gonna take ‘em!” His companion Fitzhugh snorted and nodded along.
monologue cut off mid-word. “What do I think of him? He’s a fucking murderer, probably a hired hit man.”
Sherlock had offered twenty pounds to a shapeless figure swathed in layers of sweatshirts and dingy jackets to bring them some takeaway where they hid, and they spooned up curry straight from the cartons, relishing the heat. John shook his head at the absurdity of what they were doing, smiling a bit until it occurred to him that he might be called upon to tackle a suspect. What if he got it wrong? Hurt Sherlock again?
Sherlock blew out a breath as Lady Grey slipped from his view. Seeing her moving so sensually and the peekaboo nature of her garments had the craving in his belly flaring almost to the point of discomfort; had he ever wanted someone the way he wanted John? The Lady was beautiful and alluring, but it was the man who brought her to life, who breathed fire into her from the inside; that was who made his groin tighten and his breathing pick up. He wanted to find someplace immediately where they could be alone to peel John out of his garters and heels and worship him for hours - no, for days; until they passed out from bliss. He crossed his legs the other way over, hoping his burgeoning erection was not too noticeable.
“So, I did it. Shoveled some fucking shit,” he said roughly and shot Duck a hard look. “Like we said, you and me. I set myself to consider whether I could think of a time, of a man, who I had wanted like I wanted my women lovers - possessive, physical, hot and greedy, right? And I couldn’t. I couldn’t think of a time that I had wanted a man like that. But I got interrupted before I had really settled the question in my mind.” He brightened unexpectedly as a thought occurred to him, and exclaimed, “you were right about the sauna, by the way. It is really nice - I should find someplace to take a steam now and then; it’s fantastically relaxing.”
friend by the shoulders and was shaking him sharply to punctuate his rant. “I think I should sit down,” Sherlock suggested.
And then he stepped back, nodded smartly, and vanished up the stairs, the package of underpants in one hand.
Continued thanks for those reading along as this is posted; your encouragement has kept me writing despite a very busy time in RL. I hope this continues to satisfy! Updates will be erratic but as often as I can make them. :)
But he couldn’t stay away. With everyone he knew - including Mary - firmly in the ‘forgive-Sherlock’ camp, he had no excuse to refuse to see his ‘resurrected’ friend; then he got swept up in the whirlwind. He loved it, felt alive again, had the best of both worlds, or so he thought; Mary on one hand, Sherlock on the other, and each admiring the other, so he never had to choose.
Until he did; until Mary chose for the both of them with her assassin’s solution to her problems, and her obsessive need to keep John in the dark.
They walked along in the warm summer afternoon. The atmosphere seemed to lighten and the event was soon forgotten in the pleasant picnic and scenery.
But he was sure he had seen it, absolutely certain. Sherlock Holmes, wearing a watery, tremulous smile that spoke of deep relief. Perhaps the man hadn’t believed that Rosie could have such a profound effect on John. Perhaps he was just glad she had.
best friend, who he had only barely come to grips with having feelings for at all - let alone considering himself ready to be acting on them. Once they’d begun though, it seemed the most natural thing in the world. John couldn’t stop kissing, catching Sherlock’s soft lips -
they covered. John hadn’t been so familiar with the smell and taste of a fall mat in long years, but the two were so delighted to instruct him and impart their experience with kind words, that he couldn’t begrudge them their fun.
Sherlock looked shocked and crossed his arms petulantly. “But I’ll catch cold,” he whinged, “and anyway, we’ll only be up here for a few minutes. I’m perfectly comfortable with heights.” He waved away the offending bundle of orange strapping and buckles, but John was already shoving it back.
He wanted John to go faster, harder, and yet the heavy-lidded worship in those dark blue eyes and the reverence in John’s movements caught him and dragged him under, into the slow, sensual undulations of their lovemaking. His heart felt full, as full as his body, full of John in all the cracks and crevices that had only let in the cold before this complicated, fascinating man came to occupy them. His throat tightened and he struggled to keep his eyes open against the need to hide.
Sherlock didn’t get around to poking in John’s email until a few weeks after the ‘Vacuum-Packed Adventure’ as John insisted calling the case on his blog. There had been little in the way of diverting cases after that case wrapped up, (‘Ha!’ said John’s voice, ‘good one!’) but Sherlock had had a few email puzzles that occupied him and two new experiments on what happens to flesh when abruptly exposed to unusually low pressure. Gruesome, but very informative. He’d had to go to Bart’s morgue for the second experiment; he was right in thinking it would need a space with a drain in the floor. John had asked where he was going, thought for a moment, then calmly wished him luck and suggested he wear the protective suit for once. Good advice, when it came to it. It would have taken ages to get the bits out of his hair after the second trial reacted more vigorously than he had anticipated.
Sherlock’s brow creased as he tried to work out what John was asking. Acting? Of course he was acting, that was the point of being fake boyfriends. It was an act. Where he finally got to do all the things he wished he could do all the time with John. And where he got to experience things like John’s hand in his hair, and John’s kisses, and a passionate embrace like he had never encountered in his life and during which he had barely kept control of himself. And he got to observe John in all sorts of new situations and behaviors and be impressed with his boyfriend-shamming skills, because he was an unexpectedly good actor - but he said he was not any sort of actor. At… all. Not acting, then…?
Never taking his eyes from the video, Sherlock’s hand lifted from the trackball and waved toward the cup, nearly overturning it into some loose keyboards and electronics on the desk. John tutted and snagged the wandering hand around the wrist, then placed the tea in it and let go with a roll of his eyes. “Prat,” he tutted, “just drink it.”
time already. Usually bloody draped over the bloody sofa like a sodding Victorian lady before that starts…”
“Right. Well, she…” John huffed a sort of strangled laugh. “She’s been emailing me for the last month or two. A lot.” He still couldn’t meet his friend’s gimlet stare. “You see, when we were younger…”
“That. Is not. True!” Marjorie ranted as she disentangled herself, getting up and rooting in a blocky leather shoulder bag. “John, your wife is gone. Your family is gone. You are alone, and I am alone, and now we’re going to be together. Just like we said, years ago. I waited. I did what you asked. I didn’t intrude on your life. I found someone to love me in the meantime, and waited for when you would be mine. Then you got married, and I thought maybe… maybe I was wrong, maybe it wasn’t meant to be!” She held up a little handheld atomizer and shook it, grimacing when it seemed to be empty. She went back to rooting around. “I was glad for Richard, after that.” John groaned on the pavement and flopped over on his front, still trying to get away with his uncoordinated limbs.
“No, I think we’ve made the point rather nicely. God yes, let’s go.” Sherlock took John’s hand and led him out, heading for the stairs. John was very quiet as they ascended, and after a moment, let go of Sherlock.
John had missed dinner in his distracted state, and found himself hungry. He wandered over to the dining area, but it was deserted; the chairs placed up on the tables to leave the floor clear for the cleaning crew who came in during third shift.
Getting out of bed did nothing to assuage John’s guilty feelings. He lay on the sofa and pretended to sleep at Sherlock’s insistence once it was clear no complications would arise from their early-morning accident, his ears focused on the sounds of his friend’s scratchy breathing.
Spike lost his grip, further solidifying John’s guess that he was on something. With a roar, he lunged at Davies, knife outstretched to stab. Davies moved like a snake, but was hampered by his position in the desk chair. It tipped back with him in it, and Spike followed him down, blade flashing. There was a gurgling cry and a spray of red flew up from behind the desk. John and Sherlock exchanged a wide-eyed look; John pivoting to better cover Sherlock’s back.
They took a brief walk in the garden; the beekeeper was not in evidence today, so they didn’t linger there, but rather took a shady path lined by benches back towards the hotel. As they approached the building, Sherlock grew more apprehensive with each step. What if he disappointed John? Was terrible at this physical business? He had always dismissed it as unnecessary and had almost no experience with another person. John was obviously proficient at this form of interaction, and deserved the best a lover could do for him. Without his conscious decision, his steps began to slow, his face to frown, his brow to wrinkle. What to do? This was not something he could bluff his way through.
It took two more days of this for Sherlock to get entirely fed up. John was sat in his chair, frowning at the laptop on his knees when Sherlock stood up to go into the kitchen, where the low-pressurized decomposition experiment would be just about ready for another observation period. John smacked the laptop closed so fast it crunched a bit, then peered up at his friend, who had gone still and cold standing in front of him.
They met Aunt Brigid and Uncle Tim for lunch at one in the breakfast hall, now reset for table service with white serviettes and multiple forks and spoons. The older couple greeted them both warmly, and eyed Sherlock’s deliberately-casual arm around John’s waist with interest. They busied themselves with the menu and small talk initially, mentioning Harry wouldn’t be attending the wedding despite all Aunt Brigid’s asking, and would they be going to the mixer later? Stephen and his fiancée, Suzanne, would be making an appearance there, with the rest of the wedding party, including the fiancée’s parents and Aunt Brigid and Tim, and a fair gaggle of bridesmaids and groomsmen.
For his part, John appeared mesmerized, a deer caught in the headlights of that weighty stare. Until suddenly he looked down and to one side and actually squirmed a bit in his seat while his ears reddened. He put the laptop aside, blew out a breath and made to stand up. “Tea?” he asked.
“Haha, a long time, years, really,” he replied stepping back quickly; he was nervous, though no one except Sherlock would probably notice. “Have you met Sherlock?” He took his friend by the elbow and brought him up to his side. “Sherlock, this is Uncle Tim’s daughter, and Stephen’s big sister Marjorie. We’ve known each other since we were teenagers.”
Usually, John knew Sherlock enjoyed Amina’s bullishness, finding her unwillingness to dance around an awkward or uncomfortable topic refreshing. This morning, however, his tone was cold and his answers short.
“Good thing you can spot them, then, isn’t it?” John said softly, intimately. The gaze held a beat longer and John stroked two fingers along Sherlock’s forearm where it was braced on the bar.
“Sherlock!” John threw the paper down on the floor. “Why don't you take a walk, or a bath, or do something! Relax! I'm getting tense just sitting in the same room with you."
A third male dancer hustled onstage, as if he were rushing from place to place. He wore a buttoned-up brown tweed suit with a waistcoat and watch chain, and carried a tightly-furled umbrella in his hand. Sherlock choked a bit when he realized how much this dancer reminded him of his brother Mycroft; had John done this deliberately? It served to help him control his ardor, at least, so he would call it a result and be grateful (he coughed) for the help. Lady Grey shot him an utterly smug pout and he squirmed in his chair at the competing sensations of irritation and lust this picture had created. He had no doubt now John had done this for his benefit - and that John was enjoying his discomfiture, damn him.
“Just coming up on three, so about four-and-a-half kilometers. Feel like you’ve had enough for a first time out?”
Sherlock seemed to pause to consider John’s point, lips pursed in a cupid’s-bow pout, before he reluctantly conceded. “I suppose you’re right, but if I stumble across something really singular, really interesting, I won’t hold back on following it up.” He pulled out his mobile and swiped across the screen, preparing to log onto the WiFi, before muttering a curse when he remembered the Internet would not be available that way. He’d have to suffer the relative slowness of his cellular connection.
“Yeah,” John gasped, increasingly aware of his labored breathing and tired legs, “I really have, I think.”
He and John relaxed into their usual places, and Duck raised an inquisitive eyebrow. “So, you didn’t sleep well? Does that happen often?”
And he had gone right down the same path - lashing out when he couldn’t cope. What kind of father would do that? To his baby girl?
“Go,” he repeated, the word muffled in his pillow, tears spilling at last. He couldn’t bear to have Sherlock see him weep again.
“That doesn’t make me feel much better, you know. What the hell were you doing, coming in here in the dark, anyway?” John stood up and paced back and forth in front of the bed where Sherlock sat, elbows on his knees, and when Sherlock hesitated, he fixed the man with a gimlet stare. “Well?”
In the madness that followed, initially blurred by drugs, eventually smeared with exhaustion and the rollercoaster pace of events, Sherlock hardly had a second to contemplate his experience of the finer emotions. That didn’t stop his brain from squirreling away moments to be pulled out and examined later. John, arriving at the flat with a new haircut that had Sherlock silent and blinking for a full two minutes, heart beating frantically in his chest. John, awkwardly thrilled to have his baby tucked against him in a carrier, out for a stroll. The fond indulgence on John’s face when a grinning Sherlock looked up from scratching that bloodhound behind the ears. John’s expression when he discovered his wife was gone and his baby daughter with her; raw in a way Sherlock had never seen before, mutely pleading with Sherlock - with the world - to change the truth. He didn’t like how that moment made him feel, but he couldn’t delete it. He never could delete anything about John.
They were getting out of the cab outside New Scotland Yard when the reality of what they were about to do came crashing down on John like a load of bricks. He halted on the pavement, face pale, looking up at the building as Sherlock leaned into the cab window to pay the driver.
John’s hand came up and covered Sherlock’s where it lay on his chest. “Thanks,” he said, turning around to face his friend and keeping the long fingers in his grasp. “Thank you for doing all of this. This week has been utterly mad, but…” John started to say something else, and it seemed to catch in his throat. Sherlock waited, horribly afraid to hear what John would say next, certain it would spell the end of all his misguided hopes.
His hands worked by muscle memory, checking the chamber of the pistol to be sure it was clear, slipping out the clip and opening his top drawer to stow both pieces next to the bowl of odds and ends there. He paused, gaze arrested by the modest china bowl filled with the detritus of a doctor’s life.
John tensed in the circle of Sherlock’s arms, then pushed himself back, insisting with hands pressed against his friend’s chest to be let free. Sherlock surrendered with obvious reluctance.
Holding hands in a cab, kisses goodbye and hello, complaining about having to get reading glasses? Growing old?
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I don’t need to practice being relaxed; I need something to occupy my mind!”
John held out a hand to stop Sherlock so he could catch his breath. Jesus, was he hysterical? Maybe it had just been such a rare thing to laugh lately. “Christ, stop! ... Hammers... get whacked... maybe in the head! Sherlo... whooo!” His hand fetched up against Sherlock’s chest and he patted it as he wheezed and got himself mostly under control. “Do you have a picture of him?” he asked, rather breathlessly, then cleared his throat and continued in a more normal tone. “Not dead, I mean?
When his mobile went off a half hour later, a gleeful Sherlock declared a case was on, and he was off out to tackle it immediately. When John said he’d stay with Rosie and Amina, he received a disbelieving stare; at Amina’s snort it transfered to her with a narrow-eyed consideration. “Well, be dull if you must, far be it for me to stand in the way.” He whirled and headed for the door, his brusque “I’ll text!” echoing back just before the sound of the door closing.
An hour later, he stood beside a flustered Harry and a beaming Clara in the reception line, shaking hands and accepting congratulations for the happy pair. The wedding guests passed by in a blur, with a few standouts: Aunt Brigid and Uncle Tim, grinning and demanding John come sit with them and catch up; Stephen Penton, all grown up, with an attractive young lady on his arm; Clara’s mum, who was as lovely as Clara and had a similar fondness for bums, John discovered. He hadn’t realized he could make that particular sound, and Clara’s mum laughed delightedly. He flushed crimson, and somehow ended up agreeing to save the lady a dance. Harry widened her eyes in eloquent disgust while Clara cackled from her other side.
John blew a tired example of a snort. “Making friends,” John tried to say, though no sound came out this time.
John swallowed his irritation as he shuffled into the track pants and raised the now less-than-pristine towel to mop his face and blot the sweat from his hair. “What has gotten into you, Sherlock?” he asked, mystified by his friend’s odd behavior. “Is everything all right? Is there a case?”
“John.” Sherlock said, “this is ridiculous.” And he looked at his friend. Just looked for a full silent minute, and then sat down in his chair with his fingers steepled against his lips. His gaze never strayed from John’s face, and seemed to become heavier with each passing second.
“John,” he whispered again, and one of his huge, delicate hands came up, turning John’s face back toward him.
“And you have the whole femur intact? But removed the fibula and tibia? Or are there portions of them remaining?”
“Oh, my god!” John gasped, “Sherlock! Christ, are you alright?” he scrambled off his friend and held out a hand to help him up, urging him to sit on the bed while the man coughed and caught his breath. John’s hands trembled with adrenaline and shock at what he had almost done. “God, Sherlock, I’m so sorry. Please tell me I didn’t hurt you too badly,”
The next few days passed in a fugue of sensation, elation, and despondency for Sherlock. Elation that John seemed willing to ‘practice’ as much as Sherlock wished; his initial hesitancy growing less as they became accustomed to casual touches during their usual routine. A pat on the hip as they moved around each other, or stroking fingers as tea or a plate of toast was passed one to the other, or ushering one through a door with a hand to the small of the back. Sherlock fervently catalogued all the instances in his mind palace, marking a few themes as he went.
“Resisted treatment, and therapy,” John flashed a wry look at Duck, “for several months, then cleared up overnight, essentially, except for the muscle atrophy.”
He got up at suppertime, and gave Amina a break by making a simple pasta dinner for them before she left to teach Aikido at the dojo where she trained. Then Rosie needed a bath; John was wistfully charmed by his child’s splashing in the tub and her fascination with water scooped into a set of colorful cups and poured out again. Then it was pajamas, and a story, and a cuddle, and bed. Rosie was delighted with all of it, even the going to bed, since her stuffed elephant was waiting there for her with its blue fuzzy fabric smooth and soft against her pink cheek.
“And you’re worried what people will think, hmm?” Duck countered. “That behind your back, or right to your face, they’ll say you’re weak, less of a man, can’t cope?” His bright eyes in his lined face bored into John’s own with unforgiving intensity. “That you cracked and took the easy way out? That you’re a loser, a whiner, a pussy? That you don’t love them enough?” He leaned forward aggressively, and his ragged voice made these accusations  -
“Well, that worked better than I expected,” John remarked under his breath somewhere along the journey, and tipped his head back against the seat to shut his eyes for a bit before they had to get out and find a taxi.
They moved to the door, and John’s hand on his lower back was warm and firm as he was ushered through.
“Where one begins, you magnificent git, is with what we’ve already done. You try things, and decide if you like them. If you do, then do them again, maybe something a little different next time, maybe not. Experiment. I’m surprised you don’t already have a series of experiments planned for as soon as we get back to Baker Street, actually. And if you find things you don’t like, you say ‘stop’ in the moment, or you don’t do it again after that.” John tipped Sherlock’s chin up with two fingers, and kissed him softly. “As for being rubbish, I don’t think that’s possible. Just it being you goes a long way, with me.”
The mattress rocked again as Sherlock got up. “Amina and I are going to find the canteen and bring you some tea; whatever they’ll bring on the tray will be horrible, no doubt. We shan’t be long.” Before John could summon a rejoinder, the door was closing behind them.
Like a roll of thunder from far away, another voice spoke; coming closer, overriding the intimate urgency with dread. “Coming to your sister’s rescue, eh, Johnny? Well there ain’t no queer Watsons, you hear me? No child of mine’ll be a faggot, if I’ve got to get a dozen of my mates to give ‘er what she needs to get straightened out, that’s my right as her father!”
And he had; though he’d never dreamed he’d be a parent - it just hadn’t been on his radar, not the least bit - once he had this little being in his life he had been captivated by everything she did. Her smallest sound, her smell, her wee hand grasping his finger with surprising strength, all sank their way deep into his heart.
Sherlock’s whole body shivered and he moaned, high-pitched and heartfelt in the silence of the room. Startled, John again dropped back down on his heels to catch his breath. Sherlock wrapped himself around John, hiding his face on top of John’s head as he recovered himself, his lean chest working like a bellows with his suppressed emotion.
The thug ducked his head and scuffed a foot on the carpet. “Sorry, Spike, but we found these two up in the hallway by the door, din’t we, strolling in bold as you please. Me’n Archie stopped ‘em, but they said what they ‘ad business for ‘im.” he looked over at the bill-counter for confirmation.
“Er, no,” Sherlock said, blinking. “I’ll just…” he starts in the direction of the bathroom. The wardrobe door in his mind creaks open again, and the John-mannequin is back, dressed only in his pants, but he has a bit of color in his cheeks now and windswept hair. It’s probably best that Sherlock’s heading for the shower; once he’s dressed John in his mind palace, there are times when it is very difficult to keep from undressing him again. This seems to be one of those times. Not something he’d want John to observe on his face or in his posture, if he wants to maintain the status quo. He hurried down the hall.
Sherlock deposited Rosie on the floor of John’s room on a blanket, then turned to look at John enquiringly, hands turned out in an ‘I’m here, if you want one,’ gesture. It had taken only a moment for John to step forward and cling tightly, breathing slow and deep, smelling Sherlock’s pine-and-spice aftershave and London air in the fibers of his coat.
They watched in companionable silence for a while, as the replay of the night of the first murder rolled on. People of all sorts moved through the park: sat on the benches, explored the copse of trees, bent to smell the flowers, or leaned on the railing by the Thames - then ambled on their way as the evening drew in, never realizing that an act of deadly violence was imminent.
“What did I say, eh?” Duck said, swatting him on the bicep. “Seven-and-a-half klicks is a natural for you. At a good clip, too!” He scrubbed a hand through his greying hair, chuckling. “I’m all in a sweat!”
His phone trumpeted from the depths of the chair where he had thrown it, and he rolled off the sofa to snag it again. Probably Irene rubbing it in, but he couldn’t help the sliver of hope that John had relented and was arranging to see him before the show began. His fingers tingled as he opened the text.
“I suppose. Well, I’m not up for any more of that tonight. Can we leave this rubbish party now? Or do we need to hammer things home with Marjorie some more?”
It was after perhaps another minute of stillness that the moment ended with the loud chiming of Sherlock’s mobile. Both John and Sherlock tensed, then sprang apart as though someone had jumped into the room and yelled ‘boo!’ Neither seemed inclined to look the other in the eyes, and Sherlock lunged for his coat to see what the alert had been about. John walked to the window and willed his flaming cheeks to cool.
“Yes, he just declined and died, over about six or eight weeks. I don’t know that I ever heard they had a real diagnosis, actually. I remember the last time I saw him healthy; we had Stephen and Suzanne over to celebrate their engagement, and Marjorie and Richard came too, the whole family. We would have invited John, but it was just after… well, you know. All that business with Mary and the baby. We had to break the news at the dinner table, as I recall. So sad.” She sipped at her cocktail and sighed. “I might be a bit potted, I’m afraid. Just shush me if I’m nattering on too long.”
“Drink your tea,” John suggested, once the time stamp was rolling at 2x speed and washed out figures were scurrying back and forth across the screen. “You’re still cold.”
“And then I woke up,” he grumbled, wincing at the rusty, gravelly rasp of his voice. He was thirsty, and he needed the loo. Urgently.
What else does John do on his laptop? Read articles and news, get emails from his sister and Aunt and some distant friends, spend as little time as possible on social media, look at pictures of dogs doing supposedly humorous things. None of these had ever produced this reaction before. Of course, Sherlock could just break into the laptop and look, but that wouldn’t allow him the chance to figure it out and interesting cases had been thin on the ground since the robberies had wrapped up. More importantly, John hadn’t left it anywhere long enough for Sherlock to get his hands on it.
“…promised me, John! You said we’d be together when I was forty, and now I am, and now we. Will. Be. Together!” She interspersed her words with heaves of effort, trying to pull John along toward the last line of parked cars in the lot.
Instead, John straightened and pulled back slightly, breaking his friend’s grasp to rub at the back of his neck. “Yeah, um. Yeah. Just, y’know. First time back and all…”
“Shit,” John rasped. “Here - lean against the desk, and we’ll use my scarf to put pressure on it to stop the bleeding.”
“You tell me,” Sherlock challenged. Behind them, Jack made a tiny sound of fear. John glanced at him, turning sideways to the other two in the room to be able to look from one to the other. Jack had gone bone-white, looking at Sherlock like he was mad.
He made a sound of negation, and she knelt down to roll him over herself. John resisted as best he could, and as soon as he was on his back, put his arms over his face like a sulky child. “No! Bugger off!” he slurred. “Sh’lock… he’ll come. Save me.”
The ensemble swept in, dancing to the chorus; Sherlock absently noted a bit of Spanish in the last line - “it’s a scandal.” Certainly Lady Grey was scandalous tonight, her outfits and especially her dancing titillating him into a state of buzzing desperation. His arousal was an ache in his chest and his nethers, with no hope of reprieve for the time being. He swore that when he got John to himself, he would not let the man leave his bed for anything. A single night would not be enough to exhaust the amorous greed his lover had stirred in him with this piece of theater.
Lestrade looked down and away for a moment, then seemed to steel himself. “Sherlock, can you give us a moment, please?”
John stole noiselessly into the kitchen. Someone had cleared half the table by picking up the clutter of tea cups, Petrie dishes, beakers and toast crusts and dumping them in the sink. A sheet of paper in the space showed a lifelike pencil drawing of an ear, the model for which was arranged on a saucer to catch the best light from the window. John didn't think it was one of the ears from the head in the fridge, but couldn't be sure. The ear drawing had been modified into a letter B on the sheet, followed by carefully shaded and detailed letters O, R, I, N and G. Most of the rest of the space on the page had been filled in with Sherlock's precise writing, one word: "bored." The page had been pinned to the table with all seven of the knives from the butcher block, even the bread slicer which was blunt on the end. John wondered how Sherlock had managed that. He shook his head. This did not bode well. Sherlock had been on edge this week; living on nervous energy, tea, and nicotine patches, sleeping little if at all. The door opened at the end of the hall and Sherlock strode out, buttoning his cuff and running his fingers through damp curls. Purple shirt today, John noticed. He must really be buzzing.
Sounds were magnified in the sound-proofed room, so Sherlock’s getting up from the stool seemed to fill the space with the susurrus of shifting fabric. He came to stand in front of John, close enough that John felt the breath on his hairline.
John pursed his lips in irritation. “Well, yes. I’d need more rest and have to be careful about exercising and what I eat so as to work back to health.”
Sherlock was scrolling the footage back to an earlier point, where the group of young people in plaid flannel had disappeared into the little grove of trees. There they were, a half dozen with a straggler hurrying to catch up, moving speedily when Sherlock dialed up the playback rate. John stifled the irrational urge to hum the Benny Hill theme song and tried to figure out what Sherlock was looking for.
As they made their way, Sherlock seemed to collect himself and was soon running at the mouth in that way he had when he was bouncing ideas off John about a case. The victim had been strolling along a section of the Thames that had been cleaned up as a park, with enameled metal benches placed at intervals along neat cobblestone paths lined with sculptural shrubberies. The park sported a few CCTV cameras, and the victim had been seen strolling along, apparently unconcerned, in the early evening as skies grew dark. He then abruptly pitched back over a bench onto the lawn, presumably having received the head wound that had killed him. He was discovered a few hours later by a passing couple who sat on the bench to make out, then noticed the sprawled figure and called the authorities.
“I want that." He sighed. "I’m so sick of being fucked up, you know? Feeling like I’m hanging on by my fingernails, faking it for my family so they won’t catch on. It’s fucking hateful, feeling like that all the time.” His hands clenched each other, flesh paling to white with his grip. Duck nodded, but said nothing.
For his part, John seemed bemused by how seriously Sherlock was taking their practice. He amiably received any overtures Sherlock made with evident, or at least well-feigned, enjoyment and no sign of discomfort because Sherlock was a man, or because he was Sherlock. He was remarkably relaxed with the whole situation. When Sherlock was honest with himself, it irked him a bit. Here he was, genius consulting detective with an international reputation, all in a dither over a pretend boyfriend who was not interested in him; while said pretend boyfriend was oblivious and unaffected. And irritatingly calm. And unfairly attractive. Damn him!
What had Sherlock thought, seeing it in his drawer? John’s face heated as he thought of it - it had been folded with others in the drawer, so perhaps he hadn’t seen the text?
He found the hallway where the wedding party was situated; some rooms had doors open with small, raucous parties going on inside. Judging by the sounds coming through at least one closed door, other rooms were in use as well, though for more private parties. Sherlock knocked on the door to 308, then pounded when that produced no result. Still nothing. He held his head carefully next to the door to listen inside. Silence. Damn it!
Lady Grey had done her rounds with her usual aplomb, charming the audience members with witty anecdotes and bright laughter. They left as the lights flashed for the second act, showgirls scurrying out the doors ahead of them. Sherlock and Lady Grey walked leisurely toward John’s dressing room, hoping to avoid the crush of performers as they rushed to the stage. When they entered the tiny space, sparkly costumes and sculpted wigs scattered about, Sherlock had expected to ravage John against the door as he had so many times before - had been looking forward to it, in fact.
John looked sheepishly off to one side. “Er, yeah. In all the excitement, I seem to have missed dinner, and I’m starving. Is there anywhere I could get a snack?”
“Good, that’s good. Well, another quarter mile and we can have lunch!” Mr. Penton announced jovially. He eyed his daughter speculatively as Stephen brightened and ran on ahead; Aunt Brigid and John started along as well, while the elder Pentons lagged a few paces behind.
John had gone up to pack his new clothes for the trip after that morning’s delivery, and Sherlock heard a muted “argh!” followed by the stomping of John’s feet on the stairs.
When he arrived at Duck’s office, the man was waiting for him with a pleased smile on his face, dressed in the red trainers and worn, comfortable workout clothes. “Good morning, John,” he croaked, “are you ready to move a little?”
Sherlock clasped John’s penis in his hand, wrapping his fingers around it and gradually tightening his grip while John hissed and bucked his hips, thrusting through the tight channel. “Oh, shi-“ he rasped, “Sherlock, like that, yeah. I could… I could come just like this, oh, from your hand.” Sherlock watched, fascinated, as John undulated his torso to thrust faster, foreskin stripping back then sliding over the shiny head as it pulled back, glistening with a clear fluid. John’s hands slid up to Sherlock’s shoulders, gripping hard, his head snapping back as he groaned something that sounded vaguely like Sherlock’s name, or possibly swearing. He thrust again: once, and then his body bowed with a savage push into Sherlock’s hand, and his cock shot strings of pearly fluid over Sherlock’s fingers and onto his own straining belly. He pushed a few more times, not producing much fluid but emitting a growling whoosh of breath with each thrust, then relaxed bonelessly into the pillows, panting like he had just run a race.
As a boy, he had played with a slingshot, made from rubber bands and a forked stick he’d found somewhere, after reading about one in an issue of Boy’s Life or some such rubbish an elderly aunt had given him. His interest had lasted about a week, as it became clear that shooting accurately with the thing was almost impossible. Not only couldn’t he hit the cans he’d lined up on an old concrete barrier in a disused lot near his family’s flat, he couldn’t even hit the barrier. The pebbles he shot went off to god knows where.
he craned his head in toward the girder, leaning forward a little harder and emitting a quiet ‘hrmph’ of satisfaction when the shot lined up clear as could be from this vantage point. He drew breath to alert Sherlock to his success and was washed with the man’s scent: pine and spice in the cold, crisp air. He blew out that breath and pulled in another despite himself.
John realized. The wind deflated from the sails of his denial, his wish to ignore the things that were happening until they just went away. He had to face it, at least with Sherlock sitting there looking so earnest. John nodded shortly.
Sherlock in, by obliging him to ask favors from his brother, the man who hoarded them like treasure and called them in for reasons clear only to himself. John cringed a little inside at the thought.
John slumped back against the wall for a moment, grumbling. Then he stood and wiped his face roughly with his towel before wrapping it around his waist and stepping to the door, reining in the urge to give his friend a thorough bollocking for his rude entrance. All the hairs on his arms and the back of his neck were standing up, and his fingers and toes buzzed with vitality; he felt energized and ready for action. His body must still be revved up from his thoughts about his dream, as he had to readjust his towel to more adequately hide his half-hard prick, which had not subsided despite the blast of colder air. With a deep breath and plea to the heavens for patience, he went out to face whatever had Sherlock’s knickers in such a twist.
Uncle Tim remained stoic through the handshakes, but accepted a hug from John that might have reddened his eyes a bit. Then they were heading up to their room, and out of sight. John watched them go, then shook his head. “I don’t envy Uncle Tim right now, that’s for certain.”
John reached to grasp his friend’s forearm and said sadly, “And not your fault, Sherlock. It is what it is, yeah?”
In the morning light of the hotel room, Sherlock shook off the remembrance then flung himself out of bed and into the shower. John (and he as pretend boyfriend) didn’t have any family obligations until a late lunch with his Aunt and Uncle, and in the evening there was a drinks mixer for guests who had arrived a day early while the wedding party went to the rehearsal dinner. Sherlock tamed his curls with product and chose his clothes with care; no telling when they might run into their intended target and certainly they needed to set up the ruse with the rest of the guests, too.
John didn’t want to do something on his laptop. Not blogging; Sherlock could tell when John was writing a blog post, because his face mirrored all the emotions he had felt as he relived whatever experience he was putting on the page, and he had obviously been writing up the rooftop chase the previous evening. (Sherlock loved watching John write blog posts, so he criticized them viciously to keep from gushing like a vapid fan on one of the gossip sites.)
“Come on, my girl, I know it’s not the most delicious stuff in the world, but it’s what’s for breakfast,” he cajoled, giving her a wide-eyed, open-your-mouth-like-I-am expression in hopes that she would at least laugh and he could push some of the cereal in that way. At last, she opened her mouth, and in it went.
“So I’m looking at my email.” Sherlock’s delivery of this pronouncement implied anyone who did not see the point of this statement was the most egregious of idiots.
John flinched back, looking uncertain again. “I didn’t really know what else to do to discourage her,” he admitted as he settled back in his chair. Sherlock’s knee felt unexpectedly cold, and his scar ached. “Everything else I tried,” John continued, “she either ignored or implied she could er, do… for me.” He sighed again. “I guess I got a little desperate.” He hung his head.
He closed his eyes and breathed deeply, focusing on the physical sensations of this experience. His muscles were relaxing, and he sagged back against the wall behind him.
Sherlock chuckled darkly as he read the text, feeling a familiar coiling of heat in his belly at the thought of the many times he had sneaked into John’s dressing room to peel his lover out of wig, gown and garters and lose himself in the pleasure of John’s body. Sherlock, in no way modest, knew he was a skilled and creative lover, and with John, who was himself incredibly talented both on and offstage, their lovemaking was phenomenal. He craved it - craved John - always; today he felt that hunger with the added keenness of their weeks of separation.
“Just... What might be on your mind, yeah?” Greg scruffed a hand over the back of his neck and up through his short spiky hair as he came out from behind his desk and crossed to look John earnestly in the eyes. “Are you sure you’re ready to get back in the thick of it?”
“Have you been here long?” John stepped over to the bed and slipped off his trainers, exchanging them for the comfortable slippers placed ready on the floor.
They boarded their train at five, and once in their seats, John’s hand settled on Sherlock’s knee then slid up to mid-thigh to massage the muscle there. Sherlock had a momentary sensation of unreality as he realized this was his life now; casual affection from John, and for John, whenever he wished. He turned his head to look at John Watson: doctor, soldier, best friend, and the love of his life. It would not be placid perfection, them being together, he knew. They were both strong personalities with difficulty expressing feelings; it was inevitable there would be fights and misunderstandings. But them together felt right; like puzzle pieces slotting into place, like deductions domino-falling to a crystalline conclusion. There wasn’t any other way they could be, now that they had gotten here.
All this strangeness began to prey on Sherlock’s mind. What if John were hiding some sort of girlfriend or love affair on the laptop? Perhaps it was a longer-distance thing. Would John move out to go be with her? Was that why he didn’t want Sherlock to know about it? Sherlock took to pressing on the scar on his chest with his fingers. He knew a healed scar couldn’t spontaneously reopen, but it was aching often now. He hated how much this seemingly minor aberration was taking over his thoughts and pushing aside everything else. Certainly it was none of his business who John wanted to date; (since it would never be Sherlock) they weren’t like that. Nicotine patches didn’t help. The violin didn’t help, other than to wipe away any blushes John might be having when the caterwauling notes began.
Sleep became a double-edged sword over the next few weeks. Some nights John actively avoided going to sleep, dreading the terrible dreams filled with bloody bodies wearing dear faces, solemnly telling him that everything was fine.
"Ah, John," Sherlock said breezily, "shopping all done? Good, good. I need your gun. Or more precisely, I have your gun, and your bullets, but I need the clip. I presume you've hidden it somewhere."
Sherlock merely grunted as he lifted the tea to his mouth, blowing as John had before sipping. His absent hums of appreciation as he scanned the video and drank made John smile.
“Yes, really. Honestly, it’s tedious to repeat myself.” Sherlock huffed, rolling his eyes. “No matter, John. It will be a challenge to see if I can maintain the character for so long, and it’s only for a few days, after all.”
Sherlock nodded. A walk would do John good, and it would give him much-needed quiet to finish placing the expanded gallery in his mind palace. And perhaps he'd take a shower to deal with the inevitable ‘issue’ that would arise while revisiting those stunning sensations and actions. He watched John head back downstairs toward the gardens, then turned to unlock the door.
John didn’t know where it came from, but he turned, stepped forward, and wrapped his arms around his friend’s rangy body, pressing his cheek to a knobby collarbone. “I’m sorry,” he said, somewhat muffled by his mashed position, “I’m sorry I did this to you. Made you have to go through this, feel all this. It’s not fair to you, and you’ve been so...” the words ran out, so he squeezed his arms tighter around the man he was - yes, he was hugging Sherlock Holmes.
“You had a liaison, and now you wish to resume it. I see.” Sherlock interrupted frostily. “Well, I can’t dictate who you choose to associate with, but I don’t think a widow on the rebound with an old flame is likely to result in a happy outcome.” He clamped his mouth shut before more mawkish twaddle could pop out. How soon before he could escape to his room? This was worse than torture. He stilled his hand before it could press his chest.
“God, no,” Sherlock blurted. “I didn’t think you’d ever wan-” he clamped his mouth shut before he could finish the sentence.
Sherlock leaned back in his chair and observed his best friend. What was that hesitation? Why would he not want to hear from this… whatever-relative-woman? John’s reluctance had been clear, even though he had intended to send his condolences for her husband.
Duck grinned as he strode along, his gait somewhat more bouncy on the hook leg. “Thought you might have a few, being a doctor and all. Have you seen much of amputees before?”
Sherlock had resumed pacing, picking up items at random in the sitting room, putting them down with a disgusted sigh. He looked at his laptop for a moment, then growled and snapped it emphatically shut. He threw himself down on the sofa, rolled over, then bounced back up to pick up his violin. He looked out the window avidly, seeming to will passersby on the street to bring a case to their door. He dropped back into his chair and fidgeted, plucking strings on the violin but not playing, his feet drumming a staccato rhythm on the floor. John watched him from over the top of the paper, getting more irked by the minute.
John shot her a weak smile. “Yep, likely. I’m not really up for much today, though. It’s already been a full day.”
It took John a moment to get his breath back, and it was lucky he didn’t take any longer as the knife descended toward Sherlock’s body sprawled next to him, wielded by the demented Spike in a wide, jerky swipe that would have gashed Sherlock’s throat had it connected. John knocked it aside, then gathered himself and tackled the murderous henchman to the ground, pounding the wrist holding the knife against the concrete floor until the hand released and the weapon skittered away against the wall somewhere.
“I’ll...” Sherlock gestured to the door vaguely, eyes still glued to John’s form for another solid minute until he pulled them away with a shake of his head. “Out there.” And he vanished through the door as abruptly as he had entered.
This time Sherlock had pressed up to John’s side as they got into the taxi, and John shot him a startled smile. They spent the ride in silence, each tired out and wrapped in his own thoughts.
and Sherlock laid his head back on top of John’s, while John laid his head on Sherlock’s shoulder and contemplated the horrible fake wood paneling of the video booth. John closed his eyes to savor the warmth and experience of embracing Sherlock.
glare from where he rested against the pillows of the bed. Sherlock, opening drawers and cupboards and peering out the window, clearly caught the look but made no indication that he intended to heed it.
And there was Marjorie, who earnestly took his hand in both of hers in the reception line, and greeted him with a kiss on the cheek that seemed to linger a touch too long. She followed him with her eyes wherever he went at the reception, whether doing his duty on the dance floor, taking a break at the bar or eating his dinner with Aunt Brigid and Uncle Tim. It was a bit intense and he felt unsettled under her stare.
John grinned a sardonic grin at her as she fiddled with the sliders at his back, then smoothed the waistcoat again and gestured for him to do up his buttons. “Maybe. And aren’t you supposed to be the uptight one today? Should I be telling Harry you’re going around patting bums?”
Sherlock sighed a little with relief, a hint of a smile crossing his face. “You understand that you shouldn’t go home when you’re released from here,” he began. John nodded again. “Good. I’ve talked to Mycroft, and his people have arranged for you to stay in a private clinic not too far from your flat. In the same part of the suburbs, at least. It’s been cleared by his security monkeys and has many amenities. As well, you can have visitors.”
When he was finished and had washed his hands, he stepped back into his room, giving it another, more focused sweep. There! A drape of familiar charcoal fabric lay on the guest chair.
John was Harry’s best man, and his rented tuxedo was too tight in the neck and too loose in the waist. He’s sure he’s yanked his collar, then hiked up his trousers a hundred times; and they haven’t even had the ceremony yet. Of course, he got fitted for the bloody suit before he went for intensive combat training last month - after running for four weeks in full pack, armor, and weapons, he’s certainly put on a fair bit of muscle and is as fit as he’s ever been. He feels great; if only his sodding trousers would stay up! He did his yank-hike routine again and grumbled.
As he was tucking in the tails of his sinfully tight, light blue dress shirt, his mobile pinged from the nightstand. He lunged for it - it was John’s special text alert. The sound, a squawky trumpet sting, was pulled from a song that had been playing outside the window the first time John had given himself to Sherlock as the person beneath the paint and glitter of Lady Grey; shedding the layers of emotional protection his larger-than-life alter ego afforded him, in order to truly show Sherlock the man he was. Sherlock had been so humbled, so astonished by John’s courage and strength in that moment; it was the night he realized there would be no other person in the world for him after John Watson. He had tracked down the song and made the text alert and a ringtone the next afternoon.
A beat for breath passed, and abruptly the man in his arms was shuddering, stifled giggling vibrating against his pectorals. John tipped his head up, eyes crinkled as he laughed out loud. “Fine, you win. I’ll bring the posh bloody pants.” Sherlock made a note to create another alcove dedicated to John laughing while hugging; the sensation was incredibly enjoyable.
“What the hell, Sherlock?” he snapped, eyes flashing. Sherlock stepped back a pace, fingertips to his scar, unaccountably hurt. He scowled.
Dr Harrington cleared her throat quietly. “John, you were admitted to A&E with a deliberate overdose, after leaving a suicide note. It’s inadvisable for you to return home without further assessment and treatment. You and your family can arrange for a private rehabilitation stay at a qualified mental health facility, or we can arrange an inpatient stay through the NHS, but I think it will be some time before you go home.”
His friend’s ascetic face remained stony as he regarded the two adults at the table. “I’d prefer a whole pig, John - I could do ballistics experiments with it.” Amina’s expression went a little glassy at this, and John strove to salvage the relaxed vibe of their conversation.
Sherlock eventually got it all sorted, and John was allowed to go home. He’d have to be careful around Lestrade for awhile - Greg was not convinced by Sherlock’s story of unexpected fighting prowess on the part of their likely murderer, and he eyed John skeptically but let him go. His friend put him in a cab and accompanied him back to the flat, where Amina had put Rosie down and taken herself off to bed.
Sherlock paused to take in the sight before him: John, utterly nude, his erection standing proud from its nest of ash blond curls, his skin flushed from cheeks to chest, breathing hard, pulse beating visibly in his neck, staring back at Sherlock with eyes darkened by arousal. He was… beautiful. Scarred, weathered, imprinted with the evidence of a life lived hard, and all the more stunning for it. Sherlock felt a tightness in his throat and sucked in a breath. “John,” he breathed, blinking furiously, “is this… can I really?” He shut his eyes for a moment, swallowing against the rush of sentiment.
As the doors clanged shut on the lift, John did his best to ignore Sherlock’s laser-eyed stare, until his friend broke the silence. “So?” Sherlock demanded.
Dr Harrington didn’t miss the unconscious ‘we’ in that statement; though she’d been apprised of John’s relationship status, (more precisely, the lack of one) she couldn’t help but notice the diligent care Sherlock had been showing for his friend. She wished him all the luck in the world; they would not have an easy road. “Of course. Well, you’ll be on your way in a few hours, and they’ll get you settled in the facility. Lucky you, I’m told you have your own room. How long you will be there isn’t clear at the moment; it will depend on a lot of factors, not least your own attitude and progress in your counseling.”
But today he didn’t need that relief; he was still occupied enough with his experiment that he was impatient for John to return and just wanted to fill the time. So he doffed his coat and hung it on the peg, and fetched his blue dressing gown while the kettle boiled. His phone pinged - 'Glad you're unbloodied. Thinking Indian for dinner.' - Grabbing the nearest laptop as he settled in his chair with his tea, he realized it was John’s. No matter, he was just going to check email and scan the news sites while he waited. John’s password was predictable as usual, though the insults he had been choosing lately were amusing. Take this example: ‘UseY0ur)wnY0uC0ck’ – so very John in tone, and he suspected the parenthesis was unintentional though it added a level of complexity that stumped him for almost fifteen minutes.
“Yes, well - I’ll just,” the lift doors opened on the front foyer of NSY, and Sherlock hustled out toward the street to hail a cab.
reached his nose, but only faintly and the pillowcase was cool. John had not slept here since he had been away, not even last night (well, this morning) when his lover had met Sherlock’s red-eye flight at the airport and snogged him utterly senseless in the taxi all the way from Heathrow to Baker Street. Sherlock was practically drunk with case-related fatigue and John’s presence when he had stumbled into his flat with John under his arm - or John supporting him by pulling his arm over sturdy shoulders, perhaps - and staggered into his bedroom. He remembered the tender look in John’s eyes, remembered sure fingers unbuttoning, unzipping, freeing him from his stale clothes, remembered John lowering him to the bed and a warm weight settling against him, and...
“Yes,” Sherlock agreed with a rueful shrug. He released John entirely and stepped back a pace. “I can only say the same.” He swung his arms behind his back and clasped his hands there, as if trying not to spook John with the possibility he’d grab him again.
John stopped in his tracks and glared at Duck, his thoughts instantly shifting into a suspicious mode. “How did you know that? Just what was in that file you read?”
Sherlock gazed after him pensively, thrusting his own chilled fingers deep into the recesses of his greatcoat before catching John up in a few long strides. “John, what do you think of our sniper? Based on your experience, I mean?”
John’s body blurred into action without conscious direction; he rolled out of the bed and tackled the intruder to the floor, straddling lean hips, hands around its throat, starting to squeeze.
John climbed the stairs to 221B, a bag of groceries banging against his leg. The flat was curiously quiet, and he wondered if Sherlock had gone out. It'd be a blessing if he had, John thought. Maybe he's finally found something to do.
“And, my therapist suggested that I try out a few different things to see if some type of training catches my fancy. I had mentioned that you teach Aikido, and he suggested I take a few classes with you to see if I liked it.”
“Irene, my dear one, my honey pie, my little cabbage,” Lady Grey replied with an innocent smile, “how can I resist these sweets,” and she shot Sherlock a smoldering pout, “after weeks without? Now, you must admit that new song went well, even with the costume changes and the heels of death you insisted I try to stab Marco with by standing on him.” Grey’s mellow voice, so like and unlike John’s, made the words sound like music to Sherlock’s ears, and the hint of exasperation underneath the statement let him know that John was as anxious to move on to the reunion part of the evening as Sherlock himself was.
“You looked like you were having a bad dream,” Sherlock ventured. “I thought you might prefer to wake up.”
“Quite a lot, actually; right now I’m seeing two other clients besides you on an inpatient or daily schedule, and I see others weekly or less often. We don’t always run, but we might take a walk, or ride a bike, or if it’s pissing out, use the weight room here. I average about ten kilometers a day, more than that a couple times a week.”
Sherlock tugged at a sleeve to get John moving; they had to go to the morgue. While there, Sherlock had one of his a-ha moments, and soon they were staking out a flat, shivering in the dark, with no backup. As usual.
Two large hands wrapped around the offending muscle and carefully massaged it, easing the twinges efficiently. It felt wonderful, and John groaned. “Oh, thanks, that’s brilliant!” He let his head tip back while the tightness in his leg was washed away by rhythmic pressure. After a moment, that leg, much relaxed, was released, and the other picked up and given the same treatment.
Sherlock hopped back to his chair with alacrity, color high on his cheeks. He fussed over Rosie, making faces to distract her, and started gathering up the inevitable litter of a small child: toys, a stray sock, thick-paged brightly colored books. “Yes, well, it’s fine, John, not to worry. I’ll just get her back to Amina.”
John didn’t speak, just reached down and undid the fastening, and started the zip. Sherlock hastened to assist, not wanting to miss anything about this part of John as it was revealed. He slipped the trousers over John’s hips as he raised them off the bed, and down his legs; stripping off socks at the same time. John had interesting feet, Sherlock decided, with a high arch and unexpectedly smooth skin; he would make a further study another time. For now, his attention traveled up muscular legs, noting scars, especially on the knees – rugby, yes – and an interesting one on John’s thigh - not a bullet, not a knife; shrapnel? He filed it away to ask later.
“Shut! Up!” Marjorie was close to unhinged; John began to be concerned for her, and murmured soothingly to them both. He was ignored, and Stephen’s face darkened.
It took a bullet to make him see, finally, what it all meant. When John was back in 221B helping him recover, that ‘home’ feeling was back again, but tenuous, overshadowed by John’s hair-trigger temper as he processed what his wife had done. Yet his care for Sherlock was gentle - changing bandages, monitoring his pain medication, helping him bathe or dress or just move around. Sherlock came to anticipate John’s strong arm behind his shoulders as he groaned his way down to the sofa, or a hand to his flushed forehead to check his temperature, or any number of other little events, in a way that puzzled him at first. As he healed and John’s assistance was less necessary, he found himself missing that closeness. Faced with far too much time laying about, he’d catch himself imagining John stroking fingers through his curls, or sliding a hand down his chest while helping him on with his shirt, or bathing him slowly and intimately. It crystallized for him the way all his best deductions did; one fact leading to the next to the inescapable conclusion. This was … love. It explained everything; all the inexplicable ways he responded to John’s presence, craved John’s attention, considered John’s reactions, even when the man himself wasn’t present.
Sherlock stared at him, deductions falling into line, to the inevitable conclusion. “You want me to go to this wedding with you, and pretend to be… your boyfriend?” he said incredulously.
The next day, John drove to the facility for his 8:30 appointment, and ran with Duck with little difficulty. Three laps passed smoothly, stretches felt good, and tall glasses of water went down easily.
“John,” he said, interrupting John’s obvious self-recriminations, “John, they’re here, she’s here, your whatsit-step-person. Now is the time to introduce me and our relationship to her. You can have your crisis later.”
“A fight,” Lestrade’s tone was heavy with disbelief. He drew breath to continue when one of the officers called him over to where the fellow lay groaning, gesturing to the DI and indicating the man on the ground. Lestrade produced his mobile and made a call - emergency services; it seemed an ambulance was needed. The officers scurried around the scene like ants on a kicked anthill. John watched them dispassionately, anger still seething in him, though it was fading along with the adrenaline of the chase.
John considered it. Was he? Actually, no - his feelings about his dead wife were so tangled in anger and confusion and remorse that it felt good, freeing, to have a new flavor in the room where he slept. “No, it’s… good. A fresh start.” He pulled his dirty exercise clothes from the bag and tossed them in the hamper in the corner.
“Right. Great. Very good.” Sherlock left the bloke droning his outrage to nobody as he stalked down the hall. Not 308; rather, 306. He knocked smartly on the door – and it swung inward slightly, having not latched fully. He pushed his way into the room, flicking on the overhead light as he passed. The room was in disarray, bedclothes mussed, some of the many pillows on the floor, a bedside lamp knocked over. Sherlock spun in place, scanning the entire room for clues; luggage still there, but Marjorie’s wedding heels partially kicked under the bed. Must have changed for more manageable footwear. Marks on the rug indicated dragged feet, but hard to tell if one person or two were involved – there was considerable scuffing all over the place, like many people had been in the room since it was last hoovered. And – Sherlock gasped a breath; a glint of sapphire in the bathroom. John’s lovely tie lay in a sinuous coil on the floor.
The door shut after him, leaving behind a ringing quiet that John did not care to break. He realized his cheeks were a little fatigued with smiling; their conversation after dinner had been convivial and spirited. He was reminded of his early days with Sherlock, when everything the man did was new and amazing; truly his talent for noticing minutiae and determining incredible information about someone was unique and astonishing, even after all these years.
“How’re you feeling, then?” Duck asked as they headed over to stretch. “We had some serious talk yesterday.”
John gaped at him for an incredibly long thirty seconds, then began to splutter. “No! What? No, Sherlock, I never was with Marjorie! God, no.” He chuckled breathily, shaking his head. “No, but she did have a pretty heavy crush on me, I guess.” He pushed up out of his chair and began to pace a few steps back and forth, gesturing vaguely with his hands. “and then I… uh… I guess I… sort of…”
He covered John’s hand with his own, and leaned his head back against the seat, shutting his eyes. They’d make it work, and there would be honey on toast, one day.
Trigger Warning: suicide attempt (unsuccessful) in this chapter! If you wish to avoid that section, stop after John puts Sherlock to bed with tea and a painkiller and pick up again next chapter. Take care of yourself!
John blew out an irritated breath. “Well, I guess we can call that a result.” He scrubbed a hand through his hair. “I didn’t expect the homophobia, though. She was always fine with my sister, after all.”
“Practice, John. We haven’t practiced embracing or much of anything more than helping each other through the door this week, and we leave in a few hours. Do you want our first hug to be when you introduce me to your step-relative-woman-person? I’m sure that would be very convincing, while we figure out where our arms go and which way to turn our heads.” Sherlock responded acerbically.
His recounting was interspersed with recollections about his time in Afghanistan: something he had hardly ever discussed with anyone who hadn’t been there with him. He talked about the soldiers he’d saved, and some he hadn’t.
With a clank of the rail, he felt a weight push down the mattress at his side. When he opened his eyes, Sherlock was perched next to him, Rosie on his lap regarding John with dawning delight. She reached for him.
So Irene had plans for the night, hmm? Well, a few plans were forming in Sherlock’s mind too, once he had John in his arms again. He checked the clock on his phone - 5:04PM. Only a few hours until curtain; he would need to shower and change. He smiled as he headed back to his bedroom.
Sherlock’s stomach dropped and his eyes narrowed. “Your step-relative-whatever-woman?” That couldn’t be right. John’s email to her had been cool and implied not the slightest bit of interest.
The tall bloke snorted, and tapped the person in front of him, who turned and goggled for a moment before turning to tap the next. In short order, the lollygaggers had squeezed aside to make a sort of aisle for John to get to his door. He pushed through them to see a wild-eyed, disheveled Sherlock Holmes berating two unlucky nurses as they rummaged through John’s drawers, opened his closet, pulled back the shower curtain, and generally messed with all his things. John’s jaw tightened at this breach of his privacy, but he was silently glad no one had thought to poke through his bed-covers yet; his contraband phone was barely concealed by a fold in the blanket.
John straightened as if slapped, as Sherlock had intended. He began to protest that he was not having a crisis, thank you very much, when the rest of the actual words penetrated. “She’s – they’re here? Oh, okay,” he looked around the room while running a hand through his hair, tousling it rakishly (probably not what he intended) and tugged the hem of his jumper down. “Right. Well then, we’ll let them get in and then we’ll… make the introductions.” He took Sherlock’s hand and guided him very gently from behind their inadequate screening. “Would you like a drink?” he asked carefully, avoiding Sherlock’s gaze.
“I don’t mind, either,” Sherlock said, all his attention riveted on the man resting against him. He put his arms around John’s back (
John had been in hospital for less than two days and most of that asleep, and he was already getting a little stir-crazy.
“Great. I just have to put my running shoe on. Won’t be a tick.” He settled down on a chair, and pulled up his left trouser leg - revealing a prosthetic painted with vivid orange flames on a silver background, cupping his leg to just below the knee, fitted with a false foot that wore the red trainer. John stared, not having expected this at all.
John’s eyebrows had been climbing steadily toward his hairline as Duck spoke; the man was outlining a vigorous routine for a person with whole legs, let alone working with a physical challenge like Duck had. John was astounded, and said so. “That’s bloody impressive, Duck. I hope I can keep up.”
Marjorie’s mouth dropped open and she blinked for a moment. “What? What’s that? Brigid, you must be mistaken. John, you’re not with …
.” He felt a shudder ripple up her spine and her grip tightened on his arm. Served her right for the torture, sublime though it may have been, that he had suffered all day. His expression as he straightened was serene; he did his best to appear entirely unruffled. “Shall we?”
“That’s it, John. We need to get this out of you.” Again and again he retched, until only a small trickle of fluid dripped from him. Blearily he wondered if anyone had placed a basin; otherwise he was vomiting all over his bedroom floor. The notion made him whimper weakly as a soft cloth wiped his mouth.
Sherlock had seen it too, probably more clearly than John had, and the ‘Oh!’ of realization that gasped next to John’s ear was cold comfort. “Yes, I suppose you could, but you actually don’t have any knowledge of the crime. Your man, here, though - Gary, is it?” Sherlock pinned the big man with a gimlet stare. “You know just what happened to her, don’t you.”
“Christ, that’s direct,” John stuttered. “Er, no, I guess, I’m good with what you said. Kissing is fine; I wasn’t about to tear your clothes off, for God’s sake! And yeah, the whole point is for Marjorie to get the message, so we can’t be too discreet.” John’s cheeks were flushed, Sherlock was surprised to see. ‘Three Continents Watson,’ able to pull a woman from across the room when he put his mind to it, was blushing at the thought of kissing and touching his very male flat mate. Sherlock found his own face rather warm, too. He cleared his throat.
Upon arriving at the new facility, John suffered through getting checked in, biting his tongue through an interview with a ‘care coordinator’ - a clearly-not-natural blonde woman in pink scrubs and pink trainers with an actual pink bow on her ponytail and pink bobble earrings in her lobes. Her pink-painted nails tapped away on a tablet covered with a pink rubber sleeve, peering through pink-framed reading glasses that hung around her neck on a pink ribbon. They had cute, Japanese-styled cats on them.
John raised his head inquiringly, monologue cut off mid-word. “Alright, then?” Deep blue eyes regarded him solemnly.
“John.” Sherlock said. He did not move and if possible, his gaze became even heavier. “I don’t want any tea.”
He stretched his long arms above his head, pressing against the headboard with his fingers and pointing his toes, hearing his joints crack in percussive snaps and clicks as he arched his whole body against the mattress. His sheets were warm and smooth against his skin, so much better than the harsh hotel linens he’d been collapsing onto for the last two and a half weeks. He rolled onto his side, over the pillow next to his own. The combination of fragrances - tropical shampoo, women’s perfume, tea, and spicy male sweat - that translated to
Yes, alright, it was actually a 7 when he left and bumped up to a solid 8 or even a 9 when the third body came to light, and the killer’s methods both of murdering his victims and hiding his traces afterwards were unique and ingenious. Still, Sherlock’s intellectual enjoyment of the challenge was dampened by the absence of John. He kept noticing the empty space by his side on the crime scene; no deep, blue eyes across the table, hanging on his recounting of the chase; no dazzling, sexy entertainer blazing in the bright lights of a stage; no compact, muscular body tucked up against him, sleepy and sated, in his bed at night. No amount of texting (and sexting) or video chats could replace the real thing. Somehow, in the nine short months they had been together, John Watson had become necessary to Sherlock Holmes. A turn-up for the books, some might say, but Sherlock knew better; John was extraordinary and endlessly alluring, a one-man study in the contradictions of human nature.
A fellow by the door, who seemed less affected than the general rabble, stood up and weaved over to him. “Who are you looking for, eh, then?” His eyes were bloodshot.
A photo came through; the silver bark of the tree marred by two narrow, deep grooves where the pale splinters of wood showed through, framed by Sherlock’s wool-coated shoulder and open collar. The stark light of the flash made the wood shine as brightly as the vee of Sherlock’s white skin at his throat, casting the lines of tendons and muscle and clean-shaven jaw into sharp relief. John blinked at it for a moment, then concentrated on the gashes in the bark. What could have made a cut like that?
“I don’t know what I’m doing here, Sherlock. I’m fucking pants at this with women, let alone redefining my fundamental understanding of myself to boot. But I - this feels right. To me, I mean. With you. Just… if you want it too, I want to - this. But maybe take it slow, yeah? I don’t want to… ruin us, because I went too fast for myself. I couldn’t take that, er, so...” John trailed off, having delivered this speech to his shoes. The thick silence fell again between them, but John couldn’t bring himself to look at his friend.
With a curmudgeonly grunt, he heaved up and pounded his flabby pillow into a more acceptable state, then flopped back down to try to drift off.
As Sherlock shrugged his opinion of their erstwhile companions, John stepped close - looking up into Sherlock’s face, quizzical and smiling. He tilted his head and swayed forward, hand on Sherlock’s chest to steady himself. “This feels a little familiar,” he said, “I don’t mind.” He leaned in more fully and slid the hand up to Sherlock’s shoulder.
“John, I think you should seriously consider an antidepressant regime, while you’re in care, certainly, and also afterward when you go home.”
Perhaps it was the anti-opiate they had given him causing all these tears, but John lay passively in bed, eyes overflowing, as all around him people worked for his comfort and care. And beside him, his best friend castigated and browbeat the workers, eventually chasing them from the room, then returned to offer quiet reassurance to John. “Thank god they’re gone,” Sherlock said, shooting a glare at the door closing behind the last nurse, who had gone pale at Sherlock’s revelation of her office supply theft as a ploy to get her to just go already. “I could hardly hear myself think.”
“But do you see it?” Sherlock persisted, his rumbling tone vibrating up the back of John’s neck and raising goosebumps in its wake. He had begun to smile, eyes wide and shining with enthusiasm.
“I know this isn’t the time to talk everything out,” John said, ducking his head, “You know, between us, what this means. But – I want this, with you. However you’ll have me.”
The news sites were full of puff pieces about celebrities’ dogs and political scandal. Nothing interesting presented itself to capture his attention. Dull. Banal. Tedious. His email was overrun with lost jewelry, spouses-with-overly-friendly-secretaries, and one cat. A lost cat! Is this what his international reputation had earned him? He narrowed his eyes at the photo of a disgruntled, squash-faced Persian that a hopeful prospect had sent him and canceled out of his email in disgust.
The early spring air was brisk as John sauntered back toward the locker rooms from the pitch. Practice had been vigorous and muddy after the rains this week, and John was filthy from head to toe. The team was in fine form this year and he had high hopes for the weekend’s match. It would be excellent if during his last year as Captain, they took the league cup! At the moment, though, he was looking forward to a shower and change of clothes before heading home to tackle that organic chemistry practical write-up. He’d been distracted in the lab by his lab partner, Chrissy Smythe, who was wearing a tight pink fuzzy jumper that accentuated her chest and had lips shiny with Dr. Pepper-scented lip gloss her cousin in America had sent her. It smelled good. He wondered if her lips tasted like they smelled.
“What would you do if you had brought a non-pretend date?” Sherlock asked and found himself actually curious as to the answer.
When they walked into the breakfast hall a little while later, most of the tables had diners, and most of them looked extremely hung over. The wedding party was nowhere in attendance - perhaps they had their own breakfast event; more likely they were still asleep. They found Aunt Brigid and Uncle Tim sitting solemnly at a table by the wall, picking at plates of pastry. They looked the worse for wear; it could not have been an easy evening.
“Well, then, I guess I’ll have to answer,” Sherlock replied dryly. “But just this once. You know I prefer to text.”
Sherlock stepped in before they could get their claws out and took Lady Grey’s hand. “Thank you, Irene,” he drawled, “I do indeed enjoy this tart more than any in the world, there is nothing anywhere to compare. Lady Grey, you are exquisite as always.” He held the Lady’s gaze as he lifted her hand to his mouth for a gentlemanly kiss, then turned it over to press a more lingering one against the pulse point in her wrist, tasting the salt of perspiration on the tip of his tongue. He savored the indrawn breath she gasped for him and hoped his erection was not too noticeable. Being this close to the Lady, to John, had a predictable, pavlovian effect on him. He relished the sweet almost-pain of it.
Afghanistan was exhilarating, amazing, terrifying, perilous. It was trembling with adrenaline after a push, and trying not to piss yourself when the bullets flew close to your ear, and holding the needle steady when you were suturing a torn artery before the newest recruit could bleed out under your hands. John thinks he was made for this place, when he is both rested enough to stay awake and has a quiet moment to consider.
“Well,” Sherlock said affably after a bit, patting John’s hand then letting go, “shall we head back to your room? I assume you’ll want to forego dessert since the scintillating choices you have are mass-produced jam roly-poly, or green jelly with fruit in. Mmmm!” His dramatically wide-eyed, lip-smacking tummy-rubbing made John smirk despite himself.
Greg clapped John on the shoulder one more time. “Yeah, all set. John, next round of pints are on me, and we’ll do it soon, yeah?”
John sat on his bed and regarded his friend. “You didn’t answer my question, though. Why are you here so early? I didn’t expect you until after lunch. And what about Rosie?”
“Yeah, right here.” Duck stepped over to the table and opened the folder. “You’ve got about eight places to sign, and then you can pack up and clear out. You’ve got an appointment with me for a run and a talk in the morning, here, at our usual 8:30; that gonna be okay?”
Sherlock had heard enough, and his anger at Marjorie’s continued attempts to manhandle John so she could dose him with that unknown drug overcame his shocked motionlessness at what he had heard. He stood up casually, strolling out from between the two cars where he had crouched. “John’s right you know; I will always come for him,” he said. John’s bleary smile was like the sun coming out.
Tonight, as they started in on their ravioli Alfredo and green salads, John stammered out some of the gratitude he’d been feeling since he’d arrived home. “Amina, I wanted to thank you, for all you’ve done while I was…” He cleared his throat and took a sip of wine to moisten his unexpectedly dry mouth. “Well. Rosie and I would have been in real trouble if you hadn’t come along.”
Conversation was flowing easily between the four of them when Marjorie joined their group. She was taller than John but shorter than his own height, with long chestnut hair pulled back in a severe bun. She wore a flattering pastel dress but no makeup and little jewelry – not wearing her wedding ring any longer, Sherlock noted, but the tan line was still minutely visible. He could see she worked in a chemical lab, consistent with her job in pharma research, had no pets, and couldn’t take her eyes off John. Sherlock didn’t like the intense way she looked him over, top to bottom and back again, with a glint of possessiveness in her perusal. He narrowed his eyes at her and regarded her down his nose.
“Rosie, then, Sherlock?” John knew his expression must be transparent to the most perceptive man he’d ever known;
Sherlock scoffed. “I’ll hardly let some step-relative-woman with a crush steal you away just when we’ve got ourselves sorted. Don’t be an idiot.” And keeping John’s hand in his own, he led the way back to their table to endure cake and coffee.
Until Sherlock’s head popped up, and his entire body tensed; he lunged for the trackball, leaving John again alone and chilled, though faintly relieved that there wouldn’t have to be more emotional awkwardness for the moment.
John shook his head. “Almost none of healed ones, even in the service. You lost the leg in Iraq? Was it at the same time as the neck wound?”
“Can I kiss you? Anywhere I shouldn’t touch? How do you feel about public displays? For my part, I am willing to allow kissing, any touching you wish to initiate with clothes on, and the more publicly affectionate the better to discourage your step-whatever-person.” Sherlock stated baldly, a touch of hauteur in his tone. His heart was racing at the audacity of his statement; touching John, kissing John!
He went to sessions with Duck daily at first, but after only a week - just when he was getting comfortable - Duck suggested he could drop back to every other day. John nervously agreed, and plotted a path for a run through his neighborhood, sticking to the more tree-lined streets and wondering if there was a park nearby. He occasionally thought longingly of Regent’s Park, which was a short skip from Baker Street; many’s the time he had gone there to ‘get some air’ when Sherlock was being particularly pigheaded and he always found it refreshing amid the concrete and asphalt.
“Fucking, bloody - goddammit!” John gasped as he dropped to a walk from the mild lope they had been maintaining along the garden path. He pressed his hands to his lower back, urging his tight muscles to allow him to suck in the wheezing breaths he felt he desperately needed. “I don’t think this is going to work today, Duck.”
Bit of both, most likely. His patients who had presented with depression struggled with motivation, especially to exercise. So, unsurprising he did the same. Still, he was a bit flustered at how hard he had worked to do a run that he would have thought laughably light when he was enlisted. Not even a 5k charity run, and he was all in a sweat.
A look of sheepish uncertainty crossed Sherlock’s face. “Actually, speaking of visitors, I was expecting to have a harder time convincing you that this course would be for the best. Your constancy is usually a strength but in this case stubbornness will not serve; so I brought the ‘big guns.’”
she stepped down and was intercepted by the fellow from the first verse, who moved her around the stage in an even more salacious tango than before. Sherlock’s breath was coming in short gasps now, his eyes riveted to the shining queen in deadly shoes as she demonstrated her mastery of her craft.
Sherlock spent the next three quarters of an hour minutely examining John’s hand, testing different finger-interlace combinations to find the one he liked best, and memorizing the scars and calluses. He barely noticed when it was announced they were back on their way, and would be in Bath in twenty minutes. With the delay, they’d likely be arriving at the hotel just after midnight.
Which was why he was startled when Marjorie left him on the dance floor and fled the room. After a moment’s thought, he approached his Uncle and explained that Marjorie seemed upset by the news of his deployment; would he be willing to check on his daughter? John didn’t think she’d want to see him again so soon. Uncle Tim agreed, and left the room in the direction Marjorie had gone. He returned a while later, saying they had talked, Marjorie was fine but very tired, and she had gone back to her hotel to rest. John thanked him, relieved that he hadn’t made her cry again. He put the question of whether he’d promised to marry in future to the back of his mind, and didn’t think on it, or Marjorie, again for months.
Again John was pinned with Sherlock’s top-to-toe scrutiny, and aristocratic brows crinkled in concern. “Everything alright, then?”
“I’ve Shhhh… Sherl… love of m’ life.” He said from the ground. “Ev’n if ‘e nev… wanted more… I’d stay wiff ‘im. Sherlock. ‘S brilliant.” He seemed to be close to passing out, and lay limply, breathing hard. Behind his car, a stunned Sherlock blinked rapidly.
“Don’t talk about that queer, that freak - to me, John,” she said venomously, getting to her feet again and starting to tug at John’s arms. “You don’t love him. You can’t love him!” She grunted with effort, yanking at his arms. “It’s not true. It has to be a test. All those emails, flaunting yourselves to my father and everyone, I know it’s a test. You’re testing me so I’ll prove I’m worthy of you. Well, I am worthy. I love you, John. He doesn’t love you. Look how he’s hurt you! Died in front of you! And he’s a man! You aren’t like that, John. Aren’t… wrong… like him.” She managed to tug an arm free from John’s face, and held tightly to the struggling limb while she tried to bring the atomizer into position to spray him. “He should have stayed dead,” she muttered.
He leaned back as Sherlock's face went still, his brow furrowed, and his breathing became more measured. In the diffuse afternoon light coming through the curtains, John could see the pulse beating fast at Sherlock's throat. He realized he had been holding his breath, and let it out slowly. The room grew quiet. John looked at his watch and nodded.
