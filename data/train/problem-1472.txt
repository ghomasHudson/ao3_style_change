‘Oh’-ing, Sherlock rolled his eyes, but obligingly walked round the bed and took the offered hand. Lacing their fingers together, he sank to perch on the edge of the bed, holding John’s gaze all the while.
For a moment, Sherlock looked round, confused as to which of the other occupants the stranger was addressing, but then, much to his shock, the newcomer was heading in their direction and the doctor was rising to his feet.
There was an odd relief about that. Harry's ghost fell heavy in that place. He didn't need further reminders of that particular part of the doctor's past.
There was a flicker of a smile as Sherlock finally slipped under the sheets and reached over to switch off the light.
The jagged cuts down each wrist had been expertly done. Deep enough to bleed out, light enough for it to be slow. A parody of a feasting bite.
Diving in, he slammed the door behind him, breathing deeply as he locked both the driver and passenger doors. It was a stupid sense of false security, but it was something, and it gave him time. Time for what, exactly? He had many skills, but hot-wiring a year old jeep was not one of them. And disappearing into the gorse and heather on foot was definitely not an option.
John pressed his lips together, not out of anger but because he felt the situation warranted more seriousness than him laughing. He was momentarily torn in deciding what was more endearing; Sherlock’s obvious care for his wellbeing, or Sherlock’s fear that his offer would result in yet another preventable row.
The room was warm when he got there, but somehow empty. All his things had already been packed away leaving the room even more bare than it had seem when he had first woken up there.
“They’re perfect.” That at least halted Sherlock’s words. “Honestly,” John continued. “They’re thoughtful, useful, and amusingly
"You want sex," Sherlock repeated. "With me," he added as if that hadn't been clear. "I want the violin."
John smirked, pressing his teeth briefly against the soft skin stretching over Sherlock’s hip bone. He’d been able to deduce that for himself, actually. If nothing else, the evidence had been nudging his chin for a while. For someone who didn’t like stating the obvious, sex, or the advent of it, could reduce Sherlock’s mind to the level of a mere mortal. It was gratifying to John that he was the cause of such a reaction.
“He’ll say the words,” he continued. “In his own time. When he’s ready. And they’ll be all the more special when he does.”
The doctor looked at him quizzically before turning his gaze to the large French windows. "It looks fine out," he said. "Likely to be wet underfoot, definitely boggy in places, but the forecast said it should be clear until this evening. Perfect Scottish hiking weather. Just try not to get lost."
Other siblings? Even half siblings? What were they like? Did the doctor know any of them? Were any of them like him? Would it be rude to ask further?
Emboldened, he let his fingers fly over the strings, dancing up to the high notes, even double-stopping to create moments of harmony. For a moment everything seemed to coalesce into a warm perfection where even the unfamiliarity of the instrument melted away. It was just him and the music, as it has been from the first time that he had heard the song a few years earlier.
Initial observations had showed the doctor to be proficient with a knife and a more than adequate cook.
As the sensations had faded, the doctor had slowly drawn away, first by ensuring that he, Sherlock, was fully clean and back away, then by guiding them off the floor to the sofa. Sherlock had watched then as the doctor had quietly busied himself - stoking the fire, filling the kettle, even quietly putting on Hermann's violin and piano arrangement of Mendelssohn's Lieder - but with every action clearly keeping Sherlock in mind.
, that was the Scottish word, wasn't it? Either way, whatever it was called, he continued along it until he found a wide gravely area that formed a shallow bank. Checking that he was not about to leave footprints, he left the stream for the springy heather and somewhat waterlogged grass.
Sherlock made an agreeing noise and, with his eyes still on his notebook, scooted his bottom down the sofa rather than remove his feet from it. This left room behind him, into which John settled and then found himself being used as a leaning rest. Not that he minded. It was nice having Sherlock sprawled against him, warm and relaxed, smelling faintly of shampoo and Sherlock. It was an easy domesticity they were gradually slipping into now that the majority of the significant hurdles and baggage in their relationship had been confronted and for the most part sorted. Sherlock was no longer working hard to give him reasons to stay, and he no longer feared that this whole thing meant more to him than it meant to Sherlock. Neither of them had any plans to leave—in fact it was quite the opposite—and this wasn’t a relationship of convenience or one to simply pass the time. This was long term, serious, and bloody well committed.
"Must be the truth." I shook my head in shared amusement. "I do declare, that you, Holmes are sometimes something quite impossible."
; in his calculations; in his decision making in regards to the violin. He had considered it, thought about it, factored it in.
Then he gasped as the slight change in angle caused further strikes of pleasure to shoot up his body. He was going to come like this, he realised in a brief moment of clarity, and that was exactly what Sherlock had been planning for, even down to wearing a condom in attempt to make himself last longer.
Fortunately it seemed that the doctor neither required nor expected further conversation while he busied himself with the task at hand. That gave Sherlock the opportunity to flick through his books in an act that made him look occupied, while subtly watching the doctor out of the corner of his eye.
There was something heady about watching the doctor's reactions, taking in the lowered eyelids, the hips moving in counterpoint, the breathy sounds of pleasure. It was easy to see why someone like the doctor would take so much enjoyment in giving someone else pleasure.
It took John a moment to recover from the unexpected sexiness of the whole thing. A glance down reminded him that a certain part of his anatomy had certainly enjoyed that moment, and more. Lying on his back, Sherlock was certainly going to get an eye full of just how much this was affecting him.
Sherlock pursed his lips, narrowing his eyes as he kept his pose and concentration. Behind him the crowd were now silently applauding.
Twilight or not, it was less than an hour to sunset and he had to decide what to do. This was the only shelter he had seen since setting out, so staying the night in one of the still mostly enclosed rooms would not be the most outrageous idea. He could do with a fire though, as the night would not be kind. He also needed to do a sweep of the immediate area to make sure there was nothing untoward that he might have missed.
“Both players are now out on the court here at the Louis Armstrong Stadium, and the crowd applauds warmly as John Watson acknowledges them with a wave. He’s the favourite here today, but if there is to be an upset then the young man beside him could well be the one doing just that.”
He was in the cottage, downstairs. He was still clutching the violin. The doctor had abandoned his most recent ridiculous book and was now beside him, near but not encroaching, and certainly not touching. Talking to him. Talking. There were words. He was saying words.
There was a sense of melancholy about the whole area, a sadness that seeped through his clothing to make him shiver. Signs of former habitation were being lost under the nature reaching out to reclaim it. Tumbled down walls marked enclosures that were now barely more than piles of rocks and battered stones. Faint paths weaved through heather and ferns, whispering of once wider, well-trodden routes. Brown rusting metal, their form and purpose now completely obscured, poked out between stones, all but buried.
"Needed I to be?" he asked, raising an eyebrow in my direction. "I know you to be a loyal, honest, noble man, of strong character and morals. You neither cause harm nor prey on the unwilling. Should you have wished me harm you have had plenty of opportunity before now."
“Also, if instructed, my brother could get the locks changed in all the locations before you’ve even blinked.”
“Well, the players are now completing their warm-ups and it looks like Zhi Zhu has won the toss and will be serving first. We’ll be bringing you all the action, all the shots, and also the updates from the women’s fourth round tie of Dominika Cibulková verses Svetlana Kuznetsova over on Arthur Ashe, but for all of your Brits out there listening, ‘Come on, Watson’.”
If there is one drawback to reawakening the memories of all the men Sherlock has been, it is that the process inevitably changes the man he currently is. It would be impossible for it not to. What is a man, after all, but a sum of his memories and experiences?
"I'm still him, you know," Sherlock said after another long while. "William Sherlock Scott Holmes. I'm still the nineteen year old you brought here a week ago."
The doctor's brow furrowed in the beginning of a frown. "Why? Why would I want to do such a thing?” He gave a small shrug. “Because I like it. Because I enjoy it. Because it's a thrill."
It had changed with the pistol, and it had changed with the violin, and it had changed when it turned out the doctor was far more than a kidnapping potential rapist.
It was not necessary to have made a study of handwriting or be an accredited forensic document examiner to determine that.
Mindful of the fact they were due to be playing each other, Greg had organised for them to first practice together and then to train apart. Ever organised, Greg had also arranged for a junior to act as his training partner and had been given a British youngster called Oliver, who, at 16, already towered over John and managed to make him feel even older than usual.
“Absolutely. That’s what I like about Watson. He’s what you might call an all-rounder, proficient at any position on the court. Bit old school now, what with the likes of Nadal, Murray, Djokovic and Holmes favouring the baseline ground shots, but also a lovely style to watch, and I still firmly believe there’s an important place for close net work; the volleys, the smashes, the chips. Just look at Federer, he’s a classic example. Doubles is a great opportunity to develop non-baseline shots, and Watson looks both comfortable and confident with those often tricky shots.”
Because how could he possibly live with himself having played such a fine and beautiful instrument and then walk away knowing that he was leaving it in the hands of a man who not only did not know what it was but also had profound and lingering suicidal tendencies that could well end with the instrument being lost forever. The mere thought of this building burning down with all the treasures and histories contained within was bad enough, but the idea of this Stradivarius, this rare, priceless instrument going with it was a nightmare that had the potential to haunt him forever.
It was gentle, some light pressure and small movements and with a start, Sherlock realised they were in fact kissing. It was... nice. The doctor's lips moved gently across his own, exploring, caressing, the light touch of the tongue every so often, and then it was over.
"The slanted, uneven ceiling and exposed old dark wooden beams says period property," he started. "The colour and warping pattern of the beams suggests oak, which says well-built and so likely initially expensive. The furniture is mahogany, in a Georgian style. From the wear and slight fading on one side I'd say original not mock. From the scratches I'd say used but not constantly. Fading on the wallpaper suggests pictures have been removed, some more recently than others. The room has been stripped of personal artefacts, but the rug on the floor shows that effort has been made to keep it comfortable. The sheets and duvet are clean but slightly faded from repeat washes so not new, but they match the curtains suggesting the bed has been slept in regularly so unlikely to just be a guest room.
With this he sunk into his customary chair, closed his eyes and bowed his head as if waiting for execution.
No, of course not, because this was the sort of thing Sherlock would have hidden from him in a misjudged, misguided, misplaced sense of martyrdom. Which suggested that…. He groaned. It had been too good to be true. Of course it had. A week in New York, at an Open no less, and not a peep out of Jim Moriarty.
It had all gone strange again and Sherlock found himself off balance as everything once again ceased to make sense.
There was no television, no VCR, no CD player or tape deck. There was a record player and a much newer small black radio, but no other electrical or entertainment devices. Most significantly, there was no telephone.
Sherlock pulled a face. “Please. Just watch his forehand. And he was barely there in that third set. No effort at all. He had quite clearly given up by then.”
And it was obvious, now that he realised it. He just had to find the final piece of evidence that he was certain existed.
For men such as myself, this did little to change our inclinations and practices, other than the need to conduct them in greater secret. For others though, it instilled in them a sense of great shame, the belief of moral failing, and the internalisation of loathing for something that was not of their choosing.
The new day had dawned cool but bright. The cloud blanket had broken and the pale winter sun found gaps to shine through, lighting up the landscape in an array of green and burnt orange.
"Sorry," he said rising to his feet. "Been a while since I've tried to light one of these. Took longer than I expected. Give it a few minutes though and I'm sure it will go some way to warming you up."
Shrugging, he returned to the bathroom and stripped for his shower. Sherlock obviously had something planned and from experience he figured it best to just go along with it. From experience he also knew that it was most likely going to be worth it.
"The highlands were once ruled by Clans," the doctor said as they walked. "Mackenzie, Frasier, McDonnell, Chisholm, Grant, this area has seen them all. Been fought over more than once. Of course that all ended after Culloden."
“Definitely a good win for Watson. Nothing spectacular, just good, solid play, making sure he took the points at crucial moments, and didn’t allow Zhi Zhu to get the better of him. He’ll be pleased with that result.”
“Your birthday,” Sherlock said as he turned to the bedside table to grab something. “Which means it’s all about you.” He turned back, brandishing what appeared to be a small bottle of something that to John didn’t look like lube.
Pressing back, he searched for more and was given it, the strokes going deeper and harder, every one rolling against his prostate in a building wave of pleasure. His cock bounced with every thrust and he wanted to touch it, or have it touched, but also didn't want this to end.
The hotel suite was unoccupied when John returned, but that was hardly a surprise. The match winner had considerably more interviews and press conferences to go through than the loser. They had also agreed it would not be worth one of them waiting around just so they could travel back together. So, knowing he was going to be alone for a while longer, John took his time in ditching his dirty clothes and tidying away the rest of his things. For a brief moment he was tempted to see if Sherlock had hidden any additional birthday surprises, but decided there was no way that Sherlock wouldn’t notice that he had been looking.
There were words being said, and he knew he should be listening, should be understanding them, but it didn't seem to matter, because even he knew that what was being said wasn't nearly as important as the fact something was being said in the first place.
The doctor looked sincere. He also looked tired, his skin pale. Like the castle ruin the day before, there was something sad and defeated about him, a slump to his shoulders that hadn't been there the day before.
“Lie? Exaggerate? Twist the truth? That’s what consummate performers do. Whether through song, film or conversation, she can take a lie and sell it as truth, or tell a truth and make it sound like a lie. How do you think she’s survived this far?”
Lifting his head, he looked round the cottage with new eyes, finally really seeing what was there and what was not. There was no television, no VCR, no CD player or tape deck, and the kitchen lacked modern conveniences like a microwave, toaster or electric kettle. He had put it down to the cottage being retro in style, but it wasn't retro, it simply had not been updated in over 20 years. Not since Harry had stopped updating it.
“It’s certainly possible. This is the first time he’s made it into the second week of a Grand Slam, but I don’t think we should underestimate John Watson either. Watson’s having another great tournament, especially for a man who announced his retirement at Wimbledon. Yes, he went out in the second round at Cincinnati, but he had been playing back-to-back tournaments, with less than forty-eight hours between the doubles final at Toronto and the first round at Cincinnati, and that includes travel time was well. He’s not the youngest player out there either, in fact I believe he’s due to have another birthday soon.”
Four days ago he had used this bridge as a diversion, leaving the road for the river to hide his path in an attempt at escape.
For a moment the doctor didn't react, then he raised his eyebrows. "Prove it?" he said, a questioning tilt to his head.
Another brush of the fingers and then he could feel them scissoring, stretching the muscle further. It was uncomfortable but that somehow only made it feel better.
John gave a half smile. “You’re nervous about something. Might as well get it over with. Although, can’t see what you could be so nervous about.”
It was the most casual he’d seen his partner dress in a while; well, other than his sometime habit of lounging around in his sleepwear and dressing gown. The jeans were artfully stone washed, dark blue, faded in all the right places. No belt, which meant it was all hips and arse, and the button was at perfect height. The t-shirt pattern drew the gaze centre and then down, down, down.
“Then again,” John said quickly, “you’re obviously put a lot of effort into this, so I should probably shut up and enjoy whatever brilliant thing you have planned for me. So, how’d you want me?”
He smiled as the words washed over him, a small part of his mind wondering what the hell he could have done right to now be in this situation.
Swooping down, Sherlock caught the parted lips with his own, even as his hand became awkwardly trapped between their bodies. It didn't seem to matter as the doctor's arms moved to encircle him and everything else was forgotten in favour of mouth to mouth, tongue to tongue.
The doctor was silent for a long moment. "Promise that you will trust me," he said finally, "genuinely give me the chance to show you just how good it can be, and yes, regardless of what then happens, you can keep and leave here with the violin."
He gasped, sucking in cool air that he hadn't even realised he had been short of. His lungs heaved, his eyes prickled, his groin throbbed.
Candles flickered in the dimed light of the bedroom, and, perched on the edge of the bed in his blue silk robe, Sherlock was waiting for him. It was a sight of utter beauty. His curls lay flatter, damp from a shower he must have taken, his face smooth from a new shave, which only made him seem younger somehow, and when he looked up, his expression was one of such raw vulnerability that it seemed to take John’s breath away.
He opted for a shave, taking care to neither cut himself nor miss a bit. For a brief moment he considered shaving places other than his face, but dismissed that as quickly as the thought came. The doctor had, after all, never voiced a preference for such personal grooming other than in his sexual preference for men, and with men came hair. He did however, make sure to trim various areas, but that was as much for own vanity as for anyone else's sake.
Be decisive. Pick your moments. Play at the net. Don’t get drawn into unnecessarily long rallies. Go for the kill. Believe you can win.
What had that really been all about? That was the question, wasn’t it? It wasn’t just about what he couldn’t have, was it? It was also about him; about the part of him that he had tried to ignore; the part of him that was wrong.
“Also true,” John acknowledged. “But there is one other thing you’ve overlooked in this whole thing.”
It was a bathroom - plain, simple and a bit old fashioned with a shower nozzle attached to the bath taps. A toilet was a toilet though, and the water from the sink was cool against his skin.
He smiled, gave a wave, but didn’t offer any answers, just headed back to the main changing rooms and the showers. With time before his massage, he took advantage of the near empty steam room and allowed the heat to soak away some of the familiar aches that had become near constant companions to him.
"Can't remember the last time I did something like that, and even then it wouldn't have been to music like that."
The doctor's laugh was counterproductive to what he had intended, but his words did get the doctor away from the crossword puzzle he had been frowning over.
Still, this was an issue of trust. Until the moment came, Sherlock could not be fully certain that the doctor would let him go, let alone with such a precious instrument, despite all the evidence that pointed in that direction.
Rushing into the bedroom, he made directly for the bed, thrusting his hand desperately under the pillow even as he mentally berated himself for letting his guard down. He had completely forgotten about the weapon and the danger it represented.
"Okay, for the sake of clarity, I'm going to press my lips against yours for the kiss. I won't touch you anywhere else, just my mouth against yours. Try not to tense up, but if there's something you don't like, you can pull away. You have room behind you. Or, if it's easier, push me away. Probably easiest if you meet me at least part way, so you're going to need to lean towards me. That's right. And... relax."
Transferring from Toronto to Cincinnati and then to Manhattan, they had kept the same setup. He and Sherlock were sharing a two bedroomed suite, with Lestrade in another room nearby. If anyone asked or checked the hotel records, then it was Sherlock and Lestrade who were sharing, but no one would ask, and they were paying more than enough for discretion and no questions asked.
There was a small amount of oddness in doing it to someone else. This was his first time touching anyone in such a way, but as different as it was, it felt so familiar too.
The pause was longer than usual, the corners of Sherlock’s lips tilting upwards before he made a point of returning his attention to the television. “Of course it does,” he replied mildly.
When it was clear that no answer was forthcoming, John returned to his two fingered typing. It wasn’t going to be the longest blog post ever, but his reaching the quarter finals certainly deserved a mention.
“No, stop!” he said sharply, cutting off whatever defensive apologetic rubbish Sherlock was about to come up with.
He rose to his feet and took a seat in the armchair closest to him. That left the empty armchair closet to Sherlock, or the sofa.
“Your partner must have good taste. I’m sure you’ll find the retailer to be one of good reputation.”
Breathing out, the doctor sunk back into his chair, hand twitching against the armrest. He looked thoughtful, almost lost, and Sherlock wasn't even sure that the doctor remembered he was still there.
No, the desk was the most likely place. So far he had only given it the most cursory of interest. Partly because what he had seen in it had been completely straightforward. And partly because by it being located in the main room, it was impossible to show an interest in it without the doctor knowing.
He had never wanted to see Sherlock like that. No one should ever have to see Sherlock like that. Now he had to decide whether to tell his lover about it and endure Sherlock’s embarrassment, his pain, or to keep it to himself and risk the secret becoming more than it was.
It was then that Sherlock broke away, twisting out of the hold and grabbing John’s shoulder to practically manhandle him towards the bed.
Sherlock shifted slightly in his seat, his eyes darting away. “In the past you have reacted less favourably than I had anticipated to such offers, and I did not want an unnecessary repeat of otherwise avoidable confrontations.”
Turning back to the room, Sherlock stared at the hundreds of untold stories unfurling in front of him. It was difficult to even know where to start, his brain bombarding him with data from every surface.
“One row she said something that’s stuck with me, for better or for worse, ever since. She said, ‘Love is a hell of a lot more than just saying the words.’”
Or at least what passed for a town while in the middle of nowhere. Large enough for a small petrol station, a church, a laundrette, and a few shops, including the butchers from where the steak had most likely been purchased.
“All will be revealed in good time,” Sherlock said. “But first breakfast, then we have a match to play.”
Afterwards, they washed up in silence, Sherlock shifting from leg to leg with growing impatience as he waited for the next item for him to dry.
Irene ran her finger lightly across the rim of her glass of water. “Everyone needs someone to talk to once in a while, even him.”
The intensity of his arousal shocked him, dwarfing as it did even those first moments from his early teenage years. One kiss, that was all it had taken, one deep, proper, all-encompassing kiss.
Stripping out of his now wet things, Sherlock changed quickly and quietly in the bedroom before heading back down into the warmth. It was the second time he had done this now. Maybe the doctor had a point about him bolting out into the rain. At least this time he had managed to have shoes on.
After finding something to eat and checking the news, he grabbed his laptop to log onto his blog. Between the match tomorrow and his birthday, he figured that now was as good a time to tackle some of the comments and well-wishers.
"No," the doctor said, the humour having gone from his tone, the word pinning him to the chair as surely as a hand would have. "Sorry. That was uncalled for."
Although not particularly heavy, the rain was constant and insistent, soaking through his clothing and dripping down his face within moments. What had been a beautiful scenic view less than an hour before was now a monstrous wilderness, stretching outwards from him and ending in a haze of poor light. Behind the clouds the sun was already nearer the horizon than its zenith, stealing away the last of the natural light.
“Some of it,” Sherlock said, not showing any surprise in the least by the sudden interruption to his solitude or the lack of greeting.
It was not something that had crossed his mind before, that the reason he hadn’t yet heard the full story was because it wasn’t just Sherlock’s secret. Sherlock and Irene’s ‘relationship’, such as it had been, had been built on mutual need, two people using each other to fool the media. He had thought it might be a silly, fun sort of story, but suddenly it wasn’t. Suddenly, with Sherlock’s words, it had changed into a tale of desperation and sadness, that behind the red carpet smiles was the knowledge that Irene was wearing a mask while her real partner could only watch the proceedings from home.
“Okay, yeah, sorry,” John continued with a small smile and shake of his head. “Stupid question. Of course they asked.”
The doctor nodded. "Today is Friday, right? Let's say that by this time next Friday you will have made up your mind. Then whatever your decision, next Saturday morning, you will be on your way out of here, back to Cambridge, plenty of time before your lectures resume on the Monday."
"Don't mind," he said darting to the kitchen. "Up to you." Plucking the jeep keys from the table, he tossed them into the doctor's lap. "You drive."
A girl, he had sometimes thought, a daughter for Mummy, one with dresses and hair clips and another funny name.
“Watson bounces the balls and lines himself up for the serve. Good serve. Zhi Zhu returns, Watson forehand, Zhi Zhu and Watson closes it down at the net with a tidy volley.”
He nodded, dropping his head again. "Do it," he said, not quite able to mask all his anxiety beneath the bravado.
For a long time neither of them said anything. Twilight fell and the shadows lengthened before the doctor turned towards him.
The pen felt unfamiliar and a little awkward in his hand, but he was more than capable of using it to scratch his name across first one page, then the other.
“No. On this there will be no argument. You need this to help you play and I cannot face you knowing there was more I could do to help. Consider it pride and selfishness on my part. Consider it thoughtfulness towards my practice, doubles and life partner. Consider it a birthday gift if need be, just accept it and not waste time worrying about the financial implications. The monetary cost is irrelevant. What I have is yours; my assets, my body, my life. Do not reduce this down to something as insignificant as
Small drops of rain made their way through the gap in the window, some trickling down the inside of the glass. Sherlock barely registered them as he sat, the steering wheel gripped tightly in his hand.
He made the cup of tea more out of habit than anything else. He had no need for normal food or drink, but the routine was comforting. As was the fire that he re-laid and lit. External cold was a thing long past for him, and no amount of external physical heat could banish the chill within him. There was something alluring about the flames though, something to watch.
The words commanded, so he slowly stilled, sinking into a deeper state, of sleep without dreams. And he slept.
“A third break point here for Holmes. Watson is shaking his head as if he can’t quite figure out what he should do. Holmes is all over him. Nothing seems to be working.”
It was his first time seeing the doctor topless, without a shirt, without a terrible jumper. He had already deduced exactly what he was going to see, but the reality was somehow more. Defined but not overly defined. Broad shoulders, toned arms, a light dusting of mid to light brown hair. A few faded scars, thin and pale.
Returning to his seat, John grabbed his towel and then his drink. Eleven thirty in the morning and he was already sweating like hell. He just hoped it wouldn’t get too much hotter. Playing in forty degree heat was never pleasant. Playing someone like Zhi Zhu – who was younger, fitter and lighter than him – in forty degree heat would be a nightmare. Even now, all he could do was hope that by forcing his opponent to do more of the running it would mean Zhi Zhu would tire first, but there were no guarantees there.
And just to be clear, whatever Sherlock consented to, he didn't consent to that last part. And John knows it.
"The second fact, for which no apology will ever cross my lips, is that to me, you are the most brilliant, the most engaging, and the most beautiful of men. Flaws you have without a doubt, physically and socially, in both character and behaviour, but for my taste they enhance rather than detract from the man I see before me. To me, you are the most perfect of being. Calling you friend would have been sufficient for my needs. Your present state and words, however, leads me to hope that, maybe, there is room for more."
, that was Sherlock,” he said as the noise came again, high pitched, breathless and frighteningly familiar.
"No," he repeated, cutting the doctor off as he looked down at the weapon in his hand. "No, I will not simply hand back the means to your own destruction."
The doctor drove carefully but leisurely, at times tapping his fingers on the steering wheel as if to a melody only he heard. Other than the odd observation to do with their surroundings, they didn't speak.
Clearing his throat, John pointedly raised his eyebrows in the direction to where Sherlock’s fingers were tapping on the table top.
He got to his feet. Come on Watson, this is it, you can do this. One more set then it’s the quarter finals and Sherlock won’t be able to accuse you of not having tried your damned hardest.
“And myself?” I asked, carefully refolding the letter. “What gave me away?” Curious as to what he had noted in particular, I implored him to continue, something he did with great relish.
He gasped and he swore and then the doctor moved again and again and again and again and then finally he hit the spot and it was good.
Christ, that should not have been as erotic as it was, and he stared almost helplessly as Sherlock all but fellatioed his toe while all the while continuing with the long finger strokes that were making his nerves sing.
The new day brought grey skies and drizzle. The view from the bedroom window remained no less impressive in nature and grandeur, but the weather continued to make it imposing and virtually inaccessible. Even if the rain cleared, the ground would still be damp underfoot, limiting movement and speed.
"Edwin Sherlock George Holmes," Sherlock said, emphasising each name. "My double great grandfather's first cousin. And my namesake."
Every time Sherlock dies he's reincarnated and reborn, and at some point their paths cross. It's then John's task to seduce him - although that doesn't always take much, they're soulmates after all - and between the sex and the bite, it triggers Sherlock's memories of previous lives. Don’t ask how, they’re not entirely sure how it works either, just that it does, so they keep doing it the same way each time figuring that it’s something to do with Sherlock’s brain being most susceptible at the point of orgasm at the same time that John floods him with a double dose of fluids – saliva from the bite and whatever it is he ejaculates.
“Watson manages to get to the lob, but Holmes is there with what in the end is a simple put away. He’s now just one point away from taking the set, but we’re back on Watson’s serve.”
“Oh, for god’s sake.” He stormed out to the main room to where Sherlock was lounging on the sofa, fully engrossed in the match on the screen. “Sherlock, your mobile.”
He circled around the central facts as he knew them, tipping them, twisting them, viewing them from all possible angles until he was certain he had considered all eventualities, motivations and possible outcomes.
The Jeep was parked a farther distance away, obscured by trees and the angle of the rocks. It was no wonder that Sherlock had missed it during his initial ascent. It was also at the edge of what looked like a gravel road, not too dissimilar to the one the cottage was on.
With my new qualifications and a new identity in place, I set out once more, this time for India, and then spent a good few years travelling the Near East, until a near death incident at the hands of my own kind in Afghanistan had me heading once again for more familiar shores.
"Just us," he said. "Mummy was a mathematician before Daddy. She gave that up after they had Mycroft. Mind you, it doesn't take a mathematician to work out that Mycroft was born just five months after their wedding."
"I hate you," he said, as against orders, the smaller figure that had followed him approached and then stopped beside him.
"You eat, but at no time have you shown true signs of hunger despite claims of that nature, except for times when you are forced to delay or forgo one of your excursions.
“Watson serves, but it hits the net. He lines himself up for the second serve, which Holmes returns with interest. Forehand Watson. Holmes returns deep. Watson backhand and the drop shot from Holmes which Watson had no chance with.”
“Watson looks exhausted and Holmes is taking complete advantage, tossing him from side to side. It’s almost as if he’s eager to get the match finished and get off the court.”
“We’ve time,” came the broken response, prompting scrabbling fingers and discarded clothing. “There’s always time.”
Together those all pointed to a plausible eating disorder, but there was more when other factors were added in.
In the end he settled on the couch and switched on the television to catch up on the Nadal-Verdasco match, the winner of which would play Sherlock in the semi-final.
The notebook shut with a firm thunk and was tossed in the direction of the coffee table. A moment later and Sherlock was pulling away from him, sitting up, then standing up, then stretching, his grey Brooklyn bridge t-shirt riding up above the waist of his low slung jeans to reveal a pale strip of skin. Very lickable skin.
There was a pause, a frown, and then Sherlock was sitting up, taking the postcard from him. He turned it over, looked at the front, then turned it over and looked at the back. It hadn’t changed. It was still the same postcard which meant they were seeing what they were meant to see; a cheerful picture of a giant egg sitting on a wall, little legs swinging, the words Humpty Dumpty written across the top part of the picture. While on the back of the card there were just the three innocuous letters; I O U.
Lying still, he stared up at the same ceiling he had awoken to a number of hours earlier. Decision made, word given, the hours that followed had been conducted with quiet restraint, the doctor leaving him alone other than showing him around the kitchen and then making food for them both. Sherlock had not bothered to hide his scrutiny of the doctor's cooking - trust was something that had to be earned and food was too easily poisoned - but the doctor had borne it with little more than a knowing glance and a rueful smile.
This was the part he hadn't been looking forward to, the part where Sherlock remembered how his previous life had ended, why he had died.
The doctor froze, the first true reaction he had witnessed from him so far, and all the confirmation he needed to know that he was right.
He swore again at the stopping and with a laugh Sherlock resumed his task. Bloody hell it was glorious. His penis throbbing beneath him, hard and all but forgotten, while the tongue did things more rarely done.
The bastard, he thought, as he groaned into the sensation. The sneaky, underhand bastard had taken advantaged of his descended fangs and sliced his own tongue and lip on them, spilling the first drops of blood.
So why did bees choose hexagons over triangles or squares? Marcus Terentius Varro – a Roman – proposed that a structure built from hexagons is probably more compact than a structure built from squares or triangles. A hexagon honeycomb, he thought, would have the smallest total perimeter.
The answering slight hum was a little disconcerting though, as was the small smile that suggested the doctor found the statement more amusing than startling.
He trailed off as the doctor, who as he had been speaking had risen to his feet and moved across the room, tugged open the heavy curtains. Pale light flooded in, and although dampened by the greyness of the cloud cover and the light but steady rain, it did little to obscure the sight of the rugged sweeping landscape that was definitely not part of the Home Counties.
“Yes, thank you, Ann. You can probably hear the crowd around me, still worked up from the surprise result in the previous game, but surprise is sometimes what it’s all about at a tournament like this. That said, we haven’t had any surprises yet in this match, but we’re certainly not been lacking in entertainment.
; born, lived, died, and then born again, no memory of who he had been previously until John found him, bit him, and reawakened him.
Before he realised just how late it was, before he remembered why he was where he was, before he remembered why he shouldn't be laughing so much, it hit him that he was enjoying himself.
Closing his eyes, John took a deep breath and then slowly released it before looking up and getting to his feet again.
It didn't stop with that song though. The doctor barely paused as he plucked out record after record, leading them through Stevie Wonder, The Jacksons, and then the Bee Gees.
Sherlock’s smile was small but genuine, but the relaxing of his shoulders was far more telling. “Lestrade has the details. It’s scheduled for after practice tomorrow. RMC and RTL L’Equipe have requested interviews so I will be otherwise engaged. The masseur comes highly recommended with an expertise in racket sports. You will be in good hands.”
Sherlock Holmes was definitely an arse. A self-satisfied, cocky, smart-arsed wanker of the highest degree.
The fire was low but still burning when he awoke. For a moment he blinked absently as he stared at it. This wasn't the bed. He wasn't in the bedroom. In fact, he was still downstairs but he had no recollection of how he had got there. Then it slowly started to come back; the nightmare, the late night drink, the conversation by the fire, then his protest at being moved.
They continued to sway as the music slipped from one track into the next, the beat picking up briefly but their movements staying much the same.
He hadn’t been surprised to find himself on the receiving end of what he had teasingly labelled as the Sherlock Holmes patented
Naturally, Holmes had had the truth of it - of course he had. And oh how much he had wanted Sherlock. Wanted the warm body and the blood, oh the blood. The whole week had been an exercise in restraint. Of holding himself back from taking what had been right in front of his nose. It would have taken nothing to pin the boy down, to have taken everything he had craved, and after one kiss Sherlock would have craved it too, but he hadn’t because that wasn’t what he wanted, that wasn’t the person he chose to be.
The television flickered with what passed for world news in America, but neither of them was really watching, each lost in their own thoughts.
"Holmes," I said again in the hope that I might stem the words from him as the power of reassurance was well within my ability.
“Ooooh, Watson hangs in there. Two excellent passing shots there from Holmes, but Watson got the volleys in, showing the type of skill that has helped make him such a formidable doubles player lately. Holmes, for once, had no reply.”
He ran his finger across some of the tomes; Elizabethan and Jacobean classics; Shakespeare, Marlowe, Kyd, Spencer, Sidney, Jonson, Webster, and more; poetry by John Donne; various works by John Milton. Then more poetry. Actually there was a lot of poetry. All the Romantics, but also a completely separate section for Scottish poetry; Gaelic, low scots, English, far more than just Robert Burns.
He leant in, chasing the sensation that was suddenly racing through his body. It wasn't like the drugs, and yet it was, and he liked it. He wanted it.
John gave a mock sigh. “Okay, fine,” he said, reaching out to tug Sherlock back down onto his lap where he belonged, “but you can do all the work, Mr I-walked-my-match-in-one-hour-twenty.”
That was what he had missed, what had been niggling at him throughout the week without him noticing; all the dates had been wrong. He had presumed that Harry had died not long before John had come to their village, but that was an assumption he should never have made.
Sherlock burned like a furnace, hotter behind him than even the newly stacked fire in front of them. He could feel the heart beating beneath his ear; hear the thrum of blood rushing through the veins. Soothing. Familiar.
He watched in confused as the doctor offered a smile with a nod and then turned away, crossing over to the cupboard of LPs. He paused while looking through, as if considering the selection, before pulling out his choice and slipping the record into the player.
Now though, James' five times great granddaughter held the throne, and as admired a monarch as she was, her personal views had shaped the country in ways that might never be fully understood. What had been quietly tolerated in previous centuries became unacceptable in the extreme. What had once existed just below the surface of society was now pushed into the deep depths, hidden away lest discovery bring ruin.
The doctor’s lips were a touch swollen and pinker than they had been. Had he done that? Was that the kisses?
He wasn’t sure what he was supposed to be more surprised at, the fact Sherlock kept a record of what he wore for dinner with Irene, or that it was so important that he didn’t wear the same outfit twice. The one thing he wasn’t surprised about though was the confirmation that his boyfriend was as vain as a peacock and as competitive as an elk in rutting season.
This Harry - a genius by his own hand, unacknowledged by his peers, an outsider in society on account of his sexuality – had had a home, pastimes, and a devoted lover who had adored him and who he had adored in return. In additional to all of that, he had also owned a unique piece of history, the pinnacle of musical perfection.
"Perhaps I exaggerate," my friend hastily retracted on seeing my reaction, "but I was young and still held certain romantic notions that can cloud my recollection of events to make them seem far worse than they were."
John closed his eyes in acknowledgement. He had been alarmed the first time Harry had appeared to him. He hadn't been sure if it was the onset manifestation of a new ability he hadn't been aware of, or a symptom of the madness growing within him.
The soft words broke through the maelstrom of words pounding his head and his eyes shifted automatically to the door he had already made a note of. His weight shifted automatically, ready to run, to hide, to get away in any shape or form, but he forced himself to hesitate. Was it a trap? Was he missing something? Was there another meaning?
He would worry about feeling sore later but right now it felt too bloody good, except there was no way he was going to be able to get a hand to himself.
He played the violin and watched as the doctor copied out a second version of the contract with the practised ease of someone who knew how to write in ink without smudging.
He pressed his lips together. “So what do we do then?” Because he wasn’t about to just fucking sit back and take it.
He decided on pants, only because he thought the doctor might appreciate being able to take them off. He certainly hadn’t made the decision based on his own modesty and discomfort in being so undressed.
And as idiotically unhinged as his plan might have been, in a twisted way it made sense. How better to break the loneliness than trying to recreate lost intimacy? Yes, the doctor wanted sex, but he also wanted someone to talk to, to share a joke with, someone to play a game with.
"Will I see you again?" he asked, looking first at their hands, then down and away. "When all this is over?" When the doctor had gotten what he wanted and Sherlock walked away with the violin. "After we- after I leave here."
He did not expect the half smile of recognition with the cocked head of curiosity. Once again the doctor was surprising him.
The rest was lost into his shoulder where the doctor buried his head, but it didn't matter, all that mattered was this; the movement, the build-up, the sensation. It was glorious. He could feel it, the end they were racing to. He didn't want it to end, but what an end it would be. So bright. So glorious. So-
As expected, the lights were off, the only real illumination coming from the glowing remains of the open fire and the little moonlight coming through the uncurtained windows.
In all my machinations, I had not considered that Holmes might be one of these types of man. It was an oversight on my behalf and one I was only starting to face the consequences of.
Discarding the flannel, John raised his hand to Sherlock’s face, stroking his fingers over the cheekbones before dipping his lips to press a kiss to Sherlock’s forehand.
"Plotting the incidents to a map of London, taking into consideration weather and tidal patterns, I narrowed the central place of activity to a specific area and then to a particular exclusive club, one that was anciently old and whose membership criteria was vague to the point of being shrouded in secrecy.
They ate in quietness and afterwards Sherlock joined the doctor by the sink, drying off the dishes as the doctor washed.
His words, I must confess, shook me to my core. Not because of the admittance of his interests, that - along with his intelligence and quest for knowledge - had held steady in all incarnations so far, but because of the vitriol with which he spoke.
"You- you just wanted sex, but then you went and showed me all these things, things I never thought I would ever have, things I never thought I might even want. And you've- you've got me considering things, impossible things,
He stopped bouncing the ball and readied himself, threw the ball up and uncurled in the serve. The ball flew back, forehand, forehand, backhand, forehand, now close it down, get to it, volley, and yes, you’ve done it. That was good. That was good.
From what he could gather, Clara had booked his life all the way up to Christmas and beyond, somehow managing to squeeze in Top Gear, Graham Norton, and Sports Personality of the Year.
“Thank you,” he said, smiling fondly before sliding his palm to the back of Sherlock’s neck, drawing them into a gentle embrace, his chin brushing against Sherlock’s curls. “And I love you too.”
The records didn't take too long to finish sorting after that, even with him meticulously going through both the new additions and the original collection searching for clues about the owner.
“You underestimate yourself,” she said, looking at him carefully. “It’s not easy to make Sherlock Holmes seem truly happy, and yet he’s radiating security and contentment. I’ve never seen him like this.” She looked thoughtful. “I take it he’s now told you about his past.”
"Why, there was nothing of course, and I told them so accordingly. Nothing, aside from the three documents detailing everything I knew currently in the hands of three different street urchins who were under explicit instruction to deliver the documents at a particular time and date unless they received further instructions from myself and only myself.
"Be serious, my good man," I said quite firmly once the words could take form. "I have just told you that I am not human."
"Yes, but I told you, I'm not going to force you. If this was just about sex then, god, I could have plied you with alcohol or drugs or something back in Cambridge. But that's just wrong."
There was a rustle and then a couple of precise flicks of the wrist, the paper disappearing, dropped casually to one side to reveal a plainly wrapped present that had been previously hidden. There was no tag, no bow, no fancy paper, but it was clear not only what it was but who it was from.
"No idea," Sherlock admitted with a slight shrug. "Born 1854. Died obviously before 1948. No children. Never married. A confirmed bachelor by all accounts. There was a letter from him in 1918 commiserating his nephew's loss. The address was London. A press cutting from 1895 makes reference to a Mr. Sherlock Holmes of Baker Street, London, who had aided Scotland Yard in the capture of a murderer, so likely to be the same person. Then there is this book."
It was farther than it looked, the ground often sinking away beneath his feet despite his best efforts otherwise. Another hour ticked away and the sun hung heavy in the sky.
He still asked, "Why?" though, even as he rolled onto the floor, retrieving the coat that had fallen from him in the process.
The doctor chuckled. "Yeah, sorry about that. Ran the tank down on the way up here because I knew you'd try to escape. Always keep some spare though. You never know what might happen out here and it's not as if you can simply call for help. Topped up while I was in town. Anyway, I promised you could leave at the end of this, didn't I? Well now it's all filled up for you and ready to go."
He searched and he searched again; glove compartment, dashboard, visor, door compartments, under the seats, under the mats. There was no spare set of keys.
One, Sherlock played his worst game of the season, and even then John knew he would have to play at his very best to really have a chance.
It was only due to centuries of hard learnt self-control that stopped me from creating a bigger scene than the one already in progress. I had also the character and temperament of the man before me to consider. A show of lost temper was not what the situation required.
The LP moved onto the next song. A slower one this time. Again he didn't recognise it, but presumably from the way the doctor hummed along, it was also by the aforementioned Billy.
Sherlock jerked as the main door swung open with a crash. The single word cry that accompanied the entry was loud and unapologetic, much like the cause of the commotion. The newcomer was a large man, who, despite being no more than average in height, seemed almost giant-like; his build broad, his chest deep, his hair and beard a vivid red that declared his native heritage as loudly as his distinctive burr.
“Absolutely. Confidence is key. Just look at the way he’s playing in this match. He’s going for his shots. Not only that, but he’s expecting to make them, and most of the time he is. He’s being fearless and that’s putting a whole heap of pressure on Holmes, who just hasn’t been able to settle into any sort of rhythm in this match so far.”
They had to cross each other by the net for the next game. That was the only reason this could work. That and the fact their history meant no one would question them crossing closer together than some players would.
“The list of things to constantly remind you of. Just the important things; don’t listen to Moriarty, don’t be rude in interviews, just because I’m madly and passionately in love with you doesn’t mean I’m going to do everything you say.”
“Remarkable turnaround from him. We used to play a bit together, back in the day, so I’m delighted he’s found his form again. He always had so much potential. Of course there’s still so much speculation about what’s prompted this change, but a lot is being put down to his new friendship with Sherlock Holmes.”
The signature was indecipherable, but one I knew well enough to recognise. The gentleman in question was well known to me and to my previous Sherlock. It was to this individual that my previous Sherlock had once aided at considerable risk to himself, although this was not something my current Sherlock would at that time recall.
"I brought you back here," John said softly. "I scattered your ashes from this spot. I did as I promised."
“Sherlock,” he said slowly, “thank you for organising the massage and for asking me if it is alright. It was very thoughtful of you and I’m sure it will be very beneficial to me. Just tell me where and when and I’ll be there.”
“You’re disappointed.” Narrowed eyes, furrowed brow, unnaturally still lower face; this was more than Sherlock’s usual confusion.
“Watson still very much in this as he lines himself up for his next serve. He readies himself, freezes and now serves. Zhi Zhu backhand, Watson forehand, Zhi Zhu backhand, Watson backhand crosscourt, Zhi Zhu backhand, Watson down the line, Zhi Zhu, but he’s pushed it wide and Watson clenches his fists as he realised that he’s held his serve after what had looked like a very dangerous moment for him.”
He spoke until he ran out of words and the doctor ran out of questions. The smile never went though and it warmed him to have such an expression aimed in his direction.
“To buy me some for my birthday.” It was all John could do not to break into a massive grin. As it was he covered himself by pressing his hand to his lower face. Sherlock’s small frown was enough to remind him that his boyfriend lacked real relationship experience, and to some extent, common sense.
It sounded so simple. But the doctor had promised to stop and at the time of asking had done exactly that. That was... good.
"But not just a plan, a way out. And not even a bad one at that. Because you had already thought about it. Already toiled with it in your mind. Already made your decision as to how this all ends."
The doctor's gaze flickered, but he accepted the pen, and shortly after, the doctor's signature joined his own.
"Thought I'd heard you moving," the man said in a pleasant tone, offering a warm smile as he moved to rest the tray on the side table. "How are you feeling? Any dizziness, nausea? That's quite normal by the way."
The singing was in tune, which was good, but it was hardly anything special. And yet it had him putting down the old microscope and quietly making his way down the stairs.
Well, he thought with a hidden sigh as the singing started, it was certainly catchy and they were in Scotland after all.
The isolation. The lack of socialising. The loss of a loved one. Grief could account for all of that, and yet there was more still.
While I did not fear physical injury due to my revelation, I did fear a natural revulsion as taught by this highly moralistic time. The last thing I wanted was to be associated with some sort of demon.
He rolled his eyes but allowed the doctor to brush an errant curl away from his forehead. "Are you going to be smug from here on out?" he grumbled, although the chemical cocktail swimming around his body stole any real bite from it.
It was Sherlock, but it was Sherlock as he had never seen him before. This wasn’t the larger than life, pseudo-arrogant, confident Sherlock he knew. This Sherlock was… broken.
For a brief moment he wondered whether the doctor would amenable to taking a punt out on the Cam, but banished the thought with some horror once he realised the direction his thoughts had gone. At the very least the doctor was a kidnapper and, regardless of what happened at the end of these seven days, they were unlikely to see each other again.
"Morning," the doctor greeted, half turning to offer him a smile. "There's some hot water if you want a shower. Tea and coffee are on the side. Help yourself to whatever you want for breakfast. There's cereal, bread, eggs in the fridge if you're feeling adventurous. Fruit if you would prefer."
Tell me about him, Sherlock wanted to ask. But what could the doctor tell him that wasn't already in this room? Wasn't that the point, the reason it was all in there? This here was
No, he knew exactly what he had been thinking. He had been thinking that he couldn’t back away from a challenge. He had been thinking that maybe things would start going wrong with them again if he did not start making the later rounds of tournaments.
“I find it helpful to be aware of certain major landmarks and know where there are other tennis courts.”
Hell yes, but that was not exactly surprising. He had a hot, fit, gorgeous lover that he fancied the pants off – quite regularly actually – and was rather head-over-heels in love with. The sex was good, the cuddling was good, hell, the moments of quiet and calm were also good. It was all ridiculously good. Or at least most of it, and any part that wasn’t didn’t really matter, especially right at that moment.
That had seemed to confirm it, and he was a few steps up the stairs before he heard the doctor's voice again.
"I could ask you the same thing, doctor," he said back equally quietly. Without breaking eye contact, he slowly raised the Victorian pistol.
Part of him wondered why he was even stopping. He should be marching onwards, farther from the cottage, ever closer to civilisation and rescue, but another part of him was transfixed, fascinated but also mournful, as if this place mattered to him. It was a disconcerting feeling, one that only grew stronger as time went on.
"So what was it going to be? A bullet to the brain and the house set to burn? Old place like this, full of wood and books and old furnishings. Open fire, no neighbours, miles from anywhere. Such a tragic accident. You wouldn't even need the spare petrol stored in the woodshed outside, but that would make it all the more certain."
The doctor beamed as he motioned to the object he was now standing beside. It was a portable electric space heater, Sherlock realised after a moment. Not massive, but designed to plug into the wall and would certainly make a positive difference to the temperature in the upstairs bedroom. It was also obviously the primary reason for the doctor deciding to go out.
“Watson’s muttering to himself as he collects the balls for his next serve. Holmes is ready and waiting. Watson serves. Forehand down the line from Holmes, Watson manages to return it. Holmes bashes it back backhand. Watson down the line. Holmes gets it but Watson’s at the net for the half volley.”
"Not as such," the doctor admitted. "But we were Highlanders once. It's definitely in my blood, so to speak."
“Shouldn’t we tell them? Come on, Moriarty must be in violation of so many regulations. Player misconduct at least.”
“Rude, abrupt, demanding,” Greg said. “So same as ever. More uptight about your match than his, I’d say. He’ll be in a good mood now though—well, his version of a good mood anyway. But you don’t need me to tell you that. You’ll see for yourself.”
While the broad strokes of the tale - and the ensuing tales - were on the whole correct, certain details were changed to obscure truths too dangerous for public consumption; namely the condition with which I exist, and the true nature of mine and Holmes' relationship.
"So who was that then?" he asked, automatically motioning to the door the stranger had disappeared through.
He caught Sherlock’s sharp gaze, the mercurial eyes flicking over him as if trying to judge whether there was a gap between the words and how he really felt.
His stomach clenched as he knew without doubt who had posted that link and that their reason for doing so was far from good.
Locking the jeep, the doctor grabbed the bags he had taken from the vehicle and made his way to the cottage. For once the door was locked, the doctor fishing a set of keys out of his pocket.
“Well, it will probably be more of the same; Watson holding firm while Zhi Zhu tries to find a way around him. So it could be another close set with Zhi Zhu hoping that age and fitness will be on his side, especially considering this weather. That said, Zhi Zhu might feel that he has no choice but to come out here and attack more. Two sets down against a very recent Grand Slam winner, he might have to go for a change, try something new, take some risks. Zhi Zhu isn’t one to go down without a fight either, so whatever happens, I think we’ll end up seeing more points being won, and more errors, either due to the heat and tiredness, or because they’re both going flat out.”
The doctor tapped his fingers on the armrest but did not break the eye contact between them. "Stockholm syndrome," he said quietly after a moment.
Even taking into consideration body language and gestures, and his knowledge of other languages, he had little chance of following what was being said. The doctor, however, had no such problem, responding in kind and without hesitation, the words falling from his tongue as smoothly as if they were his first language.
He cocked his head. "Why? Because yesterday I showed to what extent I might go to escape? Or because today you were reasonably certain I would not go?"
Dumping his bags, Sherlock flung himself down on the sofa beside John. “Far from an easy match, but then it was the Wimbledon Champion, and you don’t win a Grand Slam by being an easy opponent.”
“Nadal’s.”  Sherlock motioned to the television currently on mute. “He’s just beaten Gilles Simons, 6-4, 6-4, 6-2. Pretty standard match. Still using his new serve and dominating from the baseline. Unsurprising result. Simons will be flying home tonight. I believe congratulations are in order.”
“No,” Sherlock replied, his hands moving to the arms of the chair. “While I admit I do have an ulterior motive from a professional point of view, from a relationship perspective I do not enjoy seeing you in physical discomfort, especially when I can go some way to alleviating it.”
“Watson serves. Holmes forehand. Backhand from Watson. Holmes, but it hits the net, and suddenly Watson gets another reprieve.”
There was a certain madness about going back into the house, like walking calmly to your own execution. Yet that was exactly what he was going to do, and both he and the doctor knew it. He was being manipulated, he knew that too, but he couldn't see that he had any other choice.
“While I may lack experience in these sorts of matters in regards to a romantic partner, if you require something… precise… in regards to your birthday celebration it would be prudent to inform me as I do not wish to impose or disappoint you in any-”
"So yes," he said with a lick of the lips and a tilt of the head, "amongst other things, I want to suck your cock."
And of course Sherlock would have an answer. He always had an answer, for everything, and he always had to have the last word. He would try to outlive God if it meant having the last word.
“If there is one player who knows about playing with or against precision it’s probably John Watson.”
“You close?”  John pressed his nose against the middle of Sherlock’s chest, shifting his arms once more to offer as much support as possible.
The doctor grinned. "In that case, this is how it is going to go. First, we are going to dance. Then we're going to kiss. Then... I'm going to bring you climax."
Of course, the choice may merely be nothing more than an illusion. He was only presuming that that was the key for the upstairs room, likewise that the other was for the Jeep, and from experience could he really assume that escape was truly possible? Or would he simply find himself back here in a few hours regardless, following some convoluted, seemingly inexplicable, highly improbable series of events?
"Perplexed by the seeming impossibility of this, one night I followed the gentleman in question and bore witness to his remarkable escapades. What I saw startled me to my core, shaking the very foundations of what I thought I knew. Feats of unusual strength he showed, followed by the easy attainment of a young lady merely by words, then, down an otherwise deserted alleyway, a physical transformation of his facial features and the appearance of what I can only describe as fangs. As he went to bite the young lady's neck, the sound of a police whistle startled us both and the next I knew, the gentleman in question had fled, scaling a seven foot wall with uncommon ease.
John closed his mouth with a click. For a moment he had no idea how to respond, then scrambling to his feet, he crossed the room and wrapped his arms around his partner, pulling him down into a tight hug.
His feet felt laden as he climbed each step. Behind him he heard nothing to suggest the doctor had moved from his place on the floor. It took effort not to look behind him, back down, when he reached the top of the stairs. Instead he pushed the bedroom door open.
“I thanked them and they left. Two weeks later I received a note by which I took it that the deed was done, and indeed I have found no trace of this individual since, and there have been no further bodies.”
A day earlier he had been planning his escape even at the expense of his text books and spare clothing. Today, with a means of escape easily within reach, he was hesitating.
Board Game - Tafl - an ancient Germanic and Celtic strategy board game played on a checkered or latticed gameboard with two armies of uneven numbers. Often referred to as Hnefatafl in contemporary literature, it spread with the Vikings and was widely played across Northern Europe until it was supplanted by Chess in the 12th centuries. For Discworld fans among you, it is the inspiration for Thud!
It was another side of the doctor, one he hadn't seen up until now; a carefree, almost younger side, unconstrained by the loss that fell like a shadow over him. Seeing him unreservedly strut his stuff to
“Fair enough,” John said with a laugh as he retreated back into the bedroom. “The blue shirt it is.”
They had played board games into the evening. They had talked, about nothing in particular really. After the initial mention of Harry, the other man wasn’t spoken of again. Neither was the reason why Sherlock was there in the first place. In fact, almost as if by silent agreement, they had avoided the personal after that.
Sherlock slowly relaxed his hands, uneasy about what he had unconsciously done. The doctor didn't comment, just caught one of his hands and tugged him gently towards the thick fur rug in front of the fire.
Considering that this was his third shower of the day, he wasn’t exactly dirty, but as requested he took his time, cleaning every part of his body while trying not to think exactly why he had been told to do so.
Andy Murray was once jokingly asked which male tennis player would he date if he was gay. He responded Feliciano Lopez.
Discarding the now soiled sock, Sherlock gave him a lazy grin as he tipped himself forward, squeezing teasingly around John’s length. “Problem?”
For the amount of time and investment Clara was putting into his case – for half her going rate of course thanks to his crafty negotiation during Wimbledon – he had to wonder how she had time to fit in the rest of her clients.
His kit bag. Of course. Why hadn’t he thought of that? It was so bloody obvious. His gaze fell to the bag near the door.
"You can't know that," John whispered. "Even if this works, even if he is who we both think he is, I took away his choice, and I did it because I'm weak and selfish and-"
There is a lot more behind this story, but I'm already running out of characters, so I can't explain everything here. I'm happy to take questions though, so let me know if you have any particular pressing questions and I’ll see if I can answer them.
What followed was an informative and actually rather fascinating instruction on ancient Scottish groups, the doctor surprisingly well versed on the pre-Roman civilisations, the land and the way of life.
Another deep in-breath and the doctor's posture straightened further, his shoulders pushing back, his chin tipping up a notch, no doubt unconsciously.
"I know you have no reason to trust me," he said finally, lifting his head so their eyes met again. "I haven't exactly given you reason to, but this is the truth. I will not purposely harm you, I will not touch you without your permission, and I will provide you with everything you need to leave this place the morning of the eighth day from now. All I ask that you give me a chance."
Other journals were solely artistic. Sketchbooks of all size and use littered the room; some bulging with additional pages, some barely used. Nature, landscapes, pencil, and colours. A beautiful reproduction in pencil of a human skull. Then people, figures, abstract body parts.
Oh god, if this was what being buggered meant then he would never think of it in a derogatory way again. For this he would give up a lot if that meant he could keep having it.
Fire followed; the smell of rubble after a bombing raid, of a musket just after it’s fired, of London choking on open fireplaces, of the flames that licked through an ancestral home, of a castle set alight by the soldiers in red.
He looked back at Sarah, fixing her with a rueful smile. “Not anymore apparently,” he said, because with that final shot they both now knew exactly who he was going to be playing in the next round.
Used manuscripts for Elgar, Schubert, Vivaldi, and all of Paganini's Caprices, amongst others, belied the doctor's comment regarding Harry's abilities. Out of practice Harry might have been perhaps, a novice unlikely. He was, therefore, loathed to pick anything that Harry might have played.
It had to be the drugs. This was all part of some elaborate plan to get him away from the drugs. Mycroft, it had to be. Somehow. Probably a spy amongst his course mates. And he's pulled in the good doctor to oversee his rehabilitation.
He automatically headed for the jeep parked a few feet from him. He had no expectations for it to be anything but locked, so was surprised when that too opened under his hands. There were no keys though.
The rest of the journey back to the hotel was uneventful, full of small talk and comfortable silences, and it wasn’t long before they were being dropped off outside. Confirming that he really didn’t need any help with his bags, they parted company, Greg free to do whatever it was he spent his time doing when he wasn’t running around after Sherlock, and John to hunt down his partner and claim his reward for the hard fought victory.
The view from the window had revealed hills and heather, but nothing in the way of other buildings or people. Doctor Watson had likewise not offered anything tangible other than to say that there was tea downstairs and to come down when he was ready.
"The same thing that happened to all these sorts of places," he said lightly as he started downwards again. "Time... and the English."
Cold water and shock had been enough to force back the arousal. It was bad enough that the doctor could not have failed to miss his resulting condition, he didn't need him also thinking he had rushed in here to finish himself off, so to speak. He wasn't that... virginal.
It was utterly perplexing, illogical even. The man downstairs was a kidnapper, an abductor, his actions far beyond what society would consider acceptable, and yet he was intelligent, funny, surprisingly unpredictable, and curiously easy to spend time with.
“Happy birthday to him for that. Of course, the wins here will moved him up the rankings as well. World number eight, that’s not a bad birthday present.”
He had been bitten. The doctor had bitten him. He remembered the pressure, then the pain, then the overwhelming everything, then the nothing.
Remember the game plan, Watson, he said to himself as he eyed his opponent across the blue of the Grandstand’s court. Keep him moving, challenge the backhand, and mix it up a bit.
version of the story out of her, but I don’t think you would be able to differentiate the facts from the fabrications. You would never know how much she told you was the truth.”
“He’s certainly the more experienced of the two players with tie-breaks. There were several memorable ones during Wimbledon and he held his nerve well. He’ll also go into this knowing that so far he’s taken more points off Zhi Zhu’s serve than Zhi Zhu has taken off his. Do we have the stats for that?”
John groaned, arching into the caress, lifting his hips in a desperate attempt for attention to be payed to where his erection was virtually quivering with need.
; a first edition (and also two later editions) of Gray's Anatomy; several publications by Stephen Hawkins.
"Mhm," Sherlock hummed. "Then there's seven years between Mycroft and me. I've never asked, but I don't believe that was planned either. The gap that is. I think they had hoped for something smaller."
The smile was again brilliant, and then the head ducked and there was heat and wet and so many sensations.
“And a second break for Holmes. Watson’s not happy with himself as the ball was call out. No point in contesting it. He knew it was out from the moment he hit it.”
“On your back,” he said, because at times like this watching Sherlock’s expressions made everything that much better.
"The Norrmalmstorg Bank Robbery," Sherlock repeated, pressing his fingers to his chin. "1973. Sweden. Two robbers, four hostages, six days."
“I thought perhaps a walk,” Sherlock said. “Clear our heads, aid digestion, and all that. Central Park is just over there and should be rather pleasant at this time.”
"Yes," the doctor said simply and turned away, the mutuality of the feeling not needing to be spoken.
The doctor's hair was still a little damp, parts sticking up more than usual. It was an odd detail to notice, but it was what it was.
"Holmes," I said, "I must confess that there is something else about me that I have not told you. It is something of great importance that I should have informed you of before now, but in truth I feared your reaction."
“Watson with the serve, but the ball clips the net and goes long. He lines up for his second serve. Holmes forehand return, Watson forehand, Holmes forehand, Watson, slice from Holmes, Watson gets to it, but the lob from Holmes soars over Watson’s head and bounces into the far corner of the court.”
injected, but this was not the come down from a cocaine high. This was... nothing. He remembered nothing. Everything was completely blank.
He groaned, dropping his head, because Sherlock had to know what speaking French did to him. This whole situation was perfection for him; a satisfied, pliant lover, warm and accepting of his thrusts, urging him on but not rushing, flexible, open, willing-
“Meanwhile, over at the Arthur Ashe Stadium, we’ll be opening with the women’s fourth round clash of Dominika Cibulková verses Svetlana Kuznetsova, which will then be followed by the third seed and French number one, Sherlock Holmes, taking on Oskar Heidegger. Holmes has impressed this tournament, dispatching his third round opponent of Sutton Blessington in just seventy-two minutes. Can he do the same here today?
Whatever words I had been planning were now completely lost to me, so it was with relief that he decided to continue the conversation himself.
Exiting the shower, he rubbed his palms over his cheeks and decided a shave would not go amiss and would certainly cut down on some of the stubble burn. After that he dealt with his teeth, before jumping back in the shower for a short follow up, double and triple checking that everything was clean, inside and out.
"I, John Hamish Watson, swear on the blood of my ancestors and the memory of my lost lover, that on upholding your agreement to actively and willingly participate to the best that you are able, activities of a sexual nature as mutually agreed upon, you William Sherlock Scott Holmes will leave this place, freely, in sound body and mind, without obstacle or restraint, with all that you came with and in full legal possession of the violin you are currently holding. This I solemnly vow."
Fuck, yeah! He’d not only managed to break the world number three, but he’d even managed to win the set.
"The individual in person was new to the city," he said. "An aristocrat of some small Eastern European country by his own claim, but a man of some considerable means. My own research yielded nothing on him, the title he claimed having lapsed some hundred and seventy years previous with a gentleman who curiously matched him in both description and name.
So this was it. He had checked through his match gear twice and read through Sherlock’s notes. He was as ready as he’d ever be. He just had to relax and make sure he harnessed all the nervous energy into something positive.
The river joyfully exited the wood with a bright twinkle before racing away downwards, breaking into a series of mini waterfalls as it went. At its end, sweeping outward in a silver shimmer lay a loch, enticing and still in the afternoon sunshine. Near one edge, grey and dull, rose the walls and towers of a former stronghold.
What was it Sherlock had told him during Wimbledon? 6-4, 6-3 for the only other match where they had faced each other, back when Sherlock was a fresh faced seventeen year old and John was at the height of his game. Not exactly close to the actual score.
“It’s called the End of Year Championships, darling,” she said. “London, the O2, it’s going to be huge for you. Home territory, large crowd, your favourite city, the perfect opportunity to raise your profile even higher. Sponsors are falling over themselves. You’re going to be busy.”
It confused him how readily the doctor seemed to be allowing him to go, but the other man made no move to either follow or stop him. Yes, he might have given his word that he would stay seven days, but surely the doctor was not naive enough to believe that he would necessarily keep it, especially when given the opportunity to escape.
His thumb rubbed against Sherlock's hand. "But it wasn't supposed to be perfect. It was what it was. Nothing more, nothing less. Understand?"
John walked quickly back to the sofa. “This,” he said, and shoved it unceremoniously into Sherlock’s face.”
“Two good serves there from Watson. No signs of nerves. He’s certainly unrecognisable from the player who used to crash out in the first round of minor tournaments.”
Sherlock jerked, cursing automatically as a shock of pleasure shot through him different from anything else he had ever felt.
He could hear his breathing getting louder, his pulse getting harder and faster. The pressure in his head slid back into pain and his mouth felt dry despite the recent drink. The reminder that he still needed to urinate came back to the forefront of his mind.
“That’s good to know. Won’t be cheap though. Should I ask how much this is going to cost on such short notice?”
"I want the violin," he repeated firmly. "And some of the sheet music," he added motioning to the pile on the table, "but mainly the violin."
He motioned for the window to be unwound, then waited patiently, seemingly mindless of how wet he was getting.
It was late September when the event finally occurred. It had been a little over nine months since we had taken the rooms together and six months following the events laid out in what has become known as "A Study in Scarlet".
It took all his will power not to reach for his cock, which by this point was throbbing with jealously. Christ, Sherlock hadn’t even touched him there yet and he was already ready to go off.
John reflectively flexed his toes. “Lovely, thank you,” he said. “Perfect size, very comfortable, a most thoughtful gift. I must ask my other half where they were purchased from.”
Great, even Sherlock knew about this nickname thing. He was never going to be able to look at Greg in quite the same way now.
. Whatever it was the doctor was seeing, it wasn't a pale, skinny, friendless freak. It wasn't the misfit, the outcast, the
Afterwards, he opted to stick to coffee and toast for breakfast. The unopened homemade honey had been a welcome surprise and he had helped himself but only after confirming to his satisfaction that it was indeed only honey.
The smell of the book was different, but it was still a version of the one he had devoured as a child amongst the gravestones. The one he had found in that box in the attic.
He retook his own seat in silence, watching the doctor with some interest, until the need to ask the most obvious question overtook him.
“The residential properties, yes,” Sherlock confirmed. “Not the commercial or investment ones though. Obviously.”
The words were cut off as John, having had enough, launched across and pressed his lips to his partner’s. Multiple thoughts crossed his mind, many of them in the form of a mild insult, but when he finally drew back to take in Sherlock’s rather surprised expression, there was only one word he felt he needed to say.
Stamford's last words to me, as we departed that first day, was that he would wager Holmes knew more about me than I did him. Confoundedly, Holmes had been spot on about me having lately returned from Afghanistan, although how he had known that I could not then fathom. I had not been completely surprised though. Every Sherlock I have known has possessed a keen intellect and well developed mind. I had been merely delighted that this Sherlock was obviously no different. I had no understanding at the point, however, of how much danger I had perhaps put myself in.
"No," the doctor said giggling, motioning to what he was struggling with, "that's two words. Too long, won't fit."
That didn’t stop Sherlock from looking a little nervous, the flickering candle light not managing to hide the artificial stillness of his body.
He gasped, he swore, he almost fell over forwards, he jerked his head around just to confirm what he thought had happened, and then....
"It started about five years past when my attention was drawn to a certain pattern of incident around particular parts of the city. First, two bodies washed up in the river inexplicably void of blood. Then, several incidents were reported where people awoke in an unfamiliar location with no memory of how they had gotten there or who they had been with. Next, several of the homeless and ladies of the night complained of unexplained disappearances. Then there was a third body, bloodless and without explanation.
Sherlock frowned, eyes darting around before they settled on the doctor. "You want me to-" he made a vague motion with his hand.
"This area was hardly what you might call peaceful before that, anyway," the doctor continued, brushing off his previous tone. "Before the British and the Clans, before a Saxon King tried to unite the southern kingdoms against the Vikings, before even the Romans came with their army, this was the land of the Caledonians and the Picts. Rival groups that lived, fought, and died side by side on this very ground."
Hands, lips, skin. Manual stimulation. Hands in particular. That was… not too alarming. He was no stranger to his own hand after all, even if the desire to do that was far less frequent than for some of his peers.
“Paris is a house. A town house I suppose you might call it. It seemed sensible to keep one there in particular considering the French Open and other tournaments. Also, it serves as a good base for attending meetings with sponsors and other European business people that I unfortunately have to deal with. I am, I confess, somewhat attached to the place so would rather retain it for the moment.”
In one thing, the doctor had been completely truthful; Harry had been both a mathematician and an artist. He had also been equally brilliant at both.
"A pen, my dear fellow!" he exclaimed with some amusement. "The mightiest weapon of them all. I simply used a pen and sent a short note addressed to the director of the club, and then I waited.
I’ll leave it up to you to figure out why the relevant board game for this part might include the word ‘escape’ in it.
"Perhaps now you will permit me further physical exploration," he said as I returned once more to my chair. "I confess to be rather eager to see you less encumbered by all those layers, and I speak as both a scientist and as a man. Tonight, for example, if you are amenable. After which, perhaps you would be so kind to tell me what was the true fate finally met by the Worthingdon bank gang."
"I've never told anyone," Sherlock admitted softly. Until now he had thought that no one had known. Well, not
They had been quiet since returning to the hotel, Sherlock lost in thought while John had checked his emails and decided it was a good time to update his blog. At the question he looked up from where he had been pondering his latest blog entry, his fingers resting on the keyboard.
"Aye," the stranger said with a tone of amusement. "So ye haena forgot me then." The stranger didn't stop there though, but whatever came next was lost in a stream of vowels and guttural noises that took Sherlock a moment to realise wasn't English, and another moment to realise was good for honest Scots Gaelic.
Something shifted in the doctor's expression at those words. It was almost as if something had hardened across the eyes. That was... unexpected.
Sherlock, the know-it-all, pig-headed arse, thought he knew better, and after a round of raised voices and clenched fists, had challenged him to reach the quarter finals at the US Open. And for some unknown but completely mad reason he had accepted.
Further movement. Steps around boxes and books, the opening of the wardrobe, cloth against cloth, pause, a puff of breath, further rustling, then the pleased exhalation of success.
“You think I would allow our personal circumstances to dictate how I play?” he said, his voice low and deep.
“So, what does Miss Adler want?” he asked as soon as he was free to wander back out again. “Three texts, must be important.” And it wasn’t as if they were the first texts Sherlock had received from her in the past few days. They were in town, she was in town, it made sense.
Sherlock pulled on an old t-shirt. “Irene contrived to have me away from the table just so she could talk to you. I trust she did so for good reason.”
"Yes. Uh. Sorry. Thanks." He reached for the offered mug, shivering slightly as the warmth from the drink met his cooler skin.
"I guess I do," the doctor admitted, smiling slightly as he gave a half look from where he was dealing with the pasta and vegetables. "So do you."
"'To the consequence that I may be forced to find another, for you, less palatable means of resolving the issue,' said I.
"Then as you got older, the insults became more creative. They picked on your unusual name. They picked on your family. They picked on your interests.
Head bent as if to listen better, Sherlock's brow furrowed as they both listened to the sound of the Righteous Brothers.
He fumbled for the bedside lamp until with a click soft light cut through the oppressive darkness. A glance at his watch said it was still early. Very early in fact. Too early.
It was, he realised, the first time he had heard the doctor sing. It was also the first time he had seen the doctor dance. It was... compelling. The tea towel the doctor was drying up with as he did so, only added to the whole picture. As did the lack of shoes that somehow allowed him to move more smoothly across the wooden floor. It should have been ridiculous.
“Lucky. Very lucky. But two consecutive points for Watson. You can hear it in the crowd. Hear the buzz. Could we be about to have the first break of the match?”
The doctor's lips twitched as if torn between remonstrating and laughing. "Overweight, certainly, from what I picked up," the doctor conceded. "But you make him sound obese."
"A fair amount," the doctor said. "It's all part of it. It's very... enjoyable, and I'm rather good at it." His smile was bordering on cheeky. It was a good look on him.
Clara’s snort of laughter was more than enough to confirm she had heard exactly what Sherlock had said, so there was no point in asking her if she wanted it repeated.
“Probably,” Sherlock conceded, “but it’s not that interesting. You already know the outline. We met, she seduced me, I stuck my hand up her dress. Usual story.”
“He’s got to be careful that he doesn’t let his frustrations show too much, or have them affect his play. He needs to harness it and turn it into something good, not cause him to throw it away.”
as he thought of it, primarily to seek an alternative hiding place for the pistol. A traitorous part of his brain pointed out that it wouldn't matter in the long run, as a man determined to end his life would find a way regardless of what anyone else might do.
Sherlock opened the passenger door, slipping out with a crunch under foot. The doctor had left the lights in the cottage on, which gave a welcoming feeling. Also it would be warm, or at least warmer than it was out here, and he was becoming increasingly aware of how damp his clothing were. Staying out overnight would have been miserable, even with a fire.
In action it was small, nearly chaste, and in another time and place could have passed for something wholly innocent, but in this time of reserve and morals, it spoke of far more.
The doctor startled for a moment, eyes snapping towards him, but then he gradually relaxed, a small smile crossing his face.
He snapped awake, hands flying to his neck as he yanked himself upright and sucked in a deep breath. There was nothing there, no mark, no puncture, no pain even, just smooth, unbroken skin, and a hazy memory of what had happened.
Later he had tried to hunt down another copy of the book only to be met with blank looks and sympathetic head shakes. In the end it was confirmed to have been a vanity publication, no more than a dozen in existence, and no record of any other surviving copies. Grieved, he had been forced to give up, accept the loss and move on.
It was just a man of average height and build, of nondescript looks, and carrying a tray while being engulfed by a beige Aran jumper.
. This was my bible as a child. Mycroft was naturally better at it than me, but I read it nearly every night. When the fire started I wasn't allowed to go back for it. Too dangerous, or so they claimed. I'm told that for a while I was inconsolable."
The water was a balm for his dry mouth and he had finished half before it even dawned on him to be mistrustful of a beverage from a near stranger, even if that stranger was a doctor. Slowing his sips, he then lowered the glass, watching as the man in question perched carefully on the bed beside him.
“Originally, Central Park was designed by the landscape architect and writer Frederick Law Olmstead, and the architect Calvert Vaux, who incidentally just so happened to be English.”
For a moment the doctor was radiant. All pent up emotion, barely contained in his compact frame, body virtually vibrating as his eyes bore into Sherlock's, pinning him in place, holding that moment for one second... two... three.
Even with this, Turing was far from a household name, and being a mathematician and computer scientist, his work was in fields that Sherlock had little interest in. It is no accident on my part as to why John might have heard of Turing but Sherlock has not.
He jerked slightly, the voice coming from much closer and the opposite direction from where he had been expecting. He had thought the doctor to likely be on the sofa, stretched out, staring at the fire. Or perhaps in his armchair, wrapped within a blanket. Or even maybe a statuesque figure by the record player, unmoving since setting the LP to play.
Then there was always the possibility that Harry had been just like him, an unwilling victim of another man's attention, brought and held here against his will, but the property showed no sign of a struggle. There were no questionable stains, no scratches on the furniture, no broken locks, and the simple matter was that it wouldn't take that much to overpower the doctor. There were knives in the kitchen, scissors in the drawer, even the
“Watson serves. Holmes backhand return. Watson forehand, Holmes forehand, Watson crosscourt, Holmes cuts it short, Watson at the net, Holmes… and what a passing shot there from Holmes. Watson flings a racket towards it but there was nothing he could do. Holmes planned that to perfection and he takes the break here in the third set.”
“Watson is a very strong position now, a double break up in this tie-break, but what can Zhi Zhu do to respond? Oh, and that was a lovely shot from the younger player. Watson barely got a racket to it.”
His body tingled and he pressed it further against the solid form before him, searching for the sensation, arching into it when he found it, keening when it was indulged. He felt gloriously engulfed, yet safe due to the support surrounding him.
They lapsed back into silence, broken only when the doctor paused to point out the hovering birds. A Kestrel mated pair apparently. Falco tinnunculus. The fading light made them hard to see though, so they quickly continued onwards and downwards.
Wrapping a blanket around his shoulders, he padded over to the wardrobe. So far he had ignored the clothes that hung in there, unwilling to don anything that might have belonged to his predecessor, but with the chill, the call of the heavy wool tartan dressing gown was too much to ignore. To his surprise it fell low enough to brush his calves, unlikely, therefore, to have belonged to either the doctor or his dead lover. It was, however, warm and somehow comforting, not too far removed from something he might have bought for himself should the need have arisen.
The doctor was funny. He was quick-witted and sharp tongued. He found humour in things other people would typically find too bleak or dark. Death did not disturb him, nor did talk of experiments on body parts. He was knowledgeable about a number of things, and although was not of exceptional intelligence, he was willing to listen to and encourage it in others.
Sherlock’s initial glance was a quick acknowledgement. His second look was of wide eye appreciation, caught mainly at the groin area.
The photographs each showed two men, the same two men, obvious even to the casual eye, but with one subtle, impossible detail; while one man clearly aged, the other did not.
Turning, he spotted both the box and the cupboard. Inside the first he found a curious array of board games, some that he recognised from his own childhood, some that he didn't; Jenga, Uno, Scattergories, Rummikub, Othello, Cathedral, Escape from Atlantis.
Turning, he found the doctor now watching him, a somewhat distant expression on his face. It was the first time he had seen the doctor with such a look and it was somehow sad.
was not what he had been expecting. He frowned as he looked up again and quickly confirming that Sherlock was completely serious.
Pulling himself up straight, Sherlock fixed his eyes on the other man and crossed the room. Stopping in front of him, he looked down, watched as the doctor automatically licked his lips in response, and decided that enough was enough. He swooped in for the kiss.
He should have been a top class player. He should have been right up there with the best. He should have had years at the top, as one of the names to watch, with all the prestige that came with that. He should have been a force to be reckoned with, just had he had always believed he could be, except then he’d crashed his car in a haze of grief, anger, and alcohol, and all of those beliefs, those dreams, those fantasies had come crashing down around him like a storm of hailing tennis balls.
He trudged onwards, following the general direction of the river until the small clump of trees hugging the foot of one of the hills became a much more significant forest of trees, into which the river plunged merrily.
It was only when his cock starting to try to thicken again that the kiss was finally broken, the doctor's smile rueful in a way that said he knew exactly what was happening.
Considering the pros and cons, he stepped out and pulled the door to behind him, before carefully making his way down step by step.
“Shhh,” Sherlock said, capturing his lips once more. “I’m trying to seduce you. Stop making it harder.”
The doctor had taken the space heater to the room and set it up under supervision and had then hummed to himself as he made lunch for them both.
The camera work was amateur, shaky and moved in and out of focus, but it did little to soften the devastation on Sherlock’s face as he sat frozen, eyes directed to the red clay below his feet, but clearly seeing nothing. Around him the noise was completely out of sync with his image, the sound of cheering, of clapping making the naked pain on his face even more obvious.
The slight flush to his cheeks said otherwise, but other than a knowing wink as he took another bite, John decided to go easy on his partner.
John’s lips twitched. “Just good?” he asked, then frowned as he noticed what Sherlock had used. “Wait, was that one of my socks?”
He resisted ending with too much of a flourish, preferring to let the final question and the notes slowly fade away into the stillness.
"I'm sorry," he heard suddenly, the words ghosting his neck as they were breathed into his shoulder. "Forgive me." And then fingers flexed around his cock as the mouth and teeth against his neck suddenly tightened against his skin. He gasped at the sudden sharp pain that stabbed through his neck as something pierced him.
His coffee had lost some of its heat, but he was no stranger to cool or cold coffee so swallowed it down without thought. It was just over two hours to sunset, an hour to the deadline he was obviously not going to meet.
Mycroft, however, would have been mortified when they tried to talk to him about sex and relationships.
That was... good. Being able to share with the doctor something he hadn't had with his previous lover, that was good.
Sex, obviously, but there were varieties, weren't there? Actively and willing, the doctor had said. So just lying there passively would probably not cut it. He would be expected to respond, to fake it if necessary.
Fortunately for him, that wasn’t outside the realm of possibility, which is why he now found himself in the player’s lounge, with a cold drink, a comfortable armchair and a good view of the match being played in the Arthur Ashe Stadium.
He had been cold for so long that he had forgotten what it was like to be warm; to be fed and content, wrapped in the arms of someone who loved him. To know he was safe, to be able to let his guard down, even for a moment.
It was the interesting side effect of this position; Sherlock couldn’t come without contact to his cock, and John couldn’t come from the position alone. He could feel the tiredness is Sherlock’s thigh muscles though, the faltering rhythm of their movements. He shifted his right arm again, sliding his left hand between their bodies, slipping at first on Sherlock’s erection before grasping it firmer and stroking in time to their movements.
The figure on the other end of the bench acknowledged him with a small smile before looking back over at the water.
That must have been when Harry had actually died. Sometime around the mid-1970s. Which meant that Harry had been dead longer than Sherlock had been alive for.
There was always the possibility that the doctor had fabricated the whole story about Harry in order to gain his sympathy, but the emotion he had shown while doing so had been too raw not to have had some grounding in some sort of reality.
“And what’s that?” John had asked jokingly. “A dodgy shoulder? A deluded partner? The weight of British expectations on his shoulders?”
Mechanically, he gently plucked the G-string, hearing the discord, before tightening the corresponding peg and repeating until the note rang clear and true. At once the instrument seemed to quiver in his grasp, as if desperate to be once more fully heard.
A light run of the doctor's tongue against his lips and then the kiss was broken, the doctor stepping in so they were dancing closer together, bodies pressing together.
For a short while, Doctor Watson had been a part time GP at their doctors surgery. Polite and proficient, he had been liked well enough for the fifteen or so months he had been there. Then he had moved away and life in the village had continued as it always had.
He whined as the movement suddenly stopped, then strong hands were pulling him upright, pressing him down until he was fully seated on the doctor's lap. An arm wrapped around his chest, anchoring him, mouth burying into his neck, kissing and licking, all tongue and warm breath.
There was a pause and then Sherlock’s body stiffened and he pulled away, out of John’s arms and into a seated position. His eyes were narrow, his expression surprisingly hard as he turned to face John.
John shook his head slightly and tried not to smile too broadly in case it inflated Sherlock’s ego too much further. The truth of the matter was that they had always known they were likely to meet at some point in this or a future tournament. They had even joked about it once it became certain that John was returning to singles. It was the way things went in a knockout competition. If they were both seeded in the top eight then there had been a one in four chance of meeting in the quarter finals and a one in two chance of meeting in the semi-finals, provided neither of them got knocked out in an earlier round of course. Then once it had become clear they had been drawn in the same half of the pack this time it had merely become inevitable.
Then he was moving away again, humming and still sort of dancing as he put away the recently used mugs.
The air that smacked him in the face was cool and a bit sharp, very different from the soft warmth he had become accustomed to inside the house.
“Good serve there from Watson, with everything on it. It looks like he’s not going to simply hand this game to Zhi Zhu.”
Not if you planned to murder me, Sherlock thought. Too many people have seen them together now. There was too much evidence to deny a connection between them.
The warm puffs of air were joined by a gentle caress down his cheek that was somehow both soothing and sustained the sensations lower in his body. He leant into it, wanting more, but was confused when he didn’t get it.
Zhi Zhu was an unknown to John. He’d barely even heard of the guy and certainly had never played him. More surprisingly though, Zhi Zhu was also an unknown to Sherlock, which meant there was no notebook of secrets, and no fool-proof game plan to give him the edge. This was going to be completely new territory.
The smile was brilliant and it sliced through any anxiety he still had to the point where he almost wanted the boxers off already just so the doctor would keep looking at him like that.
The doctor inexplicably seemed to find the whole thing overly amusing. "You took a second packet of biscuits," he said. Paused, then added, "I mean, you also took matches, which while useful are reasonably superfluous if you also take a torch, which you did, unless you planned on needing them for something other than light, which you also did. But for the most part, it was the biscuits."
"But-" why would the doctor willingly offer such a thing, especially with no expectation of the same in return? It didn't make sense. It was all about the receiver, wasn't it? At best it was a sacrifice on the behalf of the giver. In certain circumstances it was downright degrading. His fellow college mates had always talked about it in the most derogatory terms, often bragging
The doctor hummed slightly, sitting back as he cradled his mug. "Ah, yes, I can see why you would think that."
“You’re doing this on purpose, right?”  He dragged his eyes up to where Sherlock was watching him with an overly amused expression. “You’re trying to distract me from your bullshit by seducing me?”
He thought the doctor would be scornful, or that he would be laughed at, but the doctor merely gave a nod and straightened his shoulders, chin tipping upwards as he raised his right hand.
Hands held him without moving, a solid figure supported him without somehow adding to the maelstrom around him. It was like an unmoving force to which to anchor against. And he sought it out, sinking his fingers into fabric and muscle, clinging on with all he had.
“God yes.”  A little rearranging and fumbling later and he was sliding back in with a contented sigh. Sherlock was warm and supple following his orgasm, easily accepting the thrusts now he was past the point of overstimulation, whispering encouragement but more than happy to lie back and take what John was giving him.
“It’s the breaks that really matter. Watson won’t want this match to drag on, especially as it’s only going to get hotter, but he has to hold it here.”
“Dordogne is the family home, of which I have little legal control, so they will have to remain in my name. Madrid and Florida are just flats that I used mainly for training earlier in my career and so have no real emotional connection to. If need be, they can be easily replaced with joint properties to both our liking.
He hadn't really thought anything of it at the time, too caught up in all the other things he had been bombarded with. But he had automatically absorbed the information, filing it away for later.
“No reason why you can’t do both. Three things, in fact, if you throw in your other half as well, and we both know you play and interview considerably better when you’re getting all up close and personal with your crazy frog. Tell him he’s not getting off the hook, by the way. I’ve been speaking to that silver fox of his and we may have a thing or two up our sleeves, and
“Now that’s the Watson I remember seeing at Wimbledon. Remember some of those almost impossible shots he pulled off against Moriarty? The third and fourth sets in particular.”
The figure loitered by the jeep, eyes scanning, searching, but then shoulders slumped as he obviously failed to find what he was looking for. The bags were placed slowly into the passenger seat footwell, and again the figure then stopped and looked round, tapping his long fingers against the jeep door. Another minute, another seemingly endless wait, then
"Yes," the figment of Harry said. "But I'm not real. He is though. Time to start living again, my love."
He gasped as they drew apart, fingers tightening as he registered that they were clenching the doctor's polo shirt, but then the doctor's arms raised above his head and there was only one thing to do.
“The pressure Watson’s been piling on is really now making a difference. Since that scare earlier he’s come back out here and he’s been playing the game he wants to play, answering everything that Zhi Zhu has thrown at him with good, clean strikes. Nothing particularly fancy, just well timed, well placed, decisive shots, and Zhi Zhu is started to buckle.”
Sherlock huffed but at least allowed him to take his time in opening it. Clothes he was expecting, something designer most likely, understated hopefully, but expensive and well made. What he did not expect was for three double packets of white sports socks to fall out. He turned them over, yup, they were definitely socks. Nice socks, expensive socks, but still socks.
It was worth it just for the expression on Sherlock’s face. John knew he wasn’t the best actor in the world, but he could hold an innocent expression for a few seconds, long enough for Sherlock to frown and give him the once-over. Then the eyes narrowed and somehow he had a lithe, demanding Frenchman crawling onto his lap.
You can win this, John Watson, he told himself as he shifted the position of his baseball cap to help with the sun. No, he corrected as he bounced the first ball, you
"Good," the doctor said after a moment. "Now," he motioned to the heater, "should I take this to the bedroom, or would you prefer to?"
“I… uh… alright, yes,” John said. “Sometimes. Six months ago I was retiring because I could no longer support myself by playing. Now look at me. I’m staying in penthouse suites and flying business class. No,” he said quickly, stopping Sherlock from interrupting, “I know the reasons and I know I’m paying towards it, it’s just sometimes I’m suddenly reminded that you’ve won more prize money in the past six months than I have in the past six years, Wimbledon included. Then there’s what you get in sponsorship, appearances fees and investments. So sometimes, yeah, sometimes I’m reminded that I’m with a younger, fitter, richer man than I could have dreamt of, let alone deserve, and I want to make sure I put into this relationship as much as I take out. Alright?”
It took a moment to register that the doctor had said 'steak' not 'stake' and to figure out that he was being asked a question about food.
A fugue contains more than one musical line playing simultaneously in counterpoint, so humming all the parts of a fugue simultaneously is impossible. Something, I’m sure, Harry pointed out on more than one occasion.
"I thought you would appreciate everything in writing," the doctor said. Standing by the hob, he clutched a newly made steaming mug of tea, wearing, Sherlock found himself noting, the same beige jumper he had when they had first talked a week earlier.
Damn, he’d walked into that one. He had to remember that Greg was far more devious than he appeared. Well, he had worked for Sherlock Holmes for more than five years so he would have to be.
“Why would I give you a necklace?” Sherlock huffed. “Really, your thought processes manage to be both pedestrian and absurd.”
"There you are. You disappeared for a moment there, which is fine, just so you know, but then you started to hyperventilate, which, as a doctor, I consider to be a little less fine. So, you okay there?"
Sucking in a deep breath, he held it for a moment before letting it out, cocking open an eye to take in the sight of his hair mussed, lip swollen partner. Groaning in appreciation, he closed his eyes again and set about rolling into a semi comfortable face down position which didn't put too much pressure on his groin.
“Something like that,” John said with a grin. And wondering how Sherlock would take being called that he followed the steward out towards the court.
"Excuse me?" The hardness had given way to confusion. He had obviously failed to make the rather obvious connection between the two things.
It was like when Daddy had tried to explain things when he had been a child. When they had moved to that new house and suddenly they were being introduced to other children. And it had been horrible and all, 'it's not
"I am quite amenable," I said, with a shake of my head. "On both those points. But permit me just a further moment of disbelief. It is hard for me to accept that you have known what I am for all this time. In all my years, this is not something that has happened before."
That comment alone deserved a wisecrack and a grope, both of which had Sherlock groaning before slipping off his lap to divest himself of his t-shirt and jeans. Hands on hips, eyebrow raised, he somehow managed to make being aroused and stark naked look dignified.
Touch starved would have been another way of putting it. He couldn't remember the last person, other than his parents, he had physically embraced.
He raised his eyebrows. Sherlock’s tone had been a little too smug-like. “You don’t think I could?” he said.
He pointed out a few of the people around them. The woman behind the bar whose family had owned the place for at least four generations. The man in the corner who owed a farm, although he no longer ran it day-to-day if the cuffs on his trousers were anything to go by. The older retired couple who always sat in the same place, at the same time of day and ordered the same choice of food and drink.
He shrugged in acknowledged but figured it would at least break up the quiet. He pondered for a moment, hand drifting across the classical section, before he found himself pulling out one from the new pop selection. It wasn't one he recognised - unsurprising since his popular music knowledge was very limited - but he was curious as to the type of music the doctor listened to. This one in particular showed signs of repeated use.
Of course it bloody well was. While he knew he wasn't unattractive, he was also far from conventionally handsome. The very small number of people who had ever shown an interest in him physically had all retreated quickly the moment he opened his mouth. Yet here he was with someone who called him brilliant and wanted him so much they had resorted to kidnapping.
John looked away, the memories once again threatening to overwhelm him. They had been so happy back then, so carefree. They had had no inkling then that that would be the last time they would be here together.
He grabbed the towel and scrubbed it over his face and arms. God it was hot. So much hotter than Wimbledon.
The ease to which the doctor had brought him to orgasm was surprising, as was the strength of his climax. Although limited in his sexual experiences with others, he was more than capable of sating his own biological needs. Nothing had ever felt quite like that though.
He twirled his mobile in his hand. It was a nervous habit more than anything, his last connection with the wider world before he went out there and became the centre of attention for ten thousand spectators and countless television, radio and web viewers.
Sherlock nodded, and then with nothing else to say, added, "My father used to make this. Mainly for mother, when she was having one of her moments. Sometimes for me or Mycroft as well."
"Sorry," the doctor said, temporarily covering his mouth with his hand. "It's a common... no wait, did you seriously not notice when shops started opening on a Sunday?"
Scooting down the bed, Sherlock crouched over him, head tipped to one side as if studying the sight. Then started one of the best blow jobs John had ever had. No hands, just tongue and mouth, and it was glorious.
This, at least, gained his attention, as I had counted that it would. As little as he might think of himself in such matters, I had come to know a little of the esteem he seemed to hold me in.
"I love you," he murmured fiercely, sliding his hand up until he could toy with a sweat laden curl, so unique to this version. "I love you so much."
“Watson serves, Zhi Zhu returns, Watson forehand, Zhi Zhu forehand down the line, Watson backhand, Zhi Zhu crosscourt, Watson, and it clips the net and goes wide.”
He tried not to look so surprised to see her. With the success that she had found with Molly Hopper in ladies doubles he should have expected to see her. He had just been so caught up in other things that it had not crossed his mind that she might still be around.
Suddenly weary, Sherlock sank down on a nearby rock, shucking his bag from his shoulders. He ate his sandwiches in silence, staring down into the valley. The breeze bit coolly into his cheeks despite his turned up collar. For a moment he wished he had brought the silly looking hat he had found with the coats. As ridiculous as he would have looked, the ear flaps would have added some protection from the elements.
"Wasn't a difficult deduction," the doctor said with a wry smile. "Distance, terrain, speed. You wanted to make me think you were following the road, then turned off when you thought you were out of sight. You took the river south because regardless of where we are, England is south. Even if you had stayed on the road, I likely would have passed you on my way out. How'd you like your steak, by the way? I got some while I was in town."
Then a series of pictures in an array of clothing; Edwardian double breasted coat; second World War soldier; Victorian tweed with period moustache; Highland garb with what he presumed was Watson tartan.
Spreading the manuscripts across the dining table, he lifted the Strad to his chin - truly a prince among instruments - pulled the bow across the strings and started to think.
“This is what you do, isn’t it?” he said with a small smile. “Offer advice to couples? You ever thought of getting your own chat show?”
"Do only what you feel comfortable with," I continued. "Say only what you truly believe or desire. But above all, be true to yourself and to me, and we will find our own way."
Checking his bag for the final time, John mentally counted off all the things he needed for the match before, satisfied, he zipped it up. He was ready. All he needed to do now was wait.
They took seats in a corner, to one side of the fire. The warmth was welcome, even after the relatively short time spent outside between the jeep and the pub, and was more than enough to justify the removal of his borrowed coat.
Far more informed than he had been a week ago, he could now picture just how the room once might have been; with the two missing paintings on the wall, notebooks and pens scattered across the bedside table, a terrible jumper thrown over the back of the chair.
It didn’t take long to find Greg afterwards, but he was a little surprised to discover it was actually Greg waiting for him and not one of the security guards.
Frowning slightly, he crossed to the cupboard itself. Something was nagging at him, something about the games, something his conscious mind couldn't quite pull together.
Closing the door behind him, he shouldered his bag and set off on the road. His plan was still rather vague, but for the most part it consisted of following the gravel road until he was definitely out of sight and then cutting southwards on the first path, trail or track he could find. While the road would be easier to walk on, it would also make him too easy to find, and he had no intention of being back at that cottage by three.
It seemed almost silly now that he had once thought the room might have had a more nefarious purpose.
He had known where this was going, of course he had known, but once again the doctor had managed to make something so significant into a simple statement and had delivered it with his deceptive mildness.
"None of this, though, gives a clue as to location as period properties can be found all over. The fading of the wallpaper says south-facing. The shadows say early afternoon. It’s raining. There was no rain forecast for Cambridge, so either I’ve been out for a lot longer than I believe, or we’re not in Cambridge any…more….”
Pulling his hands away, he quickly cupped the doctor's face, brushed his thumb across the lines below the doctor's eyes, and swooped down for a kiss.
As he looked round, took in the mess and clutter that comes from so much in such a small space, Sherlock considered the truth that up until then had been not fully formed in his mind: the doctor was lonely.
He showered carefully and thoroughly, paying greater attention to particular parts of his body than he normally would.
