“You really can’t stand me, can you?” Tony called to Steve “It’s kind of impressive—I’ve never actually had someone this pissed off at me for no apparent reason. I usually give pretty good reasons, too.”
His suit had transformed into a dark, stormy grey, complete with edgy tapering and smoky shoes. Apparently, Steve’s suit changed to match his mood — but Tony was too angry to feel anything than minor fascination.
“That
“Don’t insult my name calling.”
“It’s a nickname.” Tony explained, “Barbie’s guy.”
“So is hypothermia!” Tony exclaimed, incredulous. “Or did you want to strip and spoon for warmth?”
Like all the other times he had tried to shut off his brain—without the help of a handle of vodka—it didn’t work well. But denial had always come easy to him, so he kept silent, and they kept walking.
“I don’t even think I was this confused when I had suddenly grown a foot and gained abs from a science experiment.” Steve breathed out.
Tony shrugged, fighting off the grin that always came when someone appreciated his work. “They’re nice, yeah? I designed them myself.”
Tony opened his arms to either side, gesturing to the space around them. In this room he was.
century. We know that’s not true. But Steve Rogers was born in a time where the enemy was easy to spot. They marked themselves with swastikas.”
Steve’s posture sagged with relief, mirroring Tony’s own. They weren’t crazy. Or, at least, he wasn’t going crazy alone.
this team to protect our small, helpless solar system. Earth needs the Avengers. And
“Iron Man.” Rhodey said, with a mixture of apprehension and understanding in his voice.
Thanks for reading
“I blame you.”
At least it was warm, Tony thought.

Exasperation lined Steve’s face, aging him. He pulled at the bottom of his coat. “You don’t even know what this game is, and yet you want to play?”
—I meant—” Steve gave up and rolled his eyes. He
“The whole thing rides on them,” Coulson added. “Think about it: without Tony, there’s no innovation, funding, and audacity. We’ve all seen what he did in Afghanistan, building that suit with nothing.” He paused, “but he fights only for himself. ”
Tony filled the cup in silence. It was a good call, and he congratulated his brain for the decision. It was too late at night for words—or was it too early in the morning?. At what point did late become early? That was always a confusing concept, and someone should have established the right name for it by now.
“There’s a couch in there!” Tony protested.
Steve called out to the empty room, hearing nothing but his soft echo in response. The small, long table at the front was abandoned, the shop as quiet as the entire town.
“Spoiled billionaire, actually.”
“Like Netflix?”
Tony was no longer flying.
Tony barreled down the path—wilder than nature itself, letting out steam on the branches that he violently yanked out of his path and the rocks that he aggressively hurdled himself over. He hated how aware he was of the space between him and Steve. It wasn’t enough.
“Not all of the time, no. Just mostly.” He should have stopped there, but he was awake now—and having too much fun. “Out of the two of us, who graduated from MIT at 15 and earned PhDs in physics, mechanical engineering and electrical engineering when he was 17? When Bruce is around, I wouldn’t make the claim, but you can be damn sure that you still wouldn’t be able to insult my intelligence then, either.”
Hair clung to his forehead as he broke free, and water poured down his face. His clothes clung to his shaking body, threatening to drag him under again. Tony kicked furiously, trying to keep them from going numb as much as he was trying to stay afloat.
“Very smooth Stark,” Natasha replied dryly, “Can we just get this show on the road?”
“No no, Steve your ribs-”
Another man entered the room and it was none other than Justin Hammer. All Tony could think was: You’ve got to be fucking kidding me. Again.
Tony laughed at the tickling sensation, “Wow someone is super affectionate tonight.” He teased, “Who knew the captain was such a softie.”
“Get out where?” Tony asked rubbing his face, he wanted to run up to Steve, but they hadn’t talked about how they would act in front of the others, or in public for that matter. He wouldn’t blame Steve if he wanted to keep it a secret, if he were Steve he probably wouldn’t want people knowing he was dating Tony Stark. All those doubts washed away as soon as Steve spoke.
“What, he told you about the bet?” Natasha asked, “And more importantly, Clint you owe me!”
Tony sighed, he took a minute  “Nothing it’s stupid.” He tried to explain, but then looked up at Steve. “It’s just everyone, Fury, Pepper, Rhodey, they all keep telling me that I’m irresponsible and take things for granted. I’m told to ‘behave or else’.” He said looking down “No one believes in me, or even likes me.” He said quietly.
“Hell we wouldn’t even be here now if it weren’t for him!” Exclaimed Clint, “The Nuke would’ve blown us to bits, or it most likely would’ve.”
They headed into their room and all of a sudden Tony became emotional again. At Steve’s worried glance Tony explained.
“Last night was… I can’t even put it into words, Tony.” Steve said, shaking his head, “I just…. have never felt so alive and I am the luckiest man on the planet to call you mine.”
Three more thrusts was all it took and Tony was cumming, “Steve!” He shouted, “I’m gonna—” and then he clenched around Steve with white hot cum splattering on his stomach as he cried out loudly in pure bliss.
“Yes the Man of Iron is not only just a comrade but a brother to us all.” Thor said solemnly, “He gives us not only a shelter but a home.”
“I have all the ingredients ready.” Steve said, but then smiled mischievously, “But I’ll only make my world famous burgers if you’re good.”
Everyone just laughed and agreed, then they all decided to watch Lord of the Rings.
As Tony tried to spit it out Donald walked over to grab a bucket of water. He brought it over and used the cloth to cover Tony’s mouth and face. He poured the water over the cloth and began to waterboard Tony.
“Goodnight, love.” He said with his eyes closed, however Steve didn’t fail to notice the light blush that spread on his lovers cheeks.
He quickly shook himself at that thought, what else could it possibly be? He was Tony Stark after all, the only reason he was even on the team was because he was rich and could build them tech.
As Tony came back to himself, he took in everyone around him. His team, his family was here with him. They saved him and now he got to come back home. Happy tears started to come to his eyes.
“Ah now it all makes sense! This is why you are the leader of the Avengers. Forget saving the world, you just need the admiration and cheers of adoring fans.” Tony added.
Steve walked out of the lab a bit sad that Tony didn’t want to talk, but determined not to let himself  be pushed away.
“Would you… would you want me to explain it to you? Show you how it works?” Tony asked hesitantly, like he was expediting an immediate rejection.
All of a sudden a giant robot, the same as the one from the battle before, grabbed him and knocked him out.
“No you’re right, you’re incredible.”
Tony was very tempted to just dismiss himself and retreat down to the workshop, but Steve had been making an effort lately. He thought he should at least try to return the favor.
Steve dropped his hands to his sides, “Oh he was just telling me that Fury called him on a last minute mission, he was upset because tonight we agreed that he would be the first person to show me some movie called Wall-e? He says it’s the best Pixar film.”
When both Clint and Thor lost, it was between Steve and Natasha.
They both learn so much about each other this way, coming together for comfort. Consequently, they become really close friends and the team starts to notice, none of them really mind because there are nights where they all hangout to help each other.
About an hour later Tony was released from Medical. Bruce said it was fine but just to be sure Jarvis scanned him one last time. However it just confirmed what they already knew: Tony was healthier and stronger than ever.
“No Tony there isn’t anything I need you to sign.” Pepper sighed pinching the bridge of her nose, “I have been asking for weeks that you finish your clean energy stabilizer for Stark Industries and you still haven’t done it.” She said sounding frustrated.
Steve ignored him, taking the cup and faking a sip, “Wooow Dum-E this is delicious, great job!” Steve smiled.
“No, none of that Tony,” Steve interjected, “She was helping me out, nothing more. I told you that you are the one I want to be with Tony.” He said, reaching out to grab his hand.
Tony tried not to think about that.
Fury scoffed, “Stark really said that?” He said rolling his eye, “If anyone is going to do that to the team it’s him.”
Tony sat there in complete shock, of all things he was expecting to hear, this was definitely not it. He was healed? Completely? He thought for sure he would die and if not have to deal with damage the rest of his life because of how brutal Hammer had been.
“Yeah, Tony is special to us all.” Bruce said, “I don’t think even he realizes how important he is to this team.”
“Oh come on Tony don’t be like that. Just fess up so I can get what’s owed to me.”
“Bruce thought it would be nice to go to the fair tonight, so clear your schedule.” Steve said.
“Hey now, I’m the sarcastic one in this relationship.” Tony said, in a warning tone.
“This won’t take long.” Pepper said and walked away.
Pepper immediately shot him an award winning smile, “Good Morning Steve, back from a run I see.” Tony just rolled his eyes and crossed his arms over his chest.
“Tough night, Thor?”
The kiss was passionate and breathtaking. Steve didn’t need anymore explanation from Tony, they were both overwhelmed in the best possible way.
“Deal.”
“One second.” Donald smiled. He walked over and grabbed a camera that was mounted on a stand. He picked it up and put it on the other side of the table, opposite to where they were standing by Tony. He pressed it on to record and gave Justin a thumbs up.
“Yes, Tony?”
He tried not to think of the recording. He knew it was their voices, but deep down he knew they had been tricking him. He needed to believe that.
“Tony, be nice please.”
Tony was back at it again in his lab working on the last of tech for the Avengers. He was happy, recently things with his team had been taking a turn for the better, they were starting to become something like family to him. He quickly shook himself out of those thoughts, he couldn’t dare to hope for anything like that. If things with Pepper lately were any indication, he’d just end up an irritant and a disappointment.
He would ask Steve to marry him, sooner rather than later. He knew he wanted to, he knew he had a future with Steve. He knew Steve was the one and he’d be damned if he let that go.
Tony paled and began to breathe deeply. He willed himself to be strong. It was just pain, he had dealt with it before. He just had to be strong until the Avengers found him.
“It’s better than doing nothing!” Steve said, “And it’s better than the other options.”
Tony was on the common floor when Rhodey spotted him.
“Good.” Steve said smiling, “Now I think it’s time for you to get some sleep. Jarvis told me  you are running on next to nothing except coffee.”
“No because he’s my teammate and I take care of my teammates.”
“Yeah I’m installing new upgrades don’t worry. And your suit is now bullet and flame proof.” Tony supplied quickly.
After the battle had finished, everyone came out tired but relatively okay. Overall the team had performed as a unit. Natasha came out with a sprained ankle but luckily that was the worst of it.
So this is the longest chapter I’ve written. I really hope you guys like this. I’ve taken a few liberties here and I know that this is probably not how Steve’s serum works, but I really like the idea of what happens in his chapter. Remember this is fiction haha. Let me know what you think :)
“Tony you have to understand, we all love you. Losing you was horrible.” He said, pulling Tony onto his lap so they were face to face and as close as can be. “Anthony Edward Stark, don’t think for a second that the recording you heard was true. I absolutely adore you and love you so fucking much. I was empty without you. Do you understand?” He said, fully crying now.
The guards lifted him up from the table and stood him up. After that, they took out chains that locked around his wrists and then connected it to more chains that locked around his ankles.
They kissed, soft and sweet at first. They were exploring, testing the limits. Tony deepened the kids and wrapped his hand around Steve’s neck and ran his fingers through his hair.
The next morning they woke up in each other’s arms. Tony began to stir and then Steve was quick to follow.
Once they sat down, Tony immediately began playing footsie. They both played around until Tony finally took a bite of the burger.
“Sir I really advice that you take a break. Your body scans are showing that if you don’t rest within the next few hours you’ll collapse from exhaustion.”
“Haha okay, not a word. Got it.” He said pulling back smiling brightly.
Tony melted him in after that. He looked up and Steve and smiled shyly, “I’m sorry about that, I don’t know what came over me.”
“Hi” Tony said, sitting on the bed and fiddling with the sheets.
“Wow when that’s incredible! Let me know if there’s anything I can do to help. I know I’m no scientist but I’m always here.” Steve smiled.
A few minutes later Bruce shouted with victory, “Steve I did it.”
“Tony it’s fine, I understand. It was childish and we weren’t sure how Fury was going to take it. It’s all good, no worries, we are fine.” He said smiling.
“Tony?” Steve asked confused.
“Tony, look at me now. Please.” He said, then reached out and carefully placed his hand on Tony’s arm to guide him around.
“You don’t need to thank me, Tony.”
“Yes there is a warehouse on the outskirts of New York under the name of a distant relative. However I had to hack into several servers to find that.”
“Maybe we can go in a week or two.” Thor said.
At the noise, the others awoke.
“Steve, what do you want?” Tony asked sounding irritated.
“Bottom. I want to feel you in me.” Tony said, then pulled Steve in for another kiss.
Natasha sat down next to Steve and took his hand in hers. She knew that he needed the physical support.
Steve just grinned and shook his head, then placed down a royal flush.
“It’s okay Cap, don’t worry about me. The big guy and I have been doing better, oh also remember that serum I was telling you about? I’ll need your help with it soon if you can.” Bruce replied shyly.
“You haven’t Tony.” Steve said vehemently. “You have saved the world, given so much back to it. And you saved me too.” Steve said looking down.
Steve was very nervous, he had no idea how Tony would respond to this. He wanted to give something to Tony, something that he couldn’t just buy. That already was an extremely complicated concept itself, not to mention Tony was a billionaire who could buy literally anything he wanted and on the rare occasion he couldn’t buy it, he could just build it himself.
“Well it sounds to me like there are some big misunderstandings going on.” Steve said.
“Yeah, yeah.” said Clint.
“Steve… you came?” He asked weakly, as happy tears streamed down his face.
“Come here.” Tony said, making grabby hands at Steve.
They could all see the happiness and emotion coming off of Tony in waves.
In this chapter Tony gets water boarded as punishment but it doesht go on for very long. Then Justin Hammer carved letters into Tony’s stomach with a knife. Then Tony’s arc gets used to power weapons against his will, he is also force fed some pills.
Thor saw Tony’s opened eyes, “Brother Anthony! You have awakened!” He said joyously.
“Jarvis we need some sort of code that will disable bombs.”
Steve momentarily pulled away to grab the supplies but then stopped, “Um Tony, I’m not trying to make you uncomfortable or anything but, do you want to use a condom?” He asked, when met with silence he hastened to explain, “I can’t catch anything and I can’t give you anything either. I’m clean but still I don’t want you to feel obligated—”
“The only reason I left the room at all was because if I didn’t Bruce would be let down. He was trying to create a serum that could better control the hulk and he needed my blood to do it. If I didn’t go right away everything would’ve been ruined. The timing of it all did suck and I was surprised, but I’m not unhappy.” He stepped closer to Tony, “I want a press conference ASAP because I want no assumptions whatsoever. I want the world to know that I love Tony Stark.” He said in a hushed voice filled with conviction.
Tony just smiled back, then got up and said, “Who wants popcorn?”
He eventually passed out on his workbench due to exhaustion. The only reason he woke up was because Jarvis was speaking to him.
After Tony was finished, Steve made quick work of kissing every inch of Tony’s chest, however when he got to the arc reactor he felt Tony freeze.
As Steve turned around he saw Tony’s scared expression and quickly walked to the other man.
Tony rested his head against Steve shoulder. “Yeah well I didn’t really feel this way before, just with you. I want a home not just a house.”
“Sir I strongly advise you get some sleep. You haven’t for the past 48 hours and have consumed nothing but coffee since then.” The AI cut in.
“I have something for you Steven.” Thor said.
“Well Tony, I don’t know how much you remember but we rescued you from Hammer. Don’t worry he’s gone.” Tony’s grip tightened.
Tony hadn’t felt anything so sexually satisfying before in his life. He felt Steve’s warm spend fill him up and felt marked in the best possible way.
“That’s total bullshit Tony.” Steve said and Tony looked shocked. “The team absolutely loves you and I think you know that. And we’d all be happy to tell anyone of them a piece of our mind.” Steve the added, “We are the ones who don’t deserve you. Now come up and come spend dinner with your family.”
Tony moaned in response and trusted towards Steve’s fingers, clearly inviting him to do more. “God Steve, you’re such a tease.”
“Alright sounds good.” Steve said quickly the walked out.
They all immediately got up and met at the commonfloor.
At Bruce’s confused expression, Thor quickly filled him in, “Anthony is gravely injured, we needed to get him here as soon as possible.”
Steve rolled his eyes, “Shut up Clint, I was just helping him.”
“It’s beautiful, Tony. Absolutely stunning.” Steve said, grabbing Tony’s hand, “Thank you for everything Tony. We don’t deserve you.”
Steve just smiled back bashfully, “Well I’m glad you like them Tony.” Steve said, “And now that I’ve got you out of the workshop what do you say we order in some Chinese?”
Tony hadn’t gotten to hangout with Steve for a few days and it was starting to affect his mood. Whenever he wanted to hangout with Steve something always came up. The one time he managed to find Steve alone, he was on the phone with Thor. A phone call-may he just add-that lasted hours. As much as he wanted to he mad, he knew Steve deserved the best. He saw how happy Steve got when he received a message from Thor.
“We got it Cap.” Said Tony.
Throughout his whole speech Tony had visibly paled. On the inside he was screaming, the idea that they were going to use the arc reactor and touch it… made him want to cry and curl into a little ball. He remembered when Obie paralyzed him and took it out, leaving him to die. The only person he trusted to even get near it was Steve.
They quickened their pace, passing the most curious shops Tony had ever seen. One shop sold wishes, while another advertised doors that could take you to any place you wanted to go.
“Lock them in a room together?” Hill supplied.
Science didn’t boast of having all the answers, like Tony so often did. “I don’t know what I’m saying,” he muttered.
The girl was, moving too quickly to notice their confusion or wait for a response: “You’d better hurry—they close the gates at midnight! Could you imagine coming all this way and being left outside?”
She paced back and worth worriedly, not hearing Steve’s confusion. It was as if she had completely forgot that only moments before a spear had been pointed in her direction. “I finally got an invitation—I’ve been wanting one forever—I’m not sure why it happened this year, but I’m so excited that I did! The Magician has his reasons, they say.”
Tony stepped closer, seeing what had startled Steve. Where his name had been only moments ago was now a note scrawled in elegant script handwriting.
In the following week, he tried to hold on to that feeling, to trap the warmth inside him and the stretch of a smile on his face. In the workshop, it was easy. Anywhere else—when Tony wasn’t cranking away at some piece of machinery—it was almost impossible.
Tony broke away from Steve and tried to discern the path to the car, refusing to answer the question. He was so tired of being this man’s villain.
His arm was going to be yanked out of his socket as he was dragged through the water and thrown to the ground, bouncing against the rocky sand. Tony lashed out—and heard a satisfying grunt when his hand made hard contact with something.
hadread the email, you’d have seen that, as a consultant, my presence was not wanted,” he said, ignoring the sting of the words. After all this time he should be used to being unwanted, but he hadn’t mastered that level of numbness yet.
It didn’t surprise anyone that Tony did as Natasha said and went to the Avengers meeting. He and death were always flirting together.
“He’s too reckless, you’re right.” Hill confirmed; her mouth drawn into a thin line. “But we’ll be lucky if we can get one to follow the other.”
“Could be a lot worse.”
A strange heat pooled inside of him as a breath escaped his lips. “Damn.”
“You want the good or bad news?” Steve hollered through the trees up ahead.
Tony rubbed around his arc reactor, feeling as though a part of him were missing. “He was connected to my sunglasses.”
“Barton, how many times do I need to tell you that you have absolutely no idea how to whisper before it finally gets through your skull?” They both startled at Nat’s intruding voice.
“You can’t seriously be saying we were abducted by aliens.”
“I’m just trying to keep you warm,” Steve’s voice was matter of fact, but his eyes were narrowed.
Tony tried to be rational. He’d been lost before and he’d found his way back against all odds. He could do it again.
What the hell had happened? Had he—had they?
“Tony, what are we doing here?” Steve’s jaw ticked, betraying just how angry he was.
“Did you just agree with me? I think you just agreed with me.” Tony scoffed. “Was it painful? Should we have Jarvis play it back?”
Hi everyone! School has only just started and I'm already dead tired. Hope everyone is doing well, and sorry that I missed a week of posting. This chapter has really heavy influence from Caravel, so, like always, anything that you recognize or think is exceptionally good isn't mine.
“Of course I do. But mine isn’t a huge, towering home of a spoiled millionaire—”
People like Steve took one look at Tony’s record and made all his decisions for him. It would never matter that he had put an end to it all: that he had stopped building weapons, escaped a terrorist organization and turned his sights on arc reactor technology. It didn’t matter that he had stopped sleeping around and gone the longest in his life without getting drunk.
Tony’s grin slackened the moment he saw Steve’s back. He ripped off his soggy t-shirt and hurriedly pulled the maroon one over his head. The soft material clung to his body like an embrace. Despite his talk, Tony was relieved Steve wasn’t seeing his naked chest.
Either way, both of them should have been in bed, but both of them were gulping down steaming cups of coffee.
He tried a few doorknobs but nothing budged.
Tony stepped aside, nodding to the mirror in the back. For a moment, all he and Tony could do was stare. It really wasn’t fair that someone could look so perfect.
“You’re right, I’ve gone too far.” Tony agreed solemnly. Warm laughter crackled through the phone, and Tony drank it in.
Tony rubbed his arm. This wasn’t a road he wanted to go down.
“Not mine. Not now.”
Tony held his left hand steady against the wheel though it threatened to shake. At least when he was an ass, it was sarcastic and impersonal. Steve’s cruelty was vicious, his words so cool and carefully measured that they seemed to be facts rather than opinions.
The corner of Tony’s mouth quirked up as he nodded his agreement: this was getting to be absurd. “Any idea what Thrimilici could be?”
Steve was sitting on the corner of the couch, his legs pulled tightly to his chest. He was frustratingly beautiful, even with his pajamas and ruffled hair. His looks made it simultaneously easy and impossible to hate him.
“It’s beautiful,” Steve breathed out, and Tony nodded his agreement.
Before Steve or Tony could get in another word the girl was off, darting towards an obscured path to the left of the cliff. “Maybe I’ll see you there!” Her voice rang from down below.
Steve’s head bobbled as he mulled over Tony’s words, his mouth drawn into a grim line. “I have a terrible feeling about this.”
The next morning, only a few hours into Tony’s feverish dreams, Fury held a meeting at SHEILD. This time, the Avengers were not notified. Instead, only Fury and his closest agents filled the room with their whispers.
Steve urged him down the curious street.
She answered with a grin, but it wasn’t kind or warm or soft the way grins were supposed to be. It was calculated, the slow teasing way someone curved her lips just before she turned over a winning hand of cards. “How long are you going to stay hidden away in this workshop?”
Steve reached out and wrapped an arm around him.
Hi everyone! Thanks for reading! I have a question: School is about to start up again pretty soon, so I will be a heck of a lot busier. I'm wondering if you guys would prefer me to post once a week consistently or post quickly until I run out and then maybe have to wait if my schedule gets too crazy. So essentially, I have enough written so far that I could post once a week and make it through a 16 week semester, or do you not want to wait that long and have me post the 16 quickly up front but maybe wait a while before I can get to it again?
Like I said, it is very complicated and very individualized, but writing about Tony's struggle to move on and evolve made me think of how relevant this all is.
you.”
“Do you think someone is watching us?” Tiny fairy people may have been far-fetched, but clearly someone was paying attention.
Tony rummaged around in his cabinets for the biggest mug he could find, huffing out his impatience since it wasn’t where it was supposed to be. Was it too hard for Clint to put things back exactly where they came from? Shouldn’t that be a fundamental life-or-death skill for assassins?
“Of course. Every night will be like a party—what’s not to love?” Tony clapped his hands together. He tried not to sound too miserable, but the hollow sound of his voice tore through the room. “Give me three weeks. Three weeks and I’ll have everything ready.”
As always, this is essentially Caravel with Tony and Steve, so none of this is mine!
The road before them multiplied in different directions into a maze of twisting streets. All were lined with mismatched, rounded shops and carts—each painted shades of vibrant jewels or calm pastels. The stores were piled upon each other, sloppily arranged in gravity-defying stacks like an out of control pile of To-Be-Read books.
“Tony.” Steve nodded at him in greeting.
They were shouting at him, screaming in his ear, but it wasn’t English. He tried to tell him that he didn’t understand, but it came out a blubbering mess of shivers and sputtering. It was already dark in the cave, but the water made it even harder to see.
“Ken.” Tony nodded too, holding back a small giggle.
have listened if they weren’t talking about invading his home.
“I’ll have to look that one up I guess.”
Tony made his way back to the fire and his suit, already sliding the belt from his pants. Again, his attempt for warmth was foiled by Steve, who called his name from the front of store.
What did he want to hear? Did Steve need further confirmation from him that he was self-destructive—whether purposefully or not?
The problem came when Steve finished the drink and must have felt the obligation to talk. Which was exactly why everyone needed to have oversized coffee mugs, Tony rationalized.
Tony chuckled and rested his head back on Steve’s shoulder.
Tony frowned at that, he definitely wasn’t jealous. He let go and tried to have fun.
“Natasha you wound me.” Clint said, faking sadness and placing a hand to his chest.
“Tony… it’s no big deal. I already talked to Fury, he says aside from us being covered in mud it’s not that bad. It’s good for the public to see the more human side of the Avengers.” Steve said, feeling silly trying to defend himself covered in mud.
Bruce was the first to arrive, polite as ever,  “Morning Steve, thanks for breakfast” he smiled.
Steve sat there beaming, he was so happy to see Tony make up with his friends.
He was brought out of his thoughts when Donald entered the room. He clapped his hands together with a huge smile, “So Tony, I bet you’re wondering why you’re here. Well the first reason is that one, I hate you.” He all but spat.
“Tony,” she sighed, “I’m not here to argue pointlessly with you, I just wanted to let you know that I emailed Steve to let him know that there is the Gala coming up next week that all Avengers are required to attend.”
“Thanks, Thor.” Steve said sincerely, “It’s not always easy.” He added sighing.
Halfway through the movie Tony nudged him with his foot,
They practically busted down the door to Nick Fury’s office.
At that moment Steve walked in, holding another sandwich, giving him a sheepish smile.
“It’s okay.” Tony said and went up to hug him as well.
He raised his eyebrow in question, all of them held steely, determined gazes.
“I promise I wouldn’t have said yes if I wasn’t ready. Are you sure you’re ready? Or have you gotten sick of me already?” Steve teased.
Tony tried to fuck himself on Steve’s tongue and face but Steve held his thighs down firmly. Tony whined at that but didn’t do anything other than moan and writhe.
“It’s the Avengers Tower by the way.”
“Do what? Go to the Gala? You said it yourself it’s for charity.” Steve said, slightly confused.
Well everyone but Clint who waited until everyone was seated and then jumped on top of all of them so that he managed to lay across them.
“Sorry it’s just, I’m so happy to be here. Home with you and my family.”
“Uh oh this isn’t gonna be good.” Clint murmured.
“Thanks Nat, you don’t know how much you helped me just now.” He said, his voice growing thick.
This is how Thor and Captain America ended up on the news for causing an “intentional natural disaster,”. The disaster part came from the downpour after the lighting and the flood of mud throughout the whole park.
Steve was so surprised by this, he didn’t know what to say “Well gee Tony, that’s just swell. Thank you. Maybe Tony Stark does have a heart.” Steve teased.
“Tony I’m gonna cum.” He warned, just as he tried to pull out, Tony wrapped his legs around Steve’s waist.
“Yes, Tony?”
Once he finished telling the team, they were all supportive.
“Tony,” Bruce said, smiling, “If you want, I can fill in some of the blanks.”
“You’ll know why we need this for later.” Donald smiled as he walked out of the room taking Tony’s blood with him.
“Hey Jarvis, everyone is still up there right?”
Steve walked towards Tony until he was right in front of him. Tony glanced up at him, a cross between confused and uncomfortable.
At that moment, Tony and Bruce walked in the kitchen, Tony seemed to eyeing the two of them standing together, frowning.
Donald walked in then. He smiled and looked to the weapon beside him. Yellow bars lit up on the side.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Tony come on! Just admit that you’re wrong and we can move on.” Rhodey said.
Tony held up a finger, he was finishing up a phone call “Yes yes, that is perfect thank you so much.”
Tony just stared up at him, overwhelming happiness filling him up, “Well I’m glad I could help you Steve, you are aren’t so bad yourself.” He said teasingly.
Steve held fast and began to stroke Tony’s arm.
If everything went according to Hammers plan, he was screwed. But if he managed to escape or… if the Avengers would find him, well there would be some changes.
“Just disable it please.” Steve snapped. “Widow, have you cleared the civilians?”
“That’s great! Maybe you could come with me to a pride parade if you’re ready, because I’m bisexual too.” Tony said while looking down. “And it really does do wonders to help the cause when famous people show up. Can’t imagine what would happen if you did.”
“God someone get me out!” He shouted, “Help me, make it stop!”
His breathing quickened as he realized he was stuck here. God, he just wanted Steve. It was so childish and weak but all he wanted was Steve to rescue him and hug him.
“Bruce… I think I can see and hear better that before.” Tony said, like he expected Bruce to tell him he was crazy.
“I’m fine Tony.” Steve said, “I would be even better if I had my best fella over here.”
Later that night, Tony wandered out into the common area. He was so glad the team loved the gifts, he wanted to show them that he cared.
“Iron—” was all he managed to get out before his breath was stolen from him.
“What’s up, Cap?” Tony said “I’m kinda busy.”
“He wants to work on his project, he thinks he may be close to a breakthrough.” Steve explained.
“Of course Tony, we are a team remember.” Steve patted Tony’s knee.
“Oh okay thanks for letting me know.” Steve said.
“More Steve, please.” Tony moaned out. And pulled Steve closer.
Once he felt the car stop he listened for footsteps.
“It is none of your business!” Tony said angrily.
“Oh Tony I would love too but I’m actually leaving this evening. I have a flight in an hour but I wanted to see you before I left.”
“Well yes mostly him but you take care of all of us.” He paused, “He seems really happy, I’ve never seen him smile so much.”
“Wow someone is being extra affectionate tonight.” Tony said, but everyone could see the huge smile on his face.
“Speaking of, did Clint tell you I made the first move?” Tony asked Natasha.
As the guards began to undo Tony’s restraints, Justin spoke up, “Now Tony, don’t get any funny ideas. Try to escape and there will be severe consequences.” He smiled, “And oh, your new mark is looking nice.” He smirked, looking at Tony’s scars.
“I’m happy for you two.” Pepper said, with a hint of approval.
The battle had gone downhill fast. Hulk was able to take on some of the aliens, but it took so much time to take them down. Tony was surrounding the perimeter and shooting the aliens with his repulsors but they weren’t doing as much damage as he liked.
Steve and Tony go furniture shopping...but not everything goes as planned. Hope you like! We will have a much longer chapter coming up.
Steve chucked in response and pulled Tony against him, so that Tony’s head was pillowed on Steve’s chest. The skin on skin contact felt amazing. Steve couldn’t remember a time he felt so warm.
“We should make Fury change his status!” Clint pipped up, “He is still marked as consultant. We should make him change it to member or co-leader, if that’s okay with you Steve.”
“You never really talk about it.” Steve said slowly, “I mean I wouldn’t but if you ever need someone to listen…” he trailed off.
Steve wanted to ask him more about that, but he could tell it was something personal that he wouldn’t want to share in front of everybody.
“I have a thing about names, the way that guy spoke to Stark...it rubbed me the wrong way, not just because he was rude.” He said.
“Haha very funny Jarvis, but trying to distract me won’t work.” He said.
“Ah if it isn’t the famous Tony Stark, it has been so long since I’ve seen you fellow comrade” Thor said, pulling Tony into a bear hug, “Tell me Man of Iron, do you still have my chamber from last time?”
“The painting also has one of her knives in the back. Not many people knew she used them.” Tony said.
Both took a moment to bask in their naked glory.
“Woah, Thor that’s amazing.” Tony said.
Uh-oh Tony thought, here comes the part where Steve asks him to resign-he shared too much-and now he’s going to lose everything.
Before uncapping the lube, Steve wanted to make this extra special for Tony, so he brought his face to Tony’s crotch. He spread Tony’s thighs and began licking lightly around his hole.
The guard walked around so he was standing behind Tony, then reached over and placed the bar over his lower right rib.
“Director. We have reason to believe Justin could be holding Tony at a warehouse just outside of New York. The place was under the name of a distant relative of Donald Henderson, the creator of the robots who took Tony.” Natasha quickly supplied.
Tony came back with several bowls of popcorn and sat even closer to Steve than before, their legs were practically touching. They both exchanged small smiles and then continued watching Mulan.
At that moment he heard Tony walk into the common room and all the nervousness came rushing back. What if his paintings weren’t good enough? Tony bought rare, priceless pieces of art all the time. The man was the world's most successful businessman, he had probably seen it all.
“Well look what we got here.” Donald said, “The bars are still yellow. I’d say it’s about twenty five percent charged.” He said clicking his tongue, “You still have a ways to go.”
“What are you talking about Rhodey? I build them tech and I care so much about my team.” He said defensively.
Tony simply moaned in pain. He cried until no more tears would come.
Tony looked around at his teams rapidly fading smiles. Shit they all thought he was mad about this.
“Whatever.” Tony said hopping off the counter, “I guess I’ll just go down to the workshop and starve then.” He said smiling.
“When we talked last night all he said was that he had ‘business to attend to’.” Steve said.
“No thanks needed, and it was a group effort really.”
He was greeted with the sight of a sorrowful Natasha and Clint.
Tony but down on a scream bit thrashed his head from one side to another. He couldn’t stop the tears that came to his face from the horrible pain. Dark crimson blood soaked his midsection.  He kept panting even after Justin was finished.
“Oh well, who needs sleep anyways? Right Dum-E” the bot just whirred in response and proceeded to hand him the fire extinguisher.
“So Thor,” Steve said, “It’s good you got here. We were just talking about a party that the whole team has to go to in a few days.”
He was met with more silence.
“Oh shut it capsicle.” Tony said, “Why? Disappointed that being with a billionaire didn’t mean getting super fancy furniture?” He teased with a smile, however there was a bit of insecurity beneath it.
Steve blushed.
“No promises.”
So this chapter will be featuring Tony giving the team some gifts from Japan, these all contain actual parts of Japanese culture but a lot of them have details that I threw in for the sake of the story. I realize that most of these things would be impossible to get in real life but hey if anyone could do it, it’s Tony Stark.
“Seriously you could just tell him to fuck off.” Tony said then sighed, “But fine, it’s only a few days. When do you have to leave?”
“Oh my god….mmm fuck Tony, you feel amazing. You’re so amazing, love you.” He half moaned and shouted. Tony looked up at Steve through lust filled eyes, he would never forget the noises that Steve was making. They both were getting closer.
“Any word from Thor?”
Tony gave him a look that said he thought Steve was insane, “Why are you encouraging him? He needs to learn that he’s doing it wrong.” Tony said crossing his arms.
Apparently they had successfully managed to create a killer robot that was set to explode. That’s when Fury decided to call in the Avengers.
“Yeah, yeah.” Tony replied.
“Glad we could come to an agreement.” Steve teased.
“Well yes. Due to my super soldier hearing. I heard what she said.” Steve grimaced, “She was harsh. She said some things. She called Tony selfish and said that he pretty much does whatever he wants.”
“Wow Steve, it’s been almost a century and you still can’t properly climb down a tree.” Tony said teasingly and laughing, still having a severe case of giggles.
“Really Tony, you don’t have time for that but you have time to take Steve out around the city?” Pepper snapped
“But we already know Steve’s serum and blood has to be somewhat compatible with humans, because Steve was a normal sickly human before he got it.”
The next morning Steve made breakfast for the the remaining Avengers. Steve, Bruce and Natasha all sat around the kitchen island conversing.
Steve got up and hugged him, “This is absolutely incredible. You did not have to do this.” He said with a smile.
“But what if he needs more?” Steve said, looking worriedly down at Tony, “What if there’s not enough serum to repair the damage?”
He was almost finished with Nat’s widow bites when Dum-E came up to him with what was supposed to be a cup of coffee, “Dum-E! What did I tell you? I can’t drink motor oil okay? It will kill me! Why can’t you be useful?”
“We shall have a celebratory movie night when you feel ready.” Thor said.
“Ah yes it is so great to see you, strongest Avenger!” Thor beamed.
“Oh shit Steve!” Tony said putting a hand to his chest, “Warn a guy will ya? Or better yet, just wear a bell.”
Rhodey picked up on the third ring,
“Night, Tone”
Tony cried out as Steve nailed his prostate, “Yes, Steeeeeve… oh god-right there!”
“Thanks Thor.” Steve said gratefully
He laid strapped on to the table that night, exhausted and not knowing what to think; wondering if his family truly despise him after all.
The contact seemed to help, because a second later Tony opened his eyes.
So this is where the smut actually happens. It doesn’t happen until later in the chapter but I did want to warm you.  This is my first time writing smut so I hope you like it! The —- are longer separating those scenes so you can skip it if that’s not your thing. I really hope you guys like it!
“You sure this is enough?” Steve asked, walking over to Tony and stroking his face.
Steve just rolled his eyes and said “Okay, Tony.” And turned to look at Thor, who sat on Steve’s other side.
Tony and Steve held hands then, stepped into the elevator.
“Well because your the head of SI. Plus you're an Avenger, you’re supposed to check in with partners on important business.” Steve said like it was obvious.
“I’m so glad we are doing this, I know it will mean a lot to Tony.” Bruce said smiling gently, “I know the big guy will be happy to support.”
Tony whimpered and turned his head away as Donald roughly shoved the adrenaline pills in his mouth.
“Steve, baby I love you but, you have to move please.”
Thanks to the super serum, Steve naturally didn’t need as much sleep as the average person. Unfortunately that meant that some nights he simply wasn’t tired and that allowed his mind to wander.
“Tony if you could just wait a second. I would like to speak to you.” Pepper said seriously.
Steve was taken aback by the offer, Tony rarely let people in his workshop, let alone showed how he worked, “Are you serious?” Steve asked, “Tony that would be awesome.” Steve smiled excitedly.
Tony beamed at the mention of the word boyfriend and took Steve’s face in his hands. “Yes, yes and yes.” Tony said swallowing a lump in his throat, this time from happiness. “God, Steve I want everything with you, please come to me too, we both need to be equals in this.”
“For my team? Never.” Tony said smiling.
“So it’s official.”
“Bruce it’s no trouble, I wish I could do more.” Steve said.
“It appears the Captain has sustained three broken ribs and has passed out due to lack of oxygen.”
“Tony, love.” He said gently, “Tony can you hear me? It’s Steve. Come on baby, you can open your eyes.”
Tony squirmed in his seat. He felt awful, each new lash made fresh red angry marks on his skin.
Tony felt as if his heart was ripped out of his chest. He turned away as much as he could and sobbed, he cried for the life that was taken away from him and the life he would never get to have now.
“It’s all good Tony because he said I could watch it without him, and I made my gourmet hot chocolate. Care to join?” He asked, he knew Tony could use the company especially after the nightmare.
As he slowly came to consciousness, his memories returned. Donald, the arc being used; Hammer and the torture and beatings.
“Come on Tony!” Pepper yelled, “What do you expect? You act crazy all the time, doing whatever you want whenever you want.” Pepper said frustrated, “You act like a child and you think you’re entitled to roll your eyes at the few meetings I make you attend so you can be informed about what is going on in your company. You don’t appreciate anything.”
“What Tony?” Justin growled, “Have something you want to say? I’d be careful if I were you.”
Tony giggled and then as he met Steve’s gaze he looked back down.
“Ah can it Jarvis, sleep is for the weak and the world waits for no one!”
“Wow Steve that’s incredible. It sounds like you had some amazing people in your life.” Tony said looking down, “I’m sorry you had to leave it behind.” He added.
“What why?” Tony asked complaining, “We just had that big mission a week ago.”
“Thanks so much for doing this.” Bruce said, “It could really help a lot.”
“I remember him saying over the comms that it looked familiar to him.” Natasha said.
“Wait someone used his arc reactor as a battery?” Clint shouted.
“No Tony there is no mission.” Steve said, standing up from the couch where they all sat. “We want you to look at these please.” He said, handing him several documents.
“Wait. How did this go from not even having a second date to a relationship?” Steve asked in fake innocence.
Steve felt like he was losing his mind.
“Hello my friends! How have my comrades fared since my departure?”
“It’s not even just that.” Said Natasha, “I know how good of a person he is. He just cares so much, but people don’t bother to look behind the mask.”
“Okay Steve.” Tony said looking a bit affronted and crossing his arms against his chest.
“Well it’s good to see you two finally got your heads out of your asses.” Natasha said smirking.
Tony sighed running a frustrated hand over his face, “Jarvis I already told you I can’t take a break, I need to get the equipment for the Avengers updated. I can’t risk them getting hurt in the field just because I need a little nap.”
“You better.”
“Yeah yeah we get it, you’re super skilled.” Said Bruce dryly, “Steve, do you know if something happened?”
“Shouldn’t we at least try to save him?” Bruce asked, sounding annoyed.
They held close, basking in the happiness of the other. Tony smiled up at Steve and lifted up to give him a kiss. They laughed when Steve removed a piece of pie crust from Tony’s hair, and then leaned in touching by their foreheads.
“Phil, who?”
“Where is he?” Clint asked, teary eyed.
“You didn’t tell Tony right?” Steve asked.
“That’s not going to happen.”
“It’s okay man,” he said with shiny eyes, “I understand. We all miss him and love him. But at least now we get him back.” He said with a pat on his shoulder.
Steve just laughed in response, “It’s nothing, Shellhead.” Pecking Tony’s cheeks, “I know how hard you work and how stressful things get for you.”
I had a lot of fun writing this! Hope you all enjoy.
“Tony what’s wrong? Did Pepper say something?” Steve asked as he sat them both on the couch. Interestingly enough he asked if Pepper said something, not if Tony had done something wrong.
So he just got up and said “Alright then. Try to get some sleep sometime soon Tony.”
Once they got into the common room they all decided to sit down for the movie. Thor took up a large portion of the couch and Clint took a beanbag on the floor, Natasha sat next to Clint who saw that as an opportunity to lay his head in her lap. Natasha just fondly rolled her eyes.
Steve met Tony down in the lobby in a nice suit. He caught Tony staring for a moment before ushering him in the car.
“Tony that wasn’t your fault. You had no idea what was happening, and as soon as you did you stopped it.” Steve said forcefully.
“You want to know what I don’t appreciate?” Tony asked, his eyes burning with unshed tears, “Is my two ‘best friends’ accusing me of being selfish and unworthy of being a hero, when I have done a lot of good.” Tony said shaking his head, “God what happened to us? You’re supposed to be my friend, you’re supposed to support me. Instead all you care about is Rhodey, you’re the selfish one.” Tony snapped and then walked away before Pepper could say anything else.
Things at the tower had been going…well they had been going. The team had been getting along more and even had become closer in the time that had passed. Even still Tony decided to keep his distance, he didn’t want to become too attached. What with them being full time superheroes they were always in danger, besides anyone that Tony got close to always got hurt or ended up pushing him away. He thought idly back to his dating life with Pepper and his strained friendship with Rhodey. It wasn’t that they didn’t care about him, it was just that well... Tony was a handful at best and they...they came around when they could.
“Coming.”
“And Clint?”
“Hello Steve.” Pepper said.
“Wait isn’t that the same douchebag from the Gala?” Clint asked, alarmed.
Before tonight, they both never understood the term “lovemaking”. They both thought the concept to be a bit absurd, but that night it was as if they were a single soul. They understood it then, and hoped they always would.
Tony was writhing underneath him, his dick leaking precum against his stomach. “Steve, I’m ready, I promise.” He cried out, “I want this.”
“Wait, isn’t that when Rhodey is supposed to come by.” Steve said concerned.
“I’m not sure you’ll even like this, but here goes.” Then Steve pulled out two paintings and handed them to Tony.
“Not at all, Steve.” Tony said and then smirked, “I would just say I’m delightfully sore. All that supersoldier stamina’s good for something I guess.” He teased.
The Gala started off excellently, Steve even volunteered to say a few words for the cause and that completely won the crowd over. After that there was a lot of mingling and dancing.
“There he is.” Steve smiled.
“Hey I was trying to do something nice for him, he deserves it.” Tony said starting to get angry “Besides I deserve my own life.”
“Soooo…” Tony said looking nervous, “I just wanted to apologize for lashing out at you yesterday. I was stressed and things were just piling up.” Tony looked apologetic, “I took it out on you and Thor and I’m sorry. I already apologized to Thor but that guy couldn’t even remember me being mad.” He laughed nervously.
“Get lost, Birdbrain.”
“Contact Medical now!”
“Yes.” Tony said, tears steadily flowing, “Yes I understand and I love you too. I talked to you when the pain was too much. I pictured you and the team and coming home.” He said, before launching himself at Steve, pulling him in a hug.
“Tony that is no way to speak to the future owner.” Justin said coldly. He took something from his pocket, looking at Donald, “May I?” He asked.
Steve just laughed and shook his head, “Come on Tony are you serious? My clothes are just fine.”
“But come on! This is no way to treat your boyfriend.” Tony pouted, blushing slightly at the use of the word boyfriend.
Tony couldn’t believe that his team did this for him, he could barely think.
“I just wanted to apologize for yesterday, I was stressed and took it out on you. You did an amazing job, it was no easy task and you did it.” He said putting an arm on his shoulder.
“Alright enough with this mushy shit.” Said Clint, “Lets watch a movie!”
“Yeah the mission was a bit more tiring than I thought.” Tony frowned, “But I won.”
Now that Tony was more awake and alert he was beginning to notice things he didn’t before, like the fact he could hear the cars on the street and read the sign outside the door with really small writing. Both of which he was positive he could never do before.
The thing was that no one had ever needed Steve. Before the serum he was just Steve, a sickly burden, the only time he became useful was when he was Captain America. That’s who the world worshipped and that’s who the Avengers relied on.
Once the weapon was finally finished, Tony felt like the life was sucked out of him. He couldn’t tell if he was imagining things or not but he felt as if the arc was short circuiting, it felt harder to breathe. Although that could be the emotional pain weighing him down as well.
Tony looked up from his work then, half surprised and half skeptical. Time to activate self defense mechanism: deflect.
“Let’s go.”
“Oh my god!” He yelled, “Oh my god! Make it stop! Make it stop please!” He screamed.
“Well I was wondering if maybe you’d want to… christen our bed? I mean there’s no pressure and I don’t want you thinking that I wanted you to move in with the expectation that we sleep together but I was thinking a little-well actually a lot that it would be really nice to be closer to you and you know what? Just forget it. Fuck Steve I’m sorry I don’t want you to think that this was what the whole writing a song and asking you to move in was about and—”
“My, oh my!” Hammer began, tapping his temple, “What to do with you. We have so much time!” He boasted, “The possibilities are endless.”
“No footage containing Donald Henderson at the tower, on or near the time of the explosion.” Jarvis reported.
“Steve! You’re back.” Tony exclaimed, walking towards him and kissing him on the mouth. “You look exhausted.” He said concerned.
Tony simply looked away and locked his jaw. Before he said something that would get him in trouble.
Tony immediately tensed at that and looked down, “Oh um, yeah Pepper wants us to attend because it’s to raise money for rebuild projects and a lot of good charities. She thinks if the Avengers show face they might donate much more.” And yes, Tony did read the information Pepper sent after their little spat.
“Okay.” Steve said, crossing his arms, “Explain.”
Tony locked eyes with him then and saw nothing but honesty.
He stretched his arms and as a result Tony began to stir. Tony reached a hand to Steve’s chest and mumbled out, “Mornin’...” while smiling softly.
“It’s nothing.” Tony said looking away. “If you want I can put my shirt back on to cover it up.”
“Aww look at you.” Justin drawled, “So ugly, how could your precious boyfriend even love you now?” Tony’s eyes flashed at that, the words hurt badly. “And look haha! It says DJ! Like a DJ.” He laughed, way too amused with himself. Then he walked away quickly and came back with a bottle of liquid. He poured it on the cuts and it immediately began to burn.
“Okay, don’t be gone too long.” Steve said. “Oh and take your phone so I can talk to you.”
“Tony, it took me a long time to get to the position I earned in the military.” He said crossing his arms, “You have to be responsible, and if you actually care about your team then you’ll take the job seriously.” Rhodey said with a frown.
“Thank you.”
“Oh… yeah I draw sometimes, it helps me clear my head.” Steve said shyly.
They were in Steve’s room, trying to figure out what to take to Tony’s penthouse. Steve didn’t have many possessions, a few photos, a lot of paintings and a few miscellaneous items. There wasn’t an issue until they had reached his closet, which Tony decided needed to be redone with a whole new design.
“Don’t worry about it Steve, first one is free.” She smiled smoothly, “Besides it’s nice to play someone who poses an actual challenge to me.” She smirked.
That evening when Tony returned from SI, he immediately went to the team. He was a bit worried when Jarvis had told him that they wanted to speak to him right away.
Of course they tasked Steve with getting Tony out of his workshop, saying that “If anyone could do it, it’s you” with smirks on their faces.
“But wait! Bruce!”
“I love you.” They both said at the same time.
“I think I’m going to skip movie night, if that’s okay. I really want to work on this, and I may call you down for more blood if I need it.” He said apologetically, “It’s just this is very time sensitive and I really need to get it right.” He tried to justify.
“Well I wouldn’t be if I were him, but you know Stark. He’s allergic to any type of responsibility.” Clint retorted.
Steve smiled, “I am a huge softie for you Tony.” he said grabbing his hand.
“Tony Stark, co-leader of Avengers, effective immediately.”
When there was no reply, Tony quickly stood up. He was about to find the Avengers and get his suit when the wall to the workshop was blown to pieces.
Tony was working away in the lab as per usual. He finally was able to finish the stabilizer and then he emailed Pepper.
Then Steve pulled away, uncapping the lube and began to spread it on his fingers, he moved his hands to Tony’s hole, massaging the area around it.
“You really do know how to make a guy feel better.” Tony smiled, “God I don’t deserve you.” Tony said snuggling into Steve, pressing his face into the crook of his neck.
“I’ve been noticing Tony looks tired when he thinks we aren’t looking.” Natasha replied neutrally, with just a hint of concern under the surface.
Tony just laughed in response, “Sounds great.”
Tony smiled and handed Thor his gift, “Here you go Point Break. It’s an old Japanese hammer. It has a dragon carved into the head and I had the handle carved in with your title in it.” He said, “Hope you like it big guy.”
Tony however didn’t, “No it was just the one time. Someone noticed Howard’s son wasn’t at the event and from then on out I wasn’t allowed to not be there. I had to represent the Stark name.” Tony added bitterly.
“Our Captain never ceases to amaze me.” Thor said smiling, clasping a hand to his back.
“Thanks for dinner, it was amazing.” Tony said.
“Oh yeah?” Steve asked.
Tony did cry out then but quickly clamped his mouth shut. Justin took a wipe and cleaned off the blood.
Steve took a moment before replying, he could see that Tony was stressed but he knew he couldn’t just let this go. There was clearly a major misunderstanding that needed to be cleared up. However this was Tony, he needed to choose his words carefully otherwise the result would be the same as yesterday.
“No thanks needed.” Said Clint.
“Yeah he might be the ‘best at smashing things’ Avenger, but I’m the smartest, most skilled and sexiest Avenger.” Clint smirked.
Despite the rapid deteriorating thoughts, “Let him in Jarvis”
Tony took a moment before replying to think back on the last few weeks. Him and Steve had been getting along much better and had even come close to becoming friends. Tony had been trying to keep his distance, he couldn’t stomach the idea of anyone on his team, especially Steve dying in battle. Besides he was a selfish billionaire who had caused too much death due to his carelessness, not to mention the lack of being able to sleep due to the nightmares that consumed him. No, Steve wouldn’t want anything to do with him once he got to know him. Just like everyone else.
“I’m sorry Tony.” Steve grimaced, “We know it was wrong to change you like this, to do this to your body without your consent. But we were desperate, we had to save you.”
Steve placed an arm on Bruce’s shoulder, “Bruce I would do anything to help you. I want to help, I promise it’s no trouble at all.” Steve smiled, “And it’s kinda cool being part of lab action, lord knows I barely come in here because I can’t keep up.” He said ruefully.
“You know what Rogers that’s it!” Tony exclaimed as he grabbed the ketchup and squirted the bottle at Steve who tried to duck away.
“No no no!” He cried, “It hurts! It hurts so much!” He bawled as tears streamed down his face.
All of them have him devilish smiles and Steve knew he had lost.
Steve never failed to notice how happy Tony’s eyes got whenever Thor called him brother.
They both entered into the operating room and stared sadly at Tony. He was bruising horribly and the lashes on his body were an angry red. He looked so small with all those machines connected to him.
Tony ignored him, “While I was gone I took the liberty of getting you all presents. Little souvenirs, but next time we all can go.” Tony said kind of shyly.
“Nice to see you Pepper.”
“Very true.” Steve smiled, “We can just agree to be more careful next time.”
“Well, it’s just Tony brought up that it was reckless and we may have made the Avengers look bad.”
Thor shot off as fast as he could, immediately taking him back to the tower to where Bruce was.
“He isn’t worth it.” Natasha said. “He’s so messed up that even he can’t be fixed.”
“You are still an important part of Stark Industries Tony. Besides you have responsibilities, you need to be a part of the meetings, it’s essential to knowing where everyone stands. You have to grow up.” Pepper replies sounding like this was the millionth time she had to explain this. Before Pepper looked back up a flash of hurt crossed Tony’s face before the irritation took its place.
“Oh god.” Steve said, gripping his face with his hands, “What do we do?”
“You’re doing plenty. Not just for me but for all of us.” He said kindly.
He moved on to other Avengers tech when Jarvis piped up.
Unbeknownst to Tony, Steve had heard the whole conversation between Pepper and Tony.
Steve swallowed around a mysterious lump in his throat, “Me too, love.”
That had been hours ago. Now everyone was asleep or waiting, or both. Natasha was asleep sitting up, Clint sleeping against her side and Thor managed to pass out on top of both of them.
“We heard about the explosion at the tower. We assumed you all made it out fine.” Fury said, a hint of concern in his words.
Tony was shocked to say the least, “Wait, seriously Steve? You aren’t straight?”
“Well hello to you too.” Said Clint sarcastic as ever and way too chirpy for the morning.
“So Steve what did you want to show me?” Tony asked looking worried, “Is something wrong? Whatever it is we can fix it.” Tony tried to comfort.
“Tony you are the best, id be lucky to call you mine.” Steve replied.
Then Justin put-actually punched-the arc reactor back in place. He could feel the internal bruising.
Steve gently grabbed Tony into his arms, hugging him carefully, bridal style.
Steve was captivated, there was so much incredible art, Steve however asked Tony if he knew what the meaning of a painting was. It had an equal symbol in rainbow colors with incredibly detailed male hands holding onto each other.
“Oh and Jarvis? I’m going to need you too.”
Tony looked up to Steve and smiled broader, “So… are you still sure about this?”
He vowed to never waste it.
And they all stormed out of SHIELD headquarters, ready to find Tony and end anyone who got in their way.
“Remember how I told you I could play instruments? Well my mom taught me piano and I wrote this for you.” Tony said looking nervous.
“Yes I do.”
“Why?” Steve asked, “People must tell you how good looking you are like a million times a day.” Steve said, his hold on Tony’s waist tightening a bit.
A second later he brought the knife to Tony’s stomach, hard, just above the metal strap. He carved in a D and a J, Donald and Justin’s initials.
Tony smiled, real, genuine and toothy, “Well I guess I don’t have anything better do do…” smirking, “If you insist.”
Tony began to shake his head, “No no no. No more please.” He mumbled, “Too much, can’t… can’t power anymore.”
“So Tony, I realize it is just me and my two guys and that might give you some funny ideas about running away.” He said grabbing Tony’s chin in his hands. “However if you so much as try to escape I have a bomb rigged in your tower and I will activate it if I can’t find you.” Tony’s eyes widened and he started panting behind the gag. “That way if you ever try to leave me you will be responsible for all those deaths, maybe even some avengers. I mean you may be gone but they’ll stay, that bitch Pepper will insist that they stay, and they will because all they’ve ever wanted is your money. And all you’d be doing by leaving is being selfish, because no one would want you back anyways.” He spat.
Thor’s expression hardened but he did not let go, “Do not challenge me, Barton, I could fry you.” Thor said in a fake serious tone.
“Of course sweetheart.” Natasha said, “We love you and we wanted you back the second you were gone.” She came up to him and kissed his forehead, then hugged him
They were laughing hysterically and Tony decided to grab an apple from the tree and throw it at Steve, they both picked leaves from the tree and threw them at each other until eventually Steve gave up, “Okay Tony! You win, I yield!” He shouted and then dramatically flung himself off the branch.
If Tony ever asked he knew they wouldn’t hesitate to pat him on the back or ruffle his hair, give him a breathlessly tight hug. And even though he never asked, they all seemed to know anyway. It showed when they all squeezed tightly together on the couch, or when a hand brushed his in passing, when one of them bodily dragged him out of his workshop at 3 AM.
Finally, Howard changed tactics, “I’m glad you agreed to come to dinner, Steve. I’d been worried about the both of you, staying up here alone without friends or family.” he said without even glancing towards his son, a wry, concerned smile maring his face. “I’m sure you and Tony would make fast friends, and I hope you can provide Tony a steadying influence, remind him that it’s important to visit his old man now and again.”
Clint didn’t mind. Honestly, he probably smelled worse than Tony did right now.
The guy raised a single eyebrow.
They had already dragged three carts of equipment out to the big green expanse of Kilian Court before they realized that the grounds weren’t as abandoned as they originally thought.
---  Natasha and Clint  ---
All four voices rang in heavenly harmony, “Science.”
Steve stood there, fists pushed deep into his coat pockets, haloed in moonlight and seeming larger against a backdrop of stars instead of chandeliers and silverware. Tony felt their differences starkly.
Pepper quirked one dubious, judgemental eyebrow. “Yes, but you set fire Killian Court.”
When his father called, Tony was not the same child who cowered in his room, hiding behind walls of books and robots. He was graduating with a masters from MIT, and had his own tower filled with princes and princesses, but all Howard had to say was, “I have dinner reservations for 7 PM tomorrow night. Black tie. Don’t be late.”
As all these things tend to happen, Tony was drunk.
It was well past midnight, when they finally made it back to Tony’s tower. Tony’s suit jacket was a wet and shredded bundle of scraps hanging off his arm and there were scorch marks on Steve’s pants. Their hair was a riot of plaster and soot and Tony had a smudge of ash on his cheek that Steve kept reaching out to touch. They were practically walking on top of each other, arms and hands linked, heads tilted together conspiratorially.
Pepper’s lips twitched, refusing to smile. “Why did science have to set the Killian Court on fire?” She glanced at Tony, “Again?”
“I’m sorry. I hadn’t meant to intrude,” Steve said, slowly and calmly as if trying to placate a startled animal.
Tony didn’t tell anyone about the call. He tried to convince himself he wasn’t going all the way up until he was choking on his too tight bowtie, being ushered to a table covered with white linen and bright, gleaming silverware.
Rhodey felt one part horrified, two parts perplexed, three parts excited, all parts amused, “What, no - the electric -”
The car’s front door was unlocked.
Tony ordered his second scotch.
“Huh,” Clint said and tilted his head to look down at Tony lying passed out on his lap. Tony looked pale and skinny, with dark bags under his eyes, gangly despite his immaculately tailored suit. His face was pushed up tight against Clint’s stomach, his hand curled loosely around Clint’s shirt sleeve, and he was huddled up as tight as he could get on the cold, skinny bench. Tony looked terribly young and terribly lonely, his drool seeping into Clint’s pants.
“Indeed!” Thor laughed, and with a heavy hand on their shoulders led them inexorably forward into the darkness.
Bruce teared up and Tony felt distinctly sniffly himself. Jane smiled serenely, used to the theatrics by now.
He had his workshop and his robots and everything he could ever want for. He had friends who loved him, scienced with him, and kept him from being expelled; Tony was not lonely.
“Wrangling this one is probably a full time job,” she said, pointing to Tony who preened as if given the highest of compliments. “But give me a call when you’ve got some free time and I’ll see about buying you a coffee.”
*****
Tony waved the question away, knocking back the first drink he’d had since he ended up in a jail cell with Clint. “You don’t already know?” Tony asked, sly, insinuating and just a little bit vicious. Tony rolled his eyes as the boyscout sunk back into stony silence.
“Yes,” Tony agreed wholeheartedly. “But, but why,” Tony whined, “Tires!”
Rhodey raised an unconvinced eyebrow. “Why don’t you come with me and let me get you something to drink. Then you can tell me all about how boring your evening was.”
It was 2 AM and pitch dark outside when Bruce finally relented to Tony’s whining and agreed that the prototypes were maybe, probably, okay for testing in an outdoor environment.
When Tony found out he had been accepted into MIT the first thing he did was run, whooping and laughing, to tell Jarvis the news. Jarvis had congratulated him, straightened Tony’s perpetually unruly hair and declared that the night’s dinner would be a feast, all of Tony’s favorites.
Tony raised his hand cautiously and Pepper glared at him as he continued, “What if we gave the prize money to the school?”
“I know!”
No, Tony hadn’t had a lick of alcohol in quite a long time. Tony was drunk on science. And as is the case with all good drinks, Tony wasn’t drinking alone.
Steve hesitated, looking towards Tony. “It’ll be fine. They do this all the time but they know not to bite,” Tony said with a stern look towards Rhodey and Natasha as they heading for the kitchen.
The light turned green, cars roared past them, and Tony stepped forward to take Steve’s hand.
Howard was busy wheedling Steve. He tried to convince him to take some interviews, visit the labs, come down for dinner. He even asked to draw some of Steve’s blood.
Tony listed indignantly, the guy’s hold the only thing keeping him on his feet. “I couldn’t break her if I tried,” he said, poking a finger at where he vaguely remembered the guy’s face being. “I can’t believe you took away her tires when the engine is literally a work of art,” Tony said, pretending to swoon and then falling face first into the guy’s chest.
“Yeah, I’m pretty fucked, aren’t I?” Tony said and he grinned, lopsided up at Pepper, “He’s moving in tomorrow.”
A throat cleared and Tony looked up to see one of the Dean’s secretaries standing in front of them. Her mouth was pinched resolutely downwards but her eyes couldn’t help glittering with amusement.
Tony was fine. He wasn’t lonely.
“Aw, shit,” thought Tony.
And Tony crumpled like wet newspaper.
The bass was like a hammer against his throbbing skull. Shrill laughter grated on his ears as his pushed his way through the hazy, spinning room, gasping for air and shying away from the sticky, sweaty bodies shoving against him.
"Long and frustrating," she says, stretching her arms above her head.
"Tony, honey, you don't have to—" Steve tries, a token protest. But Tony can tell by the way his cock jumps when Tony bumps it with his chin that Steve wants it, wants Tony to touch him.
+++++
Steve keeps his arms wrapped around Tony's back, holding him close and letting Tony set their pace for now. His hole is tight and wet, and he's undulating sweetly over Steve's lap. He's hard, and his cock slides against Steve's belly as he moves over him. Steve leans in and mouths at his neck, pressing kisses across Tony's shoulders and chest and throat.
"Long enough to save for you so you could have it on the drive up to the castle."
with how Steve must have completely torn you apart, since you haven't been able to leave your rooms since he knotted you."
"Tony," Steve says, hoping his voice comes out more of a deep rumble than a nervous squeak. "It's good to see you."
Steve has softened, his knot gone down so he's slipped out of Tony's body, and he feels empty. His hole is tender, raw, sore from being stretched too much too fast, but Tony doesn't regret it. He'd loved it, the feeling of Steve's huge cock filling him, stretching him and making a place for Steve inside Tony's body. It had felt like a true claiming, like Steve was really taking him, owning him.
"Well, then, that's going to work out fine for me," Steve rumbled, moving his hand down to cup Tony's balls, stroking and petting at them before moving down, pushing between Tony's legs and back, back to his hole, already slick again with want. "Because I want you, too. All the time, Tony."
"Why are you eating the pastries?"
"You can't be in heat again already," Steve says, running a hand down Tony's chest, his belly, to his cock. He's starting to harden, and he fills out fully with Steve's touch as Steve wraps a hand around him, grips his cock and starts stroking it, slow and gentle. "It's too soon."
Hidden behind a shy guy exterior
"Ms. Potts," Natasha says, turning away from Tony. "I was on my way down to the kitchens for a snack. Would you care to join me?"
for a kingdom, I didn't expect it."
Steve leans forward and rests his head in his hands, rubbing his eyes tiredly. "I don't know. That's the bargain he's insisted on, though. It's not all bad – a Consort will at least cement my ties to the Kingdom. So if we ever need King Howard's help again, maybe he'll be more likely to give it."
"So he gathered some engineers," she continues, grinning. "He told the staff to make sure you had everything you needed."
Steve stares at him, unsure what to say to that. Tony doesn't really give him a chance to think of much, before he's out the door and gone.
+++++
"Your highness, Steve asked me to come find you, actually," Wilson says, stepping through between the Betas. "If you'd like to join him in the garden?"
"No, Tony, you can't – I have to go alone. It's… I just got word. Some of my people managed to capture a troop of Chitauri, coming up on the south border."
"The first thing he did, when I arrived and he found out where I'd come from, was make sure I had suppressants, did you know that?"
"God, I'm so – is this
. God, it's disgusting. He's tall, and his shoulders are a mile wide, and his hands are big and soft-looking and gentle and strong. Christ. Tony had barely been able to stop staring at him the whole night.
"So he was taught to assume he was going to be bonded to some asshole Alpha somewhere."
Steve steps forward, smile softening. "Usually it's open for all the townspeople to enjoy. But I wanted us to be alone the first time you saw it."
Tony nods once, then rushes out of the garden and back into the snowy yard of the palace, face still aflame.
"You're not gonna run, Tony," Rhodey says as the coach pulls through the gates. It's the last chance, and he hadn't
But Howard had, as usual, exceeded all expectations, and now he's being sent to some isolated warlord in the middle of nowhere.
will also be the cause of the Alpha's violent, possessive and rough tendencies? God, the unfairness of it all.
"Fine for you two, maybe, you're not the ones expected to mate with some monster Alpha."
Steve swallows, smiling back. "It was good to see you, too."
Tony thinks about the last day they'd spent in that garden, the day his heat had come. It had been the first time he'd really felt like he'd
"There aren't a lot of Omegas in the kingdom, but they all get to have suppressants if they want them," she says, as though reading his mind. "Even the bonded ones."
"I think so," Steve says quietly. He's got to back off, he doesn't want to spook the poor man on his first night here.
"Well if that's not a little bit of fuckery, I don't know what is," Bucky had said, peering over Steve's shoulder at the note.
"Steve…" Tony sighs. "I'm not going anywhere. You'll have to leave the kingdom again
Steve opens the door to the garden, gesturing for Tony to go in first. It's still beautiful – bright and lush and full of beautiful flowers. They make their way down a row of roses, still not saying anything.
"Alstroemeria," Tony says, pointing to some pink and yellow blooms. "Wealth, prosperity, and fortune. It also means friendship."
Who's eye candy was a complete feast
"Maybe I should have gone looking for Bucky, at least I
you. You're not… you're not that callous. You're a
"That's it, sweetheart," Steve murmurs, looking over him. "You're beautiful."
"Does it hurt, sweetheart?"
"How?"
+++++
"My Omega," Steve growls, taking Tony's slack mouth in a claiming, possessive kiss.
"I thought they were cheery," Steve tells him.
," Tony protests.
Tony whines, and Steve feels a hot rush of slick dampening Tony's pants, even through his own. A moment later, the smell hits him, and Steve growls, fist tightening in Tony's hair and smashing their mouths together for another rough kiss.
"But I'm an Omega," he says. "Omegas don't…"
They eat quietly for a few minutes, the awkwardness stretching between them.
know that's why Steve contracted with King Howard, don't you?"
"Alright," Pepper says, placing a gentle, soothing hand on his arm. "Okay, Tony. It's going to be okay. We'll go back to your chambers, then, so you can get ready."
"Now, what can I do for you?" Tony asks, gesturing to a chair for Steve to sit down. Tony remains standing until Steve is seated, then sits across from him.
Steve takes another sip of his wine. He should say something, but he can't think of
And, now that he's bonded, his Alpha will have final say about his hobbies and projects. If Lord Steven has a problem with his engineering texts, he'll have to get rid of them. He'll have to do whatever Lord Steven says.
"So, how many Kings and queens and rich and powerful folks do you know?" Sam doesn't give Steve a chance to answer. "Now, how many of those people do you
About the men I'd want to fuck?
"That's it, honey," Steve murmurs, his other hand reaching around Tony's hip to pet at the slick, stretched skin of his entrance. He slides his finger over it gently, lightly, around the rim of skin stretched around Steve's thick cock.
Instead, Steve picks him up, twists him and hitches him up, and Tony can't help but wrap his legs around Steve's narrow waist, and Steve tilts his chin up for a kiss. Tony meets him, lips and tongue searching and wild, trying to seek out all of Steve's taste, trying to make Steve understand how much he wants the Alpha, how much he needs him, right now. How strong his desire, how wild his arousal.
Tony stares at him, face still pale. "I would," he says, swallowing hard, "very much like to do whatever would make you happy."
"I have to take Sam and Bucky and Clint, and we're going to go down and… deal with it."
"–And he said he was going to the border, where they've got him, or them, or – it doesn't matter, he was going to the south, so he can question the prisoner–"
"Well, at least half that bouquet in your hand is poison oak, your highness."
Pepper tilts her head, studying him for a long moment, before she gives him a small smile. "No it's not," she says.
"Yeah, that's what they're trained in," he snorts.
"You're ridiculous," Natasha says, leaning back in her chair as she watches him run around the room like an idiot. She'd come to him 20 minutes ago, ostensibly just to watch him make a fool of himself.
Because a male Omega wouldn't be able to produce children with a male Alpha. The genetics are simple – the Alpha and Omega genes are recessive, and the only way to produce an Alpha or an Omega child would be to have one parent be an Alpha and the other an Omega. Beta parents almost always produce Beta children, since the Beta gene is dominant. But there's a flaw in the evolution of the male Omegas. They have a womb and heats, but because of the mutation that allows for an Omega to be a male, a fertilized egg won't survive.
"Ooh!" he says, bounding to Bucky's sofa with his eyes glued to the basket of pastries. "Bribery baking!"
He plops down onto the chair beside her. "He's never done this before."
bond with Steve. Surely any male Omega Consort would have done.
Steve frowns. "With you? Is – is he not feeling well?"
Tony blinks.
–" No, that sounds stupid, too.
There he goes again.
"Awkward. Your first meeting with your shiny new bondmate, awkward? Surely you jest."
He glances back and sees why – Steve's one-armed friend is on his way over, his Beta mate following after him.
sorry you have to move to butt-fuck nowhere on the edge of the world."
Tony scowls. "They're making that up," he says, biting viciously into a warm bread roll. He picks a knife out of Pepper's basket and dips the end into a butter dish, dabbing it fastidiously on his bread. "Steve isn't loud at all."
You're my
Steve studies him for a moment, then decides to throw caution to the wind and lean back on the sofa, pulling Tony with him. It takes a moment to arrange themselves so that Tony is against his chest, but eventually Steve is able to settle them comfortably and wrap one arm around Tony's shoulders.
"No, no, I want it, I want to feel you – fuck – stretching me open, feel you filling me, god, like that," Tony moans, not stopping, still pushing back and back until he's all the way down, Steve's whole cock inside him. He's trembling, cheeks flushed with pain and pleasure, and his cock has flagged but it's still half hard, and he stays there for a moment.
, and his heat is setting off an Alpha rut. He's filled with a deep sense of need, like a violent storm raging in him telling him to take, to claim.
"Father was
Tony hasn't met anyone lucky enough to have been in the training programs and gotten out.
Tony does look up at him then, out of surprise. "You don't have to, you know," he says, mouth ticking up at the corner. "Court me, I mean. I'm kind of a sure thing, here."
Pepper, as always, takes charge.
Okay, so
"Tony, it's okay," Steve says, rubbing his thumbs over Tony's hands. "We don't have to rush, okay? We can take our time."
"I just don't know how to talk to him," Steve says. "It's like he's afraid to say anything to me, like he doesn't know the answers to simple questions. What does he like to do, what does he like to eat, what was it like growing up a prince – he seemed
He hadn't even considered that Steve hadn't
"You're gorgeous," he breathes, palm sliding over the lace over Tony's ribs. Tony's whole body shivers, his eyelashes flutter and he swallows.
The corner of Tony's mouth ticks up. "I know," he says, surprising himself with the truthfulness of it.
Sam smirks at him. "You just gotta be you, man. You're kind, and generous, and kind of a dork. Just be gentle with him. Convince him you're not what he expects."
The biggest bang for my buck
Tony gives him another small smile, and even that much soothes the cacophony in Steve's head a little. He doesn't answer, though.
"You said you wouldn't be in danger," Tony argues.
"Oh, god, oh, god," Tony is moaning, and Steve pets his hair soothingly, kissing him.
He's fascinated by the feel and taste of Tony's mouth. Tony feels hotter than anyone he's ever kissed before, and Steve doesn't know how much of that is the fact he's in heat, and how much of it is just because he's
"–He got word that a group of his men had caught a Chitauri scout or maybe a troop, I can't remember–"
A light flush dusts Prince Anthony's –
Ready to be mounted and knotted by an Alpha.
"It'll be easier from behind," Steve whispers into his ear. "If I mount you. But if you want, I can still take you like this without hurting you."
+++++
Steve groans, revelling in the feeling of his knot swelling and locking them together again. He grinds forward, watching as Tony shudders and jerks. His cock stays soft, but a dry orgasm overtakes him and he cries out, his whole body tensing and shaking.
Maria but he'd thought she'd been light skinned. Oh well, it doesn't matter.  The man isn't tall, and he's slim. His eyes are striking against his dark skin. Steve bows deeply, trying to keep his nerves from showing.
It's days later when he receives word – through Rhodey – that Steve has returned. In fact, Steve arrives home and heads straight to his own rooms. Tony expects to hear from him, to be summoned to him, something. But nothing happens. Steve arrives home, and simply… goes about his business.
She smiles at him again, and this time it's more natural, more warm. "I'm just here for a visit, your highness."
"Jesus, Buck."
"Thank you," Steve says, offering Tony a small smile. "But what about the baths?"
Her green eyes shine, and her pert nose turns pink with determination not to cry. "If – if he's awful, if he's a monster, Tony, we'll find a way to–"
"I think – if you want, I'll be, um, ready. This evening," Tony says. He doesn't turn around, still facing the gate away from Steve. "If you'd like."
.' 'No, of course you can't bond without a dowry and you're treated like a second class citizen, but in Krasnyygorod the Omegas aren't even that – they're chattel, kept and traded and used like animals.'
"Buck. Bruce, good to see you."
Steve thinks about it for a long moment, then lets a small smile creep onto his face. "To messages," he says, tipping his glass up. Tony smiles, a small blush gracing his cheekbones, and clinks his glass with Steve's. They both take a long, fortifying drink.
exam?" Steve repeats.
"But what if he doesn't
He stares at Tony in horror. Tony stares back at him, confusion and shock warring on his face.
Prince Anthony swallows, his throat bobbing with the force of it, then stands up, looking up at Steve from underneath his black eyelashes. Steve is mesmerized by the way Prince Anthony's eyes are so sharply framed, and wonders if he's wearing kohl around the rims to define them better, or if it's fully natural.
“None that I need answered right now.” Tony said smiling.
“Why would you say that Fury? He’s done nothing but save our asses, and besides Thor and I were the ones who screwed up yesterday.” He said, starting to get angry.
Needless to say he lost track of time. He felt as if he had been down there for years, the pain and sleep all bled into one.
Steve sat at the kitchen table sketching, it was one of those nights. The clock read 3:15 am and Steve sighed, time seemed to be moving incredibly slow.
“Clint calm down.” Natasha scolded, “You aren’t actually five years old.”
“Captain Rogers would like me to inform you that there’s breakfast for the whole team waiting for you in the kitchen.”
I realize that Fury, Pepper and Rhodey all seem a bit mean right now and unlike how they are Imin the movies. This is for the story but don’t worry I will fix it by the end. I really do like Fury and Tony’s weird friendship...? That they have in the movies.
“Mmm” Tony hummed, then pulled Steve in for a deep kiss. When they pulled away they both spoke at the same time,
Steve was horrified, this is what he thought?
“Jarvis, do you know?” Bruce asked
Tony shook his head “I’m no hero, that’s why I have the nightmares. It’s the price I pay for being a murder.” He said, looking like he wanted to cry. “I just need sleep so badly but I can’t watch you guys die, it’s just… too much.” He said sadly. He then made a move to get up but Steve held firm.
After that Steve went up to shower and then started to cook his team breakfast in the communal kitchen. He wasn’t sure if Tony would be back in time for it but he wanted to do something nice for his team no matter how small. Back before the serum his family was always doing things for him, he wanted a chance to give back, even if he couldn’t give to them directly. As he was finishing up pancakes members of the team began to make their way down, the smell of food being too good to resist.
Once Tony was finished with the work for SI he was about to get up and leave before he remembered he wanted to look at the coding for the robot from the last battle. Something had seemed really familiar about it and he had yet to figure it out.
“So where is Stark?” Clint asked
Tony looked up through his tears, horrified that Steve was leaving him. That it was all true after all.
“Yeah yeah, it’s right over here, Point Break.” Tony smiled softly.
“What?” Steve asked shocked, “Tony it’s not ugly or wrong. I think it’s beautiful and it’s a part of you. Anything part of my Tony is gorgeous and it shows just how far you’ve come.” He said, then he planted a kiss right at the center of the reactor, bringing a hand up to worship and explore.
“Holy shit that did not just happen!” Clint shouted, “Someone call the history book authors!” He shouted.
Tony blushed and looked down bashfully.
“Really? Because I wasn’t. I thought you were gone baby. I missed you more than anything and I can’t imagine what those monsters did to you.” Steve said angry, but then sighed and stroked Tony’s face, “But it’s okay if you don’t want to talk right away, just know I’m here to help you, and I always will be because I love you.”
Steve and the others had no idea what hit them. One minute they were all sleeping then the next and explosion knocked the building.
“Come join us, brother, this movie is amazing.” Thor dragged him over to the couch. Where he wedged Tony in between him and Steve.
“That doesn’t matter. Letting him die is not the way.” Steve said, in his full Captain America voice.
“Well in this case it can, the longer I wait to make improvements for The Avengers the world is at risk. I have to do it.” Tony said sternly and before Steve could say anything else Tony walked away.
“It’s just some corrections we had Fury make.” Steve said, serious.
“He’s alive,” Clint said, “That has to count for something.”
“Hey Steve, so you and Natasha-”
“Hey I survived months in a cave.” And just like that the mood sobered up.
Oh well they could both be saps then.
“Bruce what’s happening? It’s Tony okay? What’s going on?” He asked frantically.
“Well, um, I just want to start off by saying no pressure and technically you already live with me in the tower, but uh, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to move in with me? Like in my room, I mean we can share a room that is…?” Tony trailed off, nervous.
Steve was about to ask him to help the Hulk when a giant octopus alien managed to grab him with his tentacles. They wrapped around him fast and immediately began to crush him.
Tony could only moan out in response as Donald removed the wires.
He kept on shooting blasts but there seemed to be no effect. Tony was beginning to panic, “Steve, baby don’t worry I’m gonna get this thing off you. Just hold on!”
“Mr. Stark had just finished working on a project for SI when he became distracted by the coding for the robot from the last battle.” Jarvis explained. “It was the same robot that took him.”
“Well glad to see you haven’t lost your sense of humor.” Rhodey murmured dryly crossing his arms.
“Steve.” Tony smiled, eyes shining. “What happened?”  He asked looking around.
“Oh you saw that did you? Yeah it’s the living room of where me, my mom and pa used to live. It was a very small house..but very warm.” Steve said wistfully.
He wanted to run away and cry and find his Steve. But he couldn’t so much as lift his arm.
“We must help our brother or Iron!”
“What?” Steve asked confused.
After Tony read the documents, a warm happiness he hadn’t felt in a long time settled in his chest. The team all decided to spend time together in the common room after that.
Steve just sighed and leaned in to give Tony a deep kiss. Tony started to pull him in more- “Nuh-uh, Tony we can’t have the burgers burning.”
They walked upstairs from the lab and were greeted with the rest of the team.
“Thanks Rhodey.” Tony said, “So I was thinking we could go out to my favorite burger place-or wherever you want- and then we could come back here to catch up.” Tony said enthusiastically.
“A pint and a half is what Jarvis said would work. Just enough to heal his injured body but not enough to overwhelm him.” Bruce said as he prepared the IV.
“Ugh.” Tony said as he slammed his head on the table.
Steve moaned in response, “Oh that’s perfect, Tony.”
“Any word from Clint?”
“Well he sounds like a fine warrior but an even more honorable man.” Thor said resting his hand on Steve’s shoulder, “I’m sorry for your loss, Steve.”
“Where’s Thor?” Natasha asked.
“Hey Steve I was wondering if I could see you in my lab for a moment?” He asked, “I need to draw some blood from you. I figured out a serum that could help delay the Hulk. He reacts to danger and if I could extract some healing capabilities from the serum and put it into me, then Hulk wouldn’t need to come out for less severe situations.” He explained.
He couldn’t believe they had said those things about him, all along that’s what they thought. And Steve…. he didn’t love Tony. God Tony loved him so much, with everything he had and it wasn’t enough. He felt his heart break when they said those hateful words, it was without a doubt their voices on the recording. It’s why they hadn’t come for him. Justin said he wasn’t hard to find. He wasn’t sure if he’d ever be okay again. Just goes to show that Tony Stark was hated and worthless.
“In my defense I wasn’t down here looking to bother you. I was actually doing what you told me to do and trying to get some sleep.” He said looking down, “However life has different plans and I just can’t sleep without getting nightmares.” He said, running his hands through his hair and gripping it tightly.
“Glad to have your approval.” Tony said dryly, getting up. “Oh and by the way I’m the one who made the first move so you pay up to Natasha or you can have her come for you. I’m fine with either option.” Tony smiled.
Tony gripped the arms of the chair tightly and closed his eyes, he didn’t want to see.
“Oh” Tony deflated. “Well that’s too bad.” He said rubbing the back of his neck. “Well maybe we have something here.”
“Wait…” Tony said slowly, “You're telling me that I’m a super soldier now?”
A moment later Pepper stood in front of Tony, with her hands on her hips looking irritated.
Another week went by before the Avengers were needed for a mission. Both Clint and Thor were still away and Steve was starting to worry a bit, but he tried not to let himself stress out too much.
“Well that oughta be our most successful mission yet.” Clint said
Once they finished dinner: a quite eventful dinner, Clint and Thor decided to see who could eat the most bread, Clint lost. Needless to say they had a much too happy Thor and overly dramatic Clint.
“I’m sorry Pep, I didn’t want to seem like I’m making excuses.”
“Sounds like a plan.” Tony said, voice thick with emotion.
Tony heaved in huge breaths of relief.
“Yes.” Said Agent Coulson, “Your priority is to minimize the damage and destroy that thing as soon as possible.”
It had been two weeks of endless torture. Donald would shoot more adrenaline in his arm and keep him awake to power the machines.
Tony frowned at that, in order to change that subject he said, “So Steve, I just wanted to let you know that I’m working on a code to disable bombs that will be part of my suit. I was working on it last night.”
No one in the car had the heart or energy to argue with him. So they all just murmured sounds of agreement.
“Well who knew we would have two super soldiers on the team?” Clint joked.
“I’m sorry Pepper, I’ve been busy with the Avengers business. I have been working on it believe me, I’m almost done.” Tony supplied
Tony shrugged, “Well that’s what usually happened. Howard would host some huge party, usually it was a stunt for business and I would end up alone. Jarvis saw that and took me with his family instead.”
He rounded the corner into the living room when he saw Steve hugging Natasha. He was sporting a huge smile and looked really happy.
“You sure you want to go?” Steve asked, unsure, “You seem a little...tense.”
“What..? Uh, no Jarvis. Let’s just pick up where we left off.”
“What? That makes no sense!” Yelled Clint, “He never does whatever he wants.” Clint shrugged looking down, “I mean I know I joke a lot about Stark. But I know what he does for us. I see how he works to make our equipment top of the line. I know he cares and tries to protect us.”
“Director, Tony Stark, our brother is missing.” Thor declared.
“My fellow Avengers! The vessel that transported that horrible man is now vanquished! This Gala is officially a success!” Thor boomed.
Pepper just sighed, “I mean really Tony, you can’t even manage a company, I had to take over for you.”
“Tony you need to take a break.” Steve said seriously, “I know you never went to bed last night and you had a meeting really early this morning.”
He was so happy and he knew Steve was one in a million.
“I’ll have you know, Donald, that this event was organized by Pepper and if you actually had listened to anything anyone has said tonight, no profits will be going to Stark Industries, only to charities and rebuilding organizations.”
Tony smiled bashfully in response and-jeez when did Tony Stark display such emotions? Probably when he fell in love with Steve Rogers.
“I have tried to change the recommendation on my original assessment of him. I wanted to put them as both recommended, because my original report was biased.” Natasha said with a practiced neutral tone, “However he wouldn’t let me touch it, some bullshit excuse about needing original documentation.”
“No fingerprints or any traceable DNA.” Jarvis said.
He was tied down to a metal table, with nothing but his boxers on, his wrists and ankles cuffed with metal, along with a metal restraint around his neck and stomach.
Steve groaned, “You will be the death of me.” He said, grabbing Tony’s hands and rubbing them. “Go to the table, it’s almost done.”
Nights like these were usually when he couldn’t stop thinking about Bucky and Peggy and how much he missed them. This was the first night however when he found himself not wishing he could go back. As much as he loved them, he was finding space in his heart for his new team. He smiled when he thought of the other night when Thor, Tony and himself were all practically snuggling with each other.
“Good. Now that we are clear I have one more thing I need to do before I explain what’s going to happen.” He smirked.
Steve only smiled and looked down.
“No, it was planned. Tony was down in his lab and that was exactly where to robot go him.” Steve said, barely containing himself.
They sat in each other’s embrace like that for the rest of the night until they both fell into a peaceful sleep.
“Oh nothing we are just having a team dinner and it’s mandatory.” Steve said smiling.
“Now to everyone who’s listening, I understand if you don’t agree with the way we go about saving and helping people, however no one is to speak to us like they did Tony. Our job as Avengers is to protect the world, but to do that we have each other’s backs.” Steve said to the room.
“Does matter? It’s Stark we are talking about, he’s irresponsible and selfish and it’s only a matter of time before he screws up.” Fury said shaking his head. “Now if you’ll excuse me I have other matters to attend to.”
“Yes… maybe it could. I’ll use a similar formula that I did for me.” Bruce smiled, “But guys this is a long shot and we don’t know how Steve’s blood will affect Tony. There might be mutations or Tony’s body could reject the blood.”
“What’s going on Pepper? Is there something you need me to sign?” Tony asked, crossing his arms, subconsciously defending himself.
Seriously, come on! All the Avengers in one very crowded place with alcohol being served was probably the conditions for a perfect storm. But it was too late to go back now as they were all going to meet up in the lobby for Happy to drive them.
“Look how about no more meetings, press or presentations.” Pepper said. “If there’s something really important we can video chat or I can tell you way in advance. But I’ll summarize and bring all the important things for you to sign and just have you focus on the inventing part of SI.”
