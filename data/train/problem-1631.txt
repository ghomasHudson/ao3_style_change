John was still silent. Sherlock felt as though he was careening on the edge of a cliff, not sure whether he was falling forward or backwards.
Sherlock noted that John looked rested. The grief and anger and exhaustion of the last year was dripping away from him, morning by morning.
There was a crashing knock at the door, and Mr. John Garrideb barrelled into the room, waving a piece of paper. “Look, Mr. Garrideb, I’ve – oh, Mr. Holmes, Doctor Watson! How fortuitous that you are here as well! It appears as though our search is over – I’ve found him!”
Sherlock’s head turned to John but he kept his eyes down. “You asked what I saw when I looked at your picture of me. I saw – I saw a man with a secret.”
The address actually wasn’t hard to find. Given their work, you’d think they’d be more careful, but there it is on the internet – 221B Baker Street. Right by Regent’s Park, which is likely why John suggested a walk there.
Mycroft clearly heard John’s comment and frowned, then his face cleared to blandness. “You have finally succeeded in astonishing me, brother. It’s all over the newsvidders. Millions saw your fall live. The search continues, with the entire populace roiling in hysterical worry. The search authorities are refusing to admit that because your body has not been found, this is likely a recovery mission, not a rescue any more. Persephone mourns. I hope you’re happy.”
“Ah! Now you are asking the correct questions, Inspector. To that end, I would like to speak with the household staff, if I may.”
The same dust and stillness greeted them in the hallway of the building, and the door to the street hung crookedly on its broken hinges. He wrenched the door open.
A low gust of humourless laughter from John. “Sherlock, I don’t regret what you and I did. Not one bit. But I need to tell you this.”
I got lots of background information on star systems in the ‘Verse from the Firefly/Serenity wiki pages: http://firefly.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page
They laughed softly into each other’s mouths, then kissed, and for just a brief moment there was no guard, no danger, no threat of imprisonment, just themselves.
“Oh Sherlock,” Jim murmured. Sherlock felt his breath hot against his lips. “I do not doubt your abilities. Not for a moment. I have no doubt that when we are together, we will be incandescent. For we’re the same, you and I. We were meant to be together. I believe that. I believe it so strongly that I’m willing to wait… for both your body, and your mind.”
“And they are not involved,” Holmes said. “I occasionally work with Scotland Yard, but I do not work for them. Mr. Nathan Garrideb involved me because he thought I could assist with your search. You two gentlemen have a difficult task ahead of you, and I hope I can expedite the process.”
Sherlock sat on the floor, his back against his bed, his legs stretched out in front of him. “And Rosie, she’s growing so fast. See? She looks like John when she laughs, but like Mary when she cries.”
He heard the splash of Sherlock getting in the tub. It wasn’t going to be a satisfying soak for him, John thought; he had noticed that the bath was shorter than the one at Baker Street, and there was no way Sherlock’s long body would fit in it. He got up and gave into his curiosity, peering through the crack of the slightly open door.
“Then I found The Work, and winter only meant snow getting in the way of clues, or freezing would preserve footprints in mud, and so forth.”
They all sat, and Garrideb made himself comfortable in a way that made John realize that Americans were the same, in all times.
Time after time, Sherlock fought to shove those thoughts away from his brain, forced himself to focus on the present issue. Focus was of the utmost importance now, if they wanted to succeed.
“Your accent – the elongated and atonal pronunciation of your As was the giveaway. Your father was a miner of amniculusite, possibly even a foreman, so you would likely have the specific knowledge I need. What does the H stand for?”
The airlimo pulled up to the portal of Moriarty’s skyhome, the water below glinting in the sunlight. A man in a plain black cotton gi opened the door. Sherlock stepped out and smoothed his clothes – a silken red and black hanfu with a phoenix carefully embroidered over the back. He had taken care with his appearance, even more so than usual. This was an important meeting.
“That’s the communication panel you’re sittin’ at,” John said, indicating the screen in front of Sherlock. “Press that black button – no, the one right next to the screen.”
I excuse myself to the loo, then come back and tell John I’ve had a call from my sister, who needs me to Skype her immediately, need to get home, so sorry to cut it short, yes let’s get together next week, that would be lovely.
Sherlock only had eyes for John. John was being led to the gate, but when he caught sight of Maja, his face hardened, deep lines forming in his forehead.
John kept a firm grip on Sherlock’s shoulder as they made their way back towards the inn. “We’re almost there, Sherlock.”
“Of course that’s the question, that’s why the professionals are here,” Anderson sneered. Clearly he was trying to establish his position in the room, in his universe.
“Ah, you’re here, excellent,” Mr. Dunworthy said, looking up from a book as he sat by the comp. “The numbers finished running five minutes ago, Bahdri.”
“You served me tea, and told me it was natural oolong, the tea grown naturally on Highgate. And suddenly all the pieces fell together. All the cases in the spider’s web had to do with something false masquerading as the real thing, while you took the real thing for yourself. Gold in dental work instead of synthetic. Fake stultorumite painted to look like amniculusite. The jealous lover, the false Romeo poisoning the real one. And then I realized that I was sitting in front of the false Jim Moriarty-”
He looked up. Sherlock had stopped, and was staring down at the body as if hypnotized by it. The sudden absence of movement was as abrupt as a slammed door, and everyone in the room stopped, waiting for the flood of deductions. John looked to Sherlock as well, but no one knew Sherlock Holmes as well as John Watson did. John could see that Sherlock’s stillness was not the calm before the storm of answers to the mystery, but rather because Sherlock was stuck.
“Five, six, seven, eight,” John said. “Now switch to heels.” He raised himself up on his toes and brought his heels down with sharp clicks. Sherlock followed suit.
He slept fitfully, with vague dreams of searching for his gun, then of Sherlock’s voice just outside of his hearing. He got up just before dawn and made a strong coffee, wincing at the metallic bitterness of it.
“It’s coming onto five o’clock now. Sunset isn’t until nine or so, but the play starts at seven, I think. Enough time to have a good look around, ask some questions.”

any more. I’ve seen what’s out there – there’s crime, there’s murder, there’s kidnapping. I nearly lost Rosie to that, and I shot the man who took her. I killed him, and I’ll never face the repercussions for that. That’s what it’s like out there, it’s lawlessness. In here, everything works within the rules, there’s civility here. That’s good. But there’s no part for me to play here, and you know it.”
“Oh come now, I’m not stupid. If I’m still not well, I should be in hospital. If I’m not sufficiently ill for hospital, I should be free to go, or my embassy or family should have been contacted. Since that has not happened, I assume that your actual purpose is to keep an eye on me for Pavlović.”
They moved silently from their hiding space to the trap door. John’s heart was hammering with exhilaration as he positioned himself opposite Holmes on the lip of the hole in the floor.
Hat. Jacket, rattling with medals. Braces. Shoes polished to glass. Trousers. Shirt. Vest. Socks. Pants. The General stood, naked, his body ageing but still muscular and powerful. His cock was already starting to plump up. A small smile was fluttering around his mouth.
Holmes was frozen in place, his eyes flicking from the ducks to the swans. “Say that again, Doctor.”
Sherlock’s face was completely deadpan, as if it was usual business for his head to float into sight perpendicular to the wall. He moved slowly, as though he was an astronaut in space. The more slowly he moved, the more John laughed. Then, just as leisurely, his head disappeared from view.
“I was shaking like a leaf, I don’t mind saying, Doctor Watson,” said Brigit, finally finding her voice.
He was stirring the chocolate over the pot before he spoke again. “So how did you learn how to bake? Took a case in a bakery in Paris?”
He heard his heart rate rise, the pinging becoming more rapid, and he forced himself to breathe, to relax. It was important to stay calm, to stay focused; it was his only chance.
tonight?” he said, pleased with himself that he’d thought to look at the programme in his hand before he began this conversation. “One of my favourites.” He hoped fervently that no one would ask him more details about the play; he couldn’t remember it from school at all.
The tidal wave of the man’s dilemma broke over Moira’s head, more than it had done with any other customer - or any other person - in her life. She gave both of them a moment to breathe it in.
John stepped back away from the door, shaking his head at the nonsense. It would work itself out of his system eventually.
Something shifted inside Sherlock. He knew now that John might not be an ally, but now he knew he wasn’t an enemy either.
“Give them to me,” Holmes said, and Cubitt obliged, pulling a number of pages from his breast pocket. It seemed to John that Cubitt’s tension eased a little as he handed the papers over to Holmes, as though the papers carried weight beyond their actual appearance.
Slade stared in horror and disbelief at Holmes, then at Inspector Martin and John. He saw affirmation in their eyes, and put his face in his hands and wept.
Sherlock felt the explosion before he heard it, a wave of air breaking against his back, buffeting him into John’s body. The sound assaulted his ears as forcefully, and he and John both instinctively crouched to hide from it, their arms flying up to protect themselves and each other.
“No, sir, I don’t think he did. Well, Mr. Holmes and Doctor Watson came in, and it went very well, and an arrest was made this morning.”
Now John found himself grinning broadly. “Yes. After a rough start, I find myself rather liking fatherhood.”
John’s words, and his palpable relief, made something warm curl deep inside himself. Sherlock needed to let the warmth out; he needed to dance, and he needed to dance with John. “You’re as narrow minded as the rest of them. I need to warm up. Put your shoes on.”
“Well, you dead would have been fine, but then when you survived, I thought this would be much more fun. Having you here.”
Then they sprang into action, hauling Hope to his feet and holding him firmly as he swayed. They talked about taking Hope’s cab to the Yard, as John stood, panting slightly, John looked up and saw Holmes staring at him, his eyes full of curiosity and wonder.
He toweled himself off afterwards, feeling a little more alert. Bahdri knocked at the door and came in before John could respond. “Oh good, you didn’t drown. Excellent. Sit down on the toilet, we’re going to neaten up that pile of straw on your face.”
“It’s nothing, Mrs. Hudson,” Sherlock said as he slid out of his clothes and into a robe, sighing as the silk caressed the bruise on his side.
Fortunately he was not carrying Rosie at that time, so she was uninjured. But Sherlock fell hard against the rubble. Rosie rushed over to him making childish noises of sympathy, as one who remembered learning to walk and frequent resulting tumbles. Sherlock checked himself for damage – possibly a sprained ankle, bruised ribs and a graze on his palm and cheek. He shook himself and cursed his clumsiness.
Martin looked as though he was about to protest, but realized that he had little leg to stand on. “There are the cook and the maid, sir, who were the only people in the house when it happened, apart from Mr. and Mrs. Cubitt, of course.”
Sherlock sagged with relief – his accent was clearly, undoubtedly English. “Thank God,” he said, shaking the man’s hand. “Are you from the embassy? I couldn’t get word-”
He wondered vaguely if he should call Professor Mackleroy and apologize, reschedule his defense; then realized he didn’t really care if he got his thesis. He’d had enough of history.
Notes floated up to the high ceiling and back down, creating an echo of rounded tones that rolled around the café. Everyone in the café froze at the first sounds, and one by one, adults and children alike raised their eyes from their phones and books. Even the barista was still. John looked up and saw faces at the windows of the Conservatory peering down into the atrium. For a building that revolved around music, this kind of attention proved that Vernet’s playing was above what they were accustomed to.
, indeed. At the Academy, he would sit at her feet and hear her stories about her journeys as a young woman, out in the Black. Her stories filled him with strange feelings, like he was missing a place he had never been. He had felt the stirrings of the same longing with John telling his stories the week previous. John, like Inara, seemed to have an infinite array of tales to tell. He wondered if John would mind meeting outside the purpose of a case, and if he would mind telling Sherlock more of his stories.
He swam and swam until he lost all sense of time. His limbs were feeling heavier, and his silken robes were dragging him down. He tried to get out of the robes, but the knotted ties gripped hard and would not loosen. He swam on.
“No, thank you,” said John. His head was buzzing with fear and leftover adrenaline. “I’m all right. I just – jarred it.”
Sherlock sneered again. “For God’s sake, don’t make me laugh. Can’t maintain the illusion of hating each other if you make me laugh.”
“Nonsense, Sherlock, you are my guest.” Jim nodded at the servant. “Thank you, Alphonse, that’s all for now.”
Sherlock’s legs gave out and he sat, heavily, on the sofa next to John. He stared at John, unable to look away, his mind a riot of static.
He was filling in her hair with circular motions of his pencil when he realized when he had seen those contours before. All at once he saw Rosie reflected in Harry’s face – the jawline, the nose, and the curly, white-blonde hair.
A few moments later, there was a glass with a healthy splash of whisky by his side, and Sherlock was sitting expectantly across from him.
John kissed him once more, whispered, “Thank you. I love you too.” Then he straightened his back, lifted his chin, and walked out the door.
Bahdri made him a meal, and he ate some of it. Bahdri also changed the sheets on John’s bed, and nodded understandingly when John said he wanted to sleep a bit. He hugged John before he left, holding him so hard that John nearly wept again. Then he left.
“I went right downstairs and caught Pavlović just as he was coming in. Started ranting and raving about what an arsehole you were, that you were a psychopath, that you were driving me crazy. He was trying to calm me down and we sat down in that little kitchenette. I remembered that the guards often have a bottle of something, and asked for a drink to calm me down. I got Pavlović to have one or two as well.
Sherlock held the drawing aloft and shook it impatiently, almost accusingly. “This is still better than the other gawkish attempts I saw on display tonight.”
- No longer necessary. I doubt the murderer even needed to leave the theatre to find something to use. Though in this case I suspect conculium. It is colourless at room temperature and therefore could be easily slipped into water without detection. It has a slightly tannic taste, but doubtful that Romeo would have noticed that, being out of breath and parched after that brief and unconvincing fight with Paris. Conculium is also easily purchased, as it’s an excellent shoe polish. Works nicely on warts, too. So a perfect poison for the occasion.”
And so, the following Sunday, the collection of judges was seated with their drinks of choice in the lounge, and John and Sherlock were standing awkwardly in the doorway of the kitchen. (Sherlock had drawn the line at personalized aprons, and John was secretly relieved.)
He straightens his back, and looks rather smug for a guy that’s only just figured something out about himself. “I am an asexual homoromantic with grey overtones. I have learned that I am capable of love-”
Evans, formerly known to them as John Garrideb, entered the room. He took no efforts to move quickly or quietly, clearly confident in the knowledge that he was alone. He strode up to a desk that was in the corner of the room and pushed it out of the way. The carpet underneath was efficiently rolled back to reveal a trap door.
He took one of his pieces of origami paper, and wrote ‘BOMB’ on it. Then he pinned it to the map, where the hotel once stood.
They entered the theatre. The actors, still in costume, were in small knots across the stage, stunned looks on their faces. Juliet was still weeping noisily. Anderson was handcuffing a woman all in black clothes.
Sherlock tried not to sigh too loudly as he let the words wash over them. It wasn’t a bad production, really; someone had taken the time to be historically accurate with the costumes, but the sword fights had been ridiculous, swiping at each other with no real sense of the tension that the scene called for. He wondered for a moment about how different his life would have been if he’d been an actor – then smiled with a sudden memory of John: “
It was early May, but the room was cool and raised gooseflesh along his arms and legs. He pulled off his undergarments and slid under the chilly sheets of his bed. His erection briefly flagged, but a couple of strokes had him in a rock hard condition again.
John’s lips brushed his, dry and soft and quiet, more a tickle than a kiss. Then another, more firm, and another. Sherlock’s breath shuddered.
“Rosie,” Sherlock said sharply, holding her more tightly. She was being naughty; why was she being naughty? They might not let them stay if Rosie was naughty. “Behave.”
There was a rustle, and then a man emerged from the room Sherlock had assumed to be the kitchen. He was small in stature and small in posture, his shoulders pinched in from pain or apology. His face was lined and tired, his hair sandy and grey, but his vivid blue eyes told Sherlock that he was younger than his appearance – late 30s or early 40s. He leaned heavily on a cane, limping across the room to Sherlock, his hand extended.
He landed, absorbing the shock through the bend of his legs. Almost immediately he jumped again, straight up, using momentum to spin a complete circle twice before landing. He could hear gasps from the audience. It made him want to smirk, thinking of what was in store for them, that he was only just beginning; but he kept his face framed in lines of the grief and ennui of his character.
First the smooth slide of the wonton against the palette and the tongue, then the application of pressure with the teeth, producing a small amount of water from the steaming process, and then the clash of flavours: pork predominant, with five spice powder tracing around the edges of the mouth, and chives tickling the high senses of taste.
Completely nude, Sherlock looked at John for the first time since he had taken his jacket off. John’s mouth went dry.
Once the body had been removed, Martin turned to Holmes. “Now then, Mr. Holmes – do you concur with my analysis of the situation?”
“He just gets – look, you have every right to be pissed at me. I’ve no right to expect it, but may I call you tomorrow? Take you out for dinner, make it up to you? Have a proper date?”
“I will,” Sherlock said, pushing John away slightly, “but first… let me…” and he slid slowly to his knees.
Their eyes met again, the world stopping, just for a moment. Then Sherlock put gloves on and set to work, while John prepared chocolate for the decorations.
the other screamed, and jumped at Sherlock. Sherlock dodged out of the way, but grunted with surprise when he felt a small explosion of pain in his lower ribs. The man had pulled out his cosh quicker than Sherlock had anticipated. Sherlock stumbled, his nerves numbed by the blow, and fell hard on the filthy ground. The man rushed him and Sherlock kicked out, aiming for the knee but landing on the meat of the thigh instead, causing the man to stumble but not fall. It still allowed enough time for Sherlock to stagger to his feet, but he could see out of the corner of his eye the big man shaking his head and starting to stand. He had to take down the little one before the big one got up.
“Common,” Holmes said, with a sidelong smile. “You said the word ‘common’. Note that there are some figures that appear again and again, sometimes even side by side. What might we deduce about that?”
Sherlock stared at the door for a moment, then placed the monkey on the windowsill with the rest of the origami animals, watching the silhouettes they made as the sun rose behind them.
John turned out of Sherlock’s arms, and picked up his comically large hat, with “10/6” on the side. “I’d better go up.”
He rang off, and dialled Jerome, who picked up right away. “Heads up,” he panted into the phone. They were nearly clear of the crowd, and Bantam was starting to look backwards towards John. “Heading towards you and the café, dressed in black, name Michael Bantam.”
There was silence for a moment, uncomfortable and tense. Sherlock found himself already missing the easy flow of words between them. He covered his discomfort by concentrating on the folds of his origami.
Sherlock looked up at John, half shy, half pleading. “John – I want – I want to see all of you. Is that all right?”
He thought about the way Sherlock’s hand felt in his; the warmth of Sherlock next to him; his smile as he watched Rosie play.
“I insist. Also your colleague is skimming off the top of the sales, in cahoots with the cashier at desk twelve. I’ll meet you at customer service.”
“Likely I’ll perform a solo that was choreographed by Twyla Tharp for Baryshnikov. I danced it last year in New York. No other dancers, so that should make them happy. I could do it in my sleep.”
Each store they found seemed to have fewer and fewer supplies, and the rank smell of rot was stronger. At one point they found a larger supermarket with a storeroom, but the door had been broken down and ransacked. They did find a few supplies there, including a blanket, which he wrapped around them both, tying at his waist, so that Rosie was bound to his side. It kept them a little warmer.
“When did you pack?” John said. He was pleased with himself that he had thrown together his bag in short order – the benefits of not having brought much with him. But he had come downstairs to the sight of Holmes holding open the cab’s door, a valise already in hand.
“Fuck me,” Sherlock whined. He didn’t know how much he wanted it until the words came out. “I want – fuck – I want you to fuck me.”
“I’m calling to tell you that Chancellor Tang has been transferred to the rebuild on Whitefall. He will be sending – oh, I see they’ve arrived.”
Before Rosie could register what John meant, and before her face could droop with disappointment, Sherlock tugged his scarf off. “Well. I hope you will allow me to attend, Watson.”
Sherlock glanced around the small room, and saw a wooden door, carved but solid, with both an old iron handle and a modern lock - clearly the front door. Disbelievingly Sherlock stepped to the main door, keeping his eyes on John and Maja. They sat there at the table: John casually, his head tilted to the side; Maja was more tense, her mouth set in a firm, thin line. Sherlock opened the door and stepped out, his ears straining for the sound of a cocked gun. He closed the door carefully and quietly behind him.
John nodded, solemn, and said, almost to himself, “And then I got shot. Must admit I’ve been driftin’ around ever since.” John came back to himself, and looked back to Sherlock. “Got a
“So I went to Mrs. Cubitt, and Brigit says to me, ‘She’s been shot too’, and I saw she was right, and I told Brigit to go call for the doctor and the police.”
Holmes’ breathing was rabbit-quick, his eyes wide and frightened, and wet. John had never seen Holmes like this, never seen him with his mental defenses down, his emotions flayed and laid open for John to see. Holmes was frightened for him. Holmes was frightened for
He removed his right ballet slipper and, using a pair of nail scissors, carefully pried up the insole of the shoe. He slid the chip under the insole, pressing it into place. He replaced the shoe on his foot, and flexed his foot.
As though aligned with his words, the snow fell faster, covering the ground and the body in a thin layer of white. Sherlock nodded at Lestrade, and his team sprang into action, bagging the body and running about to confirm Sherlock's conclusions. Sherlock stepped back, suddenly awkward and superfluous.
Mycroft handed her his handkerchief, and she smiled gratefully and wiped her eyes. “He’s always had them, and he likely always will, sister mine,” he said gently. “He’s had them nearly thirty years now but this is the first time I’ve seen him so at peace.”
“I know, I know, sir, but think of the return on the investment of your time!” John Garrideb said. “Five million – it’s now within our grasp! Only a little effort… and I’ve made such effort already, it’s poor of you to not take on this small, final step!”
“Of course,” Holmes said blandly. “He believes himself to have already succeeded. I think between the three of us we should be able to subdue him.”
“In the years when I was… in a bad place, it meant always being cold, because I’d never have enough money left over to pay for heating. I still don’t like being cold.
“I can come to Glasgow with you. It’s a little less bucolic than France, but it will do for our purposes.”
Jim chuckled, high and eerie, in a way that vibrated down Sherlock’s spine. “What makes you think I did that?”
“They’ve set up a closed circuit in my dressing room, so I can… I can watch the first act while… oh, while Amy does the body paint… God damn it, John, you’re making me hard, and that
Greg glanced into the interrogation room. Sherlock stood imperiously next to the table, hands clasped behind his back, his nose in the air, radiating scorn and indignation.
She smiled at him. “I forget, you’ve lived your whole life on Persephone, haven’t you? Never been into the Black.” She paused, and Sherlock knew she was gathering her thoughts.
When Sherlock opened his eyes, the room was beginning to fill with morning sunlight. He stretched, and realized that John must have cleaned him up as he slept, judging from the lack of stickiness pulling at his skin and chest hair.
“He’s just my flatmate.” John said it on reflex, suddenly realizing that he didn’t even think before saying it now. Why? She hadn’t said anything about them being together, as a couple. Why was he still reacting like this?
His rage left him as quickly as it had come. He curled up on the divan, breathing heavily and gripping his hair painfully. He concentrated on his breathing, waiting for his rational mind to return.
“From the way they were treating you, from the way Pavlović talked about you, I got that you were a political hot potato for them. They wanted to keep you from leaving, whether by dying or any other means. But you weren’t in jail either.
“Excellent. I wanted to welcome you personally, and thank you, Mr. Holmes, for acquiescing to my request. I look forward to your performance.”
John gazed up at him, a slight smile on his face and his eyes bright. “S’alright,” he said, and Sherlock marvelled how John understood. “S’alright. Just you,
This is killing me, maybe it’s killing him. But if this is what it takes for these two stubborn gits to take the step then so be it.
Sherlock heard Pavlović growl minutely, deep in his throat. Then Pavlović smiled and raised his hand in greeting.
John handed Sherlock the end of the rope, and he tied it around his waist. Sherlock checked the knot, then opened the window and stepped out onto the ledge. He felt John’s hand on his ankle, and he looked down at him.
“And if I know the intelligence level of Scotland Yard, they will investigate and arrest people on the slightest excuse.”
Sherlock wished he could swallow back his words, swallow back everything he had said or done for the last twenty four hours.
JOHN: [rueful eye roll] Yeah, so to spend the time and to keep him from going around the bend, I challenged him to learn how to tap dance.
Sometimes we wouldn’t even leave the café. Just pull the curtains down and have at it over the counter. I’d sterilize the whole thing the next day though. I’m not a monster, or an idiot. I wouldn’t want to fail my health inspection over something like that.
John kissed him, and Sherlock couldn’t believe the amount of misery they had both walked through to get to this point, but at the moment he was incredibly grateful.
Maja was in the far corner, her fingers tangling in agitation, her eyes wide. “Stop it! Stop fighting! Grow up, both of you!”
He could ask Mrs. Hudson again, perhaps draw her as she baked. He could ask Molly, capture her timidity even while she worked on a corpse. But his fingers itched to capture Sherlock at work.
“All in good time, my dear Watson.” Holmes smiled, John thought a bit shyly. “I will admit I have a flair for the dramatic with cases, Watson – do forgive me my small pleasures.”
“I would be pleased to show you around the collection now,” said Mr. Garrideb. “It is the very least I can do for the trouble you’ve gone to.”
Sherlock was darting, nearly dancing around the body. John had filled ten pages with sketches so far, and his hand ached around the pencil, but he just couldn’t satisfactorily capture Sherlock’s movements, the swirl of the coat, his hands pointing and gesturing. He was valiantly ignoring Donovan’s odd looks at him; he had explained to Lestrade what he was doing, that he was taking a class, earning a clap on the shoulder and a ‘Good on ya, mate,’ from him, but he had said nothing to Donovan. She hadn’t earned an explanation from him.
Then he came out of the alley into Carter Lane, and there was St. Paul’s, arching up into the sky with the moon behind it. John stopped dead and stared. It was stunningly beautiful, and he gave his head a shake. He should be grateful: he was in London, during the era that had truly defined the city as a world power, its reputation still intact after two hundred years. This was London, and it was beautiful now in a way that was different from the London he was used to.
He blinked, and then there were two steaming bowls of soup in front of him. Two. And two large slices of bread.
When John came home, he found Sherlock folded up like a paperclip in his chair, still wearing his coat. His hands were wrapped around his legs, and white with tension. There were two red marks on his forehead, where he had been pressing his head into his knees.
On the bright side, Sherlock was correct about the location of the hideout. On the not-so-bright side, the gang was in it when John and Sherlock arrived, and the Yarders were not as close behind as they had thought they would be.
As they walked through the lobby, Sherlock noticed a number of men, all still wearing their hats, standing in the entrance of a small room. The men all looked up at their little group, and, nearly as one, nodded and went back to talking quietly amongst themselves. As they passed the small room, Sherlock caught a glimpse of two men sitting at desks, with headphones and watching several screens.
There was a jet directly behind John’s back. It started with a powerful burst of water, and John lost his tenuous hold on the bath. He found himself propelled away from Sherlock to the other end of the tub.
Sherlock sank into the chair on the right, and Jim sat on the left. “White doesn’t go first here,” Jim grinned. “Go ahead.”
The actress playing Juliet hesitated, and Sherlock saw Romeo twitch. Sherlock frowned; it was the first sign of lack of commitment to the play, and at the climax too. The actress clearly found this unprofessional as well, but went on.
In a flash, he remembered standing in the ancient Egyptian gallery at the museum, looking down at the decorated mummy’s coffin, and the haunted look in Sherlock’s eyes as he remembered the beds that the actives slept in, back at the House.
He saw the woman from the corner of his eye, saw that she was smiling now for the first time, but it was more of a smirk than a smile. The man noticed it too, and deflated slightly when he saw it. Then he turned to Sherlock again, with a more genuine smile.
He faced the two men and reviewed his situation. One man was tall and solidly built, tattoos across his face and neck. The other man was Sherlock’s height, had a long scar across his cheek, and visible outlines of two or three weapons on his person – a dagger, a cosh, and a studded bracer on his right wrist. Making up for his lack of brawn with weapons. On the whole, not a good combination – but Sherlock had an ace or two up his own sleeve.
John snorted in a laugh, but Maja’s face was expressionless as she slid a plate of food in front of him.
“No, of course not,” Sherlock said. He laughed softly, which made John look up – Sherlock sounded a bit nostalgic, a bit wistful. “When I was growing up, we had a cook, and I had a nanny who didn’t like the cook. If I wanted to get away, I’d go to the kitchen. She’d give me things to do, keep me out of her hair, and I think to twit Nanny too.”
Sherlock could see that her hands were shaking as she raised them to the rope to pull herself along. Her progress was not smooth, with the lumpiness of the homemade rope, but Sherlock had to admire her courage as she made her way across the gap.
) turned to meet them, smiling at Rosie. “Millie, this is Rosie and her dad, I found them in the wastelands. I think they could use a good meal.”
“I don’t believe he is in immediate danger, no. If Evans truly wanted him dead, he would be dead by now. So then I looked into the history of Mr. Nathan Garrideb – nothing of particular interest there. Then I checked the past ownership of the most peculiar house in which he lives, and sure enough, the previous owner was the murdered man, Roger Prescott.”
“Ah, cheers, I’m a bit bi myself,” I say, reaching over to shake his hand. “Welcome to the club. We have chocolate
“Those drones are just visuals, they can’t pick up what we’re saying from there,” he said calmly. “We are alone. You can drop the act now, I think.”
Before he could really contemplate what losing Bantam would mean, Jerome came barrelling out of nowhere, running straight into Bantam and sending him flying.
a disruption.” John wasn’t sure why he was insisting on this, it wasn’t the point he was trying to make.
“Lestrade, get some of your idiots over to Baker Street immediately,” Sherlock snapped into his mobile. “They let one of the forgers get away… yes, he’s here… yes, John has it under control. Get this moron out of our house.”
“Pavlović was on holiday in Prokuplje when he had a medical emergency. I was there doing some shopping with Maja. At the time, he was just a man in distress and I was a doctor who knew what to do. Afterwards I found out what a powerful man he was. I thought I’d blown it, but after a while it seemed that he genuinely didn’t know who I was, he was just grateful. That was two years ago. Then I get this call, asking me to care for a patient. Less than an hour later, an ambulance drove up and dumped you in my spare bedroom.
Knitting was an odd thing, Sherlock thought. He wondered how it had developed; thousands of years ago on Earth-that-was, he supposed. But who had taken two sticks and a piece of string and figured out how to manipulate them into a more or less solid object, which could then be made into a garment? Was it an accident? Had someone observed a spider weaving a web, and tried to duplicate it? Had someone figured out mathematically how to do it?
Sherlock followed, fully dressed and with an aloof expression a few minutes later. “I’ll take my time when I wish to,” he drawled.
“Excellent,” Holmes crowed. “I’ll just have the driver bring my things up.” And he dashed back down the stairs, leaving John and Mrs. Hudson to gaze at each other in wonder.
“Not at all,” John said, smiling. “It was very educational. Your hospital is the marvel of the age.”
Grief and frustration transmogrified into fury. He picked up the cold cup of tea beside him and threw it with a snarl at his map pinned to the wall. The cup was followed by a stack of papers, which fluttered against the wall and gave him no satisfaction. He threw books, pictures, plates. He saw Mrs. Hudson peer cautiously from the door, but she vanished when he pitched his tea set at the wall. He shouted every crude word he knew until his throat was sore.
“Nope, nothin’ like that. Purple puke and plays. Never seen the like. What was it he was shoutin’?” John assumed a dramatic pose, even as he sprawled in the chair. “’Amanda! I wanted to be the Romeo you deserved!’”
It was dawn before he was satisfied. Then he ripped the picture out of the notebook and folded it up carefully, put it in his coat pocket.
John came running to Sherlock one day, his eyes wide and wet, and yanked him away from his attempts to organize the sheet music in the choral loft. He said nothing as Sherlock stumbled after him to the infirmary; then Sherlock stumbled again as he looked down at Mycroft, ragged and filthy and curled into a ball on a cot.
“Hey,” John said. He reached out and pulled Sherlock’s hands away. “It was worth it, okay? Worth it to know you and…” He stopped and swallowed hard. “At one point, they left me alone, got distracted with messages from Pavlović. And I was looking at all the screens with the surveillance cameras. Most of them were of the flat and the pavement outside, but one of them was moving, like a bodycam. And then I saw you.
The flight was uneventful. John thought that, short of a crash, all flights would be considered uneventful compared to their adrenaline-soaked trip from London to Victoria nearly six months ago: trying to remember his newly-given identity; Sherlock shaking and sweating under the shock of forced assimilation of his disparate personalities; John struggling to keep calm to avoid alerting the flight personnel to the distress.
The room was wallpapered floor to ceiling with a deep red flocked pattern, and a deep red shag rug covered the floor. Red velveteen curtains blocked out the view from the window. Pendant lamps hung in every corner. But the bed was the focus of the room, huge and round, with a similarly huge and round mirror suspended above it.
As John and Sherlock waited for the elevator, Greg threw out one more lifeline. “Again, really sorry about Riggs. Won’t happen again.”
“I’m just repeating what I’ve heard. You put your fingers in your ears and sing ‘You’re Simply the Best’.” Sherlock stared at him blankly. “Tina Turner? The American woman with the legs?”
Sherlock frowned at the screen; he’d dialled correctly, but instead of Lestrade’s tired face he saw a stranger, his face sharp with irritation.
“Um. Well, the Islands, the Beaches. But this big one, High Park, has a couple of them, it’s huge. They also have a Shakespeare play there every summer, at an outdoor theatre.”
Sherlock and John stood for a long moment, staring at the little girl as she played. Then Sherlock took a deep breath, and took John’s hand into his own.
Sherlock found his voice rising, all of the fear and frustration pouring out of him. “John, I am a detective. I solve crimes, mysteries. Then I turn it over to the law. The law, John, which doesn’t
She looked back to the television. “I really thought you wanted me,” she said, her eyes turned carefully away.
Gradually his heart rate returned to normal, and John was calming in his arms as well, with each of them twitching as their orgasms reverberated through their muscles. Hands which so recently scrabbled over skin now stroked gently, feather-light, over sensitized skin. Sherlock leaned down and found John’s lips with his own.
He swept off to his room, leaving John in doubt about whether Sherlock had been honoured or annoyed by the request.
“I will for the music I can’t play – the symphonic works, organ, choral, and so forth. Right now I’m focusing on sorting the violin solos.”
In the space of a blink, Sherlock had moved away and back onto his own chair. He produced a newspaper out of nowhere, tossed it to John, then picked up a book and began to read. John held the paper up, fortunately realizing it was upside down before Mrs. Hudson entered the room.
Sherlock maintained a network of people in the streets of Persephone City, people which Mycroft sneeringly referred to as Sherlock’s Irregulars. They were infinitely useful, however, and could give him the edge of information that could solve a case, information which the police could not possibly get. All for the sake of a few credits passed between hands.
Georgie began to speak again. His first words were, “Rosie play?” His family was never found, but Delia and her husband adopted him.
Sherlock shifted a little closer to the back of the sofa, just to get marginally closer to John. “You’re a fascinating man, John,” he said. “I’m glad it was your spare bedroom they dumped me in.”
Hunger he was accustomed to. He used to believe that hunger sharpened his senses, but now hunger passed beyond that point to a dull ache that spread through his body. But it was thirst that impeded him the most. He found himself obsessing over every half glass of water he had left behind in a restaurant, every cup of cold tea he had thrown down the drain, every drop from the tap as he brushed his teeth. He imagined himself desiccating from the inside out. But what water they found, he had Rosie drink her fill first before he allowed himself to dampen his tongue.
She made her way quickly and efficiently through the crowds in the store. After so many years working at Harrod’s, she was still taken aback every year by the number of people who seemed to be surprised at the inevitability of December 25, and who decided to do all their shopping the day before. It was Bernie’s first year, and she wasn’t yet accustomed to the kind of stress that shoppers like that put themselves under, then flipped out with the least provocation.
“Now is very okay,” I say. We sit at a table. They sit next to each other as though the distance of a table between them is just too much to handle. I sit across from them and I need fucking sunglasses for the light coming off them. I can’t help grinning at them.
He found himself pacing in the alleyway for the last fifteen minutes before midnight, watching anxiously for the glitter of the net opening. Just as Big Ben boomed the last stroke of twelve, he saw it; he grinned and strode through.
However, two days was still two days. He wondered if Sherlock would finish the experiment he had started before this whole mess, or if he would just watch some telly and then go to bed.
John looked over in the same direction that the crew were looking, and his breath stopped. A figure in black was walking – no, half running – from the backstage up the far right side of the amphitheatre. John noted the slumped shoulders, the lumbering gait, and knew that he had found their thief.
“Very much all right,” John panted. He opened his eyes and stroked Sherlock’s hair with a hand that had no strength. “I ain’t never come that fast since the very first time I was with a girl, and I was fifteen. That was amazin’.”
Just as he approached the address Holmes had given him, a hansom cab drew up and Holmes himself leapt out. “Ah, Doctor Watson, there you are. I like punctuality in a medical man. Stay a moment, driver. Come on, let’s ring up our landlady and housekeeper, Mrs. Hudson.”
“I do hope you are right, Mr. Holmes. Five million dollars! Think of the things I could acquire with those funds! My collection would be the envy of the world!”
Before the elevator began to wheeze its way back down to the lobby, Sherlock darted to the main window of the sitting room. He stood to the side of the window casing and looked out at the street below. Two cars sat in the street, in easy sight from the window – and to the window, Sherlock realized. The cars were positioned in such a way that no movement from the window would go unseen.
“No,” he said, slowly, and then more firmly, “No. He didn’t tease when he caught me with the fruit bowl. Perhaps he was being polite.”
Engineers from Scotland arrived and set to work to repair the infrastructure of the city. They initially said that bringing running water to the cathedral again would take at least a month, but were successful in only three weeks. John found this very funny, but could not explain it to Sherlock aside from saying, “Well, there was a television show when I was a kid and – oh, never mind.”
Cameras popped, reporters shouted questions, the ambassador smiled. Below it all, he heard Mrs. Hudson saying frantically to the ambassador, “Something’s wrong. Open the gate, open the gate
It was a terrific case. Sherlock investigated the first body, then as he whirled around to move to the second one, John swooped in for his own investigation. Later, in an alley with the murderer trapped in a corner, Sherlock dropped at the precise moment that John aimed his gun, then took advantage of the suspect’s surprise to kick his legs out from under him. John immediately was on the man’s back, pinning him down, just in time for Sherlock to grab John’s dropped gun and hide it in his coat before Lestrade came around the corner.
“Too long by half,” Sherlock muttered. “Earl Grey please, not that disgusting natural oolong please. And biscuits.”
I’ve never heard of a flatmate who interrupts dates, or answers texts for someone. You’re not big on boundaries, are you?
Sherlock sat in a large chair, whose twin sat opposite a small table. A servant came and placed a tea tray on the table, and Sherlock instinctively reached for it.
“Like this?” John said. “Can I fuck you like this? I want to see your face. I want to see you as I fuck you, want to make you scream out.”
“I mean, if I were to consent to be kissed, would you do so again? Or, perhaps,” and Holmes moved swiftly to the divan, sitting beside John, “perhaps I should say; Doctor Watson, may I kiss you?”
As they followed him, John looked around the house. No castle by any definition, but it was a grand house. Clearly the Cubitt family was an old family of the area, with many generations of money showing in the heavy, dark furniture and rich tapestries. Stuffed heads of animals were on the walls, and even though John knew this was a common decoration of the era, he still found them slightly alarming. But all was dusted and clean and well cared for – Mrs. Cubitt had obviously kept her husband’s house in good order.
“You’re faster than you look,” Sherlock said to the big man, as he felt his arms being pinned behind his back.
I look at Sherlock, who’s fiddling with the condensation on a table. Making circles in the water. I see a glimmer of something there; something familiar. Sad. Regretful. And – something else.
He spoke for over an hour, with occasional breaks for rest and sips of water. Mrs. Hudson’s hand rested on his the whole time, patting it at intervals. Sherlock was frustrated at his low energy, but was determined to get the story on record.
She put the tray down and sat on the armchair opposite him. She watched him work for a few minutes in silence.
They motored through men’s accessories, leaving shoppers behind in their wake. “I would advise against pants as a gift, unless they’re racy, but we don’t carry that kind of stuff anyway. Socks, absolutely not, unless as an add-on. Same with any appliance, unless - who does most of the cooking?”
“Hello Rosie, welcome,” the cook said. Sherlock liked that she was talking to Rosie, as though Rosie would talk back. “Give me a mo’ to dish something out for you. We’ve not much but we do our best.”
Tjinn looked weary and unkempt, her hair loose around her face instead of elegantly pulled back. She was looking at him but turned slightly away from the screen. “I’m all right, Sherlock,” she said, her voice exhausted. “Are you? Were you hurt?”
“An extraordinary story indeed,” Holmes said. “Extraordinary… and a falsehood from beginning to end. I have never seen such a collection of lies told in my presence.”
“No, but there’s only six in the world. Very rare. Pure gold, or at least as pure as it can be – like 999.99/1000 pure. It was on display in our minerals and gems gallery. We’ve roped off the area, so no one’s been in there since the theft was discovered last night. Here we are.”
Sherlock’s mind was white and buzzing. “You think I don’t want to go home as well?” he said quietly.
Sherlock grumbled something that sounded rather like, “What’s the point then,” but rose nonetheless. He moved with his habitual grace, but slowly and with a kind of care that reminded John that he was not yet completely free of pain.
For a moment, John had trouble remembering how to breathe. Sherlock was not normally a modest man, given his tendency for walking around in a sheet – though John suddenly realized that he hadn’t seen Sherlock do that since before his ‘death’. But now Sherlock was fully naked before him; thin and muscled, his long arms, legs and neck open to John’s eyes. His penis hung softly between his legs. Despite the strength evident in the breadth of Sherlock’s shoulders and the lean muscles in his thighs, all John could see was vulnerability. His eyes were drawn like magnets to the bullet hole scar on Sherlock’s chest; round, silvered and so innocuous, as if it had never been gushing blood, as if it had never caused Sherlock’s heart to stop. Sherlock’s stomach was trembling as he breathed.
“Yes,” Sherlock said, as though he were surprised by his own answer. “I had thought that this would be – terribly awkward. But now that I am here, and you are so close, I find myself at ease – well, in certain respects.”
The song ended almost abruptly, and Sherlock wouldn’t admit it but found himself wanting more. “Interesting rhythmic changes,” he said, instead.
His voice is clear and crisp but not angry, even though the words are. I realize like a gut punch that he knows exactly what I’m talking about. I look up and I see Boo, and she’s nodding with a sad smile on her face. I sit down, and Sherlock and I just sit together in silence for a long time.
Pure terror crosses Sherlock’s face. “Nonsense, you don’t need me around.” He actually pulls out his wallet, hands John a fifty pound note. “Off you go, my treat.”
“Would you shut up!” Sherlock growls. He starts to stride towards the door; he’s got long legs but fortunately John is faster and grabs his arm before he gets out.
The piece was in its emotional climax now. Alone again on the stage, Sherlock embodied the young man’s indecision and agony, throwing chairs, dragging the heavy table across the room, throwing himself to the ground. Then he froze, and allowed the audience to see the terrible decision being made.
Sherlock groaned, and the sound reignited the fire under John’s skin. He began to kiss Sherlock everywhere he could reach – neck, mouth, cheek, chest. Sherlock’s hands became frantic, running over John’s back, his nape, and after a brief hesitation, his arse. John could definitely feel Sherlock’s hardness now, twitching and leaking against John’s hip. Though it was half killing him to move slowly, John’s fingers crept down Sherlock’s body, tracing his waist and hip, watching his face constantly. He moved deliberately, so Sherlock could anticipate what he was doing and where he was going, give him the opportunity to stop John if he wanted.  Sherlock was huffing for breath, but John saw him nodding jerkily, and realized that he was saying, “Ye – ye – ye,” unable to complete the word.
The car was large enough that they could all fit fairly comfortably for the long ride. John and Maja looked out of opposite windows. Sherlock closed his eyes as though sleeping, but was actually reviewing the map of Belgrade in his head.
“There,” Bahdri said.  “Get dressed, something clean if you’re able to find anything in this cesspool. And brush your teeth for God’s sake. Hurry.”
John shook his head. “You got another hefty dose of the Baskerville gases in Dewer’s Hollow, I think, plus a shot of adrenaline when the land mine went off. So you’re back under the influence of the stuff. Just hold tight and we’ll be back in the room soon.”
“The station-master,” Holmes said, and strode purposefully into the building. They quickly found him, an older man bent under with age and extraordinary sideburns.
In that moment, he made a promise to himself and to John. He would not allow John’s sacrifice to be made in vain. He would protect Maja and the baby inside her, he would get them to safety, he would take care of them. The situation had reversed, he realized. Now it was Maja beside him, not John, but he would get them out and use Mycroft’s influence to get John out after the fact.
“Ah, but Holmes,” John said. “Without your efforts, Mrs. Cubitt would be hanged unjustly for the murder of her husband. Mr. Cubitt would not have wanted that for his wife.”
It took John a moment to react to the open door, to focus on Sherlock standing there. His eyes widened in shock and he went deadly pale.
John entered and strode up to Sherlock in his chair, his face lined and dark. “Explain this to me, please,” he said without preamble. “Personal Companion.”
beat out of him, I said to myself, ‘Well, a good fight would go down well too,’ and not one hour later I find myself breaking into the Poli-Station lookin’ for lost teeth.”
She shrugged. “You took me to the art gallery and bought me lunch.” She laughed softly. “It was a nice day, wasn’t it?”
He gasped in pain, feeling the warm wet of fresh blood trickle down his side. “Oh, is that where I hit you?” Maja said. “Nothing too permanent, I hope. Not that it matters, really.”
Sherlock frowned – his worlds were colliding again. He would have preferred to be in what he thought of as his detective clothes; the denim and cotton in plain colours would help him fade away. Now, however, dressed in black tie and tails, he was more prominent, more recognizable. No matter.
John swallowed hard to keep from vomiting. He grabbed Sherlock by the shoulders and forced him to look John in the eye. “Don’t do that. That’s manipulating me, Sherlock, and I won’t stand for it. And it’s not necessary. You said I owe you nothing, that’s not true – I owe you everything. I’m not leaving you, not ever. Even if the police knocked on the door this moment, I wouldn’t leave you. All right?”
“What I want is to find someone to share my life with who is my equal in intelligence, in ingenuity, in curiosity. I’ve been looking all over the universe for someone like that, and I had just about given up. Then I saw you on the newsvidders about that case at the theatre.
He could hear traffic noises on Baker Street and Marylebone. He could hear the faint, inane voices of Rosie’s telly program. He could hear a ticking noise in his head, keeping time. He tuned them all out, listening for the click of the tumblers giving way.
“I know, Mummy,” Sherlock said. His eyes flickered to Mycroft, sitting beside Mrs Holmes, and Mycroft gave a small nod.
John turned his thoughts to Slade’s arrest. Thank goodness it had gone smoothly, the man manacled and giving up the fight immediately. He remembered Hope’s arrest and how it had so nearly gone south, charging at Holmes like that. What if Slade had been suspicious of the note he thought to be from Elsie Cubitt? What if he had brought his gun, and had had it loaded and ready to fire when he arrived? What if Holmes had been in the line of fire?
At one point, Molly noticed that John and Sherlock were standing in the middle of the room holding hands, and let out a squeak that brought any remaining efforts at judging to an end. There was more champagne, many toasts to the new couple, and several slightly teary hugs from each of the judges.
He carefully stepped over the mounds of stone, twisted rebar, and rubble and walked around the grounds of England’s centre of political power, looking for any signs of life. All he found was a CCTV camera, misshapen and scratched, its lens shattered.
The young man he was portraying was supposed to be an artist, tormented by thoughts of death. He is visited by a beautiful woman, who tempts him, taunts him, and then spurns him, and encourages him to commit suicide. A modernist romantic tragedy. But the story didn’t matter to Sherlock; it never mattered to him. All that mattered was the dance.
“Captain Pavlović thought that, did he.” Sherlock said. He crossed his arms over his chest, ignoring the pain it caused his ribs. “And how exactly do you know Captain Pavlović?”
John just nodded. “Enough about me,” he said shortly. “You’re the star around here. Tell me about yourself.”
John put down his pen and quickly hid his journal. Victorian sensibilities were generally towards respecting people’s privacy, but he also got the sense that Holmes didn’t necessarily align with Victorian sensibilities. He could already hear Holmes thundering up the stairs to hisroom, and Holmes’ voice was filled with an energy that John’s hadn’t heard since the Hope case concluded.
Sherlock sat back, stunned. He had always known she carried a secret, but had no idea what it had been. “You never told me that,
“I have to-” John stopped himself, realizing that he was about to blurt out the truth. He couldn’t say he needed to go back because he’d fallen in love; that was against every rule in the department. He’d not only never be let near a lab again, they’d throw him out of Oxford. “I have to finish,” he said lamely.
" He pulled aside a tapestry to reveal a vidder system built into the wall, pressed a button and threw himself into a chair. He sighed again as Mycroft’s face appeared on the screen.
Eventually I tell him that I’ve got to close up the café, and he asks if we can exchange numbers. I like this. If he’s got my number and I don’t have his, all the power is with him to make the initiative. If I have his and he doesn’t have mine, he looks like a lazy slob that won’t make the first move to call after the prescribed number of hours/days. If we both have each other’s numbers, it’s more equal. Of course, it could end up with both of us trying to figure out when is appropriate, and then neither of us do it, and then it’s a stalemate.
Sherlock’s face was a combination of disgust, horror, and disbelief. “Well, that doesn’t help my phobia
is a modern ballet, and Roland Petit’s choreography reflected the modernist style of the mid-forties: sharp, jarring movements, off the standard beat of the music. If dance were music, this choreography would be atonal, but the music was Bach’s
“You work at the Poli-Station?” John said as they moved quickly through the throng of people in the lobby of the station.
making them harsh and rough. John’s teeth clamped down on Sherlock’s already swollen bottom lip, nearly hard enough to draw blood, and Sherlock felt an electric charge of arousal slam through his muscles. He pulled John into the cage of his limbs, pulling at him so hard he was sure he left scratch marks on his back.
Then the screen shuddered and went blank, the ship’s flight smoothed, daylight winked out, and stars spread out before the windows, more stars than Sherlock had ever seen before.
“It will take some work, no doubt,” Holmes replied. “Mr. John Garrideb told us of his… exhaustive efforts in America. Perhaps we can do better here in England.”
He turned the next corner, and there it was, the embassy, with the Union Jack already flying. He found himself grinning and he quickened his pace.
is the Latin, though these lions look nicer than a real one. Now, a little snack, I think, yes? I always sleep very well after eating something. After a case is solved, of course.”
The darkness inside the shed was total, and John fumbled for the small torch he always carried with him. He had expected to see Sherlock crouched in a corner, or perhaps standing imperiously waiting for John to arrive, but he saw nothing but clutter – thrones, boxes, a fake deer which startled John badly, tools, brooms, and, most bizarrely, a wooden coffin.
Sherlock slips his foot into the loop, tests its strength with his weight. “Okay, come on now, John,” he says. He pushes John’s foot into the loop, on top of his own foot, and pulls John in close to him. “Greg!” he shouts up, and the word bounces around the walls of the well. “Got him! Pull!”
Sherlock’s skin rippled up into gooseflesh, from John’s intensity and his proximity. He saw John’s skin responding in turn, saw his eyes dilate. He suddenly wanted to pull John even closer.
Sherlock took a deep breath and tried to compose himself. He really shouldn’t let his brother get under his skin. “No. I made it up to her.” He had bribed his way into her flat the next morning and woken her with champagne, flowery apologies, and a few techniques he had perfected over the years.
Sherlock shrugged. “You can tell more about the person, and about the era they lived in. You can learn more from their clothes, the way they hold their body, what they are doing with their hands, the expression on their face. I look at a landscape and think, ‘Ah, look. A tree’.”
While Rosie slept, unaware of the change in her environment, Sherlock took the gun from the rucksack, loaded it, and tucked it into the back of his trousers.
John nodded and smiled, then stood and took off his own clothes. He took his time; no first-time desperation now, not even the usual post-case adrenaline. Shirt, trousers, socks, and pants one by one came off and puddled on the floor, John gradually revealing his body as if to say, ‘You are the only person I can be vulnerable with, just as I am the only person for you.’
On instinct, he meowed, low and plaintive. The guards muttered to themselves, then quieted as they returned to their game.
John glared, but it wasn’t heartfelt, and there was a little smile hidden behind the glare. “Are you sure? Nothing on today?”
The final challenge fell on Christmas Eve, and Mrs Hudson had decorated the flat with fairy lights and tinsel and greenery. John and Sherlock stood side by side again, as though on parade rest in front of the judges. They were both repressing smiles, trying to keep a multitude of secrets inside them.
Jim doubled back with his queen. “At first, it was whatever would make the most money. Now, I invest less often, but the concept has to be innovative. Like the oolong.”
“Yes, sir. So Mr. Holmes insisted on leaving, and Detective Inspector Riggs insisted on the paperwork being completed first, and Mr. Holmes refused, and…”
He dashed down the stairs to Mrs. Hudson’s flat, and knocked. He barely kept himself from drumming a tattoo on the door.
“But here you are. Here we are. Despite all that’s happened. Despite – all I’ve done. I don’t deserve this. Or you.”
Sherlock looked like he was considering it as a more favourable option, but John was not going to pass up the opportunity to sleep in the tackiest hotel room in England. “You said there was an ensuite? With a bath?”
Sherlock had a fine sheen of sweat over his body, and felt better than he had in ages. John had been playing his role well, mocking Sherlock’s every move, but Sherlock noticed that every trace of John’s limp had disappeared. He had a feeling that the cane would be left behind, either in the studio or at the hotel, before the end of the week.
John put his grocery bags down; this could take a while and his hands were starting to hurt. “I actually have heard a couple cures, they seem to work.”
He’s sitting in a chair by a fireplace, his priest’s collar on but his hair’s rumpled like he’s been gripping at it. His face slides from surprise into embarrassment, with a shade of a smile, like he’s actually glad to see me, then finally into sadness.
The dust clears from the metaphorical piano I’ve thrown in the middle of the room, and Sherlock is blinking rapidly. John shakes his head a little, his expression a little sad.
“I still can’t believe this is real,” John murmured as he kissed along Sherlock’s jaw. “Like a dream.”
Sherlock closed his eyes and came. He was dimly aware of John mouthing, “Yes yes yes,” but blissfully let himself drown in the pleasure.
“Naw, thanks. Gotta work in a few hours. Also I’m intrigued. Will it taste better like this, as opposed to the way I make it?”
Holmes paused for a millisecond, a hiccup in his thought pattern, then recovered as though nothing had happened. “You are kind, Watson, and I thank you. But it’s grotesquely obvious to anyone who cares to observe. Now, I think that we should pay our client a visit, and see what we can learn from him.”
“Perhaps I should run through my barre routine, and you can critique my form?” He bent his knees in a plié, but deliberately wobbly, as a child might. “Oh dear, it has been a while.”
“She was getting frail, you know. When I arrived I was shocked to see her, but you know how when she smiles the years just drop away? So I thought… but last night-”
John nodded at him minutely. Sherlock reached out, put his hand on John’s warm shoulder and pushed him.
John laughed and hugged Sherlock a little closer. “They’re fascinating creatures, actually, Sherlock. Quite intelligent. They have evidence of octopus solving simple puzzles. In fact-”
There was a moment of absolute stillness: Holmes smiling with pride at John, and John and the other two men, and the cabbie, staring in shock.
Inara graciously tilted her head, and sat back with a sigh of relief as Sherlock warmed the pot. “You’ve grown into your beauty,
The gates clanged shut behind them. Sherlock was carried along in the tide of the reporters and diplomats through the courtyard and into the doors of the embassy itself. He was dimly aware of questions being shouted at them; he answered without thinking, mostly “Yes” and “Glad to be home”. All the while, Mrs. Hudson was beside him, never letting go of him, a bundle of material of his jacket crammed in her fist.
John stumbled off balance, exaggerating his reaction. “Are you fucking kidding me?” he shouted. “You’re a fucking menace!”
“Hungover. I’m happy to do it, John. Just call me first next time, then you don’t have to pay a sitter with a drinking problem and halitosis to boot.”
The beans scattered across the toasted bread, with a few, dribbling with sauce, having fallen off the toast and onto the plate. John had not had time to shop, with the Moriarty trial and its subsequent outcomes. He was too jittery to order takeaway. So he had made do with what there was in the cupboards.
Moira stood for a moment, shocked by the experience as a whole and by the realization that she was about to get about two months worth of wages in commission, with a single sale. She took a deep breath and lifted her walkie-talkie.
Walking was harder than he had thought it would be. It was impossible to distinguish between the pavement and the street, with rubble covering both indiscriminately. Thin soled shoes were helpful on crime scenes, allowing him to feel differences in surfaces under his feet, but now he cursed them. Soon he stopped caring about the dust that covered them. Whitehall would normally be about an hour’s walk from Baker Street, less if he was in a proper strop. He realized that this was going to take much, much more time than that.
“I know you, Sherlock Holmes. You were going to leave – let me guess, sneak out in the middle of the night, just like you’ve done before. Leave Rosie and me. Again.”
John and Sherlock nodded. This was a little more of a challenge than either of them was expecting, and were each wondering whether they should have backed out of this whole thing.
, John thought. Sherlock tended to sleep only periodically on a case, but he knew for himself that between the flight, the time change, and a new case, this was going to be a long day. “Is coffee nearby?”
“So who could have done it? Could have been a man or a woman.” Sherlock glanced over the assembled cast. “Someone old,” he said, waving at Lord Capulet, “or someone young,” with a dismissive gesture at a boy, barely out of his teens, who had played Peter. “I’ll get to motivation in a moment. Now, who had opportunity?”
“Mmm,” Sherlock said. He was back at the kitchen table, working at the microscope. He didn’t look up.
“I have five grandchildren, I understand. Challenge yourself next – try drawing someone while they’re moving, going about their day. Capture their sense of movement. All right? Now, I also like this one of your – mother?”
Mrs. Hudson, brilliant Mrs. Hudson, immediately raised her voice. “Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Holmes would be pleased to do a formal press conference later in the day, but right now he requires some rest – he is still recuperating. Thank you. Thank you.”
Even when Sherlock had left, it had been too late to call someone to stay with Rosie and let John go with him. But perhaps this was better; better to leave all this tension, all this – change – leave it here in the Baker Street sitting room, to be picked up again when Sherlock returned.
It did take a while, but crime waits for no man to organize his mind palace. The McEwen gang struck again, this time hitting one of the largest banks in the city, in broad daylight.
His rush to bring everything downstairs to the flat at 221C had created an untidy pile of cans, boxes, and bags. He was beginning to sort it and stack it neatly when he heard a sigh from behind him.
“That’s all I am,” Sherlock said firmly. “I failed Rosie, but she’s got you now. She’s safe here, she’ll be fed and happy, all those things I couldn’t do for her. She doesn’t need me any more.”
“I am indeed, Mr. Holmes, but I believe we had agreed that you would speak to me or at least forward a message when you planned to use our facilities here?”
Sherlock was still hesitating, staying as far from the bed as he could, almost clinging to the textured walls. “I’m not sure I can sleep in here, John. It’s too
Nothing could have prepared me for the reception of this fic. I wrote it during difficult days of the pandemic, needing to get the story out of my head; I published it thinking that it would be politely received, that people wouldn't want to read about bombs and dark days. And then readers started commenting, reaching out, thanking me - still bewildered by that!
He could hear the hurried whispers of the dancers as they ground their feet into the resin box, could hear the orchestra tuning to A.
“That’s not a bribe, John. I’d recommend you whether you went or not. But that’s one of the qualities I like about you – you’ll always do a favour for someone, even when you don’t want to.”
John shrugged and ambled over to Sherlock. It wasn’t like Lestrade to be taken aback by Sherlock’s behaviour; like John, he had become inured to his eccentricities. As he approached, he caught sight of Donovan, who was working on the other side of the vault – her eyes were wide as saucers. He frowned at her, and then he heard it:
He imagined John standing in the sitting room, exactly as he had left him, as though in a movie that he had paused. He tried to concentrate on the evidence, but navy blue eyes kept appearing in his imagination, sparking with life and something he had never seen before. He wanted to curl up in the midnight of those eyes; if he could rest, he could rest there.
Then Sherlock strode over to John. John turned a page in his notebook, anticipating that Sherlock was about to ask him for his medical opinion, which he suspected was sought because Sherlock needed to stall for time to think.
Sherlock could gauge John’s pain levels by the topography of his mouth – or rather, by the lack of topography: John’s mouth was a flat, lipless line. He had allowed Sherlock to assist him up the stairs of 221B, but there was a silence from him that echoed up and down the flat.
He’s wandering around, looking at all the pictures of the guinea pigs with this little half smile on his face. He’s either genuinely amused, or he’s checking for emergency exits. He must hear my fetching smile, because he comes over to the cash. I’m standing there in my pinny and trying to look helpful and ‘come hither’ and ‘don’t fuck with me’ all at once.
They sat together for a long time, John feeling Sherlock’s muscles tremble, feeling his own shock leak out of his body. Sherlock finally gave a deep sigh, and the last of the shudders dropped away from him. John let him sit up, and looked at him with a smile to cement the reassurance – but something was wrong. Sherlock’s face was set in a way that wasn’t like anything John had seen before. It was serious, but none of his earlier distress was evident.
John’s eyes went soft. “And you are mine,” he said. “And our next miracle, God willing, will be in our bed.”
He stripped off his shirt and laid it on the bench. He was wearing a white singlet, just as he had been when Sherlock had walked in on him tap dancing. Sherlock abruptly recognized that there was more discovered that day than just the realization that John could dance.
“In an alleyway near St. Paul’s, Carter Lane,” Bahdri said. “Pre-dawn, I’m afraid, but that’s all I could do to avoid a divergence or a contemp witnessing. Hard to find a quiet place in London in 1895, even in April.”
John stood still for a moment, letting his eyes adjust from the bright lights of the Balliol lab to the deep darkness of an alleyway in London at 4:20am, April 14, 1895.
As he struggled to open his eyes, his memory rushed back with images of the plane, and that they had made an emergency landing in Serbia. And that could mean a lot of trouble for Sherlock, depending on where exactly he was. If only he could open his eyes he could figure it out.
“No. Pavlović probably heard the recording and thought you two were going to try to kill each other. The poker John took from the fireplace last night, you see. When you pushed him, and he took it as protection. Pavlović was likely coming to call the whole thing off. He’s probably working John over right now, you know.” She said it so casually, so matter of fact, and Sherlock shuddered inwardly. “And it’s time to end this whole debacle. So. The name of your contact here, please.”
They were silent as they went down the elevator, but Sherlock saw John glance at the surveillance screens in the lobby side room as they passed. His facial expression never changed.
Mrs. Hudson heads downstairs and John locks up. Sherlock has already settled at the kitchen table with some terrifying-looking experiment. “All right love?” John says.
John pulled the jacket back on and glared at Waters, while trying to remember what he had done three months earlier. “At home. I think.”
Jim looked up at Sherlock, his eyes serious and clear. “None like you,” Jim answered. “Even though we haven’t met until today, I felt a – a connection to you. There were just so many-” Jim paused, then stood. “Let me show you something? Please?”
John pulled him into a float, with John behind and underneath him. Sherlock leaned back, his head resting on John’s collarbone, and allowed his breath to even out, his heart to stop hammering. John maintained a constant stream of alternating reassurances and insults as he treaded water, keeping them both afloat.
The case was still on his mind, however. He had been working on it in every spare moment for two weeks now. He had kept his appointments, but the moment the door closed on his satisfied and sated client, he would rush to his private rooms and pick up where he had left off. It was fascinating work. Until now Sherlock had not dwelt upon a case after it was solved; now he was reviewing every case he could remember to see if he could spot the elusive silvery thread connecting them. He had forbidden Mrs. Hudson from cleaning those rooms, for fear of her disturbing a potential solution hidden amongst papers, tablets, notes, and maps. There had to be something there. There had to be.
Righteous fury rose up in John’s chest and began to pour into his head and mouth. “Are you telling me,” he said in a calm, flat voice that had frightened nurses and corporals, “that you conducted chemical experiments in the bath and didn’t clean it after?”
Holmes wrapped his cloak even more tightly around himself, and curled himself inward and towards the window. This signalled the beginning of another depressive episode, John was sure, but he found himself far from irritated. He looked over at Holmes with wry amusement, then turned to his own thoughts.
“I very much doubt that.” There was no way he would tell Sherlock that his teacher had mistaken him for a professional model. There’d be no living with the vain git.
He opened the door to reveal a huge room, cozy with carpets and wooden tables and comfortable chairs. Sherlock couldn’t help his jaw dropping at the sight – the room was lined from  floor to ceiling with shelves of books. Ladders arched up to allow access to the highest shelves. At the far side of the room, he could see a man sorting through a large pile of books; the man glanced at Jim and Sherlock, and discreetly left through a hidden door.
It was nearly nine in the evening before Bahdri finally picked up. He looked exhausted, as tired as T.J. had looked when John had come through.
Sherlock looks like he’s going to fall down, and nobody moves for ages. Then his head jerks into a nod, then smooths out; he keeps nodding as John smiles.
“Oh. I. Um.” He stumbles for a second, trying to remember the script before coming back online. It’s adorable. Oh my God. I have to be careful. “Is this your place?”
The car came to a stop nearly directly below John. The startled guards abandoned their chess game, and one of them opened the door. To Sherlock’s horror, Pavlović stepped out of the car, saying some sharp words in Serb to the guards. Then he strode purposefully to the entrance, the guards half-running behind him.
Sherlock recounted his own flight through the park, and the tense standoff at the gate of the embassy. John was quiet while Sherlock told the story, and quiet for a long moment when he finished.
John shrugged and was just about to start the microwave when Sherlock burst out, “Microwaves have an irregular heat pattern which could disrupt the chemistry in the chocolate. Make it gluey. This is good quality chocolate – it would be ruined.”
Mrs. Hudson was squinting at the three of them, and the ambassador was whispering to her. They were still a good twenty feet away, and Sherlock knew they had to confirm his identity before they could open the gate. He had to get closer. Sherlock kept walking.
“As a matter of fact, I did,” Sherlock said. His mouth quirked up a bit at the memory of the fight in the alley, at a short stocky man facing down a man twice his size. He sat down at his desk and pulled a square piece of paper from a drawer. “Don’t wash it,” he said, remembering John’s words about his clothes betraying his wealth, and John’s own worn but neat clothes.
“Sit down now, there. Mustn’t put pressure on the stitches. I suppose this is a lot of food but we can wrap it up for lunch tomorrow. I told Lestrade to not call with any cases for a few days until you’ve had a chance to-”
Sherlock had always preferred to be clean shaven, but obviously the current circumstances did not allow for personal grooming. His beard came in, scraggly and embarrassingly ginger. Rosie was fascinated by it and would stroke his face as he read to her. He would tolerate it for a minute or two, then tickle her with his chin until she giggled and stopped.
John sat and watched, a small smile on his face, then pulled one of the dishes towards him. “You made all this yourself?”
seem to enjoy it so much. Also their reactions are fantastic. Lately I’ve been deliberately picking dates with the greatest wank/hilarity ratio potential. I suspect that Sherlock knows this but is staying mum.
They stopped short at the sight of Maja in the middle of the sitting room, her eyes filling with tears.
John nodded his thanks, then pressed his lips together. “I don’t get much opportunity to dance, at home.”
John mentally shook his head at Dunworthy, having seen him worry himself sick over every drop. “It’s Victorian London,” he said. “How dangerous could it be?”
How Sherlock knew John wasn’t carrying his gun without actually looking at John, he would never know. “I don’t need it, Sherlock,” he said. “I’ll be perfectly safe.”
He sighed. This wasn’t the script he had planned for her, and she was a new and important client. But the case was calling him too, and a murder had been attempted in front of hundreds of people.
But the fairy lights still glittered over the mantle, and the lamp was on, illuminating a lump on the sofa – a lump of oatmeal jumper and denim that was snoring slightly.
John’s hand darted down and grabbed Benvolio by the wrist and held it up, showing to all the purple stains on his fingertips.
John puts his head down and snorts, then lets out a string of giggles that gets me going too. Sherlock tries to look all superior and aloof, but I see his smile twisting despite himself.
They were walking to Regent’s Park, John on Rosie’s right, holding her hand, and Sherlock on her other side. Every ten paces or so, Rosie would shout, “One! Two! Three!” and John and Sherlock would swing her between them, making her screech with delight.
“As in, we didn’t quite break our teeth on it,” Lestrade offered helpfully. Molly giggled behind her hand.
“I placed the order from the hospital. Were you able to keep your bandage dry? Does it need to be changed? Let me get some plates. I ordered the tikka masala, that’s your favourite, isn’t it? And there’s mutter pulao, with peas, you like peas. Here’s a fork. And-”
Then he turned and walked out of the bathroom, shouting, “And don’t use all the hot water again, you twat.”
– Office of the Artistic Director. Janina was sitting behind her desk, going through costume sketches.
Martin agreed and stepped out of the room, and John found paper and pen at the dead man’s desk. Holmes sat with the letters in front of him, and shortly had created a coded letter of his own, with dancing men relaying a short message. John understood the code well enough now to read its message: “Come at once.”
It took a moment, then her face registered with Sherlock. He remembered her ingratiating smile, her leaning on his arm, five years earlier.
He went up to his room, stripped off the offending trousers, and checked his leg. It was in fact superficial, though now that he was thinking about it, it stung a bit. He cleaned the wound and bandaged it, changing into his only other pair of trousers. All this was done with a silly smile on his face and a light, happy hum through his body.
John followed Holmes’ voice until he found him, transfixed by the sight of a sword resting on a long velvet pillow.
“Now what is this all about, Holmes?” Lestrade was saying. John had met him a few times, he seemed a good enough person but, like Gregson, was reluctant to acknowledge Holmes’ talents.
, Mycroft!” Sherlock said. “I want – I want-” He leaned in close to the screen. “Can you see me? Can you see my face clearly?”
He swallowed and deliberately put the thought away for later. “I love mince pies, Mrs. Hudson; I cannot wait to try yours.”
Sherlock took the spoon in hand. He paused for a moment over the bowl, then began to stir with a manic energy, and for much longer than his patience would normally allow. After a long moment, John laid his hand on Sherlock's shoulder. Sherlock jumped as though coming out of a trance.
“I want to make love to you,” John growled against Sherlock’s throat. “I want to undress you, and take my time to look over your whole body. I want to find out where the most sensitive parts of you are. I want to hear you moan, I want to make you scream. I want that, can I have that Sherlock? Let me do that.”
A second later John heard the sound of running footsteps, of the policemen calling to each other as they entered the alley.
Janina simply turned her head to look at the video of his dance, watching it for a brief moment. “You were always technically brilliant,” she said softly. “There was no step you couldn’t do, no jump you couldn’t accomplish. But this.” She waved at the television screen. “This. This is your soul, raw and laid bare in dance. I’ve never seen you dance like this. I’ve never seen anyone dance like this.”
He could hear the projected actors’ voices from the stage; through his panic the words drove into his mind as though whispered directly in his ear:
“Sort of.” John fiddled with the head of his cane. “My father didn’t – he didn’t think boys should dance. ‘Only faggots dance,’ he’d say. Boys should just play rugby and football and so forth. I played them, but kept going to films with Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire and Gregory Hines, that kind of thing.
Sherlock swallowed. He had danced in front of thousands of people, why was he suddenly bashful about this?
“Simple, my dear Doctor,” Holmes threw himself into his chair and began to count on his fingers. “First, while he is an American, he has not been in England only three months, for all his clothing is English made. No one would have done so unless they had been living here for some time. Second, I know no one by the name of Dr. Lysander Starr in Topeka, Kansas, or anywhere else on the face of this earth, so he does not hail from Kansas as he says. Third, there have been no notices or advertisements placed in the London papers – you know I read them especially for such curiosities. Fourth, and most clearly, his body language gave away his falsity at every turn: the fidgeting of his fingers, the slight sheen of perspiration, the increase in heart rate and blood pressure, which is obvious should you watch the carotid artery carefully, the darting motion of the eyes, particularly to the left. All signs of dissembling.”
As soon as John closed the door of their room behind them, Sherlock sat on the edge of bed with a small sigh. “I’m shattered, John.”
“Really?” The man looked over at the thug with interest, still motionless on the ground. “They kill someone?”
John blushed a little in sympathy with Sherlock as passers-by stared at the tall, handsome man in the expensive coat standing on the street, plugging his ears and singing a children’s song. Fortunately Sherlock was singing quietly, and not using his full baritone singing voice that John now knew he possessed.
“Clearly you do, Sherlock Holmes. You played me for a fool years ago, and you’re playing me for one now.”
John and Sherlock looked at each other and gave a sharp nod, then turned and went into the kitchen. Sherlock slid the pocket door closed and turned to John with the smile that made John’s heart race.
John contemplated Holmes for a moment. The man was now completely at ease, stretched out long and languorous in his chair; the opposite of the frenetic bundle of energy he had been throughout the case.
Greg laughed with a bit of relief. “Well, that wouldn’t be the first time. He and John have done that a few times on their own. Just give that room a wide berth for an hour or so, and Riggs can pay the cleaning bill.”
Sherlock lay back, letting the branches of the hedge support him, and tried to catch his breath. He wondered how long she would search the south end of the park before retracing her steps. He needed to get moving, but surely he could rest for just a moment.
Something hits him in the face, more solid than water but not hard like the rock walls around him. Something rough like –
“Okay,” John said. He took a deep breath, and said “Okay,” again. Then he walked over to Dunworthy and shook his hand. “Thank you,” he said. “You’ve taken a great risk here, for me.”
“I can’t imagine.” I try to imagine. I try to think of Boo strolling back into the café, putting on her pinny, and saying, ‘I hope you remembered to feed Hilary.’ Even imagining it puts my stomach into a deep churn.
His vidder pinged at one point, but it was just a group message from Lassiter to the history department, more or less repeating what he had said in the lab.
He asks me how I’ve been, how the café is going. Apologizes again about the movie. Tells me a bit about his daughter. Then he mentions that he and Sherlock had had a case earlier that week. So I ask him about it, and he talks about it for a solid fifteen minutes.
Sherlock pulls out his lock picking kit, selects the two largest tools, and shoves the rest into John’s shaking hands. “Hold that,” he says, and takes a huge gulp of air before ducking down into the water.
Nonetheless, that was the way Jean Cocteau had written the story, the way Roland Petit had choreographed it, and it was Sherlock’s duty to dance it to the best of his ability.
“Not offended. You’re right, it is quite different. Companions choose who they want to engage with. Prospective clients make a proposal on vidder, and I choose based on compatibility and interest.”
I stand up and take my pinny off. I look over the café and figure any cleaning can wait until tomorrow. I shut off the lights, and Sherlock holds open the door for me and John.
Sherlock remembered sitting on his grandfather's lap, the smell of his pipe. He stroked the watch, not able to look up.
“I tried to say, before,” John whispered against his mouth, his breath warm. “After we danced, I tried to say – you’re the most amazin’ man I ever met.”
She pondered what had happened since the horrible business with Sherlock’s sister. Sherlock had explained, in an unadorned but soft-spoken account, of how they had all been manipulated. And oh, it had hurt, but deep down she had known that Sherlock’s words weren’t truly from his heart. Just as she had known, deep down, from the moment she had seen John Watson in the same room as Sherlock, that Sherlock’s heart would never be hers.
He was aware of the police in the room staring at them curiously, but nothing existed for him except the body, the paper, the pencil, and the heat of Sherlock along his side. He kept expecting Sherlock to tell him to hurry up, but he stayed remarkably silent, despite shifting restlessly.
“We’re in luck,” Sherlock said. “Apparently there’s not just an ensuite, there’s a good sized tub as well. You can have a bath, warm up.”
“You had the guards take you away,” Sherlock breathed, not believing it even as he said it, “as if you were an innocent, hoping that it would spur John to action. And you could watch us better from a distance.”
This was so different from whatever John had expected that he was speechless, his mouth only framing around a ‘Wh’ sound – it could have been a ‘What?’ or ‘Why?’ or ‘When?’, but Sherlock plunged ahead.
If he asks for my number and then asks for a coffee, level one bastard. Coffee first, then number immediately after, level two bastard, e.g. ‘Cappuccino and your number, please.’
John stopped, and stood behind Benvolio. For the first time since entering the theatre, he looked up at Sherlock. They locked eyes for a moment, and Sherlock then spoke directly to John.
He crossed to the net, the small area curtained by a gauzy, metallic mesh that would open to the past and allow him through. As he moved, all the wool in his clothing rubbed against his skin afresh, and his irritation swept back tenfold.
There were no outward indicators of morning, afternoon, or night, so Sherlock relied heavily on his watch. He woke her at 8:00am and took care of the necessary ablutions with her – thank God for the loo in the flat. She insisted that the nappies were no longer necessary, she was a
Thank you to everyone who read, everyone who commented or kudos'ed. Many thanks to MissDavisWrites and PipMer for their beta work.
Sherlock sat down. He was tired now, and frustrated that his energy had failed him already. “I don’t know. I’ll think about it. A lot of it depends on…” He couldn’t finish the sentence.
He had not been a child who had played games, but now he invented games for her, suitable to their constricted space. Monkey in the Corner. Balance the Tins. Water Bottle Bowling. Anything to keep her engaged and moving, exercising her muscles and her brain. It was exhausting, and yet she seemed to have unlimited energy. He observed when her energy and mood rose and dipped during the day; when it correlated with hunger, with naps. Her naps were never long enough for Sherlock, who was amazed to learn he could be so busy and so bored at the same time.
His tone brooked no argument, and John surrendered the field for the moment, while resolving to watch him carefully.
“My dad left when I was twelve, and I always promised that if I ever… that I wouldn’t be a man that does that to their child.”
“I will never forget the silence at the table after my pronouncement. Then my father stood up, his face red with rage, and took me to the nursery and – well. He told me, in words and with his belt, that boys do not marry boys and I must remove such filthy thoughts from my head, now and forever.
I think if John knew Sherlock was sending me pictures of murder weapons by text, he’d murder Sherlock himself. I send one more text.
Sherlock stopped and held Maja by the shoulders. “He is going to be all right,” he said. He wondered which of them needed greater reassurance, but he held onto his own words as comfort. “He’s very clever, and when this is all over and he is with us again, you can ask him yourself.”
He filled his face with regret and promise as he kissed her hand. “Forgive me, Maria. I’ll wave you tomorrow, all right?” he said, and shut the door after her. He waited for the hovercar to move away before he turned to John.
“Thank you for agreeing to meet with us,” Holmes said. “I prefer to meet my clients in person, wherever possible.”
As John stared down at the coin, he heard a shuddering sigh beside him. He jerked up to look, and saw Sherlock’s posture and demeanour shift.
Sherlock stood and pulled his shirt up to show the bandaging on his side. “Some blood loss, and I’ll have a scar, but no major organs. I was moving when she fired, so it wasn’t as bad as it could have been. I’m all right.”
Mycroft looked at his little brother. Sherlock was calm, and his smile was wide and happy, and he was glowing with contentment. He smiled back.
[Without missing a beat, John runs at the bare wall opposite the mirrors, using his momentum to run up the wall two paces, then flips in midair and lands on his feet.]
“Weird cases lately, aren’t they? I mean, you know that I generally don’t call you in for the regular stuff, but…”
John’s brow knotted. Bahdri’s face was lit up, as though he had a Christmas morning secret. He stared at him for a long time, then said, “All right.”
It was clear that one group had found alcohol of some sort, as their voices were harsh and overly cheerful for the circumstances. Sherlock could even hear singing rising up – something about the end of the world and ‘feeling fine’. The voices were raucous and crude in a way that made Sherlock’s skin prickle in a way he had back in school, when he heard the voices of his bullies in the dormitories at night.
Generally Sherlock avoided contact with others, keeping distance from the echoes of the wild voice he heard in the park at night. He reasoned that if help came, it would wear a Red Cross insignia or a yellow vest.
“I don’t know why I’m hiding them,” he told Ella. “It’s not like I’m embarrassed about them, I’m quite pleased. But for some reason I’m uncomfortable with him seeing them.”
John found it privately amusing that this Garrideb, who was now paying particular attention to the engraving on the coin, had probably not noticed that his American namefellow had probably been apoplectic with rage at the time, given how angry he was when he had arrived at Baker Street. He was glad that he and Holmes were representing Nathan and not John Garrideb; he was finding that he liked the present one more and more.
“Shut up, Sherlock,” John said. His heart was pounding but he was a soldier, and soldiers were brave, weren’t they? They threw themselves into risky and dangerous situations, right? He licked his lips.
“We’re going to visit Uncle Mycroft first,” he said. It was the first time he had referred to Mycroft in that way to Rosie; he imagined the scowl on Mycroft’s face if he knew. He resolved to use it from this moment forward. “Then we’ll ask his help to find Daddy. All right?”
Sherlock left the room silently. By the time he had returned with cleaning supplies, the water had begun to coagulate, as though someone had added cottage cheese. John stood in the corner of the room, in parade rest, arms crossed, not taking his eyes off Sherlock.
John hurried over to Holmes and Martin, sorry to have made Holmes impatient. Holmes was laying out the letters with the dancing men figures, and John guessed that Holmes wanted to move on to the next stage of the case. Quickly, Holmes walked Martin through the story of his client’s issue, and then through solving the code of the letters. When he got to the final one, ‘Elsie prepare to meet thy God’, Martin huffed out a heavy sigh.
He followed her through the streets to the cathedral. As they walked, he saw more familiar landmarks rising up before him, less damaged than Westminster. He smiled when he saw the Old Bailey – its tower shattered but the building intact. Then St. Paul’s  was in front of them, solid and stone and reassuring.
Heavy steps came slowly up the stairs, and the cabbie came to the doorway. He was a big man, heavily built around the shoulders and over six feet – well above the average height for a contemp. “You called for me, sir?” he said, his voice deep and slightly surly despite the polite words.
“Sherlock,” John said. His arms were rigid with tension as they held the controls, his face equally tense. “We’re breakin’ atmo in ‘bout two minutes, I’ll lose his signal, I can’t turn around after-”
After I press Send, regret kind of hits me a bit. That was regressive. However, that tactic never failed me before.
Then another memory poured into his mind: one of his teachers catching him doodling over his notebook. Instead of scolding him, she raised her eyebrows and said, “This is quite good, Johnny.” She had sent a note home with him, suggesting that Mr. Watson enroll John in art classes at the local community centre.
Warning for Sherlock being a less than perfect, yet very human, parent; but he and Rosie come to an understanding.
“Speakin’ of ambition.” John’s face lit up. “There’s a ship I’ve got an eye on. I’ve almost got enough for it now. Just a small ship, won’t take too much fuel to fly her. Gonna start a courier business, shuttlin’ small cargo from planet to planet. I get restless if I’m stuck in one place too long, I figure that will take care of that and make me enough money to keep flyin’.”
I’m waiting for the kind of thing I’ve heard before. I have never understood the leap in logic from hearing, ‘I don’t want to sleep with you tonight’ to saying ‘You’re a great big whore.’ If I’m a whore, I would sleep with you, right?
Sherlock could hear someone near Mycroft saying, “Sir, we have to go.” If it were any other conversation, they would have disconnected by now, but he could hear Mycroft breathing on the line.
And how she would talk. He found it exhausting, trying to maintain a conversation with her when her lines of logic were more like strands of spaghetti, curving and twisting at will. She would talk about mushrooms, then squirrels, then Peppa Pig, switching without warning, in a way that made sense only to her. Sherlock, who generally spent his days either working on a case or in silence, found that the non-stop patter jangled on his nerves.
Sherlock detected that the tension in the air had not wholly dissipated since the plane had taken off. Even the pilots worked in silence, and Sherlock could see the tension along their backs.
John waiting for a few more hours, this time staying off the line altogether, so Dunworthy could get through. When the silence of the phone started to get to him, he decided to just go over to Dunworthy’s office, see if he was in. Perhaps talk to Finch – Finch always seemed to know where Dunworthy was.
He heard the scrape of the chair pulled to centre stage, just in front of him, and allowed Florence to pull him to his feet. His body now loose and lax, he slumped over the chair. She lifted him by the hair and directed his attention to the noose hanging at the back of the stage. Then in a flurry of movement, she pushed him over, chair and all, tossed her hair, and exited.
“Nice attention to detail – her wrinkles, birthmarks, and so forth. See if she’d consent to a study of just her hand, then really focus in, as much as you can. Also watch the shading with portraits, you can really emphasize the third dimension if you get the shading right. Look at da Vinci’s anatomy drawings to get a sense of what you should look for.”
I go cold at that, at the thought that he honestly believed no one would mourn him. Even the way he says it, it’s like a robot. How fucked up is this guy? A café of idiots indeed.
“Me?” Nathan Garrideb looked up from his work, shocked. “Why me? You are the prime mover of this enterprise?”
He closed the door to the bedroom, and jammed a chair under the doorknob. Then he laid Rosie gently on the floor. She wriggled with delight, clearly thinking that this was a new game. Sherlock pulled out his phone once more – no message from John. He texted again.
“Then last year, the poor old man died, with no relatives alive to comfort him. I mourned the loss of his friendship, but you can imagine my surprise when I learned that I had been named in his will; and not just named, but the sole beneficiary, but with the most extraordinary provision that had ever been heard of. If I were to find three living men with the family name of Garrideb, myself included, then each of us would inherit five million from his estate.”
“I hope you’re right, Doctor Watson. Thank you.” Cubitt looked inward for a moment. “My poor Elsie. I’d do anything to keep her from harm, or even the slightest inconvenience.” Cubitt looked up at John. “You’re not a married man, sir?”
He looked thoughtfully out the window as the helicopter took off. “You know, Euros, if Dr. Bell said he could stop the delusions tomorrow, I don’t think I would.”
The drums were primal and spare; the vocals simplistic at first, then developing into a staccato rhythm. Then the chorus broke into a powerful pulse, echoing a strong heartbeat, and the singer and the lyrics reflecting pure, raw emotion.
The home of Mr. Nathan Garrideb was like a museum, John thought, but the most crowded, eccentric, discombobulated museum he had ever seen. His brain boggled at the sight of coins, statues, tapestries, engravings and other detritus of history from what seemed like every era of human time.
“I just thought-” John stopped and took a breath, his fists clenching and unclenching. “What did you mean - that he wouldn’t like you doing cases?”
“Yeah, um. James was meeting with our handler. We always met in public; in this case it was an outdoor café in the square. We thought that meeting in public protected us. But there was a sniper. I was late, just walking into the square, when James and our handler went down. I turned around and tried to get out, but I suppose the sniper spotted me. Fortunately he just winged me. As soon as I heard the bullet I ran, and didn’t realize I was bleeding until I was in the safe house. Stitched myself up. Advantages to being a doctor.”
“That’s right, it’s dangerous, and your Daddy doesn’t want you to get hurt. Your Daddy is very smart, isn’t he?” Sherlock had to give himself another little moment but soon had his voice under control. “It’s like the cooker outside right now. Hot and dangerous. In here it’s safe.”
Reynolds sniffed, clearly not completely mollified, but resigned. “Fine.” He turned to the large tank of fish, serenely swimming around the coral. “The aquarium recently invested in four peppermint angelfish, or C. boylei, from the Cook Islands in the eastern-central Pacific. These fish are terribly rare, as they are only found in depths of 53 to 120 metres. There were two males and two females, as we were planning to breed them here. One of the males went missing last week. We didn’t notice for a day because they’re very shy fish, we thought he was hiding in the coral. Then yesterday we realized that one of the females was missing as well. I believe someone is stealing them to begin their own breeding program.”
“All my life, Sherlock, since – I think that – the best times in my life – I felt most alive when we were on cases, running, but – the happiest – the most content I’ve ever been was sitting down with you. Like – like now. So.” John looked up at Sherlock, as though his head weighed a thousand kilos and every muscle was fighting his attempts to move. “So. Did you mean it.”
John waved a hand at him, at the room, the tea. “Is this what you always wanted? I mean, you clearly don’t have to worry about money. You’re famous, everyone knows who you are. Did you always want to be a Companion?”
A single finger, light as frost, traced the track of a tear along the edge of his face. Then along the fringes of his hair.
When John woke, morning sun was trickling past the curtains into Sherlock’s room. They had both moved, John flipping onto his back and Sherlock further down the bed, but with one long arm over John’s chest. John spent several long minutes watching Sherlock’s peaceful face and the rise and fall of his breathing, but ultimately John’s bladder could not be argued with, and he extricated himself carefully.
Getting dressed was a blur, and Bahdri propelled him out of the flat and into a waiting cab. The initial burst of energy that had gotten him clean and dressed soon faded, and John spent the cab ride staring out the window at the streets as they passed. It was the first time he’d been outside since seeing Dunworthy, and he shivered in the cool midnight air.
He’d call me a whore to my face, but bloody the nose of anyone else who called me the same.” Her eyes flickered up to Sherlock, and he saw the vast distances between stars there. “I loved him, you know. And he loved me. Thank God we finally bent our stiff necks and told each other.”
I hear his voice break a little on ‘hours’, and I snap, “For God’s sake, Sherlock, just sit down! Stop avoiding this for fuck’s sake!”
Realization dawned. “So he created this whole Garrideb story, just to get Nathan Garrideb out of the house?”
, Sherlock thought again. He turned away from John, away from the sound of the newspaper that John was rattling already. “All right,” he said to the driver.
Jim opened the door to reveal a large room, white and clean. Sherlock could see glass tubing, microscopes, and large scientific equipment, some with the plastic covering still on. He felt his eyes widen despite his efforts to remain blasé.
He understood her, of course. But it would not do to indicate that. Stay calm, stay focused. He gave her a charming but weak and confused smile.
The model untied and shrugged off her housecoat, immediately moving into a casual lounging position. She had no shyness in her body, no sense of timidity of being naked in front of a bunch of strangers. There was a brief intake of breath from the class.
He had failed Sherlock. He had made a promise, and had failed him. Sherlock had believed him, and he had failed him.
This time, Sherlock spent the flight memorizing a map of Toronto, and reading up on cold cases in that city – Jamie had had very little information on the case for them to prepare with, preferring instead that his friend brief them when they arrived. John watched a couple of movies and napped a bit.
“Well then.” Sherlock began to clean the wound, quickly and efficiently. “You were a medic in the New Alliance Force?”
The room was orange and pink with the dawn when John’s eyes fluttered and blinked open. His eyes darted fretfully around the room for a brief moment before settling on Sherlock.
,’ he had said. So John gritted his teeth together to keep the words in. Focused on the shape of Sherlock’s strong legs.
"She was in a white dress, with tiny fake pearls and smocking over her torso, and wings of feather and glitter, attached to her shoulders with sturdy elastic. She turned again, clearly delighted with her disguise as a celestial."
addict, narrow shoulders still trembling from the effort of carrying the amniculusite, and a vacant, dazed look to him.
“Got it, heading him off,” Jerome said, and rang off. John slipped his phone into his pocket and broke into a run.
“I think Juliet can be ruled out. She’s onstage almost as much as Romeo, and when she’s not onstage she’s looking over her lines. You can practically see the book in her head as she speaks. Friar Lawrence-”
“I don’t know how to keep you,” John said. His smile became a brief flicker which died again. “Meetin’ you – ever since I met you I’ve been amazed every time I see you, every time you want to talk to me. And yesterday was – more than I’d ever hoped for. You said – you said love, but - I think of the life you’re used to, with the parties, and all those rich people, and I don’t know how you could-”
He was so caught up in Rosie’s laughter and the image of the world as it used to be, he completely failed to notice anyone else in the park until pain exploded in the back of his head and he fell.
Sherlock re-emerged, a small smile on his face. He pulled out his phone again, texting quickly. Greg heard John’s phone beep, and John looked at it. His face screwed up in confusion.
Running footsteps came down the corridor. Sherlock turned his head away from Mrs. Hudson and Maja toward the sound.
“Here, Sherlock, here, lie down, like this. That’s right. Put your arm – yes, that’s it. Lift your leg.” Sherlock obeyed as though in a dream, and John neatly tucked his knee between Sherlock’s thighs. Clever John had tangled them up together on the sofa neatly, their bodies intertwined and their lips only millimeters apart. Sherlock sighed in pleasure and stretched his body against John’s.
With every street that they passed, with every clop of the cabbie horse’s hooves, Holmes remained silent. John thought over the possibilities of what would happen when they reached Baker Street:
“I need you, Sherlock.” John came and knelt in front of Sherlock, staring up into his shocked face. “Sherlock, I am begging you, for once in your life, don’t think about this logically, but consider emotions. Listen to me.”
John was sure he wasn’t imagining the spark in Holmes’ eye as John clambered in, and he jumped in after him with an energy surpassing any he had displayed so far.
“I am – came over from… the National Theatre,” John said, grabbing at the first London theatre company name he could think of. “We’re thinking of bringing over a Canadian production.”
He stepped to Sherlock, inserting himself in the vee of his knees; Sherlock’s eyes never left him. John used his fingers to gently tilt Sherlock’s head up, and laid his lips against Sherlock’s. The kiss was almost chaste, but John used it to pour everything he felt for Sherlock into him - all his love, affection, admiration, and loyalty.
“Listen to me very carefully,” he said quietly to John. Rage and confusion were fighting for dominance over John’s expression. Sherlock raised his fist, and spoke under the music. “We’re putting on a show for the cameras now, and the music is loud enough that they can’t hear us. Pretend you’re still angry with me.”
Jim shook his head. “Exactly the same. It creates a new challenge when playing; you have to remember which are your pieces by memory, not by sight. Come on, try a game?”
“Lord, where didn’t we go,” John said. The volume of his voice changed, and Sherlock could tell he was wandering around the sitting room. “Kalidasa, Huang Long, Zhu Que… We’d hear about a job, we’d go. Shipping, security, sometimes – well. All sorts of jobs. You play chess?”
