The rustling stopped short, then Tony's friend broke out of a shrubbery. "Steve?" He asked in surprise, dropping a gun. "What are you doing here?"
"I'll go," he decided. It was still his fault, he knew it. He would have to end the fight. "Tony, no!" Shouted at least three people at the same time, but he knew he had to do it.
and you were in the same house as we were for months? You are a monster, nothing more and nothing less; a monster!"
"No," the Brit grinned. Another man came running toward him. He looked about the same age as Burkwill. "There you are, Peter," he said. "That took a long time."
As the loud crash of the car against the tree pierced the silence, Tony flinched unconsciously. He was looking for a way out, but he did not find one. Then the motorbike drove back. The silent biker walked purposefully to the driver's door, just behind the smouldering, destroyed bonnet.
At that moment the elevator doors opened and Tony jumped up immediately when he could see his boyfriend. Steve looked tired but smiled enthusiastically at him anyway.
The first minutes of the journey were silent until Natasha cleared her throat. "Barnes will stay in the team. You should nourish yourself."
The floor was tiled in black and white and the walls were painted green, but here and there concrete had been smeared over broken areas. In some places, another shade of green had masked the stains, but Tony's eyes for design bristled.
"Some were sent away from the Broadway," Bucky explained. "They were waiting there because there was no room left."
"You can’t do it. What if it makes things worse? We've all been wrong about our last big decision and see what happened!
Tony's eyes focused on a point on the ceiling. He had heard the shots in the end. Zemo wanted to shoot him, but Bucky had been in between. He had saved him and was in great danger, as so many other people were because of him.
The mechanic nodded. He had no problem with attracting attention, but such a car in a relatively poor area could cause problems. A driver, leaning against the car, smoking, waved to them before entering.
"The beings are only vulnerable in a few places," he summarized the information he and SHIELD had collected about the aliens. The projected image in the center of the room represented one of the aliens. "There, there and at all the other marked spots."
Most of these boring, untalented people had hoped that Stark would be dead. They all had their meager problems with him and nobody wanted him to be alive.
Tony stared dumbfounded at the mouth, which seemed to sneer in the middle of the room. How did the man know that? Fury stared dumbfounded at the mechanic. He had been able to bypass the safety precautions and nobody had noticed anything.
Tony shivered as he took a step back. Steve looked forced quiet and Tony's heart throbbed faster. He could hardly think right.
Then the sound came back. "- help with these injuries," Wilson finished. The camera wobbled. You could see that there were three other agents in the cave besides Lang, Wilson, and Mrs Anne Miller.  The cave looked much more like a long corridor. Then the light went out and the picture became black again.
"The door was not closed, I wanted to look after you." Steve tried to look strong. His shoulders were pulled back and his chest was outstretched. He ran as if he was in the military again, but Tony could tell the man was a bit paler than usual.
"Language," he said uncertainly and came one step closer to the smaller one. Briefly, they both faced each other before Tony, as driven by a sudden impulse, bridged the gap and wrapped his arms around Steve. "I'm sorry," he whispered again. "Let us clarify that afterwards."
The soldier smiled gratefully at him, and the inventor turned back to the screen. "Also show routes over hills, Friday."
Steve stared in horror at Fury, who turned on the spot and walked to the elevator. Hill and the other agent didn’t move. The others had their eyes fixed on Fury, his back to them before the doors closed.
"Are all traces removed?" Burkwill asked as Kima and Xi returned. "The bodies are gone, our nice buddy here will not notice," said the younger man, pointing to the
"We won’t be able to take over the ship just like that," Wanda screamed suddenly. "There has to be a kind of centre that all of these beings protect. If we have it, we’ve got the ship! "
"Dumm-E, bring a chair," Tony said suddenly, "that could take a while, let's not leave Steve standing around."
"We haven’t got much. We can only guess approximately where the things came from. And the British poet William Julius Mickle once mentioned in a letter an alien that he described in a similar way to the monsters. Maybe they were not here for the first time, but we don’t know anything else," Steve said with a slight frustration in his voice. "Do you have any news from Scott and Sam?"
The stationery was still white, unlike the photo, and handwritten. Tony looked at Steve, who gave him an encouraging squeeze before turning to the letter.
Tony shook his head. "I’m great. Okay, I’ve been better before," he added, seeing Rhodey's admonishing expression. "You?"
The image built up in front of the two and Tony looked at it. It was a pencil drawing that showed a hilly background in portrait format and a creature with a wide-open mouth on it. It seemed to run towards the viewer. Small horns came out of the head and a liquid dripped out of the place, where ears should be. On the shoulders and chest, the body was darker, branches grew from it. In the background were coniferous trees, which were penetrated by fog and at the top of the picture Tony saw again a sickle-shaped moon.
"Bad blood value, am I right?" Burkwill asked. "Actually, just since the attack on Tom's River, but still bad. Of course, that does not bother you as long as you can go on working, Stark, but perhaps you should have paid more attention to your own health. Would it not be possible to use state-of-the-art nanotechnology to let small cameras and microphones flow through your veins?"
"You have a leaf on your suit," Burkwill almost whispered. The man had long since bridged the optimal distance between two strangers. His face was barely five inches from Tony's. Tony was about to hit him when the man pulled the leaf from his suit with a pleased grin, but he knew that would make the situation escalate.
"I'll stay in the living room," Steve said into the silence that had once again spread. It was unusual that they all talked so little, Tony noticed, but probably his colleagues were all as tired as he was.
But Clint was not deterred and shook his head. "As I know you, you might even see to it that your children are mixtures of you. Oh God, little genius athletes!"
"I can’t. Natasha, I ...," he stopped, his voice thinner than expected, much weaker, reflecting his reality. "I'm not feeling well, I would hinder you. I've been working all day, I'm sick, I don’t want to bother...," he admitted and hesitated. He did not meet Natasha's eyes. "I’m sorry. I can’t go with you, but you have to. You are enough. Wilson, Barton, Maximoff, probably Lang too ... and Rogers and Barnes. You don’t need a man like me. My suit is not even finished yet. Go ahead, I would endanger you."
"Oh, you sure about that?" Tony said sarcastically, earning a kick against the back by the same man. He could barely see what was happening through the rain and tears in his eyes, but the Asian-looking man pulled a big knife from his belt. He asked Burkwill something in Mandarin, who had calmed down a bit now but kept his eyes between Pepper and Tony. Burkwill answered curtly and the Asian explained something to the younger one - probably Kima - in English, which made little sense for Tony. He could only feel the claws digging deeper and deeper into his shoulder and certainly destroying something.
For a moment Burkwill was quiet again, but this time he did not grin. This time, Tony even thought of seeing something like sadness in his eyes, but that moment was over quickly. "It would be nice to hear the news that you are no longer among the living, but my people are no better than you. Arrest them before they do anything stupid, most of them cannot do anything else."
"What did you do to her?" he cried. He did not care that everyone that heard him could tell how desperate he was.
"Sounds good. Incidentally, the kids are currently campaigning for a 'Captain America - Iron Man Cake'. Somehow a mixture. I'm curious to see if Laura can handle it that fast."
She had studied the reactions of the Avengers closely and understood that Steve wanted to postpone this encounter. She nodded.
Tony let out a breath of amusement, shaking his head under the pillow. For a moment, both stopped, and the inventor could practically feel the piercing gaze of his friend on him.
Slowly, Tony turned the photo to the back, hoping to find out who this was, but Steve squeezed his shoulder and picked up the package.
"You could have tidied up," the mechanic greeted his robot but patted him gently on the head after the little helper had bowed it sadly.
Tony nodded without noticing. It was true, the man had everything planned. He must have wanted them to come to this conclusion, otherwise, he could have had the live broadcast played from another location. He wanted to test them, wanted to press them.
"Weapons down," Tony repeated, angrily. His eyes fixed one of the young agents so he would not have to see what was happening in the video next. But it was like an accident, he had to look. The car blocked something of the view, but he could still see his mother wrestling for her life. Treacherous tears crept into his eyes and he wiped them away with his hand, which Steve did not hold. The soldier moved closer to Tony, showing him proximity. Tony's mother died and Barnes looked at Tony almost imploringly.
The soldier would be coming. Of course, since talking to him yesterday, Tony had not seen him again, and Steve's conversation was certainly not pleasanter to him than to himself.
A message had been received. Immediately Clint opened the laptop again and clicked on two or three buttons before a black screen opened again. Slowly, Tony pulled away from the wall he was leaning against and walked to the center of the room to better look at the screen. He felt Steve's arm, which accidentally touched his after he had come closer. Vision stood behind Tony, arms crossed, trying to get a glimpse of the screen all were staring at.
Tony's skin felt boiling hot. Somehow, Steve managed to put the mechanic over his shoulders so that as few wounds as possible were worsened. Steve tried to avoid touching the broken arm. Tony would hardly feel the pain during unconsciousness, yet Steve did not want to be rough to him. Like a toddler, Tony lay on Steve's back and did nothing.
Natasha nodded to the two men and ran through her hair. Steve sighed loudly and Tony straightened his glasses before the car stopped and the doors opened automatically. One after the other, they stepped out into the street and looked at a red brick building of at least five stories.
It was only when Tony was sure the drunk had run away that he stretched, and tore off a few wet leaves from the tree, which he placed carefully on his chest. His face was completely wet by now, but he did not want to put on the helmet because it shone as well. Again, Tony leaned back and turned his attention to the bridge below him. His thoughts, however, hung on Steve and the traitor, who was sitting under the same roof as the soldier.
"Zemo’s dead," he said in the end. His voice was flatter than usual, and Tony frowned. That did not make sense to him. What did Zemo have to do with this?
Tony loved that look. For a week now, Steve came to him every day, because for a week he accompanied Bucky at his therapy. Every day, the soldier, who had been denied nearly all chances of a real recovery at the beginning, got a little bit stronger. It was Steve's achievement, Tony knew that.
The other man laughed, somewhere between relief and surprise, then heaved him up. Black dots formed in Tony's field of vision and only then could he feel the other arm holding him. Natasha and Steve dragged him to a helicopter that was landing. Tony limped alongside, but could hardly stand on his feet. He was looking for Rhodey.
Tony flew further into the air. "Friday, can you see the brain?", he shouted to the AI. She scanned but could not give him a result. Again, Tony flew down, killing two of the aliens. The pain in his shoulder was completely forgotten as he manoeuvred himself through trees and avoided the aggressive aliens. At the edge of the park, Tony could see flashing lights that came from cameras.
"But if anyone hears about it, our freedom of action could be limited," contradicted Vision objectively.
He let his eyes wander. The sea to his left was rushing incessantly and waves arrived and retreated. There were more caves in front of him in the distance. Sandstone formations, and in all of them could be Tony.
Tony shook his head and glanced at Vision, who was still standing only a few yards away. "It is," he admitted. Pepper did not answer.
"The shield will last at least two or three hours if you do not damage the generator. It’s probably inside the tank."
Several chairs stood opposite a large wooden table, on which both file folders and a screen were placed. Through one of the windows, some light fell into the room, showing the dust in the air.
She wiped her hair off her face and glanced at Clint who then stood up to get out of the room. The other Avengers followed.
"You have to be quiet," Fury said. "But if you get into a direct fight, you just have to endure it. We will make sure that there are agents everywhere nearby you. You need fast connections, you're right, Barnes."
Before he knew it, he had picked up the cell phone and was about to press the contact list when he remembered what he was doing. He sighed and waited for something to happen, he just hold the cold phone in his hands. But nothing happened, everything was as quiet as always, as
Tony had not gone back to the workshop that evening. The treatment had been more exhausting than he had anticipated, and in the end, he could just drag himself into his own room. His arm burned and the painkillers given to him did not help. Tears of pain ended up in Tony's eyes as he dropped onto his bed. His ribs hurt and felt like they squeezed his organs and jumped out of his ribcage at the same time.
"When I came back from the river to where I hid the day before, all the tracks were already buried under the snow, so I could not figure out where they came from. And I did not really see the men. One, the younger one, was wearing too big clothings and a black hat. He was black, but as I said, I could not assign the accent. The other wore a suit, that was all I could see. The accent reminded me of the British people, but what do I know. He was a little smaller than the younger and less sporty, but almost a bit ... more powerful built. He had grey hair, but I could not see more in that little light."
So, right now I'm really struggeling with updating, because I'm highly disappointed in myself. But I wrote this for fun and I really don't feel like I'd like to change things now.
Tony saw three teeth in the mouth without lips, all of which shone silverily, and several pimples covered the skin of the creature. Tony noticed that only a few hairs grew and that the creature didn’t have ears.
The interior of the building was only gray. The walls, the floor, the ceiling. All in the same shade of gray. Many doors and corridors led to the various areas of the ship. But somehow, Steve knew where he needed to go. His eyes were fixed on the ground in front of him, his thoughts still hanging outside. The burning stain in the sky caused by Tony's sacrifice. Even though he did not want to admit it, his eyes started to burn and filled with tears. Angrily, he wiped them away. He shouted loudly and slammed his hand against the steel wall to his left. The pain shot through him when he hit something sharp, but he didn’t really notice it. His breathing quickened and it became harder again, but Steve wandered along the corridors. With every step he took, he was more sure to have made mistakes. What if he had called Tony? What if he just signed the accords? What if he had run to the brain himself, maybe he could have killed it without anyone dying.
"Congratulations," said Burkwill's voice with the typical British accent. Again, nausea came up in Tony, but he tried to calm his breathing. "If you see this, I'm probably dead."
Steve could see it. The creature stretched several yards high. An armor that seemed to be impenetrable even from a distance, and a particularly large head were the things that stood out first.
"Friday, check the suit again, I have to go upstairs. I want to have all the bugs fixed, I don’t feel like another cave and an explosion in the air ..."
Steve stood by the big window and stared in the meadow, with a lot of teams of agents rushing around.
"Everything went well, we have the support," said Peter Krum. He knew James Burkwill was not a man who talked a long time around the bush. With him, you had to get to the point quickly.
His hand burned as he held it in front of his eyes - as he felt the urge to cry. Still, they trembled uncontrollably and again he hit hard on the table. Something fell down, but he did not care. His chest was racing and he could not think clearly.
"If you had been gone a day longer, I would’ve come back to find you myself, Tony," she explained more gently. Tony smiled. It was probably true. And if she had found him, she would have blamed him for dropping out of the meetings.
"Don't you even have the courage to look at me?" Tony shouted unimpressed by Burkwill's speech. "Look at me, you little piece of-"
Without further ado, he pulled Steve back down into a hug. He pressed his head into the crook of his shoulder and enjoyed the silence.
"The two," explained Burkwill, "cannot walk anymore. Neither of them can, at least not fast. They will not get to your hiding place fast enough, even if they knew where it was. As I said, you do not have to hope. But obviously, you are not as optimistic as you always say. I thought I might surprise you if I didn't give out every agent."
Steve wondered. But his thoughts were interrupted by a loud gong announcing that the press conference would soon be starting.
"Anthony Stark!" he immediately heard the familiar voice and winced slightly. "How can you jump out of a damn plane, disappear without a trace, and then not call me when you are back?"
"Teambuilding", countered Sam but and was already going for the door. "That's exactly what Fury wanted. Do something together, strengthen the team. We can’t be three people less."
Then he turned back and ran into the forest. On the beach he would have seen Tony, he would first search in the forest. Cool air hit him directly, as the shadow fell over him. The previous day's storm was like a distant fairytale story. It was very quiet in the forest.
Steve moved restlessly beside him but said nothing. Again, they fell into silence, which lasted almost the entire ride, until a small noise broke the silence. Steve moved and looked at something - Tony didn’t even bother to take his eyes off the street.
"That’s the Shore Road. It extends over several miles. There is a beach and small forests. There are several sandstone formations, as well as some parking spaces. But everything is empty currently."
Quietly, the doors opened to the large room and the two rapporteurs came in. The one on James’ left side was new. He glanced around the large room, fascinated by the expensive floor, the modern, yet sumptuous design, and the technology, right behind James' chair.
Tony looked at the pictures that Natasha accepted. There were eight pictures, all of which were printed on photo paper. They showed a clearing that was completely snowy. Sun fell on the fir trees in the background, but the snow was in many places impressed by imprints. The photo did not show a shoeprint.
"The Avengers have all been released, said the president at a news conference a few minutes ago. Whether the Avengers are now independent of the United Nations remains unclear," the young woman spoke seriously into the microphone. “After what had happened in Toms River, we all should be happy to have such a protective measure, so he said. After the air battle at about three in the evening and after, so say witnesses, Tony Stark sacrificed himself to end the danger, the cleanup and searching work continues. Inhabitants are told to report if they either know something about the billionaire or observe unusual activities."
Tony could look out of his hiding place to Burkwill and saw that he was talking madly into the air. As if the man was completely crazy since the Avengers were here. "And then I find out that your friend plans and co-organizes the return of the other Avengers all the time. Why? Because he wanted to save you, Stark. Says you are lost without your team. So, I make sure he has to work for me, otherwise, you're dead. I could have killed you. Over Tom's River, in the cave, in your sickbed, in your workshop. I gave you more weeks than I originally intended. And how does Vision thank me? Gives you information that you are not supposed to get, endangers the whole plan, even does not seem to be able to bring the other Avengers to sleep!"
More often he was there because of the atmosphere. The park was big, he realized as he flew over it, but he knew where he needed to go. Now, at this time, there was hardly anything going on here. Tony did not even hear teenagers who listened to music and drank alcohol. It was almost completely silent when he landed on a tree a few feet away from the bridge in the middle of the park. The lights of the city were reflected in the lake, but the otherwise crowded bridge stood quietly in the still water. Somewhere a swan fluttered, Tony guessed, but otherwise, he heard nothing. Carefully, he sat down more comfortably, always careful not to make unnecessary noises. He opened his helmet and focused his eyes on the bridge, where hopefully a clean handover would take place in two hours. Tony was sure Burkwill would take this bridge. And now he just had to wait.
"Damn it, Friday, remember me to not build that big next time," he murmured more to himself than to the AI.
Because the trees were so dense, Clint decided to fly over the beach and look for the people while the others were first searching in the forest.
Tony buckled under the strength of the paw thrown on his shoulder. Panic spread in his chest. If Burkwill still had one of these brains, then the smaller aliens could also walk around here. And they had already caused a panic when they flew over a small town at a height of hundreds of yards. Not in the middle of Boston. Tony felt the rainwater in his armor gather sweat as well. Besides, Burkwill let a brain walk practically unprotected. If he could do that, he might have had more.
Steve quickly pulled the shield out of his neck and wiped his forehead. His gaze swept across the battlefield, over to Bucky, who had just dealt a deadly blow to one being, but now headed straight for the next, over to Wanda, who was visibly exhausted trying to keep fighting, and over to Falcon, who was spinning in the air, and again and again flew toward the ground to kill more aliens.
Tony felt the hit before he saw it. Although Burkwill did not have a full hand, he was really strong. Tony staggered back and was only stopped by Vision from falling to the ground. "Please," he murmured, spitting blood. "It wasn’t turned on. I didn't know that. He must have been out. It was an accident."
Going down the stairs was easier than going up, but still, Tony's ribs burned after the three floors. But only when they closed the front door did he allow himself to breathe properly. The fresh air was good for his lungs. With his hands, he groped for his smartphone, while Natasha wrote to the driver.
The two came last. Tony's meds had dropped halfway and Clint had waited until the mechanic had picked them up, only to run past the assassin. Like a suitcase, his suit was already standing next to the tailgate in the plane and the door closed the moment in which the two were inside.
"Am I monitored now?" Tony asked. He had to admit, the other had scared him. But Steve shook his head in a little light. "I wanted to look at everything again, but not bother anyone."
So I'm just gonna finish this story, it's not too long anymore, anyways. But I know it's not the best story it's maybe even far from good, but I don't want to just stop in the middle of it. That would really trigger me.
Vision coughed, and Tony looked around frantically. He did not have time for such a conversation and was not really able to respond. He did not know what he should feel about Vision. "We have to get out of here, right now," he tried to distract, but again the other struggled.
Unfortunately, there was another common ground and Howard Stark also worked at night. So, about twenty minutes and a powerful speech later, Tony laid crying and distraught in his mother's bed and had a long night ahead of him.
"You all stay here, I need you all," Fury explained, pointing to the Avengers, "as soon as we have more information. We can assume that the man whose identity Agent Barton is about to provides more information about is going to send us more information."
The applause subsided and Fury cleared his throat. "Good evening!" he greeted the audience tight and looked into various cameras. "This press conference aims to remove speculation about Mr Anthony Edward Stark and the future work of the Avengers. Please sit down," the man immediately began, pointing the reporters to their seats. A rustling went through the rows and shortly thereafter it was very quiet.
When he woke up the next morning, his chest felt like it was under fire. The summer morning sun already shone through the large windows and bathed the modern room in a warm light. Many of his visitors, both women and men, found that light beautiful, as they always told him when they were still there in the morning.
Tony felt the smile on Steve's face. For days he has been talking about Tony, who has actually asked to take Bucky with him to eat in the city. The two had not seen each other too often in the last few days, but Steve was eager for the two men to build a good friendship.
into danger, it was just you and the five poor souls in front of you. But even that wouldn't have been necessary if he had listened more to my orders." Burkwill grinned at Tony and Vision.
In the mirror, Tony could see how pale he was and how many wounds stretched across his face. Exhausted, he leaned against Steve, who put his arms on his uninjured shoulder. Tony reached for his hand as if to show him he was there. That Steve did not have to worry about Bucky alone.
The quick switches in the person of viewing will end soon. The better chapters aren't that long away anymore and than it will be mostly just one perspective. Also, this whole part with the pain and stuff won't take too long and we'll go forward in the story. Might even meet that person from the prologue again.
"Nothing official, sir. I can try to get internal data, but I am sure that you would have been informed if SHIELD had known something more."
Tony did not sleep much that night. To calm Rhodey, he hobbled into his room right after the press conference ended. Almost two hours later, he awakened from his light sleep and heard how the others had come back. Some of their rooms were on his level, and although they tried to be quiet, they had not been able to hide from Tony's irritable senses.
The woman nodded hesitantly. Her voice trembled. "The next morning, after I saw what I had painted, I just heard that voice over and over again. This accent that I couldn’t unhear. So, I went back to the clearing, I shot the photos there. It had snowed a lot during the night. It looked very different. Ten inches high was the snow, but not in the clearing. Everything was flattened, as you can see."
"I haven’t been fully informed of what is going to be said. How much will we tell people about these monsters?"
Steve could see the pain and the inner turmoil. But he knew that for the time being he would only make things worse. The soldier stood slowly, patting Tony slightly on the upper arm, and looked sadly down at the man lying on the bed. “You know, Rhodes had been here most of the time, too”, he said. Tony did not answer. He knew it anyways.
The inventor turned to Steve and Natasha, who both had their arms crossed. Both of them slept in the car and Tony also had his eyes closed for a moment, although his brain was constantly working.
Still as dead, the man lay there as Steve kept going and got his legs out of the sand. The paint was gone from the protectors in some places, but otherwise, the rails seemed as if they had made the legs survive the fall unscathed.
Fury looked at him quietly for a moment, then shook his head. "We can’t go for that yet. Search teams from SHIELD and the government are strategically searching all sorts of places from there," Fury explained, pointing to the hologram that was now showing the trails of the search teams.
Silence descended across the room. These people needed their time to understand his carefully thought-out plan. James was only too happy to give them to them.
"Because it makes more sense. You will learn about the most important reason soon enough, but only this way, the fresh love could be aroused," said the man on. Tony changed his position. He did not know what the man meant.
"A few miles further south, sandstone formations begin to cover a wide area on the beach. You are going there to look for Tony and I stay here in the woods and look after him. That's how we can search more effectively. "
Nobody said that Tony was in the area, maybe he was further north, maybe he had landed in the sea, perhaps already been torn to shreds in the air. But Steve didn’t want to think about that. He had to keep looking when it was still bright outside. Earlier he had seen one of the others' planes, which was flying overhead, but right now it was further north. Apparently, the others hadn’t find him, probably they had to bring him back, to make sure he didn’t keep looking. He would like to know if Rhodes had found something, but he couldn’t lose his precious time and walk back to the street. Steve got up again; he had to move on.
"Are you alright?" he had asked, without being able to hide the concern in his voice. "Steve said you didn’t come down?"
"They say we have no other option. We have to shoot it," Rhodey replied. Steve shook his head. You couldn’t do that! How could one justify for such a mass of deaths? In his mind, he went through all the scenarios they could try.
Without being able to prevent it, tears had searched the way down his cheeks. He sensed that Steve was no different. But he also knew that Steve was not so upset about the words of Zemo, but about his friend. "We have the best doctors in the world, Steve. Bucky’ll be well again, he- "
Tony turned around briefly and tried to look at the tree, but the only thing he saw were shadows. Still, the two aliens stood like stones in front of the bridge.
Tony did not even nod. He just realized it. Maybe he had secretly hoped that the others would find him before it ended, and they could fight Burkwill.
Suddenly the doors of the elevator opened to the large room, and Steve turned around abruptly. Grimly, Fury, Hill, and another agent entered the room, whom Steve had seen before about twice. Without advocating, Fury projected a map over the glass table. Steve saw that Rhodey raised his head expectantly and Vision studied the map closely. Maria Hill looked tense and the other agent wrote something on his cell phone.
"Yes, sir," he said in a loud voice. "The means of transport must have flown from the northeast through the Atlantic. But by national security conditions, it must have been seen from New York City, sir. Camouflage devices were found on the ship, but not strong enough for the radar. So, we're dealing with an enemy in our security agencies. This fits in with the information we have about alien and human collaboration. There must be a group of at least two people behind this attack. Probably more, sir."
"We have," he said, and with the words, the tightness in his throat and lungs slowly resolved, "roughly determined the position from where the things came. East of Trondheim, we could make out the origin through two independent sources. The creatures must have run south and probably run there on a river into the airships. We can assume that years ago a larger herd took this route, or perhaps the same one that fought over Toms River. These beings are not the creation of science, because hundreds of years ago these things were probably seen, too. So, we have to assume that this is alien life."
I wasn't quite sure when I wrote this whether this was way to fast with Steve being in the workshop after what had happened, and also with Tony kind of protecting Bucky, but it felt right to me in the end, so I kept it. I hope it isn't too bad for all of you.
Yeah, maybe he was not dead yet. The suit hold up a lot, maybe Tony was still alive and waiting like he did back in New York, just waiting for someone to shout loudly beside him.
Steve stared at the floor in front of him and for a moment just heard the silence. He was frustrated. It was true. The danger was real. It could come at any time to another attack. And the agent was probably right.
They are talking about what alliances would mean for their country, for their patriotism and proudness, but nobody takes a position. There are no demonstrations, no masses of people going out, solicit for help and safety or a stop in their coldness against each other’s homelands."
is overstrained. I'm not happy about that at all; I had something else to do with him. Kima, Xi, take care of it. General, are you ready soon? Would you please keep an eye on Stark?"
The man exhaled angrily. Steve had never seen him so tense before. "The government can, and you will stick to it. The last time you thought your idea was more impressive than the government's, you pulled the Avengers apart. And as a result, we're looking for Stark, so stay away from your fucking ideas," Fury replied, quieter but also more threatening at the same time.
"It may not be the right situation, but could you please give me a signature? It has always been my desire to meet you once since I was born. Only if you don’t mind."
Burkwill nodded, almost pride. "A side effect that we did not anticipate. I apologize. You know what? I would like to know where the cars are, I don't want you to get sick, Stark. Lady Elise?"
"Well, Tony," Pepper started again after she had greeted someone. "Do you know the New World Millennium Hotel?"
Also; have you seen the Avengers 4 trailer? I mean, wow. I'm kinda scared. Man. I cannot wait for that movie.
At that moment, the coughing ceased for a moment, and Tony breathed in panic, only to cough again. When he strangled again, he vomited and Burkwill turned away. "Disgusting," he muttered. "Who watched him for so long that this could happen?"
Tony had jumped up and pointed to the ceiling with his hand, indicating the place everyone associated with Friday. It was stupid.
The moment a tear fell on his suit, it started to rain. A desperate laugh dismissed his mouth as he realized how dramatic everything was now. He cursed his sensibility and slid a little closer to the tree, hoping it would protect him a bit from the rain. The shower got stronger and after a few minutes Tony sat down attentively on the wet branch. One person slowly hobbled to the bridge. Tony's mouth opened. It was too early for the delivery. Was one of the prisoners broken out? That could be Lang, Tony judged by the silhouette and got ready to pick up the Avenger. But then the person stopped.
Tony's mouth opened and all his blood flowed from his head. Again, it felt like all his organs were sliding down his body. "No, not really. Unless," Burkwill grinned, "your name is James Burkwill and you have a lot of power and knowledge. But don’t worry, we have made sure that nothing happens to you. Did not you sometimes have a strange feeling in your throat? Probably consequences of our little test that Vision had performed."
"No, nothing. We’ll go to the road now. Nothing’s here. Vision’s waiting on Rhodes's plane, Scott on Steve's."
Then a metallic thump came from behind him and the creature screamed so loud that Tony's nape hair straightened up. It grabbed even tighter and Tony lost control of the muscles in his legs. For a brief moment he hung in the air, but then the blow sounded again and a muffling sound came to his ears as he fell the last few inches to the ground. His nose touched the ground first and cracked unnaturally, and then his shoulder fell on the severed hand of the monster. The alien continued to scream, and Burkwill gestured to them that they should go fast, but Tony tried to orient himself first. People were talking in confusion, and he understood nothing for a moment, but then two strong hands pulled him back to their feet and held him tight. Tony's muscles gave up, but the hands held him upright. Only slowly his vision cleared and he understood what had happened. The General was still kneeling beside Pepper, doing something, and Dragenbach watched closely, but Lang stared at Tony. With his mouth, he formed a question. "Are you okay?"
A hand dropped to his shoulder and squeezed slightly. Tony did not have to look up to know that it was Steve. "Just don't do it again, okay, Tony?" Rhodey asked. Tony nodded.
Steve's gaze practically slipped through him, and Clint could tell he had not drunk enough. "Here," he threw the water bottle at him. "We go home. Can you walk?"
Tony was dead. Tony Stark had sacrificed himself to save them. Steve's eyes blurred and again he felt unable to move.
you after you've dismissed the first commando you've got? I don't!", he stated and assuring chuttering broke off quietly.
"You got him, Tony," Rhodey screamed. With a loud splash, the creature finally fell over and became silent. But the cheers of others abruptly stopped. "What the ...", Tony asked himself more than anyone else.
And with that, the man pulled himself on the tank and pulled on the grenade. It was only a matter of seconds before it exploded, and Vision estimated it exactly. He took no chances, but kept the grenade in his hand. More and more of the creatures came and shot at him, Rhodey or Tony, and it was getting harder and harder to stop.
His friend had been right next to him during the blast, why was not he here now? The huge force had destroyed the whole tank, including the inside. A shiver ran down Tony's back; he remembered that Rhodey had been a little closer to the vehicle. Frantically, he tore his head to the side as far as his shoulder allowed. His eyes fell on Natasha, who said something he could not hear. She looked tense, but clearly spoke something reassuring. Steve's arm tightened around his chest. The ground was muddy and slippery and Tony almost fell if the two had not grabbed him. He felt more and more blood dribbling from his wound on his shoulder and felt the hand that Steve pressed on it to stop the bleeding. It hurt, but he felt the warmth that emanated from the other as he felt frozen. He felt the strange desire to run alongside Steve like this for a while, feeling his hand on his shoulder.
While the two men were running up the stairs - they would not be able to stand the waiting in the elevator - Friday told the Avengers that the destination was known. Somewhere in Headquarters, Fury would be told that an airplane had been prepared for takeoff and the Avengers were on their way while the man was mobilizing his agents to assist the group. He did not ask, he had seen the message. Stark had found the crucial information somewhere in it and would certainly declare that on the flight to the city in the north of the states. He set off with a flowing coat.
He could not sit here resting. He was drained, very tired and felt terribly guilty. If he still had the strength, he would go off and help the many teams that searched for Tony. Somehow. But the only orders they got from Fury, the military, and the government yet told them to stay at the headquarters. The situation with Stark was under control. They must wait.
Vision let his eyes glide through the plane. "No, he has not told me anything yet. He looks somewhat dismissive in the last few days."
"With me, I told you," the man replied and smiled. Tony wanted to puke. That perfect smile made him aggressive. "Oh, Stark, it's almost Roger's birthday. I hope you already have a present?"
Clint showed a statistic showing the man's esteemed fortune throughout his life. Tony was amazed when he saw the exponential growth. Burkwill had a good hand for money, he had to admit.
James Burkwill got up and used his three fingers to make sure that a large picture was projected into the center of the room.
"I know people. I know Stark. He thinks he's always trying to save everyone. He had to fly there, doesn’t matter when. Stark is not stupid. He knew that sooner or later he would be needed again. He had to build a new suit after Siberia. Stronger, better of course. He would have flown there even if he had not finished it yet," he paused for a brief moment and watched the others. "Fortunately, I am in the position to know exactly what is going on in the headquarters. That he would finish that day is simple maths."
Unless he wanted to play the psychic game. As with Zemo, who had incited the Avengers against each other, or in all the other cases that Tony had already been a part of. He sighed.
"And I've never worn braces," the man said, leaning forward. The last thing Tony and the others could see before the transfer stopped was the face of a man who had lost his whole family.
"I didn't expect to have developed a disposable suit," he grinned weakly at Steve. The soldier pulled him up, but Tony groaned. He could see several injuries on the other's face, but now that the fight was over, a tremendous pain came to the fore. His shoulder throbbed and felt like it was falling off at any moment.
"The monsters?" Rhodey asked and Tony just nodded slightly. His mind somehow still didn’t allow him to use the word "monster" seriously, even after the attack in New York a few years ago.
Steve had to use all his strength not to back down. He had never seen Fury so uncontrolled about Tony. He swallowed.
His fingers were shaking and he could not control the movement, and again he had to cough. He tensed and saw only black for a moment, but the coughing didn’t stop. Some blood spurted out of his mouth and spread over his glowing face.
"James Burkwill," Clint said, and Fury tapped some files on the laptop and then showed a picture of the man. It showed him, surrounded by several security men wearing sunglasses and suits in the middle of a shopping mall. The man wore a distinctly expensive suit with one of his arms loosely hanging down. Tony shuddered when he thought it was his work in some way. The man still had dark blond hair and fewer wrinkles in the picture as far as Tony could tell. The beard was smaller than the one he had seen yesterday.
The kiss was hesitant at first, but then it changed. Tony was all the fear he had felt the last few hours and knew Steve understood him. The other's hands were warm and strong on his head and his unharmed shoulder, giving exactly what Tony Stark needed: love and confidence.
Everything was quiet for a moment. Then the agents responded professionally. Several of them already ran out of the room before Fury could even scream after them.
In the end, they seldom asked anything and the answers were almost rarer. After a while, Friday announced that Rhodey was standing in front of the frosted glass and Tony invited him inside. His friend explained that Steve was needed again upstais, because of Barnes, and the soldier almost gasped with relief. Tony's heart poked slightly as he discovered that Steve's last few hours were probably not pleased with him. He had to admit, no matter how angry he was at the other, his presence had contributed significantly to his ability to work.
From that day Tony knew that he needed to get to know him better, and in the evening he suggested taking him to this little Manhattan restaurant where you could sit in one corner almost undisturbed in the evening, at least if Nancy had a shift.
"The boy isn’t in interest for you. Nothing happened, there were no injured civilians in this attack. What's important is what those aliens were and whether they could come back," the man continued. Tony thought it was scary just to see the man’s mouth.
Hey! We are getting to the part that I actually really like. So, the newer - and what I think better - chapters are starting in I think the one after the next. But I think, it's getting better from now on.
"I definitely have one for you," the stranger ignored the interruption, "after all, you did not get a present for your birthday because of ... well, the little conflict. But you must know, I like to give things. Surely nobody has congratulated you afterwards? Rhodes was eating with you, I know that. And Vision cooked something the next day. It tasted terrible, I've heard, but he had tried at least. But not more, right? Neither Rogers, nor Barton, nor Maximoff, nor anyone else. That doesn’t have to be. Ah, someone's getting nervous," the mouth moved slightly in the direction of one of the agents quietly saying something to another.
Vision was immobilized on the bridge, and enemies stood behind him, seeking cover. A wave of emotions came over Tony. The Android had betrayed him, but then only wanted to protect him and now he was probably killed. Anger and joy, disgust and respect flooded through him, but he could not really decide what to feel. He quickly turned away from the lifeless body.
Tony saw his eyes, which looked pleadingly at him. "It was not all because of the video, was it, Tony? Not only the video."
"Friday?" He asked quietly, though he knew the AI would always be awake. "Is there something new from Tony?"
Softly he pushed it open and cool air immediately moved into the room. Tony listened for a moment, not wanting to be disturbed by somebody. The others would stop him, no matter how good his arguments were, he could not allow that. Too much depended on it now. If he could safely get Pepper out of Burkwill's clutches, she would be protected and could undo any changes Tony had previously made known. She and the other agents would be saved, and Stark Industries would continue to have nothing to do with the war. Tony was about to stretch his foot out the window when he got an idea. Quietly he crept to the dusty cupboard and pulled it open. He smiled as he saw that there was really stuff left in here. An old wool sweater hung on a hanger, already completely moth-eaten, but down in the closet were two shoes.
"What did I say?" Burkwill was pleased and addressed some people who were still on the other side of the bridge, while Tony was still trying to fight off the alien. Someone clapped over there and the mechanic struggled against tears again.
Steve looked impressed at the dark, long expanse far ahead of him that was barely visible in the night. He had to squint his eyes to see it by the sea.
Tony could see landscapes, but also cities. Some pictures showed fantasy worlds, which the woman had probably painted, others even fight scenes, which could come directly from a comic, if you could not find Captain America himself in between. Tony grinned at Steve and pointed to the picture and the other’s eyebrow raised in confusion. Only then the woman turned to her and breathed in shock.
"He's a mendacious, filthy, disgusting piece of sh-" Tony shouted, earning amazed looks from his teammates, but Burkwill interrupted him.
"Do always several people watch one area?" Tony asked, rubbing his eyes. There were too few clues. How could a ship of this size go unnoticed to Toms River? He sighed.
"Then we were surprised by a landslide," Lang said, walking next to Wilson. "And it started to hail. We were attacked immediately. We escaped into a tunnel and were persecuted. As far as we know, we were able to eliminate our opponents, but down here we have hardly any reception and the way back is spilt. We'll find our way out, but if anyone sees this, SHIELD, Captain, Stark maybe, then send help. Our position should come with the message. I repeat," he continued, but the sound disappeared again.
I had no idea how to put “a several hundred meters” into something with feet, so I had to use yards. Even though I think that’s nothing Americans use.
Clint looked at him and his eyes clearly said that he was just getting to that point. "Burkwill is the leader of a company called SafetyWorld, at least he owns that company and founded it. You've probably heard of this organization before. Ironically, they make weapons to send to exactly one party in a war. In Europe they supported Serbia, in the Middle East the rebels in Syria, in Egypt they sent arms to inhabitants of the cities. They are regularly organizers of marches against US interference in wars or support from weapons, also from European countries."
Natasha was already on the next step when she turned around. "I'll go upstairs, then Mrs Lopez won’t have to wait that long."
life - and even he felt the emptiness strongly. Rhodey and Pepper had helped him and Wanda in the beginning, but they had not overcome Burkwill’s game unscathed, so Tony sent them to the East Coast last week to stay in a villa for two weeks together - "to see whether it’s worth buying."
“Hey.”  Tony breaks into Clint’s ever-extending monologue about his superior shooting skills, abruptly bringing the diatribe to a halt.  Tony stands at the edge of the decimated room, arms crossed, with a serious expression on his face.
And yet, he’s frozen, wondering how far Loki wants to take this in return for his silence. A kiss? An exchange of touches? A night in bed? Steve’s imagination is already racing with unwanted possibilities.
“That, and it’s a highly classified op.”  Fury adds, his one eye flicking toward Natasha in an unspoken warning.
Behind it is the wine cellar, deep and wide with a rather low ceiling. The walls are a dusty red brick and the room is lined with rack after wooden rack of glass bottles. The floor is cobblestone and the lights give the room a warm glow as if lit by firelight. Steve eyes the labels as he’d led through the labyrinth of the expensive collection, the names impressive and the dates even more so.
Bucky Barnes had wiped that smile from existence and Tony hadn’t been able to muster one since. He pushes the dark thoughts from his mind and focuses on the great news that made him grin in the first place.
“New Years.  It makes people do crazy things.”  He shrugs.  “Gotta have someone to kiss at midnight, right?”
“Don’t be sorry…” Steve trails off because he realizes Bucky is crying, tears streaming down his face.  That’s all it takes for everything within him to crack wide open.  All that he’s been trying to
“Did Natasha put you up to this?”  Steve asks when he suddenly seems to notice that Tony is, for a change, waiting for him to speak first.
“Cap, you gonna eat?” Jones calls, and Steve turns to see him and Dugan pulling some apple boxes up to sit, Morita lounging on the pavement with his feet propped up on a sandbag. Dernier and Falsworth are sharing a furnie blanket, which really, they shouldn’t have and shouldn’t be sitting on. They’re opening their metal lunch boxes and digging in to the meals lovingly prepared for them by their wives. Cold fried chicken and biscuits and ripe red apples, thermoses full of cool lemonade, and freshly baked cookies wrapped in wax paper.
“I’m not worried,” Tony lies, which hardly matters because Steve sees right through him, his touch stuttering to a stop before he pulls his hand away.
“Wait, that’s not okay?”  He puts a hand on Tony’s arm, stilling him.  He tries to act stunned.  “Is it just gay sex or all types of sex?”
“All right, all right, I’m going.” He gathers his coat and his fedora, dropping the light jacket over his forearm and donning the hat, tipping it up casually to sit high and loose on his forehead.
“But if you wanted to make that chicken and mashed potatoes thing you do for dinner, I wouldn’t complain.”
“I cannot believe these words are coming out of your mouth, Tash,” Clint chimes in with a snort.  “I never thought I’d see the day when you berated someone for not being a joiner.”
Steve’s momentarily confused, but then the waiter glances at Steve with a slightly panicked look that’s quickly masked by a polite, eager smile. Steve instantly knows that this is not about any wine cellar.
.” He’d refused to give Tony an explanation when he’d tossed him the stuffed toy, telling the man to figure it out himself.  Tony was the first person he’d thought of when he saw the crazy blue Muppet shooting himself out of a cannon.  When he’d agreed to make
“When I see something that I remember, and there it is, just as it was, I draw that too.”  There are less drawings of that variety, which pretty much says it all.  “It’s not exactly a coherent project.”
“So what you’re saying is, I shouldn’t trust Nat’s estimation of you and that beneath the goody-two-shoes Boy Scouts of America exterior, you’re actually a dirty rotten scoundrel?”  Tony defaults to sarcasm as always.  “’Cause I’m the resident cad on this team, I don’t know if we have room for two rakish bachelors.”
When he stands back upright, Steve nearly jumps out of his skin to see another reflection in the mirror beside his.
There’s something between them. Something that doesn’t exist between Steve and any of the others, not even Wilson or Romanoff. When Tony Stark is near, Steve burns brightly, burns fiercely. Whether it’s with joy or rage, he’s
Steve pivots slightly and glances at him. Tony can’t see Steve’s expression quite clearly, but the line of his jaw is tense.
“Yeah.”  Tony doesn’t sound at all convinced.  He holds a hand out into the open, palm toward the sky.  “We should probably get back before the sky really opens up.”
“Tony? Let me take care of it, okay?” Steve cuts him off. He lets go and backs toward the door, knowing that any second that same PA will have to come back and retrieve him if he doesn’t get going soon. “It will be nice. I promise.”
Steve knows he’s supposed to turn Tony around, bring him back in so they’re face to face, but his hand’s gone clammy and his fingers slip through Tony’s.  He ends up letting go and Tony stumbles.
Steve sighs, feeling guilty for causing concern. He should have stayed at home rather than ruin Sam’s night with unnecessary worry.
“Man, Barnes, you just never give up, do you?” Tony asks, probably wondering if this game between Bucky and Natasha will ever come to an end.
“What is this one, is this stereoscopic? Interesting, very interesting. 3D film tech really could use some improvements, or it’s never gonna catch on. I mean, over twenty years and still no one can quite make it easy or cheap enough to use in
“Or you can sub in,” Natasha suggests, already picking up her black duffel bag from by the mirrored wall.  “I’m needed at HQ at 1600.”
“And my work here is done.”  Tony grins, pushing up from his seat.  “Meeting at Chez Avengers tomorrow at three.  Pepper will remind you it’s at three, JARVIS will remind you it’s at three, but I won’t, because I’ll probably have forgotten it by then myself.  Wait, what time was it again?”
“Because I’d surely never be able to tell time otherwise.”  Her tone is bone dry.  She sets a hand on his shoulder.  “However, it’s something you apparently need a refresher on.”
, your best friend would jump at the chance to see you again?  No.  In fact he locked himself up just to make sure you couldn’t get to him.  So, me, I wonder, what the hell did you
“Everyone’s fine, Cap.  You saw us all, right?  Just some bumps and bruises.  Stop looking like that.”
His hands find Steve’s hips and then slide down over his ass, cupping his cheeks and lifting and pushing Steve up and onto his own lap. His legs dangle on either side of Tony’s body, his hands going to Tony’s shoulders to steady himself after the abrupt shift.
He honestly does wonder if Steve really ever got to enjoy this on any other terms than fulfilling his dreams of patriotic service to his country.  He wonders if Steve and Bucky ever mapped out Steve’s body like new terrain, plotting tactical moves across the landscape of his skin.  Tony wants to know every inch of him and he can’t possibly imagine Barnes ever passed up the chance to do the same.
Steve runs a hand through his hair, unusually messy from both the wind and from Tony’s fingers, and then he glances at Tony.  Any trace of desire, of arousal, is long gone and in its place is just sadness.
She’s still not his favorite person in the world, he has to admit that, but he does feel slightly bad for her misfortune.  The Winter Soldier may love her, but Bucky Barnes will choose Steve Rogers.  Anyone in their right mind would choose Steve Rogers, were he an option.  He’s sure she knows that just as well as he does.
He catches Steve’s eye over Pepper’s shoulder, gives him a wink.  Steve smiles softly and then looks away.  He doesn’t look back.
“Stark…?”  Comes a weak voice down by his right foot.  A bloody hand reaches up from the rubble, grabbing onto his ankle.
Steve, he barely knew. Steve, with his broad shoulders and tight ass, those blue eyes and that deep voice, and that fucking beard…
“Yeah, not even Jarvis is here anymore, just lil’ ol’ me, Charles Foster Kane in his hall of mirrors.” Tony goes to the bar and starts mixing two more drinks. He wishes he could ring for champagne, but again—just him. “This is a reason to celebrate. A toast to the happy couple!”
He shuts Steve’s bedroom door carefully behind him when he tiptoes out to the hall, wincing even at the soft noise of it closing. The light is still on in the kitchen, Steve having forgotten to turn it off in their haste for his bedroom. Tony flips the switch, plunging the entire apartment into near darkness, as he passes toward the front door.
“Well, Steve’s reluctance to hit me isn’t based on him viewing me as a wilting flower in need of protection.  He knows I can hold my own.  But he respects women and that’s not misogynistic, it’s simply…nice.”
Though it’s the last thing he wants to do, Steve forces himself to get off the couch, awkwardly but carefully keeping his shirts clear of his dirty skin while also managing to keep his pants from falling around his ankles. With an undignified shuffle, he sidles by Tony and into the narrow bathroom.
“I met one of ‘em once.  I was like, oh, maybe eight, nine?  I was at Macy’s with my mom and you were there.  Well, not you, but ‘you’.  I thought it was pretty awesome at the time, got my picture taken and everything.  Of course, dear old dad threw it in the fire, or else I’d pull it out and we’d have a good laugh over it now.”  Tony needs to stop talking but he can’t find the off switch.  Every word out of his mouth is making things worse.  These aren’t things he means to share or that Steve needs to hear.  He picks his fork back up and moves what’s left of his eggs around the plate.   “You’re better.  I mean…not like I sit around rating Captain Americas or anything – ”
Peggy have told her?” There’s much wiggling of eyebrows, a bit of wagging tongue.  Steve ignores the antics.
“Did we have good sense then?” Steve asks, the question sounding half-serious. He looks down at Steve, pondering the same thing. Would it have been good sense to say something back then about the way his heart thuds in his chest whenever Steve smiles at him? Would everything have gone differently if he had?
Steve pushes away from the window and turns to survey the empty room.   Legs feeling heavy, he turns off the solitary lamp that had been left on and in the darkness, sits down on the oversized couch.
Bucky’s glance ticks toward the window where New York City stands proudly to welcome them.  His blue eyes spark with something akin to recognition but then the light dims, flickers out entirely.
is, exactly. Peggy had been slightly vague on the details. He’d been surprised by her call in the first place, not having heard from her in going on two years. He may have agreed to the meeting partially because he’d been so happy to hear her lovely British lilt after such a long time apart.
have come back upstairs and realized you and your old-but-new best buddy were still talking, and perhaps hovered for a moment until I was sure I would no longer be interrupting.  I was actually being thoughtful.”
“Steve, babe?” His tone has shifted, turning soft. He comes to the couch and he’s taking Bucky’s spot before Bucky knows what’s going on. He’s gently pushed aside, Tony insinuating himself right by Steve’s side.
Steve doesn’t know what he was expecting but when he steps inside, he’s a little surprised.  The apartment is very straightforward and simple, and nearly empty.  A small kitchenette to the right, the living room forward to the left.  A short hallway leads down to what he supposes must be the bedroom.  The ceilings are high, and the far living room wall is nothing but windows.  It’s all done up in varying shades of brown and rich blue, the furniture solid and plain.  The floors are all dark hardwood, polished to a shine.  There are no decorations on the walls, no books on the bookshelves.
“I'm about all full up on Bucky's 'thoughts' for now, thank you.” Tony replies, voice tight, and then he glances at his wristwatch and huffs. “As fun as this has been, I'm due to meet Bruce in five.”
Tony can’t tell if Steve truly blushes that deeply red or if it just appears that way because the man’s so uncommonly pale today.  Either way, it’s a nice change of pace to see him color with something besides anger and annoyance.
anyway, and in his mind he’s already halfway through peeling those trunks down and wrapping his mouth around Steve’s cock before he catches himself fantasizing.
His orgasm hits him so hard that he nearly blacks out. If Tony wasn’t pinned between two of the strongest men he’s ever known, his own body may have collapsed from the sheer force of the pleasure that surges through him. All at once, he’s floating above himself, somewhere outside consciousness, while being simultaneously grounded, feeling more
“Not romantically.” Bucky states quickly, decisively. He frowns, not exactly with distaste, but with something more akin to resignation. “But…Steve, we all see each other constantly. We live in the same building, we work on the same team…and he and I have basically tolerated each other’s existence. All because of this unspoken
His hair is slicked back with pomade, his moustache and goatee sharply trimmed. His black tuxedo cuts a neat line down his lithe body, white shirt crisp and pressed and black bowtie perfectly straight. He’s the one who looks like a movie star, holding a smile, holding a martini, and holding court. A group of giggling blonde starlets surround him, a sea of sparkle and sequins that shimmer in the warm lobby lights.
“Are you all right?  I mean…should I call Miss Potts?”  His eyes seem more clear and blue when he’s concerned, even though Tony
“All my ideas are good ideas.”  Tony retorts a bit belatedly, slipping his card back into his wallet.  He cannot remember the last time he had to buy things like these for himself.  Hell, he can’t remember being in a Walgreens before.  It’s a rather miserable place.
“The last time I visited this fine establishment, Preston kindly offered me a tour of the wine cellar. I wondered if I might make use of that offer now?”
“I'm not judging, Tony, and I'll never breathe a word of it, I promise.” Carol assures him, even though he kind of already knows that, even if he's not in the right mood to admit it. “You can trust me—you know you can.”
For once, he’s not carefully put together, not smoothed over or pressed and proper, and all can Tony can think is how much he wants to pull Steve close and demolish every last vestige of decorum.
“Exactly how long have you lived in New York again?”  Natasha sounds as disbelieving as Natasha can sound.  She glances at Thor, who is currently downing his second glass of fresh squeezed orange juice as if he were chugging a beer at Oktoberfest.  It’s clear that Clint is her only hope.  “Trust me.  Going with me will be better than going anywhere
He wants Steve to strip him and take him right there – pick him up and fuck him against the door while Tony watches it reflected back from three different angles.
“You’re welcome, fancypants,” Tony pipes over the comm, doing a quick victory swirl around Clint before jetting upward to get another full aerial view of the pieces at play.  From what he can gather, the creatures seem to have some kind of breathing apparatus over their faces, like gas masks with hoses running down to canisters on their belts.  The most important piece of that observation is that hitting those canisters makes them explode, something that Natasha has picked up on and is using to her advantage.
“What are you doing here, Stark?  If they sent you here to bring me in, you can tell them all to go to hell.”
“No, I think I specifically asked for you to take all that out and burn it.  Light it up.” He sits back upright, searching his desk for a moment until he locates the fresh box of cigars that his best friend, Rhodey, brought back from his last trip to Cuba. “Just get rid of it, I don’t want to see that shit.”
“You swear a lot more too.”  Tony’s mouth twitches a little, like he’s fighting a smile, and Steve’s really had it.  He moves to get up but Tony moves too.  He puts a hand on Steve’s bicep and tugs him back.  His touch is warm against Steve’s damp skin. “Hey, c’mon.  I like it.”
“Here we are, Chateau Marmont.” Happy announces as he slows to a gentle stop in front of the shaded entrance to the hotel, marked by white stone walls and a small sign that one could easily pass by if one weren’t looking closely. The building itself is hard to miss, however, the gothic architecture reminiscent of a small, strange castle – part French, part L.A., and, Steve thinks, wholly out of place.
“Here.”  Is all Steve says, setting the box down and flipping open the lid.  He takes a piece of pizza for himself and pulls up a stool.  Tony stays stock-still, outright staring as Steve folds the slice and pretty much demolishes most of it in a few bites.
“You leaving?”  Tony can’t help but ask and Bucky smiles sardonically, like he knows Tony would love that.
The last time Steve had been in that particular car, Tony had been with him. They'd parked up on a hill overlooking the city—some place surely illegal to pull off on the shoulder and just
Steve putters to a slow stop, angling his moped into something that technically isn’t a parking spot, but is in actuality a convenient gap between a Prius and a Smart Car.  He’s learned from experience that he has to sneak any space he can get that’s big enough to fit his bike.  Parking, even in Astoria, is getting just as bad as anywhere in Brooklyn these days.  So much for Queens being more low key.
Pushing the waste of a project he’s been failing on all day off the holo desktop and into the trash, he shuts the screen down and storms out of the workshop.  He doesn’t come back.
Tony remains silent beside him, but Bucky can hear him breathing, slowly, in and out, like he’s purposefully measuring them out.
“Tony,” Steve starts, a hint of something like worry in his voice, and Tony quickly lifts his head and captures Steve in a kiss.
”  Steve nearly shouts.  It’s enough to finally stop Tony in his tracks, if only because he’s genuinely taken aback.  That wasn’t a Captain command.  That was Steve yelling, and he’s never actually heard
It’s still a few minutes of tense silence before he hears the door slide open and closed, loud against the quiet.  He lifts his head.
Tony has stepped away from his pumpkin and rounded in on Steve, messy hands extended.  Steve sets down his knife and backs away from Tony’s attempt to wipe them down the front of his shirt.  He doesn’t move fast enough, probably because he doesn’t
“I’ll be quick as I can.” Steve opens up the door and turns to go into his trailer. “I’ll just gather my things and be right there, Miss Van Dyne.”
“And we figured since you’re the only one puttering around this whole mansion, we’d be okay in here.” Rhodey looks down at their entwined hands, then gestures around the spacious room. The house is crowded with furniture and expensive décor, but his whole life, Tony's felt the place to be empty.
“The palladium core was poisoning my bloodstream.  But, then I made vibranium to replace it, and all was well.”  Tony says this a little too casually, like he knows the fact he was once
“Well, considering your system upgrade happened in 1943, Steve, your software might be a bit out of date.  A little extra virus protection never hurt anyone.”  Steve looks at him blankly, not amused.  “What, computer jokes not your speed?  Just humor me, you oaf, and don’t sit on that thing half-naked?  I don’t want to explain to Fury how you picked up the clap.”
“Oh, no, of course not.  That’s not- I mean, you’re more than welcome.” Steve hurries to assure her and Tony has to grin at his awkwardness.  He’d question how Steve ever bagged Peggy Carter with such an amazing lack of skill but he knows the effect it’s having on him and he figures he’s as immune to adorability as they come, so Peggy probably never stood a chance.
“Bucky…” Tony starts, actually reaching for his hand out to touch him, and there’s such pity in his voice that it makes Bucky see red.
Steve re-opens the pad and tears out his failed attempt.  The sound of ripping paper is oddly soothing.  He doesn’t know why, but he carefully folds the drawing in quarters before moving to throw it away.   He’ll come back some other day and try again, maybe when his nerves are less shot.
“But it’s not a problem with a solution; just something I have to learn to live with.  It’s probably best I keep this matter to myself from now on.”
, is all he’d said, with a sad shrug of acceptance.  Since Steve hasn’t caught as much as a glimpse of Tony since that first night in his hospital room, Tony must be wholly wrapped up in whatever they’re devising to sort Bucky out.
“Exactly, you’re the producer. So I don’t think you want us falling behind,” Steve counters, covering Tony’s hand with his, stilling it. “Besides, how would we explain it, me taking off with you to New York all of a sudden?”
of it.  Was everything between them so fragile that his temporary and unwilling absence could destroy it?
“Ah, I see.”  Steve’s words are tight and clipped and Tony recognizes immediately where he just went wrong.
It’s when Steve stands up and stretches, working a kink out of his back from being hunched over on a metal stool for hours, that Tony breaks.  The sight of Steve’s thin t-shirt riding up and revealing the waistband of his underwear peeking out from the top of his jeans, the sharp cut of his hips showing and his abs flexing as he stretches – it’s like an old Calvin Klein ad come to life right in his workshop and he can’t fucking stand it.
“It’s encouraging that your grasp of technology is improving, Cap, but no.” He starts distractedly leafing through Steve’s drawings again.  It takes everything Steve’s got not to grab his sketchbook from Tony’s hands.  “Bruce told me.”
“Seven. Seven times,” Steve barely gets out before Tony is on him again, this time lying on top of him and kissing his neck. The feel of Tony’s fully clothed body on his naked one sets all his nerve endings afire, and something about the glaring difference in their state of undress arouses him even more. “And twice in my mouth. Once all over my chest.”
“Fuck me,” Tony whispers, breaking from him to turn around and bend over the sink. “Fuck me so I feel it for days, Steve. I want to think about you every damn time I move.”
“Yeah, let’s watch that.”  The channel switches without Tony moving a muscle.  “You seen this yet, Steve?  You’ll like it.”  He settles back against the cushions and Steve sits up.  He wants to sputter about the remote, but he can’t find the right words to ask why Tony had to get so needlessly close if JARVIS could control the television that whole time.  “What?”  Tony asks him, taking in the look on his face and acting at a loss as to what it’s about.
“Pete’s fine. Right, Pete? This—” He gestures between him and Steve. “Stays between us.” He gestures between all three of them.
And it’s true, that Howard Stark had helped the OWI and Hollywood to finance some wartime propaganda, propaganda that Steve had in fact starred in. He’s not ashamed, per se, but there are other things he’d rather be remembered for than his brief - though ultimately useful - foray into acting.
He starts fucking Steve painstakingly slowly. His own boxers are shoved down just to his thighs and he still has his own t-shirt on, and even though Steve’s naked from the waist down, his tee is rucked up underneath his armpits. Tony considers stopping and taking Steve properly back to bed, but he doesn’t want to pull out long enough to make that happen.
“I’m sorry, Captain, but it is.”  Fury doesn’t really sound all that sorry.  “James Barnes was brainwashed by General Lukin’s team of scientists and trained up as Russia’s favorite secret weapon.  They only brought him out for special occasions-“
"What if I were?" Tony asks, and for a moment Steve thinks he's serious.  His heart does this weird fluttery thing all on its own, like it's stopping and re-starting independent of any interference from his mind.
“Oh, okay.”  Steve frowns, wounded, and Tony feels bad, which makes him really want to punch something.  How does Steve have the power to do this to him with just a look?
“Tony…” Steve breathes, and Tony throws his head back against the wall, letting Steve’s lips sear a path down the arch of his neck.  They’re going to be amazing together.  If he’d known it would be this easy to fall into, he would’ve taken the risk sooner.
“Well.  You’ve got a bit more perspective.”  Steve nudges Bucky with his shoulder and Bucky nudges him back.
“You want to watch that one after we finish this?" Tony asks, nodding to the film Steve just put aside.
Steve stands from where he’d been bent down by the side of his bike.  He’s stripped down to a pair of weather beaten jeans and a dirt-streaked, formerly white tank.  A few days’ worth of beard obscures his sharp jaw line, a shade darker than his unusually messy blonde hair.  There’s a streak of motor oil on his left bicep, a smudge above his right brow.  His dog tags hang loose outside of his shirt, glinting in the sunlight, and it strikes Tony that it’s the first time he’s ever seen Steve wearing them.
. He barely talks to me, and when he does, he doesn’t look me in the eye. He’s not sleeping, though he’s pretending that he’s fine. If I try to talk to him about any of it, he insists he’s right as rain. He’s pulling long hours and hiding at Natasha’s and I just…don’t get it.”
“I know what the serum can do better than anyone, Buck,” Steve smiles down at him. “And there’s no hurry.”
“Uh, isn’t that kind of what you do?” Tony narrows his eyes at Bruce, lowering his phone for a moment.  “You haven’t stayed in one place for more than –”
As he slides the pan onto one of the cold burners, he considers asking exactly what Tony had shared with Pepper about what happened on the fire escape.
“I want to talk to him.”  Someone interrupts, a voice that Tony doesn’t know.  But Fury draws his gun instantly, training it on the man now standing behind Tony.
He kisses Steve deeply, mouths slanting and tongues tangling, and he pushes his body against Steve’s with the kind of lack of restraint he hasn’t shown since Steve became small again. And Steve reacts like he’s been dying for it, like he had been waiting for Tony to pin him to the bed and fuck him into the mattress.
“Let me know when that happens,” Steve replies, turning back to his set design and picking up his pen. The drawing can probably still be salvaged if he can figure a way to mask that errant mark, erase the newsprint smudges. Behind him, Bucky sighs, but Steve doesn’t look.
“You’re such a New Yorker.  Everything here is better than everywhere else.” Tony sing-songs wryly.  His accompanying grin is infectious.
Steve is in the small area by the windows set aside as his makeshift studio, his broad back to Tony as he leans in toward the large canvas.  He’s wearing his favorite shirt for painting, a stretched and faded Sonic Youth tank that he’s had since he was a teen, and the loosest and oldest pair of jeans he owns, back pockets torn and knees ripped, edges frayed.  Paint, charcoal and dirt seem blended right into the dark denim.  Tony watches the muscles in his arms shifting appealingly as Steve makes broad, sweeping brushstrokes in bold red.
“Tony.”  Steve leans back in the too-small booth, crossing his arms over his chest.  Tony tries his coffee again, finding it now too sweet.
“Did the arc reactor leave a scar?” He knows the question seems apropos of nothing, but Tony only hesitates a second before going with it.
“Except it doesn’t work.  It worked once, on Steve, and that’s it.” Tony doesn’t even know what he’s doing really – he’s mapping everything he’s culled on the Red Room, the screen dotted with pins marking former bases, safe houses, past incidents and most recent sightings of General Lukin.  It’s all a moot point if these aren’t the guys that grabbed Steve.  Even if they
They don’t get that far, however, both of them coming far too quickly in messy, hot splashes across Steve’s stomach and chest. He keeps kissing Steve until he stops trembling, regains control of his breath.
.” Steve gestures between their bodies, not quite able to say aloud that Tony wants him around simply because they’ve had unbelievably fantastic sex.
Steve shrugs and smirks, maybe wanting to keep something in his back pocket for a later time.  There are only so many ways to keep Tony Stark on his toes.
“Right.”  None of this seems to make Tony less troubled.  He pauses.  “I heard you got pretty banged up though.  Burned the skin right off your hands by playing the hero.”
He hands them their glasses and retrieves his from atop the piano, lifting it in their direction. Then he gestures toward the sofa, inviting them to sit. He sprawls out on his mother’s old chaise lounge, the pink velvet soft and worn to the touch.
“Yes, you should have thought. I’ve been out all morning looking for you, you know that? I called all our friends, your crew – hell, I even called Pegs.”
is a problem I can resolve quite easily.” Steve pushes up from his chair, his voice gone rigid. “I’ll see myself out. Good night, Mr. Stark.”
“Not.  Helping.”  Natasha grits out, and then focuses her attention back at on Steve.  “Really, Cap, what’s it going to take to get you up in the tower?  Another world crisis?”
“It’s just one project.  Doesn’t mean it’ll affect you and Nat, doesn’t mean it will affect me and my crew.”
Tony isn’t aware of anything except Steve until he feels Bucky move into position behind him, the heat and weight of Bucky’s strong body solid against the backs of his thighs. Bucky slides his hard cock between Tony’s cheeks, the head nestled against the small of Tony’s back.
!” Steve kids, joining her in laughter. He has absolutely no recollection of this. By Pittsburgh, the crowds were a blur.
“We were afraid you might have given up your territory,” Clint remarks, practically vaulting over the counter and onto one of the bar stools near where Tony stands.  “Since the tower’s been overrun with crazyass superheroes.”
“Wow, Stark, any excuse,” Sam says as he stumbles blearily from the co-pilot seat and down toward the exit ramp.  He pauses to inadvisably kick at Bruce’s cot, startling him awake.  Tony looks up at Steve, expecting to find him blushing over the taunt, but Steve only wraps a hand in the loose material of the front of his sweatshirt and hauls him upward.
“Are you real particular about those sleeping arrangements?”  He knows his playful leer is a little too lascivious for mixed company in Steve’s usual estimation, but Steve seems too tired to care.  “My bed’s twice as big and could use a little warming.”
His blue eyes are narrowed against the bright reflection off the ocean, his pale cheeks warming pink in the afternoon sun. The wind gently caresses his blonde hair, strands kissing his forehead.
"According to you, I didn’t actually quote it, but, okay…" Tony allows it, going down without more of fight.  Steve starts to ask where they're headed to, as they seem just to be circling the park aimlessly, when he hears Tony softly humming the tune under his breath.  Tony notices him noticing and his answering smile is surprisingly shy.
Tony walks over to him slowly. He takes the glass from Steve’s hands and sets it on the counter; Steve doesn’t protest. Cupping Steve’s face in his hands, Tony tilts his head upward. Steve doesn’t resist. His gaze is soft as he meets Tony’s eyes.
“Buck and I went exploring quite a bit when we first moved here. The beach is quiet, and we took a fancy to that diner down the way. Serves breakfast all day.” Steve nods his head toward the bright yellow building perched on an overlook just down the way, the green and white signage reading
Steve doesn’t mean to be rude but he can’t help it.  He feels unmoored if he can’t find Tony in the crowd, cast away in a sea of unfamiliar faces smiling at him as if they’re all the best of friends.
He’s seen these weaknesses play out for others before and it never ends well, but the emotions come, ceaselessly, wave after wave after wave.
have known this wasn’t a simple dinner between pals. Bucky and Natasha might not be together at the moment, but they’re still thought of as a pair by others, and that means that Steve was the only one invited that’s not half of a two. A setup was practically a foregone conclusion. “I may not have been told in advance but I can’t say as I’m surprised.”
“It’s actually very interesting but I think I’m wiped out, gonna head for bed.”  He gathers his things, pausing to give both Clint and Sam a weighted look clearly meant to telegraph
“Hold up, Barnes.” Tony cuts him off, and then he winces for some reason Bucky doesn’t understand. “I mean, Bucky. Uh…stay a minute, please. We need to talk.”
It hits him then that not only does he not know what to make for dinner, he doesn’t know where to go or when to go there.
Tony’s kiss stops Steve from protesting; if he’s about to defend Bucky’s honor, Tony doesn’t want to hear it.  He has things of his own he needs to say.
He gets Steve on his back, head angled at the corner of the couch, and kneels between Steve’s parted legs like a man in prayer. Steve
“What?”  Steve asks, breathless and bewildered.  His head is spinning.  He reaches for Tony but Tony’s too far away.
There are little, incomplete pieces with barely any context to help sort them out. Flashes of Steve’s shy, crooked smile; a gash above his eyebrow; a tear rolling down his pale cheek; the feel of newly strong arms around Bucky’s waist, holding him up.
Tony takes his time setting the torch down, pretending it’s precaution, and then flips up the face mask before taking it off completely.  He puts it aside and wipes his brow.
Steve starts to say no, the response automatic, but then re-considers.  What else is he going to do?
“Worked the Food Bank all day up in the Bronx with Sam…  I stopped off on the way home and got some of the rugelach from Lee Lee’s that you like.  It’s…” Steve yawns.  “It’s in my bedroom, though, so Clint doesn’t eat it all.”
. Beautiful, lonely Steve Rogers. I’ve been watching you, from afar, for some time now. You must know that.” He reaches up with one finger and traces the line of Steve’s frown. Steve tries not to flinch, not wanting to show Loki even one slight sign of weakness. “As much as I would love to ruin that pompous Stark, I would rather ruin you in other, more…
“Damn it!”  Steve mutters, taking the kettle off with his left hand while he shakes the right.  Tony hurries to the sink and turns on the cold tap.
“I was with Tony Stark,” Steve admits, and just for a moment considers letting that lay there between them for Bucky to interpret as he may. The panic quickly surges through him, however, and he stammers forward with more information. “He wanted to talk business over dinner. Dinner turned into drinks and before I knew it, it was really late – too late – and I thought it best to take a room at the hotel rather than stumble home drunk. I didn’t want to wake you.”
to be grated Parmesan.  The container joins the tableaux with typical Darcian flourish.  “Dinner is served.”
“Downloaded everything ten minutes ago.”  Steve has to laugh.  He closes his eyes against the sound of it, finding it only slightly bitter.  Tony is just so…Tony.  “And here I thought my last few months were rough.”
“I came with four fingers in my ass, thinking about you. It was a poor substitute for the real thing.”
When Bucky looks at him now, Tony feels that gaze critically taking him apart, breaking him into pieces.
“As long as you don’t expect me to cook, lovely, I’m happy as a clam right here.” She folds her carefully manicured hands on the tabletop, smiling up at him. “Now, where’s that handsome fella you live with?” She casts her gaze about the apartment behind her as if expecting Bucky to appear.
She smiles weakly before lifting on tiptoe to place a soft kiss against his cheek.  There are tears in her eyes when she steps back.
He frantically tries plan B, accessing the city’s power grid and seeing if these jack-offs got the power knocked off through Con Ed’s main terminal or if they did something manual on site.   If it’s been blown to hell, there’s not much he can do about that from here.
“Right.”  Tony snaps out of it.  He’s halfway into the MARK VI when Pepper hurries into the lab barefoot, evidently having ditched her heels somewhere along the way in the name of expediency.
“One of the benefits of living out here is the privacy,” Tony announces his arrival, gesturing around to the broad swath of nothing that surrounds his oceanside mansion. “You might have a hard time getting a taxi.”
Tony pulls himself from the mire of self-doubt and grins at Steve as he sits down across from him.  Steve has a polite Cub Scout Leader smile on his face from interacting with the good common folk, and it lasts for a moment longer before slowly fading.
Tony watches silently as Happy circles the car around – Steve assiduously looking anywhere but out the window at Tony – then starts back toward downtown. As the car rounds the last curve of the driveway and the taillights disappear, Tony’s legs give. He simply sinks to the ground.
Sam is still looking at him with those earnest eyes of his, clearly not believing a good night’s sleep is going to solve much of anything.
“Went down to Rivington and guess what, Streit’s is still there. Got some fresh matzo and made some soup special, just like Mrs. Goldberg used to. Down in 4A, remember her?”
Steve cups the side of his face with one hand, thumb brushing over his cheek.  The other falls to Tony’s waist, steady and firm, not pushing but guiding Tony closer.
“Between you and Wilson, I’m running out of avian-related ammo.  If you want original insults, get a more original name.”
“Someday I want to lick you clean after he’s been inside you.” Tony barely pulls back enough to mumble the words against his thigh. “He did come inside you, right?”
The cloakroom does have a jacket in his size, it seems, so after Steve is made appropriately presentable they’re lead through the lounge, past the cozy brown leather banquettes and red leather armchairs and into a dining room that looks nothing like Steve expected.  Vintage toys and signed memorabilia hang from the low ceiling and despite many lamps and candles, the place is dark and slightly cramped.
“It was just one night, Tony. Do you think we’re crazy?” Steve asks, quiet and thoughtful. Tony grins widely.
follow that up with a lewd come-on of sorts. When Natasha had told him that he would need a daringly bold woman, he thinks she may have conjured Darcy into existence.
“Just follow her,” Clint shrugs when Steve looks at him questioningly.  “It’s so much easier than trying to resist.”
Tony doesn’t manage to stifle a laugh at the thought of someone like Natasha having a “boyfriend” and that “boyfriend” being an assassin kept in high security prison by SHIELD.  Steve doesn’t react to his chuckle, and he doesn’t know if that says more about Steve’s perspective on him or on the situation.  Steve probably thinks Tony’s just the kind of person to be coldly amused over this kind of thing.
He releases a long, deep breath as soon as he’s in the safety of the bathroom, alone. It’s then he realizes he’s still holding the paper. It’s not the news, but one of those silly gossip rags that he never reads.
They’re both watching their bodies, seemingly fascinated by the way their muscles move as they fuck, or maybe by the way Bucky’s hard cock bobs as Bucky lifts and lowers himself to meet Steve’s upward thrusts, his thighs straining with the effort.  Neither of them touch Bucky’s leaking dick, and the way it flops about untouched might be comical if not for the way that threads of pre-come drip thickly down his length while stray droplets splatter over Steve’s chest. The muscled rise of his pecs and the ridges of abs are already shiny and slick with evidence of Bucky’s arousal.
For now, he obliges Steve’s silent request the old-fashioned way, breaking their rhythm to slip out of the tee as quickly as possible.  Steve’s hands travel the expanse of his bare back, up and then back down, fingers dipping into his back jeans pockets rather promisingly.
Tony spends the rest of the night there, falling asleep slumped at the base of Steve’s sculpture.  He wakes up to Happy’s confused face, bending down over him as he’s jostled awake.
“Why ever not? This Tony Stark is quite a powerful man, from my understanding. Would it not be beneficial to have him as a business associate, and perhaps a friend?” Thor glances between Steve and Bucky, genuinely perplexed.
“I've never seen you in properly tailored clothes, Steven, those boxy detective costumes were so loose and so drab. Do allow me to appreciate my fine work.” Jan bats her long, dark eyelashes up at him, her grin coy. She purses her lips in an air kiss as she gracefully rises from the floor and takes a few steps back to look him over fully. “And to gloat, a little, perhaps. While the raw material is admittedly strong, I do believe I have improved it.”
“Do you want…?” He trails off, but Steve knows what Bucky is asking. And in answer he’s rolling his hips to meet Bucky’s before he realizes that’s what he’s doing.
“Fuck, Steve.” Tony buries his face against Steve’s neck, his free hand twining with both of Steve’s over Steve’s chest. His other hand keeps stroking Steve inside his boxers as their bodies writhe like two over eager teenagers discovering what it’s like to rub off against someone for the first time.
“It’s true.” Bucky replies quickly, nearly talking over the end of Steve’s sentence. “It’s been true since the day my ma explained what this kinda love was and I finally had a word to put to that feeling I got whenever I looked at you.”
He’s gathering the items needed for dinner when Jan returns, letting herself in through the front screen door without knocking.
He ends up going to the board meeting the next day, if only to have a handy excuse to turn down Steve’s invitation to join him and Bucky at the batting cages.  The last thing he needs is an image of Steve in a baseball shirt, biceps bulging, as he makes perfect swing after perfect swing.   The pair would probably spend the time waxing nostalgic for the days of the Dodgers at Ebbets Field and gazing at one another adoringly. Tony’s not sad to miss it.
“We could go out tomorrow instead,” Steve suggests, surprised at his gumption for asking.  Tony usually calls the shots as far as their activities go.  “Probably something fascinating playing at Anthology.”
He imagines it will be far easier to make this walk now than it would have been back then, when he was small and weak.  Back then, when the winter cold would make his asthma kick up just as surely as the spring pollen and the summer heat.
“What was that?” Steve asks, glancing off toward the darkness beyond Tony’s property, where the lights from the pool and patio can’t reach.
“What up, welcome to the jungle,” Darcy flicks a two-finger salute Pepper’s direction and Pepper nods, offering a small smile.
“Anywhere you want.” Tony reaches and tucks a finger under Steve’s chin, gently tapping and tilting Steve’s face upward. “Anywhere.”
“Nope.” Steve pops the ‘p’, shaking his head. “Haven’t seen him.” As a matter of fact, he’s seen little of Bucky for the past two weeks. His best friend has been edgy and distant, spending long hours at the office and going out with Natasha in the evenings more often than not.
“My girl, you mean.” Tony shoves the cloth in the back pocket of his denims, the tattered fabric too dirty to help much. There’s still oil smeared black on his thumb. He starts to reach out and wipe it on the sleeve of Rhodey’s leather bomber jacket, but Rhodey knows him too well, backing away quickly. Tony winds up wiping it clean on the front of the already worn white tank underneath his own unbuttoned bowling shirt. “And you’re the one who wrecked her, Rhodes, so maybe you shouldn’t be lecturing
“Hey, there you are.” Tony’s voice is warm and gentle. He tentatively moves closer. “Can I…?” He stops just before putting a hand on Steve’s bare knee. Unable to get the words out, Steve nods his okay. Tony’s touch is surprisingly soothing, and Steve finds himself twisting his fingers up with Tony’s with a quickness that borders on desperation.
They’re still kissing at the top of the world when the fireworks begin, red white and blue sparks lighting the night sky.  If the timing had happened with anyone else, Steve knows Tony would’ve rolled his eyes and called it a little too on the nose.
do this again sometime soon.” She waves back at them, and then almost walks through the screen door.
“They were supposed to be back yesterday, Pepper.   I know I’m not known for my punctuality, but even in my book, that’s late.”
Steve glances back at Tony as if he’s going to say something else, but he only lets his gaze linger for a moment before ducking into the car.
“I’d love some air – it’s growing quite warm in here, don’t you think? Steve, perhaps I could show you the veranda?” Jane rises as well, her hand curling over his forearm. She’s already leading him from the room.
“I’ve been to the tower a few times.”  Steve rolls up his shirtsleeves and folds his leather jacket over his arm.  It’s warm out still; he’d forgotten how the city streets bake in the summer heat.  It’s funny though – he’s not really sweating so much as he feels like he
to be Steve’s idea.  He wonders if the place is still standing.  Even he can’t afford to replace an entire building full of priceless works of art.
“It’s copasetic, Cap.”  Tony holds open the cab door and Steve reluctantly climbs in, half afraid Tony’s going to slam the door behind him and send him back to the hotel alone.  He may have said he could go back on his own, but he doesn’t want to leave Tony on this note.  To his relief, Tony gets in after him.
“Did I tell you I’m going to name my band after you?  I’m hopping on the no vowel bandwagon - NTSH!” Bucky shouts as he follows her toward the stairs, her only response being to extend her arm back and flick him the middle finger without looking.
“Did you forget what I looked like while I was gone?  Last time you stared at my ass this long, Stark, you thought I was your PA.”
Jane Odinsson is slight and delicate, and her often-reserved demeanor and restrained elegance might lead one to misread her entirely. Touch on the right topic or offer an ill-conceived opinion, and Jane turns feisty.
“Let me fetch a bottle of wine and then I’ll be right back over,” Jan tells him as she pulls the car to a stop along the curb in front of his and Bucky’s apartment. She flounces across the street toward her own place, her stole drooping from her shoulder.
In the end, he doesn’t mind. He’s a big idea guy. Well, he’s a details guy too. He can see the grandiose big picture and the nuances of the small picture, but Pepper’s just really good at getting everything out of his way so he doesn’t get bogged down in the daily minutiae that don’t directly relate to whatever’s on his mind at the moment.
Tony glances toward the beach cottages behind him, their ocean-facing sides lifted on wooden pylons. They’re ramshackle huts compared to his home, which is a mere twelve miles up the coastline at Point Dume.
“Eh.”  He shrugs instead, pretending not to care.  He’s unable to keep himself from smiling at Bucky’s mock indignation.  They both chuckle and Bucky picks up Steve’s carving knife, handing it to him handle first.
“Stevie here graciously invited me over for a meal. Very neighborly of him, don’t you think, Jimmy?”
Bucky nods and then finishes descending the stairs, looking back to give him a small wave as he crosses the lawn and heads off for the streetcar himself.
Steve only manages a nod and a weak smile, sensing something has drastically changed between them in the time he was gone.  Tony is keeping his gaze carefully just off-center, not quite meeting his eyes.  He wishes Tony would touch him, maybe take his hand the way Bucky has.  If he’d just get
, he’d say, even though Steve knew Bucky didn’t need him to read the night sky.  Bucky didn’t need him for anything, really.  Steve’s the one who needed.
“So. I’m going to ask you a question...and I need you to take a second and think on it before you get defensive and freak out.”
He breathes a faint sigh of relief when he sees the blond man moving before he suddenly realizes he is moving toward
“I don’t care, Tony,” Steve mumbles and of course he doesn’t. But Tony’s tongue had just been buried in his ass and he’d licked the come from his chest, and Steve deserves better than that. He pulls away, ignoring the pull of Steve’s hands to bring him back, and stands up on unsteady legs.
“Tony…they have her, and I have a feeling they’re not going to let her go until she has done a complete vivisection on Steve.  They want a functioning serum, Tony.”  Bruce is talking to him like Tony’s trying his patience, like he’s mustering every last ounce of control to explain the situation.
“You’re right, Pepper.  I know you’re right, you know you’re right.”  Tony pulls back slightly to look at her, brushing a stray strand of her beautiful copper-colored hair out of her pale blue eyes.  “It’s guilt.  You’re not the first person to say so.”
Satisfied they had what they needed to engineer their own serum, their next forced assignment for Dr. Ross was to fashion an antidote of sorts, to make a final test of him by seeing if they could undo everything.  Something as powerful as a super soldier needs a check in place; needs a kill switch.  Steve has no doubts that if Dr. Ross hadn’t gotten him out when she did, they would have ended him and they would have made her be the one to do it.
“Me too.”  Steve claps a hand over his, tangling their fingers together almost absent-mindedly.  The casualness of the gesture is not lost on Tony; Steve touches him like it’s second-nature now, their connection ingrained into their everyday routine.
Clint drifts into silence for a moment.  Steve doesn’t know if the other man is conscious of the fact he’s rubbing his hand over his chest, but Loki must be on Clint’s mind.
“I know.  If there was a way to get him contained, maybe we could use gas, but I don’t see how we can make that happen.  In the open like this, it would take-”
The fateful meeting at St. John’s Orphan Asylum; the nights scrapping in Hell’s Kitchen; the days scrounging for work that never quite paid all the bills.  He wishes Bucky would remember all the double dates despite the unbearable awkwardness, because Bucky loved to dance, and laugh, and sing, and Steve loved to watch him enjoy life enough for the both of them.
“Agent Romanoff tried that first off,” Hill explains tersely, readjusting her grip on Barnes’ good arm as the man shifts.
“Are you sure you’re not coming down with something? You’re all flushed, Tony, and you don’t seem well.”
“The Stork Club...'Eight o’clock, on the dot.  Don’t you dare be late.'”  The doors threaten to close and Steve steps into the entryway, keeping them from doing so.  “First real date I was ever gonna have and I had to stand her up.”
“I’m sorry, I…” Tony feels worse now than he did before. Seeing Steve actually hurt is worse than imagining it. “I got caught up with Bruce.”
“More like it takes you three tries to hit a dang nail on the head. So sad that everyone can’t be born with god given talent like me and Gabe here, but you keep working at it and maybe one day Rogers will let you hold more than your own dick in your hands.”
“The Village?  With all those annoying NYU kids around?” Steve would point out that Tony himself earned one of his degrees from NYU, as did half of their friends, but he’s heard this diatribe before and knows it doesn’t matter.   “Trust me, Steve, I have enough pretentious, entitled, uselessness in my life without actively seeking to surround myself with it.”
So while Steve went off with Bucky for the evening, Tony had rung up Rhodey and Pepper and met his friends – and they are his friends, not his and Steve’s – down in Tribeca for a few too many drinks.  He never felt badly throwing his money around in front of his best pals, didn’t feel weird wearing one of the specially tailored Italian suits that he only wears to important meetings as of late.  He might restore vintage cars and motorcycles as his main hobby these days, but he’s still a shareholder in the family business.  It’s not a lifestyle he misses but it never hurts to occasionally pop back into that world in order to keep his business sense sharp.
“What is it even supposed to be?” Tony asks him on the fourth day, wordlessly offering Steve a sandwich he’d ordered in and eyeing the pieces of trashed guardrail that Steve re-appropriated from a junkyard.  He’s split each one in half vertically and is in the process of installing them onto a wide base, each one of them shooting upward.  Not straight upward, though.  He’s bending them and curling them, twisting them around each other as elegantly as he can.  He’s honestly not sure what he’s going for but something’s taking shape on its own.
Despite having developed into a stronger, taller version of his formerly weak and tiny self, Steve still found himself stamped 4F on account of the lengthy list of ailments that dogged him since childhood. During one of his many failed trips to the recruitment office, a casting director, a kind man by the name of Erskine, had been doing some recruiting of his own. Pretending to be war hero “Captain America” in cheesy matinee serials and bond drives hardly seemed a good substitute for actual service, but it eventually got him the ears of enough powerful men that could get his form stamped 1A no matter what the doctors said. Howard Stark had been one of those men.
is probably not the right word for it, its connotation far too romantic, but it’s the word that comes to mind all the same.
He pushes open the heavy metal stage door, pausing to blink into the bright afternoon sunlight. It’s hot, and he immediately begins to sweat into the tweed blazer and crisply starched button-down of his costume. His trailer is going to be a hot box.
A pillow and pile of stacked blankets are set to one side of the couch, like someone’s been sleeping out here at night.  For the sake of his sanity Tony tries not to read too much into it, moving on quickly.
“Wait, wait.” Jan holds up one finger to signal a pause. She pries her high heels off of her feet. “It’s the shoes. It’s always the shoes.”
“Anyone who works on the serum isn’t ‘just a scientist’, Banner.  You pick up that buck, you’re not going to be passing it on.”
His head hurts, like a thousand voices screaming in his ears, like his skull is breaking wide open.  The lights are too bright and all he wants to do is close his eyes and concentrate, concentrate on the memory of that voice, saying that name.
Manhattan is no longer his friend, eagerly conspiring with him toward greatness.  It is his enemy: a living, breathing entity over which he has no control.  Everything he once loved about this mercurial island now terrifies him.
, Tony –” Rhodey lifts a finger to sharply shut him up, the lewd joke dying in Tony’s throat. “What’s got you so pissed off and unhappy that you gotta take it out on my baby here?”
“It’s best not to let what others think of you define who you are,” he states, pushing back from the counter.  Tony knows Steve means the people who dolled him up and trekked him out as a one trick pony to sell those war bonds, but for a second he thinks Steve’s talking about him and his own views on the Captain.   Suddenly Steve’s all polite again, shield up, armor on.  “Thank you very much for breakfast, Stark.  Probably best I get going now.  I’m sure that you have more important things to do with your time than entertain me.”
“God, you…” Tony murmurs, dropping the hold on his wrist and reaching to touch the side of his face.  “You’re just so…why do you have to be…” Tony leans forward but doesn’t kiss him again, drifting in hesitation.  When he begins to draw further away Steve dips his head, making the decision for the both of them.
“Dunno about that.  I’ve never.”  Unless kisses on the cheek from his mother counted, which he doesn’t think they do.
“Hey, wasn’t my idea,” he explains, still laughing.  “Soon as Fury decided I wasn’t going to shoot him in the back, he trained me up on what to do if the Hulk got loose.  I got the call right after you two bozos left.  You know I’m the only one who can make that shot, Rogers.”
“I’m sorry, Tony,” Steve says quietly, at a loss, as the doors close.  Tony frowns, then smiles a little, then frowns again.  He doesn’t say anything as the elevator smoothly starts moving upward, just faces forward and stares at the wall.
“With the Bifrost destroyed, it saddens me to tell you that the powers of Heimdall are severely limited.  It is only through the grace of my father, Odin, that I may travel to and from Midgard.”
“If you…” Loki nods, sliding one hand to cup Steve from behind as the other slips to his belt buckle. Steve glances down nervously at Loki’s hand between his legs and then back up to his face, and reluctantly nods back. Loki moves closer, mouth drifting over Steve’s for a moment. Steve closes his eyes tightly as Loki’s lips press against his. They’re nearly the same height, and it’s different in every way from kissing Tony.
Pepper is warm and easy-going with Steve, making things instantly more comfortable for everyone.  She seems to genuinely enjoy Steve’s company – the way he’s charming without trying, the way he occasionally slips and calls her Miss Potts and then blushes, like being proper is something to blush over.
Steve starts to tidy up, straightening the couch cushions and gathering his sketchpad and book and DVDs from the coffee table, and Tony’s tidal wave of want is tempered by frustration and amusement.
“We live with a bunch of weirdos, I don’t know-“ Clint starts.  Sam makes a small hissing noise and a jerking movement.  By the way Clint jolts, it’s clear that Sam has landed a sharp kick somewhere just out of Steve’s line of sight.  “What the-?”
“Your deduction is correct.  Your beard is actually sub-par compared to his, but he was the easiest reference to pull from my repertoire.”
As he dampens a washcloth at the sink, he looks up into the mirror and finds Tony leaning in the narrow doorway, watching him. There’s lust in his gaze, clear as day, but there’s something else too, something that Steve dares to read as affection.
Bucky looks at him for a moment but then moves his own right hand to take Steve’s. He has to move closer to do it comfortably, and that brings his other hand nearer to Steve’s head.
“Tony.”  Pepper sounds exasperated, but she gets up from her seat and fits herself precariously on the edge of the couch, reaching out and running her hand through his hair.  “I understand if you don’t want to discuss it with me…but it might do you some good to at least acknowledge to
“I found this place, should be perfect for you.  Lots of lovely dames, it’ll be like swingin’ at the Savoy.”  Tony explains happily, gesturing for Steve to lead the way in.  Steve hesitates, debating about whether or not he should go along with this to make Tony happy, because the man’s clearly trying and he doesn’t want to be rude, not after all Tony’s done for him the past few days…
She steps out of Tony’s embrace and forces him to look her in the eyes.  He hates when she does that.  It makes him feel like a child being scolded.
Dugan and Morita have houses like this now too, ranch-style homes with full yards and attached garages, situated on quiet cul-de-sacs twenty minutes outside downtown. Thor and Jane’s home is only one year old, just like their marriage, and their backyard is still sparse. Flat green grass and growing saplings where once a dense forest stood.
“Got it.” Happy steadies him by the elbow and starts gently leading him toward the elevator.  When Happy starts punching in the access code for Tony’s upper floors, Tony realizes that’s not at all where he wants to go.
“You and Steve and Bucky, you mean.” Pepper corrects. “When you loan out your boyfriend like a library book—“
Fury clicks another button and a long list files in on screen.  Names, dates, and locations.  It fills his vision and then keeps on going.
“Looks like you all had a good night.” Tony comments, hand curling around the wooden railing as he takes another step up toward Steve.
“Back when we first got together, you remember I asked you if you and Bucky had ever slept together? Been together, in any way?”
?” She tosses him her phone, hitting him square in the chest. Tony fumbles for a second in catching it, but once he has it in hand he quickly recognizes the image on screen.
“I do, in fact.” Coulson frowns, clearly resenting the implication that this is anything he should not be proud of.
“I hardly look like I was in bed because I was drunk, Tony.” Steve comments, reaching up to try and smooth his hair back into place. Tony pulls a comb from the inside pocket of his jacket and tries to fix that for him too. Seeing Tony’s look of concentration, Steve tries to bite back a smile but fails.
The conversation quickly turns to the damage that the super powered can do, how out of human control they have become. He was a one-man reign of terror for seventy years. The Hulk destroys cities. Ultron nearly destroyed the world.
“Good to be back.”  Steve mistakes Clint’s other offered hand for a shake, not a fist bump, which is a new thing he’s apparently got to get his head around.  Clint gamely adjusts, chuckling as he clasps Steve’s hand firmly.  Steve looks up at the high ceiling of the Tower’s foyer as Clint leads him forward.  Here in the lobby it’s so much an office building, clinical and impersonal.  It doesn’t seem like Tony at all.  He watches the numbers above the elevator light their way down.
,” Fury says bluntly.  “But that’s the hand we’ve been dealt here.  When one of the world’s most wanted spies strolls into your office and agrees to spill his guts with the one small proviso being he doesn’t want Rogers on the guest list to that particular party, you don’t look the damn gift horse in the mouth.  And I don’t think I should need to remind you all that I didn’t
“Yeah.”  Tony returns Steve’s wide grin for a moment but then gestures to the door again, this time pointing with his foot.  “Now get the damn door before I drop this thing.”
Then he gets up and starts walking over. Peter quickly tries to pull his t-shirt down to cover his groin, leaning forward onto the counter to try and hide the wholly inappropriate tent pitched in his jeans.
“No.”  Steve lifts his head.  Tony locks his jaw determinedly and stares back, refusing to react to the expression on Steve’s face, no matter how beautiful and broken he looks.  “I don’t want it.  I…I’m sorry that I thought things were different.  If I was being such a bother, you could’ve told me to go.  I’ll leave you alone from now on.”  He shoves the sketchbook at Tony’s chest and pushes past him.  He jabs the elevator button, hard.  The doors open immediately, the elevator not having been recalled elsewhere.
“So, you know, push any necessary meetings back, cancel the unnecessary ones, and I know doing this isn’t exactly your job anymore per se, but can you rush some decent Steve-sized clothes to the house in Aspen?  I figure we can make it there by tomorrow night and I, personally, don’t want to be seen hanging out with the Cap dressed in OSU wear I bought at Walgreens any longer than I have to.”
It takes a minute but eventually his pulse settles and the tightness in his chest eases off.  He and Steve continue to breathe together well after the attack has passed, Tony reveling in the security of it.  He’s never seen Steve so focused outside of battle.
“Love you,” Steve mumbles back, half-asleep already, and Tony’s heart forgets to beat, then hammers twice as fast to make up for its lapse.
“You’re here because you saw the finished sculpture, aren’t you?” Steve responds with his own question, and Tony nods.  “Then I don’t see why you’re even asking that.”
Janet Van Dyne drives like a whirlwind and talks just as fast; he’s saved from keeping up his end of the conversation as she takes him home because she chatters on enough for the both of them. Not that he minds. If it weren’t for the way she takes corners so sharply he has to grip the dash or that she believes stop signs to be mere suggestions, the whole thing might even have been relaxing.
I re-wrote this chapter from scratch three times. I don't know. Hopefully the end result is okay. Blerg.
It shouldn’t matter, because he’d stopped giving the project his all after the last incident with Steve in his workshop.  Wiping out the Winter Soldier would only take Steve further away from him, would only be both selfless and self-defeating.  He’s never been one to shy away from self-harm and self-destruction, but it got to be too much hurt for even him to handle.  Seeing Bruce growing steadily happier in Betty’s company didn’t help much either.
There’s nothing but trees straight out for miles, the mountains raising faint purple-blue and beautiful in the distance.  It’s lush and green and the air is crisp.  There’s a small pool straight out from the door, its surface flat and still and extending edge to edge, like the water is falling over its horizon.  Steve walks to the end of the stone patio, toes of his boots nearly touching water, and looks down.  The pool is shallow enough to see straight to the bottom.
Steve eyes the rest of the expansive couch and considers how rude and awkward it would be if he got up and moved.  Tony being so near makes him nervous for reasons he’s not sure he fully understands.
“Tony said…” Steve starts, and realizes that he has no way to say this that doesn’t make him sound like an entitled, greedy ass. He sighs and moves his hands to his lap, fingers twisting together nervously.  “Tony said I could date you both. Love you both. Be with you both.”
“Relax, Tony. I’m retired; I’m not some agent looking to steal your secrets.” Rhodey puts his hands up in surrender, his eyes exaggeratedly pleading. Tony scowls and Rhodey frowns back. “You really are in a
He tries to move Steve toward the stairs, grabbing hold of his hips again and edging him to turn, but he only succeeds in jostling Steve backward.  He knocks against his easel and then his worktable, his painting tumbling to the floor and his paintbrushes rattling.  Tony fumbles for a second, instinctively wanting to save Steve’s work, but Steve yanks him back.
Steve crosses his arms over his chest and stares at the elevator doors, his reflection a dull, blurry shadow on the polished steel.  He holds back his sigh of relief as the car slows to a gentle stop, announcing its arrival at the main floor with a soft
“Guess I should be grateful I won’t be smelling like a ‘moonlight breeze.’ I mean…folks these days don’t
“Well you can rest easy. I’m never going to see Tony Stark again.” Steve rises from the bed and crosses to the closet, pulling his button-down and undershirt over his head as he goes. He suddenly needs to be free of everything from the night before.
Tony’s wanted this with Steve for so long, he’d been afraid that nothing could ever live up to the expectation. But it’s more than he ever dreamed, and it’s Bucky that’s made it so.
He doesn’t answer her, instead going into the bathroom. He just as quickly turns back, pointing a finger at Pepper as he strikes upon an idea of what to do.
Steve hesitates for an obviously pained moment and his face kind of crumples, like he doesn’t want to answer and is trying hard to cough up a very unnatural lie.
“Okay, look….both Steve and Bucky were hit with some kind of drug.  We think Zola may have tailored it specifically for those injected with the super soldier serum.”
“Good thing love isn’t a finite resource, then,” Tony responds. “We can all be as greedy for it as we want.” He lowers his head once more, but his mouth moves lower than Steve’s cock. “Tell me if this is too much.”
That was his code name and the asset has become him again, visiting retribution upon anyone still alive who was involved in his making.
Steve circles the kitchen counter and walks to Tony, stopping directly in front of him and gingerly handing him his glass.  He meets Tony’s gaze as he sets the drink in his outstretched palm.  This close, Tony notices the day’s worth of stubble shadowing Steve’s sharp jaw line; it makes him look older, slightly tired.  It also means Steve’s someone who likes to shower and shave in the morning, which isn’t surprising in the least.  The guy probably rises before the sun.
The elevator ride down to the main floor is tense.  Steve stands a good two paces in front of Natasha, focusing his concentration on the lighted numbers counting their way down to the lobby.
“Whoa, sorry, am I interrupting something?”  Tony is kidding, but just barely.  Natasha rolls her eyes before she grins down at Steve and lets him flip her over.  He thinks
“What are you up to today? Got any plans?”  Tony should go, but he lingers instead.  He rifles through the rest of yesterday’s paper to keep up a pretense that he has a reason to stay.  He doesn’t feel as tired now as he did before.
“Prefer it if you told me flat out what this is about.  I don’t much like guessing games.”  Steve states flatly.  “Sir.”
“Don’t.”  Tony grits out, flexing his fingers in front of him, staring down at the ground.  His knuckles are bloody from where his fist shattered the desk.  He feels the split skin sting, vaguely, like he’s two steps removed from himself.
“No, that was a ‘you’re so beautiful that I have to make love to you even though we should be having a serious conversation’ kinda moment, frankly. No elaborate plan or ulterior motive,” Tony explains, trying to pull them back from the brink of this argument.
“Where are you?” She demands impatiently.  Steve scans the skyline for any sign and catches the glint of a scope on the roof of a nearby building.  He knows he wouldn’t have caught sight of it if Bucky hadn’t wanted him to.  He rolls his eyes and taps Natasha on the shoulder.
"Sleeping places can be found everywhere," Steve replied immediately but smiled gratefully to Vision.
Trembling and sniffling, he reached up to avoid being too loud, repeating words like a meter over and over again. "Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck."
Then she nodded, almost understanding. Her eyes shot through the workshop and stopped somewhere behind him. She walked quickly past Tony, to the shelf where the Captain's shield was kept. She took it and then left the workshop far too quickly. He had disappointed her, hurt her. She felt the way he did the last two months and three weeks.
He was not surprised that when the elevator doors to the conference room opened, he saw a lot of faces.
Stark opened his mouth to answer, but he could not. He just looked at his friend before shaking his head.
I really, really hope that all of this makes at least a little bit of sense. And I hope that everything is alright with the tags.
Tony had thanked him and then pulled up Steve, who had been muttering softly, but had finally walked with him, still half asleep. That was the first night Tony was awake only because of his own nightmares, not because of his boyfriend's.
"Why didn’t you do it then?" he asked the lunatic for the first time. His voice was hoarse. Steve beside him stiffened at the question, but Tony needed to know.
"The other Avengers who are still in New York. Steve, Barnes, Natasha, Clint, Wanda and me. And Fury. By the way, he made a very special appearance when you were gone."
"Who is not with Mama Barton?" Tony smirked. He was very happy that Natasha and Clint were back after the weekend at the Bartons. Now that Lang was back at home and Wilson was still in the infirmary, he had had a hard time taking care of Wanda just with Steve.
He saw black spots again and coughed another time, but laxer this time. He had to do something, the next time he woke up here was probably more unpleasant, he thought.
When his hand touched the sun-heated metal, he winced but did not let go. He looked at the piece with his jaw clenched. With only one arm, he couldn’t build anything properly, no devices to escape or call for help. His brain worked. He stared at the piece of metal in his hand, hoping he'd come up with an idea of how to make something out of it that would get him help. His feverish and painfully slow brain needed several minutes before a solution could be found. Tony was sure the only way to get out of this situation alive was to get help. He swallowed and hoped he would not lose his chances with his idea.
She paused briefly and Tony thought of his own father, who tried to solve his own problems with similar methods.
Steve opened a door that looked suspiciously important. A dead creature laid in front of it, which perhaps had kept watch. When he entered the room, he looked at countless electrical devices, all of them blinking and beeping. Tony would feel comfortable in here, he thought, feeling a stab in his chest.
"Pepper," Tony breathed relieved and hobbled as fast as he could to his friend. Steve let him go and the mechanic dropped down next to his friend to hug her immediately. His mouth dried again when he saw her, and tears formed in his eyes, but he could them blink back. His chest ached from the pressure that fell away from him.
At that moment Tony knew that Burkwill had expected everything. But not someone who gave his life to protect others. The desperate cry of a man from the tank sufficed as confirmation.
Towards the end, Fury had become very loud and pointed with his hand to the place where the hologram had just been standing.
"Why didn’t you bring Stark here? Or sent him on the ship to a slow death? What was the reason for this? It could all have been over and we all would have gotten our revenge. You have had the chance to finish him."
But he would refuse to ask for help after doing so much in the last few weeks without help, and reached with his good hand for the rotten wooden railing and went slowly ahead.
"Zemo shot Natasha too, but then he ran. I did have him ... I didn’t mean to harm him that badly, but he was screaming things, Tony." Steve's voice broke and Tony felt more helpless than ever. "He said you would always be a murderer and never really love someone without seeking profit. I could not ... I was so angry. It's not right, Tony, okay? What he said is not true."
"Boss?" Friday brought him back. "There is something in the files about handwritten notes on the ship. In Persian."
Tony had been one of his closest friends for so long. He couldn’t be dead, that wouldn’t work. He coughed, and his lungs cramped.
"A photo," Tony said as he pulled the light frame out of the brown paper. It was a simple wooden frame and in the middle of it was the yellowed photo of a family of five. Tony's forehead wrinkled; he had never seen these people before.
Tony shook his head almost imperceptibly. There was nothing he would rather see than that. He was startled by himself, but the anger kept coming back.
Steve couldn’t answer, but stared silently at the other man. He didn’t know why all his words were missing. Maybe he felt sorry for Rhodes. Maybe he had hoped the next person he met would be Tony.
Again, Pepper was silent for a moment. "After that. When it is over. Then you take a break, away from the others, if it helps you. With me or Rhodey. Here. Deal?"
"We shouldn’t be looking at all,” he replied, earning dumbfounded glances. He continued to straighten up. "Burkwill has carefully given small hints the whole time. He will not stop, so close to the end. He still wants his revenge," he analysed. "He just wants us to have no plan before. If we split up, we are scattered around the city as the crucial clue falls; we are unprepared and uncoordinated. We just have to wait here and Burkwill will call again."
After getting dressed, he walked slowly in the direction of the elevator. As Tony had expected, it was quiet in the corridor. It was just before seven in the morning, the other Avengers had returned only five hours ago. But Tony was busy. An army of monsters rarely came just like that, somebody had to be behind it. The elevator brought him to the floor where the large kitchen and living area were. The inventor had insisted during the renovation that the team would have a large common room so they could work together more closely. He snorted sarcastically.
Shortly he took a little break to turn around. Although the fight had been going on for ages, the soldiers of the United States army with their heavy weapons were only just beginning to arrive. Orders were shouted, men and women ran around frantically and built up as heavy guns as possible to lift hundreds of feet into the air.
He did not do anything about them. He quickly dodged a stone that had passed dangerously close to his arc reactor.
But when he opened his eyes he could see more than the last time. The sandstone above him seemed to be a kind of cave he had somehow fallen into, the sky at the edge of his field of vision was now covered with a few clouds. And he actually lay on the sand. In the distance, he heard the ocean. Still, each breath hurt and the little wind that made it into the cave had swirled sand into his mouth. He coughed and cramped.
Steve was unable to move, but at that very moment Tony was already flying high and headed straight for the creature. It was still busy with arrows from Clint, so it didn’t notice the machine’s arrival.
When Steve opened his eyes in the middle of the night, he couldn’t remember his dream. Breathing heavily, he sat down on the edge of his bed, in the room that still looked the same as it used to. He ran his hand over his sweaty face, trying to calm himself.
"A few hours ago, there was no alien ship that attacked the East Coast. We have to look for Tony, the government can’t forbid that!" Steve exclaimed, taking a step closer to Fury.
The man was at most twenty-four. His brown hair was cropped and testified to military training. The athletic agent stood up.
Tony drove into the common room. When the doors opened again and his scratched and patched mirror image pushed aside, he entered the room, trying to hobble as little as possible. There would be people in here, guaranteed.
Neither would he be dead now. Once more, Steve breathed, then cautiously climbed over a small rock and walked into the big sandstone cave. Everywhere was the same beige tone, only on the floor was filled with the light sand. And in the center of the cave lay Tony, deathly pale, with several wounds, with burned skin, with an open fracture on his right arm.
"Blueberries?" Steve asked, holding up a box of these. Tony barely noticed the other man's voice trembling, but grinned weakly and got up. His shoulder was bandaged and thumping, but otherwise, most of the pain had passed. There were patches and bandages all over, but it did not hurt much.
His eyes went first to the kitchen, where Vision chatted quietly with Wanda. It seemed to be important because Wanda answered and gesticulated strongly. On the couch, Tony could make out Natasha, who was explaining something on the files, and Clint, listening intently whilst sitting at his chair. His gaze flickered to Tony and seemed to darken, at least briefly, then he nodded to him and drew the other's attention to him as well.
“And you seem unaware that three months in my world is nearly an eon when scandal is concerned,” he retorts airily as he and Steve approach the box office.  Tickets are waiting for him at Will Call.
Tony looks at his two friends as they fold their hands together in Carol’s lap. He’s genuinely happy for them, warmth spreading through him where only a few minutes ago he had felt cold and hollow. As he'd always thought, they make a beautiful couple, and he's never seen Rhodey look so content.
“Forget about the whole movie. That’s not what I want from you. I just…I got carried away is all, thinking about having you in my life in that particular way. That’s not how we have to do things.”
“So, yes. If you wouldn’t mind watching the cut and letting me know what you think, I would greatly appreciate the input.” Tony dials back to professional, and Steve seems to click over as well, unfolding his arms and finally joining Tony.
“I don’t know if I deserve you.” He brushes his mouth against Steve’s gently once, then twice, each passing sensation building up an electric charge.  “But I’m good at being selfish.”
.  I want to know what we’re walking into.”  Tony crosses to his main computer and works as quickly as he can, attempting to hack SHIELD’s mainframe.  The whole network appears to be down, like someone turned off the power at the source.  “Damn it.”
Tony drops to his knees and mouths over the bulge in Steve’s tight blue hipster boxer briefs, his cock hard and heavy between his legs and straining against the thin material.  He looks up at Steve and finds him already wrecked, his eyes dark and his sculpted chest and stomach rising and falling quickly as he struggles to catch his breath.
“Happy, we can go.” Pepper tilts her head to speak to the man up front, his long-time driver and bodyguard and Pepper’s newly minted fiancé. The diamond ring sparkles on her finger as she tucks a wayward wisp of her long strawberry blond hair back behind her ear.
“What I meant was, I don’t think it was a coincidence.”  Her words are carefully measured and weighed.  “I think seeing Captain America on television, in the newspapers, and for all we know, possibly in person, prompted the break.  I think
The wartime remembrances of his nightmares have been pushed out by the sensual memories of last night, but he’s still teetering off-balance. He’s simultaneously unsettled and undone, something dark digging at his mind even as arousal is racing through his veins.
“You don’t seem to understand how dangerous this man is.  He could turn on any of us in the blink of an eye and we’d be helpless to stop him.  We’re talking about a master assassin not in control of his mental faculties.”
that Steve and Bucky loved each other as more than friends. That had been before Steve became Tony’s lover and partner. Before he and Steve had started building a life together. Tony should be
“We got a pumpkin for you over there, Barnes, you better get crackin’.”  Tony points across the room, waving a finger at the extra pumpkin sitting on the counter.  Steve hadn’t realized it was intended for Bucky, and his heart warms at Tony making the gesture.
He had been restrained.  He’d thought maybe he was frozen again.  He’d figured that was why he couldn’t move.  He still can’t really move now – limbs are heavy, he can’t get anything to cooperate.
“What? What makes you think I did something?” Tony protests. She sets aside her legal notepad and carefully twists her pen closed, putting it in the inside pocket of her perfectly tailored navy blue blazer.
“Everything okay?”  He asks.  Tony takes advantage of the interruption to grab his phone, letting both Pepper and Steve’s questions go unanswered.
.” Bruce slows down his words, spitting them out sharply in an attempt to get through to him.  “Obviously whoever has
“Poetic,” Steve repeats to himself quietly, turning the word over in his mind.  The piece of vibranium once kept in Tony’s heart might have been just that, but he thinks the word is better suited to describe how they seem to have found each other now.
“Nothing,” Rhodey repeats, bending to look at him, his tone slightly mocking. “You might want to tell that to the bolt you’re abusing.”
and now…” Bucky gasps a desperate breath as the balcony door opens and Steve steps out into the freezing night, a look of concern on his beautiful face.
“You don’t know that was Bucky,” Tony retorts, picking up his tumbler of scotch and taking a long sip. He looks at Pepper over the rim, buying some time as he quickly tries to think of a way to let this all drop. “You can’t see my phone from over there.”
“Buck…” Steve groans, and Tony palms his own hard on through his jeans, feeling it twitch as it presses up urgently and uncomfortably against his zipper.  Steve moves his hands from Bucky’s ass, sliding smoothly up his back and around to his chest. His broad palms cover Bucky’s pecs and come to rest there as Bucky continues to rock over him. Steve looks up to Bucky’s face, then back to Bucky’s cock, then back to his face, and repeats the pattern again, gauging Bucky’s reactions to every single thrust.
Tony hesitates with the blunt head of his cock against Steve’s hole, barely breaching his body. He doesn’t do it to tease, even if that’s a pleasurable side effect. He pauses to try and memorize this moment, to register each and every sensation as he slowly – so,
“She is a real beaut.” Happy pats the dash like a proud father. “One of the perks of this job. Not that I need perks, mind you. Tony’s a great boss. Helluva guy.”
Tony shoots him a look, then gives a heavy sigh of his own. He moves away from the engine and his shoulders slump.
He drops the boxes to the counter and then presses a kiss to his fingers, presses his fingers to the face of Steve’s jack o’ lantern.
They lurch from the hangar, wavering slightly, but Dr. Ross wrangles better control as soon as they’re clear.  Steve tries to think what he should ask her but he has too many thoughts and each time he tries to grab hold of one, it slips through his fingers.
.” Steve tries to admonish her, but his blush and his sheepish smile undermine any kind of stern authority he's trying to project. She bends down beside him and adjusts the line of the pants by pulling at one of the ankle cuffs waiting to be hemmed.
share and care in the middle of the gym, so chances are the good captain would be fine with a brush pass.
Tony picks up the remote control and pauses the movie, Woody Allen and Diane Keaton paused on screen in the middle of a rooftop conversation.  He’s still laughing.
“Iron Man, at this point it’s more about finding survivors and figuring out what happened than winning the fight.  This fight’s finished.  We’ll cover more ground if we separate.  That’s an order.” Steve moves too quickly, disappearing into the smoke.  Tony can’t see worth shit.
“If you mess with his head…I will throw you out.  I don’t care how fucked up you are, or how much history the two of you have.  You’ll be gone.  Are we clear?”
“Don’t ever tell me how you found me.”  Steve replies.  He moves to pick up the bag containing their old clothes but Tony grabs it first.
“I’ve been to Paris many a time, Cap, so I’ll tell you that this Mini-Me pales in comparison,” Tony retorts when he says as much.  “Someday we’ll go and you can see for yourself.”
He stares at the ceiling, dumbfounded by his own actions. He lets out a long, deep breath, and answers Steve honestly.
He thumbs open the button of Steve’s jeans.  Steve sucks in a sharp breath, flat stomach contracting beneath Tony’s mouth.  Tony hesitates, thinking maybe he shouldn’t have jumped the gun on declaring himself never a fool, and peers up the length of Steve’s body to look at his face.
Pepper’s laugh is bright and airy as Phil guides her over the dance floor, steady and sure.  Tony had been right about that match, and he even calls Phil by his real name occasionally in order to keep Pepper from getting too annoyed.  Thor is sitting with Jane on the love seat, listening raptly to whatever story Jane is unfolding.  Steve never understands half of what Jane describes, and he suspects that Thor doesn’t either.  It doesn’t seem to matter.  Jane’s assistant Darcy has Sam cornered – not that he seems to mind – and Clint is strangely deep in conversation with Maria Hill.
When Steve makes his way back up, his fingers brush suggestively at Tony’s entrance, and it physically hurts to say no to what Steve’s asking.
Tony shifts forward, so slightly, and just like that, his lips brush Steve’s softly.  The sensation is electric; it’s like cocaine flooding his system, an instant high that makes everything sharper and brighter, more intense.
“Hot.”  Natasha agilely hops down from the counter, bare feet landing on linoleum with an almost dainty grace.  For all Tony’s taught himself and made for himself, he still moves like a machine when he’s in the suit.  A well oiled and elegantly designed machine, but a machine nonetheless.
When he sees the familiar skyline shimmering like a mirage in the distance, emerging blue-grey and beautiful out of the rapidly clearing morning fog, Steve reaches over and puts his hand over Bucky’s.
Tearing his gaze from Steve’s bulging biceps, he notices the pained look on Steve’s face and realizes too late that jokes about lost arms probably aren’t in his best interest at this point.  Leave it to him to shove his foot in his mouth this quickly.  Has to be some kind of record.
, Banner?”  Bucky laughs, entering the small living room with three fresh bottles of beer and plopping down on the loveseat beside Clint.  He gives Clint one bottle, keeps one for himself, and reaches over and hands Bruce the last.  “You forget that Stevie’s actually a big time egghead under all that handsome.”
She gives his fingers a soft squeeze and she smiles; that pinched look primed and ready for disappointment leaves her face for the first time since she sat down.
“They took ‘em down for a whole buncha years, then did a restoration a few years back.  I never really noticed ‘em much.  Pretty sure the last time I was down here, I was making out with some supermodel.”  Tony must mistake his appalled expression as a cry for more details.  “They were having a photo shoot out at the fountain, it was like fish in a barrel, I couldn’t help myself.  The
In fact, JARVIS reminds him the very next morning when he walks into the studio and finds Tony flipping through his sketchbook, waiting for him with a cup of coffee and a box of donuts.
Steve takes the boxes and falls into step beside Tony, wishing that he wasn’t carrying a thing so he could take Tony’s hand.  They move through the hallway and foyer at a brisk pace; Tony’s wired, brimming with energy.
with you?” Pepper hisses as she catches up to him, stopping at his side and putting a tight hand on his elbow, manicured fingernails digging into his arm. “You’re being rude, and you can’t just go wandering off. Do you want this deal or not?”
The lab here isn’t helping matters, filled as it is with remnants of his father’s work and not his own.  When DUM-E rolls around, happy to be active again and in his zeal occasionally knocking over one of Howard’s projects, Tony never scolds him for it.  He can’t outright destroy the stuff because the scientist in him recognizes its value, but if it accidentally ends up in broken pieces on the floor he’s surprisingly okay with that.
“Ready to go home, champ?” Tony suddenly claps a hand to his shoulder, startling Steve enough that he jumps.  Steve tries to recover, play it cool, but it’s no matter. Tony’s already starting off toward Fifth, unsteady on his feet.
Just as Steve starts to put a name to that warm feeling coiling tight in his chest, Tony folds his hands under his chin and bats his eyelashes at him in a ridiculous manner worthy of Betty Boop.
“I’m really glad you’re here, Bucky,” Steve can’t help but say, a sudden wave of gratitude coming over him.  “Can’t tell you how much.”
He visits forgotten corners of Brooklyn and far-flung places in Europe, re-tracing steps taken over seventy years prior.
Or maybe Tony’s over-thinking it and Steve’s simply too tired to hold up his end of a proper conversation.
The older he grew, the allure of the city dimmed.  Tony avoided it for many reasons – his father being chief among them while he was alive, and strangely even more so after his death – but even as Tony’s life became a whirlwind of globe-trotting business trips and decadent excursions, something inevitably pulled him back.  He yearned for New York even when it hurt to be there.  He could never refuse its call.
Pepper holds his gaze for a moment longer and then something about her seems to shift.  She smiles brokenly.
He manages to last another hour, unable to stop himself from watching Steve’s charcoal smudged hands deftly working over the broad page, noting the way Steve’s carefully combed hair has fallen forward in disarray over his forehead.
The nights when they comfortably lean into each other until they’re drowsy and nodding, Tony reading off his tablet while Steve holds a thick book, are nearly as bad as the evenings when Tony spreads Steve out on the mattress and fucks him until Steve forgets himself and takes the Lord’s name in vain, over and over.
“Tony, have you seen that blue button-down I was wearing last week? Ross wants me to do another talk show circuit, starting tomorrow—”
“I’m sorry about that,” Steve apologizes anyway, ignoring Tony’s innuendo but acknowledging the underlying point.  “I thought that you might…” He makes an
thoughts on the subject,” Tony retorts, bristling despite his best efforts to keep cool. “I’ll let you put many things in my mouth, Rogers, but words ain’t one of them.”
That makes it all the more surprising when Saturday night rolls around and Steve walks into the workshop with a box from Ray’s, a bottle of scotch, two glasses, and no other companions.  If Steve is trying to catch him off guard, he’s done so with aplomb.
“I don’t think I’m ever gonna let you leave this apartment, Cap.  Just as a heads up.  Thought you might want to know.”
He stops before Steve can get too aroused, knowing it upsets him when he can’t get it up again as fast as he used to. Tony knows his mouth and goatee must be wet and shimmering with spit and come, so he grabs the napkin from by Steve’s plate of now-cold toast and wipes his face clean. Then he takes a sip of his coffee, drowning out the taste of his own come in his mouth, and looks down at his boyfriend splayed out over the kitchen counter.
He lifts his drink to Darcy in a toast of commiseration. Darcy snorts a laugh and clinks her glass against his before taking a long, long sip. Steve’s eyebrows rise as she drains it empty.
“You do not have Ebola in here.” He eyes Bruce, jokingly wary.  “Was that the Other Guy poking through and being an ass or are you finally loosening up?”  Tony jumps down from the table; Bruce returns his easy grin with a shy but pleased one of his own.
“I have my ways,” Tony shrugs.  “It took me longer than I’d imagined though.  You’re remarkably good at disappearing, Cap, to a pretty scary degree.  Did Nat give you tips?”
Despite his orgasm, he’s still hard inside Tony, and he pushes his hips in small, tentative thrusts as he and Tony kiss. He whimpers and Tony curses breathlessly. He’s oversensitive and he knows Tony must be too, but he doesn’t want the feeling to end. He chases after the last currents of pleasure as they ebb away.
“Fine, fine. Parker’s off lighting, tell him to come see me.” Scott pumps his fist in victory and turns on his heel, practically running away to deliver the good news. Tony rolls his eyes. “I thought you said this guy was the best of the best.”
He also scans the background of Bucky’s cell for some sign of where they might be keeping him.  There’s nothing, the room is as non-descript as non-descript can be.  Not a single detail to help him determine if Bucky’s here in New York, on the helicarrier, or one of SHIELD’s many other undisclosed locations.  Hell, Bucky could be in jail on the moon and Steve wouldn’t be able to tell.
He tries not to do that though – the endless comparisons to the people he used to know, the friends he used to have.  Parallels are easy to find when one’s looking.  There are glimpses of Peggy in Natasha’s fierce no-nonsense grace, Dum-Dum’s boisterous fighting joy in Thor’s loud tumble of a laugh, Erskine’s kindness and regret in Bruce’s sad smile, even shades of Phillips in Fury’s strengthening faith in their ragtag team.  And Howard…well, he sees Howard in the shadows of everything Tony does.
On the bed, Bucky is moving atop Steve, whimpering in pleasure as Steve shifts inside him like he’s going to start fucking him all over again.  Bucky tosses his hair back out of his face and pulls back, sitting up straight.
“Penn Station was so beautiful, how could they replace it with…this?  And this is what Madison Square Garden looks like now?  It used to be…it was twenty blocks uptown and…”
