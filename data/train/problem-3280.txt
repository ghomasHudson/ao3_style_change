After the little hissing cracks of people opening their respective bottles Elle speaks,"Well the empty like to pray upon the people that are in there, especially if they are not doing what they are supposed to be doing. Reliving worst memories, seeing horrible things or hearing horrible things... all kinds of stuff. The thing with the empty is when you to to their domain you are inside them, like purgatory but sentient. So It throws everything it can at you to get you to do what it wants."
"I- I what if I mess this up?" Jack's voice was quiet now, this was something he had been worried about for a while now and just didn't quite know how to voice it. There was so much riding on him getting everything just right, but did he really want to play god? Was that something that he could handle?
he clenched and released a fist. "Sam..." damn did he sound tired, "just... let it go. I'm fine. We are back here in the bunker, and we have a job to do. Let's just focus on that and stow the chick flick crap for later okay?"  With that he made a tactical retreat to his own room where he stowed some of his bullshit, unlike the emotional ones in his head there was space in here for his things.
It took longer than he would like to get angry, because that was the only emotion that wouldn't cripple him right now and he
"Change...? What did you change Elle?" It seemed that Sam was the one who was going to ask the majority of the questions now, which was just fine with everyone else. Jack had a million and one things he wanted to ask, but it seemed that Sam had more important things at the moment, and Dean... well Dean looked fragile in a way Jack had never seen before.
Bobby looked skyward as the man approached and the closer the man got, the more Dean tightened his fist behind his back. It was Zachariah, that douchey angel that dropped them into that strange world where they weren't brothers and they learned to fight together anyway.
have been a sobering thought, but it really wasn't. Dean knew how his story was going to end, he always had. The things he wants he doesn't
As they got closer it was easy to see why Jack couldn't just zap in, there was warding set up around the place. Not so much to warn creatures away from the place, but more or less to just keep people from popping in and out unannounced. Though with no one currently in the world other than the three walking up to the building... that shouldn't be a problem. Some of the symbols looked like old Enochian, but some looked... demonic. "I don't like this, not at all. Reminds me of that place Crowley was keeping Alpha's in." Whispering, Dean took the lead and opened the door in front of them. It seemed to just lead into a darkened hallway. Sam grimaced at the mention of that place but kept up pace with the other two, yet staying a bit in the rear to make sure to watch their backs.
The other thing that was glaringly obvious when their skin touched, she was a Nephilim, like him, though she had a lot of power behind her almost like she was an archangel and a Nephilim at the same time... and maybe something else. Something slightly darker lingered in with the power too that gave him pause. Deciding that he could look into
There was a moment where Sam just sort of squinted and stared off a little over Dean’s shoulder, almost like he was trying to remember something but eventually he shook whatever it was off."So, Cas was coming to meet us? Is that what the letter said?" There was a raised eyebrow there, and all the accompanying attitude that Dean figured would come from Sam. “Adler sounded pretty sure that he was coming here specifically, and Bobby sure didn’t say anything otherwise.”
. A bright blue thread twined in gold and silver led from Dean into nothingness... seemingly stopping.
I know, but I just know that this person can get to where Cas is and bring him home." A multitude of emotions flick through Dean's eyes and with this new strange god like power Jack can decipher them all. It makes his head spin. "I can get us to them now... but I think there is trouble."
Sam and Dean find quite a few familiar faces as they make their way to the castle and hopefully find Castiel.
Though his eyes were closed tightly and the only thing leaking from them was tears, he could almost clearly see each and every painful expression Cas had ever worn in his presence. So many things hit him all at once as he just tried to breathe through it and release some of the tension, but there was just so much. Interposed with all of it was that watery smile, that
The thought hit him so suddenly and he immediately felt sick. Elle was supposedly his daughter and she grew up that way, but worse; Alone in hell... and now Jack?
He looked around. The castle structure that they were in was made of beautifully solid stone with little intricate detailed scrollwork around the archways and windows. Keeping pace with Ellen was hard when all they wanted to do was investigate the place that they were in.
"Dean..." Sam looked tired, almost as tired as Dean felt. So much, so so much had happened in just the last few days and Sam didn't even know the half of it. Hell if Dean even knew what was happening anymore either. Somewhere in the back of his mind it was playing Cas' words over and over, watching all the emotion on his face right before - "Dean," Sam tried again, this time with his hand on Dean's shoulder but Dean just stiffened and took a step back. That is when Sam saw the bloody hand print on Dean's over shirt.  "Dean what is... is that?" Once more Sam tried to take a step closer and Dean just back peddled into the edge of the map table. "What happened, really Dean? You said that he was just taken... There has to be more than that, even back there in that warehouse Jack and Elle said something of the same. There is more to the story that you aren't telling me."
hated the way Adler treated Cas and that Cas had told him a story once about how he was kidnapped as a child from a far away place. Always wishing someone would rescue him from the Adlers and their mistreatment. A sudden vision of a young Castiel and Dean hiding in the roots of a tree near a pond came to mind, Dean resting back against the tree with Cas' head on his shoulder as they talked. Little Cas gesturing wildly as he told a story and Dean laughing.... which was strange, right? Dean wasn't from here but those memories were. It was like Dean had stepped into the life of another version of himself, and that person’s memories were slowly coming to him.
Jack deserved to have his father, unlike how Dean and Sam had grown up, he deserved to know that he was loved and cared for, that there was someone who was going to protect him no matter what, that he was
Why that thought in particular was so terrifying he didn't want to touch right that second, but he couldn't help but notice the strange sense of wonder on Jacks face as he looked almost everywhere but her eyes.
, was never easy on the whole emotional home front and he honestly didn't know how to process everything that was happening. Right after the grief came the intense rage that he knew was coming.
"One of my... children have gone missing and I know they had something to do with it. The runaway left a note, after all." Brandishing a piece of parchment he flicked it around. "Says he was going to run away to be happy, as if we hadn't given him everything he required. Was intended for someone else who already paid for his hand, by the way, and now he is gone."
, after Cas came back. Sam and the kid had holed up for a little while before the plan was executed and Dean was pretty sure that they talked about all the possible outcomes of whatever was going to happen, and that Jack had already made up his mind about what he was going to do. All Dean's praying was not going to mean anything, but something inside Dean knew that this is what Cas would want somehow. For Dean to keep his faith, no matter how fragile. Of all the things that Castiel, the Angel of the Lord, had taught him... Faith was the biggest. Sure he didn't have any in himself, not really, but he found something to have faith in... Cas. Yeah that was rocky sometimes, and sometimes he lost that faith, but it always came back to Cas didn't it? After hell. Maybe that is why Elle's revelation was such a big deal to him and he needed to take a moment to really process that without the others around. Dean's removal from hell was such a big deal to all parties involved
Quickly covering their mouths incase the fog could do any damage they wait a moment to let things settle before taking a look in the room, flashlights in hand. A black stone, almost six foot tall stands at the center covered in what appears to be sigils or runes made of blood. They are both similar and different to the ones seen previously and seem to be written in various different languages. Dean steps into the room first, gun drawn and checking the corners as Jack walks up to the stone to try and read what it says. "These I recognize," Sam points out a few here and there as he steps up behind Jack. "Grounding and locking, whatever is inside the demons didn't want it getting out." It was fairly obvious but still he looked around the room at the paper debris, "whatever this is, its been here a while judging by the newspapers strewn around..." Bending down to sort through some of them he makes a disbelieving sound in the back of his throat, "some of these go back to 2011."
though, a person made from pieces of them, and though Dean is still a little foggy on the details as to how
The group of three landed in an alley just off the street from where they parked the Impala, mostly because Jack knew that the chances of being seen, now that the people were back was very high. A half second later Elle landed behind them with a rather large duffel bag and swinging a set of keys. "So... where are we headed? I need to see the spot where Castiel went into the empty and I don't exactly know where that is."
He rolled his eyes in Adler's general direction. "Look here Adler, I don't care what you think of me. Castiel is a person, and he deserves every right to be happy and not sold off to someone so you can make some coin. He's a person, not a meal ticket. If you don't like the facts, find a door." Dean folded the parchment as he spoke and tucked it neatly into a pouch at his side like he knew what he was doing and thumbed in the general direction of
"You are in my home, insulting my family, and quite frankly I don't care for your face. It's very off putting. We were in the middle of a meeting about the upcoming nuptials before you so rudely interrupted. If you don't mind, we have rather important business to get back to. If I do see Castiel, I will be sure to let him know you are looking for him." Unsure of how he spoke the words so calmly as his insides were screaming at him, he turned his back to Adler and bent over the parchments that they had been looking at before.
"What do you mean he isn't coming back with us? That's home isn't it?" The pitch of Dean's voice was all wrong, it wasn't the strong gravely sound that Jack associated with the man. No this tone was higher, more desperate...  he can't loose anyone else or he will break... the thought immediately tumbles through his head and he recalls a conversation that he and Castiel had on the subject of Dean. "He feels things more fiercely than anyone I have ever known..." Could Jack do that? Could he leave Dean... like everyone else?
"One at a time, I think." Elle took a deep breath and shook out her shoulders and let a pulse of lavender light engulf her for a moment as she healed any injuries she had as well as easing the sore muscles of her body. One final shake left her standing there in front of the three men in a different outfit, this one clean of goop.  An Avenged Sevenfold Death bat T-shirt was  visible under a red and black plaid shirt and a soft looking brown leather jacket. This of course topped worn looking blue jeans, a studded leather belt that looked like it also held bullets, and brown leather boots. "That's a little better... for now. I miss my lip ring though." One last stretch of her neck she smiled a bit, looking every bit a hunter as the Winchester brothers did. If Jack didn't know any better, he never would have guessed she was part angel... she was able to hide the power rather well. "Yeah I met a version of you from.... an alternate 2014. I helped him clear out most of a city for a raid at a compound  where I knew Lucifer was, mostly because he tried to kill me. I happened to let that version of Dean know where to find Lucy, but first he tried to flirt with me, and then kill me... and well Later he tried to kill me again. Great times."
all he was going to do is agonize over this and not be able to breathe at all. A hand on his shoulder jolted him out of his own head and twisted and moved as if he was burned. Something in Sam's expression was a mixture of shocked and hurt and
There was a broken sort of scoff that left Dean's throat, "Yeah?" The word tumbled out broken and clogged with emotion, so much so that it looked as if tears were gathering in Dean's eyes. He was reliving that moment over again, "Billie was after me and he summoned the empty... he was swallowed by it... how- how would that not worry me?" Elle looked hard at Dean, almost as if she was looking through him and she touched briefly the moment Dean was reliving in his mind. Seeing the scene from every angle... she heard the words and could feel Dean's heart break as Cas was just gone...
As the thought passes through his mind the tug on the string gets rougher, something tugs hard at the string and a jolt of awareness passes through him.
so there is no point in dwelling on them. The only thing keeping him even remotely hinged right now is the fact that they have a way to get Castiel back.
There was a choking sound that left Dean's throat and Sam wanted to move closer to his brother, but he decided against that. It was Jack that finally answered, "Castiel is in the Empty. I can't bring him back this time... but I think you can." There was a moment or two where Elle looked back and forth between the two older brothers before looking at Jack. Almost assessing the situation as best as she could. "Who are you exactly? You said you were a type of Nephilim but your presence is much different than mine."
"Now is not the time... fall apart later." With the last grumble to himself he let go of the wheel, rubbed at his face, and stepped out of the car. Sam was sorting through things in the trunk so that is where he headed, grabbing his 1911 and tucking it into his waist, a silvered knife in his boot, and shoving a few odds and ends into his duffle not knowing what was coming he waited near Jack for Sam to situate himself.
"I felt the universe ripple when the Angels sent you there, so I assumed you were... I was kept a bit separate after I spoke with that version of Dean... and Castiel... because Dean wouldn't have believed me otherwise." Elle leaned down and checked her boots and the two daggers hidden within them, "I was the reason you were able to get so close without running into Croats. It seemed the best option for me to interact with the place, and given the fact that he was on a suicide mission of sorts..." It was then that she blinked and looked up at the three of them. "Wait... where is Castiel?"
There was a strange, almost ruddy look to Bobby's face as he opened his mouth to speak, which came out as more of a bellow. "You
Without thinking Jack raised his hand as if he were going to touch the stone but was jerked back a step when he heard a voice calling out to him. "Jack we don't know what's inside." Sam tried to reason and Dean just rolled his eyes. Though the current situation felt a little more dire than light hearted
Blowing out a breath Sam tilted his head back and thought about it. "I think I asked her once, why she was there, and she said that my soul was screaming out for help and she felt compelled to help me. There was some sort of connection that she was able to follow and found us as we were falling and she jumped in to protect us." At that Jack seemed to stiffen but no one noticed, the brothers both too busy to see the subtle movement. Dean huffed out a harsh breath, like he didn't buy that for a second. "Like I said after Death got my soul back and then Cas broke the wall in my mind there was a lot of things going on, and I thought I had just made it up. I didn't think she was real."
"Yes... Castiel told me that he made a deal to get me back, but that he would go to the empty because of it." When Elle turned to Jack her eyes searched his face and she squeezed his hand slightly to prompt him to continue. "I believe that he felt that going there was a long way off and that he had time... He didn't want to tell Dean or Sam because he didn't want to worry them."
"Destro- I'm sorry Destroying the Empty?" Tossing his hands up in the air with an exaggerated gesture of exasperation was all Sam could really do at this point as Dean's gaze hardened and trained on Elle's face.
Both of them paled a bit when Bobby said that, but he just continued on like nothing was out of the ordinary. "We have everything pretty much well in hand, however the bride has sent some of her people here to get a feel for the place and has some stipulations of her own for the ceremony. In all honesty Sam, she isn't asking for a whole heck of a lot, just a few extra steps, so I figure we can work that all in for her easily enough." Handing Sam a small, neatly printed list, Bobby looks up from the paperwork and over at Dean. "Of course you are going to have to do a little bit of talking, being heir apparent and all, so I think that we are going to have to work on your speech a bit more. Also you two have to work out who else is going to be standing up on the dais with you. Jo will be on the bride's side as tradition dictates, but the bride also has two others she wants included. It's going to be up to you, Dean, to set that right."
"Well, nice of you two princesses to join us today. We have a lot to go over, come on." Bobby waved them up onto the platform, and motioned them over to a table covered in paperwork. "The whole kingdom is in a tizzy trying to make plans for the big day, and we have things we need to go over. Since you are the higher ranking official at present, the wedding will more than likely take place here."
Zachariah had the decency to at least flush and sputter before Bobby grabbed the parchment out of his hands and read it over, his eyes quickly glancing up and over both boys. When he finished reading it, he handed the paper to Dean. "Dean, do you know where his boy is?"
"Dean, you can't keep being mad at your brother for making his decisions. He is a grown up after all, you both are, and I know that you don't want him to go off and have a life of his own, but he has made his choice. Be happy and enjoy the time he's got left here before he heads off to his new home, alright?" Ellen pressed a kiss to Dean's cheek and looked him in the eye. "It's not like he can't visit; he's just a few towns over and that is what he wanted. You need to respect that and not cause any more tussles, alright?"
Instead of answering he looks over to Jack as they have some sort of unspoken conversation. The feel of the room changes to a cold dis-trustfulness so rapidly that Elle shivers and unconsciously steps closer to Jack. "Dean... I don't think Jack is coming back with us."
It took a moment for Jack to process the words, but he nodded and stepped closer to both Dean and Sam. Without really thinking it through he began the process of flying them from point A to point Baby and only vaguely caught a glimpse of Elle as she flew past him with her cotton candy colored wings. Jack was lucky that he had already envisioned where he wanted to land before he started or he may have actually stumbled and fallen out of the air mid flight. Something was really odd with him lately and other than the influx of power over the last few hours the only difference was Elle. With claims that she could completely just erase the empty and get Cas back, if she could do that it would change his whole future wouldn't it? Would it change what he and Sam had talked about? Would he be able to have a life? Maybe Elle could teach him how to put power into a talisman so that he could just be for a while... but then what would happen to Heaven? They needed a ruler didn't they... or at least someone to make sure that another Apocalypse didn't happen. Right?
The thought crosses Jack's mind as he drains the power from Chuck and watches as the now mortal man looks over at them all in shock. Jack drained him, for sure, but there is something.... off... something was missing. Taking a few deep breaths he lets the new power in him settle, but it just won't lie still. Something is calling to the power, its straining to go somewhere else. Feeling things more powerfully now he can sense so much more, yet he is still unable to determine what is calling to him so much. Looking around he sees it... or well something. Almost like a thread, not quite a thread of fate, but this thread is silver in nature. The pull is coming from that string.
In the aftermath of such a confession there was silence, save for the soft pants of breaths coming from those in the room. Sam spoke first, "wait so helping me and Adam... that got you seen?" Dean looked very, very grey and Sam just looked confused as he asked the question. "You put yourself at risk helping us?" Something in the incredulous tone that Sam used irked both Jack and Elle something fierce.
"That was you? All those times... I- we thought God was bringing Castiel back." Dean corrected himself rather quickly, "how did..."
It was a dismissal if the Winchesters ever saw one so they turned tail and headed back into the keep. Dean let his feet do the walking as he was caught up inside his head and Sam followed with Bobby shouting orders in the background. "So... you gonna talk about it?" Sam finally asked as they approached what looked like a study of some kind. Dean stopped in the middle of the room in front of a large fireplace and turned to look at his brother. There was something off about the look he had on his face so Sam closed the door behind them and sat in one of the large, comfortable looking chairs. "Dean?"
Elle gave Dean a barely discernible nod, "yes. You said yes to Alistair, and when you did you began to take on the demonic façade that tarnishes souls in hell. Thus breaking the first seal, so the Angels attacked hell to get you back. Castiel was considered a flawed angel by heaven and was never actually meant to be the one to rescue you, because Castiel had doubted before." Something uncomfortable passed on both Dean and Elle's face but she continued, "he was meant to be fodder, one to fall in the battle in hell." There was a pause here as the words sank in. "His garrison came to get you out, which is true, but Uriel and the others had already had their doubts in him. He was a fierce warrior though, and a great tactician when it counted so he was able to slip through first and find you."
Castiel finds himself in a strange place near a strange little house with someone he never really wanted to see again; meanwhile the Winchester brothers find themselves in the company of an old friend.
Sam, it seems had followed their voices too, and he returned to the library with two beers and two root beer's. The kids got the root beer obviously and he handed Dean a beer, "What kind of obstacles?"
"One should never meddle with time, but there were... You are my family and sometimes the needs of the family come before space time rules... I brought back Castiel a few times... because I knew that you needed him... I have subtly thwarted God when I could... being locked away in the rock made it more difficult, but I tried to use my double to run interference when I couldn't leave...." Turning back to the group she walked closer but still stopped more than an arms length away from Dean and Sam. "I wanted to make contact with you more than anything, but I knew it wasn't the right time. More and more power has been being funneled into me and I... when the surges hit it is very hard to keep concentration on a double."
? What am I supposed to do now? How am I supposed to be looking after Jack without you?" It was all rambles now, because honestly that was all Dean had left. "You know I have such bad luck with the kid, I haven't.... I haven't always been fair to him and that's on me but... I can't.... Cas he is gonna leave. Just like you but for different reasons, and I'm just... its just gonna be me and I don't think... I can't do this without you Cas. Sam doesn't deserve having to take on me with all this other shit, because I know the moment Jack leaves too... it... I won't have a leg to stand on man." Pulling in another shuddering breath he chokes, because
Just a few more moments of slightly harsh breathing and introspection, followed by halfhearted attempts to clear his throat and one slightly slammed door later, Dean reappeared in the War Room, looking for the rest of the motley crew. Sam was standing there at the edge of the table with his hands on the table and leaning over seemingly giving himself a pep talk. "Sam?" His brother's name was a bit more gruff sounding than normal, but all things considered? That was normal.
anymore. He's a grown man, and if he decides he is done living at that monstrosity the Adlers call an orphanage, then good for him. It's about time, and you," Bobby turns to Dean. "You do right by that boy, or so help me...." With a quick finger wag he turns to Sam and hands him a thick yellowish envelope. "The bride's family sent this to you specifically. I think you should take a look at it and craft a response so it can be sent after dinner. Since our concentration has been taken away from the paperwork for the time being, you boys go figure out what to do about this nonsense and I will handle rounding up some men to go look for the lost Angel."
“Back here!” And crosses his arms while he waits. Sam’s footsteps fall heavy behind him and Dean hears his sharp intake of breath.
Dean finds out Sam knows by accident. He’d been in the kitchen at his brother’s house, talking to Eileen before heading to meet his brother outside in the backyard for grilling. He walks down the hall towards the backdoor when he hears Cas’ voice through the open window to his left. He pauses and looks out to see Cas and Sam sitting next to each other on shitty fold out chairs like the ones Bobby used to keep outside his car lot.
For twelve years, Cas stood next to Dean through apocalypses and leviathans, and broken, beaten, angry Gods — but now, now there’s just… peace. There’s peace and potential in a way Dean isn’t sure he knows how to navigate. He’d barely started thinking about it on earth before he got kebabbed by some goddamn fangs.
And this time Dean turns and walks away, putting the past behind him where it belongs, before Sam can say anything else.
Later, they’re in Dean’s kitchen. He’s at the counter making coffee and Cas is sitting at his table, hands folded on the dark wood. Now there's no trench coat to be seen, tie pulled loose around his neck.
“Don’t be a jerk, and we’ll be fine.” Sam responds, back to the easy cadence he’s known since childhood.
The car comes to a halt in the gravel driveway, and his brother climbs out of the front seat, a six-pack hanging from his right hand and a toothy grin on his face.
Dean raises his eyebrows and nods. It’s not surprising. He suspects he’s been up here for over a century now.
Then came the day when it all came clear, and Castiel shifted. What else was there? As it turned out, there was an easy and comfortable and wonderful and magnificently divine reciprocation.
“Good, I’m glad. Dean deserves it. You both do. Took damn long enough, though.” Sam lets out a soft chuckle. “More profound bond, my ass.”
He reaches for Cas’ hand again and pulls him up so they’re both standing. Cas comes up like it’s nothing, but his eyes are roving, searching Dean’s face for any sign of a lie for his sake. But Dean knows he won’t find anything. He’s telling the truth. Finally, Cas’ face eases into a small smile.
Cas is at his three quarters of the time, anyway, and Dean is content to take the change in their relationship slowly. After all, he’s got all the time in the world now. He’ll tell Sammy eventually, too.
“Wha—” he rolled over onto his back and saw Cas propped up against the headboard, eyes open and watching Dean. “Cas, what the hell, man?”
So, he watched, and he listened. He understood Dean’s anger but didn’t understand how to fix it. Dean could fill the silence with so many voices if he wanted to! Castiel was just one among a horde of family who loved their wayward son.
They never outright said it, but they’ve started their own little, angel-interference free system here. Well, outside of Cas bringing Bobby’s entire auto shop up from Earth, but that was a favor. A gift.
“Could you?” Dean rolled forward to punctuate his question with a kiss, more out of habit than anything. Just because he could. Their lips were soft and dry against each other.
“I think I’m getting very good at sleeping.” Cas gives him a soft smile, reaching to take the food from him.
“You know, Cas, if you helped build this thing for me, you could at least come down and give me some company while I’m driving.” He grinned, but there was something feral in it. “But maybe that would be too hard. No, makes
“Den of iniquity? Yes, Cas. I remember and I remember what a complete shitstorm it was. I laughed so hard my stomach hurt.” He sweeps a few scattered grounds off the linoleum counter and into his palm before turning to throw them in the trash. His head shakes at the memory. They were such idiots.
It’s been some time since Cas showed up in the Impala, and they’ve settled back into familiar territory. He comes and goes, gives Dean space when he needs it or if there’s some big ass angel emergency that Dean is
Castiel grins but doesn’t stop staring. This is his time, a gift he’d been given. And Castiel will be damned —
“Dean, this represents one of the happiest moments of my life. I rebuilt it because –” he breaks off for a second and furrows his brow, his eyes drop to the ground. He changes tracks. “I didn’t think it would cause you distress.” Then he grabs Dean’s hand and pulls him towards the windmill. “Let me show you what I’ve done.”
Dean doesn’t comment but shifts their hands and rubs a thumb over the back of Cas’ in thanks. He pulls away to pile the finished strips onto a paper towel, saving the grease-covered pan to make eggs later. He picks up a piece to pass to Cas.
“Of course.” Dean’s surprised – he thought they were beyond this. Cas’ hands are fisted, resting on his knees. He’s not looking at Dean and it feels deliberate. Dean can feel the anxiety bubbling in the pit of his stomach. What is going on?
Cas shows up one evening, standing on Dean’s front lawn. But when Dean goes to wrap his arms around him — slipping his hands between the suit coat and the cotton of his white shirt — he feels a familiar wetness and smells the stink of iron. He pulls his hand back lightning fast and stares at the red against his fingers.
Dean’s been mad at Cas for a lot of things, and he’s still got resentment in his heart for the sheer senselessness of his own death—like Chuck had one last big cosmic joke to play on the Winchesters— but… he doesn’t for one second blame Cas for it. He may as well blame Sam for not talking him out of that damned hunt. But he won’t. Cas’ hands are on his face now, his thumbs running along the bridge of Dean’s cheekbones. Dean leans forward and kisses him, hoping that Cas can read into what he wants him to know. Cas pulls back and Dean is lost in a blue that’s so bright it’s like nothing else exists.
“He’s feeling awkward, Sam.” Cas’ voice cuts into the argument and Dean whips his head around to glare at him. Cas puts his hands up in a learned gesture of apology. Sam is smirking, a bottle held loosely in his hands hanging over the edge of the chair’s arm.
The first time Cas and Dean fight, it’s ugly and short. It has all the ugliness of equals thinking themselves honest. Of people who are partners day in and day out and can say anything —
The corners of Dean’s mouth lift slightly and Castiel stills his hand; Dean’s not quite awake, but he can sense Castiel is. In a few moments his eyes will open and Castiel will drown as he has a million times, but now he can come as close as he wants and be welcome. And be wanted in return.
.” The words cut through his throat and push out through gritted teeth. “You told me you loved me and then you just disappeared. You told me you loved me and never let me say a goddamned thing, you
Guess who didn't stop lurking the Destiel tag on tumblr until like 3AM. So here is a short introspective Cas piece for you all.
Dean drove and seethed and waited; Castiel kept his head down and did his duties, helping Jack where he needed or guiding angels through their new roles. He couldn’t speak to him, not after—
He braces his feet against the ground to slide out from the undercarriage, wiping the grease from his hands before standing.
“No, Cas, you didn’t. You didn’t think. You just acted and you didn’t think.” Dean’s voice doesn’t hold the anger it did earlier, the sharpness has dulled, more sad than biting. “You—” Now that Cas is here, Dean isn’t sure how to say the words holed up in his belly. So, he doesn’t. He steps in front of Cas and lifts his hands to Cas’ jaw. He looks into those eyes and leans forward and presses his forehead against the angel’s.
It’s something he still thinks with unsettling frequency. When Dean first came to heaven, Castiel felt more human than he had in years. He felt angry that Dean had died in such a painful, senseless manner. Helpless and frustrated — if he’d only been there, he could have saved him. And anxious. Castiel felt anxious. It was not a feeling he was accustomed to in this new heaven that Jack had created, of all places.
Dean sits down heavily on the steps leading up to the entrance to his home. Cas settles in easily next to him. He puts a hand on Dean’s knee. Dean takes the opportunity to cover it with his own.
The kiss she places on his cheek is that last thing he remembers before gasping awake in his bed, glock still lying at his side, bedside lamp illuminating the room. He sits up straight and looks around the room frantically, but it’s empty. “Mom?” he calls with a hoarse voice, but there’s no answer, and he's alone. He sighs, glances over at the small, makeshift desk in the corner, throws the covers off himself, and pads over to it. He pulls the tiny drawer open, takes out some old motel stationary and a pen, and sits down. Running trembling fingers through his hair, he puts the pen to the paper and begins to write.
“I'm Castiel. Dean, just listen to me.” He took a step toward Dean and began to reach out his arms. Alarmed, Dean jerked the gun toward him, nearly crouching as if ready to attack. Well, he was after all.
Dean pushes him again. "And we're gonna find a way to beat Chuck." He pushes him again. "And then we're gonna fight this fucking
Dean shakes his head, still not looking at Cas. “That's the problem,” he chokes on his words. “I don't deserve for you to stay.”
"It…" he sighs again, his voice breaking as he speaks. "It wants me to live my life. And as soon as I allow myself to-to be happy, it said that's when it would come for me."
When Dean finally let's go of the miracle in his arms, Sam is quick to take his place, though their hug isn't quite as intimate. There's a marked difference in the way his brother holds Cas; a different kind of strain to his voice as he tells the angel how happy he is to see him. But he hears something in the silence of the night, something he knows he isn't meant to hear given the hushed tone in Sammy's words. After the heartfelt, “we're so glad to have you back,” and, “we've missed you, Cas,” Dean hears, “he's just not the same without you.”
"I think…" she places her finger on her chin, "I just might have to postpone my slumber for a while. Because the thought of watching you shrivel and cry, mourning your loser boyfriend here? Well, that angst is just too delicious to pass up. Mmm, I can just taste it!" She licks her lips and smiles.
Dean shifted to hold his weight on his elbow, tracing a finger lightly down the side of Cas’ face. “Why would you hide it from me?”
“I agonized over it for weeks,” he took a deep breath, “well, weeks on earth, days in heaven, until Gabriel cornered me, slapped this ridiculous thing on my coat and said, and I quote, ‘I'm damn tired of watching you pine over that hot piece of monkey meat down there, little bro. Besides that, his giraffe of a brother is much hotter. But if you must choose the Neanderthal of the two, so be it.’ And the next thing I knew, I was standing on your doorstep, while my older brother tried to put dents in your door. He might've left a few.”
, he decides to himself, and he needs...some time.  He follows Cas, feeling the burning stare of Sam, at least, but ignores it. Two steps over the threshold of the kitchen door, and Dean is grabbing the angel's beer bottle, placing both of them in the sink, turning slowly and leaning against the counter. Cas is facing him, head cocked to the side, and Dean's almost certain his brow is furrowed in that way that is endearingly Cas, but he can't seem to meet his eyes.
Jack looks at Dean almost incredulously, but straightens his back, his expression turning resigned, yet determined. “Yes,” he replies, “I understand, Dean Winchester.”
“But, that’s not--” he starts, but cuts himself off because he knows whatever he was about to say is utter bullshit, especially given the skeptical look on Mary’s face. So, he rephrases. “How do you know…” of
Dean turns them and pushes Cas towards the Impala, and the angel lets him. He shoves him against it and though Cas let's out a huff, still he lets him. "Is this? Real?"
… when they've just gotten her back… well, it’s unbearable to even think. “Sam?” His voice raises a little.
“Fuck! I'm so fucking sorry. I shouldn't have said that to you…” he rambles, each word sounding more desperate than the last, “when you died, I couldn't… I-I wasn't…
He's uncertain how long he’s watched the nature programs, there have been several, when his phone begins to vibrate on the mattress next to him. He blinks, startled slightly and squints at the clock on the nightstand. The glowing red numbers read 3:15 am. Castiel picks up his phone, seeing that the name on the caller ID is Sam.
that nothing is that easy. “But...it didn't want to let me go. It tried to keep me there by showing me all my failings, all the misery I caused here.” Dean's heart clenches and rage boils in his blood at this thing he doesn't even know as he listens to his angel's tone turn wistful and fucking melancholy.
Cas was generous with the lube, and his fingers were nimble and gentle as he worked one, two and finally three into him. He stretched and fucked Dean with those fingers until the hunter was a quivering mess on the mattress. Dean felt the loss when Cas’ fingers vacated, but just as soon, Cas was hovering over him, pushing his knees up a little further. And lining himself up against Dean.
Dean sighs. He closes his eyes and counts to ten, blowing out a slow, cleansing breath. Now is not the time to flip out on the object of his fucking desire. "How, uh, how long you been standing there, Cas?" He asks as calmly as he can.
Cas’ face nearly split in two at that. “Good,” he said, “Gabriel would be pissed after all the work he did.”
Dean dropped the gun to his side and took several steps backward, grabbing a fistful of his hair and blinking rapidly.
Cas. "You're wrong about something," Dean says, walking towards him. Cas looks perplexed. "You said you can't let me love you and you're wrong." He walks right up into Cas's personal space.
Dean nods. He can't do anything but stare into Cas’ eyes until something clicks inside him like a missing puzzle piece snapping itself into place and he realizes. He wants this man/angel, more than he's ever wanted anything in his life.
Castiel would shudder at the thought if he was human, instead he stands statuesque, his mind reeling with the fact that he was outsmarted  by a witch, a
The angel gasps on a sob, "You've got Jack. With him, the two of you, the real Billie… Dean, you've got a chance--"
Dean no longer has control of himself, his hands gliding down over quivering abs to work on his belt buckle as Cas’ breath comes faster, labored, and it's taking too fucking long.
"When you told me you loved me," the angel smiles at him; it's the saddest smile he's ever seen from Cas, and it shatters his heart into so many pieces, he can almost feel the shards stabbing through his ribs, "I pushed it down. I-I was with you, but I wouldn't let myself think about it. I
Dean doesn't know how long he's been like this. He may have dozed off because the song he's hearing now is several tracks down from where he started, and he remembers the others as only faint sounds in the background of his mind. He stretches, blinks a few times before opening his eyes to see what time it is, and…
Dean's eyes go wide with terror as he stares at Cas's crumpled face, a multitude of emotions passing through the angel's oceanic eyes; sadness, love, remorse, pain.
“I'm sorry,” Dean whispers, “I just...I just need to touch you.” he clears his raw throat. “I just need to make sure you're real.”
“I’m not going to call you that, Dean. You’re beautiful and complicated. Rough around the edges, and soft and tender as well. I love you.”
Cas furrowed his brow in confusion before realizing what Dean meant and throwing his head back to laugh earnestly. “No, Dean. But if you'd rather refer to my semen as grace, you're more than welcome to.”
Dean nods, jaw clenching tighter, nostrils flaring as the tears flow freely now. Nothing he does is drying it up. But Cas just holds him. He holds him and lets him cry. He holds him and lets his body tremble in his arms. When Dean's knees start to give out, Cas holds him tighter and lifts him up.
No sooner was Dean’s shirt removed that Cas’ hands were everywhere: fingers kneading into the flesh of his back, dipping down just under the waistband of his jeans, teasing, pulling out again to brush down over his denim clad ass, digging his nails in, sliding around to the front, teasing at the waistband band there and the buttons on his fly. All the while teeth were tugging at lips, and tongues were pressing together, swirling and sucking, Dean's hand planted in Cas’ hair, tangling, pulling him closer to delve deeper into his mouth. It wasn't enough. Cas popped open the first button on Dean's fly and crept behind the band of his boxer briefs, dipping down and ghosting over the already weeping head of Dean's cock. Dean bucked into it, the friction of the movement alone sending a shockwave through him. He couldn't help it and he couldn't fucking take it anymore.
The slow, steady path of Cas’ fingers along his flesh is lulling him, and he drifts off for a moment. He doesn't know of how much time has passed when his thoughts wake him again, but Cas is patiently waiting for him to continue.
"As you wish," Cas smiles before kissing him again. "Just… give me a minute to prepare you." His hand begins to glow, and Dean holds up his own, acutely aware that the angel's grace is dwindling.
"When's it gonna end, man? This… this loss, and this fucking pain? I'm tired of fighting the way I feel about you."
He no sooner had the words out of his mouth when the wind picked up, thunder clapped and lightning struck right in front of him. But it wasn't lightning at all, it was Castiel. Blue eyes glowing neon, white light radiated out of him like a nuclear bomb and… wings.
"You probably don't remember, but he moved out for a few days, just, um…" she falters and looks at him with pain in her eyes, "just before I died."
Sam and Cas spoke at the same time and all Dean could do was laugh, big and hearty and silently thank that little punk bastard, Gabriel, for bringing back
“I'm going… to kill…” he murmured between wet kisses, working his way up to the skin just behind Cas’ ear. “Rowena… and Amara…” He felt a surge of energy that settled deep in his belly when Cas shivered at Dean's breath against his ear. “For doing this… to us.”
He feels Cas for the first time, all of him, hard and pressed against him, and he's never been more aroused in his entire life. But it's too fast, and he's too wound up. He knows if he doesn't slow it down, he'll never last, so he takes his angel’s face in his hands and pushes back gently, breaking the kiss. Cas’ expression twists into confused concern.
Mary looks at him, her eyes boring into his soul. “No, not at all.” Dean furrows his brow, confused yet again. “The letter was nice, but it was just words on paper. Your dad never spoke those words to me with his own mouth. I never got to see the expression on his face when he said them. I-I never got to see that level of vulnerability from him, and he never got to see my face in response to those spoken words.” She sighs, “I think… I think writing down your feelings is a good idea, though.”
. He smiles to himself at that. They really have come a long way. Pride swells in his chest, both for the humans he always watched over, and strangely enough, for being a part of them now. It's bittersweet, though, because he's not human, and he's barely an angel. He wasn't lying to Mary Winchester when he told her he isn't sure if he belongs. He
flicks her wrist, and Dean goes flying, the wind knocked out of him as he crashes into a wall of files and slumps to the floor. He catches his breath long enough for a cursory "fuck you" to leave his lips. Cas rushes over, hands grabbing onto Dean's shoulders to help him up, eyes begging him not to try again. The angel holds onto Dean tightly, as if to drive his point home. And the
as he told Sam. And then… it all went to shit. It was a series of events, he's certain, that brought them to the breaking point. Most of them a blur in his memory now. The big event obviously being his mom's death, the tragedy with Jack after, but the catalyst? The catalyst that brought
"And how do you know that, huh? Cas?" Dean laughs without an ounce of humor. "You don't! You're just trying to make me feel better and I want you to stop!"
Sam just gives him a look. Castiel doesn't even have to try to interpret it. He's knows exactly what Sam is saying, but he still isn't confident Dean will talk to him. Nonetheless, he raises his arms in a makeshift shrug and nods. “I'll try. Of course, I'll try.”
Sam sucks in a breath, breaking out of whatever thoughts plague him, to look at Dean. There's something behind his eyes Dean can't place. “I… yes, I saw him, of course I saw him, but…” he trails off, turning his attention to the nephilim.
A noise escapes Dean’s chest that he can’t quite place, and quite fucking frankly, doesn’t want to. So, in true Dean Winchester style, he changes the subject. “I still don’t understand how you’re here. Is this even real? Are-are you just a figment of my imagination? Am I dreaming? You can’t be a ghost because Ca…” he clears his throat before his voice breaks on the angel’s name, “Cas said he saw you. Happy in heaven with Dad. So how?”
Sam doesn't budge. Instead, he inches closer to Dean. “I can't explain why he's not a baby, but I'm not moving, Dean. I'm not.” He shakes his head slowly, swallows the thick lump in his throat. He knows his brother won't hurt him. Not really. “I need you to listen to me right now.”
he thought he was. “Because it sounds to me like you've been talking to people you shouldn't, getting dirt on me and my brother just to, I don't know what… fuck with me? Let me tell you something real about me,
"Is there something I can help you with?" The angel asks, brow furrowed, blue eyes nearly glowing in the hall light.
Dean picks up the paper and turns around. He glances at Cas briefly, but his heart threatens to stop beating altogether at the sight, so he shifts his eyes back to his own words. He decides not to tell him how he was nudged into doing this by his dead mother's ghost. Instead, he takes a deep breath, runs his fingers through his hair, and says, "the last couple days, I… haven't been doing research like I said I was."
“That's right,” he says proudly and matter of factly. “I don't want anything to do with that ass clown.” Dean and Sam neither one can feign their chuckles at that. But Jack's expression turns to one of concern once again as Cas continues to stare blankly. “Is it...is it okay if I call you that? My mom said you would protect me. I...want you to be my father if that's okay.”
Dean barely glances at his brother and Jack as he silently leads Cas to the hallway. Jack is enthralled in a random Tom & Jerry episode, which Dean mentally high fives himself for, since he was the one who broadened the boys horizons on good cartoons, and Sam is looking one hundred percent bored as hell. The younger hunter narrows his eyes as the two of them pass, but seems to quickly get a clue, widen those hazels, and turn away in a flash. It's unfortunate, really, since he misses the bird Dean flashes him.
Dean takes a deep breath, trying to quell the panic bubbling up inside him. He looks down at the paper.
fucking annoying. "Oh you sad, sad little angel. Falling in love with a human?" She tsks, "The most pathetic of any creature I've ever had the displeasure of meeting." She looks between the two of them, teeth-showing smile as she continues sauntering towards them.
control of our lives. He's only the writer, Dean, but WE… we are the editors. Why can't you understand that?" His voice is lower, but picks up as his anger takes hold again. He steps into Dean's personal space and levels him with a challenging glare. "The
“Cas,” his expression has sobered now. His eyelids have squeezed closed, brow furrowed as if he has more to say, but can’t get it out. Castiel sees an opportunity to open the flood gates, so to speak, and so he does.
Another sharp intake of breath. “YOUR GRANDSON IS OUT THERE...ALONE. CONFUSED. DANGEROUS… and you're, what? Oblivious? Blatantly ignoring EVERYTHING as usual?”
Dean seems taken aback momentarily by his icy reception. “What?” Dean mirrors, scowl still in place. Castiel sighs. Brows raised in challenge, he stares at the insufferable man in front of him. “I… wanted to talk to you,” Dean says flatly.
"Yes," Cas breathes into Dean's mouth, and Dean closes the gap. He kisses him hard, deep, pouring all of his anger, his frustration, his pain, his longing into it. Cas grips Dean's sides, then wraps his arms around Dean until there is no space between them. He kisses Dean back with just as much emotion, just as much pain and frustration, and Dean suddenly feels like he's flying. They devour each other until there's nothing left to fight about. Nothing left to keep them at odds… at least nothing on the surface. When Dean finally pulls away, they're both breathless, Cas's arms still tightly surrounding the hunter, and Dean's hands firmly planted in the angel's hair, fingers buried in the dark, impossibly messy strands.
in that way, but he shrugs and gives Cas the god's honest truth. “He chose you, man. He doesn't want anything to do with that ass clown, Lucifer.” The angel's wide, ocean blue eyes turn again to Jack, who is now no longer shocked at himself, but smiling instead.
the person he cares about the most. He’s been in touch with her since she left. By the way,” she grins, “please give him my blessing on Eileen. I adore that girl.” Dean grits his teeth in response and gives her a fake smile, one that she recognizes immediately. “Come on, Dean. Cas is still here with you. You just need to talk to him.”
I'm--" he shakes his head and turns away for a moment before looking back at Dean with tears swimming in his eyes. The pinball in Dean's head breaks through another barrier. Dean wants to go to him. Despite himself, goddamn it, he wants to wrap him in his arms and profess his forgiveness, but he's not about to do that. "I failed you and I know I did. I failed everyone, and I can never make amends for that."
Dean fights the eye roll that comes naturally to him, but he loses that battle. “More privately, man, come on, don't make me say it,” he pleads.
He sighs, shrugging that tumultuous feeling off as quickly as he can, replacing it in his mind's eye with the expression of unequivocal relief and gratitude that adorned Dean's dirty, bloodstained, yet still remarkably beautiful face afterwards. And in the Impala, on the long drive home, they let the music engulf them. It's this song, he remembers the most.
Castiel will never forget that moment, because that was the first time Dean slid his hand towards the angel's; and the first time a tentative pinky finger curled around his own.
"It was Jack," Cas begins, "when he died I went to heaven to get him. Y-You and Sam were here with Lily Sunder, remember?” Dean nods, brows furrowed. "The Shadow, the, uh, entity in charge of The Empty, it-it was after Jack."
it - which makes him even harder - and kneels down in front of him. Without a word, he licks the angel's cock from base to tip and flicks his tongue.
Dean gasps. “I'm gonna- I can't- fuck-” Broken sentences are all he can get out at this point. His brain is short-circuiting.
Cas cries. His thrusts become erratic. Dean's tongue licks at Cas’ mouth, his free hand tangles fingers in the back of Cas’ hair, and he pulls back slightly, their foreheads still touching.
The drive back to the bunker, after saying a final goodbye to the shell that was supposed to be Mary Winchester, is daunting in every sense of the word. Castiel sits in the backseat of the Impala, Sam and Dean in the front, which isn't unusual, but there's no music, no words spoken; anger, despair and regret hangs in the air like a suffocating fog around them, and it just feels so
"Don't say you're sorry for loving me, goddamn it," Dean growls. "We fight this black, gooey piece of shit right now."
I’m close, but I want you to look at me,” his tone pleading between breaths. Castiel nods in reply. “I want to see you when you come, Cas.” The angel leans down and kisses him hard, pistoning his hips faster and faster until he’s seeing stars and crying out Dean’s name like an anguished prayer. Dean’s quick to follow, his eyes rolling back in his head before squeezing them shut, a low moan rolling off is tongue as he spills all over his belly between them. Castiel releases Dean’s legs and collapses on top of him, kissing him with every ounce of love he has in him.
In the boldest move he's ever made, Dean leans into him. The closer he gets to Cas’ face, the faster Dean's chest rises and falls, but Cas never closes his eyes. It's not until Dean presses their foreheads together that Cas’ eyes flutter closed.
"Shh, Cas." Dean smiles softly, and Cas obeys. "M-My whole life, I've been a soldier. What-what I felt about people always got sidelined in order to get the job done, ya know?" He notices Cas nodding again in understanding. "I remember feeling love from my mom when I was little, but a-after she died, I-I dunno, man, I thought what my dad showed me was love and I guess…"
“Whoa, hey hey. No giant people get to pass out today. Let's get you inside and sit you down before I even think of telling you about the massive crush Gabriel has on you.”
Dean stares in shocked amazement. If he's being honest, he doesn't know whether he wants to be pissed about his measly human hands or impressed by his angel's power. He goes with option C. “Fuck, that's sexy. Get over here.” He pulls Cas over by his now, buckle-free pants and kisses him again before finishing the job, pushing the pants and boxers down to Cas’ ankles.
Castiel turns his head slightly to the side to address him. “To. My. Room,” tone clipped and equally petulant.
Dean grabs him again, slamming him harder against the wall, leaning in closer, and Castiel feels dizzy. He knows it's not from the hit.
Mary cocks her head to the side, blue eyes thoughtful and musing. “I know you’re not, Dean. Sam doesn’t have the same experiences as you. He didn’t have the same upbringing as you did, even though he was in the same place, did he?” Dean closes his eyes and shakes his head. “He doesn’t have the same memories of me, or the same anger you harbor for what you went through growing up.”
"Oh, and I'm sure you're gonna explain it to me in a way that makes sense, right? No thanks. We've already fucking
Dean's mouth twitches, a smile trying to form without his permission, but he doesn't quite let it. Instead, he fists the lapels of Cas's trench coat, tight and rough. "Is this real?" He can't tell if he's genuinely asking or if he's challenging.
he groans, fingers tangling in Cas's dark tendrils - something his fingers have always itched to do. Cas sucks and laves, giving deans nipples the same attention Dean gave his, and the man's knees nearly buckle. He moves his hands to blindly reach for Cas's belt, finding it easy enough to discard, and moves to work on the button and zipper.
Once inside, Dean lets his hand drop to his side and falls in behind Cas at the top of the stairs. Awaiting at the bottom is an emotional-looking Jack, watching raptly as Cas descends. They're face to face, finally and Dean and Sam can only watch as a silent exchange takes place between the two human-but-not-humans.
He lets go of his own cock and focuses on Cas, doubling down, fingering the delicate flesh between his ass cheeks. Cas moans Dean's name, thrusting erratically, his face buried in the curve of Dean's neck.
Castiel squeezed his eyes shut and pinched the bridge of his nose. When he opened them again, Dean was shocked by the hurt filled glare, and the man's trembling lips as he said, “No, of course… you wouldn't remember that.” Dean narrowed his eyes at him, but before he could ask just what the hell he didn't ‘remember,’ Castiel was speaking again. “You asked about my name, my odd name. It's an angelic name. And the reason I know all this, Dean, is because I'm an angel.” He pointed at the gift tag, almost as if he was trying to make a joke, his mouth ghosting a smile, but failing miserably.
Please don't forget the comments. They provide me with a well balanced diet and nutrients to keep writing!
Sam's expression is riddled with concern but Dean ignores it. The muscles in his arm cinch tighter, fingers flex around the handle of his glock. “I swear to fucking God, Sam, I'm not playing. If you don't move…”
Cas. Easing Dean through the first kiss of many. The tugging of clothes, lips turning rough and frantic. Ecstasy.
His perfunctory drive back almost lands him in a ditch once or twice, so he reluctantly turns on the radio, a distraction from the thoughts that plague him. He instantly recognizes the melody flooding through his speakers. A sad smile does, in fact, creep across his lips at the sudden influx of memories it provides him.
“Yes,” Cas agrees, flicking open the button on Dean's fly with one hand, the other gripping Dean's head and pulling him in for a blistering kiss.
Dean paces, back and forth across the seemingly peaceful, suburban road, but he knows it's the opposite of peaceful. He knows there's no way out of this; he knows all of these people he's trying to save are going to die, including the people he loves, and he knows it's all going to be for nothing.
is going on here, Cas? Does Chuck have the power to have some kinda spell on Death?” Dean rambles, not particularly paying much attention to Cas as he keeps pacing. "We need a plan--"
Dean loses himself in the feel of Cas's body against him. His hands slide down the angel's chest, deftly freeing the buttons from their fabric shackles, his fingers ghosting across the toned skin in front of him. He needs more.
Dean opens his mouth to protest again, when the door blows open, the random desk chair barricading the door splintering in pieces, and scattering across the floor. The sound is deafening, but again, Dean can only seem to hear his own pulse throbbing in his ears. He turns, eyes swimming in tears, expression defiant, angry as he watches "Billie" saunter into the room.
He knows he's being an asshole. Knows, but can't bring himself to care. His eyes scan his surroundings. It's dark, darker than he remembers it being, save for the porch light above the door of the cabin showcased behind Sam. He squints at the light, eyes scanning the exterior of the structure. There are no lights on except for one… faint. And then he remembers. He looks at his younger brother's face finally, his eyes going wide for a moment as he takes in Sam's expression, somewhere between shell-shocked, sadness and exhaustion. Dean recovers quickly and  clears his throat.
Dean dropped to his knees, grasping at the belt around Cas’ pants and pulling at it almost frantically. He pulled the fly open with force, the button skittering across the concrete floor, zipper ruined as he tore the pants down Castiel's legs. His angel didn't have time to protest the utter demise of his dress pants before Dean was mouthing at the head of his cock, which was impressively tenting Cas’ boxers.
Castiel’s insides are a twisted mess of emotion as he bounces from understanding to utter devastation for both of them. “I'm sorry, Sam. I'm so sorry.” Sam nods in acknowledgement, audibly swallowing what Castiel knows are tears wanting to resurface. He reaches both hands over and covers Sam's with his. Sam looks up at him now, his eyes swimming, unable to keep the pain at bay. Castiel contemplates hugging him, but hesitates.
“Honey, I’m home!” called a cloying voice. A tall man with light brown hair entered the room, and looked entirely unfazed at the scene of Cas and Mariah in flagrante delicto. “I cannot believe you two started the Christmas party without me!” Cas’ eyes flew open and he gave the man a withering look. Mariah pulled off with a soft pop and wiped her mouth with the back of her hand.
Then Cas rushes forward, their hands grabbing one another’s faces as he kisses Dean again, then pulls back just far enough to touch eyes again. A beat. Then.
. The word ricocheted around inside his head, fresh from his encounter with Jo and his trip down memory lane. “I, uh, really” Dean took a breath. “Missed you, Charlie,” he finished haltingly.
Dean approached Jack. The nephilim was still hovering near his stocking, shoving a candy bar into his mouth. Apparently Santa had remembered to bring Jack some nougat. Dean glanced at his brother, who gave a half shrug and indicated Cas subtly with his head. Of course. Cas really took the whole stepdad thing seriously with Jack.
“I simply refuse to tolerate your ridiculous belittling of your worth and of my devotion to you, my love.” Cas continued stroking his head, the soft touch a counterpoint to the fire of certainty in his voice. “I think” Cas paused a moment, hurried back in a tumble of words that betrayed his nerves, “I think you need something to occupy that smart mouth of yours, Dean.” he finished, smooth as silk, and goddamn if Dean’s mouth didn’t salivate immediately like Pavlov’s dog. Dean had already licked his lips and parted them, eyes closed, expecting to hear a zipper and feel a plush cock head push past his lips, but instead, Cas’ hand returned to its grip on Dean’s hair. “I’m going to gag you with my tie. If you want me to stop, simply pray to me. Do you understand?” Blue eyes pierced Dean’s with the question. Dean opened his mouth to reply but Cas shook his head. “No. Try it. Pray.”
She stood still as a statue, unblinking yet unmenacing. Her hair was long and golden, carefully arranged in gentle waves. Mindless of the cold, she wore not her usual hunter’s jeans but rather a long, white sundress, the kind Dean knew chicks sometimes wore to outdoor music festivals. The dress was cinched with a southwestern-style silver concho belt, studded with turquoise. Her well-worn shit-kickers completed the ensemble, Dean noted with a small smile.
Cas’ shoulders slumped. He didn’t answer. Jack drew a breath to ask another question, but just then Cas slipped his trenchcoat off his shoulders. His mouth a grim line, he grasped the two tails and split it cleanly in two.
Dean gaped as his brother and the nephilim maneuvered the tree down the stairs. Sam hoisted the tip up as Jack dropped the trunk to the ground. The spruce was dark green, and even taller than Sam. Jack was practically bursting, hands on hips of his plaid flannel thermal jacket, cheeks pink from exertion and cold. “We got a tree!” he announced happily with obvious pride.
“You’re not responsible for everyone and everything, Dean.” Cas meant that. Humans were dying every second of every day, all around the world. War, disease, accidents, and the natural failings of biology were as predictable as the sun rising and setting.
Dean narrowed his eyes. “I don’t believe it. This is some sort of trick. What are you?” He rose, striding across to his duffel for a test kit of silver, holy water.
Dean’s mouth is opening and closing, but no speech is coming out. Cas plows on, determined. “I wasn’t sure you’d like that idea, though, since it meant so much between you and Sam first, and I don’t like the idea of you being reminded of your brother when you see it. I would place it where the amulet would lie if I wore it, here, next to my heart.” Cas points at a spot on his chest where the second button of his shirt lies over his sternum. He can feel his heart racing, and realizes he’s been rambling, covering Dean’s conspicuous silence with his own chatter.
“I can’t believe you Superman’d me!” Dean shouted over the rushing wind. He couldn’t help grinning widely as they soared over the Flint Hills, the lack of moonlight making their rolling curves seem sharper and deeper.
Sam groaned. “You know, when I imagined getting in your bed, this isn’t exactly how I pictured it.” He was shirtless, in clean shorts, and Odie was straddling his back. She swatted his shoulder playfully.
“Fine! Okay, I get the picture. Warm bath it is.” Dean grabbed his stuff and made a beeline for the bathroom, calling over his shoulder “Just for a bath! Not for the other thing!” He hurried through his nighttime ablutions and emerged fresh from the tub some time later, warm, but no less awake.
back at the bunker with Cas. They had sat together on Dean’s bed, comfortable with beer and Funyuns. Dean’s heart clenched as he remembered fielding Cas’ questions. “How can a Pig and a Frog be romantically attracted to each other? How do they reproduce? This movie is extremely scientifically inaccurate, Dean.”
Bobby chuckled. “Well, I got a hall pass, I guess you could say.” He scratched his beard a bit, looking sheepish. “And I’m here for you, Dean.”
He scored a mango half into edible cubes, which clung to the thin green skin until he chewed them off, their sweet juice dribbling down his chin. Odie strode confidently up the beach carrying her surfboard, water droplets on her skin and hair catching the morning sun. She gave Sam a grin that was all white teeth and a big wave with her free hand. Sam waved back and tried not to notice the way her board shorts hugged her strong thighs or the way her yellow bikini top set off her radiant skin.
Dr. Lea cleared her throat and said, “you may have found that exercise uncomfortable or challenging. Perhaps you felt exposed or vulnerable. Perhaps you felt awkward or tense. Hopefully you were able to recognize your partner’s soul and the energy of their life force.” With this she turned to Cas and Dean. “How did you two respond to the exercise?”
Minutes tick by in companionable silence. They never need to say much. Dean gratefully sighs as he downs the dregs of his first cup and turns to refill his coffee mug. Cas knows he’s usually pretty worthless until he’s well into his second helping. Dean takes his prize and moves to retreat to his bedroom, shuffling towards the kitchen door. He jerks back, however, his robe’s belt caught on the kitchen drawer handle below the coffee maker. Dean yanks it back, irritated, and his robe falls open, draping off one shoulder.
Bobby flinched. “Sometimes. Only soul-mates share heavens, and apparently I wasn’t hers.” Bobby slumped his shoulders. “Once in a while I get to hunt in the woods with kid-you and kid-Sam. Even more rarely, I get to pal around with Rufus. Don’t really get to see any of you as often as I’d like.”
Sam gave a barely perceptible nod and she rolled off of him, grabbing the salt. Sam smoothly pulled his iron knife from his boot by the bed. The rose in unison, back-to-back, both scanning the room for the spirit.
Playing the part of a devoted boyfriend, Cas pulled out Dean’s chair, which earned him a glower for his trouble. It seemed as though Dean was always ready with a reminder of his feelings on romantic relationships with men any time Cas ever required one.
Odie gave him a long look, then silently passed over a condom from the now-almost-empty tote bag from Timea’s clinic. Sam took it from her like the peace offering it was. He cleared his throat. “You know, when you said online your parents were dead, I assumed vamps or something. I drew a straight line between two points, but I see now that was pretty presumptuous of me.”
Dean whirls on him, defensive. “Hey! It’s a thing people do. Like, soldiers and gang members and shit. It’s totally a thing.” he repeats, before backing out the door, eyes wild.
Dean feels Cas’ eyes on the back of his neck. He throws caution to the wind, turns quickly…only to see Cas’ door click shut. Miserable, Dean clicks off the light above the ratty pull-out sofa.
Cas tried to fold Dean into his arms for a sweet hug but Dean slipped the angel’s grip with a shrug.
When Sam emerged with not only clean hands but a clean face, shirt, and fresh coat of deodorant to boot, Odie met him at the table with fish cooked in foil, potatoes, sliced papaya, and Beliken beers. Sam sat and shook his head slightly at the woman who was regarding him with a raised eyebrow.
Dr. Lea turned to Cas. “Cas, do you have any trouble trusting Dean? Or is he the only partner in your relationship struggling with trust?”
“Goddamnit, Sammy! You don’t understand the first fucking thing about me! I don’t want to go anywhere or do anything else. I want my only family in this godforsaken world to stay with me and do the only job I’ve ever been good for my whole miserable life! The only person who wants this is you, so don’t try to convince yourself you’re doing me some sort of favor.” Dean pushed past Sam, throwing the taller man’s hand off his shoulder as he headed for the stairs.
Dean took a deep breath as if he had just surfaced from a long submersion underwater. Cas just looked down and to the side, but did not move his hands from Dean’s.
Dean looked away, searching the ceiling for words. Nothing was written there, so he tried his best. “I know you like them.” He couldn’t really verbalize the tug he had felt, the visceral belief that Cas should have this kitten the second he laid eyes on it in that pickup truck bed, climbing over its siblings and mewling helplessly. “You can take her with you, or if you want, she can live here at the bunker.” Dean plowed on, relentless in the face of what seemed now his total humiliation. “I can take care of her when you need to go do, you know, angel stuff.” Dean looked at the floor to see if any better words were there. Nope. “If you want.” Dean repeated, lamely.
“Sit facing one another on the mat, either cross-legged or however is comfortable for you.” Said Dr. Lea, and began walking around the classroom, helping couples adjust. Dean hitched his jeans up his thighs a bit before sitting on the woven mat by their feet, settling his butt on a circular floor pillow with some kind of Moroccan rug look to it. Cas sank to his knees in front of Dean and Dean’s heart did a weird flop inside his chest as he found himself face-to-face with Cas’ crotch. Then Cas settled himself cross-legged opposite Dean.
Dean’s shaking his head, protesting too much. “No, no. I mean, we’re just friends.” His smirk twists into a grimace.
Cas exhales, suddenly relieved. This is an opening, one he had been hoping for. “I was actually hoping for your advice,” he begins. Dean brightens at this, and almost jumps off the bed. Cas takes a couple of steps forward.
His discomfort quickly abated as soon as the massage began. Brian and Kelsi began a well-practiced professional routine of working detachedly on Dean and Cas’ muscles, and pretty soon Dean forgot all about Cas and just focused on the sensation of release in his tight back and shoulder muscles. Brian put his considerable bulk into ironing out and smoothing knots Dean hadn’t even realized he had, probably from too many miles in the Impala, nights on lumpy motel mattresses, and fights with supernatural baddies. Dean felt his shoulders descend away from their tightly-held position near his ears, melting down his spine. He couldn’t remember the last time he felt this relaxed.
Sam shook his head quickly. “No, I’m just surprised. You never mentioned it. Online.” His mind was racing back to their many late-night typed interactions, some of which had become rather lengthy and personal. He flushed quickly, suddenly embarrassed. Definitely some stuff he wouldn’t have told a woman. Stuff about his family, even Jess.
Dean balled his fists. What a bunch of assholes, talking about Cas and Jack like that. “Enough.” Dean firmly said. “I’ve seen the damn movie. It’s not a mystery who they’re talking about. You can skip the dramatic cemetery reveal. I just don’t see why I should care what these losers think, anyway.”
If he was really willing to look honesty in the face, he’d admit he only agreed to the case to get some beach time and possibly, maybe, just a little part of him wanted to get his brother and Castiel into a couples’ retreat. But Sam was not on trial here.
“I’m fine, Cas, just leave me alone,” Dean snarled, pushing Cas’ hand away, ignoring Cas’ drawn brows, pursed lips.
Dean made the mistake of looking at its eyes. He told himself he just wanted to see, you know? Could he tell it wasn’t Cas in there, looking out at him? Was there something to give it away, like the lens flare on camera? But it was too much, like it always was. Looking in Cas’ eyes was looking at something so pure and beautiful it hurt. Dean’s heart broke.
Sam stalks past Castiel down the hallway and Cas is left with his confusion and his initial hypothesis, now blossoming into a full-blown theory. He’s shaking, with hope and anxiety and fear. He told the entity he would fight it for eternity. He chose to live, knowing Dean might never choose him back. Cas had never considered what would happen if Dean did. He had never dared to.
” read the sign, again in Sam’s hand. Dean craned his neck, searching the garage. All the cars and motorcycles had similar signs.
He turned to Odie. “Do you want to drive?” he asked. “I can get her body there, if you start it up and pop the trunk for me.” Sam was worried about her but didn’t want her to think he perceived her as weak. He still remembered his first real case with a god. His first time he killed a human vessel. Odie was tough as hell, but they were a team, and he wanted to help if he could. She nodded her assent and disappeared out the door.
Dean shook his head in disbelief. “Bobby? What…how…” Dean closed the door but didn’t put his gun down. He did lower it, though. Bobby’s eyes tracked it below his trucker cap.
“I wanted to apologize for that night,” Dean said quickly, before he could chicken out. The silence ticked on between them. Dean took another breath and soldiered on. “I’m sorry I got scared and pushed you away.”
Dean sat up, mindful to keep his sheet tucked around his hips. Cas stood, as per his usual, in Dean’s personal space, but made no move to touch Dean. Dean looked up to meet Cas’ blue eyes, and saw the concern there. Dean opened his mouth to quip and make that look go away on Cas’ face, but the words got caught and he just ended up taking a breath and then closing his mouth, looking more like a goldfish than his ‘cool’ self-image. Cas didn’t break eye contact but every so slowly, as if Dean was a horse Cas was afraid to spook, placed his hand gently on Dean’s back and began rubbing counter-clockwise circles there.
Cas took a long draw of tequila, wincing at the burn before acknowledging her words. “Kid’s not my problem anymore.”
Dean took a deep breath and regarded his reflection. Cas rewarded him by sucking his earlobe into his mouth. The flat of the blade caressed Dean’s back before slicing through Dean’s shirt in long, capable strokes. Tropical air hit Dean’s skin, mingling with the sweat beading along his spine. The dance continued, with the razor-sharp edge removing Dean’s clothing, strip by strip, button by button, until Dean was left, trembling in nothing but his boots and belt. Dean’s arms shook with the effort of holding the mirror. Cas untied the gag then faced Dean again, standing just beyond the mirror. “What do you see, Dean?”
“Dean and I will clean up here so the resort staff don’t get suspicious.” Cas tacked on. Dean opened his mouth, about to protest, then closed it again at Cas’ firm glower.
Dean shrugged noncomittally. He was a huge Bill Murray fan. Of course he had seen it, but he wasn’t going to give anything up easily. He was even more reluctant to admit he had seen
Charlie just gave him a look of pity and understanding. “C’mon” she urged, dragging him up the stairs. Dean gave one last look at the trio around the tree, now exchanging presents wrapped in old magazine paper. He caught a flash of Cas’ teeth as he smiled broadly at the assorted-flavored Osage honey sticks Jack had bought him at a convenience store in the Ozarks. The metal door of the bunker clanged, cutting off the beautiful sight of that smile.
Sam emerged some time later. His eyes were a little watery but otherwise he seemed lighter, freer, happier. Mia Vallens waited in the doorway, her brown eyes wide. She raised a slim arm, inviting Dean into the office. “Are you ready, Dean?” she asked. For a woman so recently stalked by her emotionally abusive ex-lover, in Dean’s skin nonetheless, she seemed remarkably calm. Counselors, man.
Sam cleared his throat. “I’m sure Odie appreciates knowing you didn’t just run off and leave her,” he squeezed his hand reflexively on her shoulder, “but you didn’t come here for a family reunion, did you?” he asked. Odie tensed.
“Bullshit!” exploded Bobby, ghost spittle flying through Dean’s face, cold, instead of flecking his skin. “That’s some weak-ass tea and you know it. Saving the world don’t matter a lick if there’s nothing in this world worth living for. I’m here to save you from my fate, Dean. Take a chance while you’ve still got it. Live a little now to build something worth spending an eternity in.” Bobby’s face was pleading, up close, chilling him both physically and mentally, and Dean couldn’t take it.
He grabbed Cas by the lapels of his dirty trench coat, shaking him. “You moron! You goddamned idiot! So the son of Lucifer tells you it’s all cool and you just believe him?! Really, Cas?” Dean shoved and the shifter flew across the room. That was enough to startle Dean out of the illusion. Cas wouldn’t break so easily.
His relaxation was abruptly cut short by a noise startling Dean out of his reverie. A deep groan emitted from the table next to his, and Dean raised his head, alarmed. Castiel lay on the table directly to Dean’s right, and Dean could see Cas’ back, uncovered to the gentle rise below his lower back, gleaming slightly in the low light with the oil Kelsi was using to work her thumbs into the pads of muscle just above Cas’ ass. “Mmmmmm, that feels AMAZING, Kelsi!” Cas rumbled into his face pillow. Dean felt all the blood in his body competing for first place in the race to his dick. He had maybe, once or twice, fantasized about what Castiel might sound like in the throes of pleasure. Here was his sneak peek and it…did not disappoint.
Cas’ mouth turned up at the corner in response to Dean’s snarky response. In clear response to the challenge, the angel wasted no time in looping the blue polyester length between Dean’s teeth and tying it firmly behind his head. After checking the bind to ensure it wasn’t too tight in the back, Cas circled to Dean’s front and urged him to stand, helping him to his feet. “I’ll be right back” he promised. Dean heard footsteps and in moments Cas returned with a large, framed, oval mirror Dean recognized from above the bathroom sink.
Dean gave every appearance of wanting to comment but restraining himself. Instead, he walked over the pool’s edge so he could reach across and knock his glass into Cas’ in a toast. “Here’s lookin’ at you, kid.” Dean said, before taking a swig of his own drink, a version of a whiskey sour with rum.
Dean bypassed the local bar, but made a purchase at the liquor store (not imbibing yet). He rambled west for another two-and-a-half hours on state highways, avoiding I-70 and its Christmas eve traffic. When he finally pulled into Colby, Kansas (last chance at civilization before the Colorado border) the only three chain motels in town flashed ‘No Vacancy’ signs.
Gabriel just reclines and stares, silence stretching. Then: “Okay, I’m confused. What’s going on here? A lovers’ quarrel?” His brown eyes dart between Dean and Cas.
Coming in next day or so-the part that's been kicking my ass: who knows what about the mystery and how we move our boys into the final act. There are still mysteries to solve and character arcs to complete (or move forward). So please keep reading!
Dean opened his mouth to protest, but nothing came out. Dress shoes and slacks were stepping down the stairs behind the white bannister. A tan trench coat fluttered over a crisp white shirt. That nerdy blue tie. A hint of dark stubble. Dean’s heart clenched, cold, in his chest.
Dean shrugged, flipping the burgers (but never, ever, pressing down with the spatula, because he wasn’t a monster). “Dunno,” he replied. “He says he likes the water pressure.”
Cas sits, back against the wall, yellow comforter over drawn-up knees, staring at the door with intensity for many minutes. Finally, he rises quickly and storms towards the door.
If he made an overture, how might Cas respond? Confusion, pity, rejection, and passive acceptance all seemed equally probable to Dean. Enthusiastic reciprocation did not.
Odie was uncorked now, the words flowing out. “Timea barely kept her heart in her chest, but we saved her. Her parents had already been turned and we had to take them out.”
Billie halted so suddenly Dean found himself running into her black leather duster. She turned enough for him to see the whites of her eyes. She jerked her head once, urging him on.“Fine,” Dean muttered. “Let’s get this show on the fucking road” he said, and followed her without further question.
Cas looked surprised at the mention of Dean’s hunting schedule. Dean ignored that and zeroed in on Sam with cold eyes. “Love, huh? ‘Love will save the day. Love will find a way. Love heals all wounds.’ Yay, love!” snarked Dean, dripping sarcasm.
Cas turned wide, steely blue eyes to Dean “You have significant trust issues, Dean,” he said in a completely un-self-aware too-loud voice.
Cas flinched. Dean could tell Cas hadn’t realized he was being hurtful. Dean softened and indicated the rest of the group. “Go on, doc, sorry about the outburst.”
“When your mama’s patients began falling ill, she called upon Ixchel to find out what was causing the sickness. By this time she had caught HIV from delivering the babies of women who carried the virus, but didn’t know it yet.” Sam put a gentle hand on Odie’s shoulder. Jay continued.
By adjusting his stance, Dean was able to regain control enough to enjoy the variable suction and stroking rhythm Cas was providing, complete with completely pornographic moans of pleasure. Dean grit his teeth. “Please, Cas, please, let me see it, let me look at you” He couldn’t care he was begging. He needed. God, he needed.
Dean just nodded. Once the door was closed behind him, he whirled on Mia. “So, how’re things since we ganked Buddy?”
Sam waited, but nothing else came out of Dean’s mouth. Cas still held Dean by the elbow, and the angel was staring at his brother, eyes shining with pride. Sam felt his teeth rotting.
“That sounds nice, Brian, thank you for the recommendation,” Cas managed to interject, politely, between his groans. Dean heard Kelsi tell Cas to turn over and move down on the massage table while she held the blanket to shield his privacy, so Dean knew what was coming when Brian asked him to do the same. The only problem was Little Dean. He knew if he flipped over at this time, he would be pitching a tent too obvious and embarrassing for the poor professionals just trying to do their jobs. Dean heard himself tell Brian, “You know, my back still hurts. Could you work a little longer there?”
Odie pulled on a graphic tee and gave him a knowing look. “It’s the same here, but you need clothes that won’t get in the way. Loose, sweat-wicking so you don’t dehydrate. Light colors to reflect heat. Flip flops can be lost in a hurry. Sport sandals are better for the jungle.” She jerked her head toward the beach. “Good luck running something down in the sand in those huge clodhoppers.”
The second half of what happened at partner yoga. These two dorks. Do you think they'll ever figure out?!
He and Cas, in sync as any dance partners, gracefully extinguishing a rugaru. The tang and buzz of sweat and adrenaline. Cas’ eyes sparkling in the dancing flames of the rugaru’s immolated corpse. Dean grinning, clapping Cas on the back, inviting him for a celebratory drink. Thighs bumping together below the bar as they downed shots. Eyes locking, lingering. Speech dwindling. Dean slapping money on the bar. Walking back to the motel room. Cas’ hand grazing Dean’s low back. Cas’ breath hot on the back of his neck. Dean fumbling, drunk, with the key, opening the door. Turning to push it shut, reaching past Cas’ shoulder. Cas standing there, in his space, (or was Dean in Cas’ space?) quiet and still, staring. Always staring.
“How fucking dare you?” Dean exploded. He was shouting now, drops of spittle escaping his lips. “Be you.” he shouted. “Don’t be him. You cut it out right now, you hear me?” He crowded into the shifter’s space, bristling as big and as threatening as he could get.
“I just…” Dean struggled to find the words. I barely remember this, but at least I had it once. Sam never had it all, even though I tried my best. Now it’s Jack’s first Christmas, and…” he shrugged, stuffing his hand in his pockets. “I just wish I had maybe stuck around; shown him a good one. Like this.”
“I’ve come to understand” begins Cas, “that when humans are particularly reticent about a topic, it can indicate their reluctance to discuss a matter. Why do you and Dean seem so reluctant to discuss his tattoo?”
Dean was as good as his word, and more. To Castiel, who did not get his heart broken, he was a partner, friend, and lover. Dean didn’t change overnight; he was still taciturn, he still turned to anger too readily and used humor as a shield. But he no longer walked in weakness and fear. He loved his brother and his surrogate son, Jack, bravely and as fully as he knew how.
Charlie’s look was pure pity. “Did you really just quote ‘Free Bird?’ What’s next? You going to tell me how when it’s time for leaving you hope I’ll understand that you were born a ramblin’ man?” She stage-whispered, “Do you ever think learning about love and relationships exclusively from your grief-addled father and classic rock lyrics might not have given you the healthiest outlook?”
“I can tell. You feel like soldiers and firefighters I’ve worked on in the past,” replied Brian. “Strong but not as flexible or balanced as my athletes. You should take the partner yoga massage class with Cas, have him help you stretch it out.” Dean rolled his eyes with the privacy of the face pillow.
Dean so rarely had anyone touch him. He’d never admit it, but that was one thing he never got enough of-growing up-or now, for that matter. He got the shit beat out of him on the regular, at first by his dad, and then by monsters and assholes. That served as a nice counterpoint to the sex he regularly sought ought in his younger, more reckless years; anonymous encounters with women (and yeah, sometimes men) who would fill his need for physical intensity and pleasure without the demands of intimacy. Now, the only regular tactile human contact he had was gruff, brotherly hugs with Sam, and the too-few, too-short, too-little shoulder grasps from Cas.
Dean ferried his bag to the dresser where he swept the toiletries sitting on top into it. A lone, travel-sized deodorant missed and skittered away under the bed. Dean chased it under the bed and nearly hit his head on the metal frame when Cas’ voice cut in.
Cas took this as his cue, and pushed his chair back. He cleared his throat, looking at Jack, who dropped his craft project. “I’d like to propose a toast,” began Cas formally. Dean couldn’t help smiling.
Dean drew back sharply, shaking his head. “No.” The outward rage twisted inward instantly, like the cold steel of a knife sliding into his gut. “No, I’m not. Cas. I’m sorry.”
“Oh shit!” Dean exclaimed. Between the post-flight Xanax haze and his earlier text flurry with Sam, he failed to note a really important aspect of the whole romantic cabana setup.
Sam padded along the single-lane dirt road behind Odie. Her strides were significantly shorter than his, so he consciously slowed his pace. Waves of turmoil rolled off her. Her shoulders were high and squared. Sam stuffed his hands deep in his jacket pockets and gazed up at the night sky, resplendent with stars this far from concentrations of electric lights.
Understanding passed between them, without any discomfort. It seemed to Dean that they shared a frank recognition, of their history, both individually and shared, and of their natures, complex and immutable. When he looked at Cas like this-without words or expectations, it seemed they were so easily able to reach a mutual understanding.
When he was able to make out his surroundings, blinking madly, he was back in the motel from hell. An irresistible drowsiness pulled him towards the bed. He flopped on it, fully clothed, and sleep claimed him.
Dr. Lea lowered her glasses and looked over them at him. “Actually,” she said, “that’s a good place for us to begin. Dean, if trust is an issue in your relationship, how does that manifest with Cas?”
Sam began to protest, then remembered his dad basically did the same, out of a sick sense of protection. “It happened enough, back then,” said Odie, sensing his skepticism.
The hammock rocked in the ocean breeze, shaded by the palms rustling above. Eyes closed, Sam pushed thoughts of a missing Odie out of his mind. Thoughts about his pep talk to Cas crowded in on their heels. His stomach rumbled loudly, reminding him audibly of the late mid-day hour.
Bobby rolled his eyes. “Down, boy. I just came back here to give you a friendly warning. It’s about Heaven. You’ve been, remember?”
Dean had just set the last patty on the plate in front of him when he felt strong arms encircle his waist from behind. He sagged into them, letting his eyes drift closed. Cas pressed a kiss to the back of Dean’s neck. Cas’ deep voice rumbled, “this is definitely the nicest abandoned house we’ve squatted in.” Dean felt, rather than saw, Cas’ mouth curve into a smile against his neck.
, thought Sam. Was it him, or did Cas’ eyes burn a little more intensely blue than usual? Sometimes he forgot. Angel of the lord, and all that jazz. Cas could be downright scary when he felt like it. Sam had already decided further teasing wouldn’t be the wisest course of action when Cas’ face became suddenly vulnerable. “Sam. “Cas pleaded. “Did you know?”
Of course, Cas didn’t sleep, so he was sitting awkwardly in a chair by the bed. He had cued up some streaming classical music on his phone, Dean noticed, and the lights in the room were off except the bedtime lamp. Cas was nothing if not helpful.
Cas closed his eyes, letting the water fill his ears, muffling the already subdued sounds of the resort complex. Most couples had retreated to their cabanas for rest or physical congress, but some joined Cas at the luxurious infinity pool.
Cas tilted his head, puzzled. “It’s not a competition, Dean. I like burgers, too, if you’ll recall. I just hate to see you not enjoy nice things because you feel like they don’t fit your self-image.”
This time, Dean’s impure thoughts were interrupted by the distinct rumble of Odie’s Land Cruiser, all diesel engine and crunching overgrowth in the red dirt road on its way toward their little oasis of calm.
The girl just smiled. “Don’t worry. Most of the hicks out here don’t even think twice about assuming. And we do the whole tree-and-presents thing.” She gave him an appraising glance before ducking her head back to her phone. “You, too. You know, if you celebrate.” She didn’t look back up at him, but Dean grinned broadly, pushing open the glass door, bell tinkling as he headed into the icy blast of December morning air.
“I don’t mind going if there’s food,” admitted beady eyes, who had a narrow jaw and a prominent blonde brow, “but I think their pet angel and its freak kid’ll be there.” Another laugh met this proclamation.
Sam looked surprised, then amused. He picked up his own beer bottle and waited for Cas to continue. Cas looked at Jack and raised an eyebrow, waiting. A few seconds ticked by before Jack picked up his own beer bottle, looking sideways at Sam to copy him. Dean was grinning now. That was just fucking adorable. Not like when Jack was trying to learn by imitating Dean. His grin slipped a little at the memory of how hard he had pushed Jack away at first.
And so Dean was screwed because of course he was gonna go. Whatever bickering song-and-dance went on from there on out, it ended up with him here on the couch, babysitting the son of Satan while his brother got his kumbayayas out with a shifter therapist. Dean drummed his fingers on the couch cushion with the arm stretched out behind Jack, who startled, then relaxed. He seemed to be getting more comfortable with Dean since the hunt. Sam had been right about that one, at least for now.
Dean stretched them at his sides experimentally. “Tired, but okay.” he replied. Cas hummed thoughtfully. “I want to restrain you, but if you feel any discomfort at all, you must tell me.” This last he delivered with the certitude of heaven.
Dozens of hunters had invaded their bunker. Boxes were strewn about with writing in marker on them, writing which Dean recognized as Sam’s. Weapons covered the table, each with a tag attached. A pile of clothes sat in one corner, plaid shirts, jeans, and shoes all laid out in neat rows on a blanket. A large poster advertised Men of Letters artifacts and magical items, with photos and list prices, while the actual items remained locked safely away.
“Dean.” The soft growl insistent. “Look at me.” Dean’s eyes rose, unbidden, to regard the familiar features of Cas’ face; firm jaw, tousled hair, icy blue eyes. His heart burst open.
“No? You’re relatively young,” Gabriel looks at Cas, then amends, “well, at least your vessels are,” He shrugs. “attractive. You’ve got chemistry, history, plus the real shit, shared trauma.” Dean and Cas examine the floor. Gabriel pins Dean with narrow eyes. “Trust issues, am I right? Something to do with your dad.”
Dean whirled on him, jaw clenched. “Things change. People change.” Dean shrugged, trying to think of an excuse. Anything but the real reason. “We’re not exactly religious, and that normal apple-pie stuff just isn’t for us. We’ve got work to do, remember?” He turned away to continue rummaging for any alcohol, anything hard at all, to obliterate his memories of Cas and the hunt gone sideways and now this goddamn argument with his brother who just wouldn’t leave well enough alone.
Sam tore into the packaging. He stopped, abruptly, raising his eyes to stare at Dean, who returned it innocently. Then Sam broke into laughter. He shook his head. “Are you,” he began, wheezing for breath in between peals, “making fun of me, dude?”
Sam stayed silent, giving her the space to continue. He tried his best to make his body less big, less overwhelming, less threatening. For the millionth time, he wished he wasn’t such a moose.
Dean squirmed with embarrassed want. “Yeah, that’s-” Cas’ fingers spread him open and Cas’ tongue was there, delicately tracing around his entrance “okay!” Dean screamed out. Cas’ tongue swiped broad swaths, vibrated in his hot center, and circled swirling patterns over the nerve-laden area. Oaths and praise tumbled alternately from Dean’s mouth. His dick lay forgotten, weeping against his stomach.
Dean’s spidey senses were tingling. Odie had shared what was either some serious nonverbal communication or a silent prayer with Cas, and they strategically disappeared to the treehouse’s kitchenette. Sam was uncharacteristically quiet, and he wore that pensive look that always bode ill for them.
“I’m a public health nurse at the local health clinic.” Timea replied, already shaking her shoulders in time to the music. She and Odie fell into a cluster, Odie’s darker head almost a full foot shorter than Timea’s.
He wouldn’t be coaxed into flying until Cas pointed out Mr. T’s character, B.A., shared his fear of flying and often had to be drugged to fly on The A-Team. The Metatron pop culture dump had its high points, Dean had to admit. Cas argued Dean would make a more effective fighter once they arrived if he was rested, so Dean had finally consented to take the small dose of Xanax. As if he could refuse Cas, ever. He popped the small pink pill, resisting making a Matrix joke, washing it down with a beer against Sam’s objections. Dean figured his liver had handled worse.
Dean tried not to enjoy it but it was hard, grasping Charlie’s warm green robes, watching the countryside float past in the darkness below. He had always hated airplanes but this felt almost nice. Secure. Maybe it was just Charlie. He adjusted his grip on her waist.
Sam raked his hair back from his face, stopping his route in front of Jack. “I’ll drink to Dean for your sake and for Jack’s” said Sam, indicating them both with his beer bottle, “but not for his. A very Merry Christmas, big bro, wherever you slunk off to.”
He gripped his duffel on his lap and crossed his long legs at the ankle. He sat in an ancient office chair, upholstered in mustard yellow fabric. It was one of three, sad, mismatched chairs pushed along one wall of the anemically-air-conditioned trailer that served as the “airport” in Dangriga.
“So, these couples all checked into the resort, and then disappeared on the last day of the couples’ retreat.” Sam summarized. Odie nodded, indicating the proto-murderboard she had rigged up, complete with photos of the couples, their names, and details of their cases underneath it.
Before he could make a cautious approach to bringing up Odie’s parents again, the thump of dance music disturbed the quiet. Little over a half mile down the road, and she was jerking her chin at him to follow her into an open-air bar with a thatched roof. She made a beeline for the bar and begin chatting with the bald man behind the bar, procuring two Belikens in bottles.
She turned to gaze at each of them levelly. “But,” she continued, “when feelings of mistrust are pervasive, they can adversely affect your life, resulting in anxiety, anger, or self-doubt. Trust issues often arise from childhood experiences. A person who did not receive adequate nurturing, affection, and acceptance, or who was abused, violated, or mistreated as a child will often find difficulty in establishing trust as an adult.”
Cas sighed “Seriously, Dean. Not butterflies and rainbows happy. Just living, the way I always wanted, if we ever got the rest of it figured out. If I can’t have that, I want you to have that. For me?” Cas placed his other hand on Dean’s face, and reverently pressed his lips to Dean’s.
She scoffed at him. “Ah, that’s me, what did you think?” When Sam just regarded her stupidly for a minute she laughed. “It’s short for Melodie. Is this going to be a problem?” She raised an eyebrow at him in challenge.
Cas stood in the water. “I’ll have another, as well,” he informed the bartender, indicating his empty glass at the bar. Dean visibly startled. He gave Cas a slow look starting at his face raking down, and Cas suddenly felt self-conscious. He was dripping wet, droplets falling down his face from his slicked-back hair. Cas could feel the beads of water rolling down his chest between his pectoral muscles. Dean’s gaze seemed stuck on Cas’ submerged lower half. Cas didn’t know what Dean was so captivated by. He was just wearing nondescript, mid-length black swim trunks, and the view of his body would surely be wavy and distorted from the water.
