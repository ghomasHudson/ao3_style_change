He raised an eyebrow as he read it and said that he would happy to do anything he could for me; his wife used Windward Spices. He called in a clerk and provided me a signed copy of my registration card and advised me to stay off the streets at night, and we shook hands. He was very businesslike, and I will say incredibly kind and polite, considering everything he had on his plate.
I gave my word I that would keep both close, tucked them into my breast pocket. Leaving there, I had the taxi drive me to an address on the Corniche. The brass door plaque merely read
When the secretary returned, he said Mr. Ellerman would see me and escorted me to the end of a long hall and a comfortably appointed office.
I made to rise, but Ugarte took hold of my hand. “No! I’m sorry! I did not mean… Please, listen,” he begged.
It’s remarkable that if women truly are the weaker sex, how was it they have such a practical capacity to make-do and endure that far outstrips a man’s? If I had lost close to two stone since the war began, it wasn’t Mrs. Hudson’s fault. She was a farmer’s daughter, born and bred and if Holmes and I weren’t reduced entirely to skin and bones, it was because of the chickens she kept cooped in the back and the produce from her garden.
The banner informed me that the German Army was pushing closer to the gates of Moscow. Below it, I learned the Japanese had sent assurances to Cordell Hull that troop movements in French Indo-China were merely precautionary, that Senator Greenberg was reiterating his request for a deferment of the draft, and six Senate Republicans were calling FDR changing the date of Thanksgiving a ‘high-handed insult to the memory of Lincoln’.
One of them started to crawl up on the stage. He was too drunk to stand and, falling forward, managed to get hold of the hem of her skirt. He pulled, whether to try to get up on his knees, or pull her to him, I couldn’t tell. I was close but too far to pull him off the stage. I expected a riot and it’s likely there would have been one except that Delilah—Delilah took two steps and kicked him so hard that he flew backwards and landed on the table.
There were two men with the taxi, the driver in the front seat and a tall, rather elegant, man who was standing by the open boot. There were no words exchanged, as we came up. He simply removed a case from the boot and backed away to let Mrs. ‘Arris’s nephew stow our things.
With the town empty, it seemed London’s criminal element decided to lie back, as well. Until that point it had been busy summer for my friend; the newspapers were still trumpeting the return of the Duchess of Grantham’s emeralds when the knocker fell still.
I pushed in amongst them to make certain that he wasn’t seriously hurt. “Doctor,” I said, “I’m a doctor!” and, looking me, straight in eye, he said,
They insisted on making coarse jokes while Delilah found a chair for me and dodging Ugarte, who screamed at them in what I learned later was Hungarian, while he struck them on their heads, arms and shoulders with his rolled-up panama hat.
The lucky few who obtained both a visa and a travel permit roamed the port, looking for passage on any ship that was willing to take them. They would pay any amount to sleep on the deck or in a life boat, any chance to get to a port where they could find transportation to America.
I had been certain he was going to try and play me for a fool, but when a few days had gone by and there was no sign of the threatened message, I relaxed. Ferrari said nothing, but it wouldn’t have bothered me if he’d been picked up by the Sûreté.
“I’m sure I don’t know what you’re talking about,” she said, primly. “Your bath’s run. Best jump in while it’s hot.”
Without another word, I was arse-up on all fours with my drawers at half-mast, to cushion my knees, and he was lubricating me with the oil from the dish. He opened me wide, working me with his fingers, until I begged him to stop being such a horse’s arse.
Since, if he were stopped and searched, he hadn’t wanted to be found with two sets of papers on him, and so girl carried his German papers. They came to a checkpoint, and she was passed straight through. Behind her, Henri Dubert was held and then shipped to Fort St. Jean, the main Foreign Legion depot in Marseilles. There he tried contacting a man named Varian Fry who ran an emergency rescue service for Jewish artists and writers; he was told that he didn’t qualify for assistance.
“Thank you.” I toasted him and took a deep gulp, letting it dissolve my stress. “That helps. I confess.” I sighed. “This is the last thing I expected. I don’t know what to say. Are you one of Mrs. ‘Arris’s nephews?”
bars in Cairo, right down to the green glass beaded curtains, the plum coloured walls, the flypaper, the flies, and the huge bawah at the door.
Anyone who didn’t know Holmes would have assumed he was falling asleep, and the exposure was an accident. I, knowing Holmes, sighed, and said, “It’s very hot, today. Is
One woke at the backfire of a car, already reaching for the siren-suit, and I will not describe the stress associated with fire duty, bomb disposal, clearing rubble…identifying the dead was the worst.
She began to move faster as the rhythm sped. Her shoulders slid from side to side, while she flexed her abdomen and rolled her hips, until she was describing an infinity of loops—up, down, sideways—faster and faster. She went on and on until, with the cymbals crashing and the drums providing distant thunder, her belly, hips and shoulders were moving so quickly that the air seemed to vibrate. Spectacular control! She had me breathless, as she had all the men in that room, and then bang! With a crash and sudden silence, the dance was over, and she was taking her bows.
As I typed the last sentence, a siren went off in the distance. I glanced over at Holmes, who was lounging on the sofa with his morning coffee and the daily papers about him. With a perfect communion of spirit, he looked at me, at the same moment, and I had no doubt that he, too, was recalling the winter of ’41. I have no doubt that most of my readers, too, recall the sirens, the anti-aircraft guns, and the searchlights cutting through the smoke as the bombs fell, for seventy-six days and nights, without letup.
Fortunately, he had befriended the four Brits by then and, learning they intended to escape to North Africa, convinced them they needed to take him along as their interpreter, he did speak Arabic, after all. With his help they obtained Foreign Legion uniforms and forged papers that identified them as Yugoslavs to be discharged in Casablanca.
as I entered and Carl, The Maître d’ greeted me by name, as if I were an old customer. He asked if I wanted a private table. I said Yes, I expected to be dining with a business associate later but would be having a drink first. I asked him if Captain Renault been in that evening.
After dinner, I took my last glass outside on the balcony. It had grown bitterly cold and there was wind off the ocean, but I would have endured far worse just for the simple pleasure of gazing on a city with its lights all ablaze. Holmes came out and stood with me in the shadows with his arm around my waist. I recall the smell of his pipe tobacco and Bay Rum.
“What problem was that…? Oh. Oh yes,” I said. “You said something about a sponsor for Jakov. I did have some thoughts—someone in mind—I’d like to talk to you about. Is it possible for you to meet me at Rick’s tonight, say ten o’clock, for dinner?”
“Yes?” Hearing a German accent, I stiffened. The tall man was approaching, but I noticed Mrs. ‘Arris’s nephew was not showing any particular concern.
The sun was setting as the Sunderland taxied up to the Tagus River docks, and we deplaned into the arms of another of Mrs. ‘Arris’s nephews, who hustled us into a waiting taxi.
“Good man! I knew we could count on you,” said Holmes, as Mrs’ ‘Arris’s nephew leapt up from his chair.
I lay under a slowly turning fan that night and reviewed the things I needed to accomplish in the coming weeks. I had a list of spice brokers to contact, I intended to become thoroughly acquainted with the city and its people…and rest. Laying there, I realized how tired I was; I wished that Holmes was there with me.
As I reached to take his hand, the door behind me flew open and struck my shoulder where I had my old wound. That sent me plunging into Jakov’s bosom and caused great amusement as four young men—there was no doubt in my mind who they were—piled into the dressing room.
“You can’t care what the Ministry of Food says, there’s no making a decent cup without a spoonful for the pot.”
He praised the Transatlantique’s own beautifully tiled dining room, of course, and said the commander of the Sûreté dined frequently. I slid a folded bill across the counter, along with a hint that I would hoping to enjoy some local entertainment.
Other items included a book on the agriculture of the Maghreb, and a well-worn wallet, containing a Maryland driver’s license, photographs—yes, of my Mary—and a membership card for the Rotary.
The third night, we were permitted an evening to ourselves, and Holmes invited me have supper with him in his room. It appeared to be just the two of us, but years ago we had developed a method of communicating by hand gestures that owed much to the system used by the deaf; by that means, he let me know that the room was bugged. Even if it had been the Germans, it wouldn’t have mattered; I was delighted to have him to myself for even an hour, and discretion is ever the better part. We spoke aloud of London, and of our friends, and had an excellent meal that included a robust red with the main course.
Renault picked up the certificates again and rifled through them. One ‘seemed’ to catch his eye; at least, he raised a brow. He said, “Does your wife know what goes on in places like the Blue Parrot?”
A blue passport in the packet bore the seal of the United States. An embossed stamp obscured the details of the photograph on the first page. It was my face, although, it looked as if I had been surprised by the photographer. I could not recall ever having such a picture taken. On the page opposite the photo was a message in script, stating,
Under Blue Peter’s beady and malevolent eye, Ferrari and I attempted to settle down to some serious play. We threw the dice and moved the counters, while the bird circled his perch and every so often extended his snake-like neck to make a snatch at a counter. Every time he did, Ferrari pushed his beak away, and I cringed inside. That bird could have cracked a thumb joint as easily as a nut with his beak.
“Oh, yes. I was working at a forward aid station. When they sent the mule up with the rations, it was all papers of sugar mixed up with the tea. Some of us only wanted the sugar; some wanted wanted tea. You couldn’t separate it; everyone hated it. Some clever dick in a Ministry thought that one up.”
Twice in that time, I sent contracts to the Windward Spice Company via the Consulate’s teletype—God knows what they made of them—toward the end of the second week, I was starting to become anxious about Holmes. I had known it might be some time before he turned up, but there was a nagging discomfort in the back of my mind.
“What a dull, unambitious fellow the London criminal is!” he said. “I can think of any number of empty houses I could have burgled by now.”
“I have papers for him, too, but his issues are not as likely to get him shot. I need you to do me a favour.”
I couldn’t argue with him. It had been low tide with me from lack of sleep and the strain to my nerves. The damage to my lungs from gas in the last war wasn’t helping and, I had to admit, there was much that appealed in the thought of sunshine, flowers, and the deep blue sea—this scepter’d isle can be damned cold and foggy place in November.
“I wasn’t planning to bring up the subject of our over-hasty departure from Baker Street but, since you have, what is the mission?”
Arriving at our table with drink in hand, he almost spilled it when Blue Peter lunged at him. “Does this creature need to be here?”
This did not bode well for the day. To distract him, I said, “Why don’t you come to the swimming baths with me? We could get some hokey-pokey after.”
“I’m so sorry.” He apologized. “I did not mean to presume. But you look a little bit lost; I thought I could help.”
He was a very small man; I could have shaken him off easily; I could have called for help from Ferrari, the outline of whose bulk I could see the other side of a beaded curtain. Yet, I could tell that Ugarte was moved by some more than ordinarily powerful emotion. Curious, I sank back into my seat.
The next morning, I stopped in at the American Consulate. The hotel would see that I was registered with the French authorities, but this was Armistead’s first trip to Morocco. There were barely a hundred American citizens in the country and I was going to invite attention. No matter how unlikely it was that I would meet anyone who could, or could not, say that I was a spice buyer from Baltimore, it would be best if I established the right to my identity.
“I know I can keep him busy until midnight. After that, we’ll see. Do you want me to have a word with your lads?”
He said that he would have room service bring a powder to my room. I asked for a bit of fruit and a tartine as well. Of course, he said, and
“Yes, of course. How did—oh, I see—must be obvious—me—here I am—standing right in front of the place. Is there a crowd like this here all the time?”
I must have been fallen briefly asleep and, when the porter knocked, I startled and almost flung myself on the floor. Fortunately, even in that state of confusion I recognized who’s voice it was.
And, suddenly, I was having a vividly visceral impression of the mud of the Salient as it had been in November of ’17. Stinking of decaying bodies, it clung to my boots, encased my body in its clayey grip, and sucked me down. It felt as if I were suffocating. The attack lasted thirty seconds, a minute at the most; I should have timed it.
In my long association with Sherlock Holmes, I have stood at his side, watching him confront rogues, villains, and monsters in human form, and have never seen him lose his self-possession. There have, in fact, been times when the stakes were high, and danger imminent, when he seemed to derive pleasure from the experience. I asked him about it once and he admitted it was true at those times when, from the knock on the door to the moment the cuffs were clapped on some rogue’s writs, and every step in the case had been the direct result of unassailable logic. At those times, to him, the universe seemed like a great machine of which he was an integral part.
Skirting the medina, I saw a street vendor selling oranges and salted almonds, I couldn’t help stopping to dicker with him. My smattering of Arabic was rusty, but I soon had a small sack of almonds and two oranges. They were as bright as new pennies to my war-weary eyes. There was a public park nearby and it was where I consumed my treats, listening to the gentle babbling of a fountain.
“Assume I am who I appear to be, Captain. You are not at all good at blackmail. I know. I have stood by and watched men shot dead who were good at it.”
I cannot say enough about Harold Goold; history will call him a saint. He listened to my story and only asked me if I were certain about the identities of all five men. I said that I was quite prepared to swear for the four British soldiers—two of them undoubtedly had been born in the East End—but I could not speak for Jakov Kordt. I could only observe that he seemed to have been a good friend to them, so far.
“I’d be the last person to think such a thing. I’ll do what I can for you. You understand what he means to do when he gets to London?”
The table legs collapsed, knocking over the chairs and spilling drinks. Delilah shook her bells, over him, and captured our attention. She whirled around twice, skipped off the stage, and just before she vanished through the beaded curtain, turned and blew a kiss from the tips of her fingers.
The next three days, he and I spoke of nothing but saffron, cork trees and the city of Baltimore where I had done post-graduate work at the Johns Hopkins Medical School, before the last war. And I refreshed myself on the distinctive version of American spoken there.
I can’t tell you how much I was looking forward to a bit of fresh ham when the star of our pig club got the old chippy-chop. She had organized everything, I cannot say too much of the miracles she wrought with our ration books. Who was it who queued up for hours for an ounce of tea?
I chose to walk. It was a short stroll but, even at that time of night, there was the certainty of being pestered by beggars. It was a bit like running a gauntlet. I was able to ignore most of them. One, though had found a place for his mat by the entrance to the café. He had not yet been chased away. I almost stepped on him.
On 15 November, at three in the morning, you would have found both of us sitting at the corner of her work table, drinking tea and rum and becoming quite righteous as to the state of things that couldn’t be helped.
Holmes was climbing into the vehicle, and I was about to follow, when suddenly the tall man exclaimed, “You are Doctor Vatson!”
From my reading, I knew that the nominal ruler of Morocco was the Sultan Sidi Mohammad, that his people were Arab and Berber tribesmen and that, in the past, due to its position at the Straits of Gibraltar, it had been a haven for pirates. Most recently that strategic location had made it the object of a three-way struggle between Portugal, Spain and France. Portugal lost out, and France now claimed a protectorate over the lion’s share, which included Casablanca.
The Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace and the blessings of Allah be upon him) said that wine is an infamy of Satan; I went inside and ordered whiskey.
Mr. Ellerman looked to be a man about forty-something, although he could have been older; his expression was severe, his face essentially unlined, and his hair, which he wore slicked back, was so pale a blond that it would have barely shown if there had been any silver in it at all. He was seated at a massive desk and had half-arisen as I entered.
These, and many other things, I learned over the next few days. That night, I enjoyed an excellent tagine of goat’s meat and a bottle of a local red wine. There was a casino in back and I was tempted. I put my inclinations aside, though, and watched people come and go. I noted there was good bit of the other sort business that goes on
After he’d read it, he said, “Transit visas for four British soldiers, will not be a problem, but an Emergency Certificate for a German national…? You may be asking me to send a potential spy to England.” He frowned. “What do you know about his man?”
I can’t say anything Ferrari told me improved my play—far from it—but I settled down and was bearing off when Ugarte arrived. He was in a considerable taking.
Delilah was the last dancer of the evening. She slipped through the beaded curtain and onto the stage with the lower part of her face hidden behind a black silk veil. The khol around her eyes made them shine like emeralds. Her hips were slim, almost boyish compared to some of the ‘women’ but they were smooth and the mound below her jeweled navel looked soft, although I knew it was muscle. One sees that effect on ancient Greek statues, but rarely in lifeher. She began by teasing her audience as undulated around the stage with both corners of her veil lifted behind her head, as if she were might raise it. The bells on her bracelets and ankle bangles chimed in time to the music.
As I walked along, I knew to avoid the eyes of veiled women, and importuning beggars sitting against the walls. I pitied them, though. Trachoma was rampant in the region, and most of them were blind.
I couldn’t say the same. Such was my shock as recognition set in—if it hadn’t been for the bragging scar on his left cheek, I wouldn’t have known the smiling stranger from the Tagus River docks—you may be sure I had no trouble enacting the quintessential
Even if they were able obtain a visa, too often there was no way out. Many of them were stateless, and there was an executive order that prohibited men of military age, from leaving the country. Germany would not permit them the possibility of joining their home forces. If their papers expired, they were picked up and jailed as ‘social problems.’
“And they’re doctors, bankers, diamond merchants, teachers…every profession you can imagine…from every country Germany has crushed under its boot. They thought they would safe when the French granted them asylum. Now the French are turning them over to the Germans.”
At this point, they all piped up again, demanding to know what I could do to help them home to Blighty.
It’s true that there are times when he’s a complete twat, and I wonder at myself for putting up with him. Yet, when a man’s heart recognizes his superior and master, he longs to join with him and submit to his will. It’s perfectly natural, especially when you discover he bought the tickets to Inverness two days ago.
Ugarte forestalled me, saying, “If not the sins of the flesh, Mr. Armistead, for what are you doing in the Blue Parrot?”
“Looking for you, Doctor,” she said. “Here, you go up and have a nice lie down, before you break me mum’s good china cup. He’ll either be back, or he won’t.”
It felt strange being cleanshaven for the first time in—well, since I could recall—and I wondered if it altered my appearance as much as longer hair did to Holmes’.
Whilst I was being schooled, Holmes was busy coordinating with more of Mrs. ‘Arris’s nephews, and with some gentlemen from Marseilles.
I was only reciting a fact. All the benefits pertaining to Mr. Ellerman’s whiskey had long since evaporated, and I felt chill and distant. I do not know what Renault saw reflected in my eyes, that caused him to blanch, but the acrid smell grew stronger.
I met the real George Armistead that first night, to my great pleasure. He was born in Warwickshire, and turned out to be a naturalized American, with a heart condition. None of those facts had prevented him from offering his services to the British Government, which chose to borrow his expertise for this occasion.
Afterwards, I needed a shower, but I needed to compose myself more. Here I was in Casablanca and, in spite of all the promises and all the packets of all the nephews of Mrs. ‘Arris, two people had recognized me on the same day. All right, it was true Ferrari had recognized me the moment I walked into the Blue Parrot, but I hadn’t known that, until today.
“I hope you know what you’re doing.” Again, Ferrari sighed, as he made the papers disappear. “Ugarte is a stone-cold killer!”
I noticed he caught the eye of the owner, Rick Blaine, who was sitting nearby, and waited for an almost imperceptible nod of the head before making the offer. As I said, Rick’s was well managed.
I could deal beggars, and with the people who bothered me on my rambles, but I sat down at a café for a cup of tea, I could count on being approached by someone who had a story of tragedy to tell me. I learned that Ugarte was correct. The refugees’ situation was dire and some of those people had been already been prisoners in Dachau. They fled to France and, when the war came to them, they had fled to North Africa, only to be trapped in Casablanca.
“It’s a useful profession,” Holmes said. “He’ll be able to travel anywhere in Morocco and have a reason to speak with anyone.”
Ugarte and I walked along in silence, each thinking our own thoughts, until Ugarte said, “What are you going to do?”
The commander of their jail, however, had been anti-Vichy and he taken their parole, possibly hoping they would take a hint and disappear in the confusion. One night in town, thoroughly drunk, they met Jakov Kordt and stuck up a friendship. It was through Kordt they had obtained forged papers that had let them travel to Casablanca, where they had been hoping for assistance at the British Consulate office.
Whilst I cannot obtain any particular pleasure from ratiocination, as Holmes does, when it comes to risking it all on a throw of the dice…I’m your man.
“Because, there is a faction in Vichy that would prefer France ally itself with Germany against the Communists, and most of them do not disagree with Herr Hitler about the Jews. Vichy has coordinated its Jew laws with Germany’s, and they are starting to bring the French colonies in line. Sidi Mohammad may do and say what he likes but he won’t be able to hold them off, or even protect his own Jews, forever. That, of course, needn’t concern you.”
“I’ll tell you about it later,” said Ugarte. “This is the American gentleman I was telling you about.”
“It’s not that bad; merely a little look about the place.” said he. “Come now, what’s the worst that can happen?”
“Allow me to make you a present of him, wrapped in a big Christmas bow but only if you take his damned entourage, too.”
“Thank you for asking,” Ugarte said. “Captain Renault is what you call a bug up his arse. What do you Americans call that?”
“Certainly. But, first, do you know where I could find those four lads you’re so anxious to be rid of?”
Somehow, the five of them had found the Blue Parrot and, one night, Jakov hopped on the stage and demonstrated the act he and his sisters used to perform as The Egyptian Triplets. Ferrari had given him a job. Ferrari had also referred the Englishmen to Ugarte who found work for them on his smuggling runs across the southern Sahara. For nearly a year, they had been playing least-in-sight, but time was running out.
It was late afternoon when I checked into the Hôtel Transatlantique. I was exhausted, but a long, deliciously hot shower in a beautifully tiled stall refreshed me, and I went out to take a walk and to begin to familiarize myself with the city.
Ugarte didn’t miss a beat. “Perhaps you forgot,” he said. “There are so many things to remember when you’re a stranger in a strange place; little things slip your mind; or so I imagine. It was very kind of you to do that, you know. Talk to a stranger, I mean, Mr. Armistead. You’re in the spice business, yes?”
“We get shot for espionage,” I said. I wasn’t having with that sort of foolishness. “I know how that goes—without one last pipe or a dram of Lagavulin.”
I had been correct in one thing about him: he was Algerian, on his mother’s side. She had been a dancing teacher; his father had been German, the manager of a theatre troupe that travelled all over Europe and the Middle East. The family was Jewish and in 1939, after his father had been beaten to death by Brownshirts, Jakov, his mother, and twin sisters, had emigrated to France. Mother and sisters had gone on to England, while Jakov remained in Paris to begin a career in journalism, and to write a novel.
Mrs. Hudson watched me indulgently. “Some man from that secret lot down at Number 64 came by yesterday at supper time.”
“They’ve made a mistake!” I called out, over the noise of the engines. “These papers belong to a buyer for the Windward Spice Company in Baltimore. Name of George Armistead.”
“Stop his gob, drop his drawers, hand him the kipper dish, and get down on his knees?” Holmes said. “Do it.”
“Mr. Armistead,” Renault said. “I have been hoping for the opportunity to meet you. What can I do for one of our rare American visitors?”
“Of course,” my unwanted friend, said, “Signor Armistead allow me to introduce our host, Signor Ferrari. Signor Armistead is an American.”
“Mr. Armistead, if you can obtain the exit visas, I might be able to have them on a fishing boat leaving for Lisbon tomorrow night.” Ellerman looked up. “Do you have access to a phone?” I nodded, thinking I might be able to use Ferrari’s line, although, I could always place a call from the hotel. “Call my secretary by 3 o’clock tomorrow, tell him your name, and that the manifest is prepared. If you miss that deadline, we will have to make other arrangements.”
Everything changed the night Ferrari mentioned he expected a crowd that night; some of his dancers were back after a month performing in Tangiers. There was one, he said, who was something out of the ordinary. Watching
I tried to skim the rest of the paper, but my eyes kept drifting to the advertisements for foods at prices not seen in England for years—comforting to know that somewhere bananas were 10¢ a pound—an ad for soap caught my eye:
“That’s an incredible story,” I said, looking at the Brits strained and sunburnt faces. They were all a little the worse for wear. I knew they wanted to get home, if not back to the war, and suspected a great deal of red wine had been left out of the tale. As for Kordt, I said, “That will you do in England?”
“Cause one of ‘em ‘at works there is Mrs. ‘Arris’s nephew, an’ ‘e won’t tell ‘er wot it is ‘e does.”
The swelling column of his sex raised its head from the red velvet egg sack where it had been resting, and my prick responded by pushing against the front of my briefs. I felt the muscles of my arse throbbing hungrily. My lips had gone dry. I licked them and said, “Does sahib want his
“You’d prefer my Hedy Lamar?” Holmes leaned toward me. I should have known he would have sensed that I was weakening, and he hit me with the clincher. “I need your help,” he said.
“My sentiments exactly,” Ferrari chucked the feathers under the bird’s hooked beak. As I left, I heard him cooing,
Before I could protest his generosity or, depending on how one looked at it, his high handedness, Ferrari had touched his heart and his head, and vanished like Alice’s caterpillar.
I tossed back my glass of whiskey—I hadn’t meant to do that either, but it turned out to be an Islay—got up and left.
“Finish me off!” I bellowed and cursed, but he knew the right moment to let me feel him nudging the entrance to my body, before he pushed home.
Ferrari grew quickly tired of my sighs and inept play and I failed to notice that he summoned the khol-eyed waiter, but my thanks were genuine when the glass of Egyptian tea appeared in front of me. I picked it up and permitted myself be beguiled for a moment by the sugar crystals dissolving in the amber liquid.
“It’s in the desk.” Ferrari pointed to an alcove with its beaded curtain was tied back, and there was a rolltop desk. “Come talk to me when you’re done.”
“I don’t know what that means. I am exactly what I appear to be. Perhaps, Mr. Armistead, it’s best if we say nothing, and proceed ‘as if’. Harold indicates that he would like me to assist you; that is good enough, so why don’t you tell me what I can do for you.”
“Location, location, location, as that consummate ass Lord Wimsey is prone to saying. If you fly due west from Casablanca and the first place you’d strike would be the outer banks of North Carolina.”
Holmes rose from the breakfast table and threw himself into his favorite armchair. There he lounged with his legs crossed in front of him, biting his knuckles, and scowling out the window.
As often as he’s denied it, I’m still not sure that Holmes can’t read my mind because, at that moment, he flexed and stretched luxuriously in his chair, like a cat. His legs relaxed and his dressing gown of Egyptian cotton, the only garment he found bearable in this heat, fell open. I could see the damp skin and the spot just below his navel where began a soft line of fur that pointed like an arrow, straight down.
I shed my gown, fetched the palm leaf fan from the mantel and stood over him, cooling him. He let me stand there until my arms ached, and then opened half-lidded eyes. He looked at me and flexed his torso from shoulders to hips. The sash of his gown came undone.
Rick’s Café Américain was clean, elegant and well managed. There was a strong Mediterranean feel to the place and the clientele, though primarily expatriates, was pleasantly polyglot. There is no place like it in the States, of course but, in many respects, it was entirely American: my waiter was Hungarian, the bartender was Russian, the Croupier was from Bulgaria, the piano player had been born in Louisiana, and the owner was from Queens.
“Nothing,” said he. “There is nothing anyone can do. One of them has no nationality anymore, and the other is Spanish; if she’s sent home, Franco will have her executed. Did you have a chance to consider the problem we discussed last night?”
Captain Renault was a small man. Not especially a handsome man, but he was attractive his way, and I would have found him a marvelous fountain of gallic charm, if I had not known what I knew of his proclivities. As it was, I was a little short with him.
My father used to say that the people of the Koran understood gardens. He was also a doctor, and made his career in the army, as I had intended to do before I was invalided out. My brother and I grew up on military posts, often in lands where Islam was the primary religion. Hong Kong, Madras, Kabul, Cairo—three continents—in many ways that evening in Casablanca felt more like home than London had since the war started.
“It’s only a drink,” he said. “You needn’t worry. Signor Ferrari is an honest man, in certain lights.”
Ferrari’s face became a study. It was obvious how he badly wanted to hit something, probably me, but, at last, he said, “I didn’t know you’d realized. How long…?”
I braced myself, walked up to one of the soldiers and told him that I was an American citizen there to see the Consul General. He went away and, when he returned, I was escorted straight into the Consul General’s office.
It was mid-afternoon, by the time I told the ever-patient taxi driver to take me back to the Transatlantique. We were almost there when I changed my mind; if there was anywhere in Casablanca where the phones were more likely to be bugged…
We were the Sunderland’s only passengers. Holmes occupied a seat across the aisle from me and was looking down at the water below. His hands were entwined and the forefingers steepled in the pose he habitually assumed when he was brooding over some especially thorny problem.
As I was leaving, I a squad of French police arrived. They began going up to the groups of people on the sidewalk, chivying them and making them show their papers. Several men near the front had time to run off, but one wasn’t quick enough. He was caught and made to show his papers, which proved to be expired. I saw him beaten and pushed into the back of a truck.
Listening to those broken people was distressing to a degree that’s impossible to describe. I was offered anything and everything, but I had no comfort for them, and was deeply regretting the promise I’d made to Ugarte.
With the wail of the first high-pitched siren, whoever was home—Mrs. Hudson, young Billy in the months before he was called up, or myself—would grab the emergency aid kit. We would douse the lights and decamp to the Anderson shelter in the garden, where we huddled in the damp for hours, brewing tea over a Primus stove, while London was laid ruin.
I turned and looked to the man on my right. He was flirting with a young French-Algerian woman, much to the barman’s evident disgust. I turned to the man on my left. His was the voice I’d overheard talking about tickets to Oran. He had the snub, squared off practical look of an engineer, and was more than a little the worse for wear. I bumped him, inadvertently.
I pointed to the framed map of the world, hanging on the wall behind him, and Renault swiveled around in his chair. In that projection both the United States and Red Russia were rendered huge. When he swiveled back around.
I concluded that being addicted to logic had to be healthier than being addicted to cocaine, even if the affect appeared to be the same. I have never experienced anything like it myself, though, and this occasion was no exception.
As I suspected, he was what was used to be called a remittance man—the younger son of an old English family, sent off to avoid a scandal, and expected to live on a monthly stipend. In Ferrari’s case I had no doubt what kind of scandal and there was no question of a stipend. He was certainly the receiving end of Ugarte’s smuggling operation—a thoroughgoing villain—yet he did not ask intrusive questions or beg for impossible favors.
I had almost determined to go back to the hotel and try another day, when a man who was passing by stopped and spoke to me.
Finally, Delilah called them a pack of beasts, and what did they think they were doing? They settled down then. I will give them that they apologized, when they found they had hurt me.
“I doubt it will come to that.” I removed the envelope with the papers from my pocket. “You’ll to keep this under the till in the cash register until the last minute. The fewer who know anything the better.”
When I woke, it was mid-morning, and Mrs. Hudson’s ‘man from 64’ was in the sitting room, and so was Sherlock Holmes. I hadn’t seen hide nor hair of my friend for weeks, but there was no time to greet him properly, or to observe that he needed a haircut. In fact, I hadn’t finished tying the sash of my gown, much less swallowed a mouthful of coffee, before Holmes was telling me to pack a bag; we were going on holiday to Morocco.
There was a great deal more we needed to talk about, but I could feel the plane beginning its decent and returned to my packet, intent on absorbing as many of details of George Armistead’s life as possible.
“I see you’re having whiskey. Would you like another?” Without waiting for an invitation, he took the seat across from me, and signaled the waiter.
“Just a rumor you understand. But I’ve heard there’s an engineer, a Frenchman—he too is married to an American woman, like yourself—who intends to build a pipeline for oil across the Sahara. The survey is done; the Germans like the idea; all that is needed is money. Can you imagine how many men it would take to build a pipeline across the Sahara? The cost of their food, and water…?”
Usually, if anyone is recognized for my literary efforts, it’s Holmes—as it should be—but it was gratifying to be recognized, nonetheless, and there was no reason I should have expected to see him again.
I had assumed Ugarte’s ‘friend’, if there was such a person would turn out to be a brazen little catamite, but when the wind is southerly, I can tell a hawk from a handsaw.
At least, I tried to work on my accounts. The rat-ta-tap-tap of Holmes’ fingers on the armrest of the chair made it impossible to concentrate.
Whenever I returned to my room, I never knew what I find there, or not, as the case may be. My Scotch tweeds replaced with light wools? My personal effects swapped for similar items with American labels? It was a very thorough turn around and took some getting used to. While not as bad as swotting the subtleties of Chinese porcelain in a day, it’s hardly surprising any thought of the stranger on the dock went clean out of my mind.
In the end, there was nothing he could do but report to the depot for basic training. Eight weeks later, with sore feet and a new respect for soldiers, his commander informed him that the Armistice commission had ordered the Legion demobilized. All foreign enlistees would be turned out.
“George Armistead here,” I said. “I’m calling about that crate for Windward Spices I discussed with Mr. Ellerman. The last one. I wanted to let him know the manifest is complete.”
I knew Ferrari. At least, I knew his type. As for the importunate little weasel in front of me, I blew out my breath and prepared to dispose of him.
“I should have realized. My apologies, I wondered why…” Ellerman began pulling forms out of his desk. “It’s a good book and I am very willing to sign my name to an Emergency Certificate, for Herr Kordt’s contribution to English letters. He will probably be arrested as soon as he arrives in England; I doubt he’ll care about that.” I could tell Ellerman was talking to me as much as to himself. “This war is a crime. There are so many writers, whose work I have missed. One, in particular, from whom I would love a new story.”
“That’s so much nicer. America must be a pleasant country. You know the police are all over the streets, arresting anyone they can get their hands on. They are wrecking my business.”
“No.” He put his hands behind his head and stretched out his legs. “If I must be stoic, so must you. It will teach you not to make frivolous bets.”
“Suddenly, they’re my lads?” Ferrari looked disgusted. “No. I’ll take care of that, when the time comes. As you said, the fewer know, the better.”
A look of almost comical annoyance appeared on Carl’s face as he divulged that the captain was, at that moment, in the casino. Did I, too, wish to gamble?
We, the men at the tables, surged to our feet applauding, except for the four closest to the stage—young and sunburnt—Europeans. All through Delilah’s dance, they had moaned in low tones, occasionally yipping like love-starved coyotes. Now they were tossing small coins on the stage, yelling at her to start dancing again. Calling for her to remove her veil and bells.
They been part of a group of sixty who were captured when the Germans separated the BEF from the French First Army near Armentières. The whole group had escaped and split up. These four had made their way south with the help of a succession of French farmers and had reached Marseilles in time to hear of the raid on Mers-el-Kébir. Needless to say, they were promptly detained.
“Again, my apologies. You seemed to need it. Captain Renault can have a most distressing effect a person. Since you walked out of his office, he’s thrown his men into the streets; already two dozen have been arrested. What did you do to set him off?”
Who were these desperate characters and what did they want? Clearly, they knew Delilah, and called him Jock, and so I deduced they were English soldiers. What they wanted to know, when everyone had been introduced, was could I help them get to out to Lisbon, Montreal, Brisbane, Wellington, Cape Town—it didn’t matter where, as long as it meant they could get back to their own forces.
Silence reigned. I could feel Holmes’ gaze on the back of my neck. At last, in a low voice, he said, “Watson, fetch the fan from the mantle.”
Mr. Harold Goold glanced at the photo and stamps in my passport and said that he had already received notice of my registration, but it was a pleasure to meet me. Was there anything he could do for me? It was obvious he hoped that there wasn’t. I said that I was merely making courtesy call, for which I apologized; I could see that he had a great many demands on his time, and that of his staff. Mr. Goold said that, yes, since the Armistice the American consulate had been handling visa applications and communications, for England, Canada, Australia, Portugal, and Spain, as well as several of the South American countries.
Suddenly, he was on his knees, thrusting his bowl at me, crying piteously. I dropped a 50-centime piece in the bowl. He felt it and cursed me as the ungenerous son of a poxy camel driver and crying out, did I not know the Prophet, peace be upon him, commends the giving of alms as a pillar of Islam?
Holmes appeared to consider the merit of my suggestion, but then said, “No. I am going to sit on this spot and let this too, too solid flesh melt and resolve itself into a puddle of ghee.”
There is usually amateur dancing after the show, but the musicians were taking refreshment while the mess was picked up and we were able to slip through the beaded curtains without attracting attention.
We shook hands. The German stranger—yes, in addition to his accent, I saw one of those bragging scars on his left cheek that used to be so fancied by students at the German universities—climbed into the Sunderland, which began to back away from the dock.
I will say that he recovered a good deal of his savoir faire while we waited for the papers to be processed. “I’m not a bad man, you know, Mr. Armistead. You’ve given me a lot to think about. For example, I think I wonder who you really are.”
I didn’t have to elaborate on what I thought; Holmes knew. It was no secret that I admired Mr. Roosevelt for not knuckling under to the isolationists in his government.
“There is an internment camp at Sidi-el-Ayachi, about fifty miles southwest of Casablanca. It’s where they put people who should not be free for reasons of public order. Suddenly, for some reason, a great number of people are cluttering up the city.”
Renault was not a monster. He was a nasty piece of work who used his position to prey on the weak and vulnerable—the lowest of the low—and I had done what needed to be done under the circumstances. But now the intuitive certainty that had supported me when I implied knowing for a fact that America that would soon be in the war, was gone. Doubt had snuck in and burst the bubble of hope. In short, I was disheartened. If I had been counting on the game to settle my nerves, they were too disordered, and the bird’s antics didn’t help.
“I need you to put all five of them in a taxi and have them delivered to Pier 7 on the Corniche before midnight tonight.”
I found a place to stand at the bar, wagged my fingers at the barman, and tuned into to the strands of conversation around me, while I waited for my drink.
“Mr. Armistead…? What an unexpected pleasure; how delightful to see you again.” The hesitation in his voice had been barely discernable.
“Do you like them girded with miles of barbed wire and land mines? Think of smooth golden sand, the Rift Mountains in the distance, fresh fruit, exotic Berber tribesmen and—”
By the time I reached the Transatlantique sunset was a faint gold line in the western sky, and I was all too aware of how much I had drunk on an empty stomach. Rolls and butter, with coffee for breakfast, were all that I’d eaten that day and there were hours before I was to meet Ugarte for dinner. A word with Mr. Aldani solved that problem, at least.
The young man—I presumed he was French-Algerian—was obviously looking for someone. His eyes—the color of Chartreuse liqueur—scanned the room. They stopped briefly when they came to me—how I obtained such a good look at their color—then, to my regret, passed on. Then the Of course, the Maître d’ arrived and told him he would have to leave; he wasn’t wearing a tie.
“No. If…no, when America enters the conflict, for whatever reason, its resources and tremendous industrial potential will turn the course of the entire war. Our mission is to get a feel for which way the French forces in North Africa will turn when that happened. Do the French generals stay loyal that German puppet government in Vichy, or will they throw in with the new ally of Great Britain?”
What did happen was that two hours later we were over the English Channel and on our way to Lisbon in a Short Sunderland Flying Boat.
While the British soldiers told their story, Kordt had been getting dressed. Now it was his turn, and his tale was much more complicated.
It was such unbelievable rudeness, especially considering the skill she displayed that, from the expressions I could see being cast their way, and the fact that they were Europeans, I expected things could get ugly quickly. I was not wrong.
Even in my brief time in Casablanca, I had learned that the Sûreté had its tracks and ran on them—it was understood; it was how things worked—and now that I had upset Renault’s applecart, I needed to see what else I could overturn.
“Find it soon!” Ferrari swept into the room then and rounded furiously on the soldiers. “Were you mantee boys deliberately trying to cause a riot? Why not go tell Captain Renault you want him to shut me down and ruin my business? Oh, you think it’s funny, do you! Out! Out! The lot of you! Get out of here! You! You!” He shoved the Brits toward the door. Kordt he seized by the arm. “Not you!”
“I agree,” said Holmes. “But with the Blitz over, it’s not as critical as it was in the spring, at least for now, and your health is just as important, if not more so. My dear, you’re exhausted. Remember? We agreed you need rest.”
I agreed. Most likely I would have indulged in good round of grousing about the never-ending, never-varyingly, god-awful plum-and-apple jam, and the ministers, back then, who were paid off by the manufacturers, but for having to plunk my cup down and cover another jaw cracking yawn.
” Hurriedly, ‘Delilah’ wiped the cold cream from his hands and offered one to me, as if it were the most natural thing in the world. “I’m so very pleased to meet you. Jakov Kordt. Please, call me Jakov.”
Holmes has often informed me that I’m an accurate observer, but too often fail to see the forest for the trees. I will tell you, knew I was followed as I returned to my hotel. I decided to follow the concierge’s suggestion to not linger in the streets after dark.
When I let him in, he had brought a tray with mineral water, a blue bottle of bicarbonate, and the food that I’d ordered. The bromide worked its magic and I ate the tartine. When I’d finished, I lay back down, slept for three solid hours and woke much improved.
Holmes, in those days, was so frequently away that I fell into the habit of wandering down to the kitchen when I returned from a shift. It seemed as if Mrs. Hudson was always waiting for me with the kettle on the boil.
“Should have done it sooner. They’ll be back—” Delilah broke off, swung around, and looked at Ugarte’s face. “What the hell happened to your face?”
"Amazing muscular control.” Then I saw the side of his face was badly bruised. “Good Lord, what’s happened to you?”
The Blue Parrot was more cosmopolitan than Rick’s, where the clientele and entertainment were entirely western. There was a scattering of Europeans in the Blue Parrot, but there were also Moroccans, Turks and Moriscos, as well as Arabs. No women, of course. The tables were arranged around a low stage, so I presumed there was belly dancing in the evenings.
“And subject myself to the sight of all those hairy shanks and bell-ends? I shudder at the thought. You know that if you hadn’t—”
, or the Flying Porcupine, for the array of guns with which it was equipped. It was a highly defensible bomber, but only when we were over the Bay of Biscay and the two RAF escort fighters peeled off, was I able to relax enough to look through the packet that ‘Mrs. ‘Arris’s nephew’ had handed to me before we took off.
I stared about foolishly before realizing that I was in front of the arched entry of a café garden, where a large blue macaw was turning somersaults on a ring perch. Seeing he had my attention, he righted himself, and squawked, “Pluck my feathers! Pluck my feathers! Come on, Jo; give it a go.”
“Bloody hell! No!” Ferrari raised his hand, and I thought the backgammon board was going to hit the floor again.
“It’s the truth. If you knew what he went through to get here. All I’m asking of you is meet my friend and listen his story…maybe you will consider helping him.”
When I remember the seemingly interminable night of 10 May—we had no idea it was the last great raid of the Battle of Britain—it seems the intermittent attacks after were worse. There were moonless nights when I’d stumble home in the blackout after a double shift at the hospital, dreading what I would find. But we were fortunate. Shattered windows, fallen chimney bricks, and a railing smashed by a bus that was blown sideways were the worst we physically endured, but we were always short of sleep; always on alert.
I was aware that adrenaline was beginning to surge through my system, but I crossed my arms and fixed my chin. I can be as stubborn as an army mule.
Encountering the young soldiers ended my brief vacation from the war, and I found it hard to sleep that night. I would have given anything to be able talk things over with Holmes, but if there was one thing I have learned from him, it is that the essence of a successful plan is simplicity.
“Knock on the ceiling. They went on quite a bender after you left last night; they’re sleeping it off upstairs.” Ferrari looked troubled “Just so you know, someone took the trouble of having Jimsy beaten within an inch of his life. I can’t say I blame them, but it was excessive. Again, dare I ask why you’re throwing yourself into Ugarte’s arms? It seems precipitous.”
Knowing what was likely to happen to him when the Germans arrived, he joined the thousands who were fleeing ahead of the Wehrmacht and clogging the roads in those weeks. He had a permit to travel as far as Limoges but had failed to obtain the stamp that would have permitted him to leave Paris. Once in Limoges, the question became Where could he go with both the German and French authorities looking for him? After thinking it over, he walked into the recruiting office of the French Foreign Legion and came out with papers that identified him as Henri Dubert, a Swiss National. He had no intention of reporting to the training depot, though. He had run into a girl he knew and the two of them had decided to try and get to Bordeaux.
“Magazine articles. Sounds Bolshi, from what he said, but he’s that young. Wants to be a novelist.” I was not even tempted to chuckle. “Sent his first manuscript to a publisher in London last year.”
He had discovered what a mistake that was when the French declared war. The Sûreté went through the refugee community—rounding up artists, teachers, writers—anyone suspected of communist sympathies—and Jakov, who held a German passport, and had had a schoolboy flirtation with the party, was arrested and interned as an ‘undesirable alien.’
Before I left the hotel, I informed Mr. Adani that, if anyone should ask, I could be found at the Café Américain.
The desk stand was an older style and I had to jiggle the hook a number of times; finally, it connected, and I was able to ring through.
Goold summoned a clerk and, in a surprisingly short time, I was holding four British Emergency Certificates in my hand.
There was one slight disturbance as I was waiting in the bar. A young man arrived dressed in Foreign Legion khakis, thoroughly rumpled and stained, but what struck me was the golden color of his skin and the dark mahogany shade of his hair. I had never seen such a striking combination before. That is saying something, when you consider that the armies of Europe have marched through North Africa since before Alexander was a pup, and that the blond, blue-eyed descendants of Vandals are working the rice fields of Egypt today.
I had my driver take me to the headquarters of the Sûreté where I presented one of Armistead’s card and asked to see Captain Renault.
Years before I ever met Holmes, my Mary died of influenza and, yet, I have never removed my ring. She was a woman of rare understanding, and the gold band reminds me that I was young once.
I was admitted, as the little man had said I would be, but in the anteroom, I found myself at the back of a crowd of people waiting to be called to speak with one of the four clerks who worded behind a railing. The air was rank with the smell of people who, as I discovered, had been traveling and sleeping in their clothes for weeks. Another soldier opened a hinged section of the railing to let a young woman out. She had two solemn children by the hand and I saw there were tears in her eyes.
The waiter who set them down in front of us was not the skinny Arab with khol around his eyes who had served me. The man suddenly looming over us was strikingly different. To begin, he was European and must have weighed at least 21 stone. He accentuated his oddity by affecting a fez and wearing a white gallabiyah with a suit jacket over it.
I had started gathering up the scattered counters, when in he strode carrying Blue Peter on his perch.
Perhaps he intended the raid to prove to the rest of the world that Great Britain would fight on, come hellfire and damnation. It certainly prevented the fleet from falling into the hands of the Kriegsmarine. It also killed nearly 1,300 French sailors. That it happened while the Franco-German Armistice was still being hammered out, many saw as the gross betrayal of an ally.
Most of the men laughed and cheered, the few that weren’t kicking the man on the floor and shoving his chums, interfering with them getting him on his feet. He was clutching one of his friends about the neck and giggling like a manic. Clearly, he was feeling no pain, although, he certainly would in the morning.
We found Delilah, sitting in front of a mirror, removing her make up… No, there are times when my mind still plays that trick on me. We found a golden young man—the legionnaire that I had seen at Rick’s—sitting in front of the mirror, removing Delilah’s make up.
There is a quality to the twilight one only sees in the Maghreb in winter. It was only four-thirty, but a purple curtain was descending, so I let one of the urchins who was begging outside, flag down a taxi, and gave him a coin.
I didn’t see the greasy little man who had spoken to me in front of the consulate until he was beside me. “My American acquaintance,” he said. “How nice to see you again.”
It is impossible to describe the shock of stumbling out of a wet shelter after a sleepless night to find the world reduced to rubble. The butcher, the baker, the green grocer, and the furniture store showrooms—all fixtures of Baker Street— were gone. Houses were gutted.
