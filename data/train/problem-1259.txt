“Troops!
John noticed Harry was talking animatedly with Melinda May, and he was surprised as they actually all exchanged contact information.
The Heartless was actually frozen, dumbstruck and at first confused at what happened.

not enough…” John wryly noted as various officers were sent flying in various directions.  One unlucky officer collided face-first against the window Steve and John were viewing through before sliding painfully off and down to the pavement below.  Rosie giggled and clapped at the farce.  Steve hastily set down Groot from his shoulder and onto Sherlock’s desk.
Groot.
Their screens went blank before a photo of John Watson and Steven Rogers appeared.
John didn’t have any time to protest as he felt Sherlock tackle him towards the ground and shielded John with his own body, hugging him close.
” screeched an outraged Sally, though one could not tell if she were angry and fearful as Anderson, Anthea, and a few Yard officers tried to shoot the Heartless before it could hit John.  Unfortunately, the demon was too swift and evasive, effortlessly skirting past the bullets with ease before heading directly towards John Watson.
Robin snapped, pointing at the Sheriff with his wooden bow, “I would rather stand with a deviant than a traitor to the Crown!  Release Sherlock.
“Yes, but Crossbones took it out on you,” pointed out John as Sherlock helped up his blogger, one hand wrapped around John’s bruised and aching waist.
“If he dies, there will no power in Heaven or Hell that will stop me from hunting you down,” John declared calmly while Basil and Dawson whispered urgently behind Robin’s shoulders, taking care that the Sheriff couldn’t spot them.

“As opposed to you, a
“Pocahontas spoke with the birds, and she reported to us that you went to go spy on Prince John’s castle by yourself.
“Anthea, have a dozen perfumed roses gift-wrapped and delivered to Ms. Fasmire’s address, please,” Mycroft requested.
“Get Baymax to Sherlock and Doctor Watson.  Sherlock is hurt, presumably beaten while being held captive since he went missing,” Robin commanded, pointing a finger at where John Watson was unlocking and removing the padlocked chains around Sherlock.  Baymax titled his head, looking at the bleeding handkerchief wrapped around the fox’s arm.
The Cloak of Levitation brought Rosie in view who looked at the camera with her big, beautiful eyes as the Cloak waved on.
Firmly.  Around the waist.  And resting his head in Bucky’s torso.
It was Bucky’s turn to leer as he pointed out, “I saw you steal the data from Mycroft’s laptop.”
Sherlock was also noticing this for an instant before he turned away.
Sherlock squawked indignantly.
crying.”
“Sherlock?” John murmured out of his fugue state, dazed.
That one moment of hesitation was all Robin needed as he aimed and fired.
Coulson did not look up from his holographic tablet interface nor did his blank expression falter, but one corner of his mouth twitched in displeasure at the subtle threat against Steven Rogers.  Anderson and Lestrade looked at Mycroft in slight alarm.  Sally Donovan however gave a disgusted side-eye at Mycroft.
Sherlock’s jaw throbbed as his teeth began to painfully grind against each other down to the molars.
Finally, the Consulting Detective then dazedly spoke, his voice hoarse after hours of moans and fellatio.
is a sign of a miracle-worker!” Steve exclaimed with his eyes twinkling, and John chortled at the memory.
He was not going to break down.  Nope.
phone, you promiscuous twat…” Sherlock wheezed, starting to feel the bruises that were peppering his chest and face.
“Pocahontas and Ralph are finishing up the last of them and freeing the townspeople, and everyone else took off for the hills screaming.  Elsa and the others just captured Prince John, so I don’t think we’ll be in any danger for a while,” Hiro said as he flipped his visor up, revealing his flushed face.
Sally peered closer at Moriarty’s withered body before she blinked.
Bucky Barnes and Sherlock Holmes’ faces were now red, and Bucky actually crushed the phone in his fingers while Sherlock’s bloodshot eyes suddenly had an intense sensation of budding pressure from his skull, shaking in fury.
If John got his hands on Sherlock, there was a good chance he was going to kill Sherlock himself by throttling him.
The doctor was so disoriented in his PTSD that he didn’t notice the one Heartless running directly at him, ready to detonate its payload.
“And hit Lestrade’s car.  Oh look, here come the rest of Scotland Yard.  Jolly good show, too.”
“Semtex…” Sherlock reported on Lestrade’s walkie-talkie as a warning to the Met (and his brother), “
At first, Bucky and Sherlock were both content to just ignore it, but after thirty seconds, with Sherlock using both of his palms to painfully push Bucky’s chin and head sideways in an effort to stop the Winter Solder from crushing his windpipe with his metal hand, it sort of took them out of the bloodlust.
careless?  Oh wow, I feel really,
Robin politely remained quiet as Baymax then promptly spoke.
“…I am Groot?”
“Bastard!”
“The catapults!  They’re all destroyed!” shrieked an Elephant as the Graviga spells rent their precious war instruments asunder, splintering them into useless kindling and twisted metal.
Steve looked up in dazed astonishment before he slowly turned his gaze to the Cloak of Levitation.  To its pride, the Cloak preened and posed shamelessly, invoking Rosie in its makeshift arms to giggle as the Cloak tickled her.
The second picture was far more serious.
Bucky laughed at the reminiscence.
Surprisingly, it ended after that, with the four men enjoying the closeness of each others’ company, a connection that was deeper than companionship, deeper than brotherhood, deeper than heroes untied in a common goal to fight against a hostile world…

On the other hand, with Steven and John out to run an errand for renovation supplies, it would give Sherlock a
At this point, he was alone and helpless.
Steve rubbed Sherlock's chest soothingly, “Sherlock, you OK?  Do you need anything?”
Gamora won.
Mrs. Hudson covered her mouth with both of her hands with a sob.
“Only if you don’t mind slowing down for a solider with a limp?” John huffed good-naturedly as grasped Bucky’s hands.
“It’s
“And you must be stupider than you look.  One move from either of you, and the Consulting Detective dies,” the Sheriff said harshly.
“Freight - ”
Bucky and John both drew out their guns hidden in the waistband of their pants, but in a touching move, Steven stepped in front of both John and Sherlock while Bucky set his sights.  Upon recognizing the masked stranger, Steve calmly placed a hand on Bucky’s shoulder.
“Unhand me, you big - !”
Bucky just leaned back, steepled his fingers together, and waited for the incoming attack; then he’d have the perfect excuse to break Sherlock’s arms.
Sherlock’s face became even more disparaging as he retorted, “That’s
Steve then kissed the top of Sherlock’s curls, his breath warm and sweet.
It immediately became ugly, both the detective and the assassin trading punches and blows like an obnoxious playground brawl at primary school, rolling around and wrestling on the floor, scattering objects everywhere.
“You stupid punk…” Bucky growled as he helped Steve stand up, using his body for Captain America to utilize as a lean-to.  Upon a closer look, Bucky noted to his budding anger that Steve had far more injuries than the photos indicated.
The detonation brought both of the soldiers out of the reverie as they hurriedly set down the cake and rushed to the window (with Groot, Rosie, and the Cloak tagging along).  Within a few seconds, both John and Steve’s faces melted from alarmed tension to jaded forbearance.
“At least Buck missed Sherlock,” offered Steve with a sheepish expression.
answer prayers,” Sherlock sneered with a toothy grin.
As the white Keyblade reappeared in John’s hands, alarmed and realizing that his trump card had been obliterated, in a wild and desperate frenzy, the Sheriff leapt towards the fallen Sherlock, hoping to either stab the detective or take him hostage.
Rosie gurgled and whined for her father, but soothingly, the Cloak of Levitation made cooing noises from the folds of cloth as it bounced and rocked the infant girl within its comforting fabric, like a true babysitter.
” snapped Sherlock and Bucky in unison.
The wolf was struck with horror; without the medallion Xehanort bequeathed him…
Robin silently took the extra handkerchief from John’s clenched fist and wet the cloth with some water from his canteen before gently wiping the dried blood off Sherlock’s face.

made you scream,” Bucky jumped in.
“For now,” interjected a familiar, slimy voice, and John and Robin Hood both immediately acted on instinct as they whirled around towards the source.  Robin Hood’s paw went for the quiver latched to his belt while John went for his Siger pistol before they both realized that Robin spent all his arrows and John’s gun was long empty, the last bullet used to kill Hans back in Arendelle.
With a whirlwind of smoke and shadow, the enormous Heartless appeared out of thin air.  It was certainly formidable, over seven feet tall and a well-built, muscular frame.  A treacherous Rhinoceros dressed in armor, complete with a red tunic bearing a black Heartless symbol, leather boots and gloves, and even a black cowl and mask to cover its head, contrasting against the sickly-gray skin and yellow jaundiced eyes.  However, the Head Executioner was holding a limp object it its arms tightly, nearly compressing its victim to death in a bear hug.
Bound and gagged, John Watson and Steven Rogers were glaring angrily at the camera as their photo was being taken.  With their hands tied behind their backs and forced on their knees, they were unable to try anything, considering that both were wearing familiar vests with packets of Semtex explosives sewn into them.  And Steven had additional safeguards as Bucky spotted the power-damper collar around Steven’s neck, like a dog, inhibiting Steve and weakening him enough to be kidnapped without much hassle.
After several seconds of pulsating shadow and sun, the radiance finally subsided, allowing all of the people in the warzone and around the world to finally witness what had happened as Sherlock and John opened their eyes.
Lestrade, in the background and down below, was wearily covering his face with his hands as he surveyed the damage.
“YOU shut up!”
“Like Hell.  You look good in a beard.  Can't get more American than that...”
He was far too confident, far too poised despite the surprise raid…
Like a ray of light, John’s Keyblade shot forward, swift and sure and expeditious, tearing through the distance and air directly at Sherlock’s captors within a blink of an eye.
stolen…” John corrected.
Mycroft Holmes wearily covered his face with one hand in the sidelines.
“Really?” Bucky asked, one eyebrow raised in deadpanned yet amused disbelief.
seeing them in the video…” John sidetracked.
Sherlock just pretended to pout, grumpily commenting, “Blame the Hydra Bicycle for the indignity to my mouth.  I’d sue the bastard if I knew if he even had a pound to his name.”
The problem was that John could barely tell who he was more livid at: the Sheriff or Sherlock.
There was a contemplative pause before John beamed, his face lighting up.
Tumblr and Twitter both went duff!  The bloody servers crashed!”
“Uh-huh.  Sure.  Right.  Whatever you say.”

“Sherlock…” breathed Robin in horror, eyes wide.

“Charmed,” the mouse with the moustache smiled as he waved meekly.
“Steve, no.”
“Do you also promise to stop antagonizing Sherlock Holmes and to quit calling him a ‘consulting crapsack’, as apt as that may be?”
” yelled DI Dimmock as he and the other Yard officers fired upon the mass throng of shadowy creatures, their yellow eyes as lifeless and glazed as a wooden puppet’s.  The officer wasn’t sure what was more disturbing: the wooden expressions on the beasts’ faces or that fact that each and every one of them were wearing bearskins and red Grenadier uniforms, complete with the royal chipper shoulder pads, buttons, and bayonets.
Continued compression around chest and thoracic regions leading to a likelihood of a lung collapsing…

The castle was now in flames and starting to resemble Swiss cheese with all the holes and damage it took…

“I do,” Barnes said with a cheeky smirk that made Steve ache to kiss him.
is how Sherlock and John would like to spend their honeymoon doing?  And those assholes would drag Steve and Barnes into it?”
“Are you ever afraid of being bored once the honeymoon is over?” John asked, his eyes searching.
Bucky had just cocked back his fist and was about to let loose a haymaker before it then hit him, eyes widening.
John felt anger.
“Captain!  The hulking ape-man is punching at the south battlement!”
Sherlock looked like he was about to have a stroke.
” was all Dimmock could ask in disbelief, not sure if perhaps Sherlock was being facetious.
There was an uncomfortable silence before Sherlock realized he may have committed a verbal faux pas considering that John was frowning disapprovingly at him (or as much as he could with one eye swollen shut), Bucky looked like he was ready to rip Sherlock’s head off, and Steve, though not showing any offense, had a touch of disappointed sadness in his puppy-dog, cerulean orbs.
let go.”
“…not good?” Sherlock finally asked.
It was a miracle Steve was still alive.
At the same time, Bronx was still clawing and tearing apart the fat corpse of the Sheriff with the two mice, Dawson and Basil, pulling at the webbed appendages at the sides of Bronx’s head, screaming and yelling vainly for the Gargoyle Beast to stop.
“Homecoming.”
“Gawrsh,” Goofy said hesitantly, “Did I do it wrong?  Do you people shake hands here as a way to say ‘hello’?”
Basil and Dawson gave each other a knowing look at John’s words before they continued watching on, only they now joined hands, feeling comfort at the touch of their fingers and paws.
There were several seconds of silence before Sherlock grumpily took out from the folds of his Belstaff coat Mycroft’s secure tablet and began sorting through the information with several flicks of his fingers.
Both of them were ignoring the commotion and escalating brawl in the kitchen of 221B.
“What is it, dear brother?”
And the disc of the medal glistened in the sunlight, oddly polished and brand new, as if it was specifically and recently bequeathed to him, just like the recent Heartless invasions of the entire kingdom or how the Head Executioner just apparated at the Sheriff’s command…
Sherlock didn’t answer back as he laid against Steve’s bicep as a pillow, and the silence was rather unsettling.
“…maybe?” Deadpool playfully teased, wiggling his eyebrows underneath his mask.
Introducing the other Avengers (who were also avid followers of John’s blog) to Watson and having the good doctor subjugated to his adoring fan-base was insulting.
“And now I completely regret subjugating myself to whatever diseases and sexually-transmitted bacteria flowing through your flabby body…” grimaced Sherlock as he gagged and tried to spit out the blood on his tongue.
“One nightmare at a time, John,” muttered Sherlock.
“There’s a perfectly good seat over there for you to sit your ass down,” Bucky muttered between bites as he motioned to the other chair in front of him.
“Actually, no.  It belongs to the
“I do,” John said with a smile as the members of the congregation shifted a bit uncomfortably in their seats, glancing at each other.
a good sign…
Robin Hood winced at the deep gashes the Heartless left on his arm when it tried to stab him; it was deep, bleeding heavily, and was most likely going to require stitches.
“I had them on the ropes.”
Do you understand, Sherlock?  I didn’t care how many Heartless I could have run into, how madcap it would have been, how much I’d be risking the fate of this next Keyblade War if we both didn’t make it.  I just didn’t want to be left behind.
Both Bucky and Sherlock’s heads snapped up as they looked at John with similar puzzled expressions and shocked eyes.
John could tell that the detective was quite injured straightaway.
Meanwhile, John and Sherlock were sluggishly coming out of their stupor, blinking, only to realize that they weren’t dead.  Sherlock, in full protective mode, was lying atop of John, though thankfully, it wasn’t crushingly unbearable with Sherlock’s full weight on top of John’s upper body.  Despite the situation, both could rather admit that they were suddenly concentrating on the soothing warmth in their chests, feeling each other’s rapid heartbeats against their ribcages like a baby bird’s, with Sherlock reflexively embracing John’s torso and tightly pressing it close against his.  With flushed cheeks and shaky breaths, both opened their eyes only to look into each other’s concerned faces, only inches apart.
But before any of them could ponder this appalling clue even further…
“I’ve received enough kisses from you, Barnes.  Go kiss your husband,” John growled playfully, though he allowed Bucky to whimper with puppy dog eyes.
“Are you ready, Steven?” asked John Watson as he readied the web-cam attachment on his laptop.  Steven Rogers propped up the frosted cake with the gorgeous maraschino cherries, frosting and sugar-beaded rosettes with the red, white, and blue sparkler candle standing in the middle.
“Congratulations, you gutless blockhead.  You have grasped the rudimentary concept of sarcasm.  Let’s see if you can also learn the concept of subtlety within the next five years!  Now move over!
“Sod off, you syphilis-ravaged pillock!” as Sherlock managed to narrowly avoid the soldier’s blitz by weaving around the couch.
Just as the Heartless was about to explode...
Goofy looked pleased as he exclaimed, “Hyuck!  You know about the King and Donald too?”
“Piss off, you back-alley cockroach.”
“Actually, if I’m caught, I’ll just say it was all your idea.  Everyone in the country would literally jump at the chance for an excuse to throw
John couldn’t help it.
Bucky rubbed his face with his bionic hand, murmuring, “Shit.  I owe Natasha five hundred bucks now.”
“You’re gonna get it now, you tight-assed spaz!” laughed Bucky like a demented villain from a horror movie as he waved around with the revving chainsaw in both of his hands.  Now satisfied that the violent chase was outside the apartment, Steve and John continued their on-line tribute as if nothing had happened.
“With us is our current associate and guide for the Keyblades, the good chap whose shoulders we are currently riding on, the Captain of the Royal Guards of his Majesty, King Mickey of the Magical Kingdom: Captain Goofy.”
“I need to call my brother.”
Bucky was a bit alarmed while Sherlock made a scandalized sputtering noise in the background.  Unsure what to do, Bucky just stood as still John continued to embrace him, with Bucky’s arms hanging gawkily in midair as if unsure he should return the gesture or if Steven was going to be offended and annoyed of the close contact.
After several seconds, the alien sapling then pranced over to Sherlock’s cell-phone on the desk before entering the key-code and pressing a button to activate the speed-dial.
“Fucking prick!”
“Mainly because my nostrils are forced to endure the assault of your wilting body-odor.”
Steve then smiled, his eyes lighting up as he said with jest, “Apology accepted…Sher-Cock.”
“…although I could be wrong,” the stunned Rat murmured as he stared at the gaping hole.
Thankfully, before John could even think of using his Keyblade again (or Sherlock could summon his), a familiar Gargoyle Hound tore across the grassy field as swift as lightning and appeared from the Sheriff’s blind spot and tackled the corpulent wolf…
Normally, I’d wish you luck at finding the Golden Thread, but in this case, you’d never be able to track us down and find your
Abandoning all pretense, John Watson slowly walked over to Bucky Barnes and hugged him.
He giggled.
The hidden message was clear.
“One.”
their honeymoon, Mr. Wilson.  Steven Rogers, John Watson, James Barnes, and my brother will spend the next two months travelling throughout the world, with ample surveillance and reconnaissance from MI-5 officials and Agent Coulson’s team, dining in luxury hotels, sightseeing, and bringing closure to some of the lingering loose threads that plagued the espionage community for years.
“…and that’s the situation.  We’ll meet you and Mycroft Holmes at the safe-house.”
Sherlock, as much as he hated human contact and gross displays of sentiment, couldn’t help but feel a little left out.
“You and the other millions of people who saw the YouTube video,” cackled Steve uncharacteristically.
The two mice’s eyes crinkled in confusion as they then heard John’s preposterously barmy idea.
comforting about that sentence,” Mycroft intoned disapprovingly with a glare as Deadpool was thrown down rugby-style by Mrs. Holmes before he could reach the nearest window.
“Nine.  Benign.”
“Your brother and the Winter Solder apparently have done more damage to the Hydra facility in one hour than the MI-6 and Coulson’s agents put together in several.  I’d be impressed if I wasn’t worried about what would happen if those two ever decide to go rogue,” Fury implicated meaningfully, his good eye blank but honed in meaningfully on the elder brother.
“Not all of us have a Super-Soldier Serum, Rogers,” chimed in Bucky.
Meanwhile, a certain Guardian of the Galaxy was struggling to ascend upwards the sleeve of Steve’s T-shirt…
The only difference in the demons’ attire from being a complete facsimile of the Buckingham Guards’ uniforms was the strange symbol of the back heart crossed out with a thorny “X”.
Depression in the bloody skin of his face underneath his left eye meant that Steve’s cheekbone was splintered.  Patches of bloody scalp where his hair was missing because Crossbones gleefully ripped off Steve’s golden tresses by the handfuls. Smears of blood and rips in his clothing showing Steve’s skin peppered with red and purple bruises, blossoming into ugly spots, along with scorch marks from electro-torture and cigarette burns, and right in Steve’s scapula region in his back was an ugly, gaping hole where one Hydra agent used a power drill.  Two of his fingers were broken, rasps in his breathing meant that Steve had a couple of shattered ribs, and Steve couldn’t lean on his right leg because his ankle was badly fractured.
The Heartless did not speak, did not falter, and yet they were completely effective in their murderous methods.
didn’t think it through, did he?” Harry remarked, enjoying Mycroft’s irritation.
.  It was a gorgeous piece that was both soothingly mellow and uplifting as John and Sherlock waltzed, staring at each other’s eyes.
shut up.”
“That is not a valid choice.”
“We shall sneak around and grab the medallion in the resulting confusion,” Dawson whispered, but John heatedly murmured under his breath without moving a muscle and trying his best to not ostentatiously move his mouth.
Ram the blunt end of his Keyblade right between the larynx and trachea, crushing the windpipe and take satisfaction at watching the Sheriff slowly suffocate, wide-eyed as he gasps for precious air…
Bucky just hunched his shoulder and growled defensively, “Look, I’m not in the mood to wait.  Hydra could have shuttled Steven and Watson out of the country now if we just dicked around for updates.”
For years to come, Deadpool would be the first person ever in human history to have his own dismembered male organ shoved up his nose.
” Bucky swore, fingers tightening around Sherlock’s neck as he began to throttle Sherlock, “I’ll kill you, I’ll kill you, I’ll –
John Watson didn’t even blink as he ripped though the head and torso one the last Heartless, his Keyblade easily cleaving through the creature and its halberd before the demon crumpled to its knees and disintegrated in a small detonation of shadows.

The screeching of the brakes and the sound of metal colliding with metal wasn’t encouraging as the bedlam grew louder.  John grimaced.  That was a rather fetching Fiesta too…
No, Sherlock was
Nearly everyone else though stayed and applauded as John, Sherlock, Steve, and Bucky all waited for a beaming Kelley to step forward with the satin pillow where the four titanium-gold rings laid.  Each etched not with a diamond, but with a simple star, half red and white, adorned with a tiny leaflet shaped of a honeybee and a hedgehog.
Panting and with sweat covering his brow, John surveyed all around them, but although they had successfully ambushed all the Heartless in the Royal Courtyard, it was isolated and quiet.  No other guards, no alarms raised from the raid, and no sign of anyone else anywhere in Prince John’s castle.
John admitted, “He
Robin got the strangest feeling that an apology from the consulting detective didn’t happen very often given the way John’s stoic veneer had a faint ripple of concerned emotion underneath.
Bucky did his best to not fracture the phone in his metal grip while Sherlock forced himself to remain calm as they both played the video file that was sent to them.
Uncovering the bruschetta and antipasto, Angelo smiled as he said, “Actually, having the Guardians travel all the way from space to taste my cooking is the highest form of a compliment I can think of.”
“Get off me, you blithering dunce!”
safety in the hands of a sociopathic buttwipe!”
“Crapsack?”
“You’re lucky,” Steve commented, “I owe Fury a thousand.”
“From all of us in 221B and in the Marvel Cinematic Universe who could make this special occasion…” John continued before all four of them and Rosie flourished their cake and smiles.
loose threads, I might add.”
And ever since that day, all the male agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and MI-5 and MI-6 would instinctively tense and take a step back whenever Black Widow entered the vicinity.
on this?” growled Natasha in disbelieving outrage as various observers made disgusted noises of shock.
“YOU SHUT UP!”
John could have honestly wondered if he was in the afterlife…
Robin thankfully nodded as he went towards where John was tending to Sherlock (with Baymax watching and commenting from the side).  John already forced Sherlock to remove his Belstaff and his dress shirt, leaving Sherlock barechested as John felt around his head and chest.
“You…you
“No, you are.”

.  As my obligation as a law-abiding citizen of London, I simply adhered to my responsibility of civic duty to call the local tow truck for your obvious parking violation.”
Sherlock just remained listless and catatonic, staring vacantly at the ceiling.
“Turn off your damn phone…” panted Bucky, a bit more exhausted than he would care to admit.
“Baymax and Hiro couldn’t scan the castle for your whereabouts because the Heartless’ influence and magical signatures interfered with their technology.  We were completely in the dark and would have had no idea of your location or even if you were alive to begin with.  Robin thankfully used a disguise to infiltrate the stronghold and overheard the guards, Nutsy and Trigger, discussing about a captured ‘Consulting Detective’.”
“James…” Coulson asked slowly with the tone of voice that wanted an explanation, “Is there a reason you’re calling from
Until the Sheriff looked upwards to see the gaping hole the Keyblade left in the Heartless’ head, above the snout and cleaving through its forehead between the eyes brilliantly by mere centimeters when it rushed past and tore through the Rhino.
The android titled his head before he stated, “Sherlock Holmes has sustained a broken ankle, multiple contusions across his chest, head, and face from physical altercations, a slight concussion, hemorrhaging of his fingers from four pulled fingernails, a stab wound from a dagger in his side, three infected scorch marks set into his skin around the collarbone, internal bruising of tissue around his kidneys, and two broken ribs.  Therefore, immediate attention shall be directed to Sherlock Holmes as of now.”
delivered them to Hydra…” Sherlock murmured, going pale.
cell-phone?”
“Ah, so that’s why he’s here,” Steve realized out loud as he and John watched the Chief Superintendent, frothing and purple-faced with rage, hopping up and down on the pavement and having an absolute screaming fit.  Interesting that they could hear the Chief’s screaming over the wailing sirens.
Robin actually growled, showing his teeth, as Basil and Dawson slowly and clandestinely climbed up the archer’s back, gripping the cloth of his tunic.
In four different places.
“Use your phone.”
John then turned to the camera (which was still filming) and called out, “Kelley, maybe you should be rather glad you don’t interact with us much.  You really don’t want this much insanity in your life.”
Two nascent stars of light, one mysterious and dark, one pure and white, flickered between the two men before illuminating all of Trafalgar Square in a brilliant and dazzlingly surge of brightness.
“By being Hydra’s literal punching bag.  Still, far more preferable to be you than John, I suppose.”

“…I am
The Cloak of Levitation (much to Rosie’s delight) started waving one corner of its fabric body back and forth, getting John and Steven’s attention before producing a card from the silk folds.  With a flourish, the Cloak presented it to Steven, who took it curiously and read the writing inscribed on the note.
An insult to the Queen and country, if there ever was one.
“Our stores of gunpowder!  The castle is collapsing!” hollered a Rat Guard (thankfully not one of the Heartless but rather a living and breathing animal serving Prince John) as a major portion of the citadel buckled from the resulting detonation.
“Can you send me a copy of that image, dearie?” Mrs. Hudson asked eagerly, “Mrs. Turner will absolutely scream when I show her this!”
“I cannot say for certain, but we are now the proud owners of Sherwood Forest’s largest tinder pile!”
Stop, chap!  We don’t want to kill the Sheriff!” cried out Dawson.

“No, not good,” John intoned, his voice indicating that there would be no argument on that.  Sherlock hunched his shoulders and fidgeted for a minute in tense silence before he turned his head to Steven.
“Buck, if you’re going to use a chainsaw,
“I meant thank you for protecting Sherlock.”
Sherlock was beside himself with disgust and scorn; he didn’t think it was possible, but Moriarty actually bragging his plans to his enemies
Clarity came.
“Tough.  I’ll leave when I’m good and ready,” Bucky shot back, eating a plum and trying his best to lounge even further in Sherlock’s armchair, smugly rubbing his rear against the upholstery with aggravating creaking noises.
John numbly commented, “Every muscle in my body hurts.  Why am I still smiling?”
All the Heartless soldiers and minutemen had been vanquished and obliterated…
“Do you, John Hamish Watson, despite all the crap and crazy escapades you get into with him, take William Scott Sherlock Holmes as your husband and partner?  Through every close-call, near-death experience, crazy-assed scheme, and the fact that you’re probably going to be his babysitter and inform him when he’s not good until the end of your days?”
“So did Sherlock.  If John has magical fingers, Sherlock has…”
John wordlessly hefted his Keyblade in both of his hands, admirably unruffled and composed, as Robin Hood discreetly tried to look around, if there were any unbroken shafts or sticks he could use in a pinch.  Alas, there was nothing useful amid the grass and cobblestones except being littered with dead bodies, strewn helmets, shattered weapons, and rubble.
All right, from

Bucky had one corner of his mouth twitch upwards in a rueful grin before he could force himself to admit it.
Surprising everyone, Nick Fury had an actual license to stand as wedding officiant.  It was a wee bit odd seeing the ex-director of S.H.I.E.L.D standing in the altar, in leather trench coat and eyepatch, giving a deadpanned expression as he started the ceremonial script.
Unfortunately, he also showed his teeth.  With a few of them missing, black gaps amid a sea of red and white.
Fury scoffed, “Please.
“Just so we’re clear, this
He was
John couldn’t help but smile and giggle at the uncharacteristic awkwardness and clumsy inelegance as he pushed himself off the ground with Sherlock’s help, trusting hands joined.  Like a contagion, Sherlock couldn’t help but crack a smile in return at the sound of John’s inappropriate mirth, laugh lines marring his face but making it so humanly welcoming and vulnerable.
Or in this case, the two deerstalker hats.
All of their friends just watched with rapt and gleeful attention.

“I’ll live…” Robin Hood murmured.
Everyone blinked in stunned silence.
“I am
John inhaled sharply in dread.
“She knows Buck and Sherlock will send their regards,” agreed Steve as a howl of wrathful pain erupted from Bucky in the background.  Sherlock’s stapler found its mark into the middle of Bucky’s nose.
“I am Groot,” Groot replied in the phone.
John then commented, “My lips still hurt too.”
John Watson and Bucky Barnes, bringing them close.  It was sort of cozy, being enveloped in Steve’s strong arms, so closely intimate.
Steve then grimaced as he moaned, “Buck, noooooo…”
Together, all four of them danced with each other, Steve twirling Sherlock masterfully as John and Bucky performed a smooth underarm turn before Bucky enveloped John close to his chest.  The orchestra, led by Mycroft, presented a tasteful yet surprisingly harmonious pastiche of
Bucky decided to forgo Steven’s past pleas for once; the Consulting Detective brought it upon himself, really.
The Cloak of Levitation cooed approvingly, causing the little baby in its grasp to giggle and let out a shriek of laughter as Dr. Strange’s companion shushed Rosie while cradling her lovingly within itself as a sling.
Quite a few winced in surprise as Coulson and the others caught up with Wade Wilson as Natasha and Violet Holmes both began wailing the wedding crasher.
Sherlock had the grace to look a bit embarrassed as he heatedly explained, “I may have deleted it, all right?!”
“I am Groot.”
,” Steve intoned, raising an eyebrow.  This prompted a few chuckles and snorts from the audience.
Hiro then managed to summon his microbots from the hidden caches of his suit to gently form a black wave of mass, surging and comprised of all the hi-tech miniatures working in tandem, to gently encapsulate and cocoon Bronx before extracting him off the remains of the Sheriff.
That night, in the luxurious Four Seasons in Budapest, Steve, Sherlock, John, and Bucky all laid on their backs on the soft bed, enjoying the cool breeze wafting through the open balcony door that caressed their sweaty bodies, all modesty covered underneath the sheets and comforter.
“I believe you’ve lost something, Doctor Watson,” the Sheriff said smugly before calling out, “Meet the Head Executioner.”
John said slyly, “…among other reasons.”
“Your art blog has touched the lives of many people who need a bit of laughter and joy over our escapades, and it is a honor of the highest level to be able to witness you draw Sherlock and I.  Bloody hell, you have more subscribers to your blog than me!  If that does not show an upbeat purpose, I don’t know what will,” John praised.
Ever since Steven Rogers and the Winter Soldier came into their lives, Sherlock’s days were filled with nothing but tension, aggravation, and many, many injuries due to that “Hydra Bicycle”.
Sherlock’s face actually went a shade paler while John’s heart began to pound excruciatingly against his ribcage with dread.
There was a sudden flush of movement…
“I’m all right, Sherlock,” John tried to assuage, and at Sherlock’s disbelieving glare, John added, “Steve got it loads worse.  I think there was a line of Hydra agents who wanted to take a round or two on Captain America while he was tied up.  Mostly everyone else ignored me.”

“You are a loyal friend and a loving woman who stands by her family and brings brightness to everyone at her home and her work.  You find happiness in not only bringing positivity to everyone in person and on-line, but you adopt everyone into your graces, like a sister,” Steve said with affection.
On the other end, Anthea blinked.  That was rather unexpected.
“I do,” Sherlock said gravely as Mr. Carlton Holmes gave Fury a glare for his lack of tact.  Despite the painful memories, John gave a light comforting squeeze to Sherlock’s palm.
John’s jaw visibly tightened, his left hand twitching against the Keyblade handle.
Without uttering a single word, Bucky’s smirk went wide and ribald as he then took the remains of the plum core in his metal fingers and crushed it easily into pulp with a deft squeeze.  Sticky juice and bits of fruit splattered on the green leather upholstery of the armrest and down the sleeve and into the sitting cushion.  Bucky’s eyes never left the twitching Sherlock’s face as he then self-righteously smashed the mess from his hands on the chair’s support, callously wiping the paste clean off his hands and onto Sherlock’s chair.  And just to add salt to the wound, Bucky then rudely and unceremoniously passed gas, loudly farting on the cushion.
The Sheriff was dead…
“Filching a jet isn’t the best impression to make on my brother,” pointed out Sherlock from behind Bucky’s seat.
When Bucky tossed his deerstalker, Logan was the
Dimmock looked at Mycroft Holmes and Nick Fury as if he was asked to face down a pit of man-eating lions without any sort of weapon, wondering just what the hell he got himself into.
on his violin as the Winter Soldier and Captain America slowly sashayed across the court.

“Shut up.”
“Robin, are you all right?” John asked as he was beside the fox in an instant, professionally wrapping the wound with his handkerchief, but the archer managed a weak smile.
“Can’t blame him for being eager.”
“I am Groot.
Sherlock protested, “This is ridiculous.  Just have Pocahontas heal me with her magic, and I’ll be right as rain within moments.  We cannot just uselessly - !”
“All right back there, Mr. Cloak?” Steve asked.
” Anderson cried as everyone in the square then honed on the two shining sources of illumination…
“Daybreak.  Furnace.”
Robin Hood blinked and looked up at John Watson, the light of comprehension slowly dawning on his face.  Sherlock felt his face go slack with confused disbelief as John then opened his watering eyes and looked intently at Sherlock.
Another video clip then played with the impeccably-dressed Jim Moriarty, very much alive and healthy (for a criminal mastermind who put a gun to his mouth), cheerfully waving to the camera like a gleeful child.  With snake-like eyes and an elatedly manic expression, the psychopath sang, “To the Manchurian Failure and the Consulting Crapsack,
Both the fox and the human lingered, tense, until the Sheriff of Nottingham glanced up at the two opponents and smirked.
lucrative amount to have these two in their possessions, but the downside is they probably won’t be adorable anymore.  Ah well, nothing lasts forever, etcetera etcetera…”
“I need to call Fury and Coulson.”
“Stop…” rasped Bucky, now delirious with fear and rising bile.
Until Steve let out a hearty guffaw.
“C’mere, Sherlock…” Steve playfully growled with affection as he reached out at Sherlock (with his broken arm no less!) and grabbed Sherlock’s dress shirt before dragging a shocked detective over.
“Sherlock helped save you too, Watson.”
“Your eyes are watering.”
“Shut up, you walking venereal disease.”
“Bloody Hell, I could actually watch this for hours…” murmured Mike Stamford as he took in the sight of the four men enjoying the music together with his wife.

“Give that back, you filthy thieves!” hollered the Nottingham bureaucrat as he dropped his arm by an inch or two.
Mycroft’s mouth thinned before looking at the bottle of antacid and immediately dropping the medicine back into his desk drawer before slamming it shut and heading to the open bar nearby.
this time if you ever pull that shit again.”
” gasped Donovan, her eyes wide as she and every officer made the familiar connection.
Sometimes, Sherlock regretted giving Steven and John the idea to renovate and move into the 221C basement flat down below just to see the look of horrified shock on Bucky’s face when Steven told him the news…
Where’s my bike, you asshole?!”
Art by
The British detective blinked before he realized that Bucky was telling the truth.
” John and Steve exclaimed as they positioned the beautiful cake in full view of the camera.
“Oh for God’s sake!  If this makes you more agreeable –
,” John growled in an uncharacteristically feral voice.  He was hoping his burst of anger would amuse the wolf enough to not notice the two mice detectives sprinting towards Robin Hood, carefully ducking behind rubble and the tall grass all around them.
Instead, numerous shining hearts from the victims peppered the sky above, like a Christmas tree strung with rosy lights, levitating higher once the Heartless ripped their quarries’ life-forces before vanishing into oblivion.   If Anthea had to guess, the number of casualties had to be in the hundreds already.
” howled Bucky at the top of his lungs as he lunged towards Sherlock, but he was so disoriented and wildly overwhelmed that his swing at his antagonist missed Sherlock by a wide berth, allowing Sherlock to effortlessly dodge the punch and leaving Bucky clinging to the fireplace mantle for support.
“More like me and another lawyer named Jeri Hogarth that May thinks I’ll enjoy meeting,” winked Harry as she gave her brother an affectionate and sloppy kiss on the cheek.
More and more explosions began to ring throughout the city of Westminster, invoking screams and cries of the civilians as the Yard did their best to stop the destruction from becoming graver.
“If anything,
seat.
Bucky, to his credit, didn’t even yelp or flinch in surprise at being caught unaware that the British pain-in-the-ass stowed away in the hijacked Eurofighter with him.  Although Bucky had to remind himself that he couldn’t brawl with Sherlock at risk of cracking the glass of the canopy and rendering the jet incapable of ascending to high altitudes.
The fact that the medallion handing off the Sheriff’s neck as a chain instead of the typical medieval ribbon, as if he wanted to ensure that he couldn’t and wouldn’t lose it…
Rosie giggled in front of the camera while the Cloak of Levitation used one corner of its fabric to simulate a waving hand.
The Sheriff’s smile grew even more self-assured, cocky, oblivious and yet dangerously ruthless.
Even with his time as a forensic technician for the Met, Anderson had never seen a cadaver with every one of his fingers broken.

Mycroft replied, “That
“Stop, drop, and roll!  Stop, drop, and roll!
It was then that both John Watson and Sherlock Holmes realized that they were both equally in possession of the strangest and most beguiling weapons ever witnessed in Earth’s history.
Anderson’s response was the most truthful.
Bucky had to admit that even disbanded and exposed after the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D, Hydra certainly had some impressive weaponry.  He had never before seen a tank shoot electro-magnetic discharges or create that sort of molecular combustive effect.
“Thank you.”
The hours flew by with laughter, conversation, dancing, and a drinking contest between Star-Lord, Phillip Anderson, Gamora, Tony Stark, Kraglin, Mike Stamford, and S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Daisy Johnson, Mack and Hunter.
“Longing.  Rusted.  Seventeen,” Sherlock enunciated, slowly and loudly, his deep voice punctuating each vowel.
John broke the silence.
Never mind.  It was merely sentiment.  Sherlock wasn’t feeling deserted.
John committed to memory of seeing a flabbergasted and baffled Sherlock, speechless and temporarily struck dumb, for the rest of his life.  This along with seeing a talking, human-sized, anthropomorphic dog with two adequately-sized talking mice who just happened to be eerily similar to the famous Disney characters they depicted.
Sherlock and Bucky’s eyes widened; Hydra had impeccable timing and clearly anticipated Steve and John’s rescue….
“Second, actually.  The last time, his jaw wasn’t broken.  It was just dislocated after Logan got through with him.  Although to be fair, if someone called my daughter a rabid animal, I would have done a lot worse.”
John Watson didn’t even stop to stare, and instead, tore off in a mad dash towards Sherlock.
After the pictures and every friend and Avenger settled in the banquet hall, gossiping and making pleasant small talk with each other while munching on appetizers, there was a wonderful set of dancing as Steve and Bucky had their first dance together on the floor.  Sherlock played a touching and lovely medley of
The Heartless collapsed, dead before it toppled over.
“Don’t sell yourself short, John…” murmured Steve with a wry grin, “You should have seen him when he broke Crossbones’ nose.”
“Augh!  What is happening?!
“Let’s not have any crazy talk, Watson,” grumbled Bucky.
“Shithead!”
For the oddest reason, Mycroft felt the beginnings of a migraine popping up…
All of them were staring at the remains of the Consulting Criminal on the tiled floor.
That was
“Sir, isn’t it even a bit bonkers of the fact that we’re serving actual
driving the tank!”
“You broke my Mind Palace.”
Steve tried to shrug dismissively despite his injuries with a smile.
John didn’t finish that melancholy thought, but he smiled as he then did something quite heartwarming and poignant.
Looking less like the posh bastard and more like an awkward, country-bumpkin.
After the mutilated Deadpool was escorted under heavily armed guard by MI-6, after more glorious photos and tearful exclamations of joy, congratulations, and hugs and kisses, the time came to toss the bouquet and garter.
“I was here first!  Deal with it!”
He would deny that claim while swearing his hand on the Bible in front of the Queen’s Magistrate while on his death bed, stark naked.
” Sherlock cursed uncharacteristically, ungracefully, before he bolted out of the door as fast as he could, weaponless, before the Winter Soldier could seize him.  Undaunted, Bucky pursued Sherlock from close behind.
“I am Groot!” Groot cried happily.
“Robin, you are injured.  Initializing scan…” Baymax intoned as he pointed at the deep scratches.
Infuriatingly, Sherlock was not even taking precautionary cover behind the auto as he stood and stared, trying to deduce the strange anomalies assaulting England.
Sam met up with Lestrade who had a big grin on his face.  Sam took one look at the Detective Inspector before he smirked.
” snapped Hiro and Robin (with Robin being the angrier).
That wall is over ten feet of solid stone!  He’ll
Embed his Keyblade into the sternocleidomastoid muscle to sever the carotid artery and jugular vein in the Sheriff’s neck…
It then hit him, a tidal wave of horror and dread.
They both watched on for several more seconds before Steve groaned, “Please tell me Sherlock isn’t coming to Buck’s defense by deducting embarrassing stuff about the Chief Super.”
“What was that?” Lestrade asked as car pulled into the street.
Sherlock’s taunt ended with a painful grunt as Bucky, now completely incensed, tackled the detective with a terrific shoulder-butt into Sherlock’s chest, and surprised at the sudden burst of speed, Sherlock had no choice but to topple gracelessly out of the chair and onto the floor with Bucky trying to pound him.
It was as if everyone in the criminal underworld was too afraid to attempt it…
“For the moment.  Although I do think
“At least I’ll take solace that Buck attacked the Chief in Sherlock’s honor.  Oh good, now the other Scotland Yard officers are trying to tackle Buck and Sherlock.”
For John and Sherlock’s dance, Mycroft surprisingly took over Sherlock’s Stradivarius (with the wedding orchestra playing their instruments in conjunction) as he played a beautiful piece written by Sherlock himself specifically titled
“Scanners indicate that Sherlock’s body temperature is slowly but steadily rising along with his heartbeat and hormone levels of endorphins.  I suggest several hours of quiet rest, relaxation in an unobtrusive environment, and for John Watson to stop holding Sherlock’s hand.”
“John…” whispered Sherlock in his blogger’s ear as he instinctively hugged John close. As the Heartless was now less than a foot away…
” howled Bronx as the blue-skinned beast rigorously slammed himself into the Sheriff and set upon the corrupt officer in a furious rage, ripping with his claws and biting with his teeth, blood and bits of stained cloth and flesh flying everywhere.
Mrs. Turner murmured worriedly as numerous pedestrians stopped and eavesdropped at the tumultuous commotion from the flat upstairs, “Should we call the Met?”
Smash!
“Not only did we want to give you our compliments, but we created this movie to say a few things that all four of us have been meaning to tell you for quite some time as a toast,” Steve disclosed.
From the hidden darkness within the folds of time and space in the Dark Meridian, the yellow-eyed Nobody took this all in from his scry, watching the picture Doctor Watson smile as he touched his forehead against Sherlock Holmes’.  He then heard the muffled sound of footsteps in the sand as another figure joined him along the murky beach.
“Baymax, I am fine.  Go help Sherlock and Doctor Watson,” Robin repeated, a bit irritated but extremely vexed about Sherlock.
There was a pause.  And Steve, Bucky, and John all collectively blinked before they asked in unison.
With that, both of the men left to calm down the fracas and brawl below.
“Sod to the memory.  I’m posting
The whole church erupted with laughter and tittering.  Even Lestrade was clapping and chortling.
Goofy character, perhaps that was understandable.
“You asked for vows, Fury.  Not miracles,” Bucky replied, deadpanned.
And to everyone’s surprise, Steve Rogers turned and gave a chaste kiss to both Sherlock and John Watson on the lips, cupping their faces gently.  Bucky gave John a bear hug, swinging side to side a bit, before turning to Sherlock and stating flatly, “I’m
Damn it.
Sherlock’s brain then kicked in at the choice of a seventies song used on their phones.
“Tell me where Captain America and John Watson are being kept, and I won’t cripple you…” Bucky hissed murderously.
The dance would have ended smoothly if it wasn’t for a certain wedding crasher…
“No, pass a message to Robin…”
Anderson blinked before his gaze went to the blood splatter on the floor, walls, and even the ceiling of the room, noticing that they were too widespread for such a contained assault.  Not to mention that the corpse wouldn’t look
Sometimes, it was easy to forget that Steven Rogers had a hidden mean streak.
With that settled, Sherlock knelt down in front of John and, with a surprising amount of tenderness, wrapped his fingers around John’s wrists.
“Relax, Buck.  It’s all right.  It’s just Deadpool,” Steve stated.
“Actually, this is one of Sherlock and James’
Steve managed to find his voice as he then asked, “…how is that even biologically possible?”
Bucky’s complexion went white as he stiffened and gripped the armrests of the chair, hissing with distress, “No…”
Shuddering and giving a quaky, inhuman scheech, the Heartless toppled backwards and died, crumbling into shades and wisps of black smoke as the injured Sherlock tumbled to the grass and dirt with a groan, still bruised and bound in chains, but still very much alive.
” Dimmock asked, flummoxed.
A perfect distraction, exactly as Sherlock anticipated.
Mycroft then turned his head to Coulson and asked, “So, what happened when my brother and the Winter Soldier caught up with James Moriarty?”
An Earthling that said the smartest thing all day!
Bucky smirked, exasperated, as he emphasized, “
That was unexpected.
“Yeah?”
The Sheriff tilted his head a bit mockingly, as if John has told an amusing joke.
The Heartless had all vanished, fading and completely obliterated from the sudden glow that engulfed all of London temporarily.  Except for the devastated monuments and piled cars, the smoking fires, and the various injured English citizens, officers, and paramedics mingling about, there were no traces of the deadly shadowy creatures.
“Er…Sherlock?” John asked, “Did you grab that from our flat?”
” the Chief was heard shrieking throughout the entire block and through the windows of 221B.
?  Now I’ve heard everything.  Anyway, if you be so kind as to relinquish your key card and accompany us for the doors for the hand and retina scanners, there will be no need for dismemberment.  Unlike this cur, I am associated with MI-6, and I can promise you safety and witness protection by the British government.”
” screamed the same rhinoceros, now missing his horn (and a few teeth), his voice an octave higher in terror as his comrades withdrew away as fast as they could.
“Dipshit!” Bucky snarled nasally (with blood dripping out of his nostrils) as he tried to tackle Sherlock.
On the video, Moriarty then leaned closer and sneered.
“Robin, are you all right?!” Hiro asked as he leapt down from Baymax.
Sherlock was done.
In addition to being swathed in iron chains and in a gripping vise within the Heartless’ brawny arms, Sherlock was teetering on the brink of consciousness from a rather severe thrashing.  His prized Belstaff coat was torn, his nose broken and smeared with blood along with the rest of his cut and bruised face.  Dried vomit and bile crusted down his mouth and chin.  A red shiner bloomed in Sherlock’s left eye, swelling and making it difficult for Sherlock to blink, his curly hair messed up and missing patches (where the Sheriff ripped it off by the handfuls while punching Sherlock repeatedly in the face during his captivity).  And to add further insult to the injury, Sherlock’s ankle was at a wince-worthy angle, fractured.
John paused as he contemplatively looked at Sherlock.
What’s going on?!
“A bunch of all our unsolved cold cases.
“I’m sorry…” Sherlock whispered, his voice dry and raspy.
,” growled Sherlock dangerously.
“It is.  Wait…look over the rail.  Are there any cameras or infrared sensors near the window-ledge below us?”
Indeed, more and more Heartless materialized within portals of shadows, completely appearing out of thin air, before jogging alongside the Buckingham Guard monstrosities.  These new horrors were quicker, faster, sprinting towards various monuments and crowds of people before killing themselves as effective suicide bombers.  They were more wraithlike, pointed ears and with gangly arms and legs like frog-like gremlins, wearing beige vests strapped across their torso’s with blinking lights and duct-taped bricks of explosive across the fabric.
Both John and Sherlock were at a complete loss of words as they ogled dumbly at these strange irregularities.
“I was going to perform
“And it’s

Possible puncture of the posterior segment of one of Sherlock’s lungs given the way he was now rasping…

therapeutic from that point on…
“I’ve narrowed down out of the potential Hydra safe-houses to two possible candidates,” Sherlock muttered before he spitefully pointed out, “But my misdemeanor pales in comparison to your grand theft, Sergeant.  It appears that the good Captain Rogers will have to settle for conjugal visits every month at whatever maximum security facility my brother decides to let you rot in.”
would think when he finds out you have quite the potty-mouth!”
Thankfully, Sherlock broke the mood.
John then leaned over closer to the camera before he smiled and said, “To Kelley, if we wish to conclude this homage, it is this: some people need a conductor of light…”
If George Martin didn’t trademark the phrase, it would have been brilliant to say that winter was coming.
The sheriff cackled hard, nearly choking at his joke as the knife dug deeper and deeper into Sherlock’s skin, slapping his leg with one hand.
“And for all the people you have inspired and touched with your blog and your art,” John articulated before a deep and familiarly demonic staccato reverberated throughout the flat.  Steve frowned before he held up a finger at the camera.
rather funny to see Kelley grab our two prats by the ears and force them both clean up the mess they left in her restaurant during their last fight,” John laughed.
“Yeah, Buck.  Go and kiss me.  I’m not sore
Mike Stamford prayed, coffee mug overturned and forgotten as it dripped into his students’ test papers.
“Wh-…where did that light come from?” Sally Donovan asked, rubbing her eyes and blinking to ensure she did become temporarily blind from the brightness.  Anderson then gasped as he pointed with his hand at Sherlock and John Watson.
Sherlock’s deposit to Mrs. Hudson was
“I’ll say!  You got Buck and Sherlock of all people behaving!  That
who participated in the ceremony and caught it.  Still, it was a touching and sentimental moment to see Logan and Molly slow dance together with Sherlock playing
“Mycroft has infinite resources, the best of the best.  His team of contractors could renovate 221C within mere days if need be while you and John can recuperate in our flat for as long as you need to,” Sherlock offered.
Inside the flat, it was complete chaos.  The coffee table was smashed into splintered halves, every furniture in the living room and kitchen was overturned with test tubes, glassware, dishes and papers shattered or spread about.  All the bookshelves were toppled over and strewn helter-skelter.  The kitchen sink was missing its spout and now merrily squirting a miniature geyser.  The fireplace mantle was pathetically swinging loose off the walls by a lone nail, several kitchen cabinets had their doors forcibly torn open or caved inwards, the steel refrigerator was lying open on its side, spoiled food melting on the floor, and the mirror above the hearth was blatantly signaling seven years worth of bad-luck.  And it was probably best to not mention the new holes in the walls (surprisingly, the fire poker was stuck and embedded within the plaster).
“If something happened to you, and I knew that there could have been something I could have done to stop it, to fix it, to at the very least go with you so that you wouldn’t be alone against the world…”
good!”
And all over the world, on various television networks as they showed the coverage of the massacre on every news broadcast from BBC to CNN to ANN7 to NHK World…
“…somewhere, somehow, Wilson’s probably laughing his ass off on this one.”
Sherlock saw stars and flashes of light dance across his eyes and Bucky yanked on his hair and shoved his face and hard against the floor, hammering his stomach all the meanwhile.  Spitting out blood from his mouth, the Consulting Detective wiggled and fought for leverage as he used every dirty technique he could think of to gain the upper hand.  He heard something rip, and Sherlock beseeched that it was cloth and not his hair coming out of his scalp.
That was over three hours ago.
Then the full meaning of Bucky’s words hit them with total comprehension.
All right, maybe (
John shook his head as he clarified his point.
“Nicholas Fury was the only one who met Mycroft’s stringent security clearance requirements,” Anthea replied with a smile.
Steve blinked before he shook his head and muttered, “Never mind.  I won’t ask.”
“So, you and Agent May, eh, Harry?” John teased.
Steve recited slowly, “‘Kelley, you are an inspiration and a magic of your own.  Never forget that creativity is no difference from intelligence, that bringing color to a page is bringing life to a soul, and that laughter and merriment can pierce even the most horrific darkness.’”
That was enough for Dimmock as his face went to a sickly shade of green before he covered his mouth with one hand.  Running as fast as he could, Dimmock dashed out of the room, only to vomit his lunch out with disgusting sobs and heaving gasps.
“I’m surprised a woman of her age can gracefully perform such a tackle,” blinked Molly Hooper at Mrs. Holmes.
John then felt Sherlock’s fingers latch around his hand, ice-cold but when the doctor looked into the consulting detective’s blue pupils, there was depth and emotion in Sherlock’s pupils, not outright blubbering and loud declarations of regret, but the quiet speculation in which something mysterious and murky gave light to something deeper within, something rarely shown unless John learned to look beyond and truly see into Sherlock’s heart.
Unremitting, Sherlock Holmes and Bucky Barnes kept brawling it out, no-holds barred, with Sherlock deducing that the throbbing in his jaw signified that he lost a couple of teeth while Bucky hoping that his left eye was merely swollen shut and not because Sherlock gouged it out with his fingernails.
“Aw, miss your cripple already?” Bucky jeered.
“To Ms. Kelley Fasmire, our dear friend and ardent supporter…” Steve began.
Prince John then did the only thing that came to his panicked and shell-shocked mind.
“Yes, because it’s stolen…”
I am Groot!”
John was rather blasé as he murmured, “It’s not the strangest thing to happen to my jumpers.  You should have been here for some of the rather unorthodox experiments Sherlock has performed to my clothing.”
John then discerned what Basil was referring to.
“You couldn’t do this earlier,
“Forget about retreating!  Run for your lives!”

John chuckled as he helped Steve with the heavy cake platter, “Yes, Groot, you are fine the way you are.”
“Then the bloke
“They
“Of course we do Goofy!” squealed Anderson excitedly (drawing a few rolled yes sin his direction), “But…if you’re here, does that mean Donald and Mickey Mouse are real too?!”
getting better.  They formed the dog-pile much quicker than last time,” noted Steve, nodding his head a bit.
Bucky was now completely apoplectic as he jumped on top of Sherlock, ready to crush him through the floor and roaring wordlessly and bellowing piercingly enough to cause Mrs. Turner and Mrs. Hudson (who were enjoying coffee and scones in Speedy’s Café next door) to snap out of their conversation.
Drax of the Guardians asked in the background, “Why is it not permissible to think of a hat?”

“You seem quite pleased with yourself, Torryaxim…” Master Xehanort stated as his newest member.
” yelled another Rhino Guard as he and over twenty others blitzed Hiro and Baymax.
“Even tied up, John gives a terrific head-butt,” shrugged Steve, leaning heavily on Bucky.
Sherlock aborted the memory from his Mind Palace as he focused on the crisis at hand.
All right, breaking Sherlock’s nose at John and Steven’s first lunch date was bad.
The Heartless literally defied every law of biology and physics Sherlock knew.
Coulson then stated, reading aloud from his notes, “From what I gathered from their brief interview, after Sherlock shot out Moriarty’s kneecaps and emptied the rest of his gun’s clip into Moriarty’s crotch and after Bucky broke Moriarty’s arms and fingers, Bucky then ripped off Moriarty’s jaw before ramming his metal arm down Moriarty’s esophagus and, and I quote: ‘vibrated the metal plates hard enough to act like a blender to make a milkshake out of his internal organs…’”
“Retreat, retreat,
“Final warning, you slagging munter: if you do not relinquish my chair from your ravaged buttocks,

With a dry mouth, Sherlock repeated dully, “You broke my Mind Palace.  All three of you have literally buggered my brains out.  My mind is a complete blank...”

After a few more moments of calm, John’s eyes softened as he exhaled wearily.
going to shipping hell for this.
There were several seconds of silence before Sherlock spoke.
Mycroft picked up immediately, his voice showing crisp annoyance.
WHOOOOSSSH!
It was safe to say that things were going to be a lot more interesting with these two around…
Outside on the Hydra compound, two low-ranking Hydra guard were watching this with various degrees of confusion and disbelief.

What could ever destroy such heavy instruments of war built of the finest metal and wood?!”
“Jury’s still out on that one, actually…” Kelley admitted as she took a candid photo.
“Sam, let me share a few stories about Sherlock with you over a pint…”
“Up yours, you cocaine-snorting deadbeat.”
The screens on their phones went black, but not before displaying a rather infuriating taunt for additional injury with a small emoji of Moriarty with a toothy smile and making a zipping motion across its mouth with a tiny hand.
Sherlock’s phone then began to chime audibly.

Moriarty’s voice then rang childishly and tauntingly through their phones’ speakers.

“There is no window-
Poom, poom, poom!
Robin winced; he didn’t need to know the details.  Hiro nodded as Baymax ambled off in a steady gait.  The fox then turned to the human prodigy.
” Steve barked.
Though he was still holding his knife precariously to Sherlock’s throat, the Sheriff was so immersed and preoccupied with horror at the sudden foray, he did not realize the tiny paws pulling at the latch of his necklace until it was too late.
With annoying xylophone chimes and flowery harps, the Flash cartoon exhibited a cartoony and miniature form of a chibi-fied Jim Moriarty in a black suit and tie, skipping across a field of green carnations (damn him) and carrying a wicker basket. On the caricature’s face was an exuberant and smug smile and leering eyes before it stopped and pointed to its bag.
one spiteful exploit was just the small step that crossed the damned Rubicon.
Uncharacteristically giggling, Steve asked, “Did we just…fondue for four hours straight?”
“Try the heavy artillery!  Use the tasers, the pepper spray, hell, use tear gas!
John, sighing at Sherlock’s obliviousness, answered, “We have absolutely no idea.  They just appeared.”
Warmly, Bucky used his non-bionic arm to bring John closer to his sore body, cuddling the doctor to his side.  Bucky then kissed the top of the blond, matted curls before commenting.

“Oh God above all, that thing is no Marshmallow Man!
” Lestrade ordered.
“Are you kidding?” scoffed the second one, “We haven’t had
Already, the entirety of Trafalgar Square was inundated with the alien invasion.  It was as they were a swarm of ants, a tidal wave of black invaders, flocking over a sugar cube, swelling upon each other and multiplying by the minute.  No matter how hard Londoners tried to fight back or flee, the Heartless stabbed, shot, and dogpiled any helpless victim they could reach, invading the South Africa House, Whitehall, and even defying gravity by running up the walls and scaffolds of Saint Martin-in-the-Fields.
In that split second, John could only think how it wasn’t so bad, dying this way.  At least Sherlock wasn’t going to leave him behind a second time, wasn’t going to abandon him like Mary…
“Why?  You recognize the car he’s driving?”
Robin couldn’t even bear to watch as he shut his eyes and turned his head away, not sure if he could ever purge the sounds of the disembowelment from his nightmares.
“We don’t know,” she decided to say at last.  Anderson was quite sure he would have preferred it if she lied to him…
shut up!”
“My God, you fight as badly as you reek!”
Everyone turned towards the sources and stared, mouths dropping and eyes so wide, one could see the whites all around.  Even Sherlock and John Watson were struck dumb at the scene.  One constable even fainted due to the shock and the sudden sensation of blood rushing to his head.
Bucky couldn’t help but smirk as he continued to sit on the squirming form’s back, “Oh, well, Sherlock was gracious and kind enough to let me use his phone first, like the swell guy he is.”
“You don’t think…” another constable asked, but so shocked, she was unable to continue the sentence.  Sherlock’s breathing was labored, his mind whirring so fast, he could barely see straight, pale-faced as he tried to assure himself that Moriarty was dead.  Lestrade gave Sherlock a concerned look.  Anderson turned to Anthea (who was beside him against the cover of Havelock’s statue) in puzzlement.
Sherlock just stared blankly at the ceiling ahead, without a word and with glazed eyes and a slack expression of disbelief.
“#Moriarty’d!”
“Hey, leave some of Buck for me, John…” teased Steven as he ambled over, hopping on his good leg, and embracing
Sherlock winced as he continued to blink, this time a bit more urgently as his mouth went into a tight-lipped line.
Only to have the grizzled Logan Howlett step forward and draw out his adamantium claws with a sharp
“We wished to commemorate this day as a thank you for all the ardent support you have shown all of us throughout the years,” John spoke over the noise of Bucky crashing against the bookshelves.
The fox also had the strangest feeling that the apology was meant for something far more than this one transgression in Nottingham…
“Hey, John may have made you groan, but
Greg Lestrade and Sam Wilson stood by as the best men.  As a joke, they got matching deerstalker hats for Sherlock and Bucky to wear for their respective bachelor parties.  To their collective shock, both Bucky and Sherlock donned them proudly as they walked down the aisles with Steve and John, hand in hand.
Dedicated to the lovely
“Plenty of time then,” chimed back Elena Rodriguez, and within a single heartbeat, the vests disappeared from Sherlock’s hands as the speedster relinquished them from their position before returning to her original place where the Avengers and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D were currently eradicating the rest of the legionnaires lingering around the headquarters.
Bucky’s face fell as his eyes went wide, his mouth slightly open in a silent scream.
Steven noticed.
The air was filled with the screams and ringing of gunshots and laments of terror and death.
Before Sherlock could even protest or writhe away, he then found himself firmly sandwiched between Steven Rogers and John, enveloped in Steven’s arms in a hearty embrace.

“Let go.”
“Troops!  What in blazes are you dolts doing?!  Shoot them!
sorry.  Nope.  Not in the least bit.
It appeared Brock Rumlow found out the hard way that Anthea was quite proficient with a rocket launcher…
Smiling widely, Sherlock picked up the newspaper on the corner stand and began to read, not noticing (or caring) at the uncontrollable tremors of crippling strain, apprehension, and murderous rage running throughout Bucky’s body.  Bucky’s legs were so feeble that he could barely support himself against the fireplace to soothe the shivering.  The ex-assassin was so sick that he could have easily vomited right then and there, his head slowly swimming back to a steady rhythm due to the unnaturally high cortisol levels.  It took several minutes before the hyperventilating Winter Solder could calm down, repeating the phrases “Steve”, “Sarah”, “Brooklyn”, “Howling Commandos” over and over in his mind until he could actually snap out of his fugue state. With teeth clenched and spittle building up on his tongue, a traumatized and enraged Bucky asked hoarsely with incredulity, wide bloodshot eyes nearly popping out of his skull.
Nick Fury then said with a flourish, throwing up a hand and actually smiling, “Then by the powers vested in me, I now declare you all husbands, partners, and friends.  Now put on the rings, kiss each other stupid, and let’s eat!”
“You’re gonna be a part of this group hug, whether you like it or not,” Steven cheekily stated.
“Well

John and Bucky were panting, and Steve, though not as exhausted, was clearly breathing heavily in between his laughter.

in the background.  Molly lay her head against Logan’s broad chest and Logan returned a rare smile of peace.
Still, if Steven and John noticed that Bucky patted Sherlock’s arm appreciatively and that Sherlock squeezed Bucky’s shoulder as thanks, neither of them commented on it.
“And do you, James Buchanan Barnes, take Steven Grant Rogers, as your husband, partner, and will always be with him until the end of the line?  For better and for worse, until you both are wrinkled old men – well,
“Am I imagining things, or is that a cellphone shoved up Moriarty’s - ?” Sally asked.
“So does this mean we’re all friends now?”
“I am Groot?”
“He’s blinking in Morse Code…” Dawson whispered urgently in John’s right ear.

Bucky’s eye twitched.
Goofy, with Basil and Dawson on his left and right shoulders (respectively) seemed confused at the fact that Lestrade (as well as everyone around them and the people watching this on the news) was gaping at him like a fish, one eyebrow twitching ever so slightly.  Goofy cocked his head to the side.
Baymax queried dutifully, “On a scale of one to ten, how would you rate your pain, Sherlock?”
“Can Mycroft confirm this?” Anderson asked as Anthea moved down five foot soldiers with her M4 submachine-gun, causing two to explode safely in the distance, far from any bystander.  The look of self-doubting insecurity on the PA’s face was
It was then that Steve’s suppression collar and the timers on the Semtex explosives began to blink erratically…
At the same time, Sherlock tightened the muscles of his neck instinctively and moved his head and twisted to his left as far as he could.  The sudden movement away from his knife as well as John’s puzzling code word made the Sheriff blink.
“Bullets have no effect, sir!” Donovan reported on her police radio, her face grim though determined as she shot one Heartless directly into the forehead, only for it to stop and falter before dancing onwards madly with its weapon as if nothing has occurred.

“Going somewhere,
Definite broken rib…
“Let me guess: the car Bucky stole belongs to Greg?”
“It’s…both of our phones.  But I never programmed a ringtone,” the ex-Hydra soldier stated slowly, feeling sick.
Surprisingly, both Goofy and Sherlock asked the same question simultaneously.
Sherlock’s smug look melted in shock as the implication hit him.
“We do not need to inform you three the severe consequences if you try to tell the populace the real truth of what happened here,” Mycroft added securely.
Jim Hawkins actually blinked at that.
“Don’t talk, Sherlock,” John muttered tightly, his left hand trembling ever so slightly.
Another picture then popped up on screen.
You bit me!
All whom were watching on their televisions, phones (and in Mycroft’s case, the CCTV) were taken by complete surprise at the unexpected luminosity.
The final syllable was rather screamed at the top of Bucky’s lungs as he toppled over the railing and landed ungracefully on his back after plummeting below two stories, the mud cushioning his fall (thanks to Sherlock shoving him off the roof).
His loyal legions of Elephants, Rhinoceroses, and Rats were all injured, dead, or fleeing for their cowardly lives…
“His medallion is different…” Basil noted in John’s left.
“Intriguing…” Sherlock couldn’t help but whisper with troubled eyes, only to be furiously dragged down to the pavement by Lestrade as he tugged hard on Sherlock’s Belstaff.
“You’re mine now, you Consulting Crapsack!” Bucky snarled as he was now straddling and crushing Sherlock on the floor, sitting actually on top of the detective as he repeatedly wailed on Sherlock over and over.
Dimmock’s mouth was in a thin line, lips pressed tightly as he continued to stare with wide eyes and a sickly expression, sweat beading his brow.  As much as he wanted to maintain his dignity of not getting queasy, he couldn’t stop staring, unable to take his riveted eyes away from the biological trainwreck.
Why should be feel ashamed?
will get hurt given how the Chief is screaming in Bucky’s face right now,” John emphasized as they both continued to watch the proverbial trainwreck below.
Groot blinked as Steven and John hurriedly rushed out of the flat.
This required scotch.
That was absolutely the last straw.
“Your art of Sherlock and John makes everyone’s day a little brighter.  You bring happiness and lessen the gloom and sadness whenever you show your gifts to complete strangers, just to cheer people up during difficult times.  As a fellow artist myself, I greatly admire that sort of sunny compassion,” Steve described.
“I believe having someone attempt to ruin our son’s wedding may have something to do with that, Molly,” Mr. Holmes sighed as he rubbed his eyes.
“…You…
Mycroft was actually silent for a few seconds before he closed his eyes and inhaled and then exhaled deeply, wearily.

The sudden detonations and the faint tremors in the ground indicated that Yo-Yo found a useful place to put the Semtex.
Molly Hooper held her elbows so tightly, her fingernails dug into her skin.
John chuckled as he translated, “Groot says he admires someone who stands for others, for the disfranchised, for the outcasts, for the misfits and screw-ups like he and Rocket.  He says he loves your encouraging discussions about asexuality and how you help others not feel alone, like a part of a family, like he and the other Guardians feel for each other.”
“Some people need not a perfect soldier, but a good man…” Steve continued.
Sally now definitely could say she hated Mycroft more than Sherlock at that point on.
Without even comprehending it, John slowly took Sherlock’s bruised hand in his.
“Really? Golly gee, how could I have been
Mycroft Holmes faintly heard the screams of pain from Crossbones outside before his howling was cut off promptly with an explosion.
