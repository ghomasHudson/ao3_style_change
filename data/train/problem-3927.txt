"Then, where the fuck is she? Who the fuck did you marry and grow old with and have a kid with, Sam?"
He was hyper-aware of the end of June approaching. He knew it was coming, Indy had a pretty big celebration, and he made sure to be working all day that day so he wouldn't have to face it.
The first time he hummed along, Dean reached over and laid his arm on the back of the seat, running his fingers through the strands at the nape of Cas's neck for a while. The second time, he placed his upturned hand on the seat and didn't have to wait long before Cas's hand snaked its way into it. The third time, Dean couldn't take the whole reaching over thing anymore, and tugged Cas's arm so he'd scoot closer. He planted his hand on Cas's thigh, and Cas rested his own hand on top of it. They stayed like that the whole ride back, only interrupted by Dean bringing Cas's hand up to his lips, or the other way around.
Dean nodded, looking around as Sam, Cas, Eileen, and Jack said hi to everyone. A damn family alright.
Well, he means to. Instead, he takes out the duffle from the closet, puts it on the bed, and sits next to it for a while. An hour goes by. He thinks back to all those times he had brushes with one of these things and was just never in the right mindset. He’s not even sure he’s in the right mindset now, but he’s going. It’s happening.
Dean is now 42 years old and the happiest he’s ever been. The love of his life? Cas? Turns out he’s felt the same way all along. They're kind of together now, and slowly but surely they’re working through a decade’s worth of shit.
And that has Cas laughing in earnest. At the sound of her name, Honey came bouncing back, settling next to Dean on the couch.
"Sam thinks I'm gone for good, Cas. Maybe he'll get a nice surprise. If not, he'll burn me and move on with his life. But I know my brother, and no matter what, he'll be fine."
“Jack’s all ready to go,” Cas says when he walks in. “We spent about half an hour putting together an outfit for Saturday. He wanted it to be as colorful as possible.”
Before that train of thought gets away from him again, Dean tears his gaze away and stretches. “We should really go to bed though, I’m not getting any more done tonight,” he says as he stands.
Cas sees the struggle, knows what Dean is trying to say. He knows Dean, knows him down to the molecular structure of his being, down to the radiance of his soul. He takes Dean’s hand where he’s holding it at the wrist and brings it up to his lips, laying a soft kiss on his palm.
“You said you love me,” he says. And despite the constant beeping sound next to him, it’s at that moment that Cas feels his heart begin to beat again.
He gets to his room and changes into something comfortable, the first t-shirt and sweatpants he finds as he rummages in the dark. He goes to set his phone on his nightstand and crawl into bed, but in place of the book he keeps there and puts his phone on top of– the book Cas has at the moment– he finds something else.
"Thank you, Dean," Cas says, sitting down opposite him. Dean smiles again, this time shaking his head.
Cas swivels so Dean can see Jack's face now. Up close, it's incredibly clear that it's him, an uncanny resemblance to his dad and big blue eyes that find his.
Then Dean remembered how his heart sped up, how his ears got hot, and how for a second he let himself think the cashier was kinda cute too. He realized he must also be sick in the head, and the thought was making him feel actually, physically sick. He felt like throwing up. Dad could never know.
“I love you,” he said, low and hoarse like a prayer, as he rested his forehead on top of Dean’s, breaths mingling together and eyelashes brushing against each other. “Happy birthday, Dean.”
Dean's mind goes blank. He puts down his beer, blinks slowly, licks his lips, and fully turns toward his brother.
“Two years ago tonight, I was leaving my night course at the university, and it was raining. Not as bad as this,” –Cas looks out the window and lightning strikes, as if on cue– “but pretty badly, and I was an inexperienced freshman without an umbrella.”
The guy’s features softened a bit. He seemed to understand something about Dean that so far Dean refused to acknowledge.
Dean feels his brain catching up now as the memory starts coming back to him. Cas helps, starting to recount that night.
He pulls away, takes Cas's face in his hands, looks up at him like he's his religion. And he kind of is. He looks as beautiful as ever; striking eyes adorned with wrinkles, messed up hair (this time by his own hands), perpetually chapped lips. They move as Cas asks: "Dean, what are you doing here?"
But years of pretending to be a false version of yourself in an effort to please a man who was impossible to please wasn’t exactly an easy habit to break. As much as he wished it didn't, as much as he wished he could just exist, the thought of anyone finding out still made him sick to the stomach.
Dean is silent for four blocks and two traffic lights. He intermittently tightens and loosens his fists on the steering wheel, making the leather crackle. Castiel pokes his toes against the tight confines of his sneakers as he waits.
“Okay, good, that’s—that’s good.” Sam smiled, looking distant for a moment before blinking back into reality. “So… okay. Eileen. She found a news article dated a couple of days ago reporting a forest fire in Ocala National Forest. In Florida.”
“Thanks!” Faith flops to the seat beside Dean, making the metal shake. “I tried to find May, but she’s nowhere. Bob too. We said we’d meet on the south side, but I didn’t see them.”
“Well, yeah.” Dean puts his hands in his pockets and shrugs. “If it leads to more than that, fine. If it doesn’t, that’s fine too. Doesn’t have to like, be a big thing.”
“Yeah, I’m an angel,” Gabriel said, smoothly spilling his pile of salty-sugary treats on the table. “And no, I’m not like the others.”
Cas rolls his eyes but looks mildly proud of himself—until his eyes flicker past Dean’s shoulder, expression melting into terrified.
“Listen,” Sam says, pushing Dean’s hand off his arm, “this was never going to work unless we blended in somehow, right? This was going to be a plan I proposed anyway, it just ended up… getting ahead of me.”
“Then what did you mean? Is this the conversation where you tell me to leave you alone and get out of your life, just like you were all of last week?”
It’s Dean’s naturally awkward nature that has him continuing, “It’s not like I don’t mind being admired, I guess, it’s just—”
Sam’s shaggy head pokes around a bookshelf, where he stands taller than usual on a stepladder. “What did Dad do this time?” he asks.
Sam watched them, his face drawn with exhaustion and worry. When Dean met his eye, he nodded gratefully.
She loved this weather. She loved the holiday that came with the snow. She loved throwing snowballs at Castiel, even in her sullen teenage years, and laughing when snow stuck to his eyebrows.
Dean props his hip against the counter as he pours the coffee in a to-go cup. He squints out the window, at the quiet street and mailman walking past. “So, you having a good semester?” he asks to fill the silence. The silence continues, so he turns his head. “Cas?”
They stand for endless moments in the sunshine, their mouths softly moving against each other—Dean’s stomach is turning, but now in leaps and jumps of joy.
Dean rolled his eyes toward the ceiling. The little shit. Clearing his throat, he stepped through the doorway. Jack turned a startled gaze toward him as Dean patted his shoulder.
Sitting on the ground next to him, Dean wraps a careful arm around Cas’ stiff shoulders. Even though his voice didn’t reveal it, his body is less secretive—Cas’ muscles are taut with stress and he’s minutely shivering at Dean’s touch. “Cas,” Dean says softly. When Cas turns to look at him with distressed eyes, Dean continues, “It was just a nightmare.”
“There’s nothing wrong with wanting something—or someone—different than your soulmate. If your father and I’s failed marriage teaches you anything, then let it be that.”
“Yeah, okay,” Dean said, patting Jack’s back. He raised an eyebrow at Cas’s smug and satisfied smile as he leaned back against the headboard, sipping at his coffee. “You’re doing good, kid. Just remember that.”
“Hell yeah, why not?” Jody sat into the couch opposite from the dining table, giving the seat next to her a pat. “I’ll call Donna and Patience, put them on speakerphone so they can hear this too.”
“What?” Dean laughs, slapping Cas on the shoulder. Cas is trying to hide a grin. “Uneventful, my ass. What’s the promotion?”
It clicked, in that moment. Sam knows now that he should have said something; should have told Cas to take another moment to just… think about it.
Dean resolutely ignores the fuzzy feeling in his chest that the contact gives him. “Maybe you’ll remember when you’re sober, buddy.”
Cas’ shoulders slump. He nods; sighs, almost in relief. “Thank you, Dean.” He finally takes a bite of pasta.
Castiel leans against the door and slowly slides to the ground. Distantly, in the kitchen, he can hear something slam against the wall. He pulls his knees up to his chest and buries his face into his hands.
“No ‘m not.” Dean began walking toward the man in the corner, smacking himself on the cheek to focus. “And you’re dead, so shuddup.” A member of the bachelorette party turned her head to give Dean an alarmed look. Dean tried to shoot her a finger-gun, and ended up tripping over the leg of a chair instead.
Ripping the blade of grass in his hands, Dean let it drift to the ground. His knees cracked as he stretched his legs out. “Cas was the one that showed me this spot, you know.”
Cas’ heart twinges as he realizes this is the first time Dean has acknowledged his presence. “Perhaps,” he says, eyes flickering away, “but strong evidence points to it.”
Cas hears Sam’s long-suffering sigh on the other end. “There’s been another killing here. Is Cas by you?”
“‘Victim has multiple puncture wounds on neck, a half inch apart,’” Sam reads aloud. “‘Victim’s blood found on the neck.’”
Dean blinks at Cas. Breathes in a sharp gasp. He points accusingly to the green-covered book, the one he recognized earlier. “Hey—that’s Sam’s!”
They lay there in silence for a few breaths. Dean's hand continues to make patterns across Cas' back. Cas’s fingers stroke comforting paths through his hair, and Dean feels his eyes slowly droop as he falls back into sleep.
Jody showed Eileen to a free laptop, then turned to grin at the Winchesters. “So, what do you think of our makeshift headquarters?”
Castiel walks beside the stretcher as they wheel Dean out of the building; Castiel can tell that Dean is pretty hurt since he barely protests to the special treatment.
Dean thinks that he can count this as one of those bad times (having to take care of a drunk father who harasses his mother). Ergo, a date with the ultimate ‘pretty girl’—his soulmate.
“Well, wonderful!” May says, not skipping a beat. “I just got Cas’ phone number, so we’ll be in touch. Happy grocery shopping!”
Not when your success with this mission is the only thing keeping me from ripping out your grace and banishing you to Earth myself.”
“Perhaps. Although my impression of this monster is that it’s calculated. It hasn’t made a wrong move yet, and it’s even tried to deceive hunters as to what it is.” At Dean’s questioning look, Cas raises his eyebrows. “Think about it: the fake vampire bites on the last victim’s skin, the supposed psychic attack on you. It seems to want us to think everything that it might be, but in fact isn’t.”
Naomi trails a finger over the mentioned object, her eyes not leaving Castiel’s. “That’s your opinion, is it?”
Standing, Sam held up his hand toward Dean, as if that would stave off his anger. “Jack. What happened?”
“Jack,” Cas said firmly. He placed a hand on Jack’s arm, shaking his head. “Thank you for offering, but—don’t go down that road. You’re a child. It’s my job to take care of you; not the other way around. God or not.”
“Gabriel and I need to observe the portal, and I’m going to try and locate where the Empty is keeping Castiel,” Jack said calmly. “Then we can plan on how to proceed.”
“But just in case,” Cas says, tucking the knife in his own waistband. They both descend the stairs quietly, avoiding the windows. Dean gestures for Cas to hide behind the door; once Cas is flattened into a defensive pose on the other side of the door, he swings it open.
“Hang on.” Dean grabs the paper from Cas, holding it closer to his face. “‘Obviously monsters that hunt in romantic pairs’? Why did you write that next to our names?”
“Okay, well, everything else makes sense,” Sam continues. “When they bite, they release venom, and it paralyzes and eventually kills the victim. Maybe the Vetala in your area keeps getting interrupted in their kills for some reason, and can’t finish the job.”
“You can try to put me back in my mind,” Cas tells her. He holds his gun higher. Begins to advance toward her, slowly. “You can try to feed on me again, trap me. But I’m just going to keep trying to kill you.”
“I’m glad I can help things,” Cas says in his all-too-familiar fashion, sounding detached but somehow packing each word with emotional tenderness.
John grabbed Dean by the scruff of his neck and lead him outside. He shoved him against George’s truck and asked, deathly soft, “What happened in there, Dean?”
Dean returns to the teacher’s lounge, defeated. He is throwing his bag and lunchbox onto the table to put his head in his hands when he hears a familiar gravelly voice.
Dean stares at him for a moment longer before tilting his head to the ceiling, sighing again. “Will you get that look off your face if I make you some food?”
“Okay, you goddamn monster,” Bob hisses, pushing Dean forward. “You and your partner, or whatever the fuck you call each other, are both gonna die, but I’ll give you the option for him to die slowly or quickly. You just gotta put the gun down.”
“Son of a bitch is too nice for his own good,” Dean grumbles, trying hard to keep the tides of emotion blank from his face and out of his scratchy voice. He tries to quell panic rising in his throat. His connection with Lisa is far from ‘successful’—they’re just going on dates, barely getting past first base, for shit’s sake. What if Heaven thought that Cas’ progress in this job’s too slow? What if the angels got impatient and he’s in Heaven against his will right now, in pain or scared or—
clear to you. I oversee the rest of your miserable life. I’m not blind to how you’ve been treating Dean Winchester; you don’t think I’ve had people watching you two?” She waves a finger in his face mockingly. “Naughty, Castiel, getting too close to a human again. Leave it to you to make it in the most blasphemous way.”
Dean pulled back, his gun in the air. With a sharp jab, he whipped the pistol across Chuck’s face. Chuck cried out, holding his nose, dropping to the ground.
, Castiel’s traitorous mind supplies, “—cares about you. You are selfless, and constantly put others above yourself. And you are doing the best you can with your father’s situation. All right?”
“Yeah.” Dean taps the sink impatiently with his fingers. “You should have come in the summer. It’s ugly right now.”
A new surprise tag is going to be added when I post chapter 3... it may or may not have to do with Dean's profession... *blows a kiss and runs away*
“A shelter.” Cas picks up a bag of grapes, brow crinkling. “I think I like these.” He deposits them in the cart.
hunt, Dean, despite your doubts and reservations. I’ve improved over the past year.” He sighs audibly as Dean opens his mouth, adding, “I know, I know. Rule Number Two. I won’t mention it again.”
So Sam sat in the motel, as he always did when Dean went off with Danny, sulking and kicking his feet against the wall as he watched cartoons on the bed. When John got home and asked where Dean was, Sam didn’t understand why his pouty reply of “He’s with Danny, hunting a stupid monster”, made John rush right out of the motel room and get Danny’s dad.
Damn guys, i'm emotional. This is the second to last chapter, but since the epilogue is just a special bonus, for all intents and purposes the plot is done after this chapter. I decided to just post it as quickly as possible so I don't get all sad about this verse ending.
Their shoulders brush as they walk along the path. Sunlight catches the tiny ripples of the lake, sparkling in Cas’ eyes. He shields them as he looks out over the water.
Bob narrows his eyes; sighs. “Fine. Jesus. If it’ll make you feel better, we’ll set up the goddamn perimeter.” He jerks his head at May. “You find Faith and sit with her, but stay close to the exit. The concession stand is close to the back of the bleachers, so I’ll hang around there.”
And it’s strange, now that Sam looks back at it. There was no epic journey, no long road to complete where it was all going. No way for any of them to reconcile what was going to happen. Cas simply saw the future he would have—a future without Dean—if he did nothing, and he acted.
“I know the feeling,” Castiel says with a sigh. He leans into Dean’s lips as they move to his neck, gently mouthing the skin behind his ear—
He was assigned to Dean Winchester approximately two weeks ago. What Castiel originally thought was going to be a low-key assignment, protecting Lawrence’s newly-appointed councilman is turning out to be one of his more difficult cases.
He sent an application for an available house to rent in the same breath that he sent a move-out notice to Frank.
thank you all SO MUCH for your comments, feedback, screaming on my tumblr... i appreciate every single one of you. i really hope to see you all in the next installment of the fic, whenever i post that. ETA is a bit hazy right now - I'm working on another destiel au and an original fic right now (hoping to publish a gay ghost novel in the future eeee), but my hope is that I'll be able to work on this sequel in the next few months.
Last night, the trees loomed sad and ominous, but today the branches waved cheerfully over Dean’s head, illuminated by the pink dawn. He clumsily wound around them as before, cursing, but this time with a newfound determination. Once he got to the cave, he would immediately start to look for more evidence of the Empty. There had to be more of it somewhere in there. Charlie could research some stuff on the dark web, get answers—Dean broke a tree branch in his path—to see if anyone had seen other things like this, if maybe—
“Cas.” Lower, this time. “I, uh—I dunno if you can hear me. I don’t know if you heard me all those other times, but… if you did, and you’re wondering why I quit all those weeks ago, well, I—I’m sorry about that. Hard to yell up a mountain if all you’re getting back is your echo, ya know?” He laughed; it fell flat. “But, uh. If you
“I’ve been an ass,” Dean says, “and I would understand if you don’t want to. But honestly, Cas, I want you around.”
Dean shrugs off the hand Sam puts on his shoulder. He tugs on his jacket and kicks Sam’s overnight bag out of the doorway. “We can start with Faith’s street.”
He grabs Cas into a hug; puts a hand against the back of his neck. Feels him alive and breathing against him. “You’re okay?”
Dean groaned and pushed himself up to sit. He was still on the floor, where he had drunk himself senseless last night. With a snap of Gabriel’s fingers, the lights in the bedroom burst to life, burning Dean’s retinas.
Something in his stomach clenched. His legs were unsteady as he crossed the room, leaning against the counter next to her. He held out an arm as an invitation. With a sharp sniff, Claire ducked into his side, burying her face into his shoulder.
he acted like a looney toon the whole time. It wasn’t Cas. And what happened, when I saw him….” Dean stopped mid-sentence, glaring at the floor. “It doesn’t matter, okay? Whatever crazy shit happened in that future, it didn’t mean anything.”
, he wants to say, but of course his voice won’t utter the words. All he can do is nod, squeezing his eyes shut.
“And, hey, uh—” Dean tilted his head toward Sam, lowering his voice. “Keep an eye on that guy, will ya? I’m sure you already know this, but he gets anxious easily. Gets stomach problems because of it, and that shit ain’t pretty, if you catch my drift.”
So it’s not like he outright wanted the notes to stop, but after that day of complaining about them, they stop coming.
Dean shakes his head and huffs out a laugh. At Cas' confused look, he says, "Cas, I can't believe how badass and brave you are. If all that shit happened to me I would be in a straightjacket laughing at the fairies somewhere."
Once he and Sam meet up again, Dean’s discouraged and pissed. At Sam’s empty shake of his head, his mood plummets further.
Anna’s voice, sharp and short, breaks off Dean’s frantic rambling. “Dean. He’s lost his grace. He can’t hear you. He has to heal.”
Cas stares for a moment, then seems to snap out of it. He takes a breath, then takes his tea. “No,” he says simply before walking out of the library.
Reaching down, Dean holds Cas’ face and pushes his finger against Cas’ jaw, clicking it shut. “You done being ridiculous?” he asks.
attempting to post this with half my cat's butt on the keyboard. it's a difficult task. please blame him for any typos.
“Nice to meet you,” Dean says, because it’s friendly, even when it’s not quite the truth. Bob’s handshake feels like it could break bone. He pulls away hastily.
Never cold if I’m next to you, angel, Dean would say. Cas’s nose would wrinkle as he gave him that gummy smile.
“No, Dean, I’m not blaming you. I…” He raises his gaze to Dean. “Do you remember the night that local band played at your bar? It was with Charlie, Anna, Gabriel…”
Mary puts a hand over Dean’s; her wristwatch brushes cool against his skin. “Dean, let’s be honest. The concept of soulmates is flawed. If you are feeling stronger feelings for someone else, well, you shouldn’t ignore them out of obligation.” She withdraws her hand, absentmindedly rubbing her wrist with a frown. “But, keep in mind Castiel is an angel. He’s practically another species. I don’t want to see you get hurt; there aren’t a lot of documented cases about angels falling in love with humans. It’s likely that these feelings are unreciprocated.”
Shakily withdrawing his cell phone from his jeans pocket, he dials and waits patiently for Anna’s pleasant greeting on the other line.
“Meaning now you can be on the tenure track?” At Cas’ nod, Dean laughs again. “Dude, that’s awesome! Remember how much you were freaking out about finding a job after grad school?”
To Castiel, it’s a loaded question. He knows what the appropriate answer is. But he knows what the real answer is, as well. The more complicated and sticky answer that calls to a larger problem and situation. “I’m indifferent to them,” he finally settles on saying, taking the advantage of a gap between cars to cross the street.
When he hits the warm air in Dean’s house, he immediately begins shaking. Or, maybe he was shaking before but didn’t notice. He’s not sure. For the countless time that day he’s frustrated with his lack of grace.
Dean pulled at the bonds that burned his wrists, mouth wide and yelling with a voice he no longer had. He grasped around his head for Cas’s voice, anything, but nothing responded.
his brain keeps shouting at him. It’s in a loop, carouseling in his brain, making it hard to listen to Cas when he asks him a question.
Sam goes silent on the other line, an indication that he’s finally caught onto Cas’ fragmented conversation.
“Well, I’m in the business of getting things done.” Gabriel patted Dean’s head. “Had a hard night, did we?”
He lets the silence seep between them; lets the cicadas fill the space. Taking Cas’ arm, he turns him around. Cas relents and swings his legs over the porch railing, legs dangling, facing Dean.
Dean licked his lips. Admitted softly, “I…I um. Had a panic attack yesterday. In the bathroom, while you were sitting with Gabriel and Jack.”
“Yeah, well...” Dean grabbed Miracle’s leash hanging on a hook by the door, attaching it to the collar. He finally turned to Sam, his brother’s pinched and worried face frowning up at him. “Get used to it.”
I can't believe this is done I am actually getting emotional OKAY so guys. from the bottom of my heart. whether you commented on every chapter, or if you've been silently following this story, or you've just jumped on board to read the epilogue - HOWEVER you're reading my work, thank you, so much. my heart literally soars when i get a comment, or someone leaves a kudo, or i see someone else subscribing to my work. I can't believe how many of you have gone on this journey of me writing my first (!!) full-length fanfic. So seriously, thank you. If I could invite you all to my house and make you a huge meal and give you lots of cookies, I totally would. I wish there was a way I could properly thank each and every one of you.
It’s well into nightfall, and whoever premeditated this had closed the curtains, making the house nearly pitch black. “Fuck,” he growls, reaching around for Cas, who is no longer there. “Cas!” Keeping his gun at chest-level, he shuffles to where he remembers the kitchen light being and fruitlessly flicks it back and forth. “Goddamn it—Cas! Where are you?”
When someone rejects their soulmate, they are either a sociopath or clinically insane. Castiel expected a man with a twisted soul, or one that could barely function at all; but instead he sees a soul so bright, that even with his depleted grace, it causes him to squint.
The fundraiser is a school-wide effort to raise money for scholarships. Based on her begrudging involvement in Key Club (the organization hosting the damn fundraiser in the first place) and her consistently good grades, she’s hoping that she has at least a small chance of getting one of them. It’s that small chance that makes her not complain about doing this face-painting booth in the first place.
“If I lost Eileen again,” Sam said, softly. “Now, after everything we’ve… realized about each other, how we feel about each other… It would hurt more. Even more so than the first time she died.”
The pub has a good enough vibe for a Saturday night; it’s just far from Dean’s style. For one, he had a horrible experience on St. Patrick’s Day in this very place that involved a very rambunctious date and green glitter being thrown around by equally rambunctious patrons; he was finding glitter in his hair and clothes for days. He tells Lisa this, as they’re being seated at their booth. It earns him a delicate, tinkling laugh and breaks some of the tension.
“Better. Awful.” Dean makes an attempt to reach for his boot and pull it off; Cas bats his hands away and does it for him.
“We check the room, then we go to him,” Dean whispers harshly. His instruction is more to himself than Sam.
She sighs. “So, I’m trying to help him out. Despite everything, he’s still my soulmate, and we connect better than anyone else could with each other. As someone who cares about him, I’m trying to step in to get him to rehab.” Mary looks at Dean with an air of sympathy. “He knows how much you help him; how much of a burden of it is on you. He wants you to be able to go day by day without worrying about him; he wants you to start a family without his alcoholism being a shadow.” She lays a hand over Dean’s. “He does have moments of sobriety; moments that he knows how much it’s affecting you.”
“Maybe I should read it sometime,” Dean says by Castiel’s ear. His breath tickles the nape of his neck and produces shivers up and down his spine.
Dean is lying on the couch when Cas returns, files from the morgue propped onto his stomach, an empty coffee mug on the ground. Without looking at Cas, he asks, “Learn anything?”
“I see.” She pauses, looking down at the water dripping from the loosely shut off faucet. “Can you answer me one thing?”
Castiel remains a silent observer throughout dinner. No one seems to mind or acknowledge it. Jess talks about the new shift schedule that the hospital has assigned to her and other nurses and how it’s causing people to rumble about a possible strike. Sam describes his new case to them—a nearby forest that he’s fighting to preserve—and the new building that they are moving his law firm to.
“Done,” Dean announces. His hands leave Castiel’s; Castiel feels the absence of them immediately. “So, just one date with Lisa, huh?”
“I forgot those were even in there,” Dean murmurs, almost to himself, as he turns into his driveway. He shifts his car into park and turns to Castiel. “Do you like burgers?”
Dean stands abruptly, legs knocking against the table, making Charlie jump back in surprise. “I need to find him,” he says, rushed. “After school. I’m going to find him. Can you talk to Anna about this? Maybe she can help.”
“Awfully considerate of you, Cas.” Dean is now rolling the bandage around Castiel’s palm, applying firm but painless pressure. His other hand is carefully cupping Castiel’s wrist; once again, Castiel is distracted by the brush of Dean’s fingertips against his skin.
“You said she was psychic,” Sam says. “Maybe there was a way that she messed with your head. Prevented you from hearing it.”
She throws exasperated hands into the air. “I don’t know, Castiel, you’ve been stupider in the past!”
Adjusting himself in the stool, he clears his throat. “I keep getting drawn back to one passage in particular,” Cas says. “‘The cost of a thing is the amount of what I call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run.’ If you remember that quote.”
The thread floated in front of him in the still, freezing water. Lungs burning, chest aching, Dean grabbed it, frantically kicking his legs and flailing his arms, desperate for the surface.
The fall air has gotten crisper in the last half-hour since Dean has left it. He breathes in sharply, letting the cold shock his senses. The crushing feeling in his chest has subsided, now that he’s not in the same room as Cas.
Cas, who can’t help the fact that he’s smart and adorable and scrunches his nose endearingly when he’s confused—who can’t help the fact that Dean is hopelessly in love with him.
“I’m sure that I'm better at stitching than you,” Dean retorted. It was only the brief vulnerability in his eyes that made Sam relent. He stood up, letting Dean bend in front of Cas in his place.
Cas was a grumpy patient. He didn’t like taking the vitamins that Sam shoved at him, or the vegetables that Jody kept roasting for him. And Dean didn’t miss the hint of murderous intent in Cas’s eyes when Dean kept forcing him to drink water every hour.
It was still light enough to see the group of kids from before, staring at Dean in shock as he stumbled out of the cave. “Don’t go in there,” he barked at them, slicing a hand in the air. “You hear me? Go home.”
Shrugging, she cleans up her table, getting ready for the next round of people. Even though she can’t explain all these things, she feels an undeniable warmth in her chest for the rest of the day.
“I’m not saying what you did was wrong. You just broke a lot of angelic laws to get there. And that pisses angels with a stick up their butt off. Like Naomi, for example,” Anna grins, lightly punching him in the shoulder. “This is actually a nice change from you strictly following the rules. Was beginning to think that my rebellious friend Castiel had left for good.”
“Oh, I’m done planning,” Dean snaps. He pats the outline of his gun under his jacket. “We’re going there armed to the teeth and ganking that bitch.”
Over the past few days, Castiel has tried to go back to Dean’s house, multiple times. Some mornings he got as far as almost turning down Dean’s street, glimpsing his canary yellow house just a block down. But, every time, his feet developed a mind of their own and carried him as far away as possible.
“I wish I had time to lay it all out for you, but that thing’s gonna be back any minute and rip your guts out, so—” Gabriel placed a hand on Dean’s shoulder, “do you trust me?”
“You carried it around with you all the while I was gone, Dean. Don’t pretend that it didn’t hurt you, irrevocably—”
“Well,” Claire said, smacking her knees. “That’s my cue. Gonna go see if Kaia’s back with that McDonald’s.” She stood, gesturing not-very-subtly to Jack, who looked confused, but followed her out of the door nonetheless.
Dean considers. He looks down at the frayed, yellowed paper. It’s been twenty years. It’s likely that the number is disconnected, or belongs to someone else.
He sees Dean and Lisa laughing with each other over burgers (Dean’s favorite food; he must be pleased that his soulmate has the same taste as him). Dean’s smile becomes more genuine with each passing word, each smile, each flirtatious graze of Lisa’s hand over his arm.
“Don’t want to talk about it.” He leans a hip against the counter, avoiding Castiel’s eyes as he takes a long gulp of beer. His countenance is tired, and his smile has lost its usual shine.
“Yeah, well what about Heaven? And Naomi? Don’t we have to worry about those sons of bitches? What if they come back to get Cas, and finish the job? What if—”
The elementary school Dean works at is the stark contrast of Castiel’s university: cheerful, bright, and full of laughing little humans tripping through the halls. Castiel smiles at the cut-out music notes on Dean’s classroom’s door. He remembers helping Dean decorate his classroom in the summer; putting those music notes up and grumbling at the glue getting in his hair. But, secretly, Castiel loved every moment of decorating Dean’s kindergarten music classroom with ridiculous cut-outs and instruments.
know. You’ll never know. You don’t know what it’s like to extract the very essence of yourself and throw it away forever.”
“It’s fine now, okay? You’re back now. And—I’m okay. It was worth dealing with that crap, because you’re back.” Dean’s nails were biting into his palms now as he gripped his fists tight, and that splintering in his chest was back—the nightmares he had over the past few days rushing back at him, taunting him, filling him with fear that he’ll never be okay even with Cas back, that he was too broken, too scarred—
“I don’t know how to go back,” Castiel confessed softly. He knew that Anna understood what he meant: he can’t go back and watch Dean and Lisa fall in love. He can’t facilitate that connection for the next few days, or months, or years. It hurt too much. “You know how I feel about Dean. You know that I’ve only been pushing through this mission because of the small
Cas tucks his feet under his legs and places the book on his lap, pushing back his messy hair. Dean makes a note to buy him a damn brush, because the urge to push his fingers through Cas’ hair and fix it is just driving him crazy.
“I wasn’t excusing your father’s alcoholism, Dean, or his failures as a failure to you. I simply meant to say that I understand why his family’s absence has lead him to this. Without family, he needs ways to fill the void.”
There it was. They were finally circling the crux of the issue. Sam leaned forward. “What didn’t mean anything?” he asked softly.
“It’s a collection of essays,” Dean says, eyes alit in excitement, “that Thoreau wrote when he was out in the wilderness. It’s all about living off the land and depending on your own devices. He says that people were too materialistic—even back then, if you can believe it. After I read that, I tried camping on my own for a weekend, and living the way he suggested, away from civilization and all that jazz.”
Dean leans his head forward, eyebrow raised. “Did you say ‘observe’ me? What am I, a science experiment?”
Dean just seems to push into his father harder. “I put up with a lot of your bullshit,” he says in a harsh whisper. “I clean up your damn messes. But lay a hand on Cas again, and I’ll make sure you rot behind bars so you’ll never do it again.”
Cas crossed his arms. Nodded. “I wish we could have kept him at Jody’s. Flying here just exhausted him more.”
For shit’s sake. He retreats to the kitchen, letting his breakfast plate clatter noisily into the sink; anything to get some life into this room. In front of him, the bare birch tree’s branches are framed by the window as they sway slightly in the fall gale. Dean sneaks a look at Cas around his shoulder. He’s sitting at the table, despondently hanging his head low toward the blue checkered tablecloth.
Dean pulls into the driveway of his house; Castiel hadn’t even noticed their arrival. “Fine, be that way,” he mutters as he slams the car into park and angrily takes his keys out of the ignition.
Cas squeezes his eyes shut against the inevitable tidal wave of guilt. He came to this hunt with a very specific goal in mind: explain things to Dean. Try to right his wrongs. Now, after Dean made it very clear that he wants nothing to do with Cas’ explanations, it seems as if he never can.
@bekindplsrewind prompt: Found the phone number of an old childhood friend in some box at the back of the closet and decided to call it to see if it still worked AU.
“Goddammit.” Castiel pivots and swings through the bathroom door. He opens each empty stall. He does a useless circle around the empty bathroom.
If there was a way to feel Cas’s smile, he would have felt it right then. Lighting up his brain, like a ray of sunshine on his skin.
“Dean,” he says softly, tilting his face toward his. It’s enough for Dean to understand; he presses their lips together, tucking his arms against Cas’ back, pushes him into the bed.
His breathing still erratic, Dean lets Castiel lead him to the couch. Once Dean is sitting, staring aimlessly at the floor, Castiel turns over his palms and rolls up his sleeves to check for any injuries.
He takes the stairs that are down the hall from Dean’s office. His feet hitting the metal stairs echo sharply in the empty space. Striding through the lobby of the office building, he narrowly avoids connecting shoulders with a group of men who are walking quickly in the other direction.
Castiel nods, rubbing a hand over his cheek. Sitting this close, Dean can see the stubble from where Cas missed a spot shaving that morning. “Well, thank you for telling me that much.”
As he walks through the front door, he sees Dean and a blonde woman standing in the hallway, talking in fast and hushed tones.
Castiel has his hand on the knob, clenching it so hard it could shatter. “Whatever your opinion of me is; I hope you think about what I said.” He turns the knob sharply against the silence behind him, says, “I don’t want to see you get hurt,” before slamming the door behind him.
As he’s looking at Cas, that hug they shared a few nights ago flashes through his mind. How significant it felt; how
“I…” Castiel looks down at his feet, which are being kept warm by Dean’s wool socks. Another way that Dean is catering to him, despite the circumstances. He feels a pang of shame. “I haven’t always been a cupid. In fact, this is my first task as one.”
“But it’s going to.” Dean’s hands gripped Cas’s waist tighter. “You and me hunting again, goin’ out there…”
Continuing to skim his fingers through Castiel's hair, Dean says gently, "If you're bored of just lying there, I can read something to you."
“Guardian angels go where Heaven senses they need them,” Castiel replies, “but they leave just as soon if there is no need there.”
“Makes sense,” Dean says. He taps the papers beside him. “That info checks out; all the victims before this were either not very well-known and married, or recently divorced. Whoever is doing this is targeting people that wouldn’t be missed very quickly.”
“Whatever.” Dean snatches his beer from the table and stalks into the living room. “You’re just sappy and in love because you and Jess are newlyweds, therefore you have no stake in this argument.”
Dean chewed at his lip. The landslide could have been caused by whatever was going on in those rocks. “Anything weird happen before that?”
“My patience left the building four months ago,” Dean grumbled as he opened the creaky screen door. Vanilla, mingled with the smell of cinnamon, swam through the warm air as he stepped through the threshold.
“Oh, sure, Cas, no prob.” Dean looks up at Sam, who is gesticulating wildly, miming out a pen and paper like a crazy person. “Do you uh…”
“He helps me do the dishes every night. And he’s quiet. But he insists on following me everywhere, like a damn puppy. Apparently, Heaven told him to ‘observe’ me or something.” In fact, Dean’s surprised that Cas isn’t on this date now with him and Lisa, intently in Dean’s face and taking notes on his behavior.
Aloud, he says, “I can’t leave until I’ve completed my task successfully, or until I’ve explored every option to pair you with Lisa and they have all failed.”
Dean didn’t reply. He stared at the setting sun until his eyes watered. The hole in his chest howled.
“No, no. That was advice for a different time. For the job thing I told you to shut up and have a drink.”
Dean throws his arms in the air. “Jesus, Cas. Gimme anything, seriously. Anything to tell me I’m doing the right thing.”
“Jesus.” Sam ran a hand through his hair, laughing with no humor. “So you’re just going to run into the Empty with this half-baked plan. Nothing I say will even show you how
Patience, who had a phone to her ear, put a hand over the receiver to tell Sam, “I had a vision about demons attacking two people with red hair—sisters, I think, and they were hunters. I know it’s vague, but—”
Castiel frowns at Dean’s retreating back. He can only assume that the expression means that Dean wants him to leave. Castiel leans against the counter, contemplating the grout between the blue tiles. He knows that whether he and Dean like it or not, his job dictates that he stays with Dean until his job is complete: success or not.
Cas frowned at his hands. “The tear. It’s because of my grace. When the Empty threw me in here, it wanted to use me to explode the two worlds. Make it so that nothing would be left. But I created a shell. If I stay asleep, contain it, the tear won’t get bigger.” He shook his head, gritting his jaw. “If I wake up, it’ll be unstable. Everyone—Jack, Sam, Eileen…” A scared look passed over his face, and he glanced upwards. “They all could die.”
Cas walked out of the room, not even glancing at in the doorway. Dean followed him down the hallway, a hand outstretched.
“No,” Dean scoffs, guiltily looking at the loaf of cinnamon raisin bread that’s clutched in his hands.
Clearing his throat into his fist, Dean ventures, “But you know Cas, whatever bruises we gave each other, we got back on track. Right?”
They’re not due to meet Bob and May for another two hours, so Dean takes his time. He lets himself sit for a moment after springing the Impala to life, closing his eyes and smiling briefly at the familiar vibrations under his feet, the audible purr of her engine. He doesn’t even feel self-conscious when he sees Cas smiling at him.
“Cas wanted to get a present for Claire’s birthday,” Dean said, fingers tapping against the whiskey bottle, “so I took him to a mall. Turns out it was the first time he’d ever been in one. He was
“C’mon,” Dean instructs, hauling Cas to his feet by his arm. “I have time before my class starts. I’m takin’ you home.”
Dean attempts to be more gentlemanly when they get to the pub by opening the passenger door for her. He gets a strange look from her in return.
At Castiel’s nod, she asks, “Will Dean have a choice in this? If he doesn’t want to pair up with his soulmate in the end?” She looks at him imploringly. “Will he be able to keep his free will, when it comes down to it?”
“No, just…” Jack huffed out a laugh, shaking his head. “It was more like she was scolding me. Trying to convince me she knew more than I did. She knew, if I got back in control, that I’d just try to get Castiel again. Maybe even ask for your help doing it.” He spread his hands. “She told me there would be consequences if I tried to go to the Empty. And now Castiel is gone, and it’s leaking into Earth and… well, she was right.”
Jody pushed as much food at Dean as she could before strong-arming him into going upstairs for a few hours of sleep. There was nothing to pack; nothing to prepare. Dean paced the guest room with nervous energy, pulling at his hands. He could hear Sam snoring, predictably, in the next room where he and Eileen slept. Strangely, the familiar sound put Dean at ease, despite the fact that there’d been times in the past when he considered smothering Sam to put him out of his own misery.
“It’s how you feel purpose,” Cas agrees. “Your father doesn’t deserve your care. It’s my opinion, and probably the opinion of many others, that you distance yourself from him. But if you did, you wouldn’t be you.”
, general screaming in my DMs... every time you guys tell me a certain phrase that stuck with you, or a part of the fic you love, my heart grows ten times its size. thank you so much for making my day better <3
Something in Castiel’s chest splinters. “All right,” he snaps, the backs of his knees smacking the chair as he stands. “Message received. I’ll resign from protecting you, effective immediately. You won’t be hearing from me again.”
“’cause, I haven’t brought someone home like this in a while, you know? Well, possibly ever. And she’s nice, you know? She’s cute and the kind of girl you bring home to your parents. And I just… want to know what you think.”
“Not in the slightest,” the woman snaps back. “And I swear to God, if you hurt Bob, you’re going to wish you hadn’t.”
people I consider my parents. Losing Castiel—” He cut off, shaking his head. “I can’t do that again.”
and there was sounds like furniture was breaking, or something?” Dean scrubs his hands over his face, letting out a frustrated sound. “My goddamn stupid dad.”
“I’ve been thinking it too.” Cas gestures up the stairs with a nod of his head. “I think we should research under the assumption that there could be two monsters competing for the same victim pool. They may find this neighborhood a viable killing area.”
“I have little left. I need to conserve it for communicating with Heaven.” He feels Dean’s hand tighten around his wrist. He looks up at Dean’s eyes, which are pinched with concern.
“Yeah. Not my finest moment. And John was completely blindsided. I gave no indication of being unhappy, according to him.” She takes another grueling hot sip. “But I never kept him from you boys, not until the alcohol started inhibiting him. I always gave him full access, you remember, right?”
“Dean, what’s going on? Where are you?” He hears Dean’s voice again, but this time it’s not forming a word—more like a cry. The realization of what’s happening dumps over Castiel like cold water.
Dean shakes out his shoulders. Takes a breath. “Nothing. It just won’t work. You don’t know the whole story.”
fault you left, okay? I had something to do with it too. So let’s just… move on.” Dean rolls his eyes at Cas’ skeptically raised eyebrow. “As much as we can, anyway.”
Charlie scoffs. “When it comes to his love life, Dean’s one of the most private people I know. He doesn’t tell anyone anything around here. I’m one of his better friends, and not even
The countertop under his hands faded as Dean saw instead the blackness, engulfing Cas: first his torso, then working its way up to his face, those blue eyes burning brilliantly with tears getting swallowed up last, disappearing as Dean struggled to breathe—
.” He reaches out, clutches Dean’s arm. Dean doesn’t look back. Holding Dean by a metaphorical thread, he pulls against him, to stop him from going up the stairs with all his human, emotional strength. “I didn’t mean it. I don’t know what to say—when I feel this way. All I do is hurt you, when I try to explain and I—” He closes his eyes and tugs at Dean, harder. Dean still doesn’t look. “I need you to know that I don’t mean it that way.”
Castiel gives a small shrug. “There’s not much to discuss. We have existed for thousands of years, and I know everyone’s name. Each time a star explodes, another one of us is ‘born’, in human terms, so it is a bit hard to keep track of everyone.”
It’s the waking nightmare that had him staying up for hours in the bunker, staring at the ceiling, after Cas had left:the inability to do absolutely nothing to keep Cas alive and happy and whole.
Castiel rests his forehead against the door, shopping bags in his hands lightly hitting the pale wood. He squeezes his eyes shut and wills himself not to be upset that it’s the sixth day of the week that Lisa has been at their apartment.
“Dude, you aren’t going to find that out at my work,” Dean says incredulously. He’s already walking toward the building, as if he could outrun Castiel.
“What’s your favorite memory of him?” Sam had asked. It was a few weeks after Cas died, when Sam was deep in the mourning trenches with Dean. Eileen had gone to bed long ago, but Sam stayed up with Dean like he usually did those days, drinking with him at the war table.
The man’s eyes seem to light up at this; Dean’s not sure what triggered it, but he’s not complaining. “George Eliot is one of my favorite authors. It’s a good random choice.”
Dean huffed a breath through his nose, shaking his head, fist pressed to his forehead. The voice wasn’t real. It wasn’t even
Eileen glanced between them. She turned to Jody and inclined her head, both walking closer to the portal and away from the brothers. Dean let out a sharp, heavy breath as they left.
moment that Cas was human and staying in the bunker, and all the crap that went down from it. And I did the only thing I thought would help: contacting him.”
“Well, in a sense. I’m going to have to make some fireworks soon to draw the Empty over to me anyway.” Gabriel’s other hand came out from the dark, placing an angel blade into Dean’s palm. “Present from Jack. Dunno how the kid did it, but this is made of antimatter too, so it shouldn’t explode on you. Not sure how well it’ll work on anything in here, but—just in case.”
Claire hooked up her Nintendo Switch and cajoled Cas to try and play it. Jack sat on the other side of him, eyes wide at the screen, full of questions (what’s the point of this game? Why are we all cartoon characters? Why is the music so loud?).
Castiel carefully picks up the burger, the meat leaving behind a bleeding trail across the plate. “Then Heaven will try to assist the match through cupid interference. If someone doesn’t pair with their soulmate, it is assumed that the likely won’t be able to sustain relationships with anyone else.” He takes a bite into the burger and briefly closes his eyes at the rush of flavor.
Dean’s hands stilled. He carefully set the bowl down in the basin of the sink and turned. His voice was steady and cold as he asked, “Wanna run that by me again?”
Castiel says, with all sincerity, “It’s not in your personality to leave your father to his own devices. You’re too good of a man for that.”
The man bent over and picked up Dean by the collar of his shirt, face twisted in a rage that Dean successfully unleashed, his fist flying as he hit Dean over, and over, and over—
“We’re not alone this time,” Cas said firmly. “Sam and Eileen have already begun to build the hunter network. Jody and Donna, everyone there are always ready to help, and… we have each other.” He smiled, his hand cupping the back of Dean’s neck. “Without Chuck, we can pave our own path. Nothing is set in stone. The story isn’t written. That’s the difference.”
“I’m okay,” Cas says, putting his hand on top of Dean’s heart for him to hold, and Dean can breathe a little easier.
"'S alright." Dean rubs his face and sits up to at least take his shoes off, and Cas takes a single step back. "Thanks," he says, and he feels like it's nowhere near enough for what Cas just did, but he can't think of anything better so it'll have to do.
“Be careful, please!” Dean calls after them, but they pay him no mind. He turns to Charlie. “Hey, your majesty, keep an eye on them will you?”
) tired by the time the pie came around and the incredibly out of tune Happy Birthday chorus began. He was wearing two party hats at that point. Jack placed the pie in front of him, ‘HaPPy B-daY D!’ written in crust on top and Rice Krispy treats framing the plate. Dean sent Jack a knowing smile before reaching over to ruffle his hair in thanks.
"Sam, heh. Sam is smart as hell, but he wouldn't show off about it like that. And Sam wouldn't just abandon all those hunters who looked up to him. But most of all," He finally turns to the man. Not-Sam. "Sam, my Sam, wouldn't just
He wakes with a gasp, but no air enters his lungs. His eyes open, but all he sees is black. He sits up in a rush, but feels nothing holding him up.
Dean starts to let go of his hand and is about to tell him that the choice is his, because of course it is.
It’s paper. It’s folded into the form of a book, like one of those youtube craft tutorials with bad music, and it's no bigger than his own palm. The cover is handwritten, and Dean immediately recognizes it as Cas's. He smiles, expecting a prank or joke of some sort, Cas knows how stressed Dean can get with the start of the semester. However, his smile falters as he reads the cover:
–" Dean steps closer, taking Cas's hand in full, interlocking their fingers like he wanted to do back in the car and since always. "–to take off that stupid coat, and that stupid jacket, and those stupid shoes, and anything else that you want–"
It's then Cas remembered he was already dressed for the date, slacks and a white button-up (probably grossly stained, he hated to think), and pointed Dean to a drawer.
After so many years of living in the bunker, Dean was no longer wired to sleep only four hours a night out of necessity. He was also not a morning person, never had been, so most days he allowed himself the luxury of sleeping in.
Dean knew, at this point, that there was nothing wrong with being queer. It wasn’t anything to be ashamed of, and it sure as hell didn’t mean you were wrong in the head or whatever.
It’s only when she’s done that Dean is allowed into the room. He basically stumbles through the door, eyes desperate and glistening with unshed tears. He stands at the doorway for a long moment, tears threatening to spill as he surveys Cas on the bed. His hands fidget at his sides and his mouth is agape as if it’s trying and failing to form words.
He knows he wasn’t. He knows he wasn’t born to do any of the things he’s done or be what he is, an angel but not an angel, a soldier for the wrong army, a father, a friend, a man in love with a man. But he is, Cas is all these things, and even though he wasn’t born to kiss Dean, he certainly lives for it now.
“Two years ago,” Cas says, finally looking up at Dean. His eyes are wide and vulnerable and he looks terrified and Dean can barely stand it. “Two years ago tonight, I started to fall in love with you.”
At that, Dean just can't keep driving. He feels that sting in his eyes again and pulls over before the blur in his vision makes him miss a pothole and wakes up the kid.
"Hey! Hey, how you feeling?" Dean asks, rubbing the sleep from his eyes with the back of his hand. He put products in his hair for the date, Cas notices, because it's now stiffly and adorably messed up.
Thankfully they were at a red light, or else Dean probably would’ve slammed the breaks. He twisted to look at Sam head-on, his arm on the back of the seat.
He feels himself drifting off again and pushes himself off of Cas. He needs to change. He needs to fall into bed. He needs to sleep for at least a week.
He wasn’t expecting any of this, he didn’t think everything would change so fast. But when you spend the better part of your life pushing down such a huge part of you and then finally give yourself an out, a chance to show the people who love you who you really are, everything just... follows.
Dean was fifteen years old when he found out that being gay was something people could be proud of. It was early in the morning, they'd left their motel about 20 minutes before, and Sammy had fallen asleep in the backseat. The sun was just starting to completely show over the horizon, and they were driving through– or rather, struggling to get out of– Phoenix on their way to a possible poltergeist in Tucson. Every street they tried to take was blocked for the big event, and dozens of people already lined the sidewalks with colorful outfits and signs.
He wraps his hand around Cas's, gently guiding his fingers until they’re placed just right, and the lighter clicks on with ease. Cas meets his eyes, smiling, and Dean can feel the slightest brush of Cas’s thumb against his hand. It’s a small gesture, but clearly deliberate, and it sends Dean’s heart into overdrive. Cas leans away, puts the lighter aside, and starts leafing through a book he brought. Dean’s heart is still racing as he watches him.
But watching them that happy and comfortable, seeing not one, but two pairs of guys sloppily leaning against each other and sharing the occasional kiss while none of their friends seemed to bat an eye… something in Dean ached. Deeply.
and Dean will probably turn down his invite. If not for the hell he went through that night, then for Cas being insane.
The words still don’t materialize though, and his mouth is gaping again. Cas doesn’t stop him this time. He lets Dean try, and try, and try. Dean squeezes his shoulder tighter and scooches closer and moves his other hand down to the side of Cas’s neck and he keeps
Cas puts the book back down on the table in front of him and interlocks his fingers in front of him. He doesn’t look at Dean–
Well, that werewolf is dead now. And Cas is fine. But Dean just… needs him close. At least ‘til they get home.
"No, that shouldn't matter, Cas. I- I was awful to him." Dean hadn't noticed the tremble in his lip, or the white in his knuckles as he clutched the wheel. "I wouldn't forgive me."
So he does. It’s not unlike the way he kissed Cas when they rescued him from the Empty. Granted, there’s less sweat, blood, adrenaline. But just like that day, they’re both on the ground, and the gesture catches Cas by surprise. Just like that day, Dean pulls Cas in gently by the back of his neck and there’s no hesitance or fear. Just like that day, he just does it, presses their lips firmly together, and relishes in the taste of Castiel, in the feeling of the person he loves most in this world kissing him back.
Upon the sound of the door closing behind her, Dean shuts his mouth. He licks his lips and clenches his jaw, never taking his eyes off Cas as he walks around the bed and moves a chair to sit at Cas's left side, facing him.
"Thing is," Dean continued, a bit more relaxed now. "Cas knows all about this stuff. We got this huge garden behind the house that I'm not allowed to even touch. There's a million books about nature and trees and flower meanings on the shelf, and Cas has read all of 'em. I didn't even know flowers
If he’s being honest with himself, Dean always wants to sit next to Cas. But they have a routine by now; Dean drives, Sam sits shotgun, Cas in the back. Dean usually doesn’t fight it. Enforces it, actually.
The man smiled wider. "It's a pleasure to meet you, my name is Cas. You might not remember, but last week you-"
Jody and Donna followed, then the other girls, congratulations and "happy birthday"s left and right. Garth awaited his turn, and Dean made sure to initiate the hug with as much enthusiasm as he could muster.
Dean means to take the lighter from Cas and do it himself, he really does. That is 100% his intention as he reaches across the table. Except he sees an opportunity, and Dean Michael Winchester is nothing if not smooth.
His attentiveness. That’s another thing Dean might say if anyone ever asked. Cas left to visit his sister Anna last winter break. He left Dean in charge of the plants, three of which died inside the week. (For Dean’s birthday a couple of months later, Cas got him a book.
In any other circumstance, Dean would probably be embarrassed. But there’s no one around, he’s utterly exhausted, and in Cas’s arms, he feels weightless. He settles, wrapping his arms around Cas’s neck.
He was sure it was evident in his eyes, death breath, hair sticking out in all directions from holding his head above the toilet, but he said it anyway.
And there he goes again, belittling himself. Dean doesn’t really have it in him to argue any further; he'll get it through Cas's thick head one day that he's worth more than what he can do. One day.
It's a whisper. An echo of a whisper. Dean's been hearing it for a while now, calling to him, at the Roadhouse with Bobby and Ellen and Jo who he hasn't seen in far too long, or at the drive-in with Charlie,
They regain their composure, and one of Dean’s hands is still on Cas’s shoulder, under the sleeve, but the other one is now on Cas’s belly and Cas is holding his wrist there, stroking his thumb over it. He’s looking at Dean in the afterglow of a laughing fit, shoulders relaxed, all worry disappeared from his features, a soft smile that lingers but reaches his eyes and makes subtle crow’s feet appear. It’s the most beautiful thing Cas has ever seen in his billions of years of existence.
"The vomit elves came in," Dean continues. "Real cute. Little hats, miniature vomit bags, adorable. Efficient too."
Then Cas's hand is covering his, warm and steady and beckoning. Dean double checks that the road is clear (he's got a baby on board now, you see) before turning to him. His eyes are miles more gentle and kind than what Dean deserves.
“Wow”, Castiel said stunned as they got out of the car looking at the sky. They were on a road next to the forest. It was dark, there were no lights on the road or anywhere close. Dean opened the trunk of the impala and grabbed a bag and a blanket, then got out a flashlight and turned it on.
“I’m not saying more than that.” Dean took off his jacket and sat down at the dinner table. “You’ve done so much stuff here in this little time that I was gone?”
“Wait Dean, did you also forget that things are only open for pick-up?” “Oh shit”, Dean said and facepalmed himself. “Well, I guess one of us has to ca-” “You call”, Cas interrupted him. Castiel didn’t like calling people, it gave them really bad anxiety and Dean was very understanding of it. He quickly parked the car on the side of the road, took his phone out of his flannel’s pocket and dialed the number.
“Do you really have everything?”, Dean asked back one last time. Castiel was already halfway through the door but stopped to think. “Wait, my cam-” They got interrupted by Dean before they could finish their sentence. “Your camera is already in the car. Just make sure you take the batteries; I couldn’t find those last night.” Castiel put their hand into their pocket to pull one out and show Dean. “Can we...can we leave now? I really don’t want to miss this.”
Dean put the blanket onto the cold grassy floor, pointing Castiel to sit down. He took another deep breath.
They drove about an hour; it normally would’ve been a lot less but traffic was exceptionally bad that day. Dean and Cas lived pretty close to the Kennedy Space Center, let’s call it Castiel’s fault for trying to find anything relatively close to there that was still within their price range. Dean rather would’ve just gone back to Kansas but since Cas was going to college in Orlando compromises had to be made.
“Come with me”, he said as he took Castiel’s hand, hoping they wouldn’t feel how much he was shaking. “Dean, where are we going now?”, Castiel wanted to know. “You’ll see, we’re almost there”
Suddenly Dean felt Castiel getting closer to him. Softly, their lips touched. It felt like the whole world around them didn’t matter anymore. There was only them and the stars. And nobody could take it from them.
“You’ll see when we get there”, Dean answered as he grabbed the camera from behind Cas. Again, Cas pouted. They loved surprises but really wanted to know where they were going.
