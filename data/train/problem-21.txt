Sherlock laughed. “Yes I suppose their arrival does mean ice cream is closer. Now come through to the bedroom, we can get you into something more comfortable.”
"Fair point," the doctor acknowledged. He opened the door to the bedroom, the one with the huge bed, then crossed over and pulled back the covers so Greg could slide Mycroft into bed.
Sherlock tried to nod but couldn't. "Things are different now."
Both of Sherlock's friends bristled at that, they knew what past relationships had done to him… changed him… scared him… broken him so very nearly if it hadn’t been for John, he saved him; fixed him.
The younger man’s grin was a little one sided. Confused.
“Pet?”
"Shut up!" She snapped.
The doctor slapped him. Hard. As Sherlock blinked through the sudden sting across his cheek he felt a rubber cock pressed at his lips.
"You’ve been crying all afternoon, haven't you?" John asked in realisation.
"No, sir... Only ever had the tight ones before."
“Good boy.” He ran his hand through the younger man’s curls in a comforting fashion and took a seat. He used his free hand to cut the food up as he didn’t want to take the other one away as Sherlock melted into it.
Mycroft shivered at the thought.
I know it's been a crazy long time! This chapter isn't as long as normal but I needed to be done with it!
“I said go away,” Sherlock hissed. “Are you deaf?”
“Of course, yeah, but what mistake?!”
He swung the door open with much more ferocity than he had on the way in and snatched his brat by the collar, hauling him back into the restaurant.
“What?” the expression on the sub wasn’t helping to ease his worry.
"Sherlock, I left you suspended from the ceiling over night."
“Shush!” He ordered sharply. “I have already made you well aware of speaking out of turn. Or was I not clear enough for you?”
"Alright." John paced a few steps, then stopped. "I'll just have to show him that I'm not going anywhere and hope he comes to his senses." He snorted. What were the odds of that?
"Was that good?" Greg asked, leaning forward and nipping at Mycroft's bottom lip.
I was extremely close to letting Sherlock safeword here and ending the fic. So if you want him to safe word, STOP READING, because I don’t want to hear about it.
Sherlock watched his brother uneasily as Mycroft scrolled through all the navigation nonsense just to watch the show. He was pleased when Mycroft settled on the bed beside him, though he had a different blanket.
"Yes, sir," the Superintendent answered immediately.
“Dad had this big baguette thing he was eating on the outside of the tent Sherlock was in. He was joking around. Mummy told him not to. Especially when the seagulls started getting closer.”
"I'll have to have a talk with Gregory," Mycroft said. "I can't imagine why he didn't tell me." The government official picked at some imaginary lint on his trousers.
"We'll drop by later."
“Then how do you know about it?”
“But you want the big white wedding. You've said it before.”
John smiled. He had half expected the detective to turn down the offer just to keep what he thought was the moral high ground. He was obviously angrier than he looked with himself and wanted to put things right. The “Thank you sir” had come as a bit of a shock. A good shock, but one all the same.
John rolled up his jeans, then went after Sherlock, intent on walking with him in the water. He decided he wouldn't press, but would be a silent companion, at least at first.
The older sub sighed. "I wish I had found a way to bring you to John sooner."
"Gag," Greg said, pointing at one on a nearby table.
"Not addressing you properly. I promise I won't make that mistake again, sir," Sherlock said softly shifting on the bed to accomodate his caged cock which wasn't even trying to get hard at the pain.
"Now turn around and face me," the Superintendent ordered.
“I didn’t have much choice.” Wasn’t that obvious? Or was this Dom just trying to wind him up? From what he had seen so far that wasn’t the sort of thing he thought John would do, but he didn’t know. This man was proving fairly difficult to deduce.
Sherlock just pushed passed his ‘friend’ without so much as a hello.
John carried the sub into the play room and locked the door behind him. Then he set about uncuffing the brat that was now in a heap on the floor.
Groggily, Sherlock opened his eyes, though he still seemed far away.
Sherlock turned away slightly. It appeared he thought he’d revealed too much and soon that wall would be back, shortly followed by the rebellion that had been so frequent thus far.
Sherlock groaned and lowered his head down to rest on his cuffed wrists. It couldn't have been comfortable, given the posture collar, but he didn't complain.
John just folded his arms and watched. If Sherlock wanted to fight and exhaust himself then so be it. "You quite done, boy?" John asked, nudging the sub's uncomfortable looking cock with his foot.
"Are these annoying?"
Greg reached between Mycroft's legs and grabbed his caged cock. "I'm going to take this off of you, but that doesn't mean you get to come, not any more than your brother is going to get to."
"Sure." He passed the rope to the Superintendent.
“Your phone did, sir.”
Mycroft scampered over to the table and fetched the riding crop, the he rushed back and handed it to John. In almost no time, he had knelt back in front of his Dom and was eyeing Greg's cock eagerly.
"Yes, sir."
“I know. I moved out at the first opportunity, too. Got into a bit of trouble though, sir, which was when Mycroft made me move in with him and Greg.’”
"Brat," was the first thing Greg said on sight of Sherlock.
“Ok, I'm not sure when it will be. I'll give you a bell just before.”
"If they leg it, the cuddling is off." John turned and shouted at the brothers. "Do you hear that? If you leg it, the cuddling is off!"
“Let’s just say Sherlock went for a little work out, isn’t that right, boy?”
"Oh, don't be shy. It's just the four of us here. Now open up like a good boy."
About halfway through the film, John stretched, then stood up. "I'd like to check on the boys in person, see if they've calmed down a bit."
“Once you’re done… last night was the only time…”
He took the sub by an ear and dragged him up the stairs. Sherlock, aware how much trouble he was now in, surrendered to the Dom. John opened another door on the same landing as Sherlock’s bedroom. As the door slid through into the wall, a staircase was revealed behind it. He continued to drag the younger man up and threw him to his knees as he they reached the top. Without letting go of Sherlock’s ear, John reached over and began fiddling with the door controls. The door wasn’t like a normal door, it appeared old at first glance, but Sherlock realised it had been made to look old, old like a dungeon door, all stone and rock.
"Good boy," the Dominatrix said as she took the dildo. She turned it and held it with the head towards him. "Suck it. Get it nice and wet."
When his arms were released, they just fell floppy to the sides, Sherlock actually laughed. “Sir, I can’t feel... anything.”
"You can't honestly believe I would let you pleasure yourself? Even through the cage." John had paused where he was and was watching him closely.
All too soon... or not soon enough, the car pulled up outside the court.
John knocked on the door to the lab, waiting for his sub’s call. Part of him did wonder if Sherlock would just pretend to not hear it, or worse yet, outrightly ignore it.
“Yes, sir,” he followed on after the younger sub who was rubbing at his ear as he disappeared into the kitchen.
On the screen, Eurus appeared, clapping and laughing. "Do that again," she ordered.
“Yes, well…” John cleared his throat. “I want you to keep away from that woman in the future.”
Sherlock fought down his urge to reach for the little boy. He knew John needed to bond with him as much as he did.
"Finally," Sherlock groaned.
Mycroft rolled his eyes and closed them before his sister could notice.
“Oh, of course, I know that,” he tried to convey his reassurance in his tone of voice, the elder generation of submissives were all the same. They had a much more… built in level of respect for Dominants. “And it’s John, please.”
Now that he knew how this all worked he was bored. And he couldn't help but think that John was likely to follow him. His phone was still in his pocket, he hadn't taken it out after yesterday. The whole tracking thing did seem to come in handy. He couldn't find himself feeling guilty, though, and he knew he should be; it was the new way. “Still just chance.”
John cuddled him for well over an hour before he could even contemplate opening his mouth for productive means.
Without saying anything, John took his hand and squeezed it. He willed all of his love and support to travel through that connection and fortify his boyfriend.
Sherlock glared down at the floor, disappointed to be in the position he found himself in.
The guards nodded once and dragged both Holmes brothers to their feet.
“I thought the game was: I ask you a question, you ask me a question? Because you’ve just answered your own.”
“Didn't expect that, did you, Mr Holmes?”
“Where's John?”
“There’s something that needs to happen now, boy, in order for us to go downstairs.”
John barely slowed down as they reached his car. Sam was waiting by the rear door, which he opened as he saw them approach. He inclined his head toward his driver by way of thanks and shoved Sherlock inside with as much force as he dared.
It was obvious to the Dom that Mycroft wanted to hit something and he’d seen his reactions when in Panic before. He went and opened a drawer and pulled out a set of cuffs, moving quickly because he didn’t trust the sub.
John hadn’t stopped searching for the brat for the last few hours, everywhere Sherlock knew in his house he had checked. He hadn’t been outside, the attic window hadn’t been touched and the alarm hadn’t been triggered. With Mycroft’s assurances that Sherlock couldn’t hack into the alarm system without at least some equipment he didn’t have access to, John knew he was still in the house. Somewhere. It was just a matter of finding him, the problem was he was beginning to get concerned now, it had been a number of hours, and he was hungry so he knew his sub must be too. He was contemplating ringing his sub’s older brother for help.
"Uncle Jeff is staring at us," Finn whispered.
When he heard footsteps on the stairs, he knew it was John. He didn’t open his eyes. He needed to focus. He needed to stay in his Mind Palace, despite none of the case making sense.

"Why are you here, Myc?" The boy asked, arms folded.
“Oh, I am more than aware of that. But that is not the point and you know it!” he knew to stay with me. Have a car search for him, the longer he is out of my sight the deeper trouble he is in. He God damn knew not to run off!”
John stared at him for a moment. “That was brilliant.”
The greying haired Dom shrugged. "Yes."
John was not mistaken at the look of gratitude on Sherlock’s face.
"Get back on your knees."
“I don’t usually have to go down this route so early, if at all.”
Greg smiled and took his hand. “It doesn’t have to. It can slow things down until you calm yourself enough to see what you are doing to John.”
Finn’s legs were kicking out as he munched on his waffle. He didn’t understand Sherlock’s reaction to Mrs. Hudson. There was no way the little boy could understand how much the detective cared for his landlady, but that he could only take being fussed over so much.
Sherlock ignored him, his head stuck a few weeks back when he had been happy on his own. His Mind Palace had recorded everything in great detail. When he had been so focused on ignoring his submissive side.
“But, I’m thirsty,” the detective protested.
While he knew his sub would obey through fear of further berating, the doctor used the time to route through the big hold-all Mycroft had dropped off. It was full of everything he would need. He’d phoned his staff as soon as he realised Sherlock was playing up and told them to pack the usual gear.
“Hands behind your head.”
Eurus pushed her fingers into Sherlock's curls and tilted his head back and forth.
"He is so counterproductive," Greg said, watching from the side.
Sherlock coughed slightly when Mycroft tugged the collar of his shirt. "Know there's a dungeon waiting for you."
Sherlock had the sense to look ashamed, something else Mycroft found rather confusing as well as amusing. As he reached the doctor, he handed him his walking stick, then settled himself just in front of him on his knees.
Irene didn't answer, she paced towards the detective and reached down, snagging his curls in her hand. "Worry about yourself, Sherlock." She said as she pulled his head back uncomfortably. "I have my instructions." At that, she made a frustrated expression.
John sighed as he waited for Sherlock to join him for breakfast. He had been let off the punishment after the debacle a few days ago, but now it was blindingly obvious - without a punishment hanging over his head - Sherlock was bored.
The rest of Greg's speech went straight over the detective’s head as he was pulled to his feet, first one wrist was cuffed, then his second joined it behind his back. His phone buzzed in his pocket, a phone call he couldn't answer.
Sherlock glanced at him in shock, but he didn't argue. "Yes, sir."
Sherlock had initially played his violin in the study sat alongside him and John had revelled in some of the beautiful tunes he managed to pull from the instrument.
Irene rested hee hand on the youngest Holmes' arm. "I don't think the Ice Man did anything." How could he have done? "I think your brother is an interesting challenge."
Sherlock choked on it for several seconds, when it became clear John was not going to relent he closed his eyes and focused on breathing through it, calming himself. It was at that point that John buckled it up roughly behind his head.
“I have to hold out as long… as I can… and if you’re happy, my punishment will be over.”
"You might be the British Government on hold, right now, but I can still arrest you."
“But - please, sir-” Sherlock tried, but was interrupted before he could voice his many arguments.
“Tough. I can either put you under quickly or scene with you for a while? Your choice.”
"You are becoming a bit of a liability. Do you need to swap places with him?" He jerked his head in Mycroft's direction.
The government official nodded once.
John snorted at his sub’s honesty. “It wasn’t a test. I had to take an important phone call that dragged on longer than I was expecting. But you were very good,” he added, feeling the need to keep the boy at ease.
“Yeah,” the sUnited responded, but he was already engrossed in reading the case notes that the DI had given him, making sure to ignore anything that that pain in the arse Donovan had written. He had always found that no matter what the case, the Sergeant’s views were always biased.
Finn started stuffing everything into his mouth, hoping to hurry things along. It was Sherlock who placed a hand on the little boy’s arm and urged him to slow down. “If you choke, we won't get to go to the beach at all. Don't be in such a hurry.” The detective was pleased, however. Finn was a far cry from the little boy they had brought home who was afraid to eat for fear he would get in trouble.
“Over here.”
Finn shook his head.
John laughed. "I forgot my wallet. Sorry. I learned it from my pet."
Mycroft was focusing every scrap of attention he could muster on his Dom's feet. He could worry about Sherlock after he had spoken to him, and he would be speaking to him.
When it became clear his detective wasn’t going to ask for such simple comfort as a cushion – though this time he was sure it was through fear rather than sheer stubbornness - John reached over behind the sofa where he had a collection of proper kneeling pads, each one tailored to something different. He attempted to encourage Sherlock up, but just received a head shake in return.
He put his hand in the waist line of his trousers and pulled him upright. He undid the button and ordered him to step out of them.
"John doesn't need to work with her. If what you say is true he probably doesn't even want to."
At the door to the wet room, John reached around the Superintendent and his burden and pushed the door open. The whole room was tiled, a shower head in one corner and a hose in another. There was plenty of equipment lining the edges, including an enema set, beside the waterproof bench.
Sherlock extricated himself from him and rolled out of bed. He went straight to the kitchen and put coffee on for John.
"Yes, sir," the sub said, caught somewhere between dejected and rebellious. He couldn't decide which way to go, not yet.
"Open them, little big brother. You need to continue counting now."
Irene laughed, placing her hand over her heart. "The wrong porn, obviously. I'm going to show you how to do things right. Bring out your toys, Eurus. Let's see what you've been using."
The Superintendent slapped him lightly on the thigh at the little snuffling sound John made.
“If every Dom in the city had at some point touched me would you kill them all?”
"What do you mean you don't know?" Irene asked.
“Why does he have to come?”
"John," Sherlock called out after him. "That's not- ow!" He yelped again as Greg tugged on the two chains.
Sherlock straightened. “Speak, Lestrade.”
John brushed his hand over his cheek quickly before turning to the kitchen counter to prepare some food.
The youngest Holmes' eyes lit up.
Greg grasped his sub by the scruff of the neck. "That's two slip ups, boy. I haven't given you permission to use my name."
“I haven't told you the best bit yet…”
Sherlock dropped to his knees with a thud. His thoughts did keep straying away from the tally. As if the last one hadn’t been big enough, here he was dragging it out.
“He just got in the cab,” John told them. “He actually got in the cab.” He could not bloody believe his submissive.
Donovan was gawping. Had the Freak just called someone
"Mm. Myc. 'M awake."
“Nothing,” they both replied together, but Finn’s innocent expression wasn’t as mastered as Sherlock’s was.
The Superintendent's eyebrow went up, but he didn't say anything further. He just grasped his boy by the scruff of the neck and pulled him closer.
He shook his head.
He stood with the younger man and hooked his finger through the D ring of his pet’s collar. He bent Sherlock double until he was forced to return to his knees.
They sat there for 10 more minutes, Sherlock gradually curling more and more into the Dom.
Sherlock was most surprised she'd lasted the month.
"Both, I suppose. What have you done with him?"
Immediately the detective obeyed.
At that, Irene hefted Sherlock back to his feet, then walked around him and shoved him forward. "Forhead to the floor!" She grasped him by the nape of the neck and bent him double. "You too, Mycroft, or your brother here will see the end of my cane."
“Hmm,” Greg seemed to ponder, amazed at the changes in one Sherlock Holmes. “What can I do for you?”
“No, I’m fine, sir. Thank you.” Sherlock’s voice sounded so distant and broken. John sighed and made his way out of the room, intent on getting two cups of tea and giving the comfort and aftercare Sherlock so needed after such a thorough punishment.
“What?” The DI had just said bye to his sub as he headed out to his car.
Shakily, Sherlock obeyed. Then John turned on his heel and left. Sherlock glanced over his shoulder when he heard the door click shut softly.
Mycroft closed his eyes, trying his hardest to ignore them and stay completely still.
Irene stepped back at the force of the brother's fury. As she did the screen went black.
“Helping me? To find a murderer and to prove a point,” he seemed unsure of himself but at a casual glance he hid it well.
“Present for me, pet.”
Sherlock laughed at that. “I need to-” he cut off as sergeant Donovan approached.
He knelt so there was about half a meter between them. His hands went to his back, but the doctor could see him wanting to reach out and grab it. He must have come to the conclusion he would get it faster if he obeyed. That was the conclusion he wanted the boy to come to.
She nodded, she was excited as well, especially if Siger was going to be there.
The detective repeated himself louder, but with no more confidence.
The doctor crossed to where Sherlock held Finn, “yeah. Daddy.” He had a large grin on his face.
“No, but if my submissive had any sense, he would.”
“It's not going to be that bad,” John said with a slight chuckle.
"Hm? Mistress. Of course. I think it would be fitting."  Irene reached out to rest her hand on Eurus' arm, but the youngest Holmes snatched it away.
"It's not the being tied to them I'm worried about," Sherlock grumbled as he was uncuffed and dragged to one. "It's what's going to happen to us once we are."
John waited nearly 10 mins of Sherlock sucking his fingers before it was clear the boy was getting bored. He reached around the sub and pulled the rope he had attached to the hook up over his shoulder, making him jerk as he realised exactly what the hook was for instead of a usual plug.
Sherlock glanced at his Dom for reassurance before nodding.
“I can, you know.”
The detective froze where he was about to step down the next set of stairs… that was it… of course… the person that's trusted by everyone and just passes by. That blends into the background.
“I think you deserve it now, don’t you?”
John followed his sub into the bathroom a few minutes later when he heard the chain had been pulled. He paused at the door to see him fiddling with the cage. He was clearly trying to get it off, but there was only one control box and that was in John’s pocket.
The little boy giggled. “Bum.”
“Yep. And then its paddle time.”
Mycroft chuckled as he did just that in half a dozen bites.
When he reached the kitchen, he saw his phone on the side, plugged in to charge. Something niggled at the back of his mind and he wandered over, sliding his finger across the screen. He had three missed calls, all from Mycroft, and in quick succession over the last 10 minutes. He had planned to keep it on silent until he was willing to give his sub his own phone back. The last thing they needed were distractions, but he realised this could have been a mistake. Therefore, when his phone buzzed again, his finger was quick to perform the motion to answer it.
John spun him over and smacked his palm down on his arse before Sherlock had a chance to get comfortable. "You will not like the next few days. You will not enjoy them. But you will bloody well learn to not disrespect me, your brother, Greg or yourself. Now count, with respect."
Irene smiled at him. She looked like a venomous snake. "That's more than fine with me." The Dominatrix began prowling around the cell, finally stopping in front of Sherlock. "Your hair is irresistible." So saying, she buried her fingers in it and yanked his head back much like she had to Mycroft, then she crouched in front of him. "Beg me," she ordered.
He spun and pointed at the women’s neck. “Her collar. Ten years old, at least. The rest of her jewellery has been regularly cleaned, but not her collar. State of her relationship right there. The inside of her collar is nearly as new as the outside, she has it off as much as she has it on. It cant be for work because she’s wearing it in public and she’s in the media as I had already deduced. So what or rather who does she remove her collar for? Clearly not one Dom. She would never sustain the fiction of being an untrained sub for so long so clearly a string of them. Simple.”
“Shall we go back to the salad?” Sherlock asked, setting Finn on his feet.
"He's lying, sir," Mycroft pointed out after 30 seconds of John just staring at his sub.
Mycroft shook his head despite not being able to see each other. "No. Are you?"
“Good. She does what I do. Obviously I do not see her as competition given her gender. We met on a dominance course a while ago and have kept in touch. She's far sterner than I am, so I warn you, behave. She won't hesitate to punish her own sub if she brings her along and I won't hesitate to punish you. Is that a problem?”
The doctor lifted his pet up by the arm. "What are you doing down here, Sherlock? The night isn't even half over." He sat on the side of the bed and encouraged the detective to do the same.
Mycroft grinned lopsidedly. "You've already come once, sir, you're getting on a bit… old."
He chuckled softly. “He will be here at 7. Although you are due to remain completely naked for an extra two days thanks to your stunt at the beginning of the week, you will put on a shirt and a pair of trousers for the evening’s visit.”
“He isn’t any ordinary child, that’s what makes him special. Now if you don’t mind, I’ve seen too much below the belt already.” Mycroft spun on his toe and headed back into the living room.
“Just get around here, Mycroft. And father is here. With Mrs. Hudson.”
There was no response apart from a stifled sob and John tilted his head to look at him.
John settled back on the sofa. "Fetch my tea from the other room and I will think about it."
"No, it's not," his father agreed sadly. Mr. Holmes sat in Sherlock’s chair, holding Finn on his lap.

Satisfied that John had things well in hand for now, Greg settled back in the hot tub, truly relaxing, with his sub nestled up against him.
Sherlock couldn’t help but smirk at his retreating Dom and reflected on the situation, he was tied to the bed, but he hadn’t been abandoned and left on his own at the end of a beating and this Dom hadn’t over-exaggerated the punishment and allowed him to seek comfort afterwards that he didn’t realise he needed. This might not be so bad after all.
It seemed so long since the pair of them had been there, when it was in fact only a couple of days they'd been staying at Baker Street. He was starting to regret ever letting that happen. It wouldn't be happening for a while and Sherlock would most definitely be earning his trust once again and left on a very short leash.
John led the others back towards the apartment, thinking on his ridiculously idiotic genius of a sub. He'd be waiting for them in the hot tub, no doubt, just as the Dom had ordered.
Greg gasped and fisted his hands where they lay between himself and John. He couldn't decide how he felt about the fleshlight at this point. It wasn't as good as the real thing, but he needed it if it was all he was going to be allowed.
She closed his eyes and avoided looking up at his brother.
The Superintendent steadied him as he fell to the floor. "Let's get his feet cuffed together," he said as he held Sherlock down.
"What is it, little brother?"
"Yes, sir," Sherlock whispered, determined to enjoy what came next.
“And I bloody well made him pay the last time he ran off. Yet he did it again.”
This time, Sherlock didn’t respond, and he didn’t fight when John forced him to his knees, finally releasing his arm as he attached the leash to the wall.
John managed to hold in his laugh long enough to mute the call again. He wasn’t the only one, Mrs. Hudson was chuckling silently too.
Sherlock just glared at him, there was nothing else he could do.
Fetching a ball stretcher, the Dominatrix approached Sherlock again. She turned and held the device up for Mycroft to see. "I can keep adding weights to this until he's begging me to stop, then I can add more."
He reached out and pushed chunk after bite size chunk into Sherlock’s mouth.
The sub dropped his head. He knew what John had said on the matter and he wasn't about to repeat it.
Sherlock finally understood what the little boy was thinking about.
Greg grabbed the doctor by the arm when he tried going back to Sherlock. "He will learn one day. Come to bed."
"Its coffee, you nob."
“No.”
“Fun?” the doctor questioned. “There’s a woman lying dead.”
The DI was proud of his boyfriend. Mycroft had always been protective of Sherlock, but finding out he had failed him in such a basic way had taken its toll. Instead of wallowing in it, however, the government official had done what was needed to help, even when that meant giving Sherlock his space. Greg knew it hadn't been easy for him.
“Let the bubbles go down before you carry it.”
“Oh, Mycroft, tell your Dom that we’ve found him. He’s no doubt got an area car out scouting around.”
“Really, Sherlock,” Greg interrupted. “If you’re just making this up.”
Sherlock looked away, kneeling back on his heels so he could feel the shackles on his feet, being cuffed, he could reach them, but he could see over his shoulder.. He wasn't breaking free of those. And the fact the Dom had used actual shackles rather than the cuffs around his ankles bugged him more than it should.
“Kneel by the chair, pet,” John ordered as he finished chopping up the fruit and putting it into some dishes.
Irene spun around, but before she could do anything in retaliation several guards rushed in and dragged Mycroft from the wall and kicked him to his knees.
Sherlock just pretended he wasn't even in the room, quite enjoying the ice cream and ignoring the conversation around him.
“I know he did. But aren’t you glad he did? You have a son, Sherlock has some closure on his childhood, Mycroft understands the resentment, and their dad… he’s got out of an incredibly unwanted relationship… because of one little boy.”
"I'm fine," Mycroft said, eyeing his brother's torso which was crisscrossed with welts. "When our sister gets back, promise me you'll let her play nurse. "It hurts me to see you in so much pain. Don't bother to deny it."
Finn glanced up at him. “Why you don’t like it?”
"Boy. Mycroft! Are you daydreaming?" Greg asked. "I told you to get over here."
It didn't take long for the consulting detective to realise why this was happening. He would have clamped his mouth shut if he could have done.
Sherlock just sat back and laughed. If his brother could trust him to fly the helicopter, then the least he could do was return that courtesy.
“I have-”
John tightened his fist in Sherlock's dark locks making the kneeling man wince. “I'm sorry, sir,” he puffed out, trying his hardest not to struggle. He should have known the Dom would react that way, John hated it when Sherlock avoided a question because he was ashamed or embarrassed of the situation. He always said if he was embarrassed of the situation it was because his own actions had put him there.
"Care to join me?"
The youngest Holmes pointed a shaking finger at Irene. "Take her to my office and make sure she stays there. Don't let her touch anything!"
The mop of curls shook in a negative fashion.
The doctor nodded once. "Sherlock, I know you seem to think that being yourself isn't a good idea. But it's what I want."
“Did I get bubblegum flavour?” Finn asked.
John quickly searched him, wondering if the boy was high. It wasn’t something they had ever discussed but he knew about Sherlock’s younger days. Even if he hadn’t, he was a doctor, he could see a high kid when there was one.
Mycroft sighed, tempted to resignation himself.It would have been easier to be strong if his one testicle hadn't been hurting so much. He tried shaking off the ball crusher, but it wasn't going anywhere. All he did was make it worse.
A broken whimper came out around the gag and John muttered, "Aww, Lockie's nipples are hurting." It amazed the Dom how still Sherlock had gone. He teased his boy's nipples even more, twisting them and biting them until they were red and puffy from the abuse, then he applied a pair of clover clamps that bit down sharply. He began pulling and twisting them, revelling in the small whimpers Sherlock was letting out.
This time Sherlock didn’t stop himself making sound around the gag. He didn’t know what was pressed up against his arse but it was big, hard, cold and round. And he didn’t like it.
Mycroft watched his brother for a moment, and it didn't take long for him to figure out what Sherlock's idea was.
After a few minutes of waiting for things to reconvene, Finn was bored, he was shifting around and fidgeting just like Sherlock did. In the end it was Greg who pulled him onto his lap as Mycroft appeared.
“You hate eating out of my hand,” John pointed out as if it was the most obvious thing there was.
“That is an extra 2 for your tally, boy. What number's that now?”
The DI looked down at his sub, his head was bowed, much like his brother’s. He didn’t ask if the older man had anything pressing at work, he wouldn’t be here if he did, but it was also about time they went out for an evening again. “Yes, I think we will.”
Sherlock reached forward, wincing slightly as the trousers shifted against his arse, and snatched up one of the sheets of paper. Mycroft didn’t try to stop him.
With a nod, Mycroft went down the hall and knocked on the bathroom door. "Sherlock!" He waited, listening, until the sound of falling water ceased. But his little brother didn’t come out. “Sherlock, come on.”
The news was out before Mycroft and Greg had even started up the stairs, spilling from Finn in an excited rush.
John looked up and nodded once, turning his attention back to the younger Holmes. He walked around and sucked on the lobe of Sherlock's ear, then bit it lightly. His own cock was aching again and he was going to have to have some relief soon. Sherlock wouldn't. He reached up and removed the gag. "Anything to say, boy? Before I pass sentence?"
John smiled. "So I am redundant now am I?"
He stared at the floor, trying to work out what the hell was going on as well as what his next part of the plan was. His life had been going relatively well, for him at least. He had found a Dom that understood him. Yes, John could be an annoying prat sometimes, but there was no doubt the older man cared for him. It didn't matter it was a training contract, it was good enough for now. But these shoes were found by John? The evidence that was enough to have him charged by the police. That made no sense. He really hoped it hadn't been on purpose. Part of him expected it was... or maybe it was Mycroft's plan. He hadn't seen him since he'd bailed the station in a hurry. Everything always seemed to go wrong when everything was going right.
The detective got back to his knees and lowered his head, he would let Eurus lose her temper, he was glad he wasn't on the receiving end of it.
"Slow down, boy," Greg warned his sub. "I want this to last."
Sherlock opened his eyes and watched the two of them pace around the box.
Sherlock was struggling to remain on top of Panic. He could feel it bubbling up inside him and his Dom must have noticed because his grip became a little tighter. He used it to prove who was in control and remind the kneeling man where he was and who he was with. Sherlock focused on that until he struggled again and then glanced up at John, not meeting his eyes, so he could speak. “The kettle is probably boiled, sir. Do you both want tea?”
Now, he was stood just behind his Dom as he answered the door.
“You can’t-“
“Yes, sir. Put them in the van,” he amended his order. “Take them both to New Scotland Yard and be on call in the morning to remove this one to my facility. You all know the one I mean.”
"Yes, sir," he whispered, this time he couldn't avoid the look of concern on the doctor's face.
The doctor took a step back and sighed coming to a decision. He had intended on making him eat, letting him use the loo if he needed and then leaving him alone again, but that was not the answer he had been expecting. “You’ve been punished enough,” he concluded.
“You bloody arse. You complete and utter fucking-”
“Time for some fun, shitbag, now you enjoy this fuck… it’ll be quick, but I'm due back at work in half an hour. Douglas can take over and we can have some real fun later.”
The copper inclined his head slightly, he didn’t seem as effected by the gun aimed at him as he should have been. Douglas did, however, as he had moved a few steps back and away from his friend.
When they reached it, it was empty but the keys to the helicopter were there. Sherlock scooped them up then ran out the door.
Finn looked proud at that pronouncement. He kicked his feet as Mycroft fastened the buckle.
Sherlock hadn’t thought they needed to get married, not before, but as he looked at Finn, then turned to look at John, he realised he wanted nothing more. His eyes stung a bit, but he refused to do anything as ridiculous as crying.
He took Sherlock to the other side of the room where there was a quilt on the floor on the rug beside the bed. He’d set it up after long deliberation while tidying the house. “You’ll sleep there.”
The Superintendent smoothed down John's hair, but not in a dominant way, in a caring, soothing way. "Trust me, I understand. Better than anyone else ever could."
He had covered all the paleness of the detective’s skin twice and now his backside was a deep red. Sherlock hadn’t groaned or whimpered until the tally had hit 30 and John had covered his sit spot for the second time.
"It won't change anything," Sherlock said brokenly.
The younger man almost looked… happy. Dare he think it?
“She must have had an organiser of some sort, sir, she was a journalist. She didn’t have a laptop on her so it must have been her phone.”
“I was going to do this by a swimming pool,” Moriarty spun on his toe as he pondered out loud, “but I changed my mind.”
Sherlock shifted his knees on the cold tiles, but said nothing.
There was another silent nod. Getting fed up of the silent responses, John pushed down on his cane and pulled himself to his feet.
“I... I was rude.”
“I could have put you under in the den, but that won't happen now. It'll have to be the playroom, I can't trust you not to need punishment.”
If Sherlock tried to lean back into the thrusting of the fucking machine, it meant his whole upper body had to move. The chains hanging from the collar pulled and tugged against Sherlock's nipples.
"Get him up. Hang him from the ceiling."
Mycroft had knelt back, looking away from Greg towards John. He had clearly read what the younger Dom was thinking.
“Who’s in charge here?” he repeated sharply.
“You've charged him, Greg. He's not my sub anymore.” And that thought killed him.
Eurus appeared on the screen. "You idiot! Can't you control two men that are surrounded by guards? What use are you?"
She gulped audibly.
The doctor laughed. "You need to be more specific, boy."
He balked when he felt his cock being manhandled by his Dom. He couldn’t see anything and he didn’t like it but he didn’t even think of safe wording.
Apart from the little metal tubing being on the other side of the room, it appeared as if Sherlock had attempted to obey John’s demand, but got bored halfway through. From what his brother had said he wouldn’t put it passed him.
“Yes, boy?”
“What are you going to do?”
“I've made your favourite for breakfast.”
Finn reached for the detective's hand. They paused at the sinks to clean up, then they went back out into the restaurant.
“Hop up then. You want a milking remember.”
“I'm assuming you just got some bad news on your phone?” Sherlock asked trying to rub his wrists, but his fingers were numb, those cuffs had been done up tight.
Mycroft let out a huff.
The detective turned his head further away.
Sherlock closed his eyes, he needed to try and enjoy this. He needed to find subspace, he was sure if he deliberately evaded it John would punish him. And truthfully, there was no reason to avoid it, if subspace was where John wanted him, he shouldn't fight it. He was safe in subspace with John around.
John found Sherlock’s suit jacket and pulled his phone from the pocket.
John pushed his head forward. "Hmm," he pulled him up to his knees and dragged him out of Sherlock's view. "Head down!" John ordered again.
Mycroft couldn't help but feel proud of his brother. It hadn't taken him long to work out what Irene wanted, nor do it.
"Actually, yeah, good point."
“How often do I get John on his own these days? Without Finn or Sherlock within 10 yards. And anyway… I didn't think your brother would believe me.” Greg looked a bit sheepish about his last statement.
"You like that, do you boy?" Greg flicked that one off immediately and snatched the peg off before, doing the same thing again.
"No, sir, no."
John slithered down the front of Sherlock's body, running his hands over him as he went. The look he gave his boy was hungry and lascivious.
The Superintendent kept his grip on Mycroft's hair as he continued to crop him. He brought the crop down time and again. The muscles in his sub's back were taught like a bow. When Greg's arm began to hurt he pulled Mycroft from the bench and dropped him to his knees facing his brother.
“Go and fetch our jackets,” John patted Sherlock on the arse as he carried the plates through to the kitchen to find a cloth.
Sherlock collapsed to his knees beside his Dom who was sat in the comfy chair.
Greg and Mycroft had stayed for lunch, but not much longer. The government official had meetings that afternoon as did John. It was only supposed to be a quick catch up after the case a few days previous.
“No, sir. No. I’ll be good. I’ll stay on my knees, sir. I promise I can be good for you.”
Thanks Sherlockian4evr!
“Thank you, sir.” There has been no need for the Dom to do that  he had every right to fetch a glass of water and pour it on the floor in front of him, making him watch.
The detective smiled sadly at his boyfriend, he understood why the boy was so shy but didn’t mean he had to like it.
It took him nearly 20 minutes when he opened the door to the lab and couldn't spot him, there was about 1000 places he could be. He hadn’t spotted the sub’s hiding place straight away because Sherlock had clearly thought it through, he’d put everything that had originally been in said cupboard in other ones to not arouse suspicion by making a mess.
“As opposed to what? Him actually doing this?”
"John, can't you-"
Soon, they splashed up to Finn and Siger. Mr. Holmes was tired, but trying not to show it.
John patted his boy's arse. "What brings you here? I thought you were doing fine on your own."
The doctor started walking towards the water again. “Think about it.” He scooped Finn up and threw him onto his good shoulder.
“It’s hardly a family reunion,” Sherlock complained.
Greg elbowed John. "The bedside table has a mini fridge under it. It should be stocked with beer. Pass me one, would you?"
"Now what?" Mycroft found himself asking.
“I thought bringing them in would clear your name. They were covered in the blood of the guy in that jewellery store.”
Towards the end of Mycroft’s speech he turned towards his mother. “Have you any idea what you’ve done? And you don’t even care, do you? Self righteous bitch.”
John huffed out a sigh. "An order is an order, even if it's to do something pleasant." He grasped a handful of dark curls and pulled his boy's head into his lap. "If you can't obey me in this, too, we still have a problem."
He tightened the towel up and picked his boy up with it.
The doctor tipped Greg's head back and kissed him. It had been a long time since he had done it and the urge to do so took him by surprise.
“John!” Mycroft yelled, taking in the scene in front of him in a way that reminded the doctor of his sub. He was the last in the room and his men were already in the corner.
The tension that came with the silence in the room could have been cut with a knife.
John held his arms out and was surprised when he didn’t get an armful of Sherlock. He appeared hesitant. John couldn’t really blame him, but Sherlock should know by now that when the crime had been punished, there was no need for bad feeling.
John glanced down to the pair of pants he was holding in his hand. He had collected them from the bedroom floor after last night. “These aren’t for you, the washing hamper is in here.” He dropped them in it.
John just laughed at him.
This was definitely odd. Maybe it was a Holmes thing? He would have to speak to Greg to see how he handled Mycroft's tantrums, as minimum as they must be, but every sub had them by rote.
“I’m hardly going to make you kneel on the cold ground, pet.”
After John had placed his boy on the bed, he used the towel to dry Sherlock off. He took his time and didn't miss a single inch of pale flesh.
"My Dom," Sherlock's voice was tiny.
His eyes opened in confusion. "Isn't that the point, sir? Punishing me for getting hard?"
"Not a good idea," Irene shook her head, hoping she had said enough to persuade Eurus out of it but not too much as to piss her off.
Deciding not to waste anymore time trying to see if pleasure was a way of calming the detective, John pressed in a third finger. He didn’t spend much longer working it in.
"You, get some water for my brothers," she ordered the nearest guard.
He put up with it when John pulled his arms back around behind him and cuffed his wrists there.
Neither of them did, which was a good thing because when the dish of ice cream was presented, it was far larger than they had anticipated.
Greg just shrugged. “Colleagues pretty much covers it,” he corrected.
“It’s genius. I know how people think.”
“Mycroft did you have a hand in mother’s sentence?”
"Awww, if my big brother wasn't gay I would say he was in love!"
The punishment side was decorated to go with the dungeon theme. It held all the things that was on Sherlock’s hate list. The other side of the room held all the things that Sherlock liked, where John clearly intended to enjoy time with the sub.
Irene glanced at Sherlock once again, but didn't say anything. Instead she chose a two seating booth by the window. Kate automatically knelt beside her, but John held his hand up to pause his own sub. "Could I have a sub cushion please?" He asked the nearest waitress.
“In every way,” the older man corrected, like that was the most important fact.
The doctor laughed as he finished with the winch. "You're brother is exactly the same, Mycroft." He headed to he door and flicked the lights off. The cameras were night vision in all the rooms.
“You what? It’s okay, pet, I’m not mad at you.”
Sherlock didn't want to, and he knew he wouldn't be able to even if he did. He left his mouth open for his Dom's fingers but was shifting his hips.
Eurus moved closer to Irene and wrapped an arm around her waist. "Just look at him, my big brother, feeling so guilty no figuring things out sooner and sparing my little big brother so much strife."
"I can take these clamps off the both of you, but you have to do exactly as I say, Sherlock." She gave his cock a couple of pumps that did nothing but repulse him.
“Lestrade?” Sherlock questioned as he opened the front door.
He was still fully dressed and that wouldn’t change, for an hour at least. He’d also be sure to make the brat stay out of clothes for an additional 2 days, considering it was 2 days since his last escape.
Rather than make the sub walk, John scooped him up in a bridal carry and headed down the stairs with him.
Because of the usual lack of Sherlock, John didn’t worry and he had had no warnings from any of the alarm systems, so Sherlock wasn’t up to no good. He could imagine that if he wasn’t well entertained, being up to no good would become a regular occurrence. That would be setting the boy up to fail.
“Good thinking, boy. Well, come back then.”
“We knew that was going to happen.”
“Now stop trying to change the subject, you brat.”
"Respectfully, sir, I'd be reaching for my cock. I like my own hand better."
“She more than likely will now that Sherlock's escaped. When she went for him it was an offence enough, but she's the cause of a murder suspect escaping. Yes I know he's innocent, but at the moment in the eyes of my superiors, he's not.”
"This is getting weird."
At once, he was forced to the floor, two men holding him and one with a decently placed boot in the back of his leg making his knee buckle.
"Just wait until this thing is pounding into you," John said, thrusting his fingers in deep.

Finn struggled until the detective set him on his feet. Then he sat down. After a moment, Sherlock and John sat down either side of him in the shallow water. The small waves rippled around them pleasantly.
As the doctor worked, he focused on the cold cases that he could solve without leaving the house. He was glad he was still allowed to use his brain in such a way. He didn't know how he could get through this if it wasn't for such an outlet as that of the cold cases.
“Why? Sir?” he added at the raised eyebrow. He couldn’t believe he had almost slipped up again so close to his most recent disobedience.
"John-"
"I've got you."
At the detective’s ‘idiots’ comment John’s hand found his ear again after yet another sharp smack on the back of the head. John pulled him so he was between his knees.
Mycroft laughed. “I’m a foot rest now apparently.”
"Mistress, please, I don't understand."
Mycroft scrambled across the room, ignoring the shallow whimpering coming from Sherlock. He threw himself over the bench and waited to see what would happen next.
Greg, watching his sub, could tell what he was thinking. “I can allow you to speak with your brother, Mycroft, but no more. They'll be no persuading people to let him off, ok? Let me try and sort all of this out legally.”
"Your baby brother is fine, quit worrying and kneel."
"I don't think she liked the fact her trip here was cut short a few weeks ago," Sherlock looked around the room, this was where John had brought him afterward. When he'd messed up the first time.
"Here! Here!" Sherlock agreed.
"You're not, sprout. Weren't you listening?"
John was starting to feel incredibly stupid for trusting him, he should have known that the temptation to the detective who found cases such a vital distraction was too large to resist. Trusting him at home and trusting him here in the place where he feels the most comfortable were two completely different things. If he had wanted to just take off and do whatever he pleased he should not have signed that contract last month. But he had and that would have to be dealt with, John sighed, it felt like so long since he had had to punish the younger man. Even if he had come out to the crime scene without his Dom, he would have been supervised by Greg because of his specific tendency to find trouble. Mycroft had made it perfectly clear when they had signed the contract. It had been John’s decision to follow him on a case, it was his job after all and he hadn’t wanted to interfere where he didn’t need to. He should have known that the main place that he would need to; it was the main place he acted up. That was more than clear now and seeing how he had acted between realising it was murder and now he was wrong to ever give him the choice to go out on cases alone. He had also made it quite clear that as he was with him that he should not just take off when he felt like it. He had no back up for a start and this part of London wasn’t known for its friendly conversations.
Whatever John was up to was a mystery to the detective. He was completely out of sight. Even more so as the Dom had slid a blindfold over his eyes earlier.
“I knew there was a reason you wanted to come! You never do.” John grinned up at Sherlock which seemed to reassure Finn more than words had done.
"Boring!" Sherlock declared.
“In the front room. What’s going on? What’s with the missed calls? And the tone of voice?” John didn’t know which answer he wanted first, but any would do and he needed to get it all out.
“Stay,” the Dom ordered.
John watched his face, the way it flickered through every emotion Sherlock had ever come into contact with before. He tapped the tip when he got it fully inserted and he jolted again.
Irene grabbed his cock. "Try that again, doggy."
Greg patted Mycroft on the shoulder, leant in close and said, "Not a word, pet."
John had gone.
The doctor snatched his sub by the curls and forced him to his knees.
Greg thought about the debacle at the club the other day. "Well, no."
“Pull over, Sam.”
“Not at all, I just treat him like a child when he chooses to act like a child.”
Mycroft glared her down for a moment before eventually dropping to his knees beside his brother.
"Sherlock it was a week ago and you still haven't explained how the burglar did it. But that's beside the point. That's once you've not addressed me properly. So that's 3 strikes of the strap, you loved it so much last time."
“Sir. 19, sir.”
"Babe, I thought you enjoyed it." He glanced over at the sea.
The kneeling man jerked when the plug up his arse suddenly decided to vibrate, pressing right up against his sweet spot for a few seconds before backing off and then reattacking it.
John fed him far more than normal but the kneeling detective was clever enough to just go with it.
"Sir," Greg ground out.
4 days. It was 4 days before any of them heard anything from the detective.
Sherlock grinned. The doctor was sure that if he had mentioned a game of chess this time last week, he would have had so much attitude that the tally would have been impossible to keep on top of.
"Suspend him," John ordered suddenly.
They would need to stop at the shop for some toys for the boy. Couldn’t have him on the beach without swim trunks or buckets.
"I would say it was trouble prevention," Greg said with a chuckle.
"But, sir-"
The doctor’s head jerked up to see the DI running across the room, the door slamming back into the wall in his wake.
He glanced over his shoulder, fine misty rain clouding his vision slightly. The doctor and Donovan were arguing about something quite heatedly. They’d moved aside even further away from the Yard members. Sherlock was too far away to hear what was being said even for his super hearing. Donovan had her hands in the air and she was waving them dramatically making her point. Whatever the point was.
“I change my plea,” she said quickly. There was clearly something in Siger’s testimony that she didn’t want the whole world to hear about.
“I dropped the petri dishes, sir,” he said quietly.
"Come back over here."
Eurus grinned. "You two should have brought this one here before!"
Taken aback, John stood up straight and asked a question he didn’t really want an answer to. “Do you want me to leave?” He responded with a nod, clearly not up for talking much. “Are you ok?” Another nod, but he didn’t have to be an experienced Dom to see that was a lie.
He had still seemed tense, but not overly so, given the circumstances. Instead of leaving his leash hanging, he had attached it to the floor in an offering of comfort which Sherlock seemed to recognise now. He would need to get used to other people soon. He couldn’t keep him collared and in the house indefinitely. He was meant to be training him and with that came being a good sub in public circumstances, not just areas they saw as safe. One unknown member of society was the perfect way to ease him into it… or so he thought.
“No!” John headed over to one of the locked drawers that Sherlock hadn’t had a chance to break into yet and picked up a thin type of jute rope that didn’t appear to be very long.
"Ah, yes," Irene said slowly. "I had forgotten that." She backed up from the door and turned to face Eurus, a fake smile on her face. "Thank you for reminding me."
“Sir.”
Finn shuffled further back under the bed but John decided against getting up and walking around. He would give him a moment to calm down. To that end, he sat on the floor next to the bed and waited quietly.
“Don’t bother arguing.”
“You’re getting out of your depth.”
And she now had a cane in her hand, poised to strike Sherlock with it.
Sherlock turned from the corner, in time to see him land.
Irene grinned the whole time she did the same to the younger Holmes.
Greg glanced sideways at his sub. "One more slip up and he will know about it, that's for sure."
Sherlock stood with a shirt hanging from his fingers. What was the point. He had lost John. He had lost everything.
"Quite. Thought that might work. Running warning then, open your mouth out of turn again, or fail to do so when appropriate I will use the strap as instant correction."
My apologies for such a long wait!
“I don’t want you to ever be sorry for flinching. Is that understood?”
The detective's gaze flickered to Mycroft. "No, mistress." Sherlock glared at his brother and Mycroft got back to his knees, his hands immediately settling behind his head again.
It was a little thing, that small bit of praise, but it made Mycroft squirm, feeling ridiculously proud. "Thank, you, sir."
“With me? Yes. With this woman? No, not at all.”
At that, Finn sprang to his feet and hurtled off toward the salad bar, Sherlock managed to grab him by his coat as he ran passed.
"I can feel them."
"Now, I really don't want to do this with you right now. But I don't want to see you cry even more. So we are going to start slowly and I mean very slowly, Sherlock. Do I make myself clear?
“I bet that was fun.”
Sherlock sighed, but he knew what he'd prefer. “Will the scene be boring?”
He continued to watch his sub for a moment. He seemed to be in his element here, knew what he was doing and how he was going to do it. He sniffed and then shook his head before leaning over the body, getting a closer look. He examined her much in the way Sherlock had but he was sure he hadn’t picked up on anywhere near as much detail as his sub had.
"What about him?"
"Sorry, Greg," Sherlock heard through the door. "I can't let him out on a case. I understand. I can't guarantee safety. I can't let him out no matter how important it might be. I know. I'm sorry."
"Double scoops, then." Sherlock bounced on his toes. He spun around. "We can eat it together. All of us."
“Now, pet, this is new. It’s similar to a retracting lead. It runs inside itself, and has a length of about 20 yards, if you leave the house, you will be on this lead, so if I was you, I would get used to it.”
"What peace?"
The doctor bit his lip, undecided if he would let his sub have what he so clearly desired.
The doctor could see that he meant it. He had penetrated his boy with two fingers and he had been facing away. Compared to the first time they’d scened properly, this was a massive improvement.
"You'd use the strap," he muttered.
Moving as fast as he could, the Superintendent knee walked to John. He was curious how the brothers were doing, but didn't dare to ask.
"Mycroft, you may walk to breakfast. Junior, you get the pleasure of crawling." She turned and started out the door, dragging Sherlock behind her.

“Now, boy!” John barked.
"No, sir."
Deciding that perhaps he needed to try a different approach, he pointed to his pants that were on the floor beside the detective.
"You were warned. More than once. Bend over. You'll get 20 with my hand and 10 with the strap."
“There is a lot of responsibility being a Dom. You cannot deny that. I can’t turn to someone if it’s been a rough day.”
“Of course, pet, shall we go through to the den?”
I know it's rather quick but I go into my second year of university on Monday and I wanted to give you guys something. But don't worry, I will not disappear off the face of the earth. Not with this WIP anyway, :)
"Mycroft?" John asked.
Sherlock closed his eyes. "Yes, sir." He didn't think he could do that. It had just been so easy for him to screw up.
"You uncuffed him then, John observed.
“He likes you for more than just that. I mean I’m not saying he isn’t massively grateful, he just likes you for other reasons too.”
"I know things are different here with John now than they were when you first arrived but when you mess up now, you feel better after you've been punished, don't you?"
“That’s it?”
Sherlock closed his eyes. "No."
That got his attention and the reaction was a lot more sporadic than he had anticipated. He sat up sharply and gagged as his collar caught in the tightness of his Dom’s grip on the leash. “Bloody hell!” he spluttered. “Sir,” he added sheepishly. “5, Sir?”
Greg wanted to complain, but he wanted to avoid the other two subs' fate even more.
"Yup! Papa got me Snakes and Ladders. We can play, but we have to make sure Daddy doesn’t cheat."
"I thought we were going to have… never mind."
Finn made a face. "I'll do it, but I won't like it." He have Sherlock an excited look. "Will you get married today?"
“Where’s the phone?” he growled.
Sherlock sat on the bottom stair. “I'm not meant to go too far from my Dom.”
"Say 'yes, mistress."
John had been angry when he had stepped into the room, he had few rules, but the ones he did have he expected to be obeyed, he had intended on letting the brat sleep in here with him in the near future and had been more than disappointed when he found him in here without permission only hours before he would have been allowed.
John got rid of the paddle and ran his hand up Sherlock’s back, soothing him as much as he could. “Shh, it’s over. We’re done.”
Mycroft got up and grabbed Finn in a hug as soon as he was within reach.
He started scrolling through the recent activity to see if he could find out what his pet had been up to. Messages – he glanced up when he realised that his sub wasn’t paying attention to his berating… he was looking out of the window.
By episode three, Sherlock had dosed off against his brother's shoulder.
It was only the fact Finn stirred in his arms that brought him out of his daze.
“No. Do it. If anything happens, you will be the first person I contact. Not even your brother is stupid enough to find himself in serious trouble two days in a row. At the moment, Sherlock is in no danger, he isn't one for suicide, after all.”
"Sir, please, no." The government official tried to swing away, but only made Greg laugh.
John offered a small smile in response. “Well I better deal with him then,” he nodded over the banister where the detective was pacing to and fro on the bottom step.
“And that was Greg on the phone?”
“So you knew he would have had to ditch it somewhere?”
Sherlock shifted to comply with the order immediately, barely hiding his wince as he  moved his foot off the pillows and onto the table.
“My Dom’s out.”
"My thoughts exactly," John agreed. "Just toss him over one of the benches."
Eurus matched her expression as she stepped back, pulling Sherlock back at the same time.
“He still alive?” Sherlock asked quietly.
"Why?"
“He has?” he tried to keep his voice level, even though this sub was being openly rude, the argument they had just had was more than enough to prove that. He also hated that she had noticed and he hadn’t.
John wasn’t nearly as angry as Sherlock had calculated him to be. He just clipped the leash on his collar again and released the cuffs. Sherlock collapsed in a heap, unsure how long he had been holding himself up for. John apparently wasn’t in a forgiving mood though. He just yanked hard on the leash until Sherlock spun around onto his hands and knees.
“You're choosing him over me?” Sherlock's hackles were up immediately.

Sherlock didn't reply, just let his feet hang over the edge of the bed as he stared down at them.
With another smile at the older man, John turned, his presence alone making all the other people in his way move to the side. When he reached the bottom he grasped Sherlock by the ear. He pulled the younger man out of the hall, not caring at that particular moment that half of New Scotland Yard could see them, it was a shame, he had been doing so well. He didn’t need to calm his enthusiasm but he needed to curve it away from abruptness that led to being rude, specifically to Doms but even more specifically towards Doms like Greg. Just because he put up with more crap from Sherlock didn’t mean he deserved it or had to.
Irene struck Mycroft with the cane. "Ask, Sherlock, and make it sound pretty."
"I know," the Dom leant over to kiss the back of his head. "Now go to sleep."
Sherlock made a point of glaring at the Dom and was much surprised at the response. John didn't speak, just took him by the curls and dragged him over the bench.
John sniffed, then made a face. "I was going to give you a hug, pet, but you smell like fish."
As John moved to his feet, Sherlock ducked his head, not looking forward to the bollocking he knew was coming. John didn't like lying.
After several deep breaths of him trying to control himself he thought he'd lost the battle, Sherlock's hand was like heaven and hell all at once.
“Then try the places he doesn’t know.”
The government official snapped his head back around and glared at her. If she could have read the thoughts in his mind, she would have been terrified.
Despite himself, Mycroft started to drift off. His head fell forward and he jerked awake. This was one time he refused to sleep. Something bit into the flesh of his neck and he slapped at it. His hand came away holding a familiar looking dart, then his world went black.
Sherlock looked down at it with a forlorn look on his face and sighed the sigh of the long suffering.
Sherlock opened and closed his mouth a few times, "No, sir." The detective had turned bright red with shame. He had never intended to treat his Dom in such a manner. Why did he have to wind him up?
“No. Ice cream.” He pushed the table away with far too much anger for a 3 year old, it nearly rocked onto its side.
Sherlock let Finn say goodbye to the girls as Greg took them out to the car, but he lunged for Mycroft before he could stop him.
John was calm and a good influence and he could feel it, feel himself calming down in his presence, even if it was only day five. He was settled here, as much as he didn’t want to be, but most of all, he liked John. It was the first man, let alone Dom, that had had a positive impact on his life in practically forever.
"No. John." He didn't look at Sherlock and his voice was quiet as he spoke.
“You've seen these before?” He had noticed earlier that Kate didn't wear them.

"Right."
"Doesn't mean he gets to come."
"Are you sure you're ok?"
This time, Greg wasn't driving. Beth sat to his left and Amy sat to his right. They were intent on spending as much time with him as they could.
Irene picked up the riding crop, though she didn't intend to use it yet. She just enjoyed the reaction she invariably got when she flexed it and sliced the air with it.
"Yes, sir. I am." And the thought of it made him shiver. His shiver was made worse when he felt the pressure lift around his bollocks and the sound slide free from inside his length.
“If Mycroft has anything to do with it, it will be just as bad,” Sherlock pointed out.
John nodded. "It's fine. Come on up."
Sherlock quickly took in everything he could, not knowing how long John was going to give him or what was going to happen any moment. He couldn’t find anything that was on his limit list. John was an experienced Dom, he seemed to have every piece of kit he may or may not need. He must have somethings that were on Sherlock’s limit list so where was it all- oh. John really was an attentive Dom. The feeling of guilt quickly crept up the younger man’s chest. He’d clearly gone out of his way to remove things that would scare Sherlock. The doctor was aware of his past and things that had happened with previous Doms, Mycroft had made sure to sit them both down because he was more than aware that John would want to know and Sherlock would not be willing to give anything away that would make him look weak.
John’s cab pulled up outside Barts and he quickly paid the driver before racing off inside. It was amazing how his stick he had so heavily relied upon was now nothing but a distant memory.
“When I'm bored my brain goes… ‘mental’, sir.”
“Why would I ask you what reward you want if I had no intention of giving it to you?” The Dom was confused, yet interested in how the sub had made that leap.
“Yes, sir,” Sherlock whispered. He wanted to, but he needed the notes. And they were still in the other room a few mere inches from his brother and he didn’t think he could face him right now.
"Snap your fingers," the Superintendent ordered.
Greg was immediately taken aback. For a start, Sherlock was knelt as comfortably as what Mycroft would in the same situation and another had he just called him
Sherlock was still trying to work out what the game was. What the point was.
Greg snorted. “Ok, then let's try other places. Baker Street? Would he go there?”
“What is it, pet?” he reached down and cupped his cheek. He was so red he should have been boiling hot, quite literally.
It was at that point the waiter came over with a dozen empty glasses. Finn looked at them questioningly and, then he looked up at Sherlock. He'd obviously never seen anything like it before.
John laughed, then used his free hand to land a blow right over the plug Greg was wearing. "I don't like it when my toys lie to me."
John, carefully watching so as not to actually harm his pet, twisted Sherlock around a bit, winding him around and around until there was just enough pressure on his cock for him to yelp, then he let him go and watched him unwind.
John laughed, pulled his finger out and pushed it back in as far as he could. “Go on then.”
“Tonight will be different, alright. To get you used to being penetrated in a pleasurable way, you will more than likely be stimulated and if you behave you can get off as much as you want.”
Sherlock gagged on Irene's words. "Since when were you such a suck up…"
Maybe the mad Holmes 'loving' her would be better than the opposite. At least that's what the Dominatrix thought.
Ignoring the Dom's words, the first thing Sherlock did was reach for his caged cock, but the chain that ran behind his back between the cuffs wasn't long enough. He had about 2 inches slack, it wasn't even enough to brush his finger tips across the cage.
"To be fair, Mycroft, Greg was there. Aren't you more likely to get it from him, than from that git?" He jerked his head to the window.
“Go upstairs to the playroom, kneel by the door and wait for me.”
"Shut it!" The doctor slapped his sub, hard enough to stun him to silence. "You need to learn to behave." John grasped his cock again and started stroking it hard and fast. He was right on the edge. Close, so close. "Open," John ordered sharply.
"Now, ask how you can please me."
Sherlock flinched.
"So am I, but I love you anyway. You were meant for me. Your sister understands."
At that, John had expected his sub to move, to mimic Mycroft and drop position. But he didn't. He stayed perfectly straight. The Dom couldn't help another small smile. He let Sherlock stay in position a bit longer as he played with his curls, wrapping one around his finger.
Irene was more than happy to oblige.
"I was at the window. Everyone was doing the whole 'let's scream at things we don't understand' thing up the street."
Donovan laughed in his face. “No chance.”
“Do you know an Irene Adler?”
At that, Finn looked up, hopeful, he had never been to the beach before.
“Why?”
“Not what?”
On the screen, Eurus was laughing." Keep it up Irene, this is entertainment!"
"Tell me, boy, do you want to come?" John asked.
The government official scooped him up, not looking as awkward as he should have. "Good morning, John," he said when the doctor joined them in the living room. "How is my brother doing?"
“Do you trust me enough to believe I will release you and not do something worse?” John heard the sub swallow hard. “If you don’t, don’t give them to me.”
“You weren’t wrong for asking after him, Sherlock.” The Dom reached out and rested his hand on his shoulder in what he hoped would be perceived as a comforting gesture by the younger man.
They stopped and grabbed a laptop so they could keep an eye on Sherlock, then headed to their bedroom, but when they reached their room they saw John was already doing just that. The doctor was laid out on their bed watching his own laptop screen.
Greg laughed. "Well, I'm for chips. I'm starving."
When the Dominatrix hesitated, Eurus held out her hand in her direction and wiggled her fingers.
“Why did you come in here?” he asked eventually.
“God damnit, Sherlock, just be glad I'm with you this time.”
“Keep still, Sherlock,” came the inevitable order when Sherlock moved.
“Drifting, sir.”
John, he would not eat without him. He had no idea that the Dom was stood at the doorway watching his sub where he knelt.
“I-” he caught himself before he went any further. Don’t complain! John’s been great. Don’t complain and maybe it’ll continue. “Nothing, sir. Sorry, sir.”
Mycroft held his hand out, but his action was casual, he was enjoying himself far too much but didn’t want to go too far… this sod hadn’t been suitably punished. Yet.
"That's 4. And you're a clever boy, what we're my exact words on the matter?"
“Flinching, sir.”
"Eurus!" Mycroft yelled out, but he was ignored.
Eurus pushed her hand into Sherlock's curls and yanked his head back. "That is this one's fault."
The doctor grinned at it and waved it in front of Sherlock's face. "What do you think, boy? Is this you? Do you enjoy the camouflage? You know, one day it could save your life."
He glanced at his brother and saw Sherlock was just resigned to the whole thing. That wasn't he way this was supposed to go, they were meant to fight back. They were meant to be strong.
“Sherlock… What happened at Lauriston Gardens? I must have blacked out. Twenty-two Northumberland Street. Please come?” John spoke it out loud as he read it, becoming more confused as he went.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "There's arsenic in the sugar jar, John. Be sure to give Mycroft plenty of sugar in his coffee."
“Sorry about this,” John said, gratefully taking the cuffs off the DI as he handed them over. He tightened them around Sherlock’s wrists then pulled him upright.
Sherlock groaned, but didn't argue further. He didn't want to risk upsetting either Dom.
"That's better." He looked over at John who was helping Mycroft. "See, you can be a good boy." Greg smoothed back Sherlock's hair, running his hands down to the clasp on the posture collar. He unfastened it and set it to the side, then massaged the sub's neck.
“Well, you’re already on 4.”
"Are you insane?!" the Dominatrix asked. "Now she'll come here."
"Yes, sir." Sherlock managed not to growl, but just barely. He was pulled to his feet and uncuffed, then he was cuffed with his hands in front of him. The guards lifted him up and hooked the cuffs over a hook in the ceiling, then stepped back.
Sherlock studied him carefully and the doctor was more than aware what he wanted. He pulled away and turned his back on his sub to fill the sink with warm water.
Irene, mouth agape, watched Eurus take a sip of wine. "I didn't mean to... I won't ever cross you, Eurus. I swear."
Sherlock bowed his head, resting it on the Superintendent's hip. The blasted machine was hitting just the right spot. He groaned and shook, unable to put together a coherent thought.
Sherlock nodded again.
“Yes, sir. I was hoping... well, I’m sorry about last night, sir... my head just gets, well...”
Sherlock averted his eyes at that.
“Get up, boy.”
"More than alright. Thank you, sir." When John pulled his arms around behind him and cuffed his wrists there, he was completely relaxed and ready for the position.
"He face planted in our bed," Mycroft said with a worried frown. "I don't like it."
There was a clear huff as Sherlock fought the cuffs for a while, despite knowing it was fruitless and then he laid down.
“You don't want to know,” it was John who responded, as he collapsed on the sofa beside his fiancé.
"You really leaving him there all night?"
“Come and kneel over here, then.”
Greg grumbled silently as the plug pressed into him, ridge after ridge working its way in.
Siger was grinning at the doorway by that point, Finn in his arms. He couldn't help but chuckle at his son's treatment. The way Martha treated him was nothing like his ex wife had done. She was playful with how she handled him and would never really hurt him. But not only did Sherlock seem to be resigned to it, he seemed comfortable with it despite the uncomfortable situation.
The detective just renewed his glare.
Whilst the waffle was cooking, Sherlock rested his cheek against John's thigh, his eyes falling shut. He was being good and he planned on keeping it that way.
The Dom’s brow furrowed. “What, forgiven?
The detective yelped around the gag and threw his head back as John let the flogger fall intermittent with the superintendent's.
There was a smirk on the sub’s face but he surprisingly didn’t speak.
Sherlock sputtered, "I don't want a gag."

That caught the little boy's attention. "You're gonna get mawwied?" He started bouncing in his chair, excited. "Can I tell Mrs. Hudson?"
The two women must have been gone quite some time because Irene had not only painted Eurus' nails, she had fixed her hair and done her makeup as well. Their sister had even changed clothes. Eurus looked beautiful in the way a cobra was beautiful.
“We can’t just wait!”
“What's the last thing you do remember?” The sergeant asked.
When Sherlock's sobs had died down he shifted his head slightly in John’s lap, a much hated past time several weeks ago.
Yes, the Dom had intended on being stricter with the boy but this wasn't the way he wanted to go about. He spun the boy over, leaving his hands twisted above his head. He gripped Sherlock's fists in his hands at the look of frustration on his face.
The next slap sent him sideways.
Greg shrugged. "I can see why Mycroft gets a kick out of it, to be honest."
Mycroft nodded his agreement. That was exactly how he felt.
"Right. I thought so." John gave Sherlock's curls a shake. "Forehead to the floor, arse in the air. Now!"
Greg and Mycroft got in the front seats, the DI sliding behind the wheel. Mr. Holmes and Mrs. Hudson got in the black sedan that was parked behind them.
“Good. We got there in the end. Put your head to the floor.”
The pair of them turned and left.
Mycroft dropped down again, watching his brother the whole time. Sherlock looked rather uncomfortable, the simple fact his eyes were screwed shut and his cock was dribbling probably explained that. He wondered how long it would be until he was in the same condition.
"He is quite a sight," Greg said, nodding. He set Mycroft swinging and caught him after a few spins.
John had had to remind the younger man of the rule - when he enters a room, Sherlock should kneel - and there had been obvious reluctance as he had knelt and handed his violin back to the Dom, but he had obeyed without complaint, despite the hesitance.
"No. No, sir. I can't. It needs to come from him."
“What have I done?” He almost yelled. He wanted answers, no he
His mind drifted back to that day that John had broken down in front of him… crying, speaking to his wife that wasn't there, admitting what he had done and Eurus being the reason for all of it... He was yanked back to the present when something sharply bit into his nipples.
"It's Lestrade," Sherlock deduced immediately.
Sherlock tried his best to do nothing but look down with his eyes screwed tightly shut.
“Can we have hot chocolate in the flask sir? Rather than tea.”
“Both bottles are of course identical.”
John watched him go, an idea catching him. They were going to have some fun. Then he'd tell the sub he was done.
He smiled. “Did I miss anything, sir?”
At that, the doctor laughed. “Yes, pet, I'd noticed.”
“Surprised.”
John shrugged. "Bit late to now."
"Yes," he hissed.
“That’s- that’s…”
“Not at all.”
“Oh, no, sir.”
Without much enthusiasm for the task, the Dominatrix circled Mycroft. Her only enjoyment came from the prospect of inflicting pain as revenge for leaving her at Sherrinford with Eurus.
"Sir, I-"
Sherlock was surprised the Dom had thought to check his phone. He was even more surprised he hadn't noticed John was doing it. He found himself rather proud.
“I can formally suspend you here if you like? In front of the man you were in the middle of abusing and his Dom who will be more than willing to put a bullet in you when you are no longer a copper.”
10 minutes later Sherlock was back in his usual suit looking far more comfortable. Finn was wearing a checkered shirt, looking not dissimilar from John.
"Get writing." He dropped the pad and the pencil on the tray and jerked his head at it.
“He's a sub. What power does he have over me?”
Irene smirked. "You're learning."
"You're no fun," Irene glowered at him. "Sherlock, tell big brother to be fun."
Mycroft pushed his bottom lip out but kept quiet.
As for John being abusive, again that's bollocks. "Why is he punishing him?"
“But-”
“Could I have another drink, sir? Please?”
"You said you'd let him down if he asked!" Mycroft snapped. He tried to struggle to his feet but a guard stepped up behind him and pressed his gun to the base of his neck.
"Really what?"
Greg wandered in behind him, barely awake and yawning. He breathed in the smell of the coffee brewing and perked up a bit. "You never make coffee."
Sherlock had been calm, he had been fantastic. He’d got out and beaten his brother and it had only taken five days. But without being able to get back in and sitting waiting for the inevitable had just been making him madder and madder. He kept telling himself he’d got out and that was all that mattered.
"Nothing regarding you or John is a waste of brain space." That had sounded a bit too sentimental when said out loud, so Sherlock sought to change the subject. "Hungry?"
Sherlock nodded. “Lets go out tonight.”
Sherlock looked up from where he had paused on his knees. “He deserves it.”
John paused by the door and smiled at his defiant sub. He really was going to enjoy this. The challenge of the youngest Holmes.
Sherlock began breathing heavily, kicking up a fuss.
It wasn’t long until he was working his lubed finger into his hole. “Keep still, Sherlock,” John’s tone was stern and the detective knew he wasn’t going to get away with anything anymore.
"You aren't going anywhere, boy, quit struggling."
"Keep going, boy," the Superintendent ordered. "You're making your brother get hard."
“How can he cheat at Snakes and Ladders?” Greg asked, carrying in a tray of coffees and a milkshake for Finn.
"Suck," the doctor ordered as he thrust two fingers into his boy's open mouth. "And make me believe you want to."
When Eurus crouched down to tighten them up uncomfortably, she realised her little big brother had done them as tight as possible already. She stood up incredibly slowly, without saying a word. Silence lingered in the room for several seconds before she grasped a handful of Sherlock's curls and used them to fling him to the side. "You're here to entertain me!"
Mycroft frowned. "That's no fair, I have to-"
John went straight to the Yard after Greg's phone call, demanding the cabby go twice as quickly, but also wishing he'd slow down.
"You're my very first friend," the youngest Holmes told Irene. "And this would be like, what? A sleepover?"
“What are you sorry for, boy?” John pushed.
Irene smirked in Mycroft's direction. "Eurus is my kind of crazy. The things I can teach her-"
The Dom paused with the fork half way to his own lips, "I'll tell Greg, because he needs to know for the case. He'll probably tell your brother."
John caught sight of Sherlock lounging back against the headboard of his bed, one of his long legs stretched over the other. All of his stuff was still in suitcases, the two or three he had brought with him scattered across the room. The Dom pushed the door the rest of the way open, allowing it to slam back into the wall. Sherlock resolutely ignored him, running his index finger along the patterns of the duvet cover.
"No."
Sherlock took up his position immediately, not complaining even as John cuffed his wrists behind him.
"I'll need statements," Greg told the doctor as they headed towards the main road.
“John, we’ve got him.”
He returned, but didn’t allow him to stand, just told him to shift onto it once he’d dropped the soft padding by his knees. Sherlock was further assured how this Dom’s temper worked. Even after the way he had just spoken to him, which even Sherlock knew was way out of order, he still fetched something that would give him an improved level of comfort
John pushed his head down so it was ducked submissively, then just stared at his sub for a while. It was rather intoxicating, watching Sherlock knelt so obediently for a change. He thought he could watch it for hours, but doubted his boy could manage it for that long. Still, he would watch him for as long as he could. When he saw Sherlock beginning to ache he'd move on.
The doctor reached down and grabbed Sherlock's over sensitive cock, squeezing the head. "I asked you a question, boy!"
Sherlock chuckled in relief, he was expecting the older man to be angry about him hacking into his phone and going through his private messages, but he didn’t seem bothered at all, instead he just seem amazed.
“It’ll be fine,” John assured him. “Help Finn out.”
"I saved your life!" Sherlock complained. "That should make us even."
“Why are you… helping? I don’t… I-” Sherlock hid his face in the pillow. John screwed the lid back on the tub and clambered on the bed next to Sherlock. He laid parallel to him and put his hand gently in his hair. The younger man pulled away and John tightened his grip. “No boy. You’re mine, if I want to touch your body I will and you will not stop me. Now put your head in my lap.”
"Well I went to bed without socks on."
He nodded again.
"You ran from Mycroft?"
The Dominatrix bit her lip. She didn't plan on staying on the island any longer than she had to.
For a moment, John considered letting his boy down, but he decided to wait a bit longer, at least until Sherlock had had his fill of water. He was hesitant to upset the pleasant equilibrium they seemed to have obtained.
The fact John didn't reach out to grab Sherlock's hand, hit him harder than it should have. It wasn't until a large group of men appeared on the path ahead, that John made a grab for It.
As if they would try and go anywhere with how exhausted they both were.
“Daddy!” Finn yelled again.
The cage soon followed, wrapping Sherlock's cock up snuggly as he fixed it to the sound and then the cock ring around the base of his sac.
“Do you want to go and get a cup of tea, pet?”
Sherlock looked down at his limp cock and hoped it stayed that way.
“Does it matter?”
"Pet, what are you doing?" John called out, pacing through the house.
Sherlock, the stubborn git that he was, had got into bed so he was sat on his arse. John noticed that he immediately regretted it, but was biting his tongue, he couldn’t show that he had screwed up, he just had to go with it until an opportunity arose. He leant over to clip the leash to the front of his collar and Sherlock swatted his hand away like it was a fly.
With his collar chained to the bench, John gripped both of his sub’s wrists in his hands as tightly as he could as he removed them from one another. He knew the brat would fight and he was ready for it. He pressed one up his back so his fingers were between his shoulder blades, and completely still before he did anything with the second.

The Superintendent removed the plug and everything flowed gracelessly from Sherlock's hole into the bucket. The detective turned an even brighter red beneath the hood as the process completed itself. John flushed the waste away, then he used a hose to wash his boy down before using the towel to dry him off.
The doctor shook his head and placed his hands on the detective’s shoulders, pushing down. Obediently the younger man allowed his knees to bend.
Pet? At this time? Wasn’t he supposed to be in trouble?
John inclined his head. "I hated it. That's why I became a commissioned officer."
“You’ve been kneeling for a long while, Sherlock, give your knees a rest for a bit.”
"Ta," John called back, snatching up Sherlock's shirt and helping him do up the buttons.
Mycroft took a moment to compose himself in the sitting room before he followed his own Dom to the den.
With a huff, John set about cooking their tea leaving Sherlock to mope on the sofa.
The pull in Mycroft's shoulders was strong and would grow painful soon enough. That did nothing to deter his raging erection, in fact it made it worse.
Anyway, onward and enjoy!
The older man pointed at him, anger clear in the gesture as well as the look on his face. “Now look, whatever you’re trying to imply…” he trailed off and Sherlock grinned.
"No, mistress," he whispered.
"But what if I want to do something for you?"
“3… 2…”
John reached forward and snagged the Superintendent by his bollocks.
The whole while Sherlock ate, John watched him. If the detective noticed, he said nothing. Then after 10 minutes, he clapped his hands and stood up, heading for the door to the bedroom in search of a suit.
The little boy shook his head.
"Sherlock, I don't know why you seem determined to ignore the pain in your leg, or why you seem determined for me to think you're fine. Or why you seem determined to lie to me about it." John crouched beside the sub and waited for his response.
“In there,” he pointed, deciding to change the subject, he knew the answer to his unasked question was likely to ruin what had just happened if he began quizzing the sub. He turned to John when the detective moved into the room. They followed him. “Mycroft said you’d likely tag along if I got him involved.” He nodded at Sherlock who was crouched over the body on the floor. “This has been bugging me for weeks and I talked it through with him first, Dom or not, he comes first when it comes to his little brother.”
Instead, drinks had been laid out by the staff, coffee for the Dom and a glass of water for Sherlock.
Sherlock tugged at his cuffs pathetically and then fell still.
“Sherlock, Dad will be here soon.”
“Good boy.”
“Excuse me?” The man at the desk looked like a right grumpy arse but John didn't care.
Sherlock glanced up, from where he was knelt beside his Dom’s desk. John had set up a small stool in front of him. On it; a pen a pad of paper and a dictionary.
“You can't get out,” she stated, sitting down next to him and tapping the cuffs at his wrists.
Sherlock thought deeply, thoroughly, then nodded once. “Yes, sir. You don’t seem like Victor, in that respect at least.”
"Babe, it's ok to make noise."
The detective bit his lip as he felt John step away, what he wouldn't give to investigate what was on his nipples right now. Instead he was determined to be good and kept his hands behind his head.
"Sherlock, don't start sulking, he's worried about you, that's all," John reassured him.
“John?” The DI stood beside the body, still waiting on the rest of his team.
The door was pushed open and a tray was the first thing to appear.
He shook his head and sighed. “Haven’t I been punished enough yet?” there was still a hint of anger in his tone and John wasn’t having that. Although, he realised, he’d barely been punished at all.
John heaved several deep breaths. “I don't know,” he repeated slightly quieter.
"Irene-" Sherlock tried.
Sherlock was scrambling in his left coat pocket in search of what, John didn’t know. Suddenly he was waving a warrant card at the windscreen of the cab.
"She's letting me get my revenge."
He dropped to his knees, still keeping half an eye on the other man. It felt weird having a layer of fabric between his usually bare knees and the carpet.
“Now, I have given you an order. What do you say in response to that?” John ploughed on when there was only silence. “C’mon, pet, you know the answer to that now.”
Sherlock’s voice was low and nearly broken as he spoke. With much hesitance he crept forward and rested his head on the Dom’s foot. When he didn’t immediately remove it from beneath him he pushed his head into the lower part of his leg. “Please, sir, please. I’m sorry.”
Mycroft was still watching Sherlock, he was quiet. But content enough.
“Good, pet, well done.” The words were spoken fondly and Sherlock had to hide another smile.
Irene leant in close. "Oh, I think your sister has valid points. Doctor Watson doesn't know how to handle a big boy like you, but I do." She stood up and took a step back.
“John!” Greg yelled, but he had already reached the lift and the doors had already slid shut. With a heavy huff, he took the stairs two at a time. He crashed through the double doors seconds before the lift opened up.
"Now talk to me."

“No. That lady with the funny hat said we had half hour.”
"Sir, can I have the keys to the cuffs?" Mycroft held his hand out.
Greg was already on the sand, his two girls well on the way to reaching America with their two foot hole.
He had had a case about these sorts of security measures before. They were used at supermarkets to keep trolleys from being stolen. They had also been used at an airport, but it wasn’t the luggage trolley being stolen that the police had been worried about. It was the amount of drugs stashed on one of those trolleys. Anderson, the idiot that he was, always ended up being put on jobs he had no clue about. They didn’t even need forensics there. He had claimed that there was no way the trolley full of cocaine could get past them when he was clearly wrong because it had. Sherlock had taken less than 30 seconds to make the deduction and had pointed out that it was in fact easy if you just moved around the areas that locked the wheels. It was also just as easy if there were two of them, which was likely given the size of the job, to lift it up past the magnetic force’s reach.
“Of course,” John muttered. He needn’t have been worried. Mycroft’s driver stopped at a huge beach shop that carried everything from beach towels, to buckets and spades.
Sherlock paused for a moment, looking around as if for inspiration, but eventually he realised he wouldn’t get anywhere so dropped to his knees. “I am not eating out of your hand like a dog,” he growled to show his annoyance in another way.
"Mm hm." The doctor kept working quietly, finally tying off the rope, then he got a new length and began tying oneif his boy's legs to the bench. When he started on the second, he spread his boy's arse wide. He reached between his legs and pulled his caged cock down to hang over the edge, tgen he ran a length of rope through the tip and attached it to a hook on the bench. "There. Much better." John circled around in front of his boy, the gag back in hand. He waved it in front of Sherlock's face. "Open up."
He groaned as he climbed from the shower and wrapped himself in his towel. He checked Sherlock on the screen of his tablet and was content that the detective wasn't struggling or fighting his restraints. Good. Otherwise he'd end up starting from scratch and tying the brat up every time he left the room until he learned to be still. It was good to see there was still trust there.
Sherlock rolled over and grabbed the pillow, wrapping his arms around it. John smiled. His sub always grabbed one of the pillows during play or punishment. He couldn’t work out if it was a comfort thing or habit, probably both, he concluded.
He pulled his phone from his pocket and glanced at the screen. “No signal. Bollocks,” he whispered to himself. “Do you know where I can get a decent reception?”
"Why? You know I'm right."
"Yeah, well, neither is the way you treated us at that club the other night."
He exhaled loudly. “Chemistry, physics, engineering and maths.”
John didn’t look up as he fiddled with the leash and programmed it to the correct length that he wanted.
“Sir…” he started tentatively.
“I'm just glad it's you I'm kneeling for and not Ben.”
The sub was more than right. It was well over an hour later when John finally spoke to him.
John just let himself go and enjoy it. Soon enough, he pulled his pet against him and shoved his cock as far down his throat as he could as he came.
The detective lay there, completely still, unable to fight it or move with it. He had been tied securely down. Even more so when John paced around him tugging the straps tighter still. He couldn't believe he had the sound in still, he was looking forward to a break from it. How was he supposed to know the bloody thing was hollow?
The detective stumbled for some resemblance of control. He’d just have to behave really, really well and then John wouldn’t want to get rid of him and he could stay here. He was finally ready to admit that he wanted to be here and he had thought John wanted him too.
“It’s a crime scene,” he pointed out for no apparent reason. “I don’t want it contaminated, are we clear on that?”
As soon as Mycroft's knees hit the floor, he laughed. "No matter what you do, how hard you try, you'll never be able to predict my sister nor will you be able to keep her happy with you."
The following morning Finn was fast asleep on the bed between both John and Sherlock. The detective woke first, or so he thought.
“Sorry,” he mumbled to the man in front of him, he was ready to get around him and find John.
"That's better!" Eurus said.
Sherlock groaned into his gag, trying to mumble something to himself.
Much to Greg's surprise, the Dom reached forward and snatched his cock roughly.
“Yes, pet. Punishment over. You held out a lot longer than I thought you were going to. What did you learn from that?”
Irene tittered, placing her hand over her heart. "You went all out when you bought these crosses. Excellent." She moved behind Sherlock and rubbed his cheeks. "Now by all governing wisdom I should use lube for this, but some of my clients like it dry and unprepared."
Sherlock spent the next three days relaxing. He never expected to be at a place like this, i.e. with a professional Dom and be able to relax, not with the data he had collected on Doms. John Watson had completely changed his opinions on what Doms were like and what they stood for. He had just been unlucky enough to come across a couple of ‘morons’ as John called them. The facilities John had installed in the lab were just as good as the facilities at Barts and Sherlock really did appreciate it. Between the lab and sleeping, he didn’t feel like he was at some sub learning camp. He couldn’t draw himself away from the doctor for very long in order to have full use of the amenities that were available.
“One, sir,” he puffed quickly, before John could think he was being a brat and not letting that one count.
At about 6am, Sherlock got to his feet and whacked the cell door with his fist. It hurt, but he didn't care. He'd worked out the shift change over was 7am, the guy outside the door would be exhausted.
The older sub immediately pushed himself from the sofa and dropped to his knees, his hands clasped tightly in front of him.
"Mycroft, shut it," Sherlock hissed, as he winced.
Sherlock resisted the urge to roll his eyes. He knew it wouldn’t help matters. “The case, sir.”
"He's not, sir."
Sherlock nodded his head, to keep himself distracted from the fact the Dom seemed to be tying the rope to the bench. It was odd, but he seemed to be enjoying the feeling.
"Yes, sir."
The leash was just long enough for the Dom to make himself a cup of tea without letting the boy go, so he did so and placed it on the table. Then he moved all the dirty dishes to the floor beside the kneeling man along with a bowl of bubbly water. He also dropped a tea towel on his lap.
Sherlock glared at him.
"Your arms feeling ok?" He checked, running his hands over his shoulders again.
“Bollocks,” he hissed. John nearly collided with him. “I’m sorry, sir, but we’ve got to go up,” he tugged him towards a fire escape ladder and only let his hand go so he could grab it and begin to scramble.
Letting out a sigh of relief, the sub lifted his hands to behind his neck. To his surprise the Dom placed his stick to the side and knelt down in front of him. He began to unbutton his shirt and Sherlock whimpered. “Shh.” He lowered his hands to help and John smacked them away making a tutting noise. “I told you to put them behind your head, that was an order.”
"Does it have to be a big wedding?" Sherlock asked, obviously unnerved by the idea. Though he didn't want one, he'd do it if John did.
"Well, what did you expect? As hard as you were, I wasn't getting the cage on any other way."
"What do you say?"
“Yay!” Finn yelled. “Ice cream.”
“You forget, you have to ask permission for that anyway, boy.” John said it casually, like it was an everyday thing. “So you would have had to wake me up whether you were tied to the bed or not. As for tomorrow we will start your routine then. You will be awake at 7 o’clock, see you in the morning. And do not forget the buzzer, it is your safe word throughout the night.”
"I gave you an order," John warned him with his tone, gripping his curls and tipping his head back.

"You think I'm going to hurt him?" John asked pacing around the kneeling government official.
The sub held it immediately.
Mycroft nodded, blushing slightly. "Sherlock, I know I've apologised. But what I did was wrong. I'm not angry with Gregory for punishing me, do you understand that?"
"I believe you can deduce the answer to that."
“I don’t need you to tie my feet.”
Sherlock smiled sadly and ruffled his hair. “3 minutes.”
Greg grabbed his face in his hands. "Mycroft, look at me. I didn't know. Either way, John's taken care of him." The last thing the evening needed was his sub in Panic.
room that was full of odd things. He got distracted from his mission by examining them.
"My poor little big brother. Did that nasty woman hurt you?" She helped him sit, then examined every inch of him.
"Tough." She reached down and squeezed them far tighter than Mycroft had done them.
"You never let me orgasm like that, sir."
“Now, you…” he made a show of thinking of something for him to do.
"It's John, tonight, if you like."
friends. They had done everything together as children, but had gone slightly different paths since they’d grown.
The Superintendent grasped Mycroft's cock and applied the clamp to the tip.
With his other hand he flicked at the clamps and Sherlock whimpered.
John had met subs like Sherlock before. That was his job after all, but they genuinely didn’t want to give in, to submit. John could tell just after a few hours of Sherlock’s company that he wanted to submit, he just didn’t want to want to. He liked it but he didn’t want to like it, or felt like he shouldn’t. This was new. John was seeing things in the younger man in a way he’d never seen in any of his subs before, so by giving him a consequence that was time sensitive, Sherlock felt like he was in control when in fact the younger man’s fate was entirely in the blond's hands.
“What’s that?”
Sherlock closed his eyes. "Thank you, mistress."
"This beats an orgasm," Sherlock whispered into his ear.
"One what?" Mrs. Hudson asked.
They cuddled for about an hour, John continually rubbing the spot that made shivers flitter through Sherlock. The detective continued to make the noise that sounded like he was purring. John didn’t comment, just made sure he kept dragging the noise out of him and smiled at the top of his sub’s head.

John shook his head. “Stop being so dramatic. Mycroft will start getting controlling if you block him out completely.”
Sherlock glanced at the shorter man, thinking on his feet. He wanted to say anything but the truth… a friend? A colleague? But then he realised in a way they were both true. John had said in the car they were friends, he hadn’t really seen it that way, but John always knew these sorts of things. It had taken a month, but Sherlock was well aware of that by now. He could also be a colleague, he was a doctor and was surely going to offer some advice, especially if he asked, that was what colleagues did, wasn’t it? Help each other out?
John took the few steps up behind him, his breath hot on the back of his neck. He tensed, not daring to even think about turning around.
Sherlock knelt upright, he had to be in his 'pet' position because of the way his hands were tied but John didn't seem bothered.
Sherlock turned his head into John’s side, whimpering quietly. He gave him a moment to settle and then moved to put the paddle away.  “As your brother has come out all this way to see you, I will cuddle with you in the front room and you will give him your upmost attention as dazed as that will be.”
"I'm on your side."
“You’ve got a lot of bad habits, boy. This body is mine, you’ve signed the contract.”
Sherlock has another decision to make
Illness once again means time off uni which means another chapter
“Well I know you’ve got one. You weren’t on the phone to Greg when I appeared at the door and you were distracted by something.”
“Sure.”
It was nearly 20 minutes later when Greg raced into the room, having let himself in. He went straight to Mycroft and crouched in front of him. The DI could see immediately how well John had done. He’d stopped him from hurting himself or breaking something. But that didn’t mean he’d calmed down.
"You want control back tomorrow?"
“How can I be your son?” Finn asked softly. “You’ve not done the doption papers.”
John couldn't help but believe they should take in the little girl, not watching Sherlock with the little boy. He couldn't help but wonder if it was something they should discuss as a family, though. Finn had been through so much already. Would he resent a ‘sister’? Or would he revel in it? There was a lot to discuss. Maybe the question should be what would he think rather than the actual situation.
"I didn't give you permission to speak."
“I think he wants me to take a look.”
With each smack, Sherlock let out a low moan. He didn't seem to know he was doing it. His face screwed up tight for the first few blows, then it went slack and his eyes fell shut.
With a sigh, the older Holmes admitted, "Yes, I was. I loathe being drugged and then manhandled."
“Hmm?”
Sherlock laughed. "Piss off," he hissed up at her.
Sherlock watched with a smirk, despite how uncomfortable his wrists were.
The salads they made were grand enough to qualify as architectural masterpieces. They both put on lettuce tomatoes, peppers, radishes and bacon. When Finn added eggs, Sherlock made a disgusted look.
Both Doms ignored the sounds of protest Sherlock made and headed to the living room.
The two of them, resigned, fell to the floor.
“Nothing, sir.”
He pointed to the men in the corner with one hand and patted his sub’s arse with the other. “Hop up, pet.”
"Yes."
It ended up being the subs that spoke more.
Sherlock's bottom lip poked itself out again. John lent forward and bit it.
"Mistress, please, would you be so kind as to let me down?" the detective asked.
"Do it!" Greg barked.
“And leave me here?”
"He is the baby brother. What did you expect?" Even as Greg said it, he expected John to try for the back of his head again and dodged. "You haven't let it go completely, you do realise that? You still want to Dom me." He gave the doctor a lopsided grin.
The Dom didn’t put him down again until they were outside of the playroom.
Sherlock leant over the table, his wrists coming up to grasp the other behind his back.
Mycroft nodded and waited for John to join him. The doctor hesitated a moment, but if there was a chance Greg could help, he'd let him.
“I don’t…”
"Yes. You did."
"No. But Eurus is."
Both Mycroft and Siger could see Sherlock on a screen in the witness room. They were both rather proud until the inevitable outburst.
He shivered slightly and knew he needed to find a jacket of some sort without going home. Damn February weather. He closed his eyes momentarily before they snapped open again. He needed to change his clothes, but couldn't afford to just walk into a shop. He was sure he he'd been on the news... a charity shop though, a charity shop often had stuff left on the door during closed hours. Perfect.
“You’ve met my brother, you know of his intelligence. Did you expect me to be an imbecile?”
He returned with a panel gag, a small rubber dildo on one side. He wedged it between Sherlock's teeth and pulled the straps behind his head, connecting it to the collar.
John bucked up on the chair, groaning as the dildo buried deep inside him changed position in a jarring fashion. He groaned and moaned as Sherlock's hand went down and then back up again.
He waited a moment before moving in front of the younger man and crouching down to his level beside him.
She nodded before retreating from the room. Whenever his staff were around John made a point to watch all submissives around them but most recently he watched Sherlock. This sub was completely indifferent to them, he had expected something far far different from the younger man. Right from the beginning it was clear he wasn't a people person, and the idea of more people being around, staff or not... well John thought he would act up around them, in subspace or not. He had been so reluctant to call them back, only his anger at the brat's previous stunt had caused him to do it.
“Stay.”
As Mycroft crawled towards the door, Sherlock tried to thrash about, but all he managed to do was make himself bounce around a bit. He didn't want to be left behind.
He pulled himself up onto the ledge and looked around. The angled part of the roof wasn’t that high, within about a yard was a ledge and he knew from the outside view that it was flat to the edge of the rather big roof.
Glaring, Sherlock stood, only obeying because it made him more comfortable and John knew it.
“That is not an answer, boy!”
"How... disappointing to see you again," Sherlock spat. "I had hoped my sister would keep you occupied longer, give you some of what you deserve."
She nodded and disappeared for a moment before returning with a padded cushion. John set it on the floor beside him and jerked his head at it. Sherlock was glad for the nonverbal order. He felt stupid being the only sub on his feet inside the entire cafe. He knelt down on the comfort of the cushion without a word and stared at the floor, unsure why the Dom had bothered when Irene clearly hadn't. At least it was some small comfort for his knee.
He sighed in relief, he would have hugged his big brother back, but he was still chained to the floor. Did John know? And Greg? Or did they believe the fake evidence John had found?
“I don’t do refunds.” John used his stick to prod at one of the cushions on a nearby chair, straightening it up. “Mycroft knows that.” He knew he knew that, because it had been part of their discussion when he had been “warning” him of some of Sherlock’s traits.
John busied himself with preparing a sandwich for the both of them and chopping up some more fruit while Sherlock leant against him, perfectly content to trace patterns on the Dom’s shoe with his finger.
John froze, staring down at him. "That's impressive, pet."
Still, Mycroft's eyes were on his brother. All he could see was the frustration on Sherlock's face. The obvious arousal being the key to it. "Sir, please, let me out of the cage."
All John could think as he hung up was that Sherlock was high.
“Which one would you have picked, just so I know whether I could have beaten you?”
Irene frowned, watching, and knew immediately what the brothers' game was. She thought it best not to dispute it. "Get up," Eurus ordered.
Greg had done them both a favour, however, by leaving behind a few more cold cases for the young detective. It should hopefully keep him out of trouble and make the DI's crime figures shoot down.
Earlier, he had gone down to the lab for a bit, placing the cartilage Mycroft had picked up from Molly and dropped off for him a few days ago into a mortar and began crushing it into dust. He’d planned on comparing it to other substances John had accumulated from somewhere, but, before he could put it on the slide to analyse it properly, he found that he couldn’t be bothered and headed back upstairs to find John.
“Clever huh? I thought you would be impressed.” He tapped the black box to release the rest of the cuffs and helped him to his feet. “Now since we’re up here some of the equipment needs cleaning. I am willing to do my fair share, but you will be doing the same. That table with the cloths I’ve already got out is where you will start. You have half an hour.”
"Sherlock, we are on holiday, but this needs saying. I don't know if I can go on like this. With you."
It was well over an hour later that Greg stood in the observation room beside where Sherlock was now being interviewed. The boy had calmed down massively in a few minutes, he'd only held Donovan off for so long to give him some time to come to his senses. Despite calming down, it was clear Sherlock hadn't. He refused to answer any of the female Dom's questions and for most of them didn't even listen.
Eventually there was a quiet croak from the floor and Sherlock’s arms went back to his neck. ‘I’m sorry, sir.’
“Why don’t you want to be?”
"Holmes," Irene growled in Sherlock's direction but she grabbed Mycroft around the throat.
John smirked out of the corner of his mouth, waiting.
John couldn’t believe his eyes; his sub had got into his present position without being told. He knew this wouldn’t last. Not only was this Sherlock, but it was only the second day. No sub had ever done that automatically on the second day without external interference, but he was going to enjoy it while it lasted.
She dragged him to his feet and threw him over the desk. Irene reached over and shoved her fist into his curls instead.
She nodded once and then hurried off.
"Do your shirt up and unpack that bag. I will be back, do not leave this room."
10 minutes later saw John, Mycroft and Greg walking back down the beach with their ice creams. Sherlock was with them, but both his hands were in his pockets.
Smiling slightly lopsidedly, he clambered up onto the soft mattress.
Greg nodded once. "I suppose that's one downside of you not being in your suits. You don't actually choke when I grab your collar dressed like that."
At that Sherlock struggled, Irene pushed down with her foot harder. "Keep still!"
Sherlock nodded. “Of course.” He glanced at John over his shoulder as Finn dragged him towards the sand trucks.
"You in a good mood this morning?"
He let himself say, "Ow." With Eurus playing the game, he wasn't sure how to behave, so he decided to take the middle ground.
“And judging by your attitude so far, you have been punished before, whether it be more intense than what you have received just now or less.”
Finn held his finger to his lips and pulled his hand out from his trousers. In it was a pack of chocolate chips from the cupboard that he had hidden from the doctor.
Mycroft didn't comment, just finished the rest of his ice cream.
"Oh, that was fast. Come kneel over here in front of me." John leant forward and rested his elbows on his knees.
Irene was waving the parachute about. "Shall we?"
When John caught him up, Sherlock dropped to his knees and buried his head into John’s trousers, seeking comfort.
He fell to the shower floor without a moments hesitation. He loved the feel of John's hands in his hair but he would much rather the roles were reversed.
Sherlock frowned. "Um… sorry."
Sherlock froze, thinking. “Yes, sir.”
Mycroft watched as the doctor dragged Sherlock from the sitting room. He hadn't realised his jaw had dropped until Greg tapped it shut.
"Wha-" The sub shut his mouth before he could get in trouble. The next thing he knew, his erection was being fed into a fleshlight.
Slowly, Sherlock slid from the sofa, but the pair were interrupted by a phone call.
“What happened? He’s probably just sulking. Did you argue?”
John gripped his hand in his curls and pulled his head back at an uncomfortable angle.
"There you go. That's better. Do you have any idea what that does to me?" John asked as he massaged Sherlock's scalp.

“Protect me, sir.”
Sherlock shook his head vehmenantly.
A deep chuckle came from across the room and the Superintendent looked over at Mycroft, still swaying to himself.
"Because you love her."
As he rolled out of bed to get dressed and ready for the day, he contemplated what sort of a mood he was going to be in. He was nearly one hundred percent sure it was not going to be anywhere near as good as it had been when he had come out of Panic the day before.
"Come on. Let's catch them up." John tugged Sherlock's hand and pulled him into a jog.
"Hmm." Sherlock smiled. "And John will help him. Yes, she's just sane enough to know that much."
“What did I tell you would happen if you came without permission?”
“We could go to Angelos?” Sherlock suggested crashing the truck into Finn’s foot.
"Take them to their cell, make them comfortable," Eurus ordered, leaning against the desk and folding her arms.
This chapter is unbetad and I only read through it once as I wanted to get it out there so please ignore mistakes, they're all mine!
"I did not give you permission to speak. If you feel as if you are going into Panic you will tell me immediately and I will deal with the situation, but until that point you will obey me."
Siger smiled. "Trust me. His sulks can't be any worse than yours were." He held out his arm and Mrs. Hudson took it, then they headed downstairs.
Greg turned to give him a questioning look and as soon as their eyes met, Sherlock took off at a run. The detective had to get away. He couldn't face the prospect of failure.
With a silent groan, he jumped from the branch he had been sat on and rolled to his feet.
John took another sip of his coffee and laughed. "See?"
He returned with a glass of water.
Now Sherlock opened the door, but he didn't want to leave and he didn't want to admit this man - this ordinary man had grabbed his attention.
“Of course. Child’s play.”
Mycroft to the rescue.
"Come on, babe, we can go back outside and get ice cream." The doctor glanced to the other couple for help.
“That was awful,” he muttered staring into the swirling liquid.

When he hesitated, she pulled him back enough to make the clamps pull even tighter and he opened his mouth immediately.
With a heavy sigh of his own, Sherlock bent over, unlaced his shoe and handed it to the DI. As he did so, he glanced around the older man in search of his Dom.
He needed to pinpoint where it was coming from, so he set up a few scans that he hoped would help.
Greg wanted nothing more than for the doctor to be a sub right now. At least then he could gain some control over the situation.
one. The one who had so much patience and seemed to understand him even if he didn’t know why.
"If I'm caught by some… psychopath that needs information only I know?"
John waited for him to calm enough to speak.
There was no response and Mycroft sighed. He glanced down at where he could imagine his feet were in the dark. He pulled his shoes off and then his socks. He pushed he shoes over Sherlock's feet and pulled the socks over his hands like mittens.
The younger man tightened his grip in his hair. "Be quiet, boy, and get to it, or you'll find yourself in a similar position to your brother."
“Grandad needs a spade too,” Finn decided on the spot.
Sherlock closed his eyes, pissed off his brother hadn't followed the plan at all so far.
“Can you let go of me, beautiful?” he asked softly when the crying had slowed down to a much calmer pace.
“Arrest them both!” Mycroft yelled running in behind the officers. He was wearing a stab vest as a precaution over his suit as he rushed straight over to Sherlock even before Moriarty had been properly disarmed.
Mycroft hugged Greg goodbye at the secure compound. Sherlock hugged John and Rosie. After last time, they all understood the futility of avoiding the trip to Sherrinford. At least with their boyfriends and Rosie at the compound, they could hope they would be safe.
"For being you!" Eurus snapped. "For being my brothers. For whatever reason I desire."
When they reached the kitchen, John wrapped the end of the leash around one of the cupboard doors.
"These are recent," Mycroft pointed out. "That one was at the park last weekend when Rosie sat in that sheep dung and squealed for hours."
John laughed softly and added a second finger to his boy's hole, causing him to groan. "You love this even though nothing can come of it, don't you?"
“Am I indeed?” Mycroft glanced over Finns head at his brother who was sniggering. “Do you think your... daddy should join in?”
It took a long while but eventually John turned around to face his boy. "You ok?"
John glanced over and saw the government official's face. "If only this one was that easy."
Sherlock shifted and turned, trying to get free. Eventually, Mycroft kicked him in the back of the leg and knocked him to his knees.
“Shh,” John soothed. “You alright, pet?”
“You don't get to dictate what I do and do not do, boy,” John pointed out. “You'd think after 6 weeks, you would know that by now.”
Sherlock smiled up at him dopily and the Dom stopped him ducking his head by putting his finger under his chin. "Are you in subspace?"
He could see why he was in these clothes as well. It didn’t matter that he wore them, but he felt like some sort of chastised teenager. It did make it easier to run, John was a doctor, hence the idea of making him use trainers, but the rest of it seemed odd. There weren’t many people walking around Baker Street at this time of the afternoon, but those that were didn’t pay much attention. Sherlock found that he seemed to have a humiliation kink developing. Dammit! Did John already know? Or was this something that Sherlock now had to sit on the fence about, tell the man that had collared him or not?
They could both sense the shift in the doctor's mood and kept silent, waiting for him to say something first.
John followed the detective over to the body laid prone on the floor, he watched his boy crouch down and then lowered himself to one knee, grimacing as he did, he missed Sherlock’s concerned glanced and pushed his stick out of the way.
“You’re both ridiculous,” Siger couldn’t help but point out.
"I don't know, I almost feel sorry for them."
The Dom removed the chains from the bench but left them between his hands and feet as he dragged him over to the bed and pulled him up on it. "Here we are again," he said.
"No, sir, I'm not!" He said, pulling off Sherlock's cock.
“No, boy. You do not speak. I’m going to go over the rules for the next several days and you shall abide by them or so help me I’ll do that to you every half an hour.”
They both nodded once, accepting the rare apology at face value.
The sub tried to kick out but his feet were chained to the bed and his hands were cuffed tightly behind him.
“You misunderstand, pet,” John interrupted him. He saw the worry on Sherlock’s face and reached down to cup his cheek. “Look at me, Sherlock,” he ordered. Tense, but unwilling to ignore the Dom, Sherlock met his eyes. “I was talking about subspace, not me.”
“If you help me prepare lunch. How’s that sound?”
Mycroft stopped sucking immediately.

When they reached the playroom, John shoved the detective to his knees while he thumbed in the code, then he dragged the awkward knee-walking detective inside. "Position,
Mycroft tried to nod, but couldn't. "Yes, sir." He breathed a small sigh of relief when his Dom released his grip on his hair.
Greg found himself more than willing to turn his back on the doctor for his cuffs to be undone. As soon as they were he wrapped his hand around his cock and sighed.
John untied him from the table and ordered him to his feet. He had been planning to let the boy kneel until he had finished making the breakfast but after that comment he could be on it longer.
The sub grunted around his gag in response.
Sherlock sidestepped her and looked around the whole flat.
“Well then, we’ll be spending some time in the playroom after breakfast.”
“Moved?” John was seriously confused and knowing he was the one who had messed up wasn’t helping.
John nodded to himself, then ran his finger around the sub's hole. Abruptly, he pushed it in as far as it would go, enjoying the gasp that Greg let out.
John ignored him, just gripped the rail tight.
John marched over and shut the windows with a slam. “Don’t even try!” John barked, knowing full well Sherlock was on his feet and by the door already.
"You alright now?"
John watched as the sub obeyed and threw it on the pile with his other clothes.
Sherlock refused to obey. John could see the obvious fight in him. The submissiveness was tugging him towards John’s lap, but the rebelliousness within him was pushing him away. It was a dangerous combination.
"No, sir."
"Do you want me to drag you to the room my submissive is hanging in and spank you there?"
"Ow!" The doctor yelled out in surprise. "You little shit." Before the doctor could say anything else, Greg was beside him and pushing a ring gag into Sherlock's mouth.
"Be quiet, boy."
Mycroft glanced at it and sighed, he'd used a similar one on Greg before. "Sir, you don't-"
“You’ve signed the contract, boy. You have your safe word and you have the contract word.” If Sherlock ever said the contract word, he would phone Mycroft straight away, but somehow he knew deep down that Sherlock wouldn’t say it. He may have just been in trouble, but he was starting to settle in.
"Open doggy."
Greg had walked off several feet because he had lost it completely. He bent over double laughing. God, Sherlock was a handful. Thank God he belonged to John.
Sherlock heard his brother talking to Greg behind him. "I didn't expect you to be here, Greg."
Mycroft smirked as he stepped back. "No, but there's a woman coming towards us, I'd prefer if she thought you were gay."
Sherlock was distracted by the seagulls hovering over the shoreline. "There must be whitebait down there," he said clapping his hands.
Sherlock approached him, albeit cautiously.
“This one did.”
Mrs Hudson brought her fingers to her lips. "Oh, dear."
“Irene was just saying how she'd like to watch a scene between us, pet. Maybe we could watch theirs-”
"It's okay. It's not your fault. We have to be understanding with him and let the adults handle it when something like this happens," Greg told her. “Come on, let’s build that spaceship Finn liked.”
John glanced down at Sherlock. It was clear he was thinking the same thing. John reached up and removed his gag once again.
"Truthfully?"
“No,” the Dom said, walking off up the corridor to find Greg.
“I’m sorry, sir,” he sobbed openly. “I didn’t mean to disappoint you.”
"Get off," Sherlock growled, wiggling as much as he could, at the feel of something hard against his entrance. John tutted and whacked his arse with his open palm, watching as the brat stilled. He waited to see if he'd pick up his struggle again, but when he didn't, continued forcing something hard into his arse.
“Well, your wrist needs a few days to recover and you are incredibly bruised all over. It is going to be a few days before we play again. You’ll spend those few days in bed-”
John tugged his head back by a finger in the loop on his collar.
“No. I don’t know who told you that, pet, but they are wrong. You’re not there to beat and kick when I am in a foul mood. You’re there to be treasured. Yes, sometimes Doms need ‘Space like you need yours, but that doesn’t have to be through a cane or a whip. It should be through something light like bondage which I believe you enjoy, according to your contract.”
"What was that, pet?"
"I'll take your word for it... for now." John laced their fingers together and decided to just enjoy the moment.
Sherlock shrugged, his shoulders shifting oddly with the way he was bound.
They widened even more so now.
"She's coming too," John said simply.
“I’m sorry, sir.”
"I'm sorry, mistress," he ground out.
Finn’s bottom lip was trembling when Sherlock reached him. It nearly broke Sherlock’s heart.
“Please, sir, may I suck you?”
With a smirk, John shifted as close to him as he could get. His boy was leaving everything in his hands, just as he had suspected. "Then we'll stay here until I feel every one of your knotted muscles relax."
Sherlock nodded. “I mean… yes, sir.”
Now, the boy looked up at him. “Can I, sir?” He hadn't been down there in so long, he hadn't forgotten about it, per se, but he had expected it not to get used at all.
He was most surprised when his sub sobbed into his neck.
“Sir- I do want half now. I didn’t mean what I said. It’ll be too much tonight. Please, sir.”
Eurus laughed. "I'm well aware of that. But you don't need to be an idiot to be manipulated by me."
“Put your hands down now and up on your feet.” He placed his arms beneath Sherlock’s and helped him up. “Slip out of these.” He tugged at one of the legs, then he crouched down with a pair of the sub’s high-quality trousers. “Left.” After lifting his left foot up, John indicated the other one. After doing the same again, he pulled Sherlock’s trousers up and pushed his shirt in.
"Mycroft, please," she begged, turning to him in desperation.
Now, the younger sub began to grin… this was becoming more interesting by the second, but that didn't mean that this jerk wasn't an idiot.
It wasn't that far into the meal that Sherlock started trying to shift his hips from side to side, trying to get some friction from the dildo that was rubbing up inside him. If he had to go through this every meal… if he wasn't caged it would have been different.
John thought that was the end of it, but Sherlock seemed to want to get the last worst in. He sniffed, “I also know you didn’t make it home last night.”
"Do we feel sorry for them?"
Sherlock tried ducking out of it and John clocked him up the side of his head. "Behave, boy, or we can go back to enema time." That actually did the trick, much to John's surprise. Sherlock went still and let him secure the blindfold. "Wise choice, pet," the doctor said, patting Sherlock's cheek.
"Can you do two at once?" Eurus asked.
"Dammit, Eurus! Come get these cuffs off of him before you cause him permanent damage!"
Greg had stopped stripping at his pants but he'd ordered Mycroft to take his off too. John did the same, and got Sherlock to strip down to nothing.
“No!”
"Until I've decided you won't lie to me anymore and that the sentence there has drilled it into your head that your health and wellbeing is my number one concern."
“You’ll iron these so they are perfectly flat. And trust me when I say I know what decent ironing looks like.”
Sherlock gaped at his brother. It was odd seeing Mycroft use force against anyone, and he was doing it for him.
"Do you not find it cute when they do that? Glare at you like they think it will make a difference… apart from making things worse."
"You'll do what I say, when I say. You won't hesitate or deviate. You will be respectful to your brother and address me and Greg as sir at all times, Sherlock. At all times."
"I can see that." Sherlock observed his brother’s countenance and, much to his surprise, saw nothing there but approval.
"Hmm," John ran his hand through his hair. "I didn't think so. Go and get me a beer."
Then he smirked and pushed him towards the bedroom.
“What makes a pearl. Do they just appear?”
"I can't remember. It was insignificant."
John had watched his sub process everything that had just happened and what had been said. He could see the cogs and wires twist and flair as he realised the truth in the Dom’s words, but that surprised him. He dropped his hand on his sub’s head. “Good boy. Now are you going to eat without a fuss?”
“Better than the British Government,” Sherlock pointed out.
"I know what you're up to, Sherlock."
“I didn’t meant to make him mad,” Beth whispered, she was sat on Greg’s lap.
"What will you give me if I stop?"
“What?” Sherlock asked seeing the look on his brother's face immediately.
"He is," Sherlock said with a wince. "More than experience, in fact."
It wasn’t that much longer than the first half of Sherlock’s trip before the detective came in through the door.
"I've been sneaking down to the play room at night, practicing my techniques. I couldn't wait to try them out on Mycroft." The Superintendent beamed and leaned forward to kiss his boy on the lips.
“Have you… you know?” Greg tilted his head in Sherlock’s direction.
Happy that his sub’s wrists couldn’t separate no matter how much he struggled, John pushed him down to the floor, away from the glass, his head twisting sideways on the carpet.
“No, sir.”
“Come forward, beside the chair. I'm going to prepare our meal. Then you are going to kneel there and not complain. My leniency concerning your meals of late will be forgotten.”
The younger man looked away, tucking his head into John’s neck. He didn’t see the smack the kneeling man received. “I apologise, sir,” he said to the doctor. “For the way I acted last night.”
Both of them were led down a familiar corridor, one that led to the governor's office.
"I'd have to put him under the jail," Greg finished.
He hadn’t been fast enough once, long ago when a previous sub had gone into Panic and he had ended up doing real damage to himself. John didn’t fancy Sherlock’s chances with broken glass on the floor. He reached out and grabbed Sherlock’s flailing wrists. He pushed them together in front of him and activated the locking mechanisms inside the cuffs. The detective continued to fight and growl words, some more coherent than others. The Dom was sure he had heard some “sorry”s in amongst it, but couldn’t work out why.
"Kiss me," the Superintendent ordered.
Sherlock was sat bolt upright, not moving. John cupped the back of his neck with his hand and encouraged him down, automatically his legs flipped up on to the sofa and his head lowered to his lap and he did it all unprotesting, much to John’s surprise.
“But you love it.”
“Come on then.” He began copying the details into his phone. “I'll trace him with this, it's a little more lightweight.”
Sherlock closed his eyes. Not through choice! His scream was internal, which was probably a good thing.
Sherlock groaned as the doctor stretched his leg out. He disappeared for a second before carrying in a pack. The sub recognised it as his med pack. John pulled a pair of scissors free and began cutting up the inside of his trouser leg. It became clear immediately that he'd turned over on his ankle and yanked his knee in the process.
Mycroft glanced over to where the Dom was pointing. He didn't like the look of the little mud box that he would be kneeling in. He poked at the dirt with his toes. It didn't feel squishy, just a bit soft and well turned. He stepped onto it gingerly and lowered himself to a kneeling position.
Greg glanced at John who nodded. "We will go next door. Do not get up, pet," John ordered the detective.
“Don't tell me there is nothing you can do, either!” John snapped. “You're an Inspector! That means something.”
When they emerged, Sherlock looked especially pale, but determined. He walked Finn back over to the group. Crouching down, he looked him in the eyes. "If it gets to be too much, tell John and Mrs. Hudson will bring you back out here."
“No. Not at all. Finn’s adoption has gone through. My concern was them losing out on Finn if social services thought they were biting off more than they could chew.”
Sherlock got to his feet and lunged at the Dominatrix, Mycroft had predicted it, however, and intervened, grabbing his brother and pulling his arms around behind him. "Stop, baby brother, just stop."
At that Sherlock began thrashing, the Dom merely sighed. He put him down before they reached the stairs and pulled his leash from his pocket. In no time he had Sherlock’s feet chained to his wrists and was dragging him up the stairs. He was just dead weight now, far heavier just less awkward.
Sherlock blinked several times before climbing back to his feet. It took a moment for him to feel stable. It was strange, he felt as if he wasn't alone. He took a few steps into the room more, to look around and truly check he was on his own. He looked over the console at all the different switches and buttons, but for once he kept his hands to himself. God knows what any of it did.
“I would keep your tally low if I were you, pet. You’ll no doubt double it tonight.”
"I'm sorry, sir?"
Back to being stubborn again, Sherlock folded his arms once more. “For all you know I might not really need to go.”
The two Doms followed Mycroft from the room.
This chapter could be triggery, so I give you fair warning, and please please please do not leave negative comments about it, it was hard enough to write as it is!
When he was done, John kissed him again and noticed that his vision was a lot more focused now and he was looking around less drowsily; more dazed and confused.
Sherlock could think of many loopholes already, did this man seriously kill 4 people? And did he seriously think he could outwit Sherlock Holmes the only consulting detective in the world. “Why should I? I’ve got nothing to go on. What’s in it for me?”
Several hours later and John had decided he wanted to walk along the beach again and Greg seemed to agree.
"Ice cream."
The detective worried as they walked towards the crime scene. He loved holding John’s hand, it made him feel equal in a way he had never felt with a Dom before, but he didn’t know if he could keep hold of his temper if Donovan started making comments about it. If he couldn’t keep on top of his temper, he would disappoint John, the only Dom he had actually cared about disappointing. However, he was faced with a dilemma, he didn’t want to let go of his hand because he didn’t want to upset the older man either. He didn’t want him thinking he didn’t like it anymore because he really did, even in public it wasn’t bothering him like he thought it would.
“You could have warned me, brother dear.” He glared at the government official who just raised an eyebrow in response.
"I'm keeping it simple. Really simple. He has to prove himself with the little things."
The sub ducked his head again, this was ridiculous. He knew ducking his head was a bad idea when he could see what his Dom was doing and that made him even more uncomfortable. He sighed in relief when the washing machine beeped and John got to his feet.
“Come here,” John ordered.
quick. Odd, he wanted to be here? Well things had clearly changed since his last attempt, or even since his first attempt.
"Are you tied up?"
The detective landed sideways with a thud.
"Now!"
The detective sighed. "Mycroft's right. I've been a brat."
"Gorgeous," she whispered.
Mycroft cleared his throat as if he wanted to say something.
"Finn?" John called softly into the dark bedroom. He didn't get a response, but he wasn't very surprised. In the gloom, he could see the little boy curled up in the middle of their bed, his arm over his head.
He didn't do anything, just looked like he was ready to chat. The guns weren't bothering him at all? Sherlock laughed, they were more similar than he thought.
"Mycroft, make yourself useful," the Superintendent ordered, "set up a pepper enema for your brother."
John crawled out and stood before he received the same treatment.
"Woo hoo. Boys!" their landlady called out. "Now where did they go?"
“Why?” He snapped.
“Sherlock laughed so hard the juice he was drinking at the time came out his nose and went all over the sandwiches.”
The doctor laughed. “I’ll try and remember that. See you later.”
John just smiled, watching his boyfriend eat the rest of his toast and then demand another slice. If Sherlock was eating, John was going to give him what he wanted.
"Lab, sir. Experimenting."
Sherlock kept himself still. Despite what he wanted, he would protect Mycroft, and that meant doing as he was told.
Soon they were in the play room again. John took him straight to the punishment side of the room.
John glanced at Sherlock immediately concerned. Sherlock got to his feet to pick up the boy, but he moved away from the detective, wanting John instead.
"Can he call me that?" She asked of Irene.
Sherlock let himself be moved about willingly, not resisting in the least. He wanted to bury his face in John's belly, but wanted to show that he could obey more.
With a defeated sigh, Sherlock grabbed his rucksack, hoping his brother’s men had already dealt with his cases. He hated unpacking. It was tedious.
"How about you, Mr. Holmes?" John asked. "Will you be staying? You're more than welcome."
“Before you ask, yes, these little holes are everywhere.” He used his control box to activate the magnet and the leash pulled taught.
“Sir? You said I’m fine now. We don’t need to use the bed anymore.” It was where he’d been punished in the evening. John had made him comfy and used his hand. He also hadn’t done it for the first few days after he’d been hurt.
Eventually he had eaten everything John had wanted him to eat, but he was left there while the Dom cleared up.
Sherlock glared up at the greying haired man in annoyance.
“Don’t know what?”
Mycroft found himself wishing he could prevent this happening every month. But unless he felt like putting Greg, John and Rosie through some unknown hell the pair of them would have to endure.
“Don’t you?”
Minutes later and he still hadn’t stopped thrashing about.
"What is it, pet?"
Greg flicked at the sub's cock irritating it as he put on and took off peg after peg after peg. He turned at a sound from his own sub. "Problem, boy?" he asked Mycroft.
“Sherlock, tell them what happened when we were on the beach when we were young. With the seagull and the tent.”
Sherlock moaned, leaning into John as much as his restraints would allow. He wanted to be surrounded by his Dom, comforted, forgiven. He'd give anything to be able to beg.
Mrs. Hudson reached over and rubbed the only part of Finn's back that was exposed. He was such a dear child.
Sherlock had rounded the corner in a hurry to get home, back on the ground again rather than across the buildings, he preferred the buildings and wished he’d told John the quickest way was up rather than down here. Even if he had, he doubted if he would have been allowed. Earlier had been an emergency – well a sherlockian emergency, maybe not by an army doctor’s standards. But he had followed, that was amazing.
They slowly lowered him to the floor, it was only when he reached it that he began to rouse.
"I'll get him," Sherlock said, heading after the little boy.
Irene turned her nose up, “You're apologising to your sub?”
Since he’d found working with his brother’s boyfriend in the metropolitan police at New Scotland Yard a sometimes worthy distraction from the ever-present boredom, it had been noticed by said brother’s boyfriend whenever chaos appeared from nowhere, he was always at the centre. That was why he was sat where he was now, the extensive lounge of a well-known professional Dom, no doubt a boring professional Dom, Sherlock was sure.
“Yes, sir,” Sherlock agreed, he daren’t not. John clearly didn’t know who this man was apart from a fellow Dom and he had just lied about how they knew each other. He knew from experience that he daren’t interrupt the man. He had a temper of, well… he was never calm, in fact, this was the calmest he had ever seen the other man.
“Now, open your mouth again and I will gag you.”
Mycroft fetched it and handed it to his Dom.
The sub jerked his head slightly, not willing to offer anymore submission at that point. And his arse was stinging a bit already, he also knew damn well that the Dom would give him another 20.
“Sorry, sir,” he whimpered. The Dom was right, he didn't want more with the cane than he had to, but he knew he deserved it, he'd worried the doctor, this was his way of reminding him of that.
Eurus turned and saw the woman cowering in the corner. She slapped her brother, hard then ordered the Dominatrix to join them.
"You're the one going on about them. Not me. I shut up about them half an hour ago."
"You're going to eat every bite I give you," John ordered when a member of his staff dropped off a tray. "I am leaving the collar on, but if you struggle to swallow you will tell me immediately, do you understand?"
"Excuse me?"
"I can't work out what his problem is," John said, speaking to the Superintendent over top of the suspended brat.
“He’s-”
Mycroft lost his composure when Irene moved around to his front and struck his cock viciously. He brought his knees up reflexively to protect himself and the Dominatrix started flailing at him wildly.
"I told you to be specific, pet," John pointed out. "You get one more chance to tell me what you want."
“But, sir, with respect-”
John briefly patted his head then headed for the door and Mycroft.
“You’re not a dog. You’re a boy who will no doubt run at the first opportunity.”
John reached over and pulled Finn onto his lap. He was surprised the little boy could watch any of this, when he as an adult was feeling sick. There was so many precautions in place for Finn but it seemed it would be the adults who needed it more.
When he was satisfied with his appearance, he walked straight to Sherlock and hauled him to his knees by his curls, not even pausing to let the boy wake up.
"I know you can get out the front door. I know you have probably thought of a million new ways to test the security system. I know you are a hell of a lot faster than me. You won't be going anywhere like that."
“I'm sorry, sir,” Sherlock said quickly, his knees had narrowly missed the doctor, but he had moved all the same.
She stepped forward and gripped his chin in her hand. "Because I told you to and you will obey me."
Sherlock lasted a very long time before John saw him begin to cooperate. Ever so slowly, his hands moved and his fingers locked together behind his head. The Dom moved to remove the boy’s shoes again but all he did was kick out. However, with one sharp, “no!” the lad stilled.
“Yes, sir,” Sherlock nodded. He didn't want to let John down. Not today, not ever again.
Unsure what the Dom had planned, Sherlock obeyed knowing he would soon find out.
When she let it go she reached up to kiss the detective on the lips.
"Irene is under my protection, big brother. You won't hurt her."
John closed his eyes. Of course he was. “Babe, you know what we’ve discussed about all this. I love you. Not this perfect automaton you’re trying to be.”
He nodded.
"It's hardly the same thing," John said gently.
Sherlock smirked down at the boy then looked over his head at John and nodded decisively. "Ok."
“I haven’t really had a proper friend before,” he commented quietly. He stared at the back of the seat in front of him for a moment before looking back out of the window. His thoughts strayed to Redbeard and then to Mycroft… could your brother be your friend? Despite his resentment towards the older Holmes - that was quickly receding - it was almost like they
Greg let out a few deep breaths. "No, sir. But I don't think our subs will let me."
Turning around, Sherlock placed a mug of coffee in Greg's hands. It was just the way he liked it, of course.
Irene didn't bother to respond. She was too angry. "I've never failed to get a reaction. Never!" She shifted her glare to Mycroft. "Explain!'
John retrieved the paddle he planned to use for this instalment and after the first few hits was glad he had offered the younger man the opportunity to halve his punishment and put 10 hours between it.
He left his pet to it, reflecting on everything that had happened. He was greatly relieved that it hadn’t ended badly. It so easily could have and, judging by how easily Sherlock had seemed to slip into Panic, he knew it was going to happen again without a doubt. He also knew how to deal with it.
Going over to their bags, John dug out a specially formulated lube. It was one that was designed for BDSM usage and it provided a nice burn when used with a dildo. He decided it would make a nice addition to the fucking his boy was going to get from the machine. He deserved it with his current attitude.
“Wooo. But you come too.”
“Mmm?”
"I want him up in the air, with that cock hanging down for easy access." John gave the back of his boy's neck a squeeze.
In response, John plucked the rope connecting Sherlock's cock to the weight below.
He nodded his agreement. John set about getting his other arm into the sleeve and then buttoned it up.
"Git," John told his boyfriend with a wink for Finn.
Mycroft obeyed his commands without question just as Greg's office phone buzzed.
As soon as it penetrated John's sleep muddled mind what had been going on, he had to stifle a laugh. "Carry on, Greg. Do you mind if I watch? It might be relaxing."
John wanted nothing more than to ask his boy to not call him that for a while. But he was 99% sure, he would freak out if he said it. "Do you think you can sleep now, really sleep, and not lay there worrying and overthinking things?"
“But-”
Greg nodded, and went off in search of one.
“Yes, sir,” he said but it was half hearted at best.
"Tut tut, boy. I might let you beg me not to in a while."
Sherlock glanced up and caught his Dom’s eye. The look clearly said he’d be there a while. The sub had already angered the older man enough that morning. He had been trying to get a rise out of the older man. He wouldn’t say he’d got it, but he knew to mess up now might have drastic consequences for his arse later.
“Yes, sir.”
That was what John needed to see; an apology that wasn’t forced or on the other end of a threat or punishment. The ones that came with no provocation were the apologies that meant the most.
Sherlock shivered. "This is just creepy."
"Thank you, sir," his voice was bitter but John would leave it at that for now.
The blond tutted internally, he brat was just being difficult. He wasn’t scared at all. So the Dom had been worrying for no reason. “And another 5,” he growled, deciding on the spot to drop the ‘soft’ edge that was beginning to hinder their progress.
Sherlock shifted in John's arms. "What about-"
The doctor left him for a moment and then reappeared with the curtains which he set up over the ironing board.
“I apologise, sir. I had assumed that Sherlock would tell you.”
Sherlock made a point to sniff again. “Oh and I think it just vaporised. May I go in?” he asked pleasantly.
He shrugged off his jacket and draped it around his brother's shoulders, then he wrapped his arm around him.
“Answer me, Boy!”
“I don't know,” he huffed in annoyance. “I couldn't keep track of the route. I was taken to this warehouse, there was an Irishman there.”
Sherlock took a couple of steps backwards, stunned. He shook his head, John had... the no beatings... after everything that day.... all John had said... he was going to- the- he couldn’t cope with this, he spun on his toe and raced off down the hall, in the direction of somewhere he could hide.
"And I'm loving it, but, yeah, it really is outer space themed, complete with a police box."
With a snort, the Superintendent went and fetched a gag. He tossed it back and forth from one hand to the other as he approached his sub.
“He doesn’t have Doms. So who are you?”
“Sir,” Sherlock interrupted yet again. “You’re rambling.”
Irene looked up in shock. She wasn't the only one. If the two kneeling men could look over to express their confusion they would have done.
Irene let her eyebrow raise in amazement. "Wow, that must have been some shag."
"Seeing and not observing, brother dear," he returned his attention back out the window.
"John, I refuse to be scared by something just because you cannot wrap your head around it."
“Good boy. Leave them up there or I’ll cuff your hands behind you.”
The two Doms gathered the chips up and wandered after their boys, smiling to see them so happy.
“You will give me a suitable answer, pet, or you can go back to copying that dictionary. How far did you get? D?”
“Luck,” Sherlock countered. He eyed the rest of the room, he didn't need to find a way out, he could see the door.

“It’s not your first day anymore.”
“You aren't getting my cock, boy. No way. That's something you would enjoy and you're still on punishment, remember?”
“Yes, sir?” Sherlock’s voice trembled as he responded to his Dom.
John glanced up, still holding Sherlock's hand beneath the table. “What's that?”
“Like I said, it’s fine Greg. Why don’t you bring the seat over?”
Sensing the fact the two brothers wouldn't win, Mycroft pushed himself up to his knees.
John noted the sound of true distress coming from his boy. "You thought we were going to have what? It's ok to answer. You won't get in trouble."
They all headed out the door and took the path down to the beach. The wind blew, causing Sherlock's curls to wave around wildly. Greg and Mycroft walked hand in hand. John walked next to his sub, close enough for their arms to brush together from time to time.
He couldn’t order Sherlock to make it like he had said he would earlier. He still doubted whether his sub could form a sentence, let alone make lunch, especially if he wasn’t very good at it like he claimed. He wouldn’t enjoy it enough for it to bring him out of subspace and it would likely put him into a deep subdrop.
John wasn’t. “Well, stop. Not only is he an Inspector, he’s a Dominant. Your brother’s Dominant.”
“Yes, sir, one, sir. May I please have another?”
“Ah, hello John, good to see you. You too, Sherlock.”
John pulled the boy close, using the rope. “Undo my zipper, boy.”
As they were hurried down the corridor to their cell, Sherlock pulled away from his guard's grip. "I know the way," he said angrily. "There's no need to put on a show for them, I'm not trying to get away."
"There's some in the box," Eurus said, watching closely. "And why do you keep saying bought? I haven't bought anything. I don't have money."
When John got in from the shops all he wanted to do was relax, maybe have a cup of tea with his sub knelt by his feet and a surgeon's hand pushing through the mess of curls that was Sherlock’s hair, but the detective was nowhere in sight.
Sherlock glanced up, the first time he'd looked away from his waffles since they'd been revealed. “No!” He hated that idea. He wasn't
“Yes, sir.”
As they entered the kitchen, Sherlock noted only one place set with food.
Greg glanced at Sherlock and shook his head once.
