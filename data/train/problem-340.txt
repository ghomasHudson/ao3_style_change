I soon found Watson’s companionship indispensable. As a military man, he understood the importance of utter loyalty, both to one’s compatriots and to one’s objective: you never abandoned your fellow soldier to peril, you never lost sight of your mission, and retreat was unthinkable. The majority of my cases were (to my mind) simple, and lacking in life-threatening scenarios, but when a lowlife is ready to carry out another murder in order to hide the ones he has already committed and levels his pistol at you, you want a man like Watson at your side, because you know then that the villain will be dispatched.
That evening after dinner, we relaxed in the sitting room before a crackling wood fire. Each of us had his glass of brandy, and was enjoying a cigarette. Not too long ago, these comforts would have been all we needed to be utterly content, but having given ourselves up to lust, we now found ourselves craving an additional earthly pleasure. Even though we’d had quite a lot of each other that morning, a day of errands and leisure made it seem years ago.
I was so dizzy with the thrill of being opened up and explored inside, I barely noticed that he was not sucking me anymore, but focusing entirely on postillioning me. This was fine, as it allowed me to concentrate fully on this new kind of pleasure. He massaged me all around inside, encouraging my body to relax enough to take even more. By now, I was not so much inhaling as sobbing, and not so much exhaling as moaning.
I can tell you that it was not obvious to me at all. A low womb? A very masculine man? How to identify these accurately?
Watson’s decision that the time was right came not a moment too soon, for we had just two more days in our liminal seaside cottage, before we would be returning to London. But having judged this the appropriate night, he strove to make everything perfect: a fire had been laid to warm the bedroom so that we might go about undressed and above the covers, and he saw that we were both fed but not languid with being overfull, and not too tired from the day’s exploring. Watson declared that we would bathe together again, and then at last,
Some might say those qualities are not compatible, but I concluded it immediately when he entered the chemical laboratory at Bart’s. I never told him what I had observed: that he had cleared the room the moment he stepped inside. I watched Watson as he moved swiftly through the doorway, not lingering in it; his eyes flicked to each corner of the room, beginning with the nearest, and then up to sweep the ceiling; as he stepped fully inside, he took note of the narrow windows in the basement room, and positioned himself near enough to me to be properly introduced, but where he could not fall victim to a sniper’s bullet.
That afternoon, a client paid a visit, a woman named Elizabeth Hayes who was convinced she was being followed through the streets of Camden by the ghost of her aunt, who had died eight years ago. I interviewed her for nearly an hour, collecting all the relevant data I could about the possible means and motivations for such a strange state of affairs.
Our train was delayed, so we did not arrive at Folkestone Central station until dinnertime. Waugh’s cottage was a short stroll from the station, and we only took enough time to set down our luggage before heading out in search of a chophouse; on the way, we joked about how, lacking a housekeeper, we would be hard-pressed just to keep ourselves upright, warm, and fed during our holiday.
I had never been so near to one before, even my own, which was easily enough gripped, but by necessity remained farther from my eyes. How dazzlingly obscene Watson’s tumescence was, up close! Wet and rubicund and throbbing and hot, so much more than even my lascivious imaginings, so real and vulgar and thrumming, so proud and straight when erect. His bollocks were drawn up tightly to his body. I watched them quiver whenever I touched him in particularly sensitive spots. I played with his foreskin, pushing it back and forth over the crown, watching the fluid well up at the tip, then spill over.
It was so big, though – an object of this size was surely no place to begin. I carefully set aside my favourite and picked through the other articles until I found a more modestly-sized one that was smooth and appealing – it was ivory, thicker than one of my fingers but not so thick as two. Still, I would need something to help it go in. I discarded my dressing gown as I made my way to my little table, where I poked around in my disguise kit until I found my tin of cold cream. It was slick and greasy, and I believed it would do the job sufficiently well.
The following morning, I had already been sitting at the breakfast table with the newspaper for an hour when I heard Watson begin to stir upstairs. I spent the next twenty minutes steeling myself for the moment of his arrival, practicing at behaving the way I had done in his presence for the last several years. At last, he came down to join me, and I wished him a good morning as if nothing untoward had happened the night before. Being a more proper gentleman than I, Watson always came to breakfast fully dressed, down to his jacket. That morning, I was for the first time despondent about his never having picked up my habit of lounging about in nightshirt and dressing gown when feeling particularly lazy and purposeless, as such a habit would have enabled me to see an inch or two more of his bare skin, and to feel the intimacy of seeing him rumpled, softened, disheveled.
The man had me dead to rights. Was I truly ready for what I longed for so desperately? I had thought I was, but now my ardour was being put to the test. “So I should just…” I inclined my head to indicate my prick. He nodded.
But it was not so easy as that. Despite my efforts, I could not free myself from the desires roiling in me despite every defence I’d trained into myself against them. Many was the day I found myself staring at Watson’s reflection in some surface, so that I might look my fill without seeming suspect. Many was the night when I awoke freezing, the sheets having been kicked away, and wished for his body against mine to warm me. When I did give in entirely, and touched myself to thoughts of him, I did it for an extravagant amount of time, which was my compromise for doing it far less frequently than I desired to: if I was going to ruin myself with self-abuse, I might as well make the most of each transgression, and linger on vague but enthralling fantasies of his body, his voice, his touch – his adoration.
I fumbled about until I found the tin of cold cream, then held it out to him with a shaking hand, and he grabbed it and applied it generously to himself. Just watching him handle his prick for the time it took to smear the cold cream on it was enough to make me think my heart would burst. He took a better stance, spreading his legs and leaning over me to kiss me deeply.
Not so long ago, I would have found all of these activities – visiting a seaside resort, relaxing in the fresh air, eating – so tedious individually, and practically unbearable when combined, but today I could think of no better way to pass the time, enjoying Watson’s companionship with no interruptions. It was particularly enjoyable to watch him as he ate, his fingers touching his mouth, his tongue darting out to collect crumbs or stray drops of cherry juice.
He was hitting just the perfect spot now, and I let my arms fall to my sides, and my head dropped back down to the pillow as I breathed, “
He was still for a while, and even when I felt him stir, I wrapped my arms and legs around him to keep him close. But after a time, it became clear that we would have to separate, to wash ourselves a little and lie comfortably. As the perspiration dried on our bodies, I felt Watson’s softening prick being pushed free of me. Not to mention, the prized treasures from the British Museum would need tidying up.
, though since at least the days of Shakespeare, we English have had a clumsier word: dildo. Whether that term comes from the Latin
“I can’t imagine I have much to teach you,” he said with a chuckle. “You’re always reading; between scientific texts and that sensational literature you devour, your knowledge of matters both anatomical and carnal must be encyclopaedic.”
This prompted a low chuckle from Holmes, who guided and directed Watson to sit against the headboard. Holmes could then lay on his back with his head in Watson’s lap. Having settled in, he – to my utter shock – guided Watson’s half-erect instrument right into his mouth! And not only that: he sucked slowly at it for some time, savoring it with his lips and tongue, and made noises like it was delicious, as though sucking and licking it was just the most wonderful thing. It grew more substantial as he worked, until he could fit only perhaps half of it comfortably in his mouth. Watson lamented then, “I remember when all it took was a stiff breeze to give me the most rampant cockstand.”
“There’s no need to distress yourself so,” he said. He held himself around his shaft, then put his hand on my shoulder, though he hardly needed to guide me back to my task; I was eager to try again. He continued to hold his prick, to ensure I would not push myself past my limits of comfort, but also I think because it excited him to direct himself a little, to rub his glistening glans over my wet, swollen lips, before guiding it gently back between them – it excited
Lying on his side next to me, his hand stroking my chest, he asked, “What made you decide to open the trunk after all?”
“Because you’ve got such a big prick.” Holmes seemed a little shy about saying those words, and yet also appeared to relish them as he uttered them.
Watson also had hidden complexities, which delighted me to discover, particularly when I had no case to occupy me and longed for stimulation. Sometimes I would share with him what I had learned, such as in the case of his decision not to invest in South African securities, but other things I kept to myself, such as what the shape of his occipital bone told me. A large cerebellum, which necessitates the extension of the occipital bone backwards and downwards, as was Watson’s situation, is an indicator of an enormous capacity for passion, and an intuition for love and devotion. (This was in stark contrast to my own cerebellum, which was of only moderate size, that being the likely reason for my intellect, my lack of inclination to marry, my fastidiousness, and – according to the manuals of phrenology I had studied – the ability to love but once.) At the time that I had observed Watson’s prominent occipital bone, I justified my saying nothing to him about it on the grounds that he must have been perfectly aware already of all of these qualities he possessed.
Now that we had dirtied the water, it was time to get out. Watson helped me up onto shaky legs. He stepped out first and retrieved one of the enormous bath sheets. Wrapping me up in it, and standing with his face close to mine as if to lecture me, he said, “That was to show you that that place is not just pleasurable for me to ‘use’ or ‘take.’ If done properly, it will be pleasurable for you as well. And I intend to do it properly.”
Watson looked at me as though I had sorely disappointed him. “Now Holmes, I can almost understand why you dislike taking holidays – you need the mental stimulation of work, of course. But it’s nearly August, and already the heat here in London is stifling. One can hardly go out in the street without getting filthy with perspiration, and the smell of horse droppings gets to be unbearable. Surely a visit to the seaside will at least be more comfortable, especially now when you’ve not had a case in some days. When was the last time a Yarder was by?”
We enjoyed a comfortable silence for some time in the growing dark, and then Watson looked up, and pointed out to me the enormous array of stars visible, very few of which we ever got to see in London.
Thank you all so much for having stayed with me and commented and kudos'd and talked to me on twitter, encouraging me to keep writing! I'll never forget your support and it's why instead of listing this as abandoned I have only said I'm on hiatus. I hope that one day in the future, once I can completely separate my story from the BBC show as a whole, that I can come back and finish it. But that won't be for years so I wouldn't hold your breath.
because how he was acting was "sociopathic" and "retarded" depending on the person who decided to insult him. His mother didn't want him to act any different than he did. The only thing she ever stopped was the times when stimuli in the world was too much too fast I need out out away, and he accidentally harmed himself. She would hold him close and tight with his hands firmly clasped in hers to prevent them from ripping at his hair. A reaction he still had these days, albeit he was in much more control of it now.
SHerlock tired quickly tucnking himsefl away when he simultaneouesly took a step away from the tub and over his trousers, falling starhg t intot he shower wall.
He also wondered how Sherlock was doing. Probably conducting some sort of experiment, but John's phone received no alarming texts from him so he was probably fine.
Lestrade motioned to a clipboard on the desk in front of him. "Just sign this and you all are set. I filled out the rest while I was waiting."
So head on it was. Sherlock put his violin and bow away carefully and made his way to his bedroom door. He took a steadying breath then opened it and went inside.
John stifled his laughter around his fist, they still had to keep quiet after all. This man, was ridiculous. John went back to wandering around the room, he knew it would take a while because there was a lot to search through. He knew not to disturb Sherlock, so he played an app on his phone for the next ten minutes.
Lestrade took the clipboard and ripped off the top sheet and handed the bottom carbon copy to the receptionist for hospital records.
"With heroin. A high enough dose to be lethal, and there appears to be some amount of effort to make it look self-induced. Clearly the murderer isn't very bright as he didn't make sure someone left handed used their left hand to inject themselves. The edge of the palm has ink smears, obviously from writing, probably notes at university. He used to be an addict, but hasn't used in some time. He must have left school during the worst of it and re-enrolled recently now that he's clean."
. That level of unreliability must be detrimental to her development. This would definitely sway her toward the side of mistrust in Erikson's psychosocial stages.
One day Joh nw as workign at the counter and heard form the usual station, :"BEt your fag ass can't do anything esle but dance lol."
John snorted and followed Sherlock to the back of the complex. He thought his friend must be looking for the fire escape. "So you really think he's the one?"
When Sherlock went to his mind palace, John took the trash out and settled himself in his chair with his laptop. He had no desire to type up a draft for the case, however, he thought maybe he could write a post about attitudes toward people with substance abuse disorders. He didn't want to give this killer any direct attention, as it's one of the things he wanted. Instead, he'd use the anger to fuel the spread of information and hopefully inform people about what those disorders are like and what recovery looks like. Anything to help get rid of the general public's myths about such things.
The beat of the DDR machine where the crowd is gathered pulls John from his thoughts once more. He looks over and sses one lanky boi o n the blue and pink arrowed flor hitting eahc beat with ease and grace.
I ran a poll on twitter and the majority vote answered "outline" to the question: would you rather someone completely abandon their WIP, or would you rather them update a final time with the outline so you can see how the rest of the story goes?
"One day, I saw a group of flowers across the street. Big purple ones I hadn't seen before. Without thinking I just ran for them, and he followed me like he always does. But there was-" A crack in his voice forced Sherlock to take a breath. "He got hit and didn't make it."
It only took a day for John's curiosity and old feelings to win out over his anger toward Sherlock. He showed up to Baker Street unannounced, and listened to Sherlock's explanation. He would deny it if anyone asked, but he broke down and Sherlock just held him for what seemed like hours but was probably only minutes.
The natural caretaker role Sherlock took on in the last few days was, for lack of a better word, adorable. He did it with single-mindedness and compassion. Never giving up even when learning those new skills were difficult. Because he wanted Ella to be cared for, he didn't want to let her down.
He'd been reading on and off in between cases, but he was always hesitant to start because he usually had to put it down in the middle of an interesting part. Cases weren't exactly on a schedule. However, he was nothing if it not determined.
"Taking the baby and killing so soon after a suspect was in custody was a bit of a beginner's mistake."
Regardless, by the end of the night ehy'sd discovered that the other wanted more and they had arfgreed to bein a committed realationship.
Sherlock furrowed his brows at John in confusion while he started getting Ella buttoned up in her coat and hat.
As with all babies, it wasn't long until she awoke once more. When her cries grew from whimpers to wails, John elbowed Sherlock in the nearest part of his body he could reach. He met his mark if Sherlock's responding gasp was anything to go by.
"It's entirely possible he's keeping away from any visible CCTV cameras, he's proven himself smart enough so far."
While Sherlock hailed a cab, John asked Mrs. Hudson if she could keep their guest company. She agreed, as she'd already planned on doing so so she could see "the lovely girl" again.
In the end, he shouldn't have been worried. Sherlock rocked the little one to sleep and got in the bed on
Excited to have made the breakthrough in the case once more, John fetched his laptop and settled into his chair to start looking. Sherlock settled across from him, and the only thing that was missing was tea.
It wasn't until John was ready for bed that he realized they never ordered a baby monitor. But this did mean he gets to sleep in Sherlock's bed again, so he pretended as if this piece of information never occurred to him. What was the harm?
"No you're right, it's just sweet is all." John stood up, stretched, and walked a couple feet to plant a kiss on Eleanor's forehead. It was, at the time, the only way to prevent himself from doing the same to Sherlock instead.
John rubbed the back of his neck. "You know what? It's none of my business, I know you value your privacy." He stood up, presumably to go to his room.
And it was that same cover of darkness that led Sherlock to open his mouth instead of falling asleep like every cell of his body begged him to do instead.
"Yes. Solving crime utilized my brain in its entirety. It's a good replacement, but there's still bad days." Here, he looked up again. "I can get through those days now though. Do you understand?"
The receptionist thanked both of them and made a call to the maternity ward for Eleanor to be brought down. They knew the nurse who was holding her was close when the agonized wails of a baby drew nearer.
Sherlock rolled over and sat up to face John. "Fine, but I'm not eating at all tomorrow. You're going to make me fat."
Emmett observed with confusion and John ignored it in favor of starting a blog draft for their case. Besides, it's far from the first time he witnessed the curly haired man prepare for an experiment.
Of course fantasies are only that and sooner rather than later they arrived at Baker Street, the familiar red awning of Speedy's welcoming them back. Sherlock and John carried Emmett's bags while he held Eleanor, and he was careful not to jostle her as she was mercifully silent the entire ride.
He needed to watch it burn to ash, or he couldn't be certain that all of the information was removed.
Sherlock and John waited in Lestrade's office for him to come back and give the green light for another interrogation of Brown. During those few hours, John managed to coax a full cup of tea and a few crisps from a bag he got in the vending machine. He felt the success was due more to Sherlock being in another world than it was Sherlock actually conceding to the consumption of food.
John relaxed and removed his hands from Sherlock's face, ignoring the cold that replaced it. "Of course."
Some part of Sherlock must have been at least mildly interested in the tea because he slowly sat back upright and took it from John.
Sherlock's mouth formed a silent 'oh' and he sat back in his chair. "You want to know about my past. More than what I've told you."
On the ride back, John could tell that Sherlock was losing himself to the recesses of his mind, no doubt beating up himself over this. His expression was unreadable, but tension was held in his body. Not that of a spring ready to uncoil, but the tension of a murderer waiting on a guilty verdict. Perhaps what he was feeling was exactly that. John knew Sherlock always blamed himself instead of the perps when an investigation failed. They hadn't had a case like this since Sherlock returned, but John suspected he might be more upset than any other case before the fall.
With that, he backed off and left the room. Sherlock and John met him in the hall where he was informing the security guard to leave him in there until the search was completed. It would be an attempt at further intimidation.
." John said as he moved closer to Sherlock and held a protective postion slightly in front onf him, blocking the bullly's view.
John stood up, "Alright, let's get her things set up while she's asleep. And you need to make some calls to Mycroft. Or we could go shopping ourselves?"
Did the other person know they were distracted, focusing only on Brown? Did he know they knew the order of kills? There were too many unknowns, all of which leading John to think they were too late. He wanted to be hopeful, but he had a sick feeling in his stomach saying otherwise.
A hand held up cut off John's question. "There is an almost dried patch of drool on your shirt, it could be from the infant, though with that angle it's more likely to be from a bed partner."
"Absolutely. The baby would just slow him down, no reason to keep it." Sherlock's eyes were gray steel, imploring this man to give them something. Anything.
Sherlock and John arrived at London Rehab before any staff, but they didn't have to wait long for the secretary to show up.
Sherlock took another sip and scanned the files on monitored locations to find the holes. "Parks, the docks, most small residential areas."
The disruption allowed the anger between them to simmer down. "Mycroft has the flat bugged I'm sure, we can both go and have one of his minions monitor the entrance. No one besides those we know are allowed entry."
Sherlock left the room and went into his bedroom and stripped out of all of his clothes. He then put on the second pair, the bees one. He came out of the room and walked to the kitchen.
Logan Brown was at the rehab center as expected, and Sherlock and John were posted outside his office. His patient was out in a few minutes, so they didn't have to wait long.
Lestrade readjusted in his seat by crossing his legs the opposite way. "So you admit to killing all six?"
"We just finished a case Hudders, certainly the opposite of lazy no?" said Sherlock as he greeted her with a kiss to the forehead.
Eleanor's patience ran out and she emitted a series of vowels until John shushed her and picked her up.
Sherlock didn't know how long he was staring into the blue eyes and keeping up a constant 'shhh' but, it was long enough for Lestrade and the nurse to leave. He looked up only when he felt a hand at his shoulder and found John standing with Eleanor's nappy bag in tow and a soft, solemn look on his face.
Around three in the morning, Sherlock's phone went off and woke all three of 221b's residents. Eleanor gave a startled cry at the rude awakening, and both John and Sherlock sat upright.
John looked at the hand and understood the delicate gesture for what it was. He would not leave Sherlock despondent. John placed his own hand firmly on top and gave it a squeeze. The last thing he saw before he closed his own eyes to settle in, was the tiny upturn of the corners of Sherlock's mouth.
"Right," John frowned but kept going. "He targeted victims through a patient list at his job as a counsellor, and his reason for doing so is stupid."
John noted the needle and vomit stain trailing down the man's mouth and cheek. "This isn't a regular OD."
Babies weren't so bad he supposed. At least not this one. She seemed to like him, and had big blue eyes that reminded him of John. Eleanor also didn't scream when he handled her, like all the other babies he'd met once they were separated from their parents.
Sherlock felt John was talking about him directly, his worth. And maybe he was. It made his stomach flip regardless. "We will."
John handed Sherlock the now heated bottle, "I think that means yes actually. Though I doubt she'll remember anything we said when she actually is old enough to say her first word."
Sherlock threw several notes at the driver and jumped out, followed closely by John. No personnel were outside by the cars, so the two of them ran inside and John collided with Sherlock who stopped suddenly just inside the door.
"I watched them, studied their routine for a couple weeks. The easiest ones always left their flats at a certain time, and from there it was simple to choose an alley and wait until they passed by." He looked thoughtful for a moment, "They come so willingly when you have a gun on them. Totally silent and compliant. The gun was never loaded, all they had to do was run away or scream for help."
Sherlock has ASD in this story, but I think this is the first chapter that says anything explicit about it. He would identify himself as having Asperger's though if anyone asked because he was diagnosed before the DSM changed. Also, I'm not on the spectrum, so if anyone is and has an issue with the way it's portrayed here please let me know so I can change it to be more accurate. I've been writing him based off of the experiences of a couple friends of mine who are on the spectrum, on top of what I've been learning in my university.
John took SHerlock’s left hand in his right because SHerlock liked having sex while holding handfs. He needed tha textra touch of intimacu . Ugh what as oft boy.
So John prsesed in, slowly still. Gently. HE wathce d SHerlock’s face to make sure tha t he wasn’t going int too fast. Slowing sdown if he saw any pain or cringing. And moving when he saw anticatpinion and pleaseur. Nice.
He didn't stop to talk to Lestrade, so John did and hoped his friend would at least wait for him outside.
Sherlock pulled out his phone and opened up Google maps. He typed in Brown's address and zoomed out. "There are far too many parks to be searched by foot." He glared at the device then turned the screen off.
One episode of a show turned into two, turned into three. And lulled by the noise, alcohol, and mental exhaustion, Sherlock felt John's head fall to his shoulder. He was loathe to move them or end their contact, so instead he slowly laid down and pulled John with him. They lay side by side now, with Sherlock's back pressed against the back of the couch and John plastered against his front. He'd wait until the morning to worry about their positioning and what it implied. For now, he would feel loved.
The rest of the day was spent establishing a routine with Eleanor, who was surprisingly regular in her food and changing needs. The two friends alternated duties, which wasn't a problem except for Sherlock's less than stellar ability to change soiled nappies.
In his room, John got dressed and planned to shower later. He wasn't sure what to do about last night. Would Sherlock rather he not mention it? Or were they past the hiding now? He didn't want to scare him off, especially after how honest he was last night. So he figured he'll just wait and see if Sherlock says anything. Though it did seem like Sherlock didn't know how he wanted to approach the whole thing either. He even offered to make tea.
Inside the car, John nudged Sherlock with the Belstaff and the two made eye contact. The anxiety they felt was mirrored.
The blonde was curled up and uncovered by the blankets. That wouldn't do. Sherlock took his half of the duvet and threw it over John. He would be nice, but he wasn't going to be polite about it.
He leaned against the frame of the door and crossed his arms. "So how's the experiment of avoiding people going?"
John was mostly startled by their positions before moving. He must have curled against Sherlock in the night and his body still radiated with lingering warmth.
"OKay. UH.....You're really good at this game and it's really cool to watch and I'm going back to m post now bye.":
He stood up and rushed to John's side, placing one hand on the back of the chair and the other on the table. "What did you find?"
Sherlock swallowed a lump in his throat. John was staring at him with so much conviction, the pain of loss evident across the tight lines in his face. "Okay. I promise."
Well, Sherlock thought, he forgot the baby monitor but that's not important. "No, besides what's already in her bag, she hasn't reached the developmental age for more items."
MEanwhile the worker at the ride notice dthe two of them hadn't come out in their swan cart so he sent securoy to look for the.. Sexuroit forund them an d kicked them out fo the faor.
He realized what that implied too late to retract his statement, as John already sat up and turned so his feet hung off the side of the bed. He cursed himself internally for putting the tension in John's posture.
John gasped audibly ansd Sherlock jerked his head towards him as he finished. He saw john peekign his head aorund the edge of the shower curtian and they held each other's gaze for a minute.
John stepped forward to accept the offer and cradled Eleanor up against his chest, one hand on her back and one under her bum. Emmett jogged up the stairs, leaving the rest alone.
The seat on the three dimensional swan was narrow and had them pressed together. The only problem this caused was that now they had sexual tension. ( I looked away for that whole lin3 and typer is t perfectly so drunk alex is GREAT at typing confirmed.P
John gawped when he saw him. Sherlock looked more amazing than he thought he would. Sherlock was clad only in the panties. His skin was normally pale, but now held a blush from his cheeks down his collarbones and to his chest. He wasn’t posing, but rather seemed to stand still with hands wringing in anxiety. Or insecurity, John wasn’t sure which though they’re synonyms.
I was in a hopeless state of arousal, and so did not appreciate the loss of him, but he assured me that we would soon find other voluptuous arrangements, which I would enjoy just as much, or even more, and that was both consolation and enticement. With his guidance, I rolled onto my front and then lifted myself into a hands-and-knees position. I had to spread my legs especially wide, as they were so much longer than his, and this made me feel even more open and empty. I understood then better than ever what he had meant when he had warned me that I must be willing to make myself vulnerable before him.
He unfastened the button with deliberate, excruciating slowness. He was tantalising me into such a frenzy, I was growing near to my crisis just from the anticipation, but I held back, wanting to see how much he would reveal to me. He undid the second button, then the third, and my toes curled. “Please,” I whispered.
Those times were particularly troublesome when Watson was similarly idle. Every wry smile he gave me, every twinkle in his eye, every gesture of his body seemed to inspire an onanistic indulgence – and increased my suspicion (my hope? my delusion?) that he was aware of my yearning and felt similarly. I searched for clues that this was so, taking note of his jealousy when I pursued cases without him, measuring his willingness to set other duties aside to accompany me on adventures. But even then, was I merely projecting my own possessiveness onto him? Was I only seeing my own depravity in his mischievous behaviour?
We recovered the dog, unharmed but quite sooty, and carried him back to the boy, who burst into fresh tears at the sight of his beloved pet.
All I knew at the time was that I wished to avoid such a fate, and I made careful notes of which habits were healthful and which were not: to prevent temptations from creeping up, and also to prevent involuntary night losses, I should make a habit of bathing in cold water, washing with a stiff brush and drying with a coarse towel, going to the gymnasium, climbing, swinging, running, horseback riding...I got the idea that essentially I must exhaust myself daily, to leave no energy in my body to devote to solitary vice.
He frowned. “I suppose you’re going to tell me that I had my lunch at a different café than usual, and that I elected to take a cab rather than walk home.”
Every stroke coaxed a noise from me, sometimes just a soft grunt, once in a while a shriek, when he decided to be particularly assertive with his prick in me. I had just enough presence of mind to understand how hard he was working, to admire the flex and pull of the muscles in his arms and belly as he strove to satisfy me. Nonetheless, I was also sufficiently delirious with pleasure to react with bafflement when he asked me, between huffing breaths, if I might like to try it some other way. “Watson,” I answered with all sincerity, “I’m afraid I’m fresh out of orifices.”
“My darling, my dear,” Watson cooed, taking my face in his hands, lifting it up and away from himself. He bid me look up at him, and then leaned down to kiss me tenderly. It was a comforting forgiveness for my failure, but also astonishingly filthy, him wanting to put his mouth on me when it had a moment ago been pleasuring him. My soft, spent prick jumped when his tongue darted into my mouth.
I did not believe it at first, until I turned my head and confirmed beyond doubt where his face was. A moment later, the shock dissipated, and I was overwhelmed by the delicious sensation of it. I was affected to a ridiculous degree by such a minute touch, moaning at the slippery warmth of it and squirming to get more, if it was at all possible.
“True gratitude would have been to bring me another case,” I sighed. But Watson was right on all counts, and I told him so.
I was frank with Watson about my bad habits upon our first meeting, and after we took up lodgings together my candor continued. I saw no reason to hide from him those foibles I possessed, and those particular vices which cohabitants might tend to be discreet about, I did not indulge in. Watson did not care for it when I opened my Morocco case, that was immediately apparent, but other than that, he tolerated my eccentricities, and on occasion spoke about them fondly in his chronicles.
With a few reassuring squeezes to my arms and shoulders, he replied, “If it’s really what you want.”
Watson found a suitable basket in the kitchen, plus utensils, serviettes, and two wine glasses. We set out in the early afternoon, first to the high street, where we collected our provisions. We filled our picnic basket with bread, cheese, cold sliced meats, cherries, and a daintily-ribboned box of four chocolates, plus a bottle of wine. As routine as this errand was, it was pleasant to do something so bland and domestic, because I was doing so with Watson.
, I was unashamed when my tears fell upon his shoulder. Love was not a sentiment to be trifled with, I understood that now more than ever, but I knew that we could not have generated such a powerful communion of ecstasy if I had not given myself up to him entirely, and now we could not hope to sustain it if I became guarded again, retreating into my dispassionate carapace.
I nearly favoured Watson with a lengthy speech about how very little it mattered to me how hot or stuffy or hazy or odiferous London was; bodily comfort was of no concern when the mind was suitably occupied. And while right now there was no case in sight, that could change at any moment.
Watson and I spent the day flitting about Camden, hailing cabs and taking side streets in order to secure our vantage points. Sure enough, wherever we found ourselves when my client made her way through on her errands, a lurking woman in her aunt’s green shawl was never far away. It so happened that this woman chose to make herself known just when Miss Hayes was approaching the counter at a bakery; Watson and I watched from behind our coffee and scones at a table in the corner.
“Then you’ll forgive my haste in bringing our picnic to a decisive conclusion,” I said, wrapping up the remaining cheese and meat and putting it in the basket.
Thus, the knowledge gleaned from the health and hygiene books permeated two years or so of my life, coinciding (perhaps unfortunately) with the first stirrings of adolescence in my mind and body. When that process began, I desperately attempted to allay my new confusions with these books, but more often than not, reading them made things worse. The anatomical diagrams and the factual, sterile descriptions of bodily functions were enlightening, but that information comprised only a sliver of these texts. The rest was concerned with more nebulous information about such things as the powerful reciprocation of influence between the reproductive organs and the brain (and other organs as well, but the brain was the one I was most concerned with – even in my youngest days I considered everything below my neck to be an appendix). I was fascinated by and terrified of the explanations of how excitements of the reproductive organs affected the brain. My organs, the books warned, caused libidinous thoughts, which if exercised would pollute my mind and drain my vital powers.
I protested briefly but vociferously when Watson slid his finger back out of me, but he assured me it was only so he could prepare himself to put in a second. He replenished the Vaseline and made good on his promise, going slowly but steadily.
“Until that moment arrives, then, I shall indulge myself.” He leaned forward, and released the buttons of my trousers and drawers with tantalising meticulousness. It was a great relief when he brought my prick out into the open air, for I had felt appallingly confined for the past several hours, even when I had not been concealing a state of arousal.
Thus determined, I carried on through adolescence and into adulthood – and found it hardly a challenge, being rarely drawn towards any sort of temptation. What baffled me were the peccadilloes of others, whether they be schoolmates, the subjects of town gossip, or heroes of history and literature. Once I came to understand that beneath the strictures of Victorian England bubbled lecherous deeds and devilish urges, it seemed that everyone around me was to some degree susceptible to vice, except myself.
Watson knelt at the side of my bed; he was so close to me now that I could feel his breath on my belly, and I shivered, feeling intensely my own naked vulnerability. He reached out and brushed my hands away from where they were situated between my thighs, and instead held the base of the dildo himself, lightly manipulating it. The moment he touched it, I felt a whole different kind of pleasure. I was no longer in complete control, and the surprises in each tiny movement sent fresh bolts of pleasure all through me. He smiled slyly at my jerking and grunting, and asked, “Is this what you like? Hm?”
“Indeed, not even I would have ventured such a hypothesis.” I clutched his arms, desiring just one more minute of this closeness. “Watson, I can’t help but feel regret about the time lost. I have loved you for years, but for all my powers of observation, I had no idea you felt the same.”
. Each of them had between his legs a half-standing member, not limp and discreetly small like those of Hellenic statuary but firm and growing still more prominent as the two of them rolled about and rubbed their bodies together.
When he was certain that he was well-seated, and I comfortable, he sat up straight between my legs, tucked his hands in the crooks of my knees, and began to pierce me over and over with more ferocity. He worked his big prick in me like a stud, like a tamed brute: dutiful, never allowing me for an instant to doubt the superiority of his instrument. I cried for more without shame.
I wished now to use this gaze that I had on occasion fallen under, so as to signal to Watson everything that such a gaze was meant to signal. I attempted it one quiet evening when Watson was just returning to Baker Street, having spent the day at his medical practice.
The slabs of griddle cake were thick and shapeless, but they tasted just fine, and afterwards, to cheer me, Watson reminded me that I still had the newspaper to read. The local journal’s agony column was not nearly as expansive or interesting at the one in the
I came to understand, for example, that I could trust in him to be open and honest when it was beneficial, but the soul of discretion when it was vital. I found, for example, that he would never divulge to me anything about the patients he saw in his practice. This could be frustrating, if I suspected that there might be some useful or edifying detail in a patient’s ailment or the treatment thereof, but ultimately I understood that this tendency of Watson’s was invaluable to me. If Watson was upstanding enough to refuse to betray a patient’s confidence to his closest companion, then what he would be willing to keep secret on behalf of that closest companion must be limitless.
“Now, I could go on like this,” he said, “and I’d be happy to. But I could also instead introduce you to an instrument which is perhaps not as sizeable but which has a bit more life in it.”
I discovered this shelf (that is, I became tall enough to reach it with the aid of a chair) when I was ten years old. I took them down and sat with them in the leather wingback chair the same as I had every book before, but when I realised what these books were concerned with, I was so startled that I immediately climbed up and put them back, terrified that my parents would find out I had looked at them (I was aware by that age of telltale signs of interference, such as the presence or absence of dust upon an object).
At the time, I was certain that these unfortunate souls had brought themselves to ruin (or were in the process of bringing themselves to such) only because they had not the knowledge nor the discipline that I possessed. It took years and much study of human nature before I began to suspect that perhaps I was exceptional – that is, exceptional in yet another way besides the ones I’d already understood about myself. Perhaps I lacked an otherwise universal element, an urge which truly was irresistible to everyone else. I fear it is too late now to know whether my anxious readings of health and hygiene manuals caused my disinclination towards sexual indulgences, or whether this lack of inclination was inherent, thus making all the grim warnings I had absorbed superfluous.
Watson seemed dumbfounded by my about-face, amazed that he could have done any such thing as convince me to go against my stubborn ways, but I ignored this and set immediately to composing a reply to Waugh’s letter.
His suspicion was correct; he cooked up a fine meal even though I pestered him throughout the task, as I had not yet tired of being the constant centre of his attention. I decided mid-meal that I would have to match his culinary gesture with one of my own, so I promised him that for breakfast the following morning I would make crepes, using my maternal grandmother’s recipe. I did not mention that I had only seen the recipe once (I was certain that I had memorised it perfectly then), nor that I had never actually attempted to make crepes – but how difficult could it be, if one followed the directions?
“I don’t mean here. But soon. You’ve been so good to me these past few days. You’ve shown me so much, and given me so much pleasure, and I want to give you that in return.”
“Naturally,” I agreed. Then I turned to face him. “But now that it is dark, and we must certainly be alone, with only your constellations for company, perhaps we could engage in one rash act of wanton exhibitionism?” I tilted my head to indicate what I wanted.
He laid on his back next to me and guided me up and over, so I was straddling him. He held my hip in one hand and his cockstand in the other, and slid it up and down my cleft several times before settling it in just the right spot and pushing the tip inside. He encouraged me to continue, to sit myself upon it, and doing it slowly felt wonderful. With his encouragement, I wiggled and rocked until I found just the right place for all of him, and then began to bounce a little. He ran his hands all over my chest and belly and thighs, saying how beautiful I was; this I was still a bit doubtful about, but it did not spoil my fun.
Holmes sat up just then, as if he’d remembered something important, but then he only tilted himself forward and got on his knees and elbows. He waggled his narrow behind at Watson, saying, “Please give it to me now, you’ve no idea how badly I need it.”
Though I lacked experience, I was no naïf: I had strolled through parks in the West End and crossed paths with those notorious dandies in their garish frock-coats, their lapels bearing coded messages. On several of these occasions I had been the object of a dandy’s peculiar gaze, one which travelled quickly down, then slowly up, with a final inquiring look into my eyes at the end. I had on those occasions never returned the signal they sought, but neither did I communicate offence or disdain, as there was no harm done...and I confess I had always felt a certain sympathy with them, as they were, like myself, compelled to continuously seek what satisfied them with no respite in sight, finding no permanent contentment as society dictated they ought, in the arms of a respectable wife.
I watched him as he pursed his lips at the tip, then with some wet suction, drew me into his mouth, his lips hugging the glans, the crown, then the shaft. When his nose was in my pubic hair, he began to suckle rhythmically, and I was breathless with the exhilaration of it.
Sometimes he would pause in his quixotic recollections, and there would be silence between us, and I could hear him inhaling the sea air deeply. I remembered the advice I’d read in one of those hygiene books as a child:
“Sulking in a torpor has its own charms,” I insisted. Then I snuggled against him bodily and sighed, “But perhaps I will do it less.”
Watson forgave me with a kiss on the cheek, then bent his knees and elbows to take a better stance, so he might deliver a series of solid, rhythmic thrusts. I confess I left him to it, raising my legs in the air and stretching my arms above my head, wishing only to accept pleasure, and trusting that he was taking a suitable portion of the same for himself whilst he worked.
After all the intensity of our coupling, it was when he was washing me intimately that I became overwhelmed with emotion; he must have noticed the tightening of my throat, and the humidity of my gaze, for he asked what was the matter. I refused to open my mouth, for fear of letting loose a mortifying sob, but he understood anyway, and climbed back in bed beside me and held me tightly, rocking me back and forth a little and stroking my hair.
Mrs. Hudson seemed fondest of Watson. She never commented, as Holmes and I did, on his simplicity, his occasional downright dim-wittedness. Frankly, I often wondered if his visits were just for her benefit; Holmes, though he’d called Watson a friend for so many years, seemed not to benefit from his company at all, as far as I could see. I had not been surprised, those few years ago, when Watson and Mrs. Hudson had both remarked on what a worthy companion I was for Holmes; an intellectual equal was what he really needed around.
His slow sucking was lush, and I was tingling all over and unable to keep still; my toes curled, and I squirmed in my seat. Watson was very tolerant of my restlessness, and placed his hands on my thighs to keep himself steady upon and around me.
“You have succeeded in convincing me,” I announced, sitting up and gesturing for Watson to give me the letter. “I shall take this man up on his offer, only on the condition that his hospitality extends to you as well.”
Between the half-folded panels of the screen, I could see everything, and thus I felt that I myself must be quite exposed. But the two men were well distracted by each other, and as they continued to undress, I gradually grew more confident in my concealment, for they certainly would never have done such things as they were doing if they’d had the slightest inkling that they were being watched.
I was familiar enough with the design of such an object that I could think of three methods by which to open it – unfastening the bottom, removing the hinges, or just plain picking the locks. Each had its advantages and disadvantages, and I pondered each, with particular consideration paid to how obvious it would be to the staff of the British Museum that I had been tampering with the trunk.
There was a careless bumping of shoulders, to make it all appear to have happened by accident, and then a shocked and elated greeting. There followed an astounding story of miraculous circumstance, during which time I recognised the woman, beneath her makeup and wig: she was an actress, whose West End income I had supplemented twice in the past by having hired her myself to play a minor role in solving a client’s difficulty.
I protested that I did not want to picnic on the strand, as I did not care for sand in my food (and my shoes, and my shirt), but I pointed out the enormous oak trees on a hill overlooking the coastline, and we hiked up. We found that these oaks shaded a little green meadow, from which vantage point we could still see the waves rolling in, and hear the cries of gulls. The leaves of the ancient oaks provided plenty of shade, and we found a spot that was not too lumpy with exposed roots upon which to spread our blanket.
When Watson pulled out of his body, Holmes whimpered so sharply that I winced myself. Watson moved Holmes’ legs from his shoulders carefully, arranging the two of them into a limp-limbed heap of flushed, glowing bodies on the bed. Then, with one arm, Watson could just reach the silver cigarette case on the bedside table, and he lit two cigarettes, handing Holmes one.
I had not the energy just then to reassure him of the full extent of my satisfaction, to recount detail by detail the sincere cries, the fragrant odours, and the deliciously lurid images which I would hold in my memory forever, and would surely revisit whenever I needed relief from boredom (which would be often). I lacked the wit and verve, in my languor, to describe how fascinating, how riveting, how wonderfully novel each moment of our inaugural coupling felt to me. Instead, I simply replied, “You have proven yourself once again to be an invaluable companion. I wonder if you might read to me some more tonight?”
There was a brief argument over which store to shop at (John wanted somewhere cheap because she would grow out of everything in a couple months, Sherlock wanted somewhere expensive because the material was higher quality and therefore more comfortable.) Sherlock won, obviously, but John worried that Sherlock would end up being one of those posh people who dress their infants in stiff formal wear all the time. Luckily this wasn't the case.
So lkitu holds them there while sHerlock and John go abck to teh lab and compare the sizes. Sherlock says "AH-HAH" out loud and they go back to the suspects.
"He's only killing drug addicts that we know of. There's no sexual abuse, no notes, no fanfare, no torture. He's trying to rid the world of addicts."
The two stood in silence until Sherlock finished and stubbed out the butt then tossed it into the nearest bin.
At that, John closed his book silently and placed it on the side table. He made eye contact with Sherlock and looked sheepish at being accurately called out.
Pants number two were a panty style (he would blame Irene’s tmi stories for that knowledge) that were predominantly white with yellow ruffled trim. Different tiny bees were scattered around the fabric, making it an apiarist’s wet dream (also Sherlock’s who was he kidding).
John’s other hadn rested on SHErlock’es hip, and he thrusted forward with a stedy rhtyhtm. It started slow and gained with speed only when Sherlok gave a verbal yes.
"That absolutely cannot happen again, not with Eleanor here. It was already too much risking Mrs. Hudson like that."
Sherlock kept his face turned toward the window and stared unseeingly at London. If he let himself look at John at this proximity, he worried he wouldn't be able to control himself. Control his desire to lean even closer, or control his face to not give away his feelings for the good doctor. What he could do is close his eyes and pretend they just finished a case and were cuddled up on the ride home, ready to collapse into bed together.
The two chuckled and John suggested they go home and sleep, to pick up everything with fresh eyes later. Surprisingly, he met little resistance from Sherlock and the two donned their coats and left.
John looked up at the sound of a disgruntled detective making a loud thump. Sherlock had flopped onto the couch and started running his fingers through his curls in frustration.
Before opening the lid of the box, he looked at John who gave him a reassuring smile and crossed his arms. Curiosity definitely piqued, Sherlock opened the lid and pulled out…pairs of pants.
John placed everything on the side table then moved that so both of them could reach it. Then he pushed his armchair a bit closer to Sherlock's to make it even easier.
He wiped his hands dry on a nearby towel and took a moment to stare at Sherlock's face. What was originally tensed in tightly hidden pain, was now smoothed out and serene. He tried committing it to memory as best as he could, though he had no mind palace.
Sherlock slammed a fist down on the table and levelled his face with the man. "Stop it just stop lying. We don't have time for this. Your partner just killed the next person on the list, the one single father with a baby remember?"
Sherlock and JOihn wal k uo and asee Peach layinf on the ground covered in blood. Sherloc deduces that Bowser knocked her the fuck out iwith his thorny vokcock because wounds. Also my friend tod me that as a joke buy /I made it lietral.
2) Sherlock's panic attack is based on my personal experience with having them, so I really tried writing it in a way that people who don't experience them might know what it feels like and what symptoms I feel would manifest for him specifically.
Things were never going to go back to the way they were before the fall, but they could get close. Sherlock confided in John about the PTSD he developed from being constantly undercover and the time he was tortured. John opened up in return about what his nightmares really contain, and how he sometimes still has panic attacks after hearing loud bangs. They were changed, but their friendship had grown stronger because of it.
They left with an assortment heavy in dresses and rompers. Sherlock left John to choose pyjama wear and shoes (as long as the shoes matched the clothes). To top the whole arrangement off, Sherlock picked out a variety of headband bows, which had removable bows for when Ella grew hair and they could just be clipped on.
Once in the living room, he flicked on a lamp and sniffed the baby's nappy. It was due for a change, but she was also probably hungry.
Sherlock shook his head. "No point, he won't be there. He still has Eleanor, so he's likely wandering around somewhere."
The search began once more, though this time the room held a dim glow from dusk rather than the muted orange from this morning. A knock came from the open door frame and Sherlock jerked around, ready to tell the intruder to piss off, then halted as he recognized Lestrade.
Sherlock knew she couldn't move around much at this stage to actually play with the toy, so he picked her up and settled her upright in his lap. He placed one hand on her belly to prevent her from falling forward, and the other hand on the bear to snuggle it against her. He didn't feel self-conscious as he noticed the girl's father leaving the room earlier to talk with John in the kitchen.
John did his best to look non threatening, he didn't want to pressure Sherlock but he also didn't want him to think he couldn't open up.
Growing up in a home with many kids, all older, and the parents never paid her attention. She received a good grade in school and showed it to them, only to be waved away because 'I'm busy.'
How quickly the little one captured his heart with deep blue eyes that looked at him as if he could do no wrong. Like she was already doing her damndest to learn about the world.
As Emmett climbed inside, and John handed him the carrier, he spoke. "Tell Sherlock thank you for me, yeah?"
SHerlock i s called by Lakitu to come and sovle the corime. (I had to google the name shut uo you don't know it either.)
Emmett took it. "Thank you, we'll have to hang out sometime. In happier circumstances I hope. No one's been half as kind or helpful as you guys."
"You know you don't accurately gauge threat levels. I agree this was poor planning, but you need to find a different option."
Sherlock felt embarrassed. John was making entirely too much of a big deal about this. "This can't honestly surprise you, I have a skull named Billy."
Sherlock opened one eye to peer at him, having heard his footsteps come back in. "You taking a bath?"
He shook his head, as if to rid the thoughts physically. He would have to wait until the case was over to attempt discussing things, it wouldn't do to distract himself from a serial killer. Unable to keep still though, he reached for his violin and resigned himself to plucking a soft rhythm out of its strings. One that came to mind earlier while rocking the baby.
Speak of the devil, the consulting detective waltzed into the room and grabbed his coat. He held the door open for John and followed him out.
"You were a child, doing what children do. It was a freak accident, could have happened to anyone. It
Mrs. Hudson was the first to notice Sherlock and John's arrival, "Oh boys, isn't she just the most precious thing?"
"Mycroft will install a state of the art security system, video surveillance, alarms on the windows and doors, something stronger than a basic lock."
Sherlock was in that scarily pliant state he gets when he was too inside his head, following John and not registering where they were going.
Sherlock thought about his own anxiety after waking from a nightmare about John, and needing to sit against the edge of his bed and listen to his breathing to know he was alive and safe. With this in mind, he pulled John into laying down, half on top of him from the embrace. Sherlock then took one of his hands and pulled it up to his neck and tried to make John find his pulse point.
Stuff came up so I cut the chapter short. It was originally supposed to go through the whole day, not just the morning. But I wanted to post something because I already said it would be posted by the 22nd.
The process was tricky, as John had only one arm free. His babysitting knowledge from youth came in handy, so he was able to mix a bottle and heat it in the water without too much hassle. Once completed, he settled onto the couch and fed the little girl. He finished the whole task by gently burping and returning her to the drawer-cot.
"No, there's no audience. If he wanted to make a statement, we wouldn't be struggling to identify who's an actual victim."
"Alright alright, we'll take this back and have the cyber team open it." He turned to the room. "Anderson, you lead the clean up."
John stood up and caught the terrified look on Sherlock's face. His stomach dropped and he took Sherlock's hand. "No Sherlock you didn't do anything wrong. I only know because I'm a doctor and teach some patient's about SIDS."
"Hey." John moved his hands underneath Sherlock's, who let him. With both hands now carding gently through his curls, John said, "We're still going to get him. No one lost here. You're not slow."
The two of them settled into bed comfortably, on opposite ends. Though one hand from each breached the empty space in the middle and lay next to each other. Not touching, but close.
The walls were slightely lit up to show hearts and flowers and shit. Sherlock and Hohbn oooekd at each other then started making ot. They don't have time for this shit, y=they just wanted an excuse to kiss on a ride.
A whimper woke John later, five hours according to his phone, and he quietly but swiftly made his way out of bed so as not to disturb Sherlock. He tiptoed to the dresser and kneeled down, making soft cooing noises so Eleanor would know someone was there. He picked her up and cradled her in one hand so the other could grab the nappy bag on his way out of the room.
John wondered how long that would be feasible, and Lestrade responded it couldn't be long because the nights were dangerously cold.
"Yes." John answered without thinking, but after catching the look he was being given he corrected himself. "I mean no. No, not that kind of partner."
It wasn't long before the two were outside Brown's flat building and hitting the knocker. It reminded them of Baker Street, but cheaper. After a minute, the landlord opened the door with a cautious air about him.
Sherlock bent down to give Eleanor a kiss hello then faced Mycroft. "This is why we need better security."
Sherlock scoffed. "Ella, you're probably a genius too. You showed interest in texture in toys earlier than what the website said."
The time it took for Eleanor to be satisfied was longer, and overall the two of them had a much rougher morning than John had in the middle of the night. It made Sherlock tense with perceived incompetence.
John glanced up and saw Sherlock looking carefully away and tapping his fingers against his mug. He decided to not make a big deal about it. "Anytime."
A;ll the usual suspects were playign go katrts when Boweser whizzewd by and knocked Peack the FUCK off her kart. She whirled through the arie and landed head first into a chomper plant.

He came back to the room when Ella's face swam into view. John was knelt on the ground in front of him, pushing her gently into Sherlock's chest. Sherlock obediently moved his hands to cradle the girl and smiled down at her. She still had the same balming effect as she did when they first met.
, and licking his lips. And Sherlock started leaning forward like a man possessed by his desires alone, when a phone went off.
"Shut up," Sherlock said and put his violin away before plopping onto the couch. "And order take away."
Shelrokc swithced hi s weight from one foot to the other, an adult bersion of the potty dance. He gave himself a split second to think : fuck it: befoer opening the door and walking in.
Donovan finished up her notes and clicked the pen closed. She was supposed to make sure the consulting detective left the room and returned to Lestrade's office, but John shook his head at her once. She looked between him and Sherlock and decided against an argument, and left them alone.
"There we go, see? Strangers aren't so bad." They looked up, ready to answer questions, and saw the woman smiling and Sherlock staring at them with barely contained surprise. Connor wondered for a moment if they'd done something wrong, but waved the thought away as just anxiety.
The crowd around him was mostly women, and two boys. Of course. Most people happened to be straight os it made sense that women would surround him in awe snad lust. Just hoping to het his number at the end of his run. John wondered who the males were. They didn't seem ofgle Sherlock like the others, just watch him with excitement.
He popped the lidk adn squeezed a generous amount on his fingers and pressed them to Sherlock’s arse before watifin for the liquidy paste to warm up.
I'm back after another unplanned and unwarned hiatus, rest in peace to you all I'm sorry! I've a lovely group of people now encouraging me to write and helping me with writer's block though, so hopefully this doesn't happen again.
Sherlock adjusted his positioning and moved the bottle so she could drink from it. She latched easily and grasped her hands around the fingers closest to her. He couldn't help but smile down at her.
However, the quote from the therapist, in a different context, seemed useful. Like right now, where he couldn't find a way away from the inner turmoil over Ella. Perhaps the only way to move on was to confront the feelings head on.
Mrs. Hudson and a young man, no older than his twenties, sit on the sofa sipping tea. Mrs. Hudson cradled a blanket wrapped infant in one arm, cooing gently at it.
John flipped back over to his back while Sherlock stayed facing him now, not as out of his depth as before.
It took a minute, but eventually, the hand under John's loosened and let John's pull it away from the bar. Once both hands were released, Sherlock's breath hitched at the pain of blood flow returning to overstrained tendons and muscle.
The DI crossed his hands over the top of the case's file folder and leaned back in his chair, shoulders purposefully relaxed. "You've denied the presence of an attorney and affirmed that you know your rights. Please state your name to proceed."
John sayss, "I;ll let Lakitu know, he should hace them sent to the winner's circle at Peach's castile."
Sherlock switched the score to be higher, "Yes, actually. Mrs. Hudson here is my landlady and is always allowed, there is also my friend and flatmate John Watson. You will meet him if you're hired."
"Okay," he sighed. "That's good, okay." His posture went stiff, military-like, and he walked back into the living room. "Emmett."
Why he thought John would be on his side, no one knew. John raised his eyebrows at him and remained quiet. Though the little one squawked at no longer being the center of attention.
The small group made their way to interrogation room B where Donovan was already set up at a table with a clipboard for writing down the killer's confession. She eyed the baby skeptically and said, "If she cries, you're out."
Sherlock enlisted Mrs. Hudson's help for the babysitter search while John was at the clinic. An advertisement was put out on one of those apps, with quite a few stipulations, and they've received eight responses so far. Sherlock reflected on the construction of the ad while they waited for their first potential person to arrive.
"Yes, actually," he said while putting wrapping his hands around the handle of his umbrella. "I came by to make sure this whole thing isn't just charity or some twisted form of penance you've brought on yourself."
Sherlock envied their client for getting to stay in John's bed, but comforted himself in the fact that Emmett probably didn't care how John's scent lingered behind and would be the perfect opportunity to catalogue it uninterrupted. His next thought however, was realizing that this was the perfect opportunity for John to sleep in
Sherlock stood and handed the baby back to Emmett. "John, one of our workers is back in London after a very conveniently timed holiday."
"Apologies, forget what I said, we'll take the case." Sherlock walked across the room and grabbed the designated client chair from the desk, he dragged it to the center of the room and threw his Belstaff onto the coffee table, heedless of the papers scattered on it.
That wouldn't do. "Nonsense, just sleep in my bed. You'll throw your back out and be grumpy all day, and I won't allow that."
John reached out and poked his nose. "You were smiling at her, the one you only use with me and Mrs. Hudson."
John clenched his teeth and fists, immeditaely on edge. Even though he was the only one at the counter, he left his postion and marched over to the DDR machine.
"-send everyone back into protective custody immediately and have an ambulance sent to Emmett's address."
Last note, apologies to anyone who likes Mycroft. If I'm writing him the way I saw him in BBC's version, he's not a nice brother. He really owes a nice apology and then some to Sherlock. If you want an amazing Mycroft, watch Miss Sherlock!
The only break to his focus was during lunch when Sarah asked him about the case. He couldn't blame her for being curious, she always did want to hear the stories even if she despised the idea of ever participating again. He kept to the facts and just so happened not to mention Emmett and Eleanor staying with them. That would only spark more questions which he didn't have the emotional energy to answer right now.
The father closed the door and followed them inside. "How do you know? What do I do? What about Ella?" He wrung his hands anxiously.
Once Ella's needs were met, John went back to sleep with her while Sherlock stayed up doing God knows what to work off his impatient energy. John wondered if maybe not all of Sherlock's frustration was caused by being unable to confront the killer, and was perhaps also partially caused by the sudden imminent departure of Eleanor.
Perhaps there was more to it than the guilt John suspected. Perhaps Sherlock, deep down, wanted a family. A want that was beaten into submission from the cruel words of bullies and family alike. It was terribly sad, John thought, that Sherlock maybe never got the chance to want this.
In Baker Street, he tried removing his coat only to realize the baby carrier was still strapped to his body. It sent alarms off in his head and he needed it off now.
I laughed too, at this. “I suppose yes, but I...just wanted to be certain.” I lifted my hips again. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to interrupt what was going on, I’ve been waiting so long for it.”
“Not yet – not today.” He continued to draw his fingers in and out leisurely as he spoke. “I want to make sure that when I have you, it is completely pleasurable for you. You must show me that you can reach your crisis with no struggle while you have so much inside you.”
“Perhaps, but that is not what I mean at all. I desperately need to know, if at all possible, how it feels to be the object of such a craving as I have. Would you teach me what it feels like to be consumed in a mutual voluptuous desire?
As he did this, he opened his legs and bent his knees, and Watson, after wetting his middle finger thoroughly in his own mouth, leaned over Holmes’ splayed body and placed that wet fingertip…well, into Holmes’ fundament, if I can be quite frank. I want to say that this was the most depraved thing I had ever witnessed, and so I will say it, but I cannot deny that there was a tenderness to it that I never would have imagined could exist. Watson stroked Holmes’ hair with his free hand, and Holmes made contented little noises, and sometimes he would take Watson out of his mouth just to smile or giggle at him, or to receive a gentle kiss.
For all that our holiday had been a joy, I had difficulty getting a solid night’s sleep, as it was taking some getting used to, sharing a bed intimately with another person. The need to be close conflicted with the need for rest; several times throughout the night, Watson and I embraced, then separated when we became overheated, then clutched at each other again, as we drifted in and out of slumber. In the morning, I awoke once again lying entangled with Watson, who was handling my prick.
But then he made his way downwards, and began to fellate me. This was unexpected, though not unwelcome. He attended to me in a most leisurely manner, very fitting for a lazy morning. I was so relaxed, I didn’t want to lift a finger or open my mouth to encourage him, I just hummed a bit occasionally to communicate my appreciation.

“I’m so sorry to intrude,” he said, slowly looking me up and down with obvious alarm in his eyes. “I heard noises, and thought you were in distress.”
“No,” I said. I myself knew that the work was entirely finished, and so was already collapsing upon the settee, lighting a cigarette. “It is not worth saving.”
When I opened the very first box, it became immediately apparent why the British Museum did not want anyone to know the contents of the trunk. Inside was a bronze object whose purpose was obvious. According to the meticulously handwritten card inside, it was crafted in China in the second century before Christ’s birth. I opened a second box, and found another item of a similar size and shape, this one made of ivory, and labeled “France, 18 c.”
He turned out to be not so willing to relinquish complete control, because he continued to hold me and help me move. At my breathless request he squeezed my prick while I rode, but with his other hand he pushed on my hipbone with his thumb to nudge me back, or dug his fingertips into my arse to pull me forward. As it became clear that we were drawing near to a mutual glory he planted his feet on the bed and began to push upwards into me. It felt lovely, though, not too intense, and all along he continued to praise me. I have some doubts about how handsome I actually looked flailing about with my jaw hanging open, but to Watson I was apparently an absolute treasure.
I didn’t believe him, but I behaved myself anyway, keeping still whilst he opened the tin of Vaseline so that he might prepare me. By now, the feeling of his fingers inside me was familiar and welcome, though it also made me impatient and overeager. I made a show of lifting my hips and making greedy noises, proving to him that my body not only needed but
I flushed up and turned my face away. I think I was embarrassed that he found every aspect of me as exciting as I found every aspect of him. I had asked him to show me what it felt like to be the object of desire, but I had not learned to cope with having it be so. Perhaps I would get used to it…but a part of me hoped not.
For here I must tell you something odd, and perhaps funny: I was never so obsessed with the act of self-abuse as I was when I was reading the books which so fiercely warned me against it. When I was away from the library, visiting distant relatives or on some other sort of holiday, I did not think much about the practice at all. Occasionally my organ would become stiff, and always for seemingly no reason, but I was usually occupied with some adventure or study which I preferred not to interrupt, and then my body would calm down on its own. I waited for “impure thoughts” and “prurient desires” to overcome me, as the books warned, but they rarely troubled me, even if I forgot to sleep on my side, or washed with a soft cloth instead of a coarse one. It was only when I was in the habit of reading those particular texts that my thoughts turned to that loathsome activity.
We awoke the following morning to a startlingly blue sky and, opening the windows, wonderfully warm breezes. I tend to be indifferent to weather, but Watson was delighted, and suggested we have a picnic that day. I requested several hours in which to smoke a pipe, wake up properly, have some tea, read the paper, smoke another pipe, dress, and brace myself for a day spent in the clean, fresh out-of-doors, but other than that I was more or less amenable.
“Your timing is fortuitous,” I said, lounging in my chair before the fireplace as he hung up his overcoat and hat. “Mrs. Hudson is bringing up dinner shortly.” I then favoured him with that same heated gaze I had been the target of, my eyes darting from top to toe, then caressing from toe to top. He did not acknowledge what I had done, but seated himself in his chair opposite mine, and stretched his legs out.
was quite alarming to me. He kissed and mouthed at my cockstand like it was precious, worshipping it with his lips and tongue.
Finally, Holmes lay flat on his back, and with Watson’s assistance lifted his legs so that his ankles could rest on Watson’s shoulders. Watson went back to the pot of petroleum jelly and applied some more to himself, then gripped Holmes around the knees, and after inserting himself once again, pumped Holmes at a steady pace.
Most frustrating of all, no exact guidelines were given as to the correct frequency. The book assured its readers that they, adults who were healthy and responsible enough for marriage, would be able to exercise good judgment in this matter, if only they made the effort.
Watson was awestruck. “What a brilliant idea! She must have known she was at risk of being found out, and such a technique guaranteed she would not be caught with compromising materials bearing the coded orders she was giving. A truly marvelous plot – of course it could only be foiled by you!”
“Will you turn over for me?” he asked, his voice faint through the haze of my euphoria. I allowed him to help me flop onto my belly, afterwards straining to turn my head to see what he would do. He wasted no time; grabbing one cheek of my arse and holding me open, he stroked himself over me, grunting like a beast. I watched his spend erupt from his prick, then felt the heat of it land on my still-quivering hole. It was the most depraved thing imaginable, and I loved it.
. Already in fear for my well-being when it came to solitary vice, the idea that a wrong guess about my future matrimonial life would have grave consequences was horrifying.
My own jaw was hanging free as well, I admit. I was astounded by every aspect of the spectacle before me. For the three years I had known Holmes, he had been the soul of propriety, never so much as letting on that carnal matters even existed, but now here he was, behaving in an uncontrollably lascivious manner. Even when I was utterly perplexed by what was happening or why anyone would want to do it, I could not look away, for every moment of his entanglement with Watson was fascinating.
I let my head loll to one side, to face him, and my eyes fluttered shut. “The thought troubles me not,” I said sleepily, “for I’ve recently discovered a new way for us to keep ourselves occupied in the evenings.”
Holmes called a temporary halt, his thighs trembling with the effort of holding himself up. He asked to be allowed to lie fully on his front, with Watson covering him. Watson complied, naturally. I found it strangely satisfying to see how his belly fit perfectly against the small of Holmes’ back as he seated himself fully in Holmes’ body. He worked diligently at his task, but it seemed that he found it more physically taxing than before, for it was not long before he retreated, and asked if Holmes might like to climb on top of him.
My boots would cause a ruckus to remove indoors, so I pulled them off and left them on the terrace. The French doors were unlocked; I knew exactly the point at which the hinges would begin to squeak, and squeezed myself inside short of that distance. In stocking feet I moved silently past Holmes’ desk and the furniture collected around the hearth. I heard Holmes and Watson’s voices more clearly now; they were speaking in low, sly tones to each other, perhaps about some exploit from years past.
I never told Watson that I had seen this, because I suspected that he might not have realised he was doing it, and I did not want to make him self-conscious of such a useful (if incongruous) habit. But any man who, in a hospital in London, exercised a level of caution appropriate for enemy territory in wartime was, as I said, clearly both brave and sensible. Here was a man of good character fallen on hard times, yet his apparent qualities made me feel that we would be at the very least suitable cohabitants. (My suspicions later proved true that once he regained his niche, his constancy, his nerve, and his capable surgeon’s hands would make him an ideal brother-in-arms.)
Even as I sank into the comfort of accepting that Watson now held my heart in his hands, tears came afresh when I remembered that we had only one more day in Folkestone, and then it would be time to catch the train home.
My God, the infinite potential physiological incompatibilities were bad enough, but how were children born at all if there were in addition so many environmental factors which sought to thwart their conception? These advisements, by the way, ran in contradiction to warnings elsewhere that extramarital congress of any kind would surely result in the birth of a bastard.
, as carrying on the tradition of Galahad, of Joan of Arc, warriors whose blades struck true because they belonged to no one but the Creator. Of course, every man wishes to believe that his thoughts and deeds are virtuous, and may very well tie himself in knots to fortify such an illusion. But with every case solved, with every plot foiled, with every treasure recovered, I felt justified in laying another brick into the wall around my heart.
I reached for his prick, stroking it to amuse myself just as much as to please him. Knowing however that soon I would be accommodating his instrument in a new way made me uneasy. “You are so thickly made,” I whispered reverently, and he understood why I was remarking on this.
“Both.” Their teasing banter was punctuated by kisses. “Have you been enjoying the favors of any of the lovely young things in London?” Holmes asked this teasingly, and stroked Watson’s chest hair as he did so.
. This gave me grave concern about the Scandinavian peoples, for whom (I knew from my readings on all the countries of the world) having blue eyes was as prevalent as having a nose or ears.
The bedroom called us back, though, and once all of the aforementioned pressing bodily needs had been satisfied, we felt free to give in to mere desire. We ended up on the rumpled sheets, dressing gowns open and nightshirts rucked up, playing with each other’s pricks in the warm sunlight that filtered through the gauzy curtains, until we’d spent ourselves dry. Then we lolled on the bed awhile, before finally admitting to ourselves that we must go out that day for proper sustenance.
I could only nod silently, wide-eyed and slack-jawed. He was as unashamedly eager as I was, to my relief and delight; scrambling up onto the bed, he made a space for himself between my wantonly spread legs as he rucked up his nightshirt and showed me his stiff prick.
“That’s right,” Watson murmured. What he did next with his member, I did not think it was actually possible to do, from an anatomical standpoint. After all, Holmes had been having trouble getting all of it in his mouth, and now he was going to try fitting it all in
Having at last read every word of these books, I came to only one certain conclusion: that I must maintain my bodily integrity at any cost. And that, to me, meant a life of disciplined solitude. Rather than try to navigate these complex and mystifying requirements, perfect chastity of both mind and body seemed the plain and easy rule. I would continue to make careful habits of proper bodily maintenance, and eschew licentious exercises of the mind, and if I avoided marriage, I would not be obligated to puzzle out the precise amount of sexual indulgence to keep my organs intact and my mind sharp without driving some unfortunate woman to uterine epilepsy.
When I was away from the books, and better able to reflect on them, it all seemed odd to me – why would we be created this way? Why were we so susceptible to vices which were so deleterious to our person? And why would only the sexual need be so harmful, and not others? After all, when we are hungry, we eat, because it is necessary to eat; when we are thirsty, our bodies are telling us that we need drink. So why, if we have a different kind of hunger or thirst in our bodies, do we acknowledge it at our peril? (Being young and not wise, this contradiction did not prompt me to question, or disregard entirely, the advice against self-pollution; it served more to discourage me from eating and drinking when necessary, as I assumed that those urges must be overstated by our bodily organs as well. This became a lifelong habit to which I still cling, especially in times of excitement or distress.)
I stammered, “Yes…?” I did feel incredibly stupid, after his passionate assault on my person, for having ever been satisfied with such perfunctory relief as I was administering to myself at the moment. But Watson’s next remark was, “You work so slowly at yourself.”
it, reared and trained to make our way in this world independently and rarefied by our experience of it.
Watson made it clear, to me and to his readers, that he had admired me since the day we met, but I became greedy, not content with indulging in these thoughts but desiring a more earthly admiration from him, a reciprocation of my ravenous cravings. I recall one particular night: the night of the downfall of Baroness Ilsa Flitzwig. In the ballroom at the end of the evening, and later, in the cab, Watson and I maintained a steely silence, as everything that had happened to us at the ball had concerned matters of national security. As soon as we were safely ensconced in our rooms, however, he cried out, “I cannot believe that the master spy turned out to be a...well, a
At first I didn’t think I could ensconce myself there in time, except Holmes and Watson were taking their time climbing the stairs. Once I did see them, however, all thought of giving Holmes a start fled my mind completely, for the surprise I felt seeing him and Watson could not be surpassed.
I couldn’t understand why he had insisted on being able to see my face; as he sank his prick inside me, my eyes rolled back and I gasped open-mouthed like a landed fish, and I cannot imagine that looked the least bit alluring. But I couldn’t help it, I was out of control with excitement, feeling him finally push his prick up into me. It felt even better than his fingers had, so much smoother and fuller, and I knew it was better for him, as well, because his breath was coming in little sobs as I engulfed him.
The more we came to know each other, and the more he showed himself to be an ideal friend and colleague, the more ridiculous I found it that
What I can tell you is that as I grew to full manhood, I discovered that not everyone who indulged in vice (of whatever variety) became a hopeless wretch. A taste of alcohol, a pipeful of tobacco, these habits were too common among the most respectable of figures. After leaving home to attend university, the growing disconnect between what I had read and what I experienced prompted me to sample those two substances, and yes, narcotics as well (cocaine was introduced to me as a necessary pain reliever, but as is often the case, this led to that occasional recreational use which Watson found so abhorrent). Having made myself the subject of these experiments, I dispensed with any habit I saw as being only disadvantageous, but maintained some whose ill effects were outweighed by what I considered to be benefits.
A day came when I could stand it no longer: I simply had to find out if there was any chance that Watson might return my affections. It was a perilous time for those accused of gross indecency; one might face years of hard labour for their indiscretions. But I was certain that I could at least inquire into Watson’s inclinations without danger, for two reasons: first, I believed that I could make this inquiry with subtlety, in a way which could easily be waved away as a misunderstanding if he reacted with disgust. Second, I knew Watson to be the soul of discretion; just as he would never betray a patient’s trust, certainly he would not run to tell the police a gruesome tale if my advance was unwelcome. Knowing he would keep my secret gave me the courage to risk his rejection.
meaning “delight,” it is not certain, and probably does not matter. In any case, this trunk was loaded with them, a collection spanning ten centuries and all manner of materials – polished stone, lacquered wood, buffalo horn. Some were stylized, with flourishes that gave them the appearance of a whole humanoid form, or a creature of some kind, or a scepter; others bore a startling resemblance to an actual organ. None were the latest models, which were made of India rubber, nor were any constructed of more perishable materials, such as leather. I knew that the British Museum, though they would never display such items as this, had crates upon crates of them locked away from prying eyes and delicate sensibilities; this was only the tiniest sampling.
His warm eyes were shining – how they grew still warmer whenever they regarded me! – and I flushed up. In the past, that would have been the end of it, but now I wished desperately to say to him,
I was so uncontrollably libidinous with anticipation, I could not help but rub myself all over Watson in the bath, whilst I babbled about how badly I wanted him to have me, how honored I was to fall into his capable hands, how certain I was that his prick would feel like heaven in me.
I played with it like this until he begged me to not stop, to never stop; when he spent, he nearly caught me in the eye with it, but I would not have traded the intimate vantage point, it was so astoundingly lewd but at the same time so tender to watch him lose control and erupt in fierce, spasmodic jets.
And so on. None of this should come as a surprise to anyone who has read the tales of my exploits dramatised (and too often romanticised) by Doctor John Watson. But there was one shelf of books which was to have a different but equally powerful lifelong influence on me, an influence that is only hinted at in those stories devoured by
He shifted forward, and when I felt his breath on my lips, I opened my mouth slightly to welcome him. Then he turned away. “Someone might see us,” he said.
For once, he heeded my request to stop teasing, no doubt because he was as taken by animal lust as I was. He entered me again, and I moaned to feel it slip so easily up me this time. He began with slow strokes, which went so deep that I howled with it, and he took this as encouragement to have me vigorously, pounding with such force that I could not move or speak or think. I lowered my head and chest to the bed, hoping to find relief in a change of position, not expecting that doing so would instead make his prick go deeper still. When the intensity became unbearable, I managed to shout enough and drag myself far enough forward to bring things to a brief halt. “
The sinister spectre of self-abuse had haunted my adolescence only occasionally, and in my adulthood with even less frequency. I had gone about mostly untroubled by the physical charms of those around me, and it was a rare day when vigorous exercise and a self-imposed spartan lifestyle (or the overwhelming weight of one of my black moods) proved insufficient at keeping at bay those few urges that did manifest.
With only a little nervous hesitation, Watson obliged me, leaning close and touching his lips to mine, which warmed me all over.
Watson’s strength and bravery had not just been practical and useful that day – watching him had given me a
He encouraged me to stroke my own prick at my preferred pace, so that he could concentrate all his efforts on servicing me with his own formidable staff. I squeezed and pulled at my prick, but the feeling was as nothing, just a morsel of supplementary pleasure, compared to what Watson was putting in me. When I could feel the inevitability of my orgasm, I gave him half a minute or so of warnings, pleas, and promises, and then at last my whole body ignited in a conflagration of ecstasy, and I begged him to take his own pleasure inside me at once.
I’m not certain that my feet ever touched the ground on the walk back. I had no idea what pleasures were in store that evening, but the details mattered little to me; my heart was soaring with anticipation.
Being as the sex drive is so powerful and consuming a force in a person, its absence leaves so much space inside those who lack it. For me, this space was devoted to my profession, to understanding and thwarting crime wherever possible. I excelled at what I did because I had the wherewithal to devote so much of myself to it, so much more than nearly any other person could. In fact, over time, I came to think of my celibacy as not merely instinctive but
After our meal, Watson insisted on a stroll along the strand – there was a boardwalk to keep our shoes out of the sand, at least. As we walked, he told me of the times on the west coast of India where he had watched the sun sink into the sea at this time of day, and how enchanting it was. I myself had not seen such a thing, only two or three sunrises over eastern coasts such as this one, but I could not imagine that these sunsets of Watson’s were any more of a sight to see. I asked him for more details nonetheless, as these days I was enamoured of hearing him speak of fond memories.
. It was nothing new for me to admire Watson’s fortuitous confluence of qualities: Strength means nothing if you have not the will to employ it when necessary, and bravery means nothing if you have not the skill to exhibit it effectively, and it is a rare man who has an equal command of both virtues. As I thought of Watson being that rare man (and not for the first time in my presence), my heart swelled. I was suddenly much more confident than I had been, reading those books as a bewildered adolescent, about what qualities comprised a “very masculine” man.
By the time we returned to the cottage, we were quite ready for bed. We looked in on the second bedroom, which was little more than a closet. Both of us had endured far worse overnight accommodations in our lives; nevertheless, I declared that there was no reason to use this room, when the spacious master bed was plenty for both of us, and as we kept dissimilar hours, any time one of us was up and about, the other would have the whole thing to himself. Anyway, it wouldn’t be the first time we’d shared a bed away from home.
“Ah, but it only seems trivial to you and I,” I replied. “To that boy it meant the whole world, no less than stolen diplomatic papers or heirloom jewelry mean the world to my clients in London.”
The morning began almost unremarkably, save for the fact that Watson and I awoke naked and in each other’s arms; each of us braved the sunlight streaming in the windows with our usual grumbling lethargy, compelled to rise by our demandingly full bladders. We splashed water on our faces, donned nightshirts and dressing gowns for decency’s sake, then shuffled out to the kitchen, to nibble at the picnic leftovers – our intention had been to collect more comestibles to fill the larder on our way home from the picnic, but now we were paying for our having gotten distracted, with only a few slices of cold meat and cheese to sustain us.
