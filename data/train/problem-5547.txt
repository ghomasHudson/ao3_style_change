“Right. Context. You need context. Steve found Bucky Barnes, who now has cat ears, cat eyes, and a tail. Steve asked me to let him live with us in the Tower. I’m building a new arm for Bucky. I don’t want Hydra tech in my building! I guess I fell asleep, and Bucky tried to help fix the arm. But he broke another part. I kind of yelled at him a little bit, then went back to my workshop to fix it. Bucky was just here. He put a dead bird...I think it’s a pigeon...on my worktable, threatened to murder me in Russian, and left!” ‘
“This,” the blond said, pointing to the bags, “is the horses’ feed...their food.” He then pointed a large rectangular container. “And this is the bin that the horses’ feed goes into. What I’d like you to do is pour every bit of feed from all of the bags into the bin. Can you do that?” Tony nodded. Of course he could. ‘
Soon he was walking to the stables. When he got there, and Steve looked at him, the riding instructor rubbed his temples. “When I told you to wear something casual, that is
“Yeah, but to where?” Bucky asked, looking up from the bench he was sitting on, with JR fast asleep on his lap.
“Steve?” Bruce said quietly. “Maybe we should do this another time. When Bucky is more comfortable being in the Tower. I can just do a quick check to make sure he’s healthy, then we can talk about the ears and tail situation later. It won’t take long. Maybe five minutes.” He began his exam and was done within a few minutes. “Well, I don’t know about the cat-side of things, but from a human perspective, you are completely fine!” Bucky grinned and gave the doctor a quick hug, surprising everyone in the room.
When Tony came closer, Steve noticed the dark circles under his eyes, but decided not to say anything about it.
As the elevator started moving, F.R.I.D.A.Y. spoke up again. “Captain, Doctor Banner has just informed me that he’d like to meet you and Bucky in the medbay. Shall I take you there instead?”
“You got it. I’ve been calling him JR. And JR isn’t safe! We need to leave New York as soon as possible. Ross will do
They heard Peter by the door. “Hey Mr. Rogers, Prince Anthony, May let me go with you, but she said that I would have to be back by Friday.”
? Are you ok? Do we have to get you to medbay? Is everyone else ok? How was your mission? Did you take down Hydra?” Bucky turned to wake up the businessman.
’ He pulled a pencil out of his pocket, flipped to a blank page in his notebook and started sketching. Just as he was finishing his drawing of the sleeping royal, Tony woke up.
Steve grinned and both men finally got onto the elevator. “Could you take us to Doctor Banner’s lab, please?” he asked. “I think he’s expecting us.”
After grooming the king’s horse, Tess, a dark chocolate brown mare with a black mane and tail, the riding instructor got to work grooming Lightning, Arrow, Patriot, and Falcon, the knights' horses. No one had ever seen such fast and agile horses. The knights hadn’t known that when they picked the little foals to be theirs, or that all of them had picked horses from the same breed. They were tall, honey-colored horses with manes almost the same color, except for Patriot, who had a series of dark brown star-shaped freckles on its right hip. Soon, Steve came back to the prince’s side. “All finished?”
“You’re welcome. And we’ll cancel your morning lesson tomorrow so you can rest.” He got into bed next to the royal. “Good night, Tony.” Steve closed his eyes, but just as he was about to fall asleep, the prince broke the silence.
He dropped his umbrella, quickly walked over, stanched up the hat, ran to the super-soldier, who was crouched on the ground, and crammed it on Bucky’s head before anyone could see the cat ears.
Tony sat by the table, working on a tiny piece with a magnifying glass, his back arched in a way that made the former assassin wonder if it hurt to sit like that for hours, but never heard him complaining. The mechanic pulled over a chair for the feline, who sat down before crossing his arms over the table and letting his chin rest on them, silently watching the businessman work. After a few more minutes, the man known as Iron Man finally spoke.
“Yes, you fixed the elbow. Congratulations,” the genius said sarcastically. “But you fucked up something else on your new arm which I now have to go back and fix, which will take me even longer than if you hadn’t done anything.” He pulled the arm out from behind his back. Steve burst out laughing when he saw the fist flipping Bucky off. “
“Oh. Um...I might be late in the morning. I’m being forced to go to a ball in Jotunheim tonight and I’m not sure what time I’ll get back.”
“Here you go, Boss. ‘I don’t remember. Hydra never used anesthesia when they would perform surgery on me, so I passed out from the pain. And they would put me through mind wipes after every mission, and every time their
“Don’t forget your communicator, Sir!” Happy held out a gold cuff bracelet, with various adornments, that vibrated softly when there was a holographic call and opened a hologram if it was pressed twice. The communicator could also send text messages if the sides of the device were pinched. It was fairly easy to use, didn't look like a technological device at all, and everyone in the castle and on its grounds, except for the king, was required to wear one. Tony took it and slipped it over his left wrist.
“Yes, but I’m not allowed to talk about it, Steve. He swore me to secrecy. Maybe you should ask him on your next date.” She chuckled at the implication that Steve was dating the prince. “But right now, Tony has places to be, and I have to go along. It was nice talking to you...
“What’s going on?” He was a genius, but he was struggling to put the pieces together, which annoyed him, and made his words seem harsh.
“I want you and Barnes to pack your bags as fast as you can, and start the quinjet. We’ll intercept once you’re in the air,” he said in a rush.
“That will take too long! It’s going to be a lot faster if I just take him myself!” He pushed past the man, and quickly walked to the elevator, leaving the other man in JR’s former “room”. As the doors closed, the genius was finally able to take a deep breath. ‘
“That’s not a real thing, and you know it, Stark!” JR chose that moment to faint. Thankfully, Tony was able to catch him before he hit his head on the cement floor. He scooped the kid into his arms. “Move, Ross. I have to get him to a doctor!”
“Yes, of course, love.” Tony placed a chaste kiss on Steve's knuckles. “Go to sleep, Pep. I’ll talk to you tomorrow.” He kissed her cheek and followed the blond to his room.
“Because if Hydra decides to take advantage of our not being home to get their so-called weapon back, someone needs to stay here and help Bucky.”
“I know, sweetheart.” She put a hand on the prince’s face, stroking his cheek with her thumb. “You are so handsome,” she told Tony. Steve tried to intervene but she ignored him. “You look so much like your father.”
’ “Alright. I’ll meet you at the stables in an hour. Wear something...I’m not even sure if you have anything like this, but wear something casual. Something that you won’t care if you get dirty. And work boots, if you have any. But nothing fancy!”
“Coward,” the captain muttered, then spoke up. “Cliff’s Notes version: Bucky fell off a train in nineteen-forty-five, got kidnapped by Hydra, given
He dried his own tears and helped Steve clear the table, trying to mask his sadness. Sarah came back in the room and saw Tony with plates in his hands.
“Alright. How was your evening? I bet it was great. Mine was like every other evening. I fed and groomed the horses, then I took a ride on my horse, America. That’s the one with a white patch that looks like a star on his forehead. I always end up smelling like a horse after spending so much time around them, but I love what I do, so I guess it’s worth it. You mumbled a little while you were asleep this morning. It was very cute.” The riding instructor looked over at Tony and saw that he was fast asleep...and snoring a little bit. “Huh. I guess my voice really
“I slept great!” Tony grinned. “Thank you for letting me stay. I’m not sure if I’ve thanked you yet. I should have. I really do appreciate it. You didn’t have to. I know I’m the prince and you’re my instructor, but you could have said no and—”
“Go lie down. On your back, please.” Once Steve did as the prince asked, Tony got in the bed, too, from the other side, and lay so he was on his side, with his head on the blond’s chest and his arms and one leg around the other man. He untangled himself for a second to grab the blanket, then got right back into his previous position. “Comfortable? Warm enough?” he asked.
Two hours later, Tony walked out of the castle and toward the livery yard where Steve was waiting for him. “Good morning!” he called when he was within hearing distance of his instructor, who was moving barrels of hay.
“What is it, Barnes? I’m busy trying to fix your fuck-up,” the billionaire greeted him as he walked in. The hybrid stood there for a second, not saying anything. “Still don’t feel up to talking to me? Ok. Let me go get a notepad and pen for you, so you can write out an apology.” He stood up from where he’d been sitting next to Bucky’s new arm and went to the other side of the room. As soon as his back was turned, the super-soldier pulled the bird out of his pocket, put it next to the other man’s project, said a quick “извиняюсь”, and ran out of the room, all before Tony could turn back around.
Tony sighed, but dropped the subject. He took the garment from Happy and went to bathe. Soon, he was ready, and, after putting a pack of cigarettes and a lighter into his pocket, made the long walk to the throne room on the other side of the castle, where his parents were waiting.
“No, thanks, Stevie. I already have something I can give him!” He stood up and ran to his room to collect the pigeon he had fought with, killed, and snuck into the house that morning, all without Steve knowing about it. He had originally been planning to give it to the blond as a “thank you” for helping him, but this was better. Bucky started purring as he put the bird into his pocket and left his room, then walked to the elevator and went back to Tony’s workshop. ‘
“Agreed. Now, I hate to say this, but I think Buckitty should start talking to somebody sooner rather than later. Our kitten needs more help than we can give him.”
to detach that arm and put on the one that Tony made. And Doctor Strange should consult on it since Bucky needs the synapses in his brain to fire correctly to work his arm. I’d like to get it done as soon as possible.” He turned to Tony. “Are you available to assist me tomorrow morning? I’ll need help with attaching the new arm.” The genius nodded.
“I believe Stark should attach it. He is the most experienced, after all,” Stephen Strange commented. Tony asked him to assist them through video-conference.
“Hi, Buck! Stark thought it might be a nice surprise if I painted something on your arm. He said I could paint whatever I wanted as long as it wasn’t the red star that you had before. I chose my shield, but I’m making a few changes to how it looks, so you get your own design, and not just an exact copy. What do you think?”
“Crap,” Tony swore quietly. “We shouldn’t go to Clint’s. That safe house… safe farm?... was given to him by S.H.I.E.L.D., which means that they know about it. JR won’t be safe there! And this is their quinjet! They probably have a GPS tracker on it. No, I’m gonna go wake up the kid and take him someplace safer. I wonder if T’Challa will let us stay?” He took a step toward the sleeping child but wasn’t able to get any closer because the captain had a firm grip on his shoulder.
The riding instructor stared at him. “A few…?” He opened the door fully. “Come in. I can’t believe no one has done anything to help you before now! Don’t they care that their prince is suffering?! I am seriously thinking about waking up Their Majesties, just so I can ask them why they’ve never done anything to help you. Years! Get under the covers. It’s time for bed.”
The genius was asleep before Bucky had even gotten half-way through the lullaby, so he missed JR’s sleepy “I love you, Mama” as he too drifted off to sleep.
“I’ll be there in a few minutes.” The queen nodded and closed her end of the call. The prince tapped on Steve’s hologram and was reconnected with him. “Hi. I’m really sorry, but I have to go. We have guests coming, and my father and mum want me to be there to greet them.”
“Queen Peggy told me all about the ball they went to last night. Apparently there were about a hundred princesses for Prince Anthony to talk to, but he didn’t want anything to do with any of them. The king was very displeased,” Natasha said.
“I might,” Tony yelled back. “He’s the only one who’s ever treated me like a human being around here!”
As he was finishing emptying the first bag, he heard his instructor’s voice. “Come on, Rose. Come on, girl,” the man spoke softly to a yellowish tan-colored horse, who had a white stripe down her nose and a white mane. ‘
“Not at all, pr...Tony.” He seemed uncomfortable. “Friday is a very well behaved horse. I trained her myself!”
“Yeah...he did,” Steve frowned, wondering how she found out about it. “How did you...how did you know?”
“I’m sorry, JR. But you don’t need to worry. You’re going someplace where you’ll be safe and happy. We’re going to take really good care of you. I promise!” JR nodded, still looking a little sad from having to talk about Grampa Stan, but suddenly perked up. The jet!
“Come on, Your Highness. Time for bed.” Steve stood up and lead the prince up a small ladder that Tony hadn’t noticed when he arrived, which lead to an attic bedroom. There were high windows on either side of the room, a desk and chair under the window on the left-hand side, and a bed with a twin mattress facing the door.
and you didn’t even like me enough to feel jealous. God, I suck at this,” the royal muttered to himself.
Steve saw the smirk on the other man’s face, but his mind told him the royal was either playing with his feelings or it was just a mistake. He took a moment to think about it, and realized it was probably the latter, since the Queen called everyone who worked in the castle “darling”, so maybe Tony just picked up her habit.
“Barnes!” Tony called angrily once he was on the captain’s floor. “What the fuck did you do to my project?”
“Hey, Mister Rogers! Can you give this to your ma…” The boy froze as he saw the prince’s face smiling at him. “Tha-that is the prince!”
“Very large, very sharp teeth and beady eyes at one end, and a tail that could knock me off my feet at the other. Not to mention the hooves that could crush my bones, and the fact that it could decide to sit on me, which would probably kill me instantly.”
“Fine,” he grumbled. Tony closed his eyes. Just as he was about to fall asleep, JR woke up from his nap with a startled gasp, bolting up into a sitting position.
He heard footsteps behind him and quickly turned around to see Tony entering the kitchen. He had dark bags under his eyes.
“We should let him sleep. He’s had a long day. Don’t worry so much, Tony. We found and disabled the tracker. And no one knows about the farm. Clint told me that he went directly to Fury, so there’s no papertrail. The kid will be safe there.” The billionaire sighed and nodded.
! It was a solid piece of vibranium, without overlapping plates like the one he was currently using, except for the joints, which were made out of steel. And, best of all, there was no red star on the shoulder.
“We don’t have a guest room, so you’ll have to stay in Stevie’s room. I hope that’s alright…?” She looked around as if she was trying to come up with another option for Tony, if he said that
“So, it’s from spending too much time with Hydra,” Tony muttered to himself as he used a magazine to sweep the bird into a garbage can. “Well, it makes sense that their level of crazy would rub off on Buckitty. Buckitty… Buck kitty. Kitty. Oh. Wait a minute!” He grabbed a Starkpad and did some research. “Well, of course he would bring me a dead bird. Cats bring their owners gifts sometimes! It all makes sense. He came to apologize, and brought me a present. That’s...a little creepy, but kinda sweet, too!” The billionaire sighed and got back to work on the prosthetic.
“This way, Mister Stark.” The agent lead him into an elevator and they travelled down several floors. The genius frowned.
“I’m not interested in her, Steve, or really women in general. Especially after last night.” The blond man frowned. “They were all boring and gossipy, and…the only reason I slept with Christine is because she‘s always been able to distract me from my loneliness.” Tony sighed. “I wanted you to come with me, but my father wouldn’t allow it. I asked.”
When he got there, he walked up to the receptionist’s desk. “Hi. I heard that S.H.I.E.L.D. uncovered some illegal experiments. I’d like to see them.”
’ He tried to sit up to look around, but found himself pinned to the bed by somebody’s arm. The prince looked over to find the source of his immobility. ‘
“It has to do with the horses,” the riding instructor said, thinking that would make the royal change his mind. “Grooming and feeding them, mucking out stalls, cleaning equipment, things like that. Are you
“Hello to you, too,” the former Hydra assassin said grumpily, but took the child, who immediately became fascinated by the man’s cat ears that were so similar to his own. Tony rolled his eyes as the suit slowly went back to the place it was housed on his chest.
’ As he reached his hand forward to grab a screwdriver and fix the elbow joint that keep falling off the main structure, he heard beeps behind him. Bucky turned just in time to see Steve open the door and walk in.
The captain unlocked the door and headed for the lobby elevator. “F.R.I.D.A.Y.?” he said, looking at the left-hand corner of the ceiling. “This is my friend, Sergeant Barnes. He’s going to be living here in the Tower from now on. Could you please add him to your list of approved people, and help him with whatever he needs?”
“She...she’s not my friend, Steve. Just because I’m a prince, that doesn’t mean I’m always surrounded by friends. Well, that depends on what you define as ‘friends’.”
“I know. Your mom told me,” Tony whispered back, having woken up when he heard the other man’s voice.
“For now. Hopefully Laura will let us stay for a while. At least long enough for us to come up with a plan to protect this adorable little kitty-cat. Who doesn’t seem to like heights very much.” He turned to the child, who was whimpering in fear and holding on for dear life. They were
“I heard that, too. But I also heard that after Their Majesties left the ball, the prince decided to stay the night because he wanted to...
“Tony!” Steve interrupted, removing his arm from around the other man and sitting up. “You’re welcome. Now, if you’ll excuse me, Your Highness, I have chores to see to this morning. You’re welcome to stay here and go back to sleep, or do so back in your own bed. Either way, I’ll see you this afternoon for your lessons.”
“If you don’t stop, you’ll knock it out of my hand, and then your hair will stay wet, and you’ll get sick. Is that what you want?” The hybrid shook his head. “Alright, then hold still.”
“We both know I can’t do that.” He felt that annoying headache in the center of his forehead. Bucky reached forward, pulled down him onto the bench, and placed a kiss right on top of the spot that Tony’s hands previously were, trying to soothe the pain.
“Yes, Sir! Happy birthday!” Jarvis said in a softer tone. The prince groaned in response and rolled over, trying to go back to sleep. “I do apologize, Your Highness, but you cannot go back to sleep right now. Their Majesties are waiting for you in the throne room.”
Briefly remembering a song that his handler in Hydra sang to him during their missions, he whispered the lyrics to himself, trying to fall back asleep.
the scandal! Howard was already married to Queen Peggy when he met your mother, but that didn’t matter to either one of them. Maria, and everyone else, truly believed Howard when he said he would leave his wife, but then he changed his mind after she told him about you. Didn’t want anything to do with either one of you. After she died, you were sent to an orphanage for a few days. Everyone in the village knew perfectly well who your father was, so rumors started spreading about the cruel king who refused to take care of his son after the sudden death of his mother, and just a few hours after giving birth, too.”
Bucky looked up at Avengers Tower. Now that he was standing outside of his new home, he wasn’t so sure living there was a good idea. “Steve…” he whispered, taking a step back.
The prince nodded and exited the room. As soon as the doors closed behind him, he asked Pepper to arrange for him to have a carriage of his own, both so that he wouldn’t have to be around his father more than what was absolutely necessary and so he could leave later than his parents on the off chance that he found someone to sleep with. He then asked Jarvis and Happy to lay out his dark green suit and a fur cloak.
Bruce looked down and pinched the bridge of his nose. When he looked back up, his eyes were green. “I’m sorry. I need to...not be here for a few minutes. The Other Guy wants to come out and” his voice suddenly changed to Hulk’s deeper growl, “smash puny men who hurt Kitty!” The scientist blinked and his eyes turned back to their usual brown color. “I’ll be back...eventually.” He turned and walked out of the workshop.
“I'm sorry, Prince Anthony. There’s a matter that your parents would like to discuss with you immediately,” Happy said, going to the young royal’s wardrobe and pulling out a garment.
“Well, first, we put Bucky’s new arm on. Then we Assemble and come up with a plan for going after fucking Hydra,” Tony said decisively. Steve nodded.
. But that wasn’t the problem!” He shoved the arm into Bucky’s face again, then turned and walked back to the elevator and disappeared from view, taking the prosthetic with him.
holding cells are only for the most dangerous experiments. The less dangerous ones are put in cells higher up.” Tony was lead out of the elevator and down a long hallway to the right. They stopped at a heavy metal door on the left-hand side just before the hall intersected with another one. The agent unlocked the door to reveal a tiny room with just enough space for a twin bed, table, and lamp.
…so horribly, hybrid or not. He walked into his bedroom and put his gear on the bed. After taking a shower and grabbing a sketchbook and pencil, the captain went into the living room to sit down and draw for a while. Walking in, he saw the other two men laying on the couch, fast asleep and cuddling. He smiled, then leaned over to cover them with the blanket that was on the back of the couch. He sat in the couch across from the one that the genius and hybrid were on and began to draw. When the super-soldier was almost done, there was a noise from the other couch.
“Hi, Steve. Tony went down to his workshop to get started on a design for Bucky’s new arm. He wants both of you to go down there when you’re done here. Hello, Bucky! My name is Bruce. Tony and Steve asked me to take a look at you, just to make sure you’re healthy. And maybe see if I can help you with your ears and tail. Is that ok?” Bruce’s voice was calm, gentle, and soothing, so Bucky immediately felt relaxed around him and nodded. “Good! Could you take off your hat and hoodie for me, please?” The hybrid did as the doctor asked. “Thank you. Now, let me take a look…” He reached up and gently parted the super-soldier’s hair. After a few minutes, he stopped and took a step back. “Well, I’ll have to consult with a friend of mine, who’s a neurosurgeon, or he was before his accident... and run a few tests…” Bucky interrupted him with an inhuman screech, and ran for the door.
Steve let go of the hug. His fingers traced the apples of Tony’s cheeks lightly to clean off the tears.
“I...It’s complicated. My father and I, we…” The other man started sobbing, and could no longer look at his instructor.
have to shorten them, make sure everything else is still even. Now you can untie her, unbuckle the lead rope from the halter, and take the halter off. You’re done getting her ready! Ok. Only one thing left to do. Getting into the saddle! Stand on her left side and put your left foot into the stirrup. Grab both sides of the saddle for balance.” Steve got behind Tony and held onto the prince’s waist to make sure he didn’t fall. “Now, using both the stirrup and the saddle as leverage, pull yourself up and over the saddle, swinging your right leg over her at the same time. Exactly! You did great, Tony!” He grinned up at his student. “I’m really proud of you!”
step is to put a halter on the horse, with a lead rope attached to it, and use that to tie her to a post, so she stays put.”
’ The prince got out of bed, left his chambers, and walked down the hall to where the guest bedchamber was. Taking a deep breath, he knocked on the door. After a few minutes, the door opened to reveal the other man, who had quite obviously been sleeping.
A few minutes later, she reached them at the stables, telling Tony to go change back into his lavender suit. When he was gone, Pepper turned to the blond.
“Careful, Bucky. I was stabbed there,” Steve winced when one of the feline’s arms pressed too hard against his side.
“Have a good day, Captain.” She turned and followed her partner back down the hall. Steve frowned again, then went to his debriefing.
Once they were far enough away that getting shot was no longer a concern, Tony called Steve and Bucky to warn them of the danger.
!” He took a deep breath to try and control his temper. “I really fucking hate people sometimes. Especially fucking Hydra.”
Bucky was back in a few minutes, and walked in to see Steve with a brush in one hand and a hairdryer in the other. As soon as it was switched on, the brunet hissed and started batting at the hot air.
“I’m sorry about what I said before, sweetheart. I didn’t know it would get the worst of you,” she said later, as they walked around a nearby pond.
Oh my god…” The prince was interrupted from whatever he was going to say next by a notification on his communicator that Queen Peggy was contacting him. “Hey, Steve? Could you hold on a minute? My mother wants to talk to me.”
“‘James Roger Stark, Junior’. I hope you two don’t mind. Having my last name will give him a bit of protection. And he’s a Buckitty Junior, so that’s where ‘James, Junior’ came from.”
Bucky wondered if the other man was just upset and ignoring him for his own sake, or if he had done something wrong, but all of his doubts went away as soon as the space between his cat ears, on top of his head, was petted.
They heard the workshop door open. Steve stood in the doorway, his hair still wet from taking a shower first thing in the morning, and the feline wondered how the shirt he was wearing didn’t rip from how tight it was.
“I know it’s late, or early...and you’re tired, but...would you talk to me for a few minutes? Your voice will calm me down enough to sleep without getting a night terror. So...please?”
Steve stayed silent, with a blank expression on his face. He walked over to where Bucky was still kneeling, and slowly and gently reached his hand forward to rest it on the former assassin’s shoulder. As soon as it made contact, the feline let out a pitiful kitten-like cry, crawled into the captain’s lap, and wrapped his arms around the blond. Captain Rogers couldn’t think of anything to do except rub the man’s back to try to calm him.
The rest of the morning passed quickly due to the chores Steve was assigned to do. By noon he noticed that the prince hadn’t sent the message he promised to, and accepted that maybe he just decided to sleep a little longer after spending the whole night up, if the rumours he heard were true.
“The asshole, he...he knew I disliked horses. He does this shit to torture me!” Tony yelled, his face turning red, and the riding instructor frowned.
Femalemarvelfanatic and M1das thought it would be fun to have a little game at the end of this chapter. Since we never mention who the knights are, we want you to guess who they are, and tell us which horse belongs to which knight. The first person to get them all correct will get a cameo in the next chapter!
“Are you...afraid of horses?” The royal nodded. “Damn it. They should have told me that when they hired me. I’m sorry, Your Highness. I didn’t know. What is it that scares you about them?”
“Excuse me?” They all turned to see a woman, wearing blue-gray scrubs that perfectly matched her eyes, standing close by. “My name is Cilly. I’m one of the nurses here for the Tower’s medbay.” The woman, who had half-bleached and half-shaved hair, slowly walked up to Bucky. “While the doctor is gone, may I take your vital signs?” she asked, speaking softly so as not to further scare the already nervous man. “I heard what Captain Rogers said about your past. I promise I won’t do anything more invasive than take your temperature. Captain, if you’d like to stay with your friend, you may.” Bucky nodded, and she lead the two men to another room with a bed, leaving the genius to go find Bruce, and calm him down if he could. “Please sit. I’d like to start with basic information so I can start a medical chart for you. Can you tell me your birthdate, how tall you are, and how much you weigh, Sergeant?”
“Hmmm...I’m sorry that my clothes don’t fit you very well,” the blond said when he looked at the royal. The shirt Tony was wearing went down to the middle of his thighs, and the boots made him look like he was a little kid playing dress-up with his father’s shoes. He just shrugged and waited for his question to be answered.
“Bucky?” The person looked up. It was a boy, maybe four years old, with light brown cat ears that looked just a little too big for his body, one of which was severely damaged. His hair was covered by what looked like a sock that had a large hole cut out of it for his face and two more holes on top for his little ears to poke through. He was wearing a large shirt that went past his knees and covered his hands. The child opened his mouth, revealing sharp teeth and a sandpaper tongue, and let out a tiny “hi!”. The captain frowned. He was about to speak when he heard the sound of people running. Looking up from the kid, he saw two agents, a man and a woman, approaching.
“You think I don’t know my own son, Prince Stark?” Tony flinched. He hated hearing his father’s name being used to refer to him.
“Let me finish, Stark! I thought it might have gotten lost and needed help finding its way home. But it wasn’t a cat…”
“Steven! Tony is our guest! You never make a guest do any work! I raised you better than that!” She took the plates out of the prince’s hand and gave them to her son. “Now, you do the cleaning up and set up for the surprise party you think I don’t know about, while
to chirp like a bird. The pigeon chirped again, and suddenly the former Hydra assassin lunged at the group of birds, and tried to catch the one he had been chirping to.
Steve looked back at whoever he had been talking to when the business owner arrived. “Come on. It’s ok. Tony’s here to help. He’s Howard’s son. You remember Howard, right? The man who made my shield?” Nobody responded, but there was a slight rustling noise as someone stood up. “Good. It’s ok. You’re safe. Tony wouldn’t hurt you.” Captain Rogers stood up and slowly lead somebody out of the shadows where they had been hiding. When the person was finally in view, Tony saw that whoever it was was wearing dark jeans, a hoodie that had been pulled up over their head, and a baseball cap that was pulled down low so he couldn’t see the other person’s eyes, and their chin was almost touching their chest.
“Since I heard you kidnapped a child that could be injured. Let me just give him a quick check-up and we can get the hell out of here.”
The former assassin lifted his arm in order to see the new symbol. It was a black star over an arc-reactor, with a thick red border around it. He grinned and purred.
Once Tony got to the library, he saw his father sitting at a table and reading something on his Starkphone. The king didn’t bother to look up as his son approached.
"Uh...your voice relaxes me a lot, and this morning was the first time I slept well, and without nightmares. Can I
“You are, but I remember your parents. Maria and Howard were always together...holding hands, kissing…” She sighed. “It was horrible the way Howard abandoned both of you when she got pregnant.”
“Great! Let’s go, Buckitty! We have lots to do! Including building you a new arm! I don’t want Hydra tech in the Tower longer than absolutely necessary!” Tony walked out of the alley, not looking to see if the other two men were following him, and missing the twin glares behind his back at the nickname.
The next morning, Steve woke up with his right arm numb. He looked down to see the prince still fast asleep. “I love you,” he whispered.
“We’re just talking about the plan for your new arm,” Tony said. “We think it would be best if you had one last surgery to detach the arm that fucking Hydra gave you, then reattach the one I made.”
“Bucky saw that you were stressed, so he tried to help by fixing the elbow for you,” the super-soldier translated for the businessman, deciding to leave out the parts about Hydra.
“You know that I wouldn’t mind if you talked to me, right?” Bucky nodded his head up and down. “You still won’t talk to me, will you?” He didn’t wait for an answer and grabbed a notepad he had lying around. “Write if you want to,” he said before going back to his work, starting over on the piece he had been working on since last night, but just couldn’t get right. His hands were shaking and he was almost falling asleep on top of the soldering iron, but refused to go to sleep until it was completed.
Steve then sat down on a bench that was close by and got out a small notebook, but Tony couldn’t really see where it came from. The prince sat down beside him, and the instructor started showing him beautiful drawings of horses with arrows indicating each part. Even though the prince tried to stay awake, Steve’s voice was soft and soothing, and he couldn’t help but to let his eyes close and sleep peacefully against the blond.
The man known as Iron Man was quiet for a few seconds. “I’ll help you explain things to Bruce, but I have conditions to Bucky living in the Tower.”
“‘I see you're struggling with the arm. You're beautiful when you're so focused on something, even though you look so tired. I wish I could make you sleep better, and cuddle you and Steve all night. I usually don't talk to you because I’m not really comfortable speaking. I’m not trying to be mean, I just… They used to hurt me if I spoke without being spoken to, so I don’t really talk anymore. I don’t think you’ll hurt me, but I’ve learned that it’s safer to not talk around people I don’t know that well. I’m sorry! I hope you don't hate me. Love your eyes. Kisses, Bucky’,” she responded after a moment. The mechanic frowned.
“What the fuck?” Steve muttered to himself as he watched the scene. As the minutes clicked by, with no end in sight to the soldier’s fight with the pigeon, the captain got more and more nervous. If he kept chasing the bird, his hat would fall off, and his secret would be exposed, which was something that the blond
“You did great,” the captain assured him, and the ringing in his ears stopped for a second. “Bucky is alright and in the recovery room. We’ll be able to see him in a few hours.”
“Oh! Hello, Steven. Do you need anything else today?” she asked, already packing the fruits the captain always asked for.
“There’s a set of pajamas in the closet,” the riding instructor said, pointing to a wardrobe on the right-hand side of the room, then he pointed to the foot of the bed, where a chest was sitting. “Extra blankets and another pillow are in that chest. I’ll be downstairs if you need me.”
Tony’s dirty gloves gripped the stretcher handles, and he was pretty sure his knuckles were white underneath it. He let go and his hands hurt from being so tense.
As Tony was saying “K is potassium” to himself, the riding instructor finally came out with a beautiful mahogany-brown horse with a black mane and tail. But the size of the horse made the young prince take several steps back, and Steve frowned.
“Mom, can you leave us alone for a second?” She nodded and went to the kitchen. Steve wrapped his arms around Tony’s torso in a hug. He could feel the prince hiccuping inside his arms.
“God, you’re attractive,” the royal said, not realizing that the words weren’t in his head until he saw the other man blush. He sat up a bit straighter and looked around. They were at a small cottage. There was a vegetable garden on one side of the front door, and a flower garden on the other. The prince could hear various animals a short distance away. ‘
“...I think it would be better if you saw this for yourself, rather than me explaining it over the phone,” Steve eventually said.
“I know, Buck. I don’t want to go either, but if this is the only way to keep you safe, then I have to.” Tony walked into the room. Steve and Bucky were sitting on the couch, with the feline in the captain’s lap, discussing the upcoming mission that the blond was supposed to leave for in an hour. It had been a week since the surgery, and the Avengers were finally ready to start going after Hydra. The hybrid rolled his eyes.
“I see. Well…” the nurse was interrupted by a knock on the door. Bruce had come back, this time looking a lot calmer than he had earlier.
. But that isn’t really important right now, since you’ll just be staying on my floor with me for a while. As for this doctor being like the ones at Hydra... he isn’t. I promise you, he’s
“You never told me you knew the prince!” His eyes were glowing, and he looked at the royal like he wasn’t real. “Can I take a picture with you?”
Steve sighed, then walked over to Bucky and gave him a hug, then loosened his arms, but kept them around his friend. “Listen to me. Ok, yes, the others might be a little bit surprised when they see you at first, but we’re the Avengers. We have a teammate who
“Ouch! I think I hurt my leg,” the prince complained when he tried to put weight on his left foot. “Can you help me back to the castle?”
Being in Avengers Tower had its benefits. It was at least one level higher than all of the other buildings around them, which meant he could watch the sunrise from the kitchen window while his coffee brewed. His friend had taught him how to use the coffee maker last night, and had even left out the instruction booklet in case he got confused. When it was finally finished, he poured himself a cup, and then burnt his tongue on the hot beverage.
The royal paused for a second. “Let me think about it while we get ready for bed.” The riding instructor nodded. A few minutes later, Tony had a solution that he was almost positive would work.
“Tony…” The prince scrunched up his nose and tried to go back to sleep. “Tony...we’re here.” He muttered a bit. “Come on, Tony. It’s time to wake up.” He sighed and opened his eyes to see Steve looking down at him.
“He won’t kill you. I promise. Come here.” Steve grabbed the horse’s reins with one hand and Tony’s hand with his other hand. Slowly, he put the prince’s hand on the horse’s mane and moved it in a petting motion. “Yes, horses are big, but they’re gentle creatures. They won’t hurt you if you don’t hurt them.”
“I’m sorry we had to wake you up early on your birthday, darling, but we have a surprise for you!” The queen looked pleased by something.
The other man shook his head. “Я не помню. Гидра никогда не применяла анестезию, когда они выполняли операцию на мне, поэтому я потерял сознание от боли. И после каждой миссии они вытащили меня через салфетки и каждый раз, когда их
“Then make sure you don’t get caught.” He slipped the agent a wad of cash, roughly five thousand dollars, then turned back to the kid and bent down to his level.
, Steve. I can’t... Please don’t make me go through that again! Please don’t let him or his friend hurt me,” he begged.
“Come on. It’s getting late. Bedtime for little kittens named Buckitty!” The feline felt his forehead being kissed right before falling back asleep.
“We’ll give you anesthesia, of course!” Bruce said, seeing that the feline was getting nervous. “And you’ll be able to sleep through the whole operation.” The former assassin didn’t look happy about going through another surgery, but he agreed, knowing that it was the best option.
“First make sure it’s the right size for her. If it’s too big, it will slide around in her mouth, but if it’s too small, it can pinch her. Now take off the part of the halter where the noseband is. Pick up the bridle from the top part with your left hand. Just let the rest of it dangle. Move the straps to the outside of the cheek pieces so they don’t get tangled up. Good! Now put the reins over her neck. Hold the bridle in your right hand. Hold it so  that the two sides are a good distance apart, with the crown up and the throatlatch straps hanging free and not tangled in any other straps.” The prince just stared at him blankly. “I mean the part that goes near her throat. That just makes sure her bridle doesn’t fall off. Grab the reins while you do it so that you don’t create loops for her to step in and keep all the straps off the ground. The next step is to have her drop her head so you can get the bit in her mouth.”
’), but after glancing in an alley, spotted the man, who was crouched down behind a dumpster and speaking softly. “Don’t worry,” he heard. “Everything’s going to be ok. I promise.” Tony opened the faceplate of his helmet and spoke up.
“Why are you so scared of horses, Tony?” he asked shamelessly. The brunet looked up from his task of cleaning a saddle.
That night Tony walked into the library, a large pitcher of mead in his hand, with plans to read all night to stay awake. “Damn night terrors…” the young royal muttered to himself. He put the pitcher on a table and walked over to the bookshelves. “Now, what to read?” He remembered a tale his maid had told him when he was a boy about a sick man who had learned that a war was starting in a distant kingdom. That man had miraculously become healthy after being exposed to gamma rays, then became the captain of the kingdom of Shield’s knights, fought and won many battles in that war, and had ultimately sacrificed his own life to save not only their land, but every other land as well, putting an end to the war. No one had known his name, or if someone did they were long dead, so he was simply called “The Captain”. Tony had fallen in love with science because of that story and been determined to learn everything he could about gamma rays and radiation. Now he looked through the shelves searching for a book about that very subject. Suddenly he stopped.
’ Steve realized, having seen a lot of stray cats when he was growing up in Brooklyn. “What’s wrong, pal?”
“The metal bar. The easiest way to do that is to give her a treat, like a carrot or a sugar cube. Hold the bit in the palm of your left hand, with your right forearm paralleling the top of her neck. Your right hand should be right next to her ears.
“Hi, kitten!” Tony said when Bucky walked in. The feline purred in response to the term of affection. “Your new arm is ready.”
“Yeah, Buck?” The blond turned from unlocking the front door to see his childhood friend trying to hide in the shadows, and his tail, which he had been hiding in the back of his hoodie, was dragging on the ground. ‘
Bucky was almost completely hidden under the shadow of the umbrella and behind Steve’s tall frame, holding the blond’s hand and keeping the metal one inside his pocket.
“Your turn, Stark,” Doctor Banner said, giving the mechanic some space. The nurse pulled his mask up on his face. He grabbed a small saw he had and cut most of the arm off before harshly dismounting everything around the shoulder.
“I’ll be fine. If it’s easier, I have my communicator, so I can send Happy a text and ask him to come get me.”
good at that.” The prince smiled. “Alright, you can help me tomorrow, as long as you can convince my mom to
“Ok. I pulled out a set of pajamas for you. Go put them on and come back here. We need to dry your hair.”
As soon as Tony turned around, Steve Rogers saw that the person he had been speaking to was the prince. He quickly dismounted from the horse he had been riding and knelt, his whole face turning red in shame.
“How about a break, boys? I made you breakfast,” he said before giving them a charming smile and going back to the kitchen. Both men immediately stood and followed him.
“It's fine, Your Highness. I know how busy your day can get when you’re trying to learn how to rule a kingdom,” Prince T’Challa replied, his sister, Princess Shuri, by his side.
“Hi! I missed you, too! Yeah, I was, but it healed pretty fast, so I’m fine. It’s just a little tender, is all. Everybody is alright. No one else was injured. You know I can’t give you details on the mission since you aren’t officially an Avenger yet, but we made some really good progress on finally taking them down permanently.”
The genius grabbed a Captain America mug from the dishwasher, filled it with coffee, and walked towards the elevator that lead to the workshop he had so carefully created for himself.
Steve looked at Bucky and they seemed to be having a silent conversation. Finally, the blond turned back to him and nodded. “Yes. Deal.”
“Shut up and listen, Stark! Loki isn’t trying to take over the world today. You know he waits until Thursdays to do that to mess with Thor. The Avengers don’t need to assemble, but I need you to get to my location as soon as possible. I’m across the street from the New York Medical College. There’s a...” The captain hesitated and turned to look in the alley behind him. “...situation that only you and I, and possibly Doctor Banner, can handle.”
Bucky looked proud of himself. “I fixed the elbow!” he whispered, happily, talking to Steve. “Anthony was stressed, so I helped! Zola taught me. And all my handlers made sure to break something on my arm after every wipe, to check that I still knew how to fix it. And I was always able to do it!”
want to happen. Making up his mind to tell his friend to back down, he took a step forward, only to stop and look on in fear as the hat did, in fact, fall off the brunette’s head.
“Yes, you did! Good job! Now you have to put on the bridle.” The royal stopped smiling. “Yeah. You aren’t quite done yet. Sorry!”
“Come back here!” The male agent walked over, picked the boy up by his armpits, and carried him back in the direction he had come from, still holding him by the armpits.
“I didn’t do anything...I just...let him stay after he told me he hasn’t had a good night’s sleep in a few years because of horrible nightmares. About that...you and Tony are pretty close, right? Do you know why he gets them?”
my gwampa. He was just a weally nice old man who took cawe of me when I was with A.I.M. He even made me this!” He reached a hand up to the pink material. “We watched a video on making a vest using a sock, but it was too small, so we made it into a hat! It even has little holes for my eaws! See?!” The kid bent his head down and pointed to his ears. “But he was nice to me, and he wasn’t supposed to be, so they killed him.” He sniffled sadly. “That was the day S.H.I.E.L.D. came.”
“Hi, Bucky! It’s nice to meet you!” Bruce smiled, then turned to Tony. “Could you tell me what I’m doing here, please?”
to. And I’ll even get permission from your mom so she doesn’t yell at you. After all...” Tony batted his eyelashes and tried to look as innocent as possible. “...you’re teaching me about horses, and how to ride them, and trying to help me get over my fear of them, and your mom was kind enough to allow me into her home and let me stay for the night. It just wouldn’t be fair of me not to do something to repay you for all the kindness you both have shown me.”
A/N: The song that Bucky sings in this chapter, and in Chapter 3, is a Russian lullaby entitled “Котя, котенька, коток”. Here are the lyrics in English:
“Hi, Ma. Happy birthday!” He leaned down to hug her. The older lady was almost Tony’s height, and her blond hair almost unnoticeable within the white hair. One of her eyes was completely white. “This is Tony. Tony, this is my mom, Sarah.”
“Yes, Tony, you have to. Good! You’re almost done. Buckle the throatlatch. Check that you can get four fingers between that strap and her neck. It needs to be loose enough to maintain slack, even when her head is bent down. Now check that everything fits and that the bit is in the right position. There should be two wrinkles on either side of her mouth. If there are too few wrinkles, you need to shorten the cheek straps. If you
“Yeah, he’s an amazing guy. He’s helped me since the first day we met. You sure raised him right, Sarah.”
“That’s great, Bucky!” Steve said. “I’ll make whatever you want for dinner to celebrate, and to welcome you to your new home. But, for right now, we should go see Tony. We’ll see you later, Bruce.”
“Because they’re all boring and ditzy! If and when I get married, I want it to be to someone that I actually love. Someone that treats me like an equal! Somebody who can see passed the crown and money, and just see me!”
“We don’t understand that reference, Stark.” The captain rolled his eyes. “Bucky, this is Doctor Bruce Banner.” The man standing next to Tony waved awkwardly. Bucky didn’t respond, but he turned around to face his best friend, then buried his face in the blond’s neck, who put his arm around him. “Um...Bucky? What…?”
might not mind, but I do!” Tony looked at the bed, deep in thought. “No, we’ll just… We’ll share the bed.”
“I need to learn how to do this by myself, darling,” Tony said stubbornly, taking a second to realise what he said. Looking at the other man’s face, he saw that the riding instructor’s cheeks had a light pink coloring. The prince smirked.
“I can ride her with you, if you’re scared,” Steve offered a few minutes later, while helping the prince onto Friday’s back. The brunet had borrowed some of his instructor’s clothing again to blend in with the commoners.
Steve held his hand from under the table, stroking the back of it with his thumb in a vain attempt of calming him down. The blond noticed the prince had some difficulty breathing, so he did his best to help him breathe properly again, trying to stop a possible panic attack.
“I thought there would be a second bed. I can’t take your bed, Steve!” He started to go back downstairs to ask Sarah if she would mind if he slept in their barn.
“I wanted to stay longer, but Tony has work to do, Ma. We will be back as soon as we can,” he said, and kissed her forehead.
“Yeah. So what?” The soldier already knew that they had it for dinner, but couldn’t understand why that meant they couldn’t have the same thing for breakfast. And lunch. And dinner that night. And also tomorrow’s breakfast.
“Um…” Tony hesitated. “Actually...could I come with you? Maybe help you with whatever chores you have? Please?”
“Are you sick, kiddo? When was the last time you went to a doctor?” He pressed his hand against the child’s forehead, and winked at the boy. “You have a fever.” He turned back around. “He has Coopedupitis! We have to get him to a doctor
, Bucky!” He grabbed the feline’s arm and half-dragged, half-carried him to the car. Unfortunately, in his rush to leave, he forgot about his umbrella, so by the time they got to the car, they were both soaking wet, so now Steve had to worry about Bucky getting sick on top of everything else.
“Well, you have to marry someone! You’ve rejected all the other princesses that your mother and I have brought before you.”
’ “Great! While you’re doing that, I’m going to groom them. Shout if you need me, ok?” The prince nodded again and got to work.
Tony stood, said goodbye to his mother, and left. Once outside, he saw someone on horseback, but didn’t pay them much attention, other than to note that the rider seemed very experienced. When he reached the stables, the young royal leaned against the left side of the frame, with his back to the yard, and pulled out a cigarette and the lighter. After a few minutes, he heard a voice behind him.
Bucky stepped out from under the umbrella and walked a few yards away from his friend, his eyes never leaving a nearby tree where a small group of pigeons were sitting and chirping to each other. One bird turned its head, looked directly at the hybrid, and let out a short series of chirps. In response, he made a noise that, to Steve, sounded like a cat
“Ok, kiddo. We need to look for a jet, an airplane. Do you know what an airplane looks like?” JR nodded.
, and another agent said that he’s, quote, ‘just some freak that we rescued when we were taking down A.I.M.’! It was awful. I’m not sure how much longer the Avengers can work with S.H.I.E.L.D. with Ross as the Director. He fired all of the good agents, or they disappeared, except for Natasha and Clint, and brought in these people that I’m pretty sure either worked or
“Tony said that we should go to Clint’s house. S.H.I.E.L.D doesn’t know about that. We won’t stay long. Just a day or two to come up with a plan,” Steve said from behind Tony, scaring all three men.
’ he thought. He grabbed the thick and heavy book off the shelf and settled down into an armchair to read.
And we would like to thank csocscsirke on Tumblr (csocscsirke.tumblr.com) for allowing us to use her own sock-head cat, Szuszek, as inspiration for JR.
“Got it!” The man stood up and tapped on the center of his chest. Nano robots formed an Iron Man suit around him, with the addition of a little sling for the child. As soon as the robots were finished, the genius bent down, grabbed the kid, and took off for the sky, leaving a giant hole in the roof of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s headquarters, just as the guards started to fire their weapons.
“He prefers Bucky,” Steve told her. “His birthdate is March tenth, nineteen-seventeen. He’s five-nine, and he weighs two hundred and sixty pounds.”
“No, I’m ok. Just a little sore, but ok,” Tony said, straightening his shirt. “Although it’s quite nice having your arms around me.”
“Fine. Tell Brucie I’ll give him three minutes. This is more important.” He turned to the hybrid, who was crouched down into a fetal position in the far left corner if the room, with his back against the wall. Tony stepped over to him and bent down so they were eye-level. “Bucky? What’s wrong?”
“Ты безумен. Пожалуйста, не сердись на меня. Мне жаль. Что бы я ни сделал, чтобы рассердить тебя, мне очень жаль! Пожалуйста, не обижай меня!” The super-soldier shrunk back in fear.
“Did I…? F.R.I.D.A.Y., play the security footage from the last few hours. I think I might be sleep-working again.” A screen popped up in front of him and he watched the last few hours in silence.
“Thank you, Cilly. I’ll take it from here,” he said. She nodded and left the room, closing the door behind her.
“Peter has school, which means no one would be home during the day to help if Hydra shows up. Yes, Tony. I know you have to work, but it would be much easier for Bucky to go with you than it would for him to go with Peter.” He looked at Bucky. “
After several hours, the prince looked up from his book and saw the sun starting to raise behind a faraway mountain. ‘
died in World War II, standing in front of him with a tail and ears that perfectly matched his dark brown hair, and blue eyes with diamond-shaped pupils. He felt like he couldn’t breathe. He took a few more steps back, shakily. His chest was hurting, so he tried to suck in some oxygen, but he was just gasping instead of breathing properly.
Bruce came back in the room, looking tired but calm. “I called my neurosurgeon friend. He was busy with another situation, but he’ll call us back. Since the arm Bucky has now was surgically attached to him…” He paused to take a calming breath. “...we’ll have to operate
