“Old news, Captain? Maybe,” Everhart acknowledged, pointedly ignoring Tony.  “But this isn’t,” she added, holding up one of the pages, her perfect nails clasping at the bottom where Tony’s signature scrawled like a scarlet letter, announcing his sins.   “This is your signature, isn’t it, Mr. Stark? Electronically signed, but look! It even has a thumbprint requirement. That should be helpful in court.”
Tony, it turned out, liked eighties rock, mostly what Steve considered the “loud screaming” variety, not that he was going to criticize much since he favored the more-cliche musicals. To his surprise, Tony didn’t mock his love of Rogers and Hammerstein, but instead mentioned how much his mother always loved hearing him play that music back when piano lessons were apparently mandatory.  Steve found his gaze drifting again to Tony’s hands and thinking that he had really nice, long, dextrous fingers, good for playing piano, and then his mind went to other places and he nearly choked on his bite of salad and had to cover it by downing half his glass of water.
“Not a trick question,” Tony said, meaning to be glib, but it just sort of came out like an apology, though for what, he had no idea.
Her expression cracked, just for a moment, and Tony could see the sadness there, in the lines on her face.  The regret.  It wasn’t enough, but it was there.
Steve thought harshly.
“Huh.  That’s…that’s really cool.  Wow.  Guess it’s smart. The whole, ah, rating thing.  Five stars good, I hope?” Steve asked.
Tony hummed contentedly, and blinked up at Steve.  “I am...very, very good,” he slurred, then let Steve gently lower him to the bed and curl around him. He took Steve’s wrist and brought the inside to his mouth.  Steve felt twin needles enter his skin, and then a low, pleasant pull that reached a line of heat down low in his belly, all the way to the end of his cock.  Tony drank for a while, then pushed Steve’s wrist away and sighed, curling closer into Steve.
“This is my resting face,” Tony protested, drawing a laugh from Steve.
, Tony texted.
“He would love me and want to—to be with me.  We’d be, like, together.  A real couple, do couple things, and…” Tony cut off, blinked through lashes that were stuck together and wiped a hand over his face.  “I’d go to MIT, and it would be great, and he would…I don’t know, come—come visit or—there’s a SHIELD office in DC and one in New York, I think, so he could, I guess.  I mean, he’s from Brooklyn, so.  It’s not that far to Boston from there.  We could, maybe—people do that.  Commute or whatever.”
“A mark,” Tony clarified, as if it needed it. “I don’t have one.”
“I like how you say my name,” Tony said.  “Two.” Steve’s eyes darted over to the desk.  “You think you can stop me before I get to the alarm, don’t you?”
Tony came with a loud cry, seed spilling somewhat weakly into Steve’s hand.  It wasn’t much, but it felt wonderful, this release while he was still so full with Steve’s knot.  Steve was murmuring words into Tony’s ear. Good words, Tony could tell, though he was floating too high to hear them.  Finally, he felt the knot release and start to gradually go down.  It always felt like a loss when Steve pulled out of him, but times like this, he was so loose and gaping, his hole unable to close, the emptiness was almost overwhelming.  He whined a little and reached for Steve, drawing his mouth down for a kiss.
He wasn’t sure how long it took exactly for a nervous sort of twitchiness to settle over him, being this far from Steve, like some kind of current of energy was running back and forth beneath his skin, his heartbeat throbbing with a mantra that something could happen. He focused on flying the jet, checking the various readouts, running a few diagnostics to distract himself until he just couldn’t take it anymore. He cleared his throat loudly. “Nice view from up here. By me. Where the view is. Right here,” Tony pointed out.
“What!?!” Steve shouted, sitting up.  “You…you’re…” “It’s fine, it’s fine, really. Think of it as a very fancy battery,” Tony explained.
It had been his design, but it didn’t matter.  None of this small-talk, kumbaya, we’re all adults here, let’s be bygones, bullshit mattered.  He needed to get out of here and away from Steve before Rhodey’s words from earlier became prophetic.  It was too easy, slipping back into this groove with Steve.  He was skating way too close to some edge that if he fell over, he'd probably never manage to crawl out again.  It had been hard enough the first time.  Rhodey was right.  He couldn't do this again.
“You gotta go. You have class?” Tony sputtered frantically. This wasn't happening. Jesus fucking Christ on a cracker. Steve was going to walk out that door and call this some kind of goodbye, when they were supposed to be starting. “Steve, history isn't changing. Skip the fucking class. Come to the—you know what, forget it, I'll stay here. We'll order a pizza. You just—you think about this. You just need time to think. I had time, before I came over here. I sprung this on you, and you just...you need some time. Time. To think. You'll see. I'm right. You just—you take some time. That's fine. I'm fine with that. Fine,” Tony offered, holding his hands up in a placating gesture.
“You were his only kid, Tony. He was worried. Just seemed like the right thing to do. I should've told you, I know, but you didn't want me to talk to him, and he said you'd just be upset about it, on account of you two having a falling out, so I didn't say anything,” Steve replied. “I'm sorry about that. You had the right to know. I guess that's why Matt stuck it in with the other papers, after I showed it to him. But, come on, don't be mad at your Dad over the money. He offered, but I took it. You want to be mad at me for it, fine.”
“My mom picked the suit,” Tony said, remembering.  He’d hated that suit.  Made him look like a tiny Colonel Sanders peddling his chicken recipe.
“Of course, Your Majesty,” the man said with a bow. “I await your instruction.”
“Isn’t it too late for the museum?” Steve replied with a slight frown, glancing up at the darkening sky.
“Steve. It’s—St--I’m Steve,” Steve replied.  Wait. Was he? No, he was Roger. Roger Grant.  Damn it. Tony had him all twisted in knots. At least that feeling was familiar, Steve supposed with a frustrated sigh.
“You, too, Mr. Jarvis,” Steve said, walking up to offer his hand once again to Jarvis, who clasped it in a firm shake.  “I hope you’ll make this more of a habit.”
The Stranger was sleeping now, but he stirred as Anto approached the mouth of the cave, sitting up until he was leaning back against the stone wall. He had one of the furs wrapped around his shoulders, and an amulet of some kind hung from his neck. Anto had noticed it before, but he had been busy trying to save the man’s life, and hadn’t paid it much mind, but now, he saw that it was flat and round, with two circles carved into it, one inside the other, and thick, blunted points sticking out from the larger circle.  It looked like nothing he had ever seen before, but he couldn’t stop staring at it when the Stranger wasn’t paying attention. He wanted to ask the man what it meant, since he had never seen anything like it, and the man had clutched at it while Anto cleaned his wound, before the pain got too much.
“You’re all terrible people and are clearly going to hell,” Tony observed mildly.
“Not that long, actually,” Tony piped up helpfully, making Steve’s smile widen.
“So you would deprive
Tony’s thrusts slowed, then shallowed. He threw his head back and came with a shout, sweat dripping off his skin as he chased the last of it with a few final thrusts, then collapsed in a heap on top of Steve’s chest, breathing hard. He pulled out of Steve with a groan and managed to get the condom off, tied, and tossed in the general direction of a wastebasket before burying his face against Steve’s chest again.
This wasn’t about him, Steve realized.  This was about the King and whatever it was between Hammer and the King.  Some kind of rivalry or enmity between them that Steve was swept up in for no reason other than the King’s notice, and because Hammer could do this to Steve, when he couldn’t do anything to the King other than hurl insults the King would never hear.
As the months of the campaign stretched on, there had been little and less new to share from Steve’s end of things, or, more accurately, spare few parts of this that he wanted to share with Tony, and he knew his own replies had thinned considerably.   What was there to say? These are the people I’ve killed today, and I don’t know how many more until it will be enough. Enough for what, exactly, he wasn’t sure. Bucky called it hate. Revenge. It was certainly that, he could admit, but when he let himself think about it, Steve thought it might be something else, too. Something far more difficult to shirk or spend, no matter how many rings he collected from dead men.
Tony paused his ministrations and broke his mouth from Steve’s nipple and his fingers slid out of Steve’s body, leaving him feeling wide open and empty at the loss.  A thunderous expression that flickered across Tony’s face before he drew in a breath and seemed to regroup.
It would be one thing if he could blame this on anything beyond his lack of impulse control. Fuck you Jeff Bezos and your free prime shipping. He was going to write a very strongly worded review if he was ever allowed to touch a computer again. One star, you asshole with your disturbingly accurate recommendations for Tony.
When he peeked out the garage door, Steve was nowhere in sight.  The deck was empty, save for Tony’s telescope and an easel that was folded up and leaning against one of the rails.  Great.  Steve was doing his angst-painting.  That always boded well.

“Is there not some other option?  A school with children closer to his age, perhaps, or, I don’t know, tutors?” Peggy suggested.  “If he truly hates this place that much…”
Steve shook his head.  “For the children,” he said, nodding at the lean faces and wide eyes who watched him pass by with such solemnity and awe.
“That’s…that’s not—I want you to be happy,” Steve replied. “I just think—”
“If you met them, you’d know that embellishment is not required,” Steve huffed out over a low, deprecating chuckle.
“Ungh,” Steve managed.  “Tony,” he gasped, drawing out the word into a long, low moan.
Arousal sparked in Steve’s belly, like a dam breaking and a great river of need and desire flowing deep, pushing its way past everything else and rushing, rushing over his skin, his mind, pooling at the base of his cock.  Fluid leaked out, dripping from the tip of the cage and down onto the rug.  It should embarrass him, how messy he was, but Steve couldn’t bring himself to care. There was only Tony. The feel of him, the taste of him, the scrape of his beard against Steve’s skin, the cut of his teeth on Steve’s lips, pain and pleasure and Tony.
He was probably projecting. And being swayed by the sheer outrageousness of a private helicopter trip to the Grand Canyon and the rest of it. He was probably being unfair to Brock.  No probably about it, really.  But...he glanced surreptitiously over at Tony, only to find the other man’s half-hooded eyes watching him with an unsettling intensity that made Steve’s throat go dry as he quickly turned away.
“I flew,” Tony rasped through a mouth that tasted like sand and blood.  He squinted up against the glare of the sun haloing Steve’s face where he knelt in front of him.  Hands, warm and soft and familiar, cradled the sides of his head, while deft fingers gingerly poked and prodded.  Tony slumped forward and let his head rest against Steve’s chest, breathing in a long, shuddering breath that was half-sob, one hand winding into the bulk of Steve’s uniform, just below the star.
“I—yeah.  I know.  I just thought, maybe, I don’t know—“ Steve mumbled, feeling his face flame even though she couldn’t see him.
“I didn’t buy you,” Steve reminded him. “You were a gift.”
“I wouldn’t have talked to you.  Or, worse, I would have, and said a few choice things that didn’t need to be said.  That I didn’t mean,” Tony admitted.  “Plus, not like you didn’t have your reason for staying, what? 500 feet away?  God, I didn’t think even Howard could be that big of a bastard, but there you go, Pops.  Always exceeding my expectations.”
“I couldn’t get the bottle open.  Then the lid came off, and I dropped it.  Some of them went down the drain,” Steve said dully.
“I can't, Tony. I can't wait around for you to figure out that you had it right all those years ago. We're from totally different worlds. We got nothing in common. What are we going to say to each other to make up for that?” Steve questioned softly. “You're you, and I'm...I'm not what you need. You—right now, you feel guilty or, I don't know, maybe you want to get back at your Dad or prove something, but...you're going to think this through and, eventually, you're going to see it. I just can't stick around while you do. I can't do that again. Please don't ask it of me. Please, Tony. I can't.”
“Generals. Pentagoners. Politicians.
“Wow,” Steve said, looking up and down the private beach.  The beach was a dark golden color against the dark reddish-brown of the rocks that jutted out like long arms.  The beach itself curved in, forming a c-shape and blocking the worst of the Pacific’s waves.  It occurred to him that this was probably not natural, that Tony had created this, bent rock and water and earth to his will, and there was something heady in that, being next to someone who would dare like that.
“Why would they think I’m a threat?” Steve asked.  “I’m fighting for my country, same as before.”
Tony groaned as he slid into bed and rolled over to wrap his arm around Steve’s stomach.  Steve obligingly lifted his arm to allow Tony to press himself against Steve’s chest, as was his wont.  His breath warmed Steve’s skin, and Steve felt him heave a sigh, pressing his forehead against the curve of Steve’s ribs.
Absently, he heard Happy hop into the driver’s seat and start the engine, and soon they were headed on the now-familiar route to Tony’s.
“Not gonna lie, your Alpha carries a lot of pull, whoever he is,” Jim said, shaking his head a bit as his eyebrows raised in silent question.  “But, you know, I think it’s pretty cool, I guess.  You being here and all.  Kind of history, you know? Not that long ago, it was people who looked like me making some history.  I guess I’m thinking maybe I pay it forward a bit.”
A low, whirring noise, almost a vibration, pierced the air, and suddenly, something large, round and silver slammed into the side of Obie’s head with a metallic thrum.
“I know,” Steve said softly, then rolled over onto his side, facing the door. “I wish it was easier, too.”
“Tony’s particularly interested in the research you’re doing with LIGO on your gravitational waves project,” Steve, the attention-paying-bastard, put in helpfully.
Tony had woken him this morning some time after the sun was already up, Steve remembered, letting the thought warm him.  Steve had still been in some kind of heady daze from the night, but had come to wakefulness with the feeling of Tony’s beard scraping across his neck and jaw as he kissed Steve awake, the soft, warm look in Tony’s eyes, the murmur of his voice caressing Steve’s skin, the way his hands coaxed Steve awake with soft, lingering touches.
“Hey, now.  Ursa Major was not creepy,” Tony objected. “She had a bow.  With…little x’s and o’s on it.”
“Two of your hamburgers for Jane, if you please!  And she will have some of your apology snacks, as well, Sam Wilson,” Thor called out from the hallway.  “She is a woman of great appetites,” Thor finished with a shrug and pleased nod while Jane smiled proudly.
“Tony?” Steve said.
“I was going to cry.  Manly tears, but I felt it building,” Rhodey said.  “In here,” he added, tapping at his chest.
The KISS Monster Mini-Golf is totally a real thing.  You can Google it.  It is awesome.
The elevator doors slid open to the landing leading to his workshop.  There was a low light coming from inside.  Through the glass, Tony could see Steve sitting on a swivel stool, with Dum-E and U paying rapt attention to whatever it was Steve was doing.  Tony pressed closer to the glass, trying to see.
“Ah, the sweet smell of mutual service branch respect.  Good day at work?” Tony asked as they made their way towards the back of the bus.
.  Fuck.  He wanted that, exactly that, more than he thought he’d wanted just about anything.
He climbed into the car behind Happy with a terse, “You could’ve said something,” which only caused Happy to laugh harder.
, I don’t know. Hell, maybe that’s impossible.  Maybe it’s just my fucking ego talking to think someone like me, with all my mistakes, could manage that. That my life could amount to something good.  I don’t know. Seems impossible sometimes. But, I have to try.” He spread his arms wide, splaying his hands, then let them drop to his sides in defeat. “I have to try.”
“Steve!” Pepper shouted, nearly bumping into Tony as she practically flung herself into the room. “Oh, I mean Mr. Rogers. Or can I call you Steve now? I don’t know, this is all so sudden,” she ground out through clenched teeth, throwing a pointed look at Tony.
“We are doing neither of those, because we are not nineteen, but rather, mature men, who are over that kind of---you know, a high-five would not be out of order,” Tony responded with a wide smile.  Rhodey raised his palm in the air, and Tony slapped it, feeling stupid and giddy and happy all at the same time.  “He quit his job.  We’re dating.  We had dinner last night…this great dinner—thanks, Pep—and we talked about, God, I don’t know. Everything.  Us.  Our relationship.  What we wanted.  Sex.  I think Steve needs some sex.  Like, a lot of sex, probably.  But, slow, no pressure, you know?   I need to research.  I don’t want to—to have it happen too fast or make it a big thing, but then this morning, we were joking, and maybe it isn’t a big thing, and I’m making it a big thing.  Am I making it a big thing?  Shit.  I haven’t been this nervous since, well.  Since the first time, I guess.  Though, that was mostly just because I understood basic principles of volume and capacity.”
“Tony, did I do something wrong, or say something, because you seem—“ Steve tried, a frown tugging at the corners of his mouth.
“Would you like to sit down?” Steve asked.  He should’ve already asked that, he realized, swallowing hard.
Tony nodded. “He does, indeed,” Tony replied with a frown, knotting his hands together as they walked.
“Charles was nice,” Tony said, when he couldn’t take the silence and couldn’t think of anything else to say. “He and David seemed really sweet.  Kind of cool that he actually saw Captain America.  Not that he had to go to war, of course, but still.  Interesting, what he said about him.  I guess the real guy, he was probably a lot different than the comics and radio show, all that.  They probably sanitized it a lot.  Rescuing dames and punching Hitler,” Tony said with a low laugh.  “Guess it wasn’t really like that.  Hard to sell stepping over body parts, I suppose.”
“Tell him to let me go, then,” Tony said with a frown.
Tony followed Captain Rogers out of the conference room, where Agent Coulson waited in the hallway outside the door, arms crossed over his chest like a pencil-pushing sentinel who would definitely send you a strongly-worded memo if you didn’t replace the toner cartridge.
“Nerds,” Barnes coughed into his hand.  “Look, you don’t need to spend a bunch of money or anything, but you need to do something, I don’t know, something to kind of nudge Steve along, you know?  Make a move.  Do your thing.  Go big or go home. Be bold.”
Dark eyes that had watched Steve as he undressed, flickered up and down Steve’s body where he lay splayed on the bed.  “I’ve dreamed of this,” Tony murmured as he crawled onto the bed, stalking his way up to take Steve’s mouth again.  “Just look at you,” he husked out, smiling softly down at Steve as he pulled away.  Tony reached up and brushed the hair from Steve’s forehead, his touch surprisingly gentle.  “I’ve wanted this for so long. So very long.”
That particular day ended with all three of them building the sand into a miniature of the castle and city, complete with a driftwood drawbridge, much to Cam’s astonished delight, Steve recalled with a fond smile.  He had been distraught at the idea of leaving their work to the sea to reclaim, so Tony commissioned a model of the whole castle complex, complete with knights and horses, nobles, and all manner of commoners engaged in various tasks.  Cam adored it, of course. He spent hours at the model, having vivid imaginary battles with the tiny working catapults and trebuchets and glorious celebratory feasts in their wake.
Steve’s body jerked in surprise and something that wasn’t surprise bloomed bright and hot inside his chest.  He let out a ragged breath and reached down to open the jar.  A thick greasy substance was inside, though it was almost soft when Steve’s fingers touched it.  He looked back up at the King, and found him still writing, apparently uninterested in watching what Steve was doing.  Which was good, Steve told himself, though a searing heat twisted through his stomach that he recognized as shame.  He’d done this before, of course.  Even done it with others around.  Soldiers found what solace they could in the field.  Quiet, furtive moments when he could, with his hand over his mouth so no one would hear.   Never like this, though.  Never with someone who could see him, but was choosing not to, and somehow, that was both better and far worse.
It occurred to Steve as he sat stiffly in the back of his second limo ride with a stranger of the night that one way to exert some degree of control over the situation may have been to simply tell Mr. Hammer not to touch him without asking first or at least giving him a second to adjust.  Not like the expectation had been exactly unreasonable, considering the circumstances.   After all, Hammer had at least been vetted by the agency.   What had Ms. Romanov said about him?  He was a little odd, but nothing too weird according to past…dates.  That had sounded fine at the time.  So ‘a little odd’ translated to ‘gropes you in the car’?  That had been…okay, well, that had been a little unexpected and uncomfortable, but hardly a reason to run off with a stranger in what he was pretty sure was a clear violation of some agency policy that was likely going to end up with him not getting paid.  Speaking of which, though the guy had offered him more for the night, he actually had no idea how that was supposed to work.  The agency handled the money.  Was he supposed to take a check?  Ask to see ID?  Good Lord.  He might as well just tuck and roll out the door when the limo slowed.  What the hell had he been thinking?  The answer, of course, was that thinking had left the building around the time he’d gotten out of the cab at Hammer’s house, met the man at the door and the realization that they would be having sex in a few hours had settled somewhere low in his stomach and crawled around his insides the rest of the night.
“Brock,” Steve corrected around a shocked laugh, then squirmed a bit as Stark’s words sank in. “He’s not unemployed, not really, he’s just...wait...how did you...did you multitask him, too?”
“We should come back to the Mansion one of these days,” Tony said idly as they walked.  “High limit room, private pool, VIP entrance, courtesy Rolls, you’d like it.”
“I’ll bet I could seriously retrofit that loader, though.  Add some weaponry.  I mean, all its got is a glorified Yankee Candle, but you throw some missiles on that exoskeleton, and you’d have something,” Tony said in a considering tone.
He let go of the door, put his bag down on the sofa and walked over to the kitchen sink. There was a vase of flowers next to the sink, dark pink blooms with delicate, spotted petals reaching out.  Stargazer lilies.  There were always stargazer lilies, everywhere they went.  Tony sucked in a breath, catching the familiar sweet, floral scent.
“I mean, not that I don’t find your faith in humanity adorable, don’t get me wrong,” Barnes said, walking towards the kitchen and picking up a bagel, which he took a large bite of, before pointing it at Steve for emphasis.  “But, Ross isn’t going to pull his foot off the VA guy’s neck,” he mumbled around the piece of bagel he was chewing.  “No way they’re saying yes at this point.”
“You sure?  Well, if you insist,” Stone said.  He walked forward, and Tony heard the flick of a lighter, then the first waft of smoke drifted past him.  It smelled like leather and spice, not the typical cigarette smell, but one that was hand-rolled somewhere and meant for brandy and tables of cards.  “Nice view.”
Steve raised his eyes up, finding Tony looking down at him with an expression of pure, unfiltered bliss. Tony’s other hand stroked Steve’s aching jaw and he smiled, wide and dark and full of pleasure. Tony’s hips canted back, spilling his cock almost all the way from Steve’s mouth and giving Steve a moment to catch his breath before Tony thrust back in again. The motion rocked Steve backwards and he squeezed his eyes shut. Bright, searing pain blazed from his nipples and then his ass as he strained forward trying to find that perfect space between the two points of agony that he was becoming certain didn’t actually exist.
“Hey, your guy thought Tony was just looking to slum it for a bit,” Rhodey countered.  “Tony.  Who loves Steve more than Kanye loves Kanye.”
“Tony,” Steve started, then stopped. He didn’t know what to say.
“I’m sorry,” Steve said after a long beat of silence. “I just---I was in your room, and I—I needed to get out.  I don’t know. I just had to—to not be there anymore. Leaving…the castle, the city,” Steve trailed off.
He owed it to Tony.  That was what it came down to.  He couldn’t trade on Tony’s happiness, and that was what he had been doing.  Tony was gone. The universe was in ruins.
“Where are we going?” Cam asked excitedly.
Tony’s phone buzzed in his pocket.  He pulled it out and looked at the screen, where the photo of a canister of salt appeared.
“I--thank you, but, ah,” Steve began.  You don’t eat their food, Steve thought, hearing his mother’s voice echo in his head.  You never eat their food.  The impulse to cross himself was almost overwhelming, though Steve resisted such rudeness.  Still.  You don’t eat their food. “I’m not hungry.”
He thought about Steve’s face when he promised to help him find Barnes, the absolute certainty that Tony could do, would do it, because he said so, the unwavering faith he hadn’t had in…well.  A long time.  That’s how it starts, he thought.  He fell in love with how Steve made him feel about himself almost before he fell in love with Steve.  Maybe that’s what love is, when you got right down to it.  Steve didn’t lie, which meant he could be the person Steve saw when he looked at him like that, and he wanted that more than he would have thought possible.
Oh, God, I’m going to hell.
“Yeah, but,” Tony threw his hands up in the air in frustration.  “You see how this is circular, right?” Tony grumbled.
Steve sighed and held his hands up in a placating gesture.  “Give me the damn bread,” he grumbled, knowing when he was beaten.  Cam, much like Steve’s own mother, and probably just about anyone who had gone hungry too many times to count, held tight to the certainty that food could fix most of what ailed anyone.
“Oh, he was worried, alright. Worried I'd up and decide that I could have some kind of life that wasn't the one he had in mind. The one where I march right along to his drum. Yeah, you bet he was worried,” Tony ground out. He could hear the tinge of bitterness on the edges of his words. Steve could, too, apparently, his face pulling into a scowl.
He stopped at the workshop’s threshold and watched Tony pull the fire-bright metal out of the forge, pick up a flat-faced mallet and hammer it until sparks flew.  When he was satisfied, he dropped it into a bucket of cool water, sending a cloud of steam into the air.  Something stirred in Steve’s chest, reaching, trying to claw its way out.  He hadn’t quite realized until this moment just how much he had missed Tony.  The deep aching wound inside, that part of him that he kept trying to weave together with hands covered in blood, it was less in here, somehow.  Easier. Lighter.  A few moments ago, he would have sworn it was because in here, he didn’t have to think, didn’t have to be himself, could let go, but it didn’t feel like letting go, seeing Tony there.  It didn’t feel like less of himself.  He hadn’t felt this alive since he watched Bucky fall.  Maybe before that.  He couldn’t remember, not for certain, except that each breath in here wasn’t a burden, and that was saying something.
Ms. Romanov’s admonition flashed through Steve’s mind at Tony’s words. They don’t want to know, not really.  Don’t confuse polite interest with the client actually wanting to hear about the problems or dreams they’re exploiting.
The man looked up at Tony, who carefully held his hand in front of his chest and rubbed his thumb over his forefinger in what he hoped was the universal symbol for ‘Play Along And I Will Pay You Cash Money.’
“Sounds good,” Tony mumbled. There was one other email in his inbox, this one from an unknown sender with a large document attached. “J, scan this other email for me, would you?”
“Rhodey,” Tony said, spinning around to face his friend.  “We have to make this happen. Him. Me. A chance encounter courtesy of a formerly crap pair of binoculars and your Nintendo Switch--”
But...Steve hadn't come to bang on the garage door, and he hadn't freaked out about all the purchases and he said he wanted Tony to be happy, like that was an actual thing.
“Oh, no, it’s fine.  I mean, sure.  Go right ahead.  Here, I can…I can get it positioned for you.  If you want,” Tony offered.  “Polaris is bright tonight,” he continued, walking over to the telescope and turned on the motor.
“A…tutor?” Steve questioned, frowning down at Tony with a confused look.
“Good,” Tony repeated, nodding his head once, then pinching his hand over his bottom lip.  Good?  Good.  Seriously.  That’s what he was going with?  Good?  Good that he’d just told Steve to feel free to fuck someone else, so long as he didn’t bring him or her home?
“I can’t promise that no slave will ever be put in your position again. Not even I am that powerful. But if it should be so, they will not come from my house,” Tony told him.
That much was true, Steve thought with a grimace. Even Steve, in his state, had noticed the tenor of the crowds.  He wasn’t sure what to make of the fascination, but he couldn’t deny it.  Throngs of people had come to see them off, which probably wasn’t all that unusual, given that the King was leaving the city for a trip that would take several months, but Steve had been surprised by the level of interest there was in him.  He wasn’t sure what it meant for Tony.  For what would come. He let his eyes fall closed and bit the inside of his cheek as the carriage bounced slightly and his whole body lit up in pain and something so close to pleasure, he couldn’t name it with any certainty. He couldn’t think about Tony now. He couldn’t think about anything.  He seemed only capable of feeling, and even that was threateningly close to overwhelming.  He opened his eyes and sucked in a sharp breath, tried to swallow and ended up having to stifle a groan as the carriage trundled around a bend in the road.
“Ah…what did I wear?  A suit?  Blue,” Tony told her.
“Just so I’m clear, you called us all here this morning because you kissed your husband,” Matt asked.
Yeah, it wasn’t going to work.  He knew that. This, really, though...maybe it had always been a one way trip.  He thought maybe he had known that. One last hurrah before the end. One last chance to--to do something.  Really
“That has been mentioned at some point by pretty much everyone I’ve ever known,” Steve admitted, mouth flattening around a chagrined sigh as Natasha’s voice seemed to ring in his ears.  A surprised bark of laughter answered for the King, who looked delighted when Steve raised his eyes from where his hands curled into fists in his lap to notice. “Sorry, I—“
“Tony,” Steve began in what he hoped was a conciliatory tone, then broke off, at a loss.  What could he say that didn’t make this whole thing worse?
“Jus Primae Noctis.  Right of the first night.  Old, stupid law written by old, stupid men, but…still technically there and perfectly usable by young, stupid men,” Tony said, canting his head to one side to twist around and look at Steve.  “The Lord, or, in this case, since you married a Lord, me, has the right of the first night.”
“I see it,” Tony repeated. “And it makes me want to tear those pages out and burn them. I want the part that destroys those training dummies down in the yard no matter how fast I have them made. All of you, Steve. I will love all of you, no matter what it is, I swear it. I
“Ha,” Barnes snorted, taking a drink from a bottle of…Tony tilted his head, squinting…Dom Perignon.  Of course, Tony sighed. “He’s got your number, Stevie,” Barnes said, tipping the bottle in Steve’s direction.  “You did good, Stark,” Barnes added, nodding approvingly at him.
The screen went black again, not unexpectedly, obviously, but still jarring Steve with the loss.  He wanted more.  So much more.  He wanted to see someone, Jarvis or Peggy or Ana or his mother or
“Beautiful,” Tony said, arranging the chain of pearls so that it hung from the end of the metal cock and dangled down between Steve’s cheeks.  Steve could feel each one of them, cool and strangely soft against the sensitive skin.  He could see the image in his mind, small ivory pearls dripping from the golden cock that filled him.  Tony made this, Steve thought, the idea spreading like a fog through his head.  Tony made this for him.  Wanted to see him like this.  It was a wondrously powerful thought.  Tony wanted this, and Steve had given it to him.
The first jazzy strains of the orchestra started almost immediately.  Steve remembered practicing dancing to it while his mother was away on the old turntable that had been his grandfather’s.  Not this kind of dancing, of course. More stuttering steps across the floor of their cramped walk-up in the blistering summer heat with sweat pouring down his back while he tried to learn a few basic steps in the hopes that maybe someone would take pity on him at the eighth grade dance.  They hadn’t, but he hadn’t forgotten what it was like that first time he tried to learn, feeling some combination of ridiculous, strangely nervous, determined and desperately hopeful. It…seemed fitting, he could admit.
Shared life experience, Steve thought, closing his eyes for a moment.  It should’ve been something we shared, something we understood about the other, instead of a wedge between us.  But, maybe we’re both just a little too good at it, he wondered, opening his eyes and focusing on the screen again.
Breakfast, which probably should have been awkward, at least in Tony’s morning after experiences, ended up being surprisingly easy, even though Steve traded the towel for the robe that matched Tony’s, which was unfortunate, in Tony’s opinion.  Steve read the paper that had been delivered along with coffee, pastries, fruit and two plates of eggs and bacon, and Tony checked his emails, while the conversation flowed from how bad the Dodgers were this year (“They never should have left Brooklyn”—Steve Rogers, at least three times) to a photo of the two of them accompanying an article on the gala (“I see I’m ‘And Husband’ now” “Pass me the bagels, would you, And?”) to a news report on the Air Force assuring the public that any resemblance the contrails their pilots left in the sky bore to a part of male anatomy was purely coincidental (“It definitely
“When I was a soldier, I saw a slave after he tried to escape,” Tahir said from across the pool as Steve slid his feet into the sandals.  Steve turned and looked at big man, watching the streaks of light from the water’s surface cast eerie stripes in waves across his face.  “They brought him back.  Made us all watch.  So that we would know.  Now, I know. I do not wish to see such a thing again.”
“What?” Tony snapped, eyes going wide as his body spasmed so violently that the wine sloshed over the rim of the goblet and ran down the sides, dripping onto his hands and pants, not that he seemed to notice.  “That’s not possible.”
“He met up with Barnes at the Stark Expo, did you know that?  Just before Barnes shipped out.  Barnes had gotten a couple of girls, dames Steve called them.  He slips, sometimes.  When he’s remembering.  The one that was there for him, she was so disappointed.  You can imagine, right?  Ninety pounds of spit and piss and nothing else to his name.  Wouldn’t give him the time of day, not with Barnes around and Howard Stark up on stage with his flying car,” Natasha continued.
Though, Tony didn’t look old enough to have been here for as long as people reported the lights and noises, but perhaps...perhaps he had been an apprentice.  Yes, that must be it. An apprentice who came to take over someone else’s work.  Wasn’t that something learned men did?  Steve thought he remembered Bucky talking about it once, back before the War, and hadn’t one of the Sewell children gone off to the city to apprentice as a doctor all those years ago? The explanation, even though Steve was sure it wasn’t entirely right, made such sense that Steve immediately relaxed and let himself enjoy the food.
“Good,” Tony said.  The corners of his mouth tugged up into a small smile, and he turned, squinting back at Barnes.  “No bright light. No food after midnight. Don’t get him wet.  You know the drill.”
The world was opening up again, filling in at the corners of his vision with the tight, expectant hush of unused voices and stilled hands.  Barnes was looking at Steve with a tense grimace, clearly displeased, though that could be simply due to the fact that it was a day ending in Y.  Nat’s soft gaze was on Tony, heavy and too clear, and he wanted to run, bolt out of here and into the blessed sweet-stink of the back alley New York night, but that would be some kind of admission he didn’t want to make in front of Steve.
“Theyweren’tstupid,” Tony muttered, then closed his eyes.  He swallowed, or tried to.  There wasn’t any saliva in his mouth.  Why?  Why did he have to do that?   It was like a bell being rung that made his brain sit up and antagonize when he should just walk away. Why couldn’t he just walk away?
“There’s nothing wrong with you,” Steve snapped, head swiveling towards Tony.  His mouth flattened, and he sucked in a steadying breath, his face softening.  “There’s nothing wrong with you, Tony.”
“Bad men,” Steve repeated, this time a bit more urgently.
Steve’s thrusts sped up, shallow then deep, sometimes hitting the place inside just right, sometimes teasing at it, until Tony thought he would explode with need. It built up, this pressure, this warmth, this insistent, pulsing throb that bordered on pain, then Steve would find the spot inside him and everything would be wiped away by a wave of pleasure, only to start again the next time.  Finally, Steve’s thrusts lost their rhythm. His hips juddered and he rolled them, sending a whole new sensation through Tony that made him gasp. He pumped again, then again, bottoming out, Tony’s hole loose and slack around him. He scooped up a handful of slick and wrapped his hand around Tony’s cock, stroking up and down as he thrust again, mimicking the motion, his hand twisting on the head of Tony’s cock just as his angle found that place deep inside Tony one, last time.
He counted.
“That…is not at all what happened,” Steve objected evenly as they made their way up the stairs.
“Not as aerodynamic as one would hope,” Tony said, giving Steve a wide-eyed look that he hoped bordered on innocent.  “Not that we were tossing them across the room or anything.”
Tony reached out and took Steve by the hand, gently guiding him towards the ramp. He stopped to grab his suitcase, figuring that he could get Steve’s later. It probably had boring, useless stuff like clothes, anyway.   “So, here we are,” Tony said, swinging his suitcase in the direction of the sprawling house.
“Thanks!” Tony called out cheerily.  It was nice Steve was so proud of him for thinking fast on his feet.  His Omega really did appreciate his strengths. Steve was just the best, most wonderful, perfect—
“I—I’m not.  Hiding it. Hiding anything.  Why would I be?” Tony stuttered, rushing out the words on a shaky breath.
“Natalie?” Tony said, blinking at her through a haze of surprise where his mind tried to focus on what he was seeing instead of the numb insistence to move that the word Medical carried.
“Um…Hi, Happy.  I know what this looks like, but I just need to talk to him.  I swear I won’t take up much of his time,” Steve tried to explain.
It didn’t matter.  It didn’t matter that Tony wasn’t thinking about him.
“What’s he—what’s he doing?” Rhodey asked, trying to lean forward as far as the bars would let him to crane his neck in an attempt to see the door.
“I don’t,” Kirk said and kissed him again, full and open, mouth slanting over Steve’s, tongue flicking over his lips and delving inside again while Kirk’s hips ground down on Steve’s erection.
His mind flashed to the night Tony had come to his room in the compound, not so long after Steve had arrived. Dressed in his finery and tasting of wine, silently undoing the ties that held Steve’s robe together, then urging him over, onto his belly.  Spreading him apart and working him open while Steve gripped the bed covering and buried his face into the pillow.  He remembered the feel of Tony’s crown, heavy and hard against his shoulder as Tony thrust in.  Steve had cried out then, the only sound in the darkness, and Tony had slowed, pressed a kiss to Steve’s neck, then put two fingers to Steve’s lips until he opened his mouth and sucked them down while Tony pounded into him, hard and fast in that eerie quiet. He remembered how it had felt, forbidden and wrong and so good to just have to take it and not think about it.  Not think about anything except how Tony made him feel.  He looked at his hand where it wrapped around the bedpost and remembered the night Tony had put him in chains.  How he couldn’t move, even if he had wanted to, and how all the other thoughts seemed to be kept at bay as long as he was held there with the pain and pleasure mixing into some kind of magical binding that pushed all of that aside.  How long had it been since he had felt that way?
“Nothing,” Steve insisted.  “Nothing, it’s--”
“I’m sorry, Tony,” Steve said with a sigh and a grimace.
Steve took full advantage of the opportunity and slid his tongue inside Tony’s mouth.  Tony blinked rapidly, then let his eyes flutter closed.  Distantly, Tony felt one of Steve’s hands against the small of his back, holding him in place. The other dropped from his jaw, trailing light touches down his neck and arm, making the hairs stand on end, until it twined into Tony’s, fingers flexing as Steve’s tongue plunged deeper.  Tony could feel heat rise from somewhere low in his belly and work its way up his chest.  He didn’t realize he had one hand on Steve’s thigh until he felt the muscles bunch and jump when he tentatively touched the tip of his tongue to Steve’s.
“You going to get to work, Stark?” Clint asked as he wiped red juice off the floor.  Tony looked at the nearest pile of watermelon debris and raised his gauntlet.  Then lowered it.
“Grinding Nemo,” Steve said suddenly, making Tony stop mid-drink and have to cough down the rest of his swallow of wine.  “Sorry.”
“I need no reward,” Steve protested.  “You’ve already—”
“Looks like,” Steve replied, realizing he couldn’t keep the goofy grin off his face. The only thing he could think of to get rid of it was to pull Tony in for another kiss.  As far as tactics went, Steve felt it was one of his better maneuvers, but he paused for a moment, just now noticing something different in the workshop.  “Hey, is that a new couch?” he wondered, because that had definitely not been down here the last time he’d been in Tony’s workshop.  He wondered briefly at it before deciding he didn’t really care because Tony was kissing him and everything was wonderful.
These are a collection of ficlets and some just responses to asks over on Tumblr that I wanted to save, given that Tumblr is deleting so many blogs and posts.  I have no idea what tomorrow's purge will bring and didn't want to lose these. Nothing is beta-ed and everything is very informal, just some CN-related stuff that I wanted to keep somewhere.
It was bent almost entirely in half.
this.  This bright, beautiful, glorious thing that Steve could give him.
“They put that on flashcards for you?” Tony asked with an abrasive, terrible sounding laugh that didn’t sound like anything was funny.
Tony looked back over at him.  Finally, he smiled softly and reached over to push a strand of hair from where it had fallen onto Steve’s forehead.  “Good.” He leaned over and placed a gentle kiss on the same spot.
“A courtesy?  What you’re offering—“ Steve began, shaking his head.
“You just knew it would work,” the King repeated, sounding oddly satisfied with the stumbling explanation Steve had managed to offer.  The King pushed himself off the table and set the empty cup down, then walked over to stand in front of Steve.  “Zola chose you because you look a bit like Tib—an old friend,” the King said with a twist of his mouth.  Not a friend, then, Steve thought to himself.  “He thinks that would please me.”
“Nguh,” Steve choked out, then forced himself to swallow.  “Flowers,” he said.  He forgot why for a second, while Tony gave him a curious look, then remembered. “I, ah.  I—flowers,” Steve repeated, holding out the page he’d torn from the hotel’s notepad where he’d drawn a small bouquet.  Holding it out now, to Tony Stark of all people, who owned Newmans for crying out loud, the tiny piece of paper with the casino’s logo emblazoned across the top and a blue-penned sketch of flowers below it, what had seemed stupidly romantic a few minutes ago in his room, now seemed just stupid.  “Sorry.  Sorry, that’s—stupid, obviously, sorry, I’m—I’m a bit out of practice with this whole dating thing, you could say, I guess, and, I don’t know, I thought—but, just nevermind, I—”
“Yes, Mr. Stark,” the chef said with a quick nod at the sommelier, who rushed off.  “Right away.  We are so glad to have you with us tonight!  Such a pleasure.  Of course, if there is anything we can do, anything at all…”
He slowly wrapped his arms around Tony, patting him lightly on the back, while Tony blabbered about making pterodactyl wings for Sam, of all things, while Steve tried to assure Tony that Sam really just needed something more maneuverable and Tony could forgo the lasers. “So,” he began, clutching Tony tighter than was probably strictly necessary, but not wanting him to get any ideas that involved moving away.  “Does this mean…?” Steve questioned, completely unable to keep the hope out of his voice this time.
“Okay, well, you’re clearly wrong on basketball--seriously, the Celtics?” Tony demanded, tossing his napkin into his lap.
Steve would need food for the Journey, Anto thought, and began thinking of what he could send.  Tyber wouldn’t let him give Steve much, but surely he could set aside something, if he started now, Anto thought.  The strips of deer meat, maybe, and the salted fish, he thought. He was so engrossed in thinking through the stores they had available that he almost didn’t hear the raised voices until he was nearly on top of them.
“And two more grow in its place.  Yes, I know,” Tony broke in, going quiet for a long time as he let the words hang in the air.  “Our last reports said Shmidt’s forces were defeated and Shmidt himself dead,” Tony prompted after a moment.  “A terrible battle at the mouth of a great river.  Some kind of conflagration.  Something of Shmidt’s devise, I would guess.  His weapons…I’ve only heard tell of them, but, some kind of—of compound that burns even when wet? This--this was what you were fighting?” Tony demanded, voice rising.  He sucked in a breath like he was readying to say more, then abruptly shut his mouth and looked away.
It was the evening of the fourth day, just after Steve checked the last of the seed stores to make sure no vermin found a way in, that Steve ended up at the point where the road diverged.  Wagon grooves in neat, parallel lines pointed off towards town, while a stone-strewn, overgrown path cut between two large boulders that towered above Steve’s head.  That wouldn’t have been so disturbing, except that he had no memory of how he came to be there.
“Okay. Do you want to come sleep in our room?”
“Did you want to help me take these to the kitchen?” Steve asked, piling the empty plates one on top of the other.
“Did you want to show me something?”
“We save the world for a living, how hard can taking in a child be?” Steve agreed. “Plus, it’s not like we don’t know him.”
“I’m sure.”  Steve stopped at the closed door and knocked. The door was answered a few minutes later by Claire, a baby balanced on her hip.
“We made up the guest room for you. If you do end up staying with us permanently, you can decorate the room however you want,” Steve explained as the elevator moved noiselessly between floors.
“That’s right, Pete, good job!” Tony said, putting a hand on his shoulder.
Tony took Pete’s hand and led him out to the elevator.
“What if the A.I. lets Pete into the labs or another dangerous location without asking approval?”
“Hi FRIDAY,” Pete answered, smiling at the ceiling. “I live here now.”
“Within reason,” Steve amended.
“Back to Claire.” The words tore out of Pete’s little throat.
“Of course,” Tony agreed.
Steve and Pete rejoined Tony a little while later, and together they all went to the car. It was a quiet ride home, Christine only waking when they pulled into the tower.
They were met with a chorus of goodnights and sweet dreams as the three of them stepped onto the elevator. Pete let out a big yawn, covering his mouth with his hand. The elevator landed on their floor and the doors silently slid open.
Tony got lost once more in explaining his upgrades to Pete, barely registering Steve coming out of the bedroom and heading into the kitchen after stopping to fondly watch them on the sofa.
“Ready?” Steve asked.
“It’s our pleasure. We’d like to help if we can,” Steve responded.
They had a couple more weekend visits and all seemed to be going well. They were on their way to pick Pete up for one of the last weekend sessions before he would move in with them full time. They would foster Pete until a court day could be set for them to adopt him. They were moving faster than normal, but between Claire and Hank they all thought it would be best to move the process along quickly.
“Don’t like onions in ‘em, but otherwise they’re good,” Pete said distractedly, tongue poking out as he screwed a metal plate onto one of the bots.
“I am,” she said. “Mr. Stark created me as a backup for J.A.R.V.I.S., who is now known as Vision.”
“Successful mission?” Loki asked quietly, closing his book but keeping his page with his index finger.
“Where is you?”
“We’re coming, we’re coming,” Steve chuckled. They reached the door and Steve reached over Pete to knock on the door.
“Wow. I wasn’t doing multiplication until I was five,” Jane said, gently rubbing Thor’s feet.
“That’s wrong, right?” He asked.
“Good,” Steve said, smiling at her before turning and going to Clint. “All good here?”
“Always,” Tony answered. They all piled into the elevator, which took them down to the labs.
“Pete?” he asked as he gently opened the door. Pushing it all the way open, Steve crossed to the bed and knelt down beside it, Tony coming up behind him. “Pete,” Steve called softly. “Pete, wake up. Pete, you’re at Avengers tower with me and Tony. You’re safe. Wake up.” Steve put his hand on the bed beside Pete but hesitated to touch him. Slowly, Pete’s eyes cracked open.
The girl nodded solemnly.
“Sorry,” he said softly, blushing.  “Long day in the lab.”
“Oh,” Pete said, blinking owlishly at the cake.
“Always,” Tony answered, straightening his cuff. They made their way up the front walk, weaving their way through abandoned tricycles and soccer balls. When they reached the door, Steve leaned forward and rang the doorbell. They heard several voices from the other side of the door preceding it opening to reveal a frazzled-looking woman.
Tony looked at Steve and squeezed his hand, a coil of dread unwinding in his stomach.
“I don’t believe that,” Tony said, crossing over to the bed and kneeling down so he could try and get in Pete’s line of sight. “Claire said you had an altercation.”
Pete moved in with them a few weeks later, to everyone’s delight. Tony and Steve were officially Pete’s foster parents and well on their way to becoming his adoptive parents. The court date was set in a few months, giving them time to settle in as a family first.
“I control the security and comfort levels in the Tower primarily, and keep Sir out of trouble.”
“Tony,” Steve interrupted, a warning note clear in his voice.
“M hm,” Pete mumbled, going over and sitting on his bed.
“Well that wouldn’t happen, but in the very unlikely chance that it did I’ve also got back up lockdown procedures set in place any time that power is cut or there is sign of hacking in my systems. Those are the only conceivable ways that my A.I. could fail and even then, the chances are very slim.”
“Sure,” Pete answered again. Steve put a bag in the microwave.
Sorry this took so long, I took a week to go home and visit family.
Steve let Pete and Christine lead the way to the room, where they had painstakingly set up a small cot for Christine to sleep on the one night she would be with them.
“Can I show Christine our room?”
“391! The answer is 391!” he said, beaming at Tony.
They were interrupted when Steve walked through the door, shirt damp with sweat and earbuds in.
Tony and Steve had also bought a nightlight that projected stars onto the ceiling, as well as a bookshelf full of books. Steve had stopped them at that, not wanting to overwhelm Pete with too many new things at once.
“Great, and what kind of chips?”
“I made this for you,” Pete said, sliding a piece of paper towards Steve and Tony shyly. On it was two shakily drawn figures, one with red, white and blue stripes and the other with red and gold blobs decorating it.
“Yup,” Pete looked away shyly.
“Who said those awful things to Pete?”
“I’m sure it’s fine. He probably just got sucked into a math problem or something. He moved onto long division last weekend.” The note of pride in Tony’s voice was hard to miss.
Pete moves into the tower
Sorry it's been forever. Life, what can I tell you?
“Please?”
“Heartrate 120, temperature 100 Farenheit, breath faster than resting. Suggested course of action: intervention.”
“I thought I said no cookies.”
“Some got on my pants,” Pete said.
Steve sighed. “Stats, F.R.I.D.A.Y.?” It was a shorthand Steve had built with the A.I. to measure the severity of Tony’s panic attacks and nightmares.
“Hi Claire, hi Christine,” Pete answered, suddenly shy. Steve put his hand on Pete’s shoulder in silent support.
“Well I for one am looking forward to having a piece of this cake!” Steve said, putting a reassuring hand on Pete’s back. “Tony, why don’t you dish up?”
“He’s in his room. You remember how to get there?”
“Watcha thinking about?” Tony knocked his head into Steve’s shoulder affectionately.
“I’m just saying, what’s one more?”
“Alright crazies, let’s go get changed.” Steve looked back at Thor. “Thanks for looking after him. See you at dinner.”
“Right, of course.” Steve looked at Tony panicked. It was June now- they only had a few months to get him enrolled. They hadn’t talked about schooling, or not in such a real, immediate way.
“Arriving at the communal floor, sir,” F.R.I.D.A.Y. announced as the elevator doors slid open.
“I think it’s worth a try, at any rate,” Tony said, squeezing Steve’s hand.
“And what about when we’re all called away on a mission?” Sam asked.
She pointed at her eyes.
“Just some designs for Cap’s armour,” he said, zooming out so that Pete could see the whole design. He went on to explain the changes he was making and why he was making them, zooming in and pulling up equations. He had a feeling that most of it was going over Pete’s head, but he sat there raptly, nodding along with everything Tony was saying.
They walked out of the elevator and into the apartment. In front of them, the living room stretched out and led to an open-space kitchen on their right. A hall to their left led to the two bedrooms and the guest bathroom.
Steve crossed to the sofa and perched on the edge of the coffee table. He was still in full Captain America regalia.
“Yes, please.”
“Yes, please,” Pete said, leaning his head back against the pillow.
“What kind of snacks do you like?” Steve asked Pete.
While Steve changed a quiet Pete, Tony stripped the bed and discreetly put the sheets in his and Steve’s room. He wanted to take the stringy stuff to his lab but didn’t want Pete thinking that he was a science experiment that Tony wanted to observe. He grabbed a new set of sheets and put them quickly on the bed, joining Steve and Pete in the living room when he was done.
“Some of the other kids, they’ve… well, they weren’t particularly nice to him to begin with. I do the best I can, but there’s a lot of them to take care of.” Claire looked at them, visibly distressed. “Nothing drastic has happened, mind you, but I thought you should know.”
“Steve, go get a chair,” Tony said quietly, not looking away from Pete.
“No, F.R.I.D.A.Y. did. She was worried about you.”
“Pete’s had some… altercations.”
“Well, the Tower will have to go through a home check and there should be a few more meetings here between you and Tony and Steve, but once that’s done you should be good for a weekend at the Tower.”
“Well that will make things easy. Any other snacks you want?”
The little girl smiled at him, revealing two dimples. She grabbed one of his hands and tugged him towards the end of the hall.
“Okay,” Pete said. “Thanks. Goodnight.”
“Oh sh-“ he cut himself off, not wanting to scare Pete. He was plastered to the ceiling belly first, seemingly hanging off the ceiling by sheer will. “Hey, Pete,” he said quietly, keeping eye contact and reaching towards Pete slowly. “You’re okay, bud.” He moved so that he was directly under Pete, Steve moving quickly to his side. “Can you come down?”
“Okay.” Pete went back outside and sat on the step once more beside Hank. Claire led them to her office where a sheet of paper was already waiting on her desk. Turning the page around she explained that it was a permission form that Steve and Tony had to sign accepting responsibility for Pete and his actions and safety for the weekend. Once they were done, they went back outside to collect Pete from Hank.
“His name is Pete,” Tony continued.
Pete looked at them for a moment. “Would you do experiments on me?”
“We thought we’d help you unpack,” Tony told him as they dropped the bags on the floor. “Then we’ll have dinner with everyone.”
“We’ve all been very excited as well,” Steve said, hand still comfortingly on Pete’s back.
Pete nodded tentatively.
“Well, I think this is a good place to leave it today as long as you don’t have anymore questions, Pete?” Claire asked, interrupting them.
Claire slid over papers and two pens. Steve and Tony quickly signed the sheets and passed one back, keeping the other for their own records.
As they stepped into the elevator, Pete looked up. “F.R.I.D.A.Y., this is my friend Christine!”
“Bye, Pete. You be good now, okay?”
Steve emerged from the kitchen a while later, two plates piled high with sandwiches and two bags of chips under his arms.
“Yeah, Claire buys me math books that teach me how to do math. And if I have questions, she helps me. Science ones, too.”
“Since it’s your special day, you get the spot of honour,” Steve explained as he took the chair next to him.
“No,” Pete said on a small giggle.
Pete slid them on over his glasses. “What’s Steve gonna do?”
“Oh Pete,” Steve murmured. “It’s okay,” he continued. “We’ll just change your pyjamas and the sheets, no worries.”
“Wake me when it’s time.” Tony closed his eyes again.
They got into the elevator, Pete chatting happily about all the things he and Tony had done that afternoon. Tony patiently answered any questions Pete had, pulling out his tablet to explain certain things with drawings and diagrams. The conversation continued as they stepped out of the elevator and onto the main floor, both heading distractedly to the couches in the sitting room. They sat there, Tony holding the tablet with one hand between the two of them, Pete bent diligently over it.
It only took a few pages for Pete to be fast asleep, the long day having taken it’s toll.
“Yes! We just gotta grab my stuff.”
“S-s-sorry,” Pete hiccupped from Steve’s chest.
“Thank you for coming today,” the woman said without preamble. “You have no idea how much I appreciate this.”
“Okay,” Pete said.
“Great. F.R.I.D.A.Y., tell Clint and Natasha that they can get the tacos started and we’ll be up in about twenty minutes.”
“She didn’t need to be, I was just having a stupid dream,” Pete said, looking at his hands, which were still covered by his blanket.
“Yeah.”
Steve heaved himself out of bed. “Okay, let’s go, Tony.” Without waiting to see if Tony was following, Steve padded out of their room and to Pete’s down the hall. He tapped gently on the door and waited for a response. All he could hear, however, was quiet whimpering.
“Well don’t stop on my account,” Steve said gently, picking up another of his slices as an example. “I was just surprised, is all. Please, eat as much as your stomach can take, alright bud?”
“What are you doing, there?” Steve asked, approaching Pete’s table.
“I know, I was just teasing.”
“Sorry, habit.”
“So, what are we watching?” he asked as he sat beside Pete, Steve on Pete’s other side. Pete was clutching a dark brown bear that Tony had noticed on the bed beside him.
“Robots,” Pete said. Steve pulled out the set, taking them over to the bed. He quickly got Pete changed while Tony watched from the doorway.
“Who was it?” he asked, too angry to be polite.
“We’re going to head on up to bed,” Steve announced to the group, taking Pete by the shoulder and leading him to the elevator.
“Three hours.”
Meanwhile Tony and Peter made small explosions and tinkered with Tony’s bots on the other side of the room. The relative quiet of the room was interrupted by F.R.I.D.A.Y. around mid-afternoon.
“The art one?” Pete asked excitedly.
“Yup!” Pete answered. “Claire says you have to see her before we can leave.”
Thor, meanwhile, had surreptitiously kicked the cookie boxes under the sofa.
“Sounds like I’ve got a great suit coming up,” Steve said, finishing off the last of his sandwich. “I bet if you ask real nice, Tony will let you come down and help him build it, when the design is ready.”
“Wanda, Vision, Thor? You’ve all been very quiet, how would you feel about the introduction of a child into the tower?”
“Not a bad first day, hm?” He asked, sitting down and slinging his arm over the back of the sofa.
“Yeah, bud,” Steve answered, ruffling Pete’s hair. “I’ll grab your bag, Christine, and you can head to the car with Tony.”
“No!” Pete howled, laughing and pounding on Tony’s back.
Tony leapt up and raced to the kitchen; he was greeted by the sight of all the plates on the floor, Steve carefully tip-toeing around the shards of porcelain on the floor.
They dropped him off at the home after lunch, each giving him a tight hug and promising they would see him soon. Tony snuck a chocolate bar and small robot into Pete’s bag before letting him go.
“Sure, whatever you want.”
Pete looked at Christine. “Wanna knock it down?”
“Not me,” Tony said. “F.R.I.D.A.Y. just woke me up and told me Pete’s having a nightmare. Should we do something?”
“Tony and I live full-time in the tower, so you would live with us on our floor. We would be your main guardians, and your guardians on all legal paperwork. Is that okay with you, Pete?”
“Yup, she runs the whole tower since JARVIS and Vision sort of… well, let’s just say it’s complicated and leave it there, alright?”
“Hi Pete, I’m Bruce,” he said from beside Clint, ignoring him. “Codename the Hulk. I like doing yoga, chemistry and my favourite colour is also purple.”
“I’m Natasha, codename Black Widow. I like long walks, hand-to-hand combat and my favourite colours are black and red.”
“Any particular one?”
Pete didn’t answer, but wiggled until he got his arms free, throwing them around Tony. Steve wrapped his arms around both of them, holding them close.
“We’re not abandoning him,” Tony said, grabbing his hand. “And he is ours, in all but legal paperwork. We’ll get him soon. Promise.”
“Sure!” Pete scooped up the pile of plates, preceding Steve into the kitchen. Tony watched as Pete carefully balanced the plates, tongue sticking out in concentration. Tony enjoyed a moment of peace as Steve and Pete worked in the kitchen, the sounds of them murmuring lulling him into a sense of peace.
“Cool,” Pete exclaimed.
“Is Bruce in?” Steve asked.
“Okay,” Pete said, slowly picking his piece up again and continuing to eat. He ate another two slices, leaving three to be boxed up.
“Of course,” Steve said, putting Pete’s bag down beside the bed. “Now, we’re just down the hall. The bathroom beside this room is yours to use. If you need anything at all, come grab us, okay?”
The little girl turned back and laid a finger to her lips, tugging him a little further down the hall. They reached a doorway and Steve peered in; he was met with the sight of a well furnished living room, kids of all ages scattered on various pieces of furniture. The little girl pointed to a corner of the room where three boys sat. When Steve looked at her blankly, she pointed up the stairs, and then emphatically back at the boys.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve nudged him awake ten minutes later and scooped Pete gently off Tony’s lap.
She knocked on the door, opening it a crack and peering in. “Pete? I have some visitors here to see you.” She opened the door completely, revealing a small bedroom with a bed pushed up against the opposite wall, an armoire and a table. At the table was a small boy of about four, pencil gripped firmly in his hand and his tongue sticking out in concentration. As his door opened, Pete looked up, blinking owlishly from behind thick black frames.
“How long has it been?”
“Go ask Thor.”
“Nightmare?” Steve asked, eyes still closed.
“I need to protect him,” Steve interrupted.
“M hm,” Pete answered, straightening one out before turning to Steve and Tony. He pointed to the last backpack. Tony obediently opened it and fished out the robot and teddy bear.
“Pete, how do you feel about tacos?”
“Yes,” Pete said simply.
“Exactly,” Tony said. They pulled up to the home. As usual, Pete was waiting on the front step, this time accompanied by Hank. They eagerly got out of the car, smiling and waving as Pete ran towards them.
“Will I have to fight bad guys?” he asked.
When they reached their room, Steve gently laid Pete down in the middle of their bed and crawled in on one side while Tony got in on the other. Silently, they rolled so that they were both facing Pete and quickly fell asleep.
Thor cleared his throat.
Tony and Steve looked at each other. “Pete, would you want to come live with us, if it was possible?” Steve asked him.
“Good, good,” Steve answered politely. “Pete’s adjusting well to all the new people.”
“We’ve got a special dessert for you tonight, too,” Tony said, barely containing his grin. He was greatly anticipating showing Pete the cake he had ordered.
Pete’s sobs had quieted and he was now wiping his tears on Steve’s shirt, hands still strangely buried under the blankets.
“’Kay.” Christine swung their hands as they walked into the building.
“Thanks.” They stepped off the elevator and were greeted raucously by their teammates, who were assembled in the living room. The main group was there- they had decided collectively that this weekend, only people who primarily resided at the tower should be there. That meant that Natasha, Clint, Thor, Wanda, Vision and Bruce were all waiting for them in the communal living room. Others who occasionally stayed over, like Phil or Pepper, had been banned for the weekend.
“Got it.”
“What’s this?” Steve asked as he entered the room, gesturing to the unpacked bag. “We missed you on the front step,” he said gently, trying to make a joke of it.
“What kind of pizza do you like, Pete?” Steve asked when Pete had finished recounting his week.
The chart was something that Tony had created at the insistence of Steve, a digital record of where everyone is when. It was a giant calendar that was projected on the wall, and contained when people were out of town or when they would be visiting the tower, as well as any events or practices that the team had.
“Okay, well off we go then.”
He took in the sight of Pete and Loki on the sofa, Loki with one arm slung around Pete’s shoulders and reading aloud to Pete from his book. The empty cookie box sat beside Pete on its’ side, the current one clutched tightly in his fists as he listened raptly to Loki.
“It would cause more trouble in the long run than it’s worth.”
“We thought we’d start by everyone introducing themselves and telling you about themselves.” Steve gestured to Sam to take it away.
“Hey Pete,” Tony said as they stopped in front of him. “Did you have a good week?”
“We’ll talk about it when the time comes,” Steve said as the doors slid open. “For now, this is it.”
“Something about Claire, upstairs, and the boys?” Steve guessed, watching as the girl grew more frustrated. “Wait, are these the ones who have been picking on Pete?”
“Ice cream?” Pete asked.
“Welcome to the tower,” Pete said when he saw her eyes were open. “We’re here!”
“Do you want a story?” Tony asked once Pete was tucked in to bed.
“Oh gosh, Pete, no of course not,” Tony said quickly. “In fact, it is our active duty to make sure you are never harmed by the bad guys. F.RI.D.A.Y. will help us there.”
“Just a minute, Steve,” Tony responded distractedly.
Steve put a hand on Pete’s shoulder momentarily. “See you later, Pete.”
“Hello brother.” Loki smiled at his brother. “We were just reading.” Pete stiffened beside Loki, eyes going wide.
“Claire!” Pete called, revealing his excitement in the sheer volume of his voice. Steve and Tony were taken aback- they had never heard Pete talk above more than a murmur. “They’re here!”
Loki snapped his book shut, zeroing in on Pete and looking pensive.
The next couple of weeks flew by, everyone in the tower adapting to having Pete there. Jane and Pepper each stayed over for a few nights, introducing themselves to Pete. He quickly grew fond of them, Jane with her quiet and steady knowledge, and Pepper with her cheeky winks and candies she would sneak to him.
“Bye, Claire,” Pete said, taking a step forward and wrapping his arms around her waist.
Pete stays over for the first time
“Hey, Pete, ready to go?”
When they were done, they gathered the crafts they had made and slid them into a small bag provided by Shirley.
Tony opened Christine’s door and helped her out of the car while Steve grabbed her bag from the trunk.
“Math,” Pete answered simply, looking down at his paper. Steve put a hand on the back of Pete’s chair, leaning down beside him to peer closely at the paper.
“Okay, come over here to the workbench.” Pete followed him over. “Let’s get you ready first. Come stand on this stool.” Tony helped Pete up onto a step stool so that he could see above the counter. “Apron and glasses first,” Tony announced, picking the apron up off the workbench and putting it over Pete’s head. Reaching around, he tied it tightly around the back. Then, he handed the safety glasses to Pete. “Put those on, buddy.”
They did get looks from the mostly Beta crowd, of course.  Steve was Steve, after all.  Tony thought it might be helpful if he had a t-shirt made for himself that explained, ‘Weapons Manufacturer Included With Purchase.’   He’d be annoyed, but he really couldn’t blame them.
“Goodbye, Tony,” Steve said again, opening the study door, one hand catching on the frame. He looked back over his shoulder at where Tony leaned against the desk, arms crossed in front of him, a hard-to-read look in his eyes.
“Barton is right, Stark.  I shall consult my mother’s texts for something that might aid our Captain’s recovery, and find my brother, if I can.   Do not despair.  There is much of magic I do not understand, but this kind, it goes against the natural order of things.  Magic such as that, it does not stand the test of time,” Thor told them with a firm nod.
The next morning, as the sun still slumbered, the Royal party departed Hell’s Gate in a long, undulous line of camels laden with supplies and trim, dark-coated desert ponies who picked their way over the shifting sands. Other than Tony’s personal guards and General Rhodes along with a few of his handpicked men, the soldiers accompanying them were Lord Murdock’s men, who were far more accustomed to the harsh desert conditions.
“Never played that,” Cam said, eyeing the tall, marble pieces with interest.
“Jarvis—“ Tony started, scraping a hand through his hair. “I’m not—“ He stopped.  Let himself hear Jarvis’s words.  He wasn’t what?  Wasn’t wrong?  Wasn’t making this a choice where he had to lose something?  He didn’t know.  Up was down, right was left, none of it made sense, but Jarvis wouldn’t lie to him, and Steve gave him the robot they burned.  He wanted to believe that meant something.  “Okay.  Okay, so…how do I not do that, then?  How do I look at it with your super-special viewer thing where this isn’t the worst possible way of getting everything I didn’t know I wanted?  Because, I have to tell you, J, I could kind of use that right about now.”
,” Tony said.  “That stone,” he continued, pointing at the one that stood closest to the mountain, the one that was so different, “isn’t like any other stone I’ve ever seen.  In fact, no one has been able to identify its source in all the centuries we have been here. It seems to be unique in all the world, from what I can tell, and I went through a period of time of being fairly curious about all of this.  There
The Ugly Suit Twins burst out laughing. Not an auspicious start.
“Steve,” Tony breathed out in a long, thin keen. Steve shifted his head to the side, swirling his tongue around the dusky skin that circled Tony’s nipple, then sucked the nub into his mouth, grazing his teeth across it as Tony’s back bowed into an arch, his hands coming off the bedding long enough to wind into Steve’s hair, holding him there while Steve laved his tongue over and around the rigid peak. He released it, then moved to the other, giving it the same attention while he used his fingers to rub and pull at the one still wet from his mouth. Tony’s breaths were coming in short, sharp pants, like he couldn’t quite get enough air but couldn’t be bothered to actually breathe, and he was squirming under Steve, even less able to keep still now than usual, Steve thought with a small smile, mouth curving around Tony’s skin.
.  It’s who we are. It’s the life—the risk we all signed up for when we pledged ourselves to whatever cause we honor.  This,” he shook his head.  “Look, I’m just—I’m trying to say that I understand why this is hard to accept, even with everything Tony keeps doing to try to make it, I don’t know, appealing or whatever is in his head.  Tony, he…he’s a great King.  And better, a good man. The best I’ve known. But, he’s not a soldier.  He plays at war on a table, going over and over it in his head, and I’m damned glad we have him doing that, but it isn’t the same as being out there, breathing in the smell of blood and death, wondering if it’s you next and why it’s not.   It’s hard to walk away from a battlefield.  Harder than he realizes.   I’ve seen far too many who can’t leave it behind, or have left too much of themselves there to ever truly leave.  But, you have a chance here, Steve.  A real chance.  Tony, he—he cares for you.  He’ll do anything to make you happy, you must see that.”
Wow, you guys, thank you all so much for your support of this story.  You have made it such a joy to write.  I really, truly appreciate every single comment and kudos.
Sure, sometimes, there were things said in the heat of the moment, but that was true in all relationships.  Probably.  On the other hand, he couldn’t imagine Bucky ever saying to Nat that she, that…. he wouldn’t say things the same way Brock sometimes did, Steve was sure of that, because he wouldn’t even
Standing in front of his closet, filled with a shaded gradient from black to cream, Tony waited for the suit that screamed I Am Totally Unaffected By This to jump out at him.  When it didn’t, he sighed and reached out and grabbed the first one that his hand hit, a dark, steel gray, and dressed quickly, since Rhodey was probably waiting.
“Mr. Rogers! And, uh, guest.  I’m going to have to insist—“ the professor started.
“Who’s there?” Steve called out, gaze darting around wildly, desperately trying to find the source of the voice.  “Are you hurt? Do you need help?” No one answered.
“Unlike me, you’ve a few faults—very minor, mind you, which I am willing to overlook, being the magnanimous ruler that I am,” Tony teased.
and whatever the hell else is going on—somehow, that’s all rolled up in there, too, and that’s on me.”
He quickly cleaned himself up and was zipping up his pants when someone knocked on the door. His head snapped around in surprise, though he supposed he should have expected that. If someone taps out, obviously, management knows about it. Can’t exactly be a good thing.
Tony groaned as he buried his hard cock between the tight cradle formed by the valley where Steve’s thighs were clamped together and held it there for a moment, then withdrew and started rutting in and out in earnest.   Steve turned his head to the side to catch a glimpse of Tony, his eyes slammed shut, his head thrown back in ecstasy as he continued grinding between Steve’s thighs. Steve automatically crossed his ankles to add to the pressure, and Tony hissed in response, motions becoming erratic as his hips started snapping, pounding his cock into the soft, fleshy V formed by Steve’s thighs. Steve could feel Tony’s cock thicken between the cleft of his legs, his balls hardening as they slapped against the tops of Steve’s thighs.
“Your phone was in your pocket,” Steve reminded him.
“I’m sure he will let you join him if you wish,” Steve replied.  “I don’t think there are spirits in the mines, but the danger is real enough, even though I’m sure you won’t go that deep.  You must not wander off.”
“Of course, I thought about…that,” Steve replied.
“Rollout is next May for the new line?” Peggy inquired politely.  “I’m hearing good things.”
“It’s called an arc reactor.  Got a big one out in California.  Little get the crunchy granola people off our backs thing my dad and Obie came up with.  This, I take it you are this close to figuring out,” Tony continued, almost flippantly, “is how I got out of that cave.  This is also what Batroc is trying to sell to Stane, quite possibly right now. Or what he thinks he’s trying to sell. The specs are different, of course, but this is what Obie’s after.  Because it could, in theory, be weaponized. That’s not what it’s for…right now, it’s keeping tiny pieces of metal from tearing my heart apart, but the technology has lots of possible applications.  Energy, mostly, but—but military use, too. Not that I plan to ever let them get their hands on it,” he said, then stopped for a long moment, watching Steve. “I know—I know it’s a lot. If you want, I could leave my shirt on, or in the dark, maybe it won’t be so—”
“That’s…all at once?” Steve asked.
“Art is the lie that enables us to realize the truth,” Kirk said.
“Rest,” Tony ordered. “Won’t be long now.”
“He’s really not.  But, his life is a bit complicated, I guess you’d say.  Something you two already have in common, see?” she grinned.   “Steve,” she said, smile dropping from her face.  “This thing you’re doing, where you go through the motions each day and we all pretend we don’t see it?  If you tell me you’re happy, I’ll stop.  I will.  So, tell me.  Look me in the eye, and tell me you’re happy.”
Easy, Steve thought, it would be so easy.  Something roared in his ears, and his hips jerked, once, twice, three times, as he came into the curl of Tony’s hand with a sharp cry, painting Tony’s stomach and arm in long stripes.  When the last of the stuttering movements died down, Steve slumped back against the tile and looked at Tony, who was wearing his satisfied face, or trying to put it on, ready to make a joke or tease, but he caught Steve’s look and leaned up to nip at the corner of Steve’s mouth instead.  Not quite a kiss, but Steve turned into it, and it was, just a press of lips, but it was.
“Are you…asking to see me again?” Steve asked.
S for Stark, of course.
.  Something’s not quite right here. Like a fruit where the rot hasn’t reached the outside yet, but it felt wrong in your hand.  Tony could feel it. Tony could tell. Tony
“No?” Steve replied with a frown, voice wavering with uncertainty at the oddity of the question.
“You pick,” Steve replied. One hand went to the small of Tony’s back, warm and steady, guiding him forward to the steps leading up the deck.  Tony nodded and started to scroll through the playlists he’d created.  Demolition.  Fabrication. LIGO.  Jericho.  Inspirational, but probably not great dance music, Tony mused.  He finally settled on a Van Morrison tune and hooked the phone up to the speaker, setting both on the arm of a deck chair.
His feet were heavy and sluggish as he moved up the stairs and into the brightly lit vestibule.  Bits of the day’s mail were sticking out of the small, metal mailboxes.  Stan was standing in front of his open box, pulling out a stack of magazines that Tony would probably never be able to un-see.
He probably hates me, Tony thought.  He’s probably right to hate me. It still hurt like hell. In all of this, he never wanted an outcome where Steve was hurt, and yet, it seemed preordained that he would be the one to hurt Steve. Over and over.  Afghanistan, the aftermath with Barnes, now this. Steve was probably right to want nothing to do with him. After all, what good had Tony brought to his life? Seven thousand dollars and a side of betrayal and PTSD.  The Tony Stark Trifecta.
“True, and it’s pretty unusual these days, I’ll admit, but it still happens,” Fury shrugged, coming around to lean a hip on his desk just in front of Steve and pulling Steve out of his reverie. “The boy’s getting old for a Bonding.  He’ll be having his first Heat soon enough, I would imagine, if he hasn’t already and they’re just not saying anything,” Fury continued, making Steve’s eyes snap up at the seemingly casual mention.
“It’s fine, Tony,” Steve assured him in such a calm manner that Tony wanted to tug off his shoe and George Bush his ass.
“You asked for my best memory, not my favorite,” Steve pointed out as they strolled down the wide sidewalk towards the Strip, already glittering in preparation for the night.  Steve took a sip of his ill-considered drink and slowed his pace a bit, cutting around a group of Japanese tourists wearing headsets and following a bright, orange flag that bobbed and weaved along the walkway.  “Guy had been giving these two ladies a hard time, just because they were there together.  Just trying to watch a movie, you know?  And he just wouldn’t let up about it.  Like it was a personal affront to him somehow that they existed.  I was ninety pounds of asthmatic nothing, but,” Steve shrugged.  “Couldn’t seem to stop myself.”
When he was ready, it was easier this time to just push in. The body accepted him without much resistance. He forced himself to take it slow this time. Savor it. He wasn’t sure how long it lasted, but he could hear soft, wrung-out cries from the other side of the room and felt the body around him shudder and slump with what Steve hoped was release, though he supposed it really didn’t matter, and there was some relief in that. Everything he did here was good enough. It was freeing in a strange way.
Tony tried to muster his earlier excitement about the observatory, but could only manage a dim reflection of it.  Fake it ‘til you make it, right? Though steering clear of the Tesla coil sounded like the better part of valor, all things considered.
“David and I?  Oh, he was on leave in London.  Knew a few Brits from his tour of duty, and ended up at a dinner party with some of their families. Almost like they adopted him, since their boys were still off, you know?  I was there.  With my parents, of course.  Not many parties to be had in those days, and we took what we could get.  I took one look at David, all dashing in his uniform, and set my cap for him, right on the spot,” Charles recalled with a bright smile that melted away the years.  “My parents refused, of course.  He was no one, and probably going to get himself all heroically killed, after all.”
“You’re falling,” Tony said, the smirk back in his voice, and for a second, Steve thought he’d spoken out loud, then realized he was curling forward, slipping down against the wall, seeking more friction.  Tony rewarded him by stroking his cock from base to head, flicking his wrist around as he finished the motion as Steve let out a choked off moan that might have been Tony’s name.  “There you go.  There you go,” Tony chanted, the movements of his hand getting faster, harder.  Tony’s other hand gave his own cock a tug, then pinched at the head as he bit his lips.  “God, look at you.  I love you like this.”
“I see that you have decided to join the rest of the world,” Tony teased, his voice light and warm.  One of his hands was stroking Steve’s head, nails scraping lightly over Steve’s scalp. It felt divine.  Steve hummed with pleasure and buried his nose against Tony’s chest, taking a deep breath and letting his nostrils fill with Tony’s scent.  Splaying his hand, he dug his fingers through the fine whorls of dark hair, then followed their trail down the center of Tony’s chest to his stomach.  He was rewarded when Tony sucked in a sharp breath, ribs jolting against Steve’s cheek. Steve grinned as Tony reached down and grabbed for his hand.
“I’m glad you like it,” Steve said, or Tony thought that was what he said.
“You don’t think this is working,” Brock repeated dully.
“Good. Then, you listen to me, okay?  Voice of experience and all,” Barnes implored gruffly.  “I’ve watched you deal with this shit since we got out, and I know, I haven’t always been the most helpful.  ‘Cause of getting my own shit sorted, but still.  And that took me, and Nat and Sam and a whole fucking village of people.  Remember when Nat’s mom came to stay with us?  You think that was just a three-month mother-in-law visit for fun?”
“Hey, uh, Steve?  You okay?” Tony asked, reaching out a hesitant hand and finally settling on cupping it around Steve’s wrist after a couple of aborted attempts.  Through his suit, Steve could feel the warmth of Tony’s hand there, solid and real and here. He looked over at him.
People would notice the rings and then they would back the fuck off.  That was the whole point of rings, right?
“Yes, but let’s see how badly,” Steve said gleefully from behind the paper.  Tony grinned on instinct.  Steve peeled back the edge of the paper and looked at Tony.  Tony saluted him slowly with his mug and Steve smiled softly in return before going back to wishing the Yankees into perdition.
Tony wretched his shoulder away, surprising Stone enough that Tony felt only the slight sting of a reflexively tightened grip before Stone’s hand dropped from Tony’s back (neck).
“Of course, it’s a big deal,” Steve protested, turning towards the cabin with a sweep of his hand in front of him.  “It’s your birthday.  Wait--actually, your birthday’s now, right?  We’re past midnight.  Sorry, my time zones are completely off, I should’ve—damn, I, well—Happy Birthday, Tony.”
.  Really.  I-I told you.  You don’t need to worry or what’s British for worry? Fret?  Do I need to put an extra letter in there for absolutely no reason? No fretting, J,” Tony implored weakly.  “Really.  I’m fine.  Honestly.  Stop looking at me like that,” Tony protested, striding over to his workstation.
“To BARF!” Rhodes cheered and drank a long sip of his beer.  “I hate you.”
Life really wasn’t fair.  Honestly, he’d tried.  He’d gotten all dolled up, put his game face on, walked the Green Mile and come in here, only to have verbal diarrhea at the last minute because he couldn’t figure out what the guy wanted from him.  Compatible?  Well, your knot will fit fine in my ass, and that’s all anyone cares about, so yeah, we’re compatible.  Move the fuck on.  The dog and pony Newlywed Game was getting stale really fast.
“Take your time,” Steve said.  “Meet you on the deck,” Steve nodded, gave Tony’s hand a squeeze before releasing it, then turned to head into the cabin and drop off the basket.  Tony watched until the cabin door banged shut behind Steve, the intricate woodwork catching in the waning afternoon sun.  It would need refinishing soon, Tony thought absently to himself.
“I got kicked out,” Barnes reminded him.
“It is truly extraordinary, my Lord.  I thank you,” Tony replied, hefting the scepter in his hands and testing the weight before settling it back in the box.
“Are you—are you sure? What—“ Steve stammered.  He couldn’t think.  Tony’s leg was rubbing in a slow, stroking motion against Steve’s groin.
“Husband, actually,” Steve corrected quickly.  “I think I’m required to say that I’m the lucky one, but, turns out, it’s kind of true.”  That, at least, didn’t feel like a lie. Whatever this thing was with Tony, it was a stroke of luck that had been missing from his life for a long time.
Tony pushed himself off the loveseat and followed Rhodey out the door.  Neither of them spoke on the walk back to where he’d parked the car, and he definitely didn’t look down the street to the bus stop.
No, Steve thought harshly, breaking through the jumbled knot of thoughts in his head.  He put his hands to his ears, hearing only the pounding of the blood in his veins.
“Yeah.  So?” Tony asked.
“I thought you might like to go down to the beach for a little while today,” Tony suggested evenly as he handed Steve the last bag of muffins.  “It’s private.  You can swim or read. Or just enjoy the sun.  Whatever you wanted,” Tony finished with a slight shrug, as if he didn’t care, but he was rifling through a stack of mail someone had left on the countertop and Steve was pretty much certain Tony  wasn’t intent on finding out what this month’s Amex bill might be.
capisce?” he continued, wagging his fingers and rolling his eyes.  “Steve? Steve,” he called out, snapping his fingers in the air to get Steve’s attention. Steve just raised his eyebrows at him, then gave Tony a sidelong look.  “You treat him right, you hear me? You know what I mean. Um-hmmm. Give the man his due, that’s all I’m saying,” he said, slapping his hand against the top of the table for emphasis.  “You know what I mean, uh-huh, yeah, you do. Gotta earn your keep, am I right? Guys like me and Tony here, we work hard, man, we do, and we need to
The trees grew sparse and the land flattened into sandy earth as they slowly made their way parallel to the river. Steve could smell the change in the air, feel the salty breeze on his skin, long before he heard the sound of it, the pounding curl of the waves licking across the shore.  It jolted him, and he pulled up on the reins of his horse without really meaning to.  He looked over at Tony, unsure what to say.
was not one of them, Steve thought with a grin.
“It’s Brock,” Brock cut in.
“I’d make bank, and you know it, Wheezy,” Bucky replied, snapping his finger to a point at Steve.  “Still, this never should’ve happened. You never should’ve had to do this. If I’d just kept out of it, gotten ahold of my stupid temper—”
“It is not your place to question His Highness’ choices, General,” Rhodes said sharply, cutting into Steve’s thoughts.
Obie had looked at him then, and it had been one of those taking-looks.  The kind that followed you, that you knew were still happening, even when you couldn’t see them.  He remembered hating Obie a little then.  Swearing to himself that it wasn’t true, it wouldn’t be true, he wouldn’t let it.   And yet, here he was, jealous of David and his limited edition Viagra clock.
“Honey, I’m asking you to tell me about how that great, big Alpha cock of his splits you open until you think you’re going to choke on it, not whether he helps little old ladies cross the street,” Josh said pointedly.
“No, you don’t,” Steve continued, utterly unperturbed.  He took another mug from behind where he leaned against the sink and set it by Tony’s nose.  Tony groaned and sat up, grabbing for the brew gratefully.
The Avengers, his mind supplied, though the words just sort of floated in and hung there in his mind.  Fury.  The Avengers. Howard’s son.  Anthony.
