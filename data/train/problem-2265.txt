That day John received a note at 10-30PM, by which time he had assumed the worst and was worried about Sherlock, stating that Sherlock wouldn’t be visiting that day as his brother had arrived that morning. ‘I shall call you tomorrow’ was how the note ended.
’ folder,” Sherlock snickered.
“No Myc,” Sherlock explained, “I am fine. I don’t think you need to worry.”
The date had been going quite well until John had started noticing some aspects about his female companion that were conspicuously close to Sherlock’s deductions. One of the things he had said about Carrie the morning before was her attention seeking techniques and John could see one rather glaring example already. Not only had she insisted that he wear the white shirt, monogrammed with his initials, to the pub; she also took pictures of him and herself, posting it immediately on her Insta and captioning it as ‘The handsome doc in a shirt
Once the butler had left, John pulled Sherlock into his arms and kissed him hard on the lips. Sherlock moaned softly into the kiss and wrapped a leg around John’s hip. Despite the fact that he was taller, somehow John seemed to tower over him due to his authority, age and personality and Sherlock always liked climbing him, being lifted and horsed around in those strong, assuring and able arms. John’s strength was deceptive, as was his masculinity. Neither was toxic, it was just enough to be virile and attractive and had the softened, sensitive edge to it that kept him likeable and affectionate.
John tried to pull him back but Sherlock ignored him and pointed a finger at Lestrade accusingly. “I thought you were an officer and a gentleman, but you’re neither an officer nor a gentleman, obviously.”
“Don’t yell at me now.”
“No, is this for real, you are a detective, a real one?”
Maybe his voice triggered more emotions of rage and vengeance and John lunged at Sherlock. This time Greg whacked him and John got aggressive, aiming a punch back at Greg. Fortunately Jim grabbed his arm and pulled him back.
“Let me guess,” Sherlock said cockily, “I am
“Obsession?”
, I’ll be back.”
“Case.”
then? And
“How many?”
“Oh for Christ’s sake pick up the phone man…..”
I refused a case today. It wasn’t so interesting. But while I was refusing it over the phone the eggs burned and when I tried to flip them over, they flew upwards and got stuck in the ceiling. Mrs. Hudson almost got a crick in the neck staring at them in astonishment.
“No.”
John looked at the cake, the food, the wine and the gifts on the coffee table, then at the candles, balloons and party hats that Mrs. Hudson had organized. “So the birthday celebration is off then? Do stoned people even remember what happened, if they cut a cake or not?”
“Sherlock no,” Greg said, not even correcting the error of his name, “I didn’t tell you all this to mend fences with you. I know you’d have done that anyways, for Myc’s sake. This is because I wanted you to know….”
Sebastian’s eyes grew huge as he saw his lover’s form shift on the bed and then ‘expand’ fluidly, as if someone was stretching his form. He knew he should move, he should switch on the light, he should send out the signal for Mycroft and Greg to get into the house but his hands and senses were both frozen into space and time.
John grinned from ear to ear.
“Hold on till I get my fingers in…..”
So he had taken an hour each day despite his busy schedule to build the boat for Sherlock,
The amiable man slapped him lightly on the arm, “Pleased to meet you Sherlock! I know John very well for several years. He’s a friend and a partner here. You know, your boyfriend is one of the best Lego artists in the world. With proper channels advertising his talent and a little more branding, he can become the best ever. He will outgrow our company soon, that I am sure of.”
“Yeah but….”
He paused, eyes wide with shock. The door had been torn down and was lying in two pieces.
One month into Sherlock’s brief hospitalization with injuries sustained during a case, the detective was back on his feet again and busy as a bee. John tagged along on most cases with him, unless it was pure profiling or decoding, which really didn’t involve any danger or going anywhere beyond a desk and a laptop. It was proving to be
(See the end of the chapter for
It was at that point that Mrs. Hudson and those cleaning boys arrived, walking straight into the flat and the first thing they noticed were the two men. “Oh Lord,” Mrs. Hudson blushed hard and quickly shooed the kids out, even as some of them giggled and chuckled. “John, Sherlock, please lock the door if it’s something private and intimate that you’re sharing, like this,” she said, “Now I gotta lie to those boys and say you were just soothing Sherlock’s ruffled feathers and Sherlock was sitting there, lost in thoughts.”
The corners of her eyes crinkled even more as she smiled broadly. Her eyes glittered, her teeth were still mostly intact. She still retained glimpses of her earlier beauty and almost three fourths of her vibrance and glamor, even at this advanced age and despite debilitating illnesses. She reached out and took John’s hand murmuring gently.
Sherlock frowned, “Date?”
“What-what-what?”
. It would have worked had I not heard Sebastian yelling in the background about sausages burning and potatoes getting overboiled in the kitchen. Jim then sheepishly told me he needs to live out his old age with Sebastian so even a man as crazy as him won’t take a few chances at home.
“No, no, no, I am not reneging on our agreement,” Sherlock stopped him, “I promised five million and you will get five million. But I need a little more time. For now, I’ll try and get you something. There is a room downstairs, the wing where his mummy used to stay. There is a store room and there they’ve stashed quite a bit of jewels and art. It’s difficult to get the paintings out because they’re too big but maybe some of the gemstones. I’ll try and get hold of the gemstones.”
“Yeah, sweet,” Lestrade seemed nonplussed by the comments, “Nice romantic ideas and the usual reasons for believing you deserve your prize. So do they all. But you come across as a normal man, devoid of pretenses and lies. So I believe you. What’s his name?”
“Sure thing, thanks,” Ivan was smiling broadly, “Did that gentleman help?”
“Yeah, I sort of guessed when he spoke about those days. It’s a miracle how you two remained friends despite everything.”
“Nope. I usually don’t let them sleep in the same room, forget the same bed. If I am in their house I just leave afterwards.”
“B-as-tiaaan!!!” Jim cried out with pleasure and dizzying levels of ecstasy, shuddering all over as his climax practically consumed him within a few seconds, rendering him devoid of all senses except for the feel of Sebastian buried deep within him and cumming hard.
his safety and we know how reckless he can be. So it’s really good to know he is not alone anymore, that someone capable of being his protective shield is now with him.”
“Oh yeah, I would love to do a fifty mile bike ride along the lake if I could,” Sebastian looked excited, “I am sorry mate, you gotta do the walk on your own. I am more of the hardcore intensive activity sort of a person.”
The car screeched to a halt. Sebastian gasped. Everyone else jumped.
“Alright hop on. I can’t change the route but after I reach the next village and am on my way back to the depot in town, I will take the right turn and drop you at your doorstep. I promise you that. Come on, get inside now quickly. All my other passengers are eager to go home too so please make it quickly, yeah!?”
Sherlock blinked, then quickly retorted, “No!” Then he noticed the wry grin on John’s face and smiled back, “No,” he repeated more gently. He heaved a sigh of relief as they left the study together and kept mum till they reached the room. “Get into bed,” John said, “I’ll use the bathroom and join you shortly.”
“Then I have to stop, I guess,” John let go of the cock with a wet suckling sound, then pulled his fingers out gently.
“That would be awesome. I’ll just meet your gran before I leave.”
“Of course. This is indeed me and not my hologram! I am back and at your service Mr. Holmes.”
,” John cried out, trying to stop thrusting and controlling his urges to cum by tensing his legs and shoulders, “I’m so close baby, I can barely help myself. Are
“What does that have anything to do
(See the end of the chapter for
“Just see how he walks, how unsure he is, how nervous and self-conscious, even though he’d loaded he assumes no one will give him any importance at all.”
John and Sherlock stared at each other, confounded. Then Sherlock said a startled ‘Oh’ and looked over his shoulder. The origin of that cry was from somewhere behind and he saw a head and an arm bobbing over several other heads and faces. Sherlock stopped, stepped away from the escalators and peered closer, then smiled with recognition. John, on the other hand, got pushed on to the escalator by the rushing crowd after him and found himself separated from Sherlock.
“I always thought you were real but you weren’t. Today I was sure you’re just a dream, a hallucination, and you suddenly just…. C’mon hit me again, at least touch me that way, slap me or punch me if you will.”
“Like any other kid’s,” Sherlock replied, “But I was academically brilliant.”
Another car came by and screeched to a halt a few meters ahead. Then it reversed and Greg, recognizing the swanky Mercedes S class, quickly stepped forward to greet the person behind the wheel. Sherlock remained behind next to his own car, leaning against it and puffing away.
“No problems really,” she flashed a sweet smile, “But as they say…..two grown men living together when both can easily afford separate accommodations, it’s like screaming from rooftops and proclaiming, ‘Hey world,
Jim yelled and lunged at him while his second in command left the scene in a huff, prompting the mastermind to chase after him and let Sherlock go. After a blazing row Sebastian and Jim broke up for six months. Sherlock never told John why Jim seemed to target him so much but he had more or less guessed the reason. That day Sherlock had saved his own life but through his dicky-‘ness’ earned an angry and murderous adversary who eventually almost got him killed a few years later.
“Here,” Sherlock said as the enormous automatic garden gate opened and let them into the sprawling property that was surrounded by a compound wall whose height had been freshly raised from six feet to eight feet after the murder incident. “Consider this your own house Jawn,” Sherlock said, “We have a tennis court, a pool, a basketball court, a gym, a home theater with surround sound. You will find it easy to spend your time here. I have very good staff who will be happy to support you!”
“Well, a thirty-four year old saying ‘I wanna be this’ and ‘I am this’, like some confused moron.”
The next moment Sherlock was pinned to the mattress (on which he was sitting) by a fuming John whose face was near purple with rage. “My rants and ravings are nothing compared to your monumental stupidities and stubborn mule attitude. And don’t mistake for even a moment that I can’t slap the shit out of you if needed, my lesser height doesn’t mean I possess lesser strength. I am a true-blue soldier, no matter how often you try to pull that down by calling me ‘just a military surgeon’, the fact doesn’t change.”
Her friends discouraged her. Some said he was an arrogant prick and a misogynist who didn’t trust women. Others claimed he was rumored to be gay and was sleeping with Victor. When she checked with other openly gay men in the campus they said they had attempted to garner Sherlock’s attention, only to be rebuffed and ignored like Pamela was. Eventually Pamela concluded that Sherlock liked to play hard-to-get and had exceptionally high standards for a chosen partner and only she, as a beautiful and clever woman, could fulfil those expectations. “All he needs is to be seduced,” she said to her friends, “And seduce him I will.”
“Yes.”
The priest came down as speedily as he had climbed, said a smiley ‘thanks’ to him and then gave him a curious look. “Did you call me
John resisted doing a facepalm. Sherlock’s bedroom door was wide open and it didn’t need any genius to figure out the bed wasn’t slept in. Great, now mamma Holmes will also assume we are a couple and we sleep together, share a bed for reasons other than sleeping…..
“That is true,” Greg Lestrade gave him a curious look, “But this is also a salaried job and you will have to perform exactly what the employer asks of you. You can’t come back home without his permission nor go anywhere without a chaperone, you will even have to sleep with him if he asks that of you. How did you agree to this?”
He would read the text and respond to it later. “Oh I forgot the biscuits, I think I will get some biscuits too, we’ll have biscuits with tea, huh!” He said far too cheerfully to the timid looking man and went back to the kitchen to look for some.
“Hell…. Help? You want my help?” John stammered.
“What’s in that message?” Jim asked irritably, “Something more important than Sherlock’s life and John’s future?”
For some reason he could do neither.
“Go on then, give him an answer,” Mycroft said impatiently. He had done a full volte-face from his earlier refusal to accept this engagement. By spending two days with John he was now fully assured the man was a gem. Even though a little doubtful due to the amnesia he still suffered from, he had eventually given his blessing. Now he appeared to be siding with John, which made his partner Roger smile broadly and add, “Have pity on the poor man’s knee Lockie.”
“I wanted you to remember this evening,” John said, raising his glass.
“But then,” Sally defended her sister, “John is not a criminal and there’s no reason for us to report to the cops. It’s just some information that would be helpful in his recovery, officer.”
“I do not see why not,” Greg said, already getting back into the car, “Donovan, get in quickly. We must be on our way. Mike, you can follow my car but please, once there you should not touch anything or get in our way. Also, let me remind you it won’t be a pleasant sight. It’s quite a violent and gory crime.”
“Absolutely,” Mike said and left him alone. Sherlock didn’t want to tell him the real reason he wasn’t signing the documents. He didn’t want anything monetary from John, not until he had solved the Jim problem and clarified everything.
“Nope. He’s not a thief. Just a control freak.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, try harder then.”
“You are a careless, slow, distracted, uncouth, stubborn, blind-to-reality man with no ambitions and drive, and a very poor sense of house hygiene. I remember you enjoyed playing in the sand pit as a kid, now it appears you keep your flat covered up to an inch in dust to get that sand-pit feeling. Grow up, be responsible and stop being reckless.”
Two alternate endings, first one is happy, the second one is sad. By happy and sad i mean major character deaths or no deaths. The eternal tragedy of this story remains despite everything. How can one be at peace knowing they were the vessels in several killings, even if under a curse or spell.
“Yeah, I am aware I am sometimes rather loud,” the sleuth admitted as they stepped inside the flat and John locked the door and headed straight for the bedroom. “Don’t be too long hon,” the doctor called out to him, “This boner I have is not going to help itself. I need some assistance from you.”
That was all John could take and he could take no more.
Together they walked to the office Mike occupied and settled into two chairs. The chief practicing nurse in all of Mike’s surgeries and a very good ally, Mary Morstan, was also present. After greeting him pleasantly she was the one who started the story and the request thereafter. “You see Sherlock, we know it’s only been two weeks since you lost someone you cared deeply for,” she said softly, “If this seems too much at this point in time, please feel free to refuse. But Dr. Stamford, I and your off and on shrink Dr. Mortimer feel that it’s important that you get back into what you do best – work and helping people. While your Uni is out for another month at least, helping people and being involved in their lives needn’t take so long.”
“Don’t you do the same for Mary?”
“What? What are you saying?”
“Baby boy…..”
“You nitwit. Are you pretending you don’t know?”
“Hey Sherlock how about we take a cab to work today?”
To his surprise, in about five minutes Sherlock began to moan softly again.
“I love him truly. I can die or kill for him. Unfortunately it seems all I can really do is such extreme things but not everyday things like asking him out, asking him about his likes and preferences or even purchasing a nice gift for him that’ll bring a smile on to his face.”
“Never mind,” John intervened, not looking disappointed at all, “At least some good came from the visit to this store.”
The two of them stared at the lake ahead and the surrounding landscape as the stiff wind whistled past their ears, equal parts rugged and pretty, foreboding and inviting at the same time. “But these rocks are dangerous you know. They are unstable and fairly loose and you might lose a foothold any moment. So everything pretty does have some kind of a dangerous angle to it.” Sebastian nodded in agreement, “I invite that danger. It is the thrill of survival, the excitement of knowing the unknown and doing what you never thought you could do. Right now I feel I am testing my limits of trust and love and passion and enjoying myself every moment. Why would I question it then?”
Sherlock sat up in a hurry and was almost immediately wrapped up in an embrace by John who turned on the bedside light hurriedly. “Easy, easy, it’s only me, I am back baby boy,” the older man said soothingly, “Sorry I got so late but my mentor, the world renowned surgeon Diana Mason Wright, she spent more time working on my file than I had expected. It’s 2 am, go back to sleep hon.”
“It is a yes by all means,” John replied, causing Sherlock to go ‘Hurray’ with joy. “But, but, but,” John stopped him and cradled his face in his hands, “But do remember that I have a few conditions. Don’t be so tense, they’re all good ones, bearable ones, I think. Just hear me out.”
Sherlock looked at John balefully.
“Impatient are we? Yeah, was coming to that.”
Jim’s eyes glowed with joy and the cloud lifted over his face and aura. “Who’s worried?” He said, grinning and stretching and looking like a new person all over, “What are these things? I am so hungry, why haven’t you got me some food?”
“Mary?”
“Huhnn?”
“Jawn?”
“Turkey,” Jim said, grinning.
“Umm…. I think about fifty, if I am not wrong. But he has limited horses, only about ten. The rest are usually bred and sold, for a juicy profit.”
“You like the room, the way I did it up?” Sherlock asked eagerly, breathless from the kiss, “I thought it would be nice to keep her memories alive, the good ones, the happy ones. Shutting them up in a trunk or chest only makes them toxic, makes them putrefy. This way it’s fresh, healing and beautiful.”
To their relief even Mycroft didn’t seem eager for the name. “I think we must look at the act and not the person. Once we understand the damages, we can figure out who the culprit is and after that it’s your call John, if you want me to take any action. To be honest, from whatever I have heard so far, it seems to be an inside job. It’s someone who knows you and the house very well who’s done this.”
“What do you mean ‘they know’?” Greg asked, “Who are they…….” He paused when Mycroft looked out of the café window at someone and Greg turned automatically in that direction. Jim and Sherlock were passing by and they cast pointed glances at Harry before carrying along as if nothing had happened. “Don’t be silly,” Mycroft looked annoyed, “They are probably here to grab something to eat or drink. No need to make them arch villains in every possible way.”
Mycroft remained quiet for a little while, letting it all sink in. He knew Sherlock would need loads of time to heal. He also knew he would need time too, to properly understand and relate to the situation. His lack of empathy was much talked about in the family and he was very similar to his dad that way, they both meant well but they didn’t necessarily always express themselves well. Sometimes he felt he hadn’t treated his more sensitive brother very well. Perhaps he should have listened to his mum who always knew how to treat her two boys differently and therefore repeatedly advised him to look at things from Sherlock’s perspective,
John will definitely end up with Sherlock and down the line he will also suffer for his procrastination over their relationship. Please be patient and read on, it's a slow-burn, unlike most of my other series!
“Hey,” Greg sounded unusually stern, he raised his arm, “Wait a moment. I did this for a purpose. First and foremost, they deserve to know. They are family, it’s about their brothers too, we are not supposed to keep them in the dark. As for this situation and what Mrs. Holmes and Mrs. Moriarty said, we have to help them. Let’s make one effort, please, then we can think of other measures.”
“But the question is,” Greg continued, tapping his chin, “Why does he hate Sherlock so much?”
“I don’t mind something coming up, but I do believe you could have called me and told me, at least. I would have called another friend or a cousin to watch the play with me. I kept waiting for your call, kept calling you when you didn’t call…..okay, I guess there’s nothing else to say.”
She heard a growl close by, as if someone or ‘something’ was irritated. Then the sounds of it came closer, as did the growling and snarling noises. She turned and tried to run.
A reality beyond his dreams. A reality he was not going to give up on. A reality that was magical and for him to nurture. Yes, it was his new reality and he would hold on to it with both hands, he would hold on to his John with both hands. Sometime over the past few weeks John had created space in his heart and dislodged Jim from there. That, coupled with Jim’s greedy and demanding and insensitive behavior had finally given Sherlock the reasons to break off with one man and be with another.
“Jawn, why are you sharing all this with me?”
Greg was about to say something when Edgar called out, “I see someone down there. Mr. Holmes, Chief, I do see someone, it seems they are in distress.”
“Yes I would but what did you really ask?”
He heard the car start outside. He rushed instantly to the window of his study from where one could see the portico and the path leading out to it.
“Oh shit….” Sherlock went.
Beware - No cute, sexy, not so dark Jim that you find in most of my stories. This Jim is a bastard and a master manipulator.
“What?”
“Because it is NOT shit.”
“Everyone… but then….??”
“But…..”
clean up and set the table,” John insisted, “If we are sharing this place, we share the chores and errands too. Wait a minute, you meant to say you will put the arm….a human arm into the fridge? Our refrigerator?”
“Say no more please Mrs. Hudson.”
“Yes, I shall drive down right away.”
“I mean, he takes all major decisions, he is the better son, he is more responsible, he is always at the helm of affairs, he is the bigger support to the parents, he’s more popular in the family, he even happens to have a better excuse for being single. Hmmmff! He was a fat bastard as a teenager, when he used to
“Thanks sir,” she said, beaming with happiness, “Do remember sir, if I may suggest, that mothers also have an infinite capacity to forgive.”
Sherlock seeks and finds John again, against the wishes of all naysayers
The two of them together had been altered to give the impression of the woman lying in bed with that expression and John bent over him, both men being given ‘different’ bodies that were stripped of clothes with dicks and balls out. It seemed John was about to tongue his nipple.
“Miss you,” John whispered as he stared out of the window, eyes on the distance where he saw a couple strolling down the cobbled street. It was a gay couple and from a distance one of the men looked like Sherlock, with collar length curly dark hairs and a long and lean build.
“No, what would I need help for?”
“Oh, yeah, forgot.”
– Day started with Mrs. Hudson’s tea and her sadness filled report that the neighbour’s cat had taken sick and was with the vet. Someone had fed it last night. Some grains of rice were found around the passed-out feline.
John remembered at that point about Moriarty’s gift and quickly reached out for it. It was on the floor at that point but fortunately, within reach. Otherwise John didn’t have the strength to get out of bed right now. He tore at it clumsily, his movements still not coordinated, and found a large, curved and most spectacular looking toy. Purple in color, ribbed for maximum satisfaction and with a small device to make it vibrate against the prostate, it was indeed something guaranteed to spice up anyone’s sex life as long as they didn’t mind the size and intrusion that came with it. “Look at this,” he showed it to Sherlock, “I am sorry….I was so excited to see you I didn’t even check on this at all. Maybe we can try it on you later baby, I promise. Right now I am useless at anything, I can’t even try if I wished to.”
John looked at Sherlock as he mixed cocktails for guests, “What about the bomb he spoke of?”
“In that case,” Jim suggested, “I’ll just go up the pine forest and fetch some of the animals for our experiments. You think your brother will stop us?”
“We do have to take some action Myc,” Greg said, “We need to ensure this is not repeated. If others find out about them they will create a big hue and cry and then we will be FORCED to act. Do you want that?”
John had no idea what got into him but over the next minute he not only killed the psycho but chopped him into pieces in a mad frenzy, the blade of the axe colored crimson by blood. “You wanna kill my friend eh?” He shouted, his voice hoarse from screaming, “Well no, not in my watch. You will never kill another innocent soul again you motherfucking amoeba, this will be the end of you useless bag of bones and marrow.”
“You won’t do this Myc.”
The man in question lived in one of the apartments in that building.
. In his mind he knew that ‘someone’ was John but he never admitted it aloud.
“Really? Just so our jobs are safe and so are we, in this house? What about the fact that this man could be all kinds of wrong for him……”
. He leaned in and grabbed John’s head, kissing him so hard that his teeth and John’s teeth collided with each other’s lips, the faint taste of blood lacing their mouths as they swapped spit and emotions, kissing the hell out of each other. John, who had been contemplating a relationship with Sherlock for a long time, was glad he had finally taken the step and was eager to take this ‘forward’ to more
John and his newfound confidence are back in London and Sherlock is thrilled to bits
“No,” he said, “That was Benedict Cumberbatch.”
John chuckled mirthlessly, “That explains why the great detective didn’t learn it properly. It is always a will-issue for you, never a skill-issue.” To this Sherlock chuckled back and then flinched as he moved, revealing more soreness and aches across his body. John lifted the hospital gown and shut his eyes in sheer dismay. Sherlock might have been casual about it but the honest truth was that he had been whacked quite bad. There were bruises all over his lean, pale body, angry marks that made the doctor swallow a lump in his throat.
A mere confirmation, short and curt and pointedly defiant. Sherlock snorted and walked to the bedroom, kicking off his shoes somewhere in the hallway and leaving his coat and scarf somewhere on a couch or a chair. Vintage Jim! Original Jim! If Sherlock went sociopathic on everyone around him and they couldn’t return the favor, Jim took revenge on behalf of all of them by going double-socio on him from time to time. While Sherlock was sure Jim wouldn’t steal his credit nor market the pill like he was planning to, he was not very happy about Jim taking samples without discussing with him. He would have gladly given Jim a small bottle full of pills if he had only asked!
“Guilty as charged. Now shall we?”
Well, it wouldn’t hurt, John thought as he quietly slipped out and headed straight for the narrow alley behind he establishment. As promised, Ivan was there smoking a cigarette. He smiled broadly and said, “You’re a generous tipper. You also seem like a good man.”
Mycroft was not the nosy kind so, even though he raised his eyebrows, he didn’t say anything nor did he ask any questions. John realized he was making a mistake the moment he uttered those words though. Mycroft must not know. He simply must not. I have to cover this up in some way and put forth an excuse. “Actually a benefactor,” he clarified, “Someone I owe something to. They haven’t asked for anything and they shouldn’t have to, I’d like to do that on my own, by my own volition.”
“Thanks a million Megan,” John said and hung up, putting the phone on silent and setting it on the nightstand. He looked down at himself, the bed, his lover….yeah, Sherlock was his lover now, and the state of the room. Sherlock’s clothes and shoes and socks were strewn all over the floor, right next to his own clothes, some of which had been viciously ripped off. Half the bedclothes were on the floor, only part of them covered Sherlock as he stretched out majestically across the bed, naked and sated and sleeping soundly. The sounds of his breathing, the occasional snort and snore, mingled with the thumping heartbeats in his own chest. Only one thought kept crossing John’s sleepless mind over and over again.
“Yes brother mine,” Sherlock replied, “I will talk. I will tell you everything.”
“This is delicious,” John said in a pleased tone, “Really nice! You will get a nice tip for this. It’s been ages since I ate something that’s healthy and yet so delicious.”
“Mary is there,” he called out, “So is Harry and her partner. You have support there and the security personnel have been told to let you in. So there won’t be any problems.”
“Did you take an appointment for this afternoon?”
“You settle up, I shall be with you shortly,” Greg answered.
“I will resist digging in. You do your work and keep the data and facts ready. I won’t get involved unless I really have to.” John gave an indifferent glance. Greg lowered his voice, “Do you plan to tell him the truth at any point? My suggestion is that do that only when you are a 100% confident about him and have spent enough time reading him and his intentions. As I said, boy from a good background, has education, common sense and wit, but you are the sort of
Eventually they did put up a reasonably good tree and Sherlock teased John about sticking to the lower branches while he added the ornaments and the star on the top. All surgeons at Barts had been given a Christmas gift hamper by the management and John utilized those items for an early festive celebration.
“Yeah,” was all Sherlock said.
As Sherlock gets drawn towards John, they are temporarily separated by fate.
“Are you okay?”
John grasped Sherlock’s cock and gave it a few tugs and it was all over. For then.
Sherlock let out a screech that sounded suspiciously like John’s name before he shuddered so hard John almost got thrown out. He grabbed the base of his dick and shoved it back inside, thrusting madly as he chased his climax.
“But Jawn I…. ohhh…. Uhhhh….” Sherlock scrunched his eyes shut and his legs curled up as he felt a firm, hot grip on his groin and manhood, massaging and stroking and caressing, until he was so close that a shriek left his mouth and he batted his lover’s hand away.
“Wrong. I have the cage and the critters safely inside. They are all yours for the taking. I just wanted to know the man who had set that trap that the old coot just got trapped into. That’s why I had removed the cage, to have a word with you, if possible.”
Anthea nodded, a bit worried about the situation as he surveyed the road suspiciously, “I think we were so lost in chatting and frankly, we are both slightly tipsy too, and we didn’t really track the direction we took from the bridge. I think we better…….” She stopped and stared at the darkness ahead, the spot where the road curved and they could see the beginning of the pine forests in the distance. It was the same spot where they had run over the strange looking catlike creature. “Anthea,” Molly clutched at her sleeve, “What is it? Did you hear what I heard. It sounded as if someone…. I mean something growled and hissed and moved between those trees there. There in the distance.”
“Great. I shall see you soon. Don’t call me too often. I’ll text you, from that blocked number so he can never trace it back to me. Goodnight!”
“That is a word alright,” Greg winked. “Perhaps it’s time for us to take the step as well?” Mycroft asked, fiddling with his collar and looking a bit sheepish. I mean, it’s been forever and we have not given the ‘next step’ a thought.”
“Honest and innocent, non-diplomatic person?”
He dreamt of some place nice, where everyone was happy and everything was bright and sparkly. An aura of happiness hung around and he saw Sherlock playing the violin while he worked on a wooden ship he was building from scratch. He heard Mrs. Hudson somewhere in the background, chatting merrily, her voice mixing with the violin strains and other ambient noises from Baker Street.
Greg observed the young man for almost three hours. He had planted cameras in the scruffy little flat he lived in, where he conducted experiments, played violin, wrote extensively, practiced martial arts and taught students online. He was a recluse in all terms and purposes, the only people he met freely and regularly was a neighborhood gal named Molly who brought him groceries and helped him with cleaning and cooking. Then there was a friend named Victor, who visited him twice a week and they conducted experiments, drank beer and laughed together. The third person allowed in any time was the landlady, Mrs. Hudson, who brought him morning tea and breakfast and did his laundry.
They exchanged a one-arm hug before Mike’s expression grew a bit serious. He looked down at John’s leg and the support he walked with and asked, “Hey, how bad is it really?” John shrugged and replied honestly, “Healing, but taking its time. Sometimes I have this shudder in my arm and right side, but it seems that’s psychosomatic. Have been visiting a shrink and she says I just need to get back into action, work and all that, which is why I am here. In terms of medical clearance and ability to do my job here, I have the necessary endorsements.”
“Jim I am not….” Sherlock tried to protest but something happened right then that told the green-eyed man that his relationship and association with Jim was a far more dangerous and risky proposition than he had otherwise assumed. Out of the blue appeared Sebastian. The otherwise charming handsome hunk appeared very menacing with his imposing height and bulging muscles as he pulled a chair and joined them at their table.
Next to him was Jim who didn’t try to mince words. “She still likes you and could use a good dicking Sherlock. You better give her that rather than take up this case like a total noodle.”
Now, as Sherlock stared at it and touched it with awe and admiration, all those hours of burning the midnight oil or working the skin of his thumbs off paid off handsomely for the good doctor. He knew Sherlock wanted to be a pirate when he was a kid, so maybe this brought back some
Long legs lifted in the air, exposing the abused hole.
“What a way to identify someone….yes, the one who employs snipers and slits throats and puts semtex vests around people. James, Jim Moriarty, or muffin….as Mycroft calls him.”
, all prickly because you’re still a clueless idiot going cluelessly through life.”
“I am always right my friend,” Greg said with a noble expression, “Now if this man is interested in you he will make special efforts to look attractive to you, check himself out in any mirror or shiny surface you pass by, ensure his hair is okay, he has shaved properly etc. You’ll find him giving you glances on the sly, then looking away quickly when you look back at him.”
“That would be the middle name of the patriarch who built it, about a hundred years earlier, maybe a great grandfather. Close of the eighteenth century?”
“Good luck Sherlock. I always knew you two would go well together. Sort of like Yin to Yang and also like milk and sugar. Different, yet similar, just enough differences to be interesting but enough commonalities to be the best of soulmates.”
“Well then,” Molly congratulated Sherlock, “You’re on your pre-wedding-moon or whatever fancy name they call it.” Sally chimed in with ‘Sex-cation’ and it made even the normally somber Haines clasp his mouth and chuckle softly.
John’s gasped, half sitting up and wincing when a bolt of pain and cramps shot through his right side. Now he knew what was the source of that. Sherlock was lying over him and had effectively used him as a pillow. Naturally all his blood supply had been cut off, with the curly haired man’s entire weight spread out over his leg, shoulder and arm.
a couple,” Mrs. Hudson whispered into John’s ear, startling him. She was grinning but there was also a look of extreme peace and happiness on her, as if she was watching her son settle down and get comfortable in life, with a partner she approved of. John, despite his extreme urge to correct her again, decided to just let it go and give Sherlock the silence he needed to fall asleep.
“As a matter of fact we do. This ill-fated gentleman, Harry…. Yes, that was his name, he came to see us the same day he died. He was trying to warn us, told us we are in danger and if in doubt, to turn to someone called Marvin Von Dyke for help. We were hoping you’d help us find him.”
Sherlock got up and moved back like a torpedo, gasping and groaning as he put too much pressure on his right foot. He left John sitting on the chest in a stupefied position, eyes wide and jaw slack. The beautiful moment had transported him from his dull, drab world to one that had rainbows, purple hearts and rivers of milk, honey and chocolate. Suddenly he was back to the grey planes of the present, apart from Sherlock’s haloed presence in it. He cleared his throat. “What is it Mike?” He called out. The other man, who was somewhere in the bedroom suite but not in the inner sanctum yet, called out loudly, “Are you in there? You had an appointment, remember? You’re already ten minutes late!”
Anthea and Irene went to Molly’s room. She had a slightly elevated temperature and was getting occasional and mild giddy spells. Her blood pressure had fallen. Nerves and paranoia had put her under the weather and she gave them a weak smile as they walked in. “How are you doing now?” Irene asked, sitting next to her, “There is some color back on your cheeks so I assume better than this morning!”
John’s shoulders slumped as he finally acknowledged his mistake, “I should have been there with him. Instead I chose to go to a pub and have a drink. Needed a bit of time off to relax after a pretty hectic month.”
“Will it hurt?”
His name was Sherlock Holmes and he was a handsome, unique man of about thirty. Tall, green eyed and dark haired, he was the sort of man one would pause their steps and look at twice. There was something about his smile, his posture, his confidence, and his overall aura that made many people like him and several developed full-fledged crushes on him. But Sherlock was single. In fact, some said he was also a virgin. Not that his 30 million inheritance had made him snooty or snobbish, he was just a very shy, very reserved man. He worked at the huge university located on the other end of the town, as the assistant head of department for inorganic chemistry. A PHD and a wizard in the lab, as well as with the way he conducted the classes, Sherlock was the man any couple would want their kids to bring home one day.
John nodded slowly.
“So someone very strong then,” Jim said.
to the two boys I had raised from childhood to late teens. If Sherlock has chosen you, after weighing all pros and cons, then I am with him.
“Yes, yes?”
Mrs. Hudson was decidedly antagonistic and told me I am a numskull outside of my cases and investigations. So the old bat compartmentalized by intelligence but I dare not revolt or there will be no morning tea, laundered clothes and the occasional biscuits, cakes, scones, sandwiches and milkshakes.
“They would be happy if we do,” Jim said, pointing with his eyes at Sherlock’s villa, “As much as your mummy and your sis would love it, your housekeeper Polly too. She sure loves the idea of the two families being connected by marriage. Remember when Eurus told everyone she is seeing David? The most disappointed person was Polly……”
She gave him a startled look. The production manager, Manuel, was similarly surprised. Johan lit a cigarette and smirked, “I do have some sources and I have been in this line since 1990. I have seen those days when his father, Alfred Hess Watson was in charge and before him his father, aka John’s grandfather and his grand uncle were in charge. There is a reason why he doesn’t like the spotlight. Many years ago, nearly twenty five years ago I suppose, he was thrust into the spotlight for very unflattering reasons. His father had a scandal, much like his grand uncle used to have and that triggered a series of events in the family. Marriages broke up, lots of talk in the press, people accusing each other, silences needed to be bought, children sent away to high-security boarding schools to keep them away from this mess.”
Holding both her ‘weapons’ tightly she inched towards the kitchen doorway.
“You are a man after my heart,” Jim grinned.
“Hey, don’t get upset and jealous, even if it’s cute,” Jim said quickly. Sebastian cleared his throat irritably and added, “They are using the other bathroom but with a new show on, the crowd’s getting bigger and bigger and someone will complain about this toilet being closed. You two need to get out of here now.”
“Say, there’s this really nice play at Almeida. I always love social satires and laughter riots on stage. Then tell him the F1 race in coming up, at the Silverstone track, and how you long to visit the racing circuit. Mention this really cool café that’s opened up close to your college or…”
Sherlock nodded, “Yeah and as luck would have it, they had two rooms free because of last moment cancellations before the Easter fair. Just our rotten luck man!”
.” Jim then said something that knocked the living daylights out of Sherlock “As for you,
“What if I let him down?” Sherlock sighed tremulously, “What if I wake up one morning and everything is just gone. Like a dream that was too good to come true.”
“Yes, we should go and see her, I haven’t seen her yet,” he said with ample regret in his voice, “Thanks for reminding me about my duties. Sometimes I do tend to behave like mum, just put myself on centerstage and not look at all the bystanders who deserve to be there…. Harry, Harry I am sorry. Whatever you saw, I am sorry, you should have never seen me like that, I should have never done that, I am sorry….” He took her arm, noticing that she seemed relieved and happy at his reaction, “Come on, we must go and pay our respects to nana….. oh, by the way, did Mike write to you about coming over today? We were supposed to meet tomorrow, weren’t we?”
“What’s this?” Sherlock looked at his hands, where John had placed the key.
Not until someone called out, “Sherl?”
Greg's investigations lead him to the doorstep of a certain man and a surprising discovery ensues
“Yes?”
He rushed towards his brother and called out his name, a stunned Greg right on his heels. Sherlock turned, stared for a moment at his brother and Greg right behind him, then blankly stared at the way ahead. The cigarette dropped from his hands and he gave the two men another strange and blank look, then murmured something like ‘I don’t even know how it went so wrong…..’ before he keeled over and right into Mycroft’s arms. Greg also stepped forward and grabbed him, prompting Mycroft to snap at him. “I got him. Please bring my car here so I can put him in. He doesn’t…. I mean we don’t need any help from you are anyone associated with John Watson.”
The moment he drove in through the gate he saw Ben running towards the car. He slammed his foot on the brakes and the car screeched to the halt. Sherlock rolled down his windows, “Ben, what’s the matter?” The other man was wringing the neck of a bottle of fertilizer, “It’s unfair, it’s all so unfair, he didn’t tell me before leaving.”
As they traversed down that path, went past the house of the Stamfords and down the lakeside till the first bridge, which was the footbridge. “One part of his body was found here,” Donovan pointed at two cops standing there, one of them marking a spot. “One part,” Greg Lestrade repeated, “Christ, what a mess!”
“He is not really the bridegroom Sal. He is a pretend-play actor in the drama, just fulfilling a role for a few days and for an astronomical sum of money. We don’t have to character-assassinate him at this point.”
“Nope, just tried to tell him not to trust strangers,” Greg laughed. Jim nodded, “I can see ‘Sherlock’ clearly in this story, stupidly generous and weirdly non-perceptive. Always pick the weakest link in the chain and try to mend it, even if it doesn’t need mending or deserve mending. You see, some people are meant to be left alone. He tried to do this with me once, found out I was stronger than he was! Then he said…..” whatever else Jim wanted to say was drowned out by the noisy squawks of Greg Lestrade’s cell phone. Both the men craned their necks to check who it was and Greg quickly answered it when the name ‘Phillip Anderson’ flashed on the screen.
Lestrade turned towards his assistant. “He will stay in my guest room, not the hotel. Charge him only half the fees I normally take.”
A feeling of guilt had besieged him and therefore he came back home
“Strangest thing, we didn’t see any of that. When we searched for the animal, we saw a human there instead. He had been shot through the head. Naturally we were all alarmed and scared and we decided then and there to bury that incident. We dumped the body in the water several miles ahead and got the boys treated in the next village for their injuries. But the disturbing thing that really happened was something else.”
“Jawn, Jawn, hold me, hold me please, please….” Sherlock was trembling, the notion that someone had sneaked into the room to murder John weighing heavily on his head and heart. Unfounded fears they might be, but he couldn’t stop them from happening. He wished it was only a nightmare or two that was bothering him but he knew it wasn’t. His nightmares started from the moment he woke up, knowing that the reality that stared him in the face was inescapable, and how wrong everything could turn out to be if he put one step wrong. He swallowed audibly and sagged heavily in his lover’s arms, clinging to him for dear life.
“Not to mention that whatever I said was a hypothetical situation, a sort of ‘what if’. This isn’t going to really happen though. The people in there intend to like you so their entire effort will be directed at making this work. So you really don’t have anything to be worried about. Just be yourself and that’s that!”
“Me too,” Sherlock said.
“It is your life, so I shall draw the line here,” Sebastian asked for round three of their whiskies, “But if I were you I’d take a call and stick to my decision. But before you do decide, think about which one you wanna let go of. Because there’s no way you can have both of them.”
John to prove himself to be an honest, sincere man who had integrity and truth as his support, not deceit. But John seemed literally hell-bent to carry on with this plan so when he dismissively suggested that ‘they could attend Mycroft’s lunch irrespective of tonight’s plans’, Sherlock felt himself slowly resigning to the fact that Phil might be right this one time. Still, he made one final attempt. “Why don’t you come over to my place instead. Mrs. Hudson would cook us a fine meal. Why spend a bomb on an overpriced hotel no matter how good they are?”
“Now, please…”
Even though the very mention of Sebastian’s name had made his spin freeze, Sherlock found the good-natured and dignified lady far too engrossing and likeable to think about that lemon headed jackass. “I think ‘gran’ is a very good idea. Call me Sherlock please, or maybe Will?”
“What are you doing here?” John asked on top of that.
in one of those known ehm, places….I’d say one of the infamous places, one of those dens where you normally find all the-the….the…..addicts and substance abusers.”
Sherlock felt a bit awkward and stiff for the first time. He wasn’t used to sharing a bed, forget a bedroom, and it suddenly occurred to him that he didn’t know his ‘employer’ very well. A few hours spent together was fairly enjoyable but not long enough to qualify them as friends. It seemed as if he was sharing his private space with a stranger and then there was the expectation of sex, of physical intimacy, which didn’t quite seem to be welcome at that point.
“Yes, absolutely. So you remember.”
“Moran sir, Moran,” the man corrected him, clearly finicky about words, “Yes, to the Yard I can provide the details. I don’t see why not!” He jotted down the details on a piece of paper and as a double measure texted the Inspector the address as well. “But let me tell you these are extremely expensive pieces,” he added as a means of advice, “This one costs half a million. It might have been stolen or traded off or loaned out, the possibilities are enormous. Sometimes even the rich make a quick buck by loaning out a watch like this for a movie or a TV series.”
John had to count backwards from ten to control his temper. Trust Sherlock, believe in Sherlock Holmes, have faith on your man, he counseled himself again and again but his faith evaporated and his trust failed miserably. He braced himself for a horrific evening, disappointed guests and general mockery of their household as he reluctantly began to brew some tea. But from the kitchen he could hear Sherlock as he made the first phone call.
“Office?????”
“I mean it. You are, admit it now.”
John blinked. He had got a bit lost in his thoughts and his lack of response had been misinterpreted by Sherlock. But that was odd. Why and how could a genius like Sherlock Holmes deduce incorrectly?! He could tell a person’s blood group by just glancing at their plate of food and here he was, unable to read into his best friend’s expression. Oh well, my happiness and acceptance means just as much to him as his joys and comforts mean a lot to me. We are on the same boat…..
Greg bent down a bit to bring himself to the level of the car window and Sherlock’s face. “Hey, don’t pretend you have been wronged. You made a mistake and suffered the repercussions and punishment. The only important thing here is that you learn a lesson from this and never do something as stupid again. You threw away an amazing life and an awesome man’s love! But all that aside, I don’t want you to self-harm either. You seem quite out of it so I will drive right behind you all the way to Baker Street if I have to.”
“And through our connect,” Jim interrupted, “Your eyes and ears as well.”
“Jawn, Jawn, Jawn….!!!”
“Jimmy please wait a moment….” Sherlock tried to reason with him but Jim turned and left, whistling a tune and looking all happy and smiley, as if nothing untoward had happened right now and they were merely taking a stroll around the house. Sherlock chased after him but his footsteps came to a halt when he spotted Gretel, standing right there at the bottom of the staircase, on the landing which led to the southern wing of the house and its hallways. “Heya old goose,” Jim said in a sarcastic manner, making her gasp, and skipped downstairs to join Sebastian and John. Sherlock followed, much slower and his steps measured, eyes firmly cast on the floor lest the old maid spotted something in them.
? Now that I think about it, where is the next batch you had been drying in the oven?”
“Yes, yes I do, John Doe. You want me to meet him or call him? Tell me what you’d prefer and I’ll go by that Sherlock, don’t hesitate please.”
“Should have allowed you to sleep for a bit longer.”
“Of boring me to death?”
Mycroft sighed, “Do we have to live here?”
“Try me,” she said confidently.
“Yeah, I want to, but…..”
There was nothing Sherlock could refuse at that point to John and soon he dropped his clothes, standing as naked as the other man, flushed pink all over and biting down on his bottom lip. The look of appraisal in his eyes was mirrored by a similar look of admiration in John’s and Sherlock felt both proud and relieved. He felt validated in some way!
What would happen to Mary? Should he confess to her? No, she was a kind and clever woman, but even for her this would be a bit much to absorb. She would walk away without a backward glance. No, he couldn’t talk to her about this.
“Hmmm, yes, I really do believe so. I’m sure so does Seb!”
During this time the retainers worked their magic and when John stepped back out, the fluffy towel around his hips nearly dropped as he jumped in astonishment. He breathed in a cold but fresh air and took a good look around the room, admiring the quick fix from Sherlock. “Sherl…. Why this is so…. I feel like I am alive again. What as I living in all this while?”
“It’s on that shelf, up there, in the ceramic jar with the boho print.”
“Shall I walk out with you?” He asked in a trembling voice.
OMG, was the first reaction of John Watson! Had someone forced Sherlock into these clothes?!
When John called Sherlock the next day to have lunch with him, pulling out all the punches he had to take things to the next stage, he was horrified when he heard Phillip in the background. Moments after Sherlock had accepted, Phillip took the phone from him and said, “Hey John, you wouldn’t mind if I come along too huh? After all the more the merrier, right?”
by the end of the longish spiel I threw towards you? Tell me the truth, did you really understand much?” When John nodded again he seemed a bit appeased. “Alright, good you admitted. But let this is your first lesson. Do NOT say a yes when you are not sure what you’re saying a ‘yes’ to. That could be a stupid thing to do and potentially dangerous for you. There is no shame in asking for more information, clarifying or asking questions to get to the bottom of things, got that?”
Jim immediately softened his tone, “Not really. Sorry I lost it. Just earmark those assets okay?”
“Have any of you seen or experienced anything?” Anthea asked, “And what happened after this curse? Did those kids from every village house turn into some form of feline ferociousness once they became legal voting age, huh?!?”
“Then prepare to die. It won’t be us, it would be the curse again. Ciao!”
“Yes,” Greg said with a grateful look, “Put that through with Charlie. As for the store….”
“I am
“Assistant, co-investigator, Martha did tell me not to use that word but I am older than her, and forgetful, so please forgive me son,” she said, sounding genuinely apologetic for her faux pas, “I am Mabel, Martha’s elder sister.”
He chewed on a mouthful and got emotional again. Then rushed out of the flat saying he needed to see a dentist.
They ran in there and searched all over, from the drawers and cabinets to the counter and even the fridge but there were no knives. John had almost given up when Sebastian said in a tone of relief, “Oh thank Christ they’re right over there!”
Sherlock was lying between John’s open legs, his back plastered to John’s chest, a glass of wine in his right hand. He took a sip, gave John a sip and whispered, “Aside from a sore arse and a perpetual feeling of being ‘drained’, I think every bone in my body just screams ‘happy’.”
“Me too,” Jim echoed and ran ahead of Seb, getting into his bedroom and landing in bed. By the time Sebastian had closed the door Jim was half naked already. Seb quickly dropped his pants.
“And she told me that she informed Mrs. Hudson, her only friend, a couple of days ago that she had heard growling noises in the woods,” Sherlock said, putting a new spin on the whole thing.
Sherlock woke up and knew by instinct he was not alone in bed. John was with him and he was in his arms, safe and sound, loved and protected. For some peculiar reason, he felt like John was the stronger, more anchored and powerful partner in the relationship and he was the dependent one, needier too, if one might add. Perhaps it was the emotional thing where Sherlock felt he was more vulnerable than John was. From time to time he had noticed a particularly admirable quality in John, a steely look in his eyes that told him the man was far mightier than his circumstances permitted him to show.
Both of them knew it was the brother speaking and not the Ranger but neither of them had either the boldness or the heart to explain that point to Mycroft Holmes.
John watched, mortified, as the same eyes that used to stare at him in utter adoration now looked at him as if they were afraid of him. Not just afraid,
“Very well then,” Sherlock responded and the two men stepped towards the pet store. Jim tugged at Sherlock’s arm and said, “Look, I don’t wanna hurt them but I am not keen on pets. I don’t have the time to care for them and mam won’t be too pleased to have more work added.” Sherlock clicked his fingers and said, “I got it. How about we buy something that is caged. Perhaps that way we won’t add to much work or supervision and not upset our men!?!”
. John stayed tight-lipped about makeover while Mary made a gesture of ‘awesome’ and said, “Way to go, sexy Shezza!”
“Yeah, all very delicious. Thanks for organizing this one Jawn. I know I was supposed to make some plans but after this incident I sort of forgot all about it. Next time it will be me planning.”
I think it must be his work at the hospital. Poor darling is
Greg’s face lit up with joy. Finally a breakthrough, finally they were getting somewhere. “Of course I remember,” he responded, “Who caught him and where? Where is he now?”
“It is a sort of a sedative, works more for some than others,” John said, “C’mon, to your room.”
“You’re reading it all wrong sir,” Mike answered restlessly, feeling nervous, “When he was brought in, one of the students called him a cousin. Later we got to know he wanted to avoid a police probe and made that silly mistake. As soon as we realized we reported this to Charlie.”
“Yeah, very much! I want a black one too, semi-formal, single button casual blazer for regular use. With a purple shirt. You like purple on me.”
John merely raised an arm and asked him to wait.
“What the fuck,” Sherlock choked up.
“The tea!!!”
“Your Sherlock?” Sally raised a brow.
“Sherlock…..” And that was the last straw for John. Why drag poor Sherlock’s name in this?
From time to time Sherlock kept glancing at John, hoping the man would make some small talk at least. He really wanted to go to the London Habitat Center and visit that exhibition, he wanted to go to ‘Peking Spice’ and have a nice scrumptious lunch there, over the weekend it wouldn’t be a bad idea to watch the latest play in Almeida, Shaw’s ‘Arms and the Man’. The guy playing Bluntschli was one of Sherlock’s favorite actors. The first play he had seen as a grownup had this actor in the helming double role of Dr. Jekyll and the ghoulish Hyde. The same man was now a character actor on screen and a TV star, essaying lead roles in several series and soaps.
But he somehow proved himself wrong. Shortly afterwards he fell asleep again, once again without realizing when he had slipped off. This time he didn’t dream of anything, instead enjoying a deep and dreamless rest that left him refreshed and very cheerful when his eyes opened next. He felt reborn, he felt rejuvenated, he felt nice and warm and cozy.
“Watson. But call me John please.”
“Fuck.”
Sherlock finally bolted all the windows bar one and came back to her. “Not the highway for sure. In fact I don’t intend to go out in the next three days unless it’s some emergency. We are well stocked up with food and your medicines and sticking to indoors seems like a jolly good idea at this point in time!”
“Superintendent it’s me. Pablo.”
He literally jumped when John came out of the bathroom. In a comical twist, they both spoke at the very same time. “I think I’ll go in now.” “You can use the bathroom now.”
does those things?” John whispered, shocked and startled. Sherlock put his finger on his full lips and winked, causing John to back off temporarily. “No Jimmy,” the detective continued, “Not cancelling. But I have run into a problem. Please Jim,
“Not as beautiful as you my magician,” John rubbed noses with him and made him sit down on a cushioned seat, “You have accomplished so much in such a short time. My diet, the recipes, the garden, this room, Good Lord baby boy, you turned out to be an old soul after all. Not a typical shallow twenty-four year old but a mature, wise kid. No, you’re no kid. Definitely not a kid. You have far more insight into me and my mind than even I do!!!” He looked around the room and knelt between Sherlock’s long legs, gently parting them by the knees, “And now I feel like rewarding you in a way that only I can…. Something they won’t find in any bank account or some designer store.”
“Alright,” he said, “Let’s meet him but no promises.”
“Please Jawn, can we stop this discussion and think of the way ahead?”
“Sure.”
Come on Sherlock, you made a major faux pas by thinking it was about Jim’s underwear and not the painting. Now use the situation to your advantage. He cleared his throat, unabashedly displayed his nude beauty to full advantage and crowed.
“Now you will punish me with silence?”
“Morning! Yes Phil? Ready to start in one hour?”
Sherlock assured him nothing like that would happen this time and he had it all under control. He would be back before Christmas, maybe on Christmas Eve.
Sherlock gasped as he walked closer to the bed, tentative footsteps that didn’t falter but stayed on the cautious side. “You-You knew that I was about to come and see…. visit you today?” He asked, unsure of what John meant by that surprising opening statement.
Mycroft blinked at that, the shock registering on his face. But a twinge of hope flared up in him and he came closer and sat down next to Sherlock on the bed. “Did you just say that Lockie? Have you truly broken up with that poisonous creature, Jim?”
He paused and added, “Anyone older especially caught my attention. I felt I was giving something back to my parents this way. Don’t ask, it’s an odd way of compensating…..”
“He is with someone I used to deeply respect once, Colonel Sebastian Moran. Made it to colonel in record time and was a jewel in the army’s crown. Until he went berserk and gunned down his superior officer and half of his peers and platoon members. Dishonorably discharged, became a very violent alcoholic. Then he disappears for two whole years and resurfaces suddenly,
“Molly?”
She gasped, “I…ehm….Sherlock…..” she didn’t know of a comeback to that.
. John kissed Sherlock’s temple and whispered, “I like to call it sex. Or making love. You might wanna call it your initiation, breeding, or an experiment with rather pleasurable results. I promise the results will surprise you! Don’t worry, I will be gentle. I am mindful of your injuries so allow me to take care of you while you lie back and just enjoy it all.”
“Dunno, feels a bit odd seeing you like this……just!”
“But London has cabs.”
But of this, John had no clue.
“Our first night together,” John smiled, kissing Sherlock with devotion.
Jim looked at Sherlock with some surprise. He was usually the more aggressive and evil-loving of the two but that evening there was a change in Sherlock’s eyes and tone, he could sense the man was as desperate as he was. Sherlock was afraid, clearly he was, and it made him afraid too! “You are right,” he murmured, slipping into the darkness along with his best buddy, “We must do what it takes to hold on to our men and our happiness.”
“Hmmm?”
“Leave that on to me, John.”
“I’ll just get it.”
“Oh don’t play the ‘I am too great a mind to be destroyed so soon’ card. Not buying it.”
“Yeah, I can see that,” John replied with a dollop of irony, “Where is he now? Can I go? I need to be somewhere.”
Sherlock,” John finished for her.
The more he saw, the more he was convinced there was some confusion about the rent. The flat was quite big, almost eighteen hundred square feet, and had a balcony where the sun shone whenever it was around. There were two bedrooms with attached bathrooms, a smaller room (that Sherlock had happily converted to his lab, John noticed), a kitchen and dining space, a small storage room and of course the spacious sitting room where Sherlock was currently parked. Both bedrooms had enough closet space and leg room besides the bed and dresser. In fact the bedroom, bathroom and closet John saw was roughly the size of the entire bedsit he was currently bunking down in.
Again there was a period of silence.
. But he couldn’t say those words out aloud.
“You don’t expect me to thank you for doing something that even you shall be a part of,” Jim said rudely, “Now go get me a nice Hazelnut Cafe Latte with almond biscotti and oh yes, get me a bottle of still water and some mints too.”
Sherlock entered the room and gave her a cross look, “Tea, now!”
Why? How? In which way?”
They both began to laugh at that, John a bit nervously and Mike giving a full belly-laugh, until someone popped their head in through the door to check what was going on. John immediately grew sober while Mike welcomed the person, a young woman in her early thirties, into the lab. “Come in Molly, meet Dr. John Watson, former military captain, a surgeon who might join us very soon, as soon as next week. John, this is Molly, pathologist and a good friend to all, she’s Miss Popular here!”
As he stepped out of his room, armed with chloroform soaked handkerchiefs, a loaded revolver and also a stun-gun to help him tame the two brats, he met four people right at hallway outside, crowding around the living room door.
Mary exhaled, “I hope you’re not questioning my generosity or my emotions Superintendent, because neither of them can be logically explained. I did what I felt like doing, there’s no vested interest or anything else here. He had lost his memory so I felt sorry, that’s all.”
Mycroft turned to leave the room when he heard a feeble bleat from his brother. “Myc, wait.” He turned and nodded, “Okay.”
“Hello Mycroft?”
A newspaper article was published the following day. It was on the second page and a small one with not too many facts and details. The headline was quite appropriately put as
“But they are cousins.”
“Might happen with me, again” Sebastian confessed shamelessly, “I apologize in advance but I have found someone, a man of my dreams, and I have been too busy trying to figure out a lot of things, even simple stuff like how to live and breathe without him around.”
On one side was a neat row of garages. On the other side was a concierge’s office, plus quarters for him and his family and the security personnel who manned the gate. From one of the windows John could see a middle-aged woman cooking lunch.
My scream brought John rushing in and he hosed me and the pan and perhaps the entire kitchen down with the extinguisher. Suddenly I was covered in foam and John got a bit of the foam on him too.
The dark figure entered the premises and reached the house in just six minutes. Carefully avoiding the camera at the front door, he went to the side of the house, right beneath the window he had trained his eyes on. Using very sophisticated equipment he lassoed himself against the sturdy branch of a tree and climbed up to the window level, then anchored himself to the edge of the parapet and swung over to the window like a monkey. He almost lost his foothold but managed to hold steady before an evil smile came on his lips. No need for a glass cutter, no need for a break-in, a window was slightly open.
“Then I am saying ‘no’ now. Don’t play with words. Go and get some sleep and this time….no, no, not here, in your room and your bed! I will be locking my bedroom door this time. I have to sleep well the night before surgeries or I might end up cutting off some vein and bleeding the patient to his untimely death. I am sure you don’t want such a mishap and see me lose my license as a surgeon, right?”
He stood there, half way between the area leading towards John’s study and the library on the other side, unsure of what to do or what to say. For the first time in a little over three months he wasn’t even sure of his welcome in this house. Eckhart stood right behind him, like a sentry, guarding his routes. It hurt Sherlock to think that he was being treated like a thief or some intruder, as if he’d escape into parts of the house and touch objects that should be inaccessible to him. He tried to read John’s face but it was stony and stoic, there was nothing he could figure out from that visage. But one thing he was sure. John’s feelings for him had changed and it was definitely not for the better.
“Fuck,” John swore, thrusting into Sherlock’s fist as he felt his balls tighten, “Faster now baby.”
Sebastian’s thoughts were interrupted by Jim’s moaning tapering off and then a whine coming out of him instead. “What-What’s the matter?” Jim asked softly, a bit disappointed and mildly alarmed by the sudden change in his lover’s mood and body language, “You’re slipping out of me Sebby. You’re not hard enough…..!!!” Sebastian quickly pulled himself together and smiled at him, “You had sucked my brains out through my cock less than half an hour ago, hence I am a bit…. You know. But don’t worry, you making me hard is never a problem. I love you so much babe,” he used his fist to shove his dick back into the snug and warm hole that closed tightly back around him. It was a bolt of pleasure he needed and his cock jerked, blood flowing back into it in no time. Sebastian moaned with satisfaction and as Jim clenched his arse further, his eyes snapped open in alarm. He was suddenly too close, way too close!
John rolled his eyes, “What a thing to ask! Of course I do. But I am not sure they’d want to see me on Christmas or anytime soon. They must be very upset with me and the way I had treated you. Mycroft to this date does not talk to me or take my calls. He works with Mike Stamford and that too after a written apology from me and a generous dose of emotions, recalling how close our fathers used to be in their lifetime.”
Then Sherlock’s keen eyes fell on the turkey.
“I-I need some air, I am…..Mrs. Hudson, this dinner, if I am….not myself….please forgive….me.”
Jim let out a giggle and turned it into a cough, plastering himself against the broad back of his lover. He had not cum yet and was raging hard, almost ready to shoot, yet he held on by the skin of his teeth for Sebastian to enter him before he could allow himself that liberty. “Oh no, you aren’t the only one,” he confirmed, “I can hear them too, loud and clear. They’re quick. They reached even before we did, huh?”
March!”
“Don’t have to. I’ll open an account in Citibank, where you and I will be join-account-holders. This cheque goes right there. That’s why I asked them to name us both. Let’s build your fortune elsewhere, not through those Mycroft-curated accounts. Only thing, you trust me right?”
“Makes sense, that’s brilliant,” Sherlock agreed.
“Yes, I am the same person sir.”
“Well, well, well, we saw a curious case of ‘loooove at first siiiiight’ today, didn’t we Phillip?” Sally commented jocularly as they sat for dinner at the hotel they were staying in. It was takeaway Chinese and they were all in Greg’s room. Phil had got hold of some beer and it was a nice cozy evening at the comfortable and clean hotel; their favorite country music on, nice food and the company they were used to!
“Who are you? What the fuck do you want?”
“There,” she said with a grin, “You got it.”
“Yes, that it is. I agree they are young lives. But lives have been lost. We mustn’t forget that. We must remember that we don’t have a lot of time. If we don’t take action now, death will do a rumba here in this village over the next week.”
Sebastian’s eyes widened to extremes and he stood there, watching John with a dropped jaw. John was always the slightly conventional, ‘watch your mouth’ types. For him to be so loose-tongued and free was incredible. He had to be deliriously happy to do this, to let his guard down. “Hahahahaha!!!!” John burst out laughing. Sebastian joined him in that merry laughter, equally amused, “Hohohohohoho!!!!!”
, Sherlock thought as he confidently strode to the pool house.
“Hi Daphne,” Sherlock greeted Mrs. Moriarty, Jim’s mum cheerfully, “Is Jimmy home?” She smiled and nodded, “Yeah, in fact he’s in a bad mood. Still in bed, refused breakfast. Go and talk to him and wave your magic wand.” Jim’s sister Siobhan walked past Sherlock, “I am off to work.” She used to work in town, drove there every day and often stayed back in a flat the family owned there or with her boyfriend who was also her coworker at the insurance company she worked for. “Sherl, I have got the package you wanted me to fetch from town. I have left it on the side table over there. Don’t forget to take it before you leave!”
“I told you,” John said a bit irritably, “He is a different kind of person, not easy to understand.”
John ignored the face Sherlock made and started to feed him the soup, explaining why he needed something in his stomach as he was drugged up to relieve pain or the possibilities of infection. After some initial protests Sherlock went alone, but he was messy and John had to threaten putting a bib on him like one would do to an infant. Sherlock in turn explained the case to John who asked him a few questions, prompting Sherlock to be Sherlock and answer with the usual ‘Not easy for an ordinary person like you to grasp it but I’ll give it a shot’. The easy camaraderie continued until the bowl of soup was near empty and John had managed to feed him a small slice of bread as well.
“He giving you trouble sweets?” He asked Jim, touching his cheek.
“Fucked up more like it. Now let me tell you how he got the money.”
Siblings aren't always pests, sometimes they are wingless angels!
After two weeks Sherlock felt so restless he was unable to sleep properly at night. “Find out what’s happened dear,” Mrs. Hudson advised one evening as she cooked dinner and Sherlock folded the laundry.
It was huge, just as large as John’s was, and had attached dressing room, spacious walk-in closet, en-suite bathroom and a store room as well! The whole place had the usual trappings of wealth and elegance but what stood out was the quirky décor, like wooden masks and hand shaped vases, and a wall filled with family photographs. Above the wall hung the lady’s photograph and one look at it confirmed what Sherlock had expected all along. She had been the soul of the party and the fizz to the champagne, with her departure this house had begun to lack both a soul and a fizz, the electric presence of someone who could hold it all together in spirit, not just the basics.
“That’s why I am doing this,” John explained, his look and stance almost non-negotiable, “So no one ever dares to call you a ‘swindler’ or a ‘gold digger’. You will have as much as I do and that means there’s no need for you to take anything from me, aside from my love for you as a partner and friend. Alright, then comes the next decision and that should make you happy. I have decided to give everything that was in mum’s name, amounting to almost nine hundred million, to Harry. She deserves it. She will be reluctant to take anything that belonged to dad or me or dad’s side of the family but anything that was mum’s can naturally pass on to her. That includes the chest you kept in the closet.”
“I shall get you meds to ease that off,” Sherlock suggested, “Why suffer when we have so many quick and good remedies. The doc did say such aches are common and I remember you didn’t have any for almost a month. Now suddenly again…..” John didn’t hear the rest as Sherlock’s voice faded into the background and he went into their room to fetch the medical kit and some water. In the distance he saw the lights of the nearest village. The lake was also illuminated well, as was the foregrounds and pier of the hotel. A small group of holidayers were singing and chatting around a bonfire. A couple of families and three couples were scattered on the lawns. Some of the terraced openings of the rooms downstairs also showed guests either lounging on recliners or laughing and joking animatedly.
A week passed and Sherlock felt as if he was going nowhere. Not for lack of effort from his side though because he had tried his best to contact Jim and failed. The man’s cell phone was off and there were no responses to emails either. Not willing to give up, Sherlock had even taken a day off from the estate, telling John he needed to visit his ‘aunt’ and gone to the flat where Jim lived. It was locked and since it was his own flat, there was no landlord or lady to check with.
He had crossed the woods, gone past the ‘Peace Hill’ where the town cemetery stood and was now standing before a rather quaint-looking church with an equally pretty and landscaped grounds. It was not a very big church, probably could accommodate not more than a hundred to hundred and twenty parishioners, but something about the place made him
A bit taken aback, the two ladies followed until they were ushered into a storage room by the same nurse. In there stood two men, both flashing their Scotland Yard badges at them. “What is this exactly,” Molly stood protectively before her younger sister who looked fairly scared, “What have I done….. what have we done?”
“Was that good?” Sherlock asked in a teasing tone, feigning submissiveness. He knew what it did to John and he was spot-on as the older man growled out, “It was excellent but stop gloating, now it’s your turn.” Sherlock grinned and batted his eyelashes, thinning out his voice as he replied with, “Really daddy?” That was it, that was the moment John’s urges tipped his controls over and he attacked Sherlock like a hungry wolf who had got his first meal in days. Ravishing him thoroughly and lavishing attention on him to the point where Sherlock came without a single touch, then once more as John entered him with only minimal preparations. “Stop,” he wailed, “I can’t anymore….” But John was having none of it. “You started lighting this fire, now you put it out,” was his clear mandate.
Which they all did and finally John was taken upstairs.
“Jawn-Jawn-Jawn,” Sherlock chanted, moaning softly as he lay there, face down, limbs spread out like a starfish.
Cool wet towels were pressed to his forehead and his neck. John put several pillows together to help him half-lie, half sit against the headboard. “Thanks,” Sherlock panted, trying to rid himself of the remaining images from that horrid dream. “Want to talk about it?” John asked sincerely.
“We will check,” Greg said, “Gotta go now.”
“Ummmhhh!” John groaned with pleasure as Sherlock’s inner muscles gripped his manhood even tighter, the younger man gripping him harder with his long, flowing limbs. John suckled on one of Sherlock’s nipples before lavishing attention to a particularly sensitive spot on the long column of his neck. He was floating in bliss, caught in that space where he wanted release but also didn’t want the journey to end, not so soon. Of all his favorite things in the world, being inside and on top of Sherlock was what he craved the most. It was so intimate, it felt so good, so honest, true and beautiful! Words couldn’t express how awesome his life had become since Sherlock had stepped into it and
John snorted, “I still figured you out.”
John remained quiet for the longest time before he nodded near imperceptibly and whispered, “Karma will get to them long before they have finished their journey. You are right, I won’t be the one to stir a hornet’s nest. It’s not worth our effort and the risks it involves.”
“Here you go,” Greg handed the man a large cup of herbal tea, “My favorite, the best for nights like these when it’s neither warm nor cold and you need to stay awake for just a little longer.” Jim accepted it and sipped the tea, showing a thumbs up sign before he relaxed in the armchair he was sitting on. He was a very pretty man, in a non-conventional way though. Instead of being the male stereotype of tall and ripped or at least of reasonable height and athletic build, he was of medium height, hardly five feet eight inches, and slender build. But his svelte frame reminded Greg of gymnasts and ballet artists. His hairs were dark and thick and lustrous but his widow’s peak was a bit too large. His features were soft and his eyes large and luminous.
“Is that so?”
“Just outside the train station.”
“Please, if you love him….”
“My clever little cookie,” John giggled and they kissed again, irrespective of their growling stomachs the first attention was given to the morning wood that each man was sporting down below. Sherlock began to hump John and John had just started to thrust up, bringing their straining erections delectable friction by constant rubbing and frottage, when the door opened and in walked Mary with a trolley heaped with various food items. She gasped, screamed and turned around, then scuttled out like a frightened rabbit without even a backwards glance. Before the door closed she called out ‘Next time lock the door you shameless insatiable men’.
“College friend, Emily McGivern. Her husband was missing. Found him there, under influence. Figured out who was doing this, a cousin of his who knew of the will of their grandparent, which gave everything to Emily’s husband but it would pass on to that cousin if he were to do drugs or go insane. Insanity was not easy to induce so that sneaky bastard tried to get him addicted. I solved the case, it was for a friend and I knew you wouldn’t like to go there, so….”
“We can?” Sherlock’s eyes glowed, “That means you will be coming with me for a swim? We will race each other?”
“I didn’t get you.”
On her insistence he accepted the package and started opening it carefully, trying not to look took eager or too disinterested. The situation was becoming unreal now. He was accepting a gift from the mother of his housemate, who was
“Oh you have a problem if I stay quiet, you have an issue if I talk, then suddenly I am talking too fucking much,” Sherlock gave it back with equal annoyance and irritation in his tone, “Did I ever ask you for anything other than….being there for me, being the only friend I have. Remember Dartmoor, where I told you I don’t have many friends, I have only one…..and-and I am aware I am not an easy man to live with but I try….I do try, I have changed and I can change….but what sort of friendship do we share if you keep things from me. She is someone you’re serious about and I am just…..clueless about it. I hate being in the dark.”
“Alright, I am neither sorry nor thrilled,” Sebastian said in a matter of fact manner, “Let’s just get back into the vehicle, shall we?”
“He didn’t buy any of these, did he?” Eugenia asked, looking pointedly at John. Reginald immediately stopped her, “It doesn’t matter who bought it. They are one unit and the gift is from both of them.”
. Exactly 33 days from now.”
“Thank you sir.”
“Heartbroken?” Sebastian seemed a bit puzzled, “No, why?”
“Jesus, Sherlock!”
“I’m…. I’m cumming too,” Sherlock panted, clawing at the blanket and straw strands, “I’m cumming too, OH!!!”
for a whole week perhaps, I thought we could order in some junk food without any feeling of guilt. So I have called for an extra-large size pepperoni and extra cheese pizza with jalapenos, olives and mushrooms for company. Also made some tea while you were sleeping. Fancy some?”
“Huh?”
“Go ahead,” Sebastian said darkly, “Say the words.”
“Just now I accepted a ten grand advance from the next buyer. He will pay me eighty-five overall. What do I do about that?”
An awkward silence followed as Sherlock stood in silence and so did John, neither man knowing what to do. John had every reason to initiate the next step, which was to touch Sherlock, look into his gorgeous eyes and give him an indication of what was to follow, then close the door gently and give the waiter a subtle hint to leave them in peace for the next two hours. But whenever he tried something stopped him; whether it was his middle class values or his natural inclination towards giving his partner the space and time to be ready for intimacy, but he was simply unable to coerce or even coax Sherlock into doing something. Finally, out of sheer need to say something, he quipped, “There’s champagne and strawberries and some really nice French cheese. Do you want to go to the sitting room?”
“Don’t worry,” Molly grinned, “Johnny guide has the full list of things to do and places to visit. Just look at him and that list he has made.”
Greg was quiet for a little while. Then he folded the note and gave John a fond, somewhat emotional smile. “You know John, this is perfect. This indeed is your graduation and you graduated with flying colors. You have grasped the concepts, altered your behavioral patterns, put most of my lessons into practice and that too with remarkable success. I think my job here is done and you can take it on from here.” John flashed a profoundly grateful smile and grasped Greg’s hands, giving them a two handed squeeze. In a tone that reflected nothing but reverence, he said, “I couldn’t have done this without you Mr. Lestrade. I had no idea I could ever be confident, articulate or just stop being awkward.”
Sherlock spoke in a strange language with those men and they left, all of them giving him a glare each. John was boiling by then and he gladly glared back and reached for his gun symbolically, making them all back off and proceed towards the door, tails tucked between their legs. The moment he heard the front door shut, John flew at Sherlock and grabbed his collar, pushing him against the wall, their faces inches apart. Sherlock’s eyes widened for just a moment before he simply stared back at John, not a shred of alarm or any other emotion on his face. “What was the meaning of
As the figure came to the middle of the bridge he slipped and fell, thanks to the oil that had been poured on the road and sidewalk. Cursing, the man got up and was about to grab his briefcase again when the two thugs pounced on him. “We were waiting for you,” said one of them, trying to take the briefcase from his hands. But to their horror the man turned out to be a fighter. He punched him back and pushed the other one and sent him sprawling on the sidewalk, saying, “By now you idiots must have realized you made a big mistake attacking me.”
But I was right, all along.
Sherlock lifted his legs higher in the air and that move made John slide in even deeper. The inner muscles tightened around his cock and he grunted loud, supporting himself on his strong arms and rising above Sherlock for a moment.
“Never. Cross my heart and hope to die. You will be treated like a prince that you are Jimmy!”
John pushed in harder, picked up speed, thrust faster and faster. All through he kept his eyes on Sherlock’s face to watch his expressions, if even a tiny hint of discomfiture showed up he would hold still. But all John saw there was bliss, sheer and utter bliss and a desire for more, still more. Overwhelmed by Sherlock’s responsiveness and amazing sensuality, he allowed the feelings building inside him to reach a crescendo.
Sherlock was glad John was at least talking to him finally. Five rounds of sex later, Sherlock had already cum three times and was barely awake. He managed a feeble smile and said, “I’m fine. A bit sleepy and somewhat hungry but fine.”
His body jerked forward and he found himself pushed over the table, cheek mashed against the smooth surface of the polished granite, arse draped over the edge as John began to move in and out of him. “Sorry.I.am.truly.sorry.but.I.can’t.stop.It.seems,” John rasped out a word each between thrusts and pulls. He had one of his hands against the back of Sherlock’s head, keeping him there, while his other hand was on Sherlock’s cock and fondling it. Slowly the detective felt himself grow into full hardness and his engorged muscle twitched between John’s fingers. The older man snorted, “So you want it too, don’t you? You like my big fat cock inside you private, come on, answer me, it’s an ORDER.”
“This is hush money,” Sherlock replied.
“Shhhh, shhhh, shhhh, they will hear you and if they do they will know I was here. You must not tell anyone I was here. Nobody means nobody, not even to your friends or anyone else you know. Trust no one, remember, trust no one. Don’t go to isolated places. Remember, your lives are in very, very grave danger!”
known. Initially you may not have been sure but maybe over the past six or seven months it’s become such an integral part of your life, you can’t do without it, without
John nodded and smiled, “Yes, tomorrow is fine. As for my address, don’t worry about that. You don’t have to go looking for me. We will meet tomorrow, right here, beneath this sign post, at 1 am sharp. And if you are game we can even go watch a movie!”
,” he said as he binned the various paper cups, plates, disposable spoons and other items strewn around the kitchen and sitting room into a large garbage bag, “You threw a remarkable dinner party and only cooked the rice!”
John wondered what this man fantasized about when he pleasured himself. Sherlock in the meantime was as red as a ripe strawberry and had covered his face with his arm, squirming under John’s amused yet fiery gaze.
“He’s here,” Sherlock made a face but his eyes sparkled, which showed how happy he was.
“But this is vintage, classic, very rare, you told me you’ll never ever part from it. You can’t buy this in the stores or online, it is a precious collector’s item, nearly a hundred years old.”
John nodded. There was nothing for him to say except agree. It wasn’t as if he didn’t know all this, just that nobody had spoken aloud about it.
“Yeah. It was him.”
Sherlock was riding John hard, the entire tent shaking from their movements as John kept thrusting up again and again into the moist snug heat he was buried in. Sherlock’s arse was the best thing he had ever experienced, snug and gripping and always caving in to his thick girth, accommodating it like an eager but virginal pouch.
“I have a spade in my toolbox in the boot,” Sebastian offered, “I’ll dig a hole under those trees there, wear some disposable gloves from the medical kit John carries and carry that thing there. I guess we shall bury it.”
The lights began to strobe.
Several hours later, John woke up with a jump. For a few seconds he was disoriented, then he sprang out of his bed.
“I…. I want to be a doctor…. I mean, I already am….” John stopped, looking a bit coy and awkward, “You can laugh at me now.”
to them.
“Sherl, o Sherlooock, baby boyyy?”
“Imagine, the diamonds were hidden in the turkey, the roast turkey,” John giggled, unsteady on his feet but trying to keep Sherlock off the road as the lanky coat-clad man kept veering towards that side, “Diamonds worth like what……
He quickly went to pack his bags but before he even got to that task, he made a phone call to Dr. Mike Stamford. “Hey Mike, I have to go away for a couple of weeks to London with Mycroft. Please keep John at the hospital a little longer. Extra bills - I shall pay them when I return.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Jim said, trying to pet one of them.
Jim could not believe his eyes, he simply could not. How could this be? The very man he wanted to avoid was now standing right next to him, close enough for his heightened olfactory senses to even ‘taste’ him somewhat. Virile, earthy, fresh spring water, ice, firewood and petrichor!! Oh yeah, it was such an erotic, exotic combination. He licked his lips unknowingly, eyes on those electric blue eyes staring back at him bemusedly.
It’s Mrs. Hudson probably. I didn’t hear the footsteps but what the heck, it has to be her or Alan, the bright kid from down the street who does odd jobs for me. He hates tea, he won’t even touch that. Sherlock located the cannisters where John kept the chocolate chip cookies and the cream cracker biscuits and then a plate…..Then he heard a few words that pulled the rug from underneath his feet.
“Oh thanks John. Where’s Sherlock?’
“No, Jim is dating….” Sherlock started to speak, causing all three heads to turn towards him.
“Neither do I. But with the amount of investigations you have done on me, do we need to be so extra cautious. I am clean. I got tested three days ago.”
my own success brother,
“They will definitely get their dues, if not now then in the future,” Eugenia said, “Someday they will draw a boatload of bad karma on themselves and one day they will reach the end of the road, where there would be no escape routes, no way and no one to run to. Well, how does it matter to me? I’m just glad my son is alright now and ready to embark on the next phase of his life. Just stay this way, positive, optimistic and…. Maybe a bit more cheerful.”
John answered the door, his T shirt still stuck half way between his head and shoulders. “What’s the matter? Is your guy still asleep? Mine’s still in bed and we were having a romantic moment so this better be something important.”
“Oh I know her well and she knows me, she has seen much worse sides of me. If I am living here then she has to provide tea, breakfast, the odd coffee, sometimes some fruits, milk, mouse traps and cages.”
Sherlock moaned shamelessly and rasped out, “I need more than just your….fingers this time, please give me your……”
“From where I stand I can only see it as this – John Whoever-he-was, he got conned by someone or some people, saw this offensive photograph and probably was blackmailed or threatened using it. He thought this was the handiwork of the man in the photo and hence considers Sherlock as his arch enemy.”
“Y-Yes….”
Mycroft read faces well. He noticed one thing instantly.
He parked the car at the usual spot, dropped the keys with the concierge since the renting company would send someone over to pick up the vehicle early next morning. John didn’t really need to make an early start the next day of course, it was merely an excuse he’d made up to ‘not stay’ at Mary’s house overnight.
Molly was a bit mousy looking but she seemed like a nice, pleasant person and smiled broadly at John. He decided he’d like to meet a hundred Mollies every day because she seemed like a non-threat, someone helpful and kind. No wonder she was a popular, well-liked person.
He grinned, saluted her and did so, getting comfortable on his chair by sliding backwards. “So then,” she prompted, mixing the cake batter expertly in the baking bowl, “You were saying something to me?” Sherlock shrugged and said, “Yeah, you are so right. I
Realizing that Sherlock wouldn’t take the first step, John pulled him closer and clasped his face in both his hands. A few seconds passed and then, before they knew it, they were kissing.
Sherlock groaned with pure pleasure when John pulled him flush against himself and the younger man’s clothed erection touched the blonde’s taut abs. Instantly Sherlock began to hump him, eager to relieve some pressure there.
So, later that day, Sherlock found himself heading towards Magnussen, Stamford and Watson – Modern Art & Designs, Corporate and Premium Gifting. He had been there once before so he knew where it was. Even the first time around it hadn’t been too difficult to find it as it was located in the prestigious business hub of ‘20
“Yeah Jawn, I am better than ever,” Sherlock answered truthfully, “You made me forget it.”
Fortunately at that late hour no one appeared. Servant quarters were in the basement, most of their work was on the ground floor and bedrooms were on the first. The second floor, or the third level of the mansion, usually remained deserted post dinner. All the rooms were kept closed for the night. “Hello Jimmy,” he whispered again, slightly louder, “What’s with all that awful noise around you? Are you partying??!”
“What the…..”
The sounds didn’t continue. They stopped abruptly.
John literally had tears of joy in his eyes as he dropped the ‘toy’ and took Sherlock in his arms, kissing him deeply. Sherlock made a soft purring sound and whispered, “I’d still prefer to be your man though, nothing against women but I don’t think I can do this everyday.”
“You think?”
“Yes. He has divorced his first wife and taken on a second. The first one took him to the cleaners and the second one has accumulated debts. He also has illegitimate kids, two from former mistresses plus three from the previous marriage. Then this new, young wife has a child from an earlier relationship that he’s adopted. In ten years his life has changed completely. He is no longer the carefree and cheerful bachelor he used to be when he joined us at twenty-eight. He is broke, steeped in debt and alcoholic.”
“A GUN? HOW?”
The whole situation had turned on its head by then. From extreme annoyance and frustration, John was now feeling energized and motivated to explore, to find out more about this exciting life. It was so much cooler to share a flat with a sleuth than with a scientist and forensic expert. The danger seeker in John felt stimulated and his soul, long buried by the injury-driven retirement from the forces, got a sudden lease of life. “So then this case,” he said, pouring himself some tea, which Sherlock noticed with a smirk, “You are surely not investigating the death of a pet dog. That’s not the real case. You feel there is something else that’s being missed there, am I right?”
“You said ‘we’. That clearly means you dine with someone else now. And if someone is dining with you so late in the evening then that means they live with you too. Or at least, that’s what they have been doing lately. Tell me Johnny, have you found someone to share your life with? What does Mary feel about them…. Him…. I am assuming you have found a man this time.”
Jim looked away, “I am busy. I gotta go. Sometime later.”
Sherlock sighed, “You are right. Mary asked me for this. But now I know why she did and even I am convinced your place isn’t there. I am 100% sure you come from a very solid, educated and perhaps sophisticated background. The shelter is not for someone like you. You won’t be happy there. You’d be frustrated and upset most of the time. Look, it’s a charitable home. Partially funded by government funds but mostly by private donations, we don’t exactly offer a lot of comforts there. Only necessities. Not a single luxury, not even an internet connection.”
“C’mere.”
John entered him with a long and smooth thrust and Sherlock’s body welcomed him in like a sunflower welcomes sunlight or moths wish for a flame. A thousand sparks were lit throughout his shaking, shivering body and Sherlock started to moan louder and louder as John shamelessly pounded into him, shaking them both and the bed with every thrust. Soon John’s grunts also grew louder, almost animal like and his strong hips and thighs connected with Sherlock’s eager and overheated groin and thighs, the passion of their lovemaking causing him to babble and go into a frenzy he had not known before. His mind palace shut down and his brain went on a hiatus as it melted from the heat of their love.
“Sodding jerk,” Janet echoed.
“Apologies, she is not usually so rude,” the sales clerk explained, “But she is an animal lover. One of those who would save an alley cat but not feed a hungry man at her doorstep. Some of these oldies have their oddities but really, she means no harm.”
His hand slid down the loose waistband of Sherlock’s pajamas. John gasped with lust.
Greg Lestrade knew the two sergeants were loyal to him, almost to a fault, and were mostly efficient with their job as well, but he couldn’t just stand there and hear insults thrown at his friend. “I know he is difficult to get along with and sometimes it’s hard just to be cordial towards him,” his voice was authoritarian and the two immediately backed off, “But he is a genius, a man who is one in a million when it comes to intelligence and analysis. As a criminal profiler there is no one better than him and as an investigator he is perhaps one of the very best I have known. His powers of deduction are awesome. Maybe it’s good if you guys learn something from him instead of just criticizing him.”
“Very well then,” Jim’s eyes had a glint from the evil plan forming in his head, “That is precisely what I shall do then. Harry the spy won’t even know how he got trapped and be left cursing his luck and also perhaps….. us. But who cares? The vultures curse and scream while the camels cross the desert without a care!”
“Yes sir, I do. I was going to show you or maybe I was expecting you to notice it on your own. Remember the photo I snapped when you were jet skiing in our lake? The same one. I framed it and kept it on my desk at my home office. My cousin is welcome to walk around the house an enter any room, aside from my bedroom of course. So he must have gone in and his companion might have spotted your photo.”
For some time he just stood there, shocked beyond his five senses, the gifts rolling on the floor next to his shoes. Up ahead inside the bathroom was the ghastliest sight he had ever seen, not even in any films he had watched had he come across something so gory.
. Sherlock was not content to have exposed the killer, he wanted to save two people in his custody and also take him down personally.
A housekeeper answered and ushered them into one of the home offices where a handsome, really tall and blond man with blue eyes and a dazzling smile greeted them in a friendly manner. “I am Sebastian,” he said, “How can I help the Scotland Yard?”
Sherlock grabbed John’s hand, “You were in my brother in law’s grooming and social engagement classes? That’s why you were missing for a month?”
Sherlock didn’t argue and went straight to the refrigerator. He knew his mummy would have some food stashed away in the fridge but when he searched, he was quite taken aback to see those missing. The chocolate cake, the wraps, the Scotch eggs, all gone. Did the already fat Mycroft stuff himself with that much food or was he planning to have some sort of party in mummy and daddy’s absence?
When she saw his hesitation she added, “Son, the same way you have considered your house to be mine to live in for the rest of my life, I consider you my son and heir and hence this belongs to you. Accept it with the same grace and comfort with which I moved in here, more as a family member rather than a visitor or guest.
“Dasha no longer works here,” Ivan said dismissively, “We do not make Chicken a la Kiev anymore. As for Moscow Blitz, that’s off the menu today as persimmons are not in season and that cocktail requires the extract of persimmons.”
As usual getting Sherlock to agree on Christmas celebrations was a mammoth task. Fortunately for them, they had been invited to Sherlock’s parents’ home in Kent for Christmas lunch so nothing special really needed to be done on that day. Mycroft would also be there so it would be a nice family reunion. Mrs. Hudson was hosting Christmas Even dinner, so that day was also taken care of. All John had asked for was a tree and some lights and decorations for it, but even there Sherlock grumbled and harrumphed about how this made him feel so ordinary, as did the whole process of giving gifts.
Over the past week or so, Sherlock’s self-control had improved. From lasting two to five minutes, now he could last for at least seven to ten on the first round.
She gave him a meaningful look. “So he’s been doing the same thing for me, isn’t he?” When he answered her with silence she leaned closer and whispered, “He probably needs you more than you need him. I can be easily seen as a threat, which is not a great way to start a friendship. You need to assure him that nothing will change even though we are dating. Even if you move out, your friendship will remain intact, things will stay the same way between you and him.”
“Yes, I can apply and I will get it back.”
“Fine.”
“Mistake? How?”
Until a day arrived when Mycroft learned a lesson the hard way. If something had to be done,
Sorry to be away for almost a month and not answering several comments/emails. I underwent a major surgery to remove all my female parts and had to be on the recovery route for a few weeks. Back now, getting better by the day, hope some of you are still interested in the story. Missed being here and posting. Cheers!
, his reasoning told him and he instinctively stepped back, turning up his nose. He sniffed at the air, thankfully there was no foul or suspicious odor anywhere. With both distress and disgust in his tone he yelled, “Sherlock, come here into the kitchen and kindly explain to me what is the meaning of this?”
“Yeah.”
“It seems odder that you are dating Mary.”
If you have committed a crime then you must pay.
“Memorize” – Came the high command.
“Improper conditioning, decision-making power non-existent, general anxiety about other people’s opinions, almost painfully self-conscious and not at all self-aware. No confidence, very little display of energy and emotions, awkward and uneasy body language.”
“Oh, Mabel….Mrs. Mabel Willis, Mrs. Hudson’s elder sister,” John remembered their landlady talking about her, “You are the one who married a sailor who worked on a merchant ship, and you have traveled all the way to Vladivostok and Tokyo on that ship, long, long ago!”
Jim had got back in the car and stuffed his mouth and face on Sebastian’s crotch, inhaling the musky, manly scent deeply before mouthing the outline of his huge cock over his trousers. As a hot blooded man, Sebastian could no longer hold himself back. His hips started moving.
“Um…….”
He looked like a drifter. A thick beard, long shaggy mane, a face that was paler than the sheets around him and eyes that were haunted and bordering on the ‘crazy’, he sat on the bed with a bottle of whiskey in his arms, half-finished, and he drank straight from the bottle. All the drapes were shut, there were no lights on, the room was dark and dingy and had a stuffy smell. The smell of alcohol and sweat hung in the air and what was that…..
Jim put his arm around Sherlock’s shoulder and gave him a squeeze, “Hey, don’t do that, remember what we discussed about blaming ourselves. It won’t help, it will only cause more anguish, frustrations and heart ache. Anyways, think your sister and mam are wondering if we are about to become a couple???”
“Um….no, he has changed. That was nearly ten years ago.”
Silence was once again enveloping the room. All of them were staring at him, stunned. They could see why he called it the most difficult step to take. “And don’t you forget that you need to do this only when they are in half creature, half human form.”
“SHERLOCK WAKE UP!!!”
“He-He is invited?”
Naked, white, smooth and flowing limbs, a thatch of dark brown downy mane peeking between his legs, his mouth and chin smeared with red lipstick, his wavy wig hiding part of his flushed face, Sherlock looked like a sight to heal sore eyes. Sexy as a minx, a spicy saucepot one would die a thousand times to take a sip out of, his increasingly louder moans seductive as hell, John found it real hard to consider this helplessly aroused man bouncing on his cock was the same stern-faced detective who managed to silence ministers, officers and criminals alike, with his logic, sarcasm and threats.
, with the dirt-cheap accommodation, the well-paid job, the disability assistance sum sitting pretty in his bank and the average but decent pension amount also hitting his account every month.
“But how?”
“My family blocked you.”
John took a while to respond. Even when he did, the words wouldn’t come out. “Sherlock, it’s not just a fabricated story, right?”
“Hello Santa…. May I call you that?”
Thankfully Sherlock slept in less than ten seconds and John tiptoed out of the room without waking him. But as he lay down in bed,
John cringed. This man had no tact. Why did he have to get so graphic? But the worse was yet to come. When his parents said nothing, Sherlock perhaps felt he needed to prove a point to them and said, “I know they went for a vacation to Marbella, Spain, just the two of them. They have private Instagram, accounts, under fake names, and I hacked into them. They’ve shared pics of themselves sunbathing in the nude, placing sunhats over their……”
“Hear, hear,” he heard Mrs. Hudson say.
John lay on the blanket, grabbed Sherlock’s collar length curly locks and gave them a great yank, pulling him down over himself. Sherlock went without any resistance, giggling and moaning and already getting rid of their clothes.
There were only two slices of toast left so I put them in the toaster. Then I decided on microwave pancakes. This time I set the oven to the correct timings and temperature. Then I set about scrambling eggs and frying some bacon. Seemed simple enough till I realized one can only save one thing at a time and not the entire world. The smell of burning toast distracted me and I forgot the eggs and bacon, then as I was trying to resuscitate the toasts the frying pan caught fire and the bacon and eggs were gone. I tried to handle the situation but only managed to slip and slide on the gooey contents of a cracked egg on the floor (no idea how it ended up there) and my palm landed on a side of the hot pan.
He was walking back downstairs when he spotted Mycroft through one of the windows on the landing between two flights of steps. The big man was standing behind two cherry blossom trees in the backyard, now bare-branched due to the weather. Curious and in desperate need for a distraction, John decided to join Mycroft for a few minutes. Maybe he would tell John how he managed to fall for the Napoleon of crime.
They finished the task in about half an hour. The road they had taken was the main road connecting the town with the village and just five hundred meters after the bridge there was a culvert, which they had turned left from. This incident had happened about twenty five meters ahead on that road that led to the village. Naturally there was some traffic but only two vehicles stopped to take a look at what was going on.
right. You
William Sherlock Scott Holmes grinned at his friend, Victor Trevor, as they sat in the cafeteria of the posh private business school, London School of Business & Finance, where they both taught as professors. Sherlock taught business economics and marketing operations in the postgraduate classes, Victor taught finance to both post grad and management students. They had known each other for several years, during their days as Cambridge students and now as colleagues and professors at LSBF.
“Hey,” John caressed the top of his head, “Get into your clothes. Remember, you were going to help me write a few emails, inviting people like me to join hands and eradicate some infectious diseases that keep plaguing children in the second and third world countries?”
“Millionaire,” John corrected Sherlock this time and pulled his hand, getting him into the building where their flat was.
“Mmmm….!!”
On their way back, John kept staring at Sherlock in awe. What he missed was that whenever he looked away, Sherlock also stared at him in open admiration and delight. “So,” the doctor said, “I saw some miracles today. You identified the criminal just by the way he held his pen!!!”
But matters came to a boil when she questioned his choice of housemate.
“I know about the blog,” Sherlock said grumpily.
“Phil always seems to know what to do,” John said, “You suppose I will get there as well?”
“Jesus Christ. But… I know Eurus and Siobhan are in town but where’s Jim? He should have been here now.”
“Do you always listen to him?” Sherlock frowned and straightened his back, glaring at the former military-man who was glaring right back at him.
“Yeah, you have good choice,” Sherlock responded.
Mary was about to say something when John’s phone started to buzz. The moment John saw Sherlock’s call coming in, he grabbed the phone like one would grab a lifeboat the moment they felt their ship was about to sink. A smile spreading on his lips at the possibility of some juice case, he answered the other man eagerly. “Hey Sherl, yes, no of course not, yes, yes, oh is it? Hmmm, well, I suppose I can pick it up. No, I am in fact close to where he lives, no, not the car showroom. Yes, she is here. do you want to speak with her……” Suddenly John stopped, realizing how their situation had flipped on its head, “Um….she is busy, I think it’s best if I just go and pick that file up. Yes, of course, sure.”
“No problem at all. Thanks for lunch!”
Jim seemed a bit lost at first but he recovered quickly enough to issue a dire warning again. “I am warning ya you prized idiot, if you listen to me we will both come out of this smiling. We will be smelling of roses too. If you don’t bother to heed my words or warnings, go ahead show your foolishness. Remember, I won’t come to any harm. But I sure can let Dr. John Watson know he’s misunderstood you totally.”
“Excuse me sir.” It was the same waiter, Ivan. He was giving John a strange look. “Yes?” John asked, wondering if he had tipped too less.
“Demonstrate.”
Sherlock blinked. So many questions, an assumption packed in, clearly this man was trying to keep him engaged in a conversation. While he was flattered, he didn’t want to indulge John any further, for the blond man’s sake he had to cut it short and move on.
John went on, looking rather disgusted with himself, “I was such a bastard. I married a woman despite knowing my affinity lay with me. Reason, she was the only one who stuck around. Naturally I realized my mistake and yet I could do nothing to correct it. The only thing I could do was try and reverse it. I set her free but she was scarred forever. For me she was a support, for her I had been the love of her life. So she, who was a nurse before, chose to get herself a degree in business management and support me with my work, be my friend and live close by, in the same house.”
Sherlock let out a barking laughter that was very similar to the one John had let out on the day he had a showdown with Sherlock in his study. A dark, derisive, devilish laughter that showed he was a bit on the unbalanced side. Greg repeated his words, “Sherlock, you two could be together once again.”
“Oh…. Okay, alright.”
Sometime during the day he would text Sherlock and ask how he was, the reply would mostly be one word. ‘Bored’ or ‘Busy’ or ‘Reading’ or ‘Out’.
“Oh…. Wait, you mean to say all you do is share a train ride and walk to the college together and back to his place? He has never invited you in? You haven’t asked him out? Lunches? Movies? Weekend drinking? Shopping?”
“No, I don’t look at that way dear,” she said in a tone of sincerity, not a trace of contriteness in it, “I am not a vengeful and spiteful woman, I can assure you that! But while I am happy to see you two conquer challenges and find a common path ahead, you have to admit it’s not the easiest choice to see your ward go off and marry someone who is not only a stranger to you but also to himself. I don’t mean to spoil your day or mood son, but kindly think about the ramifications of not remembering your past life! Even if you were a hardworking, respectable and educated man with a good job or a brilliant profession, what if you have a family elsewhere from your previous life….. a partner, a wife probably… or a husband perhaps…. Kids, even? If you remember them will you decide to stay here or move back with them?”
“Pam where are the rest of your clothes?”
“Y-Yes Seb?”
“JOHN YOU ACTUALLY
“Had gone cold. So I took it downstairs and asked Hudders to throw it away. Why? You want?”
“Suddenly Ivor received the photograph you showed me, John and Sherlock, in that horribly compromising position. He didn’t tell anyone anything, he didn’t even talk to John. He just hung himself, left a note for John explaining he had found that pic and would rather John be happy with the man he truly loved. He had a depression problem and hence this pic had exacerbated his condition.”
“Seek, afraid, want, all out, scared…. Whatever that sentence meant.”
“He is, isn’t he?”
“John, oh, I didn’t hear you come in.”
John pulled him back up on the bed, “Don’t worry, even I am hungry as a wolf. I just asked for some food and some coffee and tea to be sent up. It’s seven am, a bit too early for us but I suppose we can make an exception for today. We really do need to eat.”
“Yes you sure were. Thank you very much Colonel. We shall take your leave for now but would be back if necessary. Hope you will cooperate again. Of course, only if that’s really required, otherwise we won’t disturb you. That’s a promise.”
“How about you?” John threw the question back at him. He didn’t have an answer. He would be lying if he said he didn’t, but at the same time it wouldn’t be entirely correct if he were to say ‘I am in a steady relationship with Mary Morstan’.
He saw someone or ‘something’ on the steps. “Hey there,” he called out, “You? Yes you! What do you think you’re doing there.”
Mary was a good woman, someone he shared common interests with, someone who was devoid of all drama and carried no baggage from her past life or relationships. She was clean as a whistle when it came to her image and reputation and her maturity belied the years she had walked on this earth. She was what someone would call ‘an old soul’, somebody who was calm and composed and yet perky and energetic when she needed to be. She was also incredibly okay with John spending time outside of work hours with Sherlock and gave him the space he needed. “I’d love to be the partner of a detective,” was what she said.
Sherlock laughed a bit nervously, trying to talk so his knees didn’t buckle or he didn’t end up hyperventilating. “Imagine how big the presidential suites would be! If the executive suites are this huge, those must be ginormous. Right Jawn?”
to change their ways, but you’re just behaving like an asshole who thinks it’s pretty cool to put his dick into two places at the same time. Well, I am not going to be your secondary orifice of pleasure.”
John knew how hot they looked. He closed his eyes and imagined himself watching the two of them, like a third person viewing them through a sheet of clear-glass. The sexy image formed in his head, his heartbeat sped up, his cock began to throb in the deep heat it was buried in.
At some point Sherlock whimpered and shifted and John stopped moving. But the detective showed no real urge or signs to wake up so a few seconds later the horny older man was able to safely resume his deep thrusts.
He paused and noted a significant change in Sherlock’s demeanor. Earlier the man was lost, quiet, uncomfortable. Now he seemed to be coming back to his cheerful elements. His body language suddenly seemed more relaxed, open and friendlier.
John sat down on a chair, then stood up, then shuffled his feet and sat down again. For some reason he felt rather ‘exposed’ before the lady, her self-assurance, graceful manners and composure was so immaculate that he felt like a fly buzzing before a swan. Sherlock was of no help in these situations, as usual, he was on his third cookie by then.
At first both of them appeared to be struck by lightning. They stood there, stock-still, expressions frozen on their faces, eyes wide, their body language suggesting a complete unpreparedness for this situation
Again Jim was startled and stunned into silence for a few moments. But Sherlock learned a hard lesson that day. He realized right after this that men like Jim were truly dangerous and they never gave up easily. For every failed plan A, they had a plan B and sometimes right up to a Plan G to boot. Jim grinned at him mockingly and said, “If I am not getting anything then so aren’t you. Unless I have the Woodburn Street condo, a little luxury abode of only 3000 square feet space with two-car garage below, I am going to make life miserable for you. Eventually that misery will also reach John and the poor idiot is already mentally weak and fragile. He will simply keel over with grief or toss you out on your arse….. something I am sure you deserve.”
Then he realized he was in the bedroom, but not on the bed. The hard ground beneath him was marble, not the earth and the soft cushion was that of a thick rug and not the grassy lawns. Of course there was no food anywhere nor was the mischievous Jim rabbit or Oz Mycroft. John had become human and had a human body right now and was laughing hard at him. Affronted and bewildered, embarrassed as well, he sat up and looked around. Everything else seemed normal. Okay, so it was a dream, a hilarious and impossible dream with Alice in Wonderland characters and the Hansel and Gretel ‘eatable’ house. “What’s so funny?” He asked John, offended at the way he was being laughed at.
“But I haven’t finished yet,” Sherlock shrugged.
“I am going out and you will NOT follow me,” Sherlock yelled, uncharacteristically emotional and loud, “If you do I will slash my wrists.” As if to prove he could do that, he picked up a sharp shard of broken glass and held it close to his right wrist.
Later when they dropped the duo at their home, Jim was still pouting and fuming and Sherlock had a sullen face. Once Sebastian and John had left, Sherlock and Jim stood waving at the retreating vehicle, then headed straight for the pine forest by taking the winding path that started about a hundred meters from their cul-de-sac like area.
“Oh thanks man, I knew I could count on you. So we are going to Northern Lights, right? Yeah, great, see you there at one-thirty sharp then.” Once again John got a live demonstration of how men like Phillip, when given half an inch, would easily grab a mile. Before he could reply or Sherlock could get back on the line, the cunning Andersen had disconnected. There was no other way but to be there, reserve a table for three and wait for the two men. Since they worked in the same place, they’d come over together. John couldn’t really say anything to that.
His heart kept berating him over and over again for abandoning Sherlock, for dismissing the fears brought up before him. He could hear Sherlock’s words the moment he closed his eyes and see that glum, sad face. “What if something happens to me during this case and you’re not around to help.”
John frowned, “Which group?”
“Or stop us from taking the clouds in our stride and believe that the sun is never truly gone. There’s always a new day and a new sunrise. Isn’t it? You won’t leave this time Sherl, would you? Can I ask for this as a Christmas present?”
“I-I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he said, wishing this conversation had never started. But this had to happen someday.
John nodded, still overwhelmed. Mrs. Hudson introduced herself and the staff and John barely managed to reply. He just kept looking around in awe.
“But they are directly in the line of fire, thanks to their blind affection and trust in those two they met and fell in love with at jet speed. Yeah, I mean Sherlock and James. They are the ones we need to fix and if John and Sebastian are not strong enough to do that, we will do it. I am going with at least six more people, guys who are used to facing unexpected adversities. They will do the needful and those two will not be damaging society and innocent people like Anthea anymore. Enough with this nonsense.”
“You’ve made a big mistake Sherlock,” Greg Lestrade said.
“Youdiiiiiiiiid!!!”
when you’re not punch drunk.”
Sherlock looked proud.
“Now I am going to open the picnic basket and you will open your shirt and show me how bad it is okay?” He asked with a smile and Sherlock nodded, doing as asked. “The lady who runs the inn kitchen got us a nice lunch,” John added with a satisfied smile.
For a few moments John had a comical expression of shock and bewilderment on his face. When he realized he was forgiven and all was well he relaxed visibly and when it dawned on him a moment later that Sherlock himself wanted to willingly take the next step, a huge grin broke through his visage. He let out a chuckle, shook his head with a relieved smiling before lunging at Sherlock and picking him up in his arms. “Ohh,” Sherlock clutched at his arm, surprised by how easily John lifted him off the ground and didn’t even break into a sweat, “I didn’t know…. You are so strong!!”
“Huhhhhhh!!!”
In the Victorian era, John gets invited to Sherlock's family home
“Jawn-Jawn-Jawn?”
The tall, curly haired and green eyed lanky young man rushed through the living room and up the stairs leading to the first floor bedrooms. The first one on the left was his friend’s, a room he had practically lived in from time to time along with his best mate. He opened the door wide and noisily.
Sensations swirled around in his brain and all too soon he felt the first tremors of his climax close in. He tried to withdraw but it was useless, he was too far gone.
Sherlock felt a strange thrill, almost double of what he had felt when he had heard of the murder earlier that day, at the sight of the priest….no, his name was John, John Watson. Truth was that this man had never left his thoughts for the past day and night. Never had a stranger cast such a spell on him. Sherlock had usually prided himself on staying detached and being cold and unruffled towards people. Heck, he was like that even towards his own family.
“Sherlock….Sherl, stop talking too fucking much,” John gripped his head, “You’re getting it all wrong man…..”
“Besides the studio, I have one more place to go to,” he muttered, “More avenues will open up and I shall bring the murderer to justice. I am going to find out about you John Doe, even if that’s the last thing I do.”
“People.”
“I would have,” Sherlock snapped at him, “If one answer was enough for you. But it apparently isn’t. You need to hear it several times from me or maybe you just don’t wanna believe me but want me to keep repeating it. So here goes, one more time, we are doing The Right Thing.”
As a sated, sticky and sweaty Sherlock passed out on the bed, the older man cleaned him up and tucked him in and watched him sleep for a full hour. “I am just very, very happy,” he murmured and lay down afterwards, pulling a snoring Sherlock lovingly into his arms.
“It’s another neighbor,” John apologized to the annoyed man with his eyes, “Mr. Whittaker. He is just short, he’s not a kid.” Sherlock immediately added, “But
“My name is Gregory. Second name Lestrade. You can start with Mr. Lestrade. No need for this sirring. I am a bit squeamish about this.”
He paused and Mrs. Hudson grabbed his arm, “Greg, is it really a murder or an accident?”
Sherlock smiled nervously. He pretended to be happy and relaxed but inside he was far from so. He swallowed repeatedly, trying to lick his lips to prevent the dry syndrome there, but it seemed like he had no spit at all. everything Phil had told him was slowly coming true. It was unfolding before his eyes like a nightmare that was too dreadful for words. For him honesty, noble intentions, compassion and empathy and being true to his mate was more important than anything else, success and money included. If a man had no values, if he didn’t care about how the others felt, then no amount of money or professional laurels could redeem him.
“Sherl, meet my second cousin once removed, Sebastian Augustus Moran."
But what about Jawn? I didn’t get to see him this morning and now…. Well, I guess I have to tell him we will meet again in two weeks. “Very well,” Sherlock relented at last, “I’ll go with you.”
“Oh, you’re cumming….”
John chuckled aloud.
Thankfully, Sherlock slept almost instantly. John waited for a further five minutes before he tiptoed to the bathroom, closed and bolted the door, ran the water in the sink and then jerked himself off to one of the best and most explosive orgasms of his life.
Later, after Sherlock had finished the phone call and was assisting with the final stages of preparing some mulled wine, John came back home with a huge smile on his face and a radiant, chirpy demeanor that suggested he was very happy.
“Yes Eugenia?”
“Hey, hold it you two,” Mycroft emerged from the car, frowning and, for a change, taking Sherlock’s side, “We didn’t know where you were speeding off to so no need to call my brother any names. Yes, I appreciate the rush and the situation you are in but that is your job Ms. Donovan and I am sure you don’t want to cause more deaths en route to a destination to investigate one murder.” This stern rebuke made Sally a bit more respectful towards Sherlock and she nodded towards Mycroft in acknowledgement; but she didn’t offer a ‘sorry’ or any form of apology to Sherlock. In the meantime Greg quickly joined them and toned things down with his mature approach.
“We???”
John could not get Sherlock out of his head that evening and night. All those things he had guessed about John, the littlest details to the overall situation of his life, kept coming back to him over and over again and the doctor got more and more curious about his soon-to-be housemate.
A car came up the path. It was not a path used by anyone besides the residents and their usual visitors and naturally all their vehicles were familiar to their eyes. The one that drew up was a new one though, a bottle green colored smart convertible with its headlights on. Behind it drew up a second car, a sporty two seater, also on high beam. Jim and Sherlock looked into the lights and quickly gazed away, afraid that their glowing eyes would give them away. Then they heard the familiar voices of their fathers and relaxed. “Hey sonny, whatcha doing here at this time, so late?” “Hello boys, so you get to see the new toys first and foremost, there goes our chances of surprising you!”
That was when he had seen it.
Eventually Sherlock didn’t eat any supper or dinner. He went to bed early, kept his clothes on and put a mountain of pillows between them. He also mummy-wrapped himself in the blankets and stayed as far on the bed as possible from John. The good doctor, already sporting an erection again, came into the bedroom after brushing his teeth and almost yelped at the sight. “What the hell is the meaning of this,” he demanded, hands on his hips, “I want to make love to you. Now get rid of all this and come to me.”
John gave him a puzzled glance. In the same confident tone Sherlock continued, “The job opportunity is not lost yet. Had it been so, you wouldn’t have even showed up. What they are doing is taking their time so you agree to their terms and conditions tomorrow, when they do offer you the position. I am sure the interview panel must have reacted in two different ways to you, one extremely positive and the other slightly confusing, negative and doubt-inducing?”
He hastily got up and sat on the edge of the bed, trying to collect his thoughts together.
“Ohhhnnnn,” Sherlock scrunched his eyes shut, grimacing beautifully with the need to cum, “Oh yeah, don’t stop.”
“Yeah,” Sebastian was ashamed of himself, shaking his head, “What the hell was I thinking? We need to go back and….. we don’t have a dagger, neither of us, right?” John shook his head, “No we don’t. I left mine upstairs in the pocket of my jacket.” “I left mine in the car, his car.”
“Oh shit,” John went more balefully.
Sherlock smiled but somehow he didn’t feel convinced as he usually felt by John’s assuring words. That terrified look on John’s face had alarmed him. If it was a flashback of his former life, Sherlock was quite sure John must have seen some dreadful events.
, stop.
Sherlock grinned and whipped out his cell phone. “Let me call her right away. She deserves advance notice for this. She’ll be occupied all day today, taking her classes and mine.”
(See the end of the chapter for
, so are my parents. But their talents skipped a generation. Sherlock is the black sheep of the family John, he is adored and feared in equal measures. Okay, so we are not afraid of him but for him, we fear
“Jacob,” Sherlock turned to his lawyer, “Call the press. Call London and the higher-ups, file for a right-to-know-information document.”
“Oh….” The two parents turned towards Sherlock, looking baffled. Even for an eccentric little rabble rouser like Sherlock this was quite a huge thing. Mycroft snorted and shook his head, waiting for the younger sibling to take a whack or two.
, he thought,
John’s mock offended look turned into one of affection, “Cross my heart and hope to die.”
“Ah yes, the fair, that’s why we are going there at this time, aren’t we John.”
Finger food followed, butterflied shrimps and cheese and olive sticks, tiny halved quail’s eggs and chicken and mushroom puff pastries. Amidst all this Mary walked up to Sherlock the moment John had left the latter’s side and said, “Can I speak to you for two minutes, alone?”
“You have often donated, gifted, given away,” Mycroft said, “I am not surprised and since it’s not my money but yours, you don’t owe me any explanations.”
“What? Oh! You don’t remember! But that’s okay really. How are you?”
“Sometimes even slim, small built people possess superhuman strength,” Jim said, “It’s a fact that strength isn’t directly proportionate to the bulk, muscle or inches on a man or woman.”
“Sherlock do you have a minute?”
“Moriarty…..James Isaac Moriarty.”
Sherlock needed no second invitation and he swallowed over half of the erection in one smooth motion, tightening his lips so John could feel maximum pleasure. A grunt escaped John and he pushed in a bit more, grabbing at Sherlock’s hairs. The tendrils curled around his fingers and he let out another grunt as he moved a bit, pulling back slightly before pushing in.
Jim and Sherlock were, in several ways, very similar to each other. Often John wondered, when he was in one of those expansive good moods and forgiving moments, that had he met Jim instead of Sherlock he might have even fallen for the small, compact, svelte Irishman who was just as brilliant and just as unconventionally gorgeous as the great detective was.
“Yeah. In the pine forest upslope. He took me to some places which were….. simply enthralling. But none as breathtaking and thrilling as his presence, company and gorgeousness. You know John, the moment I set my eyes on him I knew this was the man for me. I have to be his and he has to be mine, there is simply no other option. I can tell you with confidence that I will NEVER marry anyone if this doesn’t work out.”
When the procedure finished, the doctor had an accomplished look on his face. “There,” he said nonchalantly, “Easy peasy! You will be much better soon. What? What happened? Something bothering you?”
Sherlock blinked, “What? What do you mean? How can that happen?”
As soon as they had left, Mycroft put his hand on his head and sat down heavily on a rock next to them. He was clearly shattered by what he had just heard. Greg was also wrecked by the prospect of having to deal with so heartbreaking a situation but managed to remain steady.
Mycroft had just heard the biggest shocker of his life and some of the things added up smoothly in his mind. Three years ago there were deaths. Jim and Sherlock were there. The previous two years the two of them had gone for vacations, work etc during that time and no untoward incidents had been reported.
“Yeah.”
“Greg do you think I can do this?” Sherlock gave him a pointed look as the car meandered through the long driveway, flanked by beautifully landscaped lawns and gardens on both sides, gazebos, fountains and koi ponds, with pretty walkway bridges over them.
Greg unfolded the note and read it meticulously. John’s handwriting was not too good so he wanted to type it, but Greg had insisted on a handwritten note instead of typed, to show a personal touch and the fact that John cared to make an effort. The result proved that John had indeed made an effort. While the writing was not pretty nor aesthetic nor artistic, it had been written slowly to make each letter stand out and the message behind those words was quite touching, even if brief.
“It’s okay,” Sherlock saw the beginnings of a hyperventilation and diverted the topic, “We won’t talk about that.”
“Quite a lot to take in, how?” John asked, brows knotting together.
“No, Christ, not at all babe. I am just tired and I guess this place is cramped, that’s all.”
and somehow that needed to happen. Hook or crook or look. He’d insist and persuade and coax if need be. Persuading was his second nature, thanks to the unique profession he had. He waited for the reply which came a good thirty minutes later. The answer was quite unexpected and rather disappointing when it finally arrived.
John turned towards the now-grinning butler and said softly, emotionally, “It’s alright Eckhart, you can leave us now.”
By the time John made him cum twice more, Sherlock had forgotten about Jim and all about being a virgin and preserving his modesty or chastity.
“I think we should talk about something else now, something other than
The killer’s body was now a shapeless mass lying in a pool of blood. He had become
Not that John minded, not with the pleasure he got from those few but really ‘hot’ encounters.
“J-Jawn…..”
Sherlock felt his chest clench in a painful way. Here was a man, trusting him blindly, giving him so much, and there he was, ready to betray his trust, lying to him, manipulating him and conniving all along. What kind of a creep was he? What kind of an arsehole had he become? Sherlock struggled to hold back his tears but John said something right after, which broke all his dams in an instant.
“John’s mum?”
“Johnny,” Elizabeth offered glowing praise, “That is excellent news. You can now directly oversee the work done at the hospitals and hospices we fund and the medical charities we support. Excellent decision.”
, the gate had been locked already. The sun had set half an hour earlier, it was nearly 9 PM and the light had faded to a very light crimson in the skies. “Too late,” he sighed, “We missed him. We better head back home.”
“Oh sure he did, he literally changed my life! Perhaps the best decision I have taken, ever. Also a special thanks to you for that. Appreciate it greatly man! See you later!”
“Sherly,” the voice turned towards sinister, the playfulness replaced by dark undertones, “If you’re
While all this was good and shiny, the people around Sherlock often came into Moriarty’s orbit and got themselves scared shitless or stunned speechless, depending on what the occasion was. What was even worse, sometimes Jim Moriarty loved to play games and did these things purely out of fun or because he was bored.
“Sure sir….”
“Fifteen minutes,” Sherlock said, rolling over to face John. He looked well-rested too. John’s head fell back on the pillow and he threaded his fingers through those dark curls, playing with them as he absentmindedly thought about the situation. Did this change anything? Of course it did. Once you slept with your best friend it was ruined….or indelibly different from whatever equation you shared with them before. John hoped it was different from now on but manageable. He didn’t want things ruined. They shared too good a thing to stop…..living together or working on cases together.
“Happy to see me?” John asked, “I am really here Sherlock!”
“Scotch eggs and fries on the side, your favorite,” John replied, “Fruit salad, beer, juice, tea in a flask and some popcorn on the side. Oh yes, tiramisu cakes, small ones. It’s a really loaded picnic basket, I must say.”
“He will also feel better about himself,” Rosalie added, “He was always brilliant in that field, he wanted to be a doctor from the age of three. Remember?”
“You have already been doing a few of these transfers, with your other legal counsel…..”
?” Sherlock looked closer, tilted his head to the left and right and then said, “Yes, it seems so Father.”
“I’m just…..”
Sherlock looked dazed still, “Yeah… I suppose so. Did you watch a porn film named ‘Santa’s Gift’ lately?”
“Take me there, show me, what is that?” John was puzzled but followed the man as he led him out of the dining room and straight up the staircase, towards the bedroom suites. But instead of taking him towards the bedroom he shared with Sherlock, the trusted retainer took him to the other wing, the same one where his mother and sister used to live. “Who opened this door, who dared to….?” John fumbled over his words, part angry and part shocked. This room was out of bounds for everyone barring himself. How on earth did Sherlock think it was okay to open this room and walk inside, as if he could change the decree issued by John?! A bit upset, he sulkily stepped inside the room.
When the teenaged Sherlock walked into the kitchen, he saw his elder brother drinking coffee. “Coffee?” He asked, raising an eyebrow, “What happened to the tea?”
“But what?”
“I think so.”
“The sunshine song,” John said as he held the door open, “It seemed silly back then but right now, the lyrics ‘You are my sunshine’ seem to have taken an entirely new meaning for me.”
“No. Wood-carving is of the things I like and I will restart that hobby soon. But that’s not why I am taking a rain-check for Sunday. On Sunday I have a
“But why would anyone want to murder Mary?”
Greg smiled with a look of disbelief on his face, “You’d….. Complain about me? ME?”
“I’ll give you back your throne.”
“This is too much….”
When senses returned to him, he gasped.
. What left a lingering impact on him was the way Sherlock smelled. Cigarettes, cologne, a sweet and spicy underlying scent that was Sherlock’s very own. “Yeah, well, okay, I get that,” he said and walked past the taller man, “I’ll go and meet Mrs. Hudson now.”
“My brother could have become a scientist or a scholar, like our parents,” Mycroft continued, “Or a government official like me, maybe our best agent here. He could have become an astronaut or a concert violinist or a startup wizard with a brilliant product idea. But he chose to be a jack of three trades. Cacophonous violinist/criminal profiler/sleuth. Working on his own, his aversion towards authority and discipline so huge that he is mostly disliked despite his work speaking volumes for itself. His eccentricity extends towards the way he spends his money and the way he spends his money also alerts me to what he’s up to. A big transfer to a certain someone…..oh I have to figure out whatever the hell is up with this mystery receiver, because he might be an African warlord masquerading as a pirate.”
John had told him he loved it there and naturally they had gone back twice to visit the place.
Sebastian grinned crookedly, “If this is the curse this place has, then I welcome it. To me this seems more like a spell, not a curse. I can’t stop thinking about him and that’s unusual, since I never felt like this before ever. No one could affect me so much, nobody. But that’s changed since the past 24 hours. I have changed.”
Polly came up to them, “Your lab is squeaky clean and ready. I have not touched the experiments or the jars, not have I touched your notes. Used the air freshener you both love and stocked the coffee and tea machines and mason jars of cookies and chocolates. Oh it’s so good to see you two get along so well.”
“I never said I want both of them…..” John held his head in his hands.
“Sherlock?”
“What is it?”
“I wanted to surprise him,” he said lamely, hoping to be believed.
Sebastian pulled his chair closer to Sherlock’s and loomed even closer by leaning in. Unaccustomed to taller, broader people, the six foot one inch Sherlock instinctively pushed his own chair backwards. “Stay back, don’t dare to touch me,” he hissed in warning.
“Harry please, you have no idea what’s happened to me and how I have suffered. I have been betrayed all over again.”
“Precisely. We have more to lose than they do.”
“A house. Modest three bedrooms, with a little space around it. Enough money to be financially secure and have an annuity even if she doesn’t wanna work in the future. Some jewelry, which is a gal’s best friend. A couple of cars, that she and her girlfriend drive. You met Alicia?”
“Sorry Sherlock,” John said with an apologetic smile, “I have a personal commitment on Sunday and two pre-scheduled surgeries tomorrow. If this can wait till Monday I am game.”
Sebastian shot down the stairs like a madman, stumbling and blinking, scared out of his mind and seeing stars around. He tried his best to keep himself steady but fell down the last three steps, landing on his ankle at a very bad angle. “FUCK,” he cried out, clutching at it, staring at the door upstairs that he had just come out from. It was closed still but from behind the wood he could hear the unmistakable noises of an animal and a human combined. His throat was dry and he tried to stand up, but the moment he took a step he winced with pain and collapsed on the bottom step of the stairwell.
“There is no reason to go slow either baby boy,” John said as he was helped into his blazer by Sherlock, “As soon as I am back I am calling my lawyer and also Greg Lestrade. We will tear off that contract and release you from it. My husband is not going to be bound to some contract or sign some stupid prenup. As for the properties to be transferred, it is a custom. Remember what my grandmother said to you? Whenever someone marries into the family we always give them their own wealth, so they feel like equals, so they are independently wealthy and can spend without asking for allowances.”
Rewards had been enormous, the trip had been excellent, the satisfaction of solving the case immense. On their return, the Baker Street Boys had decided ‘no cases for a fortnight’.
again but he had no clue yet about how his flatmate was about to send this situation into a downward spiral.
“Come in.”
“Come outside please,” said the man, “This is impossible.”
“Because a lot is at stake.”
Sherlock looked disgusted. “Let me introduce you to our domestic support system,” Eugenia announced, “This is head housekeeper Agnes. This is Ewan, her husband and also our groundskeeper, plumber and electrician. And that is Katie, she is our cook and apparently she can do some magic with food. Agnes, Ewan, Katie, meet my children…oh well, they’re grown up so meet my grown up kids, Mycroft, Eurus and that grumpy one over there is Sherlock.”
The colonel looked dashing, happy and very relaxed and easy. It was quite a difference from his army days or even those years spent as Moriarty’s deputy. The legit life suited him just as much as it suited his former boss. John commented on that and the mini-giant roared with laughter.
“You mean….???”
“The moment someone gives him attention he will do whatever they say. And none better than a gorgeous, clever woman like you. See if you can sell him that car. Yeah, THAT one. If anyone can buy that piece of junk it’s this idiot.”
Sherlock led John towards the bathroom, feeling like the one in charge for a change. Many times John had soothed and loved him after nightmares and other upsetting incidents, several times John had taken care of his needs when he was, well, a little needy or lazy.
