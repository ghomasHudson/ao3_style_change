The kicker of it all is omegas that run and own their own business are
Sam reaches for the door, slamming it closed before pressing his back up against it. Castiel just stands there staring at him struggling to brace himself against the door as he squeezes his extracted grace tightly in his hand.
Oh God. Is Castiel human?
burn and carve into Castiel’s skin while he screamed for Dean to help him will always haunt him, both when he’s awake and when he’s allowed to close his eyes to sleep.
angel – Dean realizes exactly why some of those stupid humans bartered away their souls for just a few more years to be with someone they swore they loved more than their own life itself. Because, at the end of everything, they did, didn’t they? And no one – not even Heaven itself – can possibly know how deeply he and Cas are both woven into each other’s lives. No, not even Heaven can understand the bond that’s been created between them. Hell, until just now, realizing he’s going to lose Cas for, possibly, forever, Dean hasn’t even realized it.
Even with all the knowledge he has and the doubt he carried about the blood fully working, seeing the last hope literally dripping off Dean’s fingers breaks him. Rage unlike anything he’s ever felt before fills him, and he charges at Dean, shoving him into the wall. He pulls back, punching him in the face just as Dean knees him in the gut. He barely reacts to the hit, but swings again just as Dean hits him in the side.
Besides that, the kid has never had any professor or doctor say anything negative about him whether that be in school or job. He’s always given it his best and always strived to go above and beyond in any way possible. If trying to help omegas in any way possible isn’t something important then Dean is at a loss on what Zachariah thinks they’ve been done with the ward all this time. Isn’t the point of science and modern medicine to help people? Research and discoveries happen every day in the scientific and medical world, (or, they use to at least) so why should now be any different? With all the new information Sam always seems to have to tell him, Dean knows that someone out there is doing something for the greater good.
It’s confusing, and if Dean could get a headache he figures he would probably have one. Instead of fighting it, Dean lets his eyes flutter closed as he lets out a breath, leaning his forehead forward against the mans.
“Then you know this probably isn’t the best idea trying to bring up everything that he just went through!” Keeping his eyes on Cas, the sound of his brother’s shoes squeaking on the floor closer to them is the only inclination he’s moved.
“Please, you hafta trust me, Cas,” Dean pleads one last time. “You have my word that nothing happened. I would never cheat on you! Ever!”
“Anyways,” Sam says clearing his throat and sitting up a bit more. “How are you doing?”
The alpha coughs, the flush across his cheeks spreading down his neck and across his chest. Huh, that’s not very alpha like. Aren’t they suppose to be assholes without a caring bone in their bodies? This one seems to be more open with his feelings than even the typical beta. Maybe that’s what’s going on. Cas is empathizing with him too much and it brought on whatever the hell this is.
“There isn’t anything I can give you! I don’t even know what’s going on. I – ”
"Maybe I wouldn’t have to lie if you just gave me some fucking space!”
“Right now,” Dean says between their opened mouth kisses. “Just feeling you is enough.”
Is he okay? Dean waits for the feeling of panic to hit him, but nothing comes. Just the tingling from the alpha’s touch that almost seems to be calling for the alpha. But more importantly, he recognizes for the first time since they’ve touched that his body feels almost incomplete without that touch.
“Crowley knew what needed to be done.” Castiel replies. “This isn’t you, Dean.”
His eyes follow Dean as he walks off to the side of him, slowly circling. His fingers go back to picking at the teeth of the Blade with his fingernails, looking bored with the whole thing. Castiel knows it’s just an act, trying to lower his defenses so the thinks he’s safe. Castiel watches Dean’s body language, making sure he isn’t about ready to react.
Right as he sets the mug down Castiel’s hand reaches out and grabs his right hand, flipping it over. Panicking, Dean tries to yank it back, but Cas’s firm grip just tightens as his other hand comes up and starts to skillfully undo the clasps on his cuff.
Closing his eyes tightly closed, Dean imagines for a moment that it isn’t some pretty blond with nice perky breasts swallowing him down, but an angel with dark perpetually messy hair and piercing blue eyes. His big, rough hands are digging into his hips, bruising him as he tries to thrust up into that wet heat. And, oh God, Dean wants him to leave bruises. He wants Cas to mark him up so he can show the whole world that he is his. Dean wants to use that sinful mouth to chase his pleasure until it becomes too much and then wants Cas to fuck him raw.
“How are you not dead?”
Sammy straightens his back and slowly stands up from the stool. Almost in the blink of an eye he watches as his brother’s face shift back into serious doctor mode. Sam walks beside the machine Dean noticed when he first walked in now realizing what it is – a ultrasound machine – and pulls out a bottle from one of the holders.
Dean’s seething. He’s beyond mad and never felt so fucking worthless in his life. Being omega he knew how low he was on the social scale, but hearing his brother just put it into a clearer picture – something that effects him directly – it’s…wrong. So unbelievably wrong it makes him feel physically ill. Not having any say in his physical body is one thing, in a way he’s gotten somewhat use to that, but now his own words are just as worthless?
“Told you I was his alpha,” Benny replies through gritted teeth.
“What the hell was what?” Dean asks looking over at his brother with the best confused expression he can dig up. Maybe it’s late enough that he can just play innocent. People have nightmares all the time and never remember them.
Dean can almost remember the exact day his life started to
Castiel had been true to his word and sent him a text after he dropped the promised bag off at his door. Dean will never admit it out loud, but he immediately stripped off his own shirt and pulled on the alpha’s. It was a little small, but Dean kind of liked how the tightness mixed with Castiel’s woodsy scent felt somewhat like a hug. The overall tension in his body literally seemed to melt away after being surrounded in the scent.  He ended up passing out with it on, a hoodie that looked like it had seen better days spread out over his pillow and cellphone in hand texting Castiel.
Comments and kudos give me life, loves! Let me know what you think! I love listening to theories.
“Listen Dean,” he continues, “I understand you want nothing to do with me, or any alpha. I want to respect your wishes, but what’s done is done. This is your life we are dealing with now, and as much as you want to keep your distance from me, I care about you enough to want you alive. I want…”
to be bound by time since neither of them
Castiel looks back at him with such sad eyes Dean’s heart feels like it’s breaking but he can’t exactly place why. The urge to throw his arms around Castiel and tell him how sorry he is over and over is so strong he can actually feel the pressure of the words in his throat. If only words held some sort of power to just make everything magically be fixed, he’d say it a million times if it meant never seeing that look over Castiel’s face again.
what they’ve been arguing about.
Over the first year since the virus Dean could barely stomach listening to any radio station or watch any tv station. It seemed filled with nothing but horrific updates on the deaths, rapes or attacks. Dean chose to wait to either see Sam for his monthly check ups, or a phone call if anything was pressing that he needed Dean to know.
Trying to ignore the way his heart clenches that Castiel is now not only able to feel cold, but is affected by it, he move into action. Not even wanting to leave anything to chance, Dean wraps his free arm around Castiel’s waist to help support him walking. Cas leans his body against his, his head slightly resting on his shoulder with a soft sigh. Dean lets a slow smile spread over his face as he squeezes Castiel slightly closer to him as they start walking.
Castiel closes his eyes, feeling a smile pull at his lips as Dean slides his fingers in between his. “Hello Dean.”
“The Mark is…changing you to fit its need-It’s want.” Castiel grips his hands into fists trying to keep his voice even. “The Dean Winchester I know would never harm a child willingly. I know he is still in there, and I will save him.”
Deep inside Castiel knows Dean is trying to cover up his pain with everything else but the truth, but he isn’t in the mood to play along, or beat around the bush. He’s tired. So, so, tired. He’s beyond frustrated with everything; the situation, the tension in every room he seems to be in. At the end of the day, it all boils down to him.
When he gets home, he calls Charlie and confesses what he did. She tries to talk him through, but he’s too distraught to really hear her, so he hangs up. Through broken sobs and half blinded by tears, he sends a message to Cas begging for his forgiveness, telling him how much he loves him, misses him and wants him back.
By the second year since the virus, their town has their first male omega in labor. It surprises everyone considering the man hid it so well no one knew. It surprises Dean even more because he thought he was the only one around.
“Even after all this time, I still remember what it was like when I held onto you,” Cas says muffled against his fingers still against his lips. “Your soul, it’s so bright – pure.” Cas drops his hand from his lips and looks over at Dean, this time holding his eyes. “Even in hell you were everything good, Dean.”
Where these moments are far and few between, their closeness hasn’t ever been anything more than for a reason to help the other one get somewhere safe because the other one can’t manage it on their own. It’s the harsh reality of their lives; a reality that comes back, covering Dean in a heavy weight that reminds him that what he may feel is wrong. Feelings – any feelings, really – are a weakness. That was one of his dad’s first lessons.
His mind if whirling with thoughts and images. All things he wishes he could either forget at the bottom of a bottle, as close to unconsciousness as possible. Coming here, being around Charlie who is close to Dean, is a mistake.
“I don’t understand why you’re telling me this.”
It shouldn’t be such a big thing as it is, but it is. Dean feels his heart drop as he watches Castiel’s jaw quiver with, what he assumes, is him trying to hold back letting his teeth chatter.
As he walks to the bathroom he wonders if trusting his brother to order his food is a mistake. But having the same dead end conversation isn’t doing anyone any good. There aren’t any answers! Hell, having an idea of what is going on might be nice, but Cas hasn’t offered up anything at all; just that he’s feeling weaker. Honestly he doubts if Castiel knows himself, at this point. Sam can talk in circles and make assumptions as much as he wants, but without retracing their steps, research, or actually talking to Cas about it they’ve got nothing to go on. It’s just a constant conversation of what “might be’s” that isn’t doing anyone any good.
It hits him after the words come out of his mouth that Sam never questioned him about it being a guy. Or that it might’ve been rape. Panic begins to flood through him and he feels his body shaking inside his arms.
Castiel’s growl has Benny’s mouth snapping closed, neck bared so fast Dean wants to laugh. Maybe if all of his sense, and well, everything was working properly again he thinks he might. Instead he flinches, instantly frustrated with his knee jerk, hormonal reaction. He catches Castiel’s eyes on him before they flick back to Benny, but Dean knows it was enough that Castiel saw how he reacted. Dean stands there, watching Castiel eye the other alpha like a predator would stare down his prey. It’s more than alpha posturing. It’s his mate fighting for him.
Dean hangs up and tosses his phone onto the coffee table before scrubbing his hands over his face. What the fuck is he going to do?
“You cannot look me in the eye and tell me that man you’ve practically raised for the better part of a few decades went off and beat the shit out of one of his friends because we broke up,” he snarls. “It’s bullshit, Bobby. You and I both know it. He keeps his anger in check better than you or I ever could!”
They were meeting at their favorite hole in the wall diner for a quick lunch. Castiel, who usually just ate his brown paper bag lunch in the museum’s cafeteria, was surprised to see Dean’s message waiting for him when he checked his silenced phone on a whim two hours before he was due for break. It wasn’t that they don’t normally hang out during the daylight hours, but between they two very differing jobs, it’s usually impossible to plan for it.
“Cas, I – ”
Castiel feels the air around him shift as he flexes his wings. He blinks staring at the old bedroom he had resigned himself to for months. It looks…different than what he remembers. The bed is unmade, blankets thrown around like he was thrashing in his sleep. He probably was. There is a stale odor of sweat and sickness that makes him wrinkle his nose. The holey closed curtains are covered in dust, and he tilts his head at them wondering if Sam had ever bothered to touch them in their stay. He doesn’t remember the window ever being opened.
“You didn’t say before,” Dean rasps out, pausing to lock his lips. “What is your kill rate?”
Hearing Sam laugh again is almost as good as the soup tastes now that his appetite seems to be back. The hints of spice were either lingering effects of last night or he was imaging it because now they’re gone. Even with the soup being cold, he drains his bowl in no time.
Clenching his uninjured hand tightly, he stops past Sam back to the Impala. He’s never done well with taking orders, especially when he doesn’t agree with them. “I will sit this out.” He says, glaring at his reflection in the window. “Not as if either of you have given me any options.” He opens the door and gets in, closing the door firmly behind him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel looks surprised for a moment before his blue eyes grow soft. Dean lets out a breath, relaxing slightly as he notices the alpha red is only ringing just outside of his blue, barely noticeable. “Ruts are rough on our bodies as well. Maybe not as frequent and messy, but equally as exhausting.”
Optimistically though, I think this will be a shorter story and wrapped up pretty quickly. You guys wont have to suffer too long. ~_^
Sam coughs and clears his throat. Dean’s hips thrust on their own into the sheets. “Did you, uh, buy what I suggest you buy to help with, um, you know?”
“And you just get to chose what’s good for me and what’s not, right? I don’t get a say in anything?”
Shaking his head out of the thoughts, Dean holds out the cup back to Sam. “So when can I get out of here?”
“See, that’s another thing I don’t get,” Dean says, nudging Sam’s shoulder slightly to get his attention. “You keep saying ‘incomplete bond’ or whatever. Dude bit me. Pretty sure that’s complete.”
The man’s eyes flutter closed as the breeze takes Dean’s scent back to the alpha again. Dean watches as the dark haired alpha takes in a deep breath, before blinking open his eyes slowly. Dean almost sighs out a relieved breath to see that his eyes are still blue not tinted with red.
His grace.
“Dean,” that familiar deep, rough voice says. “Are you – no, stupid, I’m sorry. You were in the hospital. How are you feeling? I was there. I swear I wanted to be there. I tried to come by, but I –”
“Tainted?” Castiel asks with a little head tilt, eyes squinting. “Because you’re mated?”
Their bodies flush against each other, Castiel nips and sucks at the scent gland once more, making Dean’s back arch off the wall. His whole body begins to shake as the alpha sucks and nips harder. Dean thrusts against Castiel only to be met with the rough feel of denim against his cock. It only hits him then that he’s completely naked and the alpha hasn’t even tried to rid himself of own his clothes.
Castiel keeps his eyes locked with Dean’s, not even sparing a glance at Sam. “May I ask some questions? Anything you can give will help, but I am going to need something, if that’s okay?”
“I’m going to give you one chance to take back what you said,” Castiel says slowly, almost menacing with the lightning flashing behind him. “We can still fix this.”
Giving his head a violent shake, Dean forces a cough to drive the thought away.
permission, but simply telling us where you’re going would be a nice little warning.” Sam sighs over the phone. “But what I’m saying is we have no idea
“Ten months,” Dean says too quickly. Damnit, that’s just perfect. “But who’s counting.” He chuckles awkwardly, sticking his hands in his pockets. “So what have you been doing with yourself? You went to Boston, right?” That’s a lie. Dean knows exactly where he went and it wasn’t even close to Boston.
“Ca-Ca-Cas,” Dean hisses out, trying to press himself closer against the warmth of his alpha. “Sh-sh-u-u-t u-u-up.”
With a gentle tug Dean pulls him up to his feet, their eye contact never wavering. Slowly he brings their joined hand to his lips and kisses each one of his knuckles, making Cas’ stomach swoop with emotions. He’s always known that Dean has a gentle, romantic side, but due to their working hours and living situation it’s very rare when it has a chance to be shown.
*~*~*~*
“Am I there?” He hears Sam ask, but his voice seems far away. Castiel vaguely recalls that he was suppose to be guiding him on how deep to go.
“Damnit,” Dean grumbles as he knocks the wrench sitting on the edge of the truck he’s working on falls to the ground.
Rolling her eyes Charlie doesn’t even have the decency to look offended. “Yeah, so you gunna make me ask, or you going to spill the beans?”
as he swears he can physically feel those razor sharp claws slashing their way deeper inside him.
Wait. Pupped? Their first time because of their compatibility. Does that mean that he and Cas…
And when Dean stabbed him in the chest, his narrowed eyes growing wide as he
“Cas, seriously you have to stop just leaving like that.” Sam huffs over the phone.
Cas turns his head back to Sam and gives him what he hopes is a confident smile. “Let me do this. Please.”
“Didn’t we already discuss this and decide that it was foolish?” Sighing, Castiel tips his head back to stare at the ceiling. He remembers many angels dying in attempts to stop the wrath of Cain all those centuries ago. The only reason Cain stopped was because he had a
The grin over Dean’s face grows, the white of his teeth shining in the pale yellow overhanging light. “I don’t think I’m going to do that.”
Dean nods. “Went in at three. Gets off at three.”
Dean’s knees hit the edge of his bed and he falls down onto it, gasping for air, trying not to think about the coolness coming from his sheets his is dried fluids.
“Now I’m not sayin’ that we’re okay, because we aren’t.” His eyes flick to his bite mark in the review mirror. “I do know that the night we met could’ve gone a whole other way, but it didn’t. I get we were both heat drunk – rut drunk – whatever. Point is, things could’ve been a lot different. It could’ve been bad.” He pauses, glancing at himself in the review mirror. “All I know is I sure as hell know I can’t do that to my brother again. So even though I don’t know you, your scent is kind of the only reason I’m still alive. I’m not stupid. I know how lucky I am that Sam’s gamble paid off.”
“That isn’t the Dean Winchester I know.” His voice seems to have dropped a few octaves, the deep rumble sending a shiver up Dean’s spine. “My Dean fights for life. He fights for those he loves.”
“I saw your soul burning through the darkness of hell, and recreated every atom inside your body. I am been inside your mind, walked through your dreams beside you.” Castiel takes a deep breath, focusing on his grace still inside Dean. It seems farther away, somehow, but still gives him relief that it’s still there. “I know you better than you anyone could ever imagine, even yourself.”
Either way, Benny is going to have to take him fighting the whole way if he really wants him that badly. Obviously the guy can see he wont submit to him. And for what? Just to be sold? Whatever cash Benny is getting, Dean decides that he’s going to make Benny regret every fucking cent of it.
Closing his eyes Castiel focuses in on the gentle humming of his grace. It flickers and pulls him at him calling for the missing bit. For a moment he thinks maybe it’s gotten stronger, but as he reaches out for it he frowns. Dean is close. Castiel reaches out for it, letting his mind search through blurs of colors, towns and people until he’s suddenly pulled backwards. The pull becomes stronger, almost like a prayer.
“I…focused on my grace, and…” Castiel tilts his head trying to figure out some way to explain himself.
His heart stopped beating on a Saturday.
Benny snorts. “Sure, cher.”
“So we aren’t the only ones with this. The rest of the world got hit with this thing too?” Dean asks.
Just as he stills to a stop and manages to gasp in a wet breath, Castiel picks him up by the shirt and hits him again. Dean doesn’t even fight it, just hangs there letting Cas rattle his face until he loses count, far past the point he can feel the hits.
Castiel looks at Dean again – really looks at him. Now that he understands what the emotion is, it’s almost laughable it took him this long to put it all together. Dean is jealous of Sam. All the lashing out at his brother is because Castiel doesn’t want Dean near him.
Charlie makes sure he gets a shower and to work the next day. They both are reprimanded for their absence (absences for Dean), and Dean takes the yelling numbly. He’s put on a new kidnapping case right away. Dean goes through the motions and loses himself in the notes, interviews and video footage. Every day for the next week he works well into the night. Charlie gathers him up when he’s on the edge of passing out, taking them both back to his apartment. Without even asking, she crashes on his couch after she makes sure he’s in his room for the night. Maybe it should bother him with the kind of hovering and mother-hening she’s doing, but Dean can’t bring himself to care. The next day they do it over again.
“Benny?” Dean calls, laying down the wrench on the workbench behind him. “Hey man, it’s late. Where you at?”
“Told ya the male bitch worked at this place,” another says. “Bet he’s really good with his hands.”
“I never meant for you to know. I didn’t – ”
this works and saves Dean, then the reality is that Dean is going to have to relive watching you slowly die. He’s going to live watching you die. How the hell do you think he’s going to cope with that a second time around?”
Dean’s eyes snap open as sharp whistle followed by laughter from across the road hits his ears. He doesn’t need the group of guys to get close enough to smell to know that they’re alpha’s. Because of course they are. That’s just the way his day is going. He’s such an idiot! He’s out in the middle of the damn parking lot slicking like a bitch in heat completely forgetting that omegas get jumped for just existing, let alone smelling like he does right now.
Sam says he was ventilated and in the hospital for thirteen days. When Dean asks him about Bobby, Sam changes the subject asking him about how he’s feeling, asking about any symptoms he might have, and his scent of smell. The last one probably should be a little odd, but the thing is Dean’s scent has come back with vengeance. It’s almost as if he can smell everything a hundred times better than he ever could. He can actually identify a person he has no clue of what their name is simply by their scent. His brother doesn’t seem to smell as strongly as some of the other ones, but Dean tells his brother that it’s probably just because he works at the hospital and has to sterilize himself twenty-four-seven.
The door clicks closed as Sam walks past him to the computer against the far wall. Dean turns around to see Castiel giving him a small smile as he leans against the wall by the door. He gives his mate a small one in return, taking a moment to admire Cas in his uniform. It fits him perfectly. Almost too perfectly. He wears it well, almost as if it’s a second skin.
The worst part about all of it is how he can’t even argue with Sam. It’s all true. However much he wants to pretend or forget (Chuck, how he wants to forget) that any of it happened to him, he can’t. All Sam is doing is just stating facts, there isn’t anything malicious about the words. He is an injured human. He has no wings. He has no grace. Crowley still holds his grace and if he ever wants it back he has to allow Dean to do things his way. In order for any of this to work he has to sit back and do as he’s told.
“It’s estimated that seventy-five percent of the population is infected. Only about five percent show any symptoms. By the time most of them feel bad enough to get tested they’ve probably already infected hundreds more people. By the time the tests come back positive the damage has already been done.”
Gasping in a breath, the last of pain seeps out of his body. Shakily, he raises his head to the lifeless body of the blond female he seduced not that long ago.
The day Dean crawled his way out of the earth he knew something about him was different. Maybe in the back of his mind the whisper of the answer was there, but he wasn’t ready to hear it. And even when those barn doors blew open, lights exploding above like fireworks above him, shotting at the man walking steadily towards him, completely not bothered by Dean's attempts to kill him, he knew.
“Then I guess it’s a good thing you’re here and I’m at the hospital.”
God, when was the last time someone just held him?
Ol aziazor elasa - I love you
“That’s…” His voice breaks, and he clears it trying to spare a minute to get his thoughts under control. “I’m not going to hurt, Dean. Not if it can be helped.”
“You should like shit,” Sammy says in greeting. “Are you feeling okay? Have you eaten anything? Tell me you are at least –”
Shaking his head, Sam laughs softly as Dean lets his head drop back down to the ground. Stilled moments like these are rare. Knowing that their new threat can so easily pick them off puts a new perspective to things. Dean lets his fingers absentmindedly move over Castiel’s back as he thinks about that place Castiel found him in and how close he’d been to just staying. How easily thoughts of Castiel disappeared. What if it would’ve been permanent? What if whatever it was inside him didn’t recognize his angel?
The sound of sirens come closer, and with them bright LED lights that make him squint and turn his head. Before Dean can really process what’s about to happen, or think to mention to Castiel what he figured out, there is just a blur of uniformed people everywhere. Colors from the emergency vehicle lights and noises from everyone rushing around has Dean jumping and twitching at the littlest of things.
“Get those chains around him!” Crowley yells at Sam as he comes into the line of vision handing one end to Crowley.
He grips the sheet tighter as hot tears spill past his tightly shut eyes. Not only is he pathetic, weak, useless, but now he’s dirty, unclean and used. This Dean, this shifter, is right about one thing. His Dean will never want him or look at him the same.
“As if you were any help,” Sam mumbles.
“No,” Castiel sobs, burying his head in the blankets.
There’s a pause. For Charlie it lasts long enough that he actually has to look at the phone to see if they’re still connected or not.
“Dean…” Castiel’s eyes dart back from his blade held in Dean’s hand to the man’s face.
Sam’s face hardens at the name, but before Dean can really respond his phone is out of his hand and in Sam’s who presses it against his ear.
Maybe some part of him expected things to be different after he finally had sex. Like not being a virgin anymore would magically make all the passion, urges or whatever suddenly surface. Castiel couldn’t shake the feeling that maybe he was broken, or something was broken inside him, wired wrong. No matter how hard he tried to think about things different, or will himself to see some stranger in a sexual way, nothing changed. Castiel never really felt like he needed to have sex, not like so many others do. Honestly Cas would have been happy to go forever without ever having to have it again.
“Shut up,” he snaps, cutting off whatever bullshit Dean was going to feed him. He isn’t some unintelligent, weak, pathetic thing. Just a few months ago he was an all power Angel of the Lord, how could Dean so quickly forget? Isn’t he still the same person, or does his grace truly define him? Whatever way Dean might think of him, Castiel is done being the victim.
It’s only then that Castiel realizes he’s flat back against the headboard. Dean holds out his arms to either side of his head, and pulls back enough to laugh. Castiel raises his arms to push him away, but Dean’s hands come down, grabbing his wrists tightly, yanking them up and slamming them above his head against the headboard. Castiel flinches slightly at the pain and glares back at the Dean.
The witch just stared at him, confusion plastered so openly on his face Dean finally took pity and gave in. It took close to an hour to give the witch a rough history lesson on familiars and witches. It took another forty-five minutes to explain the importance of keeping something like the power Castiel had, hidden.
“I’m a police officer needing to get a statement from the victim of the case,” he says calmly. Too calmly. The pause stretches a beat more without either of them moving or saying anything. Almost fed up with these two idiots thinking they know what’s best for them, Dean starts to push off the edge of the bed when Castiel speaks again. “Need I remind you that he is my mate, and I am his alpha. You cannot kick me out of the room.”
Charlie spends the rest of the day in his apartment doing whatever. He’s not exactly sure. Honestly Dean expected her to be gone when he left to get more liquor for the store on the corner. But when he came back fifteen minutes later, she was still there. Sitting on her usual chair, looking around his place with something that looks so close to pity Dean decides he needs to be more inebriated to deal with.
The voice wasn’t angry, but more curious. Dean remembers blinking up at the man with dark, messy hair and reaching up to pick out one of the many leaves stuck in it. His bright blue eyes squinting down at him as he tilted his head, almost making it easier for Dean to grab another leaf. It was then that Dean noticed his pointed ears.
The blond tips her head back as she lets out a loud cross between a moan and a scream, finally allowed to rock her hips as the pixie haired one licks every last drop.
Some answers to some questions, and a little calm before the storm. Enjoy the lovely lull before shit gets real. ~_^
When he finally lets his eyes close, it takes a heart stopping moment of darkness before they open and adjust again to see that the red is still there. Only then does Dean allow himself to breathe a sigh of relief as he takes in his surrounds.
Does this mean injecting the blood into Dean is working? He’s just given Dean the fourth dose, though, so shouldn’t he be weakened enough not to do something like this? The wardings, of course, only prevent Dean from using his power to escape or harm them, but that doesn’t really effect anything the demon part of him can do to his insides.
As more research and data comes out, everyone seems to absorb it and move about their day. Babies being born are tested right away to see if the virus was passed on to them. Each one of them carries it, but they’re unable to tell exactly what designation they carry. Sam theorizes that the gene lays dormant until probably puberty. Each baby born, though, shows the same basic instincts; scenting, only wanting their parents care (whether that be beta, omega or alpha) for the first few weeks of birth.
Maybe he is what others would consider holy. Maybe being an angel, or what qualifies as being an angel, is enough to save the Righteous Man – enough to save his Dean. Castiel hopes that if God is truly listening, that whatever happens, Sam wont be left alone. Not after all this. Not after everything. Because Dean deserves better. Both of the brothers do.
“Isn’t that the damn truth,” he whispers, watching Castiel limp across the parking lot into the motel room.
Castiel’s warm breath caresses over his lips, and Dean lets his eyes flutter closed as his body shudders out the last of the cold  He can feel the impending panic on the edge of his mind that’s slowly, but steadily, starting to come back online. Regardless of how much he just wants to live in this moment of feeling safe and cared for, Dean needs to know what happened to Benny.
Does this mean he wont be able to feel anything from Cas?
“I know you love Dean,” Castiel says in a rough voice, well aware that each word is one syllable closer to breaking apart. “You work with him, so of course you two are going to be close. It was my mistake to think we could continue to be friends.”
Without warning, the unrelenting pressure snaps, the safe balloon encasing his mind popping. A sharp, almost stabbing pain so sudden and unexpected whites out his vision.
Something touches his shoulder and Dean flinches, stumbling out of his chair avoiding, just nearly, falling into his own sick. Spinning around he sees his therapist, Castiel, standing beside his sideways chair, hand still outstretched.
Sam seems to accept his silence and doesn’t bother asking anything further on it. He opens up the towel and begins to pull out bits of glass that seem to have embedded themselves in his knuckles. Castiel grinds his teeth together as Sam pulls a particular long, thin bit out. Sam mutters and apology, setting the glass on the towel and examining his hand closely. Castiel could barely move his hand before and honestly has no clue how he managed to make anything close to a fist. After lifting Dean and tossing him across the room he’s almost positive he did more damage to it. Now his whole hand sings with pain making his head feel dizzy.
suppose to be happening.
The days bleed into each other, but all Dean cares about is who he’s killing next. At some point he starts to notice when he passes by some of the communities they’re beginning to empty. It isn’t until another handful of years pass, that he notices how scarce seeing an actual human is.
Dean slams him back against his car. His skin begins to itch and burn at the same where the Mark lays. “You’re a bastard, Crowley.”
“What the hell, Dean!” Sam snaps, clearly annoyed, pushing the door closed before Cas drives away. His nose scrunches up as the scent of them must have hit him.
“Fuuckk, Dean!” He moans, thrusting his hard, clothed dick harder against Dean’s. “I can’t get off without taking her from behind, thinking of you the whole time.”
Something wet drips off the tip of Castiel’s nose onto Dean lying beneath him. He feels another trickle running down the side of his face. Sweat. He is sweating. Castiel grabs Dean’s wrist as he tries to focus and pull more grace to use. A sharp pinprick of pain starts spreading throughout his chest as he begins to pry Dean’s fingers from it. Dean tries to wrap his fingers back around the blade, but Castiel catches them and breaks each one for good measure. The man hisses and thrashes his body as he places the blade against Dean’s throat.
Dean knows that this is probably the closest thing he’ll ever get to having someone care about him like those humans go on about.
“S-same,” he grits out.
Dean rolls his eyes, climbing up the front stairs into the house. “Figures you’d try and leave me here with the Father of Murder.”
Dean snorts and drops his hand from Castiel’s arm. “Seriously? You gunna ask me that when the angel almost fell face first outta the car?” The brightness in his eyes seems to go out almost instantly with the words, and Dean instantly hates himself defaulting sarcasm over words or actual responses. He hates that more times than not his word vomit wipes away any positive emotion that Castiel might be feeling.
real. Shit like this is stuff that they hear about when they read the newspaper for cases, but never comment on. This is the type of thing that, for them, was really just a horror story. Never did anyone think something like this would be something they’d have to deal with. Castiel, especially. He is – was – an angel. Is he still an angel? Oh God, the pain Castiel must have felt…
Dean starts at Crowley again, but abruptly stops when he hears his name yelled. Turning around he sees Cas limping quickly towards him. His breath hitches as his eyes catch Castiel’s bright blue ones full of worry. By the time Castiel finally reaches him, Dean’s fingers twitch with yearning just to grab him into a tight embrace. Realistically Dean knows he hasn’t been gone long, but it still feels like a forever. As he looks Cas over Dean is overwhelmed with everything that’s happened to him. He swallows the lump in his throat, blinking back the stinging feeling prickling his eyes.
Comments and kudos give me a high! You guys keep me going. <3
There’s a beat of silence over the line that’s enough Dean starts to zone out again.
Now then, lets begin. ^_~
Dean bucks up his hips, knocking Castiel out of his own head. He feels sweat beading up on his own forehead as he fights to keep Dean’s body pinned. The more he pulls his grace for more strength, he harder he finds himself breathing. Now that he’s reached out for his grace inside Dean, he feels it screaming for him. Castiel forces more of his weight down, trying to keep Dean from getting out of his hold. Desperately he tries to think of another way besides the two options; Either giving in and letting Dean finish him, or trying to smite Dean himself.
Sam keeps looking at him like he’s expecting something. More hate filled words, maybe, he’s not sure. But all Dean can do is rub that spot on his chest while he tries to fight back the growing emotions he wants to keep locked up until his brother is out of apartment. He’s cried enough in front of Sam to last a lifetime, and pulling out the hormone card isn’t something he can get away with this time.
“You never did say how you found that job,” Castiel says, turning enough in his seat he can look directly at him. “Never mentioned how it went.”
“You don’t give up on family,” he manages to get out hoarsely. “Ever.”
“Oh no, my bad!” Dean hits the side of his head with the heel of his hand. “You were a pathetic, weak, poor excuse of a human.” A slow, menacing smile spreads over his lips as he takes a few steps closer to the street. “You were so fucked up over that shifter fucking you, you weren’t thinking clearly. Am I close?”
Sam grunts, pulling against Dean’s hold enough that Castiel catches his eye for just a moment, but enough to watch Sam’s jaw clench into a look determination. It takes Cas a moment to wonder what he’s going to try, before movement from Sam’s hand has him looking down to see the needle of the syringe he’s still holding of blessed blood being jabbed into Dean’s thigh.
“This isn’t who I am, Dean. I don’t let my alpha come out or run the show ever. I can’t let something like that happen because of my job. I defiantly don’t use it to harass and intimidate omegas. I think I’ve only ever used my alpha voice three times, and all of them have been unintentional. I’m not better than you. I’m just a person, just like you.”
“Bone?” Crowley echoes his thoughts.
“It’s going to kill you, Dean,” Castiel whispers, his thumb tracing over the Mark. “The Mark of Cain is going to kill you.”
He moans as he catches a slight whiff of the cedar and pine honey scent that escapes from the car. More slick leaks out and he doesn’t even bother trying to clench to keep it from happening. It only took the alpha’s scent and his dick is already half hard. Dean pushes his palm against it trying to will it to go away, but the pressure just makes more slick slips out.
His heart stopped beating on a Saturday. Three years after the fact, Dean can remember talking about macaroni and cheese, Fourth of July plans and sending their ashes to the moon when they die so they can still watch over the other one still alive. Talk about morbid foreshadowing. But he can’t remember how they ended the conversation, only knowing he didn’t say he loved him. He didn’t say he needed him. He didn’t say he missed him.
Castiel sets his free hand on his shoulder and squeezes it. “Have faith.”
are – constantly take Castiel’s blood. They only pause both the IV and the blood when he’s hanging from the ceiling. The only time they take Dean’s is when he’s lying on the metal gurney, but in his cell.
They lay like that for a long time; just letting their breaths slowly fall into synch, listening to each others heartbeats while their fingertips trace patterns into each other’s skin. It’s peaceful. A type of peace that Dean doesn’t think he’s ever really known before, but is pretty sure he wouldn’t have found if he hadn’t have found Cas.
The sound of the door closing hard is enough enough to knock of them back into action, pushing away from each to try and clean up, tucking themselves away.
Castiel opens his mouth to say something, but a voice over the radio says his name, and Castiel schools the look of hurt on his face and responds to the person. Dean digs into his pocket for his phone, ignoring the missed messages from Sam he swipes the screen on and hits the phone icon and punches in his brothers number. It takes two rings, and Sam picks up with an irritated hello.
“Zachariah knew damn well I wasn’t going to do anything until Madison and I had more of a plan,” he growls clenching his hands into fists. “He was down in the ward today, which was weird to begin with. I don’t think he’s stepped on our floor since the whole thing was established. But I get there, and Madison says he’s asking a bunch of questions about care and comfort for our patients. She says something just seems really off about the whole thing.”
He drops his hand and looks up at the alpha’s panicked face. The emotion doesn’t match what Dean was expecting, but regardless the guy should be scared. He’s pissed. Beyond pissed. He’s what he swore he would never become and it’s all because of this guy laying beside him with that has his dick shoved up his ass.
The moment he realizes what he’s doing, he swears to himself. Months of having to deal with the mental repercussions that never healed properly surface when truly faced with something that should be a simple task. Castiel now realizes that even with his grace it doesn’t matter. His grace can heal the physical wounds, but the mental and emotional scars can never truly go away. Is that what it is like to be human? Having to live with these emotions day in and day out, always knowing that you weren’t strong enough? Good enough?
“And I let her take away the one thing I – we could have had it all – God! We were happy! I can’t even remember what that feels like. But I…I let her ruin it. You know the fucked up part about it?” His laugh comes out sounding more a broken sound. “I never stopped loving you.”
There was nothing out of the ordinary to even spark a hint of suspicion. Dean thinks harder as he cuts two wires and carefully taps them together until they spark and the car starts. There has to be
“There’s so much more,” his little brother says excitedly. “I mean yeah, when they finally found each other and realized what was going on, their cycles synched up again. They got pupped the first time, too. But besides that, true mates can feel what the other is feeling. Remember how I said you should talk to Castiel about biting him in return? Well, the other couple said that after they exchanged mating bites all of the omega’s pining sickness went away.”
Dean fidgets thinking about the alpha’s – no,
Narrowing his eyes, Dean stops walking. “What the hell does that dick want?”
“All I want is to just keep feeling you like this.” Castiel replies, bitting at Dean’s lower lip before flicking his tongue against Dean’s. “I could have it forever and it still wouldn’t be long enough.”
As most high school friends do, phone calls and emails from Balthazar eventually stopped coming. Between schoolwork and spending the rest of his free time with Dean, he hardly noticed until months later. It was sad that they’d drifted, but more a wistful kind of melancholy.
“Dean, stop!” Sam huffs as he tries to hold back a trashing Dean. “We need him!”
“Yeah,” he says glancing at the clock on his computer. “Guess you’d want to get home.”
“Cain.” The name comes out almost desperate, and Castiel pauses a moment trying to steady the sudden human emotion. “I know what you were. But you’ve resisted for so long.”
“Madison almost walked out with me, but I told her to stay,” he sighs leaning back in the chair. “Someone has to be there for the omegas. I mean, someone who isn’t some random stranger. She and I have been doing this since the beginning, you know. The nurses are great, but they can’t do everything. I have no idea who else they can get in there. Everyone else is pretty much stuck where they are, and you don’t see very many omega or beta doctors around looking for a job, and it’s not like an alpha can do what we do.”
“In here,” Sam says, waving them inside the room.
Huffing out a laugh, Dean shakes his head a bit. “You know, Sam said you were different. Said to give you a chance. But honestly, all you alpha’s are the same.” He sighs and flexes his hands in his lap. “I know you’re a cop and you’ve seen some shit Cas, but you only see maybe, I dunno, five percent of the shit an omega goes through daily. That’s just regular omegas, not some rare freak like me.” Chuckling humorously, he gives a slight shrug that makes his neck sting and has him biting back a hiss. Huh, maybe Cas might be right about needing his neck looked at after all. Clearing his throat, he continues, “This isn’t just something that happens every now and again. Those guys you just alpha voiced, or whatever? They’re nothing compared to most of the other shit out there. They’re just a couple of beta’s with an alpha complex.”
“You sonofabitch!” He screams grabbing Crowley’s jacket and slamming him against the Impala. “You knew we would meet up with Cain!”
“He hasn’t done anything to you,” Dean says inching forward.
“Treating your brother poorly isn’t helping anything,” Castiel challenges, digging his fingers into his palms trying to keep his voice steady. “He’s worried about you. You are hardly around anymore, and when you do happen to come back to our room you’re usually so drunk it’s amazing you made it back alive at all!” He takes in a deep breath, letting it out slowly before speaking again. “I have no idea what transpired between you two, other than the brief hushed fights I happen to overhear, but it needs to stop. You both are terrible with secrets, and it’s going to get one of you, if not both, killed.”
“It’s not normal, Sammy. It’s not like my usual heats. I can’t…” Dean clenches his jaw embarrassed to tell his brother any of what’s going on with him, but he knows he’s not going to last. It’s too much. “No matter what I do it isn’t enough.”
Fuck, thinking about what the two of them did in the bathroom and why the blond doesn’t have her panties anymore shouldn’t be as hot as it is.
As soon as Sam’s hands leave his shoulders, Dean feels lost. He watches Sam pull the blanket off Castiel, quickly but gently slipping the pair of pajama pants Dean had given Castiel to wear. Even with the jostling, Castiel doesn’t stir.
“You really think this is gunna work on me?” Dean growls. “Think I’m going to get all weepy like Crowley, huh? Sorry to break it to ya, but it ain’t gunna work. I don’t want this!”
The shadows in the garage stretch longer than he remembers them doing a little while ago. Blinking a few times, letting his eyes adjust to the dimming natural light, he stares at the clock confused that he might be misreading it. He sees that it’s well past “a little while ago” and well past closing time. How is it really almost six-thirty? Where the hell is Benny and why didn’t he tell him to pack it in at five?
’ me! I know it may be a little too complicated for your stupid beta brain to work out, but most of us pathetic omega’s don’t get that harlequin romance novel life. We get the shit end of the stick, and you of all people know’s how that ends up!” He takes in a deep breath trying to push past the growing feeling of betrayal rising, knowing it’s probably already seeped into his scent. Instead he squares his shoulders and glares up at his brother. “I came to you to fucking fix this – fix me! Not set me up and send me off with the first alpha that
“You were not controlled by the desire to kill!” Castiel exclaims, waving his hand in front of him. “This hasn’t been what you’ve been doing for centuries. You stopped! You lived a normal life, not bound to the Blade. If you can do it then Dean can survive this too!”
Sam scrunches up his nose again and gives him another bitchface. “Gross. Totally not what I mean, thanks.”
As quickly as the pain comes, it’s gone.
They stare at each other for a second before Dean lets his fist fly again, connecting right against his nose this time. Benny grunts just as Dean gasps as Benny’s fist hits him right in the stomach. The hit has him bending over to catch his breath when he feels too warm fingers slide behind his neck. A sense of
Still, having him gone this time and not being able to really see or talk to Cas this time left Dean more irritated and off than usual.
“Dean, hey. Hey, it’s okay.” A dark blurred shape moves in front of him as two warm, strong hands come up cupping his face. Blinking rapidly Castiel comes into focus. “You’re okay, alright? You don’t need to say anymore. I was there. I saw the rest. You’re safe now. I’m here.”
Panic sets in as Dean jolts up from the bed looking around for anything he can use as a weapon. What the hell was he thinking? He’s never been into guys. Not once since before the virus has he, Dean Winchester, ever swung that way. Using his own fingers to get off doesn’t count; he’s made peace with the fact that his omega side needs something like that, but that doesn’t make him gay, that’s just him. Even when that alpha in the alley had him pinned against that brick alley his body didn’t even respond like a normal omega should.
The male demon from outside is the first to attack. He throws a punch at Dean’s side that Dean blocks. He counters, swinging his own fist up to connect with the demons face in a satisfying crunch, demon blade grazing across his face. The demon lunges at him, grabbing Dean’s collar of his jacket, throwing him into the wall. Dean feels his breath punch out of him, as he gasps pushing himself back at the demon approaching demon. He blocks another fist and grabs the demon’s arm with one hand, twisting it. He plunges the demon knife into the demons chest, smirking as his life sparks out of him.
But I started this with my person, and she would be damn disappointed if I didn’t finish it, regardless of her being gone.
~*~*~
Castiel sucks and nips at his bottom lip, as he grabs both their dicks in his hand. Dean lets his hand fall over Cas’ as they start jerking each other off.
Sam shakes his head as his annoyed face falls into sadness. “Yeah, you’re right, it is. It’s also a situation we wouldn’t be in if it wasn’t for Crowley, apparently.” Sam looks over at Castiel and Dean can’t help but let his eyes follow. “As angry or frustrated we might be, there isn’t a damn thing we can do to change anything that’s happened. Crowley has always been a sneaky bastard, I’ll give him that. He planned this whole,” Sam waves his hand around, “stealing his grace thing, out well enough. It’s just if…”
Charlie’s eyes soften to something boarding close to sympathy that Castiel has to look away. He hears Charlie’s feet shuffling closer to him, and then her thin arms wrap around him, pulling him closer. Even with her petite frame, she embraces him tightly. That’s where he loses it and chokes out a sob.
Dean gasps in air as he falls to the ground as every sense Benny has seemed to hold captive by his little trick comes rushing back all at once. Dean hears footsteps crunching over the loose rocks on the asphalt, slowly coming closer to him. He’s just barely getting his breathing under control when he smells Castiel all around him.
Three; just even thinking about it makes Dean feel sick and full of rage at the same time, but Dean is almost positive he knows (without any type of confirmation) that he cannot live without his faerie. It’s knowledge running through your veins that you’re born with.
It spoke maybe a minute, but said enough that it had an impact. As long as Dean killed who the Empty wanted, when it wanted it done, Cas would stay with him. The moment he refused, it would take him. If he even thought about killing himself to try and get away with Castiel, it would take him.
Sam huffs out a laugh and Dean smirks taking another drink from his bottle. “Jealous Sammy?”
The colors stop in front of him and Castiel shakes his head trying to make his eyes function solid forms again. A chill shivers up his spine, and then spreads throughout his chest. Icicles suddenly stab into his lungs, and he gasps at the fresh pain, arching his back. Castiel collapses onto his knees, slumping forward. His hands grip the orange shag carpet underneath him as he tries to take in oxygen through painful gasps. The coldness is spreading higher, like a fingers crawling their way up his throat, gripping it tightly.
“The worst mistake I could have ever made was letting you walk out that door. But what’s done is done and everything is over with. All we have left is our future.
Dean. His Dean would never hurt him. Castiel recites the same thing to himself every day, trying to convince himself that everything from before isn’t real. The pain his body still feels has been an unpleasant reminder when all he wants to do is just forget. Castiel slowly approaches him, wondering why Dean’s body has suddenly gone completely stiff.
The sound of the door closing doesn’t even make Castiel twitch. Which makes his worry spike up a notch. The last time they talked was back when they finished their last hunt. Well, if you could call it talking. Maybe he was a little harsh, and it was more like he was screaming at the guy.
“He’s a person,” Castiel snaps, cutting him off. “A human being, regardless of his subgender. From what I saw when I came over, you both are the problem. I could smell his fear and anger half way over here, obviously you didn’t care about what you were doing. Still, without even knowing the facts of what happened, I can see that you disregarded his wishes for medical attention.”
“Crowley!” Sam grunts frantically looking around the empty room as Dean bangs on the door separating them. “Damnit, I wont be able to hold him too much longer.”
After about a week of solid failed attempts to try and summon Crowley, Sam decides they need to figure out a different way to get the King of Hell to them. That was when Sam and Dean started getting at each others throats. Well, that is, when Dean was actually around. Mostly he stumbled in after he thought they were asleep. Sometimes he wouldn’t even make it that far. He and Sam on more than a few occasions would wake up in the morning and go out looking for Dean just to find him passed out in back seat of the Impala half frozen. Those were the days Sam’s anger couldn’t be calmed at all.
“Sam…” Dean says licking his lips. Castiel watches as Dean’s eyes slowly travel down his body in such an obvious way Castiel feels his cheeks warm in a way that isn’t because of his fever. “He stayed behind.”
he working for the government? And if that’s the case, then Dean is royally fucked. He’s mated some big, secret spy, or something. Not like he has anything to hide, but he’s been talking a lot of shit about the new idiots running the world and that might have just been him digging his own grave.
“We just want to help,” he says holding his hand up.
“Maybe?” He shakes his head and shrugs. “It seems somewhat vaguely familiar when you mentioned it the first time, but not something I can just bring up from memory. But with how everything is now, I wouldn’t be surprised if something like this has happened before.”
Every morning for a week Dean scrubs his skin until it’s raw in the shower. The smell of the man seems to linger now matter how hard he tries to get rid of it. It isn’t until one day, a few days before his heat is due, that he wakes up and doesn’t smell it.
“Charlie!”
before!”
Dean snorts at that and shakes his head. “Safe? I haven’t been safe since I got hit with the virus.”
“I thought that – ”
“So help me, I swear I will look inside your mind and yank it out myself. I can’t do this again.”
Hello loves.
Benny comes back to work shortly after Andrea gives birth to a beautiful baby girl. It’s such a relief having another body in the shop Dean is on cloud nine. It feels like a weight has lifted off his shoulders he didn’t even realize is there. He’s in such a good mood he misses the odd looks Benny keeps giving him from time to time.
Shaking his head at him, Sammy wipes his watery eyes, smiling back at him. “Jerk.”
There isn’t much to think about when your mind is being put into a blender. It’s the stilled moments in between one form of torture to the next that are what Dean hates the most. Or maybe it’s a mixture of half being alone with his thoughts, and half being away from Cas.
Listen guys,
Phantom pressure from Benny’s fingers pushing into his scent gland has Dean rubbing over his neck, glancing over to his body still lifeless on the ground a few yards away. Knowing that he’ll need to explain to someone (probably multiple someone’s) what happened here makes his skin begin to crawl. Being an omega is one thing, he’s learned to adapt and keep the wolves away so-to-speak.
Cas manages quickly and carefully to sit him back onto the bed without incident. Sam hovers closely by the whole time, arms halfway outstretched like he’s some fragile thing that might collapse at any minute. Even with Cas’ help lifting him back onto bed his body still shakes. Sam already has that look on his face like he wants to lock him in the room and throw the key away, so he tries to hide it as best as he can.
Cas flinches as the phone hits the pillow with a soft thumb and bounces to the floor by his foot. Sam angrily strides back to the window, staring out into the empty parking lot. Realistically, Dean could be anywhere. It isn’t the best time for him to disappear, but after what happened last night they both needed their space and being stuck together inside a small motel room was not doing either of them any favors. More than likely Dean is probably passed out in the backseat of his car, a bottle of whiskey in his hand. If Castiel has learned anything from spending time with Dean it is that his coping mechanisms are terrible.
“I mean it, though. If you ever want to talk about what happened or, you know, anything, I’m here, okay?” Sam gives another nod and backs out of the bathroom, shutting the door with a quiet click behind him.
One thing Castiel was sure of is that the unresolved tension that constantly surrounding the three of them. The night Dean came back and Sam saw him with the Mark there had been so many words left unsaid. Thinking about it now, Castiel realizes he hasn’t been alone with Dean since that night. Sam constantly hovers over him making sure he wounds are clean, bandages fresh and that he’s eaten something at some point. As annoying and heartwarming it might be, Castiel knows the real reason behind he’s been obsessing about him, but won’t push the subject.
he is. Logically he knows that if Sam is here there is a strong chance that Dean is really Dean, but…What if the shifter knocked him unconscious before changing? What if killed him?
It wasn’t like Castiel actually had the opportunity to see anything with his own eyes. Both Sam and Dean made him stay, cooped up in whatever crappy motel room they’d rented for the day. Whether by an agreement between the two of them or Sam being fed up with Dean’s dead ends, most of the time Sam stayed behind with him. He tried making up excuses at first, most of the time completely ridiculous ones that Castiel saw right now. Now he doesn’t even bother. The more towns they visit where the leads wind up dry, the more restless Sam gets. Cas gets it, the feeling of being caged. He’s felt it since that night he lost the last of his grace.
Dean shrugs and points to his throat. It takes a minute but Sam catches on and rushes out the door only to hurry back in minutes later with a cup of ice water and a straw. Dean takes the cup and takes a sip, sighing as the coolness hits his dry throat. It burns, but he can already feel the scratchiness easing away.
Dean moans at the taste, opening up his mouth and chasing Castiel’s tongue for more. The alpha pushes Dean back until the coolness of the wall presses against his back. He breaks the kiss, turning his head to the side. Castiel nips and kisses over his jawline causing Dean to let out a whine from the back of his throat. The alpha’s stubble scrapes against his own but instead of being turned off by it, it almost feels like electricity vibrating over his skin everywhere the alpha touches. It feels amazing.
“From the very beginning you have been the cause to all of this!” Castiel hisses, pushing the blade harder against Crowley’s throat. “Don’t ever think for a second I will not remember that.” He slides his blade across the Kings neck, enjoying the hiss that escapes the demons lips. “From stealing my grace to the Mark on Dean’s arm, and where we stand presently. That is all on you.” Castiel points the tip of his blade at Crowley scowling at him. “And I will have my revenge.”
Castiel tries to pull back, but the monster doesn’t even let him move. He struggles against the shifters one arm hold until the dizziness ramps up again and he weakly pushes against his chest. Desperate to try anything, he tries praying to his brothers and sisters in heaven. Silence is his only answer.
We are getting there...or are we? ~_^
The King of Hell hums. “Everything for just one human. Sound familiar?”
Castiel works quickly around the car; putting it into gear, pressing buttons, starts pulling away from the multiple cars with flashing lights bouncing off everybody and everything and out onto the road. He flicks a few switches here and there, and then a siren blares. Dean flinches at the noise, trying not to look out of the window at everything flying past them. Since walking across the damn parking lot basically made him almost lose it, he has a feeling seeing the world fly past might make him sick. Instead, Dean focuses his gaze to his hands resting on his lap.
Crowley holds his hands up, rolling his eyes with a sigh. “No need to get all hot and bothered, Moose. Only trying to make sure we’ve got all options covered.”
“Cas…” Dean chokes out, trying to ignore how rough his voice sounds. His best friend –
Walking back to the computer Sam clicks a few things before starting to type. “I’ll give you a minute to catch your breath,” he says without pausing over the keys. “Then I need to look at the mating bite. From what I can see just visually, most of the bruising is coming from there. Swelling more than what it should be, which is concerning. I’ve never seen something like this, so it’s hard to tell what may or may not be going on. I’ll have to take pictures for documentation, then an MRI just to make sure there’s nothing else going on.”
His ex who is wrapping his arm around some dark haired girl tucking into his side, tipping her head up to kiss him on the cheek.
Cain grabs Dean’s wrist and proceeds to push the demon blade into his chest. Dean stares as the knife sits imbedded into his chest. He feels his eyes go wide as his mouth opens and closes without a sound. “You don’t stop, do you?” Cain smirks.
“Crowley said he used a location spell for the Blade. He didn’t say squat about you.” Dean replies.
“Sure,” Dean shrugged. “Most familiars can.”
“He offered us a deal.” The calm façade finally breaks as Sam throws his hands up in the air. “I told him to wait, Cas! I told him it was all a shitty idea! The whole situation all around is totally messed up.”
Castiel pants as his eyes blink back open changing from unfocused to narrowing back at him. “And instead of ignoring my calls or messages you called me. Obviously you were in heat, which was why when we met your scent had such an affected –”
Dean snorts a laugh, eyes flicking to the peaceful appearing house in front of them. “Darker than you?” Crowley responds by taking another small step back and clenches his jaw. Rolling his eyes, Dean sighs. “We had a deal, so is it here or not?”
Thinking about all things the three of them have discussed and looked into, Castiel thinks back to when Sam and Crowley were arguing about human blood. It worked on Crowley, nearly killing Sam of course, but would it work on a Knight of Hell? Maybe if they blessed the blood in the same way they bless the water it would have the same effect as holy water, and the same effect as curing a demon. Without the spell attached to it, would it even work? Castiel chews on the inside of his lip debating it. If anything, it’s worth a shot.
“Why not Honduras?” He waves his hand around. “This place is chaos. Screw needing demons to rein evil down, people are doing a pretty fucking bang up job on their own. These people have so much violence and hate inside them, no one would think twice about another body turning up.” Dean sighs dramatically. “And still you found me.”
“I was the one who pulled you out of the pit,” Castiel continues in a deeper voice, eyes opening slowly. “I – we – are connected in such a deeper, more complex way than anyone else can possibly fathom. I may not have been with you in hell, but I’ve been with you in your dreams and walked with you in memories.” Castiel takes in a shaky breath, fingers flexing over against Dean’s skin. “After I remade you and you went on living life out of hell, you use to call for me in your sleep. I always came when you called.”
He debates putting his card under the windshield wipers, but it’s getting dark and the guy might not see it. Dean’s eyes rest on the door handle of the car. He has to open it anyway to put the keys on the seat, so it makes sense to leave the card with the keys. Just lay them quickly on the seat and close the door, holding his breath shouldn’t be a problem.
“I’ll be a son of a whore, he remembers,” Crowley whispers as Dean’s screams pause. All Castiel can do is nod, staring helplessly as Sam appears beside Dean with a damp washcloth, dabbing Dean’s forehead with it.
“You’ll what?” Dean spins around to the sound of a twig snapping behind him.
“Dean, are you – ”
“You have to
It’s not that he doesn’t want to hear Cas’ voice right now, it’s just that he’s not even sure what he wants him to say. Benny is out of jail. Does this mean he’ll come after him? So much for thinking he could go back to work, he thinks to himself. Probably a good thing he hasn’t really been together enough to even attempt it.
“Show yourself!” He yells walking towards where he thinks the voice is coming from.
“I promise you after I’m done with you, you’ll always crave for more.”
Ohhhh booyyy! I did it! I finished a story in under a year! XD
“No,” he whispers roughly. “The angels have not found any way.”
Castiel suddenly feels too confined. The room feels even smaller than what it actually is. He has spent months grounded, unable to do or go as he wished; confined to his human vessel, only being able to be used for information. Lying in a bedroom day after day, haunted by reminders-nightmares- of every reason he is a pathetic excuse for an angel, let alone human. He has had to relive his failures every time his eyes closed, exhaustion casting him into sleep. He has let himself give up hope, and sat there wallowing in his own self shame and pity, slowly dying and doing nothing to try and stop it.
“Dude, you reek,” he says trying for lighthearted, but his words come out much too clipped.
Castiel looks over at Sam who’s eyes are somehow glaring even more at the demon, and then back at Crowley. “Almost everyone has been a demon.”
Sam hands him the bottle and gives him a sad smile. “Yeah, I guess I am. I want to blame it on being stuck at the hospital during all this, but a handful of the doctors and nurses on staff got affected. Two of them didn’t make it.” He nods to the bottle. “Anyway, this is what we are calling blockers. Kind of what you got sprayed with on your way in, except this you just rub on the spots of your body that secrete the most of your scent.” Sam points to the spot where his neck meets his shoulder, behind his ears and under his arms.
As he blinks, the moment is done. Castiel has Benny, hand gripping his throat tight, lifted high enough in the air that the other alpha hangs there, helplessly struggling to get the toes of his shoes on the ground as his face starts to turn red. The hairs on Dean’s arm raise as Castiel snarls, commanding any and all alpha authority.
Castiel lowers his head to see Crowley standing in front of him, looking rather bored. Anger, hatred, rage- everything that he had kept inside him for months- boils to the surface, causing his grace to ignite. This time, he can do something about all his emotions.
that this might work.” He shakes his head, glaring at him. “But trust me on this,
The squeak of a high pitched voice has Dean snapping his head to the side to see a perky looking blond with wide, bright blue eyes staring at them. “I’m sorry! I can come back. I’m sorry, I, um, I’ll give you a minute.”
Dean doesn’t even glance back at him. “They would’ve had to’ve followed us from the motel. But I checked to see if we were being followed and we weren’t. Hell, there is hardly anyone on these roads and –”
“Don’t call me that. I ain’t nothing to you.” His stomach twists as he quickly goes over his memories again, analyzing them to see if Benny’s right and maybe he’s confusing things.
Dean’s heard stories about when people hear certain types of bad news and talk about all these different things they feel or experience. Honestly, he thought they were all full of shit. That is, until now.
The last thing he wants to do is open his eyes. If he opens his eyes then it’s real. If its real then that means that Cas’ – his Cas – is gone. He killed him. He – oh God, he killed him. He killed his fucking soulmate. The one person created by God himself destined to love him, and Dean killed him.
“Or get rid of,” Crowley says.
be talking about this later.”
“Cas!” Sam yells beside him. “What the hell was that?”
“What do you mean?” He whispers. “What do you mean that you can’t stop thinking about me?”
“Dean’s fine. He’s being held on assault charges. Gordon’s face deserved every bit of what Dean gave him. Trust me.” She states the last part with such conviction it has Castiel afraid to ask anything else.
Dean’s bladder wakes him up in the early afternoon hours. He feels more clearheaded than the night before, which he’s thankful none of those lingering effects from Benny seem to have lasted. After he’s done relieving himself and washing his hands, Dean catches his reflection in the mirror. Stumbling backwards, he can’t take his eyes off the dark purple, yellow and blues of fingertip bruises circling his neck.
“Dean,” Castiel says. “I don’t want you to push yourself anymore than you already have. I have the basic timeframe of everything and how it started. You can stop now.” He reaches up and runs a hand through his hair, nails scrapping lightly against his scalp. Instantly Dean feels himself stiffen, nose suddenly filling with the phantom smell of spice and
“In here,” he replies, moaning as the water hits his skin. Fuck, it feels amazing. He swears it's better than last time.
“Cas, you –”
“Gotta make it look good, son,” he says giving Dean a wink. “Now get the hell outta my office. When you come back I expect you two to have worked your crap out, understand?”
“Castiel, stop!” Sam yells, awkwardly throwing his arms around him and somewhat holding them at his side.
Dean can’t even bring himself to look over to the burly guy sitting four feet away from him. Instead he stares down at his hands hanging lifelessly as his arms rest on his knees. He attempts to try to tune out the sounds of, now, distressed muffled yelling coming from behind the metal door, pretending like he doesn’t know what is happening inside someone’s cell.
Refusing to accept that his grace, the one thing calling out for him to save the man he loves, actually is the one thing that kills him, Castiel forces his hand to move. His fingers shake, and his body screams in pain, but he manages to move his hand forward. It almost seems like Dean is miles away instead of just an arms length away with how much effort it takes, but slowly his fingers brush against his Righteous Man’s hand.
“But Dean, if helping one person can make any type of difference and show the world that there’s some good left in it, I want to do that. If working at a hospital means I can use the resources to search for a way to end innocent people dying, that’s something I won’t apologize for.” Sam gives him a small smile opening up his arms wide. “These new world gods aren’t me. They’re still the same people they’ve always been, still fucking us lower and middle class workers over just like they use to.” Lowering his hands to his lap, Sam leans forward in the chair, watery eyes crinkling up at the sides as he smiles. “When I look at you I don’t see your designation or someone lower than anyone else. I don’t even see someone I need to try and fix, Dean. Because you aren’t broken. When I look at you, I just see my brother.”
“Sorry Castiel.” He says. “You’re not on my list.”
“What do you want?” Castiel growls. “You came here for something, so what is it!”
By the time they got to the physical torture, Dean was too exhausted to fight back. The slow shallow and deep cuts to the bottom of Dean’s feet might be the most memorable. Watching
After years (wow, has it really been almost a decade?) of meeting in their dorm room and finding out they’re suppose to be roommates, he’ll never understand why Dean chose to accept him for all his little quirks. Mostly people just scowl at him, mumbling how weird he is, but not Dean. No, Dean just shrugs his little things off as a part of who he is, never thinking anything less of him. Even now, well into the adult world, Dean never tries to get him to act differently and isn’t ashamed to be around him in public. Somehow they’ve managed to keep in contact with one another, regardless of how chaotic both their lives are. It baffles Castiel how this amazing, beautiful man chose him to befriend when Dean Winchester could have had anyone he ever wanted by his side.
His eyes rake over Castiel’s body, trying to take in the fact that he’s actually wearing normal clothes. The pair of dark blue jeans are hugging his thighs perfectly, and that dark green t-shirt has risen just enough Dean can see a flash of his toned, tanned stomach. It’s a combination of seeing Cas so relaxed and comfortable that has Dean unsure on what to do.
Dean squints his eyes open, just making out his brother standing in between where they both lie on the dingy, who-knows-what’s-been-on-it orangish-yellow carpet. Sam looks away from Dean and bends down to help Castiel slowly to his feet. Dean notices he’s holding his hands out in front of him gingerly. Sam looks back at him with a scowl, asking him again what happened.
All Dean can do is just give a shrug. The pressure that’s been building inside his chest since he woke up feels like it’s weighing on all his limbs now. There’s still the itch he felt from his heat, but it’s becoming more of background static, though, annoying if he thinks too much about it. But being here in this room with his brother, talking about his alpha who just up and left him without so much as a goodbye feels like someone shoved a knife into him. It hurts. It feels like he’s suffocating. Maybe it was just the rut and heat – wrong place, wrong time. Maybe Castiel actually figured out how badly he fucked up getting mixed up with him, and as soon as he could got as far away as possible. Maybe on some level Dean has been wrong this whole time and Castiel is actually worse than the average alpha. Maybe he says all this things to make omegas believe he’s actually different just to get them to feel safe, feel comforted, just to have them during heat. And after he gets what he needs, he just leaves.
If Castiel is really his soulmate, does he feel the same way?
“Gunna try and fix me now, Cas?” Dean says eyeing the syringe in his hand. “How many times I gotta tell you that I just don’t wanna be fixed.”
“Mm,” Castiel hums. “I just want you for your body.”
“We’re just going to give you something to take the edge off,” he says. “Relax you a little bit to look over you and make you comfortable.”
He watches Cain crouch down to a grave a few steps away from him, and pick up a teddy bear. Something inside Castiel’s chest painfully clenches, as he watches the man examines the bear with an expressionless face.
Castiel’s body goes rigid against Dean’s. At first, Dean has a trickle of fear that Castiel might snap like he did with Benny. But when he glances up and sees the lack of anger in his face it helps him swallow down that fear. Instead Cas straightens his back and slides his hand off his shoulder, all traces of his scent fading into nothing more than something neutral. Something that doesn’t smell like him or Cas, but something generic. Like how he thinks normal, masculine humans use to smell like before the virus. Wrinkling his nose, Dean stares at him wondering what the hell is going on.
Nothing else registers for Dean. An alpha bit him. He actually let himself get so heat drunk that he willingly let some random fucking alpha knot him and claim him!
Their first kiss happened a two weeks after Cas came clean about his feelings. Dean was leaving for the night and Castiel asked if it would be alright. What started out slow, chaste really, deepened quickly to something much, much more. Somehow Dean had been shoved up against the door with Cas kissing him like a man starving.
"You don't listen to my head all the time! You have no idea what I think, or what I want!"
“So what, you want me to ask the guy out on a date?”
Sam nods, his ridiculously long hair flopping with the motion. Has he even attempted to cut his hair at all since this shit started? Dean can’t remember seeing his brother longer than a few minutes here or there since he’s been in the hospital, so he figures probably not. Maybe he should just help the kid out and shear him while he’s sleeping. If he ever comes home again. When was the last time Sam was actually at their apartment?
Okay, that one he deserves. “I’m sorry. Truly.”
He can’t feel his hands. He can’t feel his legs. He can’t feel anything except the fast-paced
Dean lies and says he’s fine. He knows Castiel doesn’t believe him, but for the sanity of both of them, pretends like maybe everything is.
Without even trying, amusement seeps through their bond. Dean seems to almost be poking purposefully at his grace, which only irritates Castiel. He knows that the demon part of Dean is only using it as bait to draw him out, but something about the demon’s evil touching something that is apart of him makes his hand begin to tingle wither energy. It’s almost as if he’s purposely trying to corrupt something so pure as Dean’s soul, making it completely dark. Castiel grinds his teeth together in anger, tightening his hold on his blade.
The words fall out of his mouth so easily Dean isn’t even surprised. They've always been there, right on the top of his tongue. He’s known it since before they were together, and why he hasn’t told Cas he has no real answer. But now, after all the years, after all the promises and steps they’ve been taken, it’s all boiled down to this?
Dean leans back into the couch and regrets the decision almost immediately. The smell of Cas and him comes up and he gasps, the weight of the pressure in his chest almost feels like it’s crushing him.
“I just can’t seem to get rid of you, can I?” Dean asks, raising the Blade and picking off something from the teeth. “I come all this way to get away from you, and still, here you are.”
“What the fuck if your problem?”
Looking away from him again, Castiel sighs and leans his head back against the headboard. “I breathed life back into you, helped you build that wall inside your mind to keep out those memories that were eating away at you and now…”
“I mean it,” he says a bit harsher, narrowing his eyes down at Dean. “You’ve been pretty useless since you two split. Now we know you haven’t been unfaithful, but now we got proof to put all doubt to rest. I expect you and your man to take those three days and work your shit out. I expect you back in the office Tuesday, at five am, with a clear head. Now get the hell outta my office and don’t come back till you can get your damn head outta your ass!”
“Cas, listen –”
Phone still pressed to his ear, Castiel looks to the right down the hallway to the elevators. Knowing Dean for so long he knows where everything is in the building, but taking the elevator requires permission. If he were to just barrel down the hallway looking as pissed off as he feels he has no doubt he will be detained before he even reaches the doors.
“But –”
After a bit, Dean clears his throat. Castiel blinks his eyes open, not sure when he started to doze. “I, uh, just wanted you to know that what said earlier, um, s’cool if, you know, we don’t ever do that. There’s no pressure and I don’t want you to think that – ”
Meg glares down at him, her rosewater scent turning into something like mildew. “I get the pleasure of staying with them while they pass and here you are wishing for death to come just because you’re, what? Enlighten me, please. How can having an alpha who clearly cares about you and a brother who’s a damn doctor trying to save your life a bad hand in life? Any of these rejected omegas would give anything to be in your shoes! To have someone who’s fighting for them! Tell me what right you have to piss away your second chance while they all die alone!”
Dean watches as the guy pulls a needle from behind his back, holding it out to the side from him to see. He’s full of so many feelings between disgust, anger, irritation – and that doesn’t even begin to cover it. All Dean can think about is how his skin just feels wrong. All wrong. It’s like a mantra inside his head, screaming at him on repeat. Nothing he’s saying or doing is getting through to them. All they care about is what Cas thinks, or at least, what they think he wants. A little voice inside Dean’s head thinks that Cas wouldn’t force him to do anything he doesn’t want to do.
“I’m so sorry,” Castiel says. “The spell…It must have broke when I died. I thought that I –
Snapping his head up from his arms, Dean glares up at him, daring him to finish that sentence. “I’m gunna stop you right there before you actually start lying to my face, 'stead of doing it behind my back.”
So he drinks.
Dean breathes a sigh of relief that whatever Sam wanted to drill him on about Cas he’s decided to drop. Tomorrow, he thinks, tomorrow they’ll ask Cas and get it all figured out.
Sam appears by his side grabbing Castiel’s legs and together they turn him over as carefully as they can. Dean takes out the knife he tucks away in the back of his pants and cuts through the belt, throwing it across the room. There are already cuts and bruises starting to form from where it was rubbing into wrists, and Dean winces as he lays Cas’ arms down over his chest. Dean takes a in an unsteady breath and gets to work assessing the rest of the damaged over Castiel’s body. Some of his fingers look broken, he’s got bruises scattered over his face, neck and chest. Dean thinks, maybe, a knot on the side of his head like he was hit hard with something.
to do – not like those other freaks out there. It’s a necessity, pure and simple.
Dean lets go of his hand as Castiel enters his bedroom. The bed is unmade from this morning, covers a bit more disarrayed than he remembers leaving them in and the pillow Dean use to use when he’d sleep over is bunched up on it’s side right next to Cas’. It’s almost a clear sign to anyone who were to look at his bed how much sleep he isn’t getting, and that hugging the spare pillow to sleep doesn’t even seem to help.
Castiel feels his face start to warm as their eyes find each other again. Dean presses another kiss onto his knuckles, his beard scraping against his skin. A grin spreads out over his lips as unwraps his fingers from Deans, running it over his bearded face. “You’re going to shave this, right?”
Dean has no other option but to follow.
Looking down at the dirt and blood over his clothes, Castiel gives a small nod. Crowley’s right. It wouldn’t be doing anyone any favors if Sam knew where he had been and the outcome of the visit.
Shifting in his seat nervously, Dean licks his lips before asking, “Uh, Cas? You okay there, buddy?”
Sam huffs out a breath. “Anyway, even though beta’s didn’t show any signs of being sick or infected, their bodies still went through a change, though more minor than everyone else. Their scent of smell has shifted slightly, allowing it to be more heightened. There’s something in their blood that we think is just more compatible to whatever ‘virus’. Everyone, regardless of subgender, has either developed some sort of smell or –”
Castiel searches his eyes, trying to search for something telling him Dean isn’t as far gone as he’s letting on. He watches as his eyes blink and come back oily black. Gripping tightly to Dean’s wrist, he twists and spins himself out of his grip. Dean laughs as his fist lands across Castiel’s face.
twitches with interest.
No, that can’t be true he would’ve felt it. Titling his head Castiel tries to focus on the feeling of his grace inside Dean, but gets nothing. He’s too exhausted to even start wondering what that means. Dean’s face is tightened into trying to look pissed off, but failing miserably. Just looking at him makes Castiel’s skin begins to crawl and his blood start to boil. He looks back down at the ground, shame suddenly overwhelming him as a twinge of pain from his lower region reminds him of what happened.
He watches as Sam’s eyes go wide as the younger brother puts everything together. “No! Have you fucking lost it, Castiel?! Dean literally took on the Mark to try and get your grace back and now you just want to – ”
It’s amazing to Castiel that one moment ago he was trying to come to terms with having to settle with living a life as just a shell of a man, and now… Now Dean is suddenly here. They’re both
alpha) let out a shaky sigh. Instead of that possibly helping the situation, it seems to be having the opposite effect and making Dean freak out more. His brain is trying to process everything, but keeps short circuiting, unable to remember anything that he or Sam talked about. “I’m okay. Sam told me you, uh, came by. Kinda the reason I, you know, wanted to call. Thanks for that, by the way.”
“Cain is killing, again.” He states, turning away from Sam.
Dean can only just nod, hand pausing as the blond slowly pulls herself away from the other and starts crawling across the bed to him. She bends down and without any fanfare, swallows down his dick all the way to the base.
How has he never thought about what it would be like to kiss perfectly pink lips? After all this millennia of time together, always thinking they will have tomorrow, and now they’re here, down to seconds, and Dean can’t help want it all – everything – at once. The way Castiel is acting (at least what his body language is tell him) Dean thinks that maybe he’s not alone in what he’s feeling.
It always makes showering off the blood an…interesting experience.
Instead of tossing the empty box into the cardboard box Charlie saves in her apartment for recycling, he throws it. Spinning back to face her, a mixture of anger and hurt that he’s stuffed down for the past month surfaces quickly. “I knew this was a mistake.”
“Mmm, you want me to help you with that?” She asks before moaning as the other girl twists her other nipple.
Dean feels his eyes go wide as it hits him how the what he said without context would get taken.
Dean looks around Cas’ shoulder to see Sammy standing there, worry etched over his face. He blushes in embarrassment, instantly hating that he let himself go with his brother around. Castiel’s arms slip free from around him as he turns to Sam, but makes sure to still keep an arm pressed against Dean’s.
“You really want my honest opinion ‘bout what made him snap?” Bobby asks. “You pro’ally ain’t gunna like what you hear.”
Dean searches Cas’ eyes, trying to gage on what answer might be the best. Something about the moment feels important, like the answer to the question is going to change their dynamic. Dean isn’t sure he’s ready for that. He’s not sure he can handle losing Cas either.
“Oh, it’s one of those dreams again.” Castiel says in a sad tone.
Charlie sniffs into the receiver. It’s such a little thing, but someone would really have to know his friend to know that her crying is not something she does often or easily. Castiel yanks open the door filled with such a sudden rage it takes him a minute to gather his bearings in the lobby. A receptionist he’s never seen before stands up from her seat slowly, giving him a careful smile.
hold him!”
He can’t form any words, so he just shakes his head, looking down at the stupid scuffed up linoleum floor. Something inside him is broken. It’s been broken for a long time, and even an alpha figured that out and knew he wasn’t worth the time.
“Do you have the blood?” His voice comes out rougher than usual. He briefly remembers himself screaming and flinches knowing Dean probably heard him through the thin walls.
His forehead creases as he stares at the cup of water in front of him. The liquid is still, no vibrations causing movement. Castiel slowly raises his head and looks up across the table to the long haired man in front of him. Sam looks back at him with a mixture of disappointment, anger, and pity. The younger brother runs a hand through his tangled hair, shaking his head. Castiel begins to lower his head again.
. But Dean manages to brush off his deepest, probably longest pent up secret ever, instead of letting it spill out. They exit the diner together, both pausing underneath the small little awning above the door. A cool, gentle mist blows around them, just barely edging on not quite being rain. Dean turns to say his goodbyes to Cas not really thinking about how close they’re standing next to each other. They always seem to gravitate closer together than most people do.
“I trained her. I built and created every last Knight of Hell, Abaddon included.” He steps closer to Dean, dropping his voice. “And how do you think everyone knows it is possible to kill a Knight of Hell with that Blade? Who do you think slaughtered them?”
And now with the idea that he could possibly be pregnant…
“You don’t have it?” Castiel snaps. The sharp tone has Dean squeezing his eyes closed, tears slipping past as the whine finally escapes from his mouth.
The door separating them from Dean cracks, and Castiel barely has time to raise his arm to block the explosion of splinters from the wood. He registers them hitting him, but his grace seems to be working properly enough at the moment to keep any harm from coming to him. Lowering his arm he sees Sam crouched on the ground a few feet from his brother, taking in raspy breaths as he tries to push himself to his feet. Other than a few cuts from the flying wood, Sam seems more or less okay.
Does rejection work the Sam way? Didn’t Sam say something about Cas feeling him dying? Does that mean all the other alphas that bit the other omegas feel it too?
It takes a second of watching Crowley look more like his relaxed, smug self before the sudden clarity of everything hits Dean like a punch to the chest. He knew exactly what was going to happen and somehow planned the whole thing.
He reaches for the handle of the door, trying not to think about why his stiff fingers not cooperating properly. The way a few of them are awkwardly angled he suspects they are broken, but none of that matters. Getting out of this car and away from the Dean who isn’t
“You shouldn’t be here,” he whispered, in a low, deep voice.
“You were…” he pauses, running a hand through his hair and glances back at Castiel. “Screaming. You were screaming, Dean.” Sam looks back at him with those damned puppy dog eyes. “‘Somebody help me’.”
– for more, is. For the first time in maybe all his life he
Dean feels Castiel’s hot breath on his neck again and moves his head to the side so his alpha can reach it better. “You feel so good. Yes, right there. Fuck Cas, you feel so good. So fucking big. So fucking perfect. Don’t stop. Don’t . Fucking. Ahhhh!”
“You with me?” Sam’s voice is starting to fade away into background noise, again. The steadily slither of the water reaches the edge of the table, and slowly falls off in one simple drip.
“Fuck you,” Dean spits out, panting as he tries to fight every damn urge in his body and molecule of his make up. He manages to get his arms underneath him again, but they shake so much under his weight he feels like he might actually collapse.
“Dean? What the hell is going on? Is someone there? Is –”
Almost as if he can sense it, Cas slowly tapers off until pulling back just enough they can look at each other without going cross eyed. He smiles that soft smile Dean thinks he can get use to seeing, and squeezes his hand again.
“Actually, I’m kind of beat,” Dean says cradling the phone in between his ear and shoulder as he unlocks the door. Something about talking to an alpha like he is has him reeling with adrenaline. He doesn’t think he’s ever felt so untouchable before. “I still need to call my, uh, boss and work out my schedule.”
At some point during their meal, the partly cloudy day has turned into a full cloudy day. Rain is misting around them, but judging by the looming dark clouds about them, it wont be much longer before it comes pouring down. They’re both standing under the diners small overhang, their arms pressed tightly against each other. Castiel turns to thank him once more for lunch, thinking nothing of their closeness.
“I don’t give two shits what you read on the guy, or what the guy did because he felt guilty about what might happen to someone he just spent a few days rolling around in bed with,” Dean growls back.
Dean looks over at him, almost hoping Castiel is doing his weird staring thing, but he’s just staring straight ahead. “I’m fine,” he breathes, his voice coming out quieter than he realizes he meant them to.
Dean starts laughing again as Sam grabs onto his arm, dragging him out of the room and shutting the door, muffling the laughter. All he Castiel can do is stand there, staring at the wooden door, ignoring every molecule of his make up that screams for him to bust back in there and save him (
The two men grip his arms tightly, pushing him forward after Bobby. Dean passes Charlie who’s still planted by the door, but he can’t summon up enough courage to look her in the eyes. All he knows is that he’s completely and royally fucked.
“I don’t – Cas, I would remember that.”
In retrospect, maybe this situation didn’t have to become this
Giving one last hard look at him, Sam turns away. “I’m going to need more vials.”
And then there’s him, the fucked up older brother, stuck in the same place he’s been for the past however long, pining after his best friend. Dean’s not exactly sure when it happened, but he’s pretty sure it was somewhere between being roommates with Cas all throughout their college days,  then moving into a shared apartment while Cas finished out college and while Dean started getting on his feet on the ground with the force, when it happened. He knows that it was before Cas moved out after graduating and landing a really good gig at the museum.
Cain gestures to the house before walking past them towards it, leaving Crowley staring after him like he’s going to be sick. Dean narrows his eyes at the retreating man. He doesn’t know what he might have been expecting from from Cain but it sure wasn’t being invited into his damn house. Still, there isn’t really anything else to do but accept the invitation. The last thing he wants to do is piss the Father of Murder.
“I’m not even attracted to guys,” Dean says weakly, knowing the moment the words leaves his lips it’s a lie.
Castiel nods slightly, barely a twitch, accepting the clothes without protest, whispering, “Thank you, Dean.”
A ghost of tingling itches his head, and he runs his fingertips through the, now, shorter, clean hair. His image mimics him, and he smirks at his reflection.
A movement from the kitchen doorway has Dean’s eyes darting towards it, blood thumping in his with anticipation of another attack. Instead, Cain leans nonchalantly against the doorframe taking a long pull from a beer, watching him closely.
Shaking the right arm of his leather jack and trying to work it off becomes increasingly more frustrating as his flannel catches and starts coming off. Annoyed, Dean scoots out the side of the seat and stands up having more access to slip his jacket off his arm. Giving a triumphant smile, he throws it back into the booth before adjusting the flannel back onto his shoulders and sitting down.
. I honestly don’t really care if I go back downstairs on that rack, or thrown upstairs while they try and figure out if I’ve ever had a good enough memory to have me relive for the rest of forever. Honestly, that might be a little entertaining to watch them try and figure out. But no, I ain’t going back there. There isn’t anything back there for me.”
With a choked off noise his orgasm hits out of nowhere. Dean’s shaky legs wobble before giving out and he slumps to the ground, hand still around his softening dick.
Cain’s grip tightens on Dean’s as spider webbed red lines begin to spread out from the Mark. Dean watches as those jagged lines travel down Cain’s arm down to their adjoined hands. As the red spreads and slides from Cain’s to his, Dean hisses. It feels like fire suddenly running through his veins setting his whole body aflame. A small whimper escapes its way past his lips as the pain intensifies.
Taken aback by the random comment, Castiel feels his face scrunch up with confusion. “Uh, I guess I haven’t really put much thought into it. What does this have to do with Dean? Is everything okay?”
Need Crowley? The King of Hell, the demon who stole his grace, the constant annoyance in almost every step they’ve taken since day one of meeting him. Now they suddenly need him? Crowley is just standing there, looking even more smug than usual as Dean’s yelling things at him too quickly for Castiel to really understand. None of this makes sense. He surely wasn’t out longer than a few hours, but Sam, out of any of them, knows the importance of coming up with decisions together.
Out of the corner of his eye Dean sees Sam start to push himself off the chair. He holds up a hand to stop him, glaring back at his brother daring him to challenge him. Sam raises his hands, eyes wide as he slowly sets himself down again.
Dean shuts the trunk a little too hard and turns to his brother. “Spit it out, dude.”
The night drags on slowly. Sam eventually comes back bringing with him multiple cases of beer. He sits down in his usual spot and broods at the tv most of the night until his head starts to loll to the side. Dean loses count of how many drinks his brother has had, but figures after all the bullshit lately Sam deserves a night to get drunk and forget about shit for awhile.
“I don’t think locating Dean will be an issue,” the King of Hell says smirking at Castiel. He meets the look narrowed eyes.  “As for another option, why confine Dean in a room or cell with warding preventing him from leaving until we find a way.”
to stop. There has to be something more, something they’re missing. Crowley claims to know nothing, but a part of him wonders if maybe the King of Hell knows more than he’s holding saying.
Even Dean knows the situation is tilting further out of his favor, he isn’t afraid. An almost type of acceptance washes over him. It seems to settle his mind enough he finds a sense of calm, letting him rationally evaluate everything.
Dean can smell his own scent as it sharpens, and he swears if he could stand up without passing out he would throw the alpha out the door himself. “You expect me to believe that bullshit! I ain’t buyin’ anything you’re sellin’, buddy! I don’t know if you’ve been livin’ on planet Earth lately, but I have yet to meet one level headed, rational headed alpha – let alone one trying to bullshit me into submitting right after he bit me.”
But it’s getting better.
“Can I get another?” He asks lifting his half empty bottle for her to see.
“Still here,” Charlie responds. “I can hear a couple of Gordon’s friends, Cas. They’re still looking for me.”
Dean just shrugs turning over to stare up at the ceiling instead. Even though he may not be able to see the blue of his alpha’s eyes, he can still feel them peering at him in the dark. “M’fine.”
Dean pauses, face looking surprised for a second before slowly falling into something dangerously close to pity. “Cas…”
“Hey! I’m not done with you!” Dean walks up behind Cain, grabs his arm and turns him around. He raises the demon knife up to his chest, uncaring if he applies too much pressure. Let the damn asshole bleed for all he cares. “I need that damn blade, and I’m not leaving here without it. You may have given up killing, but I haven’t!”
Regardless of wanting nothing more than to just wake up from this nightmare, Dean’s thoughts keep taking him back to being in his office. Gordon’s disgusting words replay in his mind over and over again. He keeps seeing flashes from when he lost it. Everything red. Flashes of the red from Gordon’s blood, the red of Charlie’s hair and the red smeared over on the floor, the red tinting his hands…
The hands jerk away from his face. “Shit! Fuck! You’re on fire!”
Taking in a deep breath, Dean tries to calm his thoughts. He needs to have some sort of clarification moving forward, and the longer he stands here stewing in his own mind everything is just going to get worse. He wants Cas back so badly it hurts to breathe, but it isn’t his choice what happens with them. Deep inside Dean knows that if he lets himself fall again just to get hurt, he wont survive it this time.
“M’good,” Dean says, taking in a breath and letting it out slow. “I’m good.” He reaches for the handle of his car and pulls it open. “I’ll follow you, okay?”
The confirmation of hear the words of the slight confession that this Dean isn’t
“You sure?” Dean whispers before kissing that place behind his ear that makes him shiver.
Dread begins to settle over him and he swallows thickly. “What did Dean agree to? What did Crowley say?”
And then they’re gone.
Castiel watches as he presses Dean’s number, bringing the phone to his ear. Sam’s leg is bouncing up and down so violently Castiel can feel the vibrations from where he sits and stands up. Still, the understands the feeling. He can’t just sit here knowing that Dean is out there about ready to make the most stupid decision of his life all in some thin lined agreement Crowley might actually give back his grace.
Chalking it up to some sort of mate thing, Dean doesn’t even ask how Cas knows what he was about ready to do. Giving a stiff nod, Dean lets his alpha’s hand keep guiding him forward until Sam stops next to a room on the left with a door wide open.
Dean feels Castiel’s whole body stiffen, but he doesn’t move his hand away from Dean’s arm. His breathing comes out quicker, more unsteady, but still he doesn’t push him away. It’s far from what he wishes, but it’s something. Something more than what he had yesterday. Opening his eyes, he pulls his head away from Castiel’s.
“You aren’t hearing me! You can’t go through this heat alone! It’s going to –”
“An angel will always hold more power over any demon.” Castiel whispers, letting everything rest inside his mind.
A twinge of anxiety mixed with annoyance flares up now that Sam’s scent is now overpowering Cas’ scent. It has him shifting in his seat as he tries to push the emotions back. He’s not sure if it’s really him feeling this way or his haywire head fucking with him, but he has to fight back the sudden urge to kick his brother out of his apartment. Coughing back the words ready to come out, Dean tries breathing through his mouth hoping it will help. Sam’s eyes snap back to him and all Dean can do is look away.
He’s so caught up that it isn’t until the sound of a car door slamming somewhere outside startles him enough Dean scrambles to his feet. Dean fumbles around the side of the wall until he finds the light switch and flicks on the light. Slowly, he lifts up his shirt half expecting to see a gaping whole where Alastair had cut him open. Instead there is perfect, unscarred skin. As if it never happened.
Cas promised him it didn’t hurt, that it was an accident, but Dean couldn’t hear him past his own self-hatred drowning out the words. He couldn’t help feeling that he was just like Benny.
Dean has weighed both sides of the coins. There are always some points greater than the others, and contrary wise, some points that are lesser great than others. Either way you spin it, Dean knows he’s been dancing with the devil far too long. It’s time to – how’s that saying go? – “shit or get off the pot”. Yeah, that’s the one.
Dean, thankfully, takes a few steps back away from Sam, eyes focused on the ground. Sam pushes himself off the hood, glaring heatedly at his brother. Not wanting anything else to escalate between the two of them, Castiel places himself in between the two of them, looking back at Sam.
There was magic manipulation where a mage placed both his hands on either side of Dean’s temples, trying to bind himself to Dean. It never took, of course, his and Castiel’s bond was proud - soul linked - but that didn’t stop them from trying sporadically. Sometimes the mage would try other spells; using his corroded magic to dig around his mind, making Dean relive memories only now warped into nightmares. Other times the guy would force Dean into his familiar form, collaring him with some sort of special spell that wouldn’t let him change back. They chained him to the table, doing countless experiments on him until Dean wasn’t sure he would ever be whole again.
Dean hesitates, torn between not knowing what to say, but damn sure wanting to remember. The lack of answer right away must be an answer in it of itself, because Castiel’s face drops again.
“Mmm,” Dean hums yanking his brother’s back against his chest. One of his hands rest on his jaw, while he places the other on the opposite side of his head. “I think I’ll snap his neck right here. Let you watch another person die that you’re unable to save. Not as satisfying as watching him bleed out, but,” he shrugs. “Gotta work with what you’re given.”
“No!” He roars, eyes glowing blue. “You will not touch him!”
“Can you tell me what you remember last? Sometimes that helps restore your memories.”
Dean heads back to the apartment feeling half numb and half violated. He puts the blockers on the bathroom sink and just stares at himself in the mirror.
“Cas?” Dean says, tentatively, brushing his fingers against his.
Dean lifts his legs to wrap around Castiel’s, and as he’s adjusting the angel, his alpha rocks into him at just the right spot making Dean scream out his name. Castiel pauses for a moment before catching Dean’s eye. Staring up at him he watches at whatever hold Castiel has on his alpha, snap. He reaches behind him, grabbing onto to Dean’s legs, helping hold them up as he snaps his hips forward again, rubbing against the spot inside him that makes his body ignite with pleasure he’s never felt before.
“Stop. Just…stop.” Castiel eyes his blade wearily.
“Why would you –”
“Cas, man, talk to me.” A hand touches his shoulder, and Castiel jerks back rising to his feet, tipping his chair over.
As quick as the hits started, they stop as his angel drops him unceremoniously in a heap on the ground. He doesn’t even try to move, just lets his brokenly numb face lay in the mud.
“I’m right here!” Dean snarls.
Maybe.

He chuckles at the alphas choice of car as he walks around it to see what he’s going to be dealing with. The color along with the actual car itself looks like the guy is more a of back-in-the-day pimp. Dean’s lips twitch up in a smile, it’s nice to see something that isn’t basically a computer on wheels. As he bends down to look at the tire that brought the guy in he sees the drivers rear tire is flat, but not blown, which is good. Hopefully the man didn’t drive on it too far causing the rim to bend. Dean leans in closer to the wheel and sees that the tire is pretty worn down. Getting up and moving around the car he sees the rest of the tires and sees more or less the same thing. Sighing he walks back to the garage to grab a tire jack and his tools.
“Are you picturing me? My hand wrapped around that gorgeous cock as I watch you fall apart while I lick every drop of slick falling out of your body just for me.”
Thirdly! Things are changing. I am working the "Cass's" to "Cas". Apparently it bothers people *shrugs*. I really don't give a damn, but some of my humans from our facebook group have let me know their concerns.
him and just fucking hold him.
Another loud bang comes from the door followed by Dean’s voice. “C’mon Sammy. Don’t you want to hang out with your big brother?”
“God, I’m so sorry, Cas,” Dean chokes out, dropping his arms to wrap around Cas tightly. “About all of it. Everything. If I just would’ve come home instead of going out. Or maybe if I would’ve called. I’m just – fuck! I’m so fucking sorry.”
“Dean,” he says, breathing out his name like a sigh he’s been holding in too long. It feels good to say his name again, but he hastily reminds himself that he shouldn’t be enjoying the moment. Focusing back on to the situation at hand, Castiel takes in Dean’s body language and wonders why he appears to be holding himself as if he’s some monster he’s up against.
The car’s tires squeal as he turns another corner even going recklessly fast for him. Dean’s honestly surprised the car stayed on the road, but even at this speed it doesn’t feel fast enough. There’s a feeling in his gut that is telling him that something is wrong. As he rips into the parking lot he doesn’t hesitate to park upfront, right beside his Impala.
Closing his eyes Dean takes in a deep breath through his nose as he counts to three, then slowly exhales through his mouth counting to three again. It's a breathing technique Cas taught him when he’d come over after Benny left when things had gotten bad.
Cas snakes his hand down between them, joining Dean’s fingers already wrapped around them. Castiel takes them, swiping up gathering a mixture of their precome before slowly starting out a rhythm pumping them both.
That’s right. Castiel called him.
Dean can practically feel the blood leaving his face the more he thinks about it. Sam would’ve checked for that, wouldn’t he? If anything like that was going on there would be signs or some shit, wouldn’t there? Fuck, he still is having a hard time wrapping his head around the fact that he’s a dude with a uterus and now he could be knocked up?!
Looking back now at the bond Dean and he share since meeting he realizes it isn’t typical of your typical college roommates. That probably should have been a sign with how much time they spent together, or how their lives seemed to intertwine with one another almost immediately. But, their friendship led them to where they are now.
The night before Dean has to open up the shop for the first time since he got sick; Sam sends him a text telling him that Bobby didn’t make it. He was cremated two weeks ago. Everything that the old man had left went to the both of him in some form or fashion and Sam will go over the will with him when they see each other. Dean doesn’t sleep that night.
Dean looks down between them as he feels something larger than a finger pushing against his hole. He sees Castiel’s hand wrapped around his own cock guiding it to his entrance and holy shit, there is no way that is going to fit in him! He opens his mouth to say something, but the words die on his tongue as Castiel pushes the head of his cock in, in one torturously slow movement.
“Alpha, please,” Dean doesn’t even know what he’s begging for as he whimpers again. In the back of his head he knows submitting to an alpha like this is something he swore he would never do, but another part of his mind is whispering
“Dean!” Sam’s voice breaks enough that Dean’s not startled when he feels hands grab his shoulders and drag him to his feet. “We have to go!” Sam gives him a rough shake enough for Dean to open his eyes, but it seems good enough for his brother. “The car is already loaded. Help me move Cas.”
“Let me be the judge of that.”
Castiel groans as his stomach tightens with the change of tempo. Dean’s words replay in his head as he tries to understand what he means.
“Do you have the holy water?” Castiel asks.
Dean kisses his neck once before responding with lining his dick up with Cas’ and thrusting against him. They both moan in unison as Dean takes them both in his hand, jerking them together.
“I don’t see how much his bond was for is —”
“Castiel.” Castiel blinks, letting the colors take proper form again.
After a few weeks of Benny being back, Dean is leaning into an old Toyota’s guts, trying to figure out why it’s misfiring when he the hair on the back of his neck starts standing up. He’s able to stand up straight before Benny’s face is in the side of his neck.
“Ask me again why I stay gone.” Dean steps back, away from him, and shoves his hands in his jacket pockets. He lets out a forced laugh, looking up at the starless sky. “Don’t pretend like you aren’t trying to convince yourself every day that me, the one you see every day, isn’t the one who messed you up.” Castiel opens his mouth to argue, but Dean looks away from the sky and back over at him, speaking first. “Because even though I didn’t, I still did. It might as well been me doing it.”
“You think killing all the monsters in the world are going to make things better again? You think it’s going to turn the clock and make what happened never have happened?” Castiel means for the words to come out stronger, less of a question, but his voice refuses to raise higher than a whisper.
Well hello there.
Castiel reaches across the table to Sam’s phone and pushes it towards him. “I will let you know when to stop.” Sam hesitates before reaching down and picking up his phone. Castiel gives him a little nod, trying to swallow back the quiet, steady fear starting to build up inside him. “As for your other question, as many times as it takes.”
Shifting his feet uneasily, Dean crosses his arms across his chest to keep himself from fidgeting. He can’t help feeling like he failed some sort of test not knowing who this guy is. He’s probably someone important being that the fact he’s here in a literal room of nothing.
. My brother.” He sighs and runs a hand through his hair, looking at the ceiling. “I get it. Everything has been a shit show over these past few months. Trust me, I was there. It’s been hell.” Sam’s hazel eyes look back down at him almost pleading. Castiel feels his body involuntarily twitch at the mention of the past months. “But we finally have a chance here, Cas. I’m not justifying anything that Crowley has done, because what happened to you was…” Sam shakes his head and casting a glare at Crowley. “But if you could put your issues aside for more than a few seconds and look at the bigger picture you’d see we need this bastard to help save Dean.”
“How thorough of you,” Crowley mumbles sarcastically.
Dean’s never been good at speeches, or really, talking about his feelings in general. When Castiel stares at him, almost like he use to, Dean thinks he finally got through to him. Not two seconds later Castiel storms off into his room, slamming the door behind him.
that he’s missing. Sitting up in the seat he runs a hand through his hair, tugging on the ends trying to wrack his brain. What is he missing? None of this even makes any sense. No one could even know Cas was in this town. He’d just gone from the car to the room, and he’s almost one hundred percent sure that no one even drove past their street the whole time.
Sighing, Dean pushes off the ground, sitting back on the balls of his feet once more. Cracking his neck to the side, he glances down to his wrist to see the the remaining time the girl had left has been added to his measly eighteen hours. Now he has three years and two months.
The parking lot lamp above Dean’s car gives off just enough light that he can see Castiel doing that adorable squinty eye thing he does when he’s confused about something. Dean feels his fingers twitch to reach out and smooth the lines scrunching up on his forehead, but instead he balls them up in his fist.
Castiel hates that he hasn’t thought of the purified blood until now. It was right in front of his face the whole time. The knowledge of it all was right there, but without his grace he guesses trying to hold Dean would have been out of the picture. Still, he hates that he has been so blind to put it all together until now. If the blood worked on the King of Hell, surely it would have to work on a Knight?
