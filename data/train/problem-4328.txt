Eileen wasn’t coming back.
“You’re older?”
Cas finally pushed the door open and stepped into the drizzle. He walked quickly up to the front door and turned when he reached it. He waved at Dean.
He thought instead about the future. It wasn’t such a long way off anymore. For years the universe had just thrown things at them, and he’d died, and Sam had died, and then their mom was back, and getting to that happily-ever-after, if there was going to be one, was always so far away. Now, no one was writing his story but him. No more destiny, no more meddling, just real, actual, free will.
Dean knew he was right, but he didn’t want to risk Cas running off before Benny got back. “Only if you stay here,” he said.
(See the end of the chapter for
There are a couple of reasons that these have all been dumped here. The first being that I am just sick of looking at them. I am sick of reminding myself of the storylines that will never be finished because I have become disconnected from them. The second being that I haven't really been in the SPN fandom for quite some time.. my disappointment in the ending has pushed me so far away and so I am limiting my number of unfinished Supernatual fics (down to really only my handful of almost finished WIPs) so that I am not pressured back into the fandom. I have been finding myself not as far away as I had been recently, so perhaps there is the potential of me starting more in the future - who knows?
During a rough patch, Castiel's brother, Micheal and Gabriel both get laid off from work. Money is tight back home and Castiel is
Usually Cas got on him for calling him ‘kid’ or ‘little brother’ because it was demeaning and made him feel small. After everything the two have been through, he thought his brother would show him a little more respect.
Everynight, when Cas goes home, he goes to a full house.
Anyhow, here are all of these starters. If you do find one that you are interested in, please, comment or DM me and you can have it. They are all here for the low, low price of absolutely nothing. The only thing I ask is that you give me due credit. I just felt like all of this work (almost 20k words of work) would be a waste just being deleted, so I want them offered to anyone still wandering around my ghost of an account.
I have literally no idea what this is or was supposed to be. I literally have a strong dislike for soulmate AUs and what the hell even is this?
Castiel (and siblings)'s father had been too grief-stricken to take care of their pups, so he left. Castiel was only 17 at the time and quickly became the "mother" of their family as the oldest and only omega there.
And two, this one is also inspired from a youtube edit that I actually asked the creator if I could write it out and was so excited to get their permission! I was almost fourteen and this was the first fic I ever started and I plotted most of it in a notebook that I had full of my fics that I, unfortunately, can not find for the life of me. I just recently moved and I'm afraid that it got tossed :(
Dean helps him out. And then, at the border, Dean stays. They have a really emotional good bye, because Dean's got his brother, his father, and a whole kingdom being handed down to him. So yes, they must say goodbye.
The final scene is Castiel getting two visitors behind bars. One from his older brother, who is doing well and is actually cleaned up, and the other Dean. Dean still telling him that he loves him and can't help but feeling that betrayal every time he thinks of Cas. This is many years later.
“Hey!” he called when he caught up, grabbing Micheal’s arm and spinning him around, “I’m talking to you.”
Even Becky's father disregarded her because of her now-beaten and broken mate. So they made a life of their own. They bought a little house on the outskirts of the territory and began their own family.
with hormones and urges that the pup in the omega's belly was, in fact, his.
Anyway, so yeah, just the first chapter that I started is more than 4000 words. ^_^
Chuck went out with the guards two days before the royal wedding. There had been a commotion out on the west side of the territory. Apparently, some rogue mini-pack of feral wolves had attacked a small farmer's hut there. Chuck wanted to defend his townsfolk so he went with a fleet of guards to assess the damage and scare off any remaining wolves.
Castiel is angry and wants a small ass to plow. He's tired of being ashamed of checking out boys' asses instead of girls'. He's tired of people looking down at him for his sexual preferences. Dean is beyond angry at his homophobic father and his situation now. He's running out of money and goes once more without food so that Sammy can eat. On his way home, a man in the alleyway offers him a wad of cash to suck his dick, so Dean does. Dean doesn't get off so he goes to the bar across the street to get the taste of cum off his lips. He wants to trick someone into getting him drinks so that he can go "home" drunk and just have one fucking night for himself.
“Do you really?”
Taking a deep breath, Castiel pushes the office doors open and takes a few shuffling steps into the room. His eyes flit around the room nervously before settling on a man at a desk. His hair is greying, and his face is worn, but Castiel recognizes pieces of himself in the older man’s face.
“At least we can be fucked together.”
“Cas, what in the world are you doing?”
Castiel can't keep himself from laughing, his cheeks turning red when she comes back into view. She raises a quizzical brow at him, a small frown on her face, "Are you laughing at me, boy?"
When they get into the car to head home, Dean doesn’t start the engine. He just sits there and stares out the windshield. The fluorescent lights of the diner cast a pale glow into the parking lot. A couple that was eating a few booths away from them exits the diner and walk to their car, hand in hand.
“Doesn’t look like it.”
“Hi,” Castiel melts into Dean as his arms snake around Castiel’s hips. “I missed you.”
"All I have is forty, but I'll pay it off."
Shit – did he leave the needle out or did he put it back in the bag? Castiel pauses, slumping against the closed door to look around the bathroom, heavy-lidded eyes scanning the floor for any evidence left behind. It seems that he did successfully clean up his mess, but that’s when he notices the empty toilet paper roll. He could be a bad roommate and not replace it, but he’s feeling extra useful today. The least he can do is replace the roll.
“You have to talk about it eventually.”
“Sure, Dean.”
*****
“Winchester,” Mr. Henricksen’s voice is firm, with a twinge of impatience; it cuts right into Dean’s thoughts. He takes a few steps until he stands in front of Dean’s desk. “Can you please tell me the formula to find the inverse of a matrix?”
“Well, uh, I tried to raid the medicine cabinets earlier, but you did a pretty good sweep of them. I couldn’t find an errant aspirin, let alone a benzo.”
Castiel isn’t prepared for the massive hug that Sam gives him as soon as they make it outside. Even though he’s sort of kept in contact with Sam, Castiel forgets that Sam has nearly doubled in size and then some since high school.
“Oh,” Castiel’s eyes go wide and a smirk replaces his blank expression, “So, we’re
There’s a tight dryness in Dean’s throat that just isn’t going away. He tries clearing it, “Cas, I think I’m gonna go jump in the shower…D’you, um, need me to do you?
“Of course,” Taking the book from Dean’s hand, Castiel smirks. “I’ll do anything for a fan.”
Castiel’s voice, thick with wine and lost hope, makes Dean’s heart lurch every time. He can’t seem to forgive himself for what he did. For lying and running away rather than owning up to his choices, and just loving Cas the way he was meant to love him. But now he’s been given a second chance. He doesn’t want to mess up this time around. So, when he does tell Cas that he loves him, Dean wants it to be perfect. Beyond a reasonable doubt.
Hesitantly, Dean goes, leaving Mary and Castiel alone. They light the candles and go out into the living room. The entire room erupts into song and Dean blushes beneath the warm glow of the candles.He blows them out and smiles. There's a lot of socializing and laughter. Castiel leans against a wall and watches the commotion of the party.
“Dean, honey, is that you?” Mary walks into the living room, wearing her oven mitts. She waves him forward, “I was worried you’d miss dinner. C’mon, your father and brother are already waiting at the table.”
“Watch the language. Dean, listen to me.” Dean turns on his heels, heading for the door, Henricksen shouts after him. “Winchester! I’m talking to you!”
He’s alone again, always alone. It will always come back to this. He lets out a bloodcurdling cry, but no one is listening. Why does it always come back to this? He wonders if he sinned in a past life, causing him to have such misfortune now. Perhaps he killed a man or two. That seems like a fair trade for all the pain he carries in his heart.
“I was gonna tell you,” Dean says as he enters the room, wondering if he should even bother defending himself. “I just needed to find a good time…and I hadn’t seen a good time yet.”
The little shop is located downtown, near the theater, which brings in a lot of business. Today is Saturday, the day of Pacifica's beautiful Farmer's Market. It was with reluctance that Castiel agreed to work the Market shift, but he knew Missouri needed the help and he had no excuses. So now he finds himself scratching behind Skywalker's ears as he sorts through the new shipment by his feet. Missouri is going to be excited to see that they can put the new books out so that the Market rush crowd will see them.
There is only the sense of an epic and total loss.
Castiel shifts awkwardly on the couch, “Where’s Dean?”
“Me too.”
Kissing the fresh bruise on Dean’s skin, he smiles devilishly at him, “What was that?”
Castiel interrupts, “Jo, it’s swarmed with Croats. If you go down there, you won’t make it out.”

Dean’s back hits the wall as the tears blur his vision; he falls to the floor in a heap. The room feels desolate, ugly, and painful. Slamming his fist on the floor, venting something between rage and frustrated agony, Dean feels the sharp pain of glass cutting into his hand, leaving him with nothing to do but to cry out. His entire body is shaking with sobs and he curses himself for being so fucking weak.
“You’re scared.”
Castiel kisses the side of Dean’s head, running his hands down the other man’s bare back and pulling him closer, under the covers. They touch like this on rainy days when they know they won’t be expected downstairs before 10 A.M. and they can enjoy the crash of rain on the old roof, streaming down the window in a cascade of glass and water. A good storm will drown out any noise.
“Hey,” Dean smiles and leans in to hug her.
“How are you, Dean?”
“You might be a little anxious at first, but you’ll settle down.” Dean’s voice gets closer as he takes a seat beside Cas, and it reminds Castiel that this is not the voice he fell in love with. He can longer hear Dean’s soul, vibrant and powerful, in the acoustics of it. Castiel leans into Dean’s arms as they wrap around him, pulling him close until he rests his head on Dean’s chest. His heart settles instantly. Dean’s chest moves as he exhales, “Cas?”
Sliding his hands down the planes of Dean's chest, he pops the button and undoes the zip on Dean's jeans while the older boy continues marking up his chest. Eventually, Dean pulls away to yank off his boxers and jeans, tossing them aside and sauntering over to the shower to turn it on. Castiel gazes at Dean's naked form, indulging in the beauty of it.
*****
He moves on to the bookshelf where he accidentally knocks a snow globe to the floor; it shatters in a watery heap of glass at his feet. Stepping over the mess, Dean moves to the bed. He throws the blankets and comforter off, half expecting to find Cas lying there beneath the sheets. Upon seeing the empty mattress, Dean yells in rage and shoves it off the frame.
Laughing and crossing his arms over his chest, Dean’s grin widens as he leans back against the booth, “No, it’s not. The Hawaiian pizza is your favorite, I would know.”
It’s supposed to sound threatening, but his threat soon tails off into a small plea that leaves him wishing that he could withstand this moment in time without any future scars.
With a small smile, Cas pats Dean’s hand, “That’s okay, too.”
Dean falters for a moment. The anger diminishes and something new replaces it. Castiel doesn’t know the word for this emotion, but he has seen it before. It is as old as time. “Dunno why I tried to stop you. I should’ve known this would happen anyways,” Dean mutters with a resigned sigh, staring at Castiel like he is a stranger. Crestfallen, or something close to it. Castiel is confused, but then it hits him. It all clicks together, forming a clearer picture.
So, it was a shock to everyone when Dean started slipping up senior year. It was little things at first, but then he’d forget to do something like a thirty- or forty-point assignment. Those bigger things caught some attention. Specifically, Gordon’s attention, because finally! Something is finally wrong with him! Yet, he manages to save himself every freaking time – that goddamn charming bastard. So, once again, Dean’s possible imperfections go unnoticed and forgotten, and Gordon continues to be second best.
Years have past, Castiel has grown and stayed unmated the whole time, unable to move past his feelings for the young prince.
Prince Dean is the one to find Castiel after the low life alpha leaves him there. The alpha comforts the omega, ignoring his own urges. The prince then sees Castiel home personally.
Until Castiel gives birth and the baby doesn't smell nor share any resemblance to the young prince. Castiel is
And with that, the older of the two shoved Cas - the teenager stumbling back into a bunch of people who just pushed him back - and walked away faster.
There was the following comment attached to this starter...
He threw the container down, he could see that it was a little dirty now. He stopped and stared at the rest of the spilled fries on the pavement of the sidewalk. He swallows thickly, his stomach’s hunger screaming at him, and he bent over and picked the container back up. He tossed the fries back into it and dumped the rest of them in his mouth.
I believe this is my very first Wincest thing ever and it was inspired by a youtube edit I saw with the song mentioned.
This edit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DIjNA5VwG7yE%26list%3DLLo2bXpkiADkzcIKVgVqah1A%26index%3D9&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1618369381701000&usg=AOvVaw34-3NNEq6hp5QBmzoFaNWW
Castiel is causing a scene, already inebriated and upset, about how there's nothing wrong with being gay. After his outburst, Dean approaches him and admits that he, too, is angry at the world's discrimination. They have aggressive, angry sex at the seedy motel room Castiel had managed to get with the little funds he had.
{25}-Micheal: alpha (Castiel's half brother)
I had the following note attached to this one...
This starter is probably confusing, but I actually have a funny story behind this!
Not me stopping in the middle of a sentence again...
The King and Chuck's younger brother, Zachariah, had beat Chuck severely and then chased the pair out of the town. If they ever came back, they would be killed. So they left and never looked back.
Castiel goes with Gabriel as his only companion, deciding to leave his child and siblings back home. They travel back to the Kingdom of Lawrence.
Eventually, Chuck went home and prepared for his wedding, but he wasn't as excited about it anymore. He didn't click with Naomi as well and he actually got a little depressed. He decided to go back to the last place he was happy to try and get happier for the upcoming celebration. He went back to the small hut on the west side of town. He met Becky again and she was just perfect. During this second meeting, their eyes glowed and Chuck very well knew what it meant.
Castiel Novak is 21 and has been shunned by his really religious family for being gay. He came out two weeks before the beginning of the story and he had his bags packed that night. Of course, this only pisses him off and makes him an angry person. Now he has to get a paying job and find a way to live on his own.
{7}-Samadriel&Hannah: pups (twins) (full siblings)
Castiel thought.
and do it unprotected. Because Castiel is in heat, it doesn't seem like actual rape, the angst and horribleness comes after the alpha leaves.
Micheal, Raphael, and Gabriel came into the family when Castiel's mom mated his dad. But then his parents stayed together and had Castiel, Balthazar, Anna, and the twins. The twins were only 4 when their mom died.
logo and he thought of heaven. It was on the front of the fry container that was in his brother’s hand. Micheal carried that and nothing else. Most of their stuff was squared away two streets down.
It was later that night that Cas got back to their camp. He had watched the sun set on his way back from the library where he stood out there and begged for change. Of course, he didn’t get much. He couldn’t do anything special that got people’s attention.
He ate them as quickly and easily as he could and tried not to think about where they were coming from. He was too hungry to be picky at this point.
Maybe a series?
One, I stopped writing in the middle of the sentence and Idk why that bugs me so much.
This one is explicit! NC-17 warning!!
Except, unlike the movie, they actually succeed. I want Castiel and the gang to make the major steal (from the boarding school) on the night of prom. They all adore Cas by then so they make Dean/Cas two kings!! It's special and warms Cas's heart. Except, he still makes off with the money that night and he takes off. Balthazar (already finding someone to love) decides to stay. The other three take off and give their older siblings the money.
This is one of the longer starters, which I have no memory of writing, of course.
Cas’s stomach growled and twisted painfully at the thought of those fries. This golden, grease-soaked, and salty sticks of cooked potatoes. It’s been a little over two days since he’s eaten anything that wasn’t a bigger than a bite. He wasn’t even sure if his brother was going to share, but damn was Cas hungry.
Cas jogged a couple of steps to catch up to his brother, elbowing people to get through them. They were heading in the direction where their current camp was. Castiel knew the way - he’s lived in his city his entire life - but that didn’t mean he wanted to lose Micheal.
But anywho, I strongly believe in the boundary of real life and fiction. It's how I can write stuff like incest and go to sleep with a guilt-free conscious because I know that the characters are not real and never will be real. Well, apparently my past self thought it was okay to write about real people (CHILDREN even-) in a setting like this. This is a starter that I will GLADLY abandon...
Days or weeks later, Dean finds Castiel again. Finds his number (because naturally they took the money and ran) and tells him how bitterly disappointed he is in Cas. "I thought you were better than this. The school needed that money" speech. (MAYBE THE SCHOOL IS KIND OF LOSING FUNDS AND THIS WAS THEIR LAST HOPE, THIS PROGRAM TO ALLOW DELINQUENTS IN WAS ALSO A BENEFIT FOR THEM.)
{23}-Raphael: alpha (half brother)
(Dean should strengthen the laws that protect omegas. Alpha's shouldn't be allowed to rape an omega because they are in heat)
OMG IM SCREAMING RIGHT NOW, THIS IS SOOOOO BAD.
Castiel (MAL), Balthazar (JAY), Anna (EVIE), and Gabriel (CARLOS) come over. Each of them having older siblings - Micheal, Raphael, Uriel, and Lucifer - telling them that evil is better. Stealing and lying is the way to live. They want to get their younger siblings to steal as much as money as they can to bring home so they can live richly.
{21}-Gabriel: beta(half brother)
Micheal threw his arm up, narrowly clipping Cas in the chin with his elbow, and glared at his little brother. “I spent it, okay. Now fuck off!”
{3}~(child) Uriel: pup
{19}~(wife) Hester: beta
I think this started as an experiment of me trying to get into the psyche of these characters by putting them into a very emotional setting and just seeing what happens... the only thing is that this document dated back to when I wasn't even sixteen years old and I DEFINITELY did not have the maturity it would take to write something this powerful. So there it sat, for years...
This, right here, is my very first ever smut scene. Like very first. Like, young (16-17) year old me finally venturing out to write smut and THIS is what I did. Ahhhh. Also, Im pretty sure it's supposed to be the smut scene from the previous starter's universe, I found them separately. So I must have written it back when I was working on like two or three fics and could separate scenes with different documents.
Descendants AU! I'm thinking Badboy!Cas is from a detention center with older siblings that are trying to teach their "evil" onto the younger siblings. Maybe the older siblings are adults who live in the slums and are just generally nasty people?
Bile, thick and potent, clawed its way up Cas’s throat. “What?!” he gurgled. He swallowed the bite that was stuck in his mouth because it was better than puking everywhere. “Where the hell did the money go I got us?!”
Here is a collection of Supernatural fanfics that have been clogging up my files. Not a single one is finished and most are barely starters, (where some of them are damn-near full chapters). They are reminders of empty promises to myself and all that I haven't continued. I have the real nasty habit of starting something and then never touching it again.
So eventually Dean starts to notice the omega and how his father treats his staff poorly. And so Prince Dean starts to treat them more like equals, taking a slight notice to the only omega worker in the castle; Castiel.
Overall Summary:
Eventually, Castiel gets enough money that he can take himself, his pup, his little siblings, and what few belongings they had, and leave. They can leave the city, leave the kingdom.
No one took pity on a boy like him.
Castiel's Family&Age:
Well anyway, I'm also kind of bitter because this is another one that was more thoroughly plotted out in my notebook of fanfics. So I'm pretty sure it's lost forever :(
Here is the Kingdom of Lawrence. John Winchester is the king and his two alpha sons, Sam and Dean.
accept the heir. So Castiel and his family move into the castle. They live a life of luxury.
Castiel wants to take Dean's spot as prom king so that he can rub in everyone's faces that even deliquinets can become popular. Then, of course, he wants to steal his anonymous donor's money so that him and his older brother - Micheal - can live rich.
This early on a Saturday, there wasn’t much traffic. The drive was easy, and thankfully the rain had let up a little by the time they pulled into Dean’s driveway.
“What if it isn’t?”
Dean was fairly certain Al didn't mean that in a well-wisher kind of way. "So I just sit and wait."
When they got to the scene, the local law enforcement had the place taped off. The attack had happened a day ago, but the house was still a crime scene for the time being. There was an officer stationed by the front door.
Dean didn’t like the sudden tension in the room. “Do you remember going to get me?” he asked, trying to move on to something else.
"Who's this?" Dean asked, brow furrowed.
Cas studied the picture for a moment. “Are you saying you think I’m pretty?”
“And the first thing on the agenda after that was to get you back.” Dean’s face is so open now. Cas can’t remember ever seeing it look like that. “I couldn’t let you leave without telling you I love you too.”
Jack nodded, turned his attention to the barrier in the distance. “I think people want to be together.”
"Oh I don't think so," the woman said, stepping closer to Sam. "I am."
Cas shrugged. He scratched Miracle behind her ears. “It gets dark enough here I wanted to try some long exposure shots with a new lens.”
“You okay?” Lisa asked.
Dean was pretty sure if he already had a date, he didn’t need to watch the dog to get more dates any time soon. “Don’t want to. Just don’t mind if I have to.”
Cas whirls to find Dean, once again, standing just a little ways off. The distance is short, perhaps ten feet, but Dean doesn’t cross it. Instead, he eyes the blade in Cas’ hand.
Yeah, another few minutes won’t hurt anything. “I love you too, Cas.”
Blank.
"You're welcome, then," Beckett said with a half smile. "I guess."
“Bullshit.” Dean’s leaning further forward now, the concern on his face mingling with frustration and hurt. “You told me the Empty would take you when you were truly happy, right? Then you told me-” Dean cuts off and has to visibly reel in the emotion on his face. When he continues, his voice wavers, a vibrato so slight Cas only notices because of how much he’s listened to Dean speak. “You told me you love me. And you died for it. And now you can’t decide whether to look at me.” Dean shakes his head, but his eyes are locked on Cas’ despite the misty look in his eye. “What the fuck
"Sorry kid, can't do it," Al said.
He didn’t tell anyone else what had happened or what had brought him to Lisa’s. He caught wind of rumors that said he’d been in Afghanistan, and he didn’t care enough to correct anyone. But Lisa knew, at least part of it. She’d been freaked out when Dean had told her, and he couldn’t blame her for that. He’d thought she’d kick him out and tell him never to come back, but she hadn’t. She wanted to help. She came up with an explanation that was enough to keep Ben satisfied without freaking him out.
"Yeah, Cas," the other man said, brow furrowed in confusion and concern. He held his hand up to his chin. "About so high? Wears a trench coat and always manages to have his tie on backwards?"
"I know," Dean said sadly.
Cas is on his back. The weight of Dean’s arm across his chest is comforting. He reaches up and takes Dean’s hand in his own and lets himself believe the promise as he drifts to sleep.
"Over here," Beckett said.
"Oh boy," he said to himself. This did not seem like a situation he wanted to be in, but he did what he always did in a new timeline: he investigated.
And now, Dean was sitting up in the waiting room, rubbing his head. He looked around at the blank walls, studying everything silently. It was a little rectangular room with a door on one of the shorter sides. Dean was sitting on a padded bench that seemed more like a cot the more he thought about it. There was a single chair on the other side.
“Yeah,” Dean said. He furrowed his brow and studied his brother. “Your dog pulled me right to him.”
"Can't I go have a taste?" a young one asked, looking up to a woman who must have been his mother.
“Can’t? Can’t what?”
No, not agitated. He wasn’t agitated. He was angry.
Every day with Ellen is a blessing, but the clock is running out.
Sam shrugs, “I think it’s about some party.”
John squints at Cas and huffs a humorless laugh, “That’s one of Bobby’s adoptees.” He lowers his gaze back to Dean, his eyes dark, emotionless, “I’ve seen enough foster kids to know that they rarely are any good.”
Gathering his things, Sammy gets out of the car and leaves Dean alone with his thoughts which is the last thing he could possibly want right now. Minutes pass, and Dean finally decides to just go to his locker earlier than usual. As he walks through the hall, Gordon sidles up beside him. He smiles obnoxiously and flings a loose arm over Dean’s shoulder.
It’s been tense lately. They are dealing with a doomsday crisis in the not-so-distant future. The remaining fragments of Castiel’s grace unravel and break away with every hunt they go on. Dean must live with the horrible fact that Lucifer is currently wearing his brother. The Croatoan virus hasn’t appeared yet, but Dean says it will within the next year. Considering everything, they both need a release.
“He’s a runner; I just thought you should know that,” Naomi pats his knee, and he shifts away in disgust, as if her touch held some unknown contagion. “But Castiel always does excellent in his studies and he never fails to follow orders.”
Castiel feels the confidence building now, a faint reminder of his strength and his ability to follow through when the time comes. He was a soldier once before, and he is still, in a way; now he just serves a different purpose. He serves a man, not God.
It is a home.
Silence ensues, leaving Dean feeling just as empty as he had been when Cas was gone. He still hurts. Instead of confronting the obvious problems, Dean decides to find a motel and get a room; he’s too tired to drive all the way back home and Cas looks like he needs a fucking shower.
"It's a guilty pleasure of mine..." Smiling, Dean pulls away with a content sigh. He sits at the end of the bed, pulling Castiel to settle between his spread legs. Resting his head on Dean's forehead and closing his eyes, Castiel shifts his hips against Dean's. He pays close attention to Dean's sharp intake of breath when he does it again a little more purposefully.
Dean pulls two large bottles of bleach off the shelf and mutters, “Next time, we gotta get two fucking carts. Go grab another cart, babe, and get the medicine we need from the pharmacy section, y’know, like the cold and flu shit. Ibuprofen. Gas-X. Stock up on a bunch of it, because this might be out last run before the outbreak.”
"Cas..." Dean's breathy groan only reveals his desperation and disbelief.
He does not want to go back downstairs. He does not want to eat dinner with everyone. He does not want to open presents. He does not want to sit across from the one thing he wants and be constantly reminded that he cannot have it.
And then, Cas’ hands are on him, shedding the layers of Dean’s clothing until they are both completely naked. Gently, Dean slips his fingers out of Cas and moves upwards until their bodies are flush against each other.
It wasn’t
“Dean?” he asks quietly.
“Good,” Jack replied with a nod.
“What’s the occasion?” Sam asked when they sat down at the table.
Cas grinned at him.
Cas immediately stiffened. "That's not Dean," he said.
The bunker was a headquarters of sorts, full of any information a hunter could possibly need when they were stumped on a case, and the information was only a phone call away. Hunters could stop by when they passed through, and there was always a room and food for them. Recently there were more and more of these drop-ins as word spread. The more hunters dropped by, the more the bunker had an atmosphere not unlike the one Harvelle’s had had, back in the day, or so Dean said. It was slow going, but the life was turning into one that wasn’t quite as lonely, wasn’t quite as isolated.
They walked down the hall and Sam stopped at his door, hesitant to open it. “Hey Cas?”
. “Dean?” he asked again.
"You need to get back to that room," Al said. "If you're not there, we can't leap."
Dean counted to ten to make sure he’d be able to get his words out correctly. “Cas. How do you do that?”
The next morning he woke up disoriented. His dreams were fading, but he remembered Eileen, smiling and laughing with him. The memory sent a pang through his chest, and so he didn’t bother to check his phone; he knew that if he opened it again, he’d just go back to staring at Eileen’s messages.
Cas doesn’t want to. He tells himself he doesn’t want to. But he does. And there’s so much pain in Dean’s voice that he can’t help pulling the coat down his face and cracking his eyes open.
There’s time. There’s
Dean's face hardened, no longer laughing. "Why not?" His voice was deathly calm.
He quickly pads his way down the hall and into Jo’s bedroom, waking her with a gentle shove of her shoulder. “I, um, can’t sleep. Bad dream.” She rubs her eyes wearily and nods, scooting over on the bed to make room for him. He gratefully lies down beside her, resting his head on her shoulder, “Thank you.”
Castiel shoves Gabriel off him and stands, tearing the photo from Dean and shoving it into his back pocket.
Jo shrugs, picking the pickles off her sandwich, “He has some issues, but it’s nothing my family can’t handle.” Satisfied with her food, she places the bun back on the sandwich and takes a bite. Talking around her food, she says, “He’s kind of weird. Really quiet, always says odd things. You can tell when he’s nervous because he reads the Bible.”
Ellen hands him a glass of water, “You hit your head. You tried to get up, but you fainted and fell down.”
The unsettled feeling shapes itself into anger and he finds himself biting the inside of his cheek to keep from screaming at her, “You don’t know what happened.”
She kisses Dean again, and Cas feels it - the sharp longing for the numbing effects of a pill - but he shoves the urge down. Now is not the time to be daydreaming about getting high.
The boy is still staring at him intently. Dean can feel the blood rushing to his cheeks. It must be the heating; he never blushes unless it’s hot. Geez, doesn’t the school know winter doesn’t start for two more months? He pulls at the collar of his shirt and reaches across the table to snag one of Jo’s grapes.
“Winchester! Long time no see, bud,” Gordon chides, ruffling Dean’s hair teasingly and laughing. “How’s the boyfriend?”
“I’ll get you some of the sleeping medicine I have stashed, alright?”
“Dean, I’m…”
“Where are mom and dad?”
“And how did you do that?”
At the end of the movie, almost everyone watching raises their fists along with the character who dresses like a homeless man. Castiel doesn’t understand why.
This book – this ridiculous memoir is beginning to take its toll on his psyche. He’s fucking sick of these nightmares, of taking sleeping pills and Ativan on a regular basis, of looking in the mirror and hating what he sees. Cas was doing so well before he started writing. He slept through the night and ate meals regularly. Therapy sessions had become part of his weekly schedule. A few panic attacks here and there but, for the most part, up until he came back home and started writing, he was mentally stable for the first time in ten years. It lasted all of twelve blissful months.
“Don’t say his name!” Cas yells, louder than he expected. Panicking, he pushes Dean off him and sits upright. In surrender, he hangs his head between his knees, trying to will away the fear, “I’m sorry. I just can’t.”
“So, Castiel, where you from?” Dean uses his most charming smile and meets Castiel’s stare head-on. He swears he could melt under that heated gaze.
Pulling away just enough to meet Castiel’s eyes, Dean asks, “Do you want me, Cas?”
Dean stares out the window, watching the town pass as they drive and wondering why he bothers to go to church with his family. Maybe he’ll spontaneously burst into flames for stepping onto holy ground because he’s gay.
“I don’t want to intrude.”
Dean’s eyes tear away from Castiel’s, searching the wallpaper, a fleeting, exhausted ache behind them.
Without hesitation, Dean speaks up, "One large anch-"
Pausing at the bottom of the staircase, Castiel regrets the executive decision he made to smoke his morning bowl on the porch rather than from the windowsill of his bedroom. The sky is too pretty – too open and endless – for Castiel to admire from inside the house, but is it really worth the trouble?
“I’ve never done anything with a guy before,” Dean whispers low against Castiel’s ear. It sounds so vulnerable coming out of the older boy’s mouth. Never in his life would Castiel have guessed he would see Dean so open in one day; it just seemed unrealistic.
“Touch yourself,” He murmurs to Dean, and begins unbuttoning his own shirt. He watches as Dean hesitantly takes himself in hand, stroking slowly and gazing at Castiel intently as he undresses. Castiel places his shirt on the floor and undoes his belt and jeans.
“Why’s that?” Castiel has forced himself to keep his eyes down, avoiding Dean’s gaze, but he falters and looks up.
Dean hands her the last of the silverware and reaches into the murky water to pull the plug on the drain. The water gurgles as it disappears into the black hole at the center of the sink.
“I am unlovable. Unwanted. Used,” He repeats louder, just loud enough for her to hear him. “I am forgettable.”
*****
He scoffs and shoves the sleepy boy playfully, “Make some room for me.”
“Anna? One of the Singer kids?” A kid Dean recognizes as someone on the soccer team shrugs and points to the stairs, “I saw Gordon dragging that redhead sophomore upstairs a couple of minutes ago.”
A man so determined to get things right, that everyone else must believe he will succeed.
Rising from the bed, Castiel wonders if Dean cursed himself when he woke this morning to find Castiel still in his bed. Looking at the now-empty bed, the tangled sheets, and the pile of clothes on the floor, Castiel is hit with a wave of guilt.
“You didn’t come to the afterparty for the game on Saturday night.”
His legs lift him from the bed like they have a mind of their own. As if their sole purpose is to carry him to Castiel. His hands trail up Cas’ broad shoulders, twisting in the dark locks at the base of his neck. He presses their foreheads together and says, “You are the most powerful and brilliant person I’ve ever met, and I respect you more knowing what you’ve been through, Cas. You’re a fighter.”
Castiel’s hands are on him then, grabbing hold of Dean’s tie and yanking him forward into a sloppy, open-mouthed kiss that sends Dean into a surreal headspace. If they didn’t have speeches to make and dance moves to bust, Dean wouldn’t even consider pulling away from Cas’ warm embrace, but they do have a Christmas party slash wedding reception to attend. Reluctantly extracting himself from Cas’ tight grip for the second time that night, Dean murmurs against his lips, “We can argue about it later.”
“I always knew he did, even when he was dating Jess.”
“Are your grandparents wealthy?” He shouts down the stairs, waiting for Dean to answer. Nothing follows his question, so he retreats downstairs where Dean is stocking the fridge with groceries. “Did you hear me?”
Immediately, he shuts down. He always does. No matter what, he still feels there’s no use in opening up about what happened while he was in Alistair's house. No good will come of it. He will talk about his mother and his father and anything that happened before the house, but he refuses to talk about the years he spent there. He won't do that to himself; he can't let himself relive it.
“Cas.”
“Why worry about what everyone thinks of you when you only need your own approval?”
“Then why d’you always lay down in your own bed?”
The first thing Castiel feels is Dean reaching out to slide Castiel's coat off his shoulders, squeezing his biceps as he goes. He hangs the coat on the rack off to the side and gazes at Castiel as he removes his own coat. Then Dean steps forward, crowding into Castiel's space.
*****
He spent so many hours wishing that Dean and Jo’s relationship was nothing more than something casual. He had convinced himself that this was true. But now he cannot ignore it any longer.
The words aren’t harmless. They’re loaded. They are the expectation of something more than what Castiel is able to give. He really isn’t sure what to do. The whole Michael fiasco proved to Castiel that he can’t handle that kind of contact – that kind of intimacy.
In the distance the bell rings, signaling the end of the lunch period. Cas leans over and kisses Dean chastely, “I’ll help you. Come over tomorrow and we can start a study guide for you. Okay?” The younger boy stands, straightening his trench coat and collecting his bag.  He smiles at Dean and heads out of the dugout, leaving Dean to wonder how he ever got so lucky.
“Let me finish, please.” Cas gives him a steady look, eyes brimming with tears, and urges on, “Meg and I wanted to protect Andy. I acted out more and more so Alistair would punish me and leave Andy untouched, but we couldn’t protect him forever… One day, Meg came home with a gun – I never asked her where she got it – but we hid it in my bedroom, and we waited. A few days later, Andy said something about the abuse to a teacher, but we weren’t pulled from the house right away. Someone made a mistake and it got back to Alistair that Andy said something, so when we got home from school that day, he separated us, and he, um, he tortured and killed them first.”
“I know you won’t,” He curls his fingers around Dean’s hip and steadies himself there, allowing himself to enjoy this moment. “I can’t help it when the others come back, that’s all. When everyone else who has hurt me comes back and haunts me. I can’t control them.”
Cas wipes at his face, trying to cover up that he'd been crying, “I didn’t hear you.”
Castiel greets her with a smile and takes his seat on the tall stool behind the counter, "Great, thank you for asking."
When the team arrived back from the mission, Dean was immediately placed in the makeshift infirmary, bloody and irritable. By the time the team was lifting him out of the back of the van on a makeshift stretcher, he was awake, groaning in discomfort but still muttering out orders. There will always be things to be done. A fearless and dedicated leader would never let a near-death experience slow him down.
"Cas?" Dean enters the Singers’ rowdy kitchen, pushing past Anna and Jo to reach Castiel. The room smells like fresh bread and spaghetti sauce, Dean’s stomach growls of its own accord. Bobby raises his hand in a hello but continues cooking as Dean moves to stand before the blue-eyed boy. "What are you doing?"
He props himself up on his elbows. "Why?"
“Adam is right, Dean-o. You aren’t here to see us,” Gabe says in a mischievous tone. “You are here for a little slice of the dark-haired, blue-eyed angel who lives on the third floor of Casa Singer.”
“I’m fine,” He lies, scratching the back of his head. “Tomorrow will be fun.”
“You said you would never leave, and you did. You told me for months that you loved me and then you took it all back. You made me believe that it was all a game.”
As they walk side by side, shuffling across the leaves and twigs littered on the sidewalk, their feet hitting the pavement in correct time, Castiel is acutely aware of their shoulders occasionally brushing. Why does he have to pinpoint every exact moment in time with Dean? All his old habits are suddenly coming back without warning, and more importantly, without Castiel’s approval.
Patting Sammy’s back and ruffling his hair, Dean grins sadly, “Right back at you, kid.”
be alone with Gordon right now. I’m going to go get her and take her home.”
Bobby stares at Castiel from across the table, “Did he eat?” He looks so hopeful, waiting patiently for an answer.
Castiel’s anxiety instantly turns to an ache at the center of his chest. He averts his eyes and walks onward, zipping past the cafeteria, until he reaches the fenced edge of the property. His breath comes out ragged like he’s been running for his life. Like he’s running out of time. His chest tightens and he covers his face with his hands, willing himself to get a fucking grip.
Cas doesn't let up, continuing to fuck Dean until he falters and comes with a gasp. He drapes his body over Dean and kisses him gently, resting his forehead against the hot skin of his chest. Lazily, he pulls out of Dean and dresses himself. He grabs a handful of napkins from the glove compartment and wipes everything down.
“It’s not so bad,” Dean can’t hide his own blush, so he lifts his head to kiss Cas. The other man responds with a hum of satisfaction before pulling away. “This reminds me of that night we played Twister; except, this time you’re on top.”
The thought detonates inside Castiel’s head like a bomb, and his body tenses under Dean’s liquid caress. Then Dean runs his hands up Castiel’s thighs, fingers ghosting over the zipper of his jeans. He bites at the edge of Castiel’s collarbone and it sends shockwaves through the former angel; it tricks him into feeling holy. Castiel melts, sinking his hips to find friction.
As if he can’t believe the words coming out of Dean’s mouth, John takes longer than necessary to decide what to say next, which only allows Dean more time to pull on his other shoe and open the front door. John’s about to unleash hell, but Dean slips out the door and slams it behind him. He runs to his car and drives away, leaving his father yelling at him from the doorway.
“Castiel, honey, open this damn door and tell me what’s wrong.”
“Dammit Dean, you ain’t gonna be the one to save him.”
Their bodies are nearly touching. Although Castiel does not perceive temperature the same way that humans do, he can feel the warmth of Dean’s body beside him. There is a pulse. A heart beating. They lay in silence for a while, lazily watching the TV screen with only mild interest. Castiel isn’t paying much attention to anything but the feeling of Dean slowly inching closer to him until their arms brush each other.
“Then stay,” Dean begs, voice cracking with desperation.
Purposefully, Cas swipes his fingers over that little bundle of nerves with just the right amount of pressure and he has Dean seeing stars. Without realizing it Dean's hand flies to his ignored dick and pumps his fist desperately. Within a matter of seconds, Cas has pulled his fingers from Dean and pinned Dean's hands above his head again. "No touching yourself either," He growls, grinding his hips down against Dean's bare cock. Dean whimpers, tipping his head back and baring his neck to Cas. He takes the hint and kisses down the column of Dean's throat, biting down where his neck meets his shoulder.
Castiel walks over to him and wipes the snow from the boy's face tenderly. "You're so beautiful," He murmurs, realizing how the white of the snow illuminates the freckles across Dean's nose and cheeks. "Thank you for bringing me here."
“Okay.” Castiel nods, ignoring the rising anxiety within him. He would never do this normally, but it seems right. This moment feels right. “Dean?”
The room grows quiet at his words, and everyone takes a second to stop and look at the two boys. Startled, Castiel looks taken aback by Dean’s bluntness but nods in agreement. He stands and follows Dean's retreating form through the back door.
“That’s not true!” Shouting from within the car, Jo pulls her head out of the trunk and begins to carry some boxes inside, “We don’t have the space for a dog right now, but we can get one once we get a bigger place. Do you honestly think that we could take care of dog, my mom, and ourselves? C’mon Sam, seriously.”
But Dean just glares at him and Castiel gives a sharp nod before throwing back two pills and swallowing them dry. They feel lodged in his throat, but he's paying more attention to Dean’s fingers skimming over his bare stomach. Dean pokes gently at freshly formed blue circles as well as the older fading brown ones. A gentle finger traces over a line of pale-yellow spots. He whispers, “Who gave you these older bruises?”
"I've got you, Cas. I'm here." Closing his eyes, he feels Dean graze his teeth over Cas' nipples as he pushes his finger in up to the first knuckle. Involuntarily, Castiel clenches and whimpers as Dean pushes in fully. Trying his best to relax his body, he manages not to fight the intrusion, focusing instead on Dean licking and biting down the expanse of his chest.
There’s a long pause, because honestly, Dean doesn’t know what the hell Cas is gonna do when he leaves. Jo won’t be around to keep him company, Sam’s gonna be busy with school and varsity basketball, and Anna isn’t necessarily Cas’ favorite person to be around. No one at school talks to Cas except for Dean and his friends. People just don’t understand the kid. Dean doesn’t blame them; Cas’ is weird and awkward, he stares too much, and he doesn’t sugar coat things. He’s just different.
Bascially, I wanted to write a fic where Cas is a 15 year old senior (at fourteen I thought that was the MOST impressive thing ever) and what happens when his siblings hate him and he meets the senior bad boy. Like, I had this whole plot thing planned out and I swear it ends with like Cas getting addicted to substances and actually shoots someone over drugs and then Dean (the bad boy and his lover, of course) goes to Cas's family after their son and brother is arrested and explains to them that he didn't mean for things to go that far and he hadn't known they even went that far. It was super angsty, right?
Cas saw the golden “M” of the
Except that the VERY FIRST draft of this plot (which I found in a word document from YEARS ago) was actually a freaking Twilight fic!! Like, I was originally going to write this plot as a Twilight fanfic. HA

He was set to marry the princess, Naomi. They had met and deemed compatible enough. Chuck was looking forward to it because once he had his bride, he could take his aging father's place as king. Everything was perfect.
So usually how these happen is that I listen to a really good song, I get a good idea and write it down, and then I never touch it again. That's it. Anywho, part of me really likes this idea so if someone picks it up, please be serious about it! And link me to your fics because I wanna read themmm.
“Dean, that’s not a –”
When they’re alone, camped out in a McDonald’s parking lot so Dean can take a quick nap, Castiel asks, “Why don’t you want to be with your brother, Dean?”
Castiel skids to halt in front of the bookstore and chains his bike to the rack with clean, methodical motions. Wiping his clammy hands on his pants, he spins around and unlocks the store, setting his backpack behind the counter. The store is quiet, except for the sound of the two cats running for the door at the chime of the bell tied to the handle. The fluffy black cat – Vader – slinks its way into the room, while the slim grey kitten – Skywalker – bolts to Castiel and claws at the hem of his pants. Snagging the kitten in his arms, he cradles the little fur-ball and plops him down on top of the counter. Skywalker rolls around on the desk, mewling sweetly as Castiel opens the register and turns on the lights, humming to himself.
“It’s fine.” Castiel tries to smile, “It’s all fine.”
“Are there any schools in California that you applied to?”
“I’m sorry,” Dean murmurs into Cas’ thick hair, tightening his arms around the shivering boy. Relief washes over him with every steady breath coming from Cas’ lungs as Dean realizes that he finally got Cas to tell him something. Sometimes he will drop little hints about his past but this, this is a huge step forward, or at least that’s what Dean hopes. He rubs Cas’ back until he seems to have fallen into a relatively deep sleep, then he drapes a blanket over the naked boy before shuffling into the small bathroom.
Castiel returns the smile, “I’ll consider it.”
Castiel gazes at the tiny cottage through the mist of rain, wondering what he will find behind the shiny oak door. They make a run from the driveway to the front door, but Dean fumbles with his keys before finally unlocking it. By the time they slip inside, they’re both drenched, so Castiel carefully peels off his sweater and hangs it by the front door. He places the box of pizza they picked up from the parlor down the street on the coffee table. Dean flicks on the lights, removing his shoes and jacket.
“May I have this dance?”
“Probably,” Castiel nods, chewing at the corner of his lower lip. “I’m sure this dinner is going to drudge up a few things, but we can talk about it later, okay?”
Jo’s face crinkles into an uncomfortable smile, “I don’t know, guys.”
“We should be fine going through the North end,” Castiel assures him, reading the notes made at the bottom of the map. “There’s one possible nest along the way, but we can likely get around it.”
This place is any therapist’s dream office. It has comfortable chairs and stupid trinkets and fucked up patients. Perfect.
Dean’s movements falter at the request, and Castiel instantly overanalyzes the hesitation, wondering if it’s still too soon. It doesn’t feel like it’s too soon; they’ve been touching each other in every way imaginable for the last few weeks, but nothing that required any removal of clothing. It’s been strictly PG-13, as Dean would put it.
“Don’t worry,” Castiel reassures him, caressing the cut along Dean’s brow gingerly. “She knew.”
With the room illuminated, he straightens himself and backs up towards the door, preparing to make a hasty exit.
Dean and Castiel were up late last night discussing a plan to recovery, or something as close to it as possible. Dean understands – they all have their vices – it is the apocalypse after all. Weed is a “maybe” as Dean puts it. It’s natural, it helps Castiel sleep, it’s better than drinking or popping pills. It’s better than heroin. But, right now, Castiel needs a clean break. Pills, heroin, weed, alcohol – all of it. Gone.
“It’s over,” Dean murmurs, reaching out his hand to grasps Castiel’s as it dangles at his side. “I’m not seeing anyone else.”
It doesn’t surprise him that Ellen knows about Dean. She sees all, and perhaps that is a good thing. She sees the good and the bad; the right and the wrong; the broken and the beautiful, yet she still unconditionally cares and loves with every single cell in her body.
It’s bothered me for a really long time that I never finished this story. I spent so much time writing it in high school. Now, I’m a 23-year-old graduate student. Honestly, it’s kind of perfect that I can write this section now. The characters are in their mid-twenties now, and so am I.
There isn’t time for Castiel to say goodbye to Dean’s parents; he’s being dragged by the elbow up some stairs and into Dean’s room in a matter of seconds. Dean cautiously closes the bedroom door behind him, eyes trained on Castiel. He’s not sure, but Castiel thinks he sees
“I’m sorry, Cas. I was selfish and I didn’t wanna give you up,” Dean whimpers as if he’s holding back tears. “Gordon saw us one night in the locker room, and he held it over my fucking head for months. Then, I caught Gordon attacking Anna that night and he swore he was gonna out me to my dad if I told anyone, but I couldn’t just keep that a secret. We had spent so much time trying to keep it quiet, and fuck, Cas, you knew how bad it would be if he found out!”
She hits his shoulder playfully before pointing to the sink. “Wash your hands and go sit down; dinner’s ready,” She chimes as she pulls out a meatloaf from the oven.
“You can move the furniture around if you want; you aren’t sharing a room. Normally, when we have a full house, each kid has a roommate. You got lucky.”
Jo shoves a pillow in his face, “Oh, cut the crap, Winchester. I’ve known for years. You don’t have to put on the hetero-shield with me.”
Jo gets up to find that she has slept the entire night alone, which is unusual considering that Cas comes to sleep with her almost every night. Maybe he slept through for once, or maybe he had a particularly bad spell and decided to leave her out of it. Either way, she goes to check on him to make sure everything is alright.
Cas shook his head, and he looked a little embarrassed too. “Don’t be sorry. I didn’t know.”
The word is shouted, not from nearby. Cas turns toward the voice, his heart leaping, even now, at the sound.
"Cas," Sam said. When Cas didn't respond, he stepped over to the Angel and put a hand on his shoulder. "Cas, what is it?"
Cas doesn’t look up right away. He takes another bite of his eggs, then one of his toast. He takes a sip of the coffee in front of him, but makes a face at how bitter it is. “I’m fine,” he promises. He risks looking up at Dean, who doesn’t look like he believes it.
The woman's expression changed from confused to condescending. "I thought that was why you were here," she said.
“You wanted to see my pictures from the first couple of mornings.” Cas pulled a small plastic case from his pocket. “The SD cards are here. I can show you them on the computer. If you still want to see them.”
The pictures of the stars were the biggest difference. The originals had been dark, but with a sort of blue tint. The stars had been small, visible but not brilliant. In the edited pictures, it was almost like the atmosphere wasn’t there at all, like the stars had come out just for Cas and his camera.
Dean and Miracle made it back to the house exactly five minutes before Sam rang the bell.
“Dark enough?”
But those words were always too hard to say out loud. He could have said them in the barn yesterday. He could have taken Sam up on his offer to stop and figured a way to eek out a few minutes alone with Cas. He could have just gone to Cas’ room this morning.
“A little.”
“Ready to go?” Sam asked, his expression carefully neutral. He looked comically tall next to the children, and Cas couldn’t help smiling.
"They have a habit of not staying dead?" Beckett asked, a little freaked out.
Al sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. "I'm getting too old for this."
“Say something, Cas.”
“Sometimes. I do mainly just do it in my free time though.”
“If my calculations are correct, it’s been just over four years,” Cas said.
“Happy anniversary.”
“I don’t have any other clothes,” Cas says. The last time he had changed clothes, they’d been borrowed anyway. A full wardrobe hadn’t been high on his priority list when he could just use his powers to tidy his appearance.
Frankly solitude was preferable. Stretching to his left and right, Dean could see racks like his going on as far as he could see. On each was a person, their souls glowing around their bodies – some so white as to be almost blue, others turning grey at the edges, and still others that were more darkness than light. Facing each person was a demon, each different, each deadly. There were claws and teeth and horns and spikes and Dean couldn’t comprehend what they looked like.
"I was too much of a reminder," Cas said.
“Never,” Dean spat.
“Any time.”
Instead, he wrapped his arms around Cas and held him as close as he could. “Cas,” he managed, the lump in his throat threatening to spill over into full-on sobs. “You’re back.”
Dean’s response came in quickly. He was on the way home.
Dean scrubbed at his eyes. "What happened?"
