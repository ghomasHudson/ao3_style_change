at him, like he could see right through Dean. "You realized there was
__________________
The day that Dean knew Cas was something more than he'd ever had was mere weeks after their introduction. That day, their usual routine was immediately derailed when Cas managed to intercept Dean before he made it to the beach. The boy hopped into the car, his canvas bag in tow, and started barking out directions for Dean to follow. Cas announced they were going for a drive, and right then, Dean knew, for a fact, he would take them wherever Castiel asked.
Dean hadn’t cared where he was going when he found this place, just drove until he was far away that his surroundings were less familiar. He had been driving for about twenty minutes when he pulled into the parking lot of some local dive. It was just another night, another bar, another small dance floor, hopefully, another insignificant intoxicated hookup. Just what he needed to forget, an easy distraction from the panic settled in his stomach.
Cas shook his head furiously, some flecks raining down from where they had snuck into his hair. He felt like sinking through the floor.
“Before you say no...” Dean started.
was the one who was pushing this, and fuck he wanted even though he can’t have, not for real the way he dreamed about. Maybe a stronger man would have laughed it off, playfully shoving Castiel’s legs off of his, deescalate this entire situation for the sake of
The waves were choppy that afternoon, a side effect of the occasional summer wind. The rough water conditions combined with the week's overcast weather report to make the perfect day for a deserted beach. An empty beach was the best type; Dean loved to stretch out and feel the sunshine warming his face. He always picked up an irrational number of extra freckles after a good summer outside, but his love for the beach outweighed any dumb teasing. It was his happy place.
Dean really didn’t want to get into that right now.
Dean wore a small amulet around his neck, a protective piece he’s had for nearly as long as Cas has known him. Castiel stepped around to stand behind the other boy and brushed the neckline of his shirt back. Dean shivered a little at the contact. Cas let his fingers linger a few seconds longer than he should on Dean’s neck while spinning the chain around to view the clasp.
better than
Dean’s mind went straight to another encounter they’d faced that day.
She saw you tending to me and assumed that you were my partner.
If anything, the strangely vulnerable position Cas sat in only served to further prove his power, looking just as holy sitting criss-cross on a motel bed as when his wings were out in their full glory.
“Pyromaniac.”
“So, Christmastide,” Dean spoke to break the silence, clapping lightly.
Castiel blinked a few times, his eyes scanning Dean's face. "This isn't a joke, right?" He felt terrible for asking the second Dean's face fell, the boy's green eyes widening in slight shock.
himself pine over for the last years; that's how far out of reach Dean had been. Between the Catholic boarding school outlook on sexuality and the dozens of girls in their grade that would have gladly taken Cas's place, he never thought it would be worth even letting himself look at other boys like that. Castiel had always been teased mercilessly for being gay, even before he'd known he was himself, and so football captains like Dean were much further out of his league than he would like to admit.
"But, uh, if you wanted, I have a joint or two in my bag?"
Castiel was not in the mood to be laughed at, the minuscule nuances of navigating possible innuendos around Dean was not his priority while they were approaching hour three of their tense battle. “Will you just
And for the second time in his life, Dean let his passenger take control of the music, succumbing to the sounds of…
Cas hadn't expected it to hurt that much; he knew he was leaving in a few days, he knew he needed to get ready for the movers to swoop in, but he could barely leave his room. He was glad his parents were busy, or they would have something to say about his moping. Castiel hadn't left himself many options when it came to leaving the house; all of the spots he had been all summer belonged to Dean.
Cas pulled his phone out, and the text from the unknown number was the only proof that he hadn't just hallucinated the whole experience. Dean had simply sent a 'hey there' text, and Cas smiled before sending back the church emoji. He packed up his things for real now, actually returning his notes to his backpack. Before he left the hallway, he took a quick snap on his cellphone of the stained glass window before him; the faintest glow of night coming through the glass wasn't quite as beautiful once captured, but this night was still worth the memory.
"No, please. I'm glad I could help." Castiel blushed, forcing out his following sentence in a bit of a hurry, the flirtation foreign on his tongue. "Thank you for the kiss, then."
He had always wanted this, a routine, stable life, to have more than a few months at a time in each town, but now that it was a possibility, Cas realized he had no idea how to live that life and absolutely zero time to figure it out. Tomorrow?
Dean took a few steps towards Castiel as he cut his apology short. He had a slight blush on his cheeks, which was, Cas was convinced, from embarrassment at being stuck here with him. But then again, Dean's soft smile seemed genuine. The room felt so small.
“Most victims of a mugging would call the police, I don’t think many would turn around and then commit a crime of their own.” The man started towards Dean, his voice calm and sure as ever. He walked with a posture that made Dean think ex-military but noting softness in Castiel’s expressions and that bedhead that would have any ranking officer offended, Dean immediately nixed that idea. Castiel crossed his arms, again stepping back to stand in front of Dean, close enough that Dean couldn’t hop off the table without pressing against him. Despite the challenge in his words, he seemed at ease as ever. Dean suspected that the man in front of him didn’t face many situations where he didn’t get what he wanted, something Dean could relate to, something that twisted up his stomach in anticipation. From this short interaction, Dean already felt himself itching to tell Castiel something stupid, like the truth, despite how he felt the flames of danger creeping towards him.
Castiel wasn’t sure how much time had passed as he was deep in thought about old-school travel agents and the fight against the internet when he heard his phone beep twice. Without checking the message, Castiel marked his spot in the binder and started up the car. He had turned it off and rolled down the windows to take advantage of the night air, so Castiel took a moment to gather himself. He ran down his checklist as he pulled out of the parking spot, taking inventory of the car. The fridge in the back seat was stocked with water bottles, Dean’s favorite sports drink, and a few bottles of champagne. The red velvet-lined compartment between the back seats held silver champagne flutes, and Dean always reveled in the reaction it got from first-time passengers. Cas thought his excitement over the car was cute, especially considering how strongly the man had stressed his loyalty to his own Baby.
“I’ve decided to keep you overnight for observation, Dean,” When Castiel spoke his name, the way it ran through his entire body bordered on sobering. Dean shuddered. He felt clarity. He wanted. Cas had a way of speaking that felt like his voice was reaching inside Dean’s chest, lighting him up from inside. “It would be remarkably unprofessional at this point to not ensure that you begin your healing process as safely as possible.”
But this… This was new. Different.
was he impossibly close), now this feeling was earthshattering, the impact something akin to a rocket launcher against concrete, a chemical bomb thrown across the room. Years of his willpower were acting as the door and Cas felt like a battering ram in front of him.
be jealous. He was working.
Dean looked down at his hand, now palm upon his lap.
_______
Cas hadn't let go of his grip on Dean's neck, and he closed his eyes to focus on Dean's touch to his hip and his forehead on Cas's shoulder.
Dean snorted. “I don’t think that game means what you think it does.”
The calm stillness that settled in the air was suddenly hit with a gust of air. Castiel's mind went zero to spiraling panic at the sound of the door opening up; if it were staff, he'd surely be kicked out of the space and sent down the hall to the dorms. If it turned out to be another student, he could risk losing the tiny hideaway to the masses. It'd likely be turned into some sort of make-out point, and the boy would have to find a new quiet place to study. Before the black hole forming in the boy's stomach took over completely, the intruder slid inside and shut the door behind him, clearly wary of being caught.
"Well, I'm not in it, exactly… But I have it real bad for the president of the art club, so I told her I'd come and help."
The next time they hung out, Dean wanted to make it right. He had started things with Cas as friends, and it progressed behind the scenes, without either of them fully aware until they were in the moment. Making out next to the pier wasn't typically Dean's first move, so he wanted to set the course right as much as possible, regardless of their limited time.
Charlie stole both Anna and Jo and ran off for a while, leaving Gilda and Castiel to finish up the sign for the booth. Once they were alone and chatting, Castiel understood Charlie's affections for the girl. She was spectacularly kind and quite beautiful, and based on the repeated questions that Gilda seemed to have about Charlie, it seemed the feelings were reciprocated. The girl didn't push Castiel to share too much, which was appreciated after the week he had.
mussed like he had spent time doing it this morning, maybe even in preparation for this moment. The thought of Castiel getting ready to see him after they kissed, anticipation giving his hands a slight tremor as he tamed the individual strands, filled Dean with a fondness so intense it scared him.
Before Dean could open his mouth, the gangly kid behind the counter was already speaking.
goes.
“What, you’re gonna punch the ghost with your big strong arms? Is that your move?” Cas pouted and shoved lightly back at Dean, letting his hands linger with his fingers spread across Dean’s upper arm. He barely noticed he was essentially feeling up his best friend, pretty blatantly.
A low laugh rang out through the room, echoing off the cartoonish painted walls. Dean regained his balance, hand reaching helplessly for his (empty) holster on his hip at the unexpected noise. His eyes shot up to where his coat sat on the chair, his gun on the other side of a path blocked by someone who was
of confidence, the tide would have swept Cas off his feet if he hadn’t built up such a strong defense. He’d be amiss to claim Dean had no effect on him, and something told him that the other man was all too well aware of that. Despite many distractions, Castiel was ever the professional, possessing an impressive poker face and even more impressive self-control.
The problem with trying to anticipate the difficulty of a hunt is the tendency for this job to throw you some curveballs. After a long day of research, the last thing Dean had been expecting was the woman he let take him back to her apartment to pull a knife on him. To be fair, he hadn’t seen a photo of the target since she was 14 and reported missing, and he was just out for a quick lay at the bar. How was he to know that in the 7 years since the photo was taken, the girl had evolved into precisely Dean’s type for a one-night stand? To make a long story short, once the girl had successfully slashed at him with her weapon, Dean clued himself in pretty quickly. His vision narrowed, laser-focused on the curve where neck meets shoulder, finally noticing the faded bite marks on the girl’s neck. It’s amazing the clarity that you feel with sharp steel tearing into your skin.
much more ancient and all-knowing than any human ever could be. When he spoke, it was with the cadence of someone addressing a child, and it would have infuriated Dean if he weren’t so damn confused to begin with.
This was the third day in a row he was waking up here. The first morning he had awoken here, he spent his first ten minutes of consciousness willing his breath to slow and his heart rate to go down. The second, it only took him five minutes to wipe the shock off of his face. He just couldn’t believe this was real. This time, he was glad when he didn’t feel the immediate panic set in, and he told himself it had nothing to do with the way that Dean’s hand was resting on his hip (his bare hip, he reminded himself- as if he could forget) and he could feel how warm and soft and big Dean’s hand was. It anchored him and felt too right too soon and that was a little scary, but Castiel pushed the thoughts of later away for the thoughts of now.  Dean was still asleep, and that meant Castiel could watch him without the faked indignity from the other boy.
No proof I had
He left the second beer un-grabbed and sat back down to wait and see who was headed his way.
When Dean spoke, Castiel pretended not to hear the way it was pitched down, and not just from the liquor. “Remington ‘n’ Clifford.” Dean looked back for confirmation from the woman. She nodded. Dean must have smiled at her based on the way she lit up. Castiel knows what it’s like to be on the receiving end of one of those soul-deep Dean smiles, but when Dean turned, the look he had given her was more hollow than Cas was used to seeing. Hollow was not a word Cas would choose to describe the Dean smiles he covets so much. To Castiel’s stifled delight, Dean brightened right back up to the sunshine glow he usually emits when Cas pulled out his driving gloves and slid them on. Castiel felt a little selfish for hoping that maybe he is one of the chosen few who are granted access to the genuine Dean.
“Huh.” Dean wasn’t sure he understood, but he didn’t see that changing any time soon. “Well, for nothin’ but a li'l stab wound, he was really pissed anyway.”
Castiel tipped his head to the side again, something he’d done before. He reminded Dean of a bird, between the wide stare and his slight head tilt. Was it better than he was attracted to Castiel before he knew the angel thing, back when he thought the guy to be a vagrant who was gonna kill him? Was wanting to bang the guy who maybe wanted him dead more or less healthy than the sexual attraction he was feeling towards one of God’s most divine creations or whatever? Who knows. He saw Castiel avert his eyes at that question, but Dean didn’t care to fight him on the whole mindreading thing.
“I would be more comfortable if I kept the gun out, thank you.” He spoke so calmly, tone of voice more suited for a library than the upper hand of a fight. Dean almost felt he couldn’t argue with the logic there. “I’m Castiel, and I told you already.” Dean just looked up at him, amused and not at all thinking about the gun pointing at him anymore. He was just watching. Messy dark hair, shockingly blue eyes, few days of scruff, a little dirty, mostly just hot. It wasn’t that he didn’t
“It’s you, Cas. See? You thought you moved out of the way but I could still see you there, over my shoulder.” And then Dean was turning and tugging again, and this time Castiel did fall into his lap, eliciting a high-pitched squeal from the boy. “You said it’s all signs, right? Tell me what about tonight didn’t say it was us.” Dean’s tone was serious, and despite the smell of vodka on his breath, he seemed to truly mean the words. Castiel was still reeling from being pulled onto Dean, now sitting sideways on his lap. He felt like his head was full of water.
Dean let go of his grip on Cas’s hair, instead of moving down to grab his wrists where they pulled at his shirt. He met Cas’s gaze with a slight hesitation, a look of warning. He didn’t want to stop, god he wanted to keep going, the feeling so intense that it hurt, but he needed to not fuck this up. “Is this okay?” Dean dreaded the answer, but they hadn’t gone too far to turn back if Cas didn’t want this if it wasn’t right. Dean tried to hold his doubt back from slipping into his expression, but the flash of concern on Cas’s face told him he hadn’t quite succeeded.
More to drink, more of this girl, more distraction. His eyes shifted back towards the bar and Dean swore he saw Castiel across the room for a moment that lasted too long. The man stumbled and Dean knew it wasn’t Cas immediately, too far away to see his face or any identifying features, but his angel doesn’t move like that, would never make a mess of himself in a bar, too drunk to walk straight.
floor of this abandoned house? An unchecked closet? The wind split a salt line? Some sort of undiscovered thing that was immune to all traps?
I’m sure the way you saw me go through the entire display, not complaining once, just waiting and watching, that look on your face?
Castiel snapped the buttons at the wrist of his gloves, ignoring the way Dean scrunched up his mouth to conceal a laugh. Dean liked to poke fun at the leather gloves that Castiel thought of as uniform for a chauffeur. They were sleek and black, matching the suits he wore while on the job, and Castiel liked them. Dean seemed to have an endless amount of pop culture driving references to make, but his jokes always came back down to the damned gloves. On their first meeting, Dean had goaded Cas into an impassioned defense of the accessory, poking fun until Castiel rose valiantly to his gloves’ defense, just for his impassioned speech to be cut off by a stream of gleeful laughter from the back seat. Castiel took uniformity very seriously, as it was the best way to present his professionalism and service from the first glance. Castiel could be relatively accurately judged by his cover and his commitment to his appearance often matched his control over his emotions but when it came to Dean, control was a bit harder to rein in. Dean had merely questioned the necessity of his favorite pair of gloves, and Castiel had jumped to defend, forgetting momentarily that he was on a job, talking to a client, not a friend. Dean hadn’t let him apologize, he seemed delighted despite Castiel’s protests and insisted that he “let loose like that more often.” Castiel had just pressed his lips together and nodded once in acknowledgment.
After all, the positives greatly outweighed any need for a regular sleep schedule, and he didn’t exactly have a bustling social life. Castiel had worked for a private firm for a while, specializing in personal security as well as chauffeuring, but after driving Dean Winchester just once, the man had somehow tracked down Castiel’s information to hire him personally.
“Maybe I’m just a brat.” Cas scrunched up his nose at Dean, hiding his smile to keep the pout he was faking.
“I ordered for you because you don’t know what you like, and I do.”
Castiel pulled out some gauze, returning to his post at the edge of the exam table, between Dean’s thighs. Dean let his legs fall together slightly until he could feel his ankle pressed against Castiel’s leg. The man didn’t react, just continued his careful work, finishing up where he tended to Dean.
Castiel laughed, his smile bright and eyes kind, making Dean’s heart jump in a way that caused him to worry; he doesn’t do warm and fuzzy, usually. His thoughts were cut off with Castiel’s hand on his lower back, his lips pressing against the curve of his ear. Castiel spoke barely above a whisper, Dean shivering where his breath slid over him. “Don't worry, Dean. You’re all mine tonight.”
Dean had to admit the pulse of pride he felt every time Castiel demonstrated something Dean taught him, big or small.
This had simply never happened. Dean always checked the entire house, sometimes twice, laying sigils and protection spells and lines of salt as he went, and today was no exception. Sure, the place might have been a little strange, but it was foreclosed upon like a decade ago. Who knows who lived here and who’s been through since. Dean’s seen worse than a couple of weird murals on the walls in the places he’s crashed over the years; there were no signs of anyone having been there in a long time, and the rest really wasn’t out of the ordinary. So absolutely
Did Bobby set him up with an
“Ah! Hey,” Dean interrupted sharply. “What’s that supposed to mean. For a hunter?”
Cas nearly pouted.
“There’s nothing inherently romantic about your forgetfulness.
Castiel either realized that Dean was reaching a fever pitch with his frustration or simply wanted to highlight his superior angelic observational skills as he stopped with the key in the door and turned around to face Dean.
“Sorry, habit. Faster than taking the stairs, especially if you planned on pacing yourself as you had on the way up.”
to be playing some sort of game. The blatant behavior had been going on since morning, and nearly always at a time Dean couldn’t exactly pull him aside to put the kibosh on it. Plus, he hadn’t exactly realized it was purposeful until that minuscule slip in Cas’s (usually impressive) poker face.
than he could have imagined.
Dean laughed nervously, stepping back from Cas and scratching at the back of his neck. "Shit, am I that much of an asshole around here?" Before Castiel could jump in with a panicked denial or an honest take that it wasn't Dean so much as it was everyone he hung out with, Dean spoke again. "No. I think I realized it's actually really serious. And I should have asked, but you were so close, and you always smell like the library-"
Dean had settled into a night by himself at the apartment complete with an un-roommate-approved movie on DVD, a shit ton of cold beer, and freeballin’ it under a nice fluffy robe. He could sprawl out across the couch, a luxury he didn’t get to revel in often as a six-foot-something man with a roommate about the same size. Since he hadn’t heard from said roommate since the morning when he left for his
"Sorry, just think you looked cute. That not good enough of a reason?" Dean loved that, teasing Cas. He had stepped around flirtation with their jokes in the past, but now that their attraction was out in the open, Dean felt free like never before.
That’d be a different story.
brought them both.”
, Cas had admitted it was his first time, and Dean had been incredible about it, taking his time and making Castiel feel cherished and wanted.
Cas the way he wants him. But fuck, the soft sigh of a breath that the man lets out when Dean lays both hands on him, the entirely unfair softness of his skin, that had to be real. It felt too real, almost.
Dean waited the few extra moments Castiel needed to gather himself and stop spiraling. He was careful to keep his big smile etched across his face, the one he knew made Castiel join in at least a little without fail.
Fair enough, Dean couldn’t argue with that. He responded with a shrug and a barely-there eyeroll. “Well, Mr. Professional Sigil-ist, do you want to show me how it’s done?”
, Dean was getting distracted.
He finished up his second drink and ordered a couple more shots from the bartender, turning around on the barstool to scan the room. The music wasn’t his favorite, truthfully he hated it, but the general idea was to find someone to dance quick and dirty with before taking them out to the Impala. Music like this worked for that.
Dean offered his name, his
friends he liked, friends unlike the boys on his wrestling team that had always pulled him in with promises of parties and small-town revelry, but Dean's self-control wasn't his strongest suit.
When Dean returned to stand before the angel once more, he was holding a new bottle in hand. Castiel pretended not to notice him, visibly doubling his efforts to choose, brow furrowed, squint so intense Dean was surprised he could see anything at all. Cas kept up this charade, pursing his lips in concentration until Dean cleared his throat much louder than necessary. Castiel inhaled once, slowly, before looking up and meeting Dean’s gaze and finally acknowledging the new offering in the man’s hands.
And honestly, was that so crazy to think? Dean felt like he was holding a huge flashing sign that told everyone in the vicinity that he had a secret. Everything was exhausting. From the moment Dean walked onto the school campus, he knew that the summer had changed him. The first conversation he was swept up into was crude and immature, nothing like the hours spent with Cas, meandering through topic after topic, debating and postulating while Dean held onto Cas's hand for guidance. He
The worst day Dean and Cas could have these days was one with arguments about wine, petty bickering behind the wheel, heaven forbid they’d face a bit of bad weather. Years ago, their worst days featured an onslaught of death, maybe literally Death, trying to slaughter them. But now? Now Dean was normal, and he hates things like white wine at dinner parties, and he couldn’t be more delighted at the thought.
, the excuse for John to pull out the good whiskey.
Castiel tilted his head at Dean. “The Virgin Mother went into labor inside a dirty barn, surrounded by livestock. Would you prefer a horse’s stable? There is one about ten thousand meters away.”
Cas did things that Dean hadn't realized were even an option, and looking that deeply at his own hangups made him feel naked. Cas loved Top 40s Pop music, and he cried during movies without hiding his face at all; and he even painted his nails, and he seemed confused when Dean was slightly shocked by his openness about those things.
A tripod? Was Cas the only person he'd ask? That didn't seem right at all. Maybe Cas was the only person he knew who was so thoroughly outcast he wouldn't be able to make fun of Dean for his request. Not that Castiel thought it was a strange request, it was one he would love to help with, actually, but did Dean think it was weird? Was this somehow a joke?
Once they caught onto his summer romance, it was over for Castiel. He hadn't meant to say anything, but Castiel was terrible at improv, not to mention lying, and had let it slip that he hadn't exactly spent the summer alone.
Dean took a deep breath and opened his eyes, immediately met with Castiel’s intense blue ones looking right back. He wasn’t sure how he had gone from feeling so powerful, in control with Castiel begging in his lap, to feeling this small, blinking up at Cas while he nuzzled into the man’s palm, but he didn’t mind, as long as it came with the all-encompassing warmth of
Dean sat down, and immediately Cas turned to stretch his legs out across Dean’s lap, resting them there and still wearing that damn smirk. “Yes. And so, the wax. What do you want to know? How much I like how it feels on my skin? Where I like to feel it most? Or do you want to know how I look spread out on the bed, maybe even tied down, or what I sound like when I’m begging for more?”
The angel sighed. “If you were to, say, shoot me. I would feel the impact, the tearing of flesh and muscle, and any crack of bone. At the same time, I would be equally experiencing the sounds caused by the projectile, the metallic taste of the gunpowder on the air, the stench of smoke and sulfur…. I would still be just as aware of your freckles and the way the knot on your left shoe is nearly completely sideways; I would still be privy to the shift of the linen top I wear, which, you’re right, isn’t typical angel garb
“Shorts, off.” Dean gasped the words along with a few choice expletives as Cas continued to tease over a sweet spot behind Dean’s ear, frustrated and amazed that Castiel had him this flustered. Cas obeyed, but to do so had to roll off of Dean. Dean went to pull off his own sweats but stopped immediately once he realized he’d miss Castiel undressing.
Cas let out a small breathy chuckle and then moved back those extra few inches to press himself against Dean’s erection. “Seems like you are as well,
and Dean blushed at the thought of Bobby having seen him kicking splashes in the water and kissing Cas. It was clear that Bobby didn't care. He wouldn't be able to hide it if he did. The man wasn't exactly up for any local acting awards, and he sucked at poker. Dean had been beating him at Texas Hold 'em since the cards were bigger than his tiny freckled hands, and he couldn't shuffle a deck. No amount of gruffly spoken words could cover up the smile behind Bobby's eyes when he looked at Dean. He was the closest thing Dean had to a loving father, and he was nearly positive the man couldn't care less about anyone's sexuality long as he got a beer in his hand and his ass on the porch no later than 5 pm daily.
Cas pulled away and let his eyes trace Dean's figure, making him squirm under the scrutiny. He nodded once to himself and pulled out his phone quick as a whip, snapping a photo of Dean before he could react. Dean grumbled about it, only quieted by a reminder of his earlier promise.
Dean nodded to himself, knowing the supplies he needed should be in the cabinets under the rabbit painting. Never before has he needed to reference location by a likeness of a fuzzy animal, but there really was no baseline of normal for a hunter anyways.
Dean grabbed Castiel’s hands in his own, hoisting him up out of bed and onto his feet. Cas fell forward against Dean with the shock of the sudden movement, and Dean wrapped him up in his arms and held him there. “Stop thinking so much, Cas. It’ll be fine. Just act normal.”
Cas patted the couch next to him and Dean realized he had just been staring, always staring, but this time his eyes were wandering. Cas’s arms, his chest, his stomach (peeking out of course - that goddamned shirt), his hips, his thighs... He shook himself out of it, forcing his body up and over to join Cas on the couch.
“I am doing no such thing,” Castiel’s response was too matter-of-fact for Dean.
Maybe Charlie will come and see someone moving in on her girl. Yeah, perhaps, perhaps somehow Charlie would sense it happening and come and scare De-. No.
Dean hopped up at that point, partially to bend down and make direct eye contact with Cas, no longer too close and staring from a side-eye. His other motivation was escaping the intensifying heat where Castiel was leaned against him. Dean grunted and closed his eyes, spinning around and taking a few steps away from Cas. “Well, yeah, you’re doin’ it, so whatever
can Dean hear someone walking around on the
“Dean, you have to stop touching everything. Just pick one, whatever you want.” Castiel didn’t seem to hold back any of the venom from biting into his words, and the intended sting found its mark. Sometimes they argued until the most casual of words became so harsh they felt more like fists being thrown, and Dean was not one to let someone get the last hit, proverbial or not.
. Someone who Cas hadn't even
“It looks like a pile of dirty clothes,” Dean stated plainly, squinting at the projected image on the wall. “Maybe he’s messy. Or owns a laundromat.”
angel’s eyes were much brighter.
Somehow he made it seem worse.
Not even pointing it out to the angel helped; he wiped helplessly at the wrong spot once too many times before Dean just lifted off his seat a few inches and handled it himself.
Dean reached the wall opposite the stranger and leaned back, truly casual and no longer putting up a slight front. Castiel was still scowling at the shotgun, and when he held the position for a few extra seconds, Dean rethought the word scowling, as this man didn’t seem to inject any malice into his expression. Dean cleared his throat, and blue eyes shot to meet his.
, it’s just that Cas is his best friend and roommate, and they’ve known each other for longer than he’s known anyone else, really, and is it so bad for a guy to want his entirely platonic friend to have more fulfilling romantic relationships than some random weekend flings?
Their bodies were lined up, Dean’s back to Castiel’s chest, flush from the ground to where Castiel tucked his head onto Dean’s shoulder. He brought their joined hands up to the sigil behind the couch that Dean had drawn earlier, Dean’s finger brushing against the chalk dusted plaster. He was speechless, his mind blank for the first time since he caught the angel fishing up there.
Dean had been so perfect, the summer so damned romantic that it had felt like a hazy dreamscape. But Dean didn't keep that fantasy going at the end; he didn't hold Castiel tight and confess feelings and apologize for leaving so soon; he just... rushed out with barely a kiss, hardly a mention of what they had shared. He hadn't even spared a glance behind him, just kept his back to Castiel until he drove off. He didn't offer a ride, no polite references to keeping in touch, just a horribly impersonal farewell.
Right as Dean stepped forward to enter the room, his free hand reaching out to swing the door open, everything went sideways. Dean looked right to check his corners, and as he did, he felt something press him into the room against his back and then, a frigid, harsh line across his throat. With the constant pressure of a knife holding him in place, Dean glanced down to see (what appeared to be, god, please be)
Dean checked the drawer in his tv stand, & when he rose to his feet with a pack of double a’s in his hand, two left in the package, Castiel was standing closer than he expected. He jumped back a little, but Cas shot an arm out to steady him. Dean felt the man’s grip on his bicep & his mouth went dry. At the physical contact, once Dean faced his initial reaction, he felt his usual easy confidence return. He could do this. He’s good at this, he’s Dean Winchester, goddamnit, and he does not swoon over mind-numbingly attractive men with who he’s spent much of the last two weeks with masturbating through a wall.
Dean nearly broke down when Cas reached his other hand up to rest softly on his neck. He couldn't hold back and absolutely no part of him wanted to. Dean closed the distance, his lips meeting with Castiel's, but this time the avalanche he felt inside was just on this side of overwhelming. When neither of them pulled back, Dean felt the tension fall away. Everything fell away. All at once, Dean's arms were around Cas, slipping under that damned trenchcoat to tug him in by the waist, Cas gripped a hand into Dean's hair even though it was too short to get any real purchase, his other hand still cupped under Dean's chin.  Everything was Castiel, feelings Dean hadn't even realized he locked away were rushing through his body and pulling him higher and higher until neither of their feet were on the ground, the feeling of the car door on Dean's back even washing away in the sea of
“Fuck, already?” Dean didn’t dampen his reaction to their extended weekend coming to a close. The longing for more time was written in his tone, evident in the way he squeezed Castiel closer. Cas couldn’t see Dean’s face from where he hid against the pillow, cuddled tighter against the boy than he thought possible, but he could hear the disappointment in his voice, the hint of sadness.
Dean responded, proud of his ability to match the guy’s tone, even if he was just a bit breathless still. “Well, let’s say it is your house. Cuz it’s not. Shit’s abandoned, I checked. But if it was your place, I would tell ya that I’m claiming squatter's rights. I’m no lawyer, but I do have way more things in this house than you do.”
"Is this the Harry Potter soundtrack?"
The man squinted as if contemplating Dean’s reasoning. After a few seconds, he spoke again, a slight hint of a smile in his tone, yet not on his lips. “What is that symbol you drew on the door?”
Castiel had been pretty sure there would be no natural conclusion to the feelings; Dean was older and popular and so gorgeous that he could have anyone, so why should Cas think that’d be him? Why did Cas want it to be? He had truly never been attracted to anyone like this, and it made his heart leap against his ribcage, pounding in Castiel’s ears.
Dean grumbled a little under his breath when Castiel reached out with one finger to the wall right above the couch and traced over the lines he’d drawn. Either Castiel heard his nervous internal monologue, or he was worse at hiding his emotions than he thought because Castiel turned back to him for reassurance.
Dean looked down at the screen, and Cas raised his eyes to see his reaction. Dean carefully grabbed onto the camera, his fingers just barely brushing against Cas where he held on as well. Neither of them moved; Dean just smiled at the picture taken before looking back at Castiel. Cas couldn't help but notice Dean's eyes fall to his lips before they met his again.
"I don't usually drink." Castiel shifted his weight back and forth, a little nervously, and Dean immediately regretted making him uncomfortable. Glancing over his shoulder, Castiel kept looking back at his beach blanket almost longingly.
Dean thought that the worst of it was likely over; he’d become pretty convinced the weird scruffy dude wasn’t going to cause him too much trouble. After all, he was holding the shotgun around its barrel by his side in some beyond fucked up variation on left shoulder arms, and Dean was pretty sure the guy was right-handed.
Castiel's head was spinning, his dad's voice droning on in the background. His expectations for the night were absolutely worlds away from what was happening, and he felt like he needed to sit down. Castiel blanched a little and leaned against the doorframe. He had always wanted this, a routine, stable life, to have more than a few months at a time in each town, but now that it was a possibility, Cas realized he had no idea how to live that life and absolutely zero time to figure it out.
Before the opening credits had even started rolling, Dean heard a key turning in the front door lock. The smile that immediately plastered itself across his face gave away Dean’s excitement when Cas walked in. The first thing Dean noticed was that Cas wasn’t wearing his clothes under that stupid jacket of his. The second thing was that Castiel’s hair was even more of a mess than normal. When Cas turned to face Dean fully, smiling right back at him, Dean could see the little bruises on his neck, more proof of what he had been up to, not that Dean needed the official, unavoidable evidence.
They worked together to lay out the blanket Dean brought, pressing the corners flat and talking mindlessly. Once it was settled, Cas made a wild reach for the lid of the cooler, his intentions to sneak a peek violently clear to Dean.
Castiel had explained it once, how leaving was how he regained a sense of consciousness. It was a way to reinvent and redecide and restart, all the things Dean could never do in his small town. He had done that this summer. He had opened up and decided to stop hiding; he had something good. Dean didn't get to restart now; he had to go back to the same place, forced to shroud himself with the identity Castiel had worked so hard to break through.
Seemingly satisfied with his introduction, Bobby turned to Dean and delivered a firm slap to the back of his head. "You should know better than to be keepin' this one from me. Bring him by for dinner, would ya? What kinda uncle would I be if I didn't make your friend somethin' to eat?"
Cas squinted at Dean but ultimately decided against continuing the argument. He grabbed two pieces of newspaper off the table, handing one to Dean. “This is an easy one. You have to crumple the paper and we’ll put them down and light them on fire.”
Somehow it was easy to talk to Castiel about his family. Dean shared how his mother had died when he was young, the longing that lives chest deep inside, the dreams that feel so real they must be memories from when Dean was small enough that his mother was around to do things like sing a song before bed. Dean told Castiel how his father hadn't handled his mother's death at all, let alone well, and how now he wasn't much of a father.
Dean never took anyone
Dean was slightly taller, and he used that to his advantage, looking down at the man, back straight as a rail, testing his grip to be sure they weren’t going anywhere. He laughed in disbelief, glancing around the entirely empty room they stood in, lit only by the street lamplight sneaking through the window.
Before heading home the next morning, they stopped for coffee.
Dean couldn't help but smile and give a little wave when the boy glanced over. The towel he always splayed across the sand was
Dean pulled away, turning around in Castiel’s arms. He, unfortunately, had to drop Cas’s hands in the process, but this way, he could look him in the eyes. Besides, Castiel didn’t take more than a moment before stepping in close again, his arms crossing around Dean’s lower back, holding him tight. “You did say you’re an angel, right?”
Dean didn't even want to think about what his dad would say if he came home with nail polish on.
"Candids are in, no?" Castiel was glad he spoke before focusing on the image he captured. If he hadn't, he might have given away his thoughts of how beautiful Dean really looked. He nearly gasped; he really had primarily been joking when he raised the camera and snapped the picture so quickly. Castiel had just taken to the sight of Dean unguarded, the soft pout of his lips, the shadow of his eyelashes cutting in the dark through the cyan-tinted light brushed from his cheekbone and up to his forehead.
When Castiel tossed the conversation to the wind, and instead threaded his fingers through Dean’s hair and met their lips in a searing kiss, the earlier promise of breakfast was dropped in favor of each other and falling into bed again.
to be upset about it. Dean couldn't have done differently; this was the situation he had put himself in for his own protection. Or whatever. That excuse was feeling weaker and weaker every time he fed it back to his own brain.
“Buddy, you gotta stop calling me that. Just call me Dean. You’ve known me for long enough.”
Dean would have protested changing out of his robe, but he wanted some ground to stand on in case Cas came back in those damn clothes and not his own. If Cas can make wardrobe requests so can he, it’s only fair. Plus, he thought it
"Castiel, your mother and I... All three of us," He gestured to Cas widely. "We're done hopping from town to town. We got the funding to open a branch just miles away. Starting tomorrow, you can have a normal senior year..."
"Can I kiss you?" Dean spoke, wanting to be sure he wasn't entirely off base. He was caught anyhow; he might as well pull the trigger. There was a moment of slight panic in his chest when Dean watched as the boy's eyes widened, but then Cas was nodding, inching even closer.
is, can it.”
“Oh, Jesus Fucking Christ, warn a dude, will ya?” Dean was sputtering out the words as he stumbled away from Castiel’s touch to his arm. He didn’t even feel bad for the blasphemy, it was an entirely
That was just the way they had started the day, with barely a hint of what was to come.
Cas smiled at his joke, or his next point, or who cares, really.
. Dean was not that man, though he wished he was. He couldn’t resist the temptation, especially when Cas was practically daring him to go further.
Cas just rolled his eyes, pulling on Dean’s hair lightly before he stood up, leaving Dean sitting on the couch. Dean was sure his immediate panic of
In fact, it was the sound of that door closing that signaled the beginning of the live sex show less than 5 feet from Dean’s own bed. Through a wall, but still. So close. Dean always pictured the man’s partner coming home from work, immediately being drawn in by temptations & barely able to remove his shoes & coat. They would fall into bed so quickly from there, in Dean’s imagination his dream man was eager to see him, almost as if he was touch starved from just the day alone.
, there’s a difference between a TV doctor and a real-world animal doctor, and Dean was realizing that pretty quickly since it seemed he needed to look almost everywhere in the room before he found what he needed. Eventually, digging through the drawers and cabinets produced a curved needle in its little blue plastic wrap and a small suture kit. He easily found some alcohol for disinfectant and set all his finds aside.
All that mattered was that the skin on Castiel’s neck seemed to be just as soft as his fingertips and the warmth he emitted felt like it made Dean glow from the inside out.
The kid stayed far enough away that it seemed he didn't want to be bothered, but Dean's curiosity was piqued already, and so he devoted the rest of his beach time to incessantly wondering what the kid's story might be. He couldn't make out much about the stranger but his outfit, couldn't see what the book was, couldn't really see the kid's face. The distance between them was too far for Dean to casually call out an introduction; he'd need to yell to be heard over the crashing waves and the wind. Dean would try to catch his eye for a wave each time the boy approached, but he seemed too focused on his goal of laying out with a book.
Nothing wrong with being a little nosy.
Silence is rarely peace for a hunter.
witch boy then, doesn’t it?”
Did you pay?”
Castiel protested, "What happened to kissing me?" His bottom lip stuck out in a pout, eyebrows knit together.
and '
The fair Charlie mentioned was advertised to the freshmen and occasionally a transfer student in their sophomore year, but Castiel was used to getting forgotten as he got older. He wasn't shocked that he hadn't heard of the fair, but he was finding himself unsure of why Charlie would be pressing the topic. Cas went still once he realized he had been bouncing his leg with nerves. He shrugged, but Charlie only seemed more determined.
And so within 10 minutes, Dean went from being pantsless, alone, and watching the credits for some slasher, to sitting on the couch in a pair of sweatpants and a ratty band t-shirt, watching Cas struggle to pick a DVD from their collection. Dean’s other friends would call him whipped. Dean would say he just liked spending time with his best friend and that is ‘
“Everyone in the entire fuckin’ world just seems to think we do.”
against Dean.
of proposals.”
“You could have announced yourself,” Castiel said.
When I’m right there, but you look at me like I’m standing too far away.”
“It smells weird in here, Cas,” Dean whined across the table at his best friend, something he’d been doing since they met years, nearly a decade before. Dean tended to complain, and Castiel had a wealth of experience getting Dean to give in and accept whatever it is he doesn’t want to do.
There's no good time or place to drop glitter, but Castiel found the linoleum of the high school gym floor was the perfect material to give just the right little bounce. Unfortunately, when a container of glitter is dropped from even just the smallest of heights, the damage caused could be a fierce thing. The plastic hit the ground, ricocheted off, and promptly tipped the lidless top in his direction. Green glitter rained upwards, a phenomenon Castiel would have claimed impossible until he witnessed it. Castiel watched hopelessly as the nearly empty container rolled away, dumping its last remains on the floor, leaving him kneeling in a sparkling craft pile. A quick look down would confirm Castiel's worst fear - he was entirely covered in glitter, and silence had fallen over the booth.
The problem with
“Yes. No. Well, yes.” Too much was happening in his brain. Forming some sort of cohesive sentence was proving to be difficult in the midst of Castiel’s panic. “No. How do we do this? Or what is this, or what should I do? What do we do at school?”
“Deeeeeaaaannnnn,” Cas whined his name, pouting. Dean just smiled, reveling in drunk Castiel and looking all too proud. “Deeeeean. Dean. We went over this. Magic. It’s all magic and interpretation and magic. Everything is magic, y’know? You just have to read it right and so we’re reading it right using beans and shoes.”
Castiel actually laughed at that thought, barely ashamed for eavesdropping on Dean’s internal monologue. “Do not be afraid,” the angel started, and Dean snorted out a laugh at the stereotypical phrase. Castiel started again. “I am sure Ariel did not feel pain the way you are expecting. Dean, I…” Castiel trailed off, his gaze falling down and out of focus. “Although we are within a human vessel, we are still… Quite unfathomable. For a hunter.”
Cas laughed nervously, not knowing where he had expected that statement to have ended.
“Well. Shit.” Dean wasn’t quite sure where to go with this. He knew he started it, but he couldn’t have known it was going
of, like, twelve years for a kiss.
When Castiel found himself reaching down to grab Dean’s hand, where it lay on his side, he sighed at how easily their fingers slotted together. Dean stirred, shifting closer than before, and Cas held his breath, sliding his eyes shut as if he were asleep. One. Two. Three. Cas counted the seconds, focusing as intently as possible on the numbers as he definitely blocked out the way that Dean’s lower legs were lazily tangled with his now, how Dean pulled their joined hands in close towards his chest. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Castiel opened his eyes again, and this time he was met with a half-lidded green stare. Castiel froze as if he was the one who was caught staring, and Dean huffed out something close to a laugh.
as it bounced off the exam table and out of view onto the floor. At that, Dean let his frustration rush forward from where he had just barely contained it, feeling it simmer hot under his skin, his fingers twitching into fists as he forced himself onto his feet once again. He slammed his fist down on the exam table, the action sending the suture kit on a flight over the surface and then further, across the room. Dean let out a string of curses, forgetting momentarily that shouting plus breaking & entering doesn’t usually equal anything good.
Dean’s mind spun, and he warred with himself, part of his instincts were telling him to stop this at any cause, prevent everything from spilling out any further than it already had even if it meant turning heel and running. The other part of him though, that part just wanted to turn and face Cas, fall forward against him, feel safe in his arms. Castiel stopped speaking, and Dean finally looked at him, turning to lean against the side of the car. Cas was standing too close, but that wasn’t anything out of the ordinary.
. Dean leaned into the touch, Cas’s hand lingering against his cheek felt too much like home to turn it away.
he could explain. He wasn't ready… if he had been, there'd be no way Dean would have sent Castiel away like that. Dean felt his throat burn at the thought, but he pushed it out quickly.
“Everyone thinks we’re fucking.”
Cas rolled his eyes at Dean’s question, not giving a response.
Dean felt like he was on another planet.
Cas stated, not a hint of doubt in his voice. He hadn’t denied staring, hadn’t contextualized it at all.
“Nope. Your newspaper, your future. These are
The first week back at school was always Dean's favorite. Everything was busy; everyone was excited to be catching up and one-upping each other with stupid stories from the summer. Instead of taking the lead as he usually would have, he held back when discussing his summer, unsure of what to say to his friends, how he could explain,
As Dean mouthed over Castiel’s neck, the man gasped out, “Dean, yes, please.”
“You’re going to tease me about that while you have your eyes glued to my lips?” It was Dean’s turn at the wheel, finally regaining at least a little bit of ground against Cas. “Also, you act like this and then are still surprised when I take you for a dom?”
His smile grew with realization, and Charlie grinned, tapping her hands excitedly on the desk. She got Cas's number, they arranged where they'd meet, and Castiel turned his attention back to the front of the classroom in time for their teacher to call for attention.
Cas just smiled serenely, that smug bastard, and he moved yet again, this time pulling his legs off of Dean’s. The break in contact was brief, as Cas was soon pulling at Dean on the couch, maneuvering him so there was room to sit between his legs, back to Dean’s chest. He sat at the edge of the couch, so he wasn’t exactly ass-to-crotch, but he was fucking close. Close enough that Dean could feel the heat emanating off his body. “Anything still back there?” Cas asked sweetly.
“Where?”
Dean felt his breath catch in his throat but spotted no sign of Cas noticing how he was affected by the simple contact.
It was overwhelming, but their need was magnetic and Dean couldn’t keep himself from rolling over onto Castiel, effectively taking back control as the man’s lips went pliant under his own. Dean knew no experience on the entire planet would ever compare to the brightness he felt bursting from his chest, charging the air around them with giddy desire.
The hand holding the knife faltered at Dean’s pronoun choice. Guess the guy’s not used to being mistaken for something nonhuman. Dean would wish he could relate, but he was too busy taking advantage of the slight slip in the confidence of his attacker. Within a couple of seconds, a dropped shotgun, and a few meticulously practiced movements, Dean had control of the knife with the man’s back slammed into the drywall and Dean’s left forearm secured across his chest. And… huh. The man that Dean had pinned against the wall was both less bothered and way hotter than he was expecting. And, thankfully, at least
Dean nuzzled his face into Castiel’s neck with the sweetest noise of contentment, and his fingers tightened their grip around Cas’s side for just a moment before relaxing again. Castiel felt warm air ghosting over his throat; Dean’s lips were just barely pressed against Cas’s skin, and with each exhale, Castiel felt himself drifting back to sleep. He hadn’t even thought he was tired before; his brain was racing too quickly with
Castiel’s lips twitched with the ghost of a laugh, and Dean remembered the guy’s lacking understanding of privacy. The mindreading thing was getting old, quick.
When Dean finally pulled back from their embrace, Castiel brushed one hand up his back to cup Dean’s neck.
Dean made a second left as well, finally turning onto his brother’s street. Yes, he had just completed a meandering sort of U-Turn because he hadn’t listened to Castiel, but maybe he just wanted to take the scenic route, jeez, can you blame a guy? As soon as they pulled into the only available parking spot on the block, the skies opened up into a completely un-forecasted thunderstorm.
Castiel had finished his classwork and was busy tuning out the world with a novel when he felt a tap on his shoulder, just like when Meg grabbed his attention. A spin in his chair revealed a girl who might as well have been Meg's opposite but still managed to make Castiel feel just as comfortable from their first interaction.
"No, please, it's really alright," Castiel reassured Dean, more out of habit than an actual desire to surrender his location. Sure, he had noticed Dean a few times since they both started at the school, but they'd never exchanged more than a word or two outside of classes, and they certainly wouldn't be considered friends. His only real experience with Dean was during their Sophomore year, they worked on a project, and Castiel had expected to do all the work when in fact, Dean was more than willing to do his share. Castiel was shocked that Dean nowhere near fitted his expectations, and that excited him.
He guessed the dude on top of him could still be, y’know, not human. Dean didn’t forget that as he lay there with his chest heaving to pull air back into his lungs. Again - no signs that he wasn’t, but, then again, no solid proof that he
Dean's absolute lack of awareness when it came to his surroundings had a significant amount of influence over the ability to avoid him. If Dean took one single over-the-shoulder look during first period… Castiel isn't sure what he would do if he were spotted. It was likely that there'd been more close calls than Castiel was even aware of with the small class.
had been before Dean pressed against him outside the bar, the taste of Castiel’s cosmo on his lips. And Castiel was 100% positive that none of that, nothing
Dean was a flirt, Castiel knew that. In the short time spent working less than 6 feet away from Dean, Cas had witnessed his share of Dean’s flirting. If they were alone in the car, it was directed at Cas. If they were driving another passenger, it seemed there was no limit to whom Dean would drop an innuendo on. Producers, managers, stylists, publicists, reporters, none of them were safe from the thrilling ride of being on the receiving end of Dean’s attention. Not that anyone ever seemed to complain. Castiel had come to enjoy watching the game Dean played, and the nearly certain way everyone played along.
Not that Dean would stand for that though, he reached out to snake his arms around Castiel’s waist and tried to tug him back. Dean huffed at the lack of attention, pulling himself closer until his lips met the other man’s neck. Dean was rewarded with a rumbling groan when he nipped at the pulse point, the two of them standing in the room as a perverted statue of what could have been with the earlier hunt with the vampire. The reminder of the danger alone had a vague sense of adrenaline set in, each touch, each sound amplified for Dean in much of the same way it would during a fight, but caresses being what sent him reeling, not fists landing hard blows.
Somewhere between Dean’s brain short-circuiting and Castiel moving his lips to Dean’s earlobe, he managed to pull himself back together enough to respond with words and not the soft moans he was relying on in the meantime. He mumbled out some form of ‘Sure thing, doc,’ before he brought his arms around to start at the buttons on Castiel’s blue and white striped shirt. He got his hands slapped away at that, Cas grabbing one and threading their fingers together instead.
of chick-flick moments, but Dean was far from complaining when the angel did the unthinkable and pressed a questioning kiss against Dean’s skin.
Now, standing in the doorway of a motel room, another man’s hand down his pants, Dean didn’t have the distractions he needed to rationalize this.
Dean thanked her, and grabbed Castiel’s hand while they waited for their order.
The kid stopped right there with his eyes glued to the window. He seemed oblivious to Castiel's presence, instead thoroughly taken by the mosaic in front of him. It was evident even from just a silhouette that the boy was Dean, another student in his year. The two didn't cross paths often, which led to them never having had an entire conversation despite having known each other for nearly four years. Castiel wasn't sure Dean remembered his name. Castiel squeezed his eyes shut with the realization that he'd have to speak up; waiting for Dean to see him would likely be more shocking than an announcement that he was here.
Earlier, they had been suited up, full FBI gear, fancy tie and all.
as something to look forward to...
What was amusing here?
With a separation between life and work, certain emotions were off-limits while in the car. Castiel wasn’t jealous, he
and the corridors were maze-like at best, but the students figured it out well enough by the end of their first few weeks. Seniors like Castiel were well versed enough that he could get from his dorm room to his secret hallway with his eyes closed. It was a Friday, and classes finished a few hours ago, so Cas made the trip easily, assuming that the rest of the students were grouped up in the common rooms or signed out to take advantage of the extended curfew.
Every day that week, it was the same routine. Mystery man spends the day alone at home, singing in the shower, talking loudly on the phone, watching tv. Dean’s sure he does other things too, but those are the ones he can hear. On the days that Dean works, he hopes he’ll run into the neighbor in the stairwell on his way in or out, but he never does. If it wasn’t for the door opening & closing, (& all the crazy loud hot sex) he would think nobody ever left the apartment next door.
What did Cas gain from leaning in and straightening Dean’s tie while they were on the way into the morgue, and why’d that woman have to coo at them like they were infants, not grown adult men preening each other in public?
While they were interviewing a witness, Cas reached over Dean to collect his empty coffee cup and refill it, as if a ritual for them.
It seemed that Dean realized what he said then as well, the way he tensed up into himself caused his grip on the plate to falter just a bit, jostling the ashes and nearly flattening the shape. Castiel smiled to hide the spike of longing and joked to ease Dean. “Don’t worry, looks like something else now. You won’t be trapped with me forever.”
Dean never laughed at any unsteady movement or seemed bothered by Castiel’s inexperience, and he had only laughed a little bit when Castiel became overwhelmed with emotion during his post-orgasm haze and started running off at the mouth about how beautiful and perfect and good Dean is. Cas had stopped, his cheeks flushed red, but Dean just tugged him incrementally closer against his frame and kissed gently down his cheek to his neck, nuzzling into the skin there to hide his face when Dean called him
and not who he
thinking about Cas in the shower, post-sex, how he’d look with his arms up above his head, both tangled in his stupid messy hair under the water spray and how that would make him look so goddamned hot, how he’d look pressed up against the wall of the shower, how he might have sounded when he was receiving the lovebites on his neck. Dean was
“Alright, man,” Dean started quickly, standing up straight from where he was pressed against the wall. Castiel didn’t spook, and so he continued. The situation was already weird enough; a little bit of the truth couldn’t hurt, right? “So, as much as I appreciate the view, and believe me, sweetheart, I do, I gotta get some shuteye. I gotta early meeting with some chick and then a witch-hunt to go on tomorrow.”
Castiel’s lips twitched again into his little ghost of a smile, walking towards Dean in a sure way that left no room for nerves. “Ariel really does not like being called that. Makes sense that the human who stabbed him would have been a Winchester. He’d been… unwilling to tell the whole story.”
Castiel was used to sitting there alone, bathed in the kaleidoscoping rainbowed light that streamed through the stained glass. That window was the reason he loved coming, besides the obvious perk of solitude. Castiel shared his dorm room with another boy named Gabriel, who was alright as far as roommates go, especially considering the other students in his class. Gabe had some flaws; for example, Castiel could do without being sexiled at least twice a week. That wasn't actually the problem that day - Gabe had smoked earlier, and the room still smelled like weed. Regardless of how many times he'd gotten away with it, Castiel didn't want to be the only one on the scene if admin were to smell anything from the hallway. Gabriel had signed out for the weekend, and despite Castiel's impeccably clear record, the school's drug policy was strict.
His Uncle Bobby was the perfect host for a newly minted adult; the man was never one to pry or make a fuss. Bobby lived barely 15 minutes away from the Winchesters', and while Dean was definitely old enough to stay home alone, he was a fan of routine, and Bobby's had been his summer plan for over a decade. Plus, Bobby was helping restore his car and would always take him out on the lake to fish a few times a week. The extra room upstairs at Bobby's practically belonged to Dean and Sam anyway, ever since he had added the second bed years ago.
“Oh, Dean, please.” Dean didn’t change his pace, just swirled his tongue over the sensitive skin underneath the head, still not taking Cas any further. He bucked his hips against the mattress, seeking friction as he pulled back, pressing open-mouthed kisses down the man’s length. Dean’s hands curled around Castiel’s hips until Cas reached down to pull one of Dean’s hands into his own. Dean faltered for a moment while Castiel intertwined their fingers, his heart leaping up against his ribcage so hard he thought it might burst through.
, & Dean was glad that he had decades of experience shutting up his younger brother with just a glance. They were, at that moment, sitting in Dean’s living room, in his new, solo, one-bedroom apartment. He called it his bachelor pad, mostly because of the way it made his brother scoff & roll his eyes. Sam was too simple to mess with, his exaggerated reactions too easy to goad and way too fun to bask in.
Dean didn’t answer, just leaned in closer until their noses bumped and watched the way Castiel’s eyes fluttered shut in long-overdue anticipation. Their first kiss was perfect, closed mouth, chaste, impossibly sweet. Cas felt alive. He pulled away, wanting to take in the moment, Dean’s features, the way he pouted when Cas ended a kiss earlier than he preferred.
He had no reason to think this school might be different than any other, had no reason to even think about Dean anymore, regardless of how fresh the wound may feel. It was just Castiel's luck to get stuck for an entire year at the school where his first and only ex-
looks great. See?" He stepped forward until he was next to Dean, holding out the camera for him to see as well. They were shoulder to shoulder then, the camera held between them.
’ Cas was reaching up to the top shelf, popped up onto his tiptoes with his shirt crawling up his back when Dean saw it.
to show Castiel before he realized how ridiculous he sounded. Beyond that, his fuckin’ brain was basically being projected out to the angel he had found himself domestically fantasizing about. It was somehow way worse than the sex thoughts from earlier. Before he could be caught pining for an angel he just met, he turned the focus away.
When he got to the point where he came out to Cas, Charlie just smiled, taking the by-proxy information in stride. She mainly stayed quiet through the whole story, only interrupting once, and for a good reason, too. Dean blushed as he followed her request, handing over his phone, displaying the photo of Cas on their first date.
that Dean thought he might just blackout from the intensity of the moment. An avalanche of feelings was crashing down onto Dean now that he felt permission, consent. He knows that Cas has thought about this before, he said for a long time, and Dean’s getting ahead of himself. They did promise to talk later, and Dean would rather focus on the man grinding against him.
Castiel pulled his feet up onto the bed as well, stopping only to remove his shoes before crossing his legs underneath him.
Castiel only stared back, a squint in his eyes.
With Castiel’s legs resting across his thighs, he was just an inch or two away from brushing up against the tent forming in Dean’s sweats. Dean was screwed, he was in so deep and Cas was so close to him and
have known. Cas thought briefly that Charlie had just read the situation, saw Cas frozen, sensed the panic he'd worked himself into, and wanted to drag away any outside viewers. Castiel sent a silent prayer of thanks to Charlie, unsure how she had done it but thankful nonetheless.
A few steps later, they were in front of an adorably decorated art booth. Castiel was again swept up into a torrential onslaught of names, but he was positive that the club's leader was named Gilda, and the other redhead was called Jo. Or maybe it was Anna, which would make Jo was the blonde leaning up against the booth's tabletop. Charlie had sped through their introductions, clearly eager to jump into the fray. Castiel spent the few minutes it took for the group around him to organize tasks to review the other booths across the gym.
a sigil; it looks like a children’s doodle. Are the rest like this downstairs as well?”
Somehow It felt as if he were being chastised by a partner for cheating, unsure why he wanted to assure Castiel so quickly that he was gay and ‘this chick’ is no threat to any interest Dean thinks he might spot behind those stupidly blue eyes. He didn’t even know her name. He just knew she was some hunter contact of Bobby’s and that they were grabbing a cup of coffee and discussing the case.
Holding the plate of ashes between the candle and the wall created a shadow, one that resembled a poorly drawn display of hills rather than a clear hint as to who he should marry. Dean and Castiel both squinted at the figure on the wall, trying to make a shape out of the vague nonsense.

Dean came to a stop underneath the giant tree, turning to Cas with a flourish. He grabbed Castiel's free hand and looked him directly in the eyes while he spoke, tone grave. "Castiel Novak, would you like to join me on the best picnic of your life?" Dean would be embarrassed at his dumb posturing, but Cas only granted him the genuine smile he was looking for.

Mindreading. Angel.

Cas was glad for the second shot and his nonexistent alcohol tolerance because the added bump of courage gave him his voice. “Za Nas,” he repeated the words, unable to look Dean in the eye. He averted his gaze to the bottle and busied himself with pouring out two more shots for later and screwing the cap back on. “It means ‘to us.’”
he had shut. He held back the annoying instinct to call out ‘who’s there’ like the first dumbass to die in a horror movie and instead stayed quiet, listening for even the faintest sign of trouble.

Cas only rolled his eyes and rolled out of bed, giving Dean a look that clearly said “
That was enough permission for him. He teased Cas by tracing his tongue over the previous marks before he started nipping and sucking across the skin. Castiel made the prettiest noises. Dean wished he could see his face while kissing his neck, he could almost picture the way his eyes would look when they’re full of need, when he’s hard and pressing against Dean and his fingers are digging into Dean’s shoulders, holding on as Dean were to disappear if he let go. He didn’t care that Cas was going to be covered in these small bruises, Dean just needed to claim, whether that claim was valid or not didn’t matter. Plus, the gorgeous, sweet as nectar whines that kept falling from Cas’s lips while his hips were still moving in small circles over Dean were driving him insane with desire.

did Castiel look solid. Dean didn’t doubt the man could throw him around regardless of height. Dean shook the man’s hand in introduction, offering his name as well, pretending not to swoon at the solid grip of their greeting.
(See the end of the chapter for
does that have to do with anything?”
The night of their first kiss, Dean stumbled out of his car, tipsy on the taste of Castiel on his lips. Bobby was still sitting on the porch with his beer in hand, and when Dean couldn't wipe his dopey smile off, the older man just raised an all-knowing eyebrow. Dean hurried inside before he had to field questions about his heart-eyes.
about how Dean didn’t even know the guy, like
Dean curled his tongue around Castiel’s, eagerly swallowing each breathy whine or whimper that he released. When Dean reached down between them to wrap his hand around Castiel’s length, Cas gasped out Dean’s name, a plea, and he couldn’t help but provide. He stroked once, twice, his wrist twisting and his thumb swiping over the head to collect the precome there.
Dean’s resolve was going to snap. He was nearly positive this was a dream, as there was no way this was currently unfolding in front of him, on his very
He even steeled himself for the wash of shame or regret or rejection once he settled in, but it never came.
“You look… Clean.” That’s one adjective Dean supposed could be used, but there were more fitting ones floating around in his head at the sight of Castiel, shirtless and on display. Clean was safe, though, kept him from using words like beautiful and gorgeous and pretty, and what the fuck, those aren’t
Dean poured the shots, then returned the bottle to its previous location on the floor between the two boys. He grabbed one from Cas, and they locked eyes. Castiel’s mind was racing before, but everything came to a halting stop with Dean’s stare. They were close enough that he could differentiate between the separate shades of green in his eyes, seeing where the darkest tones of emerald melted into the golden tinted sea green, and he barely heard Dean start speaking.
Cas hummed, trying to redirect the conversation back to the divination. “Alright, Dean. Focus?”
the boy was glowing. Dean's chest filled with that light, or at least that's what it felt like; Castiel's warmth was contagious and overflowing. His throat caught with emotions he hadn't felt before.
“Dean, it’s okay. I know by now that you don’t hold any intention behind your actions.”
“Nah, then. Just angels. No ghosts.” Dean flirted, his own arms reaching up to wrap around Castiel’s neck.
Dean would do most things to get to see that.
“So, not only do you sit around thinking about my BDSM preferences, you’ve been thinking about kissing me?” Cas teased, but Dean when stuck his tongue out to wet his lips he saw Cas’s eyes track the movement.
He could almost still feel where Cas had touched him. The residual heat still lingered under Dean’s skin.
This year had been different; he had a summer fling, a boy he thought wanted to keep him around. It didn't matter, though. Dean had left, gone back to school to find the pretty blonde girl Castiel's insecurity insisted in harsh whispers that the boy had left behind. Cas deleted Dean's number as soon as he got home after their last meeting; he didn't want to leave himself the option to send some sort of pathetic text.
A pause for dramatic effect, Dean, tapping on his chin in an overacted expression of thought.

Healthy or not, it was the truth, and he wasn’t about to let some
Funny, Castiel thought. The first time he wasn't able to leave also happened to coincide with the first time he had someone he needed to run from.
to ignore the simple fact that Dean Winchester was likely engaged in some sexual encounter mere feet away, but God, was it difficult to put that thought aside.)
Then he pretended not to notice how he thought of Cas as his.
Once he reached the landing with nothing but a mostly muted groan from the second to last step, Dean saw a door cracked open that he knew for
the dude could be reporting straight to the big man upstairs.
When Dean finally stopped laughing, Castiel was staring at him, the tension had leaked out of his stance entirely as he watched Dean all but writhe around the front seat in a fit of giggles. He didn’t look angry anymore, not at all. Cas had
“We don’t
A head nod served as a thank you from Dean, and he shuffled out the door faster than needed.
Dean broke out into a grin and nodded. That was a welcome surprise.
It was entirely normal for him to have spent the day picturing the future with his best friend, fantasizing over the possibility of domesticity, Castiel bringing him a cup of coffee and cozying right back up next to him in the too-small interview room.
Cas finally looked up into Dean’s eyes, and Dean was surprised to see the challenge presented behind those stupidly beautiful blue eyes. “Well then, Dean, could you tell me exactly what type you did take me for when you were contemplating my preferences in bed?”
“I’m so,” The man cut himself off with a raspy groan, stuttering when he continued. “S-so close.” Again, the creaking sped, & Dean heard the loudest noise yet from next door, the man calling out during his release while his partner slowly worked him through it. Still, no word from the silent half of the pair. Dean was grateful for that, he could hear the additional soft whines & whimpers as the man came down from his orgasm, & it was the thought of being the one responsible for those sated noises that pushed him over the edge of his own orgasm.
That same overbearing and incredible warmth spread from the point of contact between them.
“It usually makes humans more comfortable when I emulate their actions. You seemed willing to have a bit of a power struggle for the weapons, so I indulged you.” Castiel spoke, slightly more mechanically than he had been before. Dean had no clue what to do with Castiel or his actions at all. It was rare to feel this thrown off his game. “I could smite you if needed. However, I don’t plan on doing that,” Castiel added the last part with that now-familiar amused mouth twitch, and Dean couldn’t help but laugh.
“Is this what you had in mind?” Castiel’s voice struck Dean to his core, a bolt of heat through the empty house they stood in. He whispered dark against Dean’s neck, and the tone was one that Dean never imagined from the lips of a being so holy. Cas laughed at that thought, and Dean wasn’t sure when he stopped caring about the mind-reading, but it might have something to do with the ease with which Castiel picked up on his fantasies.
The first time Dean got into the back of Castiel’s vehicle, he greeted the driver like they were old friends. His genuine enthusiasm threw Castiel for a loop, momentarily dropping his perfect composure and even stuttering. Dean had just grinned like he won a prize, easily falling into his ways of casual charm. They spent most of the day together, Cas taking Dean from press event to press event.
He nodded his head once, speechless partly as he was unsure of what to say, but also affected by the genuine soft concern in the eyes that were now within 5 feet of his own.
It wasn’t working. Dean couldn’t get his mind off of Cas, he couldn’t stop hating himself for the way he shattered the moment, himself, and Castiel, and the way he panicked and ran instead of being there to piece it all back together. He wanted to take it all back, rewind to the point where Castiel stood pressed against him in this way. Through the slight haze of his alcohol consumption, he still couldn’t escape the blindingly clear memory of hearing his name fall from Cas’ lips, a whisper-plea into the kiss. The sound made Dean’s chest tighten and heat pool in his stomach, Cas sounded wrecked. It had scared the fuck out of Dean. It was way too much. It was also absolutely not enough.
“Sam, I mean it. It’s love.
Cas shook his head, steadfast in his disagreement.
"Woah, shit, I didn't think anyone was in here, I... I'm sorry" Dean stuttered a bit on his words, and it interested Cas, as his only impressions of Dean thus far weren't aligning with the nervous boy in front of him. Maybe catching him off guard was the key to breaking through that public persona Castiel suspected Dean hid behind. "I'll go."
“So, Dean, is there anything else I might be able to do to help relieve your... suffering?” The way the last word was drawn out, long and slow when Castiel's teeth dragged over his lip while forming the phrase, made the question sound less like his earlier Veterinarian-Oath-themed innuendo and more like a flat-out proposition.
in his ear.
Dean led Cas towards a giant tree at the outskirts of a clearing. They had parked near a nature preserve, the ideal place for a summer meal. As they walked and Dean dragged the heavy cooler over the grass, that was when Castiel finally guessed correctly. He let out a gasp at the realization, and the other boy laughed.
Cute, huh? Dean was grateful Cas had sworn off the whole mind-reading thing. If he hadn’t, the angel would have a hell of a lot more ammo in this battle.
Dean cringed. He hadn’t thought his previous angel stabbing incident had actually
Cas had fixed his tie. Dean used the time to study the lines of Castiel’s jaw, his eyelashes, the creases in the corner of his eye, the shape of his lips.
, he thought, the memory of stubble ghosting against his cheeks hot in his mind.
Dean took a deep breath, licking his lips and looking away. “You, Cas. C’mon.” He spoke the words just loudly enough for the other man to hear him, and Dean lowered his head, breathing hot puffs of air against Castiel’s length, waiting for permission. “Lemme taste you, please,” Dean isn’t one to beg, but there’s an exception to every rule.
like he could kick your ass; he was just… slightly unassuming, that’s all. Castiel was wearing a white (but stained) long-sleeved shirt, baggy with the sleeves pushed up past his elbows, and as Dean followed the lean lines of his forearms, his view ended on the gun. His gun. Still.
"You're not from here." Before he could stop himself, Dean was cutting in. It came out harsher than intended, but thankfully the boy seemed to take it in stride.
“Why’d you point my guns at me? Can you not do the…”. Dean trailed off, lifting his arm straight out, palm facing out at Castiel. “Y’know, do the… Whole wrath of God thing?” Dean resolutely ignored the smile pulling at the corners of Castiel’s mouth, feeling more embarrassed than before by the scrutiny, especially now that he
Through the ringing that echoed in his ears, residual from the wash of cold, frozen sickness that had him held in place since Dean had shown up, he heard Charlie's voice cut in, eager and determined.
God, the conviction Cas could put into that question, like he didn’t know the answer already like he wasn’t just prying for a specific response.
“So, what? You can’t focus on one feeling?” Dean grasped at the strings of understanding, wanting more than anything to not come off as some fuckin’ meathead hunter. It is hard to seem intelligent when standing across from something older than, actually, the concept of people themselves. Maybe that’s what Castiel had meant by unfathomable.
between them.
“Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know your number, man.” Dean ruffled Sam’s hair while he was preoccupied with sliding into his jacket. Before Sam could protest the treatment of his perfectly styled hair, he was being ushered out the door. Sure, Dean may have rushed him out but he had his reasons, no matter how faceless and possibly geriatric they might be. He flicked his front door locked & took a deep breath before retreating to his bedroom.
Not for the first time, Dean wondered if this could be some monster-related and carefully plotted psychological attack, perfectly orchestrated to break him.
Cas shot over a look he was well familiar with. “Dean,” Castiel deadpanned.
after a night out. He had a couple of excuses at his disposal, but his safety and security were enough. His personal information had been leaked too many times to risk it over a girl he met a few hours ago under flashing club lights. That, plus the obscene amount of zeroes in Castiel’s new salary meant he couldn’t care less if he had to park up somewhere and read while Dean got off. Castiel had asked after the second back seat tryst why Dean never went to the woman’s home.
“Svyatki.” Castiel pronounced, always one for tradition. “It’s the perfect time for contacting the spirits and our ancestors, the best time for reaching forward into the future.” Cas tipped his head towards Dean, lowering his voice as if the next part was a secret. “It’s magic, Dean. Everything has meaning, it’s all signs.”
Right? Or..?
They had been sipping their coffee when Dean noticed the wayward drop of coffee making a glacially paced journey off Cas’s bottom lip.
The whole reason he sped away from the bunker in the first place. Things got to be too much for Dean to handle, and he ran.
When he was met with only silence from over his shoulder on the bed, Dean turned back to face his friend again. Cas had crossed his arms over his chest and was regarding Dean with genuine amusement.
Dean ignored the way the guy’s voice rolled over him like waves, threatening to drag him down deep. Too much was happening for him to deal with this dude’s sex voice on top of the rest. He still couldn’t understand why the air between them was so relaxed. “Hey,” Dean responded indignantly, “I’m no thief. I’m…” Well, he wasn’t quite sure how to finish that sentence.
Fifteen minutes and one blood-stained Led Zeppelin shirt later, Dean had successfully picked the lock for the back door of an animal hospital. It was nearly 3 am, so Dean knew he had plenty of time to get in, get himself sorted, clean up, and get out before he would even come close to operating hours. Before he went in, he did a final cursory glance around the empty parking lot, relaxing when nothing seemed out of the ordinary, and the nearest buildings were a distance away.
He heard Dean’s name on repeat in his head, nearly a prayer. Prayer felt fitting; Cas certainly had felt holy in Dean’s arms. He wanted to write psalms, scriptures, hymns, wanted everything of his to be Dean’s, wanted all of
He cleared his throat a little, and Dean still startled slightly, whipping around to face Castiel completely. Dean's uniform shirt was untucked, the top few buttons undone, clearly done with school for the day but, Castiel noticed, not dressed to go out, still carrying his school bags with a camera from photo lab slung over his shoulder.
Still, Dean could never deny Castiel, and desire won out over logic or communication or any other options present. Dean wrapped both his arms around Castiel and pulled him down into a careful kiss.
Dean shared a similar longing for his childhood, not for stability; he'd lived in the same home for his entire life, but instead for the presence of his mother. Dean hadn't talked about losing her with anyone but his younger brother, and even those talks had been coaxed out by a family therapist social services suggested. He laughed, thinking about the time and effort it took to get him to share back then when now all it took was a strange teenage accountant-looking boy with the bluest eyes Dean had ever seen.
A month after that picnic date, Cas gave Dean a handmade keychain, crafted from a shell they had pulled out of the sand at the beach. Neither of them mentioned any "anniversary," and Cas pretended it was a casual gift, but they both knew. Dean had made a mixtape, a solid collection of his favorites to introduce Cas to, as he said, "The Greats." When every single one of the songs he chose for Cas ended up being lovey-dovey as hell, he realized he should have figured out his feelings a bit sooner. Dean knew it was beyond cheesy, even maybe too much, but the look on Castiel's face was worth it, and clearly, Dean was in deep, despite his denial.
Castiel laughed, a chuckle that made Dean realize with a start that he’d moved past dumb-crush and into infatuation zone, and he was literally thinking about an angel.
Dean slid one hand up the leg closest to him, his fingers curling to rest on Cas’s thigh, at the hem of his shorts and wow, Dean never realized just how short these shorts were or how soft Castiel’s skin was, but fuck he could feel the muscle, he could tell he was strong. “Sure, we could start there, I always thought I’d kiss ya before you asked me to scene with you, but I guess I’m not one for convention,” Dean smirked, going for nonchalant, but he couldn’t keep his fingers from drifting over Cas’s skin, and he couldn’t keep his brain off the fact that he was sitting, calmly, with his hand. between. Castiel’s. legs. Cas, who was just looking curiously at Dean, a small smile on his face that Dean couldn’t quite decipher.
Same nondescript furniture, a coffee cart missing a wheel, a bored teenager working for minimum wage at best.
Cas stepped back a little and nodded to his friend. Dean took a deep breath, steeling himself to appease Castiel. He closed his eyes for a few seconds before opening them and focusing intently on the retreating tunnel of his reflection, squinting.
“Whatever. Doesn’t matter. Past is the past, right?” For Dean, too, he hoped. He really wasn’t sure if he should expect divine retribution for the whole stabbing incident. “Can I get my guns back? Now that we’re all on the same page?”
part that really kept Castiel coming back to the small abandoned cabin. He could spend time alone without the fear of interruptions, without the threat of the other boys in town, his older brothers, or his parents.
Before Castiel could dig around on the table for what he wanted to do next, Dean was pulling a bag out from under his chair. His eyes were shining with a touch of mischief, a hint of guilt as if he expected Cas to react negatively. He only raised an eyebrow and waited, knowing with Dean, often it’s best not to guess.
That second kiss was different, like a dam was breaking and Castiel was surging forward to claim what he thought he never could have. Dean made a surprised little noise at the urgency, parting his lips and letting Castiel lick into his mouth. Dean tasted like vodka and nutmeg and cloves and Cas wanted more. Dean was unable to hold back a loud moan as Cas sucked lightly at the tip of his tongue before moving to mouth at his neck. The other boy just took the sound in, feeling a silly pride at having been the one to cause such a noise of pleasure from
Cas opened the door to their room, and the familiar old motel door squeak broke Dean out of his reverie. With his mind racing a mile a minute, Dean found himself falling into his usual posturing as a defense. He shouldered his way through the door first, thinking the way he bumped against Cas served as payback for the constant contact he had been subjected to all day.
” Cas stressed the last word with a small roll of his hips backward, grinding against Dean, who tried and failed to bite back a heated groan at the contact.
Castiel flicked his eyes up from the road to meet the speaker’s gaze in his rearview mirror. He smiled politely, more of a pressing of his lips together in acknowledgment, and gave a small nod. The digital clock on the console indicated that it was already half past 11, but Cas never complained about the more unconventional aspects of his job.
Cas felt panic rise up as he walked, but it didn't seem that Dean had noticed him, so he just shuffled in towards the opposite back corner of the room. From his desk, Castiel was glad he couldn't hear any specific voices out of the chorus filling the room. Just looking at Dean, it was evident that he was different here. Everything from the way he stood to the way he gestured while he talked was in contrast to the gentle person who had held Castiel's hands, pressed soft kisses against his lips, shared his patience and kindness all summer. This Dean he saw
Cas could hear the tremble in his words, could pinpoint where his emotions snuck through with damned disappointment at Dean’s immediate reaction, but he hoped Dean couldn’t tell.
“Fine.”
He tried to answer but it came out as more of a soft groan than anything resembling English. That got Castiel another kiss, this one pressed to his temple with a quick turn of Dean’s face. Cas replied in turn with another soft groan. That one was not meant to be words though. They lay there in comfortable silence before Cas cleared his throat to speak, pushing the disappointment out of his voice.
The thought forced Cas to take a sharp breath before continuing. "It happened so fast, and then it just ended, and I was supposed to be moving, and apparently there was no point to try anymore but…. I wanted to. I just…. I had never felt like I could fly before. Not until then. I didn't want to let it go."
To let himself want, and let himself take, and let himself receive.
behind Dean’s words, so he pressed the conversation further into Dean’s hands as he leaned back on the (more gray now than blue) faded couch the two of them had picked up from a Goodwill. “Alright, I’ll bite. What’s he look like, what’s his story?”
“A witch who’s letting you light mine too.”
“So we’re gonna do magic?” Dean questioned, a lilt to his voice that teased and pulled at Castiel.
wine, served c
thing. Two groups of possible friends, still no contact with Dean - no proof that the boy even knew he was still in town. As far as Dean Winchester was concerned, Castiel was likely settling into the small village of Whofuckingcares, Ohio, unpacking all his things from the summer and mourning the move. In all actuality, he was just across the room.
Not when Dean was
Castiel unlocked a door that read “Employees Only” and with a wink over his shoulder, the doctor ascended the stairs, Dean not far behind.
“G’mornin, sunshine,” Dean’s voice is sleep-heavy, graveled, and slow. If Castiel was honest, it was a mixture of the way that voice tugged on him and the pet name that caused him to break the short distance between them with a kiss. It was brief, but it felt easy and like they’d been doing this forever. Cas pulled away from the kiss just to nudge his way somehow even closer, tucking his face into the space where Dean’s neck met the pillow.
Cas blushed. He had done that, hadn't he? He had just leaned in and sniffed Dean. After kissing Dean. After Dean kissed him. When not even twenty minutes prior, Cas had been curled in the corner of the hallway, tucked into his English studies. So many things had changed in such a remarkably short amount of time. And on top of that, Castiel was comfortable, joking with Dean and acting like this was alright. Like it was normal. Could it be?
“I’m sure I could think of a few, but I also try to keep things focused on the patient while on the job,” Cas spoke with a renewed twinkle in his eye, somehow leaning even closer, still not close enough. Dean was pretty sure this was a dream; perhaps the vampire attack earlier was worse than he thought and this was heaven, he had died and his heaven had a super hot Vet trying (successfully) to seduce him. Either that, or someone must have hacked into his fantasies because there was no way he was standing across from someone who sounded like
Over the course of the class, Cas managed to stay out of Dean's sight while simultaneously exchanging information with the girl behind him. He found out Meg once had been the new girl, having moved right before the beginning of her sophomore year. She said it was tough getting to know people at first, and she wanted to protect Cas from that. She immediately tried to tuck him under her wing, and Castiel found he didn't mind. She had a quick sense of humor and seemed to share Castiel’s weariness of Dean.
, Dean thought, the kid was looking for an out. Dean had only just introduced himself and already scared him off. Before Dean could start stumbling through an apology that involved a cheesy D.A.R.E. peer pressure joke, Castiel took him off guard.
"Not that often," Dean laughed, the noise much smoother and less harsh than the laughter usually heard from Dean and his group of friends. Castiel liked this laugh a lot more. "I found it at the end of last year… I just thought it would be a nice place for, y'know," Dean lifted a camera to his classmate with the words.
more than anything ever had.
As the phone beeped to signal the call’s disconnect, Dean’s smile turned wistful. He missed his family back home, and as much as he and Sam avoided heartfelt moments, it was evident they had a special relationship. Castiel took advantage of the ability to really watch Dean now, as they had pulled up to the club around the time Dean had started to interrogate his brother, and he observed the careful way Dean wiped away the expression of reflection and replaced it with the patented Dean Confidence™.
Schrodinger’s Gank, Dean thought; and he would laugh out loud if he wasn’t trying to get the jump on whatever was both
“Dean, I’m sorry, I couldn’t wait to talk. I’m… I’m scared of this. I can’t lose you but if this is….” Castiel’s voice rumbled deep in Dean’s chest, causing a stampede of emotions to rush forward. He couldn’t deny that he was crying now, tears falling silently as he stared at the knot of Cas’s tie. Dean tried to drag his eyes upwards, he wanted to look Castiel in the eye, wanted to do this right.
Cas raised a single eyebrow at Dean, seeming to read between the lines like he always does. Wasting no time with further questioning, Castiel leaned up and pulled his shirt over his head and tossed it to the side, shrugging in a way that would appear casual and unaffected if not for the heat in his stare. “Would you like to check?”
, at the thought of
“What if he’s like, seventy, Dean? You’re turning down a
Right then, the door to the bathroom opened, and Cas flinched at the incoming reaction to his current state. Instead of a loud, shouting laugh or any other response he'd gotten so far, Castiel heard a soft gasp before anyone even made full entry. Castiel spun around, suddenly face to face with Dean, both of their eyes wide as saucers.
Cas fought to keep from grimacing in response to Dean’s question. He knew Dean meant well, just wanted to include him, but Castiel was wary. Besides Sam, Castiel’s relationships with the other boys in the town ranged from non-existent at best to hostile at the other extreme. Being around Dean staved off the worst of it, but the last thing Cas wanted was Dean to have to defend him all the time.
“She asked the question only a few minutes after you reached over to wipe the coffee drip off of my chin,”
met these girls, made a mess, and now was stumbling through an incredibly awkward apology for freaking out. He was vague, blamed most of it on the glitter and his shaking hands, and "I'm sorry, I'll be back in just a minute- I just… I need to take… Let me… bathroom? I'm sorry."
He shook himself out of his reverie, just to immediately drop back in time to the diner and the nosy waitress and Castiel’s obvious fault in the situation.
Dean was going to take it slow, let Castiel drive the pace, make any decisions to further this or stop, but when Cas just smiled sweetly into the kiss, what was barely a gentle press of lips, Dean felt his heart soar. The way Cas brought up his hand to cup Dean’s cheek was his breaking point, and he parted his lips, deepening the kiss. Dean let out a low whine when Cas followed suit.
“Maybe. Or I could kick it? Sam took karate that one summer and I got pretty good at
set his heart jumping?
Dean had done this
Before Dean could finish painting the picture in his head, he heard the first low, resounding groan. He pictured parted lips & fluttering eyelashes, & he felt a wave of heat roll over his body. He waited, biting his lip in anticipation. The shock of hearing that damned voice like this still hit Dean like a sack of potatoes, sending stabs of pleasure through his gut.
He had been staring for too long, and Cas let out an impatient whine, pulling at the grip Dean had on his hair to try and get closer. “Tease,” Cas moved his hands down from Dean’s shoulders, skimming over his chest to tug at the shirt Dean was wearing, the last barrier between Cas’s bare chest and his own. Cas stared Dean down, a silent question in his eyes.
“I did not intrude - you just are thinking very loudly - but I can tell you’re looking for something. You’re confused.”
Dean just grinned back, decidedly
The poor lady behind the register thought I was your rich husband.”
’s house, Dean was free to watch some stupid gory horror movie that Cas would have hated.
Dean looked at Castiel in a way that made the boy feel more exposed than ever, but the slightly dopey smile that pulled across Dean's lips reassured him.
Castiel moved a little closer to Dean under the guise of turning away from the DVD player. He sat with his legs folded underneath him, a measured smile on his face. “Are you asking me if I’m dominant or submissive?”
“Fuck you mean? Sigil’s fine. Blockin’ angels left and right.” How
Cas just wiggled his body even closer, his back arching to press his chest towards Dean, as if the sight alone wasn’t enough of a temptation. He could still see those damn bruises on Cas’s neck where someone else had claimed him as theirs. It burned deep in Dean’s stomach, the feeling of possession he so often pushes away when he’s around Cas. He’s never felt free to
The rest of Castiel's day went by without a hitch, and he didn't spot Dean again after their first period.
“Am I still driving?”
The diner was just like any other they’d eaten at, so they fell into their usual routine.
Cas rolled his eyes at Dean, grabbing the newspaper he had given Dean earlier, placing it back in his hands to change the subject. “Maybe then it’s your future since you started the fire. You have all the girls fawning over you all the time.” Cas hoped his tone came across as teasing and not jealous, of neither Dean nor the girls he dates.
Mood swings with the intensity of teenage boy puberty.
Dean was the one to pull back, and he cracked a grin at the way Castiel whined and tried to chase his lips. His own heart was beating fast enough that he could feel it in his throat.
“Since you’re staying tonight, you coming out with me and all the guys tomorrow?”
When he finished the stitches, Castiel brushed his fingertips across Dean’s unmarried skin above the injury, the touch much less clinical now, dancing from his chest up to his collarbone, distracting Dean with one touch as his other hand moved between them. Dean almost let out a reflexive yelp when Cas wrapped his hand around his ankle, but he stifled it with a quiet gasp. It was just a second, Cas moving his legs further apart and then just... releasing his grip without following through on any of the fantasies now swirling around in Dean’s brain. He simply opened the cabinet drawer between Dean’s calves, but something about the touch still made Dean feel like he was out of breath.
Dean and Cas were… Well, Dean and Cas, but this time with more open communication and a scruffy dog. Things couldn’t be more
“Dude, S’not like I can’t kill you with those. You’re an angel. That’d be like. A nerf-gun shot to the back at worst for you, right?”
had to be normal.
showed clear across his face because Cas smiled to reassure him, and motioned for him to get up as well. “Yeah, I have. Most of my ideas involve a bed, so…” Castiel tipped his head towards his room, and Dean wasn’t sure if he’d ever gotten up off the couch so quickly in his life.
“You’re bullshitting.
, or maybe
Dean wanted to bury his head in the pillow and scream.
The soft thumps of the bed against the wall turned more frantic, & the man’s moans reached a fever pitch. Dean chases after his pleasure, sliding onto his back & turning his head to bite his pillow, needing to stay silent. He couldn’t risk being heard, he couldn’t risk not hearing.
Cas seemed to be recalling the event as well.
He moved with such purpose and conviction that Dean thought for a moment Cas was reaching for his hand, but before he could panic at the thought, Cas was flipping over his mug as well and indicating to the coffee again.
A moment later, she was back with the coffee carafe, pouring a cup into Castiel’s upturned mug.
Dean came down from his orgasm, immediately turning the full focus on Cas. He reached down between them, grabbing their cocks where they still slid together, now messy with Dean’s release. Dean was sensitive, but he didn’t care, he wanted this for Cas, wanted to see Cas like this so he could remember it forever. He didn’t tease, but he didn’t rush, just steadily stroked Cas and himself, his hips twitching slightly at the contact. He was content staying here forever, just making Castiel spill the prettiest noises, pull the prettiest faces.
Dean all along.
“We have a special on our queen bed available if you book more than three nights, or are you two just passing through?”
. Cas pulled away from the curb and onto the mostly deserted streets. Late nights like this always meant a later call time tomorrow, and Cas let his mind wander down his to-do list at his condo while he kept his focus firmly away from the backseat. (No matter how hard it might be, he
“I handed you a fuckin’ napkin.” Dean’s shoulders slumped, his mind racing.
. Dean found he didn’t mind too much, since it was a true smile that bent the angel’s lips up and exposed his teeth and shocked Dean with its purity. “Before this body, I had not been on earth since before the moving picture was invented.”
Dean laughed, “That you are. Wanna stop that? Tell me your name, maybe? Why you’re actually here?”
"No, no, no, it's
“Mmm, Not sure, doc.” Dean felt the heat radiating off of Castiel’s body where they still pressed together. That was what fueled the next choice Dean made, not giving himself time to second guess it before he put a careful hand on Castiel’s bicep to steady himself. Dean slid off the counter and directly onto Castiel’s claimed ground in one fluid motion, despite the lack of room. Castiel could easily step back to give Dean space, but he didn’t seem to notice how close they were, let alone how suddenly it had escalated. Dean hummed as if contemplating the question further and definitely not simply caught up in the way he could see every single detail on Castiel’s face. “Any doctor’s orders?”
Dean, still hearing the footsteps, only one pair at least, crept over to his duffle and pulled out his shotgun. Blowing a massive hole in its head is a relatively safe bet when you don’t know what the thing is yet, let alone how to kill it. Once armed, nothing was keeping him from heading up the stairs, and nothing holds Dean back from a kill, or the possibility of one, or whatever.
Castiel pulled the key out of Dean’s back pocket slowly, somehow not disturbing the receipt graveyard located there, and pressed it into Dean’s palm.
Dean and Gilda continued their friendly small talk, but Castiel could sense it was just that. Dean wasn't here to see her; he was waiting for someone. Did Dean know it was him? Was he waiting for Castiel to stand up? Castiel couldn't even hear specific words anymore, his head was filled with cotton, and his heart was in his throat.
Castiel still thought he must be dreaming, especially as he took in a deep breath, inhaling a hit of
, mere feet away, and the next moment, he's covered in glitter, and Charlie is all but forcing Dean away from the table, from what Castiel could hear.
Dean scoffed, managing his tone despite the man straddling his hips and the gun still pointed at him. “Usually, my pistol is backup for the shotgun. So, when you tackled me, and that fell, I was gonna pull that out if things got hairy.” Dean went with the most literal answer, hoping he’d annoy the man off-topic and eventually out of the fucking house so Dean could rest up for some early morning witch-hunting. “So, what are you using my gun for?”
“I’m a little busy putting our movie on like you asked me to. Will you ever learn some patience?” Cas sighed, pointedly not turning to face him, just pulling the correct movie off the shelf and opening the case. Dean pouted, never one for patience when he had other options at his disposal. Once Cas leaned down, getting onto his hands and knees to access the DVD player, he was much closer to Dean, his shirt still riding up, and therefore he was able to correctly identify the small mark on Castiel’s skin.
That thought came to Dean as they reached the end of their tour, back to the couch where they had started, and Castiel didn’t try to hide his eavesdropping. Dean watched as the curious look behind Castiel’s eyes dropped into recognition as he stepped into Dean’s space, crowding in behind him. Dean gave up on trying to crane his neck to watch, a noise of protest dying in his throat as Castiel grabbed one of his wrists.
Once the photo snapped, the expression of contentment over Cas's face immediately warped into an accusatory look at the camera phone.
Cas tilted his head just a bit at Dean’s reaction, which was almost surely some mess of defensive anger and forced stoicism.
Dean was
Dean pulled up to a stoplight, his left hand tapping furiously on his knee, right arm stick-straight where it rested on the wheel as a makeshift and entirely ineffective barrier between him and Cas. He ignored the way the angel next to him was clearly trying to get his attention, pointedly glancing between the cross street in front of them and the unblinking, unactivated turn signal on the dashboard. The way his eyes widened was entirely comical in Dean’s peripheral as if to shout for attention with just a glance, but Dean refused Castiel the satisfaction of seeing the smile he instead forced down.
“Yes, of course.” Castiel easily hopped up and spun around, moving to straddle Dean, the shock in the man’s eyes only evident for a moment before Cas was, in fact, sitting right onto his lap. Dean was suddenly very aware of the presence of his arousal, hard and telling. Castiel was undeterred if anything encouraged by his effects on Dean. Cas was rutting slightly against Dean’s lap, wherever he could reasonably fit in an excuse to readjust without blatantly grinding down against Dean.
