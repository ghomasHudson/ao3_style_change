“I’ll only be gone a week,” Tony mumbled into his mouth like he’d read Steve’s mind, breaking off and looking up at Steve with a soft smile. “It’ll fly by, I promise.”
Steve glanced up, looking over at Stark from across the room. He was stood by the doors of what was left of the common room with a half-empty glass of scotch in hand, while the other pressed up against the reactor. Steve had heard what had happened down in the stairwell—he knew that Loki had taken the Tesseract too.
The door clicked shut behind him and the room fell into silence, nothing but the steady thump of Tony’s heart sounding off in the little hospital room. Steve couldn’t take his eyes off the bruises. The way Tony’s leg was suspended in the air, casted and bound. Femurs didn’t break easily. Strongest bone in the body, and Steve had crushed it like it was glass under his foot. He remembered the sound it had made when it had broken.
Steve paused, biting his lip. He could just brush it off, he figured. Tony would probably know he was lying, but he’d understand all the same. And Steve really didn’t want to bother Tony with the same old stupid stuff- ‘my mom’s dead and I’m sad about it again, blah blah blah’- he must surely be getting bored of that by now.
Steve nodded with a sigh, biting his lip. He did know that; Bucky was right. Dammit.  “I hate when you talk sense,” he muttered as he slid off his jacket and hung it on the rack.
“And if you seriously think that, you don’t know yourself well enough either,” Steve told him, “Tony, Jesus, look-“
“You are the most awesome, kind… hot… kind guy I know,” the man continued solemnly, taking Tony’s hands and squeezing, “you make me pancakes for breakfast sometimes and I love you. And you’re really hot, did I- did I mention that? Like, Jesus fuckin’ Mary and Joseph, that
“Don’t worry, I have access to the car’s locking mechanism,” JARVIS assured him, and a moment later Steve heard the faint click as the doors of the car unlocked.
“Oh, shut up Tiberius,” Thor interrupted with a roll of his eyes, kicking up his legs and resting them on a spare seat as he folded his arms and glared up at the other boy, “just go watch the fight and leave Tony alone. You heard him the first eight million times, right? He isn’t interested.”
Steve gaped at him in bewilderment. Why the hell would Tony offer up something like that? It made no sense. Not only was Steve going off on the whim of a genocidal Norse Demi-God, but also, Tony didn’t really owe him shit. They weren’t friends. Steve had been an asshole to him and Tony had been an asshole back.
Tony didn’t answer to that one, and when Steve glanced over to him again, he saw the boy’s face suddenly freeze up in the reflection of the mirror before he turned his head jerkily downward and away from him. Sensing he’d just misstepped, he grabbed a pillow and then flung it toward the back of Tony’s head. “Joke,” he confirmed, “that was a joke, Tony. Horrifyingly enough, I’m actually enjoying waking up early on a Saturday morning this time.”
Or, a better way of saying it was that the fault-lines became more obvious. Tony realised that most of them weren’t even belonging to Steve.
He settled Peter onto the towel and then smiled down at him, grabbing a corner of the towel and curling it over the little boy’s body, giving him a rub. It made Peter’s legs start kicking again, and he grabbed them with the tips of his podgy fingers, smiling up at Steve. “You like that, huh?” Steve asked quietly, and Tony bit his lip to stop himself from actively swooning over the cuteness of it all. Peter was small, but when compared to Steve, the kid was positively minuscule, his whole head spanning nothing more than the width of Steve’s hand. But Steve was gentle, so very gentle as he tucked his finger under Peter’s chin and then crooked a finger, tickling him lightly. When Peter squirmed and giggled again, Steve’s whole face lit up.
He blinked rapidly and looked down, blinking back the stinging tears. No, no, he was being irrational. He’d probably had that one coming. He knew if the situations were reversed- if he’d watched Steve flirt with someone in front of millions of people, he’d feel humiliated and angry too. And he and Steve... they weren’t like normal couples. Their relationship wasn’t normal. Tensions were always running higher, and Steve was just used to solving things with his hands. It wasn’t like Tony couldn’t handle it anyway. He was strong. He was a superhero.
He decided on moving, instead of speaking- reaching out and prodding Bruce with a finger. He smiled weakly when the man jumped. “Jesus, Steve- you’re awake. Good. Hey. How you feeling, buddy?”
“You can’t handle fireworks?” Tony asked again, and shit, it didn’t seem like he had missed that like Steve had hoped.
They hadn’t actually had sex yet, which was a little frustrating. Obviously, Tony was happy to wait for as long as necessary until Steve was ready, except he got the feeling that Steve
Immediately, Tony watched his head jerk up at the noise, and he felt a brief wave of annoyance toward Clint. It was 12 at night, after all, and Steve had been happily nuzzling right up to Tony, until the damn birdbrain had blundered in-
But Loki remained standing in his position, not leaving, nor sitting back down to stay. Steve didn’t have the energy to comment any further on the matter, so he just turned back to Tony, his finger running repetitively up and down his collarbone while he slept.
Steve shrugged. His fingers were tapping against his leg again- a habit he’d only picked up a few weeks ago, and now seemed to do constantly. “Wanted to be ready if we got another call. SHIELD said there was a chance they’d come back again.”
A second passed in which Tony considered approximately 189 different scenarios and outcomes before landing on the one that he thought could work. He opened his eyes and grabbed Steve’s hand.
Oh. Alright then. Tony looked down at the baby with a small frown and a disappointed little clenching in his heart, fingers brushing gently at the blankets wrapped around him. Honestly, he wasn't even sure if the kid was a boy. He'd just assumed from the blue blanket with rockets on it.
But Steve didn’t even really consider that for longer than a fraction of a second. He never could, even if he wanted to. Which he didn’t. Despite everything he’d found out over the past 24 hours about the man he’d used to love, Steve would still never be able to do that to him.
been known to be pretty contrary sometimes.” He grinned cheekily, but then leaned down and fluttered his eyelashes against Tony’s cheek- and God, that was such a Steve thing to do, Tony had never met
“Okay, calm down,” Tony raised his hands quickly and rushed over, dropping to his knees next to them and looking at Peter incredulously. He wasn’t even holding on, his fingertips were simply…. Stuck to Steve’s palm as Steve held it up in the air and hyperventilated in front of him. “Deep breaths, Steve. You did fine. I think… I think I just worked out what the person who left him meant, when they wrote ‘he’s one of you’.”
Steve lifted his head and looked at both of them. “You haven’t got a fucking clue to how to make friends either, do you?” He asked, and immediately both Bucky and Peggy shook their heads and made noises of apology.
“Steve, that’s not the point…” Tony sighed and leaned back, head falling back into the pillows. Barely even a minute into consciousness, and Steve could feel the tension leeching back into his body under his hands. It was distressing to watch. “I have responsibilities—I know what I act like, but I do actually give a shit about my company—”
Steve ran his hand down Peter’s head to the back of his neck, and Peter squeaked and jumped, causing Steve to pull back hastily, eyes going wide. “Shit, what’d I do,” he blurted, “did I—”
Steve was up a second later, two hands pulling both Bucky and Tony up off the floor. “You okay?” He asked Tony quietly, once again doing a cursory check.
“Did the footage reveal anything else of interest?” Thor asked with a deep frown, folding his arms into his chest and pulling his jaw tight. “anything we could use to find them?”
"I vote Tony and Steve," Clint said, and Steve shot him a mutinous glare, "two superheroes are better than one, and their room is probably, like, homely, yeah? Nice happy family and stuff."
“SAM!” She burst into the corridor like a very small hurricane, smile splitting her face as she spotted them both, “Sam, sweetie, I’m going to need to borrow your friend for just a quick sec-“
Bucky turned quickly back to the road, but he stole glances Steve’s way instead. “What the fuck?” He repeated, tapping his fingers across the wheel, “why the fuck would he… and he didn’t apologize or offer any explanation? Nothing?”
“Is that what we are, then?” Steve blurted before his brain-to-mouth filter could kick in and stop him. He saw Tony’s brow crease and hurried to expand: “I mean… you called me- and I was just wondering if that’s… you know. A Thing now. Definitely.”
Steve laughed, nodding along with her despite the fact that it wasn’t quite the truth. He wasn’t exactly sure how to word what he wanted to say- but she remained silent and waited patiently for him, and for that he was grateful.
Tony sighed, taking Steve’s hand from his face and then kissing his fingers before letting go. “No promises,” he muttered, before looking up at Steve. “Stay safe. I love you too.”
He spotted the blanket, folded neatly back in place on the shelf, and as he wandered over to the couch he caught sight of a small note lying in the middle of the cushions, Tony’s familiar scrawl standing out easily amongst the dull yellow.
But Tony merely shrugged. “Who said it was for him?” He asked haughtily, before marching down the corridor with Steve’s laughter trailing behind him
He’d woken up in a shit mood, he’d looked at his phone and the corresponding text messages and then fallen into an even shittier mood, and now his idiot best friend was at his door trying to talk to him.
“No,” he shook his head in desperation, voice barely even making his words into a coherent form as he tried to hold back the chokes. He was already feeling drained, just from the few minutes being spent with Tony. It had used to be months before the effects would start. Tony had always been fascinated by his ability to withstand the magic demons carried- angels were never supposed to be in the same space as their kind for that long. It was how nature had designed them both.
“Movie night,” Steve muttered, “switched their phones off. I was gonna get pizza. Got lost. Now I’m near fucking Turner Street and I don’t know where Turner street
“We should get icecream,” he declared, whilst the other half of his brain groaned in despair and cringed wildly. “I feel like I owe you at least an icecream. A thank-you-for-not-abandoning-me-at-a-stranger’s-party icecream.”
As he wandered into the kitchen to grab a quick slice of toast before heading up to bed, he realised with surprise that Steve was still there, stood leaning rigidly against the countertops. There was a mug of coffee at his side, but it wasn’t steaming. Must’ve been there for quite a while. Tony blinked in surprise at the sight of him, having fully expected the man to be in bed already- Steve was a stickler to his routine, and 11pm was usually his cut-off point.
He laid his hands, gentle, on Tony’s shoulders. Looked at the almost perfect red circle painted on his temple. He was lying on his side, but Steve could see the crimson as it began to spread through the grey snow below his head, like a perfect halo dampening his dark curls. Exit wound was always bigger than entry.
some shade of red?” Tony asked quietly, and when Steve glanced up at him he saw he was holding back on another laugh, lips pursed and eyes looking down at him softly.
Looking nervously around him, he counted out each one of the team, all perched on various chairs, laps, or straight up just sleeping on the floor in Clint’s case. Closest to him was Steve, his head laid uncomfortably against the side of Tony’s bed as his hand still remained clasped loosely around Tony’s. On his other side was Bucky, Natasha nestled in a ball under his neck and resting quietly. Bruce and Thor were somehow managing to balance on one single chair in the corner of the room- Tony was pretty sure that Thor was straight up sleep-squatting in order to make room for Bruce.
Their foreheads touched, and when Tony looked at him, Steve felt like he was seeing his own life falling back into place around him; all those jagged edges and raw pieces he’d become desensitized to finally finding their homes in the right places, smoothing out, making him whole again.
“I’ll want you when you’re sad. I’ll want you when you’re angry, or being an asshole, or every time when you won’t be able to tell me how you feel for me. I’ll want you. Because I have done for so long now, I’m not even sure i know how to stop.”
It meant that he could curl up in Tony’s arms at 11 in the morning, lying on his bed and drifting in and out of consciousness with not even the slightest amount of worry that he was screwing something up.
“I know that you keep it quiet,” Ty continued, something glinting in his eye, “I know you avoid photos and take extra measure to stop yourself getting caught out. To anyone who doesn’t know you, Steve Rogers barely even exists in your life.” He glanced over to Steve and cocked his head. “How does that feel, by the way? Knowing your own boyfriend is too ashamed to be seen with you? He never did that when we were fucking.”
“Wow. Confident for a guy about to get his ass beat.” Initiating the fire protocols in the suit, Tony felt as the nozzles underneath his shoulderplates extended, and a second later a plume of fire extinguisher was being sprayed in the direction of his assailant.
“Your shirt’s still damp,” Steve murmured after a moment, his thumbs brushing across the soggy material over Tony’s shoulders, “shall we get that off you?”
He sat down on the edge of the bathtub, watching Tony lazily as the man leaned down into the sink and spat, cleaning his toothbrush under the running water before stuffing it back onto the shelf and pulling out the rest of his grooming kit. He had a whole routine, did Tony, and he kept to it religiously. Steve loved watching him do it, although he wasn’t entirely sure why. There was simply something strangely hypnotic about the way Tony took care of himself; how he gently plucked any stray hairs from his eyebrows, applied his expensive creams around his face and occasionally, if going out in public or over to important conferences, would swipe powder over his forehead and cheeks or concealer under his eyes. Seeing as this was an easy day for the two of them, however, there was none of that. Merely the basics- his toner and moisturizer, and a few little plucks of stray eyebrow hair that had grown back in.
Steve looked between Peter and Tony for a few seconds, before awkwardly shuffling around and then dipping his hand into the warm water. Peter watched him somewhat curiously- to the little boy, Steve was still probably a relative stranger. But he didn’t get scared or start to cry, merely remained quiet and watchful as Steve carefully let the water trickle from his palms and onto Peter’s head. “Just give it a little rub,” Tony informed him, “clean out any dirt that’s sticking around.”
The teacher eyed him up; watching the hopping feet for a second before sighing. “If you’re quick. Pass is on the desk.”
And god- Tony wanted to just let it go, like Steve was telling him to. He wanted to get back to the screaming; he wanted to ask why the hell Steve had been so rude and cold and distant over the past few weeks; why he’d chosen to drive off to fucking
Now he was here, however, he was caught between climbing out of the window and jumping down onto Tony’s porch directly underneath him in order to sneak out, or just telling Bucky to go back home and then waiting around for Tony to see if he was okay. He’d been on edge when he’d left the room, and Steve knew that Tony was currently downstairs covering all that panic up completely as he talked to whatever clients that Howard had shoved onto him. When he got back and took off that nonchalant mask, however, Steve worried about all that fear crawling right back, even worse than before.
There was a rumble in the distance, and the ground shook underneath them, but neither of them jumped to their feet. Neither reacted at all, really. They knew it was too late now. Too late for them, anyway.
Steve shrugged, letting his thumb brush up against Tony’s bottom lip for a moment, before he ducked down and pressed a soft kiss there.
With a final racketing choke, his face crumbled and he felt the sting of hot tears as they spilled over on to his cheeks. He was emotionally exhausted, he was hurt, and so was Tony. Because of
His head hit something soft, and when he focused back in, he realised it was a chest. “Hello!” The chest said happily, and Steve frowned, “are you well, my friend?”
“God, I’m going to hate you in the morning,” Tony said quietly to his catatonic husband, looking behind him one last time and thinking of the terrible stiffness in his neck that he was going to wake up to. Steve didn’t respond, obviously- and Tony’s eyes found themselves drifting down, over to Steve’s left hand that was resting on the couch cushion. The gold band blinked back at him, and Tony smiled tiredly.
“Not like that,” Tony said softly, waving a hand in dismissal. His smile was light as he said “Steve Rogers, hate to break it to you, but you are simply far too genuine for a dump like this. These places are reserved for assholes only. Hence,” he waved at himself, and then around the now empty room.
The sound of a humming noise had him looking up, and when the elevator doors opened a few seconds later, he assumed it would be one of any aforementioned team members. But it wasn’t.
“Were you talking to someone?” Tony asked a moment later, before his eyes narrowed. “JARVIS? What were you gossiping to Steve about? They better have been good things.”
God, it had been an hour and Steve was still thinking about that stupid girl for no reason. Maybe she and Tony were actually dating, for all he knew, and Tony just hadn’t told him about it. Apparently he stared at her in chemistry. Maybe they were together. Maybe maybe
, why did he care- too nice, that was his problem, he just blindly trusted people and every goddamn time it led him here-
“Nothing, nothing. Go, be free, it’s your birthday, you need to relax. I’m happy you’re actually taking a break for onc-”
Quietly, Tony agreed with Thor. But he also understood exactly where Steve was coming from, seeing as he’d gone through this exact same conversation with Clint a few minutes earlier. He and Steve were going out for a long overdue date night, so tonight they were leaving the rest of the team to get Peter to bed. It was a task that had been performed exclusively by Tony and Steve ever since Pete had arrived, and so handing over responsibility was proving… strangely difficult. Peter was notoriously hard to calm, and over the last few weeks he and Steve had worked out a very particular system for doing it. It was a careful process, with many steps involved. Tony and Steve leaving tonight may well prove cataclysmic.
His momentum carried him all the way over to a mere three feet away from Tony’s door, before he finally had a vaguely coherent thought and realized with a lurch that maybe, just maybe, visiting Tony after hours when none of the team were around and Tony was still severely injured might not be the best idea. His shoes slid to an uncomfortable-sounding halt against the linoleum and he froze where he stood, hand half-outstretched for the door handle.
Natasha was quiet, and Steve figured she was probably remembering that day too. Maybe minus the kissing. “Well, guess we just gotta make do with whatever it is we have left,” she said, unsheathing a pistol as the creatures started to scrabble through the energy wall. Steve nodded, and when he caught her eye, there was something knowing in them. “He loved you too, you know,” she said softly, so that no one else could hear it but them, “even afterward. I spoke to him about it once, when I visited. He still loved you, Steve.”
Of course, the final Christmas that Steve had got to spend with her was both better and worse. They’d had no idea that it was about to get so bad so fast, and so she’d still been at work, slogging away at her desk. Although due to her illness, they had ended up giving her a lot more leave and working her earlier hours, meaning that Steve had managed to spend more time with her during that month than any other December previously. Of course though, Steve hadn’t cherished it in the way he should’ve. Fifteen and selfish, he’d spent a lot of his time out with Bucky and Peggy, hanging out with them as opposed to looking after his mom like he should’ve been. She never held it against him- in fact, she’d always been glad when he went out- but that was beside the point. The final month that Steve would ever get to spend with her, and he hadn’t treasured every moment like it was sacred. He’d just wasted it.
Steve turned; letting go of Tony and hitching his shield up. “Try not to get shot,” he murmured, before stepping in front of the smaller man and marching on ahead.
He had no idea what he was supposed to do. No idea where the hell he was even going to start.  This was Tony’s whole fragile life, crumbling to pieces in front of him. Where was Tony going to live? How was he going to get by? He didn’t know how much time Tony had had between fighting with Howard and actually leaving the house, so he didn’t know how much stuff Tony had managed to take with him. A suitcase, maybe? Or not even that?
God. Okay. No. Concentrate on the popcorn, Steve thought to himself hurriedly, shaking the thoughts from his mind. “Please don’t say you’ve got a name for her too. I’m not ready to deal with two of you.”
“It was an asshole living up to his title as- well an asshole,” Thor responded. Steve, who had been watching Tony and Ty until the moment they turned the corner, finally turned back around fully, a deep frown on his face.
It was very easy not to notice when they were alone together. Tony was just… Tony, really, and Steve didn’t think about anything else. Sometimes it crossed his mind how clever Tony was- usually when they were over at his and he was talking to JARVIS or fiddling around with some other invention or having to run off and write another algorithm down. But that was it, really. He didn’t think about the fact that most people were at least somewhat familiar with the name Tony Stark. It wasn’t important.
“Just out of curiosity, what exactly did you do?” Tony asked, shoving his hands in his pockets and leaning his head back against the wall. He looked absolutely casual- he probably made this trip on a weekly basis, after all.
The message was right there, however. It was just one file; a video clip, about ten seconds long. Underneath it were five words:
“As if I’d ever let you make a scene like that in my cafeteria,” Natasha poked him across the table, “this place is for eating and sleeping only. You’d have to take it to the courts, and by that time you’d have lost interest anyway.”
Steve was selfish and tired enough to take it. Desperately, more than anything else in the world, Steve yearned to just touch him. Trace his fingertips across each mark on his face, kiss them better, say he was so, so,
for eachother. We are the only fucking people on this planet who actually understand one another.” He’d reached touching distance of Tony by that point, and Tony pointedly looked away from him, arms folded, jaw set stubbornly. He wasn’t going to back down and apologise. Not tonight.
“Aw, my heart goes out to you,” Tony reached behind him and patted Steve’s cheek, and then, because he was a bit of dick, he rolled his hips back into Steve, grinning even harder when Steve’s breath caught and his hands flexed against Tony’s hips. Poor super-soldier hormones made the man insatiable when he got turned on. And it was just so fun to tease him. “Go wait in bed. I’ll be out in a minute.”
Sam paused, eyes narrowing slightly as he looked over Steve. But it seemed he believed him- at least a little bit- because in the end he just sighed and walked forward, throwing himself on Steve’s bed dramatically. “Well good, because Nat and Clint are coming over today for a study session, and I’m pretty sure they’re bringing friends. So you can either stay up here and suffer alone, or you can pool your suffering into a larger area and share it with a bunch of other people.”
Too late. Tony turned around and looked at Steve enquiringly just as DUM-E clipped the edge of the long, dangerously humming pole. Steve’s eyes widened. “Move,” he said instantly, lurching forward as he watched the pole start to waver, “Tony, get out of the way!”
He staggered back, the wind making a hissing noise as Steve’s fingers whipped through the air. He lifted a hand to cover his cheek and then sent out another one to steady his body against the counter. It stung with sharp pain; sharper than a normal slap would. Then again, it was Steve. He was stronger than just a normal slap.
There were murmurs of agreement around the room, and after they’d all piled their orders into him, Natasha chucked the money into his hands. “Hurry up, Steven- you should be able to make it before the best scene at the end if you’re quick.”
Tony stared at them for another few seconds, before a smile broke out on his face, and he looked at Clint, eyes sparkling. “Thank you. I’m going to savour the fuck out of these for
Steve stared at him for a moment, and Bucky glared back- and then both of them burst into laughter at the same time. He could taste the stale air in his throat as he gasped for breath, and his hand found Bucky’s shoulder, clutching tight as they both giggled.
stuck around with were either people we were dumb enough to trust or-“ Rhodey’s face turned sour, and the muscle in his jaw twitched a little.
“Jesus, you do realise that if I hadn’t been there, he’d still be freezing out on the streets, right?” Tony asked, “I did you a fucking favour.”
“Text him and tell him you’re okay and you’re with me, but I’m not driving you back,” Bucky shook his head, “Steve, the situation was dangerous for both of you. Just because he was having a crisis doesn’t make the things that he did to you okay. It might excuse them, but it doesn’t mean you should put yourself back in that environment again.”
“You would probably call this a hallucinogenic,” she continued, circling like a vulture, “but we like to call it the eternity drug. Want to know why?”
“You can just tell us, Steve,” she murmured gently, “if you tell us, we promise we won’t lay a finger on Tony. We just want you to comply. That’s all. We just need you to tell us where the Winter Solider is, and Tony won’t get hurt.
Interesting- to see the same feeling reflected back in another person’s eyes. To know that…that he wasn’t alone.
“Look, I’m calling it a night,” Clint said, after Steve didn’t respond to his previous statement. He got to his feet quietly and looked between Steve and Tony, a pained expression in his eyes. “You look after one another, ‘kay?” He said, gently punching Steve’s shoulder. “You need eachother.”
“Thank you— wait, woah, I’m not cute!” Tony leaned back, frowning deeply as he pointed at the ears Steve had slid onto his head earlier. “I am hot, I am
“Hey, watch it,” Steve looked up sharply and glared, and Clint hastily backtracked, shaking his head hurriedly.
When Steve starts closing himself off- Tony knows it’s because they’re coming up to the day Bucky died. When Clint gets drunk on a monday morning, he cross-references it with all the other times he’s noticed it happen and realises that each time, it was because he’d been made to spend the whole day at SHIELD with a task-force who still blame him for his mind control.
He was being so stupid. It had just been a prank. A stupid prank, and one that hadn’t even been intended for him, he was sure. Clint would never have been that insensitive. He’d known that Tony should have been away for the day at a business meeting, he’d had no idea that it had been cancelled and Tony had decided to come home early, walking through the door just two minutes before Bruce had been supposed to. He and Clint had some stupid little prank war going on- that’s why he’d rigged up the stupid water bomb thing. And it… it was
They both huffed in amusement, Steve getting to his feet and then pulling Tony up with him. Peter made another little noise, but aside from pawing uncoordinatedly at his face for a few seconds, he remained pliant and asleep in Tony’s arms. Natasha wandered forward and then leaned down, kissing the little boy’s forehead lightly as she passed. Tony knew that she had a soft spot for the boy too-- then again, pretty much all of them did, by this point. It had been a week, which objectively wasn’t long, but… for some reason, it felt like it was. It felt like Peter had already grown since Tony’s first picked him up.
Steve didn’t speak. He didn’t think he’d be able to bear putting the reality of it out there—that this was his fault. Instead, he just smoothed his hand back across Tony’s face and grabbed the new pile of clothes from the side.
He couldn’t go. Steve was right. God- if Tony had just kept his mouth shut in the first place, Steve would probably not even have touched him. He always did this, always made it worse for himself. He was just a fucking idiot.
Tony broke away, turning his head to find the source of the noise, but Steve seemed entirely unfazed- simply using Tony’s turned head as an excuse to press soft kisses along his exposed neck instead.
“Tony,” Steve said quietly, looking up to him with a slowly growing expression of dread on his face, “I didn’t… what happened?”
There was an awkward silence, and both Clint and Sam’s eyebrows shot up as they stared at him. Steve just looked back at them, trying not to blush under their gazes.
Steve nodded and moved over to the door once again. He wondered if he’d be able to move the conference table against it, stop anyone else getting in. His heart was racing under his chest, mentally calculating how long it was going to take someone to find them. The alarm had been set off a few minutes ago, a two-tone whine that informed everyone there was a breach in security. That meant that all SHIELD agents that reported to this compound would be alerted, sleeping or no, and they would be rushing in to act as backup. Those agents still in the building would already be searching; starting at the bottom floor and working their way up. This was a conference floor mostly, so there would be no one around. But the one above was a training room, and below was for offices, so that meant they were pretty much surrounded on all sides.
Thor just looked at him for a moment, before grinning bashfully and then taking the joint out of his mouth. “Uh,” he began, “I took a very long toilet break. About fifteen minutes ago. That ended up taking me over to my car. And you know, I was already there, so I thought I might as well just stay until the end of class, y’know?”
“Tony, leave it,” he said urgently, pulling him back- but Ty wasn’t done, and he followed them like a hunter with eyes on its target.
Steve fast seemed to be running out of confidence, because he was getting smaller and smaller in his seat. “Yes,” he confirmed, “and I know- I get if you don’t feel the same, that’s fine and we don’t have to change anything, I just thought… you have such a low opinion of yourself, but if you saw yourself through my eyes you’d see that I’d never
Tony paused, and then Steve heard the sound of rustling next to him. Looking to the side curiously, he watched Tony pick up the pencil that had been in Steve’s hand and then scratch in the answers on Steve’s book, one after the other. He watched, more than a little fascinated, as Tony methodically worked through each one of them and then put down the pencil thirty seconds later, Steve’s book now complete with the answers. He hadn’t even done any working out.
He breathed in again, this time through his mouth. In his mind’s eye, he could still see Tony. In his mind’s eye, Howard had followed through with his threat.
“Just returning this,” Steve pulled his bag off his shoulder and marched forward, digging his fingers into the opening and tugging at Tony’s jacket. He kept his eyes fixed on Tony’s as he shoved the thing into his chest, hard. “Sorry for being such an inconvenience to you these past few weeks,” he hissed quietly, voice stiff.
“Goodnight,” Steve said. He didn’t even turn and look at him as he slammed out of Tony’s house, and the sound reverberating heavily in the corridor where Tony was still stood, staring at the vacated space while his heart thumped in his chest. He took an aborted step forward. Steve said not to follow him. And Tony had already done enough damage tonight.
“Hawkeye, do we have a pinpoint on the main testing facility?” He barked out quietly as he crept around the second corner and then spotted a gaggle of lanky scientists quietly try and vacate the premises through a not-so-hidden corridor. They’d be rounded up by SHIELD retrieval as soon as they reached the perimeter, so they were very much not Steve’s problem. What they had been working on, however, most certainly was.
“Yes,” Steve bit irritably. He was an idiot, maybe, but he wasn’t a fucking child- he could handle a bit of noise.
"But you've put pictures up of him before," Bucky's eyes narrowed a little as he turned to Steve, and Steve could just Goddamn
But JARVIS was right. That would not make a difference. He was an irrelevance, a speck in this huge equation.
Tensely, Bruce nodded. “On it,” he snapped, turning away from the fight at hand and then following in Thor’s footsteps, sparing one last glance behind him at Tony before breaking out into a sprint.
The guy nodded, obviously relieved as he backed away and walked off quickly. Steve was just left there, more than a little confused. “What in the fuck?” He asked Natasha after a few moments.
He looked around at his friends, noting the varying degrees of pity they had on their faces. Which was pretty annoying, seeing as they had no idea what was going on, not really.
“Hi, James, it’s- uh, it’s me. Steve,” he began, suddenly wondering what the hell he was going to say.
When Steve woke up the next morning, however, he didn’t think about that. He got up and went normally through his routine, brushing his teeth and flatting his hair down, not feeling anything strange happening under his ribs. In fact, the whole event slipped from his mind, and he left the bathroom with a little skip in his step as he looked back to the bed where Tony was still curled up and sleeping. When Tony had days off Stark Industries work, he tended to lie in until at least ten, as opposed to Steve’s rigid body-clock forcing him up at 7 on the dot.
Steve settled back down in his spot beside Tony’s head, losing himself in his own thoughts once more. It was the easiest place to go while he waited for the next time he’d need to wake Tony up. He had no idea what he was going to do in the morning. It was a school day—but Tony couldn’t go to school, not in this state, and Steve couldn’t leave him. How was he going to explain this to the Wilsons? They’d realise he was gone in the morning if he just didn’t show up for breakfast, so Steve was going to have to call them to explain.
Steve shook his head, and then hissed when it sent a jolt of pain blaring behind his temples. “Don’t apologise,” he muttered, palms putting pressure on his closed eyes, “apologising is my job.”
“Good people can do bad things,” he started slowly, hands coming forward to rest on his knees, “but it doesn’t make them bad people. However, you’ve got to remember-- good people can turn into bad people, sometimes. Or they can just... maybe it can just be you that they start to treat badly, or someone else, or a group of people. And even.. even if you knew them when they were good, and you still think they
He took Tony’s hand, and a second later Rhodey took his other. Tony looked between them, the laughter petering out.
She eyed him blankly for a moment, but then chose to allow an expression to fall over her face. Sadness. She touched his cheek. “I wish you didn’t think things like that,” she murmured, “Tony, we’re family. That is what Christmas is for. Going home, being with loved ones. And seeing as the majority of us didn’t even
"Who the fuck in their right mind gets on with Zeke?" Clint looked at Sam, entirely unimpressed, "no, you fool- he and Tony hate eachother. Have done for years- are you blind?"
Steve ended up spending a lot of his time in Tony’s workshop, after that. What had initially started out as a work-partnership in order for Steve to try and track down his long-dead best friend, became something of a… habit. Steve could admit, he didn’t have much in this time, didn’t have a place to call home or a comforting spot that made him feel just that little bit less alone. He’d been all set to head out, after the fight in New York. See some of what America had become. But then he’d gotten sidetracked with the whole searching thing, and Tony had offered up a guest bedroom in the tower for Steve after they’d spent the whole night down in the shop, Tony slowly explaining some of the new tech in the world, and it had kind of… stuck.
He pressed a little kiss against Steve’s cheek and turned back to the TV, letting him get on with it.
“Fuck,” Steve swore, blindly trying to to undo the buckles around his chin as the helmet covered his eyes. This was the most embarrassing thing in the whole world, and Steve was never going to leave his room ever again-
He heard a noise, a voice, coming from the other side of the room, and as he rolled back onto his feet and lifted his gun, he saw who was making it. Tucked into the corner with his own weapon pointed directly at Steve, Bruce Banner crouched, bloody and bruised, covering Tony’s body as it lay on the cot behind him.
There was a poignant silence within the four walls of their room as Steve stilled all movement on the bed next to him. Tony bit his lip and looked down at the covers resolutely, knowing how weak-willed that must sound. One bad day, and Tony already wanted to throw back a glass of something or another, uncaring of all the progress he’d made over the past 11 months. Fucking pathetic.
“What happened,” he said numbly, gripping the side of the door so tight he thought his fingers would snap, “oh God, what happened, is he- is he-“
They’d all seen Tony go down earlier, but in the chaos and the fighting, the team had been separated and they’d lost one another. Steve, Thor and Clint had had to keep the brawl going so that the attention was on them and not the others while they’d dragged Tony to safety, but it also meant that now those stupid HYDRA fucks had finally been dealt with, none of them knew where the others actually
Lust hit him faster and more brutally than a fucking freight train. He felt his fingers clench tightly around the edge of the desk and his heartrate just skyrocket- which really had to be unhealthy, but he didn't even care.
– informed him, finally letting go of his arm (pity) as he slammed the doors shut again and then shucked off his coat.
At the sound of Steve’s voice filling the room, he watched Tony’s eyes move slowly, dragging across to the mirror. He knew now, that Steve was behind there. But his face didn’t change. It simply remained pale, lifeless. Defeated. It reminded him of the day Steve had broken it off between them. He’d looked like that then, too.
“Don’t worry darling, I know exactly what I’m doing- it’ll be fun, I promise,” he said smoothly, and Steve was glad he had his head bent over, because he was pretty sure those words alone had turned him firetruck red, and he was talking about fucking
Altogether, Steve could see eight other people in the room. Clint, Bruce and Nat, Sam and Peggy, Sharon and Jan, and of course, Tony, sat next to him and bumping his shoulder. It was loud and bustling, and although he knew they had all not been there for any more than an hour, the whole place already looked as if it had been turned upside down.
Steve made a helpless gesture with his hands, reaching for his own pad and flipping to a clean sheet before sketching out a messy drawing of his mobile phone with its bunch of unread texts on his side.
“Pretty sure my lungs would just give out,” Steve admitted ruefully, “don’t worry yourself Mrs Wilson, I’ll be good as gold.”
Steve was storming toward him in the way he marched over to an enemy, the walk he did when he was planning exactly how to tear his target apart. Tony watched him; all those hundreds of pounds of muscle and strength as it advanced toward him like a freight train going at full speed, not stopping, not slowing down. He had a face like thunder and his fists were clenched, tight and sharp and Tony could calculate how much force was underneath that muscle and sinew and bone. it was a lot- it was a hell of a lot.
“Hell yeah! Bucky Barnes and Peggy Carter, right? You talked about them before- bring ‘em over, yeah, it’ll be good,” Sam clapped his hands excitedly and then apologised when Steve winced, “but tell them to bring all their revision notes and shit. We mean business. We’re not going to get distracted- this test is important.”
He felt the sinking in his stomach. It was really that obvious, then- he didn’t fit in, didn’t fit in Goddamn anywhere anymore-
Tony groaned theatrically again, but then winced as he felt the dull pain flare up in his chest. It was always difficult taking big breaths with the reactor- and it probably didn’t help that it was being squashed by Steve’s chest, but today it seemed a little more poignant than usual.
Tony laughed, shaking his head. “You weren’t an asshole, Steve, I’m pretty sure that’s how most people would have responded. You had no reason to think I wasn’t just out to everyone- there’s enough evidence to tell the whole world. Thing is- the world I live in, outside of you, and outside of school- it runs on a sort of ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ policy. Howard doesn’t ask. I don’t tell. But if he ever caught wind that there was someone serious… it wouldn’t be great.”
“I know.” Steve glanced sideways, absently tucking a damp strand of Peter’s hair back behind his ear. “Let’s put him to bed, shall we?”
Tony just shrugged, making a mental note to give Steve a proper backrub later. The man was more wound up than a Jack in the box.
“No one is doing any more fighting here, thank you very much,” Tony said, raising a hand. When he did, all of his stupid fucking zips jingled. “Morris, Elland- get fucking lost. You’re both getting black eyes tomorrow, and if I see you putting hands on Rogers again then I’m burning your Air Jordans, understand?”
Tony came up from the workshop and joined the rest of the team approximately one hour into the movie they were all watching.
“Oh, as if you haven’t seen Oceans 11 a hundred times,” Tony snapped back at her as she rolled her eyes, “I see the way you look at Clooney, don’t even deny it.”
that would make Tony understand, even if it took all fucking night—but there just wasn’t time. Steve’s chances were gone; he’d screwed everything up,
He smelt the metallic tang that came with a grenade explosion, saw light cascade in front of his eyes, heard the screaming of people falling to gunfire. For a second, he thought that maybe he could save Peggy this time—maybe now he knew what might happen, he’d be able to reach her, push her out of the way before the IED went off—
“Unfortunately not, Sir,” JARVIS admitted apologetically, “however the codebreaker is 98% complete and we will be able to access the contents of the deceased woman’s phone shortly.”
“Mmmf,” Steve squinted up at him and then rolled, turning his head back into the pillows, “are the clocks into double digits yet?”
“Yeah?” He said quietly, trying to keep his voice steady. It could be anything. It could just be Thor saying hey, it could be that he needed a favour, it could be that he wanted to know if Steve had seen Loki anywhere- he’d done that a few times in the past.
Tony didn’t speak again, and Steve didn’t prompt him to. He just sat there, frowning a little as he watched Tony sit with his face inches away and clean up the cut that ran from hairline to eyebrow.
God, who was he kidding? He was always dangerous. Always. And people- fuck, people actually looked up to him for it. They admired him for it when they should be terrified.
Sitting up a little on his elbow, he reached over and pulled the phone off his desk, checking the caller ID. If it was an unknown number, then he was straight-up just going to ignore it.
Small, at first, but then it got louder. And louder. Some sort of crackling, like sparks on a firework, and—
“Oh, totally is,” he admitted, “I’m literally the poster-boy for bad decision-making and unhealthy lifestyle choice. But it doesn’t mean I can’t try and stop you anyway. You’re…” his nose wrinkled, like he was trying to find the right word, and despite the aura Tony tended to give off, the action itself was rather- well- adorable. “You’re too good for that. Still got some good friends. Romanov’s loyal- terrifying, but loyal. Heard Wilson’s a great guy, too. Just stick with that. You’ll get through.”
. It broke our hearts. And Bucky- he was so desperate to keep you safe, to look after you, it was all he did, all he focused on, for
His hands ached. He was lying on something, but it sure as hell wasn’t a bed. Some sort of table, probably. When he pulled his eyes open, it hurt like a motherfucker. The light stung and his head throbbed. Felt like a concussion. Why would he have a concussion? He tried to sit up and move his hand to feel at his head, but he couldn’t. Something was pinning him down.
Unhealthy? Definitely. But it didn’t change things. Were someone to hurt a hair on Tony’s head, Steve would not stop until they were dead at his feet. He’d made that much clear the first time around.
His eyesight went a tad blurry at that, but he still managed to spot Clint, half-way to clambering up the left side of the ‘A’ and looking thoroughly pissed. “We had to bribe JARVIS to find you! We thought real baddies had taken you! And here you are, just fucking kissing eachother like gross idiots on the side of the tower! Fuck you, honestly, I’m never playing with you guys again, you’re no fun-”
Of course, intentional or not, Steve was pretty sure he'd never felt his mouth go dry more rapidly in his entire life anyway.
Tony turned back around and looked at Ty. “Okay,” he said quietly, “okay, I guess I- I know what I want.”
He was shaking like a leaf, and he wasn’t sure if it was from the ice in his heart or the complete, all-consuming grief.
?” Ah. See. He knew it. “Look at where you are right now. Look at what you did for me.” Tony lurched forward again, getting a second wind of bravery as he settled his fingers over Steve’s and wrapped around them, his smaller hands so warm and familiar and lovely against Steve’s own. He was close enough that Steve could smell the scent of his cologne. “You were just as brainwashed as the rest of your colleagues at SHIELD—the good ones, at least. They’ve been feeding you and the public lies for years now, not just about me, but about everything. And you breaking me out of there, risking your life to help me… it didn’t just save my ass, but it probably gave the modern world as we know it a fighting chance at keeping its freedom. So yes, Steve. I want this. Because you’re not just a good man, but you’re brave to the point of ridiculousness, and you’re kind, and wonderful, and—”
He turned to face the other man and clasped gently at his shoulders. Tony looked back up at him- still in his business suit, now crumpled and messed from the amount of time he’d spent in it waiting around with Steve at the SHIELD medical unit. There was a strain in his eyes.
Steve thought back to Tony and Bucky’s first meeting- and yeah, okay, maybe he should have cleared things up way back then, fuck, is that what had stopped Tony from making a move all this time? They could’ve been… for
Steve felt himself drift back off into a peaceful doze, his head buried into the warmth of Tony’s bare chest as he caught up on the hours he’d lost that morning. His mind wandered absently and without rush- ideas for new art pieces he was thinking of, a present that he could buy for Bruce that he’d seen out on the highstreet earlier, how he was going to make Mrs. Kaplinsky believe he’d really lost his history book for the third time in the semester, and all the while Tony breathed peacefully beside him, his fingers curled loosely around Steve’s waist and holding him close. He was so much more… innocent, when he was asleep. Smaller and almost vulnerable, curled into Steve’s warmth like a child, his face relaxed and open and hair messy in the way that wasn’t fashionable, just ridiculous. Steve tilted his head and watched him breathe for a moment, tracing the lines and creases of his face, both present currently and ones that only came to be when Tony was awake, like the frowny ones over his eyebrows and the part of his cheek that dimpled when he smiled.
r been able to elicit such a direct reaction out of Steve before, and they’d used to fight on a daily basis.
“Thank you,” he murmured, sounding like a broken record, but it was all he knew, it was all he could think. Tony had found this. Steve hadn’t got the faintest idea how, but he’d got this and he’d done it all for Steve.
Steve just hummed in amusement and then moved to the buckle of his pants. Tony would probably have tried a little harder to seduce his boyfriend in that moment had he not been quite so exhausted, but as it was, he was content to simply let Steve pull his pants off without anything coming from it. Quite literally. Hah.
“Whoah whoah,-” Something grabbed his waist and looped around, holding him in place, diagonally tilted across the sidewalk, “you’re really not good with your drink, are you?”
As soon as they heard the voice, he felt Tony stiffen against him. Steve watched his face drop, and then turn a little irritated as he sighed and released Steve’s hands. “Hey Ty,” he said, looking up and over Steve’s head to where a boy was stood with his arms folded, watching them curiously.
age?” He asked, wiping his hand on his jeans. He knew people were probably looking at them both, but he couldn’t find it in himself to care. He felt like a sap, but Tony was smiling, and that was really all that mattered.
. “Wanted to try helping in a different way, I guess- oh.” He felt his throat close up in surprise when Tony touched him, fingers on his face, gently tilting his head sideways. For a moment, Steve had absolutely no idea how to respond, or what was happening at all. Then he realised that obviously, Tony was starting to work on one of the cuts on his cheek, inspecting it before he began to apply anything.
It was freezing, as usual, and so Steve was decked out in his usual five layers as he made his way up to school. He got weird looks from everyone else as they shivered in their fashionable tiny jackets, but Steve knew that his immune system would thank him for his own wardrobe choices and so continued as he was. Steve had long since learned to stop caring about what anyone else thought of him, be it his fashion choices or his general looks.
Steve harrumphed and turned away a little. “Kinda,” he said bluntly, “I mean, not the mugging. Just everything that came after would have been remarkably better had you not acted like an asshole, y’know?”
Steve just huffed, letting his fingers play across Tony’s midsection. His back rested against Steve’s chest, their legs tangled together in front of them while JARVIS played something innocuous on the TV. “Shows I was right earlier though,” Steve added quietly, “you
God, what had Steve been thinking, trying to get near Tony Stark? Maybe this was just what everyone had been saying- what he was really like. Tony had said it himself- maybe Steve should have listened.
Honestly, he’d just wanted to be able to sit with pops and make sure he was okay- let him stroke his hair and quiet his worries and say how tough he was, that he wouldn’t go down that easy. But instead he’d had to be hurried away by Uncle bruce, who was rolling his eyes and apologizing on behalf of them, saying that he’d be able to talk to his pops soon, but it wasn’t a good time right now.
“What is your gut saying?” Natasha asked him, zipping up her jacket and then pulling out a hair-tie in order to get her hair out of her face. “Cause mine’s telling me that your tech doesn’t malfunction, and Steve wouldn’t just forget to check in with you.”
getting hurt, whatever it is- I dunno what's happenin' in his head. But I know he likes you a lot. Because I only see him lookin’ that happy when he’s been around you, or he’s thinkin’ of you. Which means he’s gonna want you to stay away from him, obviously.”
“What do you feel about paying for dates?” Rhodey asked before Steve could even get a word in edgeways.
Steve still didn’t understand. Tony couldn’t…. he wasn’t serious, surely. Not after everything. Not after this. How could he be? But Tony, apparently sensing his lack of comprehension, just swallowed and then held Steve’s hand even tighter, looking somewhat nervous now. “I’ve been planning it for weeks,” he said quickly, “trying to get everything perfect, trying to do it right. I know this is—it’s out of the blue, definitely not what I had in mind, but Steve… God, Steve, I love you so much. Of
Bruce pulled a face. “I honestly don’t know. And I’m sort of wary to send anyone in there, because he’s, uh-”
Tony looked down at his hands; tapping incessantly against his knees, and pointedly did not look at Steve. He wished he had just lied- said it was because he thought it was lame, or never enjoyed running around as a little kid, or just
hadn’t for four days, and that made Steve’s heart twist painfully. Tony at least deserved somewhere safe to stay. He did not even
Of course, that had sounded like a good idea when he’d been walking up to school this morning. Now put into practise, with three curious and worried faces staring intently at him, he was beginning to think he should have just stayed in the bathroom.
like he meant it- but then again, God only knew what went on in Tony’s head. Steve had known him for a while now, but he was still managing to leave Steve confused with almost every conversation.
With a fond sigh and a soft thumb which rubbed over the graphite, he looked up, and jumped upon seeing the man himself, leaning against the window and looking right at him. He was panting; hair stuck to his forehead and body glistening with sweat as he grinned over.
“Love is difficult, is it not?” He asked quietly, looking back down at Steve. There was a weary smile on his face as he let go and then started to walk forward, following after the others. “I’m gonna go after them. Need to make sure my brother's not… doing something stupid. I’ll see you 'round, guys.”
Squeaking a little in surprise, he instinctively let his hand rise, cupping around Steve’s neck and drawing him in, moving them closer, because Tony didn’t know why, he didn’t know how, but he knew that he wanted.
There was a short pause, and then JARVIS answered. “It is my duty to protect and obey my creator. He has warned me not to, and I quote, ‘freak you out before he even has a chance to get used to the crazy shit that goes on around here’, and so I am trying my best to diffuse the situation I just created. Again, apologies. My social codes are not as developed as they should be, seeing as Sir does not usually let me interact with others.”
months. “I’ll be better,” he promised with a furious nod of his head, “I will, Steve, I swear, don’t go. Please, come on, I’ll do anything, just… please. Please, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to be weak, I didn’t—I’m—”
Tony watched, not registering the greeting Bruce sent his way from the kitchen. The man was preparing dinner, probably—it was a Sunday, so they all ate together. He thought Nat and Clint were probably in the kitchen too, but he didn’t turn to check.
Natasha was waiting for him by the gates that morning, which was unusual, but not worrying. She was slightly sporadic in her actions- Steve figured she liked to keep herself unpredictable.
“Oh, and we all know just where curiosity leads, don’t we?” Peggy smiled smugly at him, “it kills the cat, Steven.”
“You know what I think we should do?” Bucky lifted his head up suddenly, hair falling messily into his eyes, “I think we should have a food break. To sustain our minds, etcetera etcetera.”
So anyway. The team are all Bonding and Growing Together and stuff, and Tony is just out on a limb, because he doesn’t know how to fucking
Tony did. He crawled like his life depended on it, unable to stop the excited giggles from his own mouth as Clint followed, hot on their tail. Steve was yelling at him to move, and Tony had never thought there would be a point in his life when he’d be annoyed by Steve’s hands on his ass, but here they were.
And it was weird to think about. Steve ached for past—he missed it like a lost leg, something undeniably
Peter couldn’t hold back his sigh of quiet relief, but he quickly schooled it into a huff of annoyance as he pulled a face against his Pops’ chest. “Okay, no need to overdo it with the sap, I think I get the point-”
Turning over on the bed, he curled his arm around Tony’s waist and tugged him in closer, feeling the other man fit himself subconsciously against Steve’s body. He smiled at the action; pressing a kiss against the soft crown of Tony’s head whilst his fingers traced delicately around the scar on Tony’s shoulderblade. Bullet wound, he knew- he’d run his fingers over it enough times to be able to identify it to Tony’s body with his eyes shut.
“First thing’s first, we need to get JARVIS out of the house,” Rhodey said firmly, a minute or so after Tony’s crying had died out a little, “we can’t leave him there. You’re not going back, but I can—”
Tony wasn’t sure which part was more fucked up- the fact that he thought Clint was wrong, or the fact that maybe, just maybe, Clint could be right.
He shut his eyes and sighed. He didn’t think he’d be able to take the Wilsons’ anger right now. He knew they had the right to be upset, but he just…
Steve shot him a look, part frown, part fond exasperation as he kissed Tony again. “We go through this every year, babe. Yes, I remembered your birthday. I’m slightly offended that you thought I
He swallowed and shut his eyes, biting down on his bottom lip and feeling the tightness in his chest. Every so often, the self-hatred came back around again, just as big and strong and domineering as before. It never got easier to look at the man you loved and know that your shield had been embedded in their chest, that just an inch further would’ve killed them for good.
It didn’t seem to faze the kid much; his fist balled up, but that was about all the reaction they got out of him. Steve shook his head fondly and leaned over, kissing Tony on the tip of the nose before turning away back into the direction of the bathroom. Tony was pretty sure he heard Steve repeat the little pet-name Tony had just said through a small breath of laughter, but he wasn’t sure, and a second later Steve’s ankle knocked the door half-shut, shielding him from view.
Steve rolled his eyes, peering into the lab that the group of scientists had just exited from. By the looks of it, it was entirely abandoned by that point, and so Steve didn’t bother much with stealth approach. “I don’t think I can just tell him to leave his billion-dollar company behind to come and speed up the job that we already have someone doing for us, Hawkeye.”
“I’m glad you came,” he stated honestly, “you’re a really good friend, Thor. And for the record, I don’t think you’re ever going to be a failure. To fail someone- to properly,
Tony wasted no time. He vaulted the table, scrambling for the closest sharp object he could find, which just so happened to be a screwdriver. “Steve, hold him down!” He yelled, jumping back over and then watching the other man roll back onto his feet and pin the LMD by its arms to the floor. The robot struggled and twitched violently as Tony got to his knees and leaned over the thing’s head.
participate had always been more than enough to satiate him every October. He’d spend hours looking through Pinterest at costume ideas, scrolling Instagram and watching everyone decorate their homes and faces with amazing art in celebration. Plus, even if he couldn’t go out or dress up, there really was nothing better than cosying up with your pet robot and a bowl of popcorn and sitting to watch scary films all night in the dark.
“Barcode, identifier, Producer, that sort of th—” Tony paused, spotting a mark a few centimetres underneath the LMD’s collar. He peered in closer to read the letters stamped onto its skin. “Ah.”
. You were just another filthy criminal he could put under his belt, maybe give him a good ride before he handed you over on a platter to us. You meant
Something made a noise. He was pretty sure it was him. The world rung out in his ears, a piercing sound. He winced. Tried to move, escape it. He couldn’t.
Steve swallowed, suddenly feeling absolutely awful. God, he’d just gone and assumed the worst of Tony automatically, not even bothering to take into account Tony’s reasons. Fuck. He’d made a mess of this.
Effortless on the field and natural as friends. I fell in love with him so easily, because he was just
He still couldn’t believe he’d really been kissed. And as first attempts went, Steve liked to think he hadn’t done too badly. Tony had seemed to enjoy it, anyway.
He made sure not to think of anything else other than the immediate. He did not think of going back home again after all of this. Of the fact that this was all so horrifically, disturbingly wrong. He didn’t think of 24 hours ago, when everything had been perfect and normal and Steve had been in love, thinking idly of the future as if it were a certainty.
It had occurred to him, in that moment, quick but entirely consuming- what Bucky had been saying earlier, and what Steve had always worried about:
“Oh, absolutely not,” and that time it was Thor answering as he dived headfirst into the fort, “if my mom caught wind of what I was doing to her furniture, she’d cut my hair off in my sleep. Luckily, she’s currently in Oslo, so…” Thor just shrugged, lying back and resting his head in his hands. “Until then, we’re good.”
“I know, I won’t keep you long. What’s your name?” They’d done this multiple times over the course of the night, so Tony was no longer confused by the inquiry. He responded sleepily to all of Steve’s questions without difficulty, and then when Steve was finished, Tony found his hand and took it, squeezing gently.
Three hours later, and Steve was still in his room when he heard another, louder knocking against his door.
Thor grit his teeth, sending Steve a despairing look and then glancing back to Clint with a shrug. Both of them knew that Steve wouldn’t change his mind on this. Not when it came to Tony. In fact, he was pretty sure everyone on the team knew that. The others would be expecting Steve to be searching for him, undoubtedly. Under other circumstances, he might have been a little embarrassed by that, but as it was, he couldn’t find it in himself to care. He just wanted to find Tony as quickly as possible.
, oh my God, I- no. Just… no.” He made a few incredulous little faces for a few seconds, and then just dropped his head into his hands. His shirt was still hanging comically off his shoulders, and the anxious part of Steve wanted to straighten it out, just for something to do.
“I wish I’d been the person you wanted me to be,” he slurred unevenly, fingers grasping at the first thing he could reach. He hoped it was something of Tony’s, although he had the slightest suspicion it may have been his own trouser-leg. “Wish I’d been worthy of you.”
His heart was pounding as he walked up the drive, and he made sure to limp a little as he went. Natasha’s kicks were brutal, and he was sure there would be a bruise the size of his hand waiting for him when he took a look at it. He supposed it helped keep the story plausible, though.
A little shoddily, sure, but Tony could let it slide considering that the boy wasn’t even out of diapers yet.
“Then I need you to keep telling everyone that I’m in the tower.” Steve walked out of the bathroom, surprised his legs were still working. It felt like his body was trying to lug around a dead brain. “I need you to tell them I’m sleeping and that I don’t want to be disturbed.”
The problem was ignorance. Tony couldn’t think of any explanation as to why there was so much pushback against Unhuman autonomy or rights. Baseliners simply weren’t taught enough about them, and they never had been. There were hundreds of thousands of years’ worth of stigma and fear, whole myths and legends and societies built off the back of their fear of Unhumans. And so the status quo wasn’t changing. But it was the 21
So he took Tony’s foot, very, very gently, and then undid his shoe. The entire time, there was a heavy silence. Tony felt close to tears again, despite the fact neither of them had said a single nasty word to one another. Maybe that was the problem.
Tony smiled, sticking his hands in his pockets and then starting to walk up the path to Sam’s house, Steve falling into step behind him. It was funny, how easy he found Tony to talk to. Although, to be fair, everything felt easy when he was with Tony and Tony was just being Tony- if that made any sense.
“Come on a date with me tonight,” Tony said, shutting Steve’s book and turning to face him, “I know a great place, really tiny- I think you’d like it. Best food ever, I swear- even better than my own.”
"What the damn hell is that supposed to mean?" Bruce blurted, before his eyes widened and he turned to everyone else. "Oh My god- you don't think he could be...
Tony looked around the room, blowing out air and shrugging. “We have to hand him over to social services,” he said, looking at Clint’s twisted face and making a helpless gesture with his hands, “we don’t have any other options. We don’t know who this kid is, who he belongs to- whether he already has a family and a birth certificate or if he needs one. This is not our area of expertise, quite clearly.”
Tony was looking at him, trying to formulate a response. Eventually, though, he sighed. “We should talk about this another time,” he mumbled dejectedly, “I shouldn’t have said it now. It was stupid of me. Just—just relax, Steve.” He leaned forward and then moved so that he was lying down next to Steve instead, his head tucked into Steve’s shoulder as he curled up his body. “I’m here. I’m safe. And I’m not leaving.”
He rolled his head and looked at Bruce. “You gotta tell Steve ‘bout my plan, kay?” He slurred, “He’ll like it. Think it’s funny.”
Richards said nothing, mouth opening and shutting like a goldfish, caught between telling him the dangerous truth or trying to lie his way out of it. But Steve knew he was a good man. And he also knew that Reed would not be stupid enough to attempt the latter.
Steve watched him for another second, then hummed. “We’re just gonna need to pull that all out again tomorrow,” he commented, “you know what Peter’s like about his toy selection.”
Bucky just smacked her hand away with a scowl. “Be nice, she’s had a tough day,” he said. “Also, I’d like to just say that whoever had the bravery to frogmarch both Thor and Natasha from any building is a person that I have the utmost respect for.”
Tony shut his eyes. “He’s not going to forget that, Steve,” he murmured quietly, “Ty—he doesn’t let things go. You just started an all-out war.”
He came every week on a Friday evening after he got off work, and he’d bring his sketchbook each and every time. Rain, snow or shine- he’d be there. And so would the ballet dancer.
want me to stay the night?” He responded with, having to drag his gaze away from Tony’s mouth in order to look at his eyes instead. Ever the gentlemen.
Bucky nodded firmly, leaning against the wall and shoving his hands into his pockets. “We need that Tin Can, after all,” he said, “who’s gonna cover my ass from above without him?”
He shrugged, looking away. “Yeah- yeah, I’m doing alright,” he answered simply. His hands fiddled with the button on his shirt, and the frayed edges bristled under his fingers. He really needed a new one.
I would want more than to come back home to you. But you can’t want this. Not after… why would you?”
needed. Last night… it’d just been a little blip, a stupid thought spiral. The team still wanted him around, obviously.
The ride down to Reed’s lab was silent, eerily so. Steve listened to his own heart as it beat like a drum in his ears. He was so exhausted from the constant bombardment of adrenaline, of the sheer weight his emotions were pressing into him, that he wondered whether his body was just going to collapse soon. Somewhere in the back of his mind, he wished it would. He wished it would shrivel and die, let him escape this nightmare and go back to a place where Tony was alive and happy and smiling at him. Where everything was back to normal and nothing hurt.
Miss Hill stared down at him, holding out a hand. "You know phones aren't allowed in class. Hand it over."
Bucky just laughed, shaking his head and patting her on the shoulder. "Seeing as I'm probably gonna be pretty unlucky with the search for a man worthy of Peggy Carter, I'll just have to cut down on my spams of Nat's feet, I guess. I could probably do that. And hey, at least there's only one of me doing it! Steve's keepin' it private, so you don't even have to worry about him."
Steve shrugged, giving Natasha a glare and shove when she became unable to hold back a snort of laughter. “Okay, listen, this has
Tony snorted, then winced as it contorted his face. His chuckles were slightly wet, but so were Steve’s, and when Rhodey joined in, his sounded damn near hysterical. Because none of this was okay. It was all so, so fucked up. But God, laughing felt good.
"A note," he responded, and Natasha's eyes encouraged him to explain further, "said: 'I can't keep him, he's one of you'. "
“Iron melts at 1500 degrees,” the man hissed in his ear, while Tony’s throat burned, “how long do you think this tin-can will last?”
Both Bucky and Peggy spasmed in shock, eyebrows shooting to their hairlines in sync with one another. Steve just sighed, letting his head drop into his hands. “Not like that,” he mumbled, “shut your face Clint.”
“He might be a little sore right now, sugarsnap. But I’ll let you draw on mine, if you really want,” Tony’s voice filtered through the haze, and oh.
No one came after him again that night. They thought it was best to give him space, no doubt. JARVIS would be giving an hourly report of his wellbeing to someone in the tower so that they knew he wasn’t hanging himself in the bathroom, but apart from that, Steve was alone.
Mr. Wilson said nothing, his eyes wide and mouth open. Steve felt his breathing coming in short again—all day, that rage had just burned inside him. He knew it wasn’t going to last. Soon it would turn to sadness, guilt. It always did. But for now, he had his rage. And he was damn well going to harness it if it would make Mr. Wilson just sit and fucking listen to him for a second.
“We didn’t make you come,” Peggy pointed out, tossing a marshmallow into the air and catching it between her teeth.
They both sat there, thinking aloud as to what was taking them both so long- until a minute or so later when they heard the door open again, and two voices filter through the house.
The world felt like it’d frozen on its axis as he looked up at his lover in complete and utter shock. It didn’t compute in his brain. Steve... Steve didn’t just hit people. He’d
Steve frowned a little as his backpack fell off his skinny shoulders in the same way it always did when he wasn’t holding it. His hands were currently full of bags of food and supplies that Sam’s mom had sent him out to get from the mall, and so it made things rather difficult to navigate. Luckily the complex was only a few minutes away from school, and that made catching the bus with a shit ton of shopping a hell of a lot easier.
Running down the corridor and coming out in the kitchen, he slowed himself down to a jog and then carefully checked his reflection on the surface of the microwave. Yeah- flushed cheeks, messy hair and a soda stain down his front. Looking good, Rogers.
“Great! Sorry, I just wanted to check, I’ll see you later, yeah?” Steve said, before turning on his heel with another casual wave, a smug grin on his face when he turned away from them both and heard Tony’s quiet incoherent noises hit his back as he wandered off.
Steve just sighed and leaned back. The truth was, neither of their hearts were in it anymore. Tony still had the searches going on in the background, every day looking for new information, but nothing had come up, not in the months and months and months since they’d started this. Steve had found new reasons to come down to Tony’s workshop, become distracted with other things, healthier things. They hardly even looked at the damn thing anymore.
Steve snorted, bumping shoulders with her and grinning as he looked out into the parking lot and caught sight of Bucky’s beat-up old car as it pulled in. Everyone sighed in relief, quickly hurrying over whilst still huddled together. Peggy managed to call dibs on the front seat, and then Steve simply sighed as squeezed his skinny ass into the back seat with his three other friends. It was lucky he was so thin- Thor alone took up half the car.
“WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?” Steve said, loud enough that the whole room turned to him that time, both Tony and Bucky jerking over to look at him.
The woman's face dropped, and she turned to face Steve, reaching out to grab him. But she never made it there. Because a moment later, the wall caved in and the world burst into red and gold.
The team slowly filtered out after a while, heading off to various jobs and rooms and meetings and whatnot, until eventually it was Tony and Steve with the communal floor to themselves. They floated over to the living room and then got comfy on the couch sat directly in front of the TV, Tony stacking himself lazily across Steve and then resting his cheek into the warmth of Steve’s sternum. The more relaxed Tony was, the more catlike he tended to become, and so Steve was hardly even surprised when, a few minutes and some gentle hair-stroking later, Tony began to do what Steve could only describe as purring. He smiled and chuckled softly, twirling his finger through a curl at the back of Tony’s neck and then listening to the way Tony hummed deep in the back of his throat, happy and content and already half asleep again. They were watching some movie on Tv- The Princess Bride, it looked like- but Steve couldn’t really say he was concentrating. Far more important things were happening right under his nose.
As for Steve… well, Steve was just going to have to play it by ear. See if he could stick around in the janitor’s office and then call Nat and ask her to buzz him out once the building had been released from lockdown, maybe.
He broke off, and Peter felt the little rumble of laughter that shook his Pop’s chest as he spoke the next words.
“J, I don’t want another word out of you for the rest of the day, do you understand?” Tony raised a finger quickly and prodded it in the computer’s general direction before the AI could even hope to respond, and the ensuing silence told Steve that the robot must have become a little bit more obedient since he’d seen it last, because it actually listened to Tony’s instruction that time.
Steve sighed, and Tony gently shifted his shoulder, pulling a hand around the back of Steve’s neck and stroking the hairs there. “Let’s go take a nap, huh?”
“Brunch… brunch is not an all day event, Steven,” Tony grabbed his wrists and pulled them off, holding them in the air. His face was almost glowing, and it took him all of one second until he caved and leaned down for another short kiss. “God, you’re going to kill me, you know that? I hope you’re aware of that fact.”
It didn’t take long for him to finish up- Tony had done most of the work himself at some point, it seemed. But it made feel Steve a little better anyway- it was the least he could do, considering Tony had yet again put everything on the line in order to do something for Steve.
Everyone rolled their eyes- something they did a lot and something Tony had never really minded until now. Everything was coming in through a different, inescapable light.
“I’m sure I used to be the one telling you that,” Tony raised an eyebrow at him as he took the device, and for a second, he was almost smiling. But then he turned his back and focused on the window, observing it analytically, and Steve could do nothing except try to quell the heat on his cheeks. The man traced a finger over the pane, pressing his face close. Steve figured he was checking for something—what exactly, he wasn’t too sure. Maybe a trip system. “This might take a few minutes,” Tony murmured to himself as he looked down at the laser cutter, “glass isn’t bulletproof, but it is reinforced. I’ll have to go around the edges.”
He couldn’t even feel annoyed at his friends. He was still riding the post-marrige high, as he had been for the past month.
He was right; Steve turned to look over his shoulder and saw how the sun was just about touching the ocean- deep red and beautiful and bathing the huge grounds of the house in a deep orange light. It occurred to him in that moment that he and Tony were sat on the roof of some building in a place Steve didn’t know, with very little preventing him from just overbalancing and rolling right off the damn roof completely- Hell, the only way to get up here in the first place had been to dangle off the second story balcony and then climb the rest of the way up. Tony was mad, making him do this. Steve was madder for following.
There was another round of agreement, and then Bucky loaded another cartridge into his gun, raising an eyebrow at everyone. “Onward and upward then, fellas?”
He walked over a frozen puddle on his way across the road and cursed in dismay. As he turned his head to stare mutinously down at the offending section of water, however, someone caught his eye. It was a familiar figure; tall and large, with flowy golden hair that was now rather bedraggled from the rain. He was stood by his car with his hood up, smoking what looked like a joint as his hands fumbled around in the inside compartment of his car door.
and then you’ll both find stupid new people and have stupid new lives and leave me behind and we won’t be a family any more and I don’t want that so just
He could still see the look on her face, even now. He didn’t think he was ever going to forget it. But he recited the words that his therapist had told him, when he’d spoken to her about on the phone that night, his voice quiet and broken as he’d huddled in the corner of the room and asked himself whether he could even recognize himself any more. “Trauma does things to people, Tony. Bad things. Your mind is physically altered by what happened, and it changes you. Does that make you a bad person? No. But it makes you a person who needs help and support to try and change. I got therapy, Tony. I talked to my friends about it.” He stepped forward, moving over to Tony’s side and winding their fingers together. “You need to talk to me, sweetheart. Don’t push me out and try to handle the situation yourself. It’ll get my back up, and we’ll end up in the situation that we were in a few hours ago, with you giving me orders that I can’t follow and me getting angry over it.”
The last thing Steve saw as he flicked his head back was one of Tony’s friends slipping an arm around his waist and pulling him close, laughing loudly. Tony let his head fall into their shoulder and said something that made them laugh harder, and then both of them veered off sideways, falling into the nearby car door and clutching one another, hysterical with amusement.
But Steve didn’t move. Just stared at him, his face twisted and angry. “Wow. Guess this is what to expect when you try to date a whore,” he said quietly, chuckling with a complete lack of amusement as he turned his back and then began to walk away. “I’m going to the gym. Just go to bed, Tony. We’ll talk in the morning.”
“Put it back,” Steve mumbled into the sheets, and a second later Tony obeyed the command, because Steve felt his hand settle back where it had been a second previously. Steve imagined he’d be smiling.
enjoy Steve looking after him. Just a little. When things were tough at work and when all the thoughts of the day were piling up in his head, unable to find release- when he was stressed and tired and the world was just a little heavier than usual- Steve was there, offering him a hand. Giving him a kiss. Showing solidarity. And it was indulgent, but it was good, and Tony liked to let himself have it a few times a month.
“Tony.” Bruce looked up at him solemnly, “Natasha’s right. It’s cut through an artery. If we don’t close this up now, it’s going to kill you in less than an hour.”
He felt himself sigh. Despite his anger, he couldn’t stand to see Buck like that. “Like you said, though,” Steve shuffled forward, getting back onto the couch and then punching Bucky (not so) lightly in the arm, “it’ll all work itself out. I hope.”
And that- his five friends were pretty much the only people he had in his contacts. After that, there were just his favourite takeouts, his therapist, and-
Tony froze, eyes widening. Steve felt like every muscle in his body coiled up at once and his mouth dropped in horror.
Steve just sighed. “I suppose I could go to the hospital,” he muttered, “if you insist. And. Uh. The date, too. We could do that sometime as well.”
“I’m not going to ask how your friend called Bucky Barnes got my number, because I feel like it will involve an intensely weak password for your phone and about a billion security risks that I’m not willing to deal with right now- but he told me I needed to look out for you today, so-” she shrugged a little and handed him a bar of chocolate. It was a bit soft, and Steve was lactose intolerant, but he smiled anyway.
He looked around their room. His and Tony’s room. Everything was dark. He hadn’t turned on the lights.
“One week,” Tony promised, finally turning on his heel and starting to walk away properly, but continuing to keep his head turned in Steve’s direction. He waved. “Love you bunches!”
Tony hissed through his teeth, “I… we lost, Steve. Fucking accept it. He won, and he beat us, and we have to fucking move on. Isn’t that what you tell everyone at your support group? Isn’t that what we all tell the world, every damned day?”
He noticed then, that Tony wasn’t actually wearing a helmet. Must only have been carrying one around with him. Steve was about to say something, but then Tony revved the engine and kicked off the brake, shrugging as he did so.
He couldn’t help but crack a smile at Steve’s analytic face, watching the man observe the situation and clearly attempt to visualise how he was going to go about removing Peter from the tub. Tony left him to work it out while he hurried out of the bathroom and made his way over to the crib they’d rigged up into the corner of the room, plucking the small outfit out of it and then balling it up into his hand. It was covered in little cartoon ducks and, admittedly, incredibly cute to see Peter wearing.
Tony looked at him bashfully, shrugging. “Was thinking about you,” he muttered, and then a second later he stifled a yawn and blinked slowly, “just… seemed like a cool idea at the time. Dunno.” He sighed. “I’m tired, Steve.”
Steve stared miserably over to the bed, where Tony’s hand waited for him enticingly. Any other time, and Steve wouldn’t have even had to think about taking it, holding on tight and sleeping with their fingers entwined on the bed. But everything was different now. Steve was scared of putting hands on him. And God, how fucked up was that? Three years into a relationship with the man he loved above all else, and Steve didn’t even trust himself to touch him.
goddamn video. Steve pulled a face and left that comment alone, but they were everywhere, plaguing his notifications. Tony’s PR manager had told him to just let it lie, and that it would fade away in a week or so, but still. It hurt, seeing them come for Tony like that, all for something he’d not even had a damn say in. It made his skin scrawl and his heart seethe with anger.
Luckily, at that moment Natasha and Thor rushed back in from the other direction; Thor meeting Steve in the middle and grabbing him in a bear-hug whilst simultaneously spinning him around so he wasn’t facing Clint. Everyone was yelling now, and Natasha had already started shoving Clint away in the direction of her room, but Tony could hear his bitter mumbling from the other side of the kitchen. “Fucking
, and it wasn’t going away, and that right now, what they were doing was unhealthy for both of them.
He heard a splash of water from the other room and then Steve’s muttered tones and turned back around, heading back to the bathroom and poking his head inside. Steve was holding Peter about a meter away from him, letting the baby drip water onto the mat as he stared intently. “Okay. Okay, alright see, this isn’t so hard,” he muttered to himself as he slowly, carefully lowered Peter onto the towel he’d placed over the floor. Peter kicked his legs out experimentally, and Tony half expected Captain America to scream, but the superhero held his nerve.
, apparently- but that was for another time. For now, there was one thing he wanted to do and one thing only. And he wasn’t scared of it, not any more. Whether or not Tony felt the same…
“JARVIS?” Tony called out, and Steve almost jumped out of his skin when Tony’s desk answered “yes, sir?”
There were yells from the door, and then Steve watched in confusion as James pushed through his friends and jumped out of the door. His face was serious as he looked over Steve’s shoulder to Tony, and when Steve turned, he saw Tony’s face go from angry to mildly confused. “
AIM hadn’t stormed SHIELD to get anything. They’d stormed SHIELD to draw the Avengers out and spread them thin, trapping whoever responded down here where there was no escape. They’d known one of them would stay behind in the tower, most likely Bruce, because he was only needed in emergencies, so they’d then arranged another strike- this time hiring the Wrecking Crew- and triggered that one off, forcing any free Avengers into action over there. Tony himself had told Thor to call for the Hulk before heading to Times Square.
Tony’s eyes widened a fraction at the proximity, but he didn’t move back. “Hey yourself,” he said quietly, and Steve grinned a little harder, noting the redness just beginning at the tips of his ears.
“What the fuck happened, man?” Clint asked, leaning forward with concerned eyes, “Sam said you had to go over to Thor’s at midnight? How bad was it?”
They walked out of the doors in companionable silence; a faint smile still on Tony’s face. Steve was probably more pleased than he should have been that he helped put that there.
Tony bit his lip and leaned forward, burying his head into the warmth of Steve’s chest. “Thank you,” he murmured, “for staying.”
Unfortunately, the combination of Steve’s confrontational personality and Zeke’s apparent tendency to make others feel like shit meant that Steve was calling out to him before he could even think about it, his face set in anger and his feet marching of their own accord.
“waiting for me to have my inevitable breakdown over this?” Tony asked sharply, wishing he could stand up, “waiting to see how long it takes for me to start crying like a fucking baby? Jesus, Natasha, I thought you rated me more highly than that—”
He sat them both down on their bed gently, flicking on the TV and turning to one of the mundane children’s channels that he now had installed into it. Peter was starting to flag as bedtime approached, but he took the bottle when Tony directed it toward him, his hands coming up to clasp clumsily around the perimeter of the bottle. Tony gently let go to see whether Peter could do it on his own, and after a few attempts at hitting his mouth, the kid effectively managed to grip and drink without much help from Tony at all. The words of Lewinsky and Clint came back to him vaguely:
“What?” Clint snorted, “no, don’t be stupid.” Tony stopped, looking at Steve and holding a hand across to him before the man began to drive like a maniac back toward the tower. “He’s just said his first words!”
“Inviting Tony was my idea, thank you, I would like to take credit for that one,” Sam raised a hand and winked over to Steve, “figured that would serve as a good enough birthday present, right Steve?”
Natasha paused, an eyebrow shooting up at Steve’s words. “You think the reason you’re so bad at this is because you can’t talk to women?”
It didn’t. If Steve squinted hard enough, it was almost like a sunset in Brooklyn; when the chemicals and smog had tinged the light unnatural colours, just like this one.
Natasha and Clint both gasped in betrayal, before narrowing their eyes over at Steve. “That was cheating,” Clint said accusingly.
And, of course, Tony forgave him. It really was just a stupid argument, after all. They’d had far worse, and Tony had been an asshole about it too. Eventually Tony agreed to doing his best at remembering to put his stuff in the dishwasher when he used it, and Steve kissed him in thanks, and then they fell asleep together. The next day, it had slipped Tony’s mind entirely.
There was a sudden tremor, and whilst all the assailants appeared to remain on their feet, all three Avengers went sprawling on the floor. Tony bit back a yell, feeling the shockwave reverberate through the corridor. It was lucky he’d had his jaw unclenched, or all his teeth would’ve been smashed in by the pressure wave.
It’d be perfect. He could invite everyone around to his place, they could dress up and have a good time, and then Steve could stay the night. He knew the other boy was free, seeing as he’d subtly asked as much a few days previously. And he still had eleven days to actually hash everything out, set the groundwork and so forth. Steve had been pretty impervious to any attempts at getting him in the Halloween spirit before this, but Tony knew he could do it. Slow and steady wins the race, after all. He’d send Steve a text now inviting him over, and later on once he’d tried a few more persuasive tactics throughout the week, Tony would reveal that it was going to be Halloween-themed. He knew where he could get some cool decorations, too. And maybe Steve really was dead-set against horror films, but there were different things they could do as substitute for it.
“You’re not moving!” Tony called out from down the corridor, and Steve jumped as he looked up in surprise, “I can’t hear your feet, Rogers!”
Sam looked vaguely surprised, but after a few moments he just shook his head and blinked a few times. “Well, are you alright now?” He asked, and Steve couldn’t help but smile- always looking out for him, was Sam.
She didn’t say anything, and for a moment he wondered whether she was thinking of a counter-argument, a plea for him to let it go. But she didn’t. Instead, she shuffled a little closer and rested the side of her head onto his shoulder. “Do you remember when the whole team got arrested in Japan that one time?” She said—and the memory was so out of place and surprising that it made Steve burst into an unexpected laugh.
“Okay,” he said slowly, eyeing them both up and then jerking his head, “you wanna come into the kitchen and sit?”
Steve heard Tony clear his throat, try and say something. But nothing came out except for a little choking sound, as Tony finally seemed to let go of that brave exterior he’d been clinging to—something he’d needed Rhodey to be there for him to do it. Rhodey kissed his cheek and squeezed his shoulder. “Let it out, buddy,” he soothed, rocking Tony gently, “just get it out, it’s okay.”
hmm. Tony notes down in some corner of his mind that Steve seems pretty sensitive to kisses on the underside of his jaw.
“I should think so, Sir. Without me, there would be very few people there to ask you to eat breakfast at an appropriate time.”
“Steve…” Tony shut his eyes and put a hand up, resting his head on it. “You can’t just… it’s not your job to defend my honor-“
It took him twenty minutes until he was finally ready to get into bed. Steve lifted him, gentle and slow, out of the wheelchair and into the bed as if he didn’t weigh a thing, and then carefully plumped his pillows and tucked the sheets over him. Tony smiled at the action, and Steve smiled back, and for a single second things were almost normal.
“Marry me,” Tony repeated, shuffling on his butt and taking in a breath, “because you’re the only person in the entire world that I feel like I can bare every single part of myself to. Marry me because we have been through hell together, and we’ve somehow managed to come out the other side together, stronger than ever. Marry me because
Great. Now he was going to have to call Natasha and admit that yes, actually he had gotten lost, they were all right and he should never be let out without supervision ever again.
The room fell into silence again, save for the clinking of ice against Tony’s glass as downed the remains and then smacked it back onto the broken coffee table. The weight of the tumbler seemed to be the final straw for the battered piece of furniture, and both of them watched as the frame caved in on itself and the glass shattered, sprinkling at their feet. Tony just watched it with a face of defeat. “I hate Loki. I just got this fucking place done up.”
