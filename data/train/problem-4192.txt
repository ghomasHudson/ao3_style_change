He and Baby drove aimlessly for an hour or two, taking in the world. Eventually, he realized where he was going, and wasn’t even that surprised. He should have known, really, that there was nowhere else this particular chapter of his story could have started.
“Imma hit the shower before I start on the steaks,” Dean says as they cross into the kitchen. Cas goes to the sink to wash the garden soil from his hands and nods in acknowledgement.
“Yeah, you’re right,” Dean agrees easily, sliding into his seat. There’s a fresh beer sitting by his plate, and Dean shoots a glance  of thanks in Cas’ direction. “Too much for the little dude to live up to. Might give him a complex.” Sam rolls his eyes and Eileen grins, and Cas’ gaze across the table is infinitely fond.
“Not yet, Sammy,” Dean heard himself say hoarsely. “I’ll tell you about it, I will. But not yet, ok?” Sam looked like he was going to argue the point, and panic forced more words past the howling thing at the base of Dean’s throat. “Please. I’m not . . . I’m not ready.” He could feel tears pressing behind his eyes and ruthlessly choked them back. Sam looked like he knew exactly what Dean had just confessed to, but he also didn’t look very surprised. Mostly just fragile, and sad.
. “You couldn’t have known Jack would come for me, that I’d choose to stay, that heaven would be changed enough for us to . . .” Cas finally raised his eyes to meet Dean’s own, and the cautious hope in them felt like a benediction. “You couldn’t have known.”
And there was the table with their names carved into it, the way Dean remembered it at the very end, five sets of letters pressed into the wood like a promise. He let his fingers trip over one of them, tracing the rough outline, and suddenly couldn’t understand why he was still standing here when what he truly wanted, that last, final thing he got to choose, was so close he could nearly smell it, like ozone and green growing things.
“Yeah, Dean,” Sam agreed softly, squeezing his shoulder tighter. “I do want to know, someday. But . . . when you’re ready.” Dean cleared his throat, looked away from Sam’s too-shrewd gaze, and stepped away to give himself a little space to breathe.
Some time passed. They started spending less time in the library mulling over weird news articles, and when Dean made phone calls, it was usually just to check in with Jody on how the girls were doing or to let Bobby grunt monosyllables at him down the line. One evening, and Dean wasn’t even sure which one, Sam shut his laptop on the email account they used to field their Google alerts for “exsanguinated” and “unexplained death,” and as far as he knew, never opened it again.
“Look, my brother is a huge nerd and a pain in the ass, but he’s the best man I know. You could make him happy, and he deserves it. But he could make you happy too. I think he wants to, if you’ll let him.”
“Wait,” Dean croaked out past the choking, beating thing at the base of his throat. “If you’re still handing out miracles . . .” Jack just looked at him blandly, expectantly. Dean dug down into that newly split-open place in himself and dragged out a single world. “Cas.”
“Did he forget to feed you breakfast before he went on his run, or are you trying to con a con man?” Dean asks the dog skeptically as he pours coffee into his cup.
The blissful, uncomplicated blankness (relief, Dean realized later, the word for that golden, weightless sensation was relief, so huge and profound it had blotted out everything else like an eclipse) began to ebb back like a tide the second they swung open the door of the bunker. They had saved the world, and that was good, but they had saved the world because there were people in it, people they loved, and that was so much worse and so much better. They shared a look that was half-guilt, half-hope, and they both went scrambling to their rooms to collect the phones they had shoved in nightstand drawers days ago, letting the charges run dry. An empty world had been hard enough to bear without staring at blank screens, hoping against all reason that they would ring.
He went to the kitchen, because of course that was where he would be. He couldn’t have been anywhere else.
“Waiting for what?” It was barely more than breath. Cas was still staring down at their entwined hands, not meeting his eyes. Dean let his thumb skim over Cas’s knuckles and felt him shiver.
“Excuse you,” Dean splutters. “First of all, HIPPA and all that shit. Second of all, what happened to barbaric human medicine?”
Dean’s first stop is the kitchen to snag a beer from the fridge. Even though he’s back earlier than he’d told Cas he would be, he finds mushrooms already sliced on a plate by the stove, and enough veggies laid out on the counter to keep Sam from spewing his moral superiority about Dean’s awesome cooking all over the place and ruining everyone’s appetite. Cas himself is nowhere to be found, but the doors to the back yard stand open to let in the air, and Miracle is napping in a patch of sun on the deck. He raises his head when Dean walks over and looks vaguely hopeful, like he will have forgotten about this morning’s attempt at swindling Second Breakfast out of him, but Dean just leans down to buss his knuckles against the side of Miracle’s face, unwilling to be swayed.
Sam’s smile bloomed into a grin as Dean glanced over at him, and then softened again, looking speculative and cautiously hopeful.
They stand there in companionable silence a while longer while Cas polishes off the last of the beer. Eventually, Dean pushes away from the railing to head to the house, and Cas follows him without comment, the empty beer bottle dangling from his fingers.
The screen door swung open on squeaky hinges, and a figure moved out into the light of the setting sun. She looked just the way Dean remembered her: sloe-eyed and smiling at Sam. Always, smiling at Sam.
“Don’t forget,” Cas says absently as Dean turns back to face him, “Sam and Eileen will be late tonight. She has parent-teacher conferences this afternoon.”
A lot of water had passed under the bridge since then, though, and Dean at 31 was a different man than Dean on the far side of 40. If that were the only problem, the only thing standing between him and the picture Sam is painting, Dean’s pretty sure they’d be having a very different conversation right now.
“We aren’t letting people tell us what to do anymore,” Dean replied eventually. “That was sort of the point of the whole savin’ the world thing. And as far as crazy people go . . . that’s a blind-leading-the-blind situation if I ever heard one.” The look she shot him was full of mirth and only a little uncertainty. Dean thought about everything he’d done for Sam, how he’d fought and bled and died to keep him whole and sane and here, and for what? For this, Dean realized. For exactly this, and if there was one more thing he could do for the kid, it was to try to make sure he got it.
“Look around you, Dean,” Sam says, mirth in every line of his face. “We’re having Friday night dinner, like we do every week. We have 9-5’s and pay taxes and my wife is in there, petting your dog and talking about bees with your . . . with Cas.” Dean bristles at the pause, the brief correction, but Sam continues before he can do anything about it. “If this isn’t normal, what do you call it?”
“The fucking cicadas,” Dean grumbles by way of explanation. The coffee tastes like water on his tongue; all his senses are occupied with the way sweat pools in the hollow between Cas’ collar bones.
“She wasn’t supposed to be here, Dean,” he said in a rush, like a dam bursting. “She wasn’t supposed to be anywhere, not like Bobby or Charlie. She was supposed to be dead. I was so afraid that Jack had put everyone back where they were supposed to be.” Dean got up from his chair and moved around to his brother to put a bracing hand on his shoulder.
“Then what the hell are you still doing in my car, man?” Dean asked, giving Sam’s shoulder a shove. “I want to hear everything, all of it, all the stuff you did and the people you knew and the things you loved. How The Mandalorian ended, how many versions of the iPhone they made, what stupid shit you taught your kid because I wasn’t around to tell him how wrong you were. But we got nothing but time for that, now. Go get your girl.”
“Nothing,” Cas replies grimly as he lifts the bottle back to his lips. “But the director called CPS anyway. I guess we’ll see.”
“And about the rest of it.” This part felt harder, more painful, but it was the kind of pain he knew from when he poured alcohol over a knife wound, or Sam slammed his shoulder back into its socket. Something cleansing, a pain that meant the pain was almost over. “What you said. People who . . . people who care about me. They don’t make it. Caring about me is a one way ticket to being collateral damage, but me caring about other people . . . that’s when the shit really hits the fan. Because I don’t get to keep what I want. Sam’s the only thing, the only person, I’ve ever been able to keep, and we almost let the rest of the existence go up in smoke to keep each other. I need him with me, need him to be whole and healthy. But I want you with me, Cas. I think it might be the first thing I’ve ever really wanted in my whole life.”
Cas’ mouth under his was exquisitely human, and his breath against Dean’s face felt like it was washing him clean, revealing something new beneath. Cas was still for a moment, and then surged forward, clenching a fist into Dean’s collar, holding him close. He tasted a little like whiskey, and a lot like a late evening in summer, like the moment the heat broke and the grass lit up with fireflies. Dean felt like that, now: like he was standing in an ocean of light, with his feet still on solid ground.
He walked up to the rickety table he’d been sitting on right before the first time Cas had stared at him with that unblinking gaze he could feel like a physical touch on his skin. Carefully, he put one hand down on it, felt the dust and grit beneath his fingertips. Eventually, he looked up at the burnt out light fixtures, never replaced in the decade and change it had been since Cas’ fledgling understanding of his vessel had busted them up.
“I love you,” Cas breathed back. Dean closed his eyes against the intensity of the blinding-hot feeling in his chest, and felt his tingling mouth stretch into a grin.
“How’s the library?” Dean asks before he can get too squirrelly about his brother’s opinion of the life lying scattered across the lawn. A few forged degrees and Sam’s incredibly nerdy and embarrassing enthusiasm for archiving had landed him a job at the Lebanon branch of the Kansas Public Library last August, and he seems impossibly, improbably happy there, puttering around amongst the paperbacks, showing 10-year-olds how to use search engines for good and not for evil.
Dean had no idea what to say. He stared down into his glass of whiskey, thought about taking a drink, and found he didn’t want to. He’d never felt less like dulling his senses or forgetting.
“If you feed that dog the steaks you insisted we had to drive two towns over to buy, your arteries will be the least of your worries, Dean Winchester,” Cas threatens evenly. Dean goes out the open doors to the back deck with as much dignity as he can muster, with Sam and Eileen’s laughter following him out on the breeze.
“Yes,” Cas’s voice rumbled over his bones like the Impala over the highways of the world. “Dean . . . The choice I made. It was a human life I was choosing, not an angelic one, and I made that choice before I heard what you said. I chose it knowing it was finite, and that the thing I truly want . . . that it might not be mine, to ask for. You . . . you don’t have to. I’m staying, in whatever capacity you’ll have me. I chose it. There are no strings.”
Eileen’s smile was brittle and beautiful and unafraid. Dean thought Sam had lucked out with her in a lot of ways, but that thread of bravery that ran like iron through her bones might be his favorite thing about her. Dean wrapped an arm around her thin shoulders and pressed a kiss to the top of her hair. He let her go far enough that she could see his lips again, but didn’t move his arm away.
Cas’ inner arm brushes Dean’s shoulder as he reaches around him and snags Dean’s beer from the deck railing where he’d set it down. Dean turns to see him take a long swallow from the bottle, and notices the lines of tension around his mouth, the weary shadows under his eyes. There was a time when Cas never looked anything but grim and unhappy, but it’s been a long while since that was the case.
“What’s all that about?” Dean asks as he moves a steak onto the plate in front of Cas and is completely ignored for his trouble.
“Like Imma be eating your rabbit food when there’s red meat to be had,” Dean replies as he pulls the plate of steaks and a beer out of the fridge.
Dean got out of the car and leaned against it for a while, staring up at the straggling grass that sloped above the door of the bunker. He could hear animals skittering in the woods and the distant cry of a hawk, and for a while he sat listening to them, letting the sounds of this place soak into his skin. The door in front of him looked like a choice, one final chance to decide what came next. He pushed it open.
Dean was sad. He was sad he wanted Cas, sad he was alone, sad Cas was hurting but more than that, Dean was angry. Angry at himself, angry at Cas’s father, angry with this stupid case. He just wanted to get drunk and sleep for a few hundred years.
After eating their ice cream, Gabe and Annie went home. There, Gabe helped her with her few worksheets of homework, hung out for a little while, and cooked some pasta for dinner. It was a little past nine-thirty before Cas got home, far too late for little girls to still be awake if you ask him. However, Annie was still waiting for her dad to come home.
Everyone claps, turning to face Gabriel in the middle of the crowd and Gabriel grins and nods politely.
It’s considered pretty rare for males to be Omegas, therefore Dean is considered the black sheep of his family; well, with the exception of his brother Sam who doesn’t treat Dean any differently.
Sam sees genuine fear in his brother’s eyes. “Look, with our life, we never know how much longer we’ll survive. Hunter’s usually don’t get happy endings, Dean. Don’t you think it’s something worth trying for? C’mon man, if the roles were reversed, what advice would you be giving me?”
Dean can’t help but smile wide as his heart flutters at the feeling of Castiel’s hand in his again. “I’d like that.”
He and Sam start gathering their clothes and grab the small photo album of them with their mother from when they were little. They each have their duffle bag stuffed full when they head to the door.
Dean tries to recover, breathing heavily. He struggles to look up to see the new being in front of him.
“Well, you DID cause some harm. You were a handsy, disrespectful asshole so now, you need to APOLOGIZE.” Jo tells him. Accentuating the last word as she pulls even harder on the handful of his hair. His eyes blink shut and tears begin to fill his eyes. He fights to keep his face unchanged though he’s visibly wincing from the pain of Jo’s hold.
Blushing, Cas shyly takes a small bite of Dean’s burger. As soon as he tastes it, his eyes close. “Mmmm.” he chews slowly before finally swallowing it. “Oh my god.” he says, shaking his head.
Same name except middle initial is included, it’s M. It’s a Mastercard, card number is 0048-3582-1920-3217. Expiration date is 06/24.”
“Alright, well guess we’re gonna wash the dishes then head out.” Dean announces, standing from the table.
“I thought humans didn’t belong in the Empty,” Dean challenges, stepping out from behind Cas, glowering.
‘See, he’s just fishing for a bigger tip.’ Castiel tells himself after noticing the smile has faded from Dean’s face. ‘Just drink your damn drink then get some food to go and get the hell out of here.’
Death. My, you boys sure have been busy since I died. Well, let’s get on with it, then. Do you want to start with your brother, or the Angel?”
Dean gets on his knees, urging Cas forward, and the water pours down his back. He smiles up at Cas, then runs his tongue along the underside of his shaft before wrapping his lips around just the head and sucking.
“Forget about the money and what happened before, alright? Would you like to accompany me to dinner?”
Dean fully expects to be rejected. After all, they don’t know each other. He can’t blame the man if he never wants to see him again.
Dean puts his arm around Sam’s shoulders and pulls him in. “Oh, come on. We can stop by the library if you want, once we bring the groceries back.” Dean tells him.
“I..I don’t really drink.” she answers, her voice so soft he barely hears it over the noise of the other patrons.
“Well, me and Anna had a date, but she bailed on me. Apparently, last night Jimmy and Amelia saw her kissing some other guy at the movies.” Gabe says, scoffing.
“Cool. Well, welcome to our group.” Jo announces. “So we’re heading over to the diner soon. You coming with?” she asks.
Dean pulls out his zippo, leans forward and lights the man’s cigarette before pocketing the lighter. “Looking for some company?” he asks, ignoring the man’s question. He rubs his forefinger against his bottom lip then takes the tip into his mouth and makes a light sucking motion.
“As you know, the school year is almost over. I know you’re all ready for summer. But I hope you take your final exam seriously. Your final exam for this class will be counting for 25% of your final grade.”
“See, you just walked in the door and you’re already making a mess!” John says, pulling Dean up by his arm.
Dean moans, then pulls away to pull Cas’ shirt off over his head. “Lately? Anytime you’re around, yeah.”
Looking over for any indication of help for an answer, Dean sees Cas is already writing in his notebook and seemingly focused on it- though he kinda doubts he is actually THAT into it yet. “Uh, not much.”
Sam couldn’t answer, just stayed in Dean’s arms, face buried against his brother’s chest as he continued to weep helplessly.
Castiel grins and nods. “I guess I’ll get out of your hair. I think I need some time to think about things and then we can talk later to try to work things out. Is that okay?”
Dean shifts in his seat glancing at Cas before looking back to Sam and Eileen. “I uh, figured it’s time to tell you guys about us. We’re kind of..well, we’ve BEEN kinda seeing each other for a little while.” he manages.
She quickly wipes her eyes before Sam pulls her back against his lips. They lay back again and Sam holds Eileen’s hair back as she leans over him. He kisses down her neck and across her collar bone.
“I’m getting kind of hungry, and I haven’t gone grocery shopping yet. Could you recommend a local place to grab some lunch, Sam?” He asks.
A man who looks roughly the same age as the lady who was seated at the table previously walks over to the table where the man who accompanied her is still seated talking on the phone. They can’t hear what is being said, but the seated man gets off the phone and stands with a huff. He walks with the other man toward the front.
“Thank you.” Castiel signs. He looks back to Eileen, opening his canvas bag. He sets a rather hefty book down onto the coffee table in front of her. “These are samples from every shoot I’ve ever done.”
“Yeah, we’re not looking for favors or anything,” Dean tells him, shuffling closer to him and offering a fond smile.
The archangel looks at her curiously, causing the witch to roll her eyes and sigh at his clear ignorance in the art of flirting. She forces a smile and places her hand gently over one of his. “I have a few ideas in mind. Especially considering the fact that very soon, we’re all about to be marching toward what could possibly be the demise of the entire universe.” Her hand slips down under the table, resting on his upper thigh. Fingers trailing down his jean clad leg. Looking down, Michael sees and feels something previously unfamiliar to him.
Dean started inviting him to go with him to hang out with his friends, but Sam didn’t want to just ‘tag along’ with Dean’s friends, only to be known as Dean’s little brother. No, he knew if he was going to make friends, they should be his own this time, and that Dean deserved to have friends of his own too.
Cas’ heart shatters. He isn’t sure why it hurts so much to hear the truth. Of course Dean doesn’t feel the same as he does. He’d known that, but Dean’s actions had given him the hope he never dared to entertain before that moment. “So, that’s it? It was just a death wish, like always?!”
Cas combs his fingers through Dean’s hair, his other hand rubbing soothing circles against his back. “Sweetheart, you’re making me feel horrible. Please talk to me.”
“You think you can just take whatever you want, regardless if the other person wants it? Is that what kind of ‘man’ you are?” Jo asks, stepping forward last but stepping even closer to the man than the other two.
“I get what you’re saying, but Jack’s right. And I mean, who else can we really trust to take on that role? Besides the fact that the six of us are all that’s left,” Sam points out.
Cas looks over at Dean. “I got a text from Sam letting me know about Reily being born. Why do I feel like you might have had something to do with that?”
“Yes, sir.” Sam says. It's still an old habit from when he and Dean we're younger and still with John.
Rowena and Michael still remain sitting next to each other in silence. Every so often, she sneaks a glance over at him. Finally, he catches her eye when she looks over. “So...whatever shall we do to pass the time?” Rowena asks, looking up at Michael with a wicked grin and raises an eyebrow. Seduction lines her features making her smile coy.
Castiel wakes up hearing faint water running. For a second he doesn’t recognize his surroundings. Sitting up, he looks around and realizes he must have fallen asleep on Dean’s couch.
“C’mon boys, let’s get inside and get some sleep.” Bobby says, unlocking the door and letting Sam and Dean inside before he steps in behind them. He locks the door and they all go to bed.
Sam makes his best effort to not smile knowingly at his brother. ‘Holy shit, he’s actually going to make a move! FINALLY!’ he celebrates in his mind.
Dean presses a soft kiss to Cas’ lips, momentarily forgetting his surroundings. Looking back up, Eileen and Sam both have impossibly wide grins.
Pulling back slightly, Dean takes Cas’ hand and places it over his own. He wraps his palm around both their hard dicks, skin to skin and begins jacking them together.
Sam weeps openly in the dark, grieving the childhood that his brother- the man who raised him while being a child himself, never had. Even with the monsters and hunting, Dean deserved to have all the things that Sam had taken for granted. He curses himself for never realizing that Dean had provided him with things he himself had never had.
Finally after about a month after the move, Sam started seeing a new therapist. He’d already been back on his meds, but it had taken a little bit for them to fully take effect. He was still nervous about getting to know a new person so intimately, but he was starting to feel better.
love him. Too bad you just couldn’t get yourself to say it back. All those years you had together, all those moments you shared you could have
The teasing stops and the fingers pull out. Dean kisses him and pours some lube straight on him this time, before rubbing the head of his covered dick against Cas’ tight rim. He presses ever so slowly against the hot snug opening. “Oh god.”
“Oh, they did at first. Took a while for them to get around to talking and getting to know each other. Once they did, they got really close. Neither of them ever had a sibling before so now I guess they both have a sister.”
Castiel is walking around at the party for his brother’s firm. They’re celebrating another big win and Gabriel had basically begged him to come. He pulled the ‘You’re the only family I’ve got’ card, which undoubtedly always works to give Castiel a guilt trip that keeps him from saying no.
Lining himself up with Dean’s worked open hole, he presses in and gasps at the tight heat gripping him.
“Yeah, but I’m sure you’ll do great and Sam will be fine. She’ll be great and have the best parents I know.”
Cas smiles. “I already care about you a great deal. Does that bother or upset you?” he asks, pressing a tender kiss against Dean’s neck.
“I’ve been undoing some things and making them right. Kevin Tran is in Heaven now, Bobby is out of Heaven’s jail and Eileen no longer has the mark of Hell on her soul. I’m also...let’s say ‘renovating’ Heaven,” he says, complete with finger quotes that Dean may never admit is adorably Cas-like.
Dean takes in the rare sight of Cas’ bare muscular forearms. He gulps, then hurries to look away again. “All Walter said was that he was sent to bring us back and in return we all agree to leave the ‘natural order’ alone. Also, if we break the agreement, he’ll return us to the Empty.”
Dean is amazed at the way the water touches the skyline and seems to go on forever. The constant back and forth of the waves crashing onto the sand, frothy white before it’s dragged back out. The only sounds around them are the seagulls and the water moving. Each breath of Ocean air fills him with peace as it permeates his lungs. He feels free out here- safe, even. As if the pressures and worries of life have been left behind for a while.
“Not to mention, the youngest in the country to ever claim such a position.” Dean adds proudly, suddenly standing near the other two men.
‘Oh god, that’s probably...I should go.’ Castiel tells himself, feeling foolish for letting himself indulge in the fantasy.
“I, uh...walked back home and my parents asked what happened. I started crying and told them everything.” he looks up at Dean with an unreadable expression and laughs humorlessly. “Do you know what they said to me?”
“But..you’re going out alone and coming home in the middle of the night every friday and saturday. You won’t tell me how but you’re making money and dressed…”
Dean turns several pages, random places in the book. A little girl’s 7th birthday party, A christmas card photo shoot, An anniversary party. “Well, he’s got my vote.” he signs to Eileeen and Sam.
“Well, she’s just the best, sweetest little girl ever. She makes it easy.” Dean says, brushing off the compliment.
The next morning, Dean wakes with the sun and forces himself up. He quickly slips into a loose pair of jeans, white t-shirt and long sleeve, olive green Henley. Cas and Jack sit in the library with Rowena and Michael.
Castiel feels his knot at the edge of Dean’s hole. It starts to enter but pops back out twice. Not letting up the punishing fuck, the Alpha thrusts even faster and his knot fully slips inside. ‘CLAIM!’ his body screams at him. It’s physically painful to fight the urge, but he isn’t about to break his promise, claiming someone who doesn’t want it.
“Almost ready,” Sam announces as he enters the room. He’s carrying a duffle bag with all that’s needed to complete the spell.
Chapter Warnings: alcohol mention, PTSD symptoms mention, hangover details, brief possible kidnapping mention, medicine mention, mental illness.
After a few minutes, Castiel comes back out to the living room holding the folder of pictures from the shoot. The scent of Firewood floods Dean’s nostrils. ‘Dear god, he smells even better than I remember.’ Suddenly he feels a decent amount of slick release, along with a deep moan. ‘Oh god’ Dean’s eyes go wide as slight panic sets in and his heart starts to race. He can already feel his body temperature rising.
Pulling back, Dean looks up at Cas. “Do you want me to keep going, or would you rather fuck me?” he asks, bluntly.
Dean doesn’t know what to say. He takes a sip of his beer, eyes shifting as he shuffles through his thoughts. “Cas, I don’t...I don’t wanna keep you from finding your happiness. I’m...I’m not ready to be mated. I know I should be, I’m just...I can’t.”
“That’s right, kid.” Dean moves to Jack’s side opposite Cas and puts his arm around Jack’s other shoulder. He has to push aside the swelling in his chest as his arm presses against Cas’.
“I’ll talk to Sammy.” Dean says. He tries to think of what to say, as he climbs the stairs towards Sam’s room. By the time he gets there, he still doesn’t have a clue. He knocks softly.
“I don’t hate you, Sam. Everything’s gonna be alright. You’re home now. We’re gonna wipe your face, get you a drink of water and then you’re gonna go lay down. We’ll talk about this after you get some rest, okay?”
“Not at all. Want me to move, and give you some space...and privacy? I mean you can write right here, promise I won’t look or try to read it or anything.”
“Hey, beautiful.” Dean signs back, kissing her on the cheek. She leads him into the living room and they sit across from each other. Dean sits on the couch and she sits in a chair, propping her feet on the ottoman sitting directly in front of her.
Sam nods to Cas in agreement. Michael walks back over to Rowena, taking her hand again. Jack stands beside Sam, and Cas stands beside Dean.
Sam sighs with relief, looking back to Chuck. “Then I think it’s the ending where you’re just like us. And like all the other humans you forgot about.”
“Wow, goddamn you are SUCH a smartass.” he says, smiling and shaking his head. “I meant, I have some clothes you can put on so you don’t have to wear your dirty clothes again.”
“That’s very generous of you, Castiel. And like I said, we really appreciate it. No worries about the bedroom, we don’t mess with other people’s stuff.”
Rowena looks over at him and hooks her arm with his. “So...you finally told him,” she says matter of fact.
A little while later, Jo shows up and promptly sits beside Charlie. “Heya gorgeous.” Charlie greets her with a flirty grin. Jo blushes hard and hides her face before turning to Dean.
“I’m sorry. I -can go if you want.” Castiel says, standing up and looking at the floor. Afraid he pushed Dean into the intense makeout session.
“I would consider it an honor to fight beside the Winchesters. The witch and the nephilim too,” Michael says, with a genuine charming smile.
“Funny you should say that, because when you still hadn’t came home around the usual time, I drove out to the creek to see if maybe you’d changed your mind and decided to go meet Dean’s new friends. He was there, with a couple other kids he introduced me to. There was no alcohol. And you weren’t there, Sam. So you wanna try again with where you were?”
The first thing he notices is a new text message notification. Assuming it’s from one or the other of his friends, he clicks on it and it’s an unsaved but local number. He unintentionally holds his breath when he reads what it says.
‘Does he look disappointed?’ Dean thinks briefly, then shrugs the thought away. ‘Wishful thinking.’ “Well, maybe I’ll see you around sometime.” he offers.
Cas places his hand on Dean’s shoulder and kisses the corner of his mouth. “Just, let him be. You know he’ll talk about when he’s ready.”
Dean gulps as he’s noticing now in the light of the kitchen across Castiel’s face that he’s drop dead gorgeous. Dark, soft looking messy hair, pink lips, high cheekbones and the bluest eyes he’s ever seen. Dean notices that Castiel seems to be looking back at him with equal interest before Meg clears her throat.
Dean sighs. He’d been waiting for Cas to bring it back up, but hoped they could wait a little longer to continue the conversation. “No, Cas. I meant what I said in there. I made my decision. I
Sam is in the motel shower, washing his hair as he hears Jack’s voice faintly from the other side of the bathroom door.
Meg sighs and rolls her eyes. “Yeah, yeah. Looks like we’re the only two who still have to get permission.”
Michael sighs, mulling over his thoughts before speaking, “Nothing I used to believe in is true. Besides, if nothing really matters, why not enjoy the pleasures and joys available to us?”
Dean chuckles, trying to think of how to explain. “You know how you just felt? The..buildup and then...it was like full on pleasure?”
Only a few seconds later, the man’s bitter taste is filling Dean’s mouth and he holds it all on his tongue until the man’s dick stops twitching. He lets the softening cock slip from between his lips, then leans his head back opening his mouth wide showing the man his cum. Dean makes the “money” motion with his hand and the man pulls out the full $300, holding it out to Dean. Eyeing the 3 $100 bills in the stranger's hand, he quickly sees it’s the right amount and swallows the load down. Opening his mouth again, he shows the man his now empty mouth. The man moans and Dean takes the money from the man’s hand as he gets up off his knees. “Pleasure doing business with you, darlin’.” Dean says before the man tucks himself back inside his pants and walks away.
“Derick, can you tell us what happened in your own words?” Kevin said you were attacked on your way home from school.”
Chapter Warnings: implied past possible non-consentual underage activities, verbalizing negative self-talk, low self-esteem.
“Okay, well you guys text me and let me know. I’ll come over and see you guys again before I head back home.” Dean says. “Unless you need some like family alone time together.” he adds.
Dean figures if he can’t get Castiel off his mind, it’s nobody’s business but his own. He just can’t seem to shake the way their hands felt so right together. The simple act of soft, warm skin to skin contact making his heart beat faster when their hands were joined together. Or the way the setting sun reflected on the water and cast a beautiful glow against Castiel’s pale face. Not to mention all the times Castiel blushed and smiled throughout their night together- every time, making Dean melt.
human being I will ever know. You know, ever since we met, and ever since I pulled you out of Hell...knowing you has
Castiel doesn’t stay in the water long, but Dean decides to take it as a compliment that he got in at all since apparently he hadn’t done it before.
“I’m staying in town for the weekend.” Dean adds. “But you guys take care, and let me know if you need anything. See you tomorrow?
It takes Dean several seconds to realize Sam had given them fake names for them both. He clears his throat. “Uh, yeah we were walking home from school and someone jerked me back and that’s all I remember.”
“If this is you guys’ engagement party, then why does Mary want to have one next weekend at her house?” Anna asks, joining the conversation for the first time tonight. She looks first at Dean then to her brother. Neither of them answer.
?!” The Empty asks, grinning with its eyes closed and shoulders raised in delight.  Unquestionable thrill displayed on its face.
Cas sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose before looking up at his sister. He leans over to her and quietly tells her, “We can talk about it later.”
“No, I’m sure he’ll be fine with it. I mean, if you don’t want to, there’s no pressure or anything. I can take you straight home, if you want.”
Castiel took out his wallet and handed the girl two $20 bills. He felt Dean’s eyes watching him as he stood awaiting his change. He didn’t dare make eye contact. ‘What is it with this guy?’ he thinks. ‘His boyfriend sure doesn’t like me, so why is he over here now? Didn’t he say he’s leaving anyway?’ His thoughts raced as he refused to meet Dean’s gaze.
Sam has the extraction device in hand. “Alright Michael, are you ready for us to take some of your grace?”
Dean sits down beside him, closing his eyes and letting out a deep sigh. They both set their spoils down on the ground in front of them. “Finally we get to rest a little,” He puts his hands behind his head, and lets his hands rest against the wood as he relaxes. Cas reaches down, grabbing his beef jerky and begins to munch. Peeking out with one eye, Dean looks at Cas. Watching him scarf down the meaty snack, it still seems odd to see him eat. Wordlessly, he hands Cas the pack of peanut butter crackers he snagged for him. Cas takes it, but doesn’t speak.
“So, does this friend of your live in walkin’ distance of here, or do we need to hail a taxi?” Dean asks.
Sam cuts him off. “You’re right it IS obvious! To everybody except Cas! He’s an angel, Dean. If you haven’t noticed he can be kind of oblivious.
“Oh, um.. There’s a mexican restaurant down the road that’s open for another hour. Uh, there’s a burger place open til 2, and..I-think that’s it.”
Several hours later, after looking at his phone for the millionth time, Sam decides to listen to Dean’s voicemail while Eileen takes a shower.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Dean replies. He grins as they pull out of the hospital parking lot.
An hour drags on with nobody stopping to talk to Dean before he finally sees someone eyeing him again.
“So, I see you took my advice.” Dean says with a cocky grin, nodding toward the Hammond’s furniture truck.
By now, the Omega is panting, and bucking his hips wildly. “Alpha..” he whines and whimpers at his animalistic need.
Dean’s chin quivers and the dam breaks. “Good. Because you belong with me. We’re better together, always have been.” his voice breaks. “I’m yours, Cas.” He kisses him softly. “I love you, baby. My Angel, my love, my Cas. MY home. My forever.”
Dean sighs, looking at Castiel as if he’s contemplating his answer. “I plead the fifth.” He replies, taking another bite of his salad.
“No, I don’t think I do. Why don’t you spell it out for me.” Dean growls. He drops the skillet into the sink with a clang, and steps back.
“So.” Castiel says, sitting up and leaning his elbows on the table. “What about you? Any hobbies?” He asks as he finishes his last few bites.
“It’s fine, Sam.” Dean whispers back, not taking his eyes off Charlie. “So, what’dya think? Wanna come with us?”
“Ah, new in town, huh? So what brings you to Elk Hills?” Dean asks, resting his elbows on the counter.
“Time to go back to sleep now, Angel.” fake-Meg waves it’s hand and Cas drops to the not-floor, seemingly lifeless, flat on his back.
Jack looks thoughtfully around him and then levels a look to his adoptive fathers, “No, Dean. I’m not. Well, in a way I’m already there.”
“Mornin’ Sammy. Mornin’ Charlie.” he says rubbing his face as he heads into the kitchen. The fridge door shuts and Meg is pouring milk into her coffee grinning up at him. He’s a little surprised to see she’s wearing a long shirt and what has to be either really short shorts or skimpy underwear beneath it. He quickly darts his eyes away to keep from seeming rude.
Looking over, Dean’s eyes are still wide, his jaw still tightly clenched as he glares at the man standing beside his car. Doing his best not to look directly into those damn dreamy eyes, he fails. Quickly he already feels some of the heat draining from his anger.
Being outside and focusing on the game did actually help somewhat take his mind off things, but then they heard Bobby call for them. Sam had already forgotten that Bobby had told them he wanted to have a ‘family meeting’ once he closed the garage for the day. He was afraid they were all going to sit and talk about Sam’s bed-wetting and he didn’t think he could bear that. However, he followed Dean inside.
Jack considers Michael’s words for a moment. “And what do you think of him now? After seeing everything Chuck’s done?” he asks, stepping toward Michael.
‘Wait! The bathroom!’ it occurs to Dean. ‘I’ll just excuse myself, maybe say I’m not feeling well and as long as I’m quiet it’ll be fine.’ he tells himself confidently. He stands up and Castiel’s eyes automatically rest on him and pauses the movie.
They finally come to Castiel’s house and Dean parks. “Thanks for coming with me. I’m glad we got a chance to talk.” Dean tells him.
Laying tangled together, Dean’s head is against Cas’ chest. Cas’ fingers carding through the Omega’s hair and absentmindedly tracing the muscles along his shoulders.
“Oh okay, cool. So we’ll be going to the same school then. It’ll be nice to already have a friend there.”
“Wrong answer.” Jo says, moving swiftly she ducks the punch he throws at her and gets him in a headlock. “Tell her you’re sorry, shitbag.” Jo says, struggling to hold him.
“Hey, when you gotta go, you gotta go.” Looking around he spots what must be the bathroom key hanging on a simple nail. “Aha!” He smiles triumphantly, grabbing it and holding it up to show Cas before heading to the bathroom.
Once Dean’s breathing started to slow, Cas got up to run to the bathroom where he quickly threw the condom away and cleaned himself before pulling on a pair of sweatpants. After, he brought the towel to Dean and helped to clean him up before handing him his boxers.
Gabe could hear the sirens in the distance when he answered, “I know, kiddo but we have an ambulance coming, okay?”
Cas turned towards him, his blue eyes looking completely floored, “I—I’m sorry… what did you just say?”
As soon as the door was closed, Cas’s shaking voice broke the tense silence, “Dean… I’m sorry for being so terrible for you. You didn’t deserve any of that and god—I’m just so scared…”
They finished their drinks and ordered a round of beers, not wanting to get too intoxicated. They started to talk about little things; favorite bands, T.V shows, pet peeves, memories.
Once the water was warm enough, Cas started to use a cup and rinse water through her hair and start lathering the shampoo into her hair, “So you like Mr. Winchester?”
“Okay, baby. Be safe and have a good trip.” Cas was restocking the back of the ambulance as he hung up with Dean. It was the end of August and school was starting in two weeks. Dean and Charlie, who was a middle school teacher in Lawrence, were driving to an educator’s conference in Wichita.
Unfortunately, they didn’t even get a chance to move before the front door opened. Ellen and Dean walked into the house; their laughter quickly died after taking in the scene before them.
And just like the night before, Dean and Cas got comfortable in Dean’s bed but tonight, they laid facing each other when Dean said, “You know, this job has taken a lot out of me. I’m a grumpy asshole, I drink more than I should, I have more nightmares than I’d like to admit, and I take out my frustration on other people.”
As they pulled themselves out of bed and started to get dressed; Cas in his clothes from the night before and Dean in a Henley, jeans, and boots. Cas tried to sound casual when he asked, “You know, Annie and I usually get breakfast every Saturday… if you wanted to join us?” Cas was praying that Dean would say yes.
Dean spoke quietly, knowing she would have a pounding headache, “Sammy and I are heading to school now. Do you need anything?”
They sat together in silence, both deep in thought until Dean whispered, “She needs help… I should call Ellen and Bobby.” He pulled out his cellphone and rang the Harvelle-Singer’s house, “Ellen? It’s Dean. I’m sorry it’s so late—I’m okay. It’s mom…” He proceeded to quickly tell Ellen the events of that night. She said she would make some calls in the morning and that he would try and get some sleep.
Once they were back on their feet, Cas still clung to Dean’s hand but was starting to let go of his fear. When he finally started to move his feet and no rely on Dean for momentum, Dean gave him encouragement and a quick kiss, “See? You got this!”
Pulling himself out of his sleepiness, Dean realized that Cas was still freaked out about the sight of seeing Dean being pulled out of a car. Dean lovingly took Cas’s hand and kissed it, “I’m right here, I’m okay. I’m not going anywhere.”
Cas kissed his stubble-covered cheek, “Time for work.” After hearing his groan, Cas patted Dean’s butt, “Sorry, babe.”
Cas seemed like he was searching through his mind for any idea of what Dean was talking about, “No, I think I do.” Cas’s eyes seemed to get teary as he reached out for Dean, “Please stay.”
Cas grit his teeth. Who the fuck did that guy think he was? He could have hit them. He could have seriously hurt Dean. Without giving it a second thought, Cas revved his engine and pulled up next to the red Jeep and slammed his fist into their side view mirror; breaking it and bending it to an unnatural angle.
He saw Cas and another guy in a black hoodie wrestling on the platform with a transit cop trying to pull them apart. Dean quickly put his gun away and shoved the assailant off of Cas before helping up his bloody intern. Dean held onto his shoulders and looked him over, “Are you okay? What the hell happened?”
Charlie could barely hold her tongue long enough but as soon as they were in Charlie’s car she turned to him and tried to control her shaking voice, “Dean got shot in the leg. He’s okay but he’s at the hospital.”
After the rock incident, they decided to leave the beach and go get some dinner. Before dinner, they stopped at their rental house to shower and change.
Dean was awake in two seconds, “Where are you?” He started to pull on jeans and his usual jacket. When Cas didn’t answer Dean’s panic increased, “Cas? You still with me?”
And again, he was ignored, “These parents are going to kill me if I don’t get these grades online and—”
The three girls sat on the hood of Charlie’s car and watched as Cas tugged his helmet on and started to drive out of the parking lot. That’s when Alastair pulled in and purposely steered towards Cas, trying to hit him with his pickup truck. Cas dodged him, loudly revved his engine before flipped him off and driving away from the high school.
“I’m a mechanic.” Even though Dean answered right away, his thoughts were stuck on the way Cas constantly played with Abby’s leash, how his cheekbones and jawline beautifully outlined his face.
Half-way through rinsing out the shampoo, Cas quickly sprayed Dean with the hose, giggling like a dork.
After that, nothing, not hell nor high water could stop Cas from getting to Dean. With Alfie pulling the stretcher behind him, Cas ran up to the passenger door. Now that the door was off and Cas could see Dean he nudged the firemen out of the way, hurriedly putting a hand on Dean’s shoulder, “Baby? Hey, it’s me. I got you.”
“I don’t know, I just don’t feel great but I still want to go out.” Cas kissed Dean’s hand back before Sam walked over and put their food on the table.
Gabe, Mike, Luke, and Alfie were by Cas’s side in a second. Gabe shook his little brother’s shoulder, “Cas? Cas?!”
On a day when neither Dean or Cas had work, Dean drove them out to a quiet field. Anna and Sam were at Ellen’s studying for their English midterm so the boyfriends could take their time together. Even in the dead of winter, Dean and Cas found their ways to keep warm in the back seat of the Impala.
After a minute of silence, Dean couldn’t hold back his tears anymore, “Cas, I um… look, there’s this guy. He’s really sweet and I like him. He’s the first guy I’ve been really interested in since you. I loved you so much and I was going to marry you but… you’re gone. I know you wouldn’t want me to be miserable forever so I need you to forgive me.”
Dean took another drink as a silent rebellion, “RELAX, OLD MAN. YOU’RE GOING TO GIVE YOURSELF A HEART ATTACK!”
“She said nobody wanted to be friends with a new kid.” Annie’s fallen face lit up as she looked towards one of the far-away pathways, “Daddy, look! It’s Mr. Winchester!” Annie jumped up from the swing and took off running across the park.
He grabbed a round object the size of an apple, took it to his mouth; teeth ripping at a little strand dangling from it in a loop.
Dean froze for an instant. He felt… he that he couldn’t reciprocate the gesture. He didn´t deserve that, they were gonna die, because of him, there was no calm on this, no peace; and accepting that would be… accepting, and peaceful and… he couldn´t, he wouldn’t…
Things that people had only heard of in legends, beasts that had sometimes appeared cause of a flick of destiny, or a mage doing a stupid deal... suddenly swarmed the forests and villages. Ghosts, vampires, werewolves, wendigos… everything. Everywhere.
“You”, he said in a dangerous tone, “healed all of us, not just before healing your vessel. Also before healing
He was also very aware that he did not want to find out what she would do to Dean, or him, if she found out about the hunter.
“Dean Michael Winchester”, she said sternly but smiling, putting her hands on her hips, “What mischief have you planned this time?”
“Well, I did train him after all”, Dean countered, a small smirk never leaving him, still looking around and not looking at Cas.
The army got so many casualties that their forces got to a fifth of what they used to, and they couldn’t get to every monster. So in different places, people started to take arms. Warriors that hadn’t enlisted into the rebel army started killing monsters in their own way.
“You did good, son. Proud of ya”, said as he squished his shoulder a bit before letting his hand down.
Sam gulped, breathing frantic, face tear-streaked; frozen in place in horror as he hugged Jessica, trying to shelter her. Castiel got to them and pushed them towards the stairs, making them move; as the flames roared angrily, growing stronger by the second.
“No if you wanna keep your promise of being already searching at first light, it´s not”, Dean growled as he crawled back to his side of the bed to sit on the edge, “In my opinion, we are in fact
“I am aware”, he started, measuring his words, “that some nobles have forgotten our true mission. We are servants to the people, and that´s the only reason why we have access to more resources. Some have been taken by greed and pride, and… I know many consider peasants unimportant. Like… objects. Like annoying pets they need to keep an eye on so the Crown doesn´t take their funds away. Sometimes it´s not their fault. It´s what they have been taught. They don´t know better”
The next day, he realized something was wrong, and that maybe he should have started searching sooner instead of being a jackass.
Castiel still didn’t move for some moments. He closed his eyes while the last remnants of his dream completely faded away, and he started to realize the headache– the non-pulsing,
!! Dozens of screams rose in the house, as beneath him the man took a loud gasp of air and started coughing desperately.
He turned his eyes to him. Sam brother had his shoulders tensed, jaw clenched, probably lotta emotions boiling inside. Wondering.
Just before leaving after his brothers, Cas glimpsed again at the portrait with ten members. He felt it was mocking them, reminding them of the three siblings that weren´t with them any longer.
However, Castiel was used enough to the sight of his brother´s throat to simply roll his eyes instead of feeling uncomfortable for it, and he chose to once again let it past.
Dean unfolded his arms upon hearing him, frowning; worry tensing on his chest. He thought of all Sam had said, about what Cas must be going through. He saw the angel stand up to leave the kitchen, and he quickly moved forward.
As he soared, he was dimly aware of clashing sound, a bellow, a screech, and somehow saw vines diving down and around blue-brown shell; and he momentarily dared to believe he had made it.
“Also”, he added, voice resonating in the cold stone, “Some intruders have arrived through some kind of transportation method. A portal, a sigil, a magical object. Find it, and destroy it. They must be stopped at all costs. Hellhounds, focus on the angel. Get me those wings. Demons, go get the humans”
He didn´t like how that shoulder was bleeding, or the look of that burn. But Dean figured that as soon as Cas caught his breath, he would heal himself just like always. So he pressed his lips and decided not to worry too much.
. After three or four minutes Cas started to get winded, but he magically asked his lungs to provide more oxygen for him. After ten minutes, his legs started complaining, and he muted their demands by numbing the pain. Now, he had no idea how long they had run- but he was honestly starting to wonder if he would get Corrupted by using magic simply to keep up the damned pace.
They both stared at each other for some moments, as they usually did. Then Dean chuckled, looking down.
The angel was laying on his back, a profusely bleeding wound where his shoulder met his neck, but his free hand was clutching his hand, as if the rest of the wounds of his body were minor in comparison. He started to get up panting, and Dean clutched him from his clothes and helped him up.
Apparently, someone was not behaving in good faith, being it the doctors or the nobles in charge of funding them. Castiel found this hard- and hurtful, how could they do that?- to believe, but he did not dare tell Dean how things
the foul air. He made a small grunt as he quickly took the pliers to the first fang he saw, wanting to finish quickly. The sound the tooth did as he wretched it from the mandible was disgusting, wet, and ripping; but he was a doctor, he told himself. It didn’t matter that all he had practiced on were humans. This was just another body. Another disgusting, long-dead, decaying… body. He gulped, but persevered.
A few seconds later, the pair of earrings shone on her ears, their green radiance lighting her eyes.
“Cas, everything you always bring is fucking fantastic”, he answered quickly, “I’m sure it will be fine”
“But we gotta take a leap of faith and work with what we got”, he said, turning towards Cas, and he extended a hand, “Map”
Dean nodded his thanks with a roll of his eyes, as if imagining putting all of his stuff in a bag full of half decomposed bodily fluids; and started putting his things inside.
He went back to the burner and, satisfied with the color, turned the flame off and let it cool for a bit as he gathered an empty bowl. As soon as he thought no one could get burned with it, he poured the elixir into the bowl and went back to the fallen hunter.
THIS ENDING. This is the ending of a chapter that I like the MOST out of all that I have written for this fanfic yet xDDDD The second best is when a wolf bit Cas, he screams, and several guttural growls roar in answer. Poor guy xD
Hope you enjoyed that! I love some hurt!Cas. Can you deduce what the Corruption is all about already?
A long time ago, his father had made it clear what a miracle and gift it was that most of his sons had each mastered different branches of magic. That allowed them to always have an expert to come to in a time of need, and they had always been encouraged to count on each other.
He winced at the pain he had felt when Lucifer had killed him, how he just… didn’t want to keep on living anymore. How bad he had been feeling the past days, even knowing there was a possibility that Cas could come back.
He needed to be nursed back to health, but without more magic, it would take some time. Cas was sure he´d be able to avoid his family for the next day, at least. After all, he was returning from the Academy- he came with work to do, so they wouldn´t be surprised if he got too engrossed with his studies and didn’t leave the room. They couldn’t find out.
. That Dean needed the time to think. That he needed to have some control over this- a bit, at least, for the first fucking time. Even if it was just about the
“Come on, man. It sometimes worked! You helped us stop the Apocalypse, for one. You stopped Heaven´s War. Yes, you freed the leviathans while you were at it, but we all took them out after that. You saved me and Sam so many times. A lot of humans, too. And you finally got the angels back to Heaven. That´s gotta count, right?”
“Mm… Nope”, Dean answered distractedly, his eyes more on the room than on Cas- he looked at the nightstand for a second, with his dagger and the glass of water.
He grimaced a bit. He hated feeling small. It was Jack, and he trusted him… but knowing that he knew how he felt and think, just made him feel uneasy. But that would be God for you, right?
Castiel closed his eyes for a second, tension leaving him in a sigh as he smiled slightly to himself in absolute relief, in liberation; and when he opened them up again they teared up as that smile widened from ear to ear, lighting up his face, lighting up the world, and lighting up Dean´s heart into fireworks.
Castiel looked up at him, saw his approving gaze and small smile, and nodded, tension leaving him a bit.
The hardness of his voice didn’t seem to be aimed at him. Cas thought he could see anxiety on his features, guilt maybe.
He guessed he was gonna discover if Castiel’s spells worked better against venom than potions real soon.
He turned to his work and took a deep breath and let it out in a huff. Unable to concentrate on what he was reading, he turned to writing, starting to enumerate the symptoms of the diseases he was comparing. He had done it a million times before, but he didn’t care.
The Road So Far: Castiel, a mage that was returning from the Academy, finds a wounded hunter in the Doomed Forest of Wyvernon. He brings him home to heal him.
Cas knew that could not mean Dean was covered already, he had not had the time. He judged it safer to wait.
Dean roamed around with his nose wrinkled until he crouched. He had found his bag, and he opened it and started rummaging inside.
“Ah…”, Cas lowered his eyes, blushing slightly, “There is… a bigger model, yes, the angel swords or… Grigori swords, they are called. But, ah… They…”
The word made him think of Sam, and the weight that had hung from his heart since the moment he’d realized with a that his brother should have come back already tugged relentlessly down. He put both his hands on the sink and let his head hung down.
different sexual orientations exist, but… it´s something that´s not supposed to be… acknowledged. Or talked about. They get in the way of… duty”
Castiel felt a warm sensation bloom on his chest as an eager small smile spread on his face before he looked down. After that trying day, that made him feel so much better, like a reward for trying so hard. He reveled on the sensation for a second, happy and relieved.
“I´ve always… loved you my way, Cas. Like a brother, and that, for me it´s like… top shelve. There´s nothing above it, family. You´re family, and…”
“I already told you what I get from this, Dean. Experience. Practice. I´m sure there´s so much that I can learn from a hunter like you”, he said, and he smiled a bit to himself as he continued, “And I admit, I would hate not to ever find out what happened to Sam. To wonder forever if I could have made a difference. Or if you died in the forest and I never knew”
Cas’ expression wasn’t exactly sorrow, but there was something beautifully melancholy about it, regardless. He’d never looked exactly like that before. Dean tried to memorize it, so he could tuck the image of it away beneath his ribs, where it would be safe.
“Rough day?” Dean asks gruffly as he shuts the lid of the grill with one hand and plucks his beer from Cas’ fingers with the other. Cas briefly makes a bitchy, annoyed face about the beer, but Dean counts that as a win because pissy is much better than sad. The expression fades quickly though, and Cas scrubs a hand over his eyes and looks like exactly what he is: a weary man showing his years, old around the eyes and tired.
In the end, it was the easiest thing in the world, to press forward, to slot his mouth against Cas’  like it belonged there. It was so, so easy to choose, now that he knew  what it meant, to not have a choice.
He stepped inside, and it smelled like dust and rot and ancient motor oil, nothing at all like ozone, or snowy mornings, or green growing things. He didn’t know why it made him sad, but it did. The sigils on the wall had faded with age, but he could still see them. They made it feel like home.
“Jalepenos and cream cheese,” Dean agreed through a grin. “Raincheck on the burgers, Sammy, but that’s not how it works here, anymore. No more memories, no more heavens that ain’t got all the people in ‘em that make heaven worth having. Jack stopped by on his way out of town and fixed things up, the way they should have been.” Dean didn’t  say who helped him. Cas’ name had felt like jagged metal in his mouth, in his head, back on Earth, and he’d gotten out of the habit of saying it if he could help it. It didn’t feel that way anymore, but he still held it back. Not exactly a secret, but the beat of anticipation before telling one.
“Maybe not precisely that. But close enough to stay here.” Cas shrugged, looking unconcerned. “My wings for a soul. It was a fair trade, freely made.”
. But the universe has never been able to keep us apart before. We broke every rule it ever put in front of us, to stay together. So it wasn’t about what I knew, or what we deserved - it was about the truth. And the truth is that, this . . .  it was the only real thing, the only thing that Chuck didn’t make himself. Maybe it was always too big for the life we were living, maybe it never could have been ours to keep, there, but if Chuck couldn’t break it, neither could the Empty. Neither could anyone, not even me. No matter how many times I fucked it up, it never broke.” Dean felt a little like he was breaking, now, like the glaciers he’d once seen on one of Sam’s stupid David Attenborough documentaries, a rime of ice inside him cracking and returning to the ocean. Cas’ hand on his pressed down, like he was holding him there. Holding him together. Dean cleared his throat.
Dean wanders over to the grill to lay the charcoal so he can let it heat up while he showers off the day, and as he clears the corner of the house, he spots Cas out in the yard, bent over a bed of runner beans that have been giving him some trouble despite his fanatical commitment to making sure they thrive. Dean would raise a hand in greeting if Cas were paying the slightest bit of attention, but he is so clearly devoted to his task that Dean doesn’t bother. While he goes through the motions of lighting the grill, he occasionally watches Cas out of the corner of his eye where he is murmuring to plants that have no idea he once led armies in Heaven and held a hundred million souls in his fragile, human chest and laid siege to hell itself to save a single, tarnished man.  Sometimes Dean feels small in the face of Cas’ unwavering devotion to the things he cares about, whether it’s the world or Jack or the garden he’s carefully coaxing into being along the treeline in the backyard. Dean mentally adds building some raised beds next spring to the Endless List.
“Okay, Baby,” Dean said quietly, running a hand over the steering wheel as Jimmy Page’s first few notes tumbled out of the speakers. The gear shift under his fingers felt like an extension of his arm; Sam’s breathing from the passenger seat was steady, familiar, the metronome of all of Dean’s many lives. “Take us home.”
, Dean.” And Cas isn’t smiling, but his eyes are. Miracle sits at his feet and gives a yip that sounds like agreement.
“Long day,” Cas corrects. “The oldest Connelly boy turned up at the center again this afternoon. Last month, he had two broken fingers. Today, half his face was beaten bloody.” Dean’s brain supplies a mental picture of the Connellys, who live outside the town proper on the other side of Lebanon: the mother (a slip of a woman with colorless hair and scared eyes), 3 or 4 kids with dirty faces, and Hank, an angry drunk with fists the size of hams who sneers at Dean and Cas when they walk past him in the supermarket.
For a long, long minute, Dean kept his eyes forward, staring at the faded sigils on the walls. He felt like he was standing on a precipice, about to look down the see he was standing on nothing at all.
“I was coming for you, Cas.” He felt like it needed to be said. “I chose you, too. And I was going to fight for it.”
“There were a few things I needed to do, before I go for good,” Jack explained, smiling at them beatifically. “I had some changes to make, in Heaven, a few other places I needed to visit. I’m sorry it took so long for me to get back. Time . . . works differently, now.”
“To choose what?” Dean finally found the strength to turn his head, and there he was, windswept and weary, and Dean was too overwhelmed to even weep.
“Well, we’re just glad to see you, kid,” Dean assured him. “You almost missed us, though. We gotta get you a beeper or somethin,’ in case we’re out on a hunt when you get the urge to come by and do your laundry or whatever.”
Dean returns to the house with the four steaks he cooked to absolute perfection, and finds Sam setting out plates and cutlery while Cas and Eileen sign so quickly to each other that their hands are a blur between them. Sam watches Dean’s face like he’s expecting Dean to yell at him, maybe, or avoid him entirely, but Dean just looks back at him placidly. He nods his head in the direction of the silent conversation happening at the table.
“Now c’mon, it’s Friday night and I’ve got chili on the stove. You don’t want to miss out on my cooking. I’m like, awesome at it.”
And Dean does know, is the thing. He knows how it looks, to Cas’ friends from the youth center and the guys at the garage, to the woman at the post-office who asks after Dean’s “young man” when he goes in to clear out their PO box, to strangers at the garden center who see Cas walking the aisles like a man on a pilgrimage while Dean pushes a cart along behind him in long-suffering silence. But Sam . . . Sam knows better, and him bringing it up like this feels uncharacteristically cruel considering how much of his life Sam has spent trying to be the kindness the world has never shown them.
“We’re civilians now, and even if we weren’t, we’ve never been the kind of assholes who go around knocking human heads together unprovoked, just because we think they deserve it.” Cas tilts his head in acknowledgement, waiting to see what Dean will say next. “But keep an eye on the kid. If the staties don’t do their jobs, Hank Connelly’s always lurking around one dive or another on Saturday nights. We’ll go into town, get a drink, raise a little hell. Been a while since I started a bar fight, but I ain’t above doing it again if it means puttin’ the fear of God into a guy who’d break his kid’s fingers.” He smiles a little at Cas, just to see his mouth tip up at the corners in return. “Hank’s big and mean, but he’s got that glass-jaw look about him. Bullies always do.”
“Driver picks the music,” he reminded Dean amiably, settling back against the seat with his elbow out the window.
Eventually, Dean’s brain caught up to the rest of what Cas had said, and he looked back up into his face, searching it.
“They don’t feel so much like strings, when you choose them,” Dean murmured. He discovered that his hands had tangled into the rough, dark strands of Cas’ hair without his permission, but he decided to lean into it. He pulled back and pressed their foreheads together, consciously, on purpose. Because he wanted to.
“That was too close.” Sam’s hands were sure and steady as he wrapped bandages around Dean’s chest, but his voice wavered. “Maybe it’s too soon for us to be out here again. Maybe we need more time.”
“Tell me this is a bad idea,” she said softly, almost pleading. “Tell me I can’t pack up my whole life and move into a secret lair with the three guys who saved the world, because that is something a crazy person would do.”
Eventually, Dean patted his brother on the back, glanced up into Sammy’s familiar face, and headed back to the car. Sam followed him as he’d always followed him, without words and utterly in sync, like the tide to the moon. When Baby’s engine turned over and began to purr beneath them, Dean felt a smile tug at his lips. He smiled so much, here.
“I do,” Cas forced out, looking down at the table instead of at Dean. “I do understand.” When Dean followed his gaze, he saw that, without any conscious decision on his part, his hand had moved across the expanse of the table to cover Cas’. Cas had gone inhumanly still, like he was afraid Dean would spook if he had reason to realize what he’d done. Carefully, deliberately, he maneuvered their hands until they were tangled inextricably together, and he felt Cas’ fingers curl around his own, gripping tight.
Sam turned to look at him, and Dean felt like he did the first time he’d managed to put dinner on the table on his own, cooking over a hot plate and standing on a step stool so he could see over the shitty linoleum countertop in a motor court dive, putting a bowl of Chef Boyardee down in front of his little brother: Loved. Needed. Ten feet tall. Sam practically lunged across the bench seat now, wrapping his enormous arms around Dean’s body like a vine, hugging like he did when he was three years old and Dean had been the one to make sure he didn’t go hungry.
“What happened to parent-teacher conferences?” he asks once he’s in Eileen’s line of sight. She grins up at him, and the slim band on her left ring finger glints in the afternoon light as she raises her hands to answer.
Words had never been Dean’s strong suit; that had always been Sam’s thing, the reason they made such a good team. Dean was about doing, not saying, but even with all that, before, he wasn’t sure he would have found the courage to do what he did next.
Dean thought about the way Jack had closed his eyes and brought a whole world back to life, like it had never been gone at all.
Eventually, Dean pulled back just enough for their lips to part, and couldn’t go any further even if he’d wanted to (he didn’t), because Cas’ hand was knotted in his jacket like a lifeline.
The barn, when it finally came into view through the windshield, looked, if possible, even more dilapidated than it had the last time he’d seen it, 12 years and a few lifetimes ago. The fact that it was still standing at all seemed to be more a product of wishful thinking than structural integrity. He pulled the Impala to stop and simply stared at it for a while, before summoning the courage to get out of the car and start walking toward it.
“I didn’t forget,” Dean promises, even though he had forgotten entirely. He quietly recalibrates what time he needs to put the steaks on the grill, when he should start worrying if Cas hasn’t left a basket of mushrooms on the counter for him to saute. “Should be home by 4:30, the garage is never busy on Friday afternoons.”
When he pulls off the county road and onto his own property, Dean feels a sensation in his chest like taking a deep breath after being underwater too long. When he’d first bought the house, it had looked like a strong wind would tumble it into the ground, and it still has a sort of shabbiness to it that Dean’s not sure he’ll ever be able to eradicate and isn’t sure he’d want to if he could. As he rolls Baby to stop on the gravel drive, though, he isn’t really seeing the loose shingles near the edge of the roof or the half-finished siding he’s been replacing in his spare time. Instead, his eyes find the workbench where Cas’ growing collection of plant pots and seed trays and vaguely-ominous garden implements is heaped, the front porch he and Sam had restored this spring and the wicker chairs he’d gotten in trade for a tuneup of their neighbor’s tractor, the cheerful, bright-pink mailbox Eileen had given them as a housewarming present with a wicked smile on her face while Cas thanked her sincerely and Dean bit his tongue and glared daggers at her. It looks like so much more than a house that Dean is briefly too overwhelmed to get out of the car, but he pushes the moment away and heads inside.
“And so modest, too,” Eileen commented wryly, and allowed herself to be steered into the bunker, Dean’s arm around her like an anchor.
“What are you doing here, man?” Dean asked, walking forward and pulling him into a hug, because he might be not-quite-God now, but he was still Dean’s kid. His shoulders felt thin and fragile under his hands. “Thought you’d put this town in your rearview mirror.”
Between one second and the next, he was gone, and Dean and Sam stood in their empty library, staring at each other, too shocked to even move.
“It’s fine, Dean.” Cas scowls like Dean might actually drop it, like that “wrath of God” shit didn’t stop working on him about 10 years back.
“That whole thing about living a good life, and suffering and slogging, so you can catch a break in the afterlife - that’s bullshit, Cas. That was Chuck, yanking people’s strings, making them dance. That’s not what this is. I knew, deep down, that when Jack left that he was taking any chance I had to get you back with him, and I told myself it was ok. We didn’t save that world for us. We saved it for
“You know what we deserve right now, Sammy? A fucking drink. Be right back.” He escaped to the kitchen, and by the time he returned with two beers, he felt less like he was coming apart at the seams.
He watched Sam’s long legs lope over the grass and take the steps two at a time, watched him sweep Eileen into his arms and press his face into her hair. Then Dean smiled to himself, turned the radio up, and guided the Impala back onto the pavement.
He feels rather than hears Cas come up behind him, apparently having finished his conversation with the recalcitrant runner beans. Cas has been human long enough now to have picked up a lot of new habits - he snores, he leaves empty cups of tea in strange places, he mutters to himself under his breath when he’s reading in the evenings and drives Dean fucking insane - but he still moves as silently as a thing with wings, hollow-boned and never needing to touch the ground. Dean sometimes imagines him floating through the halls of the house when he isn’t looking, drifting like a leaf on the wind.
“Hey, buddy.” Miracle pants at him happily and nudges his head against Dean’s hand, then pads along behind him as Dean makes his way back to his room. Dean dresses quickly, stepping into his coveralls and running a thumb over the name patch above his heart as he zips them up. He glances at the mirror above his dresser before he heads downstairs, studying the  way his hair is long enough now to flop over his forehead like it belongs to someone else, and wonders how long it will be until he stops expecting to see a soldier staring back at him.  With a sigh he would deny if anyone else but Miracle had been around to hear it, Dean goes in search of coffee.
“Mushrooms and salad?” Dean suggests. Cas smiles at him, and Dean flees upstairs, like he can outrun the feeling that blooms in his chest like a flower in the sun.
“A few inches to the left and you’d be in the ground, Dean,” Sam snapped back between gritted teeth. “If you die on me on a fucking vamp hunt, I’ll let you go ghost-side just so I can gank you myself.”
“Cas and I are doing all right, Sammy,” Dean says finally. “We got a good thing goin’ here. Leave it, ok?”
“Hey, Cas.” Dean’s voice sounded so normal to his own ears that he was almost shocked. Cas smiled at him, slow, and it felt like hearing his favorite song come on the jukebox unexpectedly in some dive bar in Bumfuck, Nowhere; joy, unexpected and brighter for it, bloomed in his chest. “I heard Jack busted you out.”
Dean sat with that for a few minutes. He really had hoped to see Jack’s face again, to tell him how proud he was, how beautiful the world he’d saved had been, but he supposed Jack didn’t need him to. One of the perks of the job, he guessed. It would have been nice, though, for Dean, to say the words. It had been a while since he prayed, and Jack said they never had to again, but still. Might be nice. Maybe he’d give it a try.
“Wasn’t in cards,” Dean said easily. It felt like a statement that would have hurt, in the time before, like words wrapped in barbed wire that tore and clung on their way out, but now it just felt like the truth. “I knew what I choosing, Sam, when we decided to keep hunting. Blaze of glory. Things worked out the way they were supposed to. But missing people . . . that part’s over.”
“The ‘bad guys,’” Jack explained, like a friggin’ alien, the quotation marks clear in his voice. “It was an oversight, to leave them on Earth when I left. Chuck’s power . . . it was overwhelming at first. I wasn’t thinking as clearly as I can now.”
More time passed, or didn’t, and Dean let Baby carry him over rolling hills bathed gold in the sun, trusting her to know the way. When he got where he had always been going, he felt no surprise, only a sense of cool relief. The first breath after being underwater too long.
Dean stood up on limbs that didn’t feel like his own, took a few tentative steps toward the door where Cas stood silhouetted by the afternoon sun.
“I do not do laundry,” Jack said dubiously, looking confused, and Sam laughed behind Dean’s shoulder, and Dean felt a bright surge of contentment in his bones, having most of his family in the same room again.
A few weeks after the world almost ended, there was a vamp hunt, and Dean took about a foot of rebar to the chest.
“Yeah, me too,” Dean managed to choke out, wondering why the words came out of his throat sounding like they were formed of broken glass. “But he didn’t get dusted, Sam, he went out on his own terms. Jack said he was gonna be hands off, just put things back the way they were before Chuck went all Thanos on the world. Guess it might have been too much to hope for, to get him back, too.”
“I told you, man. Billie was breathing down our necks. Cas summoned the Empty to stop her, and it snatched him up too.” Sam’s brows furrowed, his eyes narrowing.
“Melittology will be the next salvation of this planet, Sam,” Cas says sternly, his hands finally slowing as he and Eileen turn their attention to the food on the table. “You should know
“Think they’ll take the kids?” Dean asks. His mind tries to land on a memory of being curled up in bed at Sonny’s, lonely and scared and terribly, horribly relieved, and then skitters away. Cas hums an indeterminate noise.
“He did you proud, Cas,” Dean said gently, afraid suddenly to shatter the moment, which felt abruptly fragile. “He made things right, when it seemed like there wasn’t a right way for things to go, anymore.”
“Yes,” Cas agreed. He looked around at the scuffed walls, the ancient fridge, the industrial fixtures that had been half a decade out of date before they’d ever laid eyes on them. “And then I found myself here, in this place. And I knew, then, that I’d made the right choice. That I’d found my way home.”
“I would have chosen you, then,” Dean whispered into the space between them. “I’m choosing you now.”
“And you were right, too, about me. I’m not what they thought I was, Cas, not any of them. I had a chance to kill Chuck, to pay him back for everyone he hurt and everything he did. He was powerless at my feet. He asked me to. And I didn’t. I didn’t, because I knew you thought I was better than that.” Dean felt the tears he’d been fighting off since the lakeshore flood back, and decided to let them, just this once. “You changed me too, you know. Before . . . before, I wouldn’t have hesitated. I would have been every bad thing they ever thought I was.”
“My understanding is that local sentiment leans to keeping families together unless they find objective evidence of abuse. I imagine it will depend on if they can get the children to talk.”
“Everyone’s a critic,” Dean sighs, He tosses the towel over the edge of the sink and ignores Cas’ frown, knows Cas will carefully return it to its hook as soon as Dean isn’t looking because Cas has gotten weirdly anal about the strangest things since he went native. “What are you up to today?”
It wasn’t always easy. There were days, in the decades after, when Cas’ obtuseness annoyed the fuck out of him, when Dean forgot to go to the store, when Cas left mostly-drained cups of tea all over the house, when Dean was an asshole for no reason whatsoever and they ended up screaming at each other before Dean took Baby out for a drive to cool off.
“Yeah,” Sam replied, blinking slowly. His voice sounded strange, shivery and hollow and yet somehow bright, like a bell waiting to be struck. “It’s Eileen. She’s . . . Jack brought her back. She wants . . . She’s driving now, should be here by the morning.” He smiled, like the sun coming up. “Dean, she wants to stay.”
“No vacation days in this line of work, Sammy,” Dean reminded him wearily. “The things that go bump in the night ain’t gonna wait for us to get back on our feet.”
“No,” Cas responds after a beat. “Your capacity for compassion is the least surprising thing about you.” Dean lets himself look back at him for a while, taking in the way the furrow between his brow has begun to ease.
“Jerk,” Sam murmured beside him, and even though his eyes were on the road, Dean knew he was smiling.
“So yeah, Cas. I believed. I believed you would be here. If I had gone somewhere else, you would have been there, too. You were always going to be wherever I ended up, because if you weren’t, I hadn’t gotten there yet. There was never going to be an ending for me that didn’t have you in it.” Cas studied him for a long minute.
“You can try,” Dean argues like a muscle memory, but his mind is somewhere else entirely. He is suddenly back in a shithole motel in 2009, the first time he’d looked at Cas and and thought about grabbing the lapels of that fuck-ugly trench coat, shoving him back against the little plexiglass “in case of emergency” sign next to the door, and cutting off whatever biting words he’d been about to say with his tongue in Cas’ mouth.
Dean took a deep breath, forced the suffocating swell of sorrow back down, and went to find his brother.
He sat beside his brother in the quiet, and proposed a toast that seemed both too small for the moment and exactly, exactly right. Then he listened to Sam talk about writing their own stories, and thought about what it meant, to be free. By the time they went off to their own rooms to sleep before taking whatever step came next, Dean thought he knew exactly what to do now, finally free to choose.
“He said I could stay there, put down my burdens and rest, after all this time. Or that I could come to Heaven with him, to sit as his side, be restored to my former power, be the shepherd I always hoped to be. But . . .” Cas smiled now, with his eyes only, but Dean still felt it like a wash of sunshine on his face. “But I told him that, if I could truly choose, I would choose to go home. To you.”
“Amen to that,” Dean agrees fervently, bussing his knuckles against Eileen’s cheek affectionately as he walks further into the room. He clasps a hand to Sam’s shoulder as he passes behind him to get to the fridge.
“I lived here,” Sam explained, although Dean had already known. He would have known this was where his brother’s life had been even without the strange omniscience of this place; it felt like home. “We bought it in the summer of ‘22, when we found out about the baby. We never meant it to be forever, but we put down roots, and then we stayed. ‘Til . .  ‘til the end.”
“It’s a damn miracle this deck hasn’t collapsed and dumped one of your asses into the dirt, Dean,” Sam says blandly. Dean grunts in acknowledgment, but feels a well of protectiveness surge up in his belly for the ramshackle house and all the pieces of her.
He was sitting at the table bathed in amber light, looking disheveled and careworn. He had a book open in front of him that he was studying with his head tilted in that slightly inhuman way of his, like a bird, and his hand was wrapped around a cut crystal tumbler with a few fingers of Dean’s favorite whiskey in it. The bottle and an empty glass were sitting across from him, like an invitation. For just a moment, Dean stood in the doorway, paralyzed with the enormity of walking over and sitting down across from him, like he might have done every single day, if things had been different.
“Yeah, ok, Dean,” Sam replies eventually. His beer is empty now, and he stands up, brushing off his jeans as he goes and then setting one giangator hand down on Dean’s shoulder with infinite gentleness. “Just because something’s good doesn’t mean it can’t be better. Think about it, all right?”
“So how have you been, Jack?” Sam asked as Dean eased himself down into a chair, stiff and sore. Jack frowned at him as he did so.
“Hey,” Dean murmured bracingly. “Quit your frettin.’ ‘Tis but a flesh wound. I’ve had worse in a bar fight.”
Cas hums, a noncommittal noise that seems to reverberate around their kitchen. When Miracle pads across the floor to sniff at the dust on his shoes, Cas looks down at him with the kind of indulgent, adoring exasperation he used to save for Jack, when Jack was something they could keep.
.” Dean felt a weight lift off his chest, so heavy he felt lighter than air in its wake. “The angels . . . they stopped being my family the day I realized I found a new one. I existed for millennia, but I only truly lived when I walked the Earth beside . . . all of you.” Dean thought he’d been about to say something else. “I wanted to spend eternity with the people I loved, the ones who taught me how.”
Sam was still standing gobsmacked, silent, but Dean felt something crack open in his chest: the place where he had sealed away a very specific kind of hope so the flame of it couldn’t burn him alive. He leapt up from his chair before Jack could zap himself off to some distant plane of existence and out of their lives.
“Hey Sammy. What the hell are you drowning that lettuce for? You know the only thing Cas uses to keep the bugs away is threats of violence and that one really bitchy face he makes.” He looks over to see Cas shoot an unamused glance over his shoulder at him. “That’s the one.”
“Of course I came,” Dean replied fiercely, his fingers white-knuckled around his glass. “I was always going to come for you, Cas. In Purgatory, in Hell, on Earth. I always came for you, in the end. I would have come for you in the Empty, if I could have. I think I knew it was useless, but I was going to try, once I got Sammy past the worst of it, once I was sure he was going to be able to move on. I would have come for you anywhere, Cas. But I ran out of time.”
Castiel looks over at him again, seemingly studying him before looking down. “You don’t have to say that.” he says quietly.
In response, Benny simply tightens his grip even more, making the man drop to his knees as his face turns red.
Michael, still in the vessel of their half-brother Adam, slowly makes his way toward them. “When the rapture first began, I took refuge here. It
By the end of the next hour, everyone but Anna and Benny seem to be completely relaxed, not a care in the world- still giggling, chuckling and flirting even heavier with their significant others.
Bobby looks at them both and grins before taking a bite of his food. “So do all your other friends go to the same school with you, Cas?”
You have 1 new voicemail message. To play messages, please press 1. Sam sighs and presses the 1 key.
“He’s a great guy, your brother. I’m glad he and Dean found each other. I’m real happy for ‘em.” he says, chuckling when he looks at the two men giving each other heart eyes between intermittent soft kisses while holding hands.
“I’m your emergency medical contact,” Cas points out serenely, “and barbarism has its uses.” Dean looks back to see Sam and Eileen watching them, trying not to smile.
The kitchen is flooded with morning light from the paneled-glass doors that lead out to the deck, and it is empty of people but full of plants; herbs crowd the sill above the sink in old tea canisters and repurposed coffee tins, and vines crawl along the walls where they spill out of an enormous pot hanging in the far corner. The coffee pot is half-full and there’s a cup left in the sink with a few grounds swimming in dregs at the bottom. Dean’s favorite mug (faded black letters reading Female Body Inspector wrapping around the sides, a chip in the handle from the time he was cleaning weapons at the bunker’s kitchen table and Jack had accidentally knocked it into the edge of an angel blade) sits on the counter like an invitation. Miracle’s food bowl is empty, and he stands above it looking at Dean with imploring eyes.
, and realizes it’s neither of those things. It’s Cas, former angel of the lord, sitting with Dean’s brother and sister-in-law in the other room, seeing beauty in the little, ordinary life Dean has been building up around them.
When Dean makes it back downstairs, freshly showered and back in the jeans and layered flannel that will always feel like a second skin, Sam and Eileen are already there. Sam is standing at the sink washing veggies that Dean knows don’t really need it because they came from their own garden, and Cas would rather suffer pain of death (again) than use pesticides. He and Cas are laughing about something while Cas sautes mushrooms at the stove, and Eileen is watching them from the kitchen table with a small smile on her face, one hand on Miracle’s head where he sits at her feet, the other resting gently on the swell of her belly. Dean’s chest feels full of light and warm air.
“You’re all uninvited from dinner,” Dean announces, feeling aggrieved. “I’ll be out at the grill cooking awesome food that I will not be sharing.” He pauses, reconsiders. “Miracle can have some if he toes the line.”
Things slow down in the mid-afternoon, because Dean’s life has become predictable in ways he would have found appalling even a year ago, and he packs it in around 4:00, waving to Carlos and Dave where they’re smoking in the shade of the east wall of the shop. The Impala’s black paint radiates heat against his palms as he opens the door and slides into the driver’s seat, and he lets her carry him home.
He pulled the Impala up behind her car, got out, and went to join her. She glanced over at him when he eased his shoulder against hers, and offered him a wan smile.
Dean felt a sensation in his chest like cresting a hill at 85 miles an hour, like everything inside him was suddenly light in a way that made him realize how heavy it had been before without him even noticing the weight.
Dean sat with that pitch-dark ocean of grief for a few minutes, letting it wash through and above and around him, while the phone rang over and over in his ear. He had done this once before, alone on the floor, pinned down beneath the black-hole gravity of the place in the universe where Cas had been and was not anymore. That day, the feeling had been too big and too starfire-hot to even look at it directly, burning his retinas like staring into the sun, and he had simply closed his eyes against it, curled in on himself, and let it crush him under its weight. He’d thought about just staying there, letting the world end without him this time, but words had started to filter through the howling sound inside his head. I cared about the whole world, because of you. The thought of being anyone other than who Cas had died to save was so monstrous that the tidal pressure of his loss retreated in the face of it, and Dean had found the strength to stand up, to not give up on the world Cas had loved so much, to not let him down this one, last time.
Dean could barely nod in response. Cas rolled off the bed again but this time, he walked into the living room where Anna and Sam were asleep on separate ends of the couch. He was glad they were asleep as he didn’t expect Dean to be so loud but Cas was certainly glad he was.
Around Christmas time is when Dean and Cas decided to start seeing each other. Cas and Annie went to go see Chuck and Naomi in Kansas City while Dean visited Mary, who was doing well with a new heart medication. Unfortunately, Sam couldn’t make it back to Kansas for the holidays but managed to skype with Dean and his mother. They decided not to meet each other’s parents just yet as their relationship was still new.
Cas grabbed two handfuls of Dean’s flannel and pulled him close, nipping at his lower lip, “Hey, did somebody miss me?”
Smiling, Mary hugged her eldest son back, “I love you too, honey.” Dean sat in the chair next to her bed, still holding her hand when Mary’s smiled turned knowing and devious, “So, are you going to tell me the story between you and that adorable EMT?”
Cas stood up and started pacing around his room, leaving Dean sitting quietly on his bed at a loss of what to do. The sound of Cas’s fist colliding with the wall made Dean jump, “Cas, stop.”
Cas tried to stand but that plan was quickly destroyed with the intense head rush he got. Bracing himself on the table with shaky hands, he weakly nodded, “Yeah… I just—headache.”
The sobs started to hurt Dean’s throat as he tried to choke out the rest of his prayer, “Cas… it’s not fair. I—I loved you so much. Fuck… who am I kidding? I still love you. I see you everywhere. Every time I see or hear a motorcycle, I can’t go to the Roadhouse anymore. Hell… I can’t even look in the back seat of the Impala.”
Thankfully, the ambulance sirens could be heard approaching because Cas’s arms were getting tired and his compressions started to become ineffective. Not before long, two EMTs, Cas used to work with, Hannah and Miriam came rushing up to him, pushing a stretcher. Hannah recognized Cas and sighed, “Novak, why is it always you?”
Dean quickly stepped in, seeing Anna’s slight pout, “We can give her a ride home later, it’s no biggie.”
Mary shook her head and patted Dean’s thigh, “Don’t be silly. Go talk to your guy. Because if you don’t make up with him, point him my way.”
“Sir, please. He is a danger to himself and others, stand back.” The older male doctor was obviously trying to placate Dean and the detective was having none of it.
The older man was thankfully still very strong from working in the shop and easily lifted Cas up and carried him to his truck. Bobby knew he needed to get Cas out of the December air. He didn’t know what happened to Cas, he just knew that being outside in the frigid winter for too long wasn’t good for anyone.
Once they were inside the nice apartment, both Dean and Benny were on the same page. Benny’s warm hands on Dean’s hips were welcomed and not unfamiliar.
By the time Annie was dry, had her pajamas on, and her hair brushed (with minimal tears), she was half asleep. Cas picked her up and carried her out to the living room to grab her stuffed bunny she left on the couch. In the living room, Cas handed her the bunny and walked over to Gabe so they could say goodnight.
It started as a whisper, “…No reason we can’t do both…” but quickly grew into word vomit, “You know, you and me? This is it for me. I love you, Cas. And you don’t have to and I know it’s still kind of soon but I’d love for you to meet my parents. They live in Florida and it’s been way too long since I’ve seen them anyway—”
Christmas passed them all by with little celebration. Cas and Anna wore their red flower crowns and managed to skype with Gabe. Cas bought Anna new fabric and sewing supplies and Anna bought Cas some new novels. No matter how happy they were, Cas thought of Dean.
Once she was out of the way, training took over. First, assess the situation; no needles, no blood, no seizing, no weapons. Second, check the airway; no obstruction. Third, check breathing; not breathing. Fourth, check pulse; no pulse. Probable cause… cardiac arrest.
“Cas… come on. It’s time to wake up.” Dean pressed a kiss to Cas’s forehead and stroked his hair back. Cas was usually grumpy in the mornings but today was the one day he really didn’t want to wake up for. Today was the first day of Cain’s trial.
These are the five times Cas wished with his whole heart he could see and the one time he didn’t need to.
Through a few more kisses, they were both giggling and sloppily throwing their clothes off, staying in only their boxers. Cas took Abby’s harness off before getting comfortable in bed while Dean switched the light back off and laid down behind Cas, pulling him close against him.
Dean grabbed the lube and slicked himself up before wrapping one of his arms securely around Cas’s lower back and using the other hand to hold himself up. It took every ounce of self-control Dean had to go slow as he pushed into Cas. He couldn’t help the groan that escaped him, feeling the warmth squeeze around him. Once he was fully inside Cas, he looked at his beautiful face, “You okay?” Dean started to panic when he didn’t get an answer so he made sure Cas made eye contact with him, “Sweetheart, you still with me?”
Without Cas by his side, everything felt strange. Driving down the roads in Lawrence didn’t feel the same; they weren’t freeing and open, they felt like a life sentence in jail.
Dean eagerly kissed him back, wanting to be held and touched. He couldn’t help the soft moan that escaped his lips as Benny led Dean back to his bedroom. Their clothes easily fell off as their roaming hands became desperate. Benny held himself above Dean, passionately kissing him.
Gabe ordered his usual and Cas ordered something different, green tea. As they waited for their drinks, Cas started to lean on the counter more and Abby licked his hand. Gabe put a steady hand on Cas’s shoulder, “You alright, Cas?”
Cas kept his head down, refusing to make eye contact with Dean, “No.” He started scratching at the I.V in his arm and seemed like he was trying to take it out.
“You.” When Dean smiled at Cas his freckles were so clear over his summer-sun tanned skin and laughing green eyes made Cas’s heart stop.
“You call yourself a detective. Use your brain! He was a cop, his wife got murdered, the case went unsolved, he quote-unquote retired, then started racking up charges of his own. I mean, domestic abuse, assault, two D.U.Is, assault, a fucking hit and run, more domestic abuse—.”
The three friends walked into school, Jo and Charlie were still teasing Dean about his little "man-crush" on Leather Jacket, when Alastair grabbed Dean’s arm and held him against the cold, metal lockers. Alastair's snarled smirk made Dean's stomach churn, “Hey Winchester, how’s your baby bro doing?”
Cas’s blue eyes started to fill with tears as he clung onto Dean’s hand, stumbling over his words, trying to fight the medication the nurses gave him but Dean just hushed him and pressed their foreheads together, “No, baby. Just listen to me, I’m going to see you when you’re done and everything is going to be just fine. So, lay down and relax. It will be over before you know it. I love you so much.”
After Cas’s meek reply of, “…six months ago…”  Gabe smacked the back of Cas’s head, much to everyone in the shop, including Sam’s, horror.
When Cas tensed up, Dean pulled his mouth off of him so he could kiss his beautiful thighs, “You okay?”
Dean gladly hugged Cas back, “Good idea.” Dean let Cas lead him inside, trying not to trip on anything in the dark. In Cas’s bedroom, Dean couldn’t see anything, “Hey, Cas? Do you think we could turn a light on for a second?”
Anna tried to hide behind her straight, red hair, “A-Anna Novak.” Under Alastair’s disturbing stare, the young girl squirmed in her seat, obviously uncomfortable.
By the time Anna came running back in with the kit, Cas had drained two glasses of whiskey. He was determined to forget the fights, the betters, fighting with Bobby, Alastair, but above everything; Cas was desperate to forget the gorgeous green eyes that overtook his mind.
He floundered for a minute before recovering and pulling his brain cells together, “Do you have a son named Dean?”
Cas stood up and jogged off, trying to catch up with the fading blonde ponytail. When he saw that she really was running up to Dean, who clearly seemed to be on a date with a pretty redhead woman, Cas wanted to facepalm.
Dean complied and gently shut the door so it didn’t close too loud, “Is it okay if I come sit with you?”
When they got to the morgue a few minutes later, Dean flashed his badge to the receptionist and walked through the double doors into the sterile room. The most recent victim who was killed two nights ago was laid out on the exam table. She was a pregnant woman of twenty-seven years old. She was murdered the same way as the other victims; throat slit and the same mark drawn on her arms. The black ink looked like a backward ‘F’, it was drawn on them so small, it almost looked like a birthmark.
