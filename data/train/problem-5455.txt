"The man in 15a - I've seen him a few times now, do you know who that is?" Castiel inquired when Gabriel entered the crew area, followed by Balthazar.
"Try me."
believe what Cas was saying. "All right. I cannot be sure if Dean returns my feelings for him. I know he likes me, but... Love is a big word. What if I scare him away with it?"
"What?" Cas asked, hurrying to chew and swallow the piece he had bitten off.
"I was joking, you know. We always have a good time, and I know they are happy to have me around when I'm in San Francisco. And even if they don't want to include me in their weekend plans every once in a while, it's okay. I get it, I mean, who wants to have around their sibling all the time, anyways?"
Being called sir really was starting to get on his nerves.
When they parted, breathing heavily, foreheads still touching, Dean's hands continued to cling to Cas' coat, fabric buried in his tightly closed fists.
When he opened then again the scenery had changed.
The only thing he sometimes regretted was that they had kissed once. Because damn, Jo was a good kisser, despite her young age and, as he had learned later on, little experience. Now he couldn't help himself but pity that he'd never get the chance to kiss her again; that he had gotten a taste of something he'd be forever denied. Alas, at least he had gotten that one taste. And he was still convinced it had helped that tension between them immensely.
"I don't-- oh." The blush deepening told Dean that his lover now not only had heard, but also understood his words, and he smirked before he leaned forward to kiss a little crumb off the edge of his mouth.
That little voice reminding him that it was entirely possible the man was not in the slightest interested in flirtations he received from someone of his own gender was ignored.
"What in the name of... whatever can be more important than your future?!"
Surprise was on his side when he freed his hands of Dean's grip with quick movements and wound his arms around him, hands resting on his to-be lover's lower back and fingertips brushing past the elastic of his briefs, while Cas lodged one of his legs between Dean's. The sudden pressure against his erection made Dean yelp, and he Cas felt him instinctively flinch and pull away - and so he had, hadn't he been held fast by arms and seduced by lips seeking attention.
"Uh... hi," he began, willing himself to say something to the waiting flight attendant, but unable to remember why he had called for him - for
very shy when it came to sex, especially when his partner looked at him so openly and attentively as Dean did now. And their new position, with his lover presenting himself like this without hesitation, didn't exactly help.
But cold - cold wasn't a part of perfect. It was killing the perfect. And it was ridiculous because it shouldn't even have been there. That was the whole reason for the arrangement. Okay, part of the reason, but still, an essential one. Being warm thanks to the arrangement. Not cold. Shivering and curling in on oneself and waking up at all times when he could have been sleeping peacefully.
"That I want you to shut up and concentrate on work. We'll start any second and as soon as we're in the air and seatbelt signs are off you know there'll be enough to do. I'd really like to have that moment of quiet now," Gabriel clarified, voice hushed yet intent on making a statement that couldn't be misinterpreted. Castiel was aware that, while Gabe was fond of both his flight attendant colleagues and oftentimes the craziest of the three of them, he did have his moments in which he was a voice of reason. And he wasn't wrong - this was nothing they should discuss -
It were the most intense minutes he has experienced in his life this far.
"I love you, Cas," Dean confirmed quickly, then breathed out a laugh of relief. Finally, it was out in the open. That bottled up emotion that had weighed so heavily on him, smothered by fear and duty. "I love you." Once said, it became easier when repeated, and the taste and feeling on his tongue were that of the sweetest pie he had ever had, if not better. "I have for so long. I just wish I had understood it sooner, had not been so--"
Those who had shown him that he didn't need to fly in an airplane to spread his wings and feel free.
want, it was to be alone. He was not good when it came to relationships of any kind, and he had never even dared to think about, much less hoped for finding someone one day. And definitely not someone like Dean. Even if it didn't work out in the end - which he doubted, for some reason - he rather had that now, than regret his whole life to have not even tried it.
"It ain't, you idjit."
"You know my name. Not sure that's an effort many professionals in your area make. At least I never had anyone on flights call me by my name before." There was color spreading over his face Castiel cursed for its bad timing. So much for professionalism.
"It's perfect, Bobby." But on second thought, sadness welled up in him. "Well, almost perfect."
"Dean?"
He was halfway to his brother when he realized that he didn't even have Cas' phone number.
Castiel didn't know how long he spent just floating and doing nothing, but the dimmed light inside the pool area and darkness beyond the glass walls told him that it had been quite a while when he forced himself to move and at least swim back and forth a few times with strong strokes before he climbed out of the water and returned to his hotel room.
"I don't understand your problem, Dean," Cas said, ignoring his friend's complaint. "Is this because you are uncomfortable with physical closeness to another male? I assure you my healing of your genitals didn't have any sexual purpose."
"There! Again!" he called out, apparently all he was able to produce in regards to coherent speech. Not that Castiel had trouble understanding him. Feeling the muscles loosen slightly around his finger, he dared to carefully add a second to the one already inside, causing Dean to automatically try and pull apart his legs even further, to open himself even more for Castiel. His lover swallowed hard at the sight, and rewarded Dean with another brush against his prostate, which was answered by a jerk and a whine. He continued his light touching of that sensitive spot inside the other man, while he resumed the slow and rhythmic thrusting motion with his hand, getting Dean used to the intrusion and movement.
"Hey," the subject of his musings pulled him from the same, and Dean looked up into Castiel's smiling face.
"Bobby? Uh..." Dean frowned, even more confused now. He didn't recall this moment. Â "What memory is this?"
Now it was indeed like coming home, like
"This is Jo," she picked up quickly, and apparently hadn't checked the caller id before doing so, since she usually greeted Dean much differently.
waiting for my coffee!" the man in 9c complained loudly, causing the other passengers around him to look up and around curiously.
It had taken some effort and negotiation to convince Dean's boss that he just as well could do his work in his company's office in San Francisco, and that staying in Detroit was unnecessary, unless it was for short business trips that now happened once or twice a month and didn't last longer than three days at a time.
In no time they were airborne, and just as quickly it seemed they landed again. Dean suspected the wind coming from their back and pushing them forward; the more likely truth was that his mind was too preoccupied to notice much of anything, and that included the flight. Which was actually a good thing, now that he thought about it.
"No, it's fine. I... I wanted to talk to you about it, actually." Castiel coughed slightly, and blushed when he continued, "I have gotten a bit of information on the whole topic. Thought we might be able to see if we agree on its usefulness."
An hour later - an hour spent with listening to Balthazar's constant nagging he eventually gave into - saw Castiel standing outside the bar, watching the barkeeper approach him.
"The last thing I need," Castiel bit out, ducking away from the barkeeper's sight and choosing a booth that allowed a little privacy, "is some Dean look-a-like that only reminds me of someone I rather forget for now!"
And what did they know, anyway.
"Any time," Dean said, smiling as he did so.
"That's... that's great. And you know, you could always... uh..." Why was it so hard to offer company? They got along great, they liked it each other, they had the same humor. And Dean would really like to spend some more time with Cas. On the other hand, there was this ever-present nagging doubt that made him think that this was all just part of his job. The friendliness, the apparent alikeness between them. Wasn't that what flight attendants were supposed to do, make their passengers feel comfortable and at home? What did he have to lose, though, if he chanced a question, an invitation to some time spent together?
Now Castiel only had to be there, and hopefully not out. He hadn't wanted to call, so it'd be a surprise.
Dean could relate to that.
"What?!"
"He isn't. It's entirely his thing if he flirts with that woman. It's not my, or either of your business."
"Gabe still got an open tab from last time and is... busy this evening. You know, doing what--"
"Brushing down my chest, my stomach. Like you always do."
If something happened to him while driving Baby, if there was an accident, whether by his fault or anyone else's, it would surely shake up his world immensely. Mostly of course because it would mean that his car was damaged, perhaps even beyond repair. And then? Nothing would ever be able to replace the Impala that held so many memories, was such a vital part of his life, his history.
It was right on his flight the following Monday that Dean was in for a surprise. Arguably not one of the good variety; not entirely at least.
"I'll have a printout with all necessary information ready for you when you return from breakfast."
And as he held the angel, the
And certainly not from angels he did his best to claim not to share a very complicated relationship and even more profound bond with. Much less had a - totally manly, not that it mattered - crush on, thank you very much.
"Like guys? For years. But since I like them both, the ladies and the guys, I always tended to turn to the female population. Because... well... you know how dad was and all."
Feeling certain urgency to the task, Castiel was quick to fetch the water for his passenger. Maybe because the man was not well after the latest turbulence, being afraid of flying, as it seemed.
Sighing, Balthazar took a step back and look at Cas with a stern expression. "Cassie. You need this evening. Even if you only get a blowjob out of it. In any case, getting off by someone,
As a flight attendant, Castiel had been able to create his own little realm, at least in his mind. He was happy with his routines and his tasks, content to be a caretaker, be the one to provide those on board of his plane with everything that would make their trip as comfortable as possible. And he gladly passed on a part of his happiness he felt all these miles away from life on Earth.
"Thank you," Castiel whispered, while pouring the asked-for liquid from the bottle into a cup.
"Dean, I just asked about your car and you answered with a measly two sentences. And
"Because you're calling from Australia. On your
"Have you at least talked to Dean about
His partner though was still stark naked, a distraction that almost made him forget what else he had wanted to say when he had come back from the study. Almost.
"Of course I am, Dean." Slow steps brought him who was once again clad in his trademark trenchcoat to the dirt road, and in reaching distance of the human.
to. You see, in the past, in my childhood and youth... my upbringing..." Groaning, Castiel shook his head. He needed to sort his thoughts before he was able to explain what needed to be said, just so Dean would understand and not fear a mistake on his side anymore. Carefully, he began to speak again, considering the words he used to describe the situation and what had been going on in his mind, so Dean wouldn't get it all wrong and blame himself.
, Bobby had said.
"Dean?" a confused angel enquired, complete with tilting head motion, and Sam could have sworn he
"Yes, maybe, but it's none of my business, and neither is it yours. So come on, we have work to do," Castiel said, trying to pull his friend away from his stakeout position. He, however, remained steadfast in his position, a scowl on his features. One that was immediately noticed by Balthazar when he joined his colleagues in their little crew area.
If he asked his head, however, the answer was clear, as was the cause of action he had to take: Something had to chance. Even if, in the end, it broke his heart.
"Hey, whose side are you on?" Dean protested in mock anger and glared skywards when the next bit of water fell down on him. He really wanted to spend a little time longer in this beautiful scenery; this was definitely not how he had planned this evening to go. Not that he had planned anything... and wasn't that yet another instance of him lying to himself. Like he would go into such a meeting without a plan. His duffel that was still lying next to their seat was proof enough.
All that, however, he had become used to. It was his life - not always great, but it could have been worse. Hell, it
"Don't stop," Dean moaned, and Castiel found legs around his lower back that urged him on, so much that he sank all the way in faster than he intended. Not that his lover minded, going by sounds coming from him. Or was it Cas himself making a few of them as well? He wasn't so sure anymore. But the sensation was incredible, and his willpower to take this slow, out of care for Dean and in the light of his inexperience as the one topping, was waning dangerously.
The surrounding air masses wanted something else, apparently.
"8-20, as usual. One of these days we might just put your name on the door." Castiel knew it was a joke; he understood it as such also. But it stung nevertheless, being reminded that in this city, despite being here on a regular basis, he didn't have a home. Sure, the company would have paid for it, or at least supported him having a permanent residence, but what use was it to have two homes - one in his actual hometown, one where he travelled to the most due to his job - when he couldn't be quite at home in either? As much as he enjoyed his solitude, he often enough caught himself wishing for someone waiting for him when he returned. Someone who'd smile and take him into their arms and be his company in comfortable silence or during conversations about whatever they found interest in talking about. Someone to spend his free days with as well as his nights, explore the city with, learn from them, be shown all its secrets and wonders, be introduced to a family he never quite had, experience what it meant to be welcomed with open arms by a brother and a sister-in-law, by a partner's close friends who might just become his friends as well and---
. And wasn't it a curious idea to have. Dean Winchester, in love.
"And maybe it's for the best," Castiel mumbled, slightly miserable now that Dean was gone.
Just as Cas was five minutes early, Balt was, as usual, ten minutes late, which gave the younger flight attendant the chance to think through what he needed to bring up. Knowing full well that it would be gone again by then anyways. But there were things weighing on him, and he hoped that the self-proclaimed expert on 'all things sex and romance' held at least the idea of an answer.
"I can't begin to tell you how much I'm going to enjoy that for once, I'm not responsible for any passengers on the plane, or tourists around me. I'll just be one of them. And I swear I'm going to frequent that spa area with its variety on massages
Or were they?
"...and I strongly suggest for now that is all you do."
The door was open seconds later, and saw two men hurry through it, before it was closed again quickly by a foot kicking it shut. Because hands and other body parts suitable for closing doors were already busy grabbing onto each other, trying their best to explore as fast as passion demanded and it was humanly possible. Clothes were flying in all directions as they were thrown away carelessly, for they were not of any importance then. Only their boxer briefs were left when they finally found their way to - and onto - the bed.
"Nothing."
, so... dunno."
"I want to learn, though, Dean. I think I have to so we can truly enjoy our time together."
"Yeah, love you too, Dean," she huffed, but apparently decided to not mind beyond that, "What's up?"
Cas was just who he was. A good man with modest dreams and faith in the good things that could happen.
Castiel shook his head at the analogy his mind was providing him with. The last thing he wanted to think about was his friend's possible interest in Dean. Because Balthazar jumped - sometimes quite literally - everything that was attractive enough. And if there was one thing no one was able to argue it was Dean's beauty. Gorgeousness even.
"I miss Cas."
"Thank you, Dean," he interrupted him and leaned back a little to look into Dean's eyes, tears matching his now flowing from them. "Thank you."
"I wanted to ask whether you have to time to meet?"
"About damn time. Your swooning was driving me nuts. So are you...?"
"Sure, shoot."
"I was just wondering why he's a regular," he bit out, already turning to leave.
"A lot. But what do you mean?"
However, now that he had the chance, he couldn't help be struck by how gorgeous that man really was. And apparently also quite nice. There was his gut instinct that had green-lighted the stranger from the very first moment on, even if Castiel had no idea what he was supposed to do with the approval.
This man though, this flight attendant, was different, and it only made his interest grow. It was nice to have someone who actually seemed to care and tried to relate to the passengers, for a change. And he wouldn't like and claim that the other man's good looks didn't make things much better also.
"Well, he'll be back tonight, won't he?" Shaking his head, Dean trudged to his sofa and slumped down on it.
"Mhh..."
So when there was a knock on the door even though he didn't expect anyone, Castiel was quick to stride over and greet the visitor, whoever it might be.
"Uh... I'm sorry, I don't think I even really noticed. Bad habit of mine, shortening names. I didn't want to make you uncomfortable." Dean stopped and cleared his throat as heat crept up his face. Quickly he snatched his suitcase and turned towards the exit. "Well, Castiel," he continued, and to his horror the flight attendant actually flinched upon hearing his full name fall from Dean's lips. He left it uncommented, though, even when a strange feeling befell him. "See you on Friday?"
he wanted, was right there. And if there was something Castiel
Dean left the plane and headed to his car, intent on going home quickly to shower and change, which he was in dire need of after spending the whole day including the flight in his clothes. Then he'd head over to the hotel. From what he gathered, he should have just enough time to do all that, and if he was lucky, it would save him a too long waiting time.
"Well... Cas helped." There was a curious rise of eyebrows and the tiniest smirk on Bobby's face, while Dean himself felt the same bloom on his. Of course. How could he ever have thought that Jack would leave Cas in the Empty. Dean strongly believed Jack had meant it when he said that he wouldn't want to interfere anymore - but Cas wasn't just any random creature lost in the Empty. Cas was... special. In every way. "It's a big new world out there. You'll see."
"Angels are not supposed to be on Earth. Our place is here, in Heaven." Dean's heart, for a moment readying itself to dance of joy, sank once again.
"This was a bad idea," he murmured, shaking his head to himself.
In addition to that Castiel was also forced to wait in yet another line, but this time standing there himself, as he needed to renew his driver's license. And naturally he had to pick the day and time when half the city planned to do the same, which meant one and a half hour of standing, waiting, taking one step, stopping again, continue waiting, and listening to a constant flow complaints - though luckily not directed at him this time - and discussions. And if that didn't qualify as Hell, he didn't know what would have.
There was no verbal response this time - Castiel decided that the flesh in his mouth deserved the attention more than Dean's ears. As did a certain other part of his lover's anatomy, which he pushed three fingers into again, much to the other man's enjoyment, at least judging by the pleasure-filled growl it drew from his throat.
"You know what I mean." There was a moment of silence in which he looked up slowly and focused on Jo, narrowing his eyes while adjusting his brain to the conversation they were about to have. It actually took him a few seconds to understand that this was, despite the general remark, about Castiel.
"You're a terrible tease, has anyone ever told you that?" Dean complained, a half-hearted grumble in his voice and words, before he leaned down and claimed his lover's lips again, using tongue and teeth to try and spur Cas on, but he had none of it. Instead, he pulled his hand back, which was answered with an unhappy groan, and reached for the lube again.
- and there's no arguing about it - take you someplace you can have a look at some possible distractions."
"Cas," he breathed, his voice gone all of a sudden when it got through to his brain who the opening door revealed.
Dean did as Cas suggested, checking the work table in their little office. There were moments when Dean stopped and actually wondered if it was odd how much they shared - everything they had, everything they did, was a joint venture. He already had people warn him that sooner or later, they'd get tired of each other, and Cas had similarly been told to be careful; but the truth was, they were just making up for all the time they'd lost when they were together and never saw each other. Plus, it worked. There were moments when Dean wondered how exactly it did, seeing as only a little over two years ago, he had still been a bachelor who loved his solitude and freedom.
"He's got you there, Balty," the short man teased, grinning widely. Balthazar, however, gave himself entirely unfazed by his colleagues' teasing.
"You're here! Why are you here? Did the flight get cancelled? Did they change your flight plan? How long will you stay? What have you--"
Ever since he had been a boy, Castiel Shurley had longed to be up there, in the clouds, where dreary existence on Earth ended and Heaven began. Where he wouldn't have to think - and if only for a while - about things that had been making his life harder for so many years. About lost mothers who didn't know how to give love, and absent fathers who saw importance in so much save for their own offspring. About friends who lacked devotion and lovers who failed to understand.
"Want me to turn around?"
A place of peace. A place to be reunited with the ones you loved, without any conditions or limitations.
"Dean!" Castiel immediately protested, having followed his lover into the room.
The doorbell rung again, more demanding this time; or at least so it seemed. In any case was it getting on his nerves, and that was exactly what he was about to delay to whoever dared to come to him now that he was in such a bad mood.
Forever.
"No, really? Who would have thought," he couldn't help but tease the other man, taking the now empty coffee cups they'd just had and rinsing them out.
Dean may not have had Cas' number - but he sure did have Jo's, and he knew that his friend was going to want an update. If she found out on Monday that something had happened on Saturday already, she would definitely make him walk from the airport.
"Balt... what are you doing here?"
Dean's jaw definitely took a dive at what he saw. Wedding? Now that was new.
"Can I bring you something?"
boy. Lucifer's child, there to bring destruction and death to the world, had proven like no other that no matter your predefined destiny - in the end you always choose your own path. And wasn't that a lesson to be remembered.
Showed how desperate he was, Castiel realized, but decided to ignore it.
The moment four-thirty arrived, his computer was shut down and his seat empty. In record time he reached the airport, even though it was pretty useless, seeing as there was no way he could have gotten an earlier flight. And he didn't want to either, anyways.
can."
"Come on, Cas, it's not like she understands a single word of what I am saying."
Until he reached Dean's apartment.
Castiel Shurley never broke rules.
The landing had been unspectacular, and getting off the plane a quick affair - both for which he was quite grateful, especially after that flight and the turbulences. But then, Dean had to admit, was there also something positive to these turbulences - or someone.
A gentle hand brushed Dean's cheek in a fleeting gesture.
Right now, Castiel was stuck in South Africa, after their flight had been delayed for safety reasons. Something was wrong with the plane, and while Dean was all for not taking any risks, especially when it came to flying - and his lover - it meant that Cas wasn't going to be back in time before Dean had to leave for Detroit again. And it had been like this the past two weeks, just as it was about to be in the upcoming couple of.
"I'm sorry, Cas... gotta take this, it's Sammy," he apologized and got up, walked a few steps away from the bench as he pressed the 'accept' button.
Those questions didn't need an answer. Actually, he rather tried not to give them one, not even in his mind.
"There's just... nothing else to tell."
The steward frowned in confusion. Work name? What did he-- And then it dawned on him and it was his turn to exclaim "Oh!" quickly followed by a rambled explanation of "No, it is actually my real name, but also the name of an angel. The angel of Thursday, and the angel of travel. The name means 'my shield is God'. My parents were very religious and had taken a special interest in angels. I was born on a Thursday, so they decided I--" Castiel stopped when he found Dean staring at him, suddenly self-conscious and realizing that he had just told a stranger, a customer, half his life story without asking if he even wanted to know. Aside from it being entirely inappropriate to begin with, getting this personal with a passenger. "I'm sorry," he so mumbled, and had already half turned away, an excuse along the lines of, I should resume my work, on his lips, when a tentative hand on his wrist stopped him. The moment he turned back the hand vanished and Castiel missed it immediately, allowing himself a quick glance down as if he expected...what? That his skin glowed because of the touch? That there'd be a handprint left, a mark he'd forever bear on his skin?
He'd probably been a hopeless case the moment he first met Castiel. Naturally so - who could ever resist the charm of a handsome man with his innocent friendliness and clueless charm? Cas was what Dean had never known he was looking for. Not someone who was calculating and too self-assured in themselves; but was an honest and kind soul. Not spoiled and rotten by this world that taught so effectively to everyone that it was good to be someone, just not oneself.
Dean couldn't help but chuckle at her words. She was nice, even though her blatant flirting and the touching that was still going on shamelessly were a bit too much for him, and he wondered how he was going to communicate that to her without being impolite. Every other time he would have immediately leapt at the chance that was presenting itself to him, but now... Now it was entirely different. Now there was a certain flight attendant occupying his mind, and he was the one and only person he wanted to fall onto something soft and bouncy with.
"Not to you," came the sing-song reply of a man who knew he had just hit the right mark. "Just admit that you were distracted."
Yes, he had never told Balt his opinion on it, too eager to learn and experience; and he surely hadn't told Dean before he had allowed him into his hotel room, knowing all too well how the evening would end.
"But I'm asking you to. As part of your... passenger service?"
Neither had he ever expected to once have someone he really
"I want to try something, Cas. I want us to... have some fun together. Over the phone."
Behind the hotel's check-in desk a receptionist was eagerly tapping away on his computer keyboard; he looked up immediately when Dean stepped up to the counter though, a smile that was obviously well-practiced and anything but real plastered to his face.
"Nah, it'll be fine, don't worry. Enough time still, Sammy called me early. Come on."
"Can you tell me the name of this person, sir?"
"I don't know. There was never an opportunity, I guess." His friend's raised eyebrow told whole tales of how much Balt did
"Uh... marriage. I take it you saw..."
"Um... do we need one?" Cas asked hesitantly after a few seconds. The desire to feel all of his lover burned hot inside him, but when Dean tensed and leaned back a little, he quickly added, "My job requires regular health check-ups, and I haven't had a partner in..." Averting his eyes, the last part was only an indistinct mumble. "A very long time." There was no reaction from Dean whatsoever, and Castiel wasn't sure if he was supposed to be worried now - or relieved that the other man was still there. So he simply asked, "You?", and tried to hide his uncertainty.
"Fears are a strange thing, aren't they?"
"Where are we going, anyways?"
"I believe you can. You see, the thing is - you know my name, but you've yet to tell me yours,
And it was good.
It was then that their movements slowed, their urgency reduced a little, and they came to lie side by side, facing each other, and kissing gently, softly, faces framed with each other's hands and legs entangled to keep close.
He felt envious of those people swarming about that didn't seem to mind their current situation. They laughed and chatted and fought to stow away their hand luggage in the overhead bins - all the while Dean was already seated and securely fastened by his seatbelt, which held the vain hope that it would be of any use should something happen. Something he rather didn't give any closer thought to now.
"Hello, Dean," he still managed to get out, before he turned and walked back into the hotel room, leaving the door open for the other man to follow.
"Where's Gabe? It's not like him to miss a chance for... well. Such an evening."
"Spread your legs a little, Cas. Allow me to touch you without hindrance." The whimper that followed Dean took as answer then, not forcing the other man to actually respond with words; he was sure he wasn't able to anymore anyways. "I'm there, Cas," he reminded gently, "and when you touch your cock now it'll be my hand; it'll be me wrapping my fingers around you. Are you hard already, Cas? Can I feel how much you like that touch?"
Their hands parted only for short moments it took to get out of the car, but rejoined immediately after, and coming to stand at the handrail, fingers still knotted together and holding on, and shoulders touching in an comfortable exchange of warmth and presence, they relished in the light breeze around them, and the still-warm glow of the sunset.
"Dean--"
"Um... actually I had kinda forgotten about the concert..." Dean knew Jo well enough to put a little distance between his ear and the phone as soon as he had spoken the words, and indeed could he still hear his friend's yelling even then.
"Yes, I--" But Dean didn't want answers to questions he already knew the same to. He just needed to sum it up for himself, to be sure he truly understood what he had just heard.
"Unless you have hooked up with someone," Jo exclaimed, not even bothering to make it a question, and Dean groaned. "That's it, isn't it?! You got lucky this weekend!"
With a sigh Castiel picked up his own suitcase and the baby bag, and took another look around. It was going to be the first time he left home and went to an airport not to work, but to find a temporary new home, rest and relaxation - with those he loved most close by.
Of course he didn't go and openly tell the world about it. Someone like him, especially with a father like he had had, couldn't expect everyone to happily accept the he had a fondness for both parties. So he didn't and kept mostly quiet about it. After all was his love life his business alone, and no one else's.
"No big drama, just..."
"Dean, no, it's okay, everything's okay. It's just..." Carefully he approached the other man who seemed to have relaxed a bit upon hearing Castiel's reassurance, but still watched him warily as he came closer. "It was different. I didn't..." Once again he trailed off, and groaned. He didn't know how to explain it. Hell, he didn't know
"Heya, Cassie."
There used to be a time he would have refused and protested, protected the piece of clothing that had belonged to his late father with all his might. There also used to be a time when he would never have openly flirted and spent time with another guy, much less kissed him outside the privacy of a locked room
"Hey Dean, warm up your Xbox, I got the new game!"
"I'm not sure I should--"
Whatever it was, Dean had long since accepted that it was much more important and essential than an affair with a good time and even better sex.
"That's not the point, Dean. From what you've told me so far he seems to be a really sweet and nice guy. And you have a way to sometimes forego your usually caring nature when it comes to the people you sleep with."
"Thank you, Yanny. I don't know what I'd do without you."
"Good, because," he pulled back a little, until he was able to look at Cas, but his arms still held on, "if this is my Heaven, I make the rules, and there is no more leaving and losing of people I love."
"Seriously, Balt? Don't you have something to do?!" Castiel snapped at the other man standing in the galley and chewing on a lollipop - his only substitute for cigarettes during flights, as he claimed - he had probably gotten from Gabriel.
"I'm gonna get the rest of the finger foods. Help me, Cas?"
The frustration on the angel's face was so incredibly adorable. And the relief flooding through every fiber of Dean the best feeling in a long time. And so he laughed. He laughed with so much freedom in his belly, contentment in his mind and love in heart, that tears streamed down his face. Tears of happiness over Cas being back, over not having lost him, he who was the single most important person in his life - and afterlife - besides his brother.
"Hello, Yanny. And thank you. How have you been?"
Of course he didn't know what he expected out of it. The chance that he'd be allowed to get to know the flight attendant better, to even see him outside his work, was, given Dean's track record with acquaintances that demanded a bit more effort than being chatted up in a bar or something, rather small, but that didn't mean he wouldn't try. Something told him the dark-haired, blue-eyed - and weren't that eyes of the bluest blue he had ever had the pleasure to look into - man was worth it.
, what had he gotten himself into.
"I take orange, please," his favorite customer informed him right away.
"Uh... Sammy and Jess are here. And Charlie." Lowering his voice, he added, "They've been nagging me to introduce you to them. Sorry I didn't give you a heads-up. Wanted to do that on the flight, but then you weren't on it and they fetched me from the airport and I forgot to call you."
"Of course you, handsome. Guys like you are never free. But should you ever be... you know... find me," she said, winking at him as she did, and took her book that was lying on her tray table. And when he looked up once more, he saw Cas return his earlier smile.
"Excuse me?"
For a moment Cas believed they were done with words and could return to actions - he hadn't counted on Dean, however, and on his openness. Much less had he counted on it completely taking his breath away and making him stutter in his thoughts and actions alike.
"Just thought it'd be nice to talk for a bit," Cas replied, words already slurred. He mustn't fall asleep though. He couldn't risk it.
With confidence and his most charming smile in place, he strode over to the reception of the Seaside Inn. After a restless night that had him tossing and turning and wrecking his brain about what was the right course of action, something entirely new to him who usually was so confident when it came to his affairs and conquests, he'd come to a decision.
!" Castiel yelled, only to stare at the other two men with wide eyes, as if they held an explanation for his sudden and very uncharacteristic outburst. Well, technically, they did. Not that it - or they - helped the matter. Closing his eyes to calm himself down, Castiel leaned against a cupboard. "He's a passenger. There are rules. End of story." Opening his eyes again, the dark-haired man looked at his two friends and colleagues with a serious expression on his face that begged for understanding. "It would really help if you could just accept that and thus make my life easier as well. It's bad enough I have to see Dean twice a week."
"Yes, it's just... there's something..."
"TouchÃ©."
The problem of being cold.
Another hum, accompanied by a very faint
"Really? You want to make that effort yourself when it's so much more comfortable to just sit in a comfy seat and let yourself be flown to your destination?" Dean teased gently, nudging the other man's cheek with his nose before placing a light kiss at the same place.
Maybe diving in head-first wasn't such a bad idea.
"Yes. Every time I set foot in an airplane, it's like spreading my wings whereas else I can't. It's the only way I know. If I happened to be in a crash it would be like... losing my wings. If I survive, that is."
"That means you're available to San Fran's local female popularity on weekends. Well, isn't that good to know," the still nameless woman purred into his ear, shifting a little closer still, as much as the armrest between them allowed her to. "I'm Pamela, by the way."
"Um... so do I... thank you." He groaned inwardly and resisted the urge to slap himself, instead forcing himself to recite the phrase he and his colleagues had to bid their passengers farewell with: "Thank you for flying with 8th Heaven Jetways."
"There is no
, so much that he missed them to a point where it hurt. And that was something no one had taught him to deal with. Sure, he missed his brother when they were a few states apart, and he missed Charlie and Jess as well, because they were family, they were like sisters to him. But this, this thing with Cas? Entirely different. And maybe, in a way, even stronger.
There was just one thing - one tiny, little thing - that had taken residence in his life recently he really had a problem getting used to.
Castiel's heart disagreed nevertheless.
"Okay, spill. What's up?"
"Of course," Castiel immediately replied and got up, following Jessica into the kitchen. But once there, the blond woman entirely ignored the fridge that held aforementioned snacks; instead, she whirled around and faced the man behind her in a movement so quick that Castiel had to take a step back.
"Dean..."
"Gabriel!"
"We really ought to teach you how to live a little. You don't even go out to have the chance to meet someone like this man."
When he eventually spoke again, it was with a quiet voice.
The next time he had the chance to look towards Dean's row, the man was gone.
Replies and phones became unimportant the moment he opened the door.
The man smiled gently, a gesture that set off a very annoying bunch of butterflies happily flapping their wings in Cas' stomach, and said quietly, "Thank you for telling me."
The moment he started the engine, the familiar sounds of "Carry On My Wayward Son" by Kansas blasted through the speakers, and he looked over to Cas who was already nodding his head ever so softly in the rhythm of the song.
"Stay, I'll be right back."
He protest and any attempt to stop them was cut short when one of the passengers rung the service bell; from the person he tended to in the second row he could only catch a quick glance at Balthazar speaking to Dean, before he was called to yet another of their guests.
Dean really liked Jo. Even though she was ten years younger than him, even though she had only just made it into her twenties, she was an old soul he enjoyed having around. Once he had even tried to hit on her, but had been turned down hilariously quick and effective. It hadn't been funny back then, but over time Dean had come to appreciate the blond girl and her badass attitude so much, and a true friendship had grown between them, leaving behind any and all social misdemeanors that may once have been.
"Very well. It was a quiet week. Spring holiday season is mostly done, and till the summer tourists arrive it'll be another two or three weeks. So you should also have the spa area to yourself," the hotel employee answered, and added a wink to his last words, knowing all too well how much Castiel enjoyed a swim, especially when the pool was empty.
"Dean."
"Well, we'll practice that one. Next time we'll only be a room apart or so. Speaking of which, we really ought to find an apartment for the two of us. One that is actually ours and you're comfortable to come back to, even if you are alone. But Cas, you know that you can always stay at my apartment, even if I'm not there, right?"
But Castiel's extensive preparation didn't seem to be all that much in Dean's interest.
Eventually he managed to regain his voice - and ability for speech, telling the waiting steward, "Water would be great, thank you," and even found a smile in his muscle memory. "Not a fan of flying," he added with a light laugh, though it sounded desperate more than anything else to his ears.
"Yes, one second!" He rolled his eyes, and once again only spoke loud enough for Cas to hear, "I love them, but sometimes they drive me insane. Okay, are you ready for this?"
He wasn't all that wrong either. Even though Dean decided to save the epic eyeroll for later and concentrate on getting back to his feet - literally - first.
I had left, I would have written you a note or something. Which, thinking about it now, doesn't make it that much better, but still, I would--"
"Oh crap, I'm so sorry, Cas! I thought since you won't be home this weekend and Sam's gone as well, I'd just stay in Detroit... damn. You know, let me check if I can find a flight, then I can be home--"
Alas, his way to the elevators was unhindered, and within not even a minute, Dean was on the eighth floor. Lucky for him Cas always stayed in the same room - the advantage of being a frequent guest - so he hadn't needed to ask his lover for the room number and thus raise suspicions, and spoil the surprise.
"Now. What's the big drama?" he didn't waste time with niceties as he fell into a chair.
Cas laughed lightly at that. "We used kind of a secret entrance, but it is monitored by cameras, and any unauthorized person would cause an alarm and security escorting them out immediately."
"You... guess?"
Once again unable to resist his own body's demands and rubbing his palm against the head of his cock that was resting hard and heavy on his stomach, he nearly missing the mumbled, "here," telling him that the other man had what he'd need now.
How could he have been so wrong about Dean? He really had thought that there was a connection, that they both felt it. After all, he had come to the hotel with the intention of seeing him, of... well, maybe only to see him for that one night. Granted, there had been tension between them on these past flights, tension someone else than Castiel might have taken a step towards resolving much sooner. Alas, he wasn't that kind of person - wasn't someone to let another in his bed and life quickly, wasn't someone to give away what he believed were the most intimate and vulnerable moments in one's life; that precious time of togetherness he had wasted once too often with Balthazar, who has no regard for what Castiel thought of as so special.
"Yes..."
A string of No's.
"So... do you think we can talk about it during our holiday?"
Because more often than enough, besting one's own fears opened doors to places. And people. And
Was he even still their Cas,
alone.
Sighing, Dean gave up, knowing that he couldn't win anyways. Jo always got out of him what she wanted to know, and besides, he wanted to talk about it. At least to one person. So if that person happened to be Jo, who was one of his best friends, who was he to refuse?
Nodding lightly, Dean brought up a hand to cup Cas' face. Gently his thumb caressed the angel's cheek while their eyes exchanged what words could not have expressed properly.
"You were gone when I woke up, so... yes, I thought you--"
"You, Dean!" the flight attendant shouted, recoiling instantly when he realized the, for his standards, violent reaction. Calmer, he continued, "I want
"Dean?" he breathed, his voice just now deciding to refuse working. In return, he earned himself a frown and an apprehensive half-smile.
Seconds passing in silence seemed to become a bad habit of this phone call when yet another few moments neither of them spoke. Dean kept wondering if there wasn't something he could do, any way he could meet up with Cas so he could at least see him for a few hours, but then he guessed the effort would be too great. He would do it, but he couldn't ask it of his lover who he knew liked staying in the calm and quiet of a hotel room or apartment when he wasn't working.
"No, I mean... this whole past week was very unpleasant, and it is... nice to have a friendly passenger like you every once in a while. I was... really looking forward to today."
It hit him out of the blue, and yet it didn't come as a surprise. Of course he loved him. Had for quite some time. Why else should he have thrown all cautions in the wind and allowed himself to have an affair - a relationship - with a passenger, when it was strictly against company policy?
Dean never got the chance to let the words sink in and ask Cas what
"Hey, I'm sorry I didn't say it right away, but I'm sort of... taken." He didn't know what reaction he had expected, but it certainly hadn't been low laughter and her readily assuming her normal seating position that left some space between them again.
Shaking his head, he scolded himself for giving in to hopes and fantasies. For being ungrateful. He should be thankful for what he had gotten here; he
There was a rock in his stomach - it could only have been a rock, judging by the heavy feeling - that needed to be taken care of, and even though he was not happy to do so, he carefully detached his left hand from the armrest to push the button on the panel above his head that would call for one of the flight attendants.
Sometimes he wondered what people would think if they knew of his thoughts; how he wished to be up in their air, but without the means of a plane or any other technological or mechanical help. He knew most would deem him crazy; his notion that maybe, at some point in his existence, some time before he came to be in human form, he was someone else, something else, something that was able to lift up into the clouds on their own volition, whenever it liked and wanted to. A bird, a butterfly, a bee. Or something bigger and more fantastic. Or something - heavenly. Like an actual angel.
, exactly?" Sam heaved a sigh, one he reserved for 'how do I deserve such a dense brother' kind of situations - as such this moment doubtlessly qualified.
"Can I ask you a question?" the flight attendant right then stopped his train of thought, something Dean wasn't all too sad about.
, life.
It was almost ironic that they should meet again in such a shop here in Heaven. Or maybe that was what Heaven was about. Setting things right.
"Good morning, Mr. Shurley. Yes, caught the short straw again," the man replied, winking as he did so, and handed Castiel the newspaper; a personal service Yanny had once agreed to offer to his favorite guest.
Even though the redhead walked straight into his apartment without waiting for an invitation - not that she needed one - she also turned around immediately as soon as she was past him and he had closed the door, opening without preamble,
Nope, that was definitely a first. And Dean decided that while he was totally on board with what his mind - heart - had made him do, he wouldn't give it too much thought. For now.
"Has something happened?"
And anyways, why was he even thinking about this? They were flight attendant and friendly
"Hey guys. What can I bring you?"
"It's not... it wasn't a hookup. There was just... a very nice flight attendant on the trip here. That's all."
"I want to see you, Dean. I want to see your face," he said with a finality that he hoped Dean wouldn't argue with; and indeed the other man gave a quick nod of understanding and then smiled, as if he hadn't expected this, but was happy about it. It also gave Castiel the courage to add, "I want to see your face when you fall apart because of me," and he had to take a shaky breath afterwards, not quite believing he had actually said that. His lover's surprised, but delighted expression however confirmed that he had indeed uttered the words, albeit quietly.
He hadn't wanted to go there.
"Frequent. Not happily, but necessary. You?"
A loud moan interrupted Dean's word, made him almost choke on air. It were those sounds that rewarded him every time he pleasured Castiel even though he knew that night he wouldn't find release unless it was by his own hands. But hearing Cas, seeing him getting lost in the sensations - it was always enough.
It was going to be the best surprise. At least he hoped it was.
"Of course, Dean. I merely wanted to assure that you are all right. And you needn't worry, the residual grace left during the healing process also won't affect the functionality of your urinary or reproductive system."
The garden was still empty when he arrived; Castiel was not yet there. Nevertheless he had no problem getting in, and awkwardly thanked the empty air - in the direction of where he assumed was the camera - and strolled into the area rich of greens and a diversity of colors and sweet smells. His duffel he'd taken with him, just in case, he dropped next to the bench they'd sat on the last time they were there; then he decided to use the time and take a closer look at all the plants and flowers around.
"I'm Gabriel," the short one on front of him answered, "and that's Balthazar. Castiel and we are not only colleagues, but also friends, and have been for a long time. And we will not watch when you play with Cassie's feelings, Dean-o. So hands off that brunette!"
"Jack. He brought me back here."
When he leaned in for another kiss, he found it eagerly deepened by Dean, getting eventually past the light teasing and necking and back on track for what both expected this night to lead to. Disengaging his hands from Cas' face, Dean let them glide down the other man's body, and Castiel became unable to concentrate on the ongoing encounter of their lips when he got lost in the feeling of warm palms and clever fingertips on his skin instead.
"I wish I had wings..." Castiel replied thoughtfully to Dean's enquiry about his dreams and hopes, "I could fly whenever I wanted to and not be limited by anything." He sighed. "Didn't have to wait and hope for being hired by an international company."
If Dean had told anyone about it, they surely wouldn't have believed him. At least not those who had known him for years.
Heaven's Door was the regular bar for all 8th Heaven's employees, once chosen by them. Incidentally, it bore the right name for that group of people, which may or may not have helped the decision. But by not being far away from the airport, and having moderate prices and nice personnel, it was okay; even if it didn't have the most outstanding offers in food and drink. And it definitely was a nice meeting place.
"Before you go any further," a familiar yet almost shockingly loud voice unexpectedly boomed through the cabin, and when Castiel turned around, he indeed found no other person than Dean Winchester standing in his row and glaring at the passengers around with a dark look on his face, "I vote for this nice flight attendant who is
"Haven't seen your handsome face around here before," she began, leaning slightly over to him, her raven hair brushing his bare arm and making it tickle. "Off on a short trip, or frequent flyer?"
"And you love me for it!" Cas couldn't help it then - he laughed. He didn't remember the last time he'd been in such a ridiculous situation, but he was sure it had also been with Balt. And Gabriel, possibly. Speaking of...
Down the road, a ten minute walk, the trees and bushed turned into a field, a wide plane of another shade of green. In the distance a cozy cottage could be spotted.
"Because you're one of them," the younger flight attendant remarked dryly, and at least it helped distract Gabriel for a moment when the chief laughed.
"You ever been to Califor--" Dean began, but then snapped his mouth shut and groaned. "Of course you will have been, sorry. Yet here I am, about to give you a few tourist recs."
"Listen; Dean-o," he began, using the nickname he knew Dean hated, "if you hurt him..." There was a pregnant pause the steward used to raise his eyebrow and twirl his hand in front of him in a meaningful gesture. When he didn't continue after several seconds, Dean growled in irritation.
"Yeah, I get that, hold on a second, it's Castiel..." Should he guess? Try a few common names? Maybe he was lucky. He had talked to Cas so much that he had made himself believe he knew him so well. It was like a splash of cold water. Dean knew next to nothing about his flight attendant. He was just Castiel.
"No, thanks Cas, I'm fine," he replied, then however lowered his voice to barely above a whisper and added, "unless it's yourself on a silver platter." Castiel's eyes widening scandalized and with the slightest of embarrassment surely was worth it, Dean thought, and winked at his lover with a grin. Who was quick then to overcome his momentary shock.
"Spoilsport."
Shaking his head at his mind's repeated detour into regions of thought he really rather didn't want to have, he quickly made his way back to his car. So he'd just spend the afternoon and evening in his hotel room reading after all.
"How was the weekend?"
And Dean knew all too well that he didn't help matters of Castiel trying to hide same blush when he added, "That's good to hear," while winking at him.
"Now that we don't see each other that much, we have to be open with each other. So we can make the most of the time we have," Dean added after they parted again, and Cas hummed in agreement, realizing how right the other man was. He could be honest with him, that much he knew, and he should well make use of it.
Of course he had no idea. How could he. It wasn't as if he had told him anything last night, before they had hung up after their...
try, and we
"I guess angel is approved of, then?" Dean murmured against Castiel's lips when they slowly ended the kiss, and the flight attendant could only do so much to keep that funny feeling in his stomach in check as he nodded and pecked the lush, pink skin in front of him once more. Soon enough though he found himself nudged to continue what he had interrupted a few minutes before, when Dean rolled his hips against Cas', brushing their cocks together.
Castiel groaned and rolled his eyes at that. "You're disgusting sometimes."
And just like that, they were in one of their usual conversations about Dean's love life - yes, Jo, was one of the very few he had those with - with the tiny difference that for once, they were not talking about an already happened one-night stand Jo now tried to convince Dean to rethink his opinion on - which usually was,
"You what's also great about the place?"
"With
"Alone as it might be," Jo quipped, quietly, and pointedly ignored Dean sticking his tongue out at her.
"No, it's not that... it's just... there's this concert I really wanted to go to and..." A crooked smile appeared on his face then. "Guess what, you're the reason I've totally forgotten about it," he finished, grasping the other man's hand as he did so. With their fingers entwined, they sat for a moment longer, before Dean stood again, pulling Cas up with him.
?" Castiel pulled a face at that, and he was aware that Balthazar didn't require a verbal answer anymore then, so he saved the energy for the lecture he was sure going to get now.
"That is probably because he hadn't found the right person yet. Some people search their whole life; others at least half of it. We have both been lucky to meet the other, or I wouldn't be in a relationship either." Castiel's no-nonsense tone of voice as he stated what were simple facts was enough to have all of them - even Dean - stare at him open-mouthed. Dean was the first to recover, being used to how his lover was, and smirked.
With a shocked gasp Castiel looked up. Had he just...? He really needed to stop that. Stop thinking of Dean and how his family and friends could be theirs, how he could ever have a place in this man's, this
So he would do almost everything in his power to make his dream come true.
"Cassie, will you sit down already! We're already in position for take off!"
"Nothing's
"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do I know this guy? Do I have reason to be jealous?"
Both those things, however, had the potential to end something he didn't want to lose. No matter how hard it was to cope with not seeing each other for weeks on end, being so far apart most of the time, practically not really having a relationship in a classical sense. So they were not 'classical' either, but that didn't mean that a little bit of that standard mainstream normality that was usually associated with relationships shouldn't apply to them, too.
And now he had to pay the bitter price for it - a taste of a man he had hoped he could have so much more with and that would result in a yearning for things he'd probably never find again, and a broken heart that would not be mended for a long time. Not as long as he would have to see Dean on their flights; and he was quite certain that the other man wouldn't just reschedule his whole life to use another airline, all of which didn't have these for the business man convenient flight times 8th Heaven offered.
"Yeah, sure. See you on the other side?" It took the flight attendant a moment to understand the words; he laughed lightly when he did, though, something that was answered by an impish smile.
This wasn't Dean. This wasn't the man he truly wanted. And this also wasn't a substitute, because no matter how much another ever looked, or sounded, or acted like his favorite passenger - he was not Dean Winchester. No one was ever going to be except the real thing; and it was all Castiel wanted. Because this was not about quick sex with a pretty face and body - this was about a bond formed with another human being he had connected to right away.
"You, flirting with that nice dark curls lady next to you. I mean, I totally get it, she is hot, but from what I hear you already have one ball in the air, and I very much suggest that's all you should have right now."
He changed the angle now and then, lightly pulling at the muscles surrounding his two fingers, carefully stretching Dean's hole while keeping the movement to a steady in and out. Soon enough, a third finger followed, easily finding a way in.
The rain didn't stop once during his trip. He drove up to Fisherman's Wharf, visited the museum and enjoyed himself although he mused that maybe it would have been more fun and interesting with some company. He didn't dare to continue the thought after that, knowing full well where it would lead him; or to whom, to be more precise. This crush he had was bad enough as it was.
- so busy that he flew across half the country several times a month, he surely wouldn't have time to arrange his schedule according to Castiel's shift plan so they could see each other on a regular basis.
lines.
He had talked over the hoarse chanting of 'yes yes yes' that came from the other end of the line, but stopped the moment when Castiel moaned his name, drawn out and with a broken voice. And it was only then that Dean reached down and brought himself to a quick but intense climax.
Though Dean wasn't sure that would have been the best of things in that moment. Because he really couldn't control his thoughts right now.
Recently, however, things had changed. His life, his job, traveling back and forth between two states only so he could be close to his brother as often as possible, even if same brother, four years his junior, was now a young man himself already, and on his way to become - what Dean believed - a prestigious lawyer and - what Dean hoped - a family man soon, took its toll on him, physically and emotionally.
"What?"
"That'd be different. I wouldn't be using my job to... to... I don't know! Get closer to him, get to know him? It's wrong and unprofessional, and for a good reason."
"You can go to sleep," Dean whispered gently into his ear as he still fought against dozing off, "I'll be here when you wake up." And it was the promise that helped Castiel to eventually allow himself to fall into a restful slumber.
The by now so familiar voice, and the words that had become something that could almost be called tradition, soothed Dean's strained nerves. It was so good to have the chance to talk to Castiel, even if it was only over the phone. It was rarely enough these days, their busy schedules and his lover traveling the world keeping them apart more often than not, but for now...
"Can't say you're not prepared," Castiel couldn't help but quip at the sight of the lube, completely new as it seemed. From his experience with Balthazar, he was used to little foil packages; only later on he had bought a bottle for himself, simply for practical reasons. It gave him a funny feeling in his stomach that Dean hadn't brought the one-time use only packages that always had given him this impression of something quick and unimportant. Which it had been.
"Not you as well," Dean groaned, but didn't let Jo react to it before he continued, "Yes, I kinda forgot about it, so big deal. Happens. It's not like--"
Castiel wasn't sure what he expected, but the passenger in front of him flinching or the plane suddenly descending a few feet wouldn't have surprised him, seeing as there was a rock dropping down from his heart. So no family; not of his own, anyways, only in a greater sense. And the flight attendant was sure that if there had been family, the other man would have talked about them and not his brother and his brother's girlfriend.
It was only when they pulled back and looked each other deep in the eyes that the flight attendant realized that all this was, indeed, too good to be true. He was fooling himself.
, wasn't there?
"Jo..."
"I'd love to," the other man said, and Cas wasted no time to fumble for his key card. If only his tongue had had some bravery to spare for his shaking hands.
ways to find out if he is interested," the older man teased, earning himself a withering stare.
A shower washed off the remnants of chlorine clinging to his skin, making Castiel feel refreshed, but also pleasantly tired when he crawled into his bed afterwards. He fell asleep immediately.
Preparation and even arousal forgotten for the moment, Cas leaned forward and kissed his lover, deeply and lovingly, and the response met what he was giving, free of rush and passion, just the relish of a gesture that said a lot more than they were yet willing to express in words, or even conscious of.
He wouldn't look back though. He'd deal with it, somehow, and he'd try his best to see the good in this - the night, the intimacy, the moments no one would ever be able to take from him.
Oh, who was he kidding.
"They offer childcare services."
Balthazar didn't try to talk to him again this evening. He left him alone, and Castiel was more than grateful. When they met the next morning for breakfast, no words were lost about the events of the past evening.
"Have to know who the water goes to?" the passenger winked and took another sip, which was followed by a relieved sigh that, for some reason, had the flight attendant bite his lip.
"You said that already."
"Have you
"I always assumed they're there to remind us how fleeting and precious life is. To protect us from being stupid and heedless."
Still his job also met with his preference for keeping his distance from strangers, tending to them only as part of his work, but not having to engage emotionally, personally. Life had made him shy, vulnerable to things that were out to hurt him - to people pretending out of politeness, but neglecting later on when they believed their obligation of pleasantness was fulfilled.
"He's right, Dean," his brother chimed in, unhelpfully as always, "there's no reason why you should be in pain," and here at least Sam winced in sympathy before continuing, "when Cas can help you."
So Dean did what he had to do.
"Well, haven't you fixed it, yet?!" With a deep breath Castiel kept as inaudible as possible he collected inner strength he was sure he would still need, before he replied,
Yet... that wasn't all.
If he asked his heart, he had no idea what to do. There were a lot of wrongs and no right.
What followed for Dean were a torturing long twenty minutes in which he paced back and forth in the small one-room apartment he was renting in Detroit. That there wasn't a hole in the carpet when his phone finally rung again surprised him immensely.
"Not sure. For now we had to cut our meeting short, because of the concert today."
these people as such; but at least there was a familiarity to the crowd.
Breakfast didn't take him long; he went for a continental one, not in the mood for warm food except for one egg, and ate his two slices of bread with jam and cheese quickly. As he had promised the hotel employee welcomed him back with a sheet of paper in his hand.
"I must apologize, it sounded like you were talking about your wife and son, and I assumed that you'd have... I'm really very sorry, Mr. Winchester--"
And it was missing.
"Well, how you made of fly boy here relationship material."
Entirely robbed of his ability to speak by fear and awe, all he could hope was that his wide-eyed stare helped communicate what he wanted. Certainly the depth in those sapphire blues of the other man had to hold some mind-reading capabilities.
When he'd received news that there had been a change of plans and he wouldn't be needed to work at the office this week, Dean hadn't hesitated even one second. How could he, with the prospect of seeing Cas, and even if it was only for a short time? By taking the first flight on this Saturday morning he made sure that he'd arrive as early as possible back in San Francisco, and there'd be many hours to spend with his lover before Sunday noon.
"Yeah, thanks. Spare me the details." Lucky for Castiel, he was indeed spared then, as right in that moment the barkeeper returned with their drinks.
Perhaps he was putting on a brave face. Perhaps he was fooling himself. But honestly, what else was there to do?
"But that's unfair. And selfish. This is your dream job. Who am I to expect you to be here with me when you can be out there, seeing the world, and do what you love. I'm sorry, Cas, this is stupid of me. I should probably hang up before I make even more of an idiot--" The door bell ringing made Dean halt in his words, and confused he looked up. It was ten in the evening, who the hell could that be? "Cas, give me a sec, there's someone at the door." While the phone was still pressed to his ear, he didn't notice that there came no reply from the other end, too focused on his late-night visitor.
"Yeah, maybe... if only they didn't also stop us from doing things would enjoy and that would do us good."
"Alright," Balthazar gave in, "We have talked about this, Cassie. You know my opinion. I will continue to believe you're stupid if you let that chance pass, but... there you are. Do whatever you think is right, even though it isn't." After he had finished, Balt nudged the man beside him with his elbow, who groaned unhappily.
"I want you inside me," his lover growled into his ear, and Castiel's breath hitched. How could he...? He hadn't...? "Have you ever topped, Cas?" When he shook his head, he found Dean leaning back and looking down at him. "Don't worry. I'll show you. You'll love it."
like him."
His parents -- well, he could see them anytime. Bobby was there, and everyone else - Jody, Donna, Claire, their hunter friends, their extended family that never ended in blood - would follow, when they had hopefully lived their lives to the fullest on Earth.
Dean hummed in agreement. "Want me to fetch the papers as well?"
The time to board the plane took much too long to arrive, and out of curious mixture of anxiousness and boredom, he almost ordered a whole family menu at the burger place next to the waiting area, but could, at the last minute, stop himself. Instead, he got a salad - Sammy would have been so proud - and a chocolate chip cookie sundae and forced himself to eat slowly and concentrate on his food in hopes it would distract him. It helped only so much.
"You know I am afraid of flying, but... what are you afraid of?"
Only a few times he moved his hand back and forth, feeling the loosened muscles around his fingers and deciding that Dean was indeed, as he had claimed earlier, ready.
"Have you ever...?"
"Cassie." There was something patronizing in Balt's voice that made Castiel want to strangle him. "That guy has it as bad for you as you have it for him. Just
"I don't intend to."
"There's this bar I discovered the last time we were here. Nice people, good music, pretty barkeeper. Just the place you need right now."
"Healing you," he said, slowly, his voice monotone, apparently so it would be easier to keep focus on the words.
"Looking forward to it," Dean winked and threw in a boyish smile - for good measure it seemed - and Castiel was sure that no deeper shade of red existed than what had to color his face in that moment.
, to them just once - that was new. New and surprising and scary - and still intriguing.
It never came. Save for a mumbled, "of course, what was I thinking," his friend just sighed and took another sip of his wine, all the while watching Cas intently over the rim of his glass. And Castiel knew that look. The one that indicated Balthazar was about to say something he wouldn't like.
"I see. I apologize should I have insulted you."
"Jessica, are you pregnant?" Castiel didn't even need a verbal answer then. The woman's reaction, scrunching up her face and inclining her head, was more than enough. "I am absolutely sure that Sam will be delighted. He loves you, Jess. I'm anything but an expert on human relationships and interactions," at that, Jessica laughed lightly, but Cas didn't allow himself to let himself be distracted by it, "but it doesn't take much to see that Sam loves you very much and will be more than happy to have a family with you. Also, aren't you engaged already?"
"Mine yes, but not Mary's," he gave back, eventually arriving at the bathroom door and carefully peaking in, a fond expression on his face as he watched his partner and their little seven month old baby girl they had adopted a few weeks ago.
Driving the empty road in Baby, relishing in the freedom of going wherever and whenever he wanted, no hunts ahead, no lives to save, to responsibilities to fulfill.
But Castiel knew that the last word hadn't been spoken in this. Balthazar had found something to poke into - and since it was his friend's mostly non-existent love life, Cas bet on the blond-haired flight attendant of British descent who lacked so much of the island inhabitants' decency picking up the conversation again as soon as possible. Even if there was not much to talk about.
And there it was. The brick that slammed into Dean. A whole brick
And that was when Castiel stopped Dean and his admittedly somewhat adorable rambling the best way he knew: He kissed his lover. Kissed him deeply and without hurry, a gesture that held all his relief and happiness, and everything else he was feeling, but couldn't and didn't want to define.
Having one-nighters had been fun once; now they weighed on him, told him of the things he didn't have. Like a real home. Or a family. Someone to come home to, someone he could be himself with, someone he wouldn't have to put all energy into to charm and win over. He may have been good at it, but that didn't mean it was free of any effort.
"Nice to meet you, Dean. So given that we're both lonely... we should probably accidentally run into each other," the dark-haired woman suggested, nudging his shoulder with hers, "and then hopefully land on something soft and bouncing when we fall."
Morning came and with it well-trained ignorance that was applied to all things two people living together in permanent close quarters couldn't afford to get too agitated over. The choice for having breakfast at a nearby diner was made wordlessly between the brothers, as was the decision to get back on the road immediately after their morning meal.
"Balthazar!" a familiar voice suddenly hissed from behind the blond man, and when Dean turned his head, he saw Castiel, who smiled at him apologetically. The passenger just shook his head at him, a grim smile on his face, hoping that it was enough to show Castiel that it was okay. Dean was surely not bothered by such comments. And, ever since he had time to reflect on that situation with Balthazar and Gabriel on Monday, he had also begun to understand the two of them and their protectiveness, even if he still thought it was somewhat misplaced. But, apparently they truly cared about Cas, and for the moment, that was all he needed to know. Even more so because he very much shared the sentiment.
"There you go. And... if you want anything else - my shift ends in an hour," he commented, once more only looking at Castiel. "I mean, of course, it'd be good if you have
"Cas? You still with me, babe?"
"Good morning, Yanny. On weekend shift again?" he greeted the hotel employee manning the reception when he came down for breakfast.
"You know what, I can't watch this anymore," Gabriel all of a sudden announced, and though he should have known better, Cas was about to let out a sigh of relief. That was until he heard the chief say, "come on, Balthazar, we gotta do something," and vanished through the curtain, closely followed by his colleague.
"If you're asking about what Sam's reaction would be to such a... thing or... event, I believe I'm the wrong person to ask. As you are aware, I only met Sam this evening."
"All right. Dean." If his smile was a bit happier and brighter than it should have been in that moment Castiel accepted it as such and didn't give it any further thought. After all, they were supposed to always be open and honest with their passengers.
Because his instinct didn't just make him grab Cas' arm to hold him fast and stop him.
Castiel had a broken heart, but not because he mourned his bad decisions - but because this one night had been so perfect that he wanted to experience it again, and he wouldn't be able to. He was angry and sad that fate denied him this little bit of happiness.
He picked a small restaurant to have lunch at, and mourned the missed opportunity of a walk along the pier - because he certainly didn't want to be outside any more than necessary right now, not when even an umbrella wasn't of much help to keep one dry. And anyways, what use was a walk when one had to do it alone?
"It'll be easier this way," he said by way of an explanation and waggled his eyebrows, making Castiel, now once again under the scrutiny of his lover, blush and smile shyly. It had been somewhat easier when Dean had still been above him and Cas had the chance to either kiss him or hide his face in the other man's neck. At the end of the day, he
"I don't believe I know what you mean."
"Believe me, darling, we'll make it work. Just tell me wha--"
And kept hoping, week after week, flight after flight, that one of these days something would come along and make flying easier and more comfortable for his strained nerves.
He would fly past big cities and small villages, over forests and deserts, along rivers and across oceans - heading for whatever was out there, still awaited him, searching for something he didn't yet know he was looking for.
"You bet we will. Monday at the latest."
"Him. See
Castiel didn't remain long on his partner's mouth with his and instead took up a path down neck and over shoulders, as far as their position allowed, and then a bit further when he released Dean from his grip and used his now free hands to nudge the other man a bit higher so he was able to reach his pectorals and the little hard nubs in the middle of them. The effort it took to meet Dean's nipples with his tongue was rewarded when the other man gasped and shivered, crawling up even further so Cas had easier access.
And indeed he was lucky, finding the other man standing next to the exit, all alone, his colleagues apparently already busy cleaning up.
"Cas, what's up? Something has happened, hasn't it? Where are you?" Another pause, then a sigh. And it hit Dean what the answer would be before the other man replied.
The kiss ended too soon for Cas's liking, and was followed by Dean's, "You can't hurt me. Trust me," before his partner pulled back and once more reached down the side of the bed and into his duffel. He rummaged a moment through his stuff, then came back up, a familiar looking bottle in his hand.
The advantage to such flights was that they had regulars. Business men and women, or commuters returning to their workplace for the week. Castiel liked having around known faces, even if he didn't
"It's not really like that; the debriefings oftentimes are useful. They just tend to be at inconvenient times... like when you know a very charming, handsome man is waiting for you in a secret garden and you can't leave to go to him right away."
No one there.
This evening, much to Castiel's relief, it was rather empty. He nevertheless chose a table in one of the corners, where new arrivals wouldn't spot them right away. He needed to have that conversation with Balthazar, and he needed it have it alone.
He had this dream often. This dream where even within it, he felt like he was past conscious thought and had escaped into a fantasy realm. A dream he clung to, even after waking up and finding himself back on the ground, where nothing felt light, or easy.
To his embarrassment it took Castiel several seconds - or maybe it were even minutes? - before he was able to react.
"Because you gotta know, Cas, he never was before."
"So Jack did all that?" Dean wanted to confirm, already feeling his chest fill with pride. He was indeed
Much later Dean finally got to explain why exactly he had left.
"Dean," he replied, and though he was still aiming his most winning smile at her, he noticed himself moving away a bit, the proximity suddenly strangely uncomfortable. As was the hand landing on his knee.
As Bobby vanished around the corner of the building, Dean took a deep breath and rose from his chair. He hadn't forgotten these faithful moments of watching a certain someone working at that gas stop, missing him, trying to convince him that he needed to come back to them. To
his favorite colleague's eyeroll over the phone.
Was he in love with someone he bought breakfast for? Invited into his home? Spent his weekends with? Talked to on the phone for hours? Introduced to those very few people he held so dear to his heart that he never once before had let any of his conquests meet them? That he hadn't even told those others who had shared his bed for a night or sometimes two that there were people he considered family?
His thoughts must have shown - in the fear he surely expressed - because his lover suddenly stepped right in front of it and framed his face with his hands, making Castiel look at him.
"Your point, Gabe?"
"No, I--"
"No, I'm still at your apartment building."
made him notice her in the first place. By talking to him.
"Told ya," Gabriel commented around a lollipop from a few feet away.
"That's not how you should think. Whatever we can offer each other will be fine. First and foremost, we have each other, and that is what counts most. Even if it doesn't involve phone sex." The last sentence was said with a wink, and once again Castiel blushed, but also smiled shyly at his lover.
"You seemed quite cozy just then, holding hands and all," now Balthazar chipped in, coming into sight beside him with his arms crossed.
- worrying became the theme of the moment: His teeth worried his lip, his fingers the innocent armrest, his booths the rough carpet in front of his seat, and his mind in general himself. He really didn't care how ridiculous he looked in that moment, lips sucked into this mouth and eyes screwed shut; he just wanted it to end.
As of this moment, Castiel had entered his personal hell, and he had done it blindly yet willingly. This one time his gut feeling let him down - or this one time he maybe hadn't listened properly - he had walked right into this cruel trap feelings awaited with; had let himself be lured in and readily embraced his heart's doom.
Unbeknownst to him, despite their one and a half star haven in sight Sam was in for a lot more Grumpy Dean. Grumpy I'm-very-manly-and-don't-feel-pain-even-if-I'm-winding-in-it Dean who didn't want any help.
"I handed my letter of resignation to my boss this morning."
"I... his name's Castiel..." When Dean trailed off yet again and remained silent for another few seconds, the receptionist narrowed his eyes at him.
Dean Winchester had endured many injuries in his life since he became a hunter. He had been beaten, cut, stabbed, burned, scratched, flung against walls and trees and cars, hell, he had been
Right then, Castiel was sure he was able to hear the penny drop. Because it reached the ground with a clearly audible 'pling' before all hell broke loose.
"I... actually I..."
A thought occurred to Dean then; maybe they couldn't be together right now, but that didn't mean that he couldn't at least try and relax his lover a bit.
For once, boarding the plane was almost easy. True, the take-off was still made in hell, as was the landing later on, but the rest was actually quite fine. Maybe it came from his mind being so occupied with what he'd do in a short time. Who he would see in just a few hours.
Castiel's and Balthazar's relationship - or was it affair? - had been moderately short and excessively intense, but free of true emotions, of feelings beyond friendly affection. It had lacked everything Castiel longed, but didn't dare to hope for. The reason he had gotten involved with the man he was happy to now call his friend had been simple convenience - he had only just accepted his preference for men and decided to finally act on it. Balt had been a decent enough candidate - charming, witty, easy on the eyes, and an epitome of self-confidence - to affirm himself, and to give in to his body's desires.
A low moan was his response, and confirmation that obviously, he was doing it right. He did his best to remember everything he had ever experienced himself and read about it, intent on making this perfect for Dean. His finger he thrust in and out a few times, a slow movement he felt no need to rush, no matter what his lover demanded. Only after several moments he sought out that one particular spot inside Dean - the one that left the man release a strangled gasp.
The End?
"I received a job offer. Intercontinental flights."
"Every angel has been assigned a section of Heaven. This is mine. We are to assure that everything is peaceful. Now that the walls are down and no one's mind is manipulated anymore, but everyone can be themselves, it is not without reason to assume that one or the other conflict could arise. Humans tend to be a bit... quarrelsome at times, even in Heaven."
The decision to take in a new family member, provide home to a little being that didn't have a proper one and give it warmth and love all the while giving themselves what was cream on top of their happiness Dean and Castiel had found with each other had been easily made. The adoption process had been an a little bit nerve-wrecking one, but it had only affirmed both men in their choice, even more so when they were rewarded in ways they could never have hoped for. Their daughter was the light of their life, adding loads to the joy they already felt by just being together.
"Are you... are you sure? Do you mean...?"
A rare thing as it was - this was apparently one of the very few times Castiel's tongue conspired with some secret decision making fraction of his brain. Both of which were living off a much bigger reserve of braveness than he was.
"Look at that," Gabriel growled and shook his head as he stood behind the half-closed curtain of the galley and watched the passengers. Or, in that case, two particular passengers. "I don't believe it. What a--"
Castiel Shurley did this job because he loved flying. He did it because he wanted to be above the clouds as often as possible, all the while he relished in the chance of sharing his joy and contentment in an environment that didn't hold any danger to his heart and soul.
And nothing would ever be able to replace the
been worse. And, at least, amongst all the bad, there had been good. Still was.
"So..."
"I admit I worried about the same." And wasn't that enough to make Dean laugh.
"Whatever happens, Cas, whatever you worry about or keeps you from doing something, or enjoying something, you have to let me know, okay? I'm glad you told me this, but next time, do it right away. This is for us both to have a good time, and it's of no use when it keeps you awake half the night. I want you to feel happy, not miserable." Castiel nodded and was quick to meet Dean when he leaned forward to kiss him, exchanging a slow, loving kiss free of any rush or even passion. It was the kind of affectionate gesture he enjoyed most, maybe even more than any good lovemaking or orgasm; because it went so much deeper and kept his hope that this could be more than two people taking pleasure in each other for a limited time alive.
