“Yeah, sure,” he says instead, and pushes himself up to sitting. Wiping a hand down his face reminds him he needs to shave, which in turn reminds him what a fucking mess he must look like. “Go ahead. I’ll catch up with you.”
“I don’t know,” Cas says at last. “I don’t think I ever have been.”
“Dude,” Dean says weakly.
“Shut up,” Dean said weakly.
Dean grabs the screwdriver and hands it to him, numb. “One foot out the door already, is that it?”
“Goodnight, Sam,” Cas called out to him, looking up from the dish he was drying. Sam’s reply came through yet another yawn.
Cas’s hand strokes back until the warm weight of it is resting right on the crown of Dean’s head. His fingers sink into his hair. He’s so close that Dean can feel the faint trickle of grace shiver-slide down Cas’s leg to coil up around his ankle, fever-hot for a second against the back of Dean’s hand before the grace and the swelling retreat all at once.
They’d taken the time to dust salt beneath the floorboards before starting to install new ones, and Cas said a prayer with his hands pressed flat to the foundation, biblical Hebrew rolling out of his mouth with ease. Every language sounds like his mother tongue. Dean is well-used to catching bits of Aramaic or ancient Greek muttered with the same gravitas with which Cas weighs his words in English, even if he’s always held them a little strangely in the mouth no matter the language. Dean wonders sometimes if Cas has ever really gotten used to speaking out loud, to breathing.
Jack looks at him, his eyes begging Dean to be proud of the choice he made. Dean is terrified by what this means, the same way he’s always terrified by change, these enormous sweeping changes that operate on a cosmic playing field he will never fully comprehend. Jack was God. Now he’s here, and he still wants Dean’s approval.
Dean had paced his room and snapped at Sam when he couldn’t take it anymore, demanding, “When the hell is he gonna say what he really thinks?”
They pick out a bed frame without a hitch — there aren’t too many to choose from that fit the room specs — but they stall out at the bookcases, Cas paralyzed by options.
Forget-me-nots are beginning to overflow the area Cas marked for them. Queen Anne’s Lace bursts up through the blooms every once in a while, contributing to the cascade, followed by snapdragons of every color. Those are new. Cas angrily planted them while Dean was at the bar. Behind them are nasturtium, all the more orange for the mess of herbs asserting themselves in patches to interrupt the blossoms, then the bluebells, and then Cas’s love, rotting on the vine.
Cas disappears to hunt down whatever odd things he wants, so Dean goes through the motions of checking off his list. Eggs, milk, ground beef for chili, cans of beans and corn and the weird strawberry applesauce Cas likes. A pack of oreos, just because. Potatoes and carrots for stew, and that means onions and garlic as well, Dean already plotting out the coming week’s meals, smiling as he tosses bread and peanut butter to his cart. Cas liked that when he was human, right? PB&J?
Dean’s heart gives a little lurch at the thought. He isn’t Cas’s minder, and he knows this. If he has been
What the hell kind of question was that? Dean shot him a look. “Dude.”
“I’m okay,” he said firmly. “You wanna watch
Cas’s knee is still bloodied, though, there’s a streak of it sticky-hot against Dean’s cheek — and then there’s Cas’s thumb, wiping it off —
“Cas,” Dean said again, more purposeful. Cas’s shaky sigh before he took Dean in his mouth again made Dean feel a wrenching, possessive tug in his gut. Who was he to nickname an angel like he thought he belonged to him or something, anyway? Like he had any claim to him at all?
Dean groaned low in the back of his throat. “What’s your problem
“Just humor me.” Dean flashes teeth as he grins. “You’ll like it.”
Cas pushes his knee up, just barely pressing it into the cup of Dean’s hand. The words come out halfway between dazzled and thunderstruck when he says, “You never fail to surprise me, Dean Winchester.”
He grabs Cas’s hand, and the second he does, thunder rattles the heavens like it’s trying to knock the clouds right out of the sky. Glowing streaks zip up Cas’s arm in splintery fractals, a Lichtenburg of white gold that spiderwebs up his whole body until it frames his face in thin threads that gild him. Cas’s head snaps back, lips parting in a gasp —
“Dean.”
The covers have become stifling, so Dean tosses them off his legs and slides out of bed before he can think too hard about it. He knows the window is locked securely. He checks it anyway. His gun is where he left it, loose in its holster, at an angle on top of the new dresser. He opens his sock drawer just to run fingertips across the tops of all his little salve and tincture labels, the box of extra bullets, the damp flask of holy water. He has everything he needs. His heart is still doing double-time in his chest anyway, useless adrenaline an oil slick in his belly.
strawberry.”
Of course Dean is concerned about it, which Cas must know. He also owes Sam enough leeway to make his own choices, which Cas must know as well. He shrugs, tapping the stubbled underside of Cas’s jaw with his thumb. “He’s a big boy, he can handle it. Sandwich, yes or no?”
“Hey, I’m not your keeper. Maybe you had plans.” Dean sips his water and wonders what the hell he’s picking a fight over. “You get Jam Guy Dexter’s number before we left?”
The hair raises on the back of Dean’s neck, a prickle of unease slithering down his spine as he glances sideways at Cas. There’s a deceptively blank look on his face that Dean knows better than to trust.
Cas’s eyes go half-lidded at the touch. “Better with practice, I can only assume.”
Cas shoved a pillow under Dean’s feet and arranged the bag of frozen peas on the most swollen part of Dean’s ankle. “You are immensely frustrating,” he told him with that same clipped tone he always used when he chewed Dean out. “You could have just asked me to heal it.”
Content warnings with mild spoilers in the end notes.
“It makes me want to ravish you thoroughly when you say things like that,” Cas murmurs in his ear.
“We might need to get you reading glasses, bud,” Dean says, tossing himself down in the seat next to him.
Dean turned his head away as best he could with Cas’s grip on his neck, breaths gone shuddery and ragged. Cas just kept it up, fucking into him with increasing desperation.
“It’s fine,” Dean says automatically. He glances at Cas, relieved to find that his knee-jerk reply is correct. It is fine. Cas was just making conversation. “Anyway. What about you, huh?”
“I have explicitly disobeyed the first instruction, which is to find an assistant,” Cas tells him. “I’m working under the assumption that the small cartoon man with no hair in the diagram is meant to represent me.”
“Hard day?” the bartender asks, like bartenders are supposed to. She’s strawberry blonde and way too young for Dean to even consider hitting on, which is a relief. He’s not in the mood.
Meanwhile, Cas is methodically dredging his vegetable empire up out of the dust.
“We don’t do anything but house renovations ‘n meal planning, we ain’t exactly saving the world these days.” He steals a glance, finds Cas’s eyes wide and pale in the gauzy light of dawn. “Look, I know everything went to shit —”
Cas is somewhere beyond words. His shoulders tremble.
Dean snaps back to gawk at him, taking in the unreadable set of Cas’s mouth.
Dean considers him for a long moment, wracking his brain to try and remember if Jimmy Novak wore glasses. “I’m still taking you to Walgreens to try on a couple pairs.”
“Yo,” Dean hisses as soon as Cas and Lilah are out of earshot. “What’s going on? Lilah said
Dean turns back to the stove and holds his phone between shoulder and ear so he can stir the pot of stew he has simmering. “Growing pains,” he answers. “It’s fine. Just don’t ask me how expensive Cas’s mattress was.”
He makes eye contact with Dean, deer in the headlights, an expression Dean hasn’t seen in a good long while.
It’s the most mundane reason any of them have gotten injured in years. Dean kneels down, hovering a hand over Cas’s swollen ankle just to feel the heat radiate out from it. Cas should have healed himself immediately. A rock shouldn’t be able to incapacitate an angel even if it’s chucked at their head, let alone sitting innocently in their path.
brain waves into the back of Dean’s skull the entire time Dean was grabbing a bag of frozen peas and wrapping them in a dish towel, and all Dean could do was huff, turning on his heel to face him.
Dean shut up.
Dean can still feel Cas’s back against his front in the lake if he thinks about it, Cas’s head leaning back on his shoulder to tell him he should have been left in the Empty.
“Dean,” Cas says, hoarse. “Why are you angry?”
“I asked you to come here,” Cas reminds him. “If you don’t mind my poor singing.”
Cas doesn’t bother opening his eyes. “Mm. To be someone’s
“Dean?” Cas asks, concerned.
“Whoa,” Dean says, blinking as Cas hops off Baby’s hood to retrieve it. “D’you get butterfingers every time someone says they love you?”
Stay tuned for the epilogue! More denouement is on the way!
Another flash of light. Now that Dean’s looking for it, he sees the shape of a man’s body knelt in the grass as it’s backlit for just a moment, arms outstretched, head tilted back. Even with just the quick glance before the light goes out, Dean can see the anguish in the chiaroscuro.
Sam rolled his eyes, but he didn’t press. He did a lot of that, Dean had noticed, and more by the week, averting his gaze so that he wouldn’t notice whatever Cas and Dean were doing. Sam was good at keeping a respectful distance when people’s lives weren’t on the line.
He loves him because Cas showed up to the barn unguarded when summoned for the first time all those years ago, his miracle-making arms at his sides, knowing full well that Dean couldn’t hurt him with his best efforts. He brought his faith to a knife fight and won. If Dean’s being honest with himself, he’s loved him ever since Cas smiled down at the blade in his chest, eyes bright and familiar, grateful for Dean’s fighting spirit. He used to think Cas was condescending — he knows now it was fondness, indulgence, and above all else, recognition.
Right before he turns away from the windows, there’s a brief flash of light just outside — is that what woke him up earlier? Dean peers out the window, looking for the source of the light, but there’s nothing but darkness for miles, the moon a thin wan slice that doesn’t illuminate much. He squints out the window, listening for thunder to accompany the lightning, and hears nothing. Just the wind whistling through the gap between the loosely-set window frame and the glass.
“Shut it,” Dean says, and catches Cas hiding a smile by turning his face away.
“You do kind of dress like a trucker,” Jade points out. “Where’s your hat?”
Cas sighs. “Never mind. You intend to keep hunting, then?”
“Having God for a son comes with some perks, I guess,” Dean says, and regrets it the second he feels Cas stiffen right up in his arms.
“At least he seems... okay?” Sam hazards. “Ish?”
“Yeah,” he says anyway, trust welling up to fill his mouth. “Yeah. Cas. Castiel.
“After Hell?”
The house keeps creaking and moaning, the sounds amplified by the hardwood floors. Dean rolls over in bed and huffs a frustrated breath into his pillow. On the other side of the wall, Dean hears blankets rustling to indicate Cas is doing the same, rocking and shifting so the bedsprings sigh. A glance at the clock tells Dean it’s 2:43 am — late enough he can’t bother Sam, too early for him to give up and call it morning.
They’re nice ones, as hands go. Not that Dean spends a lot of time staring at other dudes’ mitts to compare. But they’re well-shaped, long-fingered and broad, fingernails neatly trimmed after having gotten dirt crusted under them a time too many. They’re smooth at the palm despite how many times Dean’s asked him to bleed for a spell.
“Christ.” Dean drains half his beer in two swallows, leaving the dregs behind. He picks at one of the claw marks on the table just for something to do with his hands. “Yeah, honeymooning in Colorado, that’s the move.”
Cas’s breath hitched when Dean found a particularly good angle to stroke, although his grip was clumsy and kind of bad from how little room his arm had to maneuver. Like hell was he gonna move now, though. He had Cas whining into his neck and fucking his fist when Dean didn’t go fast enough, that was worth the wrist cramp. The weight of him pressing Dean into the mattress could’ve speared Dean through like a butterfly tacked to a corkboard, pinning him to this moment forever, and he wouldn’t have minded.
That honestly only made Dean feel worse, but Cas kept kissing him, pressing small, soft little kisses all across the backs of his shoulders like that might distract Dean from reality setting in. The worst part was that it worked. The unease in Dean’s belly fizzled out into a pleasant buzz of anticipation.
Then he does the only logical thing, and flees.
“We’re here,” Dean repeats. He blinks, then rubs his eye with the heel of his hand. “Home sweet home, eh?”
Christ, the things Dean wants. He wishes wanting them made it any easier.
Dean swallowed hard. “Yeah, I want it,” he admitted, voice strained. “I want it to hurt.”
Cas nuzzles in and makes a noncommittal noise.
“Nobody is in any danger,” Sam snaps back. “No one’s making any deals or digging up old dirt, you can unclench.”
“Dean?” Cas asks. “Sam? Are you coming inside?”
“Hanging in there?” Sam asked as he wrestled their shotguns back into the Impala’s trunk.
“Yes, because I’m likely to wander off in this state,” Cas replies, dry as a bone. At least one of them still has a sense of humor.
“You seen Cowboy Bebop?” Dean leans his hip against the other chair.
“Whatever.” Dean rolls his eyes. “Get going before the high horse you rode in on gallops off without you.”
“Don’t,” he muttered. “Don’t, or I can’t.”
“It had to go this way, y’know?” Dean rubs idly over one of the few small scars on Cas’s hand that have stuck around after healing, a little nick from his garden shears that Cas wears with pride. The satin-soft scar tissue is a fascination, on the body of a creature that was once untouchable.
the same way he isn’t thinking about Jack, or the look on Cas’s face before he died again, or —
Cas cradles the back of his head with a hum. “No. That was you.”
If Dean didn’t open his eyes in time to watch it happen, he wouldn’t believe it. But as Cas prays, working his mouth around the biblical Hebrew so foreign and so familiar it makes goosebumps break out down the backs of Dean’s arms, the head of every flower in the garden slowly turns to face him.
Dean isn’t ready to bury his gun yet, but he likes the thought of having something to tend, something living that will need him.
Cas squeezes his hand again. “I never doubted, Dean.”
“Always with the sneaking,” Dean snapped, and grabbed a bag of spring mix that had, as instructed, little dumb spinach leaves. “You’re gonna give me a heart attack one of these days.”
Dean spends a couple long seconds just watching him breathe. The swell and shift of his body under his shirt is impossible to look away from, the sweep of his shoulder to his bent elbow, the vulnerable nape of his neck. The first three fingers of the scar Dean left on him, pushing up above the stretched-out collar of a shirt Dean’s hung onto since he was twenty. If someone had told him then that in two decades an angel would be sleeping in his The Cure tee...
Dean’s face threatened to crumple, mouth twisting up. Cas seemed to sense the breaking point right before Dean did, concern washing over him, and a moment later was ready to catch Dean up in his arms the second that he started making terrible animal noises and needed to shove his face as deep into the crook of Cas’s neck as he was able.
He hopes it works. The haunted look in Cas’s eyes makes him feel funny on the inside, like a charley horse in his goddamn chest, and there isn’t much in the world he wouldn’t do if he knew it’d make Cas stop looking like that. So he’ll put hunting on the back burner for a month or two, regroup from defeating God — they’ve earned that, he thinks. He’ll fix up the lake house and keep an eye on Cas and maybe by the end of it he’ll even be able to string more than three hours of sleep together at a time.
“I know,” Dean interrupted. Whatever Cas was going to say, he didn’t want to hear it. He put his elbows down on either side of Cas’s head, nudging his nose against his jaw. “I gotcha. I get it.”
Dean thinks, remembering the first moment he ever lay hand on the front door. They are. They’re good. They have a strong foundation, a sturdy one, upon which they can build.
“Damn, am I in the doghouse? What’d I do this time?” he asked, shooting Cas a crooked grin that was not returned. If anything, it only made the harsh lines of Cas’s frown deepen, blue eyes eerie-pale with suppressed grace.
“A couple things before you guys come inside,” Sam says. He looks like shit, dark circles eating purple shadows all the way down to the cheekbone. “Remember what I said about redecorating?”
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Dean asks, taken aback.
He passes Dean and strides down the hall. Dean is still standing right where Sam left him when Cas reemerges from the kitchen with Lilah still on his hip, a plate in his free hand, Lilah holding one of the sandwich triangles in a death grip. She takes a huge bite.
Outside, the first few drops of rain begin to fall.
“Don’t make it weird,” Dean mutters, arm around Cas’s waist to pull him in.
He avoided the danger spots without Dean having to show him a single one. How the fuck he knew what they were when even Dean was caught off guard sometimes by his own body was beyond him, but he wasn’t going to fight it, not with Cas skimming a hand up under his shirt so he could pull Dean away from the sink and back against him properly.
He writhes where he’s pinned, skin cracked and blackening — Dean’s mouth agape in horror, rooted where he stands —
And that they’d had a kid together. Dean glances around the room again, at the dude in the brown suit scrolling his phone, the sleeping drunk, the server who’d bused her dishes and returned to the back room some indeterminate time ago.
“I am going to give you what you deserve,” Cas promised, solemn. “Do you trust me?”
“Oh yeah?” Jade refills his shot glass after Dean empties it again. He should slow down, but she’s got a light pour, and what’s the point, anyway? He wanted to get drunk. Now he’s getting drunk. “Trouble in paradise with your buddy?”
“Exactly —"
Dean looks up at the sky. Wisps of white clouds unfurl across the heavens in thin brush strokes, clear and sunny blue as if it hadn’t raged a storm all night long, rain turning into hail that beat the ground with birdshot. If he were a different kind of man, this is where he might open his mouth to call out for his son. But he has no idea what he’d say, and no real claim to a kid he’d held at arm’s length for as long as he could, only realizing too late the burden of the family legacy he’d draped across his small shoulders.
Cas was looking up at his face as he bent forward. Dean groaned, leaning back on one hand while his other rose to tangle in Cas’s hair. So damn soft — it was such a human thing to care about, keeping his hair clean and nice, and Dean felt a wave of hysteria threaten to crowd up his throat at the idea that Cas was trying to keep himself good to touch for Dean’s benefit. He’d certainly been a little more ragged at the edges before they started fucking.
Dean’s stomach swooped. People weren’t supposed to
He falls asleep still thinking about it. It’s easier to sink deeper than sleep’s topsoil, now he knows for sure that Cas still came back.
“Keep watch for a bit,” Dean mutters, shoving himself up to standing again.
Jamie smiles brightly. “You’re in luck, the whole store is currently on sale —”
“Do you intend to join me, or just stare?” Cas murmurs, voice a thin knife that slices through the quiet.
- Dean drives drunk. The narrative doesn't condone him for this, but it doesn't linger on it either.
Cas’s eyes widened. His grip on Dean’s neck loosened, but he left it there, lying flat over his throat. “Is that was this is?” His fingertips traced carefully over the hickeys, so gentle after the harsh way he’d sucked them into Dean’s skin. “You think you deserve this?”
Dean’s ears start ringing, faint at first, then growing louder. His mouth tastes like copper, and static makes the edges of his vision go fuzzy and vague.
“My kind has wrestled your kind since the dawn of man,” Cas replies dryly. “I believe I have an edge.”
Dean thinks, but manages to catch it before it tumbles out of his mouth. Score one for Winchester. Usually he just says the dumb shit before he can think twice. What would he know about Cas’s self-control, anyway? There isn’t another creature on planet Earth with his patience.
Dean buckles himself in and tries to relax, sighing as he stretches his legs as far as the bench seat will allow. Cas is shorter than him and drives like a grandma, Dean is shoved up close to the dashboard. Better safe than sorry, though, with Baby. Dean will suffer the leg cramp, even if he’s gonna have to tease Cas for driving all hunched over the steering wheel like he needs bifocals.
“Emphasis on creature, I suppose,” Cas says. Dean laughs.
He’s right, but Dean hates it. “Finish it, then,” he growls.
“He lost his kid pretty recently,” he says after a long beat. “My, uh. My buddy Cas. I helped out some, he was pretty much — y’know. Kid was basically my kid, too.”
“I don’t wanna hear it,” Dean says, and pulls out of the parking space again.
Dean is sitting on the floor with his back to the hallway wall, arms on his bent knees, and glances up at Sam. He nods.
“Why sunflowers?”
“You heal me with two fingertips,” Dean blurts out.
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean says. He looks away again before Sam can see his wet eyelashes. “Save it for Eileen.”
Sam is there a second later, front door slamming closed behind him, and Dean can’t muster up the energy to do much more than wave him off when Sam tries to ask if he’s okay. He spits one last time into the dirt, wipes his mouth with the back of his hand, and makes himself stand upright. He’s going to last maybe two minutes before he has to go inside and brush his teeth, but the cool air outside feels good while he can stand the bad taste in his mouth, even with Sam’s eyes boring holes into the back of his head.
Dean listens to Sam hang up on him and lowers his phone, both wrists leaned up against the edge of the sink now. His heart is racing in his chest, and he still wants to rush outside and throw himself into his car to chase down his brother, Sam’s reassurances be damned.
“Regardless,” Cas says. “I don’t intend to lose control like that again.”
God help him, Dean did. He did do that. He swallows as he hesitates, mouth cotton-dry, and then shakes his head sharply to clear it.
Sore, Dean decides as he steps back into the house and stretches his arms above his head. And a little hungry. He puts a piece of bread in the toaster and glances outside, hoping to catch a glimpse of Cas in the garden, to no avail. The late afternoon is melting on the horizon like a pat of butter, soaking into the ground, puddling on the lake in ripples. Dean considers the groceries he’s got in the fridge, thinking idly what he could make for dinner, what he could reasonably convince Cas to eat with him.
Cas stiffens when they park in front of the Bunker. “There are new wards up,” he announces grimly, opening the car door with no further preamble. Dean’s queasy stomach doesn’t prevent him from following, though it tries its damnedest, roiling its displeasure as he retrieves the bags from the backseat.
“Where are you going?” Cas asks.
“New in town?” the bartender asks. “Don’t think I’ve seen you around before.”
Cas didn’t let up, though. Overwhelmed, overstimulated, muscles of his thighs jumping, Dean writhed under Cas’s mouth, eyes stinging. Every time he looked down, Cas was looking back up at him, gaze hot and searching. Dean didn’t know what he was looking for, so he didn’t know how to hide it.
"Eileen and Jody are coming back soon," Dean says, feeling selfish and small and yes, goddamn it, homesick. "Cas. You wanna go home?"
“Look.” Dean doesn’t have to see him to know Sam’s pinching the bridge of his nose between forefinger and thumb. “I don't wanna explain it over the phone. Can you get to the bunker by tomorrow?”
Cas rolls onto his side and starts explaining all the stuff he set up in the room, Jack hanging on his every word. Dean’s cheeks hurt from smiling. In a moment, he and Cas will take Jack inside and show him the house, give him the grand tour, and afterward he’ll sit both his angels down in the kitchen so he can make them breakfast. They’ll call Sam and decide who’s driving to meet who, and Jack will get swept up into yet another embrace that’ll drag him all the way onto his tiptoes.
Dean snorts and lies back, folding an arm behind his head to cushion it. “Thought you angels were meant to be a choir, dude.”
“If you’re gonna use it, you can't just use it on me.”
Cas raised skeptical eyes to meet his.
“Dean.” Cas looked slightly pained, if a little disappointed. His anger was still there, simmering under the surface, but his eyes were kind. “Be
“You were scared, huh,” he says, tightening and relaxing his fist on purpose. “You were scared of me.” He breathes in and out, jaw clicking like a pistol cocking when he swallows. “Like dad.”
“Is he talking about Jack yet?” Sam asks, leaning against the side of the car.
“Alright, alright. Hey, Cas is a billion years old, you should’ve tried to get a senior discount.”
“Y’know, Eileen and Jody will be back soon,” Sam says. He thumbs over to the next picture, which is a blurry shot of a cereal brand Cas wanted Dean to remember he likes. “You guys don’t have to stick around.”
“What?” Cas demands. “We just got here.”
The words stumble off his tongue and the world doesn’t end. Cas drops the thermos again. Dean’s expecting the armful of angel that lurches into him, knees parting to allow Cas to fall into his embrace, and is immediately engulfed by warmth as Cas grabs him tight.
“Didn’t I just say that?”
like the sound of that. He balks, and it must show on his face, because Cas’s hand is suddenly on his arm, squeezing. “Would you give us a moment?” he asks, polite as ever. “This is a decision best made as a team.”
Dean wouldn’t have been surprised if the windows started rattling in their frames the way they had when Cas had tried to talk to him the first time. He swallowed hard, helpless, and couldn’t answer; Cas’s eyes flashed again, gone green as a thunderstorm in hurricane season.
The porch is only a little wonky when Dean lays down the last board. The railing is the most obviously messed up part, uneven in places, some of the slats a quarter of an inch out of alignment. The banister is solid, though, and can stand to be leaned against — Dean spends a whole afternoon leaned up against it, grinning to himself between sips of what he thinks is a
Dean considers this. “If the weather forecast’s right, it’s gonna be a hot one. Wanna actually check out the lake?”
They spend a day and a half longer at the bunker, just to make sure Sam isn’t talking out of his ass when he says he’s got it handled. Dean doesn’t know what he’s expecting, even still; for an evil glint to appear in Zippy’s eye, maybe, for her to show her fangs outside of when she loses at Mario Kart.
In the morning, Dean tramps out to the garage to see if the paint is still tacky. To his surprise, the warm night must have helped it along, because it’s dry to the touch — that means it’s ready for Dean to grab his drill to screw all the pieces together, which he enjoys. He puts the frames in their corresponding supers and then stacks the boxes on top of the base, careful to insert the queen excluder and entrance reducer as he goes. He’s pretty pleased with himself by the time he gets to placing the lid on top.
“C’mon, I gotcha,” Dean muttered, nudging Cas’s cheek with his nose. “I gotcha.”
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas said with his usual solemnity.
Cas sucked, gently, and Dean came with a gasp.
“That sounds complicated,” Jade says.
Cas stares at him, obviously trying to work out where this is going. “Fine,” he says at last. “Who are you?”
“I thought you didn’t sleep,” Dean says.
“You were supposed to check in yesterday, I was just about ready to send out the search party,” Dean tells him, ruffling Cas’s hair absentmindedly with a still-damp hand. “What’s up?”
Dean blinks. “The hell is the mild answer?”
“I’m not — hurting myself —” Dean tried, but Cas was pressing a palm to his stomach and he cried out, pain white-hot. “
If Cas minds the change in subject, he doesn’t let on. “I suppose you’ll want back what’s yours eventually,” he agrees.
Baby appreciates the attention, anyway, Dean’s been neglecting her since the move — aside from grocery runs or trips to the hardware store, there hasn’t been much need to go anywhere. Dean looks down at his hands, smeared with grease and braced on the rim of the open hood. When was the last time they held a gun, aside from the process of moving a few choice weapons into the new house? When was the last time he’d stayed so long in one place? Even living in the bunker, he’d floated from case to case with his usual transience, never anchored to anything, aside from whatever place Sam was. He flexes his left hand, remembers the way Cas’s skin felt, wet from the lake and warm from living. It’s impossible to look at his hands anymore and not think about Cas, after the marks he made on him.
Cas’s own bedroom is only furnished with the things Dean twisted his arm to purchase, and a handful of knickknacks he’s accumulated over the years. A couple of Dean’s shirts mixed in with his laundry. Bare walls, clean desk. The hell is he doing with another room?
The angel’s still at his back. Some things never change. Dean turns around and bites back a smile when he sees Cas, who’s wearing black swim trunks and, endearingly, a t-shirt.
Dean thinks, then shakes his head to clear it. Cas hasn’t asked for anything since they moved in, and he doesn’t know what it means, that this is the first thing. All he can think is that the word ‘cultivating’ implies a certain level of commitment to sticking in one place that he isn’t used to getting from Cas.
“Good.” Cas sounds wrecked. “Good. I want to watch you orgasm.”
Dean snorts a reluctant laugh. Nobody does deadpan like Cas. “So I get nightmares, dude. You’re a smart guy, and you saw this one. Do the math.”
“Are you real?” he asks. When he glances up again, he’s only a little surprised to see that Cas has joined him, suit pant legs rolled up to the knees so they won’t get wet as he dips his own toes in. “The real Cas, I mean.”
Cas’s fingertips are nimble as they tie twine around a small bundle of herbs. “Yes,” he says. “Do you?”
Cas just tips his head back, looking up at the vast cacophony of stars that are just beginning to peek out through the darkness in pin pricks, so much more visible out here than they are on the road. It’s difficult to read Cas’s face, illuminated only by the spillover from the kitchen light and the pale gleam of the moon, and most of him is swallowed by shadow.
“It isn’t technically your money,” Cas reminds him. “If you’re using the card you got from Charlie. Although, if it’s too much to spend on me...”
Cas squints at him suspiciously. “To what end?”
“I’d rather hear it from you,” Cas says, “than take what my superiors told me at face value.”
Dean takes a second to read her name tag, since she’s bothering to engage him in conversation, and learns her name is Jade. “Month and a half,” he explains. “Buddy and I just moved in lakeside.”
Dean snorted. Cas could have done anything in the process of rebuilding Dean from the ground up, could’ve given him a real dick, could’ve swung the opposite direction and made it like Dean had never intervened on his body in the first place. That idea filled him with so much horror he could have choked on it — clawing his way out of his own grave to find he’d died after all —
Cas is inside him, and the awkward discomfort of his first entry is thawing out into an ache so exquisite that Dean’s eyes sting. Cas is inside him, and this is sex, somehow, even with tears leaking down Dean’s temples and into his ears, his hair.
“Go to sleep,” Cas replies. His cheek presses against the space between Dean’s shoulder blades. “I have this watch.”
“It’s a good bed,” Cas points out. “You helped pick it out.”
The dismissal in his voice was impossible to ignore. Sam shared a bewildered look with Dean and shook his head as if to clear it, holding out a hand. “Keys, Dean.”
Regardless, he walks Sam out to the trailer all the same, grateful to be putting a couple paces of distance between himself and Cas. He watches Sam get buckled and waits for the hysteria to hit, the way it always does when they’re separated for more than a couple days — he leans up against the driver’s side door with that anticipation of distress hovering in the back of his chest, rumbling its displeasure.
Cas heaves a very long-suffering sigh. “If you say so.”
“We’re good,” Dean interrupts. “Yeah? We’re fine.”
along to what sounds like Everlasting Light.
Cas shrugs. His head lolls back against the couch. “Some. I have no idea.”
Dean just kicks him again, closing his eyes. Cas begins the Amidah, rising to his feet to do it — his shadow falls across Dean’s face, blotting out the sun, rays of light beaming out around him every time he bows his head forward in prayer. He’s so full of shit. His voice is awesome, low and bitter-smooth around the names of the forefathers. Avraham. Yitzchak. Yaakov. Then Sarah, Rivkah, Rachel, Leah...
“Mornin’, Cas,” Dean said.
“Fuck,” he gasped as Cas kissed wetly down the side of his throat. He squirmed when Cas sucked hard over his pulse point, over the bruise that was already there. “
“You’re snooping,” Dean accused.
Tough. Dean barely drifted off to begin with, head turning itself in circles until he got dizzy. Cas is on the landing now, Dean listens to his footsteps pause right in front of his door — his heart starts beating quicker in his chest, wondering if Cas will come inside, if he wants to talk or even just lie there in the dark with their bodies barely touching. Dean could sleep like that, probably. If he could listen to Cas breathing.
That whole day is a mess of gut-wrenching moments strung together like pearls on a chain in Dean’s memory. He tries not to remember them in the rare times he can avoid it. The look on Cas's face just before he died is seared into the backs of Dean's eyes, the helpless swoop in his gut at the knowledge that he'd failed him again, as always. Sometimes at night Dean replays that final moment over and over again, Cas's bloody handprint still warm on his bicep, Cas’s face awash in prayerful bliss just before the darkness swallowed him up in covetous tendrils. Dean rarely recalls what words were exchanged.
He’d meant what he’d said to Cas earlier. This isn’t the first time he and Sam have toyed with the idea of getting a safe house somewhere. However, it’s the first time they’ve actually taken steps toward making it happen, and Dean’s not sure they ever would have gotten there without the excuse of giving Cas a nice spot to recuperate.
Dean goes on his own errand as soon as Cas gets home. He drives into town and buys pine planks and hinges at the hardware store, fasteners too, and pale blue paint. He tosses a set of horsehair brushes into the cart as well and drags it all out to the car himself once he’s paid. It’s good to have a plan, something solid he can hold onto with both hands.
“Far as I can tell, we’re in the clear,” Sam said. “Keys, Dean. You’re not driving like that.”
Dean’s silent for a while, but when he speaks up, his voice is friendly and calm: “That’s alright. We all do this sometimes. ’m just glad you warmed up to me and my amazing personality.” He sounds teasing, and when Cas dares to look at him, there’s a cheeky smile on his face.
When he looks up at his doctor while she cleans his chest with cold, sharp disinfectant, she sends him the softest smile, and the tears start to roll.
They both lose track of time, too wrapped up in each other, in lips and hands and grinding hips. Dean very quickly realizes that Cas’ hands are very,
And he’s absolutely ecstatic, he cannot wait to get rid of these drains and the pain that comes with them. He can’t wait to walk out of here, flat-chested, and feel a little more like himself. He can’t wait for the pain to lessen and the scars to heal and the bruises to fade, can’t wait to take off the binder forever.
Cas fumbles his way through opening the condom, pulling it on, and then he guides his cock down between Dean’s legs. That first push past the tight muscle and into Dean’s heat is everything, too much, and Cas drops down to put his mouth on Dean’s skin again. “So fucking good,” he mumbles into Dean’s chest, fingers spasming in the meat of Dean’s hip.
And then the relief of getting this check-up over with, Dean being a decent guy about it and the pain medication make him suddenly realize that he’s bone-tired. He leans back on his bed, buries his face in his pillow, and falls asleep faster than maybe ever.
“I, um. I need to make a call,” he announces to no one in particular. “I need to — I’ll be out back.”
But he’ll see soon, he supposes. If Cas comes out here to him, to talk, maybe…? If he stays inside and shows their friends, makes a laughing stock out of Dean, then — well, then Dean will have to live with that. Make it a joke, too. He can do that, probably.
And then, because there is no way in hell he could help it, Dean goes a little hot all over, feels a little tingly. And he definitely can’t think about why he feels this way when his best friend and roommate talks about what he likes during sex, so he just… somehow falls into a rant and millions of questions.
Dean sounds a little breathless when he sits up, looks at him and says: “Yeah?”
“Thank you,” Cas says again, and then his eyes are suddenly drawn to the gorgeous swirling tattoos on the lady’s arm. “Your tattoos,” he says, brain spinning in a world of cotton. “Gorgeous.”
“Are… are you sure? I would love to, obviously, but I don’t want to eat anything meant for someone else,” Cas stutters, feeling his cheeks burning a little.
As soon as his head is free from fabric, he finds Cas’ lips on his own again. Cas kisses him as they make their way down to his matress, Dean on his back and Cas kneeling between his thighs. When their lips part again, Dean drops his head back onto Cas’ pillow with a soft sigh.
Sarah, 29 — looks very cute with that kid in her arm, but… Nope.
“No, it… Intentional, when I did it a few weeks ago,” he says softly, looking a little bashful.
to be manhandled and bitten and roughed up a little during sex, but suddenly — suddenly he’s
He looks down with a frown that is gone again in a second, replaced by a look of wide-eyed wonder. And then he’s looking straight at Dean, right into his eyes, mouth opening as if to say something — and then closing again, at a loss of words.
until he can hold him firm and pull him back against his —
“Not really, no.”
The food is cold when they get back to it, but neither of them cares. Much. Dean complains a little, but all he demands as an excuse is more kisses after they finish their fries. And Cas is pretty okay with that.
Charlie just laughs, pushes the cupcake further into his space and says: “If you don’t take it, Dean will eat all three of them — and I’m pretty sure no doctor here would be happy about that. That boy’s diet is terrible as it is.”
They both sway a little while pulling off their boots, and once that’s done and Dean dumps his jacket on the chair by Cas’ table, he doesn’t know what to do. He finds himself watching as Cas sheds his jacket and sweater and turns around towards Dean, and then a few more very awkward seconds of staring follow.
Dean is certain he’s turning purple at this point, mouth opening and closing while the rest of him tenses like he’s been attacked. “You — worship? Over
Dean retrieves the first aid box from the bathroom and several ice packs from the freezer, pointedly ignoring the way his heart has started to thud faster with nerves, like it’s trying to smack against his ribcage every other beat. He wraps the ice packs in a hand towel to offset the cold and bustles back to find Cas lying down on the sofa completely with his arm over his eyes.
giving head. He did it with a dedication that bordered on religious.
“He’s sleeping.” Cas mouthed the words right on the topmost vertebra of Dean’s spine. “I would not let us be discovered against your will, Dean.”
Dean rolls his eyes again. “Positive attitude, dude, this is a kvetching-free zone.”
“— So this model currently goes for just over nine hundred and fifty dollars.”
Dean rolls his eyes when Sam shoots Cas an approving nod. “Just trust me,” he insists. “This is the one.”
“Prayer?” Cas asks. There’s a funny note in his voice that could be curiosity or sheer, abject surprise, Dean can’t tell.
“I would consider it less dishonest than buying trail mix and picking out all the m&ms before giving it to your brother,” Cas replied dryly. His hand came up to touch the small of Dean’s back briefly, killing whatever reply Dean was going to muster up, and then he wandered off again like it was normal.
“I understand you mean it,” Cas said. “But I don’t think it’s any better if you’re only ashamed of yourself.”
feeling jittering through him, making his skin crawl.
They’re still bickering when Sam comes down the hall with Cas’s bag in hand, a couple books tucked under his other arm. “You need anything else for the house?” he interrupts, which makes Zippy put her earbud back in and start ignoring them again.
“And what’s with that shit about what shoulda been Michael’s, huh?” Dean demands. The sick flash of anger cutting through him is a relief, after the sticky-soft anxiety from earlier coiling up in his gut. “I thought we were past that, I don’t wanna be worshipped!”
Still overdressed, though. Dean fumbled Cas’s shirt buttons open until Cas kissed him sweetly and took over, shouldering out of it with remarkable smoothness for a guy who’d been a self-confessed virgin until a week and a half ago. But Cas was a damn fast learner, Dean had begun to figure out, and he was almost impossible to embarrass, too. Bodies were still strange and new for him in general, how was learning the rules of sex any different from learning the rules of any other social interaction?
Dean takes the knapsack off Cas’s shoulder and heaves it up onto his own before Cas can do more than make a protesting sound. “I still got half a tank,” he says. “We’ll fill’er up on the way.”
“Dean,” Cas says softly, from behind him.
What the hell he gets out of a random vegetable, Dean can’t guess. Cas’s eating habits have always been impossible to predict, his tastes both odd and variable, influenced by forces Dean can’t perceive or maybe just his current whims. Dean watches Cas fiddle with his chopsticks. The flex of his wrist is a human enough gesture that it makes Dean’s chest feel funny to look at it, at the way his fingers curl.
“Just trying to guess what brings you here in the middle of a Saturday,” Jade says, shrugging. She gestures around the room with an expressive hand. “You’re the most interesting thing happening right now.”
Cas had announced when questioned, eyes gone sweet and knowing as he tipped his head back to look at Dean.
The warmth of the morning threatens a hot afternoon, a bead of sweat already welling up between Dean’s shoulder blades. Cas’s sunflowers bob with the breeze, heads heavy on thick stems, and Dean’s tongue curls to press up against his soft palate. Sunflowers for his soul, isn’t that what Cas said? Warm gold embracing the dark whorl of its center.
Dean doesn’t need to look at him to hear the air quotes. He watches his own hands ease the board down, nestled into the salt and newly-hallowed ground. Sam would know what to say to that. He’d have questions about angel grace, or what changed from then to now to make it so Cas’s dumb loafers only leave normal footprints, in the rare times Cas leaves any kind of imprint behind him in his wake. Dean’s hands are shaking, just barely. He presses the board down flat.
Dean’s grip tightens. “Cas.”
Cas must hear the urgency, because he gets off Dean and sits his ass down on the floor without wasting a second. Dean scrambles to his unsteady feet and rushes to the kitchen sink just in time to hurl, grateful beyond measure that Cas had the presence of mind to do the dishes this evening already.
It was suddenly very important to be on the other side of the grocery store. “I’m getting — uh, snacks,” Dean said, beating a hasty retreat before Cas could question him doubling back.
With his bare hands, eh. One corner of Dean’s mouth lifts. “Hey, Cas,” he says. He sits up on his knees, leaning forward until he has both hands braced on the couch. “Ask me who I am.”
Dean has only started thinking of him as vulnerable recently. Even when Cas was human, Dean had other things on his mind to prevent that thought from swimming to the surface, and Cas has done little to dissuade him from his opinion that he’s invulnerable. At least until the very end, when Cas found one last way to sacrifice himself unforgivably.
Dean wasn’t sure what it meant, that he was used to it now. That he could almost sense the way the air changed right before Cas appeared, the barely-there taste of copper on the back of his tongue.
He comes to a halt in front of a stall where a woman’s selling metal jewelry she’s hammered by hand. He runs fingertips over a burnished copper bangle, remembering the ring he used to wear, the stupid beaded bracelets. When did he stop wearing them? Sometime between deaths, maybe, after he’d given up on collecting tchotchkes on the road to replace the things he lost.
Cas’s arm tightens around him. A mild breeze slides up Dean’s shirt where Cas’s touching has rucked it up an inch or two, a cool and pleasant reprieve on hot skin. Dean is forty-two years old and is being held by an angel while he watches his son play with his brother, and there is nothing evil on their tail to cheapen the sugar-shine of the lake off in the distance by their home. A djinn couldn’t have whipped up a dream this sweet.
Maybe it’s just
“Sam,” he warns. “Start talking.”
about?” he splutters, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.
Cas stares at him. “Surely you remember...?”
hunted, and he finds himself bewildered and speechless as he tries to figure out what angle to approach Cas at. He’s looking away, jaw tense, and won’t meet Dean’s eye.
Cas agrees, fervent, whole body crackling with grace. It sends small static shocks zinging through Dean’s body just to be close to him. Cas is crackling like a live wire, he hasn’t been this powerful since he rebelled, and Dean
Now that Cas is staring at him, Dean can’t look anywhere but at the road through the windshield. He keeps his hand where it is. Eventually, Cas either picks up on the hint Dean is waving in front of his face or gets bold all by himself and reaches down, tangling their fingers together as he draws both their hands into his lap. He squeezes.
Cas closes his eyes again. Dean wonders if he’s imagining it, tucking himself into bed in his mind’s eye — his hands are folded politely over his stomach, but Dean’s slept beside him before, and he’s usually a lot more grabby, curled up on his side.
Maybe it isn’t the garden part that surprises him. Maybe it’s nothing more than the simple fact of him wanting.
“Cas, c’mon,” Dean tries again.
“Would you like to go to the farmer’s market with me?” Cas asks patiently, with the tone of a man who’s asked more than once already. “I saw a flier in town yesterday.”
Cas makes a sound in the back of his throat. “I know too much about most things.”
The art at the end is by the one and only skepticalfrog on tumblr :)
“I mean it.” Dean’s hand is sweating — his grip on Cas’s knee is clammy and tight. “Don’t be grateful. Just be here.”
Grocery shopping is a little less fraught. Dean figures it’s a fifty-fifty shot if it’s because they’ve successfully grocery shopped together before or if it’s because it’s way less charged with connotations to pick out lunch meat than a mattress. Whatever the reason, Cas visibly relaxes by degrees under the overhead fluorescents, and Dean is more than ready to be in familiar territory.
Sam nods, clapping Dean on the shoulder as he passes him on the way to the driver’s seat, and Dean is more grateful than ever that his brother can read a room.
There was a time Dean hadn’t believed in second chances at all, let alone whatever the hell number they’re on at this point, their fourth or fifth or tenth, God help them. Even still, there’s a not-insignificant part of him that wants to reply with something sharp and cynical that would only make Cas’s face shutter further with a wince.
Dean thinks about Cas sprawled out in his sheets with the sunset coming in through the window to pool at the dips of his collar bones. Cas’s strange pale eyes would gleam up at him like cut diamonds, his grace a glow as strange and alien as any other bioluminescence. Dean is allowed to think of these things now. His mouth runs dry.
Dean huffs a hollow laugh, because yeah, that’s always what it’s about, isn’t it? Cas or Sam or Dean getting themselves lost or dead, and then taking turns dragging each other back from the brink. He shrugs, shoving his hands into his pockets.
That isn’t the plan, though. Dean shakes his head. “Nah. Cas’n me will catch our rhythm. You go woo your lady friend.”
“That was my mom’s favorite constellation.” He shifts his beer bottle to his other hand, fingers chilled. “Small fuckin’ world.”
“...Yeah?” Dean asks. “Think so?”
Now that’s a question. Dean turns back and braces his hands on the edge of the countertop, squaring his jaw. If he was sober he wouldn’t say it, but — “This not enough for you anymore, angel?"
Sam’s disgust is palpable and not at all surprised. “Right,” he says. “So am I talking to Dean or to dad right now?”
Cas told him.
“You want dark wood or light wood?” Dean asks, scritching a hand over the back of his neck. “Your bedframe’s dark, we can stick to a theme.”
Sam blinked. “What?”
“I’m not U-hauling it with you two,” Sam says, closing the back of the trailer decisively. “You guys take Baby, I’ll drive the stuff.”
Cas leveled him with a look. “You always have a headache, Dean. It didn’t take much intuition.”
“You want dark wood or light wood?” Dean asks, scritching a hand over the back of his neck. “Your bedframe’s dark, we can stick to a theme.”
No, all he’d dreamed of was sweet cool grass and more of the milky way than he’d ever seen at once, and a guardian angel whose wingspan had eaten the moon. Dean glances at Cas. He’s fiddling with the radio.
He’s dialing Sam’s number before he realizes he wants to. He holds it between shoulder and ear and listens to it ring, waiting for Sam to pick up the same exasperated way he always does when he’s in the middle of something, the way he has since he was a kid. Dean’s already preparing the annoying way he’s gonna ask after Eileen when he hits voicemail, the recorded message telling him to leave his phone number so Sam can get back to him.
“He’s as good as.” Dean shoves his hands in his pockets. “Cas is waiting for me. I gotta go.”
“The one and only time I had sex, it was under false pretenses and I was stabbed afterward,” Cas says dryly. “I’m not sure it counts.”
“Yeah,” Sam replies. He gives a gusty, tired sigh. “Yeah, we’re fine. Sorry it took so long to get back to you. Stuff got kind of intense for a second.”
“Very.” Cas nudged Dean’s elbow with his own as he got out the cream cheese. “You?”
“You gonna start that conversation?”
It only figures that Dean didn’t get away with that one. “Sure,” he laughs, and brushes the hair back from Cas’s forehead. “Okay. A ring and a new passport. Hey, we did a pretty good job here.”
“You buy the whole store, bud?” he calls out, shading his eyes with a hand.
“He’s right,” Cas agrees. Dean eyes him over the top of Jack’s head and finds that there are tears streaming unchecked down Cas’s face. Jesus, how long has he been crying? “You did well. The reapers want everything to be balanced, and no one can take complete control with the power divided between them.”
Cas stares at him blankly. “I don’t know how.”
“You drove home like this?” Cas demands, eyeing Dean’s unsteady hand as he fills a cup of water. “What were you thinking?”
“I will take him home,” Cas said, with finality. “As soon as I am finished speaking with him.”
(See the end of the chapter for
In the distance, a bird is singing, one of those mournful little warbles that puts Dean’s teeth on edge. It’s only barely the afternoon, the sun is warm where it lands on him, but his arms have both broken out in gooseflesh and he doesn’t think he can completely blame it on the residual smears of the Empty that lick up his forearms.
“Nah,” Dean says. “Cas ‘n I have too much stuff already.”
Dean was hobbling by the time they made it inside, which was super annoying, if only because Cas followed him around with narrowed eyes and his mouth a thin, unhappy line. He kept beaming
“Whatcha up to?” he asks, nudging Cas’s leg with a bare foot.
A little crease formed between Cas’s brows. He shifted, pressing up so that he could roll their hips together in a long, filthy grind. Even through the layers of their underwear, it was nearly too much. Electrically good. “Sexual intercourse is intended for procreation,” Cas pointed out once he’d managed to exhale. “Technically.”
Dean repeats, and tugs again. Cas frowns, reluctantly allowing Dean to pull him away, the new jam jar clutched in his hand. Stupid strawberry lime jelly. Who puts strawberry and lime together, anyway?
“You good?” Dean asked Cas in low tones so Sam would know to start pretending he wasn’t listening.
It actually feels good to tell him about Cas’s fading grace, the fact that he’s getting more human by the day, that he’s been sleeping some nights. Dean’s been keeping the worry balled up tight in his fists — he’s lighter after he stumbles through explaining it, spreading out the worry between the two of them.
Cas blinks. “Oh. Certainly. I’ll just... find somewhere else to be.”
It was hard to predict what media Cas would enjoy and what would only perplex him;
“It’s meant to remind you of the presence of God, which I choose to interpret as ‘holiness’.” Cas’s expression is very fond as he looks at him. “And it’s also a reminder that the house you’re entering is a Jewish home.”
“...You get any sleep last night?” Dean asks. Cas’s dark circles under his eyes don’t look any worse than usual, but Hell, that isn’t exactly saying much.
“You gonna pour that, or just glare at it?” Sam asked, nudging Dean’s side with his stupid sharp elbow. “What’d Mr. Coffee ever do to you?”
Jam Guy blinks, deer in the headlights.
Dean will drink to that.
bed was meant to be a unanimous vote."
“I didn’t realize we still need to be useful,” Cas says. His lip curls on the last word.
“As fun as it is to watch you two do this little dance,” Sam announces, “I’m exhausted.
“Got opinions, now that you’re ‘expanding your horizons’?” Dean asks, giving Cas a meaningful look. “Add ‘em to the cart, now’s the time.”
Sam’s expression goes both pinched and warm at the same time. “C’mere, Lilah,” he says, turning to the door and holding out his hand. “This is my big brother Dean and our best friend Cas, remember when I told you about them?”
For the life of him, he doesn’t know who starts it, but they’re kissing right up against Baby before one more loaded second can pass between them. Cas’s mouth is hot and demanding and his lips are less chapped than Dean expected them to be. He leans into Dean, making him arch backward, his own hands scrabbling for purchase on Baby’s smooth hood while Cas kisses him within an inch of his life and squeezes his hip some more.
It’s been long enough since the last time he did this that Dean’s body doesn’t have the muscle memory for it. The whole thing is achy and new, and it doesn’t escape Dean’s notice that Cas is broader at the shoulder and arm than anybody else he’s ever held. It’s nice. He couldn’t break him if he tried.
“Dude!” Dean exclaims, smacking Sam’s arm.
“Heard you moving around,” he says. “Keep it down, man.”
Dean is sitting up in bed by now, clutching fistfuls of the blankets around his waist. “Uh,” he says. “Cas —”
“Dean,” Cas says.
He barrels into the house, wraps his jacket around his arm to bust down the front door he spent so long refitting to the framing. Glass shatters, wood splintering as a beam from the high ceiling comes crashing down with another wave of hot air. Dean skids down the hallway, he's moving so fast, shouting “Cas!
“Bullshit,” Dean says, squinting at him.
Dean didn’t realize his eyes were leaking again until Cas kissed the side of his face, mouthing the tears off of his cheek. He chased Cas’s lips, trying to kiss him, but Cas wrapped a hand around his throat again and held him down, pressing him into the pillow.
“I consider myself an angel.” Cas’s tone has gone very dry.
Dean didn’t even fight it. He fished the keys out of his pocket and tossed them underhand to Sam.
Two of Cas’s fingertips stroked between Dean’s thighs, gliding through the silky wetness just beneath Dean’s dick, and his eyes asked a silent question. Dean nodded jerkily, so Cas wasted no time in sliding a finger inside him, crooking it upward at the same time that he did something swirly and complicated with his tongue. Dean exhaled sharp enough to hurt. Two fingers were even better, and Cas gave them both to him after a moment, thick and careful and familiar by now. Dean’s body recognized him. Welcomed him in. His belly went taut as a bowstring, Cas fucking him with shallow, calculated gestures that pressed his fingertips right where Dean wanted them.
Cas put his hand around Dean’s throat. Dean started breathing fast and rough when he realized that Cas was fitting his fingers carefully to the shape of the mark.
He pushes two pillows beneath Cas’s foot, not sure what it says about him, that he’s almost grateful to have something to do that he’s more used to. Patching someone up. Making his voice even on purpose. He arranges ice around Cas’s ankle, then turns his attention to the skinned knee.
“Good morning,” Cas says, grave and earnest as always. “I’m going to make coffee and drink it in the garden. Would you care to join me?”
“This is Dean and Cas,” Sam explains, indicating each of them in turn. Dean’s hand is behind his back, wrapping around the gun handle sticking out above the waistband of his jeans. “We just came down here with lunch. Unless you don’t want it?” He wiggles the tupperware in his other hand.
Cas didn’t call him on it, though, which was nice of him, and stepped out of his pants with dignity. Dean shoved Cas’s underwear off next, and then it was his turn, although he didn’t focus too hard on the specifics of how it happened now that Cas was kissing him with purpose. Cas’s single-minded attention was overwhelming even on a good day, which today wasn’t. Dean all but panted into the kiss, clutching at Cas with both hands, letting Cas card fingers through his hair a little too rough.
The silence that follows after Sam is finished rolling his eyes is a comfortable one. They’ve shared more evenings at this table than at any other, folding themselves wearily into these same chairs, and Dean realizes with a pang that he’s missed his brother. It isn’t the stomach-heaving agony of one of them being dead, for once it’s the normal kind of missing, and as tired as he is, Sam looks good. Dean’s lifelong pain in the neck. His tender little blind spot.
Sam’s smile glints. “We’ve got this. You should enjoy the rest of your honeymoon.”
“You can fix it?” she asks, brows scrunching up.
Dean thinks about a strong arm around his waist, and the safety that comes along with being under it, the many-eyed creature waiting for him sometimes in his dreams. Off-putting is a word for it, he guesses.
He’s asleep again by the time Cas merges them back onto the highway. It isn’t the dreaming kind of sleep, it’s the half-awake sixty-five-miles-per-hour doze that lulls his soul down to silence, reduced to the jostle of wheels and little else. There’s nothing in the world like the road to smooth out his rougher edges.
“Impertinent sounds like me,” Dean tries to joke. Anything to lighten the way the room gets heavier every time Cas talks like this.
“Hey, if you wanna, knock yourself out,” Dean says with a shrug. “Might as well get some protection up sooner rather than later.”
“Jack,” Dean says. “Are you — are you still —”
Now that’s a question. Dean turns back and braces his hands on the edge of the countertop, squaring his jaw. If he was sober he wouldn’t say it, but — “This not enough for you anymore, angel?”
‘Kind of intense’ can mean anything from a shootout with the King of Hell to the literal apocalypse, with them, and Dean’s been hoping not to have to make that distinction again anytime soon. He pets down the worst of Cas’s cowlicks and makes himself unclench his toes.
“Dude,” Dean says. “What?”
“Okay,” he says instead. “Let’s go home.”
“Someone ought to be,” Cas murmurs.
Dean gawks up at him, eyes wide and lips parted, legs tense beneath the knees that pin his thighs. Cas is backlit by the overhead like a real halo, alive with gilt edges. This is what avenging angels are supposed to look like: sun-tanned and furious and flushed from cheek to collar bone, eyes twin stars of flint.
Dean squeezed his eyes closed. “Okay.”
“Okay.” There’s a sound on the other end of the phone, either laughter or yelling, followed by a loud crash. “Jesus Christ. I gotta deal with this, drive safe. Oy —”
Dean grins. “Don’t hold your breath, angelface. You hungry?”
“Would you like me to take a turn driving?” Cas asks. He still sounds snippy, but worry seeps in as well.
Cas squeezed the hand around Dean’s throat, and that shut him up. It wasn’t a hard squeeze, but it was a warning, and Dean decided to do as he was told for once in his life and closed his mouth with an audible click. Cas stroked his thumb over his adam’s apple as if to reward him for good behavior.
When Dean wakes, he’s alone again. The covers are slightly turned down where Cas had been, although the sheets are long-cold. Dean yawns until his jaw cracks, stretching his arms over his head, and takes a moment to appreciate how fantastic his body feels after some decent sleep. Sometimes he gets a little hungover after Cas works his magic on him, but he guesses it doesn’t take as much concentrated angel juice to conk him out as it does to knit his bones back together.
Cas subsided, but the slant of his mouth was still unhappy, so Dean flipped their positions and rolled him onto his back, leaning over him. “Me too, okay?” he said. “All those things you said, back there. I’m not — I mean, I’m no good at this. But you know, don’t you?”
Dean, mid-sip, chokes. Cas thumps his back a couple times, until Dean’s splutters have turned into laughter. “You aren’t even a virgin!” he exclaims, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand and shaking it out after. Christ, he even got his shirt wet.
The lake glimmers in the rearview mirror almost the whole drive long, green like a bruise and as blue as Cas’s eyes. Whoever the fuck Chuck was, he wasn’t Cas’s Adonai.
“Already on it.” Sam shows him a tired smile. “Jody’s gonna bring the girls down for a visit after the hunt’s through.”
Dean shades his eyes with a hand and tries to spot where the fuck Cas went. There isn’t even a speck of him on the horizon, although the path he took to fly upward has left a slight shimmer in his wake, rosy and warm. Dean’s heart is tender in his chest, even as fear threads cold fingers through the notches in his ribs.
“Sure,” she says agreeably, and retrieves a flat case of rings in various shapes and shades of silver and gold from under the table. “What’s your size?”
does,” Cas mutters, looking out the window.
Frustrate me to no end.”
He sees Cas’s reflection in the glass, too, the way he tilts his head to the side the same way he’s always done when he looks right back, unreadable and still familiar all the same. Dean smiles at the glass. Cas glances away, the corner of his mouth tipped up in response.
Cas is sitting so close. He doesn’t have to be. They’ve worn dips into the cheap couch cushions on either end of the sofa, but Cas is sitting in the middle now, cross-legged so that the toes of one foot escape the blanket and nudge up against Dean’s leg. Does Cas know what he’s doing? Does he notice the rasp of denim against the ball of his foot and realize that Dean can feel it too?
Staggering down the hall to the bathroom isn’t the most dignified Dean has ever been in his life. The guy looking back at him in the mirror seems to agree, dark circles biting shadows under bloodshot eyes. “Now you match Cas,” he huffs to himself, poking one of the dark circles with the tip of a finger. Brushing his teeth makes it obvious that he’s only gonna nick his face to ribbons if he tries to shave now, with how bad his hands are shaking. Whatever. This is his lake house sabbatical, he can be scruffy if he wants.
“It’s alright,” Dean says. “Cas likes it. Dude’s obsessed with his garden, but he won’t let me actually teach him to swim. What kinda guy lets me buy him a lake house without telling me he doesn’t know how to swim, huh?”
Sam holds up his hands in surrender, but his eyes are worried, and Dean’s got a sick feeling in his stomach that agrees with him.
Why indeed. With the door cracked open, Dean can hear Cas’s voice trickling up from the kitchen, words impossible to make out. He sounds warm, though. He’s more in his element with kids than he has any real right to be.
“I do,” Dean admits, an acid taste on the back of his tongue. If Cas hates this — if he doesn’t want it —
Cas had said. Like he’d be shouting it from rooftops if it were up to him, or something.
“Nah. Gabriel was a hedonist. You just like your creature comforts.”
“Dean,” Cas said, with a note of worry, now.
“I don’t think he’s okay,” Dean says. “But I’m not gonna make him talk about his dead kid.”
Back at the bunker, Dean runs Cas a bath. He half expects to be shoved out of the bathroom so Cas can handle it himself, but he isn’t, so he doesn’t leave. Cas stands in the middle of the room staring vacantly in front of himself while Dean turns on the tap, drizzles soap into the water to make suds while the tub fills, shooting little cautious glances toward Cas out of the corners of his eyes.
Cas slips the herbs into the bag, which he cinches tight. “You would know already if he had.”
“Explain to Cas why the house is a good plan,” Dean tells Sam, gesturing a little helplessly.
“Well, boys?” Janet asks from the doorway. She grins, hands on her hips. “What are you thinking?”
“Hopefully not,” Cas says at last. “She was a virgin goddess.”
“Dean,” Cas is saying, his hand suddenly on Dean’s elbow.
Dean strokes over the raised burn where the pad of his thumb has branded Cas, struck dumb by the sight.
He gets to the outlet of the parking lot before he swears loudly and reverses back into a different space.
“Yes.” Cas looks at him with his brow creased, eyes deep and complicated and no longer melting in their sockets, thank fuck. “Is that a dream you’ve had before?”
After they’re finished moving their boxes in, they order Chinese food and eat it on the kitchen floor, Dean with his back against the cabinets, Sam and Cas both leaned up against the oven and eating fried rice out of the same carton. Well, Sam’s actually eating the rice — Cas leans over and swipes a piece of chicken with his chopsticks every once in a while, or a carrot, or a single pea.
“I might sleep,” Cas says. “Never say never.”
“Phanuel let Yaakov win.” Cas pushes Dean’s hands a little higher up. It actually tugs at Dean’s shoulders, now, a dull ache groaning in the joints’ sockets. “He was instructed by God to throw the fight. I have no such obligations.”
if you want a soundtrack for the read :)
“Besides,” he adds. “I like you where you’re sitting.”
“We’re hungry,” she tells Sam with a solemnity at odds with how fucking young she is. “Can we watch Scooby Doo again?”
“Out,” Dean answers shortly.
“May I penetrate you?” Cas asked, their lips brushing together as he spoke. Dean had heard a lot of guys ask if they could fuck him, but Jesus, no one did it like Cas. He nodded jerkily. “Very well,” Cas said. “Stay still.”
“You said I changed you,” Dean says, uncomfortable. “Said I was all sorts of awesome and worth dying for, too, so I know for sure you’re nuts.”
Cas takes his hand back from where it had still been resting at the center of Dean’s spine. “That won’t be necessary,” he says. His face is turned so that it’s covered once more by darkness.
Well. Maybe that’s just when he’s got company. There’s no way for Dean to know.
“Oh yeah?” Dean asks. He’s a little breathless himself. “Sounds like you had fun.”
, and that was all Sam needed before he opened the door and got inside.
“The pancakes or me?” Dean asks.
“It isn’t cheating to offer help,” Cas says, as sweet and gentle as a bruise. “Sometimes small things need help to get started.”
Dean likes the sound of that.
“Lucky angel bastard won’t even feel it in his knees,” Dean mutters to himself as he rises from a crouch and hears his ankle pop.
“You’re having trouble believing right now.” Dean grips the wheel tighter. “So I’m, uh. I’m doing it for you. I’m hanging onto it. When you want it back, I’ll give it to you.”
Cas is still looking at Dean when he says, “It’s either that or watch you sleep, and I’ve been told that’s off-putting.”
“Yo,” he says, drying his hands on the back of Cas’s flannel. Cas doesn’t even bother protesting, just looks up at Dean from where he’s sitting at the kitchen table with a baleful eye.
He used to be a creature that could scoop up atoms to make stars. Dean looks at him, surrounded by his fledgling garden, and wonders if
“More?” Cas asks.
Dean thinks of the year he spent after signing his soul over to his crossroads demon. He clutches at Cas’s uninjured leg. “You fucking martyr,” he snaps. “I can handle some bad dreams! D’you wanna be stuck as a human again?”
But no — the light is coming from Cas, not the sky, blindingly bright as it rips out of his chest and shatters toward the heavens. It splinters in a Lichtenburg as it leaves him, and Dean flinches away, turning his head with a wince and a gasp as the afterimage sears spindly fractals into every place he looks.
Sam frowns. “Jack isn’t dead.”
The neurons in Dean’s brain keep firing at strange intervals, incapable of taking in each new stimulus as it comes. There’s Cas, rucking up Dean’s t-shirt so he can palm from his belly to his ribs. There’s the pleasant scrape of Cas’s stubble against the underside of his jaw. There’s Cas’s knee insinuating itself between Dean’s, pressing their bodies closer together, prompting Dean to hook his calf around Cas’s leg. Intellectually, he knows all of these things are happening at once, but he catches them in sharp, jerky flashes.
“No,” Dean answers, then immediately regrets it. “Uh, yes. Maybe. I don’t know. Sam does.”
“Uh. Real, I guess.”
That much angel compressed into one human body has got to be dense, Dean can only assume. At least Cas doesn’t tire out easily.
Cas put a hand to Dean’s chest, and the shirt disappeared. He dragged his palm downward and Dean’s pants and boots followed, although he took the time to take off Dean’s underwear manually, expression unreadable.
It’s jarring. It’s way too early for this shit.
Dean shoots him a sideways glance. “One of the good guys, eh?”
The bunker doesn’t look any different, at least from the outside. Whatever wards Cas is sensing aren’t visible to the naked eye. Dean can’t see much past the door, either, because as soon as Cas tries to shoulder inside, Sam is bounding up the steps to herd them back out.
“Whatever,” Dean said, and took a bite of toast. “New job already?”
“Do it.” Dean jerks him off faster, the pad of his thumb catching on the spot just beneath the head. “Do it just like that. On me.”
Sam had shrugged, dangling feet kicking idly against Dean’s bed frame. “Dad always wanted sons anyway,” he said, which was true enough until he shrugged again and added, “and you’ve always been better at being his son.”
There are a lot of things about this scenario that would raise John Winchester’s eyebrows, however, and Dean is in no mood to tally them. He grabs spare socks, zips his duffel in a hurry. Cas is waiting for him already in the front room with a backpack slung over one shoulder, hair still sticking up in the back, squinting from having been asleep recently.
“Come here,” he calls back, beckoning.
“I’m perfectly fine.” Cas’s tone is clipped, with a note of warning. “You needn’t trouble yourself.”
Dean thought about the handprint scar on his shoulder and shuddered. “You’ve got a possessive streak a mile wide, dude.”
For a second, the gears turning in Dean’s head grind to a complete stop. Sam’s looking at him like he’s waiting for Dean to explode, Lilah is informing Cas how important it is to cut the sandwiches diagonally, and down the hall, a baby werewolf shrieks with hunger pangs.
The swell of emotion that elicits nearly drags Dean under in a riptide. A fucking decade. There’s nothing he can say in response that’ll even touch what he’s feeling, so he just tackles Cas back into the mattress and kisses him as good and sweet as he knows how to be.
Cas smiles blindingly bright. Dean catches him up in his arms and drags him down into another kiss, one that he interrupts with a high, shocked moan when Cas’s thigh slides between his to give him something to arch against. Cas’s dick is hard in the hollow of Dean’s hip. His head swims.
Cas cracks an eye. “Come again?”
Cas swallows half a mouthful of lake water and splutters. Dean, with his toes comfortably trailing against the muddy lake floor, is quick to reel him in to keep him from going under and swallowing more. He catches Cas up in his arms, thumping him on the back once, twice, right between his shoulder blades. Cas coughs some more and hangs onto him with an arm around Dean’s neck. Their legs nudge together, Cas’s knee bumping into the inside of Dean’s thigh, warm and soft compared to the cold nip of the water licking up against them.
Dean gives up on the potatoes and orders a pizza. It’s pretty inevitable after the day they’ve had, and if he’s being honest, he doesn’t want to let Cas out of his sight until the sick shock of it fades, learning what state his grace is in.
Dean rubs Cas’s back, up and down over the blanket. “Let’s go home,” he says.
Dean’s got a homing beacon for dive bars, it doesn’t take him long to find one. The restless itch under his skin quiets a bit the second he crosses the threshold, pouring himself onto a bar stool with a sigh and two elbows that come down heavy on the bar top.
He was vaguely aware that he was bleeding through the rag, though. He couldn’t really feel the pain — he was too hopped up on adrenaline to feel more than numb and kind of uncomfortable — but his stomach was sticky-hot when he peeled up the cloth to poke at it, and the dull ache only reinforced the knowledge of how much this was going to suck the next morning.
Dean can’t wrap his head around a werewolf washing dishes on the full moon. Or a teenager, for that matter. “So this one’s tame for now,” he says. “What about when she grows up, huh? This’s gonna break bad, Sam, it always does.”
“Are you serious?” Sam demands, smacking his own forehead as he surveys the damage. “Dude! This is the third time!”
“Watch your back,” Dean says. “Jody’ll adopt her the second you aren’t looking if you aren’t careful.”
“Can you feel it when I wrap my wings around you?” he asks into the curve of Dean’s neck.
“Are you alright?” Cas demands. “The power of God, what did you do with it?”
“Is it lemonade?” he asks hopefully.
“I’m going to the library today,” Sam announced as he carried three plates to the table, a stack of toast, a second trip for salt and pepper and the newspaper, which had been folded down to the crossword. “I’m deputizing you and Cas to stock up on ammo and granola bars and shit.”
Cas blinks. “What for?”
Dean kisses him fiercely while he hooks fingers in Cas’s belt loops to tug him the rest of the way up the stairs. If they pause to reassess one more time, he’ll lose it. Walking backward down the hall is easy, easy — Dean knows every square inch of this house, he
Dean rubs up and down Cas’s back, right between his shoulder blades. The Empty doesn’t come.
“Dean, Dean,” Cas breathed, repeating it like a prayer. There were tears in his eyes, glittering as they wet his eyelashes. Cas had never learned to be self-conscious about these kinds of emotional displays, didn’t know it was fucking weird to cry during sex, but Dean wasn’t going to be the one to tell him. Cas bled sincerity. He never tried to hide what he thought, what he felt. Dean would just die if that ever changed.
Cas, who’s learned by now that Dean means it when he says to give him space, nods and stands. “You know where I’ll be,” he says, and touches Dean’s ankle just briefly before he leaves. Even through the covers, Dean feels it all the way down to the bone.
with a brave set to his mouth. Dean shook his head
“I know you down to the cell,” Cas continued, each word forceful, with the conviction of God himself. “Down to the
He can’t talk about it, fine, but he’s always been better at acting, anyway. He’ll figure out what he can do, and then he’ll just — he’ll do it. He will. Easy as that.
Dean makes extra noise on purpose as he stomps down the stairs so that Cas at least has some warning, and Dean gets to watch in real time as Cas straightens up and puts his face back on. The way he tips a small smile toward Dean is as sharp as a wound. He rises from his seat to take the thick blanket off Dean’s hands, snapping it open over the air mattress in one clean gesture that looks awfully practiced for a guy who used to get tripped up fixing his own tie.
He knows, he
There’s only so much stalling one guy can do. He tramps outside where Cas is reading a book on the deck, sprawled out on his back on one of the deck chairs with his sunglasses low enough they’re almost falling off his nose. “I got something for ya,” Dean says, stuffing his hands in his pockets. Cas arches a brow at him over the top of his sunglasses.
“What d’you consider yourself?”
Cas claws out of the Empty covered in black oil. He’s drenched in it, head to toe, gasping mouth showing brilliantly white teeth in contrast. His eyes are wild and unfocused, lashes sticky, and his hand clutches Dean’s forearm in a bruising grip. Dean’s hollering to Sam, he doesn’t know what he’s saying, but Sam is at his side in a second, grabbing Dean around the waist to dig his heels in and help pull him backward. Together, they drag Cas the rest of the way through the bubbling pothole of tar on the forest floor.
“When I say worship,” Cas says, very measured. “Perhaps what I meant to say is that for you, I would kneel.”
Might as well make his circuit downstairs, see if that’ll calm his body down. He’s careful on the stairs, bare feet cool on the floor, rolling from heel to toe so as not to disrupt the quiet hush that’s permeated the whole house.
The third week, Sam calls.
Dean’s heart sinks. “Heaven’s still not letting you in, huh?”
“You dropped the suffix that means ‘God’ and stripped it down to mean nothing but myself.” Cas is still touching W, stroking from the tip of one crooked point to the next with reverence. “Don't misunderstand, I’m glad I’m not Heaven’s soldier anymore. I’d take being your Cas over Heaven’s Castiel any day of the week.”
“What are you hoping is gonna happen, here?” he asks. He tries his damnedest to keep the frustration out of his voice, only succeeding in sounding desperate instead. “You think this is gonna get him to come down from Heaven?”
“Do you have lubrication?” Cas wants to know, mouthing the words into Dean’s left pectoral.
Cas collides with Dean, knocking him backward onto the grass. Dean yelps, the two of them rolling and tumbling a good twelve feet until they land with Dean’s head almost smacking into one of Cas’s planter beds.
Dean lies his palm flat against the door, and thinks about etching wards into the foundation, into the walls. They can rip up the rotting floorboards and dust the ground with salt before they install new ones, they can bury lead stakes with hex bags at the corners of their property, they can build a house made for keeping people like them safe. Not that there’s a whole lot to keep safe from, there hasn’t been since Jack took over, but if Dean starts thinking about Jack right now, he'll lose his breath before he even crosses the threshold.
“Would you prefer I take it easy on you, son of Adam?” Cas murmurs, leaning down a little farther, so that the hem of his rucked-up shirt from scuffling brushes Dean’s stomach. “Dean
Dean hears the word ‘consequences’ and can’t help but think of all the times he’s seen Cas die, from his spontaneous combustion at the hands of Michael to being backstabbed by Lucifer with an angel blade — all of the images culminate in the wet black of the Empty that Dean had to pull Cas out of with his own bare hands, its thick black tar burning an acid hole in the forest floor where he and Sam completed their ritual. Dean picks at a chip in the plastic of the coffee thermos lid.
“This isn’t about what you want right now,” Cas reminded him, and sucked a kiss into the flesh of Dean’s thigh. Dean’s hips twitched. “And I take issue with second part.”
“May I?” Cas asked, grave as always. His fingertips tucked up under the hem of Dean’s shirt and all Dean could do was strip out of it himself and toss it wordlessly toward the hamper. The moonlight coming in from the window frosted over Cas’s outline, making him even more statuesque than usual, all marble and mussed hair.
Sam immediately shushes him. “Dean, come on. He’s the best one I could’ve gone to for advice.”
Cas must get the wrong idea, because he pauses. “Unless you’ve changed your —?”
“How’d you know to come find me?” Cas’s hand is warm and smooth, skin unmarred by the gun calluses that eat into Dean’s palms.
He hits the end call button and just looks at his phone for a long second. Sam did say to expect radio silence, but Dean didn’t take him
Since when do angels get affected by the world enough for their hair to grow or their vessels to tan, anyway? Cas bites raw into a painfully ripe tomato, bending over the kitchen sink to do it. Of course juice gets on his shirt anyway — one of six plain white t-shirts purchased in a pack from Walmart — but the effort to keep his clothes clean is so human, face rich with satisfaction as he takes another bite. Who can blame him for relishing it? He grew that thing with his own hands, the same hands that smite his enemies and make blessings on the sabbath and heal Dean again and again and again.
, Cas. You’re only gonna mark me up more.”
“Oh!” Jack whirls back around to Cas. “I almost forgot!”
Cas nods gravely. Dean wonders if he knows he’s the first person to actually take him seriously. Cas takes everyone seriously, that’s not news, but Dean’s still not used to it, being taken at face value. It makes him want to put on a better face.
John Winchester would have already killed Zippy by now. Dean feels an uneasy itch in his palm just looking at her, studying her elongated limbs and the coarse, wiry fur in patches down them. His father wouldn’t have waited long enough to notice the way she angles her chair to keep her sister in her line of sight, or Lilah’s guileless comfort around her, smiling up with a mouth smeared with peanut butter.
Dean imagines how hard a person would have to tussle with an angel to earn a new name. His wrists flex. “Wait, didn’t the angel lose?”
Dean will never admit it in a million years, but it’s the permission that tips him over the edge. He comes, making a noise he never has before and hopes he never will again, halfway between a groan and a whimper. Cas fucks him through it, hooking his fingers upward, making Dean’s cock give an oversensitive jerk in his own hand while he makes a mess of his stomach.
“He’s a freak,” Dean agrees. “But what can ya do.”
“Oh, just the usual,” Dean told him breezily. “We’re passionate about
Dean jerks his chin in the direction Sam left, just in time to watch him reappear out of a different door with a square tupperware in hand.
Jade slides another shot across the bar in his direction and Dean takes it gratefully. This one burns going down, and Dean’s starting to wonder if he’s maybe overdoing it, stomach roiling as he swallows.
“I know it's short notice, I just need you to see this,” Sam continues, and Dean knows his brother too well not to hear the note of tension in his voice. “Dean?”
The small, contented noise Cas makes is worth the internal nail-biting. His head lands on Dean’s shoulder.
“You’ve been paying attention when I told you about music,” he says after a beat. “This’s a good song.”
“Well, shit,” Dean rasps.
“Dean,” Cas rasps. His voice breaks, Dean’s name a hoarse whisper.
Dean blows a little air out the side of his mouth. Stupid question.
“Lift your ankle,” Dean tells him. “Gotta elevate it.”
Not that Cas is on his arm, strictly speaking. He’s actually several paces ahead, eyes bright with real enjoyment as he flits from vendor to vendor. Dean hangs back to watch him. The weather’s warm, so Cas is dressed in a t-shirt and actual fucking cargo shorts — Dean hadn’t had the heart to tell him how dorky he looks when they were clothes shopping, not with Cas so enamored of all the pockets.
Sam practiced that speech. Dean can hear it, the fact that he recited it over and over for the purpose of winning him over.
- A depiction of vomiting.
Cas’s head is cocked again. “Like what, then?”
Dean stares right back. Come to think of it, the only time he’s ever seen Cas in the water was after the Leviathans, and, well. That hadn’t exactly been a fun day trip.
“Hey,” Dean says, hoarse. “Hey. Cas. You gotta know I love you.”
Dean wraps his leg around Cas’s hip, drawing him in. He licks his lips to distract from the way goosebumps have broken out down the backs of both arms. “...Yeah?”
“Come to bed, Dean,” Cas whispered. “Let me look after you.”
Sam stares at him. “What?”
“What’re you gonna grow?” Dean asks, reaching for the little bowl of nails at his knee.
But Cas is standing there, frozen in place with his mouth hanging open like his whole life has been leading to this moment, and all Dean can think is that the domino effect that brought them here was as unlikely as it was inevitable.
“So you wanna run a monster orphanage,” Dean clarifies. “Sam Winchester’s school for gifted youngsters.”
It’s drafty upstairs. He didn’t notice that too well when they’d toured the house, and he considers the windows in his bedroom now, sort of winded by the fact that he has windows at all. He touches the back of his hand to the frame and feels a cold hiss of air through an open crack.
“Jesus, Cas,” Dean muttered. It was much more embarrassing to hear ‘make love’ than ‘fuck’, and he felt himself flush even as he shifted his hips a little to try and get Cas to move his thumb.
The sun reflects off the lake in shimmery refractions. Dean has his arms crossed over his bare chest, looking out at it, waiting for Cas to put on his swim shorts and join him. Cool water laps at his knees, small ripples that move with the wind, and it makes Dean think about a dream he once had, a pier with a fishing rod and an angel at his back.
The one big window lets in enough sunshine to drown the room in shades of white afternoon gold. It lights up one side of Cas’s head and his hunched shoulders, and Dean thinks of the beautiful room that Heaven trapped him in while trying to make him say yes to Michael, one of the few other times in his life Cas has ever turned his back to him.
“I was taking a walk by the lake.” Cas struggles out of his shoes and then his jeans, shoving them down his hips so he can kick them off and check the damage. His left ankle is almost the size of a grapefruit. “My toe got caught on a rock and I fell.”
Cas’s stomach muscles spasm. “Please.”
“That’s the prayer for putting it up. Now you kiss it,” Cas instructs him. “Touch it every time you cross the doorway, then kiss your fingertips.”
“I told you I’d give you what you deserve,” Cas interrupted, raising his lips from Dean’s belly. His eyes flashed. “Not what you want.”
He turns on his heel and tramps back inside, only remembering at the last second not to slam the front door and accidentally wake his brother. His blood runs hot in his veins, throbbing at his temples, and he falls back into bed with a roiling stomach and a pulse that hammers in his ears.
Dean has watched a hundred ill-conceived grabs for power, over his lifetime as a hunter. He’s watched deals get struck, souls change hands, the throne of Hell and the altar of Heaven treated like a game of musical chairs. He’s seen people — good people — get suckered in by power and twisted up until they’re unrecognizable, no matter how good their intentions. He’s been that person himself, more than once, for all his protestations that he’s a normal guy who wants normal things. Never in his life has he seen someone willingly give it all up just like that, let alone step down from the top of the food chain and fall back to Earth with their head held high, no shame, no regrets.
“Maybe you hadn’t noticed,” he says, “but I go kind of ape when you die.”
Dean stretches with a deeply sleepy noise and glances all around. In front of him, the lake house sits squat and proud in the dying light, sunset blooming open flowers all down the front in shades of pink and orange. He doesn’t know why he’s surprised to see those colors on Cas as well, dripping down the side of his throat facing the sun.
“Well, shit,” he sighs. He adds it to his mental list of things to fix. In the meantime, he layers blankets on his bed and takes an extra thick one out to Sam.
Lunch, for Zippy, consists of eight chicken hearts that she spears on a fork before she gnaws on them. Lilah finishes her sandwiches completely unbothered by the gore directly to her left or the deep claw-shaped gouges in the wood of the tabletop. Sam halfheartedly offers to fix Dean and Cas something too, but Dean’s appetite is ruined, and since when does he let his brother cook for him, anyway? At least Cas is just as perturbed as he is. He doesn’t know what he’d do if Cas were as sanguine as Sam.
Dean doesn’t know what that means, but Cas picks out the dark wood bookcase, so that’s that. Wringing a choice of bedding out of him takes another three or four concentrated bursts of point-blank questioning, going on long enough that Dean is tempted to throttle him into making a decision, but they end up at the checkout line with an armful of blue sheets and blankets, so he tries to take the win for what it is.
Cas rounds the corner armed with grape jelly and gummy bears and a deeply determined look on his face.
Dean stuck his tongue out at him, because that was what brothers were supposed to do, and would have kicked him under the table if he wasn't afraid of catching Cas's leg in the crossfire.
Sam stretches and yawns, neck cracking. Dean gets up to pay their bill.
“Holding —"
Dean scrubbed the last plate a little harder than the others. Cas’s shoulder didn’t quite brush up against his own as they stood next to the sink together, but it was a damn close thing, so close that Dean could sense the warmth radiating out from Cas’s arm. The same arm he’d clutched to the night before, panting harsh breaths into the crook of Cas’s neck; Cas had made him draw back eventually and look him in the eye, which had been nearly intolerable. But he’d also said
He jerks him, messy and with a grip just as firm as he knows Dean loves, once, twice, and Dean gasps, shakes, speaks: “Cas, Cas, love you, shit,” and then he comes all over his stomach and Cas’ hand, shaking and shivering and panting.
And then it’s a blur of information and being bandaged up again and given and helped into his special binder, the one he needs to wear for the upcoming three weeks to make sure the healing goes well.
Cas feels a smile spread across his cheeks, wider than usual, and says: “Actually, I would love that.”
“Meant to ask you, anyway, would it be okay for a friend to come by and see me?”
“C’mon,” Dean whispers again, and Cas can’t do anything but pop open the bottle of lube and coat his fingers.
Because it really
Date four is mostly sharing funny childhood stories and eating a funky green-blue cake with Charlie and Gilda. Cas is so into the cake, Charlie has to swear to call them when they have shop leftovers again.
“You are,” Dean says, and that’s when he finally remembers his own hands, and moves them down until his fingers tangle in Cas’ silky-soft, crazy hair. “God, Cas, haven’t even touched me yet.”
It’s Dean.
And then, with nothing else left to say, Dean stumbles into Cas’ arms and kisses him.
He’d already sent a text to Gabe, who in turn promised him to wait outside the hospital at 2:15 sharp to pick up his “lil bro”.
When Dean wakes up, the first thing he does is blink his eyes open and turn towards Cas. He looks a little blurry and confused, but when he catches Cas’ eyes he smiles lazily. “Morning, sweetheart,” he yawns, and Cas feels all fuzzy and simultaneously annoyed at himself for it.
, now. He remembers that he’s currently all bandaged up, that “there will be swelling during the first couple of days that will go down eventually”.
In his trunk, he’s got boxes with food and desert, a picnic blanket and a thermos filled with cold, homemade lemonade.
It’s date eleven, and Cas’ scars are healing nicely and his pain is fading without the pills.
But then Cas took in Claire, and all his time and energy had to be on this little bundle of life. Obviously. Doesn’t mean Dean misses him less, though. And now, when Cas walks by his house, it’s not only just his gorgeous, hot friend — but also Cas, a soft and caring and sweet father to a tiny, cute baby.
Lately, though, Cas has a hard time finding the limit of
He waits, and waits.
“Cas,” Dean gasps, “Cas,” and Cas kisses him senseless.
, and Dean just stares. He can feel the vodka dribbling down his chin while he drinks, and oggles his best friend some more.
When the last bite is gone, Dean puts the cardboard box of pie to the side and reaches over, pulls Cas towards him and into a kiss so soft and cinnamon-sweet, Cas aches with it.
A mixture of laughter and snorts wanders through their rows, and everyone raises their glasses. Everyone, even Garth — everyone
They make him… feel all soft and gooey. Make him want a partner and a child running around his too-empty house, making his life a little louder and more colorful.
Cas bites his lip, and then he leans in, over Claire, and plants the softest of kisses on Dean’s mouth. He makes a soft noise, low in his throat. “I’ve been wanting to do that for so long,” he whispers, kissing Dean again.
There are two drains by his sides, one left and one right, little plastic tubes that come out from beneath his shirt and end by his hips in round-ish clear plastic bottles. They look absolutely disgusting, filled with blood, and Cas can’t think about it too much before he feels slightly sick. Maybe it’s a blessing he can’t raise his hands just yet, or else he might feel where the tubes sink into his skin —  and he’s not sure he could handle that.
But he makes it through the drive in one piece, makes it into the hospital and finds Dean in his room, the one he now shares with an elderly man, beaming at Cas as soon as he steps inside.
He doesn’t dare carry her while walking through the room, the way Cas suggests, but he carefully sinks down on the couch with Claire and rocks her in his arms.
Everyone drinks,
“You’re fresh out of surgery, Mr. Novak. You’re still feeling the effects of the anesthesia, they will be mostly gone when you wake up again later,” she tells him, voice gentle and thankfully not too loud in the otherwise quiet room.
“Yeah,” Cas agrees quietly, watching the way Dean’s gorgeous green eyes fly up at his face and back down to Dean’s lap. “It kind of will.”
He would have come to this silly workshop at Charlie’s anyway, if he’s being honest. She wouldn’t really have let him stay home. But the fact that she conveniently mentioned that Cas would come, too, made even the last of Dean’s resolves melt.
He can’t deny the possibility of it having been
Charlie fills almost the entire next hour with her chatter, tells Dean about how the bakery she and her girlfriend Gilda own has been going. And Cas has assumed, from her earlier words, but hearing about her and her girlfriend now makes him feel… happy, on one hand, and really, really bad for his earlier assumptions about Dean on the other. She babbles about the bakery and about Dean’s friends, and she turns towards Cas and explains, sometimes, who Sam is, or their friends Joe and Rowena.
The second one is of him in a jean button up, stretching in front of a window —- and the way the sun hits him makes it look like rainbows are dancing across the bridge of his nose and his cheek.
Dean’s hands are at the seams of his shirt and pushing it up to expose his stomach when Cas comes back from his thoughts into reality. Dean’s already out of his own shirt and Cas gets lost for a while in the creamy skin of Dean’s broad chest and the softness of his tummy. “You’re beautiful,” he murmurs, and then he gets to watch the prettiest blush spread all the way down to Dean’s pecs.
I cannot begin to express how grateful I've been for all the support I've received as I've written this fic - truly, you have all made me feel so held. I hope this ending brings you as much joy as it brings me :)
Cas’s baleful eye just prompted Dean to grab the remote and flick the television on, settling in for an evening of watching people make idiots out of themselves while he studiously didn’t think about the way Cas’s hand snaked under the cuff of his jeans to wrap around his calf.
“Back —"
Something tells Dean PB&J isn’t gonna cut it.
This is what Dean knows: Cas is in love with him, somehow, and means it enough to have said it twice. He’s stuck around this time longer than he ever has before, grieving and gardening and letting his hair grow out with his eyes fixed on a Heaven that doesn’t want to let him in anymore. He sometimes looks at Dean like he’s salvation, still, after all the times Dean’s fucked him over — even when wrestling him to the floor, his eyes and hands were warmed with a reverence that Dean can’t stomach.
He was still thinking about his stupid old-man pains when they drove back, wondering where they’d gone, and why it bothered him so much that they had. Cas handed him a water bottle from the backseat. Dean took it gratefully, downing half before he gave it over to Sam.
“You gonna start blaming yourself for shit that’s not your fault?” he grits out. The change in altitude as they make their way west has his ears popping uncomfortably. “Because I was pretty sure I had that patent on lock, pal.”
to a girl half asleep on his shoulder.
“Thank you,” Dean says.
“Time ‘s it?” Dean grunts, making grabby hands at the coffee pot in Sam’s hand.
“Cas down for the count?” Sam asks.
“C’mon,” Dean says. He cradles the vulnerable nape of Jack’s neck. “We gotta call Sam, don’t you think? He’s gonna lose his shit when he hears you’re okay.”
Dean ignores him. Sam offers a coffee cup of his own that Dean accepts, leaning against the counter to sip it with his hackles still raised. Cas at least has the good graces to look abashed, very quiet at the table, pale hands cradling the cup between them the way one might a fragile bird’s egg.
“Um, I like grape,” Lilah says. “I
The lake is murky, tastes like silt, and makes Cas’s eyes reflect green.
“It’ll be fine if I ice it,” Dean said.
“I do trust you.”
In the back of Dean’s head, he’s suspected this for a while. The amount Cas eats these days, his tan, his hair growing... the stripe of sunburn that appears across his nose and cheekbones in a pink smudge, and his newfound sleeping habits, too. He’s been living like a human for months. That doesn’t make it any easier, hearing it confirmed.
Content warnings:
“Dude!” Dean exclaims, smacking Sam’s arm.
Dean wants him to stay, and possibly always has. He wants him to stay so badly.
They pass the honey stall on the way to the car, so Dean stops short and brusquely purchases a large jar of wildflower honey so they at least get some of what they came for. Cas stares him down the whole time with judgemental eyes. He still follows Dean to the car all the same, stalking toward the passenger side and folding himself into his seat with pursed lips. Dean joins him, bracing himself for a tense ride back when he buckles his seatbelt and starts the car.
“Hush,” Cas says, visibly flustered. He sets down a huge bag of dirt at the corner of the house closest to the prospective garden. “The woman helping me was — very enthusiastic.”
The three adults watch the children from the kitchen, elbow to elbow in the doorway, and Dean crosses his arms tightly over his chest.
It takes six torturous seconds for Cas to understand what he’s looking at. He approaches it with a curious expression, kneeling in front of the deep supers to inspect them, tucking his thumb just inside until he can tap against the honey frames. “Oh!” His face lights up. “It’s for keeping bees.” His eyes jump from the blue sheen of the box to Dean’s paint-stained jeans, whole face going slack with tender surprise. “Did you — did you
The soft rap of knuckles against his door is the only warning he gets before the hall light is spilling into his room, Cas’s body a shadow haloed by it. Dean’s tongue sticks to the roof of his mouth. Many dreams he’s had have started this very way, although usually preceded by the ruffling sound of feathers, ozone tang on the back of his tongue from the effect of Cas materializing near him.
Oh, Dean knows that game. His grip on the wheel tightens. “Yeah, well. Keep stepping.”
“I got this,” Sam insists. He’s exasperated now, rolling his eyes almost exactly like Zippy. “I promise.”
“I’m not being held hostage,” Sam sighs. At least he’s exasperated now, not just weird and tense. “I need you to trust me.”
“Did I get the wrong idea?” Jade asks gently. “Sorry for assuming, you just said you bought him a house.”
“Hush,” Cas says. He slides into the bed and pushes Dean until he gives up and lies back down. Cas spoons up behind him immediately, snaking an arm around his waist, and Dean has just enough time to think
Cas is looking at him. Dean can feel it prickle across the back of his neck, the same as he can feel Sam’s dubious gaze without glancing to the side to see it.
“Take it,” Cas demanded hoarsely, hips snapping. “Take my love.”
“That’s what’s on the menu?” Dean asks. “Gummy bears?”
“My happiness isn’t your responsibility,” Cas says just when Dean thinks they’ve dropped the subject, voice as low as the animal rumble of the car engine. “I died content enough. I never imagined what step might come next, or that there might even be another step to come.”
It’s a nice thought. Things being equal. Dean rubs up and down Jack’s back with brisk, firm motions. “Why didn’t you come home when Cas called you, huh? Did this deal of yours take months to make?”
“Give her my regards?” Cas asks, tipping his chin up to give Sam a small smile. “Dean and I can handle purchasing furniture and home accessories on our own, surely.”
Mary Winchester had sat Dean down on the grass in their front yard when he was very small and taught him how to spot Orion’s belt. Even now, he can spot the triplet stars easily, slung low in the sky.
Cas tied his hands to the headboard, and Dean flexed his wrists a little to feel the silky-smooth give of the tie against them. “This for you or for me?” he asked.
“I know,” Dean says. He consciously unclenches his hands from around the steering wheel before they go white-knuckled. “I just got a feeling about this one.”
Lilah nods shyly and hides half behind the doorway. Her small round face is framed by an enormous halo of dark curls, eyes huge and brown.
he was full of shit with his dismal speech about making his peace with being human. He knew it. He just never expected to see Cas bursting at the seams with angelic vim and vigor again, lit up from the inside, bleeding magic when he bends and kisses Dean like his life depends on it. Dean flounders — he doesn’t know where to put his hands, with Cas pinning him to the ground and their freaking kid not even four paces away.
He sizes up the rest of the pieces he has left to cut out and decides to call it a day as soon as he’s measured and marked the margins on each of the remaining planks. He pencils an outline for the honey supers and the bottom board, and then the top lid too, ready to be reinforced by metal paneling when he gets to it. He had to send away for other parts, frames for the supers and an excluder to keep the queen bee in her zone separate from the rest of the hive — there’s no rush assembling the other parts until those are delivered.
“Huh,” Sam said. He took the pencil from behind his ear and jotted it down. “Nice one.”
Sam looks at the closed door behind which Dean hopes Cas is actually resting. He sighs, crossing his arms over his chest, and Dean is suddenly more claustrophobic than he knows how to handle.
Dean barked a laugh. “Funny guy.”
“You’d rather I drive your goddamn car?” Sam asks, raising his eyebrows.
The ring looks nice, though, on his finger. It catches and throws the light like nobody’s business. Fits like a dream, too, so he tips the lady twenty bucks and hustles back to Cas.
Dean blinks. Then, of course, he follows.
“Is everything okay?” Sam asked, tucking a lock of hair behind his ear to cover his flinch.
Dean waves.
“This is why you go swimming with a buddy,” Dean tells Cas, just for something to say to fill the quiet.
Cas inclines his head. “Would it be easier if I wasn’t?”
Dean gaped at him, mouth hanging open. It didn’t ache when he breathed anymore, but there was a new weight on his chest, he was pinned down by the intensity of Cas’s gaze.
“Was it my fault?” he asks.
“Look at you, huh,” Dean says. “Need a hand, buddy?”
“I found a guy who’ll sell us a starter hive,” Dean interrupts, face burning. “We have to pick it up this month, though, before it gets too cold out. And we should probably send away for thicker insulation for the supers before winter hits anyway, ‘cause I’ve been doing research, and... man, why are you looking at me like that?”
That’s what this is about?”
This is officially way more about beekeeping than Dean ever expected to learn. He puts a tarp down on the garage floor and kneels there to paint the box, using steady strokes from the elbow so he won’t stress his wrist. He thinks about Cain as he wipes his forehead with his t-shirt hem and lays each piece out in its space to dry, how can he not? Cain, who retired from his violence to a farmhouse with his bees to tend, who buried his dearest weapon at a grave site so it wouldn’t tempt him back to murder.
It was very easy to forget that Cas was an actual angel, not just a good friend with a couple of useful magic tricks. Dean was always reminded of this at the most inconvenient times.
Cas cries out as he comes, face screwed up with pleasure, folding forward with a sway. Dean gets an arm around him once again, burying fingers in dark hair that’s growing longer with every passing day that Cas spends here, in this house, by his side and breathing.
Dean bows his head and thinks of Emma, thinks of Magda, thinks of the Frankenstein kid, thinks of Jack. There are probably more dead children in their wake that he's forgotten. “I almost ran away to Bobby’s,” he says. “With you. You were eleven, I was sixteen.”
Zippy scoffs, upper lip curling to show teeth that are still as sharp as razor blades. “You’re old,” she says, taking one earbud out. Dean wonders if her teeth ever go back to normal. “I’m watching Hunter x Hunter.”
He’d been reluctant to let Cas go down on him at first, because nothing was as potentially upsetting as a partner getting up close and personal with his junk like that, but God. Cas’s mouth was heaven. And it’d been too hilarious to hear Cas’s vodka-over-gravel voice growl
“Cheater,” he mutters. “You’re cheating.”
It would be worth it just for the way Cas grunts when Dean’s fist connects with his solar plexus, a grin blooming across Dean’s face for a bright, feral moment. He swings forward to grapple Cas back, to try and shove him to the floor —
“Well, that sucked,” Sam said brightly. He looked Dean over. “Jeez, what happened to you?”
The first thing he notices is that foam tubing covers most of the sharp angles that the Men of Letters tended to favor in their design choices, wrapping around the stair banisters, the drawer handles. The second is that all the weapons are gone.
“Jesus Christ,” Dean muttered. After a couple loaded seconds, he grabbed a tape and shoved it into the deck so he wouldn’t have to keep talking.
“I miss him,” Dean says again, face screwing up. It’s easier to spit it out the second time, somehow. “I miss that kid so fucking much.”
Cas is looking at him with those big, serious basset-hound eyes of his. Dean is hyper-aware of Cas’s elbow at the back of his neck, the wet skid of skin on skin as they shift and rock, bolstered up by the waves that whip to life in the breeze.
He shows Sam pictures of Cas’s garden overflowing its bounds and spilling up toward the deck Dean rebuilt, the light fixture it took three tries to wire correctly, and one especially funny photo of Cas passed out on a blanket by the lake with his big sun hat over his face.
The lake house is in Fort Collins Colorado and it is in a complete state of disrepair. The front deck has rotted away into almost nothing, just a rickety set of steps up to a yellow door with peeling paint. Dean puts his hand on the decaying banister and feels the way the late afternoon sun has soaked inside and warmed it to the touch, rubbing his thumb against a knot in the wood.
In a couple minutes, Cas will have a desk, and at some point before seven pm, the mattress store will deliver their purchase. Dean will serve Cas a plate of stew he won’t finish and make up his bed, and he’ll fold hospital corners with the sheets because that’s how his mother taught him. He’ll do these things because he has to, because he doesn’t know any other way to play his hand, and when he lays himself down to rest in the evening, he’ll put a palm to the wall between their rooms like he thinks that’ll
They pack up the actual freaking U-haul trailer Sam rented sometime before Dean woke up, and they steal a couple starter pieces of furniture from the bunker to tide them over until Dean and Cas can buy their own shit. Dean stubs his toe pretty hard on the front door while wrestling his mattress outside, and whines about it until Sam smacks him upside the head and calls him a wuss.
Cas’s hair is starting to curl. It’s grown long enough now that soft locks lick at the underside of his jaw and fall out from where he tucks them behind his ears, light brown in streaks where the sun has started to bleach them. He’s tan, too, all of a sudden; or maybe Dean’s just slow on the uptake, glancing up out of the blue to find a stranger coming into the house with a sun-warmed armful of tomatoes from the backyard and a smile that crinkles at the corners of his eyes.
This is what Dean knows: he never had a best friend until Cas. He’s got Sam, but that’s family, that’s a given; Cas keeps choosing him, over and over, no matter how many times fate or God or Dean himself pushes him away. If asked in his youth, this is not what Dean would have pictured his best friend being like, ancient and weird and objectively kind of funky looking, baffled by television and sarcasm and far too earnest as a default setting. He doesn’t get Dean’s references and his jokes are so strange, on the rare occasions they land, and his poker face is so obscenely bad it circles back around again to being impressive. His idea of a fashion upgrade is swapping out his trench coat for cargo shorts.
“I’m neither stupid nor a blind optimist.” Cas’s shoulders stiffen up even more, if it’s possible. “I just don’t want to make a home that doesn’t have a room for our son.”
As if broken out of a trance, Dean follows Cas and the kid down the steps.
“Looks like you are too,” Jade offers. “I’m sorry for your loss, man.”
There’s coffee waiting for him in the kitchen, just like Cas told him there would be. Dean can see the vague shape of him through the window, obscured by plants, dark hair and long tan arms visible through long stalks of green. He exhales slowly as he tests the tip of his tongue against his teeth. He doesn’t know why he still expected the flowers to be burned away to nothing outside.
The reapers are the only somewhat neutral party that they’ve ever met. But if not Heaven, then what? If not Hell, then where? Dean can’t wrap his mind around a world where he doesn’t have to end up in one of two places when he finally bites the dust. How the fuck is he supposed to operate if he doesn’t know what’s going to happen after?
Dean doesn’t really want to hear Cas keep talking about romance, but he’s always been the type to poke a bruise. “What’s that?” he asks. “Ner tamid.”
Cas had asked, after Dean had explained why he’d bothered to shorten it all those eons ago.
“Sam basically shooed us out yesterday while you were reading to the kid,” Dean says hoarsely. “Said he has it handled here."
“Sammy,” Dean calls out. “Last chance. You want me to stay?”
Dean’s jaw clenches so hard the joint clicks. “Right,” he says. “Good to know.”
Then he bothers to look out the window, and he fumbles to turn the stove off so fast he burns his wrist on the edge of the pan by accident. It takes him five long strides to exit the house, heart in his throat, throwing the screen door almost off its hinges in his hurry. Cas is rocking back and forth, crushing a smaller figure to his chest. Dean lurches to a stop a couple feet behind them.
That’s a decent question. Dean shrugs one shoulder, half his mouth twisting. “Trying not to think about Sam, I guess.”
“In a sense, very much so,” Cas replies. He smiles when he sees Dean approach. “Hello, Dean. Mr. Dexter is giving me a free jar of strawberry lime jelly.”
“Fuck, Cas,” he whispered.
Dean’s shoulders creep up toward his ears, as if that can cover the fact that he’s blushing. He’s been prodding the toothache of Cas leaving ever since he left, but he doesn’t usually try to run himself off the highway about it.
“Nope. Learned that one the hard way.” And with that, Sam leads them all further into the bunker — further, in fact, than Dean usually has reason to venture. The room made up for Zippy is down a set of stairs next to the library, which Dean is pretty sure used to be the room they kept Crowley trussed up in the last time they were enemies enough to hold him hostage. It’s since been transformed into a passable day room, walls given thick padding, plush carpet installed on the floor. Two beanbag chairs in the corner have been torn at the seams, stuffing strewn about, but the television set across the room and the old-ass VCR under it are unbroken. So are the handful of little-kid toys tossed in a milk crate next to a stack of picture books.
There’s a long pause, and when Dean finally makes himself look at Cas again, he’s unsurprised to find the angel’s eyes boring holes into Dean’s head.
Dean gets the same funny shiver up his spine that he always gets when he remembers just how old Cas is: old enough to have been there watching when the first stone was laid down to begin building the original Temple in Jerusalem, old enough to have put his hand on the foundation before the walls were built.
“Yes,” Cas says. Easy as that.
“We came to an agreement,” Jack continues. For the first time, Dean sees a shadow of exhaustion cross his face, and he wonders exactly how difficult that agreement was to come to. “No more Heaven, no more Hell, no more Purgatory. They’re making something new, and I... I don’t think it’s okay for one person to decide what that looks like. Even if it’s me.” He chews on his lip again. “Even if it’s us.”
“I always forget I don’t like this much,” he says. “You seem to enjoy it so thoroughly.”
“Hey, Dean.”
Sam turns back with his foot on the first step and smiles. “Go get Cas and rest up. Keep me updated on renovation stuff.”
with this shit, Sam.”
“I heard you,” Jack tells him. He’s grinning when he finally steps back. “You said to get here before the food got cold.”
“Do you realize,” Cas said, dangerously quiet, “How close you came to dying this evening?”
He dusts his hands off on his jeans when he stands up, looking over his work with a critical eye. The list of things he knows Cas likes is a short and weird one: bees and jelly, Beyoncé and Lizzo, untranslated ancient poetry in their original languages, clothes with pockets, and Dean. Well, Dean already bought him cargo shorts and jelly, and he puts the radio on for him while they drive with minimal complaint — he can give him this as well. He can give him bees to watch in his garden.
No such luck. Cas is reading at the kitchen table with a cup of tea at his elbow, chin in hand. Dean gets to watch in real time as worry crosses like a shadow over his face.
Cas, who had been reaching for the thermos, drops it mid-handoff. It bounces on the grass and rolls a couple feet away.
Cas nodded. Then he bent to kiss Dean’s chest, right between his surgery scars, dragging his mouth downward, and Dean felt a familiar warmth and pressure down to the core that meant Cas was healing him.
IKEA is stupid overwhelming, but Dean, at least, has the dignity of being the human ambassador to furniture retail, and as such does not have to worry about coming across like a dipshit. Cas is more than ready to accept his word as gospel, here, although he narrows his eyes at Dean’s shameless mispronunciation of Swedish words.
At least he isn’t aiming to hold hands and sing Kumbaya with every monster in North America. Dean rubs his forehead with the heel of his palm. “You should’ve told me.”
Because he’s dreaming, Dean can reach out and take Cas’s hand easy as anything. He laces their fingers together, squeezing, and watches the sun sink in a lazy arch toward the horizon.
it made Dean’s chest go all tight and strained every time on cue.
Cas pages open one of the books Sam gave him, shoulders all hunched up toward his ears. He’s so much more expressive with his body than he used to be — or maybe it’s Dean who’s changed, taught himself to read what each minute twitch and shift of Cas’s posture means. He’s been stealing sideways glances at him for twelve years, is it any surprise he can see him better now that he’s allowed to look at him head-on?
“I’ll tell you more later.” There’s a sound on the other end of the line, a door closing, Eileen’s voice. Dean can’t make out what she’s saying. “You can still call if there’s an emergency, but I gotta go, okay?”
Cas was focused on his eggs. He didn’t really need to join them, strictly speaking, but he always seemed half-starved for rituals no matter what they were, holy ones and boring human ones weighed with the same gravity. Praying and breakfasting were the same, for him. Dean watched him out of the corner of his eye.
The rental furniture is kind of tacky, but Dean turns to glance around the room and sees in his mind’s eye how he would change it. Add a sofa, some chairs. Maybe a recliner. Coffee mugs half-consumed and abandoned around the room, on the windowsill, on the little table, and it’s too easy by far to add all the people he loves to the image as well, Eileen and Claire and
“How much does this bad boy cost?” Dean asks, patting the mattress.
Dean swallows hard. Cas’s pinkie is touching the initials he carved. “That’s the idea.”
“Did you say something about breakfast?” Jack asks hopefully. “In your prayer?”
“Bring whatever you want to the counter, I’m checking out,” Dean called after him.
Mary Winchester had told Dean when he was small. In later years, it had come to feel more like a curse than a benevolent motherly wish, although it circled back around to being a blessing again sometime in 2009.
“Why do you insist on putting yourself in danger at every opportunity?” Cas asked, tipping his head to the side as he regarded Dean. “Haven’t you suffered enough?”
“I’m the one who gripped you tight and raised you from perdition,” Dean answers, pitching his voice down as low and gravelly as he can.
“Hey Cas,” he calls out.
Dean had kind of envisioned the Empty like human Hell, full of bodies suspended by hooks and chains. But angels aren’t embodied, really, they just look like they are because human brains are small and stupid. Dean sighs almost directly into Cas’s ear and hides his grimace behind his head.
He hates Cas a little for the way understanding blooms across his face. “He would have told us if it was an emergency.”
doesn’t seem small to him.
Dean’s hands went white around the steering wheel.
Dean grins. “Easy, cowboy, I wasn’t talking about the sex. You’re already thinking of next time?”
“Most things are.”
“I want a garden,” Cas says.
“I break out in hives every time you say that,” Dean complains.
“This is pleasant,” Cas murmurs. “I like it.”
He’s hyper-aware of Cas in the passenger seat once they’re on the road, especially with no Sam to act as a buffer between them. Dean kind of wants to ask about what the hell all that stuff had been last night, the spooning and whatnot, but he can't make the words come out. It was the best he’d slept since Cas had died, anyway, not that the bar was particularly high; it’s the first time in a long time where he hasn’t had at least a vague inkling of a nightmare nipping at his heels.
“Yeah?” Dean asks. "Worth committing to?"
It’s by mutual unspoken agreement that they avoid each other the rest of the morning. Dean grabs his tool kit and gives Baby an unnecessary tuneup, something to do with his hands that isn’t picking his fingernails to shreds. It only takes twenty minutes with a wrench under the hood before he feels kind of normal again, less like his pulse is trying to shudder right out of his throat.
The hood of the Impala is sun-warm and pleasant against the backs of Dean’s legs. Cas’s knee is another point of warm contact against his thigh, the two of them sitting close enough that they can’t help but nudge up against each other, elbow to elbow and hip to hip. Cas offers him a sip of coffee out of a thermos that Dean accepts.
“Okay,” he sighs, and hefts himself up to standing. Being on the wrong side of forty sucks — it takes real effort to heave himself onto his feet, body aching from the kind of drive that used to be a non-issue. And this is him still hopped up on Cas’s grace from the night before. He groans, twisting back and forth to crack his back in several sharp bursts.
“S’true. Didn’t pull my hair, either. But damn, didn’t even miss it,” Dean says, or maybe slurs a little, from alcohol and pleasure and fatigue. “Cas? Y’think I could stay, ‘night?”
Overall, it’s good. It’s really, really good, and Cas feels really fucking giddy.
-combo.
“Thanks, darlin’,” he drawls, and Cas feels a spike of annoyance already.
Maybe Charlie still has that secret stash of weed out here somewhere — he could really use a smoke, right now. She wouldn’t mind, if she knew the circumstances. And he can always just pay her back later.
The sun is almost down, bathing the backyard in a golden light that always makes the world feel a little magical.
It takes a while before the cooling come on their stomachs bothers them enough to make them move apart and clean up.When they head home in Cas’ car, for the first time so far, they both head to Dean’s place. For the first time, they get to fall asleep for the night next to each other, arms and legs tangled and hearts warm and bright.
He tries, for a while, to keep his eyes away from Cas, who is now absolutely covered in flour, smudges on his shirt, his cheek and nose, even dusting his hair. His hands are a mess of white powder, but they are also… so broad, and gorgeous, and they look so skilled, folding the dough.
Cas clears his throat, says, soft and a little embarrassed: “Thanks.”
Dean misses his last step down on his way to the mailbox and ends up stumbling along his driveway, cheeks burning up with embarrassment. He hopes Cas didn’t catch it, just keeps his eyes on the floor and swiftly walks towards his mailbox when —
Dean’s heart is racing and his hands start to shake, but his panic is interrupted by the loud ping of a phone, and when he looks up and across the counter, Cas is pulling his phone out of his front pocket and leaving smudges of flour on his jeans.
That’s how he finds himself opening Tinder, wondering how long it’s been since he last used the app. A month? Two? He hasn’t been feeling it, lately. But this is an emergency — or at least that’s what he has to tell himself.
He can feel Cas half-hard morning wood, pressing against Dean’s hip, but he doesn’t care. He doesn’t even give his own hardening cock a thought, just basks in the softness of this morning.
Even just bumping into him in the kitchen on his way to grab a beer, exchanging gruff “sorry”s before Cas hurries out of the room again.
Cas smiles, something cocky but gentle, and sinks down towards where Dean is rock-hard and straining against his blue boxers. Cas ducks down low, until his nose is buried in the soft fabric, so he can mouth along until he can wrap his lips around where Dean’s leaking so much, his precome is soaking through the fabric.
“Says you,” Dean grins, trying for cocky but ending up soft. And then his hands are back and pulling on Cas’ shirt, loving but insistent. “I want to see you, please.”
be awkward? “Maybe a friend will come by and visit me later, too. I hope that’s alright with you?”
And Dean’s eyebrows grow a little higher, but his smile doesn’t really falter either.
“I wasn’t sure — That’s very sweet, thank you, Dean,” Cas says, and his chest feels warm and fuzzy again. “I would love to stay for breakfast.”
Dean blames his desperation on all the weeks of pining, of shoving down his feelings and telling himself that it would never happen. He kisses Cas like has been aching to do for weeks, and Cas kisses back like he has been, too.
when teeth come into the mix, when Cas starts to carefully nibble on Dean’s nipple as if he’s done it a million times already, as if he knows exactly what to do to have Dean hard and aching, his brain reduced to jelly.
His heart does a flip again, hoping it might be Cas, and in his nervous excitement he gets up way too fast and hits his head on the table — hard.
Dean has to fist his hands in the sheets beneath him, has to bite his lip, curl his toes, to fight the overwhelming urge to move, to push up into Cas’ mouth. “Shit, Cas, how the fuck-” but before he can finish his babbling, Cas looks up at him, eyes wide and a little teary, and starts bobbing up and down on Dean’s cock.
“Yes, well. I thought you hated me too.” This time, his voice isn’t bashful at all, instead it almost sounds a little petulant.
He’s so hot, so tight around Dean, so goddamn soft that Dean is close to the edge in seconds, and the way Cas’ knowingly raises his eyebrow, as if in a challenge, doesn’t help at all. And then one of Cas’ hands comes down to tease his balls, the other one dances over his thigh, and just that contact would do him in, if it weren’t also for the way Cas swallows around him. And with that, with Cas’ throat constricting around his cock, Dean comes, hard and shaking up against Cas, hands cramping in the sheets.
Then he notices the light streaming through the windows, the clock by the entrance telling him that it’s 8 a.m. already. He fumbles for the remote by the bed, needs a while to study the buttons before he finds the right one and makes the top part of his bed move upwards so he’s sitting up slightly.
“Your breakfast is on this cart by your left,” a voice tells him, and Cas looks up to lock eyes with his roommate. “Gotta warn you though, that cheese-spread-thing tastes… not-nice.”
He reaches up to lock his phone when it suddenly vibrates against his palm and then —
It’s soft, so goddamn soft, Dean’s plush lips brushing against Cas’, tasting of salt. Just a press, and then Dean pulls back, only stopping briefly to bump their noses against each other gently.
“I know,” Cas answers simply, turning and grabbing the food from the trunk. “I just want to pamper you a little.”
Cas just tips his head back and laughs, ignoring Gabe’s imploring questions and one-handed (and thankfully rather half-hearted and unfocussed) attempts at stealing Cas’ phone.
“Wow,” he says, turning a little to press a kiss to Cas’ shoulder. “Holy shit.”
“Okay, then,” Cas stutters, when Dean doesn’t say anything for an awfully long-feeling minute. “I’m gonna — bye, Dean. Get well soon.” And then he stumbles out of the room. Shit.
“I would — please, yes,” he stutters, and then he doesn’t even have to care about the way his cheeks and ears burn, because Dean leans in.
Dean snorts, looking down somewhere towards Cas’ stubbly chin, and says: “This is pretty presentable to me.”
She pulls the curtain back open again, before she leaves, and Dean’s on the other side of the room, headphones in his ears and purposefully looking up at the ceiling.
Cas loves him. He wrestled Dean to the floor and pinned him there because that’s the only way Dean will sit still and stop picking a fight. He drinks all of Dean’s coffee in the mornings and sets the dinner table while Dean cooks in the evenings, and keeps trying beer even though he hates it, because he wants to like the things Dean does. He routinely falls asleep on the couch with a book on his chest and his feet in Dean’s lap with the television turned down low so as not to wake him. Cas is here, living in a house Dean is fixing from the ground up because — he is staying here through his grief because he —
Cas's smile is sweet and crooked. “Of course,” he says.
Sam’s mouth hung open for a second before he shut it. “So, like... together, together? Or —”
“I’m tired of this, man,” Dean says. He scuffs his foot on the ground, kicking a pebble. “I’m just fucking tired of it.”
“Save it, Cas.” Dean gulps the water in three swallows, then refills it. “What, you wanted to take an uber into town? Drive my ass home?”
Does he understand the implication of picking out a bed together, and what Jamie with a star must think?
Cas sighs low and thin. He touches Dean’s leg, close to his knee.
“Of course he is,” Jack says, frowning up at him. “He’s actually almost —”
“The Black Keys?” Dean demands. “Everlasting Light? You like this song?”
Cas pulls Dean’s hand into his lap, which is answer enough on its own. Dean likes the way he can feel the firmness and solidity of Cas’s thigh against the backs of his knuckles.
Also, consider the sparring match in this chapter my ode to saltyfeathers :)
“Don’t talk about it like that,” Dean rasps. “I’m not God. Don’t love me like I’m God.”
It’s weird as hell to see Cas dressed in normal-people clothes. He’s layered a borrowed v-neck from Sam under a flannel from Dean, blue and green, cool and muted colors. His slacks are the only part of his usual outfit that survived the Empty. Now he’s leaned up against the counter with his long sleeves rolled up to the elbows and he looks like the kind of guy Dean might see at the bars he goes to — he looks like a hunter.
Dean has to bite the inside of his cheek not to snap. “It’s your room,” he says after a beat. “And it’s our house, Cas.”
Understatement of the century. “Wasn’t I supposed to be the ideal Michael vessel, though?” Dean insisted. The words were so bitter on his tongue, even more so for the fact that he’d been holding back saying them for so long. “You coulda made me perfect.”
No, it would have to be something much more strange, something Dean would never anticipate. That’s one of the things he likes best about Cas, that he’s never exactly what Dean expects, even after all these years.
He’s been saying a lot of that, lately.
Dean laughs, helpless, and Cas just kisses the salt from his cheek when Dean’s laughter turns into a heaving sob that draws his belly tight as a bowstring. He jacks his cock and Cas’s a little faster. He’s going to come soon, he can feel it hovering just out of reach, toes curling behind Cas’s back as he tries to fuck himself onto Cas’s fingers.
“Whoa,” Dean murmurs. A frothy white flower he doesn’t recognize bumps up against his bent knee. “What’s this?”
“Follow me,” he says, and turns back to the horizon to lead Cas further out, trusting him to come along just ‘cause he asked. The lake gets deeper at a pretty steady incline. Dean can hear the splash and ripple of Cas’s body matching his pace, cutting through the eddies made in Dean’s wake.
Honestly, Dean kind of does. He could sit passenger side where Cas is now, and he could look his fill without crashing Baby into a ditch. Even crushed up close to the dashboard like Cas likes to sit, Dean knows he can relax with him at the wheel. He has before.
“You tellin’ me I was doomed from the start?” Dean asks breathlessly.
“Did it hurt?” he asks. He pokes a tulip head just to watch it sway back into place after.
“In the tub, buddy,” Dean murmurs, taking Cas’s elbow to help him step into the bath.
At least she doesn’t have her headphones in. If she’s still off by herself in half an hour, Dean will go over and irritate her until she gets pissed at him and rejoins the group out of spite.
Dean is three days into redoing the downstairs flooring, sweaty and frustrated and overall ticked off, so he’s only half listening. “Yeah, sure,” he says distractedly, wiping his forehead with the back of his hand.
okay? I needed some time to figure it out.”
He’s struck by a memory of a program he’d caught a couple minutes of one time while channel flipping in a motel, a nature special about wildlife caught in an oil spill. Dean pours shampoo into his hand and thinks about those small sad pelicans covered in black gunk, and the care with which their rescuers cleaned them.
Dean’s teeth ache in his jaw. The thunder comes much quicker this time, and it almost manages to swallow up Cas’s cry of Jack’s name. The storm is closer now. Cas is drawing it to them.
Cas looks at him sideways. “Out.”
It isn’t until he’s rinsed Cas’s face that he realizes just how haggard the guy looks, dark circles under his eyes and cracked, chapped lips. Dean wrings out the washcloth over the tub and gets more soap.
“Yes.” Cas looks at him again, and Dean is surprised to hear an audible waver in his voice. “You are worth worship, Dean Winchester.”
Cas kissed him hard when he came, and Dean let him, even though they ended up mostly just sharing the same air with their foreheads pressed together. As if this was as close as they’d ever been or could be. As if Dean could peek inside Cas’s head for once if he just concentrated hard enough.
Dean freezes. Shame, white-hot and familiar, coils up in his belly and makes his face color. “Uh,” he says. “I’m not, uh.”
Dean wonders, hands in his own pockets as he idly considers a fruit stall full of nectarines and peaches.
dude.” Shame makes Dean flush deeper. “Forget I asked.”
“Hey,” Dean says. He knows what he would be sore about, if it was him. “Sam and I were already thinking about getting a safe house set up separate from the bunker, anyway. This isn’t about you being an invalid.”
“Huh?”
Cas sticks his head through the garage door around lunch time, ruffled from his hair drying weird after their swimming adventure. Dean manages to look him square in the eye for a couple seconds before his gaze has to flicker away, back to the bolt he’s tightening.
Cas comes clattering out of the house eventually, dressed in jeans and his sturdy sneakers. It’s still jarring to see him not in his suit and trench coat, but Dean finds as he watches Cas get into the car that he misses the glimpse he got of that pale ankle.
Dean watches, dumbfounded, as she stalks past all of them with Lilah still riding piggyback, claws folded carefully around her sister’s legs so that she won’t nick her. He lets go of his gun one finger at a time.
The lead Sam had researched at the library turned out to be a promising one, so they packed their shit up to leave in the morning. Sam sat at the dinner table and made huge, jaw-cracking yawns until Dean thwapped him with a rolled-up dish towel and told him to go to bed.
“And you keep wasting it on my bad dreams?” he rasps. Cas’s knee is copper-stained, partially cleaned. It isn’t a deep scrape, just long. Dean’s steady hands are trembling. “It’s your
