"I'm hallucinating."
"I enjoy it because you can deduce so much about someone from the gifts they give. It's an exquisite study in human behavior. As is Valentine's Day." Sherlock sat up, leaning his arms on his knees. "I suppose the same could be said for Halloween. People's choice of costume must be very telling."
Religious people really didn't know the meaning of salvation.
It hung there between them, all they weren't saying, the elephant in the room that was that fevered kiss in Rome. Both of them were pretending like it had never happened, but both of them were painfully aware that it couldn't be avoided indefinitely.
“I would ignore your questions and move on.”
.” John did his best to ignore the tone in her voice, and on a certain level, he felt like he couldn't take the snide remarks away from her. After all, she had a right to be mad with him, didn't she? But why did she feel the need to do this, to pick at all the tiny details of his now very comfortable life? What did she want from him? He almost said he was sorry, because he was, a little, at the way things had gone between them. It wasn't every day a woman loses her boyfriend to a man returned from the dead. But even aware of that as he was, he still couldn't wrap his head around why she would even want to be here.
But was John aware? Or was he so certain and steadfast that he couldn't see what felt like glaring insecurity badly masked by sarcasm? Sherlock was beginning to believe that many people knew what was going on in his head, but didn't bother to tell him. Was John one of those people, too? If so, didn't he see Sherlock as rather desperate and pathetic?
Standing up straight he looked across at Sherlock as Mike moved forward to look down at the picture. Sherlock held John’s eyes and then sighed as he crossed his arms his eyes darkening as he read John clearly.
"You know why."
"Thank you Martha."
"I'm dying." The deep voice suddenly whispered.
Standing Coffey makes his way over and sits down.
She stood, brushing her skirt and straightening her jacket as she walked back to her desk. As the two men left she lent against the solid wood before her, her eyes closed as she held back her own feelings. John was still unstable, his change in emotional state an instant thing. Yet today was progress, today she saw him truly happy for the first time since being here. But at the end he regressed, going back to the place he had been in for so long. Her job now was to prevent that. To teach him to move forward and to not go back, to not trap himself in the state he had becone so use to. Once she had done that, then they could go home.
"Good, so do that through all of this and I will get us out of this."
“Pupil reaction good, oxygen levels good, everything is good.”
"Yes." This was John, stood a good distance away, but still there. "He needs a milky tea with a hell of a lot of sugar."
"He's on his way."
“No, but its seems to have gotten worse since you arrived.” John turned and headed to the control room not so much as looking at Sherlock as he left.
(10:03am)
Laying Johns head onto his lap Sherlock ran his fingers gently through John's greying hair, the strands soft on his fingers. He had no idea what had happened, what had caused this reaction in John even as something told him that he should know.
"See, you can leave. You're free."
"I'll try." John finally answered turning to Sherlock as Sherlock looked up causing their lips to brush and a smile turning up both their lips.
Sherlock's next move was fast, a hand came up to hold the back of John's head, while the other grabbed his wet jumper at his hip and then those lips, god those lips, so soft so full, were on his in what could only be called the hottest kiss of John's life.
"You know i don’t do that anymore! Not since before we met."
Sherlock sat frozen. He had known that John had developed a deep sentimental feeling for him, but he had started to think it a lie. After all John wasn’t real, he was fake, a persona the man before him had made up. Yet here this man was claiming to love him no matter what form he took.
"You remember?" John asked, his fingers absently running over Sherlock’s arm.
"How did it go?" John asked quietly.
"No." John shook his head. "He doesn't. He jumped, he killed himself, he left me..." His voice caught and for the first time in weeks tears stung his eyes. "He left...he died...he...he...lied to me...all this time it was a lie!"
"Not unusual in a girl of this age John."
.~.~.~.~.
"No it's fine, you can have one ice chip, but you have to let it just melt no um...no sucking." John picked up another chip and placed it against Sherlock’s lips. "Open."
“James?” This was Maddie but still John refused to look away.
The four looked at each other and came to a silent agreement.
"What?" John asked knowing that smile all too well.
"No, I just assumed. I mean you are dealing with his medical care and you haven't left his side since he came in. You treat him as though you...you care for him."
"John, you ground me."
Once done she gave herself once over in the mirror, thanking her foresight in minimal makeup, and running her fingers through her hair to tame the curls before heading into the living room to find her dress.
His crew, though happy with the triple pay rise, were not too keen on the whole thing, but needs must and they had left their drilling field behind with only a few hundred feet left to go.
John felt sick, his head spun and then he was on the pavement holding a wrist with no pulse.
John shook his head and placed his hand over his closed eyes.
"Thank you. I'm off to grab a coffee and possibly some food, but I will let you know what is happening as soon as I know."
"No, but he crashed twice on the table, after the second time we made the choice to bag him and let him build up so strength before we try again."
“Good. Sherlock, try and sleep, it will help.”
“It is all just transport John; I can control it.”
"I know." Sherlock sounded panicked as the smile left his face. "I know, and I'm so-"
"Yes." John again answered, this time as he brought the tea, giving one mug to Cathy and placing Sherlock’s on the coffee table before retrieving his own mug and sitting on the sofa by Sherlock’s feet.
“Breathe Sherlock. You need to breath.”
"Tell me what I can do with you, what you will be comfortable with."
The man just laughed. "Of course I do Sherlock! That's my role here, my role to keep you safe, to keep you calm and to keep you from causing yourself more harm! It's the role you made for me."
“‘s fine.”
"Oh?"
"How long has he been clean?"
Lestrade felt his heart beating hard and fast, he was a cop, sworn to protect no matter what and before him were two men, one a criminal mastermind, the cause of so much death and pain, the other an agent who was completing his mission; save the man he had sworn to protect.
“Morning Sherlock.” He whispered and placed a gentle kiss to the pale forehead before stand up straight and turning back to Mary. “I’m just going to-“
"Because this is linked to what you left unfinished."
"Sherlock has explained that you have both ran into issues when it comes to advancing your relationship to the next level."
"Well this sucks."
“John.” Sherlock grasped at John’s hand, his hold tight to the point it was almost painful.
"What about the case?"
Sherlock winced slightly as he shifted. "Not totally pain free."
"Hey." He forced through his dry throat as he took in Sherlock’s worried eyes.
"It's okay John, you can be human when dealing with your partner."
Also blame them for the end of this chapter, I never expected this to happen!!!
"Is that a problem?"
But John could keep him safe, could save him, could help him, he just needed to trust him. But first he needed to help himself.
Leaning in closer, he brushed back curls to find the pale skin he had been sure that glowed earlier and to eyes that were open and watching him.
John lent away. “Dear god.” He muttered as he took in the image of the wrecked train, bodies led all around and him knelt over Sherlock.
"Well Maddie, I'm going to do everything I can to get us out of here. But I will need your help.
(See the end of the chapter for
.~.~.~.~.
.~.~.~.~.
Anyways, you never asked me to come. Why didn't you ask? Please explain that to me. Cathy said it's because I'm not ready...I know that, but still you could have...asked.
"Here, put this on." John handed him his blue robe which he took and put on, all the while staring at John.
White lights flashed behind his eyes as the pain increase and then was gone as though it was never there.
John’s voice was steady calm, blood covered his hands, it spattered him face, stained his clothes.
"No, its good, this is all good." John answered as he smiled brightly, something he hadn't done in a very long time.
John blinked at him a few times before letting go of Sherlock’s hand with some reluctance and nodding his thanks before leaving.
"Yeah, Jen, nice woman."
Coming to a stop at the open back door he took in the man inside, curls a mess, sweat beading on his forehead and running down his neck, skin pale almost grey as the panic attack took control.
He was at this moment in time sat on the cold concrete floor, the cage having no bottom and the only reason it stayed put was because it had been bolted to the floor.
"What is it?"
.~.~.~.~.
He is totally stunned by what he sees, is at a loss to what he was viewing and just blown away by the beauty of what was before him.
John nodded, he knew what it was, he knew the dangers not only to Sherlock but to those around him as well, but Sherlock couldn't be admitted into anything.
John frowned, his heart shouting at him to say yes! Yes I want that, I want to go home, back the place that is ours. But his mind rebelled, it informed him that they were both still unstable, still lost, still healing and that would take time, so much time.
“Yeah, and he is here, in the hospital.” Sherlock nodded.
“I may not have been able to find this Moriarty, I have however been able to find out quiet a bit about him.” Mycroft held out the file to John, which he took and started to glance over what was within.
"Curiosity and all that." The lead marine said, Russell or Crofton or something, he never was good with useless names, but as he looked at the man and really just allowed himself to read everything he made a point to learn his name and not forget it. Something about him already read as dangerous to Sherlock but at the moment he couldn't work out why.
John frowned.
"Yes. We need to try and control this as muxh as possible."
"You have your own resources as well as the yard, you don't need me."
“Do I really have to spell it out Mol’s?”
“I can extend that.” Sherlock looks back to John his clear eyes holding John’s. “There’s some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module. I'll have to go outside to tie onto them.”
"We always are."
“Try and get more sleep Sherlock.”
"I want-" Sherlock started then stopped, biting his lip, an action John had never seen him do before.
Sherlock is walking towards the control room when the whole rig shifts sending him into the wall. Grasping at anything to keep himself up right he looks up with wide eyes just as John comes tearing down the corridor his eyes catching Sherlock’s for a second before he passes him and storms into the control room just as Molly’s voice comes over the com.
"Thought that would be your answer." MaCormick indicated to Sherlock. "Kill him."
“Do you want to run yet?” Sherlock’s voice cut through his thoughts causing him to look down at him
John stood at the back folding his arms across his chest, part of him knowing that Sherlock had moved to the other side of the room to watch the news broadcast.
"It's diffrent." John sighed.
Falling to his knees he quickly found the man's neck and pressed his fingers to the pulse point.
“What was it?” Coffey asked again.
"How?" Sherlock looked up. "Ah...you killed him."
“We believe so.” Mycroft nodded. “He gets off the train as you get on it in a few stops time.”
"Sherlock do you remember?" She askes instead of answering John.
"Got you cab three." Dimmock said his eyes finding John’s. "Who is that? That you Sherlock?"
"Okay...need...ahh...damn it. Phone, need a phone." Turning he looked at the dead MaCormick a few feet away. Getting up again he went to the dead criminal and searched his pockets, finding a phone in his inside jacket pocket. Pulling it free he made his way back over to his friend and sat next to him.
They had both showered, separately, had a cup of tea and then went back to bed. They had both been fully clothed at that point but by the time they had fallen asleep all that was left was their pants.
"John is here, he save your life." Mycroft looked to John and nodded slightly yo the other side of the bed, indicate for John to stand there.
The sound of the paper being read broke the silence as nimble fingers gently turned the page and then settled as eyes ran over the words of an article relating to unease in the east. Smiling slightly Mycroft shook his head, if the media knew any of the truth about any unease in any country they would all probably seize up and die. His media team however were very good at making sure only the barest of information got out. As for the Prime Minister, he was an excellent actor and completely worth the money. His portrayal of a total idiot pleased Mycroft to no end and kept the public talking about his total lack of skill and leadership rather than focusing on any real issue.
“No…I don’t think he was.” Shifting his attention from the man he looked around him, at the people around him, then paused as a grey suit flashed through the window on the door that led to the next cab, then dark eyes looked straight at him.
He listened as John walked back inside soon followed by the sound of the kettle being switched on. Sighing he took another drag, blowing the smoke up into the night sky.
The two of them remained silent for a time, John just enjoying the view and the feel of having his best friend so close.
Silence followed for a while, he could feel Sherlock shaking as he tried to verbalise what had happened and John almost caved, almost told him that he didn't have to tell him anything. But Sherlock needed this, he needed to tell John because he would never tell this to anyone else.
“Mike, you tie onto this manifold. There's some tanks on the other side; I'm going to check them out.”
"Yes I really said that."
“Yes, now be sure to apologise to John when you wake. He will be mad at you.”
Sherlock knew it was the best thing to do, they couldn't stay on the floor like this, but he finally had John in his arms and he just couldn't let go. Tears came unbidden as he again tightened his grip.
"Is everything okay John?" She asked with a smile.
The door opened suddenly causing Sherlock to halt mid-swing, but it didn’t stop his movement as he dropped the extinguisher and pushed passed Schoenick and glare at Coffey.
"Can we? Like this?" John asked threading his fingers through dark curls.
“Once we are home, once we are back to being, us. Then yes I will tell you, not everything, but I will tell you.”
The klaxon on the bridge blares before being shut off.
Where was he?
“Morphine. He hasn’t had any since we tried to wake him.” Mary explained.
"In the second bedroom." Sherlock said as he put in the first film.
"I have loved him far longer than even I realised." She smiled at this.
“Leave Sherlock, go do what you have to do.”
Turning he made his way back towards the ward, he could get another coffee later. Right now he just needed to get back to Sherlock, needed to make sure he was okay, still breathing, still asleep.
"Most...just-" Blood suddenly bubbled on the man's lips and John just brushed his thumb over it, brushing it away, but when the man started to talk again John saw his mouth was full of it. "They just...tell me to...piss off."
"Okay...are you hurt?" John asked, knowing he probably was, but John had yet to look.
“Do you think it could have been what spooked Dimmock.” John asked from where he stood.
The nurse at the end of the bed suddenly shifted causing John to notice her for the first time. He looked at her, taking in her blonde hair and deep blues eyes before she smiled at him causing him to realise he was staring.
Ari started to move her hand again, this time moving it in rhythm to John, up as he pulled out, down as he pushed in and before long Sherlock was an incoherent buddle of nerves. Ari knew that giant mind of his had finally switched off, all that was left was pure physical being, of knowing nothing other than pleasure and she loved knowing she was apart of it.
"I'm not ticklish." Sherlock answered, but walked around to the otherside of the bed and climbed in.
"Stop being a baby Watson, you've had worse!" He reprimanded himself before lifting his head and listening.
"He's not ready."
John opened his mouth to say something when Molly suddenly appeared, slightly out of breath and rather excited about something.
“ You.” Coffey points to Sally, totally ignoring Sherlock’s words. “Why haven't you finished repairs on the hydrophone transmitter yet?”
"I'll be back or will send another over when I can."
Sherlock stayed still, waiting for John to settle, then moved his hand up to cover John's back, while his other hand ran over the arm across his middle.
"Brilliant, the storm is about twelve hours out, should give you guys enough time to get down to the sub and back again. We should be able to unhook the umbilical when you get back."
With that Mycroft left, heading up to the surgical ward.
"All a lie. I have been lied to for so long, now I dont know why I am still surprised when I learn about it."
"You alright Dimmock?"
"Because you can't be."
It started slowly, the crystal eyes cleared, they focused on the room around him then on John. What colour Sherlock had gained started to drain from his face, leaving him once again grey and sickly looking.
"Have you been tested?"
"Now rest." John ordered as he pulled away.
He found no missing or broken limbs, no wound to his back or head. From this position the man looked totally unharmed. Going back to look at the man, John once again pushed back curls.
"I'll come." He said, the words heavy as they left his lips.
John took a breath and started to move the man's arms and legs so that is was easier to turn him. Once he was done he looked back at him.
"It is real."
"Okay...here is what needs to be done. You may be stopping the bleeding at this moment in time, but gravity will be working against us, and pretty soon you will start to bleed out unless I get you onto your back. I don't think you have broke your back or neck, you still have complete feeling." The man blinked, indicating that he did. "Okay, so I need to turn you."
"We will have to okay it with John first."
"What the hell do you think you are doing!" Mycroft shouts storming around to the other side of the bed and pulling John from Sherlock.
“John. John. Damn it John!”
It had gone wrong. The whole plan had unraveled the moment Moran had cut the power, had blocked all coms and had gotten to Sherlock and John in record time.
"None opioid analgesic. Not as strong as an opioid based one, but it helps to take the edge off."
“No….no….nonononononono.”
“What happened?” John asked as he gently ran a hand up and down Sherlock’s back.
“Say what you want to, what has been on the tip of your tongue since you met me, since we got back, since you found out Moriarty was dead. Say it.”
“Thank you.” He finally whispers as Mycroft walks to the door to let himself out.
Cathy nodded then turned her attention back to Sherlock. "You jumped?"
"Right now? Anything."
"Right, sorry. It's just I pretty sure they will want to know if things don't go right."
John's face changed instantly and he slowly stood, making sure to cover what he had pulled out of Sherlock’s pocket with his foot.
“I think it likes you.” John whispered into Sherlock’s ear which sent a whole different kind of shiver down his spine.
"Right. We just need to allow him to rest before we try. His body has been through far too much in the last twenty-four hours and a few more hours at the level of sedation we have him on will not hurt."
"Victor. His name is Victor."
"Police, what is your emergency?"
"You. You, the man who is undoubtedly going to be the love of my life. You, the missing part of me that I had no idea had been missing till I found it. You, the man that caused me to live once again. You, just you Sherlock." Getting up from the bed he moves the table with the laptop allowing him to kneel before Sherlock. This was the first time Sherlock would have to look down at John and for John to look up, but it would not be the last, after all Sherlock was so much taller than John.
"No, no more." John said as he gave in and slowly sat up. Reaching out he picked up the mug of tea, his free hand tugging on the sleeve of the dressing gown, knowing Sherlock watched his every move.
"I don't know John, we never spoke of things like that." John could hear the fear behind the false calm.
Standing John took the vile, holding it up to look at it. “I thought it was a cure.”
When they made it into the building, they offered to take his coat, he refused, they offered to take his scarf again he refused. He needed them.
Lifting his head back up he looked at the plain door with wide eyes as the room went cold and dark.
"Oh." Sherlock sounded as his eyes closed at the contact.
Sherlock tried to keep his beating heart under control, but he was sure that disappointment showed on his face because John laughed slightly.
John blinked, coming back to himself.
"They...oh god John, it hurts, it hurts, please..."
"I've not worn mine for months." He said letting go of John’s hand and turning on his heal.
"Thing's change."
"Ready...right...one...two..." John moved Him and turned him onto his back. A small scream of pain left the man's lips and long pale fingers lifted and pressed to his chest. "Oh...fuck." John pulled off his coat and quickly bundled it up and pressed it hard to the man's  abdomen causing another scream of pain. "Sorry, I'm so sorry."
"Umm....he is stable. He will need you, so you better sort yourself out."
Since the torture Sherlock seemed unbalanced, his thinking was slow, his observations lacking, and he was having trouble accessing his mind palace, something John only picked up a few hours ago when he watched as Sherlock tried to think but only became frustrated as he failed over and over again.
“It’s a story that needs telling after a good night’s rest and a hell of a lot of painkillers.”
Smiling he lowers the camera as his lights come back on, Little Geek floats back up, its lights flooding the area around him as Mike appears and their coms switch back on.
Stacy jumped up as Mycroft stood and John read off the monitor.
"And you need to today?"
“Sherlock? Sherlock I need you to just breath norm-“
“Yeah.” John looked at Mary as she pushed something into an IV port.
"Mycroft?"
"I miss you."
The bars were cold as he lent his head against them, his eyes wanting nothing more than to close, to sleep. But he couldn't, he wouldn't. Not while Sherlock curled up into himself, shivering hard from pain and cold.
“You are out there.”
As he went to attack Mark she pulled out a pack of sedatives she kept on her and preped it as Mycroft wrapped his arms around Sherlock, holding him close and steady.
Sherlock tries to speak, but his throat is dry and all that emerges is a croak. He frowns and John laughs too hard at the familiar expression. John fetches a glass of water from the table and lifts Sherlock enough for him to take a few sips.
"Ask Cathy about a morning meeting. We could have breakfast together...in the conservatory...if you want."
Turning to his night stand he picked up his watch.
“I wasn't thinking about Irene Adler.”
“What have you been doing?”
Sherlock grew more concerned. “Did I do it wrong?”
KR: What about context for the work itself? Or authorial intent?
“Why do you say that?”
The Neruda sonnet ran on loop in his brain to the point of obsession. He somehow answered another half hour of questions while thinking only about the third stanza. Was this what living felt like? He was approaching a manic energy he hadn't felt in years, an inexplicable high. Could the audience members tell, like Ella surely could? Did it matter if they could?
“I know.”
Kiss me.
Sherlock led John back away from the falls' edge, his hand on his back. He still had the gun in his other hand, and he almost dropped it in the water when he realized.
world back.”
Their heads turned as the doors opened and Mike walked through them. He smiled, but his smile faded as he saw Sherlock, coat open, revealing the outdated clothes.
Sherlock's eyes followed the flash of movement, of John coming down into the hollow, hazy behind the wall of fog. When he reached the forest floor, he stopped, whirling around, gun in hand, trying to find a predator that was always hiding just out of sight. His eyes were growing wilder by the moment. The other tributes didn't even seem to know John or Sherlock were there.
“What? You thought I would leave? Not speak to you again?”
He paused, hand in midair and blood pouring down the side of his face, wishing he had more time for a better plan. But his fight or flight response screamed in his head, his body refusing to play second to his mind this time.
But abruptly, Sherlock jerked away, realizing what he had done. John had never seen eyes so filled with fear, and for a moment, Sherlock seemed incapable of even the slightest movement, frozen like someone who had stumbled across a vicious predator.
John glanced back up at her, annoyance returning. Logically he knew that anyone would be angry in her position. But still he wanted to lead her to the door and not speak to her for a while. It was problematic. She was a decent person, really didn't deserve to be caught in the Sherlock Holmes fallout, and John probably
"Greg’s on the line boss." Dimmock shouted and then patched the call to John's monitor.
"Can you accept my crazy?" John asked softly.
"Fine." Sherlock fell back onto the grass, his head that close to John's that his hair tickled the side of his face.
The two messages he had listened to had involved a lot of shouting, cursing, crying and just John getting across just how he was feeling at this moment in time. So when the third message was left he found himself unable to listen, to hear what John needed to tell him, to listen to the pain in his friends voice, the heartache in his words.
"I won't take you with me."
John stood still just listening, before he started to make his way through the people, once again searching. He was close to were the man had been standing when something grabbed his leg.
Just a thank you for every kudo, bookmark, subscribe and comment they all mean so, so much to me they really do keep me inspired :D
"He didn't want help." Moran said and though John wasn't looking he could practical feel the other man shrug.
Sherlock liked John’s voice. It was nice, soothing, warm, even when filled with concern. “Sherlock, my name is Sherlock.”
John smirked but didn't move. "The great Sherlock Holmes asking one of life's most idiotic questions, I think my day has just become a hundred times better."
"Moriarty has us."
“This ain't no drill, slick.” John said with a smile. “Make me proud.”
"Yeah. Bullet graze to the left upper arm, and bullet wound to the right lower side, no exit wound." As he moved his coat he heard Greg gasp and then the world tilted dangerously. "Damn..."
"John." The woman stood, she slowly made her way over to him, but never got too close. He had a protective distance he liked others to stay out, she knew this, she respected this, had she told Sherlock though? Had she told how he hated to be touched? How he hated anyone to be too close? How he hated to be stared at? Had she told the man that would be entering this room in minutes how he hated all of it?
Back by the moonpool, John careful lowers the hoses attached to the two divers, keeping his eye on them while also passing tools to Sally as she sees to fixing Cab one as it hangs from a overhead crane.
Frowning at that, Sherlock moves Cab One along the flank of the enormous sub, while Flatbed and Cab Three move above it.
"Then we ration." John said, though he had no intention to allow Sherlock to feel more pain than he had to, he, John, would just cut back so that Sherlock could have what he needed.
"Yeah...yeah I heard. Heading back to Flatbed now."
"I hate you." Sherlock only half joked.
"Oh." Sherlock stumbled, Mycroft was before him, holding him up in an instant.
Then lights had gone out. That wasn't meant to happen, was it?
"He needs me. He has always needed me. I keep him right, keep him steady. And he does the same for me. Just let us deal with this our way."
Greg steels himself, then reaches down pulling Moriarty from the pit. John gets himself out and helps to move the half unconscious man to the cardboard.
"Why-"
"Why would I tell you Watson?"
John was fed up, his day had been long, boring, and all he wanted was to get home have a shower and then possibly find some silence in the bottom of his whisky bottle. Life had taken a turn for him when he had gotten himself shot, it put an end to his career not only as an army doctor but as a surgeon. His hands were his tools, made him what he was, but now he was nothing, just a man, on the train, wanting to get home and just sleep.
John stood fully and just held Moran's hard eyes. When the time came, John knew it would be hard, he knew he would have to get through Moran to get out and it would probably be the last thing either of them did.
She stood then walking to her mini kitchen in her office and making both her and Sherlock a drink while the two of them took the time to calm down. When she returned she held out a mug of coffee to Sherlock, who took it, greatful to do something with his hands.
anyways enjoy :)
Right now John was scraping away at the floor, digging around the bolts holding his cage down. His tool, a two-inch nail that somehow had found its way into Sherlock’s pocket. He never got to ask how the man had come to having it with him or how he had hidden it from Moriarty’s men, especially Moran. But he had and for that John was grateful, because it gave him hope of escape, even if it took a week.
John had walked out half an hour earlier leaving Sherlock and Cathy alone, leaving Sherlock feeling lost, stupid and incapable of hiding.
Sherlock sucked in a lung full of air before turning to look at John fully.
"No idea." John took Sherlock’s hand and led him down the hall. "Come on."
The light slowly moved across the floor till it reached the bed and then moved up the covers, up across Sherlock’s leg that had escaped the covers in the night, up to his hips, covered in the red boxers John had given him, till it reached his back, the vast expanse of pale skin warming in the light of the sun.
"Try?" It was very much a question, he knew Sherlock wouldn't force him to do anything, but he would always ask him to try.
"Kill him, kill John Watson and find out just exactly how far I will go to make your life a living hell."
When John got into his flat he looked down at his hands. He had left his shopping on the pavement, the only thing he had was the tin of rice pudding Sherlock had given him.
"How do you know so much about me?"
"You woke me." Sherlock sounded horse, his throat damaged from all the screaming. "Water?"
When his eyes opened, the first thing he saw was a tail wagging, soft red fur, a black nose and happy eyes.
"Right, let me just gather my stuff." She said as she stood and grabbed both John’s and Sherlock’s file from her desk.
“What is about to happen will not be pretty, it will not be easy and it will defiantly involve a lot of blood and screaming.”
"No!" Sherlock suddenly shouted from next to him causing John to jump from the bed, an intruder expected to be the cause of Sherlock’s shout. But only the empty space of the bedroom greated him.
"Yeah, can’t help it." John said with a shrug as Sherlock looked at him a small smile on his lips.
“Indeed.”
“I do understand, I’ve always understood. You needed to do this without me because you couldn’t do it with me. You needed to fake your death, to make me watch, to make me truly believe that you had died. But I found out, I worked it out and then I got Mycroft to confess. Did he ever tell you that? That I made him tell me everything?”
John heard Mycroft swear and leave the room instantly.
John smiled, "Oh really?"
"Now Sherlock!" John demanded grabbing the bars of his cage.
“You and I both know that’s not true.” John sighed happily as his brain continued to work on what it was he was going to do once he was free. “You know that I will get out, in fact, you’re planning on it.”
“These things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench! Trust me... they're not speaking Russian.” Sherlock mutters though its loud enough for everyone to hear.
"I... forgive me? I just never found myself being...wanted like this before."
“Okay?”
"Right, turn over and sit up." Sherlock ordered as he came to John's side of the bed. He watched with a smile as John slowly did as he was told and once sat up he raised his arms allowing Sherlock to pull his jumper off.
“Yes... I mean no. Negative, sir.” Coffey gets out shaking his head and stealing himself against what it was they now had to do.
“It’s okay. It’s fine, your safe and it will all be okay.”
So this is a super short chapter, but it can not be any longer as the next two, possibly three chapters will be rather long. So enjoy, and I hope you all stick with me till the end.
Tears suddenly blurred John's vision.
“Understandable.”
"No, okay look. I'm a-"
"Fuck that!" John grounded out through gritted teeth as he tightened his grip on Sherlock's wrist.
"I seem to have developed a you, inside my mind, that is helping to piece things together."
"Sounds good." John says.
"Nice to finally put a name to the sub." John said his arms crossing over his chest.
"More like Mycroft bought you out cheap."
"I felt as though my job was done." She smiled keeping her hands by her sides.
"I'll be waiting." The line went dead leaving Sherlock feeling cold in the warm night air.
The tears now fell unchecked as he lent his head against Sherlock’s.
"Nothing." This was from the doctor. "Our best hope is he passes out."
When he opened his eyes he fell back onto the bed even though he knew he wouldn't back to sleep he just couldn't bring himself to get up. Getting up would involve facing another day, of facing John, facing the truth of not just his own pain but John's as well.
"When was that orginised?" John askes trying hard to hide his panic from his voice.
Sherlock helped John to his feet then led him to the spare bedroom. However as he opened the door, John paused then turned to the other room.
"Hello Martha." He said with a smile but his hand clasped behind his back.
"As well as decent sleep."
"John." Cathy warned. "There are innocent people here."
John smiled, a small laugh escaping him. It was always nice hearing Sherlock surprised.
"He's worse than you. He only sat down to read his paper fifteen minutes ago. He's been talking to his brother for the rest of the time."
"More." She gasped looking at them both.
“Sherlock stop!” John shouted but Sherlock’s scream drowned out his voice even to his own ears.
Sherlock knew at once what John implied. Baker Street was central London. It wasn’t cheap. He was impressed that John had observed that he worked at the coffee shop.
"Am I attractive to you?" She asked simply, her dark hair curling around her shoulders, eyes light green, skin pale, she knew she looked like Sherlock.
Standing John took the few steps between them then lent down and whispered in his ear.
Warning for talking about rape and torture.
Sherlock was shaking as he stood with his back to the wall, his chest tight as he tried to mask his frantic breathing.
“Keep trying.”
"Sherlock, if you can hear me please just at least move something."
“Are we talking about aliens here?” Mike’s voice sounded, taking John by surprise not know that he too followed.
"Me...that was me."
As it was, she was with John for fourty minutes. As she opened the door she turned to Sherlock then looked back into the room.
John was asleep when Sherlock finally opened his eyes, it was early morning, a nurse had just left after taking Sherlock’s stats. It had been the blood pressure test that had caused him to become aware of the waking world.
"Bed." John said holding out a hand.
John glanced at Greg an eyebrow raised.
"Army doctor my ass. This is like some sort of special..." he paused and really looked at John. "Shit, how the fuck did I miss that?"
"I missed something." Sherlock finally said his eyes widening
“So we have a few hours.”
Moaning and cries started to fill the carriage as people came to, as they started to feel, as the adrenaline subsided and the pain hit full on.
"Yes." The Man pushed away from the wall walking up to Sherlock and placing a hand on his arm, the dull ache disappearing completely. "I know you don’t trust me, meaning you don’t trust yourself, but this is all a good thing, a very good thing."
"No John."
"So you have spoken about sexual acts that the both of you are comfortable with?" Cathy asked looking to John then to Sherlock who had found himself heating up at the line of questioning.
“You have kept him at bay thus far, but that may not last much longer.” Mycroft says as he picks up his bag and pulls out a file.
By this point Sherlock was unconscious but it didn’t stop John from talking.
John turned to look at Moriarty with anger.
Getting up off the bed he walked to the window, his image reflected back at him for a moment, showing him still dressed in his suit trousers, his shirt still tucked in and his tie long gone. His hair was slightly messy and though he felt as though he should look a mess he instead looked good.
But throughout the whole talk all he could think about was Sherlock. He was in some room within the hotel doing who knew what and John had no idea what he could do, either to help or to ignore.
"Wake me up!" Sherlock demanded.
“What…no…” Sherlock started then shook his head as he realised what John was trying to do.
"Yes, hence the mess we currently find ourselves in. Look after him, take him home and fix it!"
"Three weeks Sherlock!"
“Monk, Schoenick... secure the package.” Coffey ordered.
"Come home with me, please." John begged pulling Sherlock closer, his head burying itself against Sherlock’s neck. "Please, please come home with me."
Glaring for a moment John finally let himself slump. Everything had been a lie, it had started two and a half years ago, when would it end?
He felt the tears roll down his face but had no idea that his words were said out loud, that Sherlock was watching with stunned eyes and that the small sharp pain in his neck was a sedative that brought on the darkness that he went into willingly.
John felt something slip into place.
What the hell was going on?
"Agreed." John mimicked Sherlock’s tone perfectly causing Sherlock to roll his eyes.
John's heart stops "What?"
“You’re right, I don’t. All I want to know is when the hell you going to get it off what is mine!”
"No." She looked down at the file again. "John is being funded privately, hence my presence."
"But?"
John shifted as Sherlock dropped his hand, both of them turning their attention to the other man.
He shouted at himself as he found a knife, the stupid idiots had left a knife.
“Sherlock?” The voice came from the wall. “Sherlock I felt that!”
So what happened?
"I..."
"Christen!!" Moran shouted and Christen let go allowing John to gasp in pain as he tried to curl up into himself, to protect his side.
Stopping his pacing he stood at the end of John's bed. John was awake, his eyes open, his head turned to the side as he just stared at the wall not giving any attention to Sherlock.
With renewed determination he went back to scrapping at the floor, digging down and down till he finally reached the bottom of the first bolt. Smiling, he made sure to dig all around the bolt making sure it was free before he gathered the dust he had formed making sure to fill in the hole he had made, hoping to hide what he had done.
"Right." Sherlock nodded then looked around.
"Right."
“Listen, I’m a doctor, I can help.”
She knew when it happened because Sherlock bucked forward and from that moment John was in charge. As he fucked Sherlock ass, Sherlock kept pace fucking her, the pull and push of it all driving all of them mad with pleasure.
"Are you going to be warm enough in just that John? It is only February."
Or, would they join? Become something new, something stronger? Something beautiful?
"That all?" Sherlock frowns then winces  as the movement caused him to pull the stitches on his head.
"Yes." John felt the pause, felt the sorry that never left Mycroft's lips and then the sound of the door closing.
I think these chapters may be a bit longer ;)
John’s eyes flicked to his for a moment before he stopped filling the glass and put it on the table next to Sherlock’s chair.
Six hours later
Licking his lips John took a few steps back weighing up his options. He needed to get Sherlock out, fast, but he wouldn't be able to do that if he was dead or captured.
Sherlock was sat with his head lowered, tea still steaming in his hands, he hadn't even taken a sip of it yet.
"Hello?"
So a choice.
"Here." Sherlock said with a smile holding out the tin of rice pudding. John took it, their fingers brushing for the smallest amount of time.
John would have rolled his eyes at that but instead he just let himself fall back under.
"None other."
"Good luck Watson...oh and Watson, I did try to stop him." Greg said, his voice sad and angry at the same time.
"I've seen your wound Sherlock; I've also see men react to their own injuries when they see them for the first time. I just want you to be totally sure."
"Breath Sherlock, just breath."
"I forget."
"John!" Mycroft grabbed the army doctors hand, pulling it from Sherlock’s stomach just as several alarms sound but went silent before anyone could get to them.
Gently pulling his wrist free John placed both his hands on Sherlock's face and lent down till their foreheads touched.
"I wont." Greg sighes running his hand through his hair. "He seemed ok today."
"You will let us go now." John stated.
"You need to heal."
The room became still as all life left it, the water within the pool like glass. The still didn’t last long. The water started to ripple, moving as though disturbed from below, as though a large fish had swum close to the surface. The ripples increased until the water itself seemed to become solid forming a pseudopod as big and as round as a man’s body. It moves as fluidly as water should, moving as though it was looking around until it begins to stretch forward, moving around the room until it heads towards the door Molly had just left through. As it moves it sense movement and stops as Molly walks pass the end of the corridor not seeing with odd water shape as she enters the sleeping quarters.
“Sherlock, why are you so sure he is in the hospital.”
As she stood she heard John saying that it would have still been polite to ask if she would like a drink.
“THE CRANE! WE'VE LOST THE CRANE. IT'S ON IT WAY TO YOU!!” Greg shouts his face paling as Mycroft Homes walks onto he bridge.
John frowns at her, “what?”
"I'm not fine Sherlock." John said in a shaky voice. "I am so far from fine, fine is a whole other universe."
No idea this was going to happen, so forgive me, seriously, forgive me.
"I know, but I felt it, and his scream... I don't think I will ever get the sound out of my head."
“But what did he see that made him panic?” Sherlock asked now clearly frustrated with the whole situation, there was something here that needed solving and he couldn’t work it out. He had seen whatever it was that had frightened Dimmock and yet he couldn’t tell anyone what it was he saw because even he had trouble putting it into words.
John glared even as he felt the edges of unconsciousness closing in on him.
"Hello Husband." He said with a smile.
"You said 'this was a mistake'"
"Your mind is healing. Think of it as a computer having a virus if it makes it easier for you. It will take time to kill the virus, and the damage it has caused will last but you can build something new if needs be."
"What..." Sherlock pulled back gasping at the movement but he took in John. "You're hurt."
“Human fingers. In the sink. In water...decaying.”
"Thank you." Was all John said before pulling the coat of him and standing with the heavy belstaff still in hand, Sherlock watched him but made no move to stand. "Here."
"And what did you do?" Cathy pushed as John said nothing.
"Shut up." He hissed.
“Bloody hell.” John hissed as he moved Sherlock to the sofa.
The water snake moves suddenly, turning back on itself and looping itself into a full circle and ties itself into a knot. As the knot tightens down it melts back into itself, the knot disappearing as it leaves the sleeping quarters.
John stared wide eyed at Dimmock. "Oh hell no!"
Turning, John searched out the man, his eyes finding him as the fire lit his pale skin and dark curls.
"Right and..." John turned to the screen as Greg paused and frowned. "Oh shit."
"John." Sherlock tugged on his arm again. "Don't be stupid."
"Maybe you should rest for a bit? " Maddie tried as John stepped back onto the floor.
The kiss was soft, insistent, demanding yet asking so much.
"No there is a woman, over there...lost her arm, I stemmed the bleeding as best I could."
"No, I'm not."
“Moriarty’s body has been found.”
For the first time in weeks, since before his suicide attempt, since way before Christmas, he felt something click. His need to care, to help, returned and with it his warmth and compassion to anyone in distress.
"You become loyal very quickly John."
“I’m stuck again.” Sherlock suddenly realised without even looking about.
"You pinned my wrist." Sherlock stated as John tied his robe closed.
John went to refuse, he wanted to stay, but it would seem his body responded to the word bed and when he went to speak he yawned instead causing Ansari to laugh slightly.
And I had no idea about Cathy! Not until I wrote the words!!!!!
Pulling handcuffs from his coat, Sherlock moved in fast cuffing the mans hands behind his back, all the while John continued to point the gun until Sherlock looked up.
“Who is Divolt?” John asked frowning.
“Oh you see its not Sherlock, it’s really not okay.” Moriarty said in a happy tone.
"Yes he did."
(9:30am) I guess. So, you got my voice mail? JW
"Cathy wanted you to try some new medication. I told her that you wouldn't wish that."
"I dont understand what it is you find so funny."
John heard the voice, he registered the words but all he did was search the water. How deep was it? Was there hidden rocks? Under currents that would pull Sherlock away? Drag him out to sea, never to be seen again?
"No." He tired again as tears ran down his face and blood ran over his shoulder and back.
The sound of voice’s, like bee’s buzzed around him and it was really starting to get on his nerves.
John smiled. “Adrenaline. I ran quite a distance when I saw you were in trouble.”
"I know you can hear me, that big brain of yours never truly sleeps. But for now I need you to stay asleep, I will wake you once I'm happy with how well you are doing. But for now just...sleep." Leaning down he gently placed a kiss to Sherlock’s temple and then got to work assessing Sherlock’s injuries as well as trying coming up with a way to get the three of them out of the mess they found themselves in.
"Agreed. Moran knew what to expect."
"Sherlock?" She asked holding a hand up to him. She saw the crease on John's brow as Sherlock joined her on the floor.
"What happened?"
She smiles back but makes a mental note of what she has just been told. She was good at her job, she wouldn't be on their case if she wasn't and she knew John was trying to tell her to just watch out for herself when it came to Sherlock. But he had to know it was also a form of crying out for help when it came to himself.
So I started writing the next chapter, wrote about 1500 words, decided I hated it. So deleted all that started again and this happened. This was not how I expected this to go, just so you all know that. I have no idea what is going to happen I am, for now, just letting the characters take me where they want to take me.
John took another step away and then followed Molly as she ran back to the mess hall where the only TV lived.
"John, we... I mean..." Sherlock sighed as Ari walked around John and took his coat from his shoulders.
"Not bad." He said as she covered it up and the pulled John's shirt down.
"It will leave an ugly scar." She said sadly.
Lestrade watched, feeling slightly sick, but not wanting to interfere or stop John in anyway. The John Watson he knew wouldn’t stand for this though, he wouldn’t want another human to suffer, yet here John was, looking down at a man clearly suffering and not caring in anyway.
Also I am no therapist and I have only ever had a session with one three times over ten years ago, so this is simply fiction and things are not going to be factually correct.
Leaning against the wall, next to the crack he listened as the voices started to talk amongst themselves and then slowly started to fade till he was once again completely alone.
The world shifted once again and his brother changed before his eyes.
“I…no.” Sherlock frowned his eyes widening as he looked around, panic clearly setting in as he took in the hospital room.
Minutes passed before he started to feel himself regain control and he slowly took in another deep breath before slowly letting it out and opening his eyes.
“Take the first watch in sonar. Molly, you handle the exterior surveillance. Sally, see you can get that transmitter working for me, okay?”
Felling John move from his bed to stand behind him, Sherlock continues to make faces, each one replicated by the water.
"I only know what you know, it's just, I have a greater access than you do."
Moran's words where cut short as Sherlock raised the belt and brought it down hard, the buckle connecting with Moran's face causing the man the scream out and cover his head with his arms as he fell to the ground.
"Great. So how so I leave?"
The nurse for her part stayed quiet but she looked at Moran with terrified eyes as he slowly cut her face.
“Experiment, ‘tis fine, trust…I...oh.” Sherlock moaned as the room began to spin again, forcing him to close his eyes.
"I'm as fine as you are John."
"Three months, possibly longer." Cathys voice was soft yet he knew he was now being reprimanded.
"Will do boss."
“John, Sherlock wouldn’t want this.”
"Don't we have a time limit?" This from Sherlock.
All movement stopped though they both held each others eyes and that helped John more than he cared to admit. Sherlock was real, he was here he was safe and most definitely was not dead.
Still smiling John lent to whisper in his ear. "I need you fit, strong and unhurt, because when I do take you to bed I will be fucking you so hard you won’t be able to walk for a week."
"Right, who the hell are you?"
He stands there for only a few seconds more before heading towards the door that the water disappeared through and slams the door closed cutting the water clearly like a knife.
"Really. I dont want to force anything from you John because I know you will tell me when you are ready to."
"Sherlock!" Of course John was at his side instantly, a hand on his arm as the other gently touched his face. "Okay just slowly take in what you can and then slowly let it out, that's it. And again..." John kept talking, Sherlock followed the instructions as what was clearly a panic attack sunk it's claws into him.
They held each other’s gaze as though it was natural, as though they had done so for most of their lives, yet Sherlock had no idea of the man’s identity, only that he’d never seen him before this night. From the distance between them, he couldn’t decide if the man’s eyes stared back at him in anger or confusion. He only knew he was unable to look away.
"My...croft." Sherlock stammed, hating the weekness shown in that one word.
"John?" Sherlock asked as he too stood but kept his distance.
"Just continue forward along the hull." Coffey orders.
“Yes, but still, lean.”
"John...oh god..." Hitching breaths caused Sherlock to spam slightly causing more tears and more clenching of fists.
"Sherlock?" Cathy asked, to which he rolled his eyes.
"The magnetometer is pegged. Side-scan is showing a big return, but I don't see anything yet. Are you sure you got the depth right on this?"
"Yeah...blind date at that." John added his hand once again stroking through curls.
"He has you helping already."
John for his part just sat still, he concentrated on his breathing, taking in slow breaths as Sherlock made his way around to John and knelt on the floor before him.
"No...no leave him!" John's hand tightened around the object in his hand and pulled it from the pocket. His other hand grabbed at Sherlock’s arm his fingers certainly leaving bruises.
"That's...good." he finally said.
"Yes Cathy,  we spoke about it."
John laughed slightly, “I think that is the first time you have ever apologised for something.”
Allowing John to lead them out of the bathroom and into their bedroom he tried to keep himself in the present.
"That would be good John."
He watched John nod, his lips tightly sealed, his eyes dark with anger.
"You son of a bitch." Moran screamed. "You brok-"
“Sure.” He smiled, following after Molly and was introduced to Sally, Philip, Mike and Greg. After the introductions they soon started a game of hide and seek, John was, of course, the seeker first.
The man walked with him, opening the doors and stepping aside.
Something was off. He didnt know what was wrong, but he knew this wasn't right. He had been saved...no...no he had escaped, on his own. He never had any help. So who were the two he had just been talking to?
“Don’t get used to it.” John said turning away.
“Knife.” Sherlock lent against John’s shoulder. “John.”
"I made you tea." Sherlock nodded to the mug on the table, John glad that he didn't say anything else.
"Right." John frowned slight. "Sherlock is alive."
“Should I call Mycroft?”
"You need to rest, I get that. But please don't stay asleep for too long." Letting go of the curls he pulled up a chair and led his hand over Sherlock’s longer, much paler hand wanting to have just a small amount of contact between them.
"God damn it...why are you not dead?" John asked as Moran pulled free two set of hand cuffs and proceed to cuff John to the stretcher, as the other man packed med supplies. "Last time I saw you, you where bleeding out in the desert."
"Nothing happened." He grounded out.
"I know, he also didnt go running at the first mention of being touched."
John was looking down at his hand as well but the mask remained in place.
"Mycroft?" He whispered, frowning at the tone of his brother's voice.
With shaking hands he hit the notification and held the phone to his ear as it dialled.
John reached out then holding Sherlock’s face in his hands.
Take the drugs, return to not fully feeling everything and having the pain running through his body disappear.
John pulled back then his blue eyes soft, worried, bright.
"That is Andromeda. It's another galaxy."
"You kept him alive, you want him alive." Mycroft smiled causing John to narrow his eyes slightly. "After all, I'm sure you wish to finish your date, you need him alive for that."
"I win." Sherlock’s deep voice rumbled through John.
“Get the fuck away from him!” John shouted earning him another hit to his side.
Obeying John’s request, he gazed into eyes the deepest blue he’d ever seen.
"Sherlock doesn't care!" He hissed. He saw the reaction to his emotional reaction on his therapists face, her eyes widened slightly and she wrote for a while.
“Help.” John breathed out as paramedics entered the room pushing John back which caused him to go into hysterics. Yes, he wanted help, knew Sherlock needed it, but how dare they push him away from his husband!
Until.
"I don’t know."
"How?"
"Maddie, you won’t have another chance until tomorrow."
"I dont care." He said not even looking her way, his eyes very much on Sherlock.
Grey looked down at John.
"I think it best doctor Ansari explains everything." She kept her voice calm and steady as she answered. She of course knew the right answer but the doctor would be able to give John all the information he needed, so deemed it best to allow John to get everything from one source.
"Okay, you have till Thursday then I need to assess both of you."
Reach the hatch leading to Dimmock he spotted the younger man fitting in the middle of the room.
"Any minute." He answered not looking at anything but her. "Why are you nervous?"
He stared at the pills in their tiny paper cup before picking them up, turning on his heal, walking back into the bathroom and tipping them down the toilet.
"Back off Watson." Moran had walked with the others and using his rifle he pushed John back by pressing the barrel against the front of John’s neck. John fought it, he held on until the pain became too much and his breathing was compromising, his body betraying him, causing him to pull back and let go of Sherlock.
The smile left Sherlock’s lips his hand lifting to touch John’s temple. Your mind is doing the same."
Looking down he caught John's eyes as they opened, the darkness of those eyes swallowing him whole, making him fall all the more as the trust John felt was reflect in the dark depths.
"Yes, he had come in to see how you both were doing."
"Cathy."
Sherlock dropped his towel closing the gap between them and taking hold of John's hands gently. Looking down at those hands, smaller than his but still so strong, showing his history, his time as a surgeon, as a solider as a drinker. Lifting them he placed kisses on each palm, then over his knuckles before letting go of one hand and undoing the cuff button, then doing the same with the other. Once done he pulled gently at the sleeve of one arm till John pulled his arm free, the process repeated on the last arm. Once the shirt was off Sherlock picked John's hands up again, again kissing the palms, the knuckles before kissing just below each new scar of each wrist.
(2:15am) I'm up. JW
"First date." Sherlock interupted, smiling through blood stained lips up at John.
"Okay."
“Well you just wait, he’s in your class, you just wait and see how weird he is!” Sally said loudly. John was looking up at the tree as she spoke and he saw those words hit the boy as though they were stones.
"You have always had an aversion to touch yourself."
It took ten minutes for the first responder (a paramedic) to arrive, another ten for the police with Lastrade leading way.
"Been a while since you spotted me. I'm surprised you haven't deleted any of it." John says quietly as Sherlock pulls the neck brace over John’s head and picks up his helmet for him.
As he walked the halls, he acknowledged the orderlies but didn't stop, knowing they would be watching him now they knew he was awake and up. Making his way down to the main floor he bypassed Cathy's office and headed straight to the apartment. Once out the door however he stopped as he raised the hand to knock at the door. Why was he here?
"John loves you, he needs you just as much as you need him. He wont pity, he will try to comfort you, and do things at your pace."
"John."
John kissed her in a way that had her panting for more when he pulled back, his fingers digging into her hair tilting her head back, his eyes almost black now with desire.
“I can’t!” Sherlock shouted. “John, oh god John please-“He was suddenly sick, the heaving ripping at his stiches and causing him more pain. “John…”
The flat was cold, but then of course it was. Mrs Hudson had been surprise when Sherlock had walked in, her eyes scanning behind him in search of John but finding him alone she had slumped slightly but placed a well meaning smile on her face.
"I let another die because I couldn't leave him." The doctor sighed and looked over at his patient before placing a hand on John's shoulder.
"I'm here, I...I don't remember, I'm sorry, but I am here. I will always be here and I will always protect you."
"Meaning you left on single line of the web intact and it is has a new spider determined to fix it."
"Dont care." Sherlock mumbled into John's hair.
As the door gives John is pushed through with a tone of water, Anderson is pushed back his arm hit pipes as he went, a cry of pain leaving his lips as his arm broke. Mike grabs Anderson other arm and they all rush down to the other door, falling threw it as it closes and locks behind them, saving them from the freezing water.
From where Sherlock was led on his shoulder John found himself brushing Sherlock forehead with his lips before pulling back slightly to look at his eyes.
He felt Sherlock shake with suppressed tears as he too pulled at John.
Sherlock was stood by Cab One going over the small sub making sure everything was in order. Sally was refuelling Flatbed and Mike was sorting Cab Three. Molly stood next to the two small drone subs making sure they were both in working order while the four Marines, Dimmock and Stevens got into their diving gear.
"Agreed." Sherlock nodded as he got comfortable under John's weight.
"I was caught. I got away about three months before returning." He said as he opened his eyes.
"Right. You have a few hours’ kip, then you really need to dig that bullet out before it’s too late." He patted John’s arm and then he felt as someone else started to undo the bandage on his other arm. Wincing as the dried gauze was pulled from the bullet graze he waited.
John felt a smile form as he tightened his arms.
"You can have one more." John passed the pop back to Maddie who dipped it in the water and handed it back to John. "Here." John held the pop up and Sherlock opened his mouth, again closing his eyes as John placed it in his mouth and he sucked it dry.
“Nah.” Greg answered as Mike and Molly shook their heads. “We’re good.”
"I will let you know of what times in the morning."
Sherlock looks over his array readings; he knows they are close but hasn’t seen anything as yet.
Closing the sliding doors Sherlock turned to watch John as he took in the open plan sittingroom and kitchen. It was modern in design but comfortable, Sherlock had approved when he had first seen it.
"Sherlock." He called as he looked at the pad of his thumb then back at the arm.
Sherlock continued to stare at his brother a small frown on his face.
They were about half way to their destination when a call from top side came in.
The door closed leaving Sherlock alone. The smile slowly left his face as he closed his eyes and turned to sit back on the chair.
“It’s okay.” John slowly let go of Sherlock’s wrists, placing them instead upon Sherlock’s face. “It’s okay.”
Coffey winked and sat back pulling the storage boxes with him.
But it was the storage equipment they had brought with them that caught his interest so thoroughly. Reaching forward he went to examine it more closely when a hand grabbed his wrist.
“I’m not high.” Sherlock stated as though that would answer everything. “I saw something John, I touching it for god’s sake! It was real, not a hallucination or anything caused by drugs because I’m clean!”
"You will come to find that I know a lot John, don't ask how or why just know that I know."
“John…”
"Why? Because he had a chance Sherlock, he was happy, could have even moved on, but you refused to close the account!"
“Coffey knows; he wants everyone in the mess hall.” She says looking between the two men.
"So Sherlock is left with an open wound?"
John turned his head to Sherlock and his deep blues opened slightly.
Sherlock's eyes held Johns allowing John to watch as tears of pain welled up causing him to gently run his thumbs over Sherlock's cheeks and whisper reassuring words.
"More than okay." Sherlock turned to look at him a smile on his own lips. "That was..."
They didn’t talk much after that, just cuddled and soon fell asleep, or at least Sherlock did. John stayed awake, kept himself alert, he didn’t want to miss a second of this, didn’t want to wake with Sherlock gone. He wanted this to end with a goodbye.
The film continued, they stayed close together, held eachs others hand and for John, it was one huge step forward to recovering.
"No need to thank me John."
“Sherlock Breathe!” John almost shouted, but it was to no avail. Sherlock was lost.
Finding himself at the end of the garden, he looked up at the tall hedge before sighing and turning, instantly running into a solid object. Jumping back he went on the defensive, then relaxed seeing Sherlock stood in nothing but his shirt, his hair soaked and stuck to his face and neck. He thought about saying something about walking in the rain with no coat, but it would sound stupid seeing as he had no coat himself. So he just looked up into those amazing eyes, puffy from tears, and so bright they looked like the clearest waters in the world.
“I…I’m meant to be meeting someone.”
"Why are you like that? "
"He's having a flash back." John said as way of explaining, stepping aside as the three entered. However before they reached the bedroom they stopped as Sherlock appeared at the door a knife in hand, his eyes wide and totally unseeing the real world around him.
Greg stumbles out of the door twenty minutes later, the scream that follows him finally causing him to empty his stomach. With one hand pressed against a wall he closes his eyes and just breaths in deeply trying to clear his mind and calm his stomach.
“SSSSHHH!” Mike hissed pulling Molly towards him and clamping a hand over her mouth.
"You're lucky I didn’t meet her first." John muttered as his breathing slowed and he started to regain control. "Five seconds in your company though, I'm pretty sure I would leave whoever I was with just after that amount of time. Hell, five second and I haven't left your side. What have you done to me Sherlock?"
"John...I got every single one, listened to all of them, repeatedly. They kept me going, kept me on track, made me want to come home faster." John turned then, his eyes still black, still dead, but he was looking at Sherlock.
“What happened? I don’t remember.” Sherlock growled slight then winced as his hand fisted the covers over his wound.
"He will probably keep coming back to the present but he can slip back at any moment."
John sighed, shaking his head but otherwise saying nothing.
“Why?” John asked, turning a page to a murder scene and quickly turning to the next.
"Very well." He turns picking up his coat and umbrella before leaving without a backward glance.
Sighing he turned his head away from the door and took in the room around him before his eyes landed on the other bed. It was empty, but its covers were a mess, clearly someone had been sleeping there. Staring at the bed for a while his mind tried to work through the clues. Mycroft wouldn’t have let Sherlock share a room with just anyone, yet no other clue to who he would be sharing a room with came to him.
“He won’t care.”
"John needed to continue his therapy with regards to his haphephobia. We had been able to get him to eat here, close to the end of meal times, before you had arrived." She sighed looking down for a moment before looking up at Sherlock her face sad but determined.
"No!" John almost shouted watching as Sherlock flinched. "No...I...I  needed that! I wouldn't have lasted," he swollowed hard before continuing. "It helped, it kept apart of you...alive."
“I am his doctor.” John said his eyes hard. “Now get what I asked for.”
Maddie shook her head again and moved closer to Sherlock, who had his eyes closed but John knew he was listening.
“Excellent news.”
"Thank you for coming."
"We need to sleep." John mummered feeling his body relax at the weight led ontop of him.
Upon the Explorer the winch man staggers along the railing finding it hard to keep his footing as he is hit by the eighty knot winds. As he reaches the deck he sprits towads the base of the crane holding the umbilical winch just as a wave blasts him into the bulkhead. Shaking water from his hair and eyes he half crawls to the ladder to the winch house and climbes up.
"Come on John!" Sherlock suddenly called causing John to turn and run to catch up with him.
"Rules?" John asked.
"John?" The voice was rough, lack of water the obvious cause but also from extensive coughing. "John?"
“Hey, hey! There's the Explorer.”
They spent breakfast in comfortable silence. Sherlock sipped at his coffee as he reviewed images Lestrade had sent while John ate a full English breakfast. Apparently the cook really did want his affair kept quiet.
"He is right Mr Holmes. Our only hope is to keep him under through pain management." Doctor Ansari looked to John. "However that was risky." He pulls back the covers revealing Sherlock’s wrapped abdomen causing John to sigh and slum slightly. No blood was seeping through the bandages meaning John hadn't ripped any stiches.
“Then what does that say about you?”
"You know that will not happen."
There were people who beat the curse, of course, people who could churn out book after book or film after film. And once they got to number three they usually managed to cement themselves in the creative world. It was just a matter of getting past number two, the project doomed regardless of its quality. It was all fear, in the end. Some people could handle the derision that often accompanied second works. He had discovered that he simply was not one of them.
"There is nothing we can do about it now, John."
“Yes. It matters when people die, whoever they are.”
“I know I did. I just.” He shook his head.
The woman just rolled her eyes and looked back at the Vermeer. John smiled to himself. Little views into regular people's lives, those were just little extras that came with frequenting these museums. Everyone was there for a reason, whether it was artistic passion or needing silence or because they were dragged along by their girlfriend.
“At least I've gotten better about not waving brains under your nose.”
“You dragged me up here, didn't you?”
"I assure you I am not wasting it. Socialising does not serve a purpose. Acquiring information does."
Sherlock had been thinking over the possible outcomes of the Games. The most likely one was that they would both die, and relatively soon. But he wondered what would happen if it came down to the two of them, or even if they happened across each other in the arena. Would John be able to kill him? Would John really be able to kill anyone? He was a healer after all. Of course, Sherlock knew what people were capable of when it came down to life or death. The bigger question on his mind was would he be able to kill the healer if it came to that? Sherlock, while forbidding, had never killed anyone, and wasn't keen on starting. But he supposed he would do what he had to do to survive, just like anyone else.
"Yes." Sherlock waited for John to get angry, but he didn't.
There was a part of him that wanted to hurl the painting into the Thames, to legitimately destroy it so it would be as if he never had it. But he couldn't bring himself to do that to a great work of art. But something had to be done. It was a different matter when all it had done was haunt him, but it had almost cost him Sherlock's life, and John wasn't prepared to ever chance that sacrifice again. At the start of all this, he hadn't had Mycroft on hand, and as he stood there staring at the tiny painted stars, he wondered if Mycroft would help sort things out. He didn't want to get thrown in jail for something like this. Just the thought of possibly being able to get the painting out of his hands made him feel so relieved that he couldn't believe the painting's mere existence had caused him so much grief so many times.
The surgeon drew his attention back by saying, “You're his SO, I'm assuming?”
He set his bag down on the chest at the foot of the bed and collapsed on top of the blankets, his phone chirping in his pocket.
Of course, he did have a tendency to alienate everyone who even attempted to be his audience. Like Molly, the pretty little graphic designer, or Lestrade, the curator. Even on the best of days, they could only tolerate him for so long.
One night, John almost went back to the church, perhaps wanting to somehow recreate that moment of peace and silence they had achieved just a few nights before. But he lost his nerve. Sherlock would see through something like that.
He ran a hand back through his hair as he walked downstairs, annoyed already with the persistent visitor.
I met Molly Hooper three years before I met John. Even then, she was well-meaning, if not slightly romantically deluded. I had already been working with Lestrade for some time at that point, and one morning I went with him to the lab at Bart's to look over one of his more recent and interesting murder victims. She had just started working in the morgue and wore on her face the usual new-job trepidation.
John looked up from the photo to find the brothers staring each other down, Mycroft finally nodding, ego just a bit bruised. When Sherlock slammed the door shut behind him, he did so with delight.
John laughed at the way Sherlock said it, as if it was a bit if a regrettable childhood folly. “And to think, I felt wild when my family would take a holiday to a different section of England.”
“You just came back from the dead, Sherlock.”
Sherlock had sulked after that for a while, muttering about how he needed
“I'm sure I could manage to walk away from here. I have no interest in suicide. And your games won't keep you alive out here. You're as good as dead anyway.” Sherlock turned to walk away, but the man stopped him.
Sherlock gave him a sly smile and said, "I may know someone. How do you feel about the violin?"
"Do what they tell you to, Sherlock," John said reproachfully. Even half awake and beaten to a pulp, he still felt the need to chide his friend. It added normalcy to an abnormal situation. "How long have I been here?"
When he was far enough away from the cornucopia to feel relatively safe, John slowed to a walk, taking deep breaths of the cold air that burned his lungs. He was fairly sure he was alone in his section of woods. There were no signs of anyone else. He realized how loud he sounded in the forest, and forced himself to breathe quietly. Every sound seemed to echo, seemed ten times louder than it probably was. Every snapping twig was just a potential harbinger of another tribute.
He read the newspaper obsessively every day and became a television news addict, tracking any and all developments on the Hickman bombing. Everyone was upset, not just because of the tragedy itself and the loss of lives resulting from it, but also because of all the works of art that were destroyed.
Sherlock sat down across from John in the booth, arms crossed over his chest. He ignored the menu that was placed in front of him, pushing it to the edge of the table. John gave his order to the waitress, who turned expectantly to Sherlock. He didn't even look up at her. “And nothing for him, I think,” John said with an apologetic smile, handing her the menus.
“You know, you can be so bloody abrasive, but you're entertaining, I'll give you that.”
"I feel the same way."
The driver met his eyes in the mirror. “That place? That's the Holmes estate. Been there for well over a hundred years.”
Sherlock refused to let John leave, despite his comment about needing to get home. Finally, John gave up, accepting Sherlock's offer of one of the guest bedrooms. “Just in case,” Sherlock said. “Just in case there are delayed effects.”
“We'll cross that bridge when we come to it, Sherlock.”
Sherlock looked back up at him, turning his whole body finally, genuine confusion on his face. “No. I thought that if you wanted to beat the hell out of me that badly that you would do it no matter the location. I picked this place because these museums were always stress free environments for you when other places might not have been.” He shrugged one shoulder, not grasping the gravity of his own consideration. “By all means, punch the lights out of me if it will help, because I don't really know what
When they pushed their way out of their building, there were police cars waiting on them, planning to arrest Sherlock. Before John could rip them apart, before he could be indignant, Sherlock bolted. Though he knew Sherlock was innocent, running always looked guilty.
“Whatever you say, dear.” She smiled as she left the room. Sherlock frowned after her.
“Who are you, then?”
There was one night bad enough that his thoughts turned even darker, one of the rare nights now in which he remembered the painting existed, haunting him.
“I don't keep a GPS tracker on him, Mary.” He closed his book, balancing it on the arm rest of his chair, leaning his head against his hand in growing irritation. Some days he was better at dealing with Mary's company than others. Some days he actually enjoyed being around her. But this was not the night for it.
"Dangerous."
Which was asinine. He had never cared what people thought of him in any other sense. But it mattered what they thought of his work. Without his work, what was he?
She said they needed to get going, that he couldn't still be here when the police started pouring in.
She set the plates down, leaned against the counter. “Seriously? You would seriously let that keep you from traveling? Is that why you won't get rid of that flat either?”
“It worked, didn't it?”
“Because I was arguing with her and couldn't be in the same room with her anymore.”
does not matter right now, Sherlock. What matters is that we have to be able to put up a united front. We have no choice where that's concerned. Anything else, it's a moot point. This isn't something either of us can do alone.”
being said, or said only in such a way that it was considered socially acceptable.
Sherlock crossed the greenhouse, pushing some brambles out of his way to reach a small crate. He set the crate on the table beside the spray of flowers and motioned for John to come closer, which he did, albeit reluctantly. Sherlock stopped to tug the gloves back on again before opening the lid of the crate. Inside were small mice, all white. He reached in and picked one up, dropping it into a wide beaker that had been sitting on the edge of the table. He slid the beaker closer to John, who watched as the mouse manically moved around in its new home. Sherlock removed his gloves, leaving them on the table beside the beaker. He brushed past John and gathered up a handful of the little white Queen Anne's lace with his bare hands. John opened his mouth to ask why he touched the plants when he had warned him not to, but Sherlock cut him off. “Observe the effects of this plant which you believe to be so innocuous.” He pulled off one of the clusters of white blooms and dropped it in the beaker near the mouse. John watched as the mouse sniffed at it, inching closer. After determining it was safe, the mouse tried to burrow underneath the flowers like they were bedding. But as it did, John saw its body twitch, a series of quick convulsions. Then it lay still, dead underneath the flowers.
Night came quickly in the winter light, slanting sharply through the trees and casting shadows that tricked John's eyes more than once. He had walked all afternoon, feeling like if he stopped he would be found, but he knew walking through the night was not an option. When he found the fallen trees, he took it as a sign. It was a better shelter than he could probably make, and though it offered little space, it offered plenty of camouflage. John could see out well enough, but only very specific angles would allow anyone passing to see in. And while that wasn't ideal, it was better than nothing in an arena that offered very little cover.
“Don't forget the signing tomorrow night.”
He almost missed the end of the countdown, as did many of them, distracted by the woman's death. But then it became a blur of running figures, of screams and battle cries. He saw Sherlock grab something and bolt for the woods, another tribute narrowly missing him with an arrow. John whirled around, his eyes finding the harsh metallic glint of a gun. He ran for it even as another tribute came from the other direction, trying to beat him to it. But the tribute stopped suddenly, only feet from John, eyes wide in shock, and then she fell to her knees, a spear sticking out of her back. The boy who had thrown it, maybe seventeen if that, came forward, wrenching it out of her. John reached forward, grabbing the gun and a knife beside it, and without a second thought for the dead woman, he ran.
“I didn't realize it would upset you that much.”
have pushed you away. I would never have stopped you.”
“Some.”
"Landlady, technically." Sherlock grabbed a few bags of crisps off the shelves.
John laughed, glancing away for a second as he always did when something amused him. He shook his head, smiling at Sherlock. “It'll have to do, though, won't it?”
saying?”
"Sherlock, what happened back there? Are you sick?"
“I will certainly keep that in mind.”
He tuned out most of the talking, turning his eyes to the book in his hand, the pages yellowed with age. These were the best kinds of books. They felt more real, more grounded. All Sherlock had ever used newer books for was to take on long trips because he didn't care if he lost them. Hardback, cloth, green cover with a tattered yellow spine, dust jacket long since gone. An edge of the cover was a bit discolored, like its original owner had spilled coffee on it, but that didn't matter. It had the poem in it.
He sat cross-legged, rubbing his eyes, wondering if his pulse would ever slow down, and thinking that the next time it did would be when it stopped entirely. He looked at his weapons sitting on the dirt in front of him, and he picked up one in each hand. John knew he was already luckier than half the people in the arena, having a weapon he could work with. But it was a hollow comfort.
"What do real people have, then, in their...real lives?"
They came to a stop on the pavement. Sherlock watched him curiously, his face cut by the lamplight, his eyes briefly running over John's face, his own expression almost sad.
"I didn't want it to turn out this way any more than you did, John! When I was dragged into my boss' office and told to go arrest Sherlock, do you think I enjoyed it?"
"I had no such intention."
"Whatever her name is," he replied with a dismissive wave of his hand.
“You know, we probably won't remember this tomorrow.”
"Reason your way through it. Your mind needs the exercise." Sherlock sat his violin down and started scribbling down the music from memory onto some blank sheets. He would neaten it up later. He was hoping John would come to his own conclusions. Sherlock didn't want to have to tell him out loud. Such emotional confrontations were not his strong suit. Any time he opened his mouth, he usually just made things worse. "Think about the tone."
He stood, glaring at the tombstone, and then against his better judgement, he started talking.
“The woman said she had similar difficulties with the girl she's always around, Kate or whatever her name is.”
“You should. Better to embrace the oddities in yourself than attempt to fall into the niche the world has created for you. It's the only chance of escaping the tedium.”
“Indiana Jones'.”
"John, should I be worried about you? I don't want you doing something you'll regret."
“You know, Sherlock, I think you'd quite like
“Because they found out about what happened?”
. It was true, but he had a feeling it was the wrong answer to an unasked question. He reached out a hand and laid it on John's shoulder, the closest thing he knew to a comforting gesture.
“Yeah. It was a gamble, but it sure paid off. Leave it to Sherlock Holmes to find an act that would better his chances.”
“Do you ever wish you'd lived a more, I don't know, settled life growing up?”
“That will look very good with the sponsors. They'll adore it. We'll play the martyr angle.”
"There's always a chance of everything, John."
"Enough."
"No, I mean,
“I won't say anything.”
“At least they can't mimic our voices.”
When she left –
John smiled and leaned forward, his face inches from Sherlock's. He took Sherlock's hand, moving it away from his shoulder, and held tight to it, their hands resting between them, fingers laced.
He wondered briefly if he'd left his phone in the living room, thinking that if anyone was trying to reach him that they would have no luck. He had no intention of leaving this bed anytime soon, no plan for being more than arm's length away from the sleeping man beside him. This was heaven, this was shelter, this was comfort. And as he fell asleep, finally resting untouched from awful dreams, he thought that
“Better is relative in the Games, Mycroft,” Sherlock muttered at him.
“Touch. Nothing.”
John had to run to catch up with him, the harsh chemical smell of the hospital hallways almost nauseating.
“Around. I will be checking in on you, of course. I will put you in contact with some of my people on Earth, help you get started. They know the human version of me that I've been forced to utilize in the past.”
“Of course it is. It's supposed to be.”
They stayed and talked for a few hours. Sherlock gave his best explanation of what he did for a living, and was pleased to see John impressed. Before he left, John traded phone numbers with him, saying, "While I'm still in London, we should do this again, assuming I don't run into you at Tesco again first." He chuckled.
"In real life. There are no archenemies in real life. Doesn't happen."
“I believe the term for this sort of fight is 'a losing battle.' Goodnight.” He pushed his chair back and calmly walked out of the room.
a romantic, we know, we know.” He gave a passing smile to John. “Sorry about him. He tends to go on about things. Have you been checked in?”
"Why can't I see?"
Sherlock lay back, guiding John with a hand on his shoulder to get him to lie down as well. When he had John settled, he ran his fingers along John's wrist, tracing soothing little patterns there, his eyes willing John to calm down. John's heart finally began to quit pounding, and John saw the smallest change in Sherlock's face, relief as John's pulse beat slower beneath his fingers. Sherlock stayed awake until John drifted back to sleep.
Sherlock followed his finger up, staring at the sky. “It all looks the same to me.”
Without turning to look at him, he said, “Coming, John?”
"Wrong interpretation."
He was infuriated. What was tarnishing his audience? There was no logical reason for any of this!
be suited to me, Miss Riley?
“And you're not, now. In fact, I imagine you look forward to going home.”
“You really should invest in a lock that is more difficult to pick.”
Thinking that perhaps returning the ring to its rightful owner would somehow ease his conscience, that it might help him sleep at night to put at least part of this to rest, he turned the television off and swore to himself that whenever he could bring himself to leave his room next, that he would go deal with the man's ring.
“Greg, promise me something.”
“I am a wealth of random knowledge.”
When he finally tried to force his eyes open, he found that he couldn't, and was instantly struck with panic. He heard his pulse rise on the monitor and he tried to force himself to calm down. Why couldn't he open his eyes? Suddenly, the blackness that had at first been so soothing was now a gaping abyss, and he was trapped in it.
“A golden chain tree.” Sherlock's voice startled him. He had stopped walking and was staring off at the tree as well. “Usually seen in southern Europe. A lovely poisonous tree, though it's often used as an ornamental. Why people believe that using poisonous trees for such a purpose has never ceased to baffle me.” He waved for John to follow, and left the nearly nonexistent path to cross the yard, approaching a large, rundown greenhouse. It was an ornate building with a high ceiling, the top of it decorated with iron work made to look like vines. Several panes of glass were missing throughout, the intact glass a bluish green underneath a blurry accumulation of dirt and grime. The weeds were beginning to encroach upon it as well, and the door was long since gone. Sherlock strode through the empty doorway into the greenhouse.
“And who would you dedicate a book to?”
“What do you mean, poetic justice?”
of what John would have believed was a foreign concept. “Did you pick a public place to do this so that I wouldn't beat the ever loving hell out of you?”
When they broke apart, Sherlock spoke again, despite having to catch his breath first. “And while I'm perfectly willing to negotiate the matter of dismantling your computer, I really must find my way to a better violin, or at the very least have that one refurbished.”
Once or twice, he even tried to get Sholto to come, thinking the time out of the house would do him good (and surely if the museums were soothing enough for John, they would have been for him as well), but to no avail. Afghanistan had wounded some people more irreparably than others. That, he could understand.
“I'd love to meet them. I feel like I've met nearly everyone else in town.”
Except there was a deviation from the script. As the silence stretched on – John never spoke in these dreams – the museum remained untouched by fire and violence, and Sherlock continued to stare at the Monet, the rise and fall of his chest surely a deception.
“She was nice about everything, but we still didn't part under ideal circumstances, did we?”
The kiss was never supposed to happen. There had been so many long glances, so many times eyes had flitted to mouths and hands. There had been the steadily lessening space between them. There had been more than one instance of breath catching, but still, it wasn't supposed to have happened. But it had, and so easily.
“All poets are guilty of creating truisms out of context, just like astronomers will always be guilty of colorizing events that in space have no significant color. It's all flair for the general public,” she said.
. Sherlock, trust me, there is
Later, Sherlock was sitting comfortably in his chair in Baker Street, cup of tea in hand and laptop humming in front of him. The man's choice had been perfect.
“I'm real.”
She was the only thing standing between him and living honestly and happily for the first time in his life.
John glanced at the table nearest him and saw the selection of guns. They weren't as extensive as the other weapons, but they were enough. He picked up a small handgun and looked at the judges on the platform, eying the lights above their heads, the glass tubes casting their makeup-coated skin in a sickly glow. He raised the gun and shot.
He watched Sherlock as he looked from John's eyes, to his coat and back again.
Turning slightly he looks at Sherlock who is staring at his tea, lost in thought. The man was stunning, even dressed in his pajamas and a hoodie. Suddenly John felt extremely self conscious of his own body. He knew he had lost weight, his hair now more grey than blonde and his wrist scarred in the most hiddious of ways. Curling his arms under himself he knew his movements drew Sherlock’s attention as crystal eyes shot up to meet his.
"Do you realise, the whole of my team saw that?" Greg asked.
"Yeah, you and Redbeared had a lot of adventures with that bed, fighting the scum of the seven seas and hunting for treasure."
"Yes." Sherlock looked up, his eyes clear. "I should have told you."
"Hi, how you feeling?"
"Very well." Doctor Ansari nodded and stepped back.
His brain shut down, his breathing shallowed, his vison narrowed, his heart stopped.
His shirt was open showing the extensive torture he had gone through in such a short time. His black trousers where covered in blood, only visible because of the shin the blood gave to the dark material. His head was hanging down, his normally perfect curls wild and stuck to his neck and face.
Sherlock stops at the threshold to the living room. It was the same, nothing much had changed, apart from the obvious dusting Mrs Hudson had done in the last twenty-four hours, there was still papers lying about, laptops half opened, Sherlock’s last experiment still spread out on the table. The only difference was one wall was covered in a map of London and red pen circled an area several times.
"John, you did the right thing." Stacy offers as she placed a hand on his shoulder.
"Has he gone back to sleep?" The nurse asked as she reappear with fresh clothing and bedding.
He could feel it building up inside of him, could feel the pressure as the air built in his chest, could feel the sound he would make, holding itself in his throat waiting for the air from his lungs to propelle it forward and out.
"Hard to say, but you will?"
"So when is he expected home?" She asked running her hands over her dress for the hundredth time.
Why had he tried? Why had he wanted to try? Because he had allowed Sherlock to? Because he could touch Cathy? Because he needed to prove to himself that he was getting better? He couldn't remember why.
“I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked ASAP.” Sally shouted back as she, Sherlock and Molly followed at a run.
He had woken an hour earlier, his body curled up next to John's, the both of them in nothing but their underwear.
"And where do you think you are going?"
"Make up."
“I can’t, I can’t turn away from you.” John felt tears prick at his eyes but he refused to cry. “I can’t let you go through this alone.”
“What’s going on John?”
"What happened?" John demanded turning towards the bed and slowly walking towards the bed.
"Wrist." John ordered then watched as Sherlock took off his glove and held his hand out.
The car was quiet as it pulled up at the building that had been John’s and Sherlock’s prison. A nondescript building, run down and clearly abandoned, the only sign that something had gone down here was the police tape and a marked police car standing guard.
"This. We talk."
"Will you tell John?"
"Forget what?"
“Maybe.”
"You think this was Moran?"
"Hands up whore." Moran ordered and to Sherlock’s shame he did it, placing his hands flat against the wall. Lowering his head he let the tears flow as his shirt was cut from his back exposing his already fully scared back to the chill of the air.
"Neither do I!" John got out between laughs.
"What?"
"Do you know him?" John asked looking up at the taller man.
Sherlock nodded again, what else could he do? He had lost John in a way he never imagined and because of that Moriarty had won once again, because Sherlock’s heart was thoroughly burnt.
"Knock off the chatter." Coffey orders sounding irritable. "Cab One, you getting anything?"
"Now, I need to tell you now, all of it." Sherlock sounded so small, his deep voice a whisper.
"Yes, you are new, I have no idea who you Are or why my mind finds it a good idea to keep you around."
“We're losing number two thruster! Bearing's going!”
"Sherlock." One said holding his hands up and taking a step forward.
"Okay, but you're okay with talking about it now?"
"What did you talk about?" Sherlock asked looking at John.
"So what do we talk about?"
John glared.
"What is going on?" Mycroft asked, his hand tightening on John's wrist.
"It will take three months, possibly longer for him to get back to the stage he was at."
Slowly, Cathy smiled.
“I promise.”
Cathy had tried talking to them but they just locked themselves away, spending their days watching crap TV while curled up on the sofa, dressed in pajamas and covered in a duvet, with legs tangled and hands touching.
Something had gone wrong.
Sherlock looked back to John then as though he could feel the need rolling off him, the need to do something, anything.
John looked down at Sherlock and increased his grip on the hand slightly.
“Well this just sucks.” Molly says as everyone goes still and silent.
"Is this real?" John's hands were on his back, holding him, warm on his bare skin, his fingers moving ever so slightly sending small tremors through his body.
"Get the fuck away from him!" He yelled seeing red and going to attack the closest person to him, but arms wrapped themselves around his upper body, pinning his arms to his sides.
"No! Fuck your medication! Fuck this good damn shit hole and just leave me be!"
Slowly straightening he took a few deep breaths as he looked down into blue eyes.
“Not a surprise though, not even a tiny bit of a surprise.” Moriarty shook his head slightly stepping further into the room with Moran right behind him. “But it is disappointing.”
"Oh now look what you have gone and done!" John saw Moran push Christen from the van just as he was pulled under.
Blinking he sat up, pushing the chair down to stand just as Sherlock took in a shuddering breath, his eyes opening then closing against the light.
At that moment the nurse walked in with what John had asked for. She went about cleaning an IV line then allowing John to administer the cure.
He knew Sherlock had cottoned onto the fact that John liked it, asked for it, yet neither of them talked about it, did anything about it.
“Yes.” Sherlock whispered, his hands moving from John's arms to John's face pulling him down till their foreheads pressed together. Smiling, John pressed a small kiss to Sherlock's lips before pulling back and turning to the elder Holmes brother.
"What? What did I say?"
"I'm sorry John." He finally said as a few tears escaped and slid down his face.
Lots of dialogue in this one.
"Will do boss."
"Of course you do, you are human, a doctor as well as a soilder. Your whole purpose at one time was to care for the whole human race. But not anymore." Taking a seat across from the sofa she indicated the tea pot and mugs on the table between them. "Please help yourselves."
"When was the last time you slept?" He asked instead watching her closely.
"No." Sherlock said shaking his head. "Moran will know, he will know Mycroft is tracking him harder than he is at the moment and he will go deeper, he will disappear. This way he keeps himself more open because he wants me to find him."
"Kiss me."
“Did you see the knife?”
"Oh...right. Well, he was bleeding internally and they were unable to find the cause so deemed it best to get him into the OR as soon as possible."
“He…did this.” Sherlock looked down at himself and John hissed.
“You done ‘Lock.” Sherlock rolls his eyes moving away from the middle of the room as Sally speaks up.
"So when do we get to see Jim?" John asked as they walked down the hall.
"I know." Came the reply, along with a kiss over Sherlock’s heart.
The sirens where blaring and John could see the blue lights flashing, so whoever was in the way really was an idiot.
.~.~.~.
“I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras. We need early warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.” Coffey orders as he looks around the hall. His men stand just behind him with the rig crew sat around in a group, though Sherlock stood apart, arms crossed and rolling his eyes as the marine commander spoke.
The following morning, John woke up feeling just as he had the day before, rather pleased since there was now no way Sherlock could go on about delayed effects.
When John shut his sister's bedroom door behind him, he saw her sitting on the floor by her bed, her liquid courage beside her. She was trembling, her arms wrapped around her knees, and after all the years of verbal outbursts and her mouth getting her in trouble, it seemed that speech had been taken from her entirely. She blinked back tears, not very successfully, and wiped them away with the back of her hand. No matter what John said to her, she wouldn't speak, and eventually he had to settle for sitting next to her with his arm around her, letting her rest her head on his shoulder, in perfect silence for hours.
“Accessible or obscure?”
“You don't think I buy that, do you?”
“What the fuck are you talking about!”
“Who?”
“I won't even ask what that entails, since I know you won't tell me.” Sherlock expected the phrase to be terse and passive-aggressive, but when he darted his eyes away from the street outside to look at John, he seemed completely unfazed.
The museums were still comforting to a certain extent, certainly more soothing an atmosphere than the clinic or Mary's flat, but now and then he'd catch an Italian piece out of the corner of his eye and feel an almost instinctive stabbing sensation in his stomach. He tried to stick to the French and English galleries since every white marble sculpture and any Renaissance painting just made him miserable.
It was beautiful.
“I just can't get some of it out of my head.”
“Your first thought was that I was dead?”
“Explosion?”
It took precisely five minutes for him to regret it. The Tesco was full of people. They packed the aisles and got in his way as he attempted to navigate the store. He couldn't even remember the last time he'd set foot in a place like this. By the time he reached the dairy section, he was already annoyed with everyone and everything around him. And then he saw the hundreds of different types of milk available and wondered why people felt they had to needlessly complicate such a simple dietary staple.
Across the fire in the military camp, Irene Adler looked me over. We had both abandoned the thick black robes in favour of fatigues. She, of course, was wearing the most minimal, the uniform pants and a T-shirt. I was just happy that the fatigues I wore still had long sleeves.
He came to a stop at a dead halt in the middle of the forest. There was someone standing in front of him, someone eerily calm. A familiar face wearing a smile that wasn't his. John stood there, not in the sleek black of their arena clothes, but in dark jeans and a white shirt, holding a gun on him. Someone had stolen him, hijacked his face. John would never look at him like that, never with that malicious grin. Sherlock knew that. But he still worried that it was real. He could feel the metal of the gun against his chest as John walked closer to him, even though he was still feet away.
"Because you don't deserve one."
“That's not what I asked.”
“Sherlock. He's alive.”
“The classic antisocial writer trope.”
Once you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.
“All right, Sherlock Holmes, I hate to tell you this, but you don't live here anymore,” he muttered, turning his mobile on. The screen lit up.
John was silent for a while, taken off guard by the simple statement. “Yeah, well, so are you.”
When he stood, the world spun some, and he had to grab on to a nearby tree for support. But he slowly made his way down the hillside.
Sherlock sleeping was always a fascinating thing to John. He couldn't imagine how a brain like his ever slowed down enough to sleep.
“The woman from District 1, Kitty.” He said her name like it left a bad taste in his mouth. “Repellant creature.” He winced when John's fingers neared the wound.
John laughed a little to himself without taking his eyes off the books. “You know, for someone who enjoys asking invasive questions, you're especially cagey about answering even simple ones.”
“That's awful.”
Sherlock approached the cemetery after he was confident most of the people were gone, and so when he arrived, it was only John and Mrs. Hudson who remained. He let the world continue to move until Mrs. Hudson walked away. When it was only John left, talking to a tombstone, he stopped it.
“Don't applaud, Miss Adler.”
“Who is Harry?”
– but he was far too tired to care about his assumptions. “About them calling you and Mycroft in on the Hickman case.”
Their car pulled up in front of an old but well preserved building, an elegant hotel it looked like. The sort of place that stars would vacation at in between blockbuster movies, paparazzi snapping photos of them on the balconies.
isn't technically a lie.
The silence between them was filled only by the calming near-monotone narration coming from the speakers somewhere in the dark abyss above them.
fine."
When she left, he finally found a word that sounded right:
Now that John was awake, he began to feel the ache that permeated his body. Although ache was perhaps too kind a word for it. It was pain, pain made more intense by the stinging of the burns. He suppressed a groan, not very successfully.
“There's a serial killing I've been looking into, if that sounds more appealing to you.”
John had to force himself to not glance upstairs, a giveaway. “Where's what?”
“As someone whose life is already as public as yours? I'd recommend the truth.”
Sherlock started talking to the statue as he used to talk to the skull. As he worked, he would lay out all the methodology that went into his pieces. But just as often, when he spoke aloud, it was about the mundane, his running commentary that he usually kept locked up inside his head. Even though logically he knew the statue of John was as deaf as the skull, it brought him some measure of comfort.
“I think I already know why you're here.”
“Well this is better than what I planned for, so I have no idea what comes next.”
“Why?”
“Then why am I doing this?”
“That's how you knew all that stuff about me,” John said, setting his fork down. Sherlock had not touched a bite of his food. Instead he just smiled, his fingers steepled and his elbows leaning on the table.
“I have a bedroom.”
He didn't let him finish. Instead he just trailed a line of kisses along his jaw and said in a hushed voice, “I know. I know.”
“Christ, Sherlock, haven't you ever fought for anything? Don't you see any value in at least trying?” He hated the sharpness in his voice, and hated even more that Sherlock had struck a nerve so frayed and raw that he had been reduced to it.
But I would never ask him.
“Oh, well, it was one of my parents' favorite movies. Harry and I saw a lot of it when we were growing up.”
It was easier to reassure him with actions rather than words.
“English detective Sherlock Holmes has made a name for himself here in Italy in a matter of days. It is no wonder the sleuth is so well-known and widely loved in his home country. After a series of threats made against the Borghese were connected to the bombing at the Hickman Gallery in London earlier this year, Holmes made the trip to Italy in hopes of preventing another wide scale disaster. And he succeeded.” The subtitles continued to scroll at the bottom of the television as footage from the Borghese played, all the worried men and women in their gowns and suits, Sherlock front and center talking to the bomb squad. It looked like a helpful collaboration. The reality was that Sherlock was ripping into them for not doing a better job scanning the place for explosives before the event. John was never mentioned in these news reports. Now and then a magazine would include his name back in London, but for the most part, he was an almost invisible man, though if he was being honest with himself, he didn't really mind.
“Then what do you suggest I fucking do?”
He attempted a whole slew of witty responses he could give to that remark, but ultimately failed.
He had heard the reports from his men, that they'd lost three soldiers in the attack. His friend Bill had said that they thought they'd lost him as well. When John heard that, it jogged his memory.
“John?” Their heads snapped in the direction of the voice. It was the agent, having just appeared on the scene, blessedly a few minutes later than she could have. “You weren't answering your phone.”
“Anyone you want to say hello to while you're up here, Sherlock? Girlfriend or boyfriend?” Lestrade gave him a teasing grin.
Dawn had come, and he belonged to someone else now.
“I have no intention of ever doing that.”
“Had worse.”
“For Harry.”
"When I came to after the explosion, I didn't think about where Moriarty might be. He didn't even register." John heard the inflection and finished the thought for Sherlock.
But the first week or so he was back, he enjoyed it. He had seen so many terrible things in Afghanistan, things that would be burned on his memory forever. So he would stop his world when he felt the panic rise in him, and would go walk through Hyde Park, or along the Thames, and remind himself that there was goodness and beauty in this world. He felt like he had to keep reminding himself of this one fact. Not everything was blood and death. There were children playing in the park with their parents. There were gardens and beautiful homes. There was an entire world of art and music. And there was more goodness than evil.
The owner looked between the book and his face, more serious than John had seen him yet. Perhaps he had appeared more frantic than intended.
John smirked. "For trying to be normal, as you put it. Really, though, Sherlock, this is nice. And it wasn't a case of you not paying attention. Cathy and I only broke up a few days ago. I didn't mention it."
“All of it. You know what Mary told me? She said I wasn't meant for a normal relationship. And maybe she's right. Everyone around me is getting married and having children and going to their day jobs. Meanwhile I'm a doctor who barely practices and I split a flat with a mad detective.”
"It would seem so. They didn't find him. He must have had assistance aside from his snipers."
now).
John had never felt so defeated.
“No, I think you're damaged, delusional, and I would say you believed in a higher power, but the closest you come to that is believing in John Watson. That has always been the case. Acts like the one you two pulled are just elaborate disguises agreed upon by two people. What does your act say about you, then?” Sherlock shifted uncomfortably in his seat. “Are you feeling exposed?”
“Where did you even learn this?”
John held out one hand, palm forward. “Hey, listen to me. I'm fine.”
“We're stopping by a shopping mall.”
In the harsh glare of the bathroom light, he looked himself over, finding cut after cut, including a very impressive one at his temple that made him wince when he brought a finger to it. But he supposed that he was untouched compared to a lot of people.
“Mycroft.” An irritated flick of the cigarette over the ashtray, a little smoldering piece of paper falling.
“It's a taunt. This is no longer a case, John. You need to go.”
“Sister's past romantic attachment.”
He stopped, taking a second to wipe the look he was sure he had off his face before he turned around, offering a composed smile to John. “Yes?”
Mycroft's office at the Diogenes Club felt wrong. It held a false sense of coziness, the color palettes warm and earthy, the furniture old and elegant, the fire in the hearth welcoming in its lie. Because Mycroft himself made the room a lie by his own presence, the clinical coldness fit incorrectly into the room like a ring too small for a finger. And Sherlock, with his dark coat and pale skin, looked just as otherworldly, a ghost haunting the living, summoned in a séance.
John listened to the cheers erupt from the spectators, smiling and waving at them. The stylists had put together an amazing display. Even Sherlock seemed mildly impressed. John locked eyes with the man, who had been staring at the trail of glowing fire following John. And underneath the awe, John could see the smallest hint of fear. It felt so much more final now that they were here in front of the world. John watched as Sherlock corrected himself, faced forward, and wiped all trace of expression from his face.
“Well, they arrested her. That's all I know right now. Maybe I'll luck out and someone will kill her.”
“Sherlock, huh?” The boy nodded. “That's an odd name.”
,” John said, a little too loudly. A few of the nearby patrons cut their eyes to him. He sighed and lowered his voice. “Look, it's really not that complicated. We like the same things, we know the same people. She's smart and she's beautiful.”
,” he said sharply.
Still, John had no idea where Sherlock stood. Had he been intentionally patronizing? Was it really all an act?
Sic Transit
“Of course,” he said, feigning indifference.
He hated that he had snapped as soon as he did it, but the remark had rubbed him the wrong way, mostly because he was right. It really wasn't all that rewarding.
“No, I'm not in those rooms any more. I live in Baker Street.”
“But that would mean...but that's impossible.”
"Earlier, you did not finish your thought. Before what?"
John laughed lightly to himself and let himself drift back to sleep, arm wrapped around the detective's shoulders.
"Not a girlfriend?"
“No.”
John finally backed up, that one step feeling like miles, and for a moment Sherlock couldn't help but wonder if this was all some sort of cruel joke. He waited to be the punchline again. Things that appear too good to be true usually are. But John just smiled and said, “I'm serious, I really am. And it's not like I don't have your number.”
The only time Sherlock mentioned his time in Afghanistan again was when he pointed out that the limp he had seen when he met John was now gone.
“I'm just trying to decide how much to try and bring in today. You know the streets will be more crowded than usual.”
"Nothing surprises you."
John had no idea what to do with himself when he was back in London. The nights were long and full of nightmares. The days were longer.
“I think you had tried to break your fall and got scraped up a little.”
There were two men sitting in a pair of the red chairs. One had a haughty expression and an umbrella propped up next to him. The other was beautiful, and very bored.
"It exceeded my expectations, although that isn't saying much." They stood outside the theater on the sidewalk, the few other people out at that ungodly hour walking past them, off to their own homes.
“Yeah?”
“Don't I know it.”
"This is bad, Sherlock, really bad. This maniac is not going to just let us go. He didn't even want us to get out of that pool alive."
“No.” He shook his head, feeling suddenly tired. “No, I'd like to continue seeing your face. Please keep being in Baker Street. Please keep being alive. I thought I was dreaming, you know? Or hallucinating. I was questioning whether you were real of if my brain just concocted you from nothing to placate me.”
By two in the morning he had read a good piece of the collection.
“The poison. There's not really a sense in talking around it, is there? You're well aware that I know.”
“Obvious.” He ran his fingers over the touch screen, eventually finding his way to the camera, and jumping when the room around him appeared on the screen. He eyed it suspiciously before handing it back to John. “I have long since established that I am not where I once was. So would you be so kind as to enlighten me?”
John stood up and gathered all of the clothes from the suitcase, shoving them into his dresser drawers or throwing them quickly over hangers in the closet. He grabbed an extra set of sheets and laid one folded sheet on the bottom of the suitcase. The other he used to wrap the painting itself before laying it in the suitcase and zipping it shut. He pushed his clothes aside and slid the suitcase to the deepest corner of his closet, tucking it out of the way, carefully arranging the clothes and other luggage in front of it. Out of sight, out of mind. Sherlock had no regard for privacy, true, but he also had no reason to even bother looking
"Of course I
"I'm sick of not being able to see."
“I don't know.”
“Oh, you finally have one of those?” John heard Sherlock chuckle under his breath from across the room. Mycroft held back a glare.
, and win the game.” He held out one hand. “Here. Am I giving you the good hand, or the bad one? You tell me. Everyone says you're a proper genius. Prove it.”
“I rather liked the reptiles. There were so many gorgeous species of snakes. Some other children were there, and they were all terrified of them. I didn't see how anyone could be scared of such extraordinary creatures. There was also a special exhibit there that summer, about bees. I remember thinking that was amazing, and pestering my parents about getting some hives for our yard.” John smiled fondly at him, but Sherlock didn't see. “What was yours, then?”
“Last I checked, it was turning perfectly fine.”
“He has what you might call friends in high places.”
“But then we ended up friends.”
"I didn't say I needed you to listen."
“I have an international reputation,” Sherlock said softly, his voice thick. “Do
“After what we went through? Besides, we'll see plenty of each other from now on.”
“Good thing it isn't the arena, then.”
John felt a blow to the back of his head before his world went black.
“Supernovas,” she said, without pressing further. She knew she had made her mark.
“I have no problem admitting it, Sherlock. I'm terrified. And with reason. So don't tell me you're fine. None of us are fine.” Sherlock said nothing in reply. “Can I ask you something? What was that, during the interviews?”
The sky gave no answer. Sherlock wondered how long it would be before John gave up. Before he realized there was no way out. Eventually, Sherlock would have to find a way to leave him, to let himself be struck down by whatever the Capitol had waiting in the woods. John had to go home. Couldn't he see that?
And that was when he really remembered the ring as an actual object instead of merely a fleeting thought.
“Not entirely. There's more to it than that.”
Mary blinked back a few stubborn tears and shook her head. “I wish I believed that.” She knew that if there were women or children from the other Districts left in the arena with him that he would sooner kill himself than them.
John was still thinking on the strange turn the night had taken when he felt a hand very tentatively grab hold of his. He didn't even have to make a conscious decision to grab it back. It was an unexpectedly perfect moment in its simplicity. How could something as commonplace as two hands clasped together have such a powerful effect? John felt like he had proof of something he'd always suspected, that sometimes talking really was unnecessary. Sometimes it was what was left to silence that said more than any attempt at words could.
“Clearly.”
“It wouldn't be the first time.”
There was a delay. Sherlock could practically feel John weighing the pros and cons.
“Nothing, nothing.” Sherlock followed him into Baker Street, stepping out of the way so John could lock the door. He leaned against the wall at the bottom of the stairs, looking like he was barely able to remain standing. John held out his keys, and Sherlock stared at them in confusion for a second before holding out his hand, palm-up. John almost let them drop into his open palm, but instead placed them there carefully, and folded Sherlock's fingers back over them.
It was cold. And empty.
He would have to be more careful; he couldn't just leave the painting in an open suitcase, poorly concealed.
“No. In fact, Mycroft made an active effort to make my life as normal as he could. He found ways to talk our parents into letting him watch me instead of hiring help, for instance. He made excuses about immune systems when we had to go to parties or public functions. We were taught at home, so school wasn't an issue. For a while, I was convinced things would be all right.”
John said nothing more.
“Alone is what I have. Alone protects me.”
“Absolutely.”
“Then you might as well step off the platform before the countdown's finished, or throw yourself off a cliff or something and end it, since you obviously don't care whether you live or die.”
JW: It wouldn't be right of me to ruin
“There would have been a bigger outrage had they killed one of you than there would be if they allowed two victors,” Irene said from her perch in the chair across from John and Sherlock. “You couldn't have known. The Capitol was in an uproar over you two. And once you staged that display at the finale, John, that sealed the deal. Remember, they've made exceptions in the past with other Games, especially Quarter Quells.”
“One of the greatest artists of all time and he designed an elephant.”
Every piece of discarded armour presents a risk. I will not pretend it doesn't. But every risk presents a chance to find that protection elsewhere. And be made better as a result.
tributes just to have someone here who knew how I felt that I could turn to. Kate couldn't understand. She still doesn't, really. I scared her to death so many times right after I got back. No one can understand what people like us have been through except those who have experienced it first hand.” She sat back a little in her seat, but she was still leaning forward toward him. “You two have been afforded a rare opportunity. And you're throwing it away for what? A sense of superiority?” She shook her head. “You have the rest of your life ahead of you, and you will be miserable trying to get through it alone. No, don't open your mouth, don't say a word to me. You
“Is what true?”
“No, no,” John held one finger up. “No, I just live with him. We're flatmates. That's it.”
know about art?”
“So you've been busy. Are you still in your same rooms? Those rooms always felt so temporary. I hope in all this excitement you've found someplace more permanent.”
“What do you mean?”
Mike led him into the lab at Bart's with a knowing smile on his face. John looked with skepticism at the man at the end of the bench. Introductions were made, and phones passed between hands. The man rattled off a great bit of John's history, and he shifted uncomfortably, feeling like a specimen under one of the lab's microscopes. Even if John stopped the world for hours to examine the man, he would never have been able to read as much as he deduced in a matter of seconds.
“Still didn't think you'd actually do it. But John asked, so that makes sense.”
“Don't we all look like a happy family.” She looked between them, smiling, completely ignoring Mycroft. “And how did your day go, dear?” She turned to John, mimicking an interested parent.
Backstage, the stylists were waiting with Irene and Mycroft. Mycroft looked mildly pleased.
“John, quit playing with that thing and listen to me.”
out of you.” He flicked the knife up, putting a tear in the fabric.
John sat in silence for a while, staring at his hands. “You're wrong, you know.”
He went to the kitchen and started setting out food for dinner since Sherlock was apparently incapable of feeding himself. Behind him, he heard Sherlock finish the piece with a flourish, and once again, John almost spoke in the ensuing silence. But the first piece was almost immediately followed by a second, so he stayed quiet.
One night a few weeks later, John came home to find Sherlock sitting at his microscope in the kitchen, a James Bond movie playing on the television in the next room. He grinned as he walked up to the table, setting his keys down and pulling out a chair.
“I'm not sure I believe you.”
“Of course,” he replied without any further explanation as he checked the time. “Though I'm afraid I can't stay. Business calls.” There were scars striped across the back of his hand, skin puckered in multiple places. It was unlike any scar pattern John had ever seen. “Mrs. Hudson will take care of whatever you need,” he said, still glancing at his watch. Almost as an afterthought he added, “Welcome to Bell Song, Dr. Watson.” He gave a flick of the wrist and strode off to an expensive black car, which drove him down the gravel with a rumbling crunch.
Sherlock threw open the kitchen door and set off into the back section of the estate. John paused in the doorway, looking at the land laid out in front of him that had not been visible from the road. The grass was overgrown in many places, completely missing in others. Some sections were overrun by English ivy and creeping thyme, choking out even the weeds that attempted to grow near them. John stepped carefully outside to follow Sherlock, turning as he walked through the vegetation to look back at the house behind him. The gray stone was broken up by purple, wisteria climbing up as far as it could. John stumbled walking backwards looking at it, and feeling rather like he had been dropped in a jungle, turned to catch up with Sherlock. He carefully dodged a menacing looking shrub covered in thorns that was beginning to push its way onto what passed for a path.
But just as there was no good way to beg someone to stay, there was no good method for asking
John shrugged, taking a bite of his food. “No, not really. You'll tell me when you want to. It doesn't matter, so long as you're here now. The rest can wait.”
"Not planning on staying in London long, are you?"
Sherlock stared at the painting, hands in his pockets. “Not long. Once the morphine haze cleared from my head, it was obvious what Mary was after. And even though you denied having anything, I know you better than that. Honestly, I'm just surprised I didn't find out sooner. Maybe I just wasn't interested enough in the art side of the case, what with terror bombings to occupy me. But I always sort of believed it got destroyed and that the art world would just have to mourn its loss. But you, you valued the museums so much. There was no way you wouldn't have tried to protect the Vermeer if you could. It was one of your only comforts back then.”
KR: Over the past years you've built a reputation for yourself in the book world, and it all started with –
“Small blessings.”
“Don't tell me you were awake all night.”
“I'd say it's a safe bet. How many other mad bombers can be out there doing what he's doing?”
“The pirate.”
“Why were they so reluctant to just kill one of us in the arena?” Sherlock asked. Everyone stared at him. It was the most he'd spoken since they were declared victors.
His hands shook, and he was seconds away from texting Clara to tell her that he had fallen ill and may not make it to the actual intervention tomorrow, head swimming. It wouldn't feel like a complete lie. But he didn't reach for his phone. He only shut the book and turned to its front cover to hunt down the name of the man whose words pulled at him in this little room, who pulled him in nearly as strongly as Sherlock had from the moment he had laid eyes on him at the signing.
“People who are allergic to certain drugs can develop more serious, life-threatening allergies with repeated exposure.”
By the time their plane landed in Dublin, John had lost track of the flight. He slipped into conversation with Sherlock so easily. It was one of the only times in recent memory where he hadn't had to at least somewhat censor his thoughts. Nothing would shock Sherlock Holmes.
“You like him.”
“Just say it.”
“Yes.”
As the fog cleared from his head he heard the rushed and panting breathing from a few feet away. The girl from eight, Molly, backed up against a nearby boulder, a knife held out in front of her. She tried to steel herself, but her hands trembled. As John looked around the little clearing, surrounded by thick brush, supplies and weapons scattered around, he finally pieced it all together. He propped himself up with one hand and held the other out, palm to Molly, a silent
“It really is. What about you, dear? You were in the same gallery, yes?”
He spent the day at work sad and tired, wondering if Sherlock was lost to time yet or not.
It was all terribly inconvenient.
“For someone as observant as you...”
Sherlock came to an old house, one long since abandoned. It had belonged to a tribute's family, and when their child had not returned, neither parent had been able to cope. The memories in the house had only made them hurt worse. Sherlock had only been a child when it happened, his mother skirting around the word “hanged” like it was poison on her lips. All the children regarded the house with a sort of morbid fascination, which grew into a reverent respect as they aged. The house had never been filled with another family. Instead, it was allowed to fall to ruin. Sherlock had come to it before, even though everyone else steered clear of it. Even the neighbors would have nothing to do with it, letting the wood rot and the grass grow too tall.
Just as it was always John, it was, and always had been, Sherlock.
John sat down by some brush in front of a cliff, fiddling with his gun while he rested. His muscles would never relax, no matter how long he sat there. Everything was still tension, still arena paranoia. He wondered if tributes had ever had nervous breakdowns during the Games from the stress. It was a wonder that suicide, like the woman who stepped off her platform, wasn't more common.
John wasn't sure how much faith was involved, especially when it felt so much like fact to him. But he let her have it. Everyone needed something to give them hope.
John's eyes flitted between tributes, before he stopped, his mouth forming a silent “no.” And then the explosion came, one of the platforms disappearing in smoke and fire. A few other tributes' balance faltered, their eyes looking around frantically trying to process what had just happened. But John had seen it. He had seen the woman step off her platform. It was no accident. She had stared forward and taken one deliberate step. John's stomach sank. The woman had made her choice.
Since coming home, John had been haunted with dreams of the attack. He'd relived it a hundred times, and while the attack itself varied in his dreams, the part where The Man saved him remained perfectly preserved as it had happened.
The afternoon light was fading, slanting through the trees and casting shadows on the ground, but an indentation was still visible in the dirt. Sherlock frowned at it.
“So you jumped off a hospital? What if you had died?”
Married to a
Her brother looked terrified. Sherlock had never seen anything resembling panic on the man's face before. The blonde woman he always hunted with grabbed his arm, sympathetic while simultaneously reminding him to not do anything stupid.
“So?”
Sherlock finally looked at him, really looked at him, and John saw the slight redness in his eyes. “So we attend some tedious social functions every year. We smile at the camera and make the Capitol morons cheer. Hardly a massive alteration in lifestyle.”
“Then we can discuss what
When they walked in the front door of Baker Street, they ran into Mrs. Hudson in the hall. She started to greet John, but when she saw Sherlock standing behind him, she smiled.
Middle of the night, and a room that felt like an oven from the open balcony doors. John hadn't even tried to sleep, really, and none of his usual distractions were worth much in the heat and the glow of city lights. Sherlock had given up getting what he wanted from his phone, and had been reduced to smoking while pacing the balcony. John had chided him at first,
“Sherlock Holmes was shot tonight in his own home by the sole remaining associate of James Moriarty. A contract killer living under the alias Mary Morstan was taken into custody at the scene and was charged with two counts of attempted murder, those of Sherlock Holmes and his partner John Watson. Morstan has been living under her false identity for at least four years, sources say, working as a clinic nurse under a fake license. Holmes was rushed to a nearby hospital for surgery, and we are currently waiting for updates on his status. Holmes has already faced death at the hands of Moriarty's network once, and all of London is sending out their prayers that he will not have to face it yet again.”
John shook his head at him. "You really have no concept of nutrition, do you?"
“Hello, Mr. Holmes.”
“Say what you want about me, but don't you
John looked in the direction the bird had flown and saw it perched on a branch high up in a tree, staring down at them with its head cocked to the side.
Sherlock looked her over and said, “Housekeeper?”
“No, I'm not risking introducing something worse into this wound. We don't know what's in that water.” He knew Sherlock didn't really care about the logic behind it. He probably didn't care about the injury at all, but for once John hoped the cameras were on him and that Irene was paying attention. Maybe she'd find a way to get him clean water again. “How long have you been in here?”
"I know."
Sherlock beckoned him closer with a wave of his hand, and John came to rest beside him in that close bit of personal space that had always felt forbidden in the early days he'd know him. Sherlock pointed at a cluster of stars. “Do you remember a conversation we had about artists never really being able to capture the stars correctly?” When John nodded, he continued, “In this case it's a bit more literal. The forger painted a supernova that didn't happen until centuries after all the Dutch masters were dead. It's like I told you. Artists never really capture the stars.” John stared at him dumbstruck until he met his eyes. For so long he had felt the constant shadow of the painting, and now he couldn't believe it ever haunted him at all. The information was so impossible to process that he didn't know whether to laugh or cry or scream. “You don't have to carry this weight around anymore,” Sherlock said.
“You idiot,” John said, his smile widening. Sherlock felt the automatic
. Her pose wasn't offensive, but defensive. She wasn't going to kill him.
"There's always Tesco."
That weekend, Sherlock told him he had loose ends to tie up, and John took the opportunity to gain some distance from London, and so set off on the train with a bottle of whiskey in tow.
John's phone buzzed on the coffee table, yet again, and assuming it was Ella, he didn't even reach out to dismiss it. But it persisted, going off several times over the next few minutes. When he reached for it, it wasn't to read the texts, but to turn the phone on silent so he could more effectively ignore it. But as he held it in his hand, the screen lit up with a call instead of a text. And the moment he saw the name, he found himself consumed with a rapid and unrelenting dread.
“Sherlock, what did you think you were doing?!” He was livid.
The cocky way he said it finally coaxed a smile from John. He shook his head again. “You are ridiculous, you know that, right?”
Sherlock couldn't manage a single act of productivity that night, although truthfully he felt as if he hadn't been genuinely productive in years. But all he had managed was a cursory search of the thriller novelist online and a great deal of staring at the ceiling agonizing over the forgotten book. Had he left it behind in the shop? Had he dropped it somewhere on the way home? He almost wanted to call Mike and wake him up just to ask him if he had seen it lying around anywhere, but showed – he thought – remarkable restraint in not doing so.
complaining.”
Sherlock sat down with his back against the wall, and it suddenly dawned on John how tired he was.
Without another thought, I wrapped it around my neck, grabbing my coat from the hook on my door as I left.
It wasn't as if he had stopped writing entirely. Quite the opposite, in fact. It was just that most of what he wrote ended up thrown into the fireplace at home. What was the sense in keeping something that was sub-par?
“Your wife wasn't happy, no. Is it bad of me to say that I'm really happy that marriage fell apart?”
John laughed. “Well, I hope it was a good night, at least.”
He shook himself out of his thoughts and looked down at her. She appeared concerned.
John let out a frustrated sigh and rubbed his hands over his eyes. “You don't believe me.”
John wanted to find the second person and punch them in the face for their timing. It was one thing to pause time when he could do something useful, but he was in a hospital, and pausing time just meant a very long delay for the painkillers that were due from the nurse.
Though his head was beginning to kill him, he read on, and came to a poem that sounded vaguely familiar, perhaps a tiny piece of a long since forgotten literature class. But this time around, he could only read it in the context of Sherlock Holmes. He turned the page, his eye lingering on a stanza near the end of the poem. And for reasons he couldn't begin to understand, the stanza had the effect of a literary sucker punch, and forced him to finally close the book and walk away from it for the night.
The cannon sounded.
Tonight it was Auden, a frequent offender in the catalog of Sherlock's mind. He nearly hated himself for allowing the poem to bore into his brain. It wasn't obscure or particularly revolutionary, a poem taught in literature classes all over the globe. But it was the thing that, lately, kept him up at night, staring past the electrical glow of his laptop screen into the empty mouth of the hearth.
“Oh, you must have just run into Mycroft. I'm afraid he's always on the move.”
"Yes."
“You were worried you'd scare me off.”
It was something he had avoided skillfully, these questions about what he was working on now that
There was no way to know if there were cameras on them. Probably were, knowing the Capitol. But John couldn't shake the feeling of how
John's anger had waned, but only slightly. He looked at Sherlock with apology.
Their father stood from his chair, becoming different just as she had. Instead of the verbal boxer, he grew stony and silent for what felt like the longest time. John and his mother had watched the two of them stand there staring at each other, Harry's body clearly primed for ducking and running, his father's trying to conceal how instinctively his fists balled up.
“No, I mean, how are all these normal plants poisonous?”
Then the anger vanished. John sat down, his back leaning against the headstone. He rested his arms on his knees and stared up at the sky, his eyes partially glazed over. "Except I don't. That's the problem, Sherlock. I don't hate you at all. I never did. Just the opposite. And that makes it so much worse."
to feel like.
“Probably. But it's also a bit correct. The only thing that people don't tend to realize is that people in our positions don't choose to be attached to our sadness. It's just a fact of life. You can't escape certain things.”
John stared in horror at Sherlock, barely more than a silhouette on the roof of the hospital. His phone was clamped to his ear, and he didn't believe the words coming through it. It was nearly disorienting, so much so that he wondered if this was all a terrible trauma-induced nightmare. It wouldn't have been the first time the worst thing his sleeping mind could come up with was something terrible happening to Sherlock. But this was all too real. He could hear what sounded like tears in Sherlock's voice.
“Well, at least half of those people are imbeciles, if they're anything like the ones I've had to talk to since you've been away. Oh god, the woman's name is Pussy Galore. John, why on earth are you familiar with this movie?”
“Just think, you won't have to fulfill any major social engagements like this for another year.”
“Amazingly, no. Although I wish we had. He's a far better man than I am.” Sherlock gave the closest thing he could to a humble smile.
“If you're sure.”
“If I do this, you will not be coming back. Ever again. You won't be parading as human. You'll be one.”
Sherlock looked at him over the microscope. “Well you don't seem especially sad.”
Still, John couldn't help but make the effort to pretend that everything was fine. So Sherlock wasn't all that surprised when he walked over to stand by him on the edge of the room, looking out at all the other guests.
But he noticed things in the museums that he didn't notice before when he used them as an Afghanistan coping mechanism. Like how any dust that wasn't cleaned away stood out so much more because it had to be compared to the otherwise pristine surroundings. Or how people whispering echoed strangely in the larger rooms in a way that almost made them sound like he imagined ghosts would. Or how whenever a child would run across the poured concrete floors, it sounded like a smack of thunder.
“How does he not get caught?”
that coldness was the better option. And failing. Because no man who has no faith left in love would bother to write about it at such great length at all.”
Sherlock's first line coping mechanism had always been sarcasm, the equivalent of a magician using misdirection to hide the doves. So all he said, albeit with hesitation, was, “When you tell me who Harry is?” He hated that he didn't sound sure. The offhanded remarks always worked best when delivered with total certainty, but he didn't want to be offhanded to the point that he drove this man away in a rage. But clearly John Watson, while a constantly annoyed person professionally, clearly wasn't that way personally.
“To study what?”
“Because that
When morning came, he ventured out of his hiding place for fresh water, making sure he paid close attention so he could retrace his steps to it later.
"You don't look it, buddy. What's wrong?"
He looked up, hearing a groan. Sherlock almost left, worrying his noise would draw attention. But it was only a few more minutes before it was over.
"Quite." Sherlock heard the ping of an incoming text and paused to check it.
“At least the hallucinations weren't.”
That was what he kept telling himself, anyway.
“You say that as if it's unexpected.” Before John could speak, he added, “Though I suppose in all fairness, it probably is. But then again, so is immunity to poison.”
He could hear the faint clinking of bottles in the next room. Harry, desperately searching for a drink that she wouldn't find. She'd gone without for two days now. While John didn't approve of her drinking, he would gladly have supplied her had he been able to, just to keep away the withdrawal symptoms. But there was no money to be spent on an addiction. He had to make sure they stayed alive, not inebriated.
John laughed. “
If only John had known about the drama that played out in Sebastian's office that day.
But what awful sights had Sherlock really seen? Murders, sure. Violence and sadness. But wars? He was unfamiliar with those, and just now realizing he had wandered into one.
I don't care if you don't want to. Just do it.” Sherlock raised a gloved hand to push John's hand away, but stopped when John spoke again. “
“Bet you never saw
“John Watson.”
“I stole your room.”
“But I haven't told you.”
John almost let the words slip out: “I would miss you.” But he stopped himself, knowing that Sherlock would accuse him of pointless sentimentality.
Tell me about your books, your visions made/of flesh
to him for a while now. I hope he actually reads it.”
“What?”
“They either think that I'm a bastard, a freak, or they've come to expect it because it helps them. Of course, I don't tend to think of it as amazing myself – it's just logic after all – so it's easy enough to tune the rest of them out.”
“Yeah, well, sorry, but I'm not.”
fixed, but you've got to at least try! Sometimes I think you enjoy being miserable. You will get on with life, you will find other friends who mean just as much to you, and god willing you'll be able to wake up one morning without automatically thinking about what happened to Sherlock Holmes.”
“He was still just human, John.”
“I only remember important things.”
“The Capitol creates, John. When was the last time you saw a domestic dog with a print that large?”
John stood by his chair, watching as Sherlock glanced over the tabletops and bookshelves, all the little oddities still firmly in their places, right down to the skull on the mantlepiece.
John took a single step back, Sherlock finally turning his head toward him. No matter how long it took for John to look him up and down, to shake his head, to go through a hundred false starts, Sherlock remained silent, waiting on him.
“Well, yes, I imagine he was since he's probably behind all of this?”
me. We are going to put up a united front. We will make them like us. If either of us are going to make it out of this alive, that's what we have to do. I don't want a part of this any more than you do, but until the Games are over, we have to do whatever we can to make this work out to the best of our abilities. Now, at least
When he finally looked away, he rubbed his hands over his eyes and said, “How are we going to live anymore? Christ, how does anyone come to terms with this? We've killed people, Sherlock. We've seen people die. How are we going to get through the day?”
John let his eyes fall shut. He had nearly fallen asleep when he heard the beeping. He opened his eyes, looking around for the source, thinking his brain was creating the noise, or misinterpreting a bird call. But then, a minute later, after the sound grew steadily closer, a silver parachute fluttered into view, a box attached to it. It skittered to a stop on the rock ledge a few feet away from him.
It was hard to believe that it was finally safe to sleep again. So many nights of having to be on guard and running on nothing but adrenaline and panic. John thought it would actually take him hours to fall asleep, but exhaustion beat adrenaline, and it took only minutes.
"If we lived in that universe, you would be Q," John said, chuckling to himself as they walked down the hall of the theater.
It became a cycle inside his head. First he would wonder if he had been too harsh to Sherlock. Then Sherlock was too harsh. He should go back to his house again and try to reach him a second time. But then he would get angry again, and the whole process would repeat itself.
When John had shown up on Mary's doorstep that night, still wired and running on exhaustion and a mad sort of elation, he had expected the worst. Shouting, plate throwing, window breaking, a true sparring match. He hadn't expected Mary, dressed in pajamas, looking barely awake and more confused than angry.
“You're human now.”
John did a double-take, glancing between the woman and the painting and trying not to appear as if he was eavesdropping.
