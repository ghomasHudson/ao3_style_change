As he watched, he noticed Cas shifted often, like being still too long was uncomfortable. He rolled his shoulders often and knocked his head side to side every few seconds. His fingers twitched as well, but Dean knew he was in no danger of dropping anything no matter Cas’ discomfort. Angel senses or some shit.
Sam doesn’t sit down. He gazes at the room, at his brother strapped down to a gurney with I.Vs protruding from his arm. Castiel looks too.
about setting a course of action. But he knew one thing for certain. He was going to find a way to help Cas.
Dean doesn’t look away though when he says, “Thanks, Cas. It may have been simple and short, but it was a nice break.”
He nods his affirmative when he returns to the chair and Cas quips. “Last chance to back out.” With a smirk on his face.
in tattoos. There was no way Dean could catalog every single one, but one of the more prominent ones was on his forearm. A large dreamcatcher, with intricate work done on the ropes and the dangling pieces. It was bathed in rainbow colors like the man had a constant light reflection on his arm.
For the first time in a while, Dean takes note of Cas’ wings again. They’re gleaming, all black and iridescently holographic, lightly fluttering behind him. Were they out this whole time? More to add to the brain clouding haze hit list.
With his curiosity peaked, Dean begins searching in the large mass of black plumage for the source of the dark liquid. As he searches and smoothes the existing oil over the feathers, he recognizes the calm settle over him and rather than wonder what's happening, he settles gratefully into it. He's enjoying his high, of sorts, when he's pretty sure he finds one of the glands.
The only silver lining, if it could even be called that, was that the case had only been a couple hours from the bunker. So after dispatching the hell spawn and cleaning up their mess, Dean, Sam and Cas had headed home, with Dean’s foot heavy on the gas.
“Is there anything you can do? To combat it I mean. Any spell or something to manually boost your grace’s replenishment rate?”
Cas smiles wider. “It’s Harvest time. And a Google search showed me how you decorate and celebrate it in the twenty-first century.” He keeps smiling. He’s clearly excited.
"I’ll just be underpowered." Cas shrugs like it's no big deal. But Dean isn't stupid. Being an angel means everything to Cas. And it can't feel good to know you may never have your full strength.
"You don't want me to finish?" Dean knows he sounds petulant but he's a little put out by the fact that there's more he could do and Cas is- well he's rejecting Dean.
Cas’ finger circles some more, pushing, prodding, and eventually pressing in. It’s a strange feeling at first, having something going in. But his relaxed state ensures that it’s not uncomfortable. Cas pauses to look up and check on him and Dean opens his eyes long enough to nod for him to continue, before squeezing them shut again.
Cas nods patiently. “Just because they aren’t ‘out’ doesn’t mean another Angel or demon cannot injure them. Angels and demons can exist on multiple planes at a time, which means a demon could theoretically injure my wings. It’s not a common occurrence.”
The bandage applied and Dean’s shirt back on, the aftercare instructions gone over, and Sam waiting on him by the door still talking to his own artist, Dean pulls out his wallet, and passes Cas enough cash to cover a tip and then some.
“Cut the crap, I know you need your wings groomed.” Dean decides beating around the bush has gotten him nowhere. Time for a new tactic. He's going to be straightforward and maybe even a little persistent. Well mostly straightforward. If Cas truly doesn't want this, there is nothing Dean can do.
He nods to Dean anyway. “Your welcome. If I don’t see you again… “ What did you say to someone who had seemingly made peace with their grim fate? Someone who… maybe didn’t deserve the fate they’d been dealt. “…well, goodbye, Dean,” His voice comes out soft and thick. He doesn’t like his first day on suicide watch.
Sure, he and Cas had a profound bond or whatever, but that didn’t constitute sexual feelings. Angels didn’t even have sexual feelings. Right? Well they had something, since grooming each other’s wings was apparently sexual. And Cas never denied angels have sex, just that he personally had never had reason to engage. Weren’t they all related somehow anyway?
"Sensitive, huh?" He breathes out. He continues straightening other parts and smoothing the oil out over them. Where the oil dries on the wings, a holographic sheen shines. Cas' wings are black, but they're also rainbow looking when the light hits them right. It's-
Cas shrugs. “I spent the night.” He flicks his eyes to Dean quickly, before focusing back on Sam. “I think I’m gonna stay a while if that’s okay.”
Maybe it was for the best Dean thought. Cas had been awfully snippy most of the times Dean did encounter him. And it was sort of a progressive thing. The first couple of days were fine, Cas had always been somewhat blunt, it was something Dean liked about him. But as the week had carried on, Cas had gotten more and more short with him. Dean didn’t feel like the attacks were personal, Cas had snapped at Sam too, so he had been letting it slide.
Dean works with a small smile on his face while they clean up the sight. An old warehouse. It’s always an old warehouse. He continues to take notice of Cas and is disgruntled to see that Cas still shifts around a lot. He still arched his back quite a bit and rolled his neck around like it was an endless cycle of discomfort. Dean was going to find out about it.
Dean attempts to get a grip on his wild running thoughts. “Where are you going?” He blurts out. At least he got something out.
“I-“ Cas seems at a loss for words. He seems slightly panicked. But then he resolves his face into an unnatural calm. “If you wish to help me with this, I guess I cannot refuse you.”
“I’m just sayin’ Sammy, we should really think about-.” Dean cuts himself off as he walks into the bunker looking around with wide eyes.
On this particular day though, Sam had announced he was off to talk to Rowena about some spell stuff or whatever. Dean had basically rolled his eyes. He was highly suspicious of his brother spending too much time with the witch, but he could produce no actual reason for arguing the topic so he had grunted his agreement and went about fixing his coffee.
, Dean wonders if this is part of that too. Does the person doing the grooming also benefit from this? The feeling had come over him first in the shower. A calm that settled his mind and allowed him to mostly focus on the task of grooming. It felt much the same now. It stopped him from thinking too hard about all the outside stuff, like how Cas may really feel, or how
Even over the roar of the water he can hear Cas’ breathing becoming more labored and decides to check on him.
Castiel nods. He knows all about abusive fathers. But it still didn’t explain a capital punishment. So he raises his eyebrows for Dean to continue.
“How about we pull over? There’s a backroad up here that just leads to a small lake. We can stretch our legs and then get back on the road.”
"Sam says this stuff is gentle so…" He trails off not knowing what else to say, mostly asking for permission.
“Got a live one for you. Simple shit. I already drew up the design.” And he nods to a station next to his own. Cas takes the design, looking it over and then to his colleague, likely in a silent question. The first man directs his gaze to Dean and Cas’ follows. He smirks. And Dean immediately bristles.
A little while later Cas shuts off his gun, and Dean opens his eyes to find him blotting the skin carefully. “Go check it.” He rumbles, his voice softer.
“Uh yea.” He says as his brain short circuits at the idea of Cas- flirting? Dean might actually die.
They climb out and Dean walks a few paces towards the lake. The fresh air that hits him is crisp and light. It’s a safe feeling. He can hear the night bugs in the background and there’s a faint breeze. The night isn’t too still and overall feels alive, in the best kind of way.
He must have been staring hard, not that he really cared; it was his job to watch the man, because at some point Dean looked up to meet his eyes and gave him a half smirk-smile.
Dean had had his last supper the day before and Castiel had had his last ‘last supper’ as well, for as soon as he got home after saying goodbye to Sam, he drafted his resignation.
“No.” Cas says with a worn down tone. “The best I can do is hope that in time it will pull ahead and I’ll finally have enough to heal my wings, which will replenish the rest of my grace.”
As he works, Dean gives the man another proper once over. Cas has a tattoo on his neck- ouch- in the shape of a heart that reads lover boy on a ribbon going through it. Behind his ear, is an upside cross. He has several piercings in his ear, including a gauge with a piece of black jewelry in it. He also has an eye brow piercing, twin nostril piercings, a septum piercing, and snake bites below his bottom lip.
Dean blows out a breath of relief. Beside him, Sam’s laughs have finally died down. “I’m gonna go wash up.” He jerks a thumb over his shoulder in the direction of the bedrooms and showers, looking relieved to excuse himself.
“I’d love to watch the rest with you. And you can talk to your hearts content.” Dean‘s voice was soothing and Cas wouldn’t mind hearing it speak regarding other activities.
“Aside from my back groaning at me from sleeping on the hard ground… good.” Mentally, he feels great.
"Lovers." Dean says so quietly he's not sure Cas heard him. But Cas is an angel and of course he heard him.
“I don’t know, Cas. Would a break be nice? Sure. But I don’t think I’d be able to turn off my brain to enjoy it. I’d be too busy worried about what I
His mind whirled with the little bit of information he had been given and the questions he now had. It wasn’t that Dean was unwilling, oh he was willing, but he had no idea how to first broach the topic with his winged best friend and second if Cas was even willing. Surely Cas didn’t feel that way about Dean which is why he had told Dean in the first place there was nothing to be done.
As Cas sat down across him, Dean eyed him. He knew Cas could feel his gaze and it annoyed him ever so slightly that Cas didn’t look up. Ignoring him. He blew out a breath and squared himself.
They fall quiet again with that hanging over them, and as he works through pulling out the last of the feathers, he feels that calm settle over him again. Going back to Cas' words about
has a certain... effect and because he’s Dean Fucking Winchester, “You gotta buy me dinner first.” He winks at the other man and makes his exit over to his brother. He can’t be sure but he’s pretty sure he hears Cas chuckle.
“We should take a vacation.” Cas says thoughtfully after a few minutes of silence. “Haven’t you always wanted to take one? Or retire?”
Dean focuses back on his task, starting to spread the oil on the straightened feathers and pauses. He stares. Hard.
Dean had almost gotten the feeling the angel was uncomfortable. But whether that was physically or mentally, Dean wasn’t sure. He tried to give Cas space since everybody was entitled to days to cope with shit. Dean had his fair share. But after this many he was starting to get a little worried.
Cas stares at him for so long Dean wonders if he’s actually going to say anything. Eventually he opens his mouth. And closes it. And opens it again. He looks like a fish gasping for air. He lets out a breath with a resigned but determined look on his face. He fixes his full intense gaze on Dean.
"Like I said, I don't wish to make you uncomfortable. You've done more than I could ever ask of you. I'll go." And he makes to get off Dean's bed.
In Dean's room, Cas stands awkwardly in the middle, obviously not knowing where to sit with wet boxers. Dean grabs two clean pairs out of his dresser before thinking about it and tosses one to Cas.
Strangely he feels another odd rush of affection. Though Dean prides himself on taking care of those around him, it was obvious Cas had the desire to take care of Dean as well. And well, Dean liked it. Liked that he meant enough to somebody that they wanted to take care of him.
embarrassed. About the state of his wings. Because angels were proud creatures and the state of their wings reflected the image of the angel himself, the book had said.
When his senses finally quiet, he squirms under Cas, silently telling him to move. Cas doesn’t get the memo.
"Dean." Cas groans out and Dean takes that as encouragement to continue. He's only ever been given blow jobs, never given one. In fact, this is his first time being so close to another man's dick… ever. Dean had never let this part of his sexuality see the light of the day. Better late than never, he figures. If there's anybody he's going to explore this with, he's glad it's Cas. Even if it's going to ruin him for anybody else, man or woman.
Dean berates himself. Cas trusts him to groom his wings, so Dean needs to get control over his wayward thoughts and inclinations.
Cas’ eyes dimmed to his regular blue and Dean couldn’t help but be awestruck. Though he regarded Cas as his own… (person?) being, Dean couldn’t deny Jimmy Novak’s eye color did something for him. Hell, Jimmy Novak’s
As Dean and Cas pulled into the only motel within miles after an arduous hunt, Dean was looking forward to a bed to fall into.
“Nothing happened, they just don’t have any rooms. So I’m gonna keep drivin’. Gonna need you to talk to me to keep from getting too comfortable behind the wheel. We’ll drive till we find another one.” He’s not usually this pushy, at least not with Cas, but he’s in no mood to argue. He starts the car before Cas can voice a complaint and whips back onto the freeway.
Dean tried to fight the blush spreading across his face but clearly wasn’t doing a very good job. The young man reached up and ran his fingers across Dean’s crimson stained cheeks. “Don’t be shy,” the Omega cooed as he placed his hand on Dean’s thigh and curled his fingers around it. “Let your inner Alpha come out and play,” he whispered as he nuzzled the side of Dean’s throat.
“You hear that?” Gabriel bragged with a shit eating grin as he sauntered back to his seat and plopped down beside Sam. “
“Does that feel good, my Omega?” Dean asked as he spread his fingers open, stretching Castiel, preparing him for their mating.
Dean let out a rumbling growl has he slowly rocked in and out of Cas’ body, keeping the rhythm languid. “I love how you taste,” Dean licked and nipped at Cas’ sweaty throat, “so sweet and delicious.”
Dean Winchester’s inner Alpha’s obsession was none other than the sixteen year old Omega son of his next door neighbor.
“Exactly.” Ellen nodded. “Now that Castiel’s inner Omega knows his mate’s near, he’s just going to keep getting worse until it gets bad enough a doctor will need to be called in.” She blew out a deep breath. “And with how they were raised on the compound, how leary they are of medications, I think that would scare him a hell of a lot more that some cuddling with Dean.” Ellen looked up into Bobby’s eyes. “So, now that you are as up to speed as I am, go on and take that,” she handed the pitcher back to her mate, “to Dean’s room. Then you can decide if you want first shift.”
“Oh, my God,” Dean stared at him incredulously, “are you serious right now? Look...” He knelt down slowly beside the man, keeping a good distance away as to not spook him or make him violent, and met his eyes. “I’m a
“God, you are truly beautiful, little Omega,” Dean whispered reverently and Cas flushed at the praise.
“You two make the most of Castiel’s heat! Get started on some younglings for Auntie Ro to spoil rotten.”
considered letting Cas do it. But, no, mating Cas for the first time was not going to be in his living room. “Next time,” Dean said quickly, reaching down and lifting Cas up, the Omega quickly getting the idea and wrapping his legs around Dean’s waist.
, Cas. I’ll be on your floor, unable to move, exhausted and falling apart, my stomach eating itself from the inside out and-”
“Yes,” Castiel nodded as he tracked his mate’s movements. “Quarantining was common with wide spread diseases like tuberculosis.”
“Oh,” Castiel whispered absent-mindedly. “Oh!” He repeated, his eyes widening when what Dean had implied registered in his lust addled brain. “Told you,” the Omega grinned impishly, “I told you the scales on your sheath would part and reveal your cock with sexual stimulation.”
“Okay, you know I got your back.” Dean pressed a quick, chaste kiss to his mate’s lips before turning to the others, his arm wrapped around Castiel’s waist. “Alright, boys, lets go gank ourselves an incubus.”
“Okay, Ellen,” Dean agreed, glancing once more at Castiel surrounded by their friends and family before following Ellen into the kitchen to clean up. As he helped bag up what was left of the chips and put away the burger fixings, he couldn’t help but feel nervous.
Castiel’s eyes widened and Dean felt his cheeks flame up. “I, uh, thought I would tell you, because…” He stopped, clearing his throat again and looking away.
The omega didn’t have to go far to find his mate. A few steps into the living room, and he spotted his alpha. There by the blue spruce Dean was down on one knee, eyes locked on Castiel’s as he held out an open little black velvet box.
Dean bobbed his head from side to side thinking it over. “It’s a damn good guess, I say we check it out.” He looked over at his mate and the Archangel who both looked clueless as fuck. “Besides, we can’t stay here all night.” He hitched his thumbed over at Cas and Gabe. “Judging by the looks on their faces, I say neither of them have got any better ideas. So, police station it is!”
Dean glanced over at Sam, then bent down to pick up his basket, dumping it into the cart. He sighed and took Sam’s empty basket, nodding for Castiel and Lucifer to empty theirs -- albeit they did so more neatly -- before taking their empty ones. “I didn’t mean for you to think that Ellen would be
Castiel grinned at how easily the playful banter flowed between them as he walked over to the refrigerator and put back the remainder of the pie before he pulled out the homemade vanilla bean ice cream from the freezer. The Omega let out a small purr at the warm feeling of right he felt from being here, in this house, with Dean.
“Please,” Cas reached up, gripping Dean’s hair hard between his fingers, guiding his Alpha to his exposed throat, his other hand gripping tight to the Alpha’s knee on the other side of him. Dean’s nose brushed against the shell of Castiel’s ear, his tongue darting out to taste the saltiness of his skin, before he found his spot and sank his teeth in.
“Oh,” Castiel whispered as he lowered his gaze to the table. “I’m so sorry, Gabriel. I’m sorry you are unclean like,” his breath hitched, “me.”
“I would like that very much,” Castiel replied, shifting slightly so he was still pressed against Dean’s side but able to reach for his burger. He took a big bite, moaning as he chewed.
Castiel smiled shyly up at Dean as Jo continued to explain all the merits to waiting last minute to do one's assignments.
Dean stiffened in his seat and Castiel’s hands shook as he picked up his discarded straw wrapper. “Asmodeus, a man over twice my age,” he whispered as he started ripping the thin paper to bits. “He took a liking to me almost immediately and my mother and father were thrilled. They said he’d make a damn fine Alpha for me. So, they made the match and promised me to him once I finished my schooling.”
“Hell yeah,” Dean replied as he placed his ticket on top of Castiel’s and moved around the counter to get a cup of coffee. “As a history professor I find the place very fascinating, and I figured as a doctor you would too. I mean, did you know because tuberculosis was so extremely contagious and at epidemic proportions that those living with it could not be allowed to live amongst the general population.”
“Soooooo,” Gabriel grinned as his eyes flickered back and forth from Dean and Castiel. “How’d ya meet?” He asked as he snatched up the muffin that had been taunting him and crammed it in his mouth.
“Did you-” Cas voice cracked, thick with emotion. He gave Dean’s hand a squeeze as he turned to face his mate. “Did you do all this for me?”
There was the shuffling of more people coming out onto the pavement, Benny’s hushed voice as he either told them to go back inside or to fuck off, but Dean could only stare at Castiel. His eyes were bloodshot, still full of tears, but so damn beautiful it made Dean’s heart ache.
“I know,” Castiel smirked. “I tried one last night after I made them. I couldn’t even choke it down. I had to spit it out.”
When they returned from touring Greece and it’s islands the first thing they did was head to Atlantis. They had missed their nest, their home. They had also missed their family. Everyone had been thrilled to see them hugging them both tightly and Triton demanded to hear all about their trips at dinner that night. They spent a month in Atlantis, waiting until Castiel’s quarterly heat had passed before planning their next trip.
“I’m sorry, sir, we’re at full capacity.” A young woman tells him as she pulls out a ‘No Vacancy’ card to set on the counter.
“Novak!” He hears one of his coworkers call. “Shift change!” Dutifully following orders, Castiel stands and prepares to make his exit.
The main event! In case you somehow missed all signs, formal warning: it gets explicit. *The mildly dubious consent comes into play here. Both characters experience a brain fog caused by 'hormones' but they both consent to the effects and their consequences. This chapter is also considerably longer.
Dean’s face flames at Cas’ words. He’s… touched. Sure, Sammy had tried to get him to talk about feelings over the years, but Dean just wasn’t a touchy-feely type person. Not the mental kind anyway.
Castiel should probably think his answer through. A memorial is tough any way you look at it. But he knew his answer as soon as Sam had asked. “I would.”
After a few minutes Cas tugs Dean's hair a little harder and Dean lets his dick fall from his mouth with an obscene pop. Cas is panting. Had he been panting the whole time? Dean isn't sure, he was lost to the world sucking Cas' dick. "As good as that is," Cas says breathlessly. "It's not how I want to finish." Cas was close to finishing? If Dean's chest puffed out a bit nobody had to know.
Cas smiles, a small and soft one. “Yes, Dean.” And with that, he gets to his feet, surprisingly well, despite being tipsy, and hauls Dean to his. Dean is not in as good as shape Cas is, and in a startling show of faith and trust, rests his weight against Cas, silently asking for help. Again.
When he’s sure he’s plucked all the problem feathers, he drops his hands, looking around his bed and the floor. It’s littered with black feathers.
The eighteen hours he goes without seeing Dean wrack him. He feels like his world has shifted. He’d never had such a conversation with the other inmates. Most of them preferred not to talk about their crimes and that was fine for the officers. It kept the peace and what little respect could be extended considering the circumstances.
Cas lifts his hand to Dean’s forehead and Dean immediately feels the rush of grace course through his body healing whatever Cas had seen, and Dean hadn’t even registered yet. His breathing returns to normal and he just
Dean doesn’t wanna sleep, he wants to stay up and be with Cas. But he knows he’s not gonna last much longer, his eyes had gotten heavy in the time they’d spent lost in each other. “You’re gonna be here, right?”
In the morning, when he wakes to bright sunlight, he finds Cas next to him, seemingly dozing. But he knows better. Cas doesn’t sleep.
He takes notice of Cas in a different way now. The angel was still looking uncomfortable and it still wasn’t sitting right with Dean. Cas catches his gaze and Dean does his best to school his features into a more relaxed face.
Eventually his shoulders slump once Cas leaves the room. He heads to the kitchen with the idea of a late night unhealthy snack, because fuck Sam and his healthy shit.
Dean doesn't think he's ever seen anybody have a lightbulb moment. That was reserved for cartoons and kid shows. But looking at Cas now. Dean watches as his face goes from resolve to shock to- acceptance?
, and Dean wastes no time, zipping over to the coffee maker. To his surprise, it’s already on and there’s fresh coffee in there.
He makes a face. “Gross. He’s my brother. This is his birthday present, matching tattoos.” And he rolls his eyes for emphasis on how lame he finds the whole thing.
Once Cas is done stretching his wings, he brings them back to their original resting place. “The next step is fairly easy. Just go through and straighten any feathers you see that look crooked or out of place. This shouldn’t take long at all.”
“Please. Cas. I’m ready. I need you. I want you. Please. I need more than your fingers. Cas.” He whines.
Cas sighs lightly and shifts up and off Dean. He immediately misses the contact. Dean startles when the mess on his stomach and partly on Cas’ disappears instantly. The mess
Cas shrugs. “It just... does. I don’t really know how to explain it. It’s just meant to be pleasant to the groomer. It resonates their favorite scents.” Cas pauses, tipping his head to the side, obviously thinking. Then, “What does it smell like to you?”
Dean makes his way through the bunker again, taking in all of the decorations Cas obviously spent a lot of time on. It was nice. It felt good to be at a peaceful enough time, they could do something as mundane as
scent invades his senses. Sweet and earthy with a hint of tanginess. The scent turned flavor explodes on his tongue and he wraps his entire mouth around Cas' head.
The placement was a good one. It wasn’t so good, he could nod off, but it was bearable. Dean kept his breathing steady and though he couldn’t fall asleep, he did eventually close his eyes.
“Dean.” Cas says firmly. “I want to be with you, wherever you are. I proposed leaving because I thought it was what you wanted-“
Dean doesn't have too much time to dwell on it though, because after his statement, Cas proceeds to remove his own boxers. Only Cas could make taking off boxers look graceful, Dean almost rolls his eyes. Said eyeroll is promptly paused by the sight of Cas' dick. It stands proud, much like Cas and Dean's mouth waters. He was ready for other activities but they seem to fall to the back of his mind as he takes in his angel in all his glory.
It was obvious to anyone who bothered to take note something was wrong with Cas. And Dean was a little annoyed at himself he hadn't taken better notice before now. Knowing it was going to come with a snippy attitude, Dean braced himself to broach the topic with his best friend. He didn’t want Cas here being uncomfortable.
The hunt had taken much longer than either of them particularly planned and he was ready to visit dreamland.
Cas keeps his massages going, getting Dean acquainted with his hand being down there, applying more pressure at times and others just grazing.
Dean feels his face fall. He hates seeing Cas like this. He knows Cas struggles with feeling useful. Like being an Angel is the only thing he can offer. And Dean himself has added to this insecurity his best friend feels. He's been trying to make up for it when any opportunity presents itself.
He feels Cas’ fingers on his chin pulling his face back to look at Cas. His eyes have to be filled to the brim with unshed tears. He holds them in though. Cas searches his face for what feels like an eternity but in reality was probably only a few seconds. “You don’t want me to leave.”
None of this took away from the fact they were still the most magnificent thing Dean had ever seen. He reached a hand up to touch but stopped himself. This was an intimate act he reminded himself, and he should get permission first. He glances at Cas, who nods his head once.
It’s been a long time since he’s just looked at stars. He recognizes a few of the constellations his Dad showed him. Back when John Winchester wasn’t hell bent on revenge. The same ones he pointed out to Sammy when they were younger.
Dean leans in close, dazed. "What do you want, Angel?" He rests his head on Cas' shoulder, keeping his hands in the wings, still moving, still stimulating, inhaling that intoxicating -arousing- scent. Cas pants at the obvious onslaught of sensation.
Like Dean is somehow wrong here. “Times have changed. Of course, some people still celebrate the original meaning. But unless I’m mistaken, we’re not growing crops out back. So we will celebrate the “basic housewife” way. And he uses air quotes and everything when he says it.
Cas points up to the sky “If you look below the Big Dipper, you can see parts of Hercules. And if you look over there, you can see Leo. The constellation for this time of year.” Cas shifts his hand and Dean does his best to follow. He thinks he sees what Cas is talking about, but he doesn’t really care. Just lying here is good enough.
"Uh, the- the end of the bed is fine." He stumbles over several words and feels his face impossibly heat up more.
Missing out on what? Cas was Dean’s best friend. And best friends didn’t walk around showing each other their bodies. Dean needed to get his head out of his ass.
“I don’t think you realize what you’re agreeing to.” He finally says. And it looks like it pains him to say it. Great. Cas definitely doesn't want anything other than friendship. It was fine though, Dean is prepared to handle this. It's not like he thought-
“Right. Well, uh, it was fun while it lasted.” Dean snaps his mouth shut before anything else stupid can fly out. Maybe he doesn’t need that haze after all.
“Doesn’t have to be.” He says coyly. “You know I usually order this much because my sasquatch brother swings by to raid my kitchen, but he’s standing me up tonight. I’m short a movie companion.” He tips his head to the side indicating his TV.
Dean glances at Cas and finds him staring at the sky. “The constellations change?” It was a concept he doesn’t think he’d ever be able to grasp. They all looked the same to him. Even after decades.
“What brought all this on, anyway?” He was grateful for the conversation, it was keeping him engaged, but Cas never brought up this type of stuff. Did
"I love you." He says back and tilts their heads together again. Now that that was out of the way...
Dean sets to work, eager to feel that calm again. He smoothes through the feathers finding the crooked and bent ones easily. Like Cas said, it seems to move quickly and easily. When the feeling doesn't immediately come over him, he needs a way to settle his mind.
Cas rubs a wipe across his entire pectoral before laying the paper in the area Dean had gestured to earlier. “Go check the placement in the mirror to be sure.”
Cas looks at him seriously. His voice is clouded with want and impossibly deep. It's always been deep, but desire clearly throws it down several more levels. "What do you want; tell me."
Grunts and groans and the sound of skin slapping against skin filled the room along with the scent of sex. Dean’s fingers dug into Castiel’s hip, his nails leaving crescent shaped marks in their wake. Each thrust pulled more keening pleas from his Omega; Castiel cried out, pushing back just as hard as the snap of the Alpha’s hips, meeting him thrust per thrust. The edge of the silk panties stimulated them both as it caressed Dean’s cock and Castiel’s rim.
“Snowman fixins,” Dean opened the sack as he continued talking. “Okay, so I don’t have coal coal but,” he pulled out a small bag. “I have
“It’s nice to see what true love looks like again.” Dean and Cas looked down at William who had been watching their little moment. A soft,
Dean tentatively reached out and took one in his hand. He gave it a gentle squeeze. It felt firm, slightly springy, not a drop of water was seeping into it making it mushy. The Alpha brought it to his mouth and took a huge bite, groaning as the flavor of chocolate and cinnamon burst across his taste buds.
Castiel looked out at rows upon rows of gravestones and mausoleums, some recently placed, others cracked and crumbled. Epitaphs that were carved into the stones were covered with mold and an overgrowth of weeds. The cemetery trees covered most of the expanse, leaning down towards the headstones as if to offer some company to those who long since had stopped receiving visitors.
“Ouch, fuck!” Castiel hissed and cursed as Dean ran his fingers over a large knot on the back of his head. “That hurt! I’m telling you that hurt!”
Dean blew out a slow breath and pulled his jacket down, straightening out his shirt underneath. He didn’t know if he was relieved or disappointed by that fact, but he was already counting on finishing up the damn bottle in the car by the end of the night.
“You feel so good,” Castiel whispered. “The way you touch me.” The omega purred as Dean’s finger tips trailed up his slick soaked thighs. “So fuckin’ soaked for you, Alpha,” Castiel nuzzled against Dean’s throat, “wet and ready for your knot.”
Castiel eyes widened and he clapped his hands over his mouth. Not only had he just yelled at and talked down to an Alpha, but he felt…
Dean let out a contented hum as he looked around the shore, sighing softly when he thought about the many nights he spent out here looking for Castiel.
Ellen nodded and Castiel glanced at Bobby. “Go on then,” Bobby said with a curt nod of his own. “Take your plate and Dean’s up with you. El and I will come talk to you boys in a little bit.”
Dean pressed in, past the tight ring of muscle, moaning at the hot wet heat clenching around his finger. Gods that would feel amazing around his knot. At the mere thought, Dean felt his sheath parting, his cock lengthening, and sliding against Castiel’s scales and lower abdomen.
“Mmm, I think I have found my calling,” Castiel groaned around the first bite. “I’m gonna open a shop that specializes in all sorts of marijuana edibles!”
the others like that?” he asked as he flipped to examine all the other autopsy photos. “They are,” he confirmed before Castiel had a chance to answer. Sam slid the file to the middle of the table for the others to see. “But why? How did you know from the coloring of the lips we are dealing with an incubus?”
, I guess,” Dean admitted as he handed his mug to Castiel and grabbed the throw blanket from the back the couch to lay across their laps. He took his cup back from the Omega, smiling as Castiel laid his head on his shoulder. “The company is definitely the best part.”
“Well, that was a show-ho-ho-ho!” Gabriel broke the silence with a loud jeer, quickly followed by the cheers of the rest of their family sitting around the table. The couple on the floor jumped, blushing at the realization they had forgotten they were not alone.
Dean growled, a deep sound that rumbled from his chest, coming directly from his inner Alpha. He pulled his Omega’s head to the side, scenting along Castiel’s throat finding his bite before lapping at it possessively. The Omega’s movements faltered slightly at the ministrations, hot lust pumped through his veins at each swipe of his mate’s tongue. His hole fluttered as slick poured from his needy hole, soaking his boxer briefs and sweatpants. Lust blown eyes met Castiel’s, and the Alpha’s nostrils flared, taking in the aroma of his mate’s juices.
could pull him out. The idea of Cas not wanting to continue would be enough to halt any haze. Surely, angels had consent built into this shit, right?
He thinks to himself. He thinks he has for a long time. It would explain a lot of their... moments. Those damn tears are threatening to fall again. But he needs to get through this. “I- lo-“
Cas extends his wings from his back to stretch them to the far corners of the room. As he does, he and his wings visibly shudder.
He finishes up soaping one wing and directs Cas to stand back under the water so he can rinse it thoroughly. It takes a while, there’s a lot of feathers to comb through and a lot of suds to rinse. But he manages and once he’s satisfied the feathers are completely soap free he starts and repeats the process on the other wing.
“I think that’s it, Cas.” Cas lifts his wings to- stretch?- them and they tremble like a dog shaking water off. It would be comical if it wasn’t one of the coolest things Dean had ever seen.
This time when Dean answers, he’s wearing gray sweatpants- he clearly knows what he’s doing- and a simple black v neck t-shirt. He’s barefoot. And smiling. He opens the door wider, indicating Cas to come inside. “So I just realized I didn’t get your name.”
Dean whimpers when he feels Cas pull both fingers out. He cracks his eye open to see Cas reach for more wing oil and then plunge two fingers back in. Dean’s back arches at the contact and
really feels. How this is an act reserved -albeit not exclusively- for lovers. All of his concerns seemed to fall to the back of his mind. Everything just seemed right in the world, Dean grooming Cas' wings.
“I think I’m willing to do what I can to help you.” That was as much as Dean was willing to let on at the moment. “Isn’t that what matters? I don’t want you to be uncomfortable for who knows how long. I wanna help.” Dean was firm in his stance and he hoped it conveyed to Cas.
Gritting his teeth and looking anywhere except Cas, Dean yanks his own pair down in record time and quickly steps into the new pair. He almost falls over from how fast he's moving, but he manages to remain upright, saving himself from mortal embarrassment.
“You’ll start with pulling out any feathers that seem loose, the shower should have helped with loosening them even more. They should come out easily. Don’t worry about pulling healthy ones out, they won’t break off.”
Castiel had his bottom lip between his teeth, muffling each groan and Dean wanted to hear them all, needed to hear every noise Cas was going to make. He found Cas’ mouth, moaning as he took Cas’ bottom lip with his own teeth.
Castiel watched the red wine spread across the table and dripped to the floor. His chest ached, he never fought with his father. They had always gotten along so well. His body quivered with a flood of adrenaline. He’d never raised his voice to his father before, and he’d most certainly never purposely tried to hurt him. His cheeks burned with shame at the way he used his mother as a weapon in their argument.
“Jesus, Sammy, what are you doing?” Dean glared at him, sitting down heavily on the bed and effectively on Sam’s outstretched legs.
“Wait!” Gabriel called out abruptly, causing everyone to jump. “I need a beer first. Redd's Apple please.” He motioned to the cooler behind Benny. “You mind?”
Dean suddenly flushed and he looked back down into his lap, picking nervously at his hands beneath the table. “I… uh, have been,” he mumbled and Ellen saw a look of confusion pass over Cas’ face as he turned his head to look at Dean, then back at her. “I… told Cas we were true mates after Thanksgiving.”
cemetery,” Gabriel called over his shoulder. “You know the myth! Souls roam these grounds tonight and
“Deal,” Castiel purred with a pleased smirk, his inner Omega perking up at the thought of being spoiled in such a way by his Alpha.
The Omega took it along with Sam’s Thor hammer and placed it off to the side where it wouldn’t get in his way. Gabe eyed his Loki scepter, contemplating, before he to decided to put it with the other props.
Dean ignored his brother’s question and looked back out at Ketch and Castiel. The music was like liquid adrenaline being injected into those on the dance floor as they writhed and pawed at each other. The longer he watched Castiel and Ketch the less he focused on the case, and more about what was going on between the pair, in fact, it was becoming impossible to look away.
“I don’t though,” Dean whispered surprised at the truth of that statement. Despite what the Siren had done he held no ill will towards him. “I can’t fault you for your nature. Plus you're my true mate, you’re all I’ve ever wanted. If you hadn’t called me to the sea we may never have found each other.” He gently nuzzled at the side of his Omega’s throat, sighing when Castiel’s sweet scent surrounded him. “And, you used your one wish to save me.” The Alpha placed a gentle kiss to the Siren’s pulse point. “So how could I hate you?”
Dean nodded and turned towards the stairs, taking them two at a time and almost stumbling halfway. Ellen steadied him, a strong and comforting presence behind him as he made his way to Castiel and Lucifer’s bedroom.
Ellen opened her mouth to reply when the door opened again. She looked up, expecting Bobby. Then, “Dean, you need to go back to bed.” From behind her, Castiel whined, and the green in Dean’s eyes bled away into deep red.
“Yeah, they are really fine, aren’t they?” Dean scoffed as he glanced down at the patch of blood staining the omega’s shirt before he turned and strode across the room to retrieve the first aid kit from the wooden cabinet by the bookshelves. He turned and clutched it in his hands as he continued talking while making his way back over to Castiel. “It’s been what, less than an hour, and you're already bleeding through your shirt.”
“Are you kidding me?!” Castiel yelled, raising his voice at the Alpha, the superior gender. But this time he didn’t flinch, didn’t clap his hands over his mouth, he didn’t feel guilty for feeling  rage. No, instead he channeled it and carried on. “All this time!? You knew
“Perfect, I will work on that for next week and see what I can come up with.” A louder than normal ticking sound signaled the top of the hour and Doctor Shurley looked up to the oversized clock hanging on the wall. “We’re about up for time, Castiel,” he said, looking back and meeting Cas’ eyes, “but is there anything else you wish to talk about?”
“I don’t like my heats.” Castiel shifted in his seat. “They scare me and make me feel out of control, and I don’t like that feeling.” He met Ellen’s gaze with a tight smile as his heart pounded in his chest at the thought of going to
Dean felt His Majesty's eyes boring into him as he and Cas approached the throne. As if the man wasn't imposing enough, and as if the marble and gold throne room wasn't intimidating enough, the throne was elevated on a stage seven steps up from the floor. It forced you to look up, and Dean already felt small in the vastness of the ocean. Now, he felt like an ant at the bottom of a slide.
Sam turned sideways in his seat and smirked back at Gabe. “Get all those nicknames out while you can, because after tonight you won’t be able to use them no more.”
Castiel blew out a deep breath, shifting in his seat. He was sitting in the same booth he’d sat in on their first date a year ago. It was almost seven and Dean would be here at any moment.
“And what about your Omega?” John queried sternly with a quirked brow. “He may be hungry. Are you going to deny him because you can’t control your inner Alpha?”
“I’m not laughing either,” Cas growled again as he narrowed his eyes. “Tonight was supposed to be special! I was trying to make it perfect! And you keep accusing me of joking with you!” The Omega threw up his hands, completely exasperated. “Why the fuck would I be doing this as a joke? We have wanted this for so long!” Cas sighed and shook his head, his next words coming out in a whisper, “I don’t understand, I thought you would be happy.”
“Even though father knows, I’ve worn my mother’s necklace for so long now,” Castiel ran his hand up Dean’s chest until he reached the necklace. The Omega caressed the pearl between his thumb and forefinger as he finished explaining, “I feel bare without it.”
Dean nodded, “Yeah, and when the warlock read the letter his heart broke. And his once kind soul blackened. He was in agony. I can only imagine how I’d feel, you know?” Dean glanced at Castiel who was nodding. “Anyway, the warlock was so angry that he put a curse on the ring.” Dean fingers tightened on the steering wheel, “If he couldn’t have his true love then anyone who wore his omega’s ring wouldn’t either. The curse is to break people’s hearts like his was, and leave the one wearing the ring despising their one true love.”
The Omega rolled over onto his back when he became over sensitive. “Come back to me, Alpha,” Cas whispered and watched as Dean shifted back into human form.
“Really?” Dean mock groaned from the doorway before making his way further into the room. “With how many times you two have heard that story in your nine years of life, you haven’t tired of it yet?”
Dean scanned the room, “Found ‘em.” His eyes landed on the back booth in the far right corner. There sat his omega,
“Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.” Dean stepped in between the two just as they reached their motel rooms. “Excuse me, you two shared a bed before? When did you two share a bed? All motels have rooms with doubles, you know that right?”
he hated: there was a spark, making them both gasp. Cas’ lips were soft and perfect and warm against his own and Dean felt like if he died right now, he could do so happily.
“It may not be pretty, but it’s a smooth ride.” Sam shrugged and glanced at the Impala’s tires, crouching down to get a better view. “Well, they're definitely too low to drive on but not low enough that letting it sit for a while will damage the rims. So,” he looked back to Dean, “seeing as how we don’t have time to get Baby in drivable condition before the scavenger hunt, we either take Cas’ car or we don’t go.”
“Dean, it’s…” Sam paused, turning to look at the lime green face of his alarm clock and turned back to his brother with wide eyes, “2:45 in the morning! What are you
“I wish I had something other than a shell to put in the middle.” Dean muttered as he reached up and caressed the pearl on his necklace. “Cas deserves something as breathtaking as he is.”
“I’m glad,” Castiel muttered as he leaned into the touch, fighting the urge to vomit as he continued, “I want to be good for you.”
Cas drops his hand and looks to Dean. Dean looks back and his… feelings swell. He never thought he could feel such peace just looking at stars with his best friend. His
“Thrown out. ‘Course I didn’t truly have anybody on my side until a long time after. And by then, nobody cared.”
“I have a sort of dilemma.” He hesitates. “In our last skirmish with demons, one of them managed to really ruffle my wings.”
Dean's face flames again at the idea of being completely naked with his best friend and what their next endeavor is. Cas kisses his forehead. "You are beautiful. Body and soul. I would know." If Cas thought that would calm Dean, he's sorely mistaken.
is everywhere. On every conceivable surface. Pumpkins, leaves, yellows, oranges, little Hobby Lobby signs that
“No, I don’t hate. It was just a shock. I actually kind of… like it. A lot.” He smiles at Cas, his hands resting on his shoulders, searching his blue eyes.
Dean shrugs again. “Maybe. But I did it. And I couldn’t argue that. That was the only point they cared about. It was also the nineties, man.” He laughs without humor.
“Star Wars.” Cas grasps the first thing that comes to mind. Apparently it was the right answer. Dean’s giddy response is downright adorable.
“Dean… I have something to ask of you.” Cas sounds weary and Dean isn’t fan of the tone, but he nods, giving Cas his full attention.
Dean tries not to let that burrow into his brain. But it does. He can understand the physical part just from watching Cas the past hour. Cas says it's not supposed to hurt and that the shower even felt like a massage. He can't help but muse about the mental aspect. And his traitorous mouth blurts out-
brings Dean up short. And Cas elaborates. “I’m not sure how much research you did, but it’s considered… rude to refuse an offer of wing grooming.”
Cas decides to try his luck. “What a shame. Guess this is goodbye.” He says it jokingly to keep the tone light, but Dean’s blush deepens, before he shrugs.
"The next step is straightening. As you go through, it wont take long for you notice and correct the feathers that seem crooked or out of place. This step shouldn't take long."
Dean continues roaming his hands over Cas’ wings, taking in their state and noting what he needs to do. He knows he’s going to have to wash them, their state is bad enough to demand it. As he continues, he can feel the wings shudder beneath him when he touches certain spots. He chances a glance at Cas to see him eyes closed tightly and face- straining?
But Cas just waves him over, before instructing him to sit. Dean complies, slightly uneasy. He chances a glance over to Sam, but his brother is immersed in conversation with his own artist. No help there.
“Sammy, of course.” And he cracks a real smile. It looks surprisingly good on him. “Damn kid went to law school just for me. Became a partner, visited me every chance he could, fought tooth and nail through my last appeal. But the fact is, nobody cares about a guy who openly admitted he took an officer’s life. Sam did everything he could, but I never bought into it. I made my peace long ago about what I did and why I did it.” He’d been gazing around the room as he talked, but he looked Castiel dead in the eye when he said “and I’d do it all over again.”
Over the course of the past week Dean hadn’t seen Cas as often as he assumed he would. Sure, Cas didn’t eat -he did enjoy coffee- and he wasn’t bound by normal human routines like showering and the likes, but Dean at least figured he’d come out his room a bit more often.
“Hello, Dean. Sam.” He smiles at them before placing the arm full of orange and yellow on the war room table. He leans in to peck Dean on the cheek and Dean’s face heats up. He doesn’t mind, but he’s still getting used to it. Especially in front of Sammy.
The case had only been a few hours away from the bunker so Dean decided it was best to get the conversation started sooner rather than later. He decides to bring it up in the car since Cas wouldn't be able to escape or evade the conversation. They had plenty of time to get to the bottom of this.
“I gotta say, Cas, you really came in clutch back there.” Dean shakes his head in frustration and sighs, downing the glass of whiskey. He didn’t drink it often, beer was his poison, but after today… “I’m really, kinda… mad at myself for not calling you sooner. I should have made the call as soon as the research wasn’t making sense. People were already dyin’. My fuckin’ pride just got in the way.” He shakes his hand vaguely. “So, thank you. For showin’ up. Even though you didn’t have to.”
After arranging themselves on the bed, Cas on the edge, with Dean cross-legged behind him, Cas turns his face slightly to walk him through the steps.
As it is, Dean is not in his twenties and he is thoroughly spent, Cas lying on top of him, in similar shape. It’s fucking perfect.
Cas reaches for something in the back seat and joins Dean a few moments later. It’s a blanket. The one Dean keeps in the back in case of emergency. Cas spreads the blanket out on the grass and looks to Dean, who cocks an eyebrow at him.
His tense stance obviously alerted Cas because he could feel the angel peer over at him. “Dean are you okay? Are you in a hurry?”
Cas’ smile doesn’t falter. “Of course I do. But we’re not living in medieval times any more, Dean.” And he
After everybody had showered, and had dinner, Dean found himself in the study area with Cas. Sam had fucked off to his room, presumably to FaceTime Eileen. Dean was giving Cas a run down of all the shit they’d dealt with before he’d shown up and deus ex-machina’d their asses.
"It's wing oil. It comes out when the wings have been properly groomed otherwise. It's to coat and protect them now that they're in good shape again. It's not harmful and it's the next step."
Dean’s brain stops working for a second. But then guilt sets in. “I don’t want you stay if you don’t want to.” He says resigned.
“So, your room or mine?” And Dean winces internally at how that sounds. “So that we can continue grooming, I mean.” He adds hastily.
“Okay,” Dean replied and placed the bills on the table before turning back to the Omega. “I want to kiss you so goddamn bad… Can I?”
“Don’t mention it,” Rowena smirked as Dean rose and swam towards the gates. “Oh and Dean,” she waited until he turned.
“That’ll do,” Sam replied trying to hold back an amused grin, not wanting to encourage the trickster’s antics.
The cat huffed and swatted Dean’s nose. Okay, clearly he didn’t think it was funny. Dean snorted as the cat leapt on top of his back and curled up in the small of it, kneading his shoulder with his sharp claws and making the Alpha hiss.
“Sure am!” Gomez nodded and cleared his throat. “First of all your team color is blue.” He passed Dean a blue coin about the size of a half dollar that had a jack-o-lantern etched into it. The Alpha twisted it in his hand as he continued to listen to the man’s instructions.
There was nothing he could do about being an Omega. Lucifer had argued that he would find out how to do the cleansing, and though it would be late, he would do it. But Shurley only smiled and nodded and said, “But that’s not going to be today. Let’s figure out how to get through one day at a time.”
Dean growled as he crashed their lips together, licking his way into Cas’ mouth as he threaded his fingers in his hair, tugging it slightly and drawing a needy mewl from his Omega. The Alpha pulled back when his watch beeped, smirking as Cas tried to follow his lips. “It’s six o’clock, babe.” Dean took a step back. “We gotta go meet Sam.”
“Holy shit!” Dean shrieked as he reared back. “It’s an animatronic!” He chuckled as he blew out a shuddering breath. “That actually scared me a little bit.”
“I saw them,” Dean nodded as he thought of the cookies in question. They were homemade sugar cookies, cut into the shapes of candy canes and stars. But not a single one of them resembled a star or candy cane, they looked more like misshapen blobs in Dean’s opinion. And the icing? The icing appeared gritty and lumpy. God only knows what they tasted like. He’d definitely dodged a bullet there, not that he’d tell Castiel that though. “They looked amazing. I really wish I’d gotten to try one.”
“More, God please, more Dean!” Cas groaned as the Alpha’s tongue struck his prostate. “Come on, Alpha! Mount me, claim me, make me yours.”
Dean and Castiel locked eyes, a million different feelings shared between that one look. The alpha wrapped his arm around Castiel’s shoulder and pulled him closer, giving him a coy grin that the omega returned. You could smell the happiness, excitement, optimism, and even arousal rolling off of them.
smoothing over social media (thank you, Charlie) to appeal to the customers that the rumor had indeed been false.
“What makes you say...” Dean trailed off as his attention turned back to Ketch, well, on the way Ketch’s hands slid down Castiel’s chest, the slow glide of them along the curve of Castiel’s waist until the pads of his thumbs pressed against the soft skin just inside the V of the omega’s hip bones.
Castiel sat at the desk in Lucifer and his shared room, writing in the journal Doctor Shurley had left for him during his last visit. It had been three weeks since his and Dean’s confrontation under the willow tree, and he had made it his sole mission to avoid the Alpha at all costs.
Bobby rubbed his head, despite his hat not being there, and entered his bedroom to see Ellen sitting against the headboard with her arms crossed, glaring at the door and waiting for him.
“Oh no,” Jo shook her head, “I don’t need anything.” She leaned against the door jamb as she spoke. “I just came up here to tell you guys mom would like to talk to you both downstairs before she starts dinner. Now that I have successfully delivered her message,” Jo pushed off from the door, “I’m gonna go play video games with Sam and Dean. See ya,” she called out as she flounced down the hallway.
Dean gave a small smile and stepped back, sinking down into the desk chair and waving his arm at the end of the bed. “You can sit,” he offered, letting his hands rest on his legs and looking down at his toes digging into the carpet. “I’m sorry Lucifer got involved the other night. No one should ever call you that.” Dean shrugged and glanced up, meeting Cas’ eyes as he sank down to sit on the edge of the mattress. “I’m sorry I ever did.”
“I will, I promise.” Dean murmured as he nuzzled at his mate’s throat, humming when the ripe sweet scent of Omega heat permeated his nostrils. “Smell so good, like love and mate and home,” Dean slurred, lust drunk on hormones. “So ripe and ready for me.”
“Amara! Stop!” Dean yelled, jogging forward. She whipped the toy through the air, the whistling sound of it making Dean wince. He reached down and scooped up the cat in both arms just as the plastic wand whipped across his shoulder.
Dean thought as he met Castiel’s eyes and plastered on what he hoped was a reassuring and not a I’m-freaking-the-fuck-out smile.
Sam laughed and dropped his basket beside Dean’s, turning to pull some socks off of the shelf. “Oh yeah, well Dean forgot last year and Ellen about had his head! She’d even reminded us, too, cause all of the socks and boxers we had were starting to get holes in them.”
By the time he gets back to the Impala, he’s resigned himself to just drive home. Or at least keep driving in the direction of home until they happen across another motel. He slams the door a little too roughly and winces internally, silently apologizing to Baby.
“Huh.” Dean ponders, smiling. He smirks and waves Cas over to the couch in the small living room. “Guest’s choice for movie pick.” And he plops down on the worn black leather.
Dean laughs softly, opening his eyes. “Of course, I don’t mind.” Not that he’d ever admit to it, but there was nothing he could say No to that produced the happiness decorating the bunker brought to Cas. The rest of it be damned. Cas deserved any and all types of happiness.
Dean keeps going, pulling his hands through the feathers, grazing bone, muscle, and the glands in one fell swoop.
Dean emerges from the bedroom presumably, still in a towel, wallet in hand. “Sorry about that. You got here a lot faster than the last two times.” He flashes a bashful grin and riffles through his wallet, pulling out the appropriate bills, and handing them to Cas. “You work every night?” He asks, his hand going to the back of his neck in a nervous gesture.
When he reached the desk, Sam was already there, pulling out the piece of paper that had the sun shaped symbol on it. “Yea, we’re both getting it. It’s a family thing. Dean almost snorted.
"Stop fighting then." And it's like a switch flips in Cas. He turns sharply toward to Dean and Dean nearly falls over from the sudden shift under him.
Dean clears his throat. “It’s fine, uh, it’s not that big a deal.” Dean leans in closer and takes a deep breath, trying to identify all the notes. “Kinda smells like spice. And honey.”
This all sounds like quite a case of self defense. The father had been abusive and the older bother had stepped in.
He spreads some more around and then, like a kid, proceeds to move himself around to catch the rainbow shines.
Cas smiles at him. “You don’t have to say it back. I just felt you needed to know the weight of my feelings for you. You have to know, I will never leave you, Dean. I’ll be by your side as long as you’ll have me.” He declares and Dean feels his throat dry out.
But before he can deal with putting that out in the open, Cas catches him so far off guard, he damn near chokes on his own spit. “I love you.”
“As far as I know, there is nothing you or I can do to remedy the situation.” Cas actually sounds like he doesn’t believe that. But he also says it with so much conviction Dean doesn’t know how to argue it.
Cas is on his knees on the bed, so before Dean can think too hard about it, he surges forward to wrap his hand around Cas. Cas hisses at the sudden onslaught but makes no move to pull away. Dean looks up him, telling him with his eyes his plan. He doesn't get Cas' reaction because he immediately ducks his head to lick the tip. That
The man behind the counter nodded. “Just let me draw it up real quick. Is it cool if my buddy works on one of you? It’ll go faster.”
Like most days, Cas eventually joined him in the kitchen as Dean sat down to drink his coffee and eat his breakfast. He watched carefully as Cas made his way over to the coffee maker, poured himself a cup and then loaded up on creamer and sugar like a damn psychopath. Dean almost rolled his eyes.
Dean figures getting out of the bunker would do them both some good. And since Sammy was fucking off with the she-Witch, Dean figures it’s a splendid idea to spend some time with his bestie. Maybe a change of scenery would help Cas open up to Dean about what was bothering him. Dean hopes it’s not living in the bunker that’s the problem. They decide to each spend some time looking and meet in the war room in an hour.
also seems to evaporate and just like that, they’re just two naked friends in bed together. “Uh, thanks.”
When he gets back to Dean’s apartment, it’s been a little over thirty minutes. He had gotten caught up talking to his co worker. He presses the Ring button once again.
Cas let’s out a shuddering breath but starts to move. He starts slow and shallow, his face buried in Dean’s neck, drawing in harsh breaths. But eventually he picks up pace, needing more. They both moan when he pulls all the way out only to plunge straight back in.
"Huh." He keeps going but starts to notice a dark liquid covering parts of the wings. "Uh, Cas, what is this?" And because he can't help himself he swipes some of it up on his fingers to get a feel for it.
He was getting older and he guessed getting achy after a fight just came with the territory. He tries not to let that bother him. Dean getting older while Cas remains the same as ever. He hadn't been human long enough for any real aging to occur.
Dean does. And finds that he maybe, kinda, likes it. He figures it’ll grow on him more with time. Sam joins him at the mirror. Upon closer inspection, he can tell they’re a little different. Subtle things like the swirls and Dean’s looks a little heavier inked.
“It would appear so.” Cas answers with absolutely none of the inhibitions Dean has. No panting, no sweating, no sore muscles. Cas can also just lift his hand and obliterate monsters. Dean's not bitter. Cas regards him a little more intently and without a word approaches him.
Not one to be ignored, Dean plunges both hands farther into the downy feathers and just- squeezes and rakes. Its not rough, just enough that it gets the reaction he's wanting.
Cas cuts him off with a searing kiss. “You don’t have to say it. I heard you. I feel it.” Dean doesn’t fixate on what exactly that means and relaxes into another kiss.
The contact seems to relax Cas and they stay like that for a while, just being in each other's space. Breathing each other's air.
He positions Cas with his back to the streaming water and sinks his hands back into the feathers. He runs his hands gently through, ensuring the water is soaking the black layers. The black immediately shines where the water rinses the loose dirt off.
Cas takes the money, but holds Dean’s hand in his grip and Dean feels frozen. For such gentle hands, their grip is unshakable. Cas reaches into his own pocket and produces a card, which he hands to Dean.
Cas stiffens immediately. “There is nothing you can do, Dean." He bites out. "There is nothing anybody can do, I just have to hope-"
Dean had never seen so much of Cas’ skin exposed, and all at one time. Inches of tan skin, sculpted far better than Dean’s own.
“Then you’ll have me.” He says simply. “Though I plan to keep you alive for a long life. I may be tempting fate, but you deserve the option to live a full life, hunting or retired."
Cas hummed and offered, “I’m fine, Dean. How are you?” And he said it with so much nonchalance that anybody else may have bought it. As it were, Dean was much more perceptive than people gave him credit for, especially regarding Cas. But Dean also knew he wouldn't get far, needling at the angel. Cas had his own bad temper when provoked.
“Cas,” he starts, taking a deep breath to get his bearings. “What’s been up with you lately? And don’t even think about saying ‘nothing’ because I’ve been with you the past week and it’s pretty obvious you’re uncomfortable about something. You know you can tell me if something's wrong, right? I wanna help.”
He’s hit with another wave of nausea. This was Dean’s brother. The person Dean had done everything for. And would gladly do it again. He thought of the grief this man— Sam— would have to endure for the rest of his life. Castiel couldn’t imagine living without his brother. He was his best friend. He imagines it must be the same for these two. The way Dean had spoke, and Sam’s expression said it all.
"I have no doubts you will clean them suitably-" Cas looks like he wants to say more, but he cuts himself off and Dean's pretty sure that’s all he's getting out of the angel.
Cas closes his eyes, likely in focus. He takes in a deep breath and when his eyes open back up, they hold his glowing grace. Huge, black wings, appear behind him and these are so much more compared to what Dean had previously seen.
He gestures for Dean to sit and starts applying Vaseline to the area. He’s careful about it. Despite his appearance, Cas works with a lot of care. Sure, gentle fingers spread the ointment over his chest and Dean has the crazy ass idea that he’d like to feel them other places. He knocks those thoughts back.
After rinsing the other wing and grabbing towels for he and Cas, the ache in his back is brought to his attention. Right. Standing like that must have took a toll on his muscles and joints. He ignores his aches and sets about patting the wings dry.
Though Dean has a rough idea of what needs to be done, he doesn't want to let on how much research he did. He also didn't read anything about angel baths. But Cas' wings honestly look like they could use some soap and water. He's also not sure if angel wings should even be washed. So he asks. "Should we wash them first? There's a lot of gunk in them."
When Cas adds a third finger Dean feels it burn in a good way. “Fuck.” It clouds his head farther and he’s pretty sure he starts babbling bullshit he wouldn’t otherwise say.
Dean's brain haze answers for him, more truthfully than he would have ever been. "I want you to take care of me." Cas' gaze somehow gets softer.
Castiel makes another snap decision. “I’ll escort you out.” It's protocol, after all. Sam nods and they walk in silence through the gates and doors of Wall’s unit.
Was he fucking crazy? There was no way Dean was ever going to forget the best sex he’d ever had. His brain may have been hazy but it still remembers what happened. “We were both a little caught up in the effects of…”
Cas shrugs. “Maybe. I will admit, it was a lot of work. But I think that’s because I did most of it alone.”
“That your boyfriend?” He doesn’t sound judgmental, only curious. But it makes Dean recoil, regardless.
While gathering clothes and a towel up for himself he hears the ping of his phone and sighs inwardly, guessing its Sam.
Dean wonders to himself if this is really doing something to Cas. The evidence is in front of him and the book said an angel’s wings could be something of an erogenous zone. He drops his hand to give Cas a break if that’s really the case.
“When you think that loud, I have no choice but to hear you. If I could shut it off, I would. You still haven’t responded to my suggestion.”
He watches as Cas’ hand connects with the vampire’s head and the creature screams as his eyes and mouth flash white with the smiting. It takes all of two seconds before the vamp drops to the ground.
“Once he realized it was me on top of him, something in him snapped. And then he wasn’t fightin' to disarm, he was fightin' to kill me. Because I dared attack him. Once I knew that, I knew what was gonna happen. And I knew the consequences too. But I had to do it for Sammy. Reached into his own gun satchel and… let him have it.” He says with a sort of nonchalance. And an air of finality. “Two shots right to the head.” He makes a show of finger guns which is, despite the dark and jarring conversation, is a little endearing.
Back in his room, he stuffs it under the front of the mattress  -someone would have to be looking hard to find it- and sets about to getting ready for a shower, feeling both excitement and trepidation.
As if reading his mind, Cas goes on, “Stealing my grace like Metatron did severely damaged my wings. And because my grace isn’t at full power I can’t heal them properly. But my grace may never fully replenish itself because my wings are so damaged. I believe humans have a term for the predicament I find myself in.”
“I know,” Jo agreed with a smile, “but you can learn from it. Lashing out when you’re angry is easy and the first knee-jerk reaction we all have. It's hard work to keep your cool and take a moment to calm down before saying something you’ll regret. You’ll do better next time.”
Ellen glanced at him and gave a small smile. “I am happy for them, you know.” Bobby simply placed his hand on top of the table, palm up for her to slip her hand into. “But the rules remain the same and for breaking the rules, they have to do extra chores. Dean will be responsible for laundry for the week, and Castiel for the dishes.”
“Now,” Gomez continued and picked an envelope off the table before passing it to Dean, “this holds the first clue. Do not open it before we declare the hunt has started, okay?”
“So much better, Dean,” Castiel panted as he rode his mate’s fingers. “So much better when you do it.”
Dean wrapped his hand around his cock and it throbbed in his hold. He knew that it would only take a few good strokes before he blew his load. The omega gripped himself loosely, not wanting to tip over the edge just yet.
“If you guys wanted to have a conversation with us? That would’ve been fine. If you wanted to talk as a family about it, that could’ve been fine, too. You guys always preached that we could
He snorted to himself and found himself looking over to Castiel’s house, his eyes scanning what he could see of the front and the backyard for signs of the cat. He didn’t see him, but he
Cordelia shook her head, her long raven locks swishing from side to side. As she lay down in the nest, she motioned for her father to join her. “It’s romantical, Daddy!”
A small smile spread across Dean’s lips and Cas continued, “I also have a few Cokes, a bag of doritos, and chocolate chip cookies. So…” he trailed off and bumped his hip against Dean’s.
“We’re participating in a Halloween scavenger hunt.” Sam tapped the Thor hammer against his knee as he shifted in the seat.
The Alpha snorted as his mate relaxed against him. “You know,” Dean nodded towards the cookie, “that’s my masterpiece right there.”
Dean licked his lips, squeezing his arm around Castiel’s and letting himself be pulled forward. “So…” Dean said after a moment as the black iron gates of the graveyard came into view. “Other than asking her for your bag… have you, uh, talked to Meg lately?”
“Sorry,” Cas mumbled as he placed a trail of wet open mouthed kisses along his throat, “You just looked so damn delicious.”
“Wow! Cas,” Dean whispered in awe as he glanced up at her face. “She looks just like the picture of Mary Lee I saw online.”
“Shut up,” Sam snorted as he pelted his brother with another handful of popcorn. “Watch the movie, don’t quote it.”
Hours had passed and nearly every scrap of food had been eaten. Lucifer had tried to help Ellen put away what leftovers there were and to clean up while Castiel went with Bobby on a ‘secret mission’, but she shooed him away.
“Everything looks amazing!” Cas leaned against the Alpha’s side. “You really went above and beyond.”
“Not for much longer,” Gabe declared. “I know what she looks like and I can summon and hold her here. Just tell me when you guys are ready.”
“Well,” Dean smirked as he let go of Castiel’s hand and tapped the mating mark on his mate’s neck. “Kinda thought this already meant I had you locked down, that I get to keep you forever.”
He wondered what Cas and Gabe would be like and cursed himself for not asking Sam if they had any dietary restrictions or allergies. He sighed as he contemplated texting his brother, knowing Sam was probably finishing packing and wouldn’t answer his phone until he was in the car. He could always ask him in the morning and make Sam run to the store if he had to.
“No hallway, hmmm,” Dean tightened his left arm around Castiel, as his right one felt along the wall beside him until he found the knob he was searching for. He gave it a twist and the door opened with a loud squeak that echoed down the long desolate hallway.
“Finn!” Dean sputtered as he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. Castiel chuckled loudly in return as the sea lion snorted and pressed his snout to Dean’s cheek before splashing them both as he swam out deeper into the water.
Cas turned his head to met his Alpha’s eyes. “I’m going to get fired before I’ve technically even started my new job.” At Dean confused look he continued, “I was supposed to start as the head pastry chef at
As soon as they were done eating, Dean silently took care of their mess, shaking his head when Castiel moved to help. Then, he took Castiel’s hand and pulled him into his arms. He couldn’t explain in words how he felt, how happy and complete he felt. How he was already so in love with the man in his arms. But he could do the next best thing.
Blowing out a slow breath, Dean held up the collar and slid the key into the lock, turning it before pushing open the door.
“No,” Gabriel shook his head as he watched his brother finger run over every single word, “he didn’t. He didn’t preach love and acceptance for all because he was a blind man and his heart was full of hate when it came to Omegas. But God, the God in here?” He laid his hand back on his brother’s. “He loves us all, made us the way we’re supposed to be. To him we are perfect. You and me, Cassie, and all the other Omegas? We are precious in his eyes because we were made in his image.”
The Beta smirked wickedly at his brother as he pulled back the covers on the spare bed. “That’s what you get for being a dick, Dean.”
They spent a few weeks combing the streets of London and then taking in the English countryside before crossing the channel, by boat, no less to head off to Italy.
Dean moved back and placed his hands on his hips as Castiel turned to face him. “Then why the hell did you let me eat one?!”
It was Dean’s fault, he knew that. He hoped that the pain he’d felt over the past five years had been inflicted upon him alone, that Castiel hadn’t had to suffer, too. But mostly…
.” Dean nuzzled at Castiel sweat soaked skin as he pushed in a third finger, crooked them perfectly, and began to rub the Omega’s prostate mercilessly.
Dean kissed him back softly, his hands moving to cup Castiel’s face and deepen the kiss. He groaned as Cas’ tongue moved against his bottom lip and he let his mouth fall open, letting Castiel control the kiss. As the Omega pressed closer, he was suddenly aware of how little clothing either one of them was wearing, and he hissed as he pulled back. He wasn’t sure how much control he actually possessed.
“I’m sure they will.” Castiel smiled at him as he cut up his second serving of steak. “I’ve seen how much care and hard work you put into your own lawn, so I can only imagine how much you put into others.”
Dean cleared his throat, thick with emotions before continuing where he’d left off. “Uncle Bobby was the one babysitting us that night, he’d been visiting us in Lawrence, that’s in Kansas,” Dean clarified for his mate. “Bobby was there for us through all of it, the crying, the denial, the funeral. He held our hands as the three of us said our final goodbyes to my parents, John and Mary.”
“Okay, one thing at a time though,” Dean licked his lips and folded his hands in his lap, trying to ignore just how much his inner Alpha wanted to pull Castiel in his lap and mark his pretty unmarred throat. “We will come back to the whole figuring out how it's even possible we are true mates thing after you finish telling me about this wish, and how I became a-a Merman.”
He sighed as he walked over to the couch and adjusted the Omega to a more comfortable position, scooting him down where he could lay flat. Then Dean bent down and removed Castiel’s shoes, placed a pillow beneath his head and covered him with the throw blanket that rested across the back of the couch.
“Speakers.” Dean replied as he side-eyed his mate, waiting as another round of ‘get outs’ echoed off the walls before he continued. “I’m trying to find the speakers the voices are coming from. But I can’t,” Dean clicked his tongue in mild frustration. “They have them hidden too-”
Dean chuckled as he pulled out their chairs, taking the basket from his mate and setting it in the center as Cas took his seat. He served them both generous slices of lasagna and leaned over to kiss Cas once again before sitting down.
“Different things. I for example,” Rowena reached up and trailed her fingers across the diamond choker around her, “take jewels as payment.”
Dean rolled his eyes and was thankfully saved by the pinging of Charlie’s phone. He raised an eyebrow as she dived to the side to grab it from the bench. “Ten bucks it’s your lady friend.”
Dean was frozen to the spot staring at his mate; the closer he got, the more the Alpha was drawn to his blue eyes. Sure, he’d known they were blue when he’d gotten a brief peek at them as the Omega had whizzed by on the ice, but now that he could really see them, they were
“Ours,” Castiel whispered against Dean’s lips. “I can’t wait to get to know you even better, to start our forever, Alpha.”
Castiel let out a breathy moan as Dean’s tongue tentatively ran across his bottom lip before the Alpha gently nipped it, begging for entrance. Castiel opened willingly, allowing Dean’s tongue to tangle with his. Castiel gasped again as Dean wrapped his arms around his waist and pulled him flush against his body.
An animalistic growl tore its way from Dean’s throat as he lunged forward and mounted his Omega. His cock rutted between Cas’ wet ass cheeks before catching on his rim, popping past the tight ring of muscle and sliding in in one smooth, rough thrust. Cas keened and mewled beneath him as Dean ravaged his body, the sound of skin meeting skin, grunts and groans, filling the room along with the thick scent of mating pheromones. Together, they were drunk on it, the perfect atmosphere to bring them together once more.
“Dean,” Castiel furrowed his brows at the alpha, “you call your car ‘Baby’.” Sam choked on his beer, hiding his laughter with a cough, but apparently it didn’t fool anyone because Dean shot him a glare before turning his attention back to Ketch.
They made quick work of picking up the tools and trash, and Dean offered to water the new plants while Cas ran inside to make them lunch. The few hours they spent together were hard work, but as Dean sank down in the adirondack chair by Castiel’s fire pit, a fresh glass of lemonade and his lunch in his lap, Castiel laughing freely beside him…
Castiel scrunched up his nose. “I’m not really sure what a clearance rack is, but I got my clothes over there.” He pointed over to the corner of the men’s clothing aisle. “So if those are the clearance racks, then yes, I suppose I did.”
The house is large enough to house their kids, with a large field outback and an even larger scrapyard. Family don't end in blood and the Singers prove that by filling their home with love.
“Yeah, right,” the Alpha scoffed. “Like I’m going to believe anything you say.” He sat up to get further away from the creature, but his movements were clumsy, it felt as if his legs were bound. The Alpha’s eyes trailed down his body and he let out a blood curdling scream when his gaze met his bottom half.
Dean and Castiel stayed out to the wee morning hours staring at the stars and talking. Talking about Dean’s life on land and Castiel’s in Atlantis. There’d also been more kissing, and slow sensual exploration of each other’s bodies. Castiel was well on his way to stealing second base when Dean convinced him it was time to head back home. As bad as he wanted Castiel, he didn’t want to mate him for the first time there on the beach.
The more distance they put between themselves and the entrance the more Castiel felt trepidation sink into his bones. “As some of you may know, Waverly does not have working electricity.” Lucifer paused in his steps and patted the flashlight attached to his belt. “But since this is a day tour we won’t need the flashlight until we get to the death tunnel.”
He looked up, locking eyes with Castiel as he reached between them, guiding himself to his mate’s hole and pressing slowly inside.
Whatever Lucifer was going to say was swallowed by the sound of their own door flying open, the metal handle slamming into the adjourning wall with a crash. Lucifer’s free hand twisted in the back of Castiel’s robe, pulling them together tight as a tall man -- Alpha? Though his scent was strange-- entered the room with bright, white lights shining from his chest.
