“Liar!” he hisses, “You said that I –“
“It is?”
She startles, knocking Cas’s leg off her in response. “You know about him?”
Dean, in an act of revenge for Sam’s nitpicking, abandoned him for the therapist’s office without any offer to help once they parked. Although Sam wondered if it should count, since Sam hadn’t expected Dean to go out of his way and help him, regardless of how Dean caved when it came to bringing Jack. He fleetingly considered this, but ultimately decided it didn’t matter. He needed to hurry.
“What?” Sam trailed Dean’s wake as he left for his bedroom, cornering him while he slipped into some ratty white sneakers left by his dresser. “You’re coming?”
“Hello, Dean.”
“What did you think we ate, Dean?”
“Seriously?” Dean leaned forward enough, sniffing the makeshift towel. “…Guess it’ll do.” He rubbed it through his hair, standing at full height once more. “Don’t know why you put me through all that water torture anyway…”
, exactly?” He slammed the refrigerator door, startling both of them and the baby. Jack’s wailing picked up where he left off, although sharper and more annoying. Dean pushed into Sam, instinct urging him to soothe like he did earlier. Dean stopped himself, hesitating. He spun on his heel, leaving where he came in.
“Very good. Recently, I got this essay on very topic an old friend of mine from Moscow sent, hidden inside children’s bear toy. It would honor me to read it aloud.” Pausing on the porch, he nods at Cas, “Would you care to listen? Might do good for bad vibes.”
Meg knocks him on his ass, both laughing. She grabs a shaking ankle, “Sit still!” Throws his shoe to the wayside and then peels his sock off. Cas wiggles his toes as they’re freed while Meg repeats the process on his other foot. “Can you quit it?”
Kelly smiles at him. A younger Kelly, neither a child nor the woman he knows. She stands alone in front of a lake, laughing, pulling the curtain of her hair away from her face. Staring up with those lovey-dovey goo-goo eyes that –
“That fast?” Cas asks.
Together, they completed their duties by sundown. It might have been sooner if Sam didn’t slack off to play nursemaid to Lucifer’s kid. He ran off at the slightest bit of static coming from the garish, incongruently colored baby monitor clipped onto his belt loop, dragging their duties out because of intermittent breaks. When they finally set Cas and Kelly on their respective pyres, the sky darkened to the same shade it was that they lost both of them.
Jack didn’t realize how long his monologue for Sam was and his tallest father paid for it with four strips of charcoaled bacon. Because he was under the power of Jack’s writing, Sam added it to the growing pile of food he made for himself with no hesitation. “Looks delicious.”
This story was as short as the one he wrote previously, barely managing nine hundred words. It didn’t matter, though, since he captured the wholesome comfort he wanted.
is born! Two becomes one.”
He tucks his chin against his chest, panting. “Christ,” Cas says, “I’m almost…” His orgasm quakes within, every pull from Calvin’s fist beckoning it outwards. Cas delays it with all his strength yet cannot contend when the man’s other hand rings the bell at his back door. Stunned, Cas’s orgasm rushes out and explodes in a satisfying mess, like a milky oil spill. Streaming forth, dripping onto a shirt Cas left on the floor.
of stress buried here you’re still holding onto.”
“Harris.”
“It shouldn’t be hard.”
Cas waited by his car while they say goodbye, Nick’s hands hovering at her waist before switching course and brushing her arm. Murmurs a parting message that made her giggle, rooted her in the empty space next to Nick’s car until he disappears from the lot, easily obscured by the lemon eyesore of his own car behind Nick's. Driving with him home and then here.
Which meant there must be another bathroom.
Sam visibly faltered, stooping slightly. Footing lost as the ground trembled beneath his feet. “Well… no, I mean – not, not that I can recall…” Spluttering, his hands balled tighter into fists. “But maybe it’s different, feelings for a boy and – and feelings for a girl.”
. In the middle of the long, front space, Cas learned the name of Kelly’s dashing professor. Nick Pellegrino, a member of the faculty at California’s local state university given the mailing address. Not a home address, but at least it’s
But after learning what he did, those are exactly why it makes sense. Clicking as he pulls up the driveway.
“Hobbies are about what you find interesting,” he reminds himself, “And my fathers are the most interesting people in the world…”
Thankfully Claire descends the stairs in the next moment, saving Cas from this waking nightmare.
“I stopped for gas in between,” he told her, “Bummed around at the Gas’n’Sip, bought some gum… not like I was dying to bother you again, or whatever.”
If only they knew she had no choice. Motherhood demanded it, craved such violence. It was the only aspect of that beast she understood.
Dean stared at Cas. Saw the streaks of grey that tickled his hairline, and little crusts around his eyes from sleep. Reminders of how fast things can change, and what little they have left in the tank. If Cas were an angel, he thought, they’d have more time. Can stay alive through his grace, healing even the littlest signs of age. Like Serafina did with Adam.
It’s not something he’s comfortable talking about. Castiel barely remembers what his mother was like, having hatched days after she was lain to rest. He was told he had her eyes, sometimes thinking that she’s seeing everything he does. The thought passes that maybe she’s watching him now, and he hopes she would approve of his actions.
“Do I… do I still have a soul?”

how I heard about it. Advertising… I, uh – I was walking down the street and this girl shoves this flier in my face. I start chatting her up about the group because, well… she had these big tits, see,” Cas’s hands curl around the air in front of his chest, leering at Rufus. “And no bra. Didn’t particularly remember what she talked about, only that I agreed to go where she wanted. Gave me an address and I followed. Maybe if I had paid attention I wouldn’t have actually went.”
, Dean.”
Strategically, there is no point in provoking an officer already dangling over the edge. But Dean makes Cas’s mind mushy and irrational. He listens, but not without a memorable goodbye. “Hopefully the next time you see my cock again we won’t be in an alley and you’ll be in a far better mood.” Cas winks, ignoring Dean’s roar and striding off towards his car.
“I saw him leaving the kitchen,” she says, “going… somewhere.”
piehole, Sammy!”
“Tracy!” Eve calls, clapping. Tracy faces them, hair bouncing from the spin. His next smile is more genuine, compelled naturally. It falls the more Eve speaks. “Can you please fetch me and my guest a cigarette, and a lighter? Quickly!”
“You do?” Cas’s fingers tease at his hole, searching, “It doesn’t
“I’ll take care of him.” Cas looks between the two girls, Kaia hunched over in her seat. “Kaia, was it? You and Claire can sleep on my couch for the night. I’ve got a few beach towels lying around you can use as blankets – Claire’ll know what they look like.”
Dean, chastised, sulks in his seat. Claire mirrors him, albeit she makes it less obvious. Stone-faced, unlike Dean’s immature pout.
“Oh, yes. Of course. Come in, please.”
And here Castiel had counted on winning so that Dean would have to try again.
“What?” was all he got out around a dry throat.
Impala—had probably never heard his real voice if he had used the same privacy options Castiel had. Well, okay, in Castiel’s case, he felt a bit conscious about his deep voice, so choosing a higher omega voice for his character had been the obvious solution.
Still holding on to Castiel, Dean glanced over his shoulder at him. “You can’t just piggyback on my ‘welcome back to life’ speech.”
“Ah.” Dean smirked. “That why it looks like it’s been used so much?”
Time to give that omega a bath. If that meant he’d get his hands all over Cas’ smooth, slippery skin—well, it sounded like a win-win to him.

“I don’t need a tough alpha,” Jimmy replied. “I just need
“So…” Cas took a deep breath, ready to give Dean the out he needed. “You don’t have to stick around here. Help is on the way…”
Yes, seducing Dean should be easy. For some reason, he was always very affectionate with him.
“You have healing powers,” Hannah said to Anael, apparently equally surprised by the fact that they were still alive.
He wouldn’t have thought falling asleep would be so easy, but with Dean right beside him, Sam and Benny in the other room and Balthazar’s ‘most trustworthy agents’ outside, his eyes had fallen shut as soon as his head had hit the pillow.
As if they had some sort of psychic link, Dean’s hands started softly stroking his back, over the scars that were as much a part of him as everything else he had laid bare about himself tonight.
Dean groaned. It almost looked like Cas was presenting for him. He quickly palmed his own erection and then started fingering the omega’s ass, searching for the sweet spot that made Cas cry out.
Huh. He never would have taken Jimmy for the type. Weren’t enhancers used to attract omegas? Or maybe other alphas in Jimmy’s case. Either way, Dean never would have guessed that Jimmy was self-conscious about his scent.
Whatever he had been about to say couldn’t be too bad, though, since he was still scenting rather insistently.
It was such a shame that he wouldn’t get to have another go at blue eyes.
Mortified because Dean had to turn him down, he contemplated changing doctors (and moving to a different state while he was at it). Only never seeing Dean again was not an option. He would much rather face a little bit of embarrassment if it meant he got to keep Dean in his life. If Dean still

start anything, all he would get was a chaste goodnight kiss and that was that.
Unfortunately, that was the slick he needed to coat his dick, no other slick would do. He growled at the beta to show his dissatisfaction, baring his teeth. Yeah, he probably shouldn’t have left the house like this, but his rut suppressants usually worked a lot better.
mating gland in return. Which wasn’t what this was about. Dean didn’t need to prove anything to an ex of his, after all.
“Hannah!” Castiel had been sure the evil witch and her mind control powers had gotten her. “I thought you were dead.”
“Okay, done,” Dean declared as he let his fingers glide through Castiel’s feathers one last time, smoothing them out. Castiel’s feathers did not agree, though, and immediately fluffed back up.
Alphas got through their ruts alone all the time. What could go wrong if he didn’t go out to look for an omega for his next rut?
It didn’t help that Amelia always wanted to talk about his inability to pop a knot. The doctor had said that there was nothing physically wrong with him and he should be able to knot an omega—but it just never happened. Castiel had no problem with that—he certainly didn’t feel like less of an alpha because of it—but Amelia came up with strange ideas she found online like knot massages or using additional slick… All of which just made Castiel uncomfortable.
, I liked the kissing. What kind of a question is that?”
“Anyway.” Zachariah dismissed Sam’s presence to turn to Castiel. “There have been allegations of mating fraud made against you.”
Cas’ 40
Dean had been right—Castiel

His plan was to go hide in his room, but Dean was there to intercept him the moment he walked through the front door.
Dean was easy to talk to and even though Cas usually felt uncomfortable in the presence of strangers, especially alphas, he somehow felt… comfortable. At ease.
“I thought you were joking.”
“I imagine this must be strange for an alpha. To spend an omega’s heat with him like this.” Alphas wanted to mount omegas, brutally ram their cocks deep into their assholes with abandon.
“Oh no, this isn’t a mating bite,” Castiel quickly corrected him. “This is just…” How to delicately put it? “…a normal bite,” he finished a bit lamely.
I don’t know why I’m still so nervous when posting a first chapter of a new fic, but I have no idea if this is something people are interested in.
“Find something you like?” Dean asked, an amused tone to his voice. He had one arm behind his head and the other hand was on Castiel’s head, playing with his hair.
Now in addition to the narrowed eyes, Dean got the whole head-tilt thing. “Why would we be scenting each other?”
! He might now die a happy omega.
He had been so focused on not falling in love with Dean (an endeavor he had failed in spectacularly) that he hadn’t even realized that he had put down roots here—found a place where he belonged, people he trusted.
Whatever had or had not been there was gone now, and he needed it back.
And then he had gotten all weird when Dean had told him he was planning on cuddling with Inias. Dean had assumed it was because Cas still had this idea that cuddling a cuddlibus could hurt him. But maybe there had been another reason…
Seemed like a rescue mission was in order…
“All sold out. You should be flattered. Come on, this alpha has a real hard-on for your slick, and desperate alphas are the best customers. He offered triple the price.
Maybe the fact he was still mad at Balthazar was the reason for what happened next.
it. Apart from the fact that he got to grope the alpha’s strong arms and press against him when he had Castiel cornered, it had been ages since he’d had such a fun workout. If they had activities like these at his gym, he would definitely go more often.
Inevitable. That’s what this was. This was always going to be where they ended up.
“Hey, Jim?”
“Here you go,” Gabe said, pushing yet another plaid shirt into Castiel’s arms. “See you around.”
When Dean changed positions yet again, Cas had had enough.
For a moment, everything seemed perfect. His stomach was fluttering for a whole other reason than fear—in the way it did when Dean was near, touching him.
Dean was awake already and kept brushing his thumb over Cas’ mating gland.
But then Cas pulled him into a quick hug. Their scent glands were touching, brushing against each other almost casually.
At least, since there was no talk of relocation, Dean didn’t bring the whole mating idea up again, which was good because Cas didn’t know if he could be strong and selfless enough to tell him no.
“Dean!” Cas rasped again, a desperate edge to his voice. “I need…” He trailed off as if he didn’t quite know himself. He probably didn’t.
He might have tried a séance after Balthazar’s death. It hadn’t worked, but if Balthazar wanted to talk to him now, he should be ready.
In any case, even though Dean tended to trust his nose, he had gotten back into old hunter habits and done some research, just to be sure. And yep: Cas was apparently his cupid, tasked with finding Dean’s perfect mate.
Dean couldn’t believe that he had let himself fall asleep and then sleep through the whole night in Cas’ bed.
Dean tried scenting the air some more, but now that the door was closed, the scent was gone too. The memory of the smell alone was enough to drive him crazy, though, and the alpha in him was telling him to go find that omega.
A rosy tint spread across Cas’ cheeks, and the omega started babbling, “Well, I… I don’t know. I assume it might be my heat. It’s imminent.”
The next morning when they woke up next to each other, he shooed Cas out of his bed (what even was the angel still doing here? He had his own damn bed!) and things went back to normal.
He couldn’t possibly think that Dean wasn’t into him, sense of smell or not.
Wow, touching an omega who didn’t really

it. Cas baring his neck had tugged at a long-buried yearning inside him.
against him during their scenting sessions, Dean used the position to his advantage.
He took a deep breath and started, “I think I should sleep in your room tonight.”
So, Cas had decided to test the waters. If an alpha and an omega were compatible, the alpha would like the omega’s scent—especially when they were in heat. Inviting Dean over while he was already in pre-heat had been very forward of him. A way of testing how Dean would react to his scent.
It seemed like he had to take matters into his own hands. Wriggling around some, he managed to make his shirt ride up a bit.
Dean’s voice interrupted his thoughts.
Still, the list of rules he had broken for Cas was growing constantly.
The alpha blinked at him, clearly taken by surprise.
Just in time. Dean had been overcome by the urge to take Cas into his arms, encircle him, cuddle him, make him feel safe in Dean’s embrace. This was more than a desire to scent mark. This was… something else. A longing for a deeper connection maybe.
There were a few fairies from Fairy Valley, a vampire, a couple of other witches—among them Hannah, of course—and some other creatures, all standing in a big circle around an angel statue who went by the name of ‘Anael’ and was the leader of the MCAK.
As a matter of fact, Cas had never even thought about the implications when he had agreed to extend their scentings to Dean staying the night. Dean hadn’t even done anything when he had been about to go into rut. That’s how much control Dean had over his alpha.
“Save yourself! He’s a hunter!” Castiel told her, even though an uneasy feeling was slowly creeping up his spine as he got a better look at her. Her eyes were dark and emotionless. Empty.
Maybe his magic was responsible for that or maybe it just seemed that way, but it didn’t matter anyway because slow motion or not, there was nothing Castiel could do to prevent the inevitable. Dean would see her—whether in a second or in a slowed-down second was irrelevant at this point.
Dean shoved in once more and Cas’ hole fluttered around it. His stomach coiled tightly, his muscles tightened and the tremors of a second orgasm hit him just as Dean’s cock throbbed deep inside of him and his big balls started pumping him full.
He had to admit that Cas was right—even though he already missed him when he thought about being hundreds of miles away from him.
“Dean!” Castiel said, putting his magazine away, cover down, and trying to come up with a good excuse for why there had been things floating around in his cabin. Humans didn’t make things float, did they? “You should know I usually clean by hand.”
Okay, when he said it like that… There really was just that one option.
“Oh. You
“Excuse me?”
was definitely something he should address.
Since then, he had gone back to ‘Casa Erotica’ two more times. After all, he could use the slick to enhance the experience of some alone time too, no need to wait around for his next rut.
“I can guarantee that you won’t find a better omega than me,” he told Dean, whose eyebrows went up at that, and Castiel quickly clarified, “Than I can find for you. But I can put your file to the back of the pile and give you some time to find the omega you think suits you best. Pray to me if you change your mind.”
He even got Dean to show him the infamous handmaiden outfit.
and if he told him not to tell anyone else, he wouldn’t. Plus, he didn’t have to tell Dean
‘Dean’s omega’—that sounded nice.
Castiel had tossed and turned the whole night without getting a lick of sleep. He still felt the phantom cock of that alpha in his ass whenever he moved, reminding him of the single hottest thing that had ever happened to him.
Would all his love for him just… vanish? It seemed impossible. How could he not love the way Dean cared about things? The way he laughed so goofily, the way he was always there for… everyone, helping others because that’s who he was—the most selfless human being he knew.
There was no way for Cas to explain this one away, and in a way, he had knowingly taken that risk the second he had encouraged the scenting.
“Jim? You listening?” Dean brought him out of his thoughts.
Wait—Dean wanted to
Dean could almost hear the frown.
Even though Cas was out of heat now, Dean couldn’t hold back from touching him and kissing him, so that was basically what they were doing the last day as a way to transition back to real life.
“Yes, please,” he replied with a sigh, relieved that the embarrassment was about to end. Dean would probably get a towel or—whoa! Dean’s hands found their way underneath the sheet and he started massaging his globes before reaching his crack and gently tickling his hole as his oiled fingers slid past it almost by accident.
Dean’s favorite part of the day was, naturally, when they climbed into bed together and made each other feel good by scenting and nibbling on each other’s scent glands.
This alpha had been the best lay he’d ever had and now Dean wasn’t getting to mount him ever again? It really sucked that once they were dressed again, they had this awkward moment where they didn’t really know how to say goodbye.
Cas isn’t assured. He steps over the obvious rebuttal, going easy on him after yesterday. “You plan on coming out any time soon?”
His brain hurts, and Cas’s mouth desperately misses the sweet taste of grass. He searches his breast pocket and only finds his lighter. Cas faces the pushpins on his mental corkboard alone.
was worth it.”
“I must say, before we begin, I didn’t think there was still any interest in my husband,” she says, “There wasn’t much that was said about him after he was… displaced from his company, and the circles I ran in stopped mentioning him altogether – at least when I was in their presence.”
He grins, wobbling on his heels. Dangerously drifting close to Dean and enjoying the flush of his cheeks. “Maybe I decided to make an honest living?”
“Clearly.” Blue Eyes chuckles, and Dean – not sure for what reason – joins him. He can’t hear much of it, but the bits of his laughter that break over the bar’s chaotic din make Dean giddy. “Thank you,” he nods at his tequila, “for the drink.”
Dean whines, sitting up by resting on his elbows. “Why’d you do that –“
“Yeah, that’s me okay?” Nick struggles fitfully in Cas’s leg lock, kicking lazily. “But like I said, I don’t remember her. All the faces blur after some time.” A believable defense if Cas’s bullshit detector weren’t wildly ticking into extreme territories.
“And you look…

Dean snorted, finally rejoining the conversation, “Maybe he tried doing what we did and played your heartstrings like a fiddle.”
“And you think I woke up with pink nails on my own? You’ve been waiting to get me back for –“
Copper explodes across his taste buds, hidden by pursed lips.
“Sounds like you’ll have your hands full.”
He abandoned the front, hopping down each step one by one. Considered the scenario before him. To a casual observer, the building was empty. Cas knew it presented as a lie. Why that was, Cas can string together a few guesses from past experiences. The only theory that won’t curdle his stomach is that the operation running within wanted little interference.
Rufus chuckles, wiping at his mouth. “Definitely not.” Throwing down his nub, he makes an identical smear inches from the first one. “I gotta get out of here,” he says, “got a whole day filled with shit to do, can’t ignore everything because your motherfucking white ass can’t shut itself up.” He hurries towards the exit, Cas watching until the daylight on the steps fade and the door slams shut.
Mia bit her tongue, protest visible in her eyes. Buddy readied another blow, but stopped midway when Jack interrupted with a healthy cry. “Well fuck,” he said, as if noticing Jack for the first time, “you’ve done and woke up the baby… happy?”
Claire sighs, stretching out in his backseat. “Rules. Like, how I’m only supposed to go to the lecture and

on Earth… with you.” His hand moves, cupping Dean’s cheek. Thumb brushes his lip. “And when our time comes, I’ll rejoin Heaven at your side.”
Adam reacts violently, nicking Dean’s hip hard enough he expects blood. But his thumb soothes the spot, caresses it far more lovingly than Dean thinks is appropriate. He doesn’t voice his concerns. Busy thinking about the sudden callouses he feels on Adam’s thumb.
“About three or four months,” he tells her. “She shacked up with this biker dude she met and they’ve been cruising open roads since. Last I heard they were tearing streets way north of here, in Portland.” Cas closes the bathroom door, hiding the still full bathtub and clothesline of hanging pictures. He sits at his desk, flinging the newspaper down and picking up one of the joints. The woman hadn’t moved since they walked in. “You can come closer,” he says, “take a seat… do you mind if I light up?”

The smaller agent blusters, wiping at the sweat dripping across his forehead with a tiny rag. His and his friend’s bodies boiling, no doubt because of the arbitrary dress code enforced by strait-laced squares. “Um, okay, Cas –“
me?” Dean whips around, eyes wide in condemnation for raising his voice. Causing a scene. Drawing attention to them.
Castiel smiles as he agrees with him. “You’re an extraordinary being, Dean. I’m… I’m glad to have gotten the chance to know you as well. Even if the… the circumstances are unfortunate.” The guilt bubbles up inside him, and he quashes it there. So many other emotions are churning inside, he can’t spend time dealing with one he already knows the name of.
“Nasty habit,” he giggles, “Though the results speak for themselves. I mean – you know how easy it was smooth-talking little Sammy when I looked like his ol’
“Jimmy,” he says, “Although you already knew that…”
“Dean,” Not-Cas says, “hey, uh… Dean?” He turns, Castiel’s lips adorning his jaw with favor, and finds Sam on his other side. Watching. Aware of what he interrupted, given his pained smile and squinted gaze trapped elsewhere. “Sorry, but I’m…” he clears his throat, “I’m kinda ready to leave, if you… you are?”
“Not how I expected, though,” Dean says, “with how talented he was practicing law, you’d think he would be better staying out of trouble.”

He exits the van; choosing Sergei rather than an interrogative Andy, knowing the former will help quell the latter. “Sergei,” he shouts on his approach, Andy at his heels by the sound of his footfalls, “how’s your inventory?” They hop a rusted steel barrier separating parking from the beach, closing in on their dealer.

Cas’s lips curve genuinely. “I thought the same thing.”
“Whoa,” Claire studies the scene, worry reflecting off the rearview mirror, “what the hell happened –“
Jack glances down at where Dean let his shoes lie, finding the others’ there as well. The scene strikingly resembles something Jack saw once before, but he knows that at no point did the Winchesters get to have this. They talked about it near constantly, in a way that Jack assumed they would never follow through on. Except now they have.
…” Dean’s breath tickles his neck, mouth resting there. Weak from the drug’s effect, he cannot control complex functions like keeping his head raised or walking in a straight line. “Cas, you can’t never say I have the stick in my ass anymore,” he says, “I was having
Finally, he bats Cas off him, “No, then I’ll never get to the point.” Pouting, Dean carefully avoids his eyes as he shrugs. “Thoughts get pretty muddled after reefer… all that comes out of my mouth is nonsense.”
“Like I said. We’re on our own frequency. No problems here.”
“Too bad, Dean,” Sam said, “that’s probably the universally accepted meaning for it.”
He had an old shirt, which Cas tossed Dean’s way. “Best I can do.”

Eve sighs, leaning away from him. “No. Well, I mean…” She taps her fingers against her lips, mouth open anticipating a cigarette that wasn’t there. “Possibly.

When I called the company, they said he requested that the checks be sent elsewhere. Maybe to the Institute, maybe to wherever he was staying but… they should know.” Cas hears wet slaps across stone, Cole walking over. He lays a hand on Eve’s and whispers, gaze never straying from Cas. “I’m sorry,” Eve starts, grimacing, “it’s getting rather late. Tonight

Dean groaned, climbing to his feet. He swayed with the breeze, a lone willow in this blacktop clearing. Some of the blood from his knuckles drippled like morning dew would off its leaves. He advanced, the teen tensing as he moves closer. Their shoulders brushed, the younger of the two stumbling back a few inches, cowering in Dean’s presence. Dean thought he should say something, let him know there’s nothing to be afraid of.

Feast concluded, Jack reclines onto the soft blanket. Stomach too full for even his grace to fix. He closes his eyes, relishing in the soft sunlight dappling his skin. Sleep, like food, isn't a necessity for him anymore since absorbing Michael’s grace. From the excitement of having his powers returned to the worry about his family, to what it meant, and then the discovery of his new hobby, he hadn’t even attempted to feign unconsciousness. Now seems the perfect time - away from everything besides what was
“Because I’ve known the kid all m’life, Cas. He’s a shit liar… at least to me he is.” Dean settles against the bar, past resurfacing. A clear memory from their younger years. Sam never finishing his dinners, but somehow dropping a clean plate into the trashcan every time. Followed by a question, like clockwork, about taking a walk. “Around the motel,” he said, “nothing further.” His father’s rules. Never plainly set, but strictly enforced. Dean learned of them the hard way. Sam agreed, not even fighting like he usually did. Maybe that’s why, one night, he left their motel a beat after Sam. Dean kept close tabs on his brother. Not stopping him as he disobeyed orders and crossed the street, nor when a crowd of adults poured out of some ritzy venue, stares scathing as he passed. He maintained distance, only toeing nearer as Sam slowed for a better view of the alleyway he paused at, of a three-legged dog hobbling out of a cardboard box, tongue lolling, tail wagging. Sam greeted him in similar fashion, kneeling at the edge where light and shadows gathered. He pet and pet and pet this stray, stopping only to reveal the portion of dinner he hadn’t eaten wrapped in several paper towels. Dean scurried off in the direction of the motel, asking Sam how his walk was once he returned. He relates all this to Castiel. “Sam loved dogs. Always wanted one assa pet…” If this was his chance, Dean figured he might help. Became more lenient. Gave Sam food from his plate, not that he ever noticed. Lied to John during those rare moments he was home.  “Most of the things he got away with were only because I
“Stop it,” Sam warned, “Don’t you dare go near him.”
First thing he notices is a red beehive that reminds Cas of a volcano. Trailing his gaze downwards, he finds a pale, painted face under the explosion of hair, cheeks and lips an unnatural shade. Cas recognizes her immediately as the woman in the picture with Dean on his desk. Checking her ring finger, he sees the engagement ring. Although the stone wasn’t facing up, probably for the same reason she kept a death grip on Dean’s arm and had her purse bulging from underneath her shawl.
Castiel colors. “Again, I apologize for the deceptions,” he says, “Is there any way I can get you to forgive me?”
changed. The ever-present storm clouds disappeared, leaving his brother with a sunnier disposition. His wardrobe was different, too. Looser fitting, softer fabrics in bright colors. He wore a certain sandal Sam remembers hearing Dean label ‘the most basic hippie accessory’. What disturbed him most, however, was his hair.
“Hey, I’m the one thankin’ here buddy,” Dean says, “I don’t know what I’d’ve done if you hadn’t stepp-epped in when you did. Probably somethin’ punchy.”
about what happens to him.”
“Then his fall from grace? It wasn’t driven by sadness or… some other thing?”
smoking grass turns you into a criminal –“
“Oh, screw it,” Cas sighs. He jumps up from the bed, Calvin faltering on his dismount. Before he can say anything, though, Cas pushes him onto his back. Then Cas drops into a crawl, hovering over Calvin’s rock-hard dick. “Buckle up, baby,” he says, swallowing the entire length in one breath.
Not this time.
“Although Dean might be feeling left out,” he realizes, “One story about Sam… one about Cas… I should write one for him, too.”
Cas digs. “Would this be considered your break for the day?”

Castiel pouts. “How is this worse?”
Dean tunes Adam out like he did the music, drowning his voice in the waves of his mind. Lets it sink deep below while Dean splashes around shallower waters. Like how this trip was planned.
Cas squinted. A queasy feeling in his stomach shook about, unsure about her vibes. “I thought I looked like a friend of yours.”
Dean blushed, a pretty sight that soothed the wrinkles on Cas’s forehead. “Sorry, I… I overstepped, didn’t I? Get a little tongue-tied around…” He clears his throat, dimples popping into view. “Your attitude reminded me of me. Well, when I was younger, I had problems with authority. But they can be pretty helpful, especially when you’re on the inside.” Cryptic then, but Cas brushed the strangeness aside instead cataloguing the way Dean’s plush lips stretched while talking.
After posting his first work Jack spent the next few hours refreshing his page, watching the number of kudos to see them grow. By the time Castiel came to check in on him he had five of them - two from people with accounts and three guests.
“Fine!” Dean yells, reaching for Cas. Grabs both his wrists in a tight vice. “You want to know what

Dean’s waited all he can.
A faceless cadet scoffs, “Why not try dropping dead, freak.”
“Really?” Dean focuses on his hands, twiddling thumbs across his stomach. “Huh…” He seems uncomfortable, which worries Castiel as it goes against previous statements.
Dean nodded. He pulled his hand out his pocket – she hadn’t noticed it disappeared – and revealed a photograph. It was old. It was bent every which way. It was given to her with trembling hands. “If you don’t mind?”
Dean grinned, his features stretching like saran wrap to barely conceal his frustration. “Can’t believe you bought all that crap, doc,” he laughed, “Sam and I were stringing you along. None of what he said was true.”
This time, as Dean brightly flushes, he makes no move of distancing himself from Cas. “You don’t mean that,” he mumbles, “I’m just another lousy cop.”

Hope you enjoyed! And yes, this entire fic will be told through alternating POVs. Dean and Cas will have the most chapters dedicated to their POV, with Mary and Sam following, and then one-offs based off of certain characters. When I had the idea for this s13 rewrite, I had just finished the Prophets by Robert Jones, Jr. and was really inspired by the way he wrote the story. Definitely recommend the read.
Quite some time later he’s roused from his wakeful rest by Dean. “Hey,” Dean starts, “did you fall asleep?”
for my tastes. I mean, how can you ‘consciously repair a human soul anyway’?”
Dean turns, Adam’s apple bobbing. “That isn’t me. I… he never was.” An intimate confession whispered into ancient brickwork. Meaningful for a different crowd. Except Lucifer shows little care, sarcastic clapping shattering Dean’s moment.
Mia led them into the next room, leaving behind the non-descript lobby furniture and peeling yellow wallpaper for a cozier space. Sam scanned the area, noting pictures and degrees hanging on rogue-painted walls alongside other knick-knacks cluttering the space. Other than the door they entered from, the only exits Sam saw were twin windows covered by heavy drapes on either side of a dark fireplace and an unmarked door to the side. He made sure to stay wary of that door, in case uninvited guests might stroll in.

Cas removes another picture, more faded and wrinkled from being without the protection given by a frame. He drags a finger across the black-and-white scene, sweeping over each face captured. Of a mother with a loving, proud smile. A small baby in her arms gazing up at her. And a slightly older boy clinging to his mother’s leg, hiding, scared of the camera.
“Tell me where you intend to go,” Castiel tells him, “And I’ll guide you there safely.”
Not deterred, Jack figured that if he couldn’t have what he wanted he would give it to himself through the written word. A story where his family hops into the Impala and drives. Spending the day together because family trumped whatever errands needed running or chores piling up. Although halfway through writing it he realizes the story can’t end with them still in the car. The next logical step would involve them stopping at a destination. If only he had a globe he could spin, or a map of the United States to toss a dart at. Dean would ground him if he noticed a dent in the giant map in the Bunker's main room. So Jack relies on all he learned so far.
He couldn’t continue driving like this.
Except, in his reflection, Cas feels rough edges digging into his palm. He eases the pressure of his grip and remembers his pockets were not empty like usual. Thinking about the flyer reminds Cas of why he traveled so far, of a worried Kelly, and a Jack that slipped past without knowing about it.
Jack nods, standing. “Okay… thank you, Castiel, for the advice.”
“Cups?” Cas asks, closing the cupboard with the back of his hand. “Why are you looking for cups? There’s a stack over by…” He trails off, the girl drifting away in the middle of his sentence. “Unbelievable,” he scoffs, “no wonder our image is down. Forget Manson…” Cas slides the plate into the sink, abandoning this kitchen for elsewhere.
He steps around the mess, grabbing her third victim before she could attack. “Hey,” he says, “what are you doing? People could get hurt!”
“Not exactly,” he says, “I didn’t have the first clue where he was. Never got the name of his college, and by the time I actually
He gives up with a tired grunt, jaw aching and sore. Cas switches tactics, instead pressing kisses up her stomach while stroking his leaky cock. Nuzzles at the space between her breasts. Sucks a loving bruise onto Meg’s skin and fully inserts himself inside. “Gah!” Immediately, her walls seize Cas’s cock; muscles rocking like squeezing the last bit of toothpaste out of the pouch.
“Who from?”
Cas reaches out, freezing when a delayed thought hits the brakes telling him that might not be the best course of action. “I’m sorry,” he says instead, “but… what he did, that wasn’t your fault.”
“No,” Cas says, opening the passenger door, “it’s – better you don’t know. I’ll talk to her. You… keep doing what you were doing.”
“How I wish that were true, Castiel. How I

“Yeah, I don’t care,” she interrupts, reading her magazine again. “All we do here is provide information for students and parents
“Yes, I do.” She sits across from him on the edge of the chair, legs folded tight. Lips pinched tight in judgment while glaring at the blackened sludge fossilized in a forgotten coffee mug.

one.”
“Very well, then,” Castiel says, “We should carry on.” He nearly leaves until he sees Dean remains frozen where he is. “Dean?”
Dean felt Sam’s stare on his profile once more, an uncomfortable heat much different than what radiated from the cremating bodies before them. He hated it, being gawked at like some zoo animal. Yet Dean refused to turn, to bark at Sam that this momentary lapse meant
“What’s that?”
The engine roared, overpowering the blood rushing past his ears. Dean demolished the speed limit easily, bulleting across the asphalt, pedal his trigger. It’s early enough he needn’t worry about highway patrolmen or wayward pedestrians. He drove fast, loose, and recklessly. Fuck Vin Diesel, Dean thought. Vin had nothing on
“Well I suppose after that scare.” He looked at the angel. “You’re a sap you know that? Oh hail Mary.”
Sacha and Dean climb into the second car that is a plain Ford pickup. They went to the building Cas had said the locals had seen the men leaving on a regular basis. When they first pulled up it didn’t look like anything, not even a possible nest, but he will behave and be patient.
“You are so annoying in the morning.” He got up and did as told, went back to his room.
Again any mistakes are my own as it isn't betaed. Also I'm British so when I says pants I mean the ones under your trousers/jeans.
“To get back into Heaven where your angel lover is. I know all about your love for Uriel. Shame they are a purist.” Bee sternly replied. “Once you have fallen, there is no way back.”
to go watch it in case anyone questioned their loyalty to the franchise.’
“As you have heard from the key witness, Hastur was planning on betraying us for those heathens. My prince, is there anything else you need to hear?” The demon asked.
“You even think about it, I will kill you.” Dean threatened.
“I don’t understand, why would vampires sparkle?” Jack asked, confused.
As Dean was leaving Sam entered the kitchen and got a glass of water. He looked at Cian, who was still loudly crunching his cereal.
“We have always known about him and Aziraphale, ever since the garden, so don’t bring them into it. He also didn’t plan on stealing something for said angel, they are in love and have been for about six thousand years. That is
“They always do this. If I throw the towel in it gives ‘em the win, they know I have a short fuse sometimes. Gets me mad …. HA! All that farting about for nothing, dickhead. Still won in one move with your Snorlax. Nob. What you get when you giantamax your Poké too early.” She pressed a few more buttons and then turned the game off. “Blocked you dick, piss take.” She looked at Dean. “What?”
“Think the guys Cas spoke to were actually being used by the vamps to spy on us?” Sacha asked looking up from her yellow Nintendo Switch for a moment before going back to her Pokémon battle with an online friend.
“Oh I see… I think.” He looked at Sacha then at Dean. “Is that normal?”
“Yeah, yeah. Poor Baby getting my hair on her seats.” She snapped back.
Hello again! Thanks for reading, I really appreciate it. Hope you enjoy the next chapter, again if you see any mistakes they are my own.
He made the choice to knock on his sister’s door, not knowing how she would react. Most mornings she was unpredictable when they tried to wake her up. Apparently she needed her beauty sleep.
Crowley knew what Bee was on about, it was something only he knew about the prince. They were in love with an angel also, but this angel loved them back, Gabriel. Crowley only knew because, like the incident with Hastur, he was in the wrong place at the right time. He saw the angel and demon kissing. Then he had to run as the angel had seen him. The next time he saw Bee he didn’t say anything until they brought it up, which they didn’t, and hasn’t since.
“Well why not have me~” Sacha started before Dean interjected.
Sacha crooned Jack and kissed him a few times, he also showed affection back. She was leaning into his side, while his arm was around her shoulder. They were kissing and touching the whole time they were there.
“Morning my dear, care for a cup of tea?” He beamed when the demon came in full view.
He felt warm and fuzzy while watching the dawn break for a new day, all while cuddling the love of his life.
Once they had finished their drinks Aziraphale got ready to open the book shop while Crowley had a shower to get clean.
Crowley got to Hell and went straight to the courtroom, they were all there waiting for him. He went and stood next to Beelzebub, bowing his head on his way past.
The last time being Aziraphale tried to get Crowley’s body unwrapped from his own so he could make a cup of tea and get a book. It didn’t go quite to plan and they both ended up on the bedroom floor. Crowley was grumpy for the rest of the day. More grumpier than normal.
Aziraphale just sipped his tea, behind the cup he made a little grin. He knew that Crowley would eventually give in. He just loved how he could get his way with being sappy. He didn’t do it often but only when he wanted to stop Crowley teasing him.
Sacha threw a pocket knife into his leg, just below his groin.
He bumped into the fella at the back and looked at him. “Sorry dude. Didn’t mean to ram you like tha’ …. Just looking for the toilet ….. Was told it was this way.” He slurred some of his words for the effect.
He got out of bed after he relieved himself. He made his way to the kitchen to make coffee so he could function. On his way there he passed Sam’s room.
He was shocked when the guy growled at him with his vampire fangs out. “Be more careful next time you wonder around. Next time I won’t be so nice.” He shoved Cian back.
“I was thinking about having lunch out today. What do you think?”
“There may be a grumpy Brit in there.” She teased knowing they’ve currently got three grump Brits in the dungeons. “But then again it may not be anywhere near them at all. Who knows Dean. Who knows?” She smirked, this was payback for the interruption.
“We?” Sam asked.
“Oh it could be like Twilight with vegetarian vamps that glow in the sun.” Cian laughed out, which earned him a thump from his twin.
“Get him.” Sacha ordered.
He kept going and passed his sister’s room and the door was shut.
I am so sorry about the MIA for 3 months! Work has been a killer BUT now that covid has calmed down I can get back to posting my regular times. The next update will be 28th and every week after that. Just one more hectic week and then back to normal shifts thank god.
With this outbreak and work being crazy I can't guarantee when I can post the next chapter or even get to my writing. I really hope you understand.
He got to the kitchen and got his favourite machine in the bunker working, giving off the best smell in the world. Brewing coffee.
I am SOO sorry about the 4 week delay. I think it's 4 weeks, all my days have rolled into one. Since the Covid-19 outbreak has reached the UK I have had to pick up a lot more shifts as it has been manic at work, and still is.
“You know what, yeah we shall. I’m actually wanting to watch them. I’ll strap my brothers in for the ride too.” She smirked at her two older brothers.
It had been a few days since their outing with Adam, well Prince Adam as he now was, and Crowley was starting to plan their next trip out. He either wanted to take him to an adventure play area OR to one if the ancient castles in the countryside. The second idea required a weekend stay over in a hotel though, so special permission from his dad.
“Don’t you even think about lying to me Aziraphale. What did the asshole want?” He hated Gabriel more than anything, even more than Beelzebub.
The night before Crowley had insisted on showing him the Star Wars movies from 1977 onward, he skipped the newer ones as they were ‘just movies for the sake of money. Nobody enjoyed them, they felt the
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
About 40 minutes into their search Cas walks into the bunker. He held in his hand a bag of vegetables that Sam asked him to collect once he was done doing whatever it was he was doing.
“Tell the court what you saw, Crowley.” Bee commanded.
The idea came to him.
After he was in a world of his own, the sun started to rise. The warm colours of yellow, reds, and shades of pink. The birds started to sing their morning song. He performed a little miracle to open the curtains so he could watch the spectacle and listen to the bird’s glorious song.
“You get anything?” Cian asked as his twin made her way to Jack to hug, kiss him on the cheek and check him over.
“You have no proof that is what happened!” Hastur shouted in defence.
Cian and Jack were in the pub just 15 minutes from where Sacha and Dean were parked. It was called Missing Leg. Jack questioned the name but Cian just said the landlord picks the names for their pubs.
“That sounds like fun Dean.” Sacha teased sticking her tongue out at Dean.
Dean woke up at 9:23am, that was late for him, and as always Cas was missing from the bed. As soon as he saw the sun is out he gets out of bed. He didn’t mind as it let him sleep alone without Cas watching him.
ANYWAY I hope you guys have had a good year and thank you for sticking with my story! I wish you a Happy Christmas and New Year and hopefully the new year will let me get this story back to maybe once every fortnight. We will see!
Cian, Sacha and Sam were looking through the papers and internet for a case. Dean was in the garage tuning up Baby blasting out all his cassettes. No matter how many times the twins try and get him to get an iPod he still loves the cassettes better.
“Do you want to tell your side Hastur?” They asked.
“I shall put these in the kitchen, then I will brief you on a case I think I may have got us while I was getting these ‘veggies’” He announced before heading to the kitchen.
“So those locals were right but the reason they see only two is because the other six sneak out the side. They use dairy cans to carry the blood back to the nest. The ones coming out of the side look like newly turned vamps, which I guess is good for us. Wonder if the Alpha has found out yet?” She shrugged her shoulders. “You guys get anything?”
That always bothered him how his sister preferred tea to coffee but he loved her nonetheless.
“New trousers, do you mind?”
“So you do live, is there anything you can’t do? If the taller ones weren’t enough trouble, I now have to deal with you twins being invincible.” Crowley said so matter of factly. “What do you want, Moose?”
He knocked again, this time there was a loud thud. He wasn't sure what was going on and he didn't know if he should open her door. After a few minutes he opened the door to see that she had fallen out of but drifted off to sleep again.
different.” They sharply told him.
“I think you need a new jacket.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sacha what the hell are you on about?” Sam curiously asked, but also doesn’t want to know.
Sacha licked Dean’s hand.
“Yes but that doesn’t explain your stench Hastur, or the love you feel for that angel.” Bee told him.
“No maybe Cian is right, about the veggie vamps not sparkling. It is possible for a vampire to survive on animal blood. The Men of Letters did an experiment with it, the down side was that they had to feed more often than they did when consuming human blood.” Sam stood up and went to the book shelf and got the book he needed. He opened it up and flicked through a few pages and stopped at the one with the experiment. “See, it took a few weeks for their bodies to adjust to the different food source and drank 3 animals a day until their body was acclimatised to the new source of food. Maybe these vamps are from this experiment.” Sam said with confidence.
“Everyone else okay with that? Any questions?” Sacha asked the room.
The twins finished their drinks too then they were all heading to the cars. Cian drove back in the Ford while Dean got behind the wheel of his beloved Baby. Dean sadly got the love birds.
bigger than them. Could you get any info to see if the status quo has changed?” Sam asked.
“Well it was about three weeks ago when Dean had~”Dean ran round the table and covered her mouth with his hand.
“You think we should get Crowley in on the action?” Cian asked shyly.
“Are you ready, my love?” Crowley cheerily asked.
“You have a weird yet wild imagination Sa. But I’ll give it to you, I was on the same lines. Guess we will have to be patient.” He said shaking his as she was playing her game.
Really sorry about the massive delay.... I slept most of my annual leave away. Ops. BUT I've managed to write in the time I get between shifts while doing chores.
Aziraphale looked at him with a scole. “Now you see here, I will do no such thing. I only desire your company. What is odd about that? It was only a week ago we stopped Adam from trying to sneak off on his adventure with dog to Australia in a homemade go-kart.”
Did alphasexual alphas still want or need omegas while in rut? If biology told them to breed omegas, maybe they had to give in to instincts even if they weren’t attracted to their secondary gender. Was that a thing?
You didn’t knock on an alpha’s door when you were in heat! At least not if you didn’t want to end up knotted on the floor with multiple loads of spunk in your ass—everyone knew that!
After a moment of silent starting, Jimmy said, “Your life is here.”
Jimmy stopped short when his eyes landed on the assortment of breakfast foods on the table.
“Seems like I neglected my alpha’s biological needs.”
Zachariah was sitting in his high back leather chair, his hands folded on the burgundy tabletop of his huge desk. Intimidating seemed to be his default setting. He wanted people to know at first glance that he was the head alpha here, before they even had a chance to pick up on his pungent scent of spoiled milk and cheese that was past its expiration date.
“Okay, before you say anything, let me just tell you what I found out,” he said while pulling Castiel along towards
He tried his best to make a good impression, but a wink here and a teasingly raised eyebrow there had him stumbling his way through his own name (three syllables were way too many when confronted with the nicest-smelling alpha in the world).
Not that Dean minded. In fact, if Cas was scenting him so thoroughly, he figured he was allowed a quick whiff himself, so he sought out the omega’s scent gland in return and breathed in the awesome scent.
At first, Dean didn’t catch everything—was that their address he was rattling off?—and a look at the alarm clock told him that it was 2:38.
with affection.
Completely unaware of the unspoken invitation, Cas continued scenting.
“What is it about then?”
“I don’t think I approve of your tone,” Gabe said.
‘Amazing’ didn’t begin to cover it—his alpha was friggen
Since Dean had created an alpha as a character for himself (naturally), that meant he’d had to find an omega to help him out.
“And hello to you, too.”
“I can’t find a comfortable position.” Mostly because every time he found himself drifting closer to Dean, he had to roll back over and away from him. He knew of a comfortable position, but he doubted Dean would be thrilled if he suddenly had a handful of omega snuggled up against him.
In the end, he went for an old classic because he knew Dean appreciated those. He made Anna trip and fall right into Dean’s arms in the middle of the cereal aisle so that the alpha had to steady her, which made her apologize with an embarrassed laugh. Dean told her not to worry about it, turning on that charming smile of his that always used to make Castiel’s heart do funny things inside his chest.
So, Dean tried to cheer him up. “Lookin’ cute,” he said, only half teasing. After all, the pup bump
When he did, Dean quickly started his apology, “Maybe it’s the right signals. You ever think of that?”
“Not quite what I’m talking about.”
It had been Cas’ idea to get mated outside of his heat because while in heat, they might both feel the raw
Or maybe it was.
Still, this last rut had been especially cruel—he had thought he’d rub his dick raw, no matter how much lube he’d used, and afterwards, it hadn’t made that much of a difference anyway, his dick had still been hard as a rock.
But Gabriel’s divorce rate was at least ten times as high as Castiel’s, so it seemed like his ‘accountant way’ worked out just fine.
That had clearly been the scent of an omega! He hadn’t seen anyone come in or out of the house, but it wasn’t like he had kept tabs on it. Maybe someone had come by while he had been out last night. Maybe he had still been there, in Jimmy’s bedroom, when Jimmy and Dean had had their… weird thing. Somehow, that thought didn’t sit all too well with Dean.
What?! Hadn’t Sam said something about how it would take
Uriel was right—Dean really
Now, though, he had gotten to know and like Cas. This wasn’t about fake mating some hot omega—this was about getting close and personal with
“Wait—you’re serious?!”
That’s why Dean’s resolve not to flirt with Cas too much wasn’t going so well. But since Cas was completely oblivious, he figured that was okay. After all, Cas wouldn’t pick up on the fact that someone was flirting with him if that someone performed a naked mating dance for him.
Just then, Hannah’s head shot up and she got a faraway look as if she could see through the ceiling.
“He’s told me about that. How you survive on such a
“Dean?” Castiel repeats, worried. He nearly calls for him a third time when Dean begins swimming down further into the depths of the ocean. Zooming into it, Castiel waits a beat before swimming after him.
ending.”
He frowns, leaning on his knees. “I’m sorry, what does this have to do with –“
He crosses the street, and so does Cas – albeit on the other side. Watches him while barreling through pedestrians going the other way as if he were a salmon swimming upstream. Cas ignores disgruntled men and women while keeping an eye on the other man. Studies the careful way his hat protects from getting a good look at his face, and the stiff gait he walks with. Like he traversed through rotted sewers instead of a regular Los Angeles city street. Whoever Cas followed did not seem accustomed to the usual blindness that struck after facing the same oddness day-after-day. He nearly runs over a man lazing near a hydrant, Cas thankful that the angle showcases the cleanness of his jaw and its heavy scowl he presents threateningly at his obstacle.
“I don’t use soap.”
“Stupid hippies,” he growls under breath, digging into his pockets for a brief moment. He takes his banana and hurls a quarter at Cas, it bounces off his chest and onto the ground. “Why don’t you get a haircut?”
“If they don’t fit the profile they’re shuffled along, and not my problem anymore,” Dean says, jumping up as well. Teeth bared defensively. “Look, things fall through the cracks. I knew that without having to join the fuckin’ unit. I’m only doing what I can –“
. That bastard walked back out and I never saw him again, and I was left alone raising four monsters without the cover of a father that pretended he cared.” Eve glares at the pool, where two of her children now splash each other unawares of the venom.
Castiel frowns, “Why would anyone do that?”
Jack accepts the gift, smiling at it. “I… I love it,” he says, “thank you Cas… Dean.”
“Because how else would I have gotten Dean out of that damned cemetery!” Chuck kicks a rock. It rockets through the sky. “If I’d left him there alone, he’d be as good as dead. Where’s the

reason. “Did you stick around only to gloat? Is that what it takes to get you to show up?”
Cas squeezes the panties. “Are you –?”
“In the future I’ll be more aware of my powers when writing.”
Kelly’s jaw twitches in anger, body trembling with more. “I care about my son,” she says, the calmness in her tone concealing the razor sharp venom surging underneath, “I’ve told you all you need. Please leave my house before I call the cops.”
“Cool!” Dean hurries over to Castiel’s side, squeezing at his wrist, “I’ve never seen a ship like

“Depends what you mean by rumblings,” she mutters, “What’s going on? What kinda case are you working?”

“No!” Dean shouts, drawing attention back to him, “No, please, we’re almost
Nodding, Dean slid away from Mia, widening the distance between them. He tried meeting her gaze. She noted how his eyes stayed fixed on a point behind her. “Okay,” he said, “uh… this is… this is so weird…” It’s not an unusual reaction to this method. Mia was well accustomed to this routine, waiting, watching him cycle through his discomfort still and silent as an ice sculpture. Every patient, no matter their differing problems, responded the same. “Hey… hi,” Dean squeaked out, deflating, “
“Wait, wait,” Sam says, waving his hands between the group, “So everything that’s been happening the… the good times and…”
Jack stares at him in awe, jaw slacked. “Sam?” he asks, “Sam what are you…”
Cas stands, readying an approach, when he’s ambushed. The woman leading this meeting strides towards him flanked by Victor. She holds her hand out, Cas politely accepting the handshake. “We didn’t properly introduce ourselves,” she tells him, “My name is Billie.”
“I told you, how a lot of my patients have things and feelings they wished they’d shared with people who were no longer with them. Sometimes… after I noticed how talking about it or grief journaling could only do so much I – I shifted. Became the person who died, but
“Close the door,” he tells Cas, “don’t want to give Sam the gift of
“What do you think is fun?”
“That won’t happen.”
So close. “Yeah, Calvin,” Cas says, lazily tugging on his wrist, “you don’t… you can just go –“
Dean blushes, staring at Castiel from the corner of his eye. “Laying here I… I feel as safe as I did back when I was a kid and had a mom to tuck me in at night. Like maybe…” his fingers drum across his bare chest, “she was right, and that I’ve always had an angel watching over me.”
Cas folds his cuffs with practiced ease.
Billie nods, “Thank you. I’m glad you understand, it’s very important for us that we have this be a safe space for other black recovering addicts.” She gestures at the room, expression softening as she continues. “Me and Victor, we started this program because we noticed how other groups were failing our brothers and sisters. They were unsympathetic, and ignorant, to most of the problems they were going through. That gave context, why they did what they did. This community needed more understanding… so we filled that hole, and we’ve been hosting weekly meetings ever since.”
“N.P.?” Cas reads. He drops both slide and Panavue into his lap, tipping his gaze towards the ceiling. “Who the hell is N.P.?” His neck bends, head reeling backwards. Cas rocks on his toes, ultimately giving up and collapsing onto his ass. Lying down, he releases the brewing storm of tension poisoning his mind with a heady sigh. Imagines it as a cloud of sweet, grass smoke and tries riding that pretend high. He cannot use the real medicine for a bevy of reasons, from it leaving a trace of his presence in the home to having left his joint in his car. That doesn’t quell the urge, only exacerbates it. Alongside the ache in his lower back.
“Pillows?” Dean smirks, “Then what do you use as the actual bed? Giant clam shell?”
“Not this time of year,” Dean cuts him off, “And especially not on a
If Dean wanted to encourage attention, he’d have dressed like him. Mesh shirt with uneven holes, some stretched wider than most. Its woven fabric failed at hiding the sweat that dampened his obviously spray-tanned skin, strips of orange paint peeling like a rind. The bartender wiped his brow, a streak of bright white skin revealed. “A strawberry margarita.”
“That the vent above is called a sun,” Castiel says, “And the pearl is called the moon. Humans walk on legs and breathe air and have men and women and others just like we do. There are families and pets and these strange chariots called cars that people hold dear to their hart. That they believe in
“Not as mad as he would’ve been,” she tells him, “I told him what he wanted to hear.”
It’s a long, quiet ride to the police station.
Cas claps, cutting through the tension before its roots could burrow further. “Well,” he says, “I think we should get going, right? Claire?” He walks past her, grabbing her arm, except she doesn’t budge.
Cas pokes his head out of the bathroom, “What?”
, isn’t it?”
Mia shrugged in response, drifting towards the fireplace to dump her second cigarette. Sam didn’t mind, busying himself with burping Jack. They existed separately in this space, lost in their own thoughts. Although Sam found himself wanting to reengage with Mia, continuing their conversation so he might better explain their situation. His stomach twisted itself in knots, like he ate bad gas station food, because he felt like she misunderstood him. It was stupid. It was completely unnecessary. It shouldn’t matter what her opinion of them was.
in his
“Yeah, you shouldn’t let those douchebags get away with that,” Dean nodded and flopped down on the couch next to Castiel, bringing that tantalizing scent with him. Castiel could barely hold himself back from leaning in to take a whiff.
But Cas had to make things weird with his insane theory that they were mated, when all Dean had wanted was get his money’s worth by finally getting to fuck an alpha. After all, he had let the other one off the hook and was still horny as fuck.
The alpha hadn’t even knocked—he was obviously starting to really feel at home here. He just came in, put down his backpack and said, “Hey, Cas,” ignoring the obvious weird witchy behavior Castiel had planned to avoid in his presence.
“But you’ve slept with that omega chick. April something.” And yeah, sure, that had been a disaster, but it couldn’t have turned him
“Yeah, but he wasn’t good enough for you. Gotta have some standards.”
“How does that even affect you?” Dean asked, pulling his hand back from where it had been fondling Cas. It wouldn’t hurt him to give his alpha a chance here.
work just fine then. Whenever the vision would come to be.
“Sure did. With mom not around and dad on one of his benders, who else was gonna do it?”
Since Cas smelled so delicious and he was actually right there next to him, Dean was close to orgasm in no time. Maybe one or two more strokes…
That first time, Cas had been a bit stiff, but after a few scenting sessions, he was getting more and more comfortable with Dean.
by not hitting on his patient.
Only by the time the orange light started to fade and Hannah had sunken to her knees, the witch was still caught between the realms.
Dean’s alpha rejoiced at that. This was it! He had this alpha in a vulnerable position and they both knew who was the stronger alpha here!
been a lot of kissing involved while they had been sexually intimate. And then there was the fact that they had slept together even after Dean’s rut had ended. The alpha had been very tender with him and they had fallen asleep in each other’s arms just like mates did. It had been very easy to pretend when everything had felt so real…
Not that he had wanted to initiate a scenting or anything. He was just trying to figure out what was up with the fact that Jimmy’s scent had been less strong than usual, that was all.
Pacing back and forth in an attempt to keep his alpha from going stir-crazy, he continuously glanced at his watch. His rut brain came up with images of Cas, on his knees, bare ass in the air, ready to let Dean have his way with him.
Cas was still babbling, “Please!” and “Dean!” and “I need—” when Dean got rid of their clothes with minimal help from Cas, who didn’t have much experience getting in and out of clothes since he relied on his grace to keep them and himself clean.
Cas’ erection was trapped between them once more and Dean felt it leave pre-cum all over his stomach.
“Uhm… Kinda hard to explain. Basically, you want nothing more than to stay with the person you’re scent bonded to all day, kiss them and scent them. And when you do, there’s this tug behind your navel, you know, the one you get when you ride a roller coaster. It’s like you’re high on their scent, and just being in their presence makes you all happy and shit.”
“Yeah, well, still.”
But then Dean just casually took his hand as if they had done that a hundred times, and Castiel’s nerves settled a bit.
He got up and for a moment, Castiel was afraid he might just walk away. But instead, he leaned closer and… helped him up a bit so that he could fluff his pillow. Castiel only now realized that his neck and back had started to cramp up.
He listened to whatever was being said on the other end of the line and then turned back to Dean. “Are you alert?”
As soon as Michael heard the news, he came up with the great idea to invite a few people over to celebrate (or so he said). Castiel and Dean were supposed to be the guests of honor.
getting a cuddle meal at all, but about Dean.
Cas had no idea what to say to that, mainly because he didn’t really know the answer himself. The only time an alpha—or, well,
So, the clear plan of action was to let his brain come up with a better plan in the morning once it was well-rested. With that thought, he turned off the TV, let his head rest against Jimmy’s and closed his tired eyes.
Which was completely ridiculous, of course. Angels didn’t scent humans.
But it wasn’t like he knew a lot of alphas. Dean was Sam’s brother and his name had probably come to mind because he’d heard a lot of stories about him from Sam, who was really proud of his alpha big brother.
So he let his hand drift to Cas’ stomach, stroking it softly as he guided the omega’s head back against his neck to give his pup as much of his scent as it needed. And if he got to press Cas against him at the same time, then that was definitely a plus.
Only then did he finally flop down onto Dean’s bed next to the alpha, exhausted.
to try this pie!” and then proceed to hand feed him a piece, letting Castiel lick every last bit off his index finger before Castiel could be embarrassed about being so… couply in front of his colleagues.
these last few days, imagined how his stomach muscles would clench and ripple when he fucked, how powerful he’d look while holding him in place and pulling him back onto his cock, how blissful his expression would turn when his knot caught… he had imagined it all.
Cas smiled back because finally, his omega had gotten what he had longed for.
“Something important?” Cas asked as he got up.
That had happened a couple of days ago, but the way Dean was telling it, it sounded like it had happened years ago and Dean had been telling the story ever since.
His dick was aching for a different reason.
Surrounded by the warmth of his cuddlibus, he closed his own eyes, ready to fall asleep himself.
Dean leaned over to kiss his
Still, inadvertent as it might be, Cas just kept teasing his alpha and he was quickly becoming sexually frustrated. He needed to find relief or else his blue balls would be killing him. Or he might end up forgetting about all the reasons why he shouldn’t, and fuck the shit out of that little tease of an omega regardless.
Great. That was his last one. Now he wouldn’t even be allowed to leave the house until Monday when he’d get a new one. After all, he couldn’t just buy any alpha scent—it had to be the same brand, which was imported from… India or something. Balthazar always got it for him.
They did look awfully cute. What kind of an alpha had adorable freckles like that?
Dean snorted. “Yeah, right. How would a male omega even fake it?”
a hunter before,” Castiel defended himself because at the time, that had seemed like an important piece of information that might deter a hunter.
When he had the omega right where he wanted him—snuggled tightly against him and lazily scenting along Dean’s throat in return—he let his hand drift up to his neck, softly fondling the tender skin there. That elicited a shudder from Cas, which made Dean hide a smile. Half of the fun of snuggling and scenting with Cas was in how responsive the omega was.
He was a bit sad when they said their goodbyes and were back in the Impala on their way home.
Damn, but with all the rut sex he’d had, he’d never felt this drawn to an omega before. Maybe it was the rut sickness that had messed him up. Or maybe Cas, as an omega companion, just knew exactly what to do to get alphas to come back for more. They were probably taught early on how to hook a new client.
Just thinking back to the comfortable moment before he had realized that Cas wasn’t actually his mate made him get through the day with a smile on his face. That was, until he got a text message from an unknown number.
“I thought it might go away on its own.”
The slick coating his cock felt amazing and Dean drove in harder, imagining it was the omega’s asshole he was sliding in and out of.
“What?” Cas scooted back slightly, squinting at him.
He could be holding Jimmy in his arms right now in one of their nightly keeping-each-other-company sessions. Instead, Jimmy was one house away, mad at him for saying stupid shit.
But the alpha didn’t step inside. “You’re kidding?!”
Hearing the voice was all it took. It sent Dean tumbling over the edge right there in Cas’ bathroom.
Of course, they weren’t courting, but Castiel hoped for
To distract himself from that train of thought, Dean leaned down to whisper into the alpha’s ear, “You’re gonna get fucked now.”
That made Cas tilt his head even further. “Fake-laugh?”
He was slamming his cock into the omega with such force that the condom ripped. Just then, Cas convulsed around him as he orgasmed, and Dean couldn’t have pulled out if he had tried. He tightened his grip on Cas’ hips and spilled into him, pumping him full of his spunk.
“Which, you know, whatever. It’s always this amazing, which is why I chose this career.—It
Something he said had to have struck a nerve with Dean because his heart rate picked up and his expression darkened.
“Guess it starts early,” Dean had typed and circled the date tonight as the first suggestion.
His omega finally had enough after having been suppressed for too long. Throwing caution to the wind, he went full on omega display of submission, baring his neck even further and showing Dean his belly in the hopes he might put his hand there and scratch it.
There was a little bit of a tingling sensation throughout his body that might indicate Cas was feeding on the contact, but it might as easily have been the fact that Dean finally got to touch the omega. What with the low-key crush he had on him, some weird tingling sensations were to be expected.
Since the pup was in need of contact from the alpha, they usually walked hand in hand, which Cas had to admit felt rather nice.
Of course, there was one way that his wings might get the message to stay put—if they were to be treated with wing oil, which would be the next step in the grooming process. But Dean had just spent the better part of an hour meticulously grooming his wings and shouldn’t have to spend any more time on him. Plus, he might find it disgusting getting his hands all sticky.
Everything went according to plan the next day. Dean’s mark was convincing enough as a mating bite and Castiel got the job. But of course, things were never that easy.
“Then we better do some serious scenting while you’re not in heat yet. You know, so that it’ll be easier to hold off later.”
“Sorry,” he mumbled and got on with it, scenting in the direction of the penis to get a better understanding of the kind of magic involved.
So yes, he had a lot of practice squishing his omega instincts—every time Dean smiled that crooked smile at him or teased him about being geeky, following that up with a “But you know I love you for it” accompanied by a buddy shoulder bump.
Cas just sighed, exhausted. It seemed like he was back to worrying about relocation and losing Dean.
“Yeah, all out of those, too.” Dean tried to shoo him away, but of course, Justin wasn’t so easily deterred.
Typical Sammy. Always so logical.
Dean, who was just ambling over to the couch, ran into the coffee table and swore. “I… What… That’s not… Shut up.”
“Well, to be fair, I asked for the courting.”
Sam lived in a nice house in the suburbs, and the first thing Castiel noticed upon entering was the appealing scent. He stopped dead in his tracks and even though it was rather rude, he couldn’t stop himself from trying to scent the air. He could make out the warm, smooth scent of cedarwood, but there was also something indistinguishable and unique that made him lick his lips.
“Actually, I stay for breakfast,” Dean shot back.
It might have been revenge—maybe the alpha had broken the witch’s heart.
Cas heaved a content sigh. This. This was what had been missing during his heat. Dean’s smell and arms around him, making the butterflies in his stomach do somersaults.
This had to be what having a mate would feel like. Cas laid his head on Dean’s chest, and listened to his heartbeat, surrounded by the scent of his alpha. In response, Dean put his arm around him and squeezed his shoulder.
Seemed easy enough. Sam had been absolutely right to ask him to do this—Dean was so ready to help Cas get his sense of smell back.
“We weren’t like that,” Cas denied.
Once he bottomed out, he stopped and closed his eyes, breathing in and out a few times to give Cas time to adjust to his girth.
In stark contrast to Zachariah’s office, Sam’s office was unpretentious and the visitor chair was more comfortable than the one Castiel had to sit in all day. There were pictures of Sam with various friends or maybe family members on the shelf behind him amidst heavy law tomes.
“So,” Dean continued, “I think I should be honest here about my alpha’s needs too. Now that you’re wearing my claiming bite and all. So… thing is… my alpha would really like to spoil you a bit. You know, show you what a great mate he’d make for your omega? If you could just indulge him…?”
“Of course not,” he said into the phone before realizing that he was
“Gotta say, that’s not really a surprise.”
Castiel wasn’t quite sure why he was so angry. If he were rational about this, he might admit that he really couldn’t expect Dean to give up sex for the duration of their fake mating. But he didn’t feel like being rational right now.
Dean logged off too. His virtual needs taken care of, it was time to turn his attention to his real-life needs if his cock had anything to say about it.
friend, whose job it was to find Dean a mate. And yet, here he was, his thoughts circling back to Cas lying half-naked on his bed, writhing in pleasure because of what Dean was doing to his oil glands.
Even the wake-up experience was so much better. Usually when he woke up, he just went through the motions, just another day he had to get through. This time, though, he was in a good mood from the moment he opened his eyes. They had changed positions in their sleep so that Castiel was now using Dean as a full body pillow.
His hands kept seeking out Cas’ stomach, giving the omega a belly rub while imagining that his pup was in there, no more than a day old.
What followed was a strange game of who could hold out longer. Dean’s goal was to get Castiel to beg him to fuck him, while Castiel needed to get Dean to give in to his alpha urges first.
“Dean.” Cas’ voice carried a warning. What for, Dean had no idea.
The next day was kind of spent in limbo. Cas’ heat was only due the day after, but you could never know. It could be a day early or a day late.
“That’s not good either. I have something to take care of. But I’ll be back next Monday,” he quickly added, so that Impala wouldn’t think he was just making up excuses because he didn’t want to play anymore.
But he hadn’t had to go through a heat without an alpha in so long that he had forgotten that that wasn’t a picnic either. All his omega wanted was to have Dean’s hands back on his body, rubbing lotion all over him. Maybe not just over his back. Maybe his hands would dip lower, reach around and… do other stuff.
“Clue?”
Hope you enjoy this chapter and again I'm sorry about the MIA.
“I’m just eating lucky charms, what’s so bad about that? Can’t I eat breakfast any more?” He said around a mouthful of cereal.
“What is it?” He huffed out.
*******************************************************
“Where did you even get those? They weren’t there yesterday.” He asked while getting another glass of water.
“We are pretty much capable of dealing with a growing nest of vamps, but their feeding habits and how they are recruiting is weird. At first we thought it was The Men of Letters doing when we found one of their old cases. But I went undercover, and well, they drugged me higher than a kite. We think the way they are turning more over a few days it must be big. We need any help we can get.” Sacha gave him a short briefing.
It had been four and half hours later, and Dean finding the pie in Sacha’s room, they were all ready to get the night over with. Cian had taken Jack with him since he was a little upset Sacha didn’t give him a job. Sacha said it was to keep him out of trouble, but Jack never got into trouble.
“I can assure you it wasn’t.” Sam added with a glum look on his face.
“That would be me.” Crowley stepped forward.
“I was walking to my apartment, when I heard what I thought was a familiar voice. I went down the alleyway to see who it was, I then heard another voice. I couldn’t quite place this voice, so I looked around the corner and saw Hastur with the angel Uriel.” He got a picture up on his phone and showed the court. “As you can see the angel calmly talking to this demon. They are talking about getting into the forbidden part of hell that only high demons, like the prince or dukes, could get access to. The angel described a stone they want retrieving, a purple stone that has a pulsing glow. He said he could steal it for them if they could get him his wings back.” Crowley finished, going to stand back next to Beelzebub.
So Aziraphale just nodded and went along with it. Making a mental note to try and get Crowley to watch them with him to see why he was so against them.
“We think the vamps we’re looking in to are being controlled by something
“Sacha that wouldn’t be nice to your brother, he is the eldest of the Winchester family.” Cas told her.
Cian let his legs give way. “Cool fangs dude! Where did you get them from? My sister has a party next week, wanna be like that dude from Twilight movies or whatever …. The ones that sparkles… He is the
Dean and Cian kept talking about the case and how it should go from here. Sacha put her opinion in and then went back to loving Jack. Cian found it gross but Dean liked seeing his sister loving someone openly.
“Well why not have me and SAM to watch any activity around the building, while Cian stays in the shops and pubs to try and get chatting to the locals. You and Cas could try other channels or read through the experiments in more detail. Or you can swap with Sam if you want and spend the night with me in a car that AIN’T Baby.” Sacha said with confidence, ignoring what Dean said interrupting her the first time.
She was just bundled in her duvet but her bottom was sticking up in the air while her face was flat on the floor.
They had gotten out of bed and gotten dressed, Crowley had said he would treat the angel to some crepés. Crowley decided that they would have a chilled day; take a walk around the park and feed the ducks, call at the old book store so Aziraphale can pick out a new book, and lastly watch the last of the Star Wars movies while cuddling. Perfection.
It was a cold spring morning, Crowley was still asleep but Aziraphale just laid next to the demon. Just cuddling him and watching him sleep. He doesn’t make a noise.
“If you could possibly do this for us Crowley the Winchesters will do you one request.” Cian finally spoke up. “We really need your help with this as it is bigger than we thought, we would be very grateful.” He sounded genuine but desperate.
She pulled a face, pushed a button, then waited. “Nah, it’s too clever for them. That would be the alpha’s idea if they was, and if they are veggie he wouldn’t be too happy about it. Something in my gut tells me someone or something
“I am still here you know?” Crowley finally spoke. “I’m good at torture but that is cruel.”
“This is a grave misunderstanding, your highness. Why would I commit treason?” Hastur asked.
“Crowley! It is
“Nothing, you’re just weird. The pair of you.” He chuckled and handed her a drink and a yumyum. “Can we get back to the task?”
"I don't eat pie Dean, you know this."
“Why do I smell other angels Zira?” He used his pet name for the angel so he didn’t sound too pissed about it.
Cian didn’t mind as he could use Jack’s mind reading ability that comes with angel power. Very useful. Jack didn’t mind either as he liked helping his family.
Sam called Dean saying Cas might have a case for them and that he should get his butt down to the main study.
Cian looked at Jack who was looking at the door with a smile on his face. He turned around to see his siblings had walked in. They went to the bar and got their drinks, then made their way to the table.
“Pardon?”
A little, natty voice at her ear warned what he said was a lie. She didn’t call him on it, showing
He’s not done.
From Dean’s earlier wonderment, Castiel was surprised how silent their time together has been. After the shock wore off, Dean shrunk back into himself. Castiel couldn’t find a way to break the quiet, so many questions inside his head he couldn’t begin to choose where to start.
different.”
to admit it.”
Sam rubbed his temples, battling an incoming migraine. “I don’t know why, but
“Dean…”
Swept off his feet, Dean falls into the loving grip of his husband. Cas places one arm at his back, supporting most of the weight, while the other arm traps Dean’s knees, keeping his legs bent and Dean unable to wriggle himself free. Cas smiles down at him, laughing.
“The point, Dean?”
“Or…” Castiel says, prying Dean’s hand from his wrist. His needy fingers seep through the spaces between Castiel’s and he clings tight. “Or,” he repeats, breathier than before, “you can join me on the dancefloor?”
“They might have rebranded, but I knew it was them,” Dean explains, “except instead of chasing addicts they were going after an even more impressionable group…”
“And have people see you? Fat chance.” Dean reveals a black, rectangular box. Flips a switch that has his garage opening for them. Creaking slowly, loudly in this small quiet until the final panel fades. He clears his throat, “You can go now.”
Sighing, Cas cuts the cord on Kelly’s pity party. “If you’re feeling this bad, why don’t you make it up to me by being honest about the big smackdown between you and Jack that started this whole mess,” he says. After a beat passes where Kelly chews on her lip instead of flapping it, Cas helps her along. “It had something to do with Nick Pellegrino, right?”
“I had to improvise, so?” Cas chuckles, leaning on his hood, “you not a fan of rainbows?”
Undeterred, Roidy leans closer. Fingertips ghosting where Dean holds his glass as the bartender refills it. He tenses, squirming, imagining the very oil that drips from the man’s head coats his fingers, too, and through his touch smears it around Dean’s wrist. “Listen, you might not know this… but I made a promise tonight. That I would fuck the hottest, sexiest piece of trade in the club tonight. And congratulations… that’s
That was fine. That was exactly what Dean had agreed to when he had signed up for the fertility ranch.
Of course, this was all in the name of making it look good. Convincing. It had to look like a real mating bite, after all.
Scenting seemed like a safe place to start. After all, he could hardly ask about knots and stuff right off the bat. Plus, Dean
The twinkle in Dean’s eyes told him it was too late for any kind of subterfuge. Might as well go all in. “But we could give it a try. See if I can help you with your problem.”
“Yeah, you’re doing a bang-up job with that.” Dean rolled his eyes and then just left without saying goodbye.
What confused him even more than the increasingly frequent dreams was when one night as Dean climbed into bed next to him, the alpha said sleepily, “Night, babe,” and kissed the top of his head before turning off the bedside lamp.
Jimmy nodded gratefully and sat down.
), they had to go to bed, though.
At least Dean was fully clothed this time. They were in the kitchen, where he was about to make himself a burger for dinner.
“Why is your life force going down? We’ve just eaten, you’re asleep and we weren’t in any fight.” His life force should be going
“We don’t feed on sex the same way incubi do. But we can feed on the part of sexual intercourse where two partners who care deeply for one another touch and cuddle while… being connected.”
“My alpha really wants to use tongue,” Dean said. “Can I…?”
“I’ve got a hunch,” Dean growled, “and we’re not leaving ‘till I at least make certain of it.”
