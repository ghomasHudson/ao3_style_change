"Well?" John asks, finally, looking up; and then laughs.
Looking up at him. John strokes his palm up Sherlock's braced arm. Over the side of his throat. He touches the point of Sherlock's chin and Sherlock ducks his head to kiss John's fingers. Lets John slide his thumb into his wet mouth, rub at the thick plush meat of his tongue. John pets at Sherlock's slick bottom lip. His jaw; then slides his hand 'round the back of Sherlock's neck, and pulls him down, Sherlock's arms folding beside their heads, graceful, for a kiss.
"Jacob was his boyfriend?" George asks, and swallowing. John. nods. "So what would be different about it?" George asks, "Now, I mean"; and John's fingers are pressed to his twisted turning-down mouth but stop, stop, so he stops; and drops it down to his thigh.
him, and fuck it,
John watches Sherlock's throat work. His glittering eyes.
I've spent quite some time dreading the point where I was going to have to eventually write about Sherlock's maternal grandmother, because even in a bit part, writing about a fictional anyone who is extraordinary enough to've been famous in certain real, historical circles, is always a little bit of a tricky business. So, just to clear any potential confusion up: Anne Nestor Townshend is not a real person, and she isn't exactly based on a real person either. However, from my research, the only place where I suspect I'm reeeaaaaally pushing historicity is that Isobel would've been born before Anne went to Bletchley Park, and it would've been
He stops. He feels—he doesn't, he doesn't know what he feels.
"Look at me for a second, yeah?" John asks, quiet; and slowly, uncertainly, Sherlock lifts his face. "Yeah," John says, "I will—I would," and then touches his cheek. Still hot. "I'll do anything you ask me to, Sherlock," John explains, feeling—half-sick. "That's—that's
"She teaches primary school," John says. "I'm not entirely certain that counts as academia."
, John is thinking,
—ripped-up shattered sound again while hovering half a handspan from him John can hear himself gasping, "it's all right it's all right it's all right you can you don't it's all right you don't have to," every useless fucking hollow noise with his hands aching updown touch
"But you don't like it," John says, very softly, "do you."
Beside him John sets Sherlock's plate on the draining board so he can wash the glasses even while Sherlock finishes the first plate. At last Sherlock must decide that it's dry, because he stops buffing it endlessly and slides it onto the stack in the cupboard. Doesn't close the door. Sherlock takes the second plate off the draining board, so that beside him John can replace it with the first glass, rinsed, and move onto the other.
"I want to just push myself all the way into you and stay," Sherlock whispers: pressed close. So close. Heart pounding John tips his head back. Twisting, twisting: their mouths meet. Breath caught in breath. Into his open mouth Sherlock says, "I want to—to come into you, to—to
John nods slowly. "She won't be there," he notes. "She's too clever for that."
Sweat is blooming in the small of John's back. The idea feels... sexual, in a way that the kissing hasn't, not entirely, not quite; and something else besides; and Sherlock is nosing along the edges of his hot face and whispering, "I want to touch every place inside your skin"; and a bit of John comes loose, and floats away.
"I'm sorry," John says, very quietly. "I don't know if I can do it like that."
John rolls his eyes. Leaves the toys and the wet flannels in Sherlock's basin—he can sort them out, tomorrow—and pads back in. Sherlock's turned the light out, so John blinks and blinks in the darkness, but Sherlock reaches out from under the duvet. Pulls at his wrist. John climbs in: awkward, really, what with Sherlock's perpetual oversupply of knees and elbows, but he reckons they'll manage.
Hand: he jerks. Folding fingers to fingers across his sternum breathing in: he's fallen back asleep. Awakening to Sherlock rubbing his face against John's shoulder, scratchy and sweet. John blinks over at him: his damp pink mouth; his bird's-nest hair; his pale water eyes, pillow lines on his cheek. "Morning," says John, thick; and Sherlock smiles at him, soft all over, still obviously half asleep. John rolls up onto his side to face him. Puts a hand on his warm bare side and kisses him, at the barely-rough edge of his mouth.
we," he says, flat; but when John grins up at him, wide and lecherous, the pinched expression Sherlock's fighting to keep on his face cracks straight in two. "
"I'm not a child," says Sherlock; and John sighs, and pushes back up onto the couch. Wincing, as his knee grinds: Sherlock rubs at it, gentle.
see; as John struggles, with some difficulty, to put himself back on top of the feet.
"No, I wouldn't. I won't." He rests his forehead Sherlock's shoulder, and slides an arm around his waist.
The third time George had asked him,
John curls his hands. "Mine's not let me down yet."
"—if there's not any point to it, no."
"Look," she says, more gently. "You gave a young mum something to make her feel better today, and some places she can hopefully get help tomorrow, and that's not nothing."
," he says, helpless. "I can't—not do it," his heart thudding painfully, "if I don't know what it is I need to not do."
"You'd've had a good laugh if you could've seen me trying to get that one on," John says: casual, carefully. He takes out his once-worn crumpled-up stockings. The knickers. The bra. The rest, he leaves, and sets the bag down on the floor. "Ought to come with an instruction manual, I think," he says, untangling the suspenders, laying them flat.
Wet for him all over inside: John, careful, licks.
John leans back, inhaling.
—"; and then, throat tightening, stops.
. "Or," John says, but Sherlock says, "Mm—" and licks into him, pulled open fit together warm. And.
"Messed about with it a bit," he says finally, "on Thursday": and Sherlock's startled eyes fly up to his face.
! aching-filling-full as Sherlock pants his way through two shallow, rocking-dragging thrusts while belly tight John tries to force his lit-up stretched humming body to open around him and Sherlock grinds out, "Oh, f-fuck—" and John presses his jaw up beneath his bent up knee gasping while Sherlock shoves himself in with a groan.
The sun is still up, John is realizing. Windows still closed. John is realizing that he is too hot. He untucks his shirt, discards his shoes, opens all the windows; and when he trails after Sherlock into the kitchen, Sherlock has both arms halfway into the cupboard, retrieving a pan; his carrier bag half-collapsed on the narrowest bare patch of work surface, spilling out green fronds. John hesitates: Sherlock hasn't turned towards him, or away, but—Sherlock puts the pan on the unlit hob and moves the bottle of olive oil three centimeters closer and then tugs at the wispy hair at his nape, chin tucked down; and John's heart thumps, twice, in his chest. He turns towards the groceries, takes out the fennel, a bulb of garlic, a lemon; and Sherlock turns toward the bag and John beside it: his expression blank, empty-eyed, looking half a mile away. Queerly, John misses him: barely seeing, Sherlock looks down at John's hands. John passes him the lemon, mute; and Sherlock stares down at it like he doesn't know what it's for.
"Oh, shut up," John says, mouth tugged up and wider.
"Do you really think that it would be?" John asks, quiet.
John rests his hip against the damp edge of the sink: doesn't matter much, at this point; his shirt's already wet all down the front.
— "Always," he says, "
"What, you don't think it
it," shoulders hunching back bowing his body away-arched from John's while he is pushing his bottom back against John's hand as desperate swallowing John brushes his palm over him careful and slow and petting whispers, "Please, Sherlock. Let me do it right, let me get the lube": and Sherlock covers his face with his own huge shaking hands. Aching John kisses his knuckles. The backs of his wrists. "Please," John is saying,
"Mm, 'cause it's mine," John explains, then pushes up onto his toes; "Possessive," Sherlock is murmuring, twisting back; and John says, "Yes."
"John," Sherlock says, and John kisses him, feeling—stretched. Weirdly desperate. Drawn tight. He puts his hand on the back of Sherlock's neck and squeezes, open and closed, open and closed and open, until Sherlock's shoulders loosen and slump. John wants to tuck him into bed and defend him. Let him sleep.
"Yeah," John says, "my back"; and Sherlock nods, petting: his long restless hands. John lifts his heavy head. His tensed shoulders. Sherlock's hands sliding over the—blood-deep ache in his—back and Christ: Sherlock panting underneath him. Squeezing lace strapped across the back of John's hips.
"I've been thinking," Sherlock says, from the kitchen, "about": and then stops.
John can hear him breathing. Feel it, nearly: Sherlock is standing very, very close. Warm breath and warm body, bare inches away from him: John is acutely aware of his cock, heavy and heavier-ing:
," Sherlock says, obviously struggling:
awful, I don't even know why I let Nat invite you"—while Nat is leaning 'round the corner of the table to whisper something to Tariq that makes him bark with laughter, then put a hand over his mouth and shoot Tom a dark, liquid look that even just passing by him makes John shift, a little, in his seat.
"You want him to what, John?" George asks; and John shakes his head.
"But you don't like it that way," John says. Sherlock doesn't answer, his hand light in John's hand. John says, "You don't really like being bossed around."
John finishes with his last patient at five 'til six: unheard of. The charting takes him a bit longer, but he still finishes in time to linger walking out with Rhoda and Natalie, who are still talking about Rhoda's birthday—Nat wants final numbers, so she can book a table. "Priyanka said she'd pop by," Nat says: Priyanka is the more senior of their two locum physicians. "But Brian can't, he's got the kids this weekend and his boyfriend's out of town. Marianne is coming, isn't she?"
"Yeah?" John murmurs.
"Stop," Sherlock gasps; and John rocks back down onto his feet, folds his hands on his knees.
Prague. "You were already in Prague," John, unsteady, agrees.
, John thinks again, like a wavering candle; and then reaches over Sherlock's shoulder to turn out the light.
, Sherlock." Taking a deep, queasy breath. "It's going to break. My heart."
He's cold all over. Shivering. And then Sherlock's hands against him. His fingers, warm and slick with lube; and prickling up all over John's knees slide wider and he gasps and gasps and gasps.
John shuts the car door behind himself, and clears his throat. "Sally," he says, carefully.
John could ask him, he thinks. He could ask him—a lot of things. About the eyeliner. His abstract-art sex toys. His feelings about the Dutch.
It is better, John finds, than he'd half been expecting. "Yeah," he says. It still aches.
John puts his arms around his shoulders. Kisses his hot face.
, barely—and rough Sherlock says, "Open the bottle," and John flicks the cap with his thumb, pulse throbbing in his lips and his ears when he shifts it hand to hand, squeezes— "No," Sherlock says, sharp, and John groans, jerking his wet hand back to his belly with a flush rolling over him hot from feet to face. "Impatient," Sherlock murmurs. Fingers curling.
Sherlock pulls back, looking at him. "I'm not at all confused about whether or not I like kissing you," he says; and "I know that," John says: exasperated, almost. The world's most frustrating tennis match, he thinks: files it away, for later, when Sherlock will laugh. "I just mean," John says, instead, "I want you to feel like you can—
"Yeah," John says, quiet.
—: "Christ," John gasps, "
Sherlock's expression pulls and flattens. "Yes, I did. I was concerned. Would've looked in on you, but—"
: he breathes. "Yeah," he says, finally. He doesn't know how to— "I'd like that," he says, then. "If you want me to."
After a moment, Mycroft sighs. "Well," he says. John can't read his tone.
"God." Sherlock swallows, near and noisy: "You feel—John," and shivering John squirms—down and "Oh," Sherlock gasps, "pl—"
Sherlock notices, of course. "I can—," he says, half-standing; but John is turning back. Hand on Sherlock's shoulder. Not pushing, not really—not more than a bit, because he can't not.
on a case"; and Sherlock, giggling like the boy he must've, at one point, been, presses his broad mouth against John's cheek: two damp sweet aimless kisses, cutting through their heat. John's heart thuds, thuds. He kisses Sherlock's overwarm temple, the sticky bridge of his nose, then lets Sherlock roll him onto his back so that he can clamber over him and out of the bed, all his long hot shining narrow-muscled limbs straightening and stretching while John turns onto his side to watch him reach for the ceiling; crack his shoulders; walk out onto the landing, starkers, from behind. In the bed John is hyperaware of his pulse, his hand starfishing open across his own abs: it's quite the view. Sherlock and his round dimpled arse vanish past the angle of the door; and John closes his eyes.
Sherlock sighs. Eyes slipping shut. Stepping towards him John slides his arm around under Sherlock's and around his narrow back, knee knocking into his dangling bag. Sherlock's shirt is still untucked at the back. "I was going to make it up to you," Sherlock says, voice rough; warm skin; and John's chest squeezes itself in, heavy and tight.
John swallows. "You've just been so quiet today."
us liquid like
"Keep going," he says, quiet; but John— "
John breathes.
Sherlock is very heavy and very warm, and his skin is very soft, and
"Hm." Sherlock reaches for the bag; but John snaps it shut.
He doesn't know, he is realizing. That was later. Rouen was later; so he doesn't know.
They sit. Soak, warmly. Somewhere downstairs John's sheets must be done in the washing. Sullenly knotted up in the machine, starting to think about molding.
, it says,
Sherlock pets at his blood-pounding arching skin careful light and shallow while John writhes, panting; pushes back, panting; and mouth moving against his iliac crest Sherlock whispers, "Is that what you want?"
while John rubs his face all over the 'V' of tender-hot-hard-soft Sherlocky skin at the gaping-wide flies of his trousers mind stuttering-film frames of being caught like this,
"Yeah," John says, and reaches up to touch his knee, stroke up the outside of his long right thigh. Sherlock nods and stands up, holds out a hand to pull John up. Then Sherlock drops John's hand and rubs his fingertips over his mouth and doesn't look at him, so John tugs his shirt straight and heads towards the stairs. Sherlock follows, a beat behind.
, pulsing; in his hands,
"What?" Sherlock asks, quiet; and John swallows.
Sherlock nods. Silent. John rubs at the backs of Sherlock's shoulders. The knob of his lovely long neck. Sherlock's bare knee slides against and between his, stockinged: silky and strange. John hooks his foot over Sherlock's other ankle. Fabric on fabric, slipping up, slow.
"Visiting some friends," she explains. "Last year I went on this yoga retreat—" and John nods, and he leans back, and he listens to her talk about expensive stretching by the fjords and meeting an athletic couple in their sixties at the wharf in Bergen who may've just been friendly but alternately may've been attempting to run some sort of elaborate scam or possibly might've just wanted a third for their sex games, and he laughs. It's nice. John tries to remember the last time he went out for drinks with a friend, and can't; then he does, and is embarrassed: it was Mike, back in June, when John'd gone over to meet him at the Plough and Mike'd told him to bring Sherlock 'round sometime because he'd barely seen him since Sherlock'd started a very small fire in the UCL toxicology labs in April and then got into it with the strategic developments communications manager about their PR overhead and their insurance rates and security'd been issued standing orders to call the police directly, priority one, if Sherlock was spotted again anywhere on site. Mike and John'd talked about the asthma and COPD conference back in the spring, and Mike's kids, and Sherlock's last case, while they half-watched England in the Women's World Cup, but John'd left before the match'd really got going because it'd started to spit down a heavy, sullen kind of rain; and then it'd just kept
"Yeah?" John asks, rubbing his right hand over the next strained-tight button while Sherlock jerks his head into a nod. John pulls the button free and Sherlock stumbles towards him, so that John's nose bumps into the underside of his chin.
"No," he grinds out.
John shivers. "Think about—about you," gasping, "like that."
John isn't stupid, whatever Sherlock might think, and he's been there for all of it, hasn't he? from the first rainy afternoon in the living room to Sherlock sitting low on the sofa, muttering,
"God." John swallows, thick. "I—God, I want to—can I lick you?"
—and Sherlock slams up and away from him so fast the coffee table skids back, squeaking.
Sherlock is quiet for a second. Then he says, "John," in that low quiet hemmed-in voice he'd used with John in his lap and his mouth on John's throat; and John closes his eyes.
"Yeah?" Sherlock murmurs. "Good?" Soft.
When he flattens his body to Sherlock's body the slipknots dig into his thighs: he'd tied them at the front, for ease of access: the very littlest sort of regret. They shift, careful, until their legs interlace and the knots aren't catching at John's suspenders or digging into anyone's quads, and Sherlock's cock and balls and inadequate knickers fit just so into the crease of John's hip, perfect. Sherlock wraps his arms loose and warm around John's waist, sighing; and John tucks his arm under Sherlock's head. Sherlock rubs his nose on the side of John's nose; and they kiss.
, John'd reckon, while he at seventeen was flopping around Oxford between terms, done with his summer homework by day nine and bored out of his overheated skull and—and at seventeen Sherlock would've been
"I know," he says. "I—yes. I do know that. But I—"
look; different, somehow, with two fingers in his mouth. Prickling all over, John wants to laugh; "You dirty fuck," he murmurs, but the way his voice comes out just makes his face hot.
John takes a breath. Lets it out.
"And he thinks one of them is our bomber?" Greg asks; and John rubs at his face.
Sherlock doesn't answer. Carefully, precisely, he dries the first of the glasses, while all around them the quiet is settling in, like the absorbent mass of the muffling air when it snows. In that downy silence John finishes washing up, turns off the taps; while Sherlock dries the glasses and their forks and then passes him the towel, so that John can dry his hands. John does so, then hangs the towel across the edge of the sink and forces his gaze up up up at Sherlock, at all of him: at the corners of his indecisively-colored eyes and soft mobile mouth, at the man who left who is the man who came back who is the man on the stairs and the man sitting in his chair and blushing, descended from a boy fencing badly three decades ago through some unknown span of years before he became a man being someone else for someone else and unhappy: John wondering, hands bound—? on a lead—? and all of them the man who can put on uncomfortable shoes and a constable's uniform and still look like a double-first Oxbridge git in fancy dress; the man who'd bent John over against the door to smack his arse and needed a wager to ask John to kiss him, the man standing above John in the shower while grateful and tender John knelt at his feet. This man, putting away the silverware and standing too close and not looking at him, high cheekbones pink. Sherlock is still half turned away: light lashes screening his universe-dark eyes, when John touches him at last: hip. Rib. Sternum and throat. With each touch Sherlock is turning back towards him, looking back up towards his face, folding his chin-chest-shoulders-hips subtly together like he always does, so that when they kiss John doesn't have to stand on his toes. Enough. John knows enough.
"I wanted you to be happy," Sherlock says, very quietly; and too fast John says, "That seems uncharacteristically short-sighted of you, doesn't it."
yours," Sherlock says, glancing down, and John's fingers tighten on his lube. "You left it on the side table. Terribly careless. What
, I want—" and then moans, chin tucked down, balled up while John can barely stand it, the throb of his pulse in his lonely skin in vacuum for whole seconds while he shoves off his vest and pushes down his bottoms and presses his body back to Sherlock's body fits his arm back around Sherlock's body while he struggles to kick his fucking arsehole in-the-way pajama bottoms down to his ankles and then clumsily toes them off. Hand wrapped hard around the chain across Sherlock's chest, Sherlock's hand 'round his wrist as John draws it
Not surprising, John thinks, remembering. "Yeah," he says, quiet.
Pulled thin. "Will you get undressed with me," John asks.
"We'll be down to Portsmouth as soon as we can," he says, finally. Willing Mycroft to drink faster.
Sherlock straightens, then sets down his knife with a deliberate
"Oh!" John remembers. "Chloe."
Sherlock swallows. At the corner: mouth pulling. He tilts his chin up and John kisses him: cause-effect, cause-effect. Like breathing.
John nods, pressing down against him. Inside him there is a heavy, unanchored mass, tipping and wobbling as their bodies roll together like ocean waves. "Anything you'd do with me," he explains: helpless. "Everything you want."
And there is—there is, Christ, all this air.
"John," Sherlock says, pushing himself back up to sitting.
"John," Sherlock mumbles. John kisses his throat, which smells of his moisturizer and is still damp. Very soft. John kisses his lovely pale just-shaven chin, careful. Gentle: John didn't shave again, did he? so he is careful-gentle-slow as he presses bread-soft kisses to Sherlock's tender familiar skin. Underneath-against him Sherlock breathes in—breathes in—, as John wants—wants things without having the words to know what he wants. He wants Sherlock to
George smiles, which John knew he would. "Back in December," he says, "we talked about setting boundaries with Sherlock vis-a-vis your work," he says.
Sherlock stills. Braces his elbows and lifts his head. "How drunk are
"And do you deserve them," Sherlock asks, after a moment, "those four?" and John's throat closes up.
Sherlock doesn't answer.
-two-three,
Sherlock frowns. "What was what?"
; but he doesn't remember how much of that's true. He says instead, "You were already—," and then stops.
you?" he asks, as gently as he can.
and John goes down too far half-gagging and then pulls up sucking down air and then takes him in again, Sherlock's whole body jerking against him while his thick heavy prick fills up John's mouth and his smell fills John's nose and his eyes prickle-sting with sweat while gasping Sherlock presses his mouth to John's arsehole fucking, fucking his tongue into him, and John—can't. "Can I," John asks, helpless: "Can I just—pull—" and Sherlock whining wriggles his hips so that John can drag the knickers further down and get a hand on him, lick at the head of him and then suck him deep while Sherlock pushes John's knees closer to John's chest, rolling—rolling him up to bury his face in him: tongue-fucking into him where John is already, already wet for, for his—his fingers, strap-on, his entire fucking fist, has got so—so wet for him to, to sixty-nine him for hours bent up in summer sunlight with his, Christ, his fucking beautiful fucking girlfriend dripping into his mouth while they fuck each other all day into orgasm after orgasm each after the other Sherlock grinding into John's starving throat over and over until he is gushing wet over—over his tongue and his—entire—fucking—
"But on Thursday," Sherlock says; and John gives his head a quick, short shake.
, micrometers; and groans, low and heartfelt.
, Sherlock has said.
Sherlock pets his shoulders. His back. "Friday?"
. The left. "I wasn't impressed." He turns, his back to John, and John stares at the lines of the leather straps under his round arse. At the planes of his shoulders and the groove of his spine and "I'd hurry up," Sherlock says, still turned away. "If I were you."
Sherlock is standing almost painfully close. Warm and soft all over, in his sleeping clothes: John flushes all over hot. When Sherlock bends closer, John has to force his knees and wrists and elbows locked, hold himself stiff with his hands by his sides because all he wants to do is push Sherlock back and then back and then
"Come on." Sherlock's throat, moving under John's hand. John looks at him as Sherlock is shifting, stretching back out. Tucking an arm under his head—
John tips his head down. Sherlock's jaw. Cheekbone. Mouth. Sherlock doesn't move, and John rests himself up on an elbow, looking down.
"Sherlock," he says, or—
," Sherlock suggests, stepping towards him. His low-hot pantherish voice: twisting John in two hands. Wrung out in the silence after forcing himself back smooth John could—listening for Chloe down in the car. She would—what would she—put upon. Put upon, she would sigh. She would, John thinks, roll her eyes.
After a moment. "Well," John says, "if you change your mind," as he then sinks his weight down into the center of his body, pressing his skin down into Sherlock's warm, pink skin.
Sherlock doesn't say anything else.
"Yeah," John repeats. "Let's do that."
Bending with him John kisses him back: hungry; unsure about a lot of things, but not this. Sherlock is trembling again, all over. John rubs at the knob at the top of his spine and Sherlock lets him, kissing. Lets John lick into his mouth and rub at his hair and then Sherlock presses his mouth down to John's throat, shoulders shaking, and rocks into him with a little hot gasp. It feels—all right, John thinks; almost—good, nearly; so he lets himself make a wanting noise and Sherlock groans and fucks into him, a hot dark coiled ache. Petting over and over along the seams of the stockings with John's thighs. "Kiss me again," John whispers, and Sherlock panting presses his mouth up. Lets John—shift, a bit. Petting at Sherlock's hair. Sherlock lets John move him. Move against him. Spread his thighs open wide so Sherlock's next trembling movement stays shallower, the top of John's foot dragging along the edge of his arse. John rubs at the sweaty back plane of Sherlock's shoulderblades.
Sherlock's eyebrows scrunch together: a particularly furry and endearing sort of car wreck. "With what?"
John's thumb hovers, reluctant.
"Sherlock?" John calls, and then flushes, reaching out to pick up—
His notebook is on the table between their chairs. No pen. He can't remember the last place he successfully located a usable writing implement in the flat, full up wide open bluewhite air, so he goes to his laptop case for the chewed-on biro he keeps, semi-secretly, tucked into the lining under the open space for his computer where Sherlock is, at least,
"I'm." Sherlock's eyebrows are inching together. "Fine."
Or. "I promise to not shag other people for as long as I can possibly manage it," John says, hushed. Better. Correcting. "And to tell you, if I can't."
," John says; and feels a hot surge of blood to his face, volcanic, ash-crumbling; hoping it can't be seen.
"You were all right?" Sherlock asks, and John lifts his chin. His chest feels strange and knotted up. "Not—we don't have to do this right now," Sherlock says hastily, "if you don't want to, but—but I need to know, I."
you, you know," John says. "I knew what it'd mean to you, I know that you—your, your

"No," he says. "It isn't. Not for what it did to you."
," Sherlock says, with transparent gratitude, "yes, I thought so"; and then he grabs his cup again, takes three long gulps through the straw. Whatever it is it's got caramel syrup in it. Whipped cream. John can see a blob of each, caught just at the lip of the lid.
"It isn't that I—that I don't want to work with Sherlock," John says, hesitant. "At least it was..." He sighs. "Better than buckets for hurricanes, I suppose." He refills his glass. Elbows hanging off the table, forearms digging in at the edge.
John is looking up without noticing in some secret internal lexicon of Sherlock Holmes like a stage magician or a con man, someone who tears people apart with all the secret things that they know how to know. But it doesn't really matter, does it. John feels it all the same.
John lifts his head. "Tell me," he says; then bends back down, licks—Sherlock panting, "Seven—
Against him John feels like he's sinking—like he has been sinking forever. Like Sherlock's bed is dissolving into cloud and drawing them inside it, only bath-warm and cozy. Just as enveloping, though; and gravitational, as though it forms the center of the universe. As though everything outside could have crumbled, and fallen into the sea.
"If you like," Sherlock says agreeably.
— "Tell me," John says, thick, "please," rubbing-purring-petting over him; Sherlock says, "Hungh?"; and overwhelmed John kisses the fragile skin of his testicles. Helpless opens his mouth. Breathing out wanting wanting wanting: "Tell me, please—" to the slow tidal tremble rippling out across Sherlock's skin: Sherlock moans. Doesn't answer. "Please," John says, helpless, thick. "I can't—numbers," he says. "Numbers, at least"; and then helpless-greedy wet-mouthed he helpless
," as he is collapsing in an at best semi-intentional fashion into his armchair, pulling Sherlock down too still laughing hot on John's face as he lands his entire weight on his left knee, a hair's breadth from John's testicles.
"Actually," Sherlock is saying, "I never was much for diving."
you talk about it?" George asks. "What you want, I mean."
"So why wouldn't you be thinking about me doing it, then?"
Sherlock's mouth quirks. "It is, a bit," he says, and starts working on the buckles.
"Me too," John admits, quiet. "Will it—can I sit up?"
"Enjoying the view," John says. His voice wavers: he squeezes his eyes shut tight.
Sherlock rubs his head back against him: John turns to press his nose against his cheek, pets at his sternum, his flat firm chest—
He's not wrong: John does like kissing, he likes kissing
"Thought you were asleep," John said.
The thought comes out of nowhere, almost, a rush of rage and helplessness just behind. He can't wish it didn't: John isn't an idiot, truly; he knows why he finds Brian infuriating. He knows why he'd coaxed Cal into having it off with a boy half their age on the dance floor at Village and he knows why today he didn't walk out of the surgery tonight and just go straight home; he knows why he's wearing ladies' ill-fitting knickers instead of ordering something more intelligently tailored and why he's got Sherlock's unopened eyeliner tucked alongside the shaving cream resting at the back edge of his sink. John'd been tired of being treated like Sherlock's touchingly clueless closeted flatmate since well before they'd ever started shagging; coming from someone like fucking
knows this,
"Hang on," John says, "when you say that the bombs aren't dangerous, do you just mean that he's incompetent, or—"
"Do you really not have it any longer?"

"We talk about
"I knew what I was signing up for," John says, too fast and a little sharp; and Sherlock says, "That's not what I asked."
, if you were me I mean magnesium-flash as desperate John buries his hands in Sherlock's dark hair. Sherlock's breath gusts out mouth open and John doesn't—doesn't—doesn't want to push, or pull, or, or do anything but—
"No, don't bother," says Mycroft, "she'll hardly be using her birthday and her cat's name"; and John nods, pointlessly.
John's mouth tightens.
John nods. Nuzzles at him, licks up the ridge of his back, pets at his lats: "Seven—six—six," Sherlock whispers, rolling up into John's hands. "God, that's lovely," half-sighed, as John pets at his triceps— "five—" his ropey forearms to wrists where they jut into his folded-up hands, pillowed beneath his red, flushed face. "Seven," Sherlock whispers, pushing his face half into the duvet, as helpless John blankets his body tight against him him, sliding his hands up to wrap around Sherlock's opening hands.
, he is thinking.
"Well, I'd expect nothing less from you." John wipes his left palm on his jeans, squares his shoulders. "En garde?"
"Want to get that for me?" John asks, petting, petting, and Sherlock grunts, wriggles his left arm out from under his bent-up knee, fumbling—while desperate and starving John kneels up against him with his pajama bottoms sliding down, feeling like the universe might implode and he wouldn't notice, if he could just—just
"All right?" John asks. Sherlock's throat: up-down, up-down. "Good?"
—and scroll down, down, and then slow on a row with a skinny barely-legal kid sprawled out on display, a cock in between big tits, a girl with fake hair fake-moaning, some awkward-sallow bad lighting on a blurry set of limbs, and a flushed-pink arse filling up the whole little square of the preview screen.
John's breathing seems loud. It rattles around inside his brain. Echoes in all the hollow cavities inside his skull.
"Come back," Sherlock says, wrapped up 'round a smile, and John lets Sherlock pull him back up onto the sofa, kneeling up over his bare lap. Sherlock tugging him down.
John presses his mouth to Sherlock's knuckles. "That," he says, "sounds like a rather lovely way to spend a Saturday afternoon": and Sherlock, throat wet and tearing, laughs.
Except—except—
"Does he love you?" George asks.
John's heart thuds. Aching. "Did you really?" he asks, soft.
, maybe, not—not even usually, perhaps; but he's so often in a hurry, trying to do it quick and quiet in his morning shower or after another abbreviated date or before Sherlock realizes that John is lying awake but not getting up and bounds up the stairs to barge in and sit on his bed and stare at him until John figures out how to ease his hand out of his pants in a way that looks casual and joins in with whatever it is that Sherlock's on about on that particular day. But when there's a reason to hold off, John's perfectly capable of making it last, far longer than
"It's just—difficult," he manages. Tongue thick. "Not to—not to think about. What it was like. The time that he did that and." He takes a breath. "And just—left." He laughs. "And let me think he'd committed suicide, you know! That time!" He waves a hand, and laughs again.
He needs to kneel up so he kneels up, crouching up over Sherlock's thigh stretched out on his duvet pinkandred with his cock curving up hard towards his belly and his mouth swollen, overkissed: the windows are closed under Mrs. Hudson's filmy white curtains and in the silence the light is greying yellow faded silver and Sherlock's skin nearly glows. John touches Sherlock's angular collarbones, thumbstrokes.
John touches his chin, very gently. An apology.
Sherlock swallows noisily. John's fingers winding up with his wet hand. And his eyes—
, eeling all that long stretch of his body up against John's with their knees sliding together as Sherlock presses his palms into long trails down John's back. Sherlock
—clicking as he straightens all the way up, "come on," transferring the bar of soap back to its ledge and his hand to Sherlock's back side pink hip and then shuffling them around together, a quarter turn, to put Sherlock's shoulders back under the water. John rubs his palms flat over Sherlock's spine and his flanks and the backs of his thighs, watching Sherlock holding himself rigid and silent as the soap washes off and his skin flushes rosy in the water. John pets his ribs where they connect to his spine, over the soft pink skin stretching down to the jutting ridge of his pelvis. Seven, John is thinking, forty minutes—and half of those at least gone now, surely. He guides the water in between Sherlock's buttocks, careful, rinsing. "Please," Sherlock whispers, and swallowing John slips his fingers down to follow, careful—gentle—
"Yeah," John agrees. "I know."
"All right," he says.
"All right," she says. "Then—why
, spelled out in careful block letters; and it's enough to let him work steadily through the four patients following before fetching his lunch and a bit of kitchen roll from the listing stack of minifridge, kettle, and microwave tucked behind Natalie's desk; then goes back to his own, without much enthusiasm. Nothing quite like a case of VD to put you off everything, he thinks, peeling listlessly at the sandwich's packaging; prawn sandwiches, as it turns out, and all. He goes back to his charting, tries to think about anything but his food while he eats.
turned the sound off; John shivers. Eases his cock out through the slit of his boxers.
Sherlock makes an unconvinced sort of a noise. "Milk?" he asks.
"Hi." John laughs. Just a little.
Sherlock, this new Sherlock, his older tireder Sherlock had looked John in the eye in November and said,
Sherlock is watching him, when John turns back around. John's barely got one knee back up on the mattress when Sherlock is grabbing at him, sliding his hand up John's side and over his arse, pulling him closer. "Impatient," John says, struggling up to his knees, half laughing; but Sherlock just says, "Yeah," and keeps pawing at him. Tugging him over. John comes perilously close to kneeing him in the balls. He finally settles straddling Sherlock's abdomen, his weight sunk into his knees; Sherlock pulls John down, head and shoulders, curling up. Sherlock's hand feels huge on the back of John's neck. Fingers fisted around the open ring John braces his elbows on the mattress and kisses him, trying not to push back. Sherlock's erection keeps bumping into his thighs and his arse, and every time it does Sherlock gives these tortured little huffs that make John impatient too, hot all over.
Sherlock exhales. His splayed pink starfish hand: "Sometimes," he says, very quietly, "it's. Hard." Heavy John nods: Sherlock looking up wide-eyed unsteady saying, "To believe that"; and John swallows.
Sherlock nods. "Blowjobs," he says, muffled, "in the chem labs."

"It's all right," Sherlock whispers, and John can hear, he can

, which requires players to have large quantities of wide but relatively superficial knowledge about historical figures, so it doesn't seem like it'd play to Sherlock's strengths.
John considers it, as a statement.
"More muscle—bit tight around the thighs, I'd imagine," Sherlock says sadly, "so I couldn't just reach up and—" with his fingers pressing deep and John—John can't—
"There's nothing wrong with our chairs," Sherlock says, but he helps John move them out of the way all the same.
, it was John who was the one to ask if he could suck Sherlock's cock on Saturday, and so. And so he finds himself tongue-tied and furious with himself when on Thursday Sherlock—not gone to bed yet, at half seven in the morning, still in suit trousers and a proper shirt for a late night consultation with Greg, but barefoot; and smelling warm and faintly, deliciously unclean—leans over the back of John's chair to murmur against his ear, "Always the tobacco—smoking kills, you know," as in the bone-white vacuum behind all his blood rushing south, John tries, very hard, not to pass out.
Their faces: warm. Leaking out of Sherlock, out of him: John lifts up his chin and like reflex, they kiss. Their foreheads press together; Sherlock breathes out and  in and out against him, a little too fast. The raw wildness of that comfort: his face pressed to Sherlock's warm living sweating breathing face. John rubs at his shoulder; on the exhale Sherlock shivers, only just: John holds him tighter. His pulse still just a beat too fast.
. "I'm. Fine": laughing, Christ, Sherlock's uncertain noise. "I'm. Fantastic," John corrects; and Sherlock pulls at his elastic, kissing him down to his curling-up toes.
"You know," John says, double-checking his sums, "you could always just... not put the bottle back in the fridge, if it's not got anything in it."
Sherlock's mouth soft on his mouth. His body bowing, soft. His cock like John's cock between them hard but all the rest of him— "We should," John suggests, "go upstairs." Upstairs. Stretched out where Sherlock had said
," John explains, needing Sherlock to— "not the way I—"
"Yes, yes, har har," John says, stepping back.
"Please," John says; and then, very softly, "Don't—don't leave me with it again."
"Sherlock," John moans, arching. Feeling soggy-wet with the better part of £20 of lube, so slick he could take—
Normalcy, John thinks again, out of silence; and then opens his eyes.
what I meant," he says, very gently. "I just—" He sighs. Touches Sherlock's hip through his clothes: "I've got this sneaking suspicion you're going to lie down and fall right asleep," John explains; then looking at Sherlock's distressed face he adds, very gently, "That would be okay." He keeps trying to remember how long it's been since Sherlock said anything. It feels like it's been a long time. John says, "You could put them on me tomorrow, you know," then remembers: that
"You could try, you know," John calls, taking the stairs two at a time, "to be
"Thank you," John says, "that's—quite the offer," and then lets Sherlock take a breath, then another, before he asks, "You know that's not what I asked, right?" Easy. As casually as he can.
: but it makes him laugh, a little, anyway. "He's not got far to go, on the Euston Road," Mycroft tells him; and John nods and lets Mycroft narrate to him the car's gripping transit of the Euston Road and the traffic near the turning until Mycroft says, "He's just pulling up now, John"—quite unnecessarily, John
John eats his last bite of fish and sets his fork down, leans back, chair creaking. Sherlock's foot against his foot is warm. Turned down to look at his plate Sherlock's eyelashes are very long and very pale: they feel soft, John knows, taste salt. Sherlock is hunched over his plate, shoveling in fish and fennel by the forkful: there would've been no one to coax him into eating in Dover, John knows. The assistant one before Chloe, Angela, hadn't got on with Sherlock: she'd been a forceful, statuesque redhead, perpetually unimpressed; but at least she'd not considered it beneath her dignity to bully Sherlock into drinking hourly cups of extremely milky tea, whenever John couldn't get away.
"Do you," he murmurs; and John nods, even though it doesn't sound much like a question. Sherlock rubs his fingers over John's bottom lip, and John opens for him, sucks him in. Licks at the pads of his fingertips and drags his lips over the sides.
"I gave his description to Marianne, at least," Sherlock says. "I could pick him out of an identity parade if I had to."
Breathes.
can't? Texting last night it'd felt as though John'd showed Sherlock that he'd opened a door for the cross-draft, so Sherlock'd crashed full-speed through the plate glass window just beside: it hadn't been John that it'd hurt. It hadn't made much sense, in a lot of ways, but that in and of itself had been revealing.
scrawled drippily on one side, for her tea.
Mycroft pauses, then leans back in his seat. "Over the past several weeks, the police have intercepted several shipments of firearms coming in at the ports—Swansea, Plymouth, Aberdeen, Hull, one rumored for Bristol that never materialized..."
. Sherlock inhaling beneath him and John's face getting hot: peach-velvet skin at his fingertips, and all that blood underneath. "Can I," John says. Stops. Swallows; whispers: "lick you, can I—taste"; and sprawled out beneath him Sherlock drapes his elbow up over his face—and then, without looking, he nods.
"Marianne Chisholm?" he asks. "From the school?"
Sherlock laughs, ragged. "Lights on," he manages. "Mirror."
," chest aching so hard it feels medical: something he could die of, nearly: "I think about lying down with you while—while my parents are in Weymouth and—and after you, after you've undone my bra after work and—and in your room at Cambridge, every night for three years," breathless, so light he might—float—: Sherlock panting up into him biting John's bottom lip while John in between is saying "I think about us in—in Rouen, or in that
"Hm." John considers this, duly. Rubbing his palm: circles inside circles—Sherlock's skin. John says, "You told your brother... that you rubbed me for luck?"; which causes Sherlock to emit a sort of a startled snort, then start giggling: helpless, bubbling over, warm and pliable with it, so that when John tugs him around by the hips, pushing back up to his toes while Sherlock puts his hands on John's face John's shoulders while they kiss, he is still laughing, mouth wide. Smiling John rubs at the small of Sherlock's back, his years-old worn-out dingy vest warm under his palm but nothing to the heat of Sherlock's bare shoulders, arms and fingers, pulled tight in John's hand as John—as John—as John paws at him blind with fondness and then—then
Forcing his spine to straighten.
"Alcohol," Jeremy asserts; and Rhoda says, "Drink the pain away"; and Ben says, "All right, yeah," and pauses while both remaining bottles—already rather the worse for wear—are making their way around. "I more meant," Jeremy is saying, to Ben's right, "surely this is the sort of situation in which alcohol could vastly improve—"
"He won't let me do anything," John manages. Swallows. "Nothing that matters."
He stops. They hadn't used it, but it'd been there: flared at the base and tucked into its own snug-fit section of Sherlock's toybox, between the oral sex simulator and two sets of anal beads: "Ridges, yeah?" John asks, "all the way down"; as nodding and nodding Sherlock moans pawing at John's shoulders and fucking down around him: the sweethot wet drag of his soft inside-skin on John's fingertips as John whispers, "You'd like that?" and Sherlock gasps, "Yes—
"Sherlock," he says, very quietly.
; and Sherlock inhales; and Christ, John'd better—his heart is beating hard at the base of his throat. "Why not just," John says, unsteady. "Just give yourself a bit of a rub, if you find yourself in the living room with no one else around."
: "trapped seventeen deep in all our worst plans breaking new things every time I tried to get a finger free, or—"
Tangling their bodies together. Pressing—pressing close. Pressing in. Sherlock's cock is half-hard, silky between them where it brushes up, now and then, at John's belly, or the lace of his suspender belt, or his thighs. Sherlock doesn't seem to be doing it intentionally, but John can feel him getting harder: the heat of him. The wet kiss of the tip on John's skin.
Sherlock's shoulders hunch tighter together. "You can't even—
"Come here." The words sound thick in his throat, and his face: Christ, when John clambers up next to him, stretches out on the duvet, but Sherlock rolls up onto his side, reaches out. Leans across the chaste handspan of space between them and presses his mouth to John's mouth: opened up all over, panting and wet; strangely sweet. John's hands have wound up in his hair.
"Put me in the right frame of mind to have a bit of a think," Sherlock says, and now,
"I know what you meant," John snaps, and then stops. Inhaling. Sherlock's sharp winter-sky eyes: "Sorry." John inhales, inhales. "Christ. Sorry." He rubs his palm across his eyes, his forehead: overtired.
His eyes are sharp, mouth tugged flat: John hasn't, since; they both know that.

Swallowing. His face hot; ashamed.
": agonized.
John doesn't ask, doesn't ask. His thumb, pink lips; Sherlock swallows. John doesn't drop his hand.
"You don't have to," Sherlock says, quick.
"I can come back," she suggests; and he offers her his elbow, and she, smirking, takes it.
John thinks, for a breath. "It's—strange, a bit," he says, finally. "But yeah, I do." Against him, Sherlock breathes. "It feels—nice. Sort of—tender." Brushing his lips over Sherlock's. Mouthing: "Sweet."
"—keep doing," shoulders hunched as he stalks "
"Sherlock," John murmurs.
"Yeah?" John murmurs, petting his thumbs in circles. Sherlock's thighs twitch, and John bends down and kisses the left.
They kiss. Easy, John thinks. Easier. Sherlock slackening against him. Easier, now. Here, and warm.
"I didn't." John swallows. He feels—jumpy, strange, he—
Sherlock kisses his temple. Gentle: his cheek. John swallows, swallows. Scrubs at his face.
John swallows. Taps Sherlock's elbow. His shoulder. His cheek. Waits until Sherlock is turned full to face him, red-faced, and can meet his eyes.
John shakes his head.
John tastes salt: his own lips.
"C'mon," John manages, "
, Sherlock had said,
"Whatever you want," John says.
"Another time, maybe," John says. Tasting Sherlock on the sides of his tongue.
Stills.
Sherlock's throat moves. His chin, only just; and his knee presses against John's under the table.
"God." He rubs at his face. "You are such a prick." Hand over Sherlock's hand.
"Yeah," John says, shifting. "So. A case?"
Can't quite seem to finish. He rinses the top of Sherlock's foot. He eases it back down to the ground while Sherlock keeps his death grip on his shoulder.
"What do you and Sherlock want that's fundamentally incompatible?"
He scratches at the underside of his jaw.
Sherlock chews. Shoulders flat, back straight; triumphant; so John leans over and steals Sherlock's last piece of meat.
"Yeah," John says. "He shouldn't."
"Like kissing matters?" George asks.
I had a long debate with myself about whether or not to link to anything about the
Sherlock leans. Bends. A kiss. And another.
It's a lovely evening. Still warm. Clear for once, warm, but late enough to not be too sunny, and 'round the corner at the pub they split a bottle of wine at a table outside in the breeze. "So," John says. "Oslo?" and she nods.
"Is it still cold?" Sherlock whispers, and face hot, John shakes his head.
"Please don't interpret this as unwillingness," he says, finally. Carefully. "But I'm not entirely clear whether you actively want me to fuck you."
"John," Sherlock says, unsteady; and John pulls back, looks up.
"What would need to change," George asks, "to make you less unhappy?"
," and then folds his big hand over his own flushed mouth, his eyes wide shoulders heaving and heart pounding head John unknots his right hand from the band of Sherlock's trousers to touch his hot belly beside his open shirt; to slide up under the fall of coat and cotton and up over the pip of his nipple pinched and pulled and Sherlock grunts, grabs John's reaching wrist, holds hard, amber and blue: John licks into the slit of him and Sherlock gives a cracked-open startled honeying moan and John shivers, swallowing—almost nothing, barely—barely even a

"That's good," Sherlock says, hushed.

"So pack tonight," John says, quiet, "then come upstairs to me."
"He was badly depressed," John says. "When he was a kid, he was—he was suicidal, all right?" It makes a bubble bloom rising-up from the middle John's body, wobbling up until it slithers into the crown of his head where it bursts, leaving him weightless. Vision bright.
, and—but there is plastic, still sealed over the lid: gently cracking John down the middle of his cool, clearing mind.
about you, Sherlock, if my cock gets hard it's because it's a slavering idiot dog for you, not because I'm going to sulk if you don't stick something in me—" and Sherlock rolls John down onto his side, and then wriggles in close up against him.
"Hmm." Sherlock tilts his head. His crinkled-up eyes. "My silicone lube would be better, wouldn't it. For when you ride my prick in the bath."

John's chest hurts. "What would you like me to do?" he asks, as Sherlock taps at his screen; and Sherlock turns the screen towards him so that John can see:
Slow John nods, with his empty mouth, thinking. Chasing the last of the shampoo out in fast-running rivulets as Sherlock reaches up to John's forearm. Long hand curling, gentle; and John hasn't asked, has wanted to ask, wants to ask so: "Not the family home, then, is it," John asks. Light not light. A feather tied to a stone: his breath cool in his mouth, and Sherlock's fingers, a firm warm ring around his wrist.
when Sherlock is lounging about in his pajamas and—and reading John's text messages and watching porn on his laptop, probably, and padding about the flat barefoot, with two buttons at his collar undone. John's thinking about the way Sherlock'd pressed himself up on his hands and knees and awkwardly, hesitantly, eased himself down as John's throat opened around him. John's thinking about how it'd made his breathing stop.
And Sherlock.
Under him John nods. It is, he finds, not in doubt. "No one to shout at for not thinking," he says.
John rubs at his mouth. His hand is still shaking: idiotic, Christ, he's fine, isn't he. "Just after ten," he says. He is cold all over. Drenched in sweat, idiotically. "Is—is he all right?" John asks. Unsteady.
John licks across his bottom lip. "Jacob?" he says; as the tips of Sherlock's ears go pink.
Sherlock's eyes narrow. He nods. "Get up on the bed, then. Hands and knees."
"For later," John says, fumbling with the lube, "kiss me"; and Sherlock wraps his arm around him and moans into his mouth as John presses his fingers back into him, heart hammering against his chest. "You." Kissing. "Ready? Or—"
Natalie's face is very serious. Rhoda touches John's sleeve. "Bring him along," she repeats, very gently; and John, appreciating the thought, gives her a quick, one-armed hug.
," Sherlock says, sounding broken: his hands bruising-tight on John's hips. "I don't, I don't know how you could—
"You really didn't know," John says quietly, and Sherlock jerks his head to the side. "All right," John says, and sighs. "Next time you're going to investigate a murderer's lair, please text me so that I can get the afternoon off."
"Unlike being a doctor," she says. Smiling.
"Yeah," John says. It is all right. It's—different. It pushes at him in new ways: all his parts feel queerly disconnected. His hands are still moving on Sherlock's ribs, rising and falling, rising and falling. Slow. John touches Sherlock's peaked pink nipple; Sherlock stretches beneath him, breathing deep, and John leans up for the unopened bottle of lube.
Quick John swipes his hand through the dirty water, which splashes up between them onto Sherlock's ribs; so then Sherlock grabs him by the head and shoulders and John locks his knee around Sherlock's long thigh and Sherlock tries to shove John's face down into the water underneath his armpit while the bath protests loudly underneath them and John laughs and laughs and laughs.
"Tall fellow," Sherlock says, giving his chopsticks a meditative poke about his nearly-empty bowl. "Brays when he laughs."
A half-dozen replies spring into John's mind, but most of them might as well be lifted directly from an inferior class of porno; and none of them are really quite what he wants to say, besides.
because I like you."
And the windows in the living room are still open, damp glistening on their sills. He goes over to shut them, one at a time.
"But you like this?" Sherlock whispers, and then kisses the edge of him, stretched out around Sherlock's three long fingers as John nods and moans and nods. "Shh, I know," whispered, as he is pressing in deep and John groans. Sherlock noses at him: jaw and cheek.
"Clean sheets," Sherlock murmurs, and then kisses John's chin. "Budge up," he says, quiet, and John slides off him, onto his side; but Sherlock pushes the duvet down, saying, "Roll over, can I..." as "Yeah," John is saying, helpless; "Yeah."
"Yeah," he says, "I can do that"; and Sherlock bends to kiss his cheek.
Sherlock's mouth is turned down. The corner twitching.
, sounding uncertain, like he is never uncertain, except—
"No," John says, aching. "No."
"The 30
"That's not how I think about you," John says, very quietly: Sherlock's eyes blinking open, blue and muddy and tired. John asks, "You know that, right?"; and after a moment, Sherlock nods.
Sherlock's chin lifts. "Watching you rub one out on the sofa?"
Sherlock's shoulders are bunching up. "I have to—"
The fingers of his left hand are still tucked awkwardly under Sherlock's neck: he pets over a vertebra, then winds them back in. Stretches his arms up overhead, yawning.
John wipes his mouth on the back of his hand, takes another gulp of tea.
"I like it when you hurt me," John gasps, and then groans, working himself up onto his elbows and knees, Sherlock bent close around him breathing against him pressing deep inside him—John's heart pounding slick-sick inside him while he—
"Hm," Sherlock murmurs, and John grins into the pillow, "I think I learned quite a few of them from you," and John starts laughing again, helpless. Sherlock kisses up the side of his neck, across his cheek. Slides his hand beneath the two of them, hopeful; skin prickling up head to toe—as—John—
Electric, somehow. "If you were," John murmurs, "me"; and under his fingers conductive and hot, Sherlock shivers. Nods.
. And—and the point, the
," low and hot, flooding John's cheeks like tissue paper, blotting red. His throat last night marked in the mirror faded in the morning:
Sherlock sighs.
For his first few months back Sherlock'd had his hair cropped unflatteringly and bleached a straw-like, chemical-crispy blond, but he'd still just looked like himself with bad hair; and the tabloid press doesn't forget. So Sherlock'd wound up plastered all over the newsstands more or less immediately and for something close to two months straight: every red top breathlessly swapping on a near-daily basis from splashy squawking about corruption in the police and collusion in the government and Sherlock's supposed role in assorted long-standing unsolved crimes, to panegyrics about his bravery in apprehending Moran and the circumstances of his dramatic return and how striking he'd looked giving testimony: his odd handsome face and his excellent tailoring and what they'd persisted, erroneously, in referring to as
Sherlock doesn't answer. After a moment, John picks up a pillow, and stuffs it, ungainly, into a clean case. The other: he tosses them to the head of the bed. Sherlock is just standing there watching him, looking—normal, almost; but looking—cut apart from himself, somehow. Holding his own wrists oddly: strings dangling, adrift. Without the eyeliner his eyes are an entirely different set of colors: muddy blues and and greys and yellows, swallowing up the green. He looks unhappy.
"No," too fast, "no."
"John."
"Sherlock," John says, very quietly.
"Mm." George takes a bite. Crunches.
Their fingers wind together, John's hand over Sherlock's hand over John's hand over John's shirt over John's skin: his stomach quivering, underneath.
John can breathe: he breathes. He can sink: he sinks. All this time. Sherlock still taut and trembling beneath him with John's come cooling all over the both of them while aching John kisses his sweat-slick forehead. Hot temple. His burning soft cheek. All this time. So long and lovely folded up beneath-against around him:
Sherlock nods. "Ten minutes notice all right?" he asks, voice falsely light, and drags his eyes up to meet John's face.
"How hot it was, mostly," John admits. "To think about it like—like we were really." He inhales, slow. "I thought about how wet you made me," he confesses, very low; and Sherlock's breath catches. Stills.
: John shivers:
There's been a bomb threat. Two, in fact, for this morning; after four the past week that they'd caught in time and one last night where the bomb actually went off, hours before the threat had specified. "That one was in Kew Gardens," Greg explains, slouching just inside their doorway with his hands stuffed into his pockets while Sherlock slides into his coat and John pockets his mobile, his key. They follow him down to the street as Greg is explaining, "At the base of the Treetop Walkway, but it didn't work—all sorts of smoke and a dreadful sort of burning plastic smell, but counter-terrorism've said that whoever's responsible doesn't really know what they're doing. Probably why it went off before the timer."
, as he pulls his cock out slow and relentless, and John presses his own shoulders tight to his ears.
John shudders. "Thought, thought about you—whether you could do it," he gasps as Sherlock lets him go; "Do what?" sharp all over half-whispered; "whether—" John groans. Every thought flown from his mind as Sherlock digs bruises into his hips: "whether, I—can you, what can you do," gasped, whispered, "could I—Christ."
George watches him, unspeaking; and after a moment, John sighs, and takes his sandwich out again. Sitting up.
"It's not distracting for you," George says, and John can feel his face desert-shifting: an arid, cavernous crack of a smile.
, and watching Sherlock's face as, slowly, Sherlock's mouth parts. As, slowly, he softens, so John's hand softens, as Sherlock's eyes soften: arms looped 'round John's middle softening, for him to lean up to kiss him, long hand spread soft on his back.

"So, then, you plan to just." Sherlock speaks too fast. Hesitates just long enough to take a hot gulp of breath and then says, "Pretend you're—you're Brian Todd and we're headed for some sort of—convenient domestic conformity with one point nine children and a privet hedge—" and John reaches over to wrap his hand 'round his hand.
John trails him back into the living room. "So this is—related to when you were away, then," he says. Not precisely uncertain.
, but then made no sound. "I'd thought, you enjoy it so much when I—"
But this one.

A noise: a response in the negative, John thinks. "I
Sherlock is pink all over his throat, the edges of his ears. He jerks his head: a nod.
Sherlock purses his mouth. "Probably?"
"Sherlock, as far as I can tell you know four figures in history," John says. "You've already been Marie Curie tonight and you were Burke and Hare in Wimbledon
Sherlock is standing by the bed, face startled, posture unsteady. His hair's sticking up every which way and his chin is dark with patchy stubble and his little black shorts are shoved down to his thighs so his erection bobs out bare smeared-shiny from where he'd been rutting it up against John's bare skin. John's hard in his boxers, beneath the duvet. Balls heavy. Skin tight. They'd been kissing. It'd been wonderful. From the other side of the bed Sherlock is staring at John like the two of them've just finished murdering a puppy.

Does the trick: Sherlock, snorting, laughs. It makes his whole face curve up in places John still doesn't entirely know how to recognize or expect: this other Sherlock, who clings in his sleep and dithers when John asks him what he wants and makes awkward donkey sounds when John's not really all that funny at all; or who slides his hands up under John's towel when John bends to kiss him, eager, a little clumsy, like they could both be other people: untouched by other lovers; spotty and/or particularly hostile; boys at school. Sherlock's mouth tastes bad. John pulls back from it with regret; and Sherlock's breath catches high in his throat. "Just—." John twists for Sherlock's toothbrush, wets it, then squeezes a fat line of toothpaste over the bristles and then realizes what he's doing, and—only for an instant—he stops.
dressing gown," and Sherlock starts laughing, loud and ungainly. "Kept me bundled up good and proper all the next winter," John says earnestly, "let me tell you," just as Sherlock flicks a broken inch of noodle at him, smacking into his cheek. Superb.
"You're utterly committed to being the big spoon, aren't you," Sherlock says, sounding resigned.
"Yeah, of course," John repeats, and then pushes up off the mattress, which squeaks. "Requests?"

"Like hitting you," Sherlock corrects; and John rubs at his face with his free hand.
John sits on the sofa. He makes a mediocre stir-fry, overcooks the chicken; packs the second half, not hopeful, into the fridge. He hoovers. He does his washing, during which process he knocks the bag out of the wardrobe, spilling green-blue tissue everywhere while he tries to ball it back up and shove it back in. He gathers up the lingerie, now dried, and pushes it into the bag with the handfuls of tissue and then folds the top back over, creases it fiercely; and then he goes back downstairs and washes boils his dildo in the kitchen sink, feeling sick. When it's clean he shoves it all the way to the back of the drawer in his bedside table: not far. Not as far as he'd like. Then he goes back and stays downstairs until ten and only goes upstairs where he realizes he's still filthy, sweat- and semen-crusted under his clothes, so he takes another shower, hot enough to prickle; then puts on clean boxers and lies down in his room with the lights out and the door open, listening listening listening until it's half two in the morning and his eyes feel gritty and hot; and then—then he goes back downstairs again, just—just to check. Sherlock hasn't come in. John plugs in Sherlock's mobile, just in case. Then he goes back upstairs and dozes, fitfully, for two and a half hours, spends another hour trying to go back to sleep, and then finally drags himself up at six and pushes himself through a much-neglected and depressingly difficult eight kilometer run. When he gets back to the flat his quads and glutes are burning, and he's absolutely
"Response," Sherlock says. Lifting one mobile eyebrow.
showering first is essentially stewing yourself in dirty-person tea—what?" because John is laughing and shaking his head, pushing up to his toes to kiss him: mouth slippery and bitter at the edges. John runs his hand through the spray, rinsing Sherlock's face, his own face, washing out the soapiness snuck into the edges of his mouth; then rubs his hands over Sherlock's chest and arms and shoulders just—just to feel. To feel Sherlock leaning closer: magnet to magnet; head bowed lips parting, skin warm under John's hands. The way his ribs move when he breathes. The long warm soap-slippery stretch of him slotting against John's starving body.
John takes a breath. Lets it out. "All right," he says then, quiet.
"Yeah. " John scratches at Sherlock's scalp. Down onto his jutting spine. Over the muscles of his back, moving under his black shirt.
"You can like it when it hurts," Sherlock says, soft; and John twists, reaching back, knots his hand in Sherlock's thick hair, heart pounding and pulling as he gasps, "I—no, I like—" and then squeezes his eyes shut tight.

, I."
Sherlock doesn't move. Just stays looking down at him, eyes hooded, breathing hard and his hands—John sits back on his heels. Prickling up all over, burning up under his skin. Sherlock's hands curl loose on his knees. He's flushed all down his face and his throat, down his arms sticking out of his t-shirt, his prick red and shining with saliva just under the hem.
"All right?" Sherlock asks, close; and so. So John nods, even though Sherlock is getting up off the bed again, padding around.
Sherlock huffs. "For what?" he says, "for—for the best sex of my l-life—": and it—ought to be a joke, nearly, probably; but it's not funny; and John sets his tea aside, then Sherlock's, so he can take Sherlock's hands in his.
And then air.
"Hello," she says. Her mouth a quirked half-secret handshake on her pretty, elfin face.
"How to do it," John echoes, and Sherlock glances up at him, cheeks pink, eyes bright. He looks a bit like a puppy who's just discovered what happens when he brings the ball

"We could," John says; but Sherlock shakes his head.
"Do you want me to do it," John asks, "or do you want to show me?"
John takes a long, slow breath. "I don't know what I think," he says, very quietly.
Sherlock's eyes are closed, still. Mouth twisted, turning down at the edges. John sidles still closer: knees slipping. Stockings.
"Yeah," John says, thick.
"Probably, I mean—without. More sleep, and—and breakfast, probably, and. More sleep. A lot more sleep." He rubs the back of his right hand over his face.
He sounds pleased.
"Right," John says. Nods. "And Paige is sets, is she?"
Sherlock's not next to him anymore, but that doesn't particularly surprise John, either.
, either," John says; and watches as Sherlock's face floods red allatonce, sudden and startling.
John brushes their mouths together. Sherlock inhales. Presses his palms into the cushions, half-kneeling half-standing still dressed, with his eyes half-open. Face flushed.
"Marianne having a bit of a thing for me, I mean."
He shifts. Sinking back into the sofa. He can't get comfortable, so he straightens up again.
They kiss.
Ah. "So, what's it—." John clears his throat. He's damp under his arms: he scrubs his hand over the back of his hair: "Bring back the birch, and then—what, the post-chaise?" He laughs. "Bowler hats and corsets?" and the column of Sherlock's throat floods red.
. If John could brush his mouth to Sherlock's throat and and to his clavicle and to his jaw until sighing Sherlock drew him back—: John moves with him, soft. Soft. While they kiss Sherlock's arms are warm and soft around him; John pets and pets at his soft hair. Soft. They were going to go upstairs, John knows. A kind of grief. Kneeling up in Sherlock's warm lap kissing him soft and soft and soft and soft and soft but the loss of the slow sweet way they touch each other upstairs under Mrs. Hudson's filmy white curtains: God, John wants to take him to bed.
Awkward, one-handed, but. But. But under his fingers, bent forward, Sherlock is still and quiet, head bowed, and still holding onto John's wrist. When John goes back to work on his hair the pad of Sherlock's thumb presses against the flex of John's thumb in John's palm. The shower is spilling hot on their shoulders and sides: John's right, Sherlock's left; thickening the air, even if there's not enough to keep them both in the spray. Sherlock's eyes closed, his face still, his hair coming untangled in John's hands.
Sherlock ducks his head. He slides his fingers under the suspender, brushing them for an instant the wrong way along the sparse sensitive fuzz on John's thigh; and John'd have to stand, he thinks, for Sherlock to get the one at the back, but Sherlock is silent already sliding his hand to the back of John's knee and lifting, ever so gently, until John's foot is propped on his bent leg. He pets up and sideways; John's back prickles, taut. When Sherlock finds the suspender, he draws it up tight, pressing into the bottom of John's arse and the back of John's thigh while he does up the button looking at nothing, forehead tipped down face shoulders crimson. His mouth parted and wet.
but her expression had been speaking, at least on the Homosexual Broadcasting System's universal frequency; and besides, John's not an idiot. Wriggling around trying to figure out how best to seat himself in someone else's knickers with the back riding up his arse and his balls trying to slither out the leg holes makes him feel like a first-class wanker, though; which is, he supposes, why he's doing this alone in his bathroom in the first place, and not as a more interactive activity for two. By the time he's got everything arranged so he can walk and everything'll stay more or less stationary, the tip of his prick is jutting out from the waistband, half-hard, mostly from his profound sense of irritation. Staring into the mirror he crosses his arms which makes the bra jab into his flesh so he uncrosses them. Now he looks like a middle-aged soldier in a bra and knickers. He's not entirely certain that's an improvement.
This close to his armpit Sherlock is all John can smell: he nuzzles down and closer, nuzzles
! Some—some handsome, arrogant artist-type, 92% ego by volume, probably—Christ, in those awful Mills and Boon cover velvet trousers and waistcoats, would it have been? in 1993? Long legs crossed at the knee in Mrs. Holmes's cluttered living room while she fluttered over his latest composition at the piano and he turned glittering eyes on the beautiful boy hovering in the doorway: hesitating, holding back, in a ratty too-big t-shirt, and an elderly pair of acid wash jeans. But if
John crosses his arms over his chest. "Then he'll be wanting you to go to Amsterdam, won't he," he says; and Sherlock tilts his head, eyes sparkling, unblue.
Sherlock pressed stretched out against him, blurred, mouth turned down wild eyed. "Can you—put, put the stockings on me," he asks, thick. "And then—

would seem to imply otherwise."
John sits up, twisting to look back down at him, which would probably be a mistake but for how Sherlock frowns up at him: comical, overwrought. John can feel it bubbling up under his sternum again, twitching at the edges of his mouth.
"Been through med school. The army. Worked through worse." John licks at his bottom lip. "Would take it to keep you from being slowly asphyxiated in a shipping crate, though."

"If you need some space, you can tell me," John says, very quietly; and then swallows, "I don't—I hate the idea of you out on a case without backup, but—but Mycroft would send Chloe if you needed her, you know, or—or Greg would—" and Sherlock's arms slide up around John's middle and pull and pull and
On Thursday he wakes up before his alarm and goes for a run that leaves him more winded than it ought—slacking lately, he knows. The hazard of a warm bed companion and all the lube one could want: too many mornings cried off. He gets himself showered and shaved and over to the surgery early, he thinks, but Natalie is already frazzled-looking, wild-eyed; she hangs up the phone and looks up at John and says, "Rhoda's out, Brian's on his way but has to contend with traffic—can you take Ms. Pradhan early?" and then nods at their first patient, usually Rhoda's, resting a copy of

the monster, it's ten times worse. If thinking about the prospect didn't make him incoherent with rage, John'd reckon that whoever'd dragged Sherlock around by that lead ring was of much the same stripe. Bonuses and babysitters and tidy boxes and rings: Brian'd probably taken to the streets in 1988, and reckoned everything sorted in 2014. John isn't that person. He won't ever be that person, wouldn't
The sex, that is.
Sherlock is still awkwardly braced above him. Watching: lips parted, wide-eyed; and flayed and burning John bends back down to press an open-mouthed kiss to the long twitching stretch of Sherlock's thigh. Sherlock's whole body jerks, and John
"That's fine," John says, "I know how much you hate to lose": and Sherlock rolls over on top of him and digs his fingers into his ribs—his belly—his underarms, until John is shouting, "Truce! Truce," still giggling; and Sherlock settles down heavily, the weight of him pinning John's back to the bed.
, is different, from mine"; and Sherlock lets out a long hot frustrated breath and pulls his skin sticking from John's skin, to flop out flat on his back at his side.
"Hm." John looks down at him. "Could be."
Sherlock swallows, once. Shakes his head: John stills. "No, don't—don't stop, I need," Sherlock says. Swallows: the down-beat at last. "I don't know," he says, thick. Disorganized. Hand sliding up—John's nape. His hair. Pulling even though properly it's far too short—shivery-hot John licks into his mouth: Sherlock gasps.
— "Tell me," so soft, looking up, "please."
They stand there for a long, long time, until taking a long slow breath in, Sherlock says, very quietly, "Let me finish the breakfast"; and John nods, letting him—a pang—pull away.
He nods.
. John sucks down a deep, steadying breath. Sherlock asks, "You want to...," trailing off.
He stops. John rubs his mouth up under Sherlock's throat. "It's all right," barely whispered. John tasting nothing but relief as he says, "Sorry. I thought I was—Christ. Sorry."
"How can you just," John bursts, with Sherlock's long hands—and his—
Kiss.
— "Which bit?"
Sherlock doesn't say anything. John laughs.

"I don't find that tremendously reassuring," John says, sliding in after Sherlock to the back of Greg's car.
, but that—this one thing that—that sometimes you do that seems like it hurts you and that seems—logically speaking, a fucking—
In the flat, John puts away his shopping. He brews a mug of chamomile tea—he's not been sleeping—and then texts Harry; checks his blog comments and his email; and then Sherlock still hasn't turned up so John scrubs his palms on his trousers and gets back up to do something with his new groceries—pasta with lentils and Tuscan kale. Harry had referred to it, jokingly, as John's 'date night' dish: it was the only proper meal he really knew how to make. He had, in fact, originally learnt it so he could make it for Lily; but by that point, Lily had been a lifetime ago: John hadn't been dating anyone, when he'd been living with Harry.
—pulling back as above him Sherlock groans all the way down to his hard-flushed smeared-shiny cock laying near-flat on his belly and John rub-rub-rubs against him, pets into him, starving-shivering gasping, "I want, I want"; and Sherlock groans, "For God's sake, do it,
John pets at his wrist. His long hand warm. Sherlock turns his palm up, and so John pets at that too.
John pauses. "Well," he says, and Sherlock startles, which is startling; John would've been certain he'd have heard John coming up the stairs. John clears his throat: Sherlock looking back at him over his shoulder, wide-eyed. "They're a right pain in the arse, aren't they," John says, holding out a glass of water. "Literally."

Sherlock is inhaling already when John asks, "All right, can I just—"
John pets at Sherlock's soft lip. Smiling. He is smiling; he can feel it, inside him.
John looks up.
John nods, very slowly. "So it's because they thought
John rubs down over his belly, soft, soft. "You do that to yourself, downstairs in the dark?"
"All right," Sherlock whispers. Hot-faced.
He's moving slowly, John notes: terribly slowly. As though he's caught in some madman's invisible sights. Slowly, his hand comes up, and slowly his fingers uncurl forward; and slowly, he touches John's mouth.
John shifts his hands flat. "How'd you defeat this particular engineering challenge?" he asks. Pinning him down.
John's mouth. His cheeks. He knocks his knees into Sherlock's knees under the table and says, "There's no one else in here," thinking—
"Not much interested in sport," Holmes says, low; and the sea surges up over John's skin.
"Yeah," John says. Nodding. "Your mum's mum?"
Elbows braced beside him above him, John kisses his mouth. His chin, his jaw. "You want me to do it anyway?" he asks, very quiet; and wrapping his arms tight around John's back pulling down, Sherlock nods. The duvet is slithery beneath them; John kisses, for a moment, Sherlock's cheek. "All right," John says, "I reckon we can try it out"; and underneath him, Sherlock exhales, careful-slow unclenching; as John stretches up for the lube.
, despite none of them speaking a word of Dutch, and also developed a terribly clever idea for a custom eco-bike startup, which probably would've been a hit, under any other circumstances, except that they didn't want to actually bother funding it through any of the more traditional routes and decided instead just to steal all of their so-called recycled parts."
?" while Sherlock gasps into his neck, "God—John—" while John moans, pushing back, Sherlock squeezing his hip moving him with him with him rocking-liquid while Sherlock scratches blunt nails over his belly overflowing John sobs, wound up plucking-tight—
"You don't have to," John says, low; and Sherlock slides his hand up, only just, up the back of John's scalp, while every part of John's body is prickling up, tensing: coming.
John brushes his palm over Sherlock's hair, then drops his hand. Lets him stand, red-faced, and lumber off for the shower; and saves the rest of it for later.
The shower shuts off. John swallows. Rubs at his belly. Up to his ribs. The weight of his blood is drawing down between his thighs with all the rest of him quivering, alert; the phantom impressions of long hands all over his body, Sherlock tucking his hot face into John's opened-up throat.
Silence. Sherlock is tucking his violin up under his chin. A blush is creeping up from his collar. He doesn't look at John and raises his bow and doesn't look at John and begins playing, the agonizing beginning of
"Yeah." John nods. Fragrant. Close.
times—
She doesn't answer. Instead, she snaps her mouth shut, frowning at him.
"Yeah," Sherlock says, buzzing John's skin. John's shoulders are tensing-relaxing, tensing-relaxing; prickling up, drawing together. "Also," Sherlock says, and pulls back. Wraps a hand around him, loose. John exhales, slow slow slow. "Easy access," Sherlock explains, glancing down, then looking back up at John's face. His expression is soft, warm; John touches his mouth: soft, warm.
while soft Sherlock moans and then—tongue and helpless John (if you were) pet-pet-pets wanting—everything while soft (me, I mean) Sherlock whimpers and then laps—little—gentle—kitten—licks to John's nipple John not—not knowing—anything but still so much of—of wanting to—to
"Wine!" cheers Rhoda; and Denise leans across her to snag the bottle near Marianne, and top up Rhoda's drink. Natalie and Tariq manage to bump into each other, giggling, as they reach over to fill up Sherlock's waiting glass, which he then clutches by the stem, never lifting, in a whiter-than-usual-knuckled grip. At the other end of the table Ben and Paige are taking advantage of their physical proximity to start in on the sort of political argument you can only really quite manage between people of varying stripes of the very far left, while everyone else wisely leaves them to it; Tariq is, mercifully, leaning onto the table to shout past John in continuation of his utterly transparent meal-long campaign to get into Tom's pants. Under the table John works his mobile out to text Natalie:
John swallows. "Yeah," he admits.
"I need to touch you," Sherlock says, so close, with his muddy exhausted eyes and worn face and drawn lips; and John says, "Then you can touch me"; and then his breath catches, high and rabbitish, when Sherlock bends to press his face down to John's face.
: If you are not a queer person and/or you don't understand why John doesn't get along with Brian, I've done my best to make it clear from context, but the short version is that there's a lot of tension inside the queer community around what constitutes 'success' as a queer person, on a lot of different axes; and that wealthy gay white people, especially wealthy gay white men, who want to get married and raise children can be extremely blind to the fact that not all queer people are like them, and not all queer priorities are their priorities. That extremely reductive explanation noted for the record, I would also like to note that this is one of those rare occasions when I might (

," clambering back over into the bath to try and duck John in the water even though it's still too shallow, of course, though not quite too shallow for John to splash a palmful up at his face which just prompts Sherlock to splash back: an endeavor which—predictably—degenerates rather quickly.
"That's good," he says.
"You're no older than eleven," John agrees, and Sherlock bends to grab his discarded jumper, balls it up, and tosses it dead at John's face.
"Yeah," he says. "Yeah, I do. Because without it." He sighs. "Without it I feel like I could be—" His throat. Tightening. "Alone," he says, finally, "back in Shoreditch," and then adds, unsteadily, "in 2013."

"Yes," Sherlock says. "I told you, I've found that it makes quite a difference as to—"
"Yeah?" John asks, quiet. Trying to read between the tangled-up lines of Sherlock's body and his uncertain red face and just—petting: taut wet furred skin, his thumb. Sherlock digs his heel into the back of John's stockinged knee, nodding, and slow John presses in, steady.

"I do," Sherlock says, low and rough, "I do—John, please, I
Upstairs, John showers, thoroughly. His arsehole is puffy and tender when he touches it: he keeps thinking about Sherlock bending over him fucking him and not looking. Ought he to've stopped it there? Then? Or—before he'd ever coaxed Sherlock into tying the ties he'd bought John 'round his thighs and the second set of stockings, or—or in the bath, before he'd ever held Sherlock's jaw and painted his eyes with purple, turning them that impossible electric green? John can't answer; he

John's face catches fire.
Warm.
"Coaching," John says. Sherlock says, "...What?" but John barely hears: "I think it'd be better," he is saying, crisp and precise, "to measure how well you keep the lads on the fencing squad in line"; and his heart thuds dully at the base of his throat.

John tugs at one damp curl, and Sherlock shivers: breathes out hot against cotton and skin. John swallows. Says, "You're not doing half bad yourself," breathless and hushed.
"Is he suicidal now?" George asks; and John gasps, "Christ, I—no, it's not—that bad, but I—I just—I don't want, I don't want to, I don't want to—to think about that, I don't want—"
Sherlock swallows, noisy, twice.

John pokes around a bit more, then leans over the secretary's computer and taps the space bar: powered down, and probably password protected, anyway. The desk at the back, the larger of the two, hasn't got a computer, but it has got a clear space that's just the right size for a laptop, and a locked and terrifyingly complicated under-desk safe. "If this comes down to me cracking her password, you know, you'll be out of luck," John says.

"Earlier," Sherlock says, and then kisses him:
John swallows. Breathes through his nose, too hard; lets himself open his mouth. Unbuttons his shirt and peels it off, so he can use it to clean off his hands and his groin before putting himself back together, and then—folding the damp side away—use the other to mop, fairly fruitlessly, at the floor. His vest is clammy at the armholes and all down the back. Sherlock is sitting on the sofa. John is still on his knees.
"So," John says. "Is this—typical, then?"
"Hungry?" Sherlock asks, and
He's so warm.
Doubling over above him, Sherlock gasps. Hands crumpling John's shirt at his shoulders, while John works over his flies. His trousers laid open, skin-skimming black trunks—John's mouth floods.
John laughs, not very convincingly. "You could've called, you know." he says. Pauses. "Rung the bell. Sent a text."
He doesn't look up.
"Sherlock," John says, very gently; and Sherlock makes a noise, jerking upright: "Come on," John says, dodging Sherlock's flailing arms through power of long practice, "wash, wash and then bed"; as Sherlock is gasping, "I—eggs but I was going to and, and the marmalade," and John glances into the kitchen, where indeed Sherlock appears to have some sort of breakfast-related plan: a carrier bag is open, spilling out: he's put it on the draining board, Christ.
"What's in New York?" he asks, straightening. He hands Natalie her mobile. "Oh—

Mrs. Hudson in some kind of unholy alliance of people who weren't supposed to care about him anymore to get John showered, shaved, dressed, and rolled up into a cab at a quarter past nine on a bald anonymous Thursday, dumping him out well in time to meet a stooped and white-haired man called Clarence, with the barest hint of an accent and walking with a cane:
, and John moans against his own skin. The thing up him is hard and unyielding, with Sherlock's hands moving him by the hips. Sherlock stops, shifting on his knees, and leans over him chest to back and John arches mouth open with the seams of his body unraveling, and Sherlock pulls back up, almost away. John laughs, raw: how he must look. Speared open on Sherlock's thick cock and shuddering, moaning for it while his sweat and precome drips all over Sherlock's bed, with—behind him, regarding him—Sherlock held fast in leather, the sort of thing he'd not be able to get into with an erection. John doesn't care. Pushes back, panting for it, and Sherlock grabs his hips and says, "Stop," so John stops.
John nods. Exhales. Turning back as Sherlock straightens, pushing his wet hair back from his forehead, to look at him: cheeks red, wide-eyed. His eyelashes tremble: working on not looking, John knows, away.
"You're really not making it better," John calls back, but even he knows that he's smiling.
John nods. Quiet. Nose, cheek.
"I'd say he can't hurt me," he says, after a moment, "but that's your point, isn't it."
"Curry and a blowjob or nothing," John counters.
"For whatever I wanted," Sherlock says.
—," and finally, finally,
And here is John, held in: in a lacy black bra on its loosest set of hooks, elastic still cutting into his skin. In the shop he had had to fumble through his moleskin like he didn't know just where he'd kept it: a worn-soft torn-out page from a notebook half a decade ago, bearing Sherlock's old number (scribbled down outside Baker Street in 2010 because John didn't yet trust the address book on his bizarre overcomplicated mobile phone), Sherlock's PIN (jotted down vengefully hoping for identity thieves after the fourth time Sherlock'd sent John out with his card to retrieve vinegar, four bottles of dish liquid, and a fresh half-pint of milk), and all the rest of the scraps and remnants of two thoughtless far-away years:
, unmistakeable; so John stops where he is, helpless, listening: seventeen steps, one after the other, and the click of the door, and then nothing.
"You're so demanding," Sherlock murmurs, across the joist of his arm; "I know," John whispers, "'m sorry," and Sherlock pulls back and slaps him twice, once on each side, and while still-sparking singing Sherlock lets his hand fall. "You know you shouldn't and you still do it anyway," Sherlock says, low and close, and hot all over John nods. He can hear Sherlock swallow. Hand on John's burning heaving chest: "Lucky, then, that I can think of all kinds of things to put you in your place," Sherlock says, as he strokes his knuckles across John's trembling cavernous belly up-down, up-down; John shudders. Groans: stops. And stops. Sherlock is huffing small bracing breaths, hot on his cheek, and John is dissolving into black air and "Head up," Sherlock whispers, petting; "get your head up, John,
John squeezes his elbows. Drops his hands.
"No," Mycroft is already saying, "Miss Gupta is out of the country. She's—recently made some alterations to her employment"; at which John rolls his eyes:
"Can I play with your tits some more?" John asks; and Sherlock's mouth quirks, gaze sliding down, to the side.
"No," John says, turning his face. Soft: nosing at his nose. Their mouths meet, part: a warm welling-up bloom in John's belly. A burst.
Fingers still. "No, I don't," Sherlock says, very quietly; and John's lips knot and tangle, twisting down.
John doesn't move. Couldn't, probably, without putting in some eff—his heart is picking up. Pinned between Sherlock's braced arms, hands pressed to the sink just by John's hips, John lifts his head, squares his jaw: Sherlock just stares at him, standing far too close, all his chins rumpled up as he looks down at John from about ten centimeters away, close enough to be blurry if John tries to look at both sides of his face at once.
"He's an arrogant, self-centered prick," John corrects. "But. He'd known—he
He's washed ashore just in front of Sherlock's chair, his knees bumping against-in between Sherlock's just-parted knees, and Sherlock's eyes have followed him up, liquid and transparent, flecked with green. John wants to kiss him. He wants to, but—so he—shouldn't. —doesn't, either, does he. Reaches down to touch the edge of Sherlock's mouth, though, helplessly.
you—"
He stops, then leans his head against the window. It ought to be—hot, he thinks; or cold; unpleasant, at any rate, but it isn't.
By the time John is escorting Mr. Hussain back out, Marcus is sitting at Natalie's desk with his feet up, drinking something enormous from Starbucks through a straw; "All right, then?" John asks, somewhat uncertainly; "Oh, yes, fine," Marcus says, with a bovine sort of a smile, and then, wide-eyed, "Oh! A man called!"
—could he?
Sherlock's mouth tilts, curves. He bends forward, scooting towards the taps, to give him the room; and so John creaks up, wincing as the bath squeals as he stands; and then shakes out his aching legs as he climbs over the edge. Sherlock's hand trails over the back of his knee. John shoves everything over to the front edge of the basin and then, considering, grabs his shaving foam, and perches on the edge of the bath.
Knelt on the carpet with Sherlock's bent knees tucked between his, John feels tired, half turned on, and sad. Sherlock looks like he's been through the wars: John doubts he's eaten anything since the half an egg and two bites of muffin he'd got down this morning: he'd skipped the ham and hollandaise entirely, and still ended up throwing most of his breakfast away.
He sounds rueful. Apologetic, maybe.
; but John still could hear it anyway, the Rorschach inkblot of five centimeters of bra strap: for four and a half minutes Sherlock'd gone silent; and then he'd got loud; swinging wildly, perhaps, but he'd still hit back.
"No you aren't, you just never do it." John closes his eyes. "Sorry. Fine, then. Are you going to give me a letter?"
"Do you want to," John says. "Or."
!" Sherlock yelps; and John starts laughing.
"Practical demonstration, is it?" he asks, and then laughs, and Sherlock pushes himself up onto hands and knees and crawls up to nuzzle at John's—collarbone, and—
"If it weren't, I'd say you ought to go back upstairs," Sherlock says, very quietly, and John nods. His thumb is rubbing—
John folds his arms over his chest. "This is about last night, isn't it."
Crumpling up John's throat John's stomach while Sherlock tongue tripping blurts out, "I'd rather—be with you than—be like—but I—I k-keep trying and—" while John kisses his temple, his forehead, his cheek: throat fluttering, whispering, "Sherlock,
He shakes his head. "No. Well—yes, but." His throat feels as though it is thickening. "You get bored," he explains, resting his forearms agains the edge of the table. "Things are either—horrible, or horribly boring, and you—you do terrible things, or fail to do other things and that's terrible too, or—or terrible things just happen, things you can't control, all the time. And sometimes you can—
It's an absent gesture. Unthought. Almost before John notes it Sherlock's hand has dropped as he comes around to John's side of the bed, to open his drawer and get out his box, open it up on top of the chest of drawers. He'd touched his own throat, John is thinking, still: his long restless fingers, momentarily pausing at the side of his neck. So John stops watching him long enough to climb onto the bed. He stretches out on his side on top of the towels because the towels are on top of Sherlock's sheets which are clean, nearly, and watches while standing nude in front of his chest of drawers Sherlock gets out those same two toys he'd set on the table on Friday and puts them on the bedside table beside the base of the lamp with two bottles of lube one of which is nearly empty and the other unopen because he is going to put them inside him, he has been thinking about putting them inside him, he has been thinking about putting his hand inside him, like he has been thinking about the mark he's left on John's throat. John is thinking about what Sherlock is thinking. He is thinking about knowing what Sherlock is thinking. He is remembering lying in this bed on Friday next to Sherlock lying the wrong way around with beard burn all over his thighs and his hair sticking up in charming absurd little licks and his careful flat blank expression that doesn't work half so well as he wants it to as John was thinking:
