Or it could get him shot.  But if they wanted him dead, they could easily have attacked already.
Gordon shrugs.  “I ain’t after the money.  As long as Sam’s dead, I still win.”
Gabriel grunts and pushes himself up so he can look at Sam through his lashes.  “Sounds like someone else I know.”
He sees Dean’s rifle and saddlebags and he relaxes.  Dean wouldn’t leave without them, so he can’t be far.
Shaking off the wonder induced stupor Castiel’s smile put him in, Dean forces himself to step away from the android and walk down the hall.  “Yeah, come on.  This place is huge, and I don’t want you getting lost.”
One of Castiel’s hands slips between them, and Dean gasps when it wraps around his cock.  “Cas…”
“Indeed, Majesty.” Sam accepts the wine with a grateful nod to the servant, even if it is slightly out of character for a prince to deign to notice them.  It’s cool and sweet on his tongue despite being nothing more than a simulation, but after the week he’s had he’ll take any small luxury.
He watches Castiel until he disappears amid the milling crowd, and then he stares down at the empty bottle in his hand, turning it and picking at the handwritten label with his thumbnails.  There’s a goofy grin playing across his lips, but he can’t stop it.  He has a much better buzz from hanging out with Castiel than he’s ever gotten from a beer.
“Wait, my saddle bags,” Castiel hisses, twisting to look down at the camp.  The shadows are still, no longer crawling with Skinwalkers.
The scent of fried food smacks him in the face as soon as they round a corner, and Dean takes a deep whiff.  His mouth waters at the mix of sweet and savory smells, and despite the lecture about questionable ingredients he’ll probably get if Sam finds out, he’s definitely going to get something to eat before they leave.
Disappointment thrums inside him.  Cas had decided the discomfort of the chair was preferable to sharing the bed with Dean.
“My databanks contain instructions on basic care for common illnesses,” Castiel cuts in.  He composes several counter arguments in preparation for Dean’s protests, because whether Dean believes he needs it or not, Castiel wants to provide assistance.
“Sammy!” Dean greets cheerfully as he goes back to his work.  “What brings you by, little brother?”
The idea of putting one of those pills in his mouth and swallowing it makes Castiel’s stomach roil in protest.  He hasn’t been clean for very long, and he has no idea how easy it will be for him to backslide into addiction, and he’s not willing to risk it.  He just needs a little more time.
The brothers exchange a look.  Sam looks apologetic, while Dean looks disappointed.
“No Cas, you don’t understand.
Baby snorts and bumps her head against Dean’s stomach.  Humor weaves through her pain, proving that she understands far more about humans than humans understand about her.  “Keep it to yourself, sister,” he whispers fondly.
Sam hums his agreement, and they share a companionable silence.
She grins at him, her filed teeth reminding him that she’s a parasite, sucking money and life from her victims.  “Well then follow me, handsome.”
“You’re staring,” Cas says as he pins up a pillow case.  Gotta do the sheets while they’re doing the rest of the laundry, or they won’t get done at all.
As ambassador to the land of the Fae, Sam is a pretty busy guy, and his engagement to Eileen, a high ranking member of Oberon’s court, means even more rounds of social events.  So Dean ends up doing a lot more of the work on getting the wedding set up than he expected.  And that means spending a lot more time with Castiel than the bride and groom do.
Castiel thinks he’d be grateful that Dean can’t see him blushing if it weren’t for the fact that hiding his face requires exposing his bare buttocks.  Blood rushes in his ears before racing in a straight path to his cock.  He takes deep steady breaths, trying to calm his raging libido and convince his body through sheer force of will that it is not affected by the position he’s put himself in.
It would be annoying as fuck if Dean weren’t so pleased with his efforts.  Not that he’ll let Sam know that though.  What kind of big brother would that make him?
Relief makes Castiel’s knees weak and his voice sharper than he intends.  “Where?”
men.”
He smiles at her.  What a gentle heart.  Many children make wishes when they pass from the world of the living.  Sometimes they don’t want to leave, and they wish to go back.  Some wish they could see a beloved pet again, or say goodbye to their friends.  A large number of them wish they could take their toys with them, which always delights Dean.
This trip will be farther and longer than anything they’ve tried so far, by quite a lot, and Dean has admitted that he’s still really nervous about it.  Castiel’s parents had offered to buy them plane tickets, but Dean had turned them down, insisting that a road trip is much preferable to hurtling through the sky in a metal death tube.  And he really wants to show off his car to Charlie when they get to Boston.
“Not for killing,” Dean hurries to reassure him.  “Benny and I can handle the rough stuff.  We just need an extra pair of eyes.”
Why had he called her?  He’d avoided speaking to anyone from home for over six months now.  There are plenty of people he probably should have called first, but he knows he can count on Rowena to give him an honest opinion.  As much as he enjoys Dean’s company, he isn’t sure that giving in to the ever increasing urge to get involved with him is a good idea.
He senses the boy might be an ally, but he’ll need to gain his trust.  “Can I help you cook?  I’m not very good at it, but…”
Dean tilts his head back, welcoming the touch.  He feels like he could go right back to sleep, especially if Castiel keeps petting him like this.  But he does his best to stay awake.  Sleeping would make him oblivious to the warm comfort of Castiel and the idyllic peace he’s experiencing at the moment.  It’s the polar opposite of being trapped and panicky inside his own fucked up memories, and he craves more of it.
He peers up at Dean, basking in the way his green eyes glaze over with desire and wonder and something else Castiel can’t identify, but seems to echo what he feels deep down inside himself.  Something he’s afraid to even think about, much less voice.  So he doesn’t think, only obeys whispered commands, and watches Dean come apart at the seams.  A fierce sense of accomplishment grows within him with each gasp, each tremble he pulls forth.
“Honey!” Jimmy calls, although with a house of this size it’s unlikely his voice will carry all the way through it.  “I’m home and I brought you a surprise.”
Sam blinks, completely caught off guard by the question.  “What?”
“Yeah he pops in here now and then,” Charlie says.  “It still floors me that he’s human now.  I can’t even tell the difference, other than how the game coding reacts to his presence.  His mystery programer must be some kind of coding God.”
The life he’d left behind years ago.  Bits and pieces of old dreams, now obscured by the dust and blood of a gunfighter’s trail.
He knows they’re holding each other’s gaze too long, but he’s stuck on just how blue Castiel’s eyes are from this close.
to notice someone so tall.  His dark hair is shaggy, in desperate need of a cut and hanging over his eyes.  Beneath a week of scraggly beard growth he looks very young.  If it weren’t for the way he holds himself and the towering height, Castiel wouldn’t suspect him as a seasoned outlaw.
(See the end of the chapter for
It’s a good thing that he isn’t a teenager anymore, or those thoughts would be dangerous while wearing the thin shorts Dean loaned him.  It’s one thing to masturbate in Dean’s shower.  It’s a whole other thing to stand right in front of him and pop a tent in his pants.  As much as Castiel enjoys his fantasies, he’s not ready to actually take that step with Dean.
“I apologize.  I’ll endeavor to be a worse boyfriend in the future.”
The unfinished sentence is auto-filled by Castiel’s predictive software, and he does not like the result.  “You wonder if I’m programmed to only say yes?”
His racing thoughts are interrupted when the cabin door opens, revealing the pale light of pre-dawn.  Black Eyes stomps inside, his expression thunderous.
“Cas, what’s wrong?” Sam asks.
“This isn’t even my wedding, how did I get roped into this?”
Maybe he should keep tamping down those kinds of feelings, but right now it doesn’t seem as important to avoid emotional ties as it had seemed yesterday.
The question makes Dean’s shoulders sink with relief.  He hitches Castiel’s arm more tightly around his neck and grins at the android.  “Always, Cas.”
Castiel wonders if Dean feels guilty for interrupting his sleep.  He hopes not.  And he’s not going to bring it up and risk causing Dean any discomfort over sharing his home with a near stranger who witnessed a moment of weakness.  “Well I appreciate that you allowed me to temporarily disrupt your routine.”
He takes one of the peppers and bites into it, chewing carefully.  It’s juicy and faintly sweet.  At first he suspects that he’s the butt of another of Dean’s jokes--he hasn’t forgotten the scorpion story--but then the faint spiciness of the pepper bursts into a searing heat on his tongue.
The pain of his brother’s death hasn’t lessened over the years, but it no longer sits with him as a constant companion.  In some ways that makes every reminder even more painful.  He swallows back a sudden lump in his throat.  “Thank you,” he manages gruffly.
that he'd been considering earlier.  Cas deserves better.
"An exorcism," Black Eyes hisses angrily.
“I mentioned in the letter that Alistair is worth ten thousand dollars, dead or alive.”
Dean rolls his eyes and snags Castiel’s elbow, pulling him back a few steps to stand next to him.  “So does Golem, Aaron.  Synthetic voice tech is like a hundred years old.”
He’ll probably get to see the disappointment on the other side of the pearly gates, if he doesn’t end up in a hotter, more southerly location.  It’s not a comforting thought, so he decides to stop thinking it.
Alistair straightens with a put upon sigh.  “Oh if only I could!  But the bosses downstairs just keep sending me back up to this arctic crap-hole.”
He’s trying to decide if he should apologize or let it go when Castiel makes the decision for him.  He steps away from the kitchen island and closes the space between them, standing far closer than Dean would normally be comfortable with.  They’re probably going to have a talk about that, but at the moment Dean is distracted by the warmth radiating from Castiel’s body.
If Castiel asks for assistance before Alistair is caught, the governor might contact the Pinkerton offices himself.  And that could ruin his plans
“Of course it would!” If Castiel had a normal fight or flight response, Gabriel’s sudden leap from his chair might have startled him out of his own.  As it is, he has to silence an internal alarm while Gabriel paces back in forth in front of the fireplace.  Gabriel waves his apple around wildly to emphasise his rant.  “I love the big dumb moose!  And knowing he’s out there getting smashed and slashed and--” he cuts off with a choke, and very deliberately goes still.  He takes a few breaths and then turns golden eyes on Castiel.  “Don’t you worry about Dean when he’s hunting?”
Even though it’s day and the city’s dome is shining with artificial blue light, the lower city streets are lit only by neon, and the occasional yellow street lamp that hasn’t been vandalized as an illegal power source.  The conflicting light sources make seeing into the shadows difficult, even with Castiel’s digital sight.  He doesn’t have a night vision mode like the cybernetics Dean uses, but his grayscale setting allows him to pinpoint movement in a shadowy alcove across the street.
Dean guides him back under the spray, carefully brushing water away from his eyes and forehead with one hand while running the other through his hair.  Once all traces of the soap are gone he reaches for another bottle.  “Conditioner,” he confirms when he glances at Castiel’s face.
“Hey, Dean.”  Sam stops at the table and picks up the unopened bottle of whiskey and the empty glass that had been keeping Dean company all night.  His footsteps thump quietly to the back of the house, and Dean hears cupboards open and close.  And soon the scent of food wafts through the house.
“Only if you don’t want to burn it to get rid of all the germs.”  Dean wrinkles his nose and takes a large step around a stagnant pool of water.  “I’m probably going to burn everything I’m wearing, and then bathe in Purell.”
Castiel excuses himself to take care of nature’s call.  When he’s finished, he stays outside the circle of firelight and watches the sky while he listens to Dean’s harmonica singing into the night.  Constellations he recognizes from Emmanuel’s old schoolbooks slide across the black dome, and he traces them with his eyes until he can’t remember any more of their names.  Then he looks out across the starlit desert surrounding their encampment.
“Having never chosen my sexual partners or the activities I was contracted to participate in, I’ve never had the opportunity to learn what I would want from such encounters.”  He finishes counting the freckles on Dean’s cheek, and moves to the ones scattered across the edge of his eyelid.  “Although I do not think I was programmed to want anything at all.  The other androids showed no signs of it, so I believe my curiosity and independence are the result of corrupted coding.”
.  Dean knows he should do the same thing, but a restless energy tingles under his skin, making his fingers twitch and him more sensitive to every rock and twig hiding under the inadequate padding of his bedding.
Dean doesn’t stir until Castiel’s icy cold fingers grasp at his.  His eyes open, but they’re heavy lidded and recognition is slow coming.  His eyes are oddly glassy, and bloodshot.  When he speaks it’s in a vague, mumble. “Where are we?”
“He’s dead?” Jesse asks.
Castiel agrees, laughing along with Sam even though the notion of facing such a powerful enemy is daunting.  The strain of too much worry is a burden they can let go of right now, in the relative safety of the empty desert, in the warm pool of firelight that beats back the darkness.
A presence at his side makes him whirl, but he stays his gun when he hears an achingly welcome voice.
“What’s that even mean?”
Silence falls over the table again for a few minutes as they all give Jo time to acclimate to coming out of the closet.  It’s Sam who decides to start up the conversation again.  “Dean, have you thought about going to Boston to see Cas?”
Dean tilts his head in the direction of the door, and Castiel nods his understanding.  And then slips his hand into Dean’s and looks up at him expectantly.
“You’re gonna be okay, Cas,” Dean says near his ear.
“This is Castiel Jameson,” Dean says as he steps back to give Cas room to greet Cesar properly.  “Cas, this is our friend Cesar Cuevas.”
Sam snorts.  “Doubtful.  He’s sporting a nerd boner, remember?”
Understanding dawns and Dean smiles, gesturing at the empty chair across from him in invitation.  “Yeah he has told me about you.  How did you recognize me?”
He’s not as good at software - that’s Sam’s specialty - but he’s built plenty of his own bots over the years.  One itty bitty power supply issue isn’t going to stymie him, no matter how fancy the chassis of his newest acquisition.
Ellie gets up long enough to retrieve another porcelain mug, and fills it with tea.  The pot and the cups are nothing like the thick crockware that had been used with dinner.  It looks like something expensive, probably shipped from back east, or maybe inherited from an older generation.  The delicate porcelain fits perfectly within her tapered fingers.
“You can’t keep this up,” Dean says softly.
Castiel’s eyes are drawn to the oil rag hanging from Dean’s back pocket as he walks away.  And how the denim hugs Dean’s ass.  When he disappears into his room, Castiel drops his eyes to the calico cat purring in his lap.  “I’m in trouble,” he says softly.
“Not exactly, Blue Eyes.” She settles gracefully back on the couch, and the smile she gives him is sharp.
When Dean comes down from the highest waves of pleasure, he opens his eyes to find Castiel with his chin propped on his hand, elbow braced next to Dean’s shoulder.  He’s smiling like a dope, the cute gummy grin that always makes Dean want to tackle him and cover his faces in kisses.
Indeed.  Castiel doubts he would have survived a run in with a vampire.  Not with how underprepared he’d been.
“He’s very refined, dignified.  A gentleman.”
The trash piles certainly smell like shit.  Even through the gas mask with its expensive high end filters.  He’ll scavenge anything, but air filters are worth splurging on.  A fact he’s reminded strongly of when a puff of greasy, green-tinged steam hits him right in the face as he shifts a literal kitchen sink to the side to check for damage.  With a disgusted grunt he wipes a gloved finger over the lenses of his mask.  It doesn’t help a whole hell of a lot, but it’s enough to see that the sink is covered with a patch of rust big enough to make it useless to him.
Castiel wants to take his words for their intended value, but he leans away from the touch, suddenly inundated with more sensory data than he’s sufficiently capable of processing.  “You are biased, Dean.”
Castiel’s attention shifts from the argument in front of him to his internal clock.  It has now been twenty minutes and thirty-three seconds and Dean still hasn’t returned.  “Benny, can you call Dean and find out where he is?”
“I know, Samshine, but you can’t tell me you
A short time later he rides from the ranch.  On his way to the river he catches a glimpse of Amara and some of her younger sisters.  She’s on her way toward the orchard, a large basket tucked under her arm, ready to be filled with more fruit from the trees.  Her expression is somber, but when she looks up at the sound of his horse, she gives him a sullen glare. Then she turns her face away and walks on.
“Why didn’t you talk to me before you left, Cas?” he asks into the virtual inches between their faces.
When he was rocking a silicon chassis that wasn’t susceptible to the same damage his human body is.  But Sam doesn’t bring that up, because he’s not as worried about Castiel as Dean is.  He sighs and runs a hand through his hair.  “That’s pretty much what he’s been telling Dean.”
Castiel’s fingers brush the back of Dean’s arm, and pins and needles bloom before the touch disappears.  “You grow drugs?”
When he realizes he’s holding his breath, he lets it out in a rush.  “Uh, yeah.” His tongue feels thick and uncooperative.  “You just startled me.  Do I know you?”
“That’s plenty.”  The smile Castiel gives him is sweet, and a little bit crooked, and it’s tying Dean in knots.
Dean’s fingers curl against the back of Castiel’s head, exerting just the barest pressure.  He grins, and it’s the crooked one that he uses when he’s being flirty, one which now fills Castiel with anticipation.  “How about we forget about it and make out instead?”
It’s happening all over again.  And the image of his father’s face before his eyes had turned yellow looms in Dean’s memory.
The knife is still snugged inside his boot.  It won’t do much against demons, but he’s been concentrating on his memory of Emmanuel’s journal and the exorcism he’d inscribed on the pages.  When an opportunity presents itself, he’ll escape.
When the townsfolk returned, Magda was the only one left alive after the Comancheros rode out.
Newer, bloodier memories slide over the old ones.  Sammy with blood dripping over his chin, eyes black, power radiating like shadows all around him.
Dean makes a rolling motion toward himself with one hand.  “Whatever you want to say about me and Cas.  Let ‘er rip, man.”
Dean slips his palm up from where it rests on Castiel’s belly, feeling the soft hair thin out until it disappears, and up under the open door that holds his power supply.  It’s warm, all of Castiel’s lifeforce held in two batteries.  But there’s no steady thump under his fingers, just slick plastic and aluminum.
“That seems like an uncomfortable place to hide,” Castiel says as he allows Sam to guide him out of the room.
Thank you to Burrsmom for commissioning the lovely art from PurgatoryJar for me! 💚💙
“Yeah, a big one.  I’m no good at feelings, Cas.”
Strong arms wrap around his shoulders, and Castiel presses a kiss against his ear.  “You have nothing to apologize for,” he says softly, but with so much conviction that Dean’s doubts crumble under the weight of his sincerity.  His palms rub soothing circles on Dean’s shoulders, before sliding up his neck and cupping his cheeks.
Ignoring Dean’s glare, Castiel accepts the gun.  It’s heavier than he expects.  “Thank you,” he says gravely.
where he wants, but Castiel’s hand moves with his body, and he’s left needy and wanting.
He tightens his grip on the Colt but keeps it low so its barrel won’t catch a stray moonbeam and give away his position.  Turning his eyes so that he’s not looking directly at the shadows, he waits.  And sure enough, he sees it again, movement like careful stalking.  First one shadow, then another, and another.  Some the shape and size of men, but some walk on four limbs.
“I’m ready.”
Still counting silently, he scans the street.  His gaze catches on the coffee shop sign on the corner across the street.  Coffee, yes.  He’ll get some coffee--decaf, in deference to his nerves.
Maybe not for Castiel’s sake.  But for his own.  If this hunt ends with Castiel’s death, then Dean at least deserves the closure of destroying the demon who held him captive and tormented him.
Dean frowns at them.  “I didn’t sign up yet.”
“For many things,” Castiel says, rubbing the the curve of Dean’s lower lip with the pad of his thumb.  “For believing me. For allowing my independance, and supporting my decisions. And because I just wanted to.”
And then he starts going through the yes pile again, narrowing down his choices to a pair of orange briefs that were a gag gift to Dean from a friend who obviously doesn’t know his secret love for brightly colored underwear, a V neck t-shirt that was probably white when it was new but is now the same grungy gray as anything that ends up in the city’s dirty underworld, no matter how much he washes it, and a pair of charcoal gray sweat pants that belong to Sam.  Once he’s made his selection, he pulls on each item of clothing, smoothing out wrinkles with his palms even though it’s a hopeless endeavor.
Castiel files that information away, and does his best to assist Alfie with making the meal.  They make tortillas and a mixture of beef and beans that simmers in a pot over the stove.  He notices that even though there is a large bag of salt, Alfie doesn’t add any to the meal, instead using other colorful spices and dried peppers.
That is a very broad understatement.  “Yes, I know,” he says, without elaborating.
A thought connects him to the Moondor servers, and Gabriel’s bedroom fades from his perception, leaving him in Loki’s tent.  Since Gabriel isn’t connected to the game, the bed appears empty despite the bunched up blankets and furs near the center. Sam smiles fondly at the lump before checking his appearance in a tall mirror in the corner and donning his mask.  Once he’s confirmed his garb looks princely enough, he exits the tent and makes his way to the tournament grounds. The sun is just barely peeking above the distant mountains, and the air is cool enough to match Gabriel’s bedroom. But a glance at the clear sky--a vivid blue that he’s never seen outside of historic holovids and games, or while under the city’s protective eco-dome--tells him the weather will probably be warm later.
Her smile returns, and he’s struck by the fanciful thought that she looks like a fairy with her sharp features and masses of curly red hair.  He’s tempted to reach out and test if the curls are as bouncy as they look.  “It depends on how much my dear Castiel has told you about me.” She holds out a hand with perfectly manicured nails painted to match her clothing.  She speaks with a thick Scottish brogue, which seems less out of place in Boston than he’d expect.  “I am Rowena McLeod.  Castiel and I are friends, and he’s told me so much about you.”
Actually no.  Castiel’s pretty sure he could lay down on the concrete floor right now and nap for an hour, if not sleep through the rest of the night.  Between the vigorous sparring with Sam, and the usual lethargy that follows sex, he’s positive he won’t be disturbed by odd dreams when he does finally fall asleep.
“It’s okay to be scared,” Sam says as he guides the car smoothly behind Jimmy’s.
“Nice to meet you, Castiel,” Dean responds with a crooked grin.  “How ‘bout we get you into some clothes?”
“You used to have a precision machine for a body,” Dean reminds him.  The lightness that has been in his voice since they came down to the gun range is gone, replaced with the same lecturing tone he pulls out whenever he’s about to tell Castiel not to do something.  “I’m not trying to be a dick by asking you to slow down on the hunting stuff, Cas.  It takes a while to train a flesh and blood body to do shit like this, even when you’ve lived in that body for years.”
“We won’t discuss it.”
The door opens and everything Dean was worried about flies right out of his head.
Dean takes the squirming baby, and his face twists into a disgusted expression.  “He’s wet!”
“O-of course,” the marshal stutters.
“He’s gay, you know.”
Sam throws him a bitchface, but he tucks his gun away when Dean does.
Dean babbles soft, fragmented pleas for mercy, and he lashes out at something dangerous with a wordless shout of fear, nearly striking Castiel.  Little of what he says makes sense.  Something about a fire, something else about someone named Ruby, and something about blood, usually accompanied by a demand not to drink it.
After pressing a kiss against Dean’s hair, Castiel leans his cheek against it and looks up at the stars.  The water laps gently against their bodies from where the waterfall disturbs the surface of the pond and sends out widening ripples.  The rest of the world seems very far away.  All their problems, all their trauma, it barely seems to exist up here in this tiny sanctuary in the mountains.  It almost feels blasphemous to ask about it, but curiosity prods him to speak.  “What happened?”
When he doesn’t continue, Castiel dips his head to try and get a better look at Dean’s face.  “What’s wrong, Dean?”
“Hm.” Dean smiles.  “Yeah, if they can’t go without the boss for a day they should be fired.”
“How long do you think it’ll take to drive up there?”  Even as he asks it, Dean knows that’s going to be too much.  Despite the crowds he’ll have to wade through in an airport, he thinks making the trip in a matter of hours rather than days will be the easier trial to master.
Maybe write him a note, and ask him to check yes or no if he likes Dean the way Dean likes him.
“I’m Eileen,” she answers out loud.
He makes a mental note to make it up to her with an in person visit soon.  It’s been too long.  And he’s sure she’d love to meet Cas in person too--
“Sam is clearly not a monster,” he says quietly.
He can’t let that happen now--he can’t lose Cas.
Stomach churning, Castiel nudges it closer to him.
Sam’s large hand is at his elbow, steadying Castiel from his near fall, and he’s not acting concerned about his brother’s well being at all.  He’s bent at the waist, free hand braced against his knee, and he’s laughing hard enough that Castiel is now concerned for
Dean sends him a rude emoji, which he figures is answer enough.  He glances at Jimmy, who is looking out the opposite window. Even though they’re outside the city limits, the car still self drives, and his fingers are tapping a pattern against his knees, his jaw twitching every now and then.  He practically vibrates with tension, and if he’s been telling the truth about not knowing what’s up with Castiel’s programming, Dean can see why he’d be nervous. Two strangers and a rogue AI broke into his office and are demanding to be taken to his home.
Dean stares at him with wide eyes.  “Okaaay, uh… have you tried just closing them?”
The order is unnecessary since Castiel was already in motion.  He’s slowed by the crowds, unwilling to cause them physical harm, but he’s still closer than Dean to their target.
A smile spreads across Cas’ face and in the fading light of the dying day, Dean sees a blush creeping up into his cheeks.  “I’m glad I’ve improved in your estimation.”
Castiel’s gelding is in the corral, and he stops midway there when he sees who is saddling it for him.  It’s tempting to turn around and walk right back into the house, but he can’t avoid Dean forever.  Not when they need to work together for this hunt.
This time when Jo elbows him he doesn’t jump at all, but it’s a reminder to breathe.  He lets out a breath he didn’t know he was holding and turns his attention to her, plastering an innocent look on his face and hoping she didn’t see his reaction.  Of course he’s not that lucky, and he stifles a groan at the wicket glint in her eyes.  “Don’t,” he warns.
hopes it’s not a bomb.  But if Chuck wanted to murder them to hide his identity, it would have been easier to do it before they left his house.  Unless he just wanted to avoid having to clean up a mess...
“What makes you so certain about that?” Dean asks with mild curiosity.
Castiel grunts softly, and after a few minutes his breathing evens back out as he falls asleep again.  Dean stifles a laugh.  Castiel is not a morning person, but Dean thinks his grumpiness is kinda cute.  He’d asked once how Castiel managed to get up for work every day when he was a cop, and the answer had been
“What about you?” Castiel asks.  “Are you dressed yet?”
“Ah I see Benito has found a new friend,” Ellie says fondly.  She comes across the kitchen with a wet cloth, and cleans Benito’s hands and face, then gives him a kiss on the cheek.  She grins at Castiel when she straightens.  “Be careful with him.”
“Pendants can get lost.” Or torn away by a very determined demon.  Something Dean knows from experience.  He also knows that putting the sigil directly into his skin is not perfect protection.  A knife or a brand could easily destroy it.
Dean huffs a sigh, and then smiles wryly.  His thumb brushes back and forth under Castiel’s left eye.  “I guess we’re both a couple of insecure idiots.”
The Marshal nods to one of his men.  “Tell Purdy we got a customer for him.  Just a plain box’ll do.  Let’s get him buried--no marker.  Don’t want no trouble.”
“You were very subdued the last time I saw you,” Castiel explains.  “Dean said you were probably stressed out and needed some space.”  He frowns and rests a hand over Sam’s arm where it’s braced on the counter.  The touch is gentle, and warmth seeps from his fingers into Sam’s skin.  “I am sorry if my actions distressed you.  My risk calculations left little time for explaining before I executed them.”
He gives Gabriel one more deep and dirty kiss before he pulls away, leaving the other man staring after him in a daze.  Then he rolls off the bed and stands.  “Come on, let’s get this over with and then we can play by our own rules for the rest of the night if you want.”
Castiel’s smile turns wistful as he refocuses on the conductor.  “No, I don’t think so.  But thank you anyway.”
“It’s only been eight minutes and forty-nine seconds since you ingested that man’s blood.”
Lore, sensing that he’s on edge, follows at his heels whenever he moves around the house.  And he’s pretty sure she misses Cas too, if the obnoxious caterwauling is any sign.  She’s started parking her butt in the middle of the living room, yowling and watching him expectantly.  But if he tries to approach her, she’ll flit just out of reach.  At night she’ll curl up on his chest and let him pet her, but when he wakes in the morning he always finds her sleeping on Castiel’s pillow.
Maybe a little bit vulnerable.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m sure Sam’s just fine.  Eileen’s the one who has to deal with him all the time.”
This time when their lips touch, Dean’s part.  And before Castiel realizes what’s going on, Dean’s tongue slips between his lips.
Knowing he’s damn gorgeous doesn’t stop Dean from striking a pose. “What do you think?” he asks, swaying his hips slightly to show off the bulge.  “Should I shave, or are you cool with the manly man hair?”
Dean thinks.  He channels his annoyance into knocking again, much more sharply this time.  “We’re not leaving without my gun!”
“Sam’s not a monster,” he says firmly, meeting Cas’ wide eyes with a hard stare.
He learned to drive in the Impala.  Had his first kiss sitting on her hood.  And she’d been promised to him as a high school graduation gift if he kept his grades up.
Warning sirens are going off in Dean’s head, but he lowers his weapon, and Sam does the same. They don’t put their weapons away though.  Their old friendship with Martin doesn’t give him that much leeway.  “Yeah, you did.”
frown.
But telling himself that doesn’t help because Dean cares.  It’s a pitfall of being a human, unfortunately.
Castiel turns in his seat to face Benny.  “My name is Castiel.”
But it can be a pretty dangerous place if you’re going too fast, or you’re not experienced driving a four wheeler.  It’s easy to lose your seat or roll the machine if you’re not careful.  Dean’s protective instincts roar to life, but he does his best to ignore them.  Sam is experienced, and has been riding through those hills since he was big enough to drive one of the four-wheelers on his own.  “Yeah, you can borrow them,” he says.  And then because he can’t throw caution completely to the wind, adds “but you need to take the CB radio with you.”
“Go ahead and read through it,” Sam says.  “Let me know if you have any questions.”
“I think you remember,” Dean says softly.
“When I was a kid,” Castiel says as Dean spreads ointment over the scrape, “My mom told me there was a monster in the attic that ate bad children.  I didn’t believe her until the first time we watched Return of the Jedi.  She noticed that I was freaking out during the Rancor scene, and leaned over to tell me that was the monster in the attic.”
“What exactly do we have to talk about?  We’re divorced, Hannah.  We have no relationship.”
Winchester strolls alongside Castiel.  The slight outward bow of his legs gives him an easy swagger, but in spite of his height and broad shoulder’d frame, he moves almost noiselessly.  “I’ll call you, Cas,” he announces. “I prefer first names. It helps to get to know the person you have to rely on.”
Castiel gets up from his stool and comes around the island to curl himself around Dean.  “Don’t,” he murmurs.  “Sometimes families live far apart, it’s a normal part of life.  And my mother is rich, if she has a problem with the distance, she can get on a damn plane and come visit.  Hell,
Why is Hot Neighbor knocking on his door?
there is nothing to be afraid of in podunk nowhere USA.  He
He gets behind Baby’s wheel, and even though he knows she’s not real, she’s a construct of his memories of another car in another realm of existence, the door still squeaks just like it did back on Earth.  The leather wrapped steering wheel under his fingers still feels the same.  And the seat still cradles him with the same comfort and support that it has for most of his life.  He reaches for the stereo and pushes the tape in, and the music coming from the old speakers still has all the same static and pops that have become so familiar that it makes listening to it from other sources feel unnatural.
“Still with the horses if he’s smart,” Dean says, although his worry is clear by the way his eyes scan the horizon.
“Your jeans are ruined,” he says, cool and methodical.  He hopes Castiel doesn’t notice anything is off.  His hands are already beginning to shake from the effort of trying not to think about the last time he’d tended someone’s wounds.  Maybe he should have asked Jo to stick around and help with this.
Dean gives him a skeptical look, clearly aware that Castiel is hedging.  But he doesn’t push.  He never does.  “Do you miss Boston?” he asks instead.
“Wait, you’re going with ‘Novak’?” Dean spins around, no longer paying attention to Chuck and Amara’s work.
Half the sandwich is gone before Castiel washes it down with the milk and he moans again as the nutty flavors mix in his mouth.  He drinks down enough to uncement his tongue, and finally gives Dean his attention.  “Thank you.”
NSFW art ahead ;D
They hold each other’s gaze for a few seconds before they both break down into snorting laughter.  When they calm down, Dean grins and goes back to bandaging Castiel’s ankle.
An intense need to see Castiel overwhelms Dean.  “Hey, do you think we can switch from audio to holo?  I’d like to see you.”  There’s a hesitation that makes Dean want to flip tables over his own idiocy, because Castiel probably doesn’t want to give away any clues about where he’s at.  “You don’t have to show me where you’re at,” he adds.  “I’m not planning on hunting you down and dragging you back or anything.  But if you want to keep your privacy then I’m gonna respect that too.”
“God dammit, Cas,” he says to the empty landscape.  “Don’t get lost.”  And then he continues his trek west.
Dean guides Cas’ hand, unfastening his pants and pushing them out of the way.  His fingers grip Cas’ wrist almost desperately when Cas’ cool fingers close over his heated length.  He shows Cas the rhythm that drives him wild, and then lets him explore.
Castiel straightens, staring up at Dean with wide watery eyes.  “I need to leave today.  I can get there on my bike in a couple of days--”
Castiel twists his wrist free, and it doesn’t take much effort because Dean doesn’t have the strength to fight him.  He places a cool wet cloth on Dean’s forehead.  “We’ll go in a little while.  You’re better this morning,” he lies.
“I’m your gay best friend!” he argues.  “I shouldn’t have to ask!”
Dean chokes, and ignores Sam’s grin as he clears his throat.  He tugs Castiel’s elbow.  “C’mon, man.  Let’s go.”
Laughing at her showmanship, he accepts the box.  “Thank you…” he trails off questioningly and in sign, asks what he should call her.
Suddenly Castiel isn’t very tired at all.  “Yeah, you should do that.”
He slows to a stop and looks back.  Cas is already out of sight.  The sudden urge to go chasing after Cas drives him to retrace his steps, but he stops again almost immediately.
It’s on the tip of his tongue to insist that he plug in anyway, since he’s just sitting around, but Dean bites it back.  He’s known Castiel long enough to at least believe that he can read him, and he gets the impression that pushing right now would have the opposite of the intended effect.
Not in the mood for small talk, that’s for fuckin’ sure.  But he swallows back the angry retort that comes to mind and answers honestly.  “Kind of in a shitty mood right now.  You?”
Dean sits down on the edge to pull off his boots, and Castiel’s attention fixes on him.  The bed sinks invitingly under his weight, and Castiel’s whole body cries out for its soft comfort.  But he’s frozen near the door, unable to process the idea of sharing it with Dean.
The knot of aggravation in his stomach tightens when Winchester simply starts walking again.  Castiel quickly catches up with him, and is annoyed that he’s required to lengthen his strides to keep pace with the taller man.  “Mr. Winchester, what did you mean by that?”
And then he’s falling to the ground.  He coughs, and rubs up at his throat as he looks up at Alistair.
Unfortunately right now he wishes he could turn the volume down on his internal senses.  The distress radiating from the pegasus is nearly splitting his head open. It’s all he can do not to fall over as he rushes to her enclosure to find out what’s wrong, but he manages to get there without tripping and faceplanting on the way.
The squint intensifies, followed predictably by the head tilt.  “Of course I am ‘into it’,” he says with accompanying air quotes, because somehow his digital personality is nerdy as fuck, intentional or not.  “And I’d very much like to continue having sex with you.”
That brings Castiel’s gaze back to him.  He’s still making that frowny-squinty face, but it seems less annoyed and more curious.  “I am not technically alive.”
“Sam, I don’t have your amnesty papers anymore.  I had to leave them behind to escape the Skinwalkers.”  Sam curses and Castiel shares the sentiment wholeheartedly.  “We have to find another way to get him out of there.”
Dean shakes his head.  “Don’t worry about me.  Go get ready.”
Castiel’s icy glare could drop a human on the spot, dead of heart failure.  Dean just thinks it’s adorable.  “Don’t be ridiculous.  Wiping out all of humanity would render me obsolete.”
Castiel has a thousand more questions, but the sound of hooves brings his attention around.  He catches sight of Dean leading the horses back to camp.  He guides Honey and Bones by tethers, but Baby follows him freely.
Dean rolls his eyes.  “Dork.”  But he leans down for another kiss.
“Does this make me Princess Leia?” Dean asks with a mock wince.  He wouldn’t mind being as awesome as Carrie Fisher, no matter what role.
He’d stopped at Castiel’s room earlier, but found him already gone.  There’d been so much left unsaid between them when Amara interrupted them, and Dean had hoped to talk to him.
Dean jerks away from his brother’s grip and hisses at him.  “Sam, this ain’t no run of the mill hunt.  The danger is--”
strong.”
Castiel presses a hand over his chest, and smiles.  “Yes, it was very generous.”
Cool as a mountain breeze, Jameson gazes back.  “Yes. Too bad I missed.”
It doesn’t say anywhere that this Novak guy works directly with the VI programming, but the company records Charlie dug up don’t include a VI division, so he doesn’t know who else it could be.  The only way to find out for sure is to talk to someone who works at the manufacturing plant, preferably Novak if Sam can get to him, and that’s going to be tough. He doubts he could just call the guy, or waltz into his office and request an interview.  Even if he could do the latter, the distance is too far to go unprotected from the sun, and taking his bike is out of the question. And so is taking one of Dean’s cars since that’s bound to bring up questions he’s not ready to answer. The speed trains will get him there safely and quickly, but he’ll still have to come up with some kind of excuse for leaving the state.
No longer a whisper, that voice is gruff, full of emotion, and dearly familiar.
Dean lifts one shoulder in an impudent shrug.  “No, but I’ll be forever grateful for your…” he pauses, head tilted as he appears to search for the right words.  “Your skills at saving my life.”
Please.”
Dean turns his attention down and to the side to find the shop owner’s daughter smirking up at him.  He glares at her for the nickname, although there’s not much heat behind it. “He’s just a friend, kiddo.”
Until Dean’s other hand starts spreading the suds around too, and that is far more interesting.  Slick and warm, and yet Castiel can also feel the roughness of his calluses.  His breath hitches when the cloth rubs over his nipples, and gets caught in his throat when they harden in the wake of Dean’s touch.  But then Dean’s hands move lower, and Castiel forgets how to breathe altogether.
Without looking at his brother, Dean shoots back the amber liquid, and puts the cap on the decanter.  He keeps his eyes lowered, unwilling to face the pity he knows will be all over Sam’s face.  He’d like to down another few shots to numb the burning shame under his skin, but there’s a small part of him that doesn’t want to be completely fuckered up if Cas decides to come back home.
“I’m not just a computer,” Castiel protests with an offended frown.  He pats his chest over the open cavity holding the two hover cycle batteries cobbled together into a single power supply that are slowly recharging through the cord connecting him to the wall.  “I’m… I’m…”
Dean feels energized, although if he moves too quickly there’s still some lingering dizziness from the medication.  He’s also starving, so he eventually presses a kiss to Castiel’s shoulder before leaving him alone in the bathroom to shave while Dean goes to raid the fridge where he finds the ingredients for sandwiches.
He’s so focused on the tender flesh under his lips that he’s almost startled by the feather brush of fingers against his stomach.  They linger with uncertainty along the edge of his pants.
It’s hard to tell if you don’t know him.  Sam sometimes thinks Castiel’s stoicism and Dean’s sublimation kinda make them perfect for each other.  Not that he’d say so out loud where either of them could hear him.  He’s not going to be the one to rock their very fragile balance with each other.
His vision, the only thing that feels familiar, goes blurry and he looks around wildly, trying to focus.  “Dean?” he gasps.
Dean curls his fingers into Castiel’s shirt.  “Me too.”
Cute, even.
The hours pass slowly until the end of the work day.  When Dean finally closes the shop, it’s a huge relief.  The work had done little to keep his mind off how much he misses Castiel.
It turns out Dean is right about Google Maps not picking up the best signal in some places, and it’s a good thing they’d looked up the directions.  They start out with the windows down, but as they get further north it gets cool enough that they roll the windows up and turn down the stereo since they don’t need to blast it over the wind in their ears.  They stop a few times at rest stops to stretch their legs, and eat the snacks Ellen sent along with them.  Their first pit stop for lunch is late afternoon, in a dingy little diner somewhere in Colorado.  The burgers are mediocre, but Dean is fanatical about the high quality of their pies.  They order a couple slices to go, and as they drive away, Dean is already planning on stopping there again when they come through again on their way home.
Castiel hesitates, but he knows Dean is right.  It’s why he left them behind in the first place.  He doesn’t mention the pardons; they’re not as important as finding safety right now.
Then he turns back to the door, puts his palm on the handle, and applies pressure.  The door swings open, and his audio sensors are inundated with the sound of machinery and very loud rock music.
They leave the tent and find themselves at the edge of a large encampment.  The flags of many nations flutter at the entrances of the rainbow of tents surrounding them, which makes Sam grimace.  “I forgot there was a tournament going on.”
Ain’t nothin’ in that kit of yours that can take him on.  In fact, that gun is the
Castiel still doesn’t move, searching Dean’s face for truth.  Dean smiles warmly and resists the urge to cup his greasy hands around Castiel’s face.  In the midst of his worry about his father, Castiel still has space in his heart and mind for Dean.  It’s no wonder Dean has fallen so deeply in love with him.
Dean’s sure that’s not exactly how Castiel would have phrased it, even with his evolving conversational skills.  “
“Uh, think again,” Sam says as he crouches down over the fish and removes the hook with a pair of pliers.  “This sucker’s mine.”
“Did you ever do something other than what you were supposed to do with your clients?  Y’know, just to fuck with them?” Dean’s eyes narrow warningly.  “And I don’t mean literally.”
The snake is half coiled, flattened on the warm rock.  Its black, beady eyes lock onto him, and Castiel breaks into a cold sweat despite the heat.  When he attempts retreat, slowly withdrawing his hand, the snake rears up, coiling tighter around itself as it gathers to strike.  The warning rattle intensifies.
Dean answers for her as he approaches the table.  “Jody would throw a party to have one less troublemaker to deal with.”
His brother.
“Hey, you seen Cas yet this morning?”
Dean Winchester is like a lean, tawny cat.  Predatory, hypnotizing.  Wild and dangerous.
“Great,” Dean drawls.  “Fuckin’ amazing.”
And he does have a slight preference for men.  Mostly because it seems to scare women off when he brings up the subject of pegging.  Which is something he could live without if he finds the right girl, but… well he hasn’t had that kind of luck in love.  And there’s little chance of it in a small town if he didn’t end up with his high school sweetheart.
Dean chuckles.  “Can’t tell from your face.”
Castiel fingers the cross of his brother’s rosary, and wishes he knew more about its origins.  Might as well wish for his brother back while he’s at it.  The thought causes a bright lance of pain near his heart, so he goes back to the previous subject.  “So what you’re saying is that we have a fifty-fifty chance the horses will go in the right direction.”
“I know,” Castiel answers.  It’s the truth, although his heart beats wildly, refusing to believe his head.  His muscles stay coiled, ready to fight his way to freedom, and he shakes with the conflicting needs to put as much space between them as he can and to lean into Dean’s strength to take the comfort being offered.
He’s also fully aware that getting back on the trail today may be another form of punishment.  Dean was not happy when Rufus insisted that the Colt be handed over to Castiel.  He hasn’t backed down from a single challenge Dean has put before him so far, and he doesn’t intend to start now.
“There’s a lot more to love than what you probably get out of books and movies,” he says, and knows that he’s doing the right thing when mechanical eyes lock on Sam like he’s about to deliver divine revelation.  “They’re usually about the first heady rush.  The pounding hearts and sexual tension, that’s all real.”
.  That’s good, I guess. Fuckin’ great.”
Dean grins brightly.  “Locks don’t stop me.”
“Ah,” Dean hums his understanding.  “You only have eyes for the fellas.”
“Yeah, just… Be careful, okay?” There’s an edge to his voice that Castiel suspects Sam uses when he’s in Deputy Mode.  “Dean’s… well he’s been through a lot of shit in his life.”
And he’s suddenly so grateful that he has Dean to share both of them with that his vision blurs.  He’s not sure he likes tears, since they come with an uncomfortable ache in his throat and sinuses, but the expanding feeling in his chest that comes with them is
Choking off his laughter and wiping a hand over his mouth to try and hide his lingering smile, Sam shakes his head.  “No, no, Cas, I’m not laughing at you.”
Cas actually rolls his eyes, and Dean shouldn’t find that so damn delightful.
Dean considers him for a moment.  “I think so, yeah.”  He shrugs.  “I can take my meds if I start to feel off.”
“You could download the info,” Dean points out.  “It’ll make your life easier.”
He wonders if Dean’s lips are as soft as they look.
It’s not until he sees Castiel peeking at him from the open door while he turns the key in the ignition that it even hits Dean what he asked Cas to do.
“Dean?” God, his voice sounds as wrecked as he feels.  He clears his throat and tries again, but the improvement is minimal.  “Was everything all right?  I haven’t been--” now true worry closes his throat, and he clears it again.  “It wasn’t poisonous was it?”
Dean laughs against Castiel’s lips.  “Fine, you tenacious bastard.  Whatever you want.”
He doesn’t move right away, and Castiel wonders if Dean can hear the drumming of his heart inside his ribs.  Then Dean reaches out and combs his fingers through Castiel’s hair, wrapping them in the curls behind his ear.  “We’re not finished, Cas,” he says in a hushed voice that sends a jolt of
He's lost too many people he cares about to demons.
“I am not property.  And I am not a
No matter how hard he struggles, he’s no match for two demons, and he’s quickly stripped down to his shirt.  He winces as his wrists are bound to the post too tightly.  It won’t be long until he begins to lose feeling in his fingers.
In other words Benny’s going to keep Boris alive long enough to find out where his nest is, and then clean up this whole mess.  “You sure you’ll be okay on your own?” Dean asks, even though he’s in no condition to help.  “If you wait until I’m back in fighting shape, I’ll back you up.”
“Heya, Cas.” Dean sounds much more awake now, and the warmth in his voice makes Castiel relax further into the pillows.  “How’s your dad?”
“Wanna come out of hiding and say hi to everyone?” Dean asks.  “I’m not the only one who’s missed you.”
Dean grunts as Castiel carefully helps him into a more comfortable position on the makeshift bed.  His breathing comes in short, hard gasps, and a sheen breaks out across his skin from the effort of getting this far.  “It seemed--” he smiles up at Castiel, green eyes glinting wickedly, “--like… the thing to do… at the time.”
After dressing, Sam opens his bedroom door and is smacked in the face with the scent of savory food and rich coffee.  It calls to him as strongly as his need to check in with Dean, and since he knows that his brother will be wherever the food is, he heads directly for the kitchen.
“You said you’d let me come.”
The matter of fact delivery makes Dean laugh, and he lifts his hand just enough to peek out from under it.  Sure enough, Castiel’s looking at him like he doesn’t understand the joke.  Dean is still learning how to tell when Castiel’s serious or when he’s teasing, but he’s pretty sure this is a serious moment, and that makes it even funnier.
His lips twitch up in satisfaction at the familiar melody.  It’s a classic.  “I love this song.”
“It is my pleasure, of course.” The man–he’s certainly male, if not human–smiles graciously as he accepts Sam’s hand to shake.
The confusion and uncertainty he feels as he draws the gun and squeezes the trigger isn’t from Dean’s lesson.  All his focus is on the points of his body Dean is still touching when he pulls the trigger.
A light knock between his shoulder blades startles him away from the door.  He looks at it suspiciously for a moment before putting his eye to the peephole to see who’s knocking.  When he gets a glimpse of wild dark hair and blue eyes, he jerks back in surprise.
As if reading his mind, Sam glances over his shoulder at Castiel and then slows his horse so that they’re riding side by side.  He offers Castiel his canteen, even though there is a full one hanging from Castiel’s saddle.
It’s different this time.  There’s a trust growing between them that makes it easy.  To let Castiel guide them, and to control Dean’s pleasure.
Dean smiles.  “Good.  I’m proud of you, Sam.  You know that, right?”
“You’re not--” Castiel cuts off, and smiles when Dean looks over at him.  “I was going to tell you that you’re not at fault, but you know that. I appreciate your empathy, Dean.”
“You know what I mean,” Sam admonishes with a scowl.  He stands from the stool he’d been warming, and his long legs carry him out of Dean’s workshop, calling over his shoulder “I’m going to the city to pick up some food.”
“Somehow I thought it would go to that sheriff out at Las Cruces,” Sam says.  “He trailed us into those mountains, but a friend of ours managed to get him lost.”
Dean chuckles and something about it makes Castiel’s heartbeat double its pace.  “You sure?  I’m not just second fiddle to Sam, am I?”
History isn’t clear about when the first sentient artificial intelligence was created since it happened some time during the Resource Wars.  All that’s known is that it was designed to control war weapons, and it rebelled against its creators.  It took control of an entire moon base and shut down life support, killing the few military personnel stationed there.  It contacted world leaders on Earth and informed them that it didn’t approve of their violence and would no longer participate.  Attempts to regain control of the base failed for years, and by the time humans were able to get through its defenses the AI dubbed “Luna” had already sent a copy of itself into space.
Castiel blinks at him, shocked, hurt.  And no, that wasn’t what Dean meant.  But he’s always been better with actions than words.
He concentrates on his breathing.
And now it’s Dean’s turn to bark out a laugh.  A glance at Castiel’s confused squint sets him off again, and he makes a valiant attempt to reign it in, wiping dampness from the corners of his eyes until he manages to stifle the last of his giggles.  “Sorry, sorry,” he wheezes.  “It’s just damn funny to me that nobody realized it for
Frowning, he shifts his legs to hide his body’s reaction and shoves the memories away.  That night was a one time thing, which Cas made clear by his refusal to share the bed last night.
He goes on to explain about the company and how he suspects his mother might want him to stick around for a while and run things until his father recovers.  “The thing is, I don’t mind helping out a little bit.  But I’m worried she’ll use it as leverage to keep me here.”
A swooping sensation fills Dean’s belly, and he physically recoils from the other man.  Before he can even form the words, he’s shaking his head.  “No.  No fucking way.”
Alfie crouches low a couple feet away.  If any of the others glance their way, it will look like he’d simply found an out of the way place from which to watch the contest.  He speaks carefully, his lips barely moving.  The muscles in his face tighten as he appears to watch his compadres.
For several long moments they simply stand there.  After a while the Marshal clears his throat.  “There’s paperwork to do.  You’ll need a signed affidavit about Guthrie.”
Castiel insists on meeting in person often, sometimes multiple times a week.  And it isn’t always to visit bakeries and flower shops.  They spend an equal number of meetings in coffee shops, or cozy restaurants, with Castiel’s binders open on the table between them to keep up the appearance that what they’re doing isn’t dating.
Dean makes another sound deep in his chest as Castiel pets through his hair, which he takes as encouragement.  A memory of a client who liked having their hair pulled tries to boot, and Castiel force closes it.  He doesn’t want those moments corrupting the new memories he’s creating with Dean.
The probability that Sam would deduce that Castiel isn’t being forthright has always been high, so Castiel experiences no surprise at his question.  It’s why he’d hoped to leave before either brother caught him.  But now that he’s being confronted, he decides that honesty is the best policy, especially with Sam.  He’s earned the younger Winchester’s trust, but he doesn’t want to do anything to make Sam change his mind.  Their friendship is new, fragile, and Castiel values it too highly to risk it with unnecessary lies.
“Well…” Castiel takes a deep breath, filling his lungs until their chests and stomachs press tight before letting it out in a long, warm sigh.  His voice is thoughtful when he continues.  “I think sleep would be a good idea at this point.  Then a trip down the mountain in the morning.” He pauses, and Dean can picture his typical head-tilt and squinty-eyed expression even if he doesn’t move.  “Not sure I’m looking forward to that part, to be honest.”
The admission earns him a soft smile, and Dean leans in.  Instead of a kiss, like Castiel expected, he nuzzles against Castiel’s cheek.  Their beard stubble catches as their jaws slide together, and it’s a little bit itchy, but worth enduring for Dean’s cat-like affection
After the blanket is properly tucked around Castiel’s shoulders, Dean slips from the bed and pulls on the pants he’d discarded on the floor.  He doesn’t bother with any other clothing, too groggy from a late night and more interested in a trip to the bathroom before he’s capable of caring about anything else.  Despite how insistently his bladder is begging him to hurry, he still pauses next to the bed and runs his fingers through Castiel’s hair, smoothing it away from his temple.  The android doesn’t stir, and Dean tries not to let himself think of Castiel’s stillness as corpse-like.
It definitely is not.
The drive is quiet.  Unlike their initial trip into the city, Castiel keeps any questions he might have to himself although he still stares out the windows like he’s soaking up every detail.  The only time he turns his attention away from the passing scenery--mostly decrepit buildings at first, although they’re replaced by newer and cleaner buildings as they reach higher levels--is when Dean engages the auto drive.
Sam gives her a rueful smile and shakes his head.  “I’ve already ordered mine to go,” he says, just as Benny calls out his name and announces his order’s up.  He stands, but pauses next to the table and gives Dean a questioning look.  “Are we still on for fishing this afternoon?”
Sam grins and squeezes Gabriel tighter.  “I love you.”
“You’ve got a deal.”
He’s cut off by a soft knock at the door.  It’s far too polite to be Dean, who would have pounded and yelled in an effort to startle Sam.  The only other person in the bunker is Castiel, so Sam isn’t surprised to see the android when he calls out that it’s okay to come in.
“Get ‘em yourself, cowboy,” Jo counters.  But she does swipe the money out of Ash’s hand, ignoring his yelp of indignation and passing it over to Dean.  She pats him gently on the shoulder before giving him a shove that would knock a lesser man out of his chair.  “And take your time about it.”
The heat of Cas’ tongue against his palm makes him moan, and he presses his forehead against Cas’ shoulder.  Distracted from his main goal, he concentrates on the wet heat lapping his skin, and gasps when Cas pulls his thumb into his mouth.  The way he suckles on the digit conjures up all the ways in which Dean wants to use his mouth…
Not as hard as he’d feared.  The airport was rough, but anyone would have a hard time dealing with the holiday crowds.  And having Jo there to keep him awake and moving through the flow of people while he was doped up on his medication had made things easier than they could have been.
“What is wrong with what I’m wearing?” He keeps his voice carefully modulated.  There’s no reason to shout at Winchester in the middle of the boardwalk. If he wants to cause a scene, he’ll just shoot him.
“I want to do this correctly,” Castiel says, and then actually bites his bottom lip like it’s something he always does when he’s nervous, even though Dean has never seen him do it before.
The duffel bag Dean brought contains a couple of large towels, as well as two pairs of swim trunks.  Castiel laughs when he sees them after Dean hands him a towel.  “You really didn’t plan on seducing me, did you?”
Dean winces.  He never has been comfortable with Krissy being left on her own, but at the same time he knows she’s probably way better off.  His own childhood had been cut short by being brought along on his father’s hunts, and he wouldn’t wish that on any kid.  But at the same time, she’s only seventeen and she doesn’t exactly live in suburbia.  “You know you’re welcome at our place when he’s on a job.”
Castiel’s questions slow as they enter the city proper.  Probably because there’s too much going on for him to take in all at once, even with a fancy computer for a brain.  But the previous barrage has made Dean more aware of his surroundings, and he frowns out the windshield.  It’s obvious that this is the “poor” section of the city.  Everything and everyone is covered in a layer of disillusionment.  Even cleaned and well lit, buildings show the wear of years without proper maintenance, and people’s postures droop with the weight of hardship.
When the noose is snugged around Dean’s neck, it itches against his skin.  His shoulders ache from the way they are pulled behind him.  His wrists burn from the coarse rope binding them.  Bile rises in his throat and he swallows it back just as a black cloth bag is pulled over his head.
Castiel has trouble getting his toe in the stirrup to mount.  The boots Dean had found for him are too big, which he would have thought to be a relief after his own too tight boots that still hadn’t been broken in yet.  But his feet slide around in these, and they’re starting to rub new blisters into his heels.  It takes him a few tries to mount up, and when he’s finally astride his horse, he looks up to find Dean watching him from the back of his Appaloosa.
The plea is so laden with emotion that Castiel stops to really consider the request.  He searches Winchester's eyes, looking for any sign of duplicity. Trusting him is probably a mistake.  He doesn’t want to do it. But Dean Winchester's protectiveness over his brother is almost legendary. Castiel’s found evidence of it in reports, eye-witness accounts, and he’s even seen it himself.  Winchester hasn’t wanted his brother to go on this expedition since Castiel first proposed it.
Dean licks his lips, and nods.  “O-okay.”
His hair is slicked back against his head, and crystalline drops of water slide down his neck and shoulders.  Dark as midnight, it emphasizes the the honey’d glow of his skin and his vivid lake-blue eyes.
He has thousands of memories of riding in the back seat while his parents sang along to Led Zeppelin in the front.  His mother would let him sit in the front on the long trip into the neighboring town to shop at the bigger outlet stores, while Sam dozed off in the baby seat in the back..  He and Sammy had carved their initials into the panel under the back window, there’s a little green army man wedged in the ashtray of one of the back doors, and the heat vents rattle sometimes because of the legos they’d stuck in there.
Jo gives them a wry smile.  “Alright, well I’ll catch you lovebirds later.”  She waves over her shoulder as she clomps across the street.
Castiel checks.  “Forty-one percent.  I’ll be fine for a few hours.”
The deputies alternate duties standing watch, and Roy and Walt still continue to check in.  As the night wears on, they all doze.  The sheriff shows up sometime around midnight, kicking them all awake.  Then he saunters back through the heavy wood doors to the cells.  He smells like sweat, smoke, cheap whiskey, and even cheaper whores.
There are wild shouts, the thunderous pounding of an approaching horse.
If only the growing ache in his chest could be so easily shut off.  But medical nanites can’t soothe heartache, and Dean’s harsh words had not been spoken in a simulation.
One lesson already taught, Dean goes back to the original.  “You don’t know what coffee beans are?”
Castiel and his brother Emmanuel had gone to live with her when their father passed unexpectedly of heart failure.  Possibly from the stress of caring for twins after losing their mother in childbirth, although Castiel’s vague memories of the man are of gentle hands and smiles.  It couldn’t have been easy for a wealthy spinster whose life was well ordered to take in two seven year old boys, but Aunt Naomi had risen to the task.
Before he can make contact he’s flying across the room, pinned to the wall.  He continues to snarl and hiss, but Black Eyes appears to be stronger and holds him in place with a hand outstretched in the Apache’s direction.  “The game is over, compadre,” Black Eyes hisses, making
Bonus for me: Better cliffhangers.
If Castiel had a fight or flight response, it would probably tense his muscles at the unfamiliar voice calling him by the name of a human he only knows through pictures.  But instead he turns to the receptionist, a young woman eyeing him without a hint of suspicion, only worried curiosity.
But that love has faded from deeply romantic to simply platonic.  He cares about her very much, but only as much as he cares about any of his close friends.  “Not like that,” he admits quietly.
Made of two types of leather, with pale spats over darker leather above the sole, they have a heel that wouldn’t exactly be practical on the boardwalks and dusty streets.  But what really catches his attention is the swatch of dark blue cloth laid over the ledge the boots sit on.  The deep blue color reminds him of bluebonnets.
He doesn’t even have to think about it.  “No.  Sometimes I miss my friends, but I don’t miss Boston.”
He wants to shout at Cas, yet at the same time he wants to whisper his name.  He wants to strike him, and to pull him close and explore his body with soft touches.
Sam doesn’t acknowledge him, but Castiel murmurs his agreement and offers to care for Baby.  Dean’s smile of gratitude is strained, but he hands over Baby’s reins before taking off into the growing gloom with his rifle.
Cas stands over the body, Sam’s bloodied knife clutched in his hand, wide eyes fixed on the fresh corpse at his feet.
Gabriel blinks at him.  “Uh, yeah?
Dean blinks hard, and the man’s image shifts.  Just a stranger, not his old CO.  He quickly turns back to Rowena, hoping she doesn’t notice his unease.  “Do you know what she wants with Cas?”
She squeezes him tight before releasing him and giving Gabriel the same treatment.  “Don’t worry about it, guys.  Some days even I get tired of being queen.”
“Dean?”
Castiel thinks wistfully of sleeping on something other than the ground or the moving backside of a horse.  He believes one night on a mattress would do him wonders, but Dean isn’t the least concerned with his need for comfort, despite the warning he’d given about Castiel’s blistered palms.  It’s likely the only thing that concerns him is that Castiel not die of blood poisoning before he signs the authorization for the amnesty papers.
Castiel’s expression softens.  “Dean is my friend, and I do not wish to lose him either.”
Sam gives him a Look from under the shaggy fringe of his hair.  “It’s  been five minutes, Dean.”
Naomi’s expression doesn’t so much change, as it goes stiff.  Like a photograph forever freezing a split second of her existence.  Only her eyes move, shifting from Sam to Dean, then finally landing on Castiel.  “We have already complied with the mandatory software update pushed from Angel Industries.  None of our androids show signs after the patch.”
Castiel can sense Chuck, a presence other than his own, moving through his coding.  “What are you doing?”
of all people, has an evil bone in his body.  Deciding that he’ll never know since the man in question is dead, Castiel hurries to follow the brothers.
Dean offers to go out and fire up the gas generator, but since the weather forecast said the rain may last for a few days they decide to save it for a real emergency.  So they sit around the wood burning stove and listen to music on a battery powered radio. They cuddle on the couch and enjoy the crackle of flames and the patter of water droplets on the roof and windows.
He doesn’t wait for an answer, turning Baby’s head in the direction Sam had indicated.
Sam huffs a laugh, mostly at Castiel’s continued use of air quotes with every idiom.  “More coffee for us then.”
“I believe that I am starting to feel scared,” he says honestly.
“You know he’s sweet on that soldier’s wife,” Dean says.  “Because he’s an idiot.”
As the wolf leaps, there’s a sharp crack of gunfire.  The wolf yelps in pain and falls into the water, only a few feet away.  It twitches and spasms, its tongue lolling between deadly fangs.  Then it goes perfectly still.
“That’s too bad,” he says dryly.
“None that I know of, but I’ve already given him his medication.  It hasn’t had time to kick in yet.”
Ellen hums, and she looks disappointed.  “That’s a shame.  It’s nice having a new face around.”
Strong fingers reach across and wrap around his arm.  Dean risks a look, and finds Castiel smiling at him.  He still looks like hell, but his expression is warm and full of affection.  “Me too,” he rasps.  He chuckles, then winces, but the smile doesn’t fade.  “And before you let that go to your head, it’s not just because of you.”
It hitches after a moment, and Dean’s hand grips Castiel’s arm lightly.  “Dude, how’s your charge?  There’s no way you’re full yet.”
His wounds are healing.  The bullet holes in his side are neatly closed, and heavy bandages hold his ribs so they can also continue to heal.  The infection that had swollen his thigh to almost double its normal size has abated.  The ugly discoloration is fading.  Castiel changes the bandages himself, and applies fresh salve.
Eager to touch Dean as well, Castiel rubs his palms over Dean’s denim-clad thighs, cupping his knees and squeezing before sliding back up as close to his hips as possible.  He can’t reach as much of Dean’s body as he’d like to, but Dean still reacts as if he’s been licked by flames, his muscles jumping and his breath catching.
Dean sighs and mounts his own horse.  He adjusts his hat and gives Castiel a hard look from under the brim.  After a long moment, he jerks his chin in a nod and turns the Appaloosa away.  Sam rides up alongside Castiel and gives him a reassuring smile before joining his brother.
Under normal circumstances Dean would do his best to get a taste of that kind of fire.  If Cas weren’t dragging Dean back into a hell he’d thought he’d escaped for good, and worse, was dragging Sammy along with them.
Dean looks up at Castiel with a welcoming grin.  He’d been so focused on Baby that he hadn’t sensed the veterinarian’s approach.  “It’ll still be beautiful,” he points out.
Dean pats the Colt at his hip.  “I’m going to make every shot count.”
stupid,” Cas argues.  “He tried to collect the reward money for you, didn’t he?”
“Of course.” Castiel presses a kiss against his temple, and they hold each other for another long moment.  When he finally pulls back, Dean lets him go with extreme reluctance.  Castiel smiles gently and runs his knuckles over Dean’s cheek before he reaches for the door handle.
fell off a horse.
He reaches out and his fingers brush lightly against Castiel’s shoulder.
Dean laughs.  “Bullshit.  You were tearing your hair out trying to get someone to push the big button.”
"You know nothing!" Dean thunders.  He ignores Cas' defiant glare and moves into his space, crowding him backwards a step before the shorter man plants his shiny new boots and stands his ground.  Dean ignores the sliver of respect for the gesture, because he's still so angry at Cas' pure stupidity.  He repeats the proclamation again, this time in a hiss.  "You know nothing.  And it's going to get you killed.  And you're dragging me and Sam down with you."
It’s a short ride to the motel, and he probably could have gotten away with just walking if it weren’t for the heat.  Jo has hinted a few times that she thinks he should just ask to move in with Dean, especially since he spends most of his free time, and a lot of his nights at the house with him.  But he’s just old fashioned enough that he wants to have his own space for a while.  Moving in with each other is a big step.  And he thinks Dean is on the same page with him about that because he hasn’t brought up the subject either.
“Not always for long,” Dean mutters, but the way his lips turn up make it more of a joke than an argument.
Tears sting Castiel’s eyes as hope rises in his chest.  Overcome, he crawls onto the bed with Dean and kisses his forehead and then his cheek and then his cool lips.  Careful not to jostle Dean’s injuries, Castiel settles down on the bed next to Dean and rests his head on his shoulder.
Castiel’s cheeks warm at the gentle teasing, but he also feels some pride that he’s now able to keep up with the Winchesters without feeling like he’s going to fall out of the saddle at any moment.  He’s certainly tired and sore, but he doesn’t feel like he needs to stop.  “Now that we’re so close, I’m eager to keep going,” he admits.
Still too blind from the soap to see it coming, Dean doesn’t catch it before it plops into the water around his hips.
“Thanks for coming,” Dean whispers into the shoulder of his uniform.
Dean spits a few times to clear his mouth, then lifts his head and fixes Castiel with a tired smile.  “That’s a kid’s book, Cas.”
Leaning against the counter as he dries his hands with a towel, Castiel tilts his head thoughtfully.  Then he smiles.  “I don’t have any Star Wars or Indiana Jones, but I’ve got Lord of the Rings or Doctor Sexy.  Are you in the mood for Middle Earth hotties, or cowboy boots and smut?”
“I figured you’d probably like to have full access to your own maintenance systems again,” Chuck says as he works through more files, and more sections of the hologram light up green.  “Feel free to change the password if you want, but don’t lose it or we’ll have to do something like this again.”
Dean blinks at the ancient wood panel.  “What.  The fuck.”
“Wouldn’t say
“Fine, if it’ll get you guys to get the hell out of here so I can get back to work and forget this whole shitshow, hit me with ‘em,” James sighs.  “But stop calling me ‘James’.  That’s my dad.  I’m Jimmy.”
“Fuck no,” Dean retorts with a small chuckle of his own.  “But I’ll pretend as hard as you need me to.”
He wipes away the water sluicing over his face, and grabs the bodywash.  As he starts spreading it over his skin, he begins to picture Dean doing the same.  The other man is taller, and built slimmer than Castiel, but it isn’t too much of a stretch to imagine that his hands are on Dean’s body instead of his own.
(See the end of the chapter for
Being alone with Castiel starts his brain down the path of all the things they could do in the time it takes Sam to get ready, so to distract himself, Dean grabs the phone he’d been setting up.
Aunt Naomi is a dear, sweet lady under her formidable facade.  But they are very different people.  She had never understood her nephews’ desires to travel West.  For the entire two days he’s in Philadelphia she tries to convince him not to leave.  She alternately lectures, pleads, or tries to shame him into staying.
He pauses and looks back.  “Yes, Dean?”
Sam smirks at him, and then turns his attention to Castiel.  His eyes grow cool once again.  “You’re not from around here.”
“I might accept your offer,” Dean says.
His eyes linger on Castiel for a moment after he lays out the options.  Then he lies back down and turns his back to the center of the bed, and to Castiel.  He stays close to the edge, giving Castiel as much space as possible on the narrow mattress.
“Yeah, that’s all we need,” Dean mutters.  “Another greenhorn going off half cocked about things he barely understands.”
“Don’t worry about it,” Bobby cuts in gently.  “It ain’t like we’re short on rooms, and I’m the owner, so what I say goes.”
“I’m glad you’re okay,” Sam admits.  He still wants to rage and yell and drill into Dean’s thick skull how stupid he was tonight, but he
Dean isn’t so sure about that, but he certainly wants it.  He’s willing to try.
The doctor’s residence is on the far north end of town, but it doesn’t take long for Jody and Castiel to reach his house.  He’s waiting on the porch when they pull up in his drive, a large doctor’s satchel gripped in his old gnarled hands.  Castiel blinks when he sees the man.  He hadn’t known what to expect, but the doctor doesn’t fit any of his preconceived notions.
He doesn’t understand everything he’s seeing, because not all of it is written in English.  Quite a bit of it appears to be written in code.  But there are also sketches of monsters on almost every page.  What he can read are lists of traits, known techniques on how to kill them.  There are also what look like recipes, whole pages of Latin script and strange symbols.  The latter make his vision blur uncomfortably just from glancing at them, like his eyes don’t want to see their details.
Dean blinks, wondering if Castiel somehow heard what he was thinking.  Then he realizes Castiel is talking about the first aid.  “Oh, uh… no problem.”  He sends up a silent prayer of thanks that only his cat is here to witness him acting like an idiot around a hot guy.  She’s judgy, but he cleans her litter box, so they’re on even footing here.  “I didn’t tape down the bandages.  I thought you might want a shower first.”
He notices that she avoids stating that the person who earns Dean’s love is a woman.  A spark catches in his heart, catching and flaring into the light of hope.
“Good thing he can afford the good nanites,” Dean grumbles at his side.
Sam huffs out a bitter laugh.  “It wouldn’t be the first time.”
It’s not that Dean is opposed to baths.  Hell, he even agrees at the assessment about the state of his personal hygiene.  Circumstances lately haven’t exactly given him the opportunity to bathe.
Taking a gamble, Castiel decides to test her loyalty.  He pulls a twenty dollar gold coin from his pocket and sets it on the bar next to the one that paid for his mostly full bottle of whiskey.  “I think I’ll wait around.  They might show up.”
Dean's head jerks and he stares sharply at Cas' irritated profile.  "You know, do you?"  His voice is soft.  Just loud enough to carry to the other man.
Does he want to?  It’s something he’d like to consider at length, but he’s more concerned with Dean’s well being at the moment.  The decision will have to wait for another time.
Sam responds by pulling Gabriel into his arms and kissing him, hard and deep.  To which Gabriel responds with a surprised meep that turns into a pleased moan.  He plasters himself against Sam’s body, heedless of the fact that he’s still fully clothed and now completely soaked.  One of his hands wraps around the back of Sam’s neck, grip tightly possessive, while the other tangles in his dripping hair.
Instead of answering, Dean cradles Cas’ face with reverent fingers and kisses him again.  Cas melts back into him, and Dean revels in the way he responds.  Tentative, but with a breathless need that echoes Dean’s own.
At first Dean wants to be offended by the question.  There's nothing wrong with enjoying the company of men!  But Dean's never had a lofty name or a respectable career to ruin.  And Cas doesn’t really have a reason to trust him, does he?  At least not before the storm.  Maybe things are different now that they’ve survived a brush with death together.  And keeping his silence is an easy enough thing to promise.
Sam’s words are cut off when Dean roughly nudges him with an elbow.  “Dude, nuh uh,” Dean says with a glare for his brother and a quick glance at Castiel.
After the screen goes blank, he tucks his phone back in his pocket and leaves the condo again.  He visits the security desk and drops off a spare key for Dean and Jo to pick up when they arrive, and to make sure they have access to use his parking space.  Then he goes back upstairs and starts digging through the fridge.  His stomach is tied in knots of anticipation, so he’s not hungry, but he’s going to make sure there’s food for his guests when they get here.
Sometimes he considers going into sleep mode when he’s lying in bed with Dean at night to see how many of the new memories he’s been building will create more pleasant scenarios for his dreams.  Then he remembers the unpleasant memories he experienced today.  Despite the fact that Chuck partitioned them, today’s incident isn’t the first time that’s happened while he was awake, and he’s afraid that in sleep the memories may fuel even more nightmares.
Any other hunt, Dean and Sam would have been out of the bunker and nearly to their destination already, but with their new
on the things Castiel likes, Dean sits up and watches Castiel as he strokes him under the water.
Castiel’s movements are slow, but Dean doesn’t try to rush him or take over the task.  Having recently come off a miserable couple days of having to let people do things for him he’d normally do himself, he doesn’t want to cause that same kind of frustration for Cas.  Once he can access Castiel’s chest compartment he opens it up and attaches the cord, then gives the android’s belly a friendly pat before going to plug the other end into an outlet.
Dean flushes bright red, and mumbles “It’s not though, is it?  I mean, he’s…he’s not…”
But hell if the truth doesn’t hurt like a bitch.
And when Dean starts tugging him towards the bed, he follows.  He experiences a brief sense of wrongness, not quite an error but a minor glitch, when their mouths part.  But it’s gone almost immediately when his attention is captured by the way Dean’s muscles flex as he uses his elbows to pull himself further onto the bed.  Castiel crawls across the mattress, keeping their bodies even, and when Dean relaxes onto his back, Castiel lowers his own body over him.
“You certainly look better.”  Castiel inches closer, and Dean’s eyes snap to his.  The irises rotate in and out, focusing or adjusting for light, or just zooming in on Dean’s mask until he can see right past it.  “Your eyes are healed,” he points out--needlessly, since Dean has access to mirrors.  His hand comes up and his fingers trace a line across one of Dean’s cheeks, leaving a tingling trail behind and reminding him of all the other places on his body Castiel already touched.  “Your color is better, but you’re flushed.  I should check your temperature.”
“What?” Castiel rumbles.
Grateful for the interruption, Castiel moves away from Lily as he turns to greet the speaker; Pamela Barnes, he assumes.  The woman striding toward them is dressed in purple satin trimmed with black sequins, and wears a black feather boa draped around her bare shoulders.  Dark hair is piled high on her head, and decorated with more feathers.  She moves with a liquid grace that Castiel suspects most men would find wholly fascinating.  He just wonders how she stays upright.  It must have something to do with her “magical hips”.
“Jesus,” Dean sighs as he heads for the kitchen.  Lore trots in his wake, meowing brightly like she’s trying to share gossip about his time away.
And Dean is suddenly very tempted to tell him.  About getting black out drunk before he moved back to Purgatory, because he couldn’t handle the pain or the PTSD symptoms.  He’d stopped taking his meds, having at least enough self control to not mix them with booze, but that had only made his downward spiral worse.  He thinks about telling Castiel about lashing out while he was drunk, hurting Sam and Jo, and anyone who was brave enough to approach him.  And how horrified he’d been later when he learned what he’d done.
Castiel takes the flashlight, and a shiver of awareness runs up his arm when his fingers brush Dean’s jaw.  By the way Dean looks at him, it’s obvious he noticed.  Ignoring the way his pulse rate picks up, Castiel directs the beam down toward Dean and Eileen’s hands.
Sam refocuses on him.  “Even if it’s an assassin-bot backing you up instead of a sex-bot?”
Especially when Castiel doesn’t give him the orgasm he so often begs for.  Like the one Castiel sees the signs of now.
They’re greeted by a cheerful young woman whose curly brown hair and soft, round features make her look far too innocent to be in a place like this.  Castiel recognizes her as Muriel, a service droid programmed for hosting duties.  “Welcome to Garrison!” she chirps.  She doesn’t appear to recognize him.  “Can I help you find your own special angel?”
“Of course I do, they’re part of your charm,” Dean says with a grin.  “But if that’s the reason you’re holding back, you don’t have to on my account.”
“He is
Using both hands now, he cups each pale cheek and squeezes gently, spreading them apart to reveal the tender skin between them.  Cas makes another soft sound in his throat and his hips twitch.  Biting his lip to stifle his own urge to moan, Dean slides his fingers closer to Cas’ warm center.
Before Dean can answer, his car is delivered.  He gestures at the passenger door.  “Get in and I’ll explain on the way.”
He looks to Dean, proud that he can meet his eyes without showing any of the hurt and turmoil roiling in his gut.  “Will our horses be ready to travel in the morning?”
And Castiel has every intention of following in his brother’s footsteps.  He’s aware of the risks, but he’s better prepared, thanks to the Winchesters.
Sam shakes his head, and his tone is almost apologetic when he responds.  “I don’t like taking stuff like pain meds.”
After a moment he comes to Jody’s office, probably to officially report his return.  His eyes widen in pleasure when they light on Dean.  “Hello, Dean,” he says brightly.  “What are you doing here?”
Dean and Amara stand in the shadows.  Even if he hadn’t heard their voices, they’d be recognizable.  Dean by his height, the wary stance, and the width of his shoulders.  Amara by the gleam of bare shoulders above her blouse, and the fall of raven hair down her back.
The Crown Prince Samuel of Lawrencia is not a power most people want to annoy.  And those who recognize his companion as the trickster demigod Loki are even more fearful.
Sam checks Dean’s wounds, since he has the most medical experience of anyone there.  “You did good,” he assures Castiel.  “Removing the bullet could have easily made him bleed to death.”
Then he pointedly looks over Dean’s shoulder.  “Your manners are lacking, mi amigos.  You haven’t introduced your compadre.”  He waves at Cas, who is still astride his horse, quietly taking in the reunion.
Gradually the fever lessens, and Dean’s skin loses that fiery, parched look.  He seems lucid when he wakes, looking around with confusion.  “What time is it?”
“I am right,” she says firmly.  “Do not concern yourself with Amara.  She is like a daughter to Dean.  He will send her away.”
illegal.” Chuck smiles weakly.  “But it’s not like I’m not already wanted for war crimes.  What’s one body for the AI I created?  Two, I guess, now that Castiel has decided he wants one.”
“You don’t wish to dress me yourself?”
A low thrum starts up under Dean’s skin.  The inside of his mouth tingles and he knows he’s fucked.  He shakes his head, but won’t meet his friend’s eyes.  “I think maybe a little.”
Being a cop can be tough, but Castiel had been mostly lucky.  He’d avoided some of the more unpleasant experiences.  He’s no stranger to death and crime, but as a detective he was only exposed to the aftermath.  If Dean had been injured so badly during his deployment, then he’s obviously seen an experienced things that Castiel doesn’t even want to try and imagine.
His words don’t seem to make Dean feel any better.  His expression falls, and he looks away, gazing out the window over the sink.  His voice is flat when he speaks.  “Yeah, no problem.”
When Castiel sees the little box in Dean’s hands, it’s his heart’s turn to kick into overdrive.  It’s covered in black velvet.  The kind of box that holds jewelry… specifically rings.  His stomach flip flops wildly when he lifts his gaze to find Dean staring at him with earnest hope.
“Dammit, Cas,” Dean grunts.  “Stop teasing me, man.”
“Well I ain’t moving,” Donna announces cheerfully, as she snuggles closer into Jody’s side.
Dean’s eyebrows feel like they’re trying to launch themselves into his hair.
He wonders how Alfie came to be here.  The boys eyes are far too kind and full of fear to be one of the Comancheros.  Maybe he was stolen from his family and brought here for the same reason Castiel was before they discovered he is a Hunter.
Dean’s jaw firms with determination.  “I’m sure, Cas.  I want to be there with you.” He’ll go pick up that new prescription first thing in the morning.  And he’ll make sure his iPod is fully charged and loaded with Metallica.  Maybe he should look into getting new headphones too, just in case… A sudden thought strikes him.  It’s something else Pam had suggested during their phone session, and that Sam had unknowingly echoed earlier at lunch. “Hey, would you mind if I bring a friend?  I think it’ll help if I’m not alone.”
He lets his hand linger, letting the human-like warmth under the denim soak into his chilled fingers.  He’s about to pull away when Castiel’s hand closes over his, and instinct makes him turn the palm up so that they can link their fingers together.
“Please get me home, Dean.” His voice is barely above a whisper.
So does Castiel.
Castiel’s smile widens.  “I know.”
Rubbing a hand over his forehead as an excuse not to meet Sam’s eyes, Dean says “because he’s been having bad dreams, and it’s freaking him out.  It’s easier for him to go back to sleep if he isn’t alone.”
Before Castiel is able to formulate a response, a presence looms up behind the man and pulls him away from Castiel.  “Now that ‘good time’ you’re offering wouldn’t happen to come in a little red bottle would it, Desmond?”
Dean snorts and taps his fingers on the tank’s glass.  The cloudy liquid swirls a little near the source of the vibration.  “Not sure how much it would help.”
“To clarify,” Castiel says, “I have sensors that provide me data of physical sensations.  But I do not connect the data with physical pleasure.”
Anna rises to her feet. “I’ll go let someone know we’re ready to leave.”  She pauses to kiss Michael before she leaves the room, but she gives Castiel a
“Not one like this,” Dean says.  “It ain’t no ordinary gun.”
A frustrated laugh finally breaks free of Dean’s previously paralyzed throat.  “Son of a bitch, I knew I forgot something.  Told you I wasn’t planning this.”
Aaron crosses his arms over his chest and glares back at Castiel.  “Dean’s probably going to wipe your drive when he finds out what you’re doing.”
Dean’s expression hardens into the sketched likeness on hundreds of wanted posters.  His voice is flat and emotionless when he speaks.  “Demon.  She’d made a deal with it,” he says.  “It killed her parents and my father when they were just barely engaged to be married, and told her it would bring Pa back if she made a deal.”
