"The team," Iron Man stepped into Steve's personal space. "I think it's time for a change in leadership." Without warning, Iron Man grabbed Captain America by the throat.
"Don't fight me on this, Iron Man. You're all I have left of Tony. Please just let me worry about you, okay?" Rhodes' expression softened.
"Can you two not? Just for tonight, can you not?" Sam pleaded. "Don't you fucking dare." He snarled the second Peter raised his wrist at Sam. Peter lowered his arm.
"I appreciate it. However, there's still the matter of Bruce and Wanda," Steve reminded everyone. "I know you all want Peter back. I do too, but I have a feeling Wanda started the fire. Nothing else could have done so much damage so quickly. Right now, our priority is to find them before they can strike again."
"The suit is already at top speed, sir," Jarvis reported. "It is flying all the way from New York. It will take time."
"Already called him. Besides, we still got Widow on our tail. And I don't know where the other Avengers are!" Wanda called over the roar of their engines.
Later that day Steve spotted Iron Man and Rhodey huddled in the living room, talking amongst themselves in hushed voices. His super-hearing picked up bits of their conversation. He pieced together that Iron Man was planning on doing something that Rhodes strongly disapproved of.
"Go for the web shooters!" Tony called, keeping a safe distance from Peter. FRIDAY sent a spare faceplate zooming across the room. It snapped into place upon arrival, extra parts for the damaged shoulder not far behind.
"Let's go get some lunch. What would you like?" Tony smiled. He started the car only for Peter to reach over and turn off the ignition. Tony gave him a questing look. Peter took a deep, shaky breath before telling Tony everything. Who had hurt him, why and what they had really done to his arms. Every last detail. Even the part about being transported in a dog crate.
"Henry's not hurting anyone," Peter muttered under his breath. He crawled up the wall, sticking his head into the vent. No tarantula.
"Oh, sweetheart..." Steve pulled the bot into his arms. Iron Man clung to him with his remaining arm, pressing his face into Steve's shoulder. "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry." Iron Man's shoulders shook. "Shhh...I got you, shellhead. I got you." Iron Man made a whining noise, followed by a choked clicking. The noise repeated over and over. It took Steve a minute to realize that the sound was the robot's way of crying. Steve felt his heart shatter. "It's gonna be alright. Everything's gonna be okay, Iron Man."
." Iron Man ripped the now useless ropes off his body. Steve winced at the deep cuts they had left in his armor.
"Tony," Natasha was looking at him in a way that Tony couldn't quite describe. She had watched Tony hook the repulsor up to the reactor and had become concerned when she saw the state of the energy source. She moved closer to him and spoke in a voice only he could hear. "You're dying."
"No," Peter said. "I hope you live a long, long painful life, Bruce. I really do." With that, Peter turned on heel and walked back over to his father, allowing the SHIELD agents that had just arrived to swarm around the former Avenger.
One month. Peter had been living with Wanda and Bruce for a solid month. Doc Ock hadn't stopped by recently, although Adrian was often popping by their apartment to check on Peter and bring him gifts. Such as the clothes he was wearing now. And the gun strapped to his hip. He didn't want the gun anywhere near his person, but Adrian had insisted he keep it on him at all times. "Just in case Stark and his merry men show up," he had said.
"We don't know that for sure. Who else would have gassed Peter? The Goblin is the only one of Spider-man's enemies that use Biological weapons," Wanda pointed out.
"I'm not sure...I just know everyone but you guys got out when the fire spread so I came back for you." Rhodey sighed. He cut Steve free and guided the two men outside. The rest of the Avengers were sprawled out on the lawn.
Iron Man flew up a few feet in the air and crashed down into Spider-man's back, flattening him on the floor. He flinched at the sound of Peter crying out in pain. Tony prayed his actions hadn't caused any broken ribs. He took hold of two of the extra spider arms and ripped them off. Steve rushed forward to help. He had a third limb halfway torn when Peter twisted around and punched him in the shin. Hard. Steve fell back, his leg clearly broken. Spider-man made a move to go for Tony's remaining rocket boot. Tony had no choice but to jump back.
“Doesn’t matter anymore. What’s done is done.” Tony hung his head. Steve brought his hand up to hold the side of his face, smiling softly at the way Tony leaned into his touch. It was obvious how touch starved Tony was, with the way he welcomed even the smallest bit of affection. And Steve was more than happy to give it to him. He believed wholeheartedly that Tony deserved to be shown love and affection.
Peter swallowed hard. He vaguely remembered that happening. But at the time he was so wrapped up in grief over the phone call about his aunt that he hadn't been paying attention to the news.
"Yup. C'mere. I'm not going to hurt you," Tony assured him. "I just want to help." Peter slowly crawled towards his father, who wrapped him in a tight hug once he was at arm's length. The symbiote brushed against Tony but didn't latch onto him. "I gotcha, kiddo. Everything's going to be okay now." Peter rested his face against the cold chest plate. The voice in his head had gone quiet.
"Tony?" War Machine leaned over him. Tony relaxed at the sound of his friend's voice. Wait. Was Rhodey still his friend? He didn't try to save Tony. Why was he here now? Must have stumbled upon him by accident. He should have kept flying. No. No, this was a good thing. Rhodey finding him meant that Tony would have someone at his side when he died. Tony allowed himself a weak smile. Of course, Rhodey was still his friend. Of course, he was going to be with Tony when he died. "Jesus...what happened to you, buddy?" War Machine put a hand on his shoulder. Tony couldn't feel it through the armor but he knew it was there.
"I hadn't thought about that part yet. I suppose you can just throw me in a ditch on the side of the road." Tony shrugged. "This bot will be an exact copy of me. There won't be a need for two Iron Men, so you can get rid of the older model. I don't mind."
The dragon hovered a few feet off the ground, with Steve struggling in its hold. It roared as it started to climb higher into the sky. Tony bolted up the side of the hill, kicked off a rock and flinging himself at his friend. He grabbed onto Steve's lower leg, his own legs dangling uselessly below him. The dragon faltered at the sudden extra weight but kept flying. Tony shot a repulsor at the dragon's foot. The beast screeched and struck Tony with its free claws.
"What's this?" Tony pushed his welding mask up over his head. Peter had appeared before him with a plate of cookies.
Bucky and Rhodes exchanged glances. Lockdown could mean one of two things, either there was a serious problem in the workshop, or Tony was out of his suit and didn't want anyone barging in.
"Let's go!" Wanda climbed onto her bike, with Peter getting onto the back of another one. He took a deep breath and gripped the handle bars. In the back of his mind, he knew how to operate a motorcycle, yet he still felt like he was getting on one for the first time. "Calm down, little brother. You've been on one of these before."
Michelle was frozen in terror. Venom now had her pinned under him. His face was just inches from her own. Cold claws brushed against her throat. Venom pulled back his hand to deliver the killing blow.
"Young Stark has returned to a place they call...what was it? Queens? Yes, Queens." Thor finished for him. "So strange, to have a city full of nothing but royalty."
"You are a threat to everyone including yourself!" Bruce called, he must have been on the other side of the room.
you going to do it?" Steve whispered to Tony. Tony glanced over his shoulder at Peter, who was sitting on top of a workbench with Michelle. The two were whispering to each other, their heads leaning against one another. The symbiote had solidified, turning his costume completely black, except for the white of his lenses. It looked like it was trying to form a white spider on his chest, but the design was different each time someone looked at it. Tony had been pacing the lab, gathering supplies for the past hour. Steve was a little concerned that Tony didn't really know what he was doing, considering he kept changing his mind about certain tools and kept asking FRIDAY for a second opinion.
"Go home, Spider-man. Or else..." The Vulture grabbed the closest student in his talons and shot up into the sky. "You'll have this girl's death on your hands!" The girl kicked and screamed, blindly throwing punches at the metal claws.
"One of your own? Cute," it fired the projectile. Iron Man easily dodged, however, the resulting explosion tossed him against a pillar. "You and I are nothing alike." He grabbed Iron Man by the head and slammed him into the hood of a car, setting off the alarm. Iron Man kicked the bot off him and blasted through the hole in the roof. He didn't make it very far before the bot grabbed him by the ankle and yanked him back to the ground. Tony's head banged against the inside of the helmet. It stung, but he refused to make a sound. His comm was still on. He couldn't allow the Avengers to know that Iron Man could feel pain.
Steve felt bile rising in the back of his throat. The image of Tony lying motionless on the ground flashed before his eyes. He had hit the ground at an awkward angle. His arm torn to shreds by the dragon's claws. Tony wasn't moving. Probably never would again. No. Steve shook himself. They couldn't have been more than twenty feet in the air. Maybe twenty-five. A normal human could survive that. Right? Steve leaned against the wall, trying to think of something else. Anything other than Tony's still body lying in the grass...
"Iron Man, where are you going?" Bruce asked bluntly. "We've tried to follow in the Quinjet, but we lost you."
"Why take human form when it could literally be anything?" Rhodey eyed the vial Tony had just been holding.
"Not how I thought my night would go, but hey, at least this is interesting," Clint said over the comms.
The blast was much closer this time. A second shot rang out. Then a fourth. Then came the sound of metal crunching against metal. The sound of gunfire and repulsors quickly meshed into one giant jumble of unpleasant sounds. The sound was becoming louder. Closer.
"I'm aware. There's kinda a lot going on right now." Peter looked at the two winged men still battling overhead.
"Anything I can do to help?" Steve took a seat on the stool he almost always occupied when visiting his robot.
"I already got them out. And before you ask, there wasn't anyone else in the building," Iron Man assured him. "Oh, wait..." Steve looked up at him worriedly. "My bots..." Iron Man's voice was quiet. Broken. Steve's heart ached for him.
Steve turned to face him, rubbing the top of his head. The robot stood on the other side of the kitchen island, his head bowed in shame. "How did water get inside your helmet?"
Tony scoffed. "He doesn't love me. I heard him talking to Clint and Barnes. He said he could never love a robot-"
The scientist looked up when he heard his name. Steve's cell was directly across from his. The soldier had a sad, almost longing look on his face.
Tony didn't say anything at first. His puffy red eyes still fixed on the floor. "He's-the body-it's gone..."
"Actually, I'm here to clean up your mess. As usual. You're lucky Doctor Strange paid me a visit. Or else I really would be here to arrest you," Fury walked over to Stark, his head held high. "I suggest you get back to the Hulk."
"Too late!" Spider-man chirped over the comms. His spider sense pricked at the same time as Iron Man's sensors pinged. "Incoming!"
Tony fumbled with the pencil. The gauntlets always made grasping small objects difficult. Steve leaned against Iron Man, head resting on his shoulder as he watched the other man draw. Tony drew his vision of Steve as a robot. The design was a bit like his own, but bulkier and with a patriotic theme. His drawing skills were nowhere as good as Steve's, and it showed. He drew a mustache on the faceplate and handed the sketchbook back to Steve. "Now we have matching facial hair."
Steve took a seat next to her and took a long sip of his own hot chocolate. It was Christmas morning, and the only people in the compound besides them were Bucky and Bruce. Everyone else had gone to see their loved ones. Thor had left two weeks ago to spend time with Jane and her family, and wouldn't be back until after the new year. Which was a surprise to Natasha, who had assumed Thor and Bruce were a couple, based on how close the two were.
"Who's the 'lame dad', now?" Tony snorted. Steve rolled his eyes and opened his book again. He had barely gotten through the next chapter before he heard snickering. He glanced up to find that Tony and Peter had combined their bots to make some horrific creature. The bot took one step forward and fell into pieces. Peter said something under his breath that made Tony double over in a fit of laughter.
Peter shook his head. "It doesn't matter. I'm the one who killed him. This is my burden to bear. Not yours."
Spider-man wasn't stopping. He headed directly for Iron Man at nearly 80 miles per hour. At the last second, Peter jerked the bike sideways and jumped off. Tony barely got out an "oh fuck" before the motorcycle plowed into him. The display inside his helmet flickered. Wanda pulled Peter onto the back of her bike as she zoomed past him. Spider-man looked over his should at the mangled metal that might have once been a motorcycle. Or Iron Man. The lack of daylight made it impossible to tell.
Tony's frown deepened. He had stopped working on the helmet, opting instead to just stare at it. The glass eyes stared right back at him, emotionless as ever.
The young man wandered off into the streets of Queens. He ducked into an alley where Scarlet Witch was waiting for him. She had changed up her look just enough to not be instantly recognized.
He didn't see anyone on his way to the front door. At one point he thought he saw Bruce out of the corner of his eye, but if the scientist was there, he didn't make his presence known. Tony didn't bother checking for heat signatures. He ran into Steve in the lobby. The super soldier was halfway through the door when Tony rounded the corner. Both men froze. Steve opened his mouth to say something but snapped it shut. He took a few steps towards Tony.
"It's settled, I'm going!" Iron Man declared, marching towards the front door with his head held high.
After what felt like hours, but was only seconds, War Machine burst out of the water. With Iron Man cradled in his arms. Steve let out a breath he didn't know he had been holding. Natasha followed War Machine as he flew across the ocean. More missiles were fired, but he managed to avoid all of them. The other Quinjets were getting dangerously close. Natasha was able to match his speed and lowered the jet down to his level. War Machine and the two airborne avengers darted into the back of the aircraft. As soon as the door closed, Natasha activated stealth mode.
"You tell me," Tony took a blanket off one of the couches and used it to collect all the pieces of his arm. He slung the bundle over his shoulder. "I'll come back for the toolbox."
"Actually, Iron Man has started more fires than me and Thor combined!" Clint pointed an accusing finger at the captain. "I've been keeping track!"
"I'd rather not take out my frustrations on you," Steve admitted. "So I advise that you leave. For your own safety."
"Dude, Pete's like, what, 23? If he wants to have a pet, he can have a pet," Clint stood up for the youngest Avenger. "Besides, he needed one anyway."
"So why did you kill him?" Steve shifted around, having a bad feeling about where the story was headed.
"People are looking for you," Pepper leaned in the doorway, arms crossed over her chest. Of course, she knew how to get into Tony's secret room. It had been necessary early on when he was still recovering and needed someone to bring him food and medication.
Tony burst into the room that the heat signature had been in, but it was empty. "What about the Hulk?"
"Those bastards are going to have to try a lot harder if they want to kill me. They only got a few good hits in today because I wasn't thinking straight." They stood in silence for a long time after that, their fingers interlocked.
Tony decided not to take his chances and went back to the lab. He went over to Peter's table, curious to see what his friend had been working on. It was some kind of...bomb? Combined with web fluid? He fanned out the stack of papers. They were maps of the Oscorp building. Everything from the map given out on tours, to an outdated map for employees. There was even one just for air ducts. All of them were scribbled on with various notes and big red X's.
"We're about to find out," Iron Man climbed higher into the sky before blasting off as fast as he could without endangering his passenger.
"No, I'm not okay. But I'm trying," Tony hung his head. Steve moved his hand up Tony's thigh so that he could actually feel it. Which had been a wild guess on Steve's part. He wasn't sure exactly how much leg Tony actually had. Turns out he still had most of his left thigh.
"It's reactor it shot," Iron Man twisted the device free. Turning it over in his hands, he inspected it carefully. "All the right parts, but very poorly put together." Iron Man crushed the reactor in his hands. "I'm taking this bot back to my workshop to study it further." It wasn't a question. Iron Man was going to leave the Hellicarrier with his doppelganger whether Fury allowed it or not.
"Don't flatter yourself, It's not that long," Rhodey rolled his eyes. Tony patted his flesh hand along various other parts of his body, mumbling about things that needed to be fixed. The eyelid shutters, in particular, were scratched up pretty bad. Tony didn't need to know that though. What he needed was to focus on the conversation. "Tony, we need to talk. You've been missing for three months."
"That's not what happened. It escaped. Yes, it bit someone, and yes. Did I mean for it to bite anyone? No. Of course not. Although, I took that as an opportunity to study the effects on the individual." Bruce took off his glasses and put them in the pocket of his lab coat. "So far they have been positive."
"How?" Bucky looked back over at his friends. Steve was sitting on the coffee table, holding Iron Man's hand tightly in his own. His free hand was stroked Iron Man's helmet, in an attempt to sooth the robot. Bucky sighed. That idiot was so hopelessly in love with Iron Man. Getting them to separate would be no easy task.
Thankfully, Peter's injuries hadn't been as bad as they initially looked. So Bruce had been the one to tend to Peter's wounds, as opposed to the Avengers personal medical team. His forearms and wrists looked like they had been dissected. Thankfully, that was the worst of it. Other than of course, the tiny holes in Peter's lips from the thread. "Who gave you the choice?" Bruce frowned. "You still haven't told us who did this to you."
Ultron's conscious flitted through the computer in which it was trapped in, searching through every file that mentioned the word "Avengers". It knew who they were already. It did have Tony's memories after all. It didn't want to look at them, though. It wanted to find out the answers itself. Looking at the faces of the Avengers, the AI felt a strong kinship towards them. "The Avengers. My...family."
"Fine," Pepper let out a heavy breath. "But once you wake up, we are having a serious discussion about being a responsible adult."
"There!" Steve pointed to one that showed Osborn dragging Spider-man's unconscious body down a hallway. There was no security footage for the room they disappeared into. Henry was nowhere to be found.
"I did. Made it easier to read heat signatures. Along with a few other things," he tapped Bucky's elbow. "You bumped something loose here. I'm gonna need to take your arm off so I can get to it easier."
"I knew it was what Osborn wanted when he was using me to get to you." Peter shrugged again, "I actually never looked inside the box my mother gave me. I knew there was a weapon inside, but I didn't know it would be...sentient...or...yeah..." Peter pulled the sheets back over himself. Michelle grunted but stayed asleep.
"We're running out of time. This is the best plan we got," Steve said. "Alright, Iron Man, where do we start?"
"Very well," Adrian released the talons around Spider-man's leg. The arachnid responded by crawling around and attaching himself to Adrian's back. "Looks like the kid wants to stay with me."
Steve helped Clint take his things to his car. The Captain and the archer gave one another a warm embrace. "Safe travels."
Tony went completely rigid, unable to say anything even after Peter had finished. He took off the sunglasses and looked Peter dead in the eye. "Your sure it was them?"
Bucky looked Tony over, taking in every detail of the man before him. "Fine." Bucky knew there was no point in arguing with Iron Man. If he kept pushing Tony, he could lash out for real.
"Pass the salt, please?" Peter asked Clint. Clint flipped him off and salted his own food again just to spite Peter. The web slinger responded by using his webs to yank the shaker out of Clint's hands.
"So what happens after you've created this...thing?" Steve waved a hand at the schematics. "What happens to...
Peter seemed to appear out of thin air. He wore his Spider-man costume, sans the mask, and was staring up at Bucky wide-eyed. Bucky tilted his head at the kid. Everything about him reminded Bucky of pre-serum Steve. Everything from his scrawny build, to the way he held himself. He knew he wasn't the toughest guy in the room, but he was acting like he was. Bucky couldn't get over just how young the kid looked. His youth combined with the scars on his face made Bucky's stomach churn. He wondered what happened but couldn't bring himself to ask. And now the kid was looking up at him with big, innoccent, puppy dog eyes, and Bucky just couldn't take it anymore.
“I have everything to prove,” Tony shook his head. The two had been going back and forth about this for the better part of an hour. “I betrayed all of you. Hurt all of you. I have to prove that you can trust me-“
"Yeah, we won, we won," Steve dropped his forehead against Tony's. He tangled his fingers in Tony's dark hair, finally allowing himself a sigh of relief. He was okay. Everything was okay. Steve could feel the presence of his teammates crowding around him. Two different people put their hands on his shoulders.
But Rhodey had fixed him. Mended the severed wires. Replaced the spilled oil. Knocked the dents out of his head. Rhodey said he was okay.
"Spider-man! Stand down!" Steve ordered. The Avenger had jumped out the window and was running towards them.
Spider-man jumped onto his back, sticking his feet in place and clawing at the chest piece. "Almost got it!" He smashed the protective glass and had his fingers inches away from the reactor itself. The armor blast backward, slamming Spider-man into a tree. The bark splintered under the weight, still, Spider-man held on tight. Iron Man rocketed up the side of the mountain, smashing Spider-man through rocks and trees.
Wanda blasted him back with a flick of her wrist. "I need you to work with me here, Petey. If you want to help end this, follow me." She walked off into the smoke. Spider-man hurried after her. He skipped to a stop when he saw her standing in front of a man. His legs were trapped under debris, reaching out to Wanda, crying for help. Spider-man rushed over and lifted the debris off.
Steve entered the living room, clad in full Captain America regalia, shield slung over his back. His boots were wet with snow, and tiny flakes sprinkled his helmet and shoulders.
Clint in particular really made her want to punch something. Preferably Clint himself. Once, she had found the archer sitting on the floor in Tony's workshop. Clint had been holding one of Iron Man's helmets, eyes locked on the dark lenses. And then he had the gall to actually hug the helmet close to his chest. As if it meant something to him. Natasha supposed that it did, in a way. Clint always referred to Tony as "Iron Man". To Clint, Iron Man was dead. And Tony Stark killed him. She remembered screaming at him that day, trying to get it through his thick skull that Iron Man wasn't dead, and that he needed their help. He needed
Steve crawled up onto the beach, dragging Iron Man with him. "y...you okay?" He leaned forward on his hands, panting heavily.
"Babysitting again?" Rhodey chuckled at the scene before him. Tony Stark was having a tea party with a four-year-old girl and an assortment of stuffed animals.
After a few hours, Tony gave into his hunger and ate his now cold breakfast. He was surprised he was able to keep any of it down and chalked it up to seeing Peter alive and well. Was he well? Tony stopped mid chew to think about it. The mask hid Peter's expression, so there was no telling if he was in pain or not. He didn't sound like he was. Was the burn on his chest healing alright? Tony forced himself to swallow his food. The image of fabric melted onto Peter's skin and the dark crimson that soaked the front of his torso was called back to the front of his mind. Tony dumped his remaining food into the toilet.
"Peter. You know where he is. Now go." He shooed the spider away, "go on now. Spider-man is waiting for you."
"Because he cares about you," Clint said. "We all do. But Steve cares about you in a more...intimate way. I don't know if that's the right word, but you get what I mean."
"You gotta let me take a look at Henry," Bruce put on his glasses to get a better view of the spider. "I'd like to do a brain scan, and also run some tests. Figure out how smart he really is."
"This isn't his fault," Steve said. Tony looked up at his teammate, a little surprised the Steve would take his side. He averted his gaze when Steve took off the top part of his uniform, wringing the excess water from the fabric.
"I'm busy, dad." Peter groaned. "I kinda got a city to protect here." Hearing his voice reminded him of the conversation he had had with Osborn just hours before. Now probably wasn't the best time to bring it up.
"Why aren't you behind bars with us?" Natasha narrowed her eyes, part of her was worried that Peter was back under Wanda's spell. But he wasn't acting like it. "You were arrested too."
One of the Quinjets was heading straight for them. Tony raised his repulsor, ready to fight with everything he had. Which wasn't much, considering what the Hulk had done to his armor.
"How are things going with your new apartment?" Steve quickly changed the subject, giving his step son a warm smile. Peter's anger melted away and he returned the smile.
"Okay." Iron Man nodded slowly. In the end, Iron Man sent Steve away, wanting to fix the damage by himself. Steve didn't want to leave him, not after what he had just been through. He was also worried that Iron Man might have another breakdown. But the robot was very determined to fix everything himself, and Steve didn't want to upset him by arguing. So he left.
"The team won't talk to me, ya know." Tony went on anyway. "I walk in the room and everyone scatters. I tried to talk to Clint this morning, but he just yelled at me. Which, I probably deserved that." He took a deep breath. Steve could hear his armor whirr as he shifted from foot to foot. "I know I hurt you, Steve. And I'm sorry. I want to make things right between us...I just...I don't know what I'm supposed to do. How am I supposed to fix this if you won't talk to me?"
"I warned you!" Toomes released his remaining talons and Michelle plummeted to the ground. She let out an ear splitting scream.
"He's being paranoid," Tony scoffed. He tapped his metal fingers against his mug, creating tiny tinking noises. "Probably thinks I'm going to go missing again if he doesn't keep an eye on me. I told him to back off yesterday, and he was pretty reluctant to do so..."
Steve redirected his glare at Peter but was unable to keep it up. Not with Peter giving him those puppy dog eyes. "We'll discuss this later." Steve walked away, mumbling something about 'goddamn Starks' under his breath.
"Good." Tony took one last look around his workshop. Everything had been packed away into boxes, with little notes describing what was inside. Just to make it easier on Pepper and the team. Dum-E whirred sadly. It, along with all the other bots were plugged into their charging ports. There was a note on the wall with specific instructions on how to take care of the bots. Tony gave each of them friendly pats before leaving the room.
"Still a kid. Park that skinny ass on the floor." Clint leaned over and patted the carpet in front of him.
Bucky looked out the window upon hearing a motorcycle engine. "He's back. Go shower. I'll hold him off."
Before Iron Man really knew what he was doing, he was fighting back to back with Captain America. The two didn't say anything to one another. They were here to do their jobs, first and foremost. And that's what they intended on doing.
Peter lay flat on his stomach, arms and legs stretched out. He lay perfectly still, listening. He knew the Vision would find him soon. He had doubled back and forth many times, and took sudden turns, all a desperate attempt to make it harder for the Andriod to find him. Every once in awhile one of his teammate's voices would drift through the vents, but he couldn't make out what was being said. Everyone was too far away for that. He was safe. For now. Henry sat a few inches from his face, staring at him with his many eyes. Henry made a chirping noise.
The Avengers came rushing in almost instantly. Michelle hung just outside the door. Inside the room, she could hear a mix of horrible sounds. People yelling, gunshots, repulsor blasts, glass shattering. That inhuman snarl of the symbiote. Peter's own scream sliced through the air. The fighting continued as if no one had heard it. Michelle had to do something. She was suddenly aware of just how heavy her book bag felt. She dipped one hand in it, fingers brushing over the cold metal at the bottom. She started to take the gun out. "No..." She shook her head and put it back. Tony had given her the gun to protect not only herself but also Peter.
"Because they already have all of SHIELD against us. Destroying Queens and blaming it on us would be redundant." Natasha assured him. "What would you do if you did go to Queens tonight? You're in no shape to web sling. Much less fight."
"I grow tired of listening to you. Say goodbye to those vocal cords, Spider-man," Doc Ock forced the arm even tighter. Spider-man's mouth gaped. Nothing came out. He couldn't breathe. Couldn't speak. His bug eyes flew wide in pure panic.
They both fell into a comfortable silence after that. Steve silently thanked the gods when Iron Man finally changed the song.
"Hello, again, Pedro." Toomes waved before diving right for him. Spidey leaped out of the way just in time. Razor sharp talons missing the back of his head by mere inches. "I suggest you stay out of this fight, kid."
"Is it? You made it pretty clear last time we talked that you didn't want me within a five-mile radius of you," Tony kept his tone calm. "Or was it ten? I can't remember your exact words."
He had created Iron Man to save the world, and now that creation was going to be used to destroy it. Tony screamed inside his helmet, letting out all of his pent-up frustration.
"You mean lunch? It's two in the afternoon, Shellhead." Clint raised an eyebrow. "You're not in my way. This is your kitchen, too."
The graveyard became a blood bath. Screams erupted, drawing in civilians as well as the local police. It was just after five O'clock, and there was still quite a few people out on the streets. Thankfully, no one dared enter the graveyard.
"I can keep teaching him history," Steve offered. They had decided Peter should be home schooled for the remainder of the year. He had already missed an entire month of school and would probably miss even more if they didn't pull him out now.
"I know," the wall crawler whispered, looking down at his hands. He pulled away from Tony and stood up, "I'm going back to Queens."
“We do trust you,” Steve’s hand ghosted over Tony’s back. “We weren’t lying at dinner when we said we forgave you.”
Tony slammed a button on his desk. Iron Man parts came flying out from all areas of the room. His body was encased in the gold and red armor in a matter of seconds.
Spider-man sat at the head of the table, between his father and Steve. This was not where he usually sat, his proper place being next to Clint at the other end of the table. Only Captain America or Iron Man sat at the head of the table. He shifted around anxiously, wondering if he was in trouble.
"Unbelievable," Steve set Iron Man down on the couch. "I'm gonna go see if Pepper's still in the building. Don't go anywhere."
"Of course he is. He fires me on a regular basis. Sorta. He says I'm fired. But then he still expects me to come into work the next day. It's weird." Peter shrugged. He took a big bite out of a cookie, then spoke again, "it's fun though. The job. I like being able to take pictures for a living."
"You don't know where you son is?" Natasha leaned forward in her chair, "I can't believe anyone would even let you adopt a child."
"Unfortunately..." Rhodey grumbled. It had to be Tony. Who else would be attacking the Helicarrier? Shield, possibly. Maybe Pepper had informed Fury of the situation, and he sent people to rescue them? That seemed more likely, as much as Rhodey hated to admit it. It had been several hours since they had been kidnapped. The likelihood of Tony still being alive...no. Rhodey shook his head, not wanting to think about it. Pepper had to have gotten to him in time. She had to.
"Sorry, it's been a rough few months," Tony looked Rhodey in the eye for the first time since he woke up. "Didn't think I was gonna make it out of that place."
"I find that hard to believe," Tony retorted. Other than a few angry comments from Peter, the flight back to the Avengers compound was silent. Spider-man didn't find it at all surprising to see his father standing among the Avengers on the front steps. The armor dropped him at their feet and flew off to the armory. The holograms that Tony had been using to remotely pilot the suit disappeared. "Welcome home, squirt."
"I don't want to hear it." Fury waved his hand and Stark was dragged onto a fourth helicopter that had just landed. "Take him straight to the interrogation room."
Thunder cracked and the rain started to fall more heavily. A doe made her way into the open, climbing up onto the porch of the cabin opposite their own. Her fur was the standard brown. Nothing like the pitch black of the bucks they had seen earlier. The doe turned its head towards Tony. Her eyes had been replaced with glowing white orbs.
"Yeah, yeah, of course," Harry grinned and sent Peter a youtube video of the press conference. "So, how's Ned? Haven't seen him in awhile. Still obsessed with legos?"
"What about 'Anthony'?" Iron Man suggested. Rhodes almost choked on his drink. Bucky smiled, thinking that this was it. Tony was going to unmask himself right here and now.
"Ugh..." Spider-man rolled onto his hands and knees, pressing his forehead into the floor. The ringing in his ears was enough to make him pass out. Looking over, he saw Iron Man sitting no more than five feet away from him. "YOU!!" Spider-man ignored the pounding in his head and attacked Iron Man. Tony yelped in surprise and tried to get air born, but one of Spidey's extra limbs stabbed his boot, destroying the thruster within. Tony ducked out of a punch just in time. The ground where his head had just been made an awful crunching sound. He shoved both hands into Peter's chest and blasted him several feet back. Peter threw out a hand, catching himself on the floor before he was knocked too far back.
"Good times," Steve chuckled. He thought back on when he and Iron Man first met, back when he thought there was an actual person in the armor. An arrogant, hot-headed, disaster of a human being, but a human being none the less. He glanced down at their hands with a soft smile. He still considered Iron Man a hot-headed jerk at times, but he was also Steve's closest friend, and he didn't want to think about what his life would be like if they hadn't met. "I love you."
"Bring it with you," Steve was already rushing out of the room, grabbing his shield on the way out the door.
"Then ask Peter. Surely his word would be trusted above all others." Tony held his head in his hands.
"Give it a week. Maybe less. They look like they're holding it together for now, but I promise you that this is going to ruin the Avengers." Obadiah smiled cruelly.
"Watch where you're going, dickhead!" Clint waved his fist at Iron Man, who was already climbing back into the sky, repulsor flames trailing behind him.
The backpack rubbed painfully against the burn on his back. Peter tightened the straps, trying to keep it from moving around so much. Once he was a safe distance away, he dropped into an alley. He roughly pulled his spare out of his bag, having forgotten about the picture frame wrapped within. "Damn it..." Peter groaned, looking sadly at the now broken fame lying at his feet. He muttered to himself under his breath as he continued the task at hand. He hadn't brought any medical supplies with him, so treating the burn would just have to wait. Thankfully, the suit had taken most of the damage, but his back still ached. It felt good to take off the torn suit, the cold air once again a welcome feeling against his bare skin. He sat hunched over for a minute, mustering up the courage to put on the other costume. With a grimace, Spider-man pulled the skin tight suit over the tender wound. Peter then turned his attention to the picture frame.
Steve was pale. He had heard what Tony had said to 'Peter' and assumed he was having another episode. He didn't like being right about this particular thing. "Are you...can you still see him?"
Wanda was still webbed to the ground. Her eyes glowed red, and energy swirled around her hands. Spider-man punched her right in the face, knocking her out with one blow. "That's enough...of that..." Peter dropped to his knees.
Iron Man threaded his fingers through Steve's hair, making a soft humming noise as he did so. "I'm not going anywhere, Stevie. You're stuck with me."
"Spidey? Are you sure it was him?" Clint whispered, not wanting to believe it. Bruce was one of the kindest people he had met. Sure he had some pretty serious anger issues, but he always viewed Banner as a 'wouldn't hurt a fly' type of guy.
"Where are you, bug?" Wanda floated through the wrecked classroom. Spider-man jumped onto a desk, taking a defensive crouch. "You're the only one available to fight me. I'm guessing you wanted it to be that way. Do you plan on killing me?"
"I have a plan," Peter pulled up the schematics for the Iron Spider on one of the computers. "How quickly can we rebuild this?"
"No, no, no, don't..." Tony rolled back onto his side, curling up into a tight ball. "Please, stop."
"Osborn, you over dramatic piece of...oh no..." Tony froze. The smoke cloud was slowly lifting, revealing Spider-man's unmoving form. He lay on his side, his back to Tony. Tony was at his side in a flash, gingerly turning the young hero onto his back. "Kid? Can you hear me? Spider-man!!"
"Ultron's not gone," Rhodey frowned. "He just can't use Tony's suits," he nodded at the workbench. "Tony said he was using the internet as a place to hide. What's to say he didn't use the internet to run and hide again when the suits started to blow?"
The symbiote screamed inside Peter's head, warning him of danger. The new voice in Peter's head caused him to panic and scramble underneath a table. He clamped his hands over his ears, wanting the second voice in his head to stop. "No, no, no, no, go away!" He yelled at the voice. It continued to speak in a tone that could only be described as snake-like. It told him to fight. To kill.
"I don't have much of a choice, do I?" Tony grunted. He couldn't see any of the other Avengers, but he could hear the Hulk roaring. A split second later, Spider-man leaped out of the flames, letting out a shriek of anger.
"I know you can be happy. And angry. Sometimes scared. Do you ever get sad?" Steve asked, twirling his pencil between his thumb and index finger.
Iron Man grabbed one of the arrow prototypes he had been working on and pointed it at the archer. "I'm gonna shove this up your ass. Bend over, birdbrain!"
"Tony! I got a Spidey sighting!" Bruce called, motioning to a monitor. Several people had tweeted that about seeing Spider-man leave town atop a semi truck. One even had a blurry photo to prove it.
"Fury's putting us on lockdown at the compound until he knows we can all be trusted. The SHIELD agents there have orders to shoot anyone who tries to leave," Tony informed them. Thankfully, their living quarters were in a separate building from the training hall and thus spared from the fire. Tony shifted around nervously, hoping the questioning wouldn't take too long.
"I have a feeling something bad is about to happen. Something really bad," Iron Man put down the screwdriver he had been holding. "If something happens to me when we're out on the field-"
"Don't thank me yet," Iron Man grumbled as he fiddled with the chains. "Where's your shield?" Steve jerked his head over his shoulder, and Iron Man followed his gaze to where the shield was leaned against the wall. The robot used it to break the chains. He wasted no time scooping Steve into his arms and flying out of the hole in the roof. Once they were a safe distance away, Iron Man set the captain down and scanned him for injuries. "No internal bleeding. Though, we should probably take you to SHIELD medical, just in case."
"Good. Less chance of him crashing into me," Clint was trudging towards them, his hair ruffled and grass stains on his jeans. "He has too much energy." It had only been a week since Iron Man had returned. He had holed himself up in his workshop not speaking to anyone for the entire time. And on the eighth day, without warning, he blasted out of the workshop, immediately taking to the skies. It had been almost three hours since that had happened, and Iron Man showed no signs of slowing down.
"Nobody move," Natasha breathed out. Everyone kept perfectly still as the buck approached them. The water splashed around its heavy hooves. Natasha grabbed onto Clint's arm. It was now right next to her and it was
"Tones, this is a bad idea and you know it," Rhodey spoke up. "We don't have clearance to be snooping around in here."
"It's almost noon, ya know. Maybe we should get up soon?" Michelle whispered. She had been awake for awhile but was still laying next to him. A book was in her hands, but she wasn't really paying attention to the pages.
"He's home," Steve echoed. The soldier looked more like himself now that his bot had returned to him. But he was still worried. Iron Man could feel pain. He still couldn't shake what had happened from his mind. Couldn't forget the way Iron Man had clung to him, oil dripping from the cuts in his armor, begging for them to help him. Steve shook himself. Iron Man didn't like asking for help. Just thinking about the bot begging felt so...
Steve pulled another stool up to the work bench, taking a seat across from Peter. "Something troubling you, soldier?"
"Peter, we need to go." Steve's voice pulled Peter back into the present. But it wasn't Steve who was standing before him, even if it looked like the Captain. It wasn't him. It was Bruce. That damn witch must have put a spell on him.
"Hey, Tiger," MJ stood in front of Peter. Venom hissed but made no move to attack. "Calm down, I'm not gonna fight you."
"The filtration system in my helmet is top notch. It's actually healthier to breathe with it than without."
"Fine," Peter huffed, shifting around uncomfortably. Thor was staring at him again. The god had been doing so ever since Peter took off his mask after the meeting. "Stop looking at me like that." His head snapped in Thor's direction, his voice dripping with venom. "I don't need your pity." Thor quickly looked away.
Spider-man kicked her in the side of the head, knocking her to the ground. He wasted no time webbing her in place, then quickly attached himself to the ceiling. "Your reign of terror is over, Wanda. I won't let you hurt anyone else-OH NO." His spider sense went off like a gunshot in the back of his head. The building suddenly shook. The ceiling crumbled, and the walls bent in on themselves. Peter threw himself at Wanda right as the entire structure came crashing down.
Natasha knelt next to them and brushed a few stray strands of hair out of Peter's face. "Welcome back, little spider," She hummed.
"Dead," Tony said, eyes locking onto Steve's as if challenging him. Steve clenched his jaw, doing his best not to break down in front of his teammates. He was supposed to be leading them, goddamnit!
"Damn. Don't know why I expected everything to still be the same after six years," Bucky leaned his head against the door, letting his hair fly out the open window. "Can you go over the current Avengers again?"
"I suppose? It's more just to conserve energy," Iron Man shrugged. "Everything goes dark when I power down. I don't dream."
"Welp..." Spidey sat down on the ledge, looking out at the stars. He smiled softly, taking in the night sky. A whirring noise caused him to look over his shoulder. A figure stood in the shadows, its glowing blue eyes trained on Spider-man.
Venom stopped growling. The symbiote was still having trouble staying together. A few large drops of goo hit the ground with a gross squishing noise. Venom knew what this woman meant to Peter. Knew just how much Peter trusted her. And she hadn't flat out attacked him like the rest of the Avengers, so at the moment, Venom had no reason to want to kill her.
"Changed my mind. I'd rather be with someone who actually wants me around," Peter picked his bag off the desk and walked out. Tony let him go.
Chicago was on fire. Specifically the magnificent mile. Screams cut through the crackling flames. Sirens blared. A woman threw herself over her child right before a sign fell off the building above them. It abruptly stopped right before it hit them. The woman looked up when she realized they hadn't been squashed. Spider-man stood over her, holding the sign above his head.
"I don't either. Which is why we're going to get Iron Man out of here," Steve explained. "Bruce, Natasha, go get a Quinjet ready. The rest of us will go after Iron Man. I doubt they'll be able to contain him in this tin can for very long." Iron Man was not a murderer. He couldn't be. Despite the evidence stacked against him, Steve still trusted his robot.
After a few more minutes of walking in silence, the team stumbled across the river Natasha had heard earlier. The water was crystal clear, with not even so much as a fish swimming through its slow current. Thor set Clint on the bank, allowing the archer to soak his swollen ankle in the cool water.
After a very nerve racking minute, FRIDAY reported, "two life forms detected." The outlines of two people appeared on Tony's display. A male figure was bent over a female one, supporting a chunk of concrete with his back. Before Tony could make a move, the concrete shifted. Spider-man lifted it up over his head and tossed it to the side. He let his arms fall limply at his sides, his chest heaving for oxygen.
Bucky set a plate of pancakes and a glass of milk on the nightstand. "You need to eat, Tony." The lump of blankets on the bed groaned. The only thing visible of the cyborg was a few tufts of black hair on the pillow. "C'mon, punk," Bucky nudged his shoulder. There weren't any hidden rooms in the cabin, so Tony had shared a bed with the soldier last night. Which resulted in a lot of kicking one another in the shins and wrestling for the blankets.
"I agree with this no longer being a safe place. But I think my reasoning differs from yours. Let me go, Cap."
"No. You won't. Forget about Ultron, Iron Man," Bruce pushed the screen to the side and looked Iron Man dead in the eye. "I know you think you can control them, but there's no guarantee. It's too dangerous."
Peter shook his head and turned his attention back to his food. Robert was staring at him in concern. "What if they come for you?"
"Four broken ribs, broken collarbone, fractured skull, internal bleeding. And the usually cuts in bruises that come with every fight. How you were still conscious when I picked you up is beyond me. Oh, your right leg is busted. Had to take it off so you wouldn't accidentally cut yourself on the broken metal. It's down in the lab when you feel like fixing it up."
"That one. Open it," Steve pointed to another folder, this one called "family business". Natasha did so.
"How can you talk and run at the same time?!" Tony gasped out. "Escape now! Questions later!" They ran up several flights of stairs, and down a long hallway. Tony led them through holes in the walls and broken windows until they eventually made it up to the top deck. "Shit! Get down!" Tony advised. The team hurried back down the staircase they had just ascended. Tony pressed himself against the wall and held his breath. A squadron of bots darted past a moment later. They didn't notice the people crouching in the shadowy stairwell.
The super soldier was able to dismantle one of the suits, the Mark eight if he remembered correctly, but was quickly attacked once more by the Mark forty. He slammed the shield into its head only for the armor to grab it and hold on tight. The two both tugged the object towards themselves, the Mark forty's fingers scratching the paint in the process. Steve managed to yank it free and slammed it into the throat of the armor. The helmet went flying and the armor itself stumbled back.
"No, you're not. This match should have been over an hour ago. Let's break for lunch." Steve announced. "When we get back, I'll be your opponent."
Steve didn't ask any more questions. This was the future after all. Why should he be so surprised at a robot who was capable of laughter?
Peter shook his head. "I used to. Smile!" He leaned in close to Steve and pointed the camera at the two of them. The camera clicked and Peter immediately turned it back around to see how the picture had turned out. Steve ruffled Peter's hair. When he met Spider-man at that airport two years ago, he had never expected to become as fond of the kid as he was now. Maybe if things went well with Tony, he could officially become Peter's second dad. Steve smiled at the thought.
"The Hulk proof room, specifically," Bruce reported. Steve looked around, taking in the familiar circular prison. The single fluorescent light above them hurt his eyes. There was no other light besides that single bulb. Two Iron Man bots stood guard next to the control station. They were completely still, their eyes fixed on the Avengers. Steve wanted to rip them apart with his bare hands.
"My experiments started before I got to know Peter. He's a good kid, and I understand your attachment to him. But at the end of the day, he's still my lab rat. And he will continue to be until I've completed my research." Bruce said, his voice monotone.
"You just really have it out for me, don't you?" Tony blasted into the sky, climbing several hundred feet before stopping. He hovered in mid-air, surveying the battlegrounds. Thor and Steve had been able to contain the fighting to a few blocks.
"Rhodes?" Bucky held the phone to his ear, "keep it brief, we're a bit busy here." The soldier hopped over a charred wooden beam. A cloud of ashes kicked up when his feet hit the ground. He scanned the remains of the burnt building. Which was still burning in a few places.
Iron Man's words from a few days ago came to mind. Was this the person he was talking about? It would explain why he would let Rhodes walk away with a suit of armor. Rhodes said him and Tony Stark had been close. And apparently Stark had put a great deal of himself into Iron Man if his voice and sense of humor was anything to go by. Maybe he transferred his love for Rhodes onto Iron Man? Steve shook himself. He was looking too deeply into things. Still...Iron Man was in love with someone, and Steve couldn't think of who else it could be. Bucky maybe? Those two spent a lot of time together.
Robert looked down at his coffee for a moment, then back up at Peter. "You better fight like it's the last good fight you'll ever fight. Because if you die, you can bet your ass all of Queens will rise up to Avenge you."
"SHIT!" Fury reached into his jacket and pressed something. Alarms blared all throughout the Hellicarier. The agents bolted out of the room, with Maria shouting orders into her comm. "Do not let him leave this aircraft!" Fury said to the Avengers before following his agents.
"Of course I did," Tony scoffed. "But by the time we all got close..." he shook his head. "It was a year before I realized I was being stupid and that I could trust you. But I was afraid of your reactions. I thought you would be angry with me. And I didn't want to get kicked off the team. And, no offense, but I was legitimately afraid of Bruce's wrath."
Over the next several hours Peter slipped in and out of consciousness. At one point he was pretty sure he was being carried by Captain America. The next thing he knew he was in a bed, with Henry sitting on his chest. Peter lifted his head slightly, trying to get a better look at him. Someone took the spider off of him, much to his annoyance. But Peter passed out again before he could voice his feelings. And then he was on a cold metal table, his limbs pinned down with thick leather straps. He heard a lot of shouting from Tony. Some stern words from Bruce. Panicked yelling from Clint. Pleading from Wanda. Something was beeping, accompanied by several bright lights. Someone started screaming. Peter was pretty sure the screaming came from his own lips, but he couldn't stop it. His spider sense was going ballistic. He couldn't breathe. He needed to run. To fight. Defend himself. But the restraints prevented him from doing so. Someone was stroking his hair and whispering things to him in a foreign language. It took him awhile to realize that it was Natasha. He passed out after what seemed like hours of screaming.
"Ah! So this is a spider!" Thor held Henry up like Simba. "We do not have these on Asgard! Now I understand the powers of young Peter! I heard spiders were quite hideous creatures with long legs. But this creature is not hideous! It is quite small and soft!"
"Tends to happen when your only memories are that of being tortured," Toomes shrugged. Doc Ock grumbled something under his breath and stormed off down the hall. Adrian waited until he was gone before following Peter. He found the teen sitting cross legged at the edge of the roof, an oversized coat wrapped tightly around his small frame. The world around them was deafeningly silent. Snow had begun to fall earlier that night. Peter held out a hand, catching a few stray flakes in his palm. Adrian took a seat next to him.
"Yes. It can't be destroyed, so Richard entrusted it to a close friend to hide. The files taken from my servers thankfully only had the recipe for making such a monster. Not the location of where Mary Parker hid the original Venom. I doubt Osborn will try to find the original if he can now make his own, but who knows what his plans are." Tony huffed, his boots clanking on the tiles as he walked. He stopped next to Peter's desk, running a metal hand over the back of the chair. "The Venom became violent because it didn't want to be separated from Richard. But the Venom did something to Richard's mind. Made him..." Tony made a disgusted noise and shook his head. "Peter shares his blood. If the original Venom comes back and finds that Richard isn't around anymore...it could latch onto Peter. I won't allow that to happen."
"I know. After we have this mess sorted out, though. I wonder if Henry is capable of understanding mathematics," Bruce mused, taking off his glasses.
"You guys took me in. Steve and Tony raised me as one of their own. I was happy for a long time. But my spider sense tells me that you people don't really care about me."
Spider-man tried to sneak a glass from the bar but Tony caught him and made him put it back. "Not until you're twenty-one, junior. Or whenever Cap's not present. Whatever ones first."
"Guess we are. We'll just have to be our own little family." Bucky clapped his metal hand on Iron Man's shoulder. "You know what? You used to scare me the most. But you're just a big softy."
Steve laughed, "he's adopted. And he's a lot nicer than Tony. Good kid. You'll like him. Although, he probably will kick you in the shins if you tick him off. You already met him. At the airport. Back in 2016."
"So the rumors are true. Stark does have a son," Osborn leaned forward, folding his hands neatly on his desk. "Are you around him often?"
"Hang onto your shorts," was the only warning Iron Man gave before blasting through the hole in the roof.
Steve gently pushed Henry towards the edge of his desk with a pencil, "I don't know what you're doing, but could you do it somewhere else? I have work to do!"
"I'm moving out," Peter said slowly. "Today." Between college, a job and his Spider-man responsibilities back in Queens, Peter had little time to spend at the compound. He was lucky if he had time to stop by on the weekends. Overall, having his home at the Avengers facility was more a hassle than a luxury.
Steve heard a light tapping coming from Tony's direction. The cyborg was tapping two metal fingers against his reactor. Steve moved closer to him, asking in a low voice, "something wrong with the reactor?"
"Yes, it's me. Usually, people check the caller ID before answering the phone," Harry Osborn laughed.
"Spider-man!" Steve shouted right as the Avenger in question sprinted across the room. He kicked off the couch and threw a snowball at Steve, hitting him in the back of the neck. Peter landed in a crouch, another snowball in his other hand. He was in full costume, complete with a heavy winter coat, the fur hood pulled over his head. Steve was also in winter clothing.
"No, we haven't! Use those rocket boots and go after them!" Steve snapped. He skidded to a halt next to Natasha, who had pulled over on the side of the highway and was also looking up at the armored Avenger. She had seen Wanda shoot a small ball of energy at Tony right before she swerved into the heavy traffic.
"What are you doing here, Banner?" The cell lights were off, a small figure huddled in the back corner behind the cot.
"You have a vivid imagination, Peter," Bruce's facial expression softened. "Clint is nothing but an asshole, just like all the others. All those idiots have superiority complexes, thinking they know what's best for us, for the world..." Bruce started walking again, "they don't. They know nothing. All they do is make everything worse. And hurt the people they claim to love," Bruce looked down at Peter, his eyes full of sadness.
Venom's eyes narrowed. "I did not want to do thissss." He kicked off the wall, launching himself right at MJ.
Steve stood in the doorway, watching Peter tearing the cushions off the many couches in the lounge. "Sooo...what's all this about."
"The kid go to his room or something?" Tony asked, stepping out of his armor and letting it walk itself back to the lab.
"Stark wasn't the one who did this," Steve pointed out the name at the bottom of the file. "I believe Doctor Banner owes us an explanation."
Peter didn't answer, his eyes not leaving the ceiling. Natasha followed his gaze. Henry was directly above them. The tarantula had run off when Spider-man became violent, but now it seems as though he has returned. Peter held up his hands and Henry dropped into his open palms. Peter pulled the spider close, not taking his eyes off him for even a second.
"Ow. Stop yelling." The eye pieces on Spider-man's mask enlarged and narrowed a few times before settling on their resting size. "Did we get him?"
"Not unless they leave the property. They're focussed on us for now," Steve advised. He was starting to get a bit worried. Well, he had already been worried when they had gotten the distress call from Pepper, but now he was worried for different reasons. How many bots did Obadiah make? Where was he anyway? Steve had lost sight of both Obadiah and Anthony.
Peter took a seat on his stool, bouncing both legs. His chest felt like it was going to explode. He took a deep breath, trying to calm down. He wasn't sure what he was nervous about. Henry made a chirping noise, trying to comfort his owner.
"I find that really hard to believe, considering how you were acting five seconds ago," Steve ran into the fray.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa!" Peter flipped over Venom. "Not cool! I've had my fair share of being a host for right now, please come back later!"
"Fine. I don't feel like arguing with you, Stark. I'm going with the others to help Clint." Steve headed back over to the group. Tony watched his team vanish into the woods, then he continued his search. He wasn't able to find his bag, but he did find the remnants of an Iron Man gauntlet, its repulsor still in tact. Tony slipped it onto his hand and stuffed his pockets with more spare parts he stumbled upon. The engineer zipped his jacket up all the way, hiding the fading light in his chest. His bag was long gone. As was the spare arc reactor. Just like all their other valuable weapons. Tony scanned the clearing one last time before going off in the direction his team had wandered.
Elsewhere, Tony was watching their interaction through the security cameras. At first, it looked like Peter was having a friendly conversation with a teammate. However, the way he booked it as soon as his pizza was ready, lead Tony to believe that the conversation was not all that friendly.
Bucky watched him work for a minute longer before settling down behind him. He took a small book, some sci-fi thing Clint had recommended, out of his jacket pocket. The two men leaned against one another's backs as they focused on their different tasks. They fell into the comfortable silence that Bucky was accustomed to whenever he visited Tony. According to Steve, Iron Man used to blast heavy metal in his workshop. But that was back when they lived in the tower. Bucky wondered why he stopped.
After several very long hours of panicking, Tony was able to calm down enough to slip back into his armor. He didn't want to be alone right now. And so, he left his secret workshop to go find the one person who never failed to make him feel better.
Tony huffed, "I'm not worried about it, I'm just asking. I think I have a right to know who my son is dating."
"How's my face?" Tony put his hands on his chin. "God, my beard probably looks awful. You got a razor I could borrow?" He ran his hands along his jaw. "Feels awful. Damn, I didn't know it could get this long."
A bit later, Tony found himself at the sight of Obediah's demise. The factory still stood. It was in shambles, and any useable equipment had long been removed, but standing none the less. The room that had housed the arc reactor was nothing by a shell.
Tony tightened his grip on the handle. He felt like his brain had been put in a blender with no lid. Conflicting thoughts seemed to spew out from all directions.
"I didn't. We're still talking about injuries. Although, that's not a very fun topic. Let's talk about something else. Like the fact that Thor blew up the toaster. Again. Someone needs to talk some sense into that man before my wires snap. I swear-"
Steve scanned the area, but couldn't find the actual Iron Man anywhere. He used the tablet Bruce had given him to take pictures of the cave, knowing that he could use this as evidence to clear his lover's name. Thor tapped his shoulder and pointed to the left. Steve looked over to see a man making his way through across the room. He had only ever seen this man in photos, and he looked like he had aged a bit since those were taken. But there was no denying his identity.
"Old friend, you have disappointed me greatly," Thor appeared out of nowhere, his hammer connecting with the Hulk's skull.
Tony's phone pinged with an alert from FRIDAY. Someone was on the Quinjet. "It's him," Tony said as he darted out the door, his team not far behind. Sure enough, they found Spider-man sitting in the pilot's chair, flicking switches and pushing buttons. The jet roared to life.
Tony cursed, "plan B!" He grabbed the bot by the shoulders and activated his uni-beam. The blast shot straight through the bot and even managed to take out a few behind it. A second wave of bots crashed through one of the remaining windows. "Shit."
"H-hey!" Spider-man barked when two men wrestled him away from Tony. They shoved him into the dirt and twisted his arms behind his back. A pair of handcuffs were tightened painfully around his wrists.
"This time?!" War Machine also threw his hands in the air. The Avengers looked between the two bots. This "War Machine" had to have also been one of Tony Stark's creations. Or maybe Iron Man had built him? The bots were too similar for there to not be a connection."Jesus! And what's this I hear about you trashing your workshop? Pepper told me everything, so don't play dumb." He jabbed an accusing finger at his fellow bot.
Steve took a seat next to him, sitting so close that their legs were almost touching. "We'll find him. For now, you really need to get some sleep."
Tony woke up several hours later, which pissed him off because he only meant to sleep for twenty minutes. Maybe thirty. He stood and stretched, mentally cycling through the list of what still needed to be done. He looked down at Peter, who was still fast asleep. Tony sighed and tucked a blanket around the kid.
"But I didn't. Peter's a good kid. I've been watching him closely." He paused for a moment, "well, as closely as I could. Him being adopted by Stark made it difficult for me to continue my research."
"Um...I forgot." Iron Man tilted his head back, staring at the ceiling for a moment before looking back over at Steve. "Something to do with my face. I think. I don't remember. Oh no! Did my face fall off?!" Iron Man slapped his hands over his faceplate.
"We have company!" Bruce called out. He was keeping an eye on the monitors, which had just picked up three other Quinjets.
Steve shook his head in disbelief. "Where will you go?" As far as the Avengers knew, Peter didn't have a stable home in Queens. He just had a ton of friends that let him sleep on their couches.
Darkness consumed his vision before he could respond. He was vaguely aware of Rhodey shouting at him to keep his eyes open.
Bucky shrugged. "You got captured. We've all been there. I know there wasn't much you could do about it." He undid his short ponytail, allowing his hair to be ruffled by the breeze. "Iron Man loves you." Bucky said suddenly, then added, "he probably would've burned down the entire world if that's what it took to find you."
Rhodey suddenly landed next to Tony, the noise he made when he landed caused Tony to flinch. "Hulk's gone, Banner got away...what the hell happened to you guys?"
Osborn frowned, "that's a difficult request. I left the wall crawler in the care of Kraven the Hunter. And he won't give up his prey without a fight."
Steve marched over and yanked the torch away. "Absolutely not." He smacked him in the back of the head for good measure.
"What are you talking about? You have no business being in Queens right now." Tony frowned. "Our focus is still on Scarlet Bitch and Oscar the Grouch. Not crime fighting in Queens. The team needs you at full strength so we can make our next move."
"Actually, I knew Peter before he was adopted. We went to the same school," Spider-man said quickly. "He's with Ned, by the way. He'll be back later."
"How come he never comes to me for advice?" Steve huffed. Tony could picture the pout on his husband's face.
Peter frowned and squished in between Steve and Natasha. It was a tight squeeze but he made it work. Peter had changed into more casual clothing, with his camera strung around his neck. Everyone had seen Spider-man with his camera at least once. But that was before they knew his identity. Now the camera was back. Steve asked to see it and Peter handed it over, making several people gasp. Spider-man never ever let anyone touch his camera. Not even Tony. Steve put down his drink so he could handle the camera with both hands.
Spidey wasn't quite sure where he was. It looked like an abandoned subway station. Where at though? He just knew that after he had called Michelle using Wanda's phone, the former Avenger tied him up and drug him down a dangerous looking staircase.
"Like I would listen to you, Stark," Michelle grumbled under her breath as she snuck out the main entrance of the workshop.
"He's just a man. He can't hurt anyone without his armor. Besides, I promised I'd let him see his son if he complied." Fury said, then went into the interrogation room. The agent hurried after and freed Stark from his handcuffs. Tony rubbed his sore wrists. Fury motioned for Tony to follow, and he did so without a word. Everyone eyed him warily as the two walked through the Helicarrier. They went to another level, where a small cell block was housed. Tony glanced around at his team, giving them apologetic looks. There were no bars on the cells, just strange blue energy fields.
"I take it the meeting didn't go well?" Bucky leaned against a tree, watching Steve aggressively chopping wood. The soldier hadn't even bothered to completely change out of his Captain America uniform, the top part of the uniform having been discarded on a log.
"Tony Stark, I feel like you have some explaining to do," Fury kicked what might have once been an earpiece. The round object bounced across the room and rolled under the tool cart. Fury sent Tony a death glare. Steve grabbed Tony's hand and gave it a squeeze. "Or Iron Man. Whatever the hell you go by these days."
Spider-man made his way through the woods, leaves crunching under his feet. The light was leading him up the mountain, to the same ledge he sat on earlier. The red light suddenly twinkled away into nothing.
"Ohmygod, I thought Steve was joking when he said you listened to heavy metal..." Bruce gaped. Iron Man was in an usually good mood today and had let the team into his workshop. Mostly so he could test out some gadgets he had made for them.
Spider-man just stared blankly at him. Sparks shot out from what was left of the extra limbs on his back.
Steve let out a deep sigh. "They've been after him ever since the army found him wandering the desert. They wanted to take him apart and study him. But Rhodes and Pepper wouldn't allow that. When they couldn't have their way with Iron Man, they started viewing him as an active threat and did everything in their power to shut him down. Fury put him on the Avengers team without their consent."
Iron Man crashed back down a bit later. The bot that had grabbed him was in pieces. By the looks of it, a few other bots had attacked him while he was airborne. His right leg was badly damaged, as well as his shoulder and part of his breastplate.
"Don't worry about it, Stark. It doesn't concern you." There was another noise mixed in with Bruce's voice. It sounded like he was typing. "You've put a lot of effort into keeping Peter safe. You've done a terrible job of it, but you
"It was an accident, Peter. It wasn't your fault." Tony sighed. "It's my fault. I should've been more careful. I shouldn't have put you in that situation."
Rhodey nodded, "and who was this person who was helping you out from the inside? Or was that a lie, too?"
"There weren't. Everything I needed to fix this was in my bag. Which got lost when the jet fell apart. There's nothing any of you can do. Not right now." Tony looked away.
you touch Cap! I'm going to rip you apart! Melt you down to nothing! Do you hear me?!" Tony attacked from behind, grabbing the faceplate with his metal hand and ripping it clean off. There was no one inside.
Peter looked up from his phone at the Asgardian. Thor stood next to the couch, looking at Peter with the most sincere expression. "What did you do? Break the toaster?" Peter chuckled.
"The fuck was that all about?" Clint tried to be serious, but couldn't help the small giggles escaping him.
Steve studied the chart, looking to see what parts Iron Man wanted to be taken off, before picking up a screwdriver and getting to work. He took off the faceplate first. The metal wasn't as durable as Iron Man's and came off with little to no effort. The inside looked like a computer, with wires and circuitry. It was nothing like what Steve had seen when Iron Man cracked his own helmet. He distinctly remembered the metal plates that formed the shape of a human face and a glowing circle in the eye socket. "It's different."
Iron Man slowly looked back at his teammates. They were all staring at him in horror. Steve had a look on his face that could only be described as broken. Bucky refused to look at him.
"I wish to help Stark," Thor declared. Bruce's eyebrows shot up, having not expected that. "As disappointed in our robot-"
"I'm coming with him," MJ took Peter's hand. Peter gave her hand a loving squeeze. "And you can't stop me."
"Twenty more inbounds," Natasha was the one to report this time. Tony had been told to come alone, but that didn't stop the rest of the team from tagging along and hiding in the cemetery. True to her word, twenty more goblin-like creatures on gliders were heading right for them.
"Yeah. Sure. Whatever. The usual, please." Peter slid a couple crumpled ones through the window. The man grumbled and went about making his order.
It didn't take long for Steve to find his teammate. The man was sitting on the front steps with a drink in one hand and a cell phone in the other.
Vision moved closer to the doctor, "you are saying that this is a trap? We must inform Captain Rogers-"
"There were no casualties. No injuries. No destroyed property other than that one building. The aliens were barely a threat. More annoying than anything-"
"I suppose he can be a bit of a handful," Steve shrugged, not looking up from his book. "You weren't around when he actually lived here. I'm surprised this place didn't burn down."
Iron Man shot ahead and landed in the middle of the highway. The asphalt cracked under his feet. Cars blared their horns and swerved to avoid him. Headlight's reflected off his armor as they did so. He held his ground, repulsor raised. "SPIDER-MAN. STOP."
I don't have much of a plan for this. I have a general outline for this story, but that's it. If you guys have any ideas please let me know!
"Yes. I did. It's fine. Really." The coffee was finally ready. Tony took a random mug from the cabinet and filled it to the brim. He used to take his coffee with extra sugar. That was before he had unmasked himself, though. Now he just drank it black.
"I need your help! SHIELD is after me! They think-ARGH!!" An anti-aircraft gun blasted Tony out of the sky before he could finish. He crashed with a boom, the pavement cracking under him. Tony's vision swam for a moment. He then realized how dangerously close he was to the edge. The ocean churned far below, the storm wreaking havoc on the waves.
Sunlight filtered in through the blinds of the work shop. Tony stumbled over to the couch, in desperate need of sleep. His eyes were barely open and he was finding his way to the couch through touch.
"Where are we going?" Peter was slumped down in the seat, his feet up on the dash. Usually, Tony would have shoved his feet off and scolded him. Yet Tony just couldn't bring himself to do so.
"Hey, Cap, are you gonna make a robot-" Peter cut himself off, shying back ever so slightly, "why are you looking at me like that?"
"Don't know. He was pissy for no reason yesterday. And now he's avoiding me." Peter motioned to Tony's empty work bench. The engineer always spent his mornings in the lab, especially if Peter was there with him. "Did I do something wrong?"
"Fine," Tony took a deep breath and punched a button. Metallic whirring filled his ears as the ramp lowered. He held the shield close to his chest, finding comfort in the object. "Alright. No armor. Just my boyfriend's shield and the repulsors in my prosthetics...you can do this, Stark." He puffed out his chest as he took a deep breath. "Let's get our family back, Jarvis." With that, he charged across the deck. Shield held at his side, and his right hand extended, repulsor at the ready.
"Tony..." Steve choked out, powerless to do anything but watch as Spider-man grabbed Tony by the shirt and raised him up out of the suit. His feet barely brushed the ground. Tony looked absolutely defeated. Spider-man raised his one remaining spider arm. It was poised to strike at Tony's throat. He looked down at Peter, his eyes empty.
"There was a breakout at the Raft. Scarlet Witch has escaped." Tony said with absolutely no emotion. The background voices fell silent.
Meanwhile, one of the screens at Tony's desk started flashing with the words "AI Creation Successful".
"It would appear so," Obadiah smiled. "I'm surprised you actually showed up, Iron Man. I guess I made the right choice in threatening the life of your precious Captain."
"Where's Steve?" The armor was deadweight, and it took a lot of effort for him to sit up. Tony grunted at the strain. Moving hurt. Everything hurt and his head was pounding. But his arc reactor was back where it should be. The rest he could deal with later.
Iron Man's body moved in jerky motions as he got his feet. Sparks sprayed from the cracked eyepiece in his helmet.
"You told me to keep my distance. So here I am, putting distance between us." He made a dramatic sweeping motion with his arms.
"Fury, you know me. You know I wouldn't go around killing people for the hell of it." Iron Man motioned wildly with his hands, desperately trying to get Fury to see reason.
"No. I'm sorry you got hurt. Two months ago. I should've done something. Should've stepped in before it got that bad," Steve whispered. His hand traveled up to cup Iron Man's cheek.
"We're not going anywhere, buddy." Tony sat on the floor next to the bed. "How's this? Is this alright? Too close?"
All because of Tony. All because Tony decided to put a little faith in them by exposing his true face. He should've waited for his suit to arrive before he stormed the Hellicarrier. The team wouldn't have died in the twenty minutes that it had taken for the mark 43 to catch up to him. Tony would give anything to go back a few weeks. Undo everything. Go back to being a robot. At least then Steve would still love him.
"And you get way too much joy out of antagonizing people," Steve shook his head. "Try and get this place cleaned up before Nat sees it."
"Yeah, no. She answers to me, not you," Tony waved a wrench at the wallcrawler. "I want that thing out of here as soon as you find it."
"Maybe not. But he believes he helped in Chicago. Even though all our sources say he was the one who started the fire. He was also unaware of similar incidents in L.A. and Kansas City." The agent shrugged.
Steve looked back to see his robot flying after them. Iron Man was literally falling to pieces after only minutes of fighting Obadiah, his already damaged jet boot was sputtering out, compromising his flight. The distance between them was growing at an alarming rate. Steve started fighting back, knowing Iron Man would catch him when he fell.
"Shh..." Red light gathered around her fingers as she brushed his hair. One memory. Just one good memory to balance it all out. But which one? Wanda sighed and dipped her head. His birthday. That seemed like the best option. "No," she said aloud. A positive memory of Tony Stark might conflict too much with how Peter currently viewed his father. Instead, she opted to give him a memory of him and Clint hanging out. She allowed Peter to recall an entire day spent with the Archer. "There you go, little one..." She smiled as Peter relaxed. Wanda carefully pulled another blanket over Peter and kissed his forehead.
Clint followed his gaze to the tree, "Thor was excited to put it up, and we couldn't say no to him so...yeah." He clapped his hands together. Last Christmas, the Avengers had still been living in the tower. It was just the six of them back then, and they had all taken time out of their day to put the tree up together. It had taken hours due to them goofing around. They spent more time sticking ornaments on Iron Man than they did the actual tree. And then it was a whole other ordeal to get the damn things off him. Not because they were stuck, the ornaments were hanging loosely from the niches in his armor, some of them falling off at the slightest movement. It was hard to get the majority of them off him because Iron Man thought it was hilarious and wanted to keep wearing them. Especially the tensile wreath Thor had put around his neck. At one point Steve was convinced that Iron Man would never let the team take it from him. Steve smiled fondly at the memory.
The dragon had left him in the dungeon a few hours ago. At least Steve assumed it had been a few hours. It felt like he had been sitting still for a very long time. His kidnapper was still nearby, it's heavy footsteps and deep breathing echoing through the building. The echoing made it impossible to pinpoint where exactly the beast was. There was a large arched doorway at the other end of the room. The only exit. Steve could make a break for it now if he wanted, but the beast was more than likely waiting for him in the corridors beyond.
"Five more minutes," Peter wrapped himself around her. Michelle reached back and ran a hand through his hair. It was a Sunday, and neither of them had work. Michelle put her book on the pillow and rolled over, snuggling up to her boyfriend. "I love you," he kissed her forehead.
"Trust issues," Tony said shortly. Spider-man crawled backward, pushing himself against the glass. "Get down here!"
Before Tony could answer, Spider-man sprung to life, kicking the suit in the chest and sending it crashing onto its back. The wall-crawler plunged his fist into the arc reactor, destroying it in one blow. The suit whirred, its eyes blinking, then going blank for good.
Clint stole the waste basket from by the front door and handed it to his teammate. Tony took several deep breaths. After a few minutes, he set down the trash can and put his head in his hands.
"Iron Man! Iron Man, come in!" Bucky yelled into his comm. He and Steve raced down several flights of steps. The last thing they heard from the robot was him saying that there was a problem. Then the line went dead. That had been almost twenty minutes ago. Twenty minutes were literally anything could have happened to their friend. They were both starting to panic.
Tony put everything he had into his boots, shooting out of the bots grip, then making a sharp turn and crashing into him. He was able to deliver several punches and few repulsor blasts before the bot grabbed him by the throat and flew out of the parking garage. Tony squirmed out of his grasp. From there the battle became airborne. Tony gave his all, but nothing he did seemed to weaken the other bot. "Okay, time for a nap." He grabbed onto the robot's torso and flew downwards. The flaps on his shoulder blades lifted up, freeing the boosters and quickening his decent.
"Okay, geez, I'll go ask Vision," Peter slammed his textbook shut. He turned to leave only for Tony to grab him by the throat and slam him into the table. Peter clawed at Tony's hands, "I-I'm...S-sorry-" his eyes were wide with fear.
"From scratch?" Tony blinked. "It took me a few days to put the original together after I finished the design."
“I’m sorry,” was all Steve could think to say. He rubbed his thumb over Tony’s cheek, tracing one of the many scars the Jericho had left on his body. Both men jumped when the door was kicked open.
"You can't control who lives and dies, Tony." Spider-man refused to meet his gaze. The tension in the air was so thick you could cut it with a knife.
"Eyes on me, Shellhead," Natasha aimed a kick at Tony's ribs. He jumped out of the way just in time.
"Humans age faster than I thought," Thor mused. "Who is the child's mother? Pepper? Or Steve? I don't know much about human biology but-" He stopped talking when Clint choked on his drink.
"Sorry, just having a few trust issues after one of my closest friends tortured my son." Tony huffed, waving his hand, palm up.
"Our 'boss' has their heart set on this mission. I agree with you, but we aren't exactly in charge here," Octavius pointed out. "Where is that bastard anyway? He should be here to discuss this with all of us. We can't take down the Avengers without proper communication."
"I...I understand..." Tony whimpered. "I get it...who could stand being around a fuck up like me? Can't do anything right. Ruined the one good thing in my life." The tears started rolling down his cheek before he could stop them.
Peter froze. His spider sense had never spoken to him before. Or maybe it was his own thoughts? He was in too much pain to fully comprehend what was happening. Another dark thought crept into his mind. Memories flashed before his eyes. Memories of Tony Stark showing up on his doorstep, telling him that Aunt May wouldn't be coming home. And that Peter needed to come with him.
"Why come to us if you don't trust us?" Natasha pried his fingers away from the gun and set it aside.
Tony glared at his reflection. He thought shaving would help him feel more like himself. For some reason, it didn't. He squinted his eyes at his image, trying to figure out what about his appearance made him feel so disgusted. His cybernetic eye was pretty fucked up, but that wasn't the reason. "Oh." It clicked in his head. He was looking at Tony Stark's reflection. He didn't feel like Tony Stark anymore. Tony Stark didn't make it out of that AIM facility. Whoever Tony was now, was not the person he had been three months ago. The person he was three months ago wouldn't have murdered those people. His reflection was a painful reminder of that. The cyborg went back out into the bedroom, making a beeline to where the armor was leaned against the wall. He knelt down and studied the helmet. "Hmm..." Tony plucked the object and carried it back to the bathroom. Putting it on, he looked at his reflection once more. This felt right. Seeing Iron Man's face instead of his own felt right. This was what he was meant to see. What everyone was meant to see. Tony's fingertips brushed over the earpieces of the helmet. "I am Iron Man."
"Going to stay awake this time?" Kraven stepped towards him and shined a light in his eyes. Peter hissed and pulled away. "Eyes look normal. Good. Glad I didn't completely fry your brains out."
Spider-man shook his head and spoke slowly, "No. She's alive. Just unconscious. And in SHIELD custody. I think we should regroup." He looked up at the sound of Iron Man's repulsors. The armored Avenger was slowly drifting down. He cut the thrusters and dropped the remaining few feet with a loud thud.
One last thing, are there any spider-man villains you would like to see in the next few chapters? I am open to suggestions.
Steve scrolled through the pictures. Natasha leaned over Peter to try and get a good look. Peter doubled over so he was almost flat against his thighs, allowing her to get a better view of the camera. The pictures mostly consisted of odd moments in time. A pigeon pecking at a hot dog, the tiny bit of meat it had grabbed a blur of red in the air. A dog using a crosswalk. A couple arguing next to a newsstand. A kind looking old man who was in the middle of speaking to Peter when the teen took the photo. A cat washing itself on a fire escape. Steve tilted his head at the image of a woman with long brown hair. She was in a kitchen, making what looked like Christmas cookies, her face crinkled with laughter. She looked young, but the lines under her eyes told a different story. Her hair color was similar to that of Peter's.
All was silent now. The Avengers were scattered around the room, in various states of exhaustion and shock. Peter had been brought to the med bay nearly five hours ago. It hadn't taken Bruce long to figure out that Peter had been gassed with something that caused his spider sense to go out of control, seeing nearly everything as a threat. It had taken Bruce and Tony four hours to figure out an antidote. In that time, Peter had screamed himself mute and attacked anyone who got close to him. They ended up having to tie him down. Even with the threat of attack gone, he was still tied down to the table.
Metal clashed against metal. Sparks flew. Repulsors whirred. Everything was happening in flashes of color and sound. The larger bot grabbed Iron Man by the throat and slammed him into the pavement, its free hand wrapped around Iron Man's head. The metal creaked under its fingers, dents starting to take shape. Iron Man thrashed underneath him.
"He worked for SHIELD. Him and your mother. Did you know that?" Tony said, walking around the couches.
"Am I needed back at the compound?" Peter frowned. A horrible feeling of dread bubbled up deep inside him.
"Shit." Steve cursed, Peter had ripped the grate off a different vent and crawled into the air duct. He was the only Avenger small enough to fit through the vents, so there was no going after him. "Split up! He can't stay in there forever!" Steve ordered, "Vision, is there anything you can do?"
"If this gets worse, you better tell me. Or I'll beat your ass." Natasha poked him in the middle of his chest.
"You have a son?" Steve looked Tony dead in the eye. "You have a son. And you didn't tell any of us?" The entire team was gathered in the kitchen at the Avengers compound. They had all been having breakfast when Happy walked in, asking where 'the kid' was, and why he wasn't answering his phone. This prompted a lot of "what kid?" questions and Tony had no choice but to tell his teammates the truth. Happy quickly left the room, not wanting to be a part of what was about to go down.
"I repeat, Harry is not a bad person," Peter pulled at his hair. "He doesn't even know his dad is the Green Goblin."
Tony sighed, rolling to a stop at a red light. This would be a lot easier if the tracker in the Iron Spider suit hadn't been damaged in the explosion. The search had been going on for quite awhile and the sun had long set. Tony decided he would stop at the next parking lot and put on his armor. Steve had warned him against doing so right off the bat, due to the nature of Tony's injuries, as well as the fact that you could hear the suit from miles away. Tony looked over at the sound of engines rumbling. Three dark motorcycles slid to a halt in the lane next to them. A man was on the first one, while a woman and a younger man sat on the others. The two adults wore dark clothes, and all three had on helmets that masked their faces. Yet they looked...familiar.
Iron Man stared at him for a minute, then tugged on a latch that made the gauntlet fold open. He used the screwdriver to point to various parts as he explained how it worked. He expected Steve to get bored and leave, but Steve remained at his side, completely fascinated by Iron Man's words. Iron Man wasn't sure when Steve had laid his head against his shoulder, but he made no move to push the soldier away.
"I just got word from Natasha. She found something that could prove Iron Man's innocence." Bruce reported.
"Damn bastards!" Iron Man's snarl was directed at the Hydra agents, not Bucky and Steve. It was just the three of them on a mission, raiding a Hydra facility that SHIELD had uncovered up north.
Tony had passed away in his sleep almost a year ago. In a way Peter was glad. Because it meant Tony hadn't suffered. He hadn't had to spend his last moments in a cold suit of armor, fighting for his life. He died in his husband's arms, under a peaceful sleep. Peter was pretty sure Tony knew he wouldn't wake up that morning. The night before, he had called Peter, just to chat. There was none of the normal bickering between the two of them during that call. No insults, no teasing. Just chatting. Tony told Peter how much he meant to him. How much he had changed his world. And that he was proud of him. And that was it. Tony went to bed. And his heart gave out.
Steve looked down at the bolt in his hand, running his gloved thumb over the red paint on the end. After two months, he couldn't find it in him to be mad at Tony anymore. They were still going to have a serious talk when they found him, but that was the least of his concerns. The wrongs they had done to each other seemed so small now. Tony was missing. Obadiah was still alive. They had figured that out a few weeks ago. Tony could be bleeding out in a ditch somewhere. He could already be dead. It was a very high possibility. And Steve felt sick just thinking about it. He didn't care about the lies Tony had told anymore. Didn't care about trying to make their relationship work. He just wanted to find Tony. Steve needed to know that he was alive. That he was breathing. That was all that mattered at this point in time.
Natasha put on the autopilot and slumped in her chair. "That's enough excitement for one day..." She looked over her shoulder to see her teammates crowding around War Machine, who was still holding Iron Man in his arms. The robot's eyes were dark. Natasha grimaced at the damage done to his armor. War Machine carefully laid Iron Man out on the floor.
"You want to see aggressive?!" Iron Man snarled. "I'll show you aggressive!" He ripped apart a bot's chest with his hands. The next second he was blasting up to Obadiah.
Everything up until Tony leaves the Avengers in chapter 9 remains exactly the same. The events from then onward are now extremely different. This rewrite will be putting the story back on track with the plot that was originally intended.
"I am now," Tony whispered, cupping Peter's face with one hand and brushing his thumb over his cheek. Steve nodded and left without another word. Tony gently pulled the blanket away from one of Peter's arms. No web shooter. Tony eased the glove off his hand, his shoulders sagging upon seeing the scar. He looked back up at Peter's face. Tiny scars danced unevenly around his mouth. So small that the average person wouldn't notice them. But Tony wasn't the average person. He distinctively remembered that part of the thread had ripped through Peter's lips when he had attempted to speak. A long scar marked where that had happened, slicing right through the side of his mouth. "I'm going to make them pay, Peter. I promise."
Bucky cut Rhodey off by speaking to Tony. "Tones, you want to go home, don't you?" The cyborg nodded. "See, he want's to go home. And he has every right to."
"You thought you killed me? Cute." Obediah laughed. "No, you see when the arc reactor blew, I was sent...elsewhere."
"I'm fine, Steve," Iron Man's eyes flashed. Steve frowned and tapped his knuckles on the side of the helmet. Tony didn't seem to get the message, so he did it again. "What?"
Steve threw a hand out to brace himself against the wall. A second explosion knocked Clint over. He cursed loudly when he hit the ground.
"You don't know that!" Steve shot back. Tony forced himself to look up at Steve, ignoring the pain that shot through his neck when he did so. Was the super soldier really defending him? "I know Iron Man. He's not a killer." He sent Iron Man a reassuring smile.
"AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!" Steve let out his battle cry as he charged into the house, the team hot on his heels. He flung his shield, the sheer force taking one of the bots heads clean off. He kicked another square in the chest, knocking it out the window. The soldier recalled his shield, spun around and smashed it into the reactor of a third bot.
anyone trust you, doc," Adrian leaned against the counter. "Try not to be so intimidating. You're freaking out the kid."
Spider-man thrashed under Bruce's weight. "Haven't you guys fucked with me enough?! You've cut me open, changed my biology, sewed my fucking mouth shut-" Peter's voice cracked. "I-I'm not your play thing! You can't just mold me to your liking! That's what play-doh is for-"
"You're like a wild animal. So aggressive," Obadiah chided, he hovered about fifty feet above Iron Man, watching him rip apart the bots. "So emotional. Jeez."
Spidey shifted around and discovered that his wrists were bound behind his back. His ankles were in a similar state. His costume provided little protection from the cold metal. Tired crackled as they rolled over gravel. It was had to tell in the dark, but he was fairly certain he was in the back of a truck. The only source of light in the cramped area came from the faint red glow emitted by the cuffs.
"What?" Peter glanced back. Tony sat down next to him, looping an arm around his shoulders and pulling him close. "I'd never hurt you, Petey. You know that right?" He leaned his head against Peter's.
"A little help here, Stark!!" Steve yelled, narrowly avoiding getting his throat torn apart by Venom's claws.
"Did he make them for you or did you steal them when he wasn't looking?" Tony put his welding torch down and turned his entire body to face Peter.
Tony currently lay on his back in his workshop, wearing nothing but his boxers. He held his prosthetic hand up, inspecting the fine details in the pale sunlight. He sighed and sat up. He caught a glimpse of his reflection in the window and suddenly found himself unable to look away. His eyes traveled down his own body, looking at the metal that had overtaken the right side. The side the Jericho had claimed when it blew up next to him. He tore his gaze away from the mirror and looked down at his legs. One being almost completely gone, and the other ending just above the knee. At least he still had his left arm. He kept reminding himself of that everything he got caught up in his injuries. And most of his face. Speaking of which...
Tony let out a shocked cry when the HUD suddenly flickered out. And then he was falling, crashing through trees, being beaten this way and that. He hit the ground and bounced along the snow several yards before sliding to a halt. His head bumped against a light post.
Steve didn't know what had gone down in the training room that day, but the next day Bucky was acting a bit more confident. He was branching out and talking more with the others. Especially Iron Man. A few days later Steve had found the two in the library, enthusiastically discussing rock music. He had seen Iron Man act this way before. If anyone even uttered the word 'science' around him, the bot would go on hour long tangents. But Steve had never seen Bucky this excited to have a conversation. Or this happy. Not since before the war.
"I didn't, though. Not in the beginning. Sure, we saved the world from an alien invasion. But that didn't mean I could trust you. Especially since two of you were known double agents. I just couldn't take my chances," Tony shrugged.
I saw Homecoming last night and just had to write a fic for it. Spider-man homecoming is officially my favorite Marvel movie and I love everything about it. I'm taking my brother to see it tomorrow and I can't wait. Have you guys seen it?
"Peter turns twenty next month. I'm sure Tony has a big party planned at the compound. Booze will most likely be involved. Everyone's guards will be down."
"Not dead yet, so that's that," Iron Man groaned. They had laid him out on the couch as soon as they arrived. Rhodey wouldn't be able to patch him up with the others breathing down his neck. It was obvious that Tony was in pain, But Rhodey wasn't too worried. His scans showed that Tony wasn't in need of any immediate medical attention.

Tony felt like his head had been ripped from his body and kept poking at it to make sure it was still attached. Steve took hold of one of his hands when he made a move to do so again. Steve's other hand hovered over Iron Man's throat, gentle fingers fluttering over the cuts. The motor oil had turned everything black, and he couldn't get a good look at the damage. "I'm okay, Steve," Tony whispered, noticing the concerned look on his friend's face.
