But for some reason, I find that I'm able to cope with that reality.
''But,'' I try to phrase my concern in a way that cannot be pushed aside as irrelevant to the whole, ''he doesn't see that he needs help. Not really. He's denying what he needs and I don't know what I can do to make him see. To make him want to change! I've tried being patient with him, and I've definitely gotten angry with him. I even threatened to call his brother. He detests talking to his brother about things like this. Nothing's worked.''
''I'm wondering if I can put in an order for two baskets of chips. Say, medium for both? And a Coke for myself. Sherlock?,'' Yuri asks suddenly, ''Want something to drink?''
I study my pen, pull it close, then glance back up to the tense man before me.
I smile, despite the subject matter.
''You don't have to do that,'' Sherlock murmurs. ''Forget I said anything.''
''Alright,'' he mutters after a pause, the heat of earlier displaced somewhat into this; whatever 'this' is.
''You didn't trigger this, John. He's been at the edge for a very long time.''
''Sherlock-''
''Molly,'' he breathes. ''I have a friend - I guess she might consider me a friend - named Molly.''
"How about we be the judge of that for ourselves?" - Sally, this time.
''You should let him know that,'' I say thickly. ''He doesn't hear it enough.''
My body shifts against the chesterfield, and I open my eyes gently, rub the grit from them.
"What?"
He feeds me, and I let him.
'You think of a number, say 100 - and you subtract a number. Like seven. You keep going, whenever you are scared, and you won't be as scared. You never stop, okay Sherlock? Just keep counting until everything is okay again.'
''So you are trying to lose weight,'' I say with determination.
Over the top for a children's room.
Iris smiles brightly, his eyes shining with kindness and sympathy. “We’re fine John. We’re
In his head John starts analyzing how the detective has been treating him these past few days. He hadn’t kicked him out of the flat, hadn’t yelled past that first night and was acting no different than his usual strange self since the moment John walked back through that door. If anything, Sherlock had said many things along the lines of forgiving the Alpha, but he hadn’t taken them that way in the moment.
be, yeah. Lucky for you, I’ve been more than a little unemployed.” John looks to the small television that is currently off.
With a flick of his wrist, Sherlock quickens his pace while keeping his previously steady grip on his pup’s cock. He slides smoothly up and down the shaft, setting a steady rhythm that has Iris’s breath quickening, his abs tightening up, and his back starting to arch. Behind him, John notices the change and circles his prostate once more before putting pressure on it fully, rocking his fingers as if it’s his cock shoving against it itself. It only takes a few more relentless strokes before Iris throws his head back, nails digging into Sherlock’s skin, as he comes fast and hard all over his father’s fingers, crying out with stuttering breathes. His rim bares down on the Alpha’s fingers and John groans knowing that soon enough that same pressure is going to be gripping the base of his knot.
Thank you for continuing to enjoy my fic. <3
Jim bites his lip, disappointed. “Oh. Did I really make such a fleeting impression? But then, I suppose, that
“Any ideas?” Lestrade asks as Iris starts to circle the body.
Reaching the bottom of the stairs to his bedroom, John begins running up them before seeing Sherlock barreling down toward him. The sight of his new mate calms his Alpha for a moment as he looks him over, doctor mode kicking in. Sherlock seems to be fine, no blood or broken bones but he’s clearly panicked as he has his arms held out, palms facing John, shaking them back and forth as if to say ‘don’t come closer’. He takes another step up, wanting to get closer and calm him, but that just makes Sherlock cry out.
was unmated. Moriarty’s plan
“Oh…” It takes a moment but the word poison finally sticks out in his mind. “Wait, are you saying he was murdered?” The flash of something resembling joy crosses over the detective’s face, as John finally understands what he’s trying to say.
pounds.” Iris moves closer to John as they both watch the back and forth between the Alpha and Omega as they talk about the painting and an assassin named The Golem. It isn’t until Sherlock and Lestrade are getting a little off topic with insults that John steps in.
“Nope.” John says shaking his head, his mouth downturned.
“Enjoying yourself back there.” Sherlock says and John can tell he’s smiling.
“Can’t...can’t reach.”
It doesn’t take long for him to piece together the puzzle in his mind. The brother doesn’t seem very sad about his sister’s death and the annoying hairless cat walking around would be a genius way to inject the poison into the women unknowingly. The brother gets all her money and by the way he looked and talked about the Raoul, John suspects they may have both been in on it. In fact, when he sits way too close to the Alpha, John’s instinct tells him that he’s barking up the right tree. The right, ‘I’m definitely the killer’ tree.
Another door toward the back of the pool squeaks open and a man stands there obscured from view. “I gave you my number” He says in a strange pitiful voice. “I thought you might call.” Sherlock tries to get a small glimpse, thinking Moriarty will hide himself from view the whole time but he doesn’t instead the man steps fully through the door letting it close behind him. He’s dressed in a full suit and tie, expensive quality and perfectly tailored. What’s more shocking about him however, is that he’s the man that Molly introduced as her boyfriend just a few short days ago. Sherlock had dismissed him easily at the time, too swept up in the bomber case to pay attention to a new person. He had made quick deductions from the supposed Betas clothes and looks. It’s possible he wasn’t even a Beta, for all Sherlock knew he could be any of the secondary genders. Moriarty was clearly able to fool him, which means he’s more dangerous than Sherlock originally thought he would be.
“He’s been in the river a long while. The water’s destroyed most of the data.” Sherlock says louder prompting everyone to look at him. “But I’ll tell you one thing: that lost Vermeer painting’s a fake.” He confidently smiles at his deduction.
“Good night.” John says, getting up. Sherlock doesn’t acknowledge him, but Iris does in a small voice, as if he’s afraid that he shouldn’t be speaking with the Alpha. It pains John to see him look so put out, as if he’s being monitored for any bad behavior and he could be punished again for stepping out of line. But he’s not Iris’s dad and Sherlock hasn’t talked to him yet, so with a small reassuring smile, he leaves to his room.
“Oh. Hmm, that.” Jim gets closer to Sherlock turning his back on John and taking the thumb drive between two fingers. Sherlock tries to get a whiff of Moriarty’s scent, but there’s nothing there. But it’s not like a Beta, Betas still have scent, just mild. No this is different, it’s not a masked scent it’s a complete absence of any unique smell. “The missile plans!” He kisses the thumb drive, then chucks it to the side into the pool. “Boring!” Sherlock watches for just a moment as the plans sink. “
Sherlock is able to wrap one hand around the Alpha’s palm, digging his nails into the rough flesh, gripping on for dear life as he gets rammed into. He’s flushed and panting, drooling from the side of his mouth and onto the table as he moans with each luxurious thrust. The pain of his heat finally giving way as John fucks into him, hitting all the spots that he could never reach during his heats, his fingers nothing in comparison to the Alpha’s cock splitting him open. Filling him fuller than he ever dreamed possible.
“We’re going to both fit you’re knot perfectly.” Sherlock says and it’s like he’s reading John’s mind. But it’s just the detective in Sherlock finding it’s way into the situation, saying out loud what is playing out on John’s face, the Omega reading him like an open book.
“G-Good.” Iris barely gets out, his head swimming in Alpha and Omega pheromones, his hole swallowing John’s cock, keeping him coated in thick slick, his tight hole tempting the Alpha to finish, but John is in control.
been idle.” Sherlock says to John, hoping into the cab, which John follows him into immediately. Ever following the detective.
“Well alright.”
“The scent still needs to be broken for his safety and I would have mated him then, because
“Do it Alpha. Knot him, make him all yours.” Sherlock nibbles at Iris’s neck and shoulder.
The Omega below him sighs and grips onto him before starting to rock his own hips to the beat he’s started. It’s gentle and John pulls back to watch Sherlock’s face. He’s never seen the detective enjoy something like this before, only seen him happy about solving cases or finally having something ‘fun’ to be doing involving murder. So, when he sees Sherlock for the first time, he almost feels like crying at how beautiful he looks. His cheeks are flushed red, his mouth hanging open, eyes closed with a look of bliss. John keeps watching, sees the little changes in the Omega’s face as he pushes deeper. He leans over and kisses beside that open mouth and Sherlock chases the feeling, bringing his mouth to John’s, connecting them together once again.
He releases his grip on the teen’s hips and gently rubs his hands along the two Omega’s stomachs. They’re both round and full, his Alpha hums pleased with his success. As he rubs them both, he feels Sherlock’s cock hard against his hand, his mate hasn’t gotten off yet and he vows to fix that, soon as he can.
In the cab Sherlock gets text after text from Iris and John does his best to add what he saw. He knows it’s probably not as important as what Iris is saying, but he tries, talking about the message left for the dead man on the land line.
to you?” Sherlock asks, observing John.
“No. We had a break-in, though.” She says and John shoots up from his bent over position.
. I want to maybe court him one day, but I didn’t want that before I took my chance with you. I —I’m sorry Sherlock. I didn’t mean to try and mate the Omega at the clinic. I was so overcome, he looked exactly like Iris, he smelled so similar and the virgin scent just over took me. This is why I wanted to talk to you before we mated, I didn’t want you to know how unworthy of a mate I was for almost falling into the trap. Moriarty was right. I should just be neutered like a dog. How could I ever be a good mate to either of you?” John shakes his head, tears suddenly falling from his eyes.
“Will always take care of you both.” John kisses back.
“You took care of my pup. Kept him safe and comfortable.” Sherlock says between kisses on John’s lips and his cheeks.
have worked but —.” John’s face softens.
He's able to convince Kenny that he needs a picture and would like to get his photographer out here. It doesn’t take much more than a compliment about the lovely home and how the Beta himself would look quite handsome in the paper. He calls Sherlock, telling him to bring a camera and to pretend to be a photographer for a newspaper. Meanwhile, Kenny goes upstairs and freshens up. John snoops around a bit, but doesn’t get far as Raoul is right there. He once again falls back on a compliment about how lovely the house is and how he wanted to have a look around.
“Nice touch, this: the pool where little Carl died. I stopped him.” Sherlock is only a few feet away now from John. The Alpha pauses for a moment, composing himself. “I can stop John Watson too.” John looks down at the red dot. “Stop his heart.” John licks his lips, then swallows.
“Is that it? No habits, hobbies, personality?” Iris finally walks up beside him but the detective is leaving, walking over to a homeless woman, John notices it’s the same one from earlier in the day.
“W-What? Heat. But, but John said it would still be
-----
“Did he?” Sherlock questions.
Reluctantly pulling the rest of the way off, he sits up and strips his sweater off with abandon. His dress shirt fares worse when he rips it off, buttons be damned, he’s too impatient to undress properly right now especially with the way the detective is looking up at him, hair a messy halo of dark curls and eyes begging him to come back and finish what he started. But John hesitates instead staying still, willing his Alpha to calm down so he can drink in the marvelous sight below him. Sherlock looks up at him and licks his lips appreciatingly, staring up at the strong Alpha above him. But then looks a little confused when the Alpha doesn’t immediately pounce back on him. John looks down at the Omega’s shirt and back up with a cocky raise of his eyebrow. Suddenly, the detective’s hands are flying to his own shirt buttons in fear that they will end up like John’s which are now scattered over the bed. The Alpha just grins down at him darkly, watching as more and more beautiful pale skin is slowly revealed with the removal of each pesky button. The dark shirt falls to either side of Sherlock’s chest, letting John get his first look at his soon to be mate.
“And you’ve stolen another voice, I presume.” John’s blood runs cold. That can only mean that another hostage like the crying women has been taken. Tied up with explosives and forced to talk to them, but where they likely won’t know until Sherlock solves the puzzle.
The video shows an episode of Connie’s makeover show, the brother and sister are on stage talking about how pale he is after his recent vacation. Which he then claims is because it rained every day, so he got no sun. By the end of the video Connie is beating on her Beta brother’s back, getting him to remove his clothes for the camera, as they’ve been deemed unsuitable. The way the two interact with each other is strange, Sherlock can’t help but watch the video over and over.
Sherlock doesn’t last long, John’s knot grinding against his prostate and the added hand on his cock have him shooting cum across the floor, his orgasm so hard some of it lands on the tabletop. The velvet walls crash down to ring the Alpha dry, spilling his third load of seed once again into Sherlock’s womb, swelling his belly further and making the Alpha howl in pleasure.
“It’s okay pup. John’s here to help, he’s okay.” Sherlock says rubbing his nose as Iris uses the little strength he has to look back at the Alpha. John gives him a smile. The young Omega gives a small smile back, then looks down John’s body realizing that the Alpha is naked behind him. When he spots the Alpha’s cock laying thick and long against the sheets, glistening with fluids, he flings his whole body back forward, burying his head into his father’s chest, a blush covering his entire face. He groans in embarrassment upon realizing that they’re all naked and the bedding smells amazingly like the older Alpha he and his father have been both crushing on. The musk of his pine scent is almost too much to bear and he buries his nose into his dad’s scent gland for a bit of a reprieve.
Sometime in the night Iris rolls to the side and John waking up briefly puts his arm around the teen. He notices that the pup’s scent has changed and he’s no longer putting off the scent of heat. John tries not to panic as he realizes that the end of the scent means that the teen is likely pregnant.
“J-o-o-ohn-n!” The detective whines when the Alpha does it again, this time swirling his tongue around the head, capturing a new burst of precum.
“Is there anything you can do so that the knotting doesn’t hurt as much? I can’t imagine it being more painful than what just happened to me.” Sherlock clenches his own hole reflectively and can feel the residual burn from their mating.
How do Sherlock and Iris not get pregnant if they are having sex all the time?
“No, give us a chance! He was an amateur astronomer.”
John barely registers Lestrade asking why anyone would do this, when a message alert of the pink phone goes off. The two Alphas look over as Sherlock pulls the phone from his pocket.
As always, please let me know what you think by adding a comment and I will do my best to get back to everyone.
“Carl Powers, killed twenty years ago. The bomber
John’s fingers are now well coated in clear slick and he uses it to push two into Iris’s warm tight hole. He feels the teen’s whole body tense up, his muscles unsure about the intrusion, but then he pushes those same fingers against his inner walls and the little Omega cries out in delight.
“You should get yourself a hobby – stamps, maybe. Model trains. Safer.” She says nodding as she keeps walking toward the car. John stays back, watching from the rear of the car, standing at parade rest. He watches as Sherlock tells them they need to get a sample of blood to the lab and he grins internally when he sees Lestrade make Donovan do it with just a bit of Alpha intimidation in his eyes.
“Baby, can you lay on your stomach? It’s going to be easier to take the knot that way. I’ll roll you over right after.” John gets up and starts to roll the teen but he fights back a bit.
“We should stop meeting like this.” John says flirtatiously, his voice deep and throaty, sending shivers down the Omega’s spine.
“Must be possible. Must be staring me in the face.” Sherlock tries to encourage himself.
“Gonna make you
“Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. What painting? What are you…what are you on about?” John for once is happy that someone else is asking the question he so often wants to ask.
“What ... like the Connie Prince murder…he-he arranged that? So people come to him wanting their crimes fixed up, like booking a holiday?” John can’t help but find the notion to be absolutely ridiculous, but does his best to keep a straight face.
Birth control pills. Works in real life too. I would know, 11 years and still child free and stuffed with hubby's... cream... (Probably TMI, sorry not sorry.)
“That’s what I thought too. You had already proven yourself multiple times and I just wanted to let you know because it seemed suspicious. The way the teen came in in such a terrible heat and to not get pregnant after that, it’s practically impossible.” Dr. Evans clears his throat.
.” Sherlock moves his hands to wrap around John’s head, scratching at his scalp in a calming way. He pulls back to look directly into the Alpha’s eyes.
“I’m what?”
-----
Sherlock purrs into the kiss, wiggling around happily causing John to groan as his swollen knot is stimulated, causing it to throb in pleasure. He grabs the Omega’s hips stilling them, holding him locked in place. “Hmmm…seems as if you’re ready for a second round.” He growls, Alpha instinct telling him to keep taking, fill the Omega even more while he’s still plugged up.
The detective is looking down thinking when he suddenly whips his head up and shouts. “Oh!”
Sherlock wants in on the fun if John is going to be talking like that. The desperation of their mating had been too much for words, but now it’s almost like they get another shot, just with Iris here to liven the party.
“I don’t believe I asked for your opinion, nor do I believe I
John hisses, over sensitive from their mating. He grabs the Omega’s head and gently pulls those luscious lips off his cock. He guides the teen up to sit in his lap, the heat sated for the moment. He wants to just admire his new mate, so happy to finally have what he’s wanted for so long. The Alpha runs his hands over the Prince’s stomach, knowing soon it will begin to grow and he feels his chest swell with pride, the thought of having his own pups making him emotional. He lightly grips Sherlock’s face, staring at the beautiful Prince that is now his. He runs each thumb over a delicate cheekbone and leans in for a gentle kiss. It’s slow and perfect.
When the Beta comes home, John grabs his pistol, glad he continued to carry it after last night. He has to pull it on the man when he makes a move to throw his bike at John, but immediately submits at the smell of heavy scent and a weapon he knows he can’t escape.
“Yeah, someone might get the wrong idea about us.” Sherlock giggles and John laughs along with him before pulling back to look at the Omega’s face.
It's wet and hot, Sherlock’s body perfectly prepared. The sensation of it, the pure rush of finally getting to be inside of this man he’s been chasing, is so much that John’s whole body shakes as he controls and tames his needs. His Alpha wants to take and take, but he wants to give and give, the war of his two brains putting him on edge.
(See the end of the chapter for
“That’s not possible.” He finally says when he realizes that the doctor has been silent, waiting for him.
John laughs humorlessly, getting up suddenly in frustration. “You’ll be very happy together.” He says before heading off toward the kitchen, taking his half empty cup with him.
is Iris? Is he okay?” John looks up toward his bedroom and Sherlock slumps into his arms, sobbing.
“Is there?” Sherlock says casually, barely slowing his pace.
?” John can hear the desperation starting to set in.
Sherlock whines at the loss, but surprises John when he uses his legs to pull himself up and impale himself back onto the Alpha’s cock. John is the one to moan this time, the unexpected move turning him on as his Alpha revels in the desperation of the Omega to be stuffed full of
Sherlock smiles. “Iris never learned to hate Alpha’s like I did. I tried to teach him with Lestrade that not all Alpha’s were bad. I didn’t want him influenced by my experience and so he’s willing to be open and spend time with you. I however kept to myself and hid my feelings from you because I thought you would just hurt me. I was honestly persuaded to share a flat with you because of how much your scent affected me the moment you walk into the lab. I thought I would study it, but I didn’t know Iris was an Omega and that almost made me change my mind.” John looks up concerned. “It was only after you proved yourself, shooting the cabbie for me, that I knew something else was there, but I still hid from you. Iris was open to you and because of that you turned toward him even as you wanted to pursue me. I don’t blame you for that.”
?” John puts his hands on the top of his chair, gripping the fabric hard. He doesn’t try to hide his anger in this moment, his face trying to turn into a snarl, which he forces into a grimace.
Please enjoy the latest chapter of Double Down and as always my work is completely based on fiction and I do not condone the behavior in it in real life, this is all just fantasy.
“Connection, connection, connection. There
be enjoying it to make our bond.” He snakes his hand down Sherlock’s chest to the Omega’s cock. He finds that the discomfort had made him soft, so he gathers the precum he finds and rubs it over the head like before, beginning to coax him back to full hardness.
John takes some time to himself in the bathroom and the Omegas have some time with each other.
They both let a moment pass waiting for something to go south, but then Sherlock is dropping the weapon and rushing to John tugging at the zipper to the vest he is wearing. “Are you all right?” Sherlock yells.
Mrs. Hudson eventually has to leave after she runs out of excuses to continue talking to Lestrade. The Alpha’s scent has started to get worse as the minutes pass by. Iris observes him from the other side of the room, wondering why he had never done this before. Lestrade has been in his life since he can remember, yet the interactions between them were sparse. His dad tried to keep him out of the whole ‘detective’ business and that often meant that when Lestrade was in the house, Iris was banished to his room. He agrees that it wasn’t appropriate for him as a child to see murder scenes hanging up on the walls as they solved a puzzle, but he called Lestrade his uncle and yet he barely knew anything about the man. Over the years he had come to use the silly nickname and several times over the years, Sherlock had left him alone to chase a criminal, forcing Lestrade to take Iris home in his police cruiser. So, that was really all he knew, that Uncle Lestrade worked with dad and bought him ice cream when the idiot ran off forgetting that Iris couldn’t pay for the cab home. It makes his dad sound like a bad parent, but he was never left alone. Ever. He was only left when Lestrade was there, no other officers, so Iris knew it was only slightly purposeful. He wonders if dad left him alone to get him used to an Alpha, or if he was supposed to be something for Lestrade. Maybe his dad thought it would be good for both of them. He was right if it was. Eating ice cream in the police cruiser and hearing about chasing bad guys around was some of his favorite times when he was little. Maybe it was his dad’s way of showing him his world but from a different ‘better’ perspective.
“Fuck yes.” John growls out, his knot swelling. He doesn’t let up for a moment, instead shifting his hips to find the right angle to make Iris cry in pleasure.
“Hmmm. So I’ve been told.” He leans down and kisses John, using the hands he has on the Alpha’s head to tilt his face up. John eagerly returns the kiss, sealing his lips against the Omega’s, never wanting to be separated from them again. Tongues meet for the first time, twisting together as they taste each other, nails scrape across John’s neck but he barely notices as his own hands move down to grab at the detective’s ass. He can feel his control slipping as he unconsciously ruts himself against Sherlock who grinds back enthusiastically, the two becoming fully aroused in their trousers. They can feel the hardness of the others cock even through their clothes, John’s large and thick against Sherlock’s smaller one. It makes them both moan when the Alpha thrusts just right to slide them both together, the delicious friction furthering their desire.
“Surprised you haven’t had enough, I thought filling two Omega’s this full would put you out of commission. Guess I was wrong.” Sherlock giggles as John keeps slipping in and out, the wet squish and pop of his knot sounding hilarious right now.
“Tisk, tisk. My baby boy is so messy, look at how much you leaked all over me.” John’s cock throbs, bouncing ever so slightly.
(See the end of the chapter for
perfect.” John draws back a bit, taking his weight off the teen and letting the cool air get between their bodies. They’re both drenched in sweat and still panting heavily, John still has his shoes and pants wrapped around his ankles, his shirt half undone. Sherlock tries to move his arms and head, his body not really listening to him as he tries to remember how anything works. The Alpha watching him takes pity on the teen, knowing the table isn’t exactly the most comfortable thing to lay on, he takes his new mate into his arms, being careful not to jostle them and tug on the knot. He shuffles them back a few feet and together seats them in the King’s chair, Sherlock once again leaning his head back to lay on John’s shoulder, using him as his own personal chair.
Smoothing his hands up the back of Sherlock’s thighs he lifts them up, giving him better access to see his goal, a pretty pink and slick soaked hole. John licks his lips when he sees the rim clench in anticipation, the Omega’s body knowing what’s going to happen. He pulls one hand down and runs his thumb over a cheek, gathering the clear liquid before sucking it from his finger. The flavor fills his senses and with a low groan he feels himself leak a spurt of precum down onto the floor as his cock pulses in arousal. He continues to ignore his own needs, not even putting a hand on himself, he instead swipes his thumb over Sherlock’s hole, watching it flutter and leak more slick as the false heat intensifies, bringing more scent with it.
Lestrade looks between them. “Seven?! Wait and three more?!” He looks a little concerned as he side eyes John, who just shrugs.
As always, please let me know what you think by adding a comment and I will do my best to get back to everyone. We are coming down to the last one maybe two chapters if I go to far and that slow burn tag is about to be fulfilled next chapter, along with all those other naughty tags that I haven't used yet.
” He pauses. “Hello?”
“Very popular. She was going places.” Lestrade says.
“How long have you been following me?”
They continue down the path until they hit the darkness of the arches, a rough part of town if the graffiti on the walls is anything to go by.
“Do you want to talk about it?” The teen questions. John takes another sip of his beer and puts it on the little side table.
“You both know that Alpha and Omega genes run in families, yeah?” John moves the chair, getting up for a stretch.
“John. Iris explained the false heat and everything that happened. I
“Ten a penny.” Sherlock shoots back.
any good, did it?” Sherlock shoots back.
“Well, that’s the thing. He was fine and got better but when he was tested, — well he wasn’t — wasn’t pregnant.” The doctor says it and John’s ears start ringing, all his medical knowledge swirling in his head, his brain coming up empty with a possible explanation.
Sherlock laughs. “We are never letting you go. Iris and I want us to be a pack, all of us together. You are somehow exactly what I never knew I needed. You are protective, dangerous, caring, and
“All right, all right, girls, calm down.” Iris snickers next to him amused by his way of breaking up the situation. John bumps his elbow into the teen’s side playfully and Iris has to cover his mouth not to laugh more. “Sherlock? D’you wanna take us through it?” He asks as the two grown men in front of him both blink a few times as they realize they were acting like pups.
John doesn’t remember falling asleep, but waking up warm and surrounded by Omega scent is the best. The only thing better would be to have the Omegas here as well.
“Clostridium botulinum!” Sherlock yells. Clearly it’s important but John just stares at him blankly before looking toward Iris, who is completely still with the finger sandwich halfway to his open mouth. He clearly understood what his dad just yelled and is thinking it over in his own head.
“Love. Ah. Love please.” John pleads a bit, not worried that Sherlock will see him as less Alpha if he does so.
John stares at Sherlock, really tries to see him in this moment as his thoughts that the detective was actually trying to subtly help people in his own way, that he cared for them in some capacity are shattered. He sniffs, and looks over to Iris, who has come out of his blanket hiding spot and is looking down at his hands. He walks over to the couch as Sherlock continues to type on his phone, clearly not finding what he’s looking for quickly. John puts his hand lightly on the side of Iris’s head and bends down, giving him a small peck on the top of his head. “I’m sorry.” He says lightly before passing the teen by and sitting in front of the newspapers on the coffee table, opening one up before turning a few pages, letting out a sigh as he does.
“You need to relax Love, no need to be tense.” John says, continuing to lightly kiss and nuzzle into the Omega’s neck. He doesn’t move his hips, doesn’t dare to push further into the heat he’s craving. Just stays as still as possible, feeling Sherlock’s heart beat through their chests pressed together tight, his own heart beat echoing back. John can feel when Sherlock makes the conscious decision to breathe out a long sigh, relaxing his muscles and causing the Alpha to accidentally slide in further with a low groan.
.” John’s scent has wafted on the breeze and he can see in his peripheral vision that others are bowing their heads in response. Except for one whom he assumes is Lestrade, which starts walking over toward him quickly. “We’re all here to do a job, to help people. Not to have a pissing contest about who solves the crimes or how. Got it?” He asks.
With shoes finally kicked off somewhere, John lets out a deep growl and lifts up Sherlock by his tiny hips, hauling him up easily making the Omega wrap his legs around John’s sturdy hips. The smell of arousal in the air drives them both wild as John walks them to the detective’s room, Sherlock kissing his jawline and panting out little puffs of air in his ear as he’s carried. It makes the detective a tad embarrassed to be carried like this but he secretly loves it, being completely at the Alpha’s mercy. He would have never allowed someone to do this to him before but with John it just feels right.
Sherlock sits the whole time with his hands steepled, never moving as he presumably roams around in his mind palace.
John takes another nap and is back up again when he hears Sherlock shouting at the television. He begins typing up the Chinese acrobat case on his laptop while the detective watches some crap reality show. The sitting room is cold tonight, so they’re in their jackets. Iris curled up in John’s usual chair, watching along with a cup of steaming tea.
“What?”
“I —” John fumbles for the words, not wanting to upset the detective. “I don’t want to sound like
“No, no, no, no. Tell me nothing about him.
His shallower thrusts are met with enthusiasm as Sherlock can feel the growing knot stretching him wider, his body naturally pulling John in. His body wants everything from the Alpha, he wants to be filled with John’s seed, his Omega reminding him how amazing he had felt to be full with a child once. It whispers to him that this time would be even better, because it would be with
“I’m sorry Iris. It’s not over yet. You’re only going to have a few minutes before your Omega takes over again. But I want you to know that John and I are going to take really good care of you, okay?” He takes Iris’s face into his hands and makes sure to look him right in the eyes, ones that look exactly like his own.
John watches from the corner of his eye, trying not to alert the Alphas and at the same time wondering what had gotten into the young Prince. Then he smells it, ever so faintly the Omega’s fresh meadow grass scent and it’s just barely tinged with the alluring fragrance of preheat. It’s too soon for Sherlock to be in a full-blown heat, the smell is just barely there so John figures he still has time to finish the meeting and haul the Prince back to his chambers and lock him up there for the duration. He’s been tasked before with guarding the young Omega in this very situation when the unfortunate timing had happened in a much more dangerous situation, outside of the castle. John had good control that day, even as the teen he carried in his arms begged him and dripped slick down on his armor he stayed true to his King and returned the Prince to his chambers. Sometimes he wished he had lost control that day, laid the Omega upon his bed and claimed him for himself.
The audio plays loudly again then cuts as the Golem hauls Sherlock to the side, throwing him down to the ground, while his leg kicks out at John’s weapon, forcing it from his hand. Before he attempts to retrieve it the assassin is on John instead, wrestling with him for control, giving him a kick to the stomach then pulling him with great strength to crash into what can only be Sherlock, who must have gotten up to rejoin the fight. They both go crashing to the floor, the detective bouncing back faster gets up, standing to his tallest but the Golem stands taller, towering over him.
“Yeah. Sure.” John says staring blankly ahead, still contemplating life and all its meaning. The Alpha starts to get up as Sherlock continues the pacing back and forth he had started earlier, but stops when he sees a sniper's red dot on his chest once again. “Oh.”
“So what? You fake them giving birth, buy babies from out of the country and put them into the hands of Omegas who turn them over to be adopted?” It’s the most logical thing Sherlock can think of. Starving people in poor countries are willing to sell anything sometimes for money, that or drug addicted parents who need their next hit. The human trafficking trade is huge and Moriarty would likely have no problem contributing.
Back at home, Iris and Sherlock go about putting all the information they know onto the wall behind the couch, reviewing it as they go along. A large map first, followed by pictures of the dead women, pieces of evidence from the other puzzles, anything they think might be relevant.
“I thought of it the minute I saw the scratches on her arm, but it’s too random and too clever for the brother.”
The Omegas look at each other and then John with confusion on their faces. Sherlock mutes the telly, clearly intrigued by what John is thinking. “Yes. Omegas are likely to give birth to only one type of offspring, predominantly. It’s likely if I were to have another child, if female she would be an Omega like Iris, though if they were male it would be more typical for them to be a Beta, since Omega males are rare. Though I think the rate of a male being an Omega would be — a 34 percent higher chance overall.”
John picks up his pace, shallowing out as he pounds his knot right into Sherlock’s rim, allowing the slick there to coat him and coaxing more of it out of that tiny body. Making the teen gush his sweet fragrance making John moan low in his throat.
rather the point.” He smiles as he reaches the other side of the deep end, water no longer between them. Sherlock looks over to John as the red dot quivers.
Heyo! I hope everyone is staying safe in light of the COVID-19 outbreak. To entertain you if only for a little while, please enjoy the next chapter as we continue on with The Great Game.
John eventually pulls back with reluctance, ghosting his lips across Sherlock’s now reddened ones, the Omega panting heavily with arousal. “Your wish is my sworn duty, your grace.” And with that John gives in, he doesn’t have real permission to mate the teen, but he doesn’t care anymore, slipping his hands to the boy’s chest, he begins undoing the small leather laces and clasps that make up the Omega’s royal attire, stripping him of his shirt before running his large war calloused hands down over the smooth unmarred youthful skin. He can feel the goosebumps rise across the flesh as he lightly runs fingers over collar bones and back down again to feel the flat but soft skin of the teenager’s stomach. He can’t help a possessive rumble from rolling out of his throat as he imagines that same belly swollen with his child, proof of their coupling and John’s virility.
“Fill him up Alpha.” Sherlock says and it’s the most sinful thing John thinks he will ever hear come out of those lips.
mating me first.” John smiles and it’s dazzling. “He thought he knew what was going to happen, we we’re going to return home as friends. But you surprised him. Hell you surprised me.” His smile goes wider turning into a grin.
“He killed the old lady because she started to describe him.” He holds up his hand, his index finger extended. “Just once, he put himself in the firing line.” His hand stays hovering above the pink phone.
The pink phone rings and Sherlock, ever drawn to its siren call, answers immediately, putting it on speaker phone.
“Sure pup. Come on.” Sherlock says as he lays on his back, scooching over to the middle of the bed as Iris climbs on top, letting them be chest to chest. Sherlock takes both their cocks, positioning them so that the teen’s weight presses them together. They both sigh when their leaking tips slide against each other and Sherlock feels them throb in unison.
John strides across the room, taking the comforter in his arms. He can smell instantly that it hasn’t been washed, still saturated in Iris’s scent from when he slept in it. The Alpha is a little surprised by that.
“You think it was the cat. It wasn’t the cat.” Sherlock can’t help but smile. He knows John’s wrong but many people wouldn’t have had a theory like that, so the Alpha is clearly learning. Thinking outside the box, slowly becoming more than just an average mindless drone.
“That’s it, Love. Being
“Love, Love, relax. What’s going on?” He questions, the need to calm his mate taking priority. He reaches out and pulls Sherlock in to scent him, but the Omega is squirming around and still trying to push against him. John just nuzzles his face into Sherlock’s neck, and that’s when he smells it. Flowers? Virgin? He pulls back for a moment and looks at the terror on his mate’s face.
After listening to the short message and not being able to call back, they bid the Beta farewell. As they get outside John’s phone rings with a text from Mycroft, asking if he’s interviewed West’s fiancée for the other case yet. He sighs. “Iris, your Uncle Mycroft wants me to go talk to West’s fiancée. Do you want to head back to the flat?”
The cab ride home is silent.
!” His Alpha is awake and out now, howling as his knot dips further and further into Sherlock’s wet heat with each forceful thrust. When he finally slips the largest part of his knot past that tight rim he snarls out in triumph as he sinks in and they lock together. Sherlock’s insides molding around him, baring down even as his knot begins fully inflating sealing them together in their sensual embrace.
“Are you okay, John?” Iris asks, concerned. He can see that Iris is lightly sniffing the room, trying not to be obvious about it, and the Alpha has to admit that even he can smell his own anxious scent in the air. It’s likely making Iris anxious as well, a heavy reminder that his scent affects them just as much as they affect him.
“Jim Moriarty.” He says in a silky voice. “HI!” Moriarty then says in a strange high pitched voice, one might use when excited, but it feels too flat. It sends a chill through Sherlock’s spine. “
John wordlessly agrees, smoothing his fingers along Sherlock’s shaft and applying pressure at just the right time near the base to make the Omega’s hips push up into his hand. He gathers the little spurts of precum as the Sherlock starts leaking again, his insides quivering around the Alpha’s hard cock which plugs him full. John fingers work over his sensitive length, bringing him closer to the edge with each stroke.
“Four.”
stop you.” Sherlock says, voice steady.
Luckily for them all, biology likes to surpass his emotions meaning John’s already grown hard as he laid here talking, drinking in sweet virgin scent with each breath. He ignores his own body and instead snakes the hand that he had been rubbing along Iris’s back down over his pert butt and along his smooth thigh. He grips the flesh, giving it a good massage as he nuzzles into Iris’s neck, rubbing his cheek into the teen’s scent gland. Iris moans and it’s so incredibly sinful that John pauses and looks at Sherlock.
The Omega licks his lips, staring at his mate’s cock, still unbelieving that the whole thing had just been deep inside him. He puts his hands onto John’s knees and gets closer, sniffing along the way, smelling cum and slick, combined into a heady scent that has him licking the Alpha’s balls, rubbing his tongue over hot skin, gathering their fluids onto his pallet. He lets the liquid stay there, his tongue tasting for the first time the bitter release of his mate. He dives in hungry, licking and sucking his way up the shaft. He’s inexperienced, but he’s starving for more, basking in the scent of his bond mate. In the back of his mind, he wonders what that smell will be like when John goes into rut, it makes his insides clench and he feels more of the Alpha’s cum drip from his hole and down his thighs. He licks to the top circling the head, before taking the tip of the Alpha’s cock in his mouth then slowly slipping down to engulf what he can of the thick length.
“Well, John’s scent
“Seven.” Sherlock says.
“It’s a very
“Oh, you like that do you.” He says, taking in a few fresh lungfuls of Sherlock’s scent, his arousal evident even without his pheromones floating in the air. John keeps calm as he can, forcing himself to go slow as he brings his hands down along the Prince’s body, skimming over sensitive skin. Rib bones he can felt through flesh, hips that go down until he’s touching the warm soft flesh of the Omega’s inner thighs. He uses one hand on each to part the boy’s legs, drawing them further and further apart, exposing them where they’re locked together to the room. The teen shivers in his hands, whining softly as he’s opened, John dipping one hand down to feel where they are sealed together, tracing the Prince’s rim with his finger, gathering some of the slick that’s still clung there.
Seated at breakfast, he and Iris order food while Sherlock doesn’t even pay attention to the nice Beta girl who takes their order. John orders him tea, hoping he’ll at least drink it with some cream. They had all been silent up until now, but Iris decides it’s been enough and announces that he’s going to change his major at University. He wants to major now in Forensic science and pursue a similar detective path of his father, though he feels the formal education could allow him more wiggle room than Sherlock usually gets with the police. His statements are met with enthusiasm from both his father and John, causing the younger Omega to stare at his lap shyly.
“You have one new message.” The automatic voice says before a series of Greenwich pips, almost identical to the first message, except…
“Don’t get me wrong, Iris’s scent still smells amazing, and I can feel a tug on my sanity from it, we’re are still newly mated but we shouldn’t have to worry about my instincts any longer.” John pulls back and stares at his mate’s face. Sherlock’s cheeks are red and his hair is still wild from their mating, he’s the most gorgeous he’s ever been.
John takes it easier, putting his gun away. “Or not. I have an idea where he might be going.” He licks his lips, not sure if his idea will play out but it’s worth a shot.
Morning crept up, just like it always does on Sherlock, the soft yellow light indicating that John would be coming down any moment now, fresh from another battle with his demons.
“So I’m just heading over to the clinic, I’ve got to work today. After that, I’ll be staying at Mary’s so try to remember to feed yourself. Get some sleep too, I know you haven’t been…”
It really didn't bother him before, and it shouldn't be bothering him now - but it is. His hands sometimes grew wearing of his bow against four steel strings, which frankly surprised him, and they ached for the smooth ivory keys he grew up with. There could only be one reason for this.
Time stopped as John searched Sherlock’s eyes for a bare hint of a lie, because the eyes, as they say, are the windows to the soul. The moment dissipated like steam, and just as John turned around to leave, Mycroft enters the room unannounced and not at all apologetic.
John’s piece. Unfinished and shoved away, like a spoiled memory.
After he got off university and lived off his own, he had no access to a piano. Their grand piano at the mansion was his source of joy in the times of silence at home, for he would play with his violin in his room or in the garden, much to the amusement of the gardener and the birds resting in the trees.
Suddenly, he was aware of weary footsteps on the floor above him, and the door of the second floor opening. Finally, John was awake. Sherlock waited until John came in, deciding on the usual silent routine.
(I'm sorry this is really short, but I wanted to update before the new year. Happy New Year everyone! May 2017 be a really great and inspiring year for us all.)
His nightmares were getting worse as of late, and the melodic tones of a piano would be perfect. Sherlock imagined playing Liebestraum on it for John, but his violin would have to do for now.
Why Sherlock seems to care, he tries desperately not to think about it. John was in a sour mood, and it might have to do with the fact that he tried to make tea and there was no milk (which is a regular occurrence that no one should be surprised at anymore), so he went up to his room with a shake of his head and a scowl on his face.
He got his empty music sheets and sat down, the pencil in his hand full of promises. How can he convey what he is feeling for this extraordinarily normal man? Composing music usually came easy to him, but that was when he was bored or experiencing something that was not love. This is John, the man who thinks he is brilliant, who gets pissed off at the disorganized body parts in the fridge but smiles fondly at Sherlock when he thinks Sherlock doesn't notice.
Something is curdling in my core. Rotten, foul.
Well, no.
''Still feeling like you might be ill? Do you want to head home?''
Pale hands race to his hair, tug at his strands. His flesh blanches around the area of impact, and I resist an impulse to hold him down.
Perhaps it is because while he is haunted by what happened to him, I was haunted by connection. By my seeming role as spared one, loved one, protected one.
oh shit.
I wait, feeling the sense of 'wrongness' increase.
''Forget it,'' I say, rising awkwardly. ''I want to go back to bed.''
Thin arms now wrap completely around a thin torso.
Now John's voice is fearful.
Toby nods, and I get up sorely, my knee popping, then flip the switch.
''Hop on then,'' I say lightly; a test. A challenge.
"You typically are able to better reign in your anger. Especially if it is likely to get you booted from a case. But you didn't - or couldn't - on this case, and that leads me to think that there is something very specific about this case that is making it hard for you to emotionally deal with whatever you are dealing with right now."
''What things?,'' he demands, his voice faint. Exhausted.
''Yes?,'' I huff into the phone, once it is in my possession.
I hold a package of Hobnobs and Digestives in a brown paper bag flush against my body.
''I think I am aware of the changes I underwent. And I think - after more than two decades - I have learned to accept them. I am taller, my voice is deeper. I can live with that,'' he says dryly, with a fake ease.
''So that's a yes, then?''
It's Christmas, and I'm still seven. And Mycroft has to go back to school tomorrow, so I'm trying not to cry.
------------------------------------
Yet the scarring had been old. Too old to have been caused by the abductor.
He's now twisting his hands together, so eager to fidget with something.
John is staring at me in sick realization.
To my left, a bay window cut out against the night and I could see the Japanese Maples in their reddish-purple intensity below.
"You wanted to know! Last night and this morning! Think talking makes things all better don't you? But you really have no idea!"
-sherlock, please stop it.-
----------
When I get to the door, I stare at the metal numbers with a type of dread - wondering if the flat will still smell faintly of honey and barley and cocoa, or if the scent of old memories and old pain has begun to dissipate with the day.
It comforts me, though. It's warm, and dark, and smells like chips, malt vinegar, sarsaparilla, and barbecue sauce.
I truly don't want to get up, but I start to rise when I hear John trot back down the hallway.
Even so, I am less of a homebody than Patrick is - who outside of his running schedule in the early mornings prefers a world of film consumption and board game playing with heavy candy supplementation. Case in point: Settlers of Catan – Star Trek edition is still lying out on the table, small pieces and cards littered about.
******************
I take a few more sips, increase the sit ups. Turn the shower to ice cold, even though I won't be showering until I am done with this next step.
------------------------------------------
''Sherlock...when I date, I don't always love the person I date. I mean it's attraction, and it may start as a physical attraction, but-''
He's lost weight.
And there he is:
''Sherlock. Get up. Get ready,'' I stress, using my firmest 'Captain John Watson' voice. ''Move it!''
''I know. I want us to go home, too. So we have to be strong for a bit, and then they will let us leave. You just need to calm down a little bit more, okay? I didn't mean to get you so upset. I should have realized that I-,'' but I let my words die out.
I shave twice tonight to ensure that I have gotten all slight protrusions - before restarting the shower jet and rinsing the shampoo and shaving foam off and away from my body.
Sherlock's fists thump against his sides in frustration.
All my fault.
Sherlock takes a step closer to me. I hear, rather than see, him lick his lips. I think I can hear the fluttering of spidery, long eyelashes blink shut against his cheek. The whir and flutter of the pull back. I force myself to look at his eyes. The pupils are dark and demanding and real and his eyes are full and open.
----------------------------------------------
John slowly exits his bedroom and has come back down the stairs. He must sense that I am angry because he gives me a wide berth.
And that tells me quite a bit about him, actually.
Swallowing down a painful lump, I respond.
Mrs. Hudson indicates to a doctor waiting off to the side, apparently waiting to speak to me.
How to bring forth the words that will articulate, sanely, what this feels like.
My mouth dries out.
''You feel a little hot, and you didn't feel this warm earlier. I noticed you seemed a bit congested as you were falling asleep. Does your throat hurt as it would if you were getting a cold or a flu?,'' I inquire gently, to which he nods.
About reactive attachment disorder. How those who entered adulthood with the disorder often could experience anxiety with even simple touches.
''I think so,'' and I lick my lips, nervously.
''You sure you don't feel nauseated?,'' I clarify again. Because he's sweaty, but he's certainly not running a fever. If anything he feels too cold, and-
''Just ask me,'' I say calmly. As calmly as is possible. ''It's fine. It's all fine.''
''Okay. Well, I will get around to talking to John. But I want to thank you for calling me.''
I don't disconnect our hands. Just trail their combined form up to our bookshelves. Point at the bookshelves, his fingers still entwined with my own.
''No,'' he barks out, cheeks fuchsia and his voice conveying frustration and shame.
I pack a lunch of grapes, crisps, a cheese stick in colourful packaging intended for kids (and which I thought Sherlock may nibble on. No luck), and a thermos of black coffee. With sugar. For energy.
''My throat is hurting,'' I start, frowning at myself, my words. ''I'm feeling cold.''
I feel my teeth bite into my lip. Tense.
''Anorexia nervosa, I think. I think maybe I have that. I think maybe I am anorexic.''
My hands dwarf the smaller fossilized markings of a tiny, tiny human and I stare at the record in mixed emotionality.
I stand up suddenly, furious.
If I fully connected to the weight of the betrayal, it would lash out in my guts just as a physical wound. And I was never the recipient of abuse of such a heinous nature.
It only felt appropriate to be with him in my mind. To consider his final moments in my own way.
Distantly, I can recall how his form shuffled back to the table as I stood outside in the hallway, pacing, waiting for him to do the right thing. I can recall the dark outline of his silhouette through the glass as he sat back down in his chair. The flapping sounds of paper as he picked up what could have only been the case notes.
''Hi there, Mr. Holmes. Doctor Watson,'' and she gives us both a tentative smile, ''I'm going to inform your doctors that you're awake, Mr. Holmes. How are you feeling?''
molly.
Sherlock seems to be processing my words hesitantly. As if he is debating their truth.
I did not push him for another interaction, another meeting.
Just as I am about to call Mycroft back, a text comes in.
'You're not little,' the Martian replies firmly, and his voice is like ice. 'How old did you turn today, my love?'
He's...ashamed.
I dabbed at the gash with the peroxide, and he flinched, but gave no outwards cry of pain, and the wound fizzed white and the skin suddenly looked hot and pink when I removed the pad from his hand. Fresh curdling of blood welled up to the surface, and my stomach writhed in empathy.
The process must be incredibly exhausting.
''If you take this as something you are doing, to yourself, to hurt yourself - you're not seeing what I'm seeing. Not entirely. What I'm seeing in you.''
By promises of house work, no less.
Sherlock stopped moving, and his body shuddered with pent up need.
Yuri gives me an encouraging nod and jots down something on the form.
''What was the 'point', again?'' I ask tersely.
My child self whispers to me, 'there's always that. There's always that if you need it.'
“Reading a passage isn’t going to change this! It can’t.”
By the time he started sipping at his fourth drink, his motions became a little uncoordinated.
I do my arms next, and then my face. Finally I grab the bottle once more to get slightly more gel, and apply the cleanser to my thighs, and between my legs - looking at the shower curtain as I do so. I feel around until my fingertips connect with the slightly raised ridge of keloid scars and then I move lower to complete the routine on my calves and feet.
Then I turn on the Ott lamp and disrobe. Let myself look down at my lower extremities for the first time in over a week.
"Is there a reason - beyond impulsivity - for why you hit Mr. Thiesen this afternoon?"
I might have even considered it a call from a well balanced but concerned friend.
I recognize the number and head to my office, wanting to minimize noise and any subsequent discomfort for John.
''Nothing I say is going to make it easier for you to want to do this. There is no wanting to do this. There is just needing to do this. Do you see? If he's internally bleeding, or even if he's dealing with injuries that haven't been treated properly - he could get an infection or he could get a fever. He could get sepsis. We don't even know how badly he's hurt yet. To ignore his injuries would be irresponsible at best.''
"I never wanted it in my body," I breathe out again, forcing myself to calm down. Forcing the images out. Not wanting to mix John up with these feelings. These feelings of it all being wrong. All of it being so wrong.
Sherlock shuffles about on the bench, as if uncomfortable.
''What have I ever done or said that gives you an impression that I don't think you're trying?,'' Yuri asks me reasonably, taking a sip of his cola a second later.
Probably because he is excessively concerned about me. Of course, he'd drop the ''excessive'' and argue that it's a completely understandable level concern. He'd probably say something like, ''nothing excessive about it!''
''You can talk, but I'm going to read. Or does that not meet your approval? Going to take that away from me too?''
I nod despite myself.
''I can imagine that it would be an awful thing to witness. John?,'' I ask carefully, ''I want you to write down three things you'd like to see improve. In terms of how Sherlock cares for himself. And then I want you to read them out.''
''That's correct,'' he states more assuredly now.
I poured him some more, and sipped at my own with far less nervousness or speed.
But they go anyway. Because they don't want to see, either. Nobody 'cept the Martian wants to see this part.
Perhaps because I have issues with being perceived as weak. Or needing pity.
My mind quickly presents about fifteen scenarios of the last week where Sherlock has shown intense emotionality. Passion for music. Irritation regarding a stupid comment from Anderson. Compassion for an inquired squirrel that lay bleeding in the frost. He actually picked the animal up, and wrapped its little body in his jacket, returning to Baker Street so he could try to save it. Horror over what was done to Toby.
I have a love-loathe relationship with cheese at the best of times.
He had just lost a tooth, too.
A short moment later, a cool and petite hand is against my own.
Yet, this hurts more than just about anything else I have ever experienced.
''A gastroenterologist to monitor the stomach problems, in addition to a nutritionist.''
''He's...he's just had a bad dream. Just spooked himself. We'll just be a bit longer, Hope.''
''Yes, I have,'' he admits.
And I hate that he sounds so scared to speak. I don't want to scare him. All the same, he is used to getting his own way. That has to change. His bullheadedness is what has driven so many away, when he was at his lowest.
The shower gave me time to determine how I'm going to proceed with John.
had come in too close. whomever was niggling me and making me tense and freeze and act like more of a dick
Sherlock nods, slightly. It's barely perceptible.
''It's not you,'' Sherlock pleads, not knowing how to broach the issue. ''I'm not afraid of you.''
And with that realization I suddenly feel off. Strange.
No one should be.
"What happened to them was awful, John," he hisses. "Isn't that enough?"
''Tomorrow, please,'' I beg, feeling swarmed. Even if there is only one other person in the room. ''Just give me tonight.''
''Go on, then. We need this space,'' Yuri says, nudging the animal lightly with his sock, while the cat - Gwennie's - ears lay flat against her head and she cries once more. ''Oh no, don't look at me that way. I didn't name you.''
I still my motions as I make my way inside, and hold my violin tighter across my chest in a type of weird, protective impulse.
A sound breaks from his throat.
I like the fact that I am thinking in numbers; in so doing, I am ignoring that bothersome need to cry.
He gives me an appraising look, his eyes roaming over my frame. I nervously adjust my jacket, before taking it off.
I look down abruptly then, fiercely angry with myself. And there is so much that I could say now. But all of it would look pretty awful. Pretty horrible.
"No. This is Mycroft's doing. Oh, I see it now. He told you...he told you I had been suicidal. I didn't just hurt myself - I tried to kill myself. Is that it? Melodramatic donkey's ass!"
“No thank you,” I reply briskly, my heart thrumming away in my chest. The medication has dulled my anxiety but has evidentially not extinguished it entirely.
And then we are at the partition between kitchen and living room, and the antique mirror of our mother mocks us with it's bronzed splendor. It's decadence. It's richness.
''Sherlock? Sherlock - whatever is happening to you right now, we are going-''
---------------------------------
Sometime later, I say:
When I wander back to the living room, I let my eyes roam over the room. Everything looks - good. Decent.
I frown at the display, not really understanding. 122.4 lbs? That's way too low for a person edging towards 6 ft 1.
I try to blink away my disbelief.
''Yes?,'' I ask softly. More softly than I want to ask, yet stepping close enough to the door that I know he can hear me.
He squeezes my hand so tightly, it begins to tingle.
''That sounds...that sounds advanced.''
He cuts me off, softly, but stridently.
Maybe I need sleep.
''I do,'' I replied with conviction.
I've painted myself as pathetic and weak and ugly and stupid and impulsive and egotistical. Especially as of late.
That he's doing his own sort of 'bone check', which was a term I read about on one of the recovery forums.
Not within his reach, but almost.
The haze of early morning light is filtering in through the shades, which cut lines of black and taupe against Sherlock's face.
It's the most I've ever said in one go to Mycroft Holmes.
His bed was rather messy, with sheets and blankets and pajamas all mucked up, and he indicated that I should take to an Eames chair situated off in the corner of the room (which I did).
''Yes.''
''Toby wouldn't have wanted the exam to have started. That's not good enough, though. Not when you thought he had serious internal injuries.''
When I find the extra magnets, I gloss over the image one more time with my thumb.
I want to ask - and I feel that it is necessary to know - when Sherlock first stopped eating. When he first started skipping snacks, then meals, then the whole of it for favour of hunger and not ''fullness.''
''I just want to be honest with people. And I admit - sometimes I worry that by default I can't connect. Not really with anyone. Sexually, sure. But deeper? No. And then I met Sherlock, and it wasn't - it's not - sexual. And I don't know if I want it to be sexual. I don't think so. But that almost doesn't matter, because with him - it's everything else. All the other emotions, I mean - I feel those for him. And I'm not usually like that with anyone - even people I like a lot, sexually or romantically. But with him those feelings are strong. Just to be with him, to talk to him. To really speak and have him hear. Or maybe it's because he just has to look at someone and he knows basically everything about them - he can see into you, even if you've barely said a word at all, and yet, despite all that...he still wants to be with me, as a friend. As something.''
A long suffering sigh, then. As if I am trying to test his patience, and not save him further aggravation.
Why was I so limited in emotional understanding?
He hasn't played in four days. And we are not on a case.
My fear has to take a backseat to my friendship.
He squeezes my shoulders, his mouth breathing into the top of my torso, his little body compacted. As if he's trying to curl up in on himself.
Get up off the ground.
Usually John and I would pop into these places during cases and it became a sort of ritual for me. I’d generally get the same thing every time: light roast, black, double sugar – but some days the ritual would take on a soothing quality that others might associate with lavender infused baths or Yoga classes.
“Thank you,” I mumble, standing beside John on the platform. “Thank you – for earlier. It was, umm, good.”
===========================
I let my hand trail up to his throat, and I press lightly along the back to where his throat dips around near his ears, and then I move forward until my fingertips are stroking and feeling for swelling around his Adam's apple. I finally reach for his hand and take his pulse before he can stop me.
''You have to promise me you won't...force anything of me-''
He seems to pick up on my emotional state, and I hear a fuzzy voice near my temple say, tentatively:
I deposit the boxes into the cart. Not like John would. Not gently at all. The edge of one box crumples in at the corner.
why did i say that?
I clear my throat.
Which is probably true, of course. But emotionally he was still just a very little child.
the issue is that i don't want to do so.
I ignore the sentence. Try constructing a new one.
I would like to resume writing, but honestly - not having written for so long I was quite anxious knowing people would be disappointed in my lack of activity, and the anxiety made it difficult to even write an update and explain why I had been absent for so long.
Sherlock's lip pinches against his teeth.
Yuri looks over to me, catches my head, shakes his head softly. 'No.'
Could smell the scent of it all over my body.
His face is tight, too tight. Too much strain.
''What are we trying to take away from you, Sherlock? What is it that you think you will lose if you stop doing this to yourself?''
You have to provide that for yourself.
I take his hand gently.
Yet I am terrified of saying the words: 'I am lost.'
"What does that mean? What did 'punishment' mean?"
''Doanleave,'' and his words run together in his anxiety.
'''Someone' is very vague,'' he says in irritation. ''I'm speaking to you right now. Tell me what you mean, or don't talk to me at all. I don't like to have my time wasted.''
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(And it makes no sense! None at all! I never was abused in such a manner. I was never hit!)
Even when I try to cry. Even when I feel I need to do so.
"Okay," I say, and lean over to hand him the other page.
But I can also remember being slightly older, and holding a shaving razor in the palm of my hand, and trying to grasp what the word 'alive' meant.
I asked him to make his life extraordinarily happy.
I tug his over-sized charcoal gloves onto my hands. When I bring my beverage back to my lips, I can smell the scents of cedar and something vaguely like book binding glue.
His face slackens, and his eyes change in quality, turning into something murky, shaded.
The newcomer stares back at me with an equal sense of control.
What are you trying to get out?
''No, I'm not. Obviously I'm failing at everything!''
''You don't have a fever,'' she murmurs, seemingly confused.
I don't say anything at all.
Part of me does want to eat it. A very conflicted part.
And - God - he looks like a wounded animal. He actually looks like I've betrayed him.
On September 11th of 2020, my sister passed away suddenly. She was in her 30s with no health issues that we thought could lead to such a sudden death, although she had dealt with major depression as previously mentioned, as well as the development of bipolar in her teenage years.
''He never liked to kiss you?''
--------------------------------------------------
I rise abruptly, feeling lost, frustrated and beyond all - scared.
probably, anyway.
''What does it feel like to you?,'' he asks, trying to hide his anxiety.
''You say that now,'' Sherlock starts, edgily. ''But you've only been dealing with this for awhile. You cannot promise any-,'' and then he stops talking abruptly and returns to his seat, and picks up his paper and pen, hurriedly scrawling on the sheet of loose-leaf.
I look at the box of the brown, large, free run, organic 12 pack in my hand and suddenly agree with Sherlock.
I close the door to the bathroom, and turn on the light. I turn on the fan. I take two towels, and block the door with the towels, hopefully blocking out both sound and light in the process.
Because he has to be.
Why am I the bad person here?
Only Sherlock will ever have eyes that can see so much - at least, in my opinion.
''John?,'' and Lestrade's voice is suddenly at my back, my neck. A pace away from my ear. Gentle and kind and nothing if not the voice of a friend.
''Sherlock,'' I try again, a little louder this time; I am rewarded by his slight stirring. His mouth works, back and forth, and he opens his eyes in confusion.
He pokes at the blocks now with his foot, and they all fall over in a clump.
He takes a deep breath, and it rattles in his lungs, as if he's getting sick.
I hold back a groan, my heart beating rapidly in my chest. I tell myself he's just being as he's always been.
I'm rambling, but I can't help it.
My mind always focuses on the most inane things when I am nervous.
I bristle. Even John can't be that stupid.
Another nod.
''Ahh,'' I say with a slight grin, ''but certainly a little bit of sugar now and then isn't the worst thing if I eat healthfully on the whole. Wouldn't you say?''
Mycroft's the only one I can trust on Mars, 'cept for the Trees.
Look back down to my mobile messages. From three days back. A string from John. Concerns, roundabout concerns. Wanting to ask without wanting to tell me what was happening. So typical of the soldier. Of Sherlock's loyal and true friend.
How dare he try to tell me to stop. When I've begged him to leave me alone?
I open my mouth to say something - I'm not sure what - when my shoes interact with the edge of a glass splinter. It generates a scratchy sound against the tile.
He wipes at his eyes with the back of his hand, swiftly, as if trying to stop the force of a tide.
His answering grin starts to falter when I don't respond. In fact, I quickly look to John.
I bring over an extra duvet and put it around my flatmate. Once the main room light has been turned off, I can see the blackened smudging of exhaustion under Sherlock's eyes with greater pronouncement.
There is no MH following it.
''How's that going?,'' I say evenly, trying to keep the discussion from terminating prematurely. ''With your therapist? He's helping? If it's a 'he', I mean.''
''It always hurts,'' he whispers. ''But you won't. John. Please.''
She moves the metal around, and touches my ribs. Ghosts over them. I try not to wince.
''Somewhat,'' I say, my voice sounding much more clipped than I had intended.
I do, so I nod.
Suddenly, I have a much greater respect for Mycroft Holmes. While at one point I may have thought of the elder Holmes as being annoyingly meddling - now I see a conflicted sibling, and a staunch advocate. One who, since childhood, has done the best in his own way to save a brother no one else tried to save.
He's telling me to lay off.
I look up and the Mars trees whisper to me, 'We're sorry. We told you to run. We told you to run home.'
The child gives no indication he's heard anything and remains as solid as he had been second before. Finally I see Sherlock's hand reach out to grab hold of Toby's much smaller one. The boy still doesn't move. He doesn't even bat an eye.
''I know enough of what's going on with him,'' I whisper, my chest heavy with overwhelm, ''and I still don't know how to help him.''
''You were mad at me,'' he says gently. ''I wanted to give you space. I don't - I don't want you to leave. I didn't want-''
''It wasn't an accusation.''
''Okay, tilt back now. Going to rinse this stuff out.''
Pascal frowns then. As if my non-hypochondriacal response is somehow unsatisfactory.
His breathing is suddenly faster. I can hear it speed up, being such a close distance to him.
Not in such a context. Not with this fear, these tears and mottled colours on his face.
And what of that little home?
''All you have to do right now is rest. Rest, be still, give yourself a bit of a break. Because you've been pushing yourself for far too long, haven't you, Sherlock?''
"Your stomach hurts?"
After that, I learned to bite my tongue, and didn't say anything when Sherlock started eating dozens of pickles, sliced into long, thin lines that he would dip into salsa, or grey poupon mustard.  Or when he started bringing home miso paste mix and making himself pots and pots of miso soup, cutting up celery and adding it to the watery concoction. He'd even douse the soup (if you could call it a soup) with hot sauce and soy sauce when he was done - something else I found odd.
''Today?,'' I interject. ''Has he agreed to see me later today?''
This was simply a fond reminder that he needed to sleep, just as I needed to sleep.
Sherlock hadn't laughed - merely watched the exchange, slowly pecking at his salmon, and I tried to explain that the actor had been in a fantasy series as a kid, when he informed me that he 'knew that.'
Part of me wants to run towards him, and part of me wants to flee this awful apartment, with its scent of chemicals and science projects.
And when it appears as if he's not going to say anything else, I continue. ''Okay, Sherlock, this is what I think might be going on. Tell me if I'm wrong. You are feeling...off. Ever since this case, certainly, but maybe before this case. In fact, undoubtedly before this case, because your eating has been a bit not good for about five months now, right? So I think maybe you've been becoming more aware about certain subjects ever since I moved in, and it's starting to weigh on your mind more and more.''
''I wanted to, John. And then I realized how completely, unarguably insane that would be. I was feeling so awful, I was so angry – and my first impulse was to feel something else. Something not as wrong, I guess. But hurting myself is wrong, too, isn't it? That's not what I'm supposed to feel when I'm angry, is it? It's a bad response, and I know that, but I still seek it out. And I don't know why.''
and i am sure he's had his flings.
I don't awaken until half past four.
Of course! How would Mycroft learn of it? That John knew in the first place? Unless John was taking matters into his own hand, perhaps?
-----
“Hmm.” Sherlock once again says, putting his massive vocabulary to use.
Alpha. There’s a big difference.” John emphasizes the word mated, and gives Sherlock a moment to calm down as the detective’s eyes start to go back and forth, his brain starting to kick back into gear. The Alpha can see the realization come over his mate’s face and Sherlock relaxes into his hold, then begins scenting him, which prompts John do the same, placing small kisses on his mates bare shoulders, both of them still in the nude.
John was so relaxed he almost doesn’t hear him, comforting and enjoying their synced-up breathing. “Hmmm. How am I right, exactly?” He questions.
The Lords sit back down and start up again, speaking more politely though still through their teeth to each other. The room smelling heavily of the dark pine pheromones John put out, it makes him feel powerful, knowing that he doesn’t even need to speak to dominate and control the other Alphas. Next to him he notices a slight movement and is surprised to see that it’s Sherlock, who is sitting just barely hunched over, hands politely in his lap. It takes a moment for John to realize what movement he saw but once he does, what the teen is doing sends both dread and arousal down John’s spin. The normally perfectly poised Omega is lightly moving his hips in a circle, grinding his ass into the fabric of John’s chair.
“He doesn’t understand why he’s doing certain things, his instincts are pushing him and he has no idea how to react to it. It’s like when Alphas meet we just naturally have a stare down even if neither of us were taught to do so.”
“Well, maybe
I hope you all enjoy and as always this is all just fantasy and I don't condone this behavior in real life. Please stay safe out there everyone!
“Catch — you — later.” Sherlock says, walking toward John in order to keep the pistol trained on the killer.
for each other, implying some sexual lock and key nonsense, or is it because of his mind and the statement doesn’t go deeper than simply “I’m bored, you’re bored, but together we can entertain each other.”
The silence that follows is almost deafening. They had thought only a few minutes ago that they had escaped and then Moriarty had come back. Now he suddenly leaves once again and the two of them hesitate to believe that they’ve gotten away twice.
“N-not that, you know what — what I mean.” Sherlock says breathlessly and squirms under him, wiggling his ass to tempt the Alpha into moving again.
was and your virginity wasn’t fully broken.” John tries his best not to grin even as his Alpha is thrilled that Sherlock will forever perfectly fit on
“You both mean so much to me. I was scared that after all this, I was going to lose you both.” John confesses.
A mating knot takes a long time to go down, so they get plenty of time to be gentle with each other again, now that they have the time. John nuzzles his face against Sherlock’s, rumbling in his chest, thrilled to be mated to the detective. In response the Omega wraps his arms around John’s back and hugs him close.
Samaritan.” He gets out, knowing that Lestrade would never hurt either of them, not just because he’s a police officer but because he’s always been a sucker for Iris as he grew up. Doting on his pup because Lestrade was too career oriented to have his own family, even as he knew he likely had hundreds of his own pups all over the city from years of going to the clinics.
“Meretricious.” The detective says, downplaying his intellect once again.
“Can I have your scarf?” John feels bad asking but the smells are getting to him, his overly sensitive Alpha nose hindering him.
He wants to keep the teen on edge for longer, enjoying listening to Sherlock pant and whine out his name. But his own body is betraying him, he’s thrusting and grinding up into that lithe body, his tip once again right up against the Omega’s womb. It drives him crazy to feel himself so deep, to know he can touch a part of his mate no one else will ever feel. It has his inner Alpha shouting out in victory, claiming such a worthy and wonderful prize.
“Yes — Alpha, yes.” It’s Sherlock’s voice but it’s his Omega speaking. “Mate me,
“And?” Sherlock says, looking down at him.
Pulling his coated fingers from Iris, John wets his cock before placing his thick head at Sherlock’s entrance. His mate moans, his legs spreading further and John takes that as an okay to sink into his hole in one swift motion. The heat and pure bliss of his mate’s inner walls clamping down on him from all sides make him growl out. He releases more scent into the air and can smell when the Omega’s do the same, responding to him. His fingers get placed back into Iris, still slowly stretching the teen, to get him ready. But he can barely concentrate on his task, cock being massaged by Sherlock’s hole clenching around it rhythmically, keeping him warm and surrounded as he sits there. He sinks further in, putting his slightly forming knot in, watching it slowly be swallowed before pulling it out again. It’s shiny and coated in slick, the smell of fresh meadow grass heavier as he puts it in again.
Sherlock responds by shifting up and nipping at John’s lips like the Alpha had done to him, letting him know that the time for being sappy is over, he hasn’t gotten to come yet after being denied twice and he
“Three.” The little pup on the other ends voice is becoming more strained.
The Omega nods his head once, his whole body becoming stiff as he obeys the Alpha’s command. The last bit of the meeting goes off perfectly, the Alphas end their fight and die down as they come to a settlement on whose armies will do what if the King’s army is defeated. John finally speaks after what feels like hours, clearing his throat and agreeing to the Lord’s set terms.
“We haven’t talked.” John states, his blue eyes pinching together, smirk fading, the memories of everything thast happened for the past few days coming back to push his Alpha side down. Memories of Sherlock cross with him, Iris upset and anxious, while he himself was confused and uncertain, trying his best to work it all out while also dealing with Moriarty’s sick games.
“What do you mean it won’t work? You’re an Alpha and he’s a
“No. It was revenge.” Sherlock says the last word with emphasis.
“P-please, please,
Omega. I want you to be
Lestrade comes out of his office happy. “We’ve found it.” He announces as he rushes off.
“My little Omega, your hole fits me so perfectly.” He growls into Sherlock’s ear. “Can you feel how we’re meant to be together, how you’re meant to be under me like this, pleasing
John groans. “He’s going to smell like me.” He says as he puts his forehead on Sherlock’s check, avoiding eye contact, but Sherlock can feel as John’s cock pulses inside of him, the Alpha coming a small bit at the thought of the pup covered in his scent. After a moment John apologizes. “I’m sorry that I like him the way I do. I just want you to know that I was never trying to hurt you, I’ve been trying to get your attention but he kept getting mine.”
“Come on Baby. Come on. Take Alpha’s knot.” John says above him, pushing hard against the rim again, grinding and grinding, feeling the teen letting up.
“YES. YES. YES!” Iris shouts, muffled into Sherlock’s shoulder that his face’s still buried into, but John can still hear him. It spurs him on, making him piston his hips into the teen, going a little rougher than he had with mating Sherlock because his own mate is staring him down and giving him bedroom eyes that demand he don’t hold back. His knot starts to grow with that look and he growls in a bit of frustration that he’s not going to get to go as slow as he wanted because his own mate is more of a temptress than he thought.
“Yes.” Sherlock says.
“Then you could cherish the look of surprise on my face.” He opens his mouth and eyes wide, an over exaggeration before grinning.  “Cause I’d be surprised, Sherlock; really I would.” He scrunches his face up. “And just a teensy bit disappointed. And of course you wouldn’t be able to cherish it for very long.” Sherlock stares unblinking, considering if he should be done with it all. “Ciao, Sherlock Holmes.” Moriarty says before turning around and leaving through the door John came through.
“We’d been sharing about a year. Just sharing.” She says standing to the side to let the two of them have a look around. John is never sure what exactly he’s looking for but he has Iris, so hopefully they’ll make good progress. He notices a large object covered by a sheet and looks to the Beta.
“Your father is going to kill me when he finds out we made his first grandchild on his war chair.” John says it off handedly, not really trying to get any sort of reaction out of the Prince, so he doesn’t expect it when Sherlock moans and clenches down around him. “Bloody Hell.” Is all he gets out as he pulls the tiny body on him as close as he can, unexpectedly coming for a second time, nowhere near a full orgasm but enough that the Alpha is panting in surprise. His knot stays wonderfully plugged in wet heat and he leans his forehead into Sherlock’s spine, trying to control himself against the overwhelming urge to immediately begin rutting into the teen.
The detective blinks slowly and looks down defeated. He thought he was smart enough to take on Moriarty but it appears the man has thought of it all. He’s played John, used the Alpha as a pawn and tried to pit them against each other. He picked the perfect time to implement his plan, because he knew they would have to be separate for a time and he could manipulate the situation to break them.
The Alpha grabs a nearby pillow, briefly registering that they never turned the correct way on the bed, before shoving it under Sherlock’s hips for support, lifting him up into a better position. As much as taking him from behind would be easier and definitely more comfortable, he wants their first time to be face to face, as corny as it sounds. He wants to see the satisfaction he gives his new mate, wants to see what he looks like when he’s ramming into him.
Philosophy...Physics.
But I didn't mean to hurt him.
''Yes? Hello?,'' I say again, in rapid succession.
''I didn't care one whit if he were a Holmes. Because I did not care about lineage. But I did not want him to be cast aside, John. And, even as a child - even before he was born - I knew that was to be his fate. I thought, stupidly, that if I gave him a name that brought pride to the Holmes family, that one day the weight of the name would raise their estimation of Sherlock. I thought - in that way small children sometimes do - that I could make something better because I wished so hard for it to be better. I might as well have believed in faeries.''
Lestrade had to restrain him.
''Alright,'' he mutters.
Eventually he ate a few, chewing them slowly. Deep sips of water between each bite.
''It started when I was 11,'' I state evenly. Sounding strangely calm. Feeling strangely calm, and strangely disconnected.
I smile at him in my mind.
The taste is making me want to scream.
We do more to bear witness to the deaths of monsters.
''My weight's fine.''
"It means I had to come home during summer break."
Recollections

For a second, anxiety blooms in my bowels. For a second - I wonder if John has mentioned something more to Lestrade. Something more about me.
But worse than the broken bone was how it made me feel wrong. About myself. A bad son. Not only was I terrified my teachers would find out (and so conveniently left my sports kit at home multiple days in a row, even though it was eventually discovered - the injury, if not the cause) but I vowed to never be 'bad' like that again. Of course, I was 7 and I had been lashed until the backs of my thighs and the soft skin of my knees bled - but it wasn't child abuse. Not in my mind.
But it had been the first evening we had ever eaten a meal together.
Mrs. Hudson pauses from taking a sip and nods in my direction, ''There is that, of course. Bit of a sparrow with his eating, isn't he?''
“Okay,” I say carefully. “What do you want to talk about?”
He's still healing from the gastrectomy, and I must not forget that. Many people do lose weight naturally after such a surgery and most feel nauseated.
Yuri was quiet for another moment, then clarified.
Definitely not.
And for that, especially right now, I am grateful.
''I will try,'' he re-emphasizes. ''Didn't I just insinuate that very point?''
He swallows.
I have no idea how to help him through this.
''So what's upsetting you? Right now?''
Sherlock knotted the gauze, bit at the ends with his teeth, then rolled Toby's red and blue shirt back over the temporary binding.
My brilliant friend.
There was something grounding about recalling the events that seem so nebulous, with renewed colour. The original memory, of course, is generally hazy - which is a fact that generates alarming anxiety for me. Any time before when I had fashioned my mind palace feels somewhat unreal, and I've always been afraid of that very thing: feeling unreal. And those memories? Those precise memories?
But when someone has always been lean, and then take to wearing baggier clothes - you don't immediately think 'eating disorder.'
Cold East Indian food sounds perfect for a morning meal, and I'm not even joking. Which is a good thing, considering the flat is low on anything actually edible.
The cabbie gives me a quick look as I reach for the door handle.
''Alright,'' I confirm.
I touch his forehead. It feels damp. Similar to how he felt earlier at the hospital after getting sick.
''Sherlock?,'' I qualify.
I feel him nod, instead of seeing the action. My gaze strays away from us. Somewhere away from us both. Plasters its sight on the wall.
Then panting.
''I'm not giving up on you,'' I whisper. ''You know that, don't you?''
''No; I think Toby's father is gay. I think he's always identified as gay, but has never been out. I think if he's having an affair - it's undoubtedly with a man. I think Mrs. Thiessen suspects - deep down - that her husband prefers men to women, sexually if not romantically too, but I believe they both love one another, or initially loved one another and since then...they both are more or less keeping up appearances. Which is usually detrimental to relationships. I don't believe Mrs. Thiessen suspects her husband is cheating, and I think that her husband feels sick about what he's done, because he still cares about her well being. He doesn't want to hurt her, anyway.''
His throat is bobbing up and down with pain.
Yuri's eyes close for a bare moment, then open to look straight into mine.
And then I close the book, and the child with the vacant stare is lost between the pages.
His face flinches, his eyebrows cinch together like material pulled too sharply under a sewing machine. Bunching up.
My hands curl around the bow, and I feel the horse hairs line up against my palm.
''Sherlock! Open the door!''
It was silly of me to think that Yuri's suggestions of an attachment disorder wouldn't wedge their way into the conversation sooner or later.
''Yes, Sherlock?''
John gives me a sympathetic smile, then ushers me to his place, quickly clearing away his own dishes. I smear a drop of blood-ketchup with my finger.
Author's notes: I have such limited time these days. I wish I had more free time; I've been aching to update for weeks, now. I apologize for the delays...trust me, 90 hour work weeks equal limited productivity. I appreciate everyone's continued support and understanding. :)
''I should be alone,'' Sherlock repeats, dulled. His head is tilted at a strange angle, rhythmic motions of fingertips counting out beats at his side.
Routine things with interesting twists.
''Mrs. Hudson, and Lestrade and Mike and Molly and many, many others deeply care for you and respect you, and you don't even know it, do you?''
Most of all, I try to remind myself that the significance of this moment doesn’t have to be overwhelming. I can let myself stay in this space for a little while longer and accept whatever small comforts I am taking from this time – and not rush mentally onwards to bigger or weightier days or events that could be on the horizon.
------------------------------------------
Lestrade nods.
My hands feel sweaty.
My eyes glance back down at my mobile, at the last text sent.
Toby shrugs, then goes back to staring at his book. He abruptly closes it, his eyes flashing up to mine suddenly.
sherlock. you love victor, don't you?'
''Pain?''
I hold out my hands, instinctively.
''Where the hell do you think you're going?,'' I growl.
I fall back into my comforter and force myself a bit more rest.
''No! I don't. I find it bewildering and, yes, at times - I find it scary. But I find it...all of it...outside of my comprehension. I find it pernicious, too, which it is. I see how it has you caught up in it's claws. It's like a monster, Sherlock. One that has grasped you, and has twisted you into it's shape. I know you think you are the one in control, and I know why control is such a big deal for you, but this disorder has taken any control you had away.''
''Why are you trying to make me upset, John?,'' and his voice is warbling. ''Did Mycroft put you up to this? Overweight oaf thinks anyone who isn't horrendously obese is sick, so I expect this from him. But this? This is not funny at all.''
''Don't, Greg. He'd -,'' I stop abruptly. ''Whatever you are thinking right now - you have to stop thinking about. If Sherlock has something he needs to talk about and-,'' I stop here entirely, letting the obvious sentiment of my words hang in the air, voiced without sound.
We moved along the cobblestone for several minutes in total silence, and I ignored the squealing sound of Bisquick as I walked off.
Even the approaching sight of Baker Street doesn't lessen my agitation, and as Sherlock retrieves his keys and hurries himself with getting inside, I pause for a moment, taking in the form of this frail man, his leanness distorting his proportions. He looks almost supernatural in his physical expression, not unlike a creature crafted from wire.
Brilliant, but vulnerable.
Lestrade pauses, evaluates what to say next.
''What?,'' I colour. I can feel it. The heat rush in. ''Oh, I wasn't-''
If he wants to talk about an issue, he will - on his own time.
“Shut up,” I murmur, my heart not really in the retort.
To my credit, they were only dreams. Not consciously brought about for my own pleasure. Not fantasies in the truest sense, not in the way that most use the term.
''No, but John - he left in a hurry afterwards. He looked enraged. They sedated the boy, and he stayed with Toby until they were done the exam - but then he just left. I asked him to wait, and he just ignored me outright. He looked - volatile.''
Take care, guys. Each and everyone of you. No matter what ails you.
A strange disconnected feeling is building in my head. As if I am falling from a very high platform.
Egotistical.
''What's the problem?,'' I asked carefully.
I hear a rushed exhalation of breath.
