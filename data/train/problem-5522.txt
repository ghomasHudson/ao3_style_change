Tony was currently in between 2 of the scariest ladies he knew. Nat and Pepper, Nat was the only one who use to join him in the meetings with Ross but once when the meeting went really bad and Nat was almost labeled as a terrorist and Tony was almost cornered by Ross Pepper decided to intervene and remind Ross where he belonged. Pepper knew Tony and Nat were bounded by the Accords and couldnt do much but she could. That is when they revised the Accords and got everything fixed. Carol was not allowed in these meetings anymore as last time she almost blew Ross's head with her blast.
"I just contacted Happy he will be outside when we reach there and you both leave me alone for a week and enjoy" Tony said.
"No I just want to go home" Tony replied with his voice still hoarse. Steve was about to argue but Carol just nodded at Steve.
"Hi Carol, I see you have made plans for me already and have started babysitting me. So are you going to Feed me as well and change my diaper"
"As if I need that, now go away I have to go for a meeting with Ross" Tony said. Stephen just hugged him and Tony saw Steve avert his eyes.
"Listen Punk you getting dressed like this and trying to impress. You and the Strange guy looking at each other. We get it. In other words you have competition and we understand" Bucky said
After dinner Tony has announced it was time to leave. Lila wanted to stay which had made Laura and Nathaniel stay behind. Cooper had said clearly that he did not want to stay and came to stand with Tony and Peter who were ready to leave.
"No Nat and stop waning him about me. Carol had a word with him and you know how he goes into guilt. Just leave it the way it is. I will speak to him" Tony replied. Tony knew he had to apologise to Steve. Nat just nodded
"Hey Babe-" she moved back. That hurt all he wanted after these 2 years were to take his family in his arms and he had no idea what had happened. Everyone else was shocked to see Tony with a kid and how did he knew the family so well. They just met once Steve thought.
As soon as the reached the medical floor they could hear them fighting. "-doctor you have to look at him before I am lightly scratched his leg is burned pay attention to him" Carol replied to something. Before the doctor could speak Rhodey spoke up "I have 2 people already patching my leg so let him look at you or I wont let them do mine". Tony mentally rolled his eyes as if Carol would be threatened by that. "You do that and I will blast your head off James this is serious and-" Carol was cut off as the door opened and they all entered. Carol had a few scrapes on her face and arms but Rhodey's left leg had received a third degree burn and you could easily see the flesh. As soon as Tony saw them he went towards Carol and hugged her. He was so glad that they both were alive.
"Do you think we can find our way together one day? You are all I want Tony" Steve whispered the last part but he knew Tony heard it.
"You were having a nervous breakdown we had to tranquillise you. It has been 4 hours we were expecting you to sleep for 6 hours at least. Tony is okay he is in the room beside you." Carol replied.
"I know Kid, I love you too" Tony closed his eyes in the elevator hoping to reach his floor and throw his stuff in a bag, have the dreaded talk and leave.
"What you thinking about?" Tony whispered and Steve stopped moving his arm and stilled. "Nothing really I am just thinking about Pepper and Happy. I am happy for them" Steve replied and placed a kiss on Tony's head. "I know I will be an uncle Steve and I will spoil the kid although I am sure Happy and Pep will kill me but who cares" Tony said smiling. He had already made a list of what he was going to buy and what he had to create he could make a baby's walker and-his thought process was interrupted. "Do you want kids? I mean we spoke about this before but I just wanted to know if you still want to raise one with me" Steve asked. Steve held his breath he knew he always wanted to have kids with Tony but he wasn't sure after all that happened Tony would want kids. Tony wasnt sure how to reply Steve it should be a yes but they werent ready to have kids right now and he did not want to hurt Steve but he knew he had to reply. "Yes I mean I want kids with you but like not tomorrow like one day you know" Steve just replied hmm. Tony sighed and he knew this was a big responsibility and they couldn't bring a kid in the current situation. They need to be more stable but he just couldnt say this to Steve.
"Tony can you please call me Steve" Tony knew how much he liked listening his name from his lips. He use to moan his name out loud when Steve use to drag him to edge. But no Tony did not want to remember anything. He just rolled his eyes and looked at his watch clearly indicating dont waste my time.
"I also made tiramisu for desert" Steve said and Tony smiled. They ate quietly just talking about general stuff. It felt like nothing was wrong and they were having a meal like they use to do but everything was different. Steve was different and so was he.
"Oh I completely forgot Carol and I am not even sure if I should go I mean they are here who will look after them and with the whole pardon and accords I am not sure if I can leave them alone" Tony said completely ignoring Steve.
Tony was shocked was Steve asking him out. He did not know what he wanted to do kiss him or laugh but he knew how nervous Steve was and he felt ready but was he really ready? He wanted to be with Steve but those 2 years wont go away. Steve was nervous, he should have not asked about this right now when Tony was hurt. It was just Tony's words which made him crazy. He sighed after a while. Tony was still staring at him.
Tony had upgraded the equipment for everyone and he had told everyone to meet in the common room. Bruce was with him and helped him carrying all the stuff.
Once they reached the common room they saw Nat and Sam sitting there. As soon as they saw their faces everyone knew the bad news wasnt over. "I contacted Clint and he is on his floor. He just returned. They were at the airport when Clint saw people in mask looking for them. I think they were tailing them because they knew they were there. He took a taxi back to the tower and is getting the kids settled. I was with them and couldnt make it to the medical" Nat replied. "Are the kids okay?" Tony asked. He adored those kids and if something would happen to them he didnt want to think about it. "Yeah the kids didnt know all they knew was that their trip got cancelled" Nat replied. "Sam whats the situation?" Steve asked. "Scott said people broke into Cassie's place but her step dad is in the police and handled it fine but they are now at Pym's place and scott will come by tomorrow" Sam replied.
"Stephen do you have feelings for me?" Tony asked. He just wanted to be clear with Stephen because sometimes Tony could see something in Stephens eyes which wasnt just normal care. He wanted to know this because he did not wanted to hurt his friend.
"We all make mistakes Steve. We have to move on and show we can improve and be a better person" Sam said after a while.
"I cooked some lasagne I hope you dont mind" Steve said. Steve remembered how much Tony loved Italian food and he loved his lasagne.
"I know, anything else I can do for you?" Tony asked he just wanted to be alone because he knew soon he had to go get the kids and go back to the mansion.
"Yeah, whatever but we have a team meeting tomorrow at 2 remember and I want everyone there no excuse" Tony replied and walked away.
"Clint that is enough you are not in you right mind. We will talk later."Tony argued. He was calm he knew the kids were around and did not wanted to say something which will upset them anymore. The kids had gone up with Peter. He had made an eye contact with Peter to take the kids to his floor.
The man then proceed to strike Tony hard on the ribs drawing out a muffled cry in surprise from him and again struck him with as much force on his left leg. Tony struggled again for balance as blood pooled along down his arms.
Being a natural leader and having the responsibility of heading the Avengers, Steve knew the importance of good strategy, planning and correct formation and implemented these methods with ease. There had been quite a few attacks in and around the city since Loki’s attempted invasion but it was nothing the Avengers couldn’t handle. What Steve couldn’t seem to handle was Tony’s tendency to completely disregard said orders and rush head long into unknown and dangerous situations.
There was little more they could do for Tony till they got there other than to keep watch over him and monitor his vitals. Without question, Steve had placed himself directly by Tony's side sitting crouched on the floor right beside him, and nothing on this earth could make Steve leave his side, not now,-
Tony's heart rang in his ears as his whole body began to shake, it wasn't possible, no... It couldn't be true, he couldn't be right, Steve didn't-
Tony desperately demanded only to be stuck again just as hard on the other side of the head. Pure pain filled his senses and he almost blacked out. He received no answer from the man who now came into his field of vision. Starting straight down at Tony he held a look of pure contempt and disgust but Tony didn't recognise the face, couldn't place his accent and was no closer to guessing as to where he was being held.
“STEVE! Steve can you hear me?! Steve come on we can do this- we gotta get out of here!!” Tony called only to see Steve feebly struggle where he knelt. Tony couldn't see his face with the hood covering it, but could just about hear his ragged harsh breathing.
he repeated a second time. His breathing then became more erratic as he seemed to channel a burst of energy to cry out, “he
“I'm sorry buddy but seriously- you've got the wrong guy, Steve and I are friends so sorry to disappoint but no matter what you do to me, he’ll keep on going- and so will the Avengers,” Tony spoke with certainty, though it left him feeling hollow to voice how Steve would only ever see him as a friend.
Fury could be seen working away on the other half of the screen, he shook his head in frustration, “Oh that's clever, the Fuckers have it scrambled- it'll take some time to even be able to make sense of it Captain before we can track it,” Nick said in frustration. “We’ll keep working on it but you guys need to see if there is any intel at all that you can gather from this, anything at all that we can work with.”
The captor brought the knife up to the cloth covering Tony's eyes and sliced it off in one slick stroke.
“He won't be awake for some time, but you can sit with him- they’re taking him down to a private recovery room now, I'll take you there,” Bruce offered kindly.
The water began to retreat and inch by inch, the it was replaced by blessedly breathable air. Tony was so exhausted by this emotional rollercoaster that he felt light-headed and the shock to his system had his knees give out under him. The temporary relief to his aching legs was only to be overshadowed by the searing pain of his wrists taking his full weight and his cuts re-opening underneath his bonds.
and he needed to be ready- he didn't know what the situation was outside of this room and he may need to run... may need to fight- even in his condition he'd give it his best damn shot if it meant freedom, he needed to be ready for anything.
as all Tony did was continue to stare- almost hollowly into Steve's eyes... And then he looked down to where his right hand was held in Steve's, and then gently squeeze his grasp, as if testing, as if
Tony was shaking and panting heavily with sweat freely falling from his low hung head. Steve felt a wave of crushing anguish overcome him, he had to get to Tony, a had to get him away from there- and fast.
Bruce was quick but precise in his ministrations of first aid, he hurriedly packed the stab area around the knife with thick bandaging and reapplied new ties to help slow the bleeding from the wound. Steve then watched as he fully and carefully checked the rest of the damage done to the inventor. He suddenly felt a wash of unbelievable rage as he saw the darker bruising under Tony's shirt along his chest, the mix of bleeding and healing wounds and the steadily and obviously reopened bleeding welts across his back. Steve started to breathe deeper as he felt his hands start to shake and his eyes slowly fill as he witnessed first hand the hurts Tony had endured.
As they finished up what they could, Steve's eyes were drawn to Tony's hand as the genius slowly took each of his fingers into his own mouth to remove the cream he’d somehow managed to make a mess with, and by the time the last digit left Tony's mouth- Steve had practically stopped breathing.
Unarmed and now unprotected, Steve didn't hold back in his attack, he struck at every part of the man’s body he knew would cause the most pain, he just couldn't hold back after all these days of torture he'd watched Tony endure, he was so lost within his lust for revenge that he nearly struck at Clint when he attempted to pull Steve away.
The heavy thumping of his heart was the only thing he could feel as a wave of disbelief flooded over his body, what the
Steve watched as Tony begged him to move, begged him to try and pleaded with him to live,- he screamed for help and the utter hysteria in his voice, the pure pain and distress he was showing for Steve had his heart beating dangerously fast,- his eyes filled with tears which freely flowed down his face as Tony began to softly comfort the dying man in front of him, telling him he was there and telling him he was
Back at the tower Tony was still being blasé about his injuries, and fully refusing Steve’s order to go get himself checked over at medical.
There was a steady stream of blood flowing from Tony’s arm but luckily it didn't look too heavy, and most of the pieces of glass didn’t look particularly deep set, so Steve ran to where he knew the first aid kit was and returned to Tony’s side. He’d seen Tony drunk many times since moving in to the tower, but for some reason he appeared totally out of it this time, like he’d had one too many and then some- it made Steve wonder what had driven him to this, and why now?
So far things were going very well between the two of them, they hadn't done much other than being close to one another and kissing really since Tony's recovery took main priority, but Tony was a great kisser, Steve wasn’t embarrassed to say that he didn't have much experience in that... Or any other department, but as Tony had suggestively said a few days back- it was no problem, he had all the time in the world to learn.
Thank you very much for all the kudos and the lovely comments I've received, I can't stop smiling!!!!! <3
Tony then shifted in Steve's lap and slowly lined up their cocks taking both into his hand .... Then started to gently stroke and pump his fist up and down. They were both of them now panting in unison, and Steve let out an almost yelp when Tony brushed his hand over their weeping heads which only added slickness to the motion of Tony's movement.
sorry for what you've been through, I'm sorry we didn't get to you sooner, I'm sorry we couldn't stop them,- God Tony I
and there was still no news of Tony! A report had reached the Avengers saying that a member of the public had seen a man who looked very much like Tony Stark get shot at and swiftly bundled into the back of an unmarked van which had driven off in speed. Jarvis had confirmed that Tony had indeed left the building and had not returned that night. He also informed the Avengers that Tony had taken neither a phone nor his repulsor bracelets and was therefore both unprotected and unable to communicate with them when he was taken.
And seeing that was all it took to tip Steve over the edge as his own orgasm ripped through him and he came into Tony’s now gentile grasp.
The  deafening silence in the room was only broken by the sounds of Tony’s laboured breathing, that was until he heard the sound of water. He looked over to the grated vent above the locked door and at first there was a trickle of water slowly seeping through it, which increasingly turned into a steady gushing flow ...
Steve's breath shuddered as he once again looked deep into Tony's eyes and wondered at how it was possible to love the man in front of him any more.
“Oh dear God no....,” Steve was staring wide eyed and in utter dismay at what he could see. Tony was again bound by the wrists with his arms suspended and secured above his head, he appeared more alert this time, but it was horrifically obvious that the main reason for Tony's sharpness was because his whole body was physically reeling against the steadily rising level of water around his waist.
With a cry born more of shock than pain, Steve turned quickly on his heel raising his shield just in time to block a second attack.
His bound wrists made it more awkward than difficult to eat, but with every slight movement the metal scraped and dug at the raw and still bleeding wounds about his wrists. Mercifully, the cuts and slashes he'd obtained weren’t too deep, and though they were saw- they'd thankfully stopped bleeding as much.
Steve called quietly, praying for Tony to remain calm as possible this time. Then, like a thirst being quenched- Steve couldn't hold back the sound of relief when Tony slowly opened his eyes and looked straight into Steve's.
It was beginning to worry Steve that they had heard nothing, with at least some communication they could try to track a signal, recognise a location or even the kidnapper and attempt to put a decent rescue plan into action, but as it currently stands, S.H.I.E.L.D have been unable to track the van that had taken Tony and there was little else to go by in attempting to find him.
Tony notice again the camera that was set to the side and out of reach,- the red light glaring at him made him feel horribly self conscious.  He was so sure that it would be used to make a ransom video, just like his captors had done in Afghanistan, however he had no idea if it had been used yet or not, if he knew when it was filming then surely he could try to send a message somehow- anything that may help his friends to find him. It just seemed that he would have to wait and use it to his advantage when the time comes, if the time comes.....
Steve was slowly but surely losing his mind, Nick Fury assured him that S.H.I.E.L.D was doing everything in their power to locate Stark and the rest of the Avengers were working round the clock in a bid to find him.
"We can debate it more after you hit me again," Steve said, and he smiled at him once more, in satisfaction, when he picked up the second flogger, as if seeing Tony naked and holding a flogger had been some kind of life goal.
He slid his hand a little farther down, covering the buckle of the belt now, the way Steve had. His fingers smoothed over the metal of the buckle, the leather of the strap, so close to where Steve desperately needed his hand to be.
"About the inside of my head?" Iron Man shrugs again, an abortive motion. Steve imagines the man inside the armor, trapped there. Unable to show his true feelings, and considering it a blessing. "No, not really."
It was going to be okay. Tony could avoid them. He swerved left around the first bolt, and then hit the bootjets to get him up and over the second. With his hands up for defense, rather than down for flight stabilization, he nearly botched the landing entirely, cutting the repulsors and coming down hard, with nothing to cushion the drop. He hit the floor, wobbled, and raised his hands higher--
Tony looked up at him now, seeming to realize that they were doing politeness backwards. "Thank you," he said, solemn and earnest. "Not just for the tea, I mean. For-- for everything. You've been... if I said you've been
Iron Man raises his free hand to try to stop him. The gauntlet is dented and scraped, the repulsor still dim.
He wonders if Iron Man would want to tell more people about them, someday. He wonders if Iron Man would hold his hand in public.
"And yet," Tony said, pressing himself a little closer to the side of the warehouse and thereby closer to Steve, "here I am, at your service, and it's not even date night. We could have been going skinny-dipping in the Mountain hot springs again if you'd played your cards right."
When Steve snaps his head up, Mr. Stark's face is a sallow, sickly yellow-gray. Sweat beads on his skin. And he has a hand pressed to his chest. Something's very wrong with him.
Steve's brow furrows. "How do you know my name?" He does put his fists down a little. Maybe it's the American accent.
Then Steve was hoisting him over his shoulders like a sack of flour. He stretched Tony across himself, Tony's whole torso balanced all along Steve's shoulders, with his legs dangling down one of Steve's arms and his face pressed into the star of the uniform on Steve's upper arm, his own arms dangling one on either side of Steve's body. Steve grabbed the arm that was on his front with the hand that had been bracing Tony's knees, pulling them together so that he was, more or less, holding Tony's hand across his own body. Steve's fingers were scraped and the leather of the gloves was rough. It was weirdly intimate.
"Yeah, I'm fine," Steve admitted, feeling a little foolish. "Just can't figure out if I was supposed to shave there, is all."
Silence fills the room. All the color drains out of Mr. Stark's face. Steve watches in mounting horror. He never thought it could go this badly. He's going about this all wrong. He didn't mean it to sound like a demand. And he nearly forgot the rest of what he wanted to say. He wants to do this properly. He's not quite sure if they still do this in this century, but this is how he was raised. He's never proposed to anyone before -- and hopefully he never will again, God willing -- and he wants to get everything right. He only has one shot at this.
Tony's laugh was mostly air. "Gosh, I can't imagine who in my life might have provided me with a rough cut of your planned television appearance, can you?" His smile wasn't at all pleasant, a cold sneer. Steve thought perhaps he'd last seen it on Tiberius' face. "Maybe if you think very, very hard, the answer will occur to you." Every word was precisely articulated. "Though if you'd been thinking, really, would any of this have happened?"
That was how Tiberius had done it, wasn't it? Just enough praise to keep Tony hungry for it, to make him do anything to get more. And then he could do whatever he wanted. It wasn't like Tiberius hadn't known Tony. He'd known it would work. And it had.
Iron Man blows out a heavy breath. "I'm selfish," he begins. His voice is trembling. "When you asked me out, I should have said no. It would have been the right thing to do. The responsible thing to do."
Ghost slams the device down on the back of his neck, and it's like a lightning strike. Steve hears himself screaming. His muscles go limp. He can't quite move. Even the slightest twitch of his wrist is agony.
"More," Iron Man agrees, softly. His voice is halting, like he thinks Steve will say no now that he knows what Iron Man wants. Steve gets the impression Iron Man doesn't tell too many people what he actually wants. But Iron Man definitely wants this.
"Yes?" Steve said, cautiously. "I really, really liked it. Was there something else you'd been expecting from me? Because if there's something you need, I can--"
Steve couldn't quite get the right words, somehow. There were no eloquent Captain America speeches for him. Not about this. "I'm not ashamed of you," he told Tony. "I'm not. I'm proud of you, and I'm proud to love you. In an ideal world, I'd want to tell everyone how lucky I am that you love me. But I know there are considerations. I'm okay with... not volunteering the information. If that's what you want. It feels like there's a difference between not telling and lying. To me, there is. I'm okay with not telling. But I don't want to lie. I don't want to pretend I'm single. I don't want to pretend I'm looking for someone new."
Steve doesn't know where the question comes from, for all that he's the one who asks it; he certainly hasn't been planning to ask it. But it seems right. He and Iron Man have been together for months. He's serious about Iron Man, he'd like to think Iron Man is serious about him, and it just... seems like something he should know. He should find out if they're on the same page here.
Tony was studying him, watching his reaction. "Huh," he said, thoughtfully. "I guess Rhodey never told you about her, then."
The words were easy, casual, and they carried with them an implication that Steve hadn't heard in-- God, it must have been decades. Steve wasn't one of
"That's not true," Steve replies, automatically, but he thinks that perhaps he's starting to see what Iron Man means by
"To Ty's thing." Tony waved a hand, inarticulately, and Steve's heart sank. He hadn't meant it. "Gala. Party. Celebration. Whatever. I've got a plus-one, and I mean, it's not like I'm seeing anyone anymore."
Tony's grin was dangerously sharp, the way he looked sometimes before a battle he knew he was going to win, and once again Steve was hot all over. "So am I," Tony murmured.
," Tony breathed against his lips, between kisses, and it looked like any way he kissed Tony was fine by Tony as long as he kept touching him while he did it. He could do that.
There's bare skin under the gauntlets, the bracers, the epaulets -- all the way up Tony's arm to his shoulder. When Steve runs his fingers over Tony's bicep, he finds that Tony is trembling with exhaustion, with the drop, and his skin is tacky, clammy with sweat. He gets his hands on the shoulders of the chestplate and looks up to see Tony's wan smile. Tony's face is still patchy and tear-stained.
There's a heavy pressure against his back, and an invisible hand wraps around Steve's throat. Damn it. Steve gasps for breath, trying to pry Ghost's fingers off, as his other hand fumbles over his shoulder for his-- shield, where's his shield,
Steve's phone beeped again. It was definitely his phone, not his identicard. Sounded like a text message. That was good; it meant it wasn't an emergency. However, the Avengers had probably expected him at the mansion hours ago. Tony's actual company had probably expected him hours ago, too.
Mr. Stark slowly settles back into his chair. "Okay," he says, very softly, and Steve can't help but feel like he's said something wrong, though he doesn't know what. "If you're certain."
Tony glanced up at him, amused. "Wow, that blush goes pretty far down, huh? Nice." He seemed to like it. Which was good, because it wasn't as if Steve could stop doing it.
Iron Man's eyes are bright, and he laughs another static laugh. "It's so kind of you to assume I'm a gentleman, Winghead." And he steps just a little closer. It's enough.
"So I was thinking that, just for safety's sake," Jan continued, while Steve's whole brain remained completely stuck on the thought of
"Yeah," Tony said, stubbornly, "but that's exactly why I was supposed to have the damn safeguards. It was alive. It wasn't Ultron, either. Or Jocasta. It was... itself. The same way Jocasta isn't Jan. The same way Vision isn't Simon. As soon as I figured out what had happened, I tried to transfer the armor's consciousness into something that wasn't, you know, a heavily-armed suit of armor. I could see that that was going to be a bad idea. But it had already bonded to the armor. I couldn't move it without killing it. And then it deactivated Jocasta. And that was when I
Even the rest of the Avengers had gone home already. But Steve-- well, Steve couldn't ever resist a chance to hang out with Tony, could he?
"I'd like to talk about it," Steve ventured, feeling more than a little guilty for pressing Tony about anything at all when he was this bad. "But only if you're okay with talking about it. I know you've had... a hell of a time lately."
Tony laughed softly. "Hey, Winghead, you remember that time a couple years ago when I personally went on a killing spree? Killed three people. Nearly killed Jan. Nearly killed that teenage version of myself, too. You want to guess what you
Oh. Steve kept regular, plain bandages for adults with the rest of his tiny first-aid kit in one pouch; in another pouch, he had some for children. He'd given Tony one of the ones for children. It had a shiny little Iron Man on it. All the ones he had were Iron Man because-- well, that was obvious, wasn't it?
The last piece of rope is tying Tony's arms together, behind his back, from his biceps all the way down to his wrists in little bands of rope every few inches. Tony's arms are stretched out behind him on the mattress. He can't even touch himself. He can't do anything. He's Steve's to touch, tonight.
That was a hell of a double-bind. If he told Tony he thought the world of him, Tony would have no way to know it wasn't a dream. Because apparently Steve would have told him that in a dream, too. There was nothing he could tell Tony that Tony would believe was real. Even the good things.
Steve starts running anyway as Iron Man launches himself into the air, and by the time Iron Man has flown in through the open window, Steve has reached the building itself. The residents are pouring out the front door, and Steve takes charge.
Tony's mouth pulled to the side. "The reason never changes, I'm afraid. Same reason I never told you I was Iron Man. I was afraid you'd bench me if you knew I had heart problems. Just like I'm afraid you'll bench me now. And I-- I've never wanted to give up the Avengers. I couldn't risk that. I've never been able to risk that."
He usually did want to tape up his hands, both because he liked to set a good example for everyone else who actually did need the extra protection, and also because, even though he did heal fast, that didn't mean that he wanted to take damage that he didn't have to take.
"I'm touched," Tony returned. There was a brief flash of emotion Steve couldn't quite make out, a softening of his gaze. And then it was gone, too quickly to identify, replaced with a lighthearted smile. "And I'm also curious about what's so wrong with your coffee."
But now Steve isn't just warm. He's undeniably hot, fever-hot. At this distance, Tony can see that his eyes are just a little brighter than they should be, and there's a fine sheen of sweat along his jaw.
She let him go, but held him at arm's length for a few more seconds, inspecting him before letting him go.
"Okay," Steve said. His tea was far too hot; he didn't know how Tony was drinking it. "So. I know this was something that happened to you when your armor was sentient. I figured out that much. Your mission report did mention cardiac damage. But your report was a little... vague... about what had happened, and exactly how it had happened."
"You're not supposed to be here right now," Tony said, as he edged around the corrugated-metal corner of the warehouse.
"He was right," Tony said, low, miserable. "He was right. All I ever do is cry. I'm-- I'm pathetic, aren't I? How can you even put up with me?"
Steve should have wanted Tony to be happy. If he were a good friend, he told himself, that's what he really should have wanted for Tony. It shouldn't have mattered that Tony had other friends. It wasn't that he minded Tony having friends, because he didn't. But something about this man's very existence was rubbing Steve the wrong way.
He sets Tony down on the bed, brushes Tony's hair back for him, and then busies himself with getting out of the uniform. Sex probably isn't something that's happening tonight, but Steve knows that if Tony has a choice about it he'd rather cuddle Steve when Steve isn't wearing a mail shirt. And besides, Steve wants to touch him. So he perches on the edge of the bed and starts taking his boots off.
Steve had skipped his usual morning run for the past two days, not wanting to risk jarring his healing hand. Now it was the morning of the third day since-- since everything, and Steve opened his eyes to find that it was 9:15, and he supposed he was skipping his run today, too.
And then he jerked his chin across the table, where the Daily Bugle photographer was standing there, camera in his hands, looking like he couldn't believe what he'd seen.
"You feel so nice." Steve found that his voice was hushed, like this was something sacred. Maybe it was.
He had armor, he told himself. He could take a hit or two. It wasn't ideal, but that was what the armor was for, right? He was going to be fine. He was going to be--
Steve tried again. "I could tell you something about myself you don't know. Something you'd never guess."
"Eh." Tony wanted to shrug; the armor wasn't going to let him move his shoulders. "I was proud of it then, but I've made so many more improvements to it now. That old stuff is just... kind of embarrassing. Even setting aside the one with the nose armor."
Tony knew he was still gripping Steve's cock, pressing it harder against his, as Steve was whimpering with overstimulation, and, God, Tony was almost there, almost there--
Steve pulled off for half a second, licked his palm, and wrapped it around the base of Tony's cock, the way Tony had done for him -- but a little tighter than he would have for himself, the way he thought Tony might like it.
"Steve?" Tony's eyes cloud with confusion as Steve twists halfway around to face him. "What are you doing?"
the fish, with portions sized for his metabolism. That was just how Tony was. He never forgot the little things.
He didn't believe in Tony, and Tony needs him, Tony needs him to be strong, but instead Steve isn't quite there. He's raw and guilty, and he knows he--
"Oh," Tony breathes, entranced, and Steve leans up and kisses him, as Tony relaxes into his embrace.
"ViaStone channels have been at the forefront of the accusations against Tony." Steve's voice was level, but his hands were shaking. "You were the first network to accuse Tony of Whiplash's murder, and in our conversation here you've accused him of the murder of Radioactive Man and your own news crew. You don't have a shred of evidence against him -- for any of this -- and you know it. He doesn't deserve this. You're tearing his life apart for your ratings, and I think you owe him an apology. Actually, I think your CEO owes him an apology."
been asking Mr. Stark for dating tips -- and, heck, Steve doesn't know, maybe he has been. "I have a few suggestions."
Tony's mouth is half-open. "You mean that?" he asks, and there's a light in his eyes that hasn't been there since -- well, since earlier this evening. He looks... enthralled. Enraptured. In a very, very good way. He chuckles. "That's a dumb question, I know. It's
Did Tony really like this guy? Tony was rich, sure, but he wasn't showy about it. Not like this. He didn't flaunt it. He dressed up for company, but left to his own devices, Steve knew Tony would rather be wearing oil-stained jeans, safety goggles, and a faded t-shirt printed with a poem about quarks. Tony didn't taunt people with what he had. How could Tony be friends with someone who did?
"I'm not straight," Steve repeated. "Seriously, Tony, do a lot of straight guys kiss you? With tongue? I'm betting not."
Tony tugged on Steve's hand again, a little more forcefully, and only succeeded in tugging Steve's glove halfway off. Steve pulled back a little and freed his hand entirely, and then set his bare palm gingerly against Tony's faceplate. One finger curled around the edge of an eye-slit, partially obscuring his vision.
It's a long day -- and the bizarre conversation with Mr. Stark certainly didn't help matters -- but Iron Man shows up at Steve's door that evening, and that instantly makes the rest of this terrible day worth it.
It hadn't gotten them any closer to getting Tony's clothes off, but Steve definitely wasn't going to complain, seeing as how Tony was very clearly enjoying himself. This was what he had always wanted: Tony free from his cares, free from his worries, free from all the demons that plagued him. It wouldn't last forever, because nothing could, but Steve could take this moment and live in it for as long as it lasted.
"How the hell did you find me?" Tony asked. "The suit was disabled. I couldn't put out an active ping for assistance."
"Okay," Steve said, determined, "but I'd like to pay a little more attention to you, first." He stroked Tony's cock again, lightly, for emphasis.
All of a sudden, Steve's scheduled appearance on 20 Vision in the morning didn't sound like it was going to be all that fun. The host would want to know what he thought about this, the latest grisly development in what would probably somehow end up still being the ruin and destruction of Tony Stark.
But Tiberius' day of reckoning was coming, Steve knew. Toward the end of their talk with the police, Tony had pulled one of the detectives aside, handed her a business card, and said a few things that Steve hadn't heard in all the commotion. He didn't know what it was -- maybe Tony would tell him later -- but he knew that, whatever it was, it was going to take Tiberius down.
Tony set his half-empty mug on the coffee table, and then sat back and tapped two fingers against his sternum, where Steve knew the metal port sat.
Steve held out his hands. "He was lying, Tony. You know that. Every word out of his mouth was a lie--"
. And that wasn't happening. It was the same problem Tony had already had so many times, and here it was, happening again.
Steve was barely breathing hard; Tony hadn't really expected to get anything out of him from only this level of pain. Luckily, he was also very good with words.
Daring, he closed his hand around Tony's cock. Tony's eyes fluttered shut, and he moaned and pushed up into Steve's hand, just a little. Tony was circumcised, but other than that it felt pretty much exactly like touching himself. The familiarity was a comfort, and Tony's response was flattering. Tony seemed to like to stay fairly quiet -- he definitely wasn't as chatty as Steve was -- but he moaned and thrust into Steve's grip, and he was still smiling. It was easy to tell that he was having a good time.
"You're the farthest thing from selfish," Steve tells him, and he works one hand free of the blankets to stroke Tony's hair, the way he's never dared to before. "You're allowed to be happy."
Steve idly wondered if he was just... radiating... as he sat there. He wondered if that was bad. Tony would probably have known. He started to head past the desk to the elevators, which was when the security guard stood up.
Steve licked his lips. "No," he said, and that definitely wasn't a great start. "I can't say that. I-- I know you've made mistakes." He sure wasn't getting any better. "But I wouldn't take out a full-page newspaper ad listing your mistakes."
"I like when you hold me," Tony mumbles, his voice slurred. It's a confession Steve has never heard from him before. All Tony's walls are down. "I like it a lot. But I'm not-- not s'posed to. Not right. S'too much. I feel too much."
"Well, they couldn't get into the computers," Jan said, sounding almost cheerful despite the entire situation. "You did a great job with the network security."
. How, uh." He paused again. "I was wondering. What are your feelings about that? How do you want to play this?"
"Oh, yeah." There was a rueful sadness in Tony's voice. "He sure did. He'd known exactly how I felt about you for twenty entire years. He'd known I definitely hadn't stopped having a crush on you. And then, as you said, he figured out how you felt about me when you walked in on us. I imagine he had a lot of fun this week attempting to ruin both of us."
And then Steve ripped the chestplate all the way off and threw it to the side and, oh, shit, that was worse, that was so much worse. It had obviously been helping to seal the wound and now there was nothing there to stanch the flow.
Tony nodded. "Looks like." His mouth wavered; his head tipped down. "For what it's worth, I'm sorry it has to be like this."
Iron Man's laugh is soft. "I'll try. You go to sleep, Winghead," Iron Man says, his voice fond. "I'll still be here when you wake up. I'm not going anywhere."
"Topping you's not going to be a hardship," Tony said, as firmly as he could, and something in Steve's gaze softened. He could see Steve responding to him. Trusting him. "I have, let's just say, a fair amount of experience. And I've already seen your gear, so I also have a good idea of what you want."
Tony sure sounded like he meant it. He already knew who Steve was, and he was still here. It was the exact same thing Steve had been saying to him all night, and now Tony was saying it back.
Steve hissed several very un-Captain America words under his breath and lifted Tony's faceplate up. His fingertips roved almost tenderly over Tony's face, and then he tugged Tony's eye a little wider with one thumb, checking his pupils.
Iron Man looks down at himself and makes a soft, mechanical clicking noise, and when he speaks, his voice is choked with emotion. "Just what I've always wanted."
Steve presses the switch. He isn't quite sure what he expected to happen, but none of his expectations were adequate to the experience of watching the golden metal of Tony's sleeve suddenly sag limply, then detach from the shoulder of his armor and begin to retract into the cuff the same way that the gauntlet had. It's like a magic trick, except it's not a trick at all.
Since the comm line to Jan is still open, Steve can't object aloud, of course, so he's reduced to gestures. He hastily makes a throat-slitting motion with one finger. But it's too late.
"Nothing wrong with that," Steve said, smiling, heading back to the bed, phone in hand. "And I'd love to hear about them, but I think Jan's probably going to call me in about thirty sec--"
Steve nodded. "I like hearing you talk, though. But I'd like to see what I can do about relaxing you a little more.?"
him, too. Tony was right when he said he wasn't, in fact, getting off on this; Steve is not an innocent and he knows perfectly well what it looks like when someone would like you to move your hands a little farther south, and Tony definitely is not. But that doesn't mean that Steve isn't currently attracted to him. Tony's at ease, relaxed, fluid, languid. He's smiling, bright and undimmed. Every time Steve touches him he moans ever so quietly, and Steve likes those noises a whole lot. His body is a goddamn
Tony sat back in what he suspected was an intentionally-uncomfortable chair and watched Fury set out a row of newspapers, one by one, on the desk in front of him. Through the sides of Tony's rocks glass, the headlines were distorted, the newsprint tinted amber by two fingers of quality scotch.
At least it's not some kind of major emergency -- it's just a lot of minor ones with lousy timing. That's good. That's the only good thing about this.
recent. They couldn't have been done tonight, or even within the week; they weren't fresh enough for that. They were probably several weeks old. Whatever this was, whoever had done this, it hadn't been Tiberius.
"I couldn't get you the whole day off, but the afternoon is ours." Tony was grinning. "Jan's going to let Pepper know I got caught up in Avengers business. And the way I see it, I
Something in Steve is hot; it's like standing in sunshine. He thinks he was supposed to make Tony feel like this. He thinks there's no such thing as
Through the cracked cockpit canopy of the wrecked Quinjet, Steve can see that the snow is coming down even harder. Wonderful.
Attempting to ignore the part of his brain that was telling him it would actually be pretty nice to have someone to come home to, Tony squinted at him. "And why do you think I want to marry anyone at all?"
The ceiling is high, vaulted, and there's an elegant chandelier, and Steve feels himself relax at last, a strung wire unwinding that he hadn't known was this taut, deep within him. It's not that he wants to go back to the past, because he loves living in the future with every fiber of his being, but it's so good to know that there are still places like this, that nothing is all the way gone.
He wanted to do everything right. But if what Mr. Stark is saying is the truth, then it's the wrong time to ask. He hasn't even started and he's still doing it wrong. Is Iron Man really going to want a dinosaur like him, a man from the wrong century? What if he doesn't?
you. Because I know you must have been scared. I know you still are. And I hate to think that you've spent any of your life living in fear of what-- of what I might think of you."
"Seriously, thank you," Tony said. He glanced down at himself, aggrieved. "And here I am taking up your entire couch. Ugh. My manners. I'm sorry."
It was only after Steve said it that he realized he shouldn't have said it. Not because he was wrong -- because Tiberius had not, in fact, apologized to Tony -- but because the circumstances of how Steve knew that were personal, and definitely not something he wanted to get into on national television. He knew Tiberius hadn't apologized because Steve had been in the room when Tony had called him. And the first thing Steve had asked Tony afterwards was if Tiberius had apologized. And Tony had said no.
So off he went. It hurt to lose one of the heavyweights, but it was the only lead they had so far, and the new roster of Avengers were holding their own just fine for now.
When he took it back to the castle, the king laughed with glee to receive the firebird armor. He duly dispensed the reward he promised Steve, then immediately set another task. “Since you were clever enough to fetch the armor, you must find it’s creator, Anthony, who dwells at the edge of the kingdom in a mansion of golden light. I must have him, and only him, to furnish my armies with weapons.”
For his part, Tony was staring back at him, expression strange. If Steve didn’t know better, he might have called it appreciative, but he did know better, so he braced instead for a retort from a man offended.
Luckily in the meantime, Nat had actually launched into a spiel about secure comms and text messages, which kept everyone’s libido pretty well in check. The problem only arose when she brought up the topic of government email servers and Tony got all up in her face for daring to compare their shoddy security to his.
Steve flipped through it skeptically, but lo and behold, there was indeed an article by the person Clint mentioned. Amanda Huggenkiss, hilarious. And to top it all off, it was a critic’s review for a movie about⸺ Steve checked the title twice⸺ mobile phone emojis. Incredible.
Steve swallowed. “Yeah, um, Stark Expo 2016. You were watching a demo and it was the first time I’d seen you look so..I don’t know, open. I mean, you’re usually watching out for cameras or the paparazzi, but not here and I couldn’t help it, I…um.”
“Wakanda remains opposed to our vision for the world and does not trade with us,” Schmidt growled in frustration. He eyed those present and grinned upon spotting Steve.
“I was scared,” he confesses, just loud enough for Tony to hear him over the shower. “I thought I was ok with the way things are between us, but when the Celestial landed and I realized I didn’t know where you were, I couldn’t think. About anything except for what happened last time an alien landed and we weren’t together.”
Steve caught sight of his forced smile and deflated. “About that,” he ventured. “Tony, can we talk? I’ve been an ass this week, and I’m sorry, but believe it or not, I thought I was doing the right thing.”
Tony scoffs. “I’m sorry, do we or do we not have a team on every continent? Are you seriously telling me Wilson or T’challa or Danvers couldn’t find you something to do?”
Steve bolts out of the hovering Quinjet, barely noticing the 15 foot drop, and his heart nearly stops when he sees the smoking crater blown in one of the higher floors of the building before him. It’s an office space still under construction and in any case, civilians have been cleared out of it hours ago, however…
Once that’s established, Tony works quickly, before he can rethink. He makes short work of his gun holster, belt, and the director’s uniform itself. He throws it into a pile with Steve’s stupid gown and steps into the shower.
"The lord is getting impatient,” Steve said weeks later, as they lay wrapped around each other. Anthony’s larger limbs smothered him in customary warmth and affection, but Steve was tight with worry. “Something will happen, I can feel it.”
His hands shake when he approaches the ARC reactor. The clear, cyan glow ignites a surge of protective anger in his chest, the likes of which Steve has felt only a handful of times in his life. He can deal with general villainy all day, but for someone to have the audacity to reach for his family–
Even after pulling rank, affiliation, and feigning hanger to slip out of the ensuing battle over jurisdiction of the Thumb, Steve still only managed to get home at around three in the morning. The fact that he was already in civvies saved him a trip to the armory, but he did run into Tony as he made his way to the suite elevators.
He should go to Australia, Steve mused, travel for something other than work. He felt himself smile as he pictured leaving the shield to Sam, and foisting Wanda and Vision on Natasha, while Fury and Hill howled in protest at Captain America trading in his uniform for board shorts and a Hawaiian shirt. He’d book a flight with a decent civilian airline and dream about crystal clear waters and beachy sunsets while his Avengelings’ waved their handkerchiefs in farewell.
“Come on, man, don’t mope,” Sam nudged at Steve’s calf with his foot underwater. “We’re just wondering, as friends do, why you haven’t told Stark how you feel. He’s single, you’re single; and now that you guys aren’t measuring dicks anymore, it can’t hurt to go out on a date or two.”
Steve slips out of his shoes and socks and slides into the vacant spot as lightly as he can manage. The sheets are cool under his back and the natural white noise of the countryside is more pleasant than either the noise of the city or the airtight calm of soundproofed rooms. Still, it turns out getting in bed is the easy part, and sleep is far more elusive. It doesn’t take long for his terribly unsubtle tossing and turning to wake his bunkmate.
Steve shouldn’t be as surprised as he is. He remembers Clint watching him and Tony by the woodpile today. He knows he hadn’t exactly kept it together.
“Trust me,” Anthony insisted. He pressed his forehead to Steve’s, breath hot on his lips. “Trust me."
“Don’t,” Tony interrupts, features curling into familiar lines of vexation. “...don’t say it gets better.”
Steve watched as the Thumb seated himself at a barstool in front of the TV, and sighed fondly to himself, because yeah, Peggy believed in giving people a choice, even if she ended up with the short straw sometimes.
Steve considered. Outwardly, it did look like the Avengers tagged along with SHIELD. Their status was pretty ambiguous internally as well, which meant SHIELD would try to make decisions on their behalf and Tony was right to be concerned about that.
Anthony immediately let him into his house of wonders. Steve noticed all manner of curiosities crowding the rooms— ever-moving sculptures, half-formed constructions, mechanical creatures that moved by themselves, and those powered by blue light, very much like the armor.
“What magic is this?” Schmidt demanded. “If this poison can so transform the weak little squire, then I too shall consume it.” Thus, he partook of the blue vial, but that which magnified a good man like Steve, corrupted the king until he was consumed by his own wickedness. Schmidt died at once, his body becoming red and withered like an old corpse.
“Yeah yeah,” Tony muttered, albeit indulgently, and tapped Steve’s shoulder on his way out. “Stay weird, old man.”
Fine. He’ll wear it, Steve decided, but he wasn’t going to like it, even if nobody seemed particularly concerned about his opinion anyway. As Steve fumbled with his zipper behind the scant privacy screen, producers, technicians, and PA’s scurried about the studio in a chaotically organized
Steve raised a brow, and mimicked Bruce’s tentative wave. So this was Daryl. When Thor first mentioned a flat and roommate in Australia, of all places, Steve admittedly hadn’t given it much more thought than he did stories about wild bilgesnipes or the Ginnungagap, but now, well, it was nice to put a face to the email address from which he’d been receiving irregular and rambling updates about Thor’s life down under.
“Oh jeez, still?” Steve asked in a voice that might have been called a whine if someone who was not him were describing it.
When Wednesday morning rolled around, Steve didn’t see hair nor hide of Tony. He ate breakfast alone and went to debrief with Phil only to find out that Tony had emailed his update instead of attending. Three texts went unanswered, and when he asked FRIDAY to make a call, the AI informed him that her boss was on lockdown in his lab and that a huge chunk of Steve’s own day was blocked off for an outreach engagement.
Steve pushes off and and starts walking towards the table. For a moment, he can see the growing intrigue in Tony’s expression, how he shifts subtly like he expects the seat beside him to be filled. However, Steve merely reaches over him to gather up the dirty dishes. He’d eaten his dinner standing up, as if he were refueling between missions instead of being treated to hospitality. The best he can do now is clean up.
Steve’s glad it’s dark and nobody can see him shiver. He knows they’re all compromised in one way or another, but this complicates things in ways that are beyond his competence to address. Not for the first time, he wishes Sam were here because when Steve opens his mouth, what comes out is not reassurance exactly.
Of course, the only problem was that he’d be leaving Tony behind, too. Steve’s brow wrinkled at the thought of Tony rattling around in Stark Tower by himself. Who’d bring him snacks in the lab and treats for his bots? Butterfingers especially was growing fond of getting bits of arcane, analog tech whenever Steve visited...
Their phones and identicards had gone off at the same time, which meant serious trouble, so while Steve reached for his tablet, Tony was already watching the video feed.
Nevertheless, life went on and villainy persisted. The rest of the team trickled in slowly, each of them orbiting closer and closer to the Tower until one fine day, the Avengers once again manifested like destiny.
Tony took a deep breath, like a drowning man taking his first gulp of air. He scrubbed his face again and said, “Good. Good, ‘cause I was...not taking that well.”
Steve laughed softly and triumphantly waved his wallet. Tony made an ironic gesture of applause. “Great job, detective Capslock. Guess life goes back to normal now.”
As he listened to Bruce talk, Steve thought about how, for all that he knew about the longevities and loyalties of friendship, he’d underestimated the virtues of plain old peace of mind.
“Shouldn’t be alone, either,” Steve finishes. Tony can see his jaw set, his hands dig just a fraction more into the bed like he expects to be thrown out any minute. “I came because I wanted one of us to be at your side, Tony. We may not be the Avengers anymore, but it doesn’t mean we’re not a team.”
Steve went straight back to the Tower and parked his motorbike in the expansive garage. “Is Tony out yet?” he asked hopefully.
Steve snapped his eyes open at the wry tenor, instantaneously flipping the Starkpad over. He found himself face to face with Tony, much like a deer in headlights. It was not a good look on him, and Tony’s brow rose in predictable confusion.
“Ok…” Sam grabbed the last Boston creme from the box and licked it to protect it from Natasha. “Hey, do you still carry that picture of Stark around with you?”
Steve must have looked pretty eager, because Bruce was quick to deny it. “Theoretically,” he said. “There is currently no feasible way to actually time travel.”
Throat tight, Steve watched his brown eyes struggle to remain open, then finally close in deep slumber. When he pulled them from his bag, the adamantium chains he bought alongside the wine glinted silver and cold in the hearthlight.
In that moment, Steve stopped hesitating and went to have a serious conversation with Tony. Transparency, he insisted, and accountability: they’ve got to be fundamental; the Avengers couldn’t be like the institutions that failed them.
“Because I’m an idiot!” Steve declared, rolling his eyes. “I’ve been mooning over a picture when I should have been listening to the real deal.”
Tony grins, or rather, he does a grotesque impression of one. “Love it when you go full Cap, babe, but real quick…”
Steve raised his brow, taken mildly aback. “No,” he replied softly. “It’s nothing like that, Tony, I meant it’s sentimental.”
“No, I’m sure it was an accident,” said Steve. He turned back to Butterfingers and looked into the blinking panel that he thought of as its eye. “I didn’t bring you anything when I was here to discuss upgrades last week, so you thought my wallet was a treat, right?”
For a hopeful moment, his comm crackles to life. Instead of Tony quick and assuring voice, it’s JARVIS who answers. “Two agents of SHIELD are located on the eighth floor and two more on the ninth floor, Captain. I have already asked for emergency evacuation.”
Whatever Wanda Maximoff did to his head leaves him feeling like a ghost, trapped between present circumstances and a dream of the past.
“This began with me wanting the king’s favor. I no longer care for more things,” Steve kissed Anthony’s arm wound about his neck. “I only want to protect those I love.”
“Uh, right,” Steve nods, and notices the silence. It’s not total— he can pick up footsteps on the floor above, and voices coming from the den, but they’re all muted in polite observance of an unspoken curfew. Even after a day of battle, of seeing strange visions, and watching cities get crushed, the silence reminds him that this is still somebody’s home and homes followed their own timetables.
As leader, Steve’s own role is to punch through the roadblocks. Even if Wanda and Pietro were a problem he could solve, he doesn’t know what to do with the damage already done. As if he senses he’s being watched, Tony looks up, eyes flicking at once to where Steve is leaning against the threshold to the kitchen.
By dawn, the story shifted. Eyes red from too little sleep and too many tears, Steve let the chains hang limply from his fingers as he waited for Anthony to wake.
“You’re so beautiful,” Anthony said, his thumb ghosting across Steve’s cheek. “Why do you look so sad?”
“No,” Steve replied abruptly, then more calmly. “No assembling; we keep this between us. Need-to-know only.”
“I showed up for the weekly,” Tony replied. “but the conference room was empty and FRIDAY mentioned you all were here.” He smirked at Steve. “Forget how to update the calendar, Captain, or is this not that meeting?”
Captain America didn’t panic. Serum-enhanced national treasures usually didn’t, and good for them because Steve Rogers
He thumbed tensely through the video feed on his Starkpad. A panoramic view of every common area in the Tower was right there at his fingertips, and some not-so-common areas were just a passcode away. In addition, he had access to satellite feeds and other methods of surveillance that walked a thin line Constitution-wise, but none of them really solved his problem.
Schmidt agreed and summoned his soldiers. Steven felt his heart break, but he did not falter. His own life meant nothing in the face of doing what was right, yet, even as the king’s soldiers forced him to his knees and held his jaw open, Steven sought Anthony’s eyes for the last time. They were not as pitiless as they were moments ago; Anthony still looked upon him with sadness and love. He tipped the vial into Steven’s mouth, saying without speaking,
He was smiley enough, but seemed more subdued than before. Steve nearly offered to cancel his plans when Tony looked up again.
Anthony, who came to from a dark and dreamless sleep, was surprised to find himself still at home. He noted how wretched his guest looked. Steve was hardly of age, small and emaciated, yet a better man than most if he had the creator of the firebird armor at his mercy and did nothing.
“Guys, good talking to you, but I have to go,” he told the webcam. Then, Steve smiled kindly at Daryl, “And about the Asgardian gold...contact your local SHIELD office, son.”
Steve looked up and met warm, brown eyes that shone just as hopefully as his own. “We did,” he agreed. “We did, and I can’t wait to see how much further we can go, but…well, you should also know that I don’t carry your photo ‘round cause I admire you.”
Tony had readily agreed, and as ever, he took it a step further, negotiating room for the future⸺systems to keep an eye out for more enhanced persons, proving grounds, and a dedicated home for what he called the world-saving sciences. Of course, he put this much thought into it. Steve wasn’t surprised, but he was strangely warmed at the notion of working with Tony, of being in step with Tony.
Unable to tolerate anymore, Steve refused, saying, “No, I won’t steal from a peaceful nation to power your machines of war.”
“The kingdom of Wakanda possesses a store of it so large that its people sew it into their clothes and build it into their homes,” Anthony said.
“Come on, Cap,” Natasha tugs on his arm and Steve allows himself to be led out of the wreckage. He doesn’t even realize he’s crying until he goes to wipe blood off his face, but there’s no red.
“It was certainly something,” he said with a rueful smile. “I mean, don’t get me wrong, I love the action. And Sharon, she’s...well, she and I happen to be very good at action.
This is the statement Captain America makes to the world, flanked by Captain Marvel and Rhodey in the War Machine suit. It’s a good statement, bold and brave, and Tony is as inspired as anyone. He’d always quietly envied Steve Rogers' ability to make people find the best in themselves, but Sam has a way of reaching the exhausted, at encouraging the most depleted, downtrodden person on Earth to find a grain more of their strength and keep going.
“Analog stuff; not quite up your alley,” Steve gave what he hoped was an easy grin, and stretched in his chair to relieve the jitters. God help his team if their lives ever depended on him keeping a secret under direct pressure from Tony.
Steve examines the red and gold sheath, identifying what might be dead weight. He asks JARVIS if some extra paneling is safe to take off, so Tony might feel a little lighter…
“If you do not take me to your king,” Anthony pointed out. "your family will be forfeit. I know Schmidt’s ways.”
Steve spared one eye to the latest proposal to upgrade his shield, and kept the other on Tony. He was laid out over the length of Steve’s couch--one of those microfiber numbers that didn’t look comfortable to sit on, but was good for a power nap or two. His dark tanktop was wrinkled and his hands were grease-stained as he scratched thoughtfully at his beard.
However, Anthony would not hear of it. He spoke to Steve affectionately, saying, “Your courage is one of a kind, Steve, and the hours you have spent in my company have filled me with love for you. So, take me to your king. I will secure your freedom.”
While he suffered in silence, Natasha reached around Steve’s elbow and took the last donut. Behind her, the Iron Man stared back in impassive judgement.
It took a special kind of writer to create a teleprompter spread equating the super soldier experiment to puberty. Steve was impressed, learned a few new things, and yet he still left the studio in polite haste because there were whispers about USCIS wanting in on the PSA action, and he was in no mood to stand before a backdrop of the Statue of Liberty and talk about being an ‘immigrant of time’.
Steve mumbled a disappointed thanks and took the elevator up to the communal floor. As he zoomed up to the topmost floors of the Tower, he wondered if he’d missed something during their conversation last night. Steve had never asked Tony about his evening; he’d been too caught up in the idea of them settling the future of the Avengers together. The thought made him smile even now, but he couldn’t imagine why Tony would go into lockdown all of a sudden.
The monotony doesn’t make his annoyance go away, but it helps. Steve feels his shoulders relax as water sluices over the last plate, and the beige amalgam of gravy and soap give way to smooth white porcelain. Shaking excess water off, he transfers it to the drying rack to join the rest of the dishes, similarly clean and lined up like soldiers.
They stared at each other for a bit, obviously trying to extrapolate where the evening might have taken them. Tony was dressed in expensive business casual⸺ dark jacket and slacks accented with certain pastels he seemed to favor these days. Steve, on the other hand, felt self-conscious in sweat-stained sports bar get-up and messy hair. The skirmish with the Thumb had also left him with bruises, which were still healing in pink splotches across his jaw and neck.
“He wants to experience Earth,” Steve replied, swiveling back and forth on his office chair because Tony’s mood was catching. “What so bad about that? He’s not living in the trenches.”
Steve stalled behind a long sip of his sangria. It was a good drink even if it wouldn’t get him buzzed, but it didn’t have a magic answer to Sam’s question, either.
“Multiple major safety hazards on this floor,” JARVIS says. “Injuries are extensive and significant. Please hurry, Captain.”
“That is my battle to fight,” Steve replied. “You, who captures the sun to shine at night, you do not deserve to create things that kill for Schmidt.”
Behind Bruce, Thor rolled into the frame on a razor scooter, followed by a doughy, defeated-looking man holding a small golden urn. Thor beamed when he caught sight of Steve.
Tony stared back at him, possibly for the first time, speechless. “Well, shit,” he managed to sigh. “How did we miss that?”
“It is your cash, then,” Thor guessed. “Worry not, if you require rent money, I shall send you some.” He upended Daryl’s urn so bright golden coins spilled across the desk. “Asgardian gold; each of these is worth a gazillion of your human dollars.”
The next morning, when his wallet was officially missing for 12 hours, Steve commandeered the Avengers weekly standup to enlist some help. It was perfect cover since Hawkeye and Bruce weren’t phoning in; there was no weird raven reporting on Thor’s behalf, and most importantly, no indication that Iron Man was going to break his perfect record of never attending a single one of these. Hiding in plain sight
And that’s the thing about Steve: he may be a terrible casual liar, but he was made to get out of potentially ruinous situations that might threaten the very structure of the team.
At 11 o’clock, Steve found himself struggling into his old uniform, which he he was sad to discover had not been mercilessly burnt months ago. It made him look like a cartoon, but the production team deemed it ‘child-and-adolescent-friendly’; not like his current uniform, which was just proficiently hostile, Captain Rogers, we’re talking to kids, not terrorists.
Steve made a frustrated noise of his own, not because he was particularly invested in the exchange rate between US Dollars and Asgardian space gold, but because his woes had nothing to do with money.
Steve sunk a fraction deeper into the jacuzzi so the warm, foaming water lapped at his throat. “Kind of.”
Though Steve would not ask him to risk the journey to the edge of the kingdom, Sam still offered his help. He advised Steve to ask the king for a strong horse, two bottles of Asgardian wine, and a special gift from the forges. Taking these, Steve journeyed to the edge of the kingdom where the creator of the marvelous armor lived.
It’s likely just meant to be one of Tony’s off-hand jokes, but Steve winces anyway. He remembers the disquiet on Tony’s face when he ripped that log apart with his bare hands; it’s not his proudest moment. Sure, he’d been jumpy and unmoored, but that wasn’t anyone’s problem but his own.
“Mr. Stark is on the tenth floor,” JARVIS says. The terse reply makes Steve more anxious, because he’s never had to drag good news out of Tony’s AI.
That...was a fair point, but nobody ever said Captain America never came prepared. “What if the situation compromises the Avengers?”
“Praying for it to turn up?” Steve sniffled lightly, and wiggled his fingers inside stiff, scarlet gloves.
“You took troubled, my friend,” Thor stated. “Your lips are drawn, and your face, pinched like a squalling babe. Is there something amiss in New York?”
Steve must look exactly as pained as he feels because Tony immediately winces. “S’ry, that was offensive.”
Tony seems to relax at that, very minutely. Agonizingly enough, Steve notes how careful he is not to lean on the very rods lancing through his flesh. He works quickly and carefully to clear bits of rubble from the cracks in the suit.
Tony needs some of that, especially after the night he's had. Twenty-one days into their current catastrophe, Thor had paid him a visit to talk about it and the whole thing was far from encouraging. If anything, it felt horribly like deja vu.
Sam wiggled his toes and squinted at the sun from behind his sunglasses. “More missing persons?” he asked. “This guy got a metal arm and an attitude, too?”
Stepping out of the elevator, Steve scratched nervously at the back of his neck. The living room was empty, but bright with natural light, and immaculate from a recent visit by the maintenance staff. Couch cushions were rearranged tastefully, coasters replaced in their holder, and on the coffee table was a neatly folded copy of the Times.
Steve heard the king and was consumed with dread. He wept bitterly, feeling betrayed, but Sam stood by him. “I told you not to take the mask,” he said. “But do not give way to fear, Steve, or the worst will be yet to come. I shall help you fulfill your task.”
He makes a surprised noise when Steve draws him in. His body goes rigid, but he doesn’t pull away, not even when Steve rubs circles into his back and rests his chin on dark hair that’s gone curly.
In a kingdom far away, there lived a king who was obsessed with power and would do anything to obtain it. The king had a squire, who was small and sickly, but always strove to be good. The good squire had a dear friend with whom he would spend time hunting or training. One day, the two friends were walking upon a path in the woods when they stumbled upon a mask half buried in the dirt.
“I did,” Steve answered immediately, unable to help the proud uptilt in his voice. “Daryl buys a few more lottery tickets than he really should, but no signs that he’s a HYDRA sleeper.”
This time, Tony also rolls on to his side. He’s curled in on himself, so tight that Steve can’t imagine he’d been sleeping just moments ago. His eyes are wide and bright in the velvet darkness. “You said we’d win together or lose together,” Tony says. “But what if we don’t? I was shown the future, Steve, you were all dead. And it was my fault. Where’s
Steve figured the metaphor had gone too far at this point. Thor just shrugged. “We are immortal,” he said. “The pain of…disagreeable ham smarts a long time. Perhaps, it is best to wait for it to cure some more.”
“You’re gaga over a ham?” he asked in a tone which made Steve suspect he was quite over the myth of superheroes.
Steve hardly cares. “I’ll be more offended if you don’t save your strength,” he says. “Please, Tony, I need you to stay with me. Help’s on the way.”
On a nearby folding chair with his codename emblazoned on it, Hawkeye lay back, sipping cucumber water through a crazy straw. He turned and peeked over his shades when Steve came out.
In the end, a new era dawned upon the kingdom. Steve got what he wanted: the safety of his village and the capacity to protect all he loved. He used his newfound power to root out the remnants of Schmidt’s network in the kingdom, and rebuild bridges to other nations. Anthony took back the armor stolen from him, and returned to his mansion of wonders, but not for long.
“Don’t worry ‘bout that,” Tony rasps. Instead, he lifts the arm that’s not impaled at the shoulder. “This.”
The colossal entity was responsible, of course, and it was only because of knowledge gained during the course of their previous fight with Thanos that they managed to identify it as a Celestial. Tony remembers being grimly glad that he’d insisted on chronicling everything as he floated through space all those years ago. Unfortunately, that knowledge wasn't enough. Nobody knew how to stop a Celestial.
"Well, then you should know that I owe you an apology." Mr. Stark sighs. "I wasn't very kind to you, the last time we talked. And I don't want you to think that I'm not happy for you and Iron Man, because I am. As far as I'm concerned, the two of you deserve every happiness in the world, and I am deeply sorry if I ever made you think otherwise."
His shield-roughened hands aren't catching on Tony's skin, so he must be doing this right. And when he judges that Tony's back is soft enough with oil, he begins, lightly at first, with his hands still in the dip of Tony's lower back. Under his hands Tony is warmer right here than he should be. Tension. Pain. Inflammation. Steve hasn't woken up with a backache since 1940, but he knows what it used to feel like. He rubs little circles there, gently.
-- and there's an embarrassingly primal part of him that likes watching Tony have to work a little to take him, because that's just how big Steve is. Makes him feel even bigger. It's a damn good sight, too, good and getting even better, the way Tony's mouth stretches around his cock, lips quivering as he has to work for it, as he takes every inch. Steve's always liked a nice visual. And Tony, his Tony -- well, Tony makes the prettiest picture he's ever seen, trussed-up and desperate to make Steve come, to be good for him. Even while his mouth is on Steve, Tony's still frantic with need, unceasingly eager for it, wanting everything Steve's got.
Steve shakes his head, bumping against the metal on Tony's palms. He looks up. Tony's looking back down at him, his face half-shadowed by the raised faceplate. Tony's smile is still a little wobbly and he's blinking back tears but he's
"Well, uh," Iron Man says, sheepish. "Other than your basic social handshakes and, uh, kissing you... a couple of years."
"But nothing," Steve says, with a determined glint in his eye that Tony suspects he'll be seeing a lot of. "Do you need me to kiss you right now to prove it?"
Tiberius' mouth opened and shut. His cleverness seemed to be decreasing by the second; his arguments were gone, and he was reduced to raw, impotent emotion. "Do you know what you did to me? Do you understand," he spat, viciously, "how much I
A cloud of dejection passed over Tony's face. It had been two weeks since Rumiko. They had been off-and-on for a while, and they were definitely off right now. Tony seemed to be taking this latest breakup particularly hard, and Steve thought maybe this time it was going to be permanent.
Steve pulled his cowl up, slung his shield on his back, and grabbed the keys to his bike from the top of the dresser.
Tony nuzzles his cheek. "Do I look like I'm being coerced?" he asks. "I like when I can be good to you. I like when I'm... what you need."
But it's not that he wants to know who Iron Man is. And it's not like he'd recognize Iron Man if Iron Man took off the helmet. He just wants... to see his face. To see his smile. To see more of him than just his eyes. To touch him, skin to skin.
So Steve skipped past the unnecessary defenses and denials. That wasn't what was called for. It wasn't about him. Not like that.
Steve sat down on the edge of the bed, turning to face Tony. "It's okay," he said. "You're scared and you're tired. I understand. I just was under the impression that you didn't want anyone looking. And I don't want to do something you don't want me to do." That was worth spelling out, the way the rest of the night's conversation had gone.
"I don't think so." Tony looked contemplative. "This has gone on a lot longer than any of the other dream sequences. And you've said a lot of things that sound like the real you. Even some things I didn't know. But I can't be sure I'm not dreaming it all up. I can't
, then?" he asked, quoting Steve's words back to him. His voice lilted, curious. "Tell me, what's the story here? How do you think he's hurting me if I don't think I'm being hurt? Because, from where I'm standing, that doesn't make a whole lot of sense."
way, so he'd have ropes to struggle against a little -- and they never got a chance to get him all the way relaxed, did they? Steve's pretty damn sure that Tony's no longer in the mood. So that opportunity to loosen Tony up -- both in the physical and the mental sense -- is gone. And now Tony is even more tense from the fight. Sure, Tony didn't do any of the punching himself, but that doesn't mean he's not still keyed up from, essentially, defusing a hostage situation. With Steve as the hostage. Of course Tony's still a wreck. And just holding him clearly isn't going to do enough this time.
Tony raised his head just far enough that Steve could see his eyes, too pale, his face dotted with broken capillaries. Oh, geez. He was a mess, wasn't he? But he seemed to want to be Steve's mess, and Steve was more than happy to take him. He'd always been. If Tony was only offering friendship, he'd take that. The idea was getting easier to accept.
"Aye," Thor agreed. "He is a fearsome sorcerer, possessed of great magic, which he uses to a dire purpose."
"Please," Steve pleaded. He'd thrown his head back; his muscles were quivering, taut. "Please, Tony, it's so good, the plug's so heavy, it all hurts, I can't, I can't, please."
When he speaks, Iron Man's voice is tense. It's clearly a touchy subject. "Let's just say that, even if I stopped working for him, I'd still have enough money to get by, okay?" He huffs out a hissing breath. "I appreciate that you care. I really do. But I'm... solvent. Honest."
"When you said you'd seen everything in the box," Steve said, faintly, "you weren't kidding." He sounded excited, but at the same time on the edge of being overwhelmed. It reminded Tony of how he'd been when they'd found him in the ice all those years ago.
Mr. Stark laughs, an amused little huff of air, as if he can't believe that Steve is so nervous about wanting to know something he obviously thinks is so inconsequential. "Is that all you want? Is that what all this fuss is about? Breathe, Cap." He smiles. "Sure. I mean, yeah, of course I can get you his measurements. What for? You looking to buy ol' Shellhead a nice sweater for Christmas?"
And then everything snapped back to reality, because Carol was hugging him. Hard. When was the last time he'd hugged anyone? It had been Tony, hadn't it? Last week, back when he'd thought his only problem was jealousy. And maybe that was his only problem again, now that Tony was out of his life. Tony's problems weren't his. Tony had made that perfectly clear.
"I know your reputation is very important to you," Steve began. "I know you're not out, and I know why you're not out, and I understand what's at stake. I'd never ask you to do anything you're not completely comfortable with--"
He flings his shield in the air, hears it collide with the Black Knight, and doesn't bother looking up. He just holds out his hand to catch it on the rebound and kneels next to Iron Man as he slings the shield onto his back, his fingers reflexively intertwining with the unyielding metal of Iron Man's gauntlet.
Steve obligingly lifted his hips to help as Tony slid the last thing he was wearing off him, leaving him bare to Tony's gaze. He felt oddly vulnerable, naked when Tony was still entirely clothed, but it wasn't a bad feeling. Far from it. Tony was here and Tony wasn't going to hurt him; it was like he could somehow trust Tony with even more of himself. He liked being able to do that.
"Well, yeah." Tony scowled and didn't let him finish the sentence. "You've never been all that fussed about me changing in front of you before. And as far as I can tell, there's only the one thing now that's new. It's an easy conclusion to draw."
Tony nodded slowly. "I'm willing to try, though. The idea sounds plausible to me. And I can't see why the rules would be different for DreamVision."
He could admit to himself that it was all about Tony. It was. It had always been. He would have been lying to himself to pretend otherwise.
Mr. Stark grimaces, and Steve doesn't understand why. "No," he says, more quietly. "No, it... wasn't possible."
It took Tony several tries to figure out a good rhythm, his head bobbing, letting just the tip of Steve's cock slide in and out of his slick, red mouth while Steve was reduced to even further obscenities, because Tony's lips felt so very, very good.
That would have been the only way Tony might have accepted that he was getting hurt. He sure wasn't going to accept this.
work with all that." He didn't mean to second-guess Steve, but-- "You're sure that's a yes on the bondage? You
If there were any way to scratch him from the mission, Steve would. As it is, he's hoping he can get Tony to stand back, stay out of the way, and let him take the hits. Steve's still not exactly sure how he, personally, can defeat Ghost. Steve's never fought him before. Mostly he fights people he can just punch, and a fella with a high-tech costume that makes him invisible and intangible is more or less the definition of somebody Steve can't just punch. But he'll come up with a plan. He has to.
It was all details, anyway. Tiberius' mentor seemed as close to a reliable source as anyone could have hoped for. It had to be right. And, at any rate, like Tony had said, it was all going to be over. So the details didn't matter anymore.
"Yeah." A dark, tension-filled undercurrent ripples through Mr. Stark's voice, a warning, but his eyes are terrifyingly blank, like the inside of his head is a thousand miles away. This isn't good. This isn't nice. They don't even
For a few seconds, Tony was silent, his gaze passing over Steve's whole body, his brow furrowed in an expression of intense scrutiny, though Steve had no idea what Tony was looking for. Then Tony grinned and said, "Actually, I think you're still at least fifty percent Captain America right now."
He knew it pretty well right now, actually. Christ, now which of them was comparing being queer to addiction, huh? That wasn't quite the same, though. Steve didn't regret being queer. He just regretted that he couldn't stop loving a man who he knew didn't want him.
Tony couldn't even come up with the one blindingly obvious reason why a man might want to read a book about two men in love. It just wasn't occurring to him. He didn't think that Steve could ever, ever be queer.
"Before I," Iron Man begins, and then he gestures at his chest with his free hand. "Before-- before everything, not a lot of people ever really wanted to spend the whole night with me. They got what they wanted and they left. And after -- there's been no one. You're the only one. I know it's... less than you wanted from me, but I'm grateful. I really liked it. So thank you."
The only reason Tony doesn't punch him in the shoulder as payback for that bit of wordplay is that Steve is currently wearing pauldrons, golden metal covering his shoulders all the way up to his neck. For obvious professional reasons, Tony's pretty good at identifying the parts of a suit of armor. The pauldrons are definitely doing excellent things for Steve's already-impressive silhouette, accenting the breadth of his powerful shoulders. He definitely looks like someone Tony would very much like to fuck him right here on this table.
There was a catch of breath, almost imperceptible, from Steve. "Is it weird if I tell you that this is really working for me?" Steve asked, in a small voice, and he was tomato-red now.
for his parents' death. Ty resents me. He's resented me for years. He holds me responsible. And everything he's been doing, I guess, is getting revenge. The news stories. Radioactive Man. Getting... close... to me, so he could hurt me even more. So he could manipulate me. So I'd trust him and he'd ruin my life the way my father had ruined his father's life. It makes sense. It makes so much sense. I've been so blind, all these years. And I'm so very sorry for not believing you. I owe you so many apologies."
"Good?" Tony asked, because he was, as ever, hungry for Steve's praise, and he didn't mind fishing for Steve's compliments.
"Of course I do." Steve gritted his teeth. He knew he wasn't smiling anymore. He knew that wasn't going to play well. "But I also know that there's a difference between what's legally permitted and what's morally right. You have a constitutional right to broadcast the news and opinions that you've broadcasted." He hated to say it, but it was true. "There's no law against making the statements you've made. I'll admit that. But ethically, morally -- your actions are in the wrong. They constitute a pattern of harassment. This very station accused Tony of the murder of Whiplash. Your own newspaper called on the Avengers' government liaison to pressure the Avengers to force Tony's bodyguard Iron Man off the team. And Ms. Walders here just accused Iron Man of causing an explosion that killed five people." Steve hissed through his teeth. "You started it, Mr. Stone. And you've been more than happy to continue it. You're ripping him apart. And we both know you're doing it deliberately. This isn't a coincidence."
"No, no, no!" Steve shakes his head. "Don't even think that. For one thing, what you have, you earned. I didn't exactly have to work hard to look like this. And for another, well, you're real handsome."
He was sure that people could in fact own riding crops for non-perverted purposes. Hell, maybe it even really was Dane's.
"That's so nice," Steve breathed. Tony glanced away from the sight of his fingers in Steve's ass, to check Steve's expression. Steve was smiling dazedly into the pillow.
Tony's smile was dark and dangerous, promising pleasure that made Steve hot all over with just the thought of it. "Oh, but I want to do so much with you," he murmured.
Tiberius was still squinting at Steve. "Have we met?" he asked, frowning, like he was trying to place Steve's face in his memory and hadn't quite made it. "I don't remember you from the party."
"I'll figure it out." Steve's throat is tight. "If he says yes, everything else is just details. We'll find a way. I'm sure of it. The important part is whether he says yes. That's what matters. That's the only thing that matters."
"Come on," Tony said, hooking a finger into Steve's shirt and wishing, for more than the sake of mere convenience, that Steve had come with a collar and leash. "Let's go play with every toy in the box."
He figures it'll be easy for Mr. Stark -- rich, brilliant, and handsome. He's got it all. He'll be able to find the right person in no time.
Steve turned away to put the pegs down, to make a space for Tony behind him. "It'll be our secret," he said, and he was glad Tony couldn't see his face.
"I know I don't have any right to ask this of you after what I've done," Steve continued, and God, was he crying? A tear glistened on his cheek. Oh, God, he was. This was all Tony's fault. How could Steve blame himself? "But I hope-- I hope you can-- no, that's selfish. I'm just too damn selfish. That's the problem."
Steve, brilliant tactician that he is, gets the message, and immediately rips Tony's shirt open. Tony's tie slithers off his shoulders and hits the table. Most of the buttons work free. One pops off. Tony can't really bring himself to care about that as Steve pushes the shirt off his shoulders and Tony pulls his arms free. Steve shoves a chair out of the way, backs Tony up against the table, and lifts him up, setting him down on the polished surface. Definitely also hot.
Steve frowned. "Yes, you did." It had sounded like absolute hell. He definitely wasn't going to forget Tony's description of it anytime soon.
Bitterness wells up in Steve's throat. Ghost wants to hurt Tony. And he is. He already is. He just doesn't know he is.
. Oh, there's nothing wrong with modern movies. He's enjoying modern movies. He just thinks that, when it comes to theaters, the future doesn't know what it's missing out on.
He wasn't sure the words made sense, but Tony nodded like he understood what Steve meant, and he squeezed Steve's fingers again before letting his hand fall away. Awkwardly, Steve removed his hand from Tony's shoulder. He wished Tony were still touching him. He couldn't ask for that.
By the time they get everything sorted out with the fire department, it's almost dinnertime, and Iron Man suggests they go back home and -- so he says --
Tony's gaze followed Steve's, alighting on the book. "I think I'm okay," he said with a smile. There was a thoughtful pause. "What's it about?"
Steve fucks him with two fingers, a little rougher than he usually is, but, God, it's all so good. Tony is open, slick and wide-open, aching for more. The breath jolts out of his lungs every time Steve's fingers thrust in. The stretch is perfect. The heat is glorious.
"Maybe," Steve admitted. "Doesn't mean I want to stop, though." He didn't want Tony to get the wrong idea. It had just been a little too much all at once. "I'm game for more."
"God," Tony says, softly. He's shaking his head, but in disbelief. "Can you believe that didn't even occur to me? What kind of a genius am I?"
Something's still wrong, though. Mr. Stark is, it is now obvious, only pretending to read the news on his tablet. He keeps swiping up and down the same article like he's not actually taking in any of it no matter how much he tries.
If he's making a fool of himself -- well, there are worse things to be than a fool for love. But he doesn't think he's wrong. He knows Tony.
Confusion rapidly spreads over Steve's face as he pats his hands over his chest, figures out he's sitting here in his underwear, and then looks wildly around the rest of the room. The window on the far side of the room has the blinds shut, but the lights of nighttime Manhattan glimmer through the slats.
Tony's lips were pursed, his gaze just a little out of focus. Steve knew how Tony looked when he was coming up with a plan, and he looked like he had a hell of one now.
Tony took a slow step forward. Somehow, his eyes had gone frighteningly dull. "The news wasn't saying anything I didn't deserve. They weren't saying anything I've never heard before." He tipped his head to the side and smiled a small, rueful smile. Now his gaze was laced with pain. Steve wanted to tell him he was wrong, but he hadn't the faintest idea how to do it without hurting him more. "You know as well as I do that nearly everything they dug up about me was true. If I hadn't made so many mistakes in my life, there wouldn't be all those scandals attached to my name." He smiled again, even more sadly. "How exactly is it that you would like me to defend myself from the truth?"
It had been a light blow, but Steve shuddered and moaned, arching into it, his body already begging for more; from what Tony could see of his face, he was smiling. The plug glinted and bobbed where it protruded from his ass, and Tony didn't know what it said about him that he was getting off on Steve getting off on the idea of being fucked by Iron Man. It was like fucking in front of a mirror, but this one reflected his own soul back at him.
"Doctor Strange isn't available at the moment," Steve said, coolly, coming around to stand next to Tony. "You'll have to deal with us instead."
Surprised, Tony lost his balance entirely and tipped to the floor in a noisy collision of metal and linoleum. He yelped.
"Oh," he says, finally. There's not much left in his brain. It's been a long night, and he's pleasantly fuzzy in the afterglow. Tony always knows how to get him out of a glum mood. Sure,
"You haven't done anything wrong," Iron Man replies, but his voice is trembling. "You absolutely haven't. I'm glad I could... make you feel good. And I do want you. Of course I want you. I just-- I just." He pauses, and he drags his hand over his face again. "I can't. I mean, I
"Yeah," Tony agreed. He slid his thumb over the pulse point in Steve's neck, the spot he'd just nosed at, and Steve shivered.
Tiberius' smile now was almost gracious. "I'm glad you finally see it my way, Captain." He made a show of glancing around the studio as he started to rise from his chair. "Well, if that's all you have to say, I think we're just about--"
was a hell of a word. And invoking Steve's service was a low blow if he'd ever seen one; it intimated that they'd agreed to behave themselves, when Tiberius had done no such thing. It wasn't as if destroying Tony's reputation was protected by the Geneva Conventions.
Fury finished putting the newspapers on the desk, sat up straighter, and stared at him. His eye narrowed. "Stark."
"Ooh! Are we cheating on your boyfriend? How exciting!" Far from sounding guilty, Tiberius just sounded... curious. Intrigued. And, oddly, approving. "Honestly, Tony, I'm impressed. Didn't know you had it in you. You used to be such a goody-goody about this kind of thing."
Mr. Stark swallows. His mouth opens and closes a few times, shaping silent syllables; he must need to work out exactly what to say.
"Yes," Mr. Stark agrees. He still looks overwhelmed. "I see that." He pauses. "Isn't it a little soon?"
He put his palm flat on the star of Steve's uniform, then bunched his fingers together and drew his hand down, resting his fingertips on Steve's stomach. He glanced a little lower. It was rapidly becoming clear which way Steve dressed.
After several more seconds, Tony raised his head again. His eyes fluttered open; he was blinking like he'd stepped into sunlight after years in shadow. His lips were red and wet, slick, flushed dark, and this time, finally, it was because of Steve. Because Tony wanted him right back. Steve had made him look like this.
The other papers were much the same. Different days, different clubs, different one-night stands. Tony admired the fact that none of the headlines accompanying the photographs of him with men were particularly homophobic. Still, Fury seemed to have a bit of a theme going with his collection.
"You know," Tony began. He said it as if it were an idle observation, but his voice was once again quivering with anger, each word precisely and coolly articulated, placed just so, like a scalpel through flesh. "When most people have concerns about someone their friend is dating, they talk to their friend first. Not national television."
Tony coughs. It's a normal cough; no flowers. He's long since learned to distinguish the two. It makes something new and different in his chest hurt. If this works, he can be two kinds of medical miracle. "No, I know," Tony says. His throat feels like sandpaper. "Never thought it could."
Tony was holding him tight, because of course he was. What else was he supposed to do? Steve's uniform was too thick for him to register anything other than pressure, but Tony was most definitely right behind him, his chest up against Steve's back, crowding closer when Steve slowed down. Steve couldn't feel the warmth but he could imagine it well enough. If Tony hadn't been wearing a helmet, if the air had stilled around them, Steve would have felt the heat of his breath on every exhalation. Tony's hands were at his waist, exactly where they ought to have been; nonetheless, Steve was very aware of Tony's touch. Tony's grip was strong, firm, and perfectly decorous; Steve might even have called it professional. It didn't stop Steve's imagination from working overtime, though. Currently, as they sped across the Manhattan Bridge, he was thinking about dancing. It wasn't even sex, which was probably pathetic, but he knew Tony was a good dancer. If Tony danced with him, Tony might hold him like that. It was one item on a long, long list of things that weren't going to happen.
"Hard as you can give it to me," Steve said, and Tony knew that when Steve said that he actually meant it. "I want to be able to feel it later. No one else ever does that for me, but you know what I can take. I know you know."
"Look," Tony continued, a little quieter. "I don't expect you to understand what I feel for him. I don't even expect you to like him, though it would have been nice if you had." Tony met his eyes, stared him down like they were ten minutes out from the end of the world and Tony had the solution that would save everyone, if Steve only trusted him. "I'm not asking for that. But I am asking you to believe me when I say this. He's not hurting me. I'd know, okay? I'd know."
"I liked it a lot," Steve said. His throat was desert-dry. "It's got a very happy ending, actually. I've read it more than once. I thought it was nice."
Tony drops to his elbows and leans all the way back, arching up so Steve can slide his pants off. Steve steps away from him for the absolute minimum amount of time necessary to do so, and he yanks Tony's shoes off with them. Tony's clothes hit the floor. Tony's still got one sock on, but it's not like he's going to stop and fix it. Tony shivers -- the ambient temperature of the common areas of the Mountain is a little too cold for nudity -- but then Steve pulls him back up and into his feverish embrace again, and Tony's definitely not cold anymore.
