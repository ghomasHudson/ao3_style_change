“It was your decision to make this a marriage of convenience,” he said.
“Wedding?” Sir Albert stared at Reverend Hooper. “Whose wedding?”
“Mayhap I am, and maybe you’ll remember that when I speak to you next about joining the army.”
“Why not? It is the truth.”
“I didn’t mean to spill the wine.”
“Hero.” Sebastian dropped into a chair, then came to his feet again, for John had not sat. “Pushing him away from a wagon is hardly heroism.”
“Why does he say that?”
He swiped at his wet hair as he stepped into the gloomy barn. Odors of animals and rotten hay fouled the air, but John paid that no mind as he stared at the five men crouched in the center of the floor. When they did not look up, he saw they had a sheet of paper on the floor between them.
the soldier asked with a heavy accent.
“I know, but I do not want you to hurt because of me.” He closed his eyes as Sherlock’s fingers played across the buttons at his throat. “Because I love you.”
Although he wanted to tell Greg how desperately he hoped he could be right, he said, “I had no idea you were an expert on marital matters.”
Lord Watson arched his gray brows and smiled. “I should have known that it would be something magnificent. John is not prone to exaggeration.” He ran a finger along the etching on the barrel. “It is well made and not new.” With a squint, he peered at the butt. “There appears to be a crest of some sort here.”
Instead of the frown John expected, his aunt chuckled. “Good. Mayhap you are coming to trust that fine young man you married instead of acting as if he had abandoned you.”
Aunt Hudson added, “We shan’t despair if you decide
“Mr. Holmes?” he gasped.
“His patrol? You are planning to have Sherlock lead a patrol?”
Harry chuckled.
“Why did you not tell me you were leaving?”
His voice lowered to a husky whisper that stirred through John. “Very serious, John. For better or for worse, until death do us part.”
“When you leave this time… will you come back?”
“Do you think that is what this is?”
He turned and aimed across the field. John gasped when, holding the pistol in his left hand, Sherlock fired and bark danced away from the tree trunk.
“Mayhap.” John murmured, but he looked away.
When Sherlock’s gaze flickered from John to Sebastian, John released the breath he had been holding. Sherlock’s smile lost its warmth when fingers cupped John’s elbow. Sebastian’s fingers! He shook them off.
John stared at the friend whose words echoed so closely the question Sherlock had asked him the day after he arrived at Watson Hall. His answer was the same. “Because I must.”
“What is so amusing on such a lovely night?”
John realized he had spoken the last word aloud when Sir Albert smiled and said, “Because you were supposed to be mine.”
“For me?”  A childish delight brightened her eyes. She bent to read the list, giving John a chance to leave with Greg.
“Auntie is upset about Mrs. James – “
“You are very kind,” he replied, unsure of how long he could act as if he swallowed the clankers he spoke. “However, Jameson has served us well for many years. I want to be certain his head is tended to.”
“You should get a new cart.”
Greg rubbed his hands together between his knees. “I did not handle that situation well, I am afraid.”
“Lots of things are changing.” Molly slipped her basket over her arm.
“There is nothing glorious about what I do.  I despise it.”
“I wish I did not know now.”
John frowned at him, puzzled. Let him think Sherlock was concerned solely with salvaging John’s reputation from the muddle left by Moran’s jealousy. As the other guests swarmed toward them, he responded politely when he was introduced to each one. Sherlock took note of each name and of who stood beside whom, a skill as natural to him as breathing, but said little.
“You are so winsome, so ready for the battles of the heart,” he whispered.
Greg spun John toward him. When he was about to protest, Greg’s fierce expression silenced him. With an intense tone he had never heard in Greg’s voice, he snarled, “This is no lark, John! Reverend Hooper’s waiting downstairs for you and Sherlock to stand before him and take vows of fidelity for the rest of your lives. The rest of your lives! You have been rash before, cousin, but think before you agree to something as want-witted as this.”
“Lots?” John smiled tightly. “I had not thought one simple marriage could change the entire village.”
Harry bounced to her feet. “We cannot cancel the beating of the bounds this year. I promised Hugh Thomas that I would remember him at each of the boundary markers this year.”
Going into the small parlor, he was surprised that no one else was there. He glanced at the clock on the mantel and realized he was half an hour early for tea. In his determination to be certain no one noticed that he had been crying, he had misread the clock outside his room.
Trust? John almost laughed, too. He must have given some answer, because she kissed him lightly on the cheek, told him to come down for tea in a few minutes, and left.
"Ung."
As the gun lowered, John looked past the sergeant.
“No.”
If someone else spoke, John did not hear. He did not breathe. Only his eyes moved as he met Sherlock’s verdigris gaze. It took every bit of his courage not to lower his eyes, for he feared seeing his fury at being dragged into a battle which was not his.
“I have not yet decided.”
“If the wedding is delayed – “
John scowled. “She wasn’t supposed to tell anyone.”
“It does make sense. The Moran’s would provide well and you would be close to Watson Hall.  If Uncle accepted Doctor Sawyer’s offer you’d be halfway across the shire!”
Abruptly, he whispered, “No.” John pushed himself away. “Don’t pervert the one thing I thought this war could never touch.”
“Peddler? A peddler is staying in your house?”
“But you said – “
John looked at him in astonishment. He could not mistake the emotion in his father’s voice. Not embarrassment, not anger, not relief, but quiet pleasure. John gazed into his eyes. A sob caught his throat. For whatever transgressions his father believed he had committed, he’d forgiven John completely.
“Will you go with me to the Donovan’s house?” He drew his hand from behind him and held out John’s favorite straw hat.
John moaned with regret as Sherlock raised his lips. Opening his eyes, he used a single fingertip to trace the strong line of Sherlock’s nose and uncompromising curve of his lips.
The note had been simple.
“Stop that!” He ordered when Sebastian teased the curve of his ear.
“Now you can see why I usually walk.  It’s a bit cramped and what isn’t already broken is threatening to break at any moment.” Mr. Holmes said with a laugh.
Not certain as to what she wanted him to say, he asked, “And, my lady?”
“The roads along the shore can be very dangerous.”
Harry sat on the arm of the settee and crowed, “Getting her brother on your side so he will agree to her marrying you. Brilliant plan!”
“No, Sherlock, I – “ He faltered when Sherlock caught John to him and pressed his lips to his neck. It took all his strength to turn his face when Sherlock bent to capture his lips in the sweet prison of passion. “Not like this.”
John walked back to the gate, needing to put some room between them. “I would have guessed it would be easier just to send it with the post.”
“Where did you get this?” He asked.
John understood what Sherlock could not say in the other’s hearing. His weak shoulder frustrated him.
“He has to marry someone!” Greg’s voice was still tight with anger. “And Sebastian isn’t so bad once you get to know him.”
“No.” He didn’t hesitate.
“I stand corrected.” He bowed to her again.
Harry gave John a guilty grin, but tugged him toward the chairs by the window. He was grateful that she gave him this excuse to get away from Sebastian.
He bowed his head toward her. “Good afternoon, my lady.”
“I stand corrected.” She linked her arm through John's. “Perhaps you and I should go to London next Season.”
John stared into his eyes as Sherlock lifted his hand. Sherlock’s fingers slipped beneath the cuff of John’s coat to stroke his wrist before gliding up along his shoulder. The morning no longer seemed chilly as he closed his eyes, wanting to relish this pleasure which he craved in his dreams … and when he woke.
“I am fine.”
how can it be anything but what I see before my eyes? You are a French lancer, a captain!”
John wondered why Greg would not meet his eyes. Mayhap it was no more than guilt.  Guilty he should be, for he had persuaded Molly to believe his affection for her was sincere.  Then…
“I know, but I hope he finds the navy to his liking.”  Biting his lower lip, he said, “And I hope his decision does not influence Harry.”
“Congratulations on your wedding, Holmes.”  Donovan’s smile was broad. “Mr. Watson has been eyed by many Alphas around here, so you should count yourself very lucky.”
He flung his arms around his father as he stared at the Alphas gathering around the wagon. Some from the stables and those from the village; Harry and Greg were there too. They all stared at Mr. Holmes who didn’t move. Was he dead? Had he died saving John?
Harry ignored her dismay. “If they aren’t nearby to rescue him, he must be looking for a place to hide. I need to tell Father that, so he can have the outbuildings secured. If – “
Her great-aunt focused a frown at her. “Don’t stand there snickering, child. Take me back to the house. The mail coach did not miss a single stone.”
“Come in,” Father called.
“Your aunt told me quite imperiously that we should not delay joining the others in the morning room.” Sherlock gave John a rakish leer. “Maybe she thought I would spirit you off to have you alone even before the first toast was raised to our marriage.”
“Because,” Auntie said in her most no-nonsense voice as she stepped out of another passage to stop in right in front of them, I have been searching every inch of the attics for this.”  She held out a lace pocket square that had yellowed with age nearly to the color of John’s hair.
“You don’t know me, yet you say that you love me?” Sherlock asked. “That makes no sense, John.”
“Good night, Mr. Watson,” Mr. Holmes said as he bowed his head.
“Now see here,” began Sir Albert.
“Of him.” Sherlock kept his smile in place, but he chose his words with care. “There cannot be many who failed to hear of Sir Albert’s single foray into politics.”
“If you recall what you said to me last evening, you will know my answer.”
Taking John’s hand, Sherlock bowed over it as gracefully as any of the gentlemen in the ballroom, again bringing forth the questions John wished would remain silent in his head. Who was Sherlock Holmes? No peddler he’d ever encountered had had manners so polished or possessed such an obvious level of education. He might be a peddler now, but John doubted Sherlock had been born to that life.
“What?”  John could not believe what he was hearing.  “But you and Molly sat together through the whole of the blessing of the fishing fleet.  You had luncheon together.  You even danced just about every dance with her.  You two seemed so happy together.  I saw that, and Mr. Donovan must have seen it as well.  I thought – “
“That is a lovely ceremony,” Sherlock said quietly. “I have never heard of such a blessing.”
“London?” Mr. Jensen’s brow ruffled again.
He should not have assumed that things could not get worse. “Sir Albert Moran?”
John scowled and backed away from Greg’s rage.  When he bumped into a man, he whirled to flee.  He took John’s arm, but with gentle respect.
He picked up something and threw it at the fleeing shadow. It missed the man, but John heard another shout. Looking up, he saw the wagon moving. He tried to scramble out of the way. What a fool he was! That rock must have been keeping Mr. Holmes wagon in place.
"But... " Lestrade sputtered.
Sherlock drew John’s hand within his arm. “You did not answer me.”
Faster than he had guessed Sir Albert could move, he had leaped forward and grabbed John’s arm. Before Sir Albert could tug John toward him, Sherlock’s fist struck his wrist with a sharp whack. Sir Albert screeched, but released John.
Maybe he’d gone outside to escape the glances that followed John as he sought Sherlock throughout the room. Stepping out through a French door, he took a deep breath of the warm air. John’s shoulders ached as he let them sag. He’d not guessed how stiffly he had been holding them.
“I’m sorry?”
“No.”
Again the day was gray and damp and clammy. Pulling his coat more tightly around him, he walked down the steps. John realized that more than a dozen of the usual leaders were missing. They must be inside with Father in his office on the ground floor of the Hall, discussing why the authorities had not come to get the prisoner.
,” he growled at John.
“Repay me by telling me what you meant.”
“Your company for tea.” Sherlock gestured to where a maid was placing a tray with all the makings for a pleasant tea on a table by near the bay window.
“Mayhap you can convince him of that.” Molly dimpled. “I could not.”
Sebastian cowered like a beaten pup. Astonished at the pity that washed over him, John was about to speak when Sherlock’s squeezing of his shoulders silenced him.
John could find no fault in Sherlock’s appearance tonight. Again he wore the well-made clothes he had donned when they were married. With his hair neatly trimmed and curled, he could be a fine gentleman from Town, for now he even had polished shoes to match his other finery.
Sherlock smiled wryly. “The temptation to teach Moran a lesson was too sweet to resist.”
“You are not without some graces, young man. I thought you would recognize when a lady wishes to dance.”
“Step aside,” Harry was saying, her face pale with confusion. John could not blame her for being baffled when he himself could not even guess how this afternoon had exploded with every emotion from contentment to anger and then had become a disaster.
“Please let me finish,” he said, not sure he could finish the practiced words if he faltered here. “You must understand that there are many along these shores who would gladly see peace negotiated with that black-hearted Corsican. Livelihoods in the village have been ruined, and those who continue to prosper do so by throwing aside their honest ways to become smugglers and risk ending their days in a noose. Some of those folks would promise anything to see the war ended.”
Whirling, John found the welcome he longed for on Sherlock’s lips and in his arms. As his arms arched up his back, he smiled when Sherlock raised his mouth and looked down at him.
“It may have been a most mistaken thing to assume he would select the Donovan girl for his bride,” his aunt said.
“Yes, and, as you could tell that I longed to be with him, I could see that you did not want to be with Miss Donovan.  You kept her distant.  You did not look at her more than propriety required, and you heeded not a word she spoke.”
John shook his head. “No, it’s alright. I would have learned about it sooner or later.”
“Mr. Watson, I’ll have you know that the traditions of your family matter not one rap to me.”
“Yes.  I believe I heard you speak it moments ago.  Did I not?”
“I could have.”
“The smugglers.” He helped him drink again. “You said something about no need for guns.”
When Sherlock offered to get him something cool to drink before the quartet began to play the first selection, John seemed pleased. His smile faded when Sherlock left John by the chairs as he crossed the vast expanse of the gilt-covered room.
“Speak plainly,” Molly urged. “We use simple words here, not the silly language of Town.”
“If he has not revealed anything by now-” John said, “it seems there is little reason to believe he will anytime soon.”
“Smugglers?”
“You seem to assume that I would risk life and limb for you, Mr. Watson.”
“He did. He showed a decided lack in manners.”
“Hush.” Sherlock went to the dressing room door and peered in to be certain Elsa or one of the other servants was not there. Closing and locking that door as well, he came back to John. His hands settled on John’s shoulders, not stroking, not urging him to the madness of their love, but offering him solace. “I cannot leave.”
“What do you think?”
John wondered if everything was going to go wrong today. He had hoped to sneak into Watson Hall unseen, but as Aunt Hudson walked toward him, he knew that was now impossible.
Suddenly Sherlock stepped away.
Harry rushed inside, not wanting to miss any of the excitement.
“User for what?” John asked.
“Sherlock’s life is elsewhere. Mine is here.”
John looked at his list again, wishing once more that he had waited to speak with her until tomorrow. However, delaying his daily meeting with her would create even more questions from their housekeeper. Mrs. Carson still treated him like a child, though truth be told, she treated Father with the same gentle concern.
He stared at John in disbelief. His hands slipped up from his shoulders to cup his face. If Sherlock had chanced upon him even a year ago, he would not have hesitated to accept this invitation, but he was not the same man he had been a year ago. Too much had happened to change him.
“Oh, dear,” Miss Donovan continued.
“Oh,” his father added, as he turned to leave, “your aunt wishes to go into the village today. Do you mind taking her?”
“Be careful, John.”
“My son tells me that you are seeking shelter within our walls for the night.” Watson’s voice was hearty and welcoming. The sign of an honest man or one well-schooled in the art of lying.
“We all speak German and can read Greek and Latin.”
Aunt Hudson chuckled. “I suspected you would come to that conclusion eventually, my boy. I am glad we all are in agreement, then.” She looked at Greg. “All of us, yes?”
“Why speak of them when you were not there to hear them?”
John glanced through the window on the landing, but could not see the stableyard from where he was.  He needed to go into one of the rooms on the east side of the house if he wanted to check on whether Sherlock’s wagon had returned to Watson Hall.
Hearing the strain in his words, John realized Sherlock was looking in the opposite direction.  Sherlock put an arm around him and led him through the crowd, heading closer to the pier.
“I must meet my great-aunt in the village this afternoon.” John put down his cup.
“Father said to hurry.”  A hint of a grin loosened the tightness of Harry’s lips. “He is not worried that Sherlock will run out on you, but something has him concerned. He has two footman watching the front door and one on the others.”
John nodded. “Which is one of the reasons I have come out here, so my yawns would not seem so rude.”
“Exactly.”  John reached for Greg’s hands, but he folded his arms in front of him. “Greg, you don’t care a rap for Miss Donovan. So why are you offering for her when I know you care so much for Molly.”
curious,” John said as he matched his steps along the walkway. “What did Father think of it?”
“On the contrary, sir.” The peddler smiled. Did he ever stop? “Think how expedient it would be to confront your enemies with oaths in their own language?”
Then he realized that Auntie would not be denied some parts of this celebration. No wonder, he had not seen her since the wedding was announced. Aunt Hudson had been busy making all these arrangements.
John shook his head, grinning.   Sherlock enjoyed his disguise far too much. Although he should be angry that he was poking fun at his neighbors, John wanted to treasure these moments they would have before Sherlock must leave.
“Where did you get this?” he blurted out.
Greg scowled.  “No, we are not waiting for you.  Come along John.”
“How do you expect me to open it if you grab it away from me?” Color washed from John’s face as he heard the abrupt silence which followed his heated words. These were not the words an Omega should be speaking to his mate only minutes after the marriage rites.
He focused on his hat, wishing the brim was large enough to have hidden an expression that must not be allowed to betray the truth.  Sherlock was supposed to leave on the morrow, but he still had not told John what excuse he had concocted. Were these soldiers meeting him? John knew he should ask Sherlock, but he didn’t really want to know. He must not be the one to speak the wrong word that would send Sherlock to hang.
“Of course, but – “
“Not if it ends like this.  That disgusting Corsican will never keep any promise he makes.”
“Of course,” Harry glanced at him with surprise. “Why are you asking?”
“I know you,” Greg stated with the dim hint of a smile. “I am also beginning to know Sherlock. He doesn’t take his vows lightly. He might bend his promise to Uncle enough to kiss you, as he cannot hide that he wants to do so, but he would never seduce you.”
John glanced at Sherlock, knowing he must have heard the cart approaching while John had been lost in his spellbinding touch. He wanted to say something, anything, to keep this moment from ending, but as Sherlock turned to speak with Harry who bounced up the steps, John knew the magic had already ended.
“I do, for I was once as idealistic as he is.”  The fiddles squawked as they were being tuned, and Sherlock smiled. “I wish they would play a waltz or two.”
Father’s arm grew rigid, and John knew he was wondering, as John was, if Sherlock was walking away to leave him in shame even now.
“Why did you own that you had?”
“Watson? Like the manor on the hill?”
“Would you show it to me?”
She frowned. “John Holmes will be your name if you do not change your mind.”
“I did not, but I fear what Sherlock or Father might do if they were to hear about this.”
Auntie smiled with reluctance. “Alright, mayhap a few beef-heads did, but your family and your friends – all who matter – know you for what you are.”  She led John’s eyes to where Sherlock was laughing with Harry.  “And we know what Sherlock is.”
When his hand moved up John’s back, bringing him up against him, he knew why no watchdog would approve of such a sensual dance. John did not care.  This might be the last night they had together, the last chance they had to be in each other’s arms.  He released Sherlock’s hand. Pulling his mouth down to meet his own, he tasted the hidden curves within it.  He swayed against Sherlock, lost in the melody that merged them together in this splendor.
“Yes, would you allow me to practice?”
here, and no guest of mine appears at the beating of the bounds ball dressed like a laborer.”
“I’ll be careful.”
When his cousin handed him into the closed carriage that was waiting by the front door in the steady rain, John glanced along the drive hoping to see Sherlock.  He wondered where Sherlock had gone during the past few days. Was he with his French patrol still near the village and Watson Hall? If so, John hoped Sherlock would stay out of view of the road or any of the residents of the shire.
“His thoughts may all have been of you.”
John held out his hand. “If you wish, I can take it to him for you.”
“The man who delights in touching you.” His finger trailed along John’s cheek to the corner of his mouth. “The man who aches for your lips.” Across his chin, his finger slipped down to graze the somewhat less than starched soaked collar at John’s throat. “The man who cannot sleep when he is alone because he wishes to sleep with you in his arms.”
His friend did not. “Mr. Anderson did not think so. He was quite emphatic that he saw them. He even described the green uniforms that Papa told me are most definitely French.”
“You do know him.”
“Get that Alpha out of your house!”
“Not always.”
“Begone, Sir Albert,” Mr. Donovan ordered. “You are no longer a part of this.”
“I – “
“I wanted a chance to be alone for a while.”
He should have known better than to engage the Lady in a battle of words when his thoughts were so scattered. “I am a man who is not where he belongs.”
“Since you anticipated your vows with Holmes?”
“You? Teach me a lesson?” Sir Albert snickered. “I could break you with my bare hands!”
“I would not wish such a life on anyone.  I have heard it is harsh beyond measure.”
Kneeling to pull off Sherlock’s other boot, John said, “Nothing will.”
When Greg smiled, John gasped, “But I thought you had changed your mind about the Morans. I thought you liked them.”
Harry cried, “Yes, tell us!” She sat on the other side of her brother and looked up expectantly at Sebastian.
Auntie herded Greg out of the room, chatting to him about Miss Donovan. His ears were blistering red as she asked some pointed questions about his plans.
Sherlock smiled. “To get some pillows and blankets.”
“Mr. Holmes?”
“Making plans for next week, when I need to return to my work.”
Mr. Holmes leaned back in the chair and closed his eyes. “Why not? Do you know much of smugglers, Mr. Watson?”
“Do you?” he asked again in a raw whisper.
As their voices faded, John was surprised when his father took his hand. He peeled John’s fingers back from the fist he had formed again without realizing it. Patting his hand, Father smiled.
father has to say about your despicable behavior?”
“Your marriage does matter to all of us,” Greg said as he sat and folded his hands together on the knees of his green breeches. “We all wish to see you well settled.”
Although John expected another volley of insults, Sebastian turned on his heel and stamped out the door. The outer door slammed as he left. John shivered, unable to believe that his torment at receiving him was over.
“What?” He dropped to sit on the wall.
“An excellent idea.” Her nose wrinkled. “You’re leaving puddles in your wake.”
William’s voice was clipped. “I did not expect this.”
He grinned at John’s wistful wish that Sherlock was no longer in the army.  John had taken to the is deception with an ease that astonished him.  “Not that problem, for I have done nothing worthy of being brought up on such charges.” Sherlock swung their hands between them as they climbed the hillock at the edge of the woods.  “I just heard that Sebastian Moran has decided the British navy needs his assistance.”
John was so surprised at how simple it was to avoid Sherlock in the corridors of Watson Hall. Or mayhap Sherlock was avoiding him, for, save for meals, John seldom saw him during the fortnight after his visit to the village. As the pain in Sherlock’s arm diminished, he was often outside, coaching Harry in shooting or talking to the stable hands or in the garden, hunched down next to the gardeners as he engaged the men in conversation. John saw him deep in discussion with his father and heard that Aunt Hudson had invited him to have tea with her twice in the past two weeks.
John chuckled when Harry rolled her eyes as she always did when scolded by Mrs. Carson.
“With help from the smugglers?” Sebastian laughed when John gasped. “John, you should know nothing stays quiet in this village.”
had come to his senses and demanded that Sherlock be honest with him. Uncertain if he could trust his voice, he rose and opened the door.
Yet, even as he prattled, keeping the width of the garden path between them, his thoughts were filled with Sherlock’s voice. Over and over, like and endless echo, he could hear Sherlock talking about readying the wagon to leave. He guessed Sebastian must know that as well, for he was silent.
His smile became ironic. “I have to own I might have thought twice if I had known this would happen.” He winced as he shifted in the chair.
Sherlock grinned. “A good peddler always has every kind of gewgaw on his wagon, even things he could not imagine needing himself.”
“That is what Reverend Hooper told me and your father. He seemed certain we would be pleased.”  He drew John down to sit beside him on the grass.  “Why do you look so distressed.”
When he reached its end, he stared at an impenetrable barricade of briars that reached almost as high as the wall. He did not remember this from the last time he have been through this greenwood; then he realized that the last time had been more than five years ago. With Mr. Wilson’s neglect of his land, the thickets were reclaiming it.
“Cook has some packets for him in the kitchen,” she continued. “You should be certain that he receives them.”
“Sherlock…?” He touched Sherlock’s cheek in the lightest caress.
His shoulders sagged. “She is a generous soul to be so forgiving.”
“I go to speak with her brother as well.”
Rhythmic beeping.  Black.
Molly stopped by a stone wall that wove an uneven path across the hillside as if it were a piece of thread abandoned by a playful kitten. “He does?”
. How he would love to wrap himself around his sensual man, but to do so would bring John more sorrow. He could not forget that he would soon be leaving this village.
“Sir Albert,” Greg growled, “release my cousin at once. If you don’t, I – “
John nodded. “Lord Watson is my father.”
“As you have your shoes?” John pointed to Sherlock’s footwear which was marked by drying salt stains. “Did you walk out into the sea to begin the beating of the bounds?”
“Stay safe,” he whispered. “And far away from here.”
John smiled and took Greg’s hands in his. “Of course. I would be very happy to. But what of Miss Donovan?”
“I look forward to speaking with Miss Hooper at the church gathering.” Greg hesitated, then asked, “Will you help me speak with her there?”
Sherlock took John’s hand as they reached his bedroom door. “I know it’s tradition to carry an Omega over the threshold but I hope you’ll understand why that would not be a good idea.” He rubbed his shoulder.
“And Reverend Hooper?”
Again Harry shrugged, but her mouth was set in a straight line. “It’s possible. That accursed Frog bunched up some pillows on his cot to make it look as if he were asleep. Now he has run back to his comrades, and he will be able to tell them how poorly prepared we are.”
Molly remained sitting in her pew. She stood, and John went to her, leaving Sherlock to speak with his father and the minister.
John squeezed her hand. “I am enjoying this day, and I am glad you are coming to the ball tonight. We shall have a grand time.”
“Just like that?”
The rattle of a carriage announced an arrival. John looked out the other window and swallowed his moan of dismay. It was Reverend Hooper’s pony cart. The special license must have been delivered, and Father had sent for the minister to marry him and Sherlock.
Currently without beta so if you notice any glaring mistakes, be polite and let me know.   Thanks!
“Be that as it may, I will not bargain with you, Mr. Watson.” He pushed the case beneath the seat of the wagon. “Is there something else that I might interest you in buying?”
“Thank you, Mr. Donovan,”  John said, hoping they would believe his feigned serenity.  “I appreciate your arrival when Sir Albert was being so beastly. If you will excuse me, I think it would make good sense for me to sit down in the carriage for a few moments to regain my composure.”
“I understand well enough.”
“But, John, if others knew how Sir Albert treated you – “
“As do you.” A swift smile raced across his lips. “Your father has given you an excellent education, John. Did he teach you other languages, too?”
“Nothing stays secret long in Watson Hall, does it?”
Sherlock stood and started to speak. Then he closed his mouth. Nodding, he said, “Very well, John. I can see the sense in your suggestion. Give me until the end of the week to make up a good excuse that will not endanger you or your family. Then I will leave.”
Sherlock wanted to laugh Lady Hudson’s words, but he could not, for John might think his amusement was with him when he firmly held to his dignity despite his great-aunt’s words. Eccentric? That was no exaggeration.
“A French bastard. I know. You have called me that more than once today.”
“Do you live here,
“Not yet.” Sherlock crossed the room. Taking John’s hands, he bent toward him as if to kiss him. “Have you?” he murmured.
As he walked with Harry toward the gate, Sherlock listened to her talk about her determination to serve her country. Did every young Alpha harbor dreams of glory?
A familiar laugh halted his panic. John looked up into Sherlock’s sparkling eyes. When Sherlock motioned for John to continue among the trees with him, he smiled.
John nodded, then his smile grew stiffer. “You ask a lot of questions, Mr. Holmes.”
He gags again on the tube.
John motioned toward the house, hoping he could convince Moran to leave the garden before he destroyed all of Miss Donovan’s flowers. “Why don’t we -?”
“Then, John,” The minister said, interrupting thoughts which brought more heat to John’s face, “’Tis time to say your vows with this man you love.”
“Hush, sweetheart. It is too late to deny what happened.”
He shook his head. “They seldom bother me, because I have usually found shelter off the road before nightfall. Other vagabonds, who prefer to consider themselves knights of the pad, may not be brave enough to halt a carriage, but see a solitary peddler as an easy target.”
“And?”
“My nation was pleased when I managed to get back with the help of some smugglers who ply the waters between England and France. My connections with them made me even more valuable to my government.” Sherlock smiled. “I was offered a promotion and this opportunity to help bring the war to a quicker end.”
“Why do you find it so difficult to believe an Alpha would not take advantage of the opportunity to marry you?” Sherlock’s gaze swept over him, and he edged away.
“I thought to see how you were faring, John.”
He waved to Molly before hurrying across the field. He breathed a sigh of relief when he reached the trees on the far side of the field. Now there was no chance that Sebastian would see him.
“About your affection for Molly?”
“Are only two of your enemies.” Sherlock took a deep breath and released it through tight lips. “You need to realize, John, that the night I arrived here, the smugglers came here to teach your father a lesson about interfering with their work.”
Greg shuffled his feet as if he were the guilty one. When he raised his eyes, John saw he was uncomfortable with him as Greg had never been. Tears pricked John’s eyes. The most horrible legacy of these lies might be that he was ripped away from his beloved family.
He grimaced. “Father will not be pleased that Greg is not here today. He expects all of us to take our duties as seriously as he does his.” Glancing at his friend, he said, “I am sorry, Molly. I know you hoped to see him today.”
But, when John sat alone as he rode back to Watson Hall, he wondered who would be victorious in the end.  Either way, he feared Sherlock might not be able to keep his promise to return to him.
John raised his head.  “Why didn’t you tell me that before?”
“I never try to repeat things unless I know them to be the truth.” John said.
“His real name is Sherlock.” Or was it?  John had simply assumed that Sherlock was his real first name, even though he had heard his men call him Captain Huillet.  He had not denied that his name was Sherlock, but he was no longer sure when the line now was between the truth and myriad jumble of lies.  He must ask him to be honest with him about that when Sherlock returned.  It should be the first thing John did, even though his lips ached for Sherlock’s upon them.
“So I see.”
“I did. When I am certain you are safe from the Morans and their machinations, I will ask your father to petition for an annulment of this marriage.”
John leaned his head back against the chaise lounge. Maybe he could have persuaded Sherlock to change his mind about all of this if he’d had a chance to speak with him alone again. Sherlock had been avoiding him.
“Of course,” she answered, without lifting her gaze from her food.
“Don’t look so shocked. You haven’t had a chance to meet her because she’s been visiting in Canterbury.”
“Yes,” he whispered, hoping the witnesses would translate the blush on his face as embarrassment. Instead he was flustered by Sherlock overhearing his owning to the minister what he’d never said to him. Although he was not sure that he loved Sherlock Holmes, being with him was endlessly thrilling. Sherlock teased him and forced John to keep up with his quick wit. When John despaired, he offered compassion and dared him to face his problems head-on. The aura of mystery surrounding Sherlock tantalized him. And his touch… John’s bones threatened to melt like sweets left in the sun as he thought of how this ceremony would end. He would be in Sherlock’s arms and his mouth on John’s. Later –
His voice sounded strangled in his ears, but he managed to say, “Do not think me less than grateful for what you did, Sherlock, for I know you saved my life, but it is that very type of heroic gesture that Harry sees herself making in an effort to save England from Napoleon’s invasion.”
“Tis not him I am thinking about.”
“You need not be so surprised,” Sherlock said, waving aside the choking gun smoke. “I would be addled not to be able to protect myself and my wares” -he smiled as he glanced at his right arm- “though, you may not believe me when I say that I usually escape such attacks with much less damage to myself.”
Sherlock chuckled. “Every word you say intrigues me more.”
She laughed. “Then I shall endeavor to speak only German oaths from now on.” Rubbing her knuckles, she asked in a more somber tone, “What were you doing out here with Sir Albert? You should know better John!”
“Are you in more pain?” John asked, adjusting the sling that threatened to slip from Sherlock’s shoulder.
“Not overtly, at first, but Harry could use some overseeing on her patrols. She respects Sherlock. It will work out well.” Father smiled. “After all, John, if you trust Sherlock enough to give him your heart, I can trust him enough to keep track of your rambunctious younger sister while we guard the shore from invasion.”
“I wonder if Father knows of this,” he said quietly. “That may be why he had some of the gentlemen to the house for a discussion last night.”
He had no chance to answer.
A knock sounded at his door. John sat up. Could it be Father? Maybe
“Harry told me there is a legend that the first marker is now hidden beneath the waves a few feet off shore.”
“If you wish to leave, Sherlock…” John began as they entered the grand salon where the evening’s entertainment would be held.
His smile returned along with the twinkle. John could see he was amused again.
“John! Isn’t it a grand morning?” Aunt Hudson waved to him from the pony cart that was rolling to a stop in front of the house.
John greeted the minister, glad that he and his father welcomed him into their conversation.  John chatted with them as gaily as if his cares were as distant ass the thin clouds over the sea while he watched Sir Albert continue past.  The glower he fired in John’s direction warned him that he would have to evade Sir Albert and be cautious during the rest of the day.
“I have found that is the way to learn things.”  Sherlock picked up his cup again and took a sip. The blend was not strong, the leaves likely reused to save Watson Hall’s precious stores. “Harry calls me Sherlock. Will you, too?”
John’s fingers trembled as he reached for the lace.
“Sebastian did not – “
“Have you traveled far?”
“You speak as if you have had the experience of being in prison.”
“Are you so certain of that?”
John looked over his shoulder and saw Sir Albert standing at the edge of the dancing area.  He was not watching the dancers, but straining to see into the shadows.  Had he seen them?  No, he could not have, or he would have intruded even more than he had.
“And you.”
John expected a retort, but Mr. Holmes only placed the tea in his hands again. When John started to give it back, he put his hand atop it. The cloth warmed with his touch. He should have pulled away, but he couldn’t bear the chance of the tea falling into the dust. At least, that’s what he told himself as he savored the surprising pleasure of that warmth.
“It’s not funny!”
I am right.” She rose, putting a hand on her right hip. When John stepped forward to help her, Auntie waved him away. “It’s just the weather, child. The dampness gnaws at my old bones just as curiosity gnaws at my mind. As it does yours.”
“Your uncle has been a problem before.”  Mr. Donovan wiped his wet hands on his breeches. “We can deal with him on this.”
With a roar, Sebastian shoved John aside and raced forward, his fists raised.
“That peddler’s name is Sherlock.”
“My name is Sherlock.  Sherlock Holmes.” His laugh took on a conspiratorial tone. “If you do not wish to buy the tea, perhaps you could give me the name of another in your household who would?”
When Sherlock seized his arms again, John gasped as he growled, “Can’t you realize that what we want sometimes is the very thing we cannot have?” He pulled his blanket back over him.
“I believe I have mistaken yours.” He walked to the door and opened it. Looking over his shoulder, he saw Greg’s face harden as John said, “I thought you cared more about your cousin than ingratiating yourself with that disgusting slug and his father.”
It was all lies. Why could no one else see that?
John glanced at him, then lowered the cups to the table. He would never quail before Sir Albert again. No longer did he have to listen to his comments about how happy John would be when he married Sebastian.
John should caution Sherlock about Sebastian’s temper.  He’d seen Sebastian strike a man from his feet with a single blow. The man had not awakened for so long, they feared he was dead. But John could not speak of that when Sebastian stood beside him.
“Thank you, Mr. Watson. I owe you a debt for your kindness.”
“Sherlock Holmes?”  Sir Albert roared with laughter. “That is not a Froggish name.”
“I have no idea what you are talking about. Sherlock and I are legally married. You heard Reverend Hooper say so when you and Dudley burst into the wedding supper.”
He silenced his groan as John stepped toward him. Moving back to keep the distance between them the same, he heard laughter. Not from John, but from his own thoughts when he considered how his tie-mates would be amused by his resistance to this sweet pleasure. He was acting like a young omega just out of the schoolroom, afraid of the very idea of the devastating power of the desire in John’s breathless words.
Leaning over him, Sebastian laughed. “Save your strength. If you scream until you are weak, you won’t give me as much pleasure.”
“You are my enemy.”
John smiled back. It was easier than he had guessed. He was tempted to throw his arms around Father and spill he truth – all of it. He had not been Sherlock’s lover, not before the wedding, not after, but he feared he was falling in love with a man who had already told him he was going to leave him.
“Of finding out the truth about the man who calls himself Sherlock Holmes,” answered Mr. Donovan as he handed John up into the carriage which was not as fancy as his father’s.  When he was sitting on a patched cushion, Mr. Donovan took the seat across from him.
“Greg!”  John shouted.
Sherlock drew him to one side of the room. He waited for his father to protest. Then, he realized, his father saw nothing amiss with a couple about to wed wanting a moment alone.
The rattle of wheels coming along the road brought an expression of dismay from Harry, warning Sherlock that someone she did not want to see her shooting was coming toward them. Turning he saw John driving toward them in a small cart. With him was a silver-haired woman who must be his great-aunt.
“Yes,” he said as quietly, “You know, she’s just as worried as you are about Harry’s plans.”
“Instead you chose to break my heart? You are nothing but a – “
John placed his comb on the table beside the window. He then opened the window to allow in the fresh air from the garden, but none of the luscious scents could ease his despair at how much easier it was to speak of Sherlock and himself as lovers than to own to the uneven state of his heart. “I am being honest when I say that love is not why Sherlock decided to agree to marry me.”
into the house. An offer of a night in the stables and a plate in the kitchen would not have sufficed. He wanted this chance to meet Lord Watson, not simply enjoy his hospitality. Sherlock had heard so much about the baron and his holdings here, and he was delighted to have the opportunity to meet the man and ascertain if Lord Watson was as honest and defiant of the French and their uneasy allies, the smugglers, as he’d heard whispered about in the shire.
"No no no. Don't try to talk. The tube in your mouth and throat is a ventilator. Now that you're awake and stable the doctors will remove it.  Do you remember what happened?"
“Sherlock, please – “
“Auntie!”
“If you did nothing amiss – “
“John!” Greg snarled. “Did you take a knock in the cradle? What if Sebastian learned of this?”
Greg chuckled. “You’re describing Sir Albert, not Sebastian. You should give Sebastian another chance, John. You might be pleasantly surprised.”
John nodded, although he would have preferred to ask him to explain himself.  The brangle now going on between Lady Hudson and Harry had no place for him, because neither of them would listen to him when they were in such a pelter.
“Explain? How can you when I see you with
“Was I?”
“If you were a gentleman, you would not have listened.”
Elbowing away the other armed man, Greg stepped in front of him.  “What do you know of this, John?”
He saw his shock mirrored on Harry’s face, but he did not want to bicker here in the foyer.  Something was bothering Greg, and he would get no answer from him until they were in the carriage.  John knew his cousin too well to believe that either he or Harry or the two of them combined could wheedle anything from him before he was ready to speak.
John’s shoulders shifted under his coat. Once the mist drifted back out to the sea, the day would grow warm, but, for now, he needed the coat’s warmth. He stood on the front steps of Watson Hall and watched the people gathered in what had been the inner bailey when the hall had been called a castle. There must be more than three-score villagers and residents of the shire in the courtyard, but it was preternaturally silent.
It did not take long for John to find his cousin in the crowd, because he stood right next to Sherlock.  His heart always seemed to lead back to his husband. He hoped Sherlock's would someday lead him back to John.
“I am trying to do so.”
“Mayhap because you’re acting so strangely.”
Quietly, Sherlock asked, “Do you want me to leave here and never come back, John? Do you want me to leave you with a ruined reputation?”
Harry had sworn him to secrecy this morning before she’d told him of her plans to run off and join the army.  Her alpha face flushed with pride, she failed to notice the pain that painted his.  His dearest childhood dream, now being realized by his sister, had been dashed at the tender age of 14 as his body rebelled and forced him into the first heat of a new omega.
“Let him realize what his cruelty cost him.” He smiled. “And won me.”
In horror, John understood what he intended to do. “Sebastian, no!” He gasped again. Either Sebastian did not hear him, or he chose to John. He shoved John ahead of him into the parlor where John’s father and family sat… and Sherlock!
"Sherlock!"
“Are you?”
“You must keep it,” Mr. Holmes said.
“His father told him that he would be marrying you. He simply cannot believe he will not.” She hesitated, then said, “Please do not take this the wrong way, but I suspect Sebastian cannot imagine you would choose a penniless peddler over him, the Alpha son of a baronet who is full of juice.”
“Bah! That’s your father speaking at his most pompous.”  Auntie laughed at John’s gasp of amazement. “Even he knows the truth has many shades other than black and white.” A frown flitted across her face. “Or he would if he stopped to think about it.”
John shucked his gloves, tossed them in his hat, and set them atop one of his baskets on the long table. “Heard what?”
“I would offer you a ride back to Watson Hall,” he said, “If you wish.”
“You didn’t answer my question.”
“I am fine. Jameson got hit pretty hard.”  Greg smiled as the coachee was lifted from the road and put in the carriage by some of the men who had arrived with Mr. Donovan. The man who had been shot was carried to a cart that was drawing up beside the carriage.  Paying them no mind, Greg continued, “John’s feathers are ruffled, but that might not be all for the bad.”
He did not need his life complicated by another impossible Alpha. Father had jested about not wanting him to marry until he was as old as Mrs. Carson, but he knew he wished him settled in a home of his own. How many times had Father said in the past fortnight that John was a year older than his papa had been when he’d accepted Father’s proposal? Too many.
“You are disturbed about Sherlock joining us for the nightly patrols, aren’t you?” his father furrowed his brows in concern. “There is not much danger of doing more than tripping over something in the dark.”
“Is it Miss Donovan?”
“I guess it is time to be completely honest with you.”
Reverend Hooper took John’s other hand between his. “Will this Alpha make you happy, John?”
Younger by 4 years, Harry likely didn’t remember John dashing from room to room in their manor, swinging his wooden sword at invisible foes.  John had listened peripherally as Harry railed against Napoleon and ‘those damned frogs’, his mind drawn back to his former dreams of glory as he had listened to his grandfather’s stories of fighting the colonials.
“You would be wise,” he said, “to announce yourself loudly wherever you go. You do not want to be mistaken for that French prisoner.”
"Jesus, love. More!"
“And what problem is that?” John asked.  “Could I hope there has been a court-martial of some sort, and no one in my family is now serving in the military?”
"Feel that?" A groan escaped John's throat. "Feel that hard cock? Filling you, stuffing you, waiting to breed you?"
Warmth washed over him as Sherlock smiled so gently that John knew his fears had been silly. His smile reached within him to melt the ice around John’s heart. Gasps rang through the chapel as Sherlock stepped down from the altar and walked toward John.
“Why? You need more information to sell us out to your evil master?”
“No.” He answered shortly.  Meeting the peddler’s eyes again, it was obvious that the man was enjoying this.  John’s gaze sparked.  He was a respectable omega.  The first born son of an honorable alpha.  And while he had shown a decided lack of manners in his staring, that was no excuse for the man to be rude.
“But it would be the perfect gift for Harry, my younger sister is the Alpha heir-“
“Sebastian Moran would be an excellent match for John. He is -”
“That you will find a way to get out of this betrothal?”
“Yes.”
“The rest is that you are spying for the French.” John could not allow his love for Sherlock to persuade him to forgive him.
John fought his body that slanted toward him, wanting more than this chaste salute. Taking a steadying breath as Sherlock walked out of the room with Harry, he forced his fingers to unclench at his sides.
“Maybe you are growing up more than I had guessed.”
John shook his head in fervent denial.
“Do I pass your inspection, dear husband?” Sherlock asked as he handed John to the ground. “Or must I suffer a lecture for some inadequacy?”
peddler, but John only nodded as he went back out into the sunshine. Steering the cart he had driven from Watson Hall along the cobbled street that led up from the harbor, he was glad to reach the neat stone house where his best friend lived.
“I couldn’t. Harry was about during supper, and Father has been busy all evening.” He paused by the stable door lit by a single lantern. It was so quiet compared to the times when he came here to get his horse to ride. The stable hands must all be asleep by this hour. He envied them their carefree sleep. “I thought you might be more forthcoming now that you are to be on the road.”
Why couldn’t Harry inherit their cousin’s good sense? Why did she have to be as impulsive as John? Why did she have to have the ability to act on such impulsiveness?
“She speaks so many.”
“Did I frighten you?” Mr. Holmes held up a pail. “I was collecting water for my horse.”
“You are acting as if you are being forced into this match.”
“What happened to you, John?” Harry asked, staring at him in disbelief.
“To wash you off, Sir Albert,” he jeered. “If you’re going to act like a child, that’s how you should be treated.”
“If I hadn’t thrown that rock at the smuggler that seized me, the wagon wouldn’t have rolled.”
“You need not look so fearful. Your father was very emphatic in saying that you would not marry Sir Albert.” A slow smile eased along his lips. “On that, I agree with him completely.”
“The dress for tonight?”
“Husband?” choked out Sergeant LaVelle. “Why is your husband here in England?”
John closed his eyes and sighed. “So you could learn where Mr. Anderson’s buildings were.”
Taking his friend by the arm, John drew her around the corner of the house. He did not want to chance someone overhearing Molly. Looking about to be certain no one was lurking, listening to them, he said, “I have thought so as well, and I know Father has been making inquiries in that direction.”
“Leaving?” John pressed a hand to his heart. “Who? Harry?”
“Then you should know that they have one universal trait. They know how to hide and stay hidden from any authority that might wish to halt them.” He grimaced. “I didn’t know a broken bone would hurt like this.”
John looked expectantly at Sherlock. This was his last opportunity to tell the truth, but he acted as if he had no qualms about this mockery of a marriage. Maybe he truly was mad.  Had he traded a life with Sebastian for a life with a madman? Glancing at Sherlock’s fine clothes, John shivered. Or did he have another reason for agreeing to wed John. A peddler should not aspire to mate a baron’s child, but John was more and more sure that Sherlock was no more a peddler than John was. Sherlock had some reason for behaving as he did. John just wished he had some idea what it might be.
“But they were the smugglers.”
“Do you speak of me, Auntie?” Harry asked, bending to give her a kiss on the cheek.
“Come and hear what Sherlock was telling me about how the French are moving across the continent.” Harry babbled.
“You have expressed no curiosity about why I would not sell you the pistol.”
“Will you sell it to my father?”
He held his arms close to keep them from being snatched by the briars growing under the trees. This must be Mr. Wilson’s copse. He did little to maintain his land, preferring to spend his time at the inn near Mr. Jensen’s warehouse. His heart slowed its frantic pounding as he rushed through the wood. The shadows were like furtive breaths of cold are, but he shrugged them off. Nothing could be icier than his heart at the thought of mating Sebastian Moran. Suddenly, John’s hand was grasped. With a cry, he tried to pull away. He could not let Sebastian find him here alone. John was not sure what Sebastian would do in his determination to force him to be his mate.
Moran bellowed like a mindless bull. “My apology? Why should I apologize to him when he is a whore?”
John touched his great aunt’s arm. When Auntie glanced at him and nodded, he knew that she understood what could not be said aloud. To engage her nephew in a squabble now would only lengthen this uncomfortable situation.
“The nightly patrols?”
Father blinked, then nodded. Lifting John’s hand off his arm, he placed it in Sherlock’s hand. John thought his father would say something to them, but he stepped back.
“You give orders very easily for a peddler.”
“I have not!”
And Greg! How could he have suggested it would be an excellent idea if John were to marry Sebastian? His cousin and Sebastian Moran had been enemies since birth, being born within months of each other.
John wanted to tell him that Sherlock was not
He opens his mouth, a snappish retort at the ready.
His heart thumped in terror with every sound.  He feared Greg would hear its frantic beat when he glanced at him as he sat across from him and said, “You are skittish today, John.”
“I have, on occasion, done my hawking in London, although I find the streets too close.” He laughed again. “And I find the competition too fierce. I prefer to spend my time walking these country lanes instead of selling from a stand pad in the city.”
“You are wrong about that.” Sherlock’s finger stroked John’s cheek. When John did not look at him, his finger ran along John’s jaw before tilting his chin up. “I am filled with second thoughts, John.”
“John,” Lady Hudson crowed, “you didn’t tell me he was this pleasant on the eyes. My boy, no wonder you are as skittish as a man hiding under his mistress’s bed when her Alpha is at the door.”
Mr. Holmes paused. “Aren’t you coming, Mr. Watson?”
“Are we?” Mr. Donovan smiled.  “Only if you consider peace insane.”
Greg shouted, “Are you mad, Sir Albert? Do not treat John so crassly.  He is not our enemy.”
“I’ve tried,” John said. “I even went for a carriage ride with him and Father and Sir Albert one day. He was loud and monopolized every conversation. Oh! And he wiped his nose on his sleeve.”
“As I said, it is not that simple.  Andrew is strongly in favor of me marrying his sister.”
Shaking his head, he whispered, “How can she be so shortsighted? There is no glory worth dying for.” He hoped his tears carried not as jealousy, but fear for Harry’s safety.
He was astonished to see John partnered by his father, then realized he had not seen Moran arrive. “Where is John’s eager
Gone was the ironic smile. Gone was the twinkle of merriment in Sherlock’s eyes. Gone was everything but a sorrow that struck him more fiercely than the smugglers had.
“I’m sure he has learned many interesting things.” John did not try to keep the sarcasm out of his voice. “Have you shared
“I believe I have learned enough over the years to find my way on my own.” She turned to greet Greg and his partner.
“What thought? You need not give the Omega a dowry. My son is quite mad for him.”
Mr. Donovan did not allow him to turn back to his carriage. When he tugged John toward the other carriage that was a gray shadow in the dim afternoon light, he looked over his shoulder. “Greg!” he cried.
Greg leaped forward and scooped up the wounded man’s gun.  He aimed it at Sir Albert as more men stepped out onto the road.
“I got caught out in the storm, Auntie.” He plucked at his damp clothes. “I should go and change.”
“If I had, I would not have been want-witted enough to return here.”  Sherlock murmured against his ear.
“No.” He kicked a stone under the wheel so that there was no chance the wagon would roll. “I had other things on my mind last night.”
“He should make inquiries also into the question of whether they are obtaining help from the French.”
“I must be ready to defend what I believe is right.” Sherlock brushed his fingers against John’s cheek in the way he loved. “However, I do not see it as the path to glory.  I have been trying to persuade Harry of that, too.”
John started to tell him that was ridiculous, then realized Sebastian might take his answer as a vow that he had a
He let his friend’s chatter surround him as they walked out the gate and turned toward the shore, where the first marker was set on the very edge of the strand.
Lord Watson gave them a sympathetic smile before following his aunt and youngest child up the steps. Greg had arrived on his own at least an hour ago.
He frowned. Tonight had not been the first time he’d heard Greg speak of the Moran’s without his usual rancor. His cousin was more of a gentle soul, not usually inclined to jump into the fray with the French as Harry wished to do. Had he seen something in Sebastian that John had not?
Greg looked away.  “I thought this would be a good day to ask Miss Donovan to marry me.”
“Sir?”
His kiss was to silence John’s question, but it brought to life the desire that refused to be quiescent.  When Sherlock’s breath snagged, John knew he was finding it as hard to resist as he was.  Sherlock gave him the swift smile that made happiness swirl about within him, then he was gone.
“For someone who avers that he is doing well, you seem to be frightfully perturbed.” He laughed again and backed John toward the wall. When John gasped as he bumped into it, he said, “You must not be thinking clearly if you do not have time for this.” His fingers brushed John’s cheek.
John glanced at him. He must be wrong. He could not have heard a mirthful undertone in Sherlock’s words.  As he faced his father, he feared his yearning for a single kiss had possessed him like a curse. Never did he think anything through to its conclusion. If he had paused to think, he would have known that the cost of this pleasure was far too high.
“Mrs. James?” John chuckled in spite of his disquiet at the strain in his bosom-bow’s voice. “I trust she will keep Auntie busy for hours with her list of ailments.”
“You threw a rock at him?” He started to chuckle, but the sound became a moan.
John was pulled away, and he raised his fist to make sure Sebastian did not hurt him – or Sherlock – again. His eyes widened as he discovered that it was his father who held him. Slowly he lowered his hand to his side.
Molly giggled.  “I hope it will be.”
John took a breath to retort, but running steps echoed wildly through the room before Harry burst through the door. She reached out to steady Aunt Hudson, who was barely out of her path, but Auntie waved Harry aside.
Greg grinned at John, “I shall get married one day. If I want to be prepared, I have to keep my eyes open now to learn from the mistakes of others.”
“Come with me, my love.”
John glanced, astonished, at Mr. Holmes, who was sitting, his face as gray as the stone walls of Watson Hall, with his right arm cradled in his left hand. Pouring a glass of wine from the decanter his father always had waiting for unexpected guests, John held it out to him.
“I have down-pinned you when I know you enjoy this day.”
“We both shall.”
John stiffened and his hands gripped the edge of the wagon.  The peddler stood too close, his words brushing the nape of John’s neck. When he reached past him and pushed aside the material in the dish box, John edged away. He faced him, and he hoped his smile was properly polite.
“Take advantage of? Is that your only reason for joining them?”
John watched his own fingers settle on a palm that was rough from long days holding the reins and riding through weather of all sorts. Mr. Holmes fingers folded over his, but he said nothing as he assisted him into the cart. Waiting for John to settle himself, he swung up easily to sit next to him. His legs seemed too long for the short space and John shifted to give him more space.
Sherlock’s fingers brushed John’s cheek, and he looked up to see sympathy in his eyes. “I thought you knew,” he whispered.
“Molly leaves not a block from the shore where the warehouse is.” John hesitated, then asked, “Do you want me to take a message to Mr. Jensen for you?”
He didn’t answer.
“Are you truly going down to the chapel to be married?” She asked incredulously.
“It’s never too late!” He was distressed that Sherlock was echoing Auntie’s words. Had all of them gone crazy?
Sherlock shrugged.  “If he is out and about at night, is he ministering to the townsfolk or doing the devil’s own duties? I don’t know.  It’s not my task to uncover all the smugglers, just to arrange a meeting with their leader.”
“It will be alright,” he said.
“I’ll give you the rest to Cook after supper.”
“Satisfy it?” John whispered as his gaze settled on Sherlock’s smiling lips. Satisfy it with a kiss? He feared he was quite out of his mind to be thinking so about a peddler, but he could not deny his own thoughts of Sherlock’s arm sweeping around his waist and bringing his mouth to his.
“I don’t think he needs to fear rain,” Sherlock said, glancing up at the sky where only a few wisps of clouds marred the perfect blue. “Tomorrow mayhap. Today is the perfect day for rowing out to the boats.”
He stared, as he backed away in one slow step, at the green and black pantaloons visible beneath the heavy greatcoats. When one man pulled a pistol from beneath his coat, John saw the flash of chevrons on the green sleeve of his uniform.
“I know.” John managed the two whispered words.
He nodded, “Yes, I did.”
Sherlock gripped John’s shoulders, pulling him to his feet and away from his bed. “My dear husband, I recall that it was for your convenience, or at least the convenience of your reputation, that we wed.”
“You are welcome to enjoy the gardens. The water garden is especially pretty at this time of year.”
Sherlock repeated the wedding vows in a clear voice, but John’s trembled as he promised to love Sherlock forever. When Sherlock took his left hand in his, John gasped as he watched him slide an ornately twisted ring onto his fourth finger.
“Yes. It shocked me when I confronted my men about their stupidity in coming here and I learned they had obeyed orders to stay away from any of the houses along the shore. I guess you were quite the hero in keeping the smugglers from their mischief.”
“Of what?”  John did not want to lie to him, but if he intended to be Sir Albert’s ally… That made no sense, for why would Sir Albert have stopped their carriage if they were allies? Nothing made sense now.
“Sit here beside me.” Auntie urged.
John closed the book when he heard Auntie’s voice from behind Elsa. It was clear he would not be reaching the end of the chapter now. He recognized that tone. Auntie had something she considered very important on her mind.
“No, you are not.”  John tapped the list. “You will see that most of the items we need are for you.”
“Why not? The sun is out and so am I.” Sherlock’s fingers rose to brush John’s fringe back off his face. “And I am here with a man who makes me forget how many miles we will be walking in a circle today.”
“Anyone with a bit of wit about them shall.”
John wasn’t sure how to get rid of Sebastian. He didn’t want to go into the house with him trotting after like a puppy, but there was no choice. Perhaps Greg, who seemed to have become friends with Sebastian in the last month, would be about and engage him in some sort of discussion while John… While he checked on Sherlock. Avoiding the temptation to do that had him lingering in the garden in the first place. The doctor had assured them that Sherlock’s arm didn’t break as they’d feared. Instead, he had wrenched his shoulder fiercely, an injury that would take almost as long to heal as a broken arm.
Push and pull.
John nodded, opening the door wider. Greg’s rigid posture mirrored his own. Closing the door after him, Greg walked over to stare out the window that overlooked the gardens. John waited for him to say something, but he remained silent.
“’Tis an excellent idea, because it is mine.” Aunt Hudson smiled. “Go, child.”
He shook his head. To own the truth, he barely recalled anything about the Beta female who’d asked him to dance twice at a gathering almost a year ago. It wasn’t the fact that she’d made an offer for him or the fact that Father had turned it down. It was the fact that Father had never mentioned anything to him about it.
“You are right, John. I had no interest in recounting the details of our courtship, for I was not sure what tale you were spinning for your friends.” He folded his arms on the high back of a chair. “And I would be want-witted not to take advantage of meeting the elite of this area.” Sherlock’s smile vanished so quickly, John blinked as he added, “And I would be want-witted not to know of the incident in the garden.”
He watched John stand with a grace that only teased him to think of how handsome an Omega he was. Sherlock must not be waylaid from his work. “Mr. Watson, would you by chance be going near Mr. Jensen’s warehouse while you are in the village?”
“Impossible!” Sir Albert pointed a thick finger at his silent son. “Speak up, you useless excuse for an Alpha!”
“Short? You are leaving?”
John shuddered as Sherlock said the words he’d not dared to even think. “You do not know what you are talking about. You are a stranger here at Watson Hall.”
“As do I. You have no idea how much I regret that we have had to meet as enemies.”
John mouthed his name as he stared at Sherlock. He was dressed in the casual clothes he had worn when John first saw him.  He wondered where his uniform was, then recalled the secret compartment in Sherlock’s wagon. No wonder he had been so determined that John would get no more than a quick glance at its contents.
“Mr. Watson!” Mr. Jensen, who was barely taller than his counter, wiped his hands on a stained apron. “Were you expecting the arrival of a package today?”
“How can you ask that? His friend’s eyes widened as she whispered. “Is it true what is rumored in the village? Did your father force you to marry this peddler?”
“Right arm,” Mr. Holmes said in answer to his father’s question. “Down from the shoulder, my lord. I shan’t be able to drive my wagon, and I shall - “
If they even considered coming here, they must be met with every possible resistance. The Frogs could not win as much as a grain of English sand.
But this day did not need to be ruined.
“No?” John’s eyes grew wide as Mr. Holmes eyes narrowed to slits.
John waved to Molly Hooper, who was working, as she did every day, in the rose garden encircling the parsonage where she lived with her father Reverend Hooper. Molly stood and waved back, her dark gold hair catching the sunlight, even below her bonnet’s brim. There were rumbles throughout the village, asking why a woman as pretty and prettily mannered as the minister’s daughter had never married. Molly never spoke of this private matter, even to John. However, John suspected it was because Molly had a
, but instead asked, “What is disturbing you?”
“If you keep speaking with the Town polish, Sebastian,” Molly interjected, “no one bearing the bounds will be able to understand you.”
John stared up at him. To give voice to his suspicions had been ridiculous. “If you wish an answer, I will say that I believe you enjoyed too much of my father’s wine. I can think of no other reason why you would mistake my words for a threat.”
“Reverend Hooper brought it with him when he came here from Devon.  I believe his father was approached by his parishioners there, and that is how it began.  It is a good excuse for a feast day.”
“I want him gone, John. I won’t have him stealing your affections.”
“I doubt you wish to share yours.” His grin became self-deprecating. “You should hurry and change if you do not want to tempt your husband beyond what a mortal man can endure. It should not take me long to sneak to my room and get what I need for tonight and the morrow.”
John smiled when Sherlock put an arm around his shoulders as they laughed together over Molly’s story of her father’s nervousness in anticipation of the blessing of the fishing fleet. Last year, a storm had blown up just as he was being rowed out to the boats, and he had been swamped and had had to swim back to shore.
“Just like that.”
“If you will excuse me, I should tell Father all the details.”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” John replied, wishing he had thought to bring a thicker coat. Rain coursed down his neck, but he feared it was the least of his concerns when Sir Albert tightened his grip on his arm.  He kept his voice calm and his expression vexed.  No one must guess he was feeling anything but indignity at Sir Albert’s churlish actions.
As he came down the stairs, his spirits dragging, Greg stepped out of the parlor, his hands hidden behind him.  John tried to smile at him, but his attempt was a miserable failure.
“Turn left here.” Giving directions saved John from having to respond. Mr. Holmes spoke so well that he’d forgotten how different their circumstances were.  His petty worries about unwanted proposals and his sister’s ability to join the army seemed ridiculous when compared to Mr. Holmes struggle to keep himself fed by selling enough of his wares.
“No, let me finish.”  He lowered his voice. “You are a soldier, so you share Jay’s dream of a glorious victory for those you fight for.”
“She hasn’t done anything to stop her yet.” Sherlock smiled and reached for the plate of cakes. “Would you like one, John?”
You're a wonderful, beautiful, fantastic person. Thank you for everything you do!!
“All we need now is Harriet.” Aunt Hudson continued, setting herself on her feet and walking spryly to the door.
“Sherlock, if you are caught, you will not be sent back to prison. You will be hanged. If you are here when you are arrested, my father, sister, and cousin could be hanged, too.”  Tears glistened in his eyes as he whispered, “Go, before they hang you.”
When Sherlock walked away from him to peer out the window, John bit his lip. So many things he wanted to say, so much he wanted to ask. If he let even a single word past his lips, he would not be able to halt all of it from spilling out. He had already said too much, but he did not regret being honest. The truth had gnawed at him for too long.
“’Twas no trick, simply a good guess.” Sherlock came around the chair. “What I cannot guess is why your sister felt compelled to darken Sir Albert’s daylights.”
“You are
“You were not supposed to fall in love with me, John.” Sherlock sighed. “Nor I with you. When that happened, I knew I was caught in my own trap. The charade was becoming real. Since our marriage, I woke every night I was in this room and watched you sleeping all alone in your bed.”
He stepped closer, backing John further into the narrow space that was rumored to be a priest’s hole three hundred years ago. Mayhap it had been, because no one walking along the hall would see them until coming nearly upon them.
Sherlock reached for his pillow and fluffed it. “Be a good Omega and let me sleep.”
He was sadly mistaken to think he could find nothing new about John to draw his attention. When Sherlock saw him in a white jacket with a waistcoat only a shade darker than the midday sky drawing his gaze to his alluring curves, it was if he was seeing John for the first time. When he laughed again as he spoke with his father, the sound went right to Sherlock’s heart to swirl about him like the sweetest melody.
A rattle from the road pushed him from his thoughts and a small smile crossed his lips as he spied a peddler’s wagon through the trees.  It was rare for peddlers to choose to come this far from the main road.  Watson Hall estate was set back nearly a mile from the main road and few went out of their way to visit on the chance of a sale.
“I’m glad Father was sensible about that,” Harry announced, standing. “Sarah Sawyer has never said anything worth listening to.”
Mr. Holmes paused with one foot on the board of his wagon. “Is there something else you might be interested in, Mr. Watson?”
“And what is?”
When Sherlock’s arm curved around John’s shoulders, he drew away. He must not allow Sherlock to touch him. Not now… not when he needed to remain free of the fascinating tangle Sherlock created with his eager caresses.
“Master John?”
“Nor do I. Our lives may be a mull, but I would not trade a second of this jumble for anything when we can share this.” With a groan, Sherlock pulled John into his arms and captured his mouth with his own. John answered Sherlock’s longing with his own. When Sherlock released him so suddenly that he swayed back against the bed, John saw the glitter of craving in his eyes. Sherlock fingered the collar of the nightshirt in John’s arms with another gut-deep groan.
“I don’t think he is any longer.”
“That is Father’s concern, not yours.” John smiled at him. “You would be better concerned for what Father thinks of all your recent calls to Miss Donovan.”
Before Sherlock could reply, Harry snapped, “I know you despise the idea of me joining the army, John, but you do not need to disparage them like this.”
“I know this is a shock to you,” Greg said quietly.
Molly nodded. “Papa was going to go, but Mrs. James took ill and swore she was on her death bed.” She dimpled. “Again.”
“We will try to be,” John answered, hoping his reply sounded more assure to Father than it did to himself.
Eyes slit open as he tries to comprehend his surroundings.  His gaze darts frantically between the monitors above the bed, the medical equipment lining either side of the bed and the tops of the plain white walls. All that is visible from his position.
“Lies? You owned to taking Holmes as your lover.”
promised not to attempt to kiss you.”
“I thought you understood that was what that dolt Sebastian was babbling about.”
“Yes, you can.” John flung his hand out. “Just walk out the door and never come back. That will end this.”
“Sherlock, no!” John cried as his words cut through the haze of his distress. A flush climbed his ashen cheeks. Was Sherlock out of his mind? To give the lie even the least credence would destroy Sherlock.
“Yes?”
“I said I had no second thoughts about one. I know it is what we must do.” The back of Sherlock’s hand caressed John’s cheek. “There is no place in my life for you and certainly none in yours for me. The time you have to endure this should be short.”
“Harry, what - ?”
Mr. Jensen’s brown eyes twinkled. “Ah, I understand now. I have heard of the problems up at the baron’s house last night and of how a peddler came to your rescue.”
He scowled. “No.  Thank you.”
“Enough, LaVelle,” Sherlock ordered, his gaze not leaving John’s. “Join the other men.”
“Few of them walked the whole distance as you did.”
“‘Twas no bother. I wanted to be certain I could spend today with you.”
John was shocked when Mr. Holmes rested his left elbow on the arm of the chair and tipped John’s face toward his. “Your chin is scraped.”
John pulled back as he heard triumph in Sebastian’s voice. Had he spoken his thoughts aloud? Faith, he had not realized… Seeing his smile become a scowl, he said, “Sebastian, no! Sherlock is not my lover. I was – “
John sat by his bedroom window and watched the fog swirl as if being painted across the downs by a madman’s brush. From below, he heard the clang of the clock in the foyer. It was two hours past midnight. Father had assured him that Sherlock would be home before midnight. When Harry had come home, more than an hour ago, she had told him that Sherlock wanted to check the stables and should be in straightaway.
“Molly?” His voice cracked.
To make up for the long gap before the last chapter. A new one! Thank you to all who have commented on this story. I always appreciate hearing that you are enjoying it. Please feel free to point out any mistakes I may have missed.
John cried, “No, Sherlock! Are you insane?”
“I thought, in return, I would deliver this packet that he intended to bring you from London.”
The stone house was almost invisible, as gray as the sky. A broken plow was set next to a ragged stump. Two buckets, one of them missing slats, waited next to the well that was edged with moss. He ran to the front door as a double bolt of lightning lit up the sky.
He stood and wiped his hands, which had been resting on the stone wall. “Mayhap Mr. Jensen fell asleep,” Sherlock said, looking in the direction of the village, “and the prisoner took advantage of that.”
“That might help, especially if I am to stand beside you when you propose marriage to Miss Donovan.”
“Just bumped about.” John turned to refill the wine glass. “I’ve been hurt as badly racing Harry on horseback across a field.”
“Tell me that you abhor my embrace, and I will be glad to release you and never touch you again. Tell me, but tell me truthfully.”
Sherlock’s grin sent something delightful thought John’s heart. “It is not meet that a peddler should ask a baron’s son to run errands for him.”
“She has been speaking to you of me?”
“When are you leaving?” John glanced at the wagon. Sherlock’s explanation was reasonable, but his reaction had not been. This must have to do with the secret he never divulged. He wished he could figure out what it was.
A slow smile spread across the soldier’s full lips. Catching John’s chin in his palm, he forced his head up. Horror burned through him as he saw the obvious lust in his gaze as it slipped over him.
Sherlock lowered his eyes quickly when John mentioned London, and John wondered what Sherlock was trying to conceal. He would not ask, not when the others were gathered here to speak of the beating of the bounds.
As Father lead him toward the altar, everyone rose from the stone pews and turned to watch. He ignored the temptation to laugh when he realized how different this was from what he’d imagined as a child. His dreams of being a soldier well and truly shattered, though he’d always known it wouldn’t happen. As he looked from his father to his sister and cousin now seated in the foremost pew next to Aunt Hudson, a beatific smile on her face as if she had arranged the whole of this, then on to the gently smiling face of the minister, he wanted to apologize for snaring them in this web of delusion.
“Where is Holmes?”
Harry laughed, “I don’t make the same mistakes twice.  I make new ones.”
“There is no time. We must leave now.”
He lowered his voice so no one might hear it but Harry. “Did Sir Albert see that it was you who hit him?”
John clenched his fists, tempted to strike at the man. He was impossible as Sebastian.
Father glanced at John and smiled an apology. He wanted to smile back, but he could not while the Morans infested their home.
Instead, he looked at his father. John’s eyes widened when he realized his father was dressed in his very best dark coat and pale breeches. When he held his arm out to John, John’s fingers trembled when he put them on his father’s sleeve. He put a hand over John’s and patted it as he had when John was a child and in need of comfort.
“Bastard!” Sir Albert cradled his wrist as he glared at Sherlock. “I shall break you in half!”
“Then he is Huillet!” Sir Albert snarled.
“And, John?” Her smile broadened. “I would stay far from your father’s office. He has a caller.”
“Yes. You know him?”
John faced him, astonished that Sherlock still spoke French. “Why should I believe that?” He kept his chin high, so the tears flooding his eyes could not overflow.
“So I shall not attempt it.  I shall do it.”
“That was managed while you were enjoying the beating of the bounds. Harry thought I was walking with you while I went into the village to oversee that. I was on my way back when I chanced to see you going into the woods.”
The musicians, two fiddlers and a drummer from the village, called for a break.  Auntie smiled as John sat on the ground beside her chair.
“People will choose to believe what they wish, no matter what any of us do. I truly think Sebastian has come to believe his absurd assumptions.”
Sherlock put his hand over John’s, out of view of the others. “When an Alpha wants something so much, no one can talk them out of it.”
Tears jeweled in John’s eyes, and Sherlock cursed the circumstances that brought them to this.  Sherlock started to speak, but John turned away to take the cloth off the top of the food basket.
“Are you going to hold that over me for the rest of our lives?” John tried to squirm away, but Sherlock’s arms tightened around him, holding him close. That he wanted to soften against him and savor Sherlock’s touch vexed him even more. “I have told you more than once that Sebastian was the one who named you as my lover. Maybe you should go and inflict your company on him.”
"Sherlock,  I need you to calm down love. Look at me." John's face appears in the space above Sherlock's head.
“Thought you might.” She grinned and John flashed back to her face as a child. “Don’t delay. I don’t want you married to Sebastian Moran either.”
“Even if you made me your messenger?”
“I understand what you are.”
“And don’t forget to remind Cook that Mr. Holmes will be coming to the kitchen for his dinner.”
John had been about to ask his father about the patrols, but Sherlock’s answer silenced him. He was enjoying this hoax far too much. Yet, if he denounced Sherlock, he would have to own that Sherlock intended to annul their marriage. John was not sure what his father might insist upon them. He could not believe that Father might wed him to Sebastian, but everything seemed so peculiar.
He shivered, although the sun was warm. “I don’t want to talk about that.”
When Greg smiled, John stared at Andrew Donovan, who was signaling to the other men. He no longer resembled his quiet, kindly neighbor who kept so much to himself, for he carried two pistols, both of them aimed at Sir Albert.
“About me and Sherlock?” Good heavens, could Auntie know the truth? So little that happened around the village failed to reach Auntie, but this… “What do you mean?”
He brushed a twig from John’s hair. “I need not, for the sight of you so obviously disheveled would persuade any man with a bit of a brain in his head to realize you did not speak of your own volition the words that would ruin both of us.”
“Did anyone else see me?”
“What do you mean?”
“Your father needs to put an end to those smugglers.” Molly scowled. “If they become any bolder, they’re going to be asking to be appointed to the village council.”
The officer smiled, the dark eyes above his gaunt cheeks narrowing. John stiffened his back knowing how useless his cries for mercy would be. Even if he shouted, he could not depend on Mr. Anderson to come to his aid. The other man’s fingers opened and closed on his gun as if he were trying to decide what order to give.
“About your wedding?”
“Sir Albert?”
“How did it happen?” John asked.
He wanted to curse Sir Albert’s ability to find his weakest point with such ease. Instead he smiled. “Father has spoken frequently today of how he looked forward to acquainting his new son-in-law with Watson Hall’s neighbors.”  When his smile became a scowl, John hoped he had not pushed Moran too far. He should be more careful than he had been with Sebastian. “You can find them inside.”
John slid out from under him to see his right arm had disappeared under the wagon. He crawled past Mr. Holmes and pushed against the wagon.
John looked around. Where was Sherlock? He had been here only moments ago. Trying to keep his sigh silent, he guessed Sherlock had left while John was greeting Molly. “I am sure you will have a chance to see him somewhere along the bounds this morning.”
Sherlock edged back into the shadows. He had thought Lord Watson was not considering Sebastian Moran’s suit, but it appeared that he was. Perhaps the baron had not noticed how his son cringed when Moran was present.
“Yes, maybe I am, but I know for sure you are in my heart.”
“I’d like to speak with you, John.”
He shook away thoughts of the Moran family again.  The only good thing about learning of Harry’s plans was that it had taken his mind off of Sir Albert’s plans to match his son with John.  Sir Albert had recently called on Father in order to present his arguments, yet again, for how this engagement would benefit both families.  Father had yet to make a decision and John was content to let it lie as long as possible.
The morning mist refused to acknowledge the sunrise. Gray twilight clung to the ground, leaving everything damp and chilled, even though the sun had come up out of the sea more than an hour ago.
“When will you be leaving, Holmes?”
Going to the edge of the tiny garden, John looked at the high hedge that separated it from the rest of the gardens. He sighed. Sherlock was not here. He had no choice but to go back inside and pretend nothing was amiss. It might be simpler if he knew whether something truly was amiss.
“He does not want me to make the same mistake you and Sherlock have.” Her brows lowered, giving her the appearance of their father, a resemblance he had never seen till now. “But I am not sure he believes your story, John. I’m not sure I do either.”
“When your face was bruised?”
“Good day, sir.”
Mrs. Carson was waiting at the bottom of the stairs, John appreciated the housekeeper’s attempt to smile more than he could say. When Mrs. Carson pinned several flowers to his lapel, she said, “An Omega should have flowers.”
“Of course.” Mrs. Carson smiled a greeting as she passed the cousins coming in the door. “Hush now, you two. You know his lordship likes the house quiet in the hour after tea.”
Sherlock reached under his waistcoat and drew out the weapon. Balancing it for a moment on his palm, he berated himself for his carelessness. He had not thought that this new life would come at the cost of a remnant of his past. Silently, he set the pistol in front of the baron.
“I am not sure yet,” he replied. “Lord Watson tells me there have been few traveling merchants around this village.”
“Not that I was aware of. If you think differently, will you enlighten me?” His hand shifted on the back of the seat, so the tips of his fingers covered John’s.
John’s face flushed as he touched his left cheek. That morning he had discovered it had become a rich tapestry of colors. “It’s nothing, I bumped it.”
“There are refreshments for everyone in the morning room.” Aunt Hudson waved all the witnesses, shooing them out of the chapel like a farm Omega shooing their chickens.
“I am not frightened of Sebastian.”
of this was a good idea, he added silently, though he was grateful for the excuse not to be hauled through the door as if he couldn’t walk himself. He went into the bedchamber that was exactly as he’d left it hours before, save for the thin nightshirt waiting on the bed. He flinched when Sherlock closed the door behind him and sat on the bed as he slipped off his coat.
“I may when I can.” He slapped the reins against the back of the horse and smiled again. “Wheelwrights are expensive, however, and I prefer to feed myself and my horse.”
Lady Hudson held out her vein-lined hand. “I am Martha Hudson, young man. You will call me Auntie, as the others do.  Do I make myself clear?”
His lungs fill with oxygen and for the first time he registers the plastic tube invading his mouth and throat. He gags and tries to reach for the tube.
“That language is unnecessary.”
“Even his father?”
“No?” Sherlock repeated with an arching of his eyebrows? His expression bespoke his disbelief louder than a single word.
“I told you. You are welcome to stay without-“
“I said be silent.”
“Good afternoon.” Father’s words were spoken without emotion. “You may rest assured that, once this wedding is completed, I shall discuss with your father my opinions of your obvious treatment of John.”
“No.” John smiled and he handed it back. “You’ll have to find another to buy it, sir.”
John put his fingers over Sherlock’s on his cheek. Just touching him gave him strength. “Please do not speak so.”
“I am certain you will find your differences matter little when you are together again.”
“You have betrayed us for the final time.”  He glanced at Greg.  “You are unhurt, my friend?”
would do.
Pushing his soaked hair out of his eyes, he hurried around to the back of the house. He would not stand in the rain while waiting for Mr. Anderson to shake off his blue ruin fog. He would wait out the storm in his barn.
“Be silent, whore!” Taking his arm again, Sebastian steered him toward the house.
“Don’t, Sebastian.” John stepped away. When he saw Sebastian’s face grow taut with fury, he backed even farther away.
“He does not seem to believe that. He scurries away like a guilty child whenever your name is mentioned.”
John shook his head.
(See the end of the chapter for
John frowned as he woke to find his blankets wrapped tightly around him. He did not recall when he had fallen asleep, but he had been deep in a dream. In it, he had been with Sherlock. His kisses, bestowed among the dappled shadows by the shore, had sent pulses of delight through him.
“Then why did you bring him to see your father?”
He had not gone to look Sherlock in the card room off a back passage, away from where the more sedate entertainments were being held. The Alphas played for high stakes, and he had not suspected that Sherlock would be able to afford to play in such company.
“What?” He pressed his lips closed to contain his laughter when he saw Sebastian’s rage. “Sebastian, he cannot drive his wagon with his shoulder wrenched as it is.”
“Because you no longer love me?”
“You were an idiot to think you could catch a wagon.”
Sherlock cleared his throat before saying, “My lady, this sounds like a matter of interest to your family. I would be glad to leave.”
John breathed shallowly as Greg and Harry joined the others and propped their shoulders against the wagon. Veins popped along Greg’s forehead as he pushed. When the wagon was raised off the ground they shoved it aside.
He frowned. “Are you skulking away from someone?” He held up his hands. “No, let me guess. Did you encounter the inimitable Sebastian Moran?”
As he entered the small room that was so well lit the gold stripes threatened to leap off the wall covering, he listened to his father give quiet orders. He clasped his hands behind him as he heard him send several men to make sure the smugglers had left the lands of Watson Hall.
“I miss my husband.”
“I thought it might.” He gave John an indulgent smile as Sherlock took his hand and drew it within his arm. “We can speak more later, Sherlock.”
“That is too bad.” Mr. Holmes sighed and leaned his elbow on the top of the wagon. “I had hoped you would take it in trade for a night’s shelter and food for me and my horse.”  He patted the brown haunches of his horse. “We’ve traveled many miles today.”
The cider splashed into his goblet as conversations resumed. Hearing Harry jesting with Greg, John tried to smile. He had almost succeeded when loud footsteps sounded on the floor beyond the morning room.
Although John wanted to fight him, he told himself to be calm. Sebastian was furious, and John must take care that he did not rouse his temper, for it was clearly as vicious as his father’s. “Sebastian, you are mistaken. Think what you are doing. Let me up.”
He feared Sebastian would not release him, but slowly his fingers unwound from John’s wrist. He strode to the door and, not even waiting for the footman, opened it and then slammed it behind him.
Quickly he discovered that the pattern of the dance was a parody of their lives. Each time he neared John and it seemed Sherlock was about to take his hand as he swirled him through the next steps, others came between them, sending them apart once more. He was careful to keep a smile on his face because Lady Hudson was not the only one watching him closely.
Now that Auntie had arrived, the beating of the bounds could begin. In short order, Harry led the way out of the gate, as if she were the baron, instead of younger child.
“When?”
John frowned, “You said you brought the packet from London for Mr. Jensen.”
Knowing he was bold, but knowing as well that the situation was beyond the canons of propriety, he murmured, “Sherlock? Can you hear me? Are you hurt?”
Sherlock’s finger under John’s chin tilted his face toward him. “I know I should tell you that I am sorry, but I will not be dishonest with you when you know how glad I am that we can share this.”
"Fuck you very much Sherlock! How am I supposed to go I to the surgery looking like a tropical fish?"
“Have you misplaced your mate already, brother?” Harry crowed, warning him that he had hurried headlong into the room without considering the consequences… yet again.
“A peddler.”
“That is true, but I shall not be hurried into this. Nor shall I hurry John. Another fortnight shall not matter.”
John tried to read, but the words blurred in front of his tired eyes. Even his favorite book, which had comforted him during his papa’s illness, offered no respite from the worry.
“Good afternoon, Mr. Watson.” Mr. Jensen looked up from the packet to add, “And thank your peddler for me.”
“That she wants to go and fight.” John blinked back the tears of frustration that came too easily when he thought of Harry going off to fight. He wouldn’t let Sherlock see his tears. John’s jealousy weighed on him, threatening to choke him with its strength. His fear for Harry was real, there was no question of that. And that he would have been in the same danger, had he been given the chance to go, had not been forgotten. When he acknowledged the jealousy, the guilt ate at him. Guilt for wanting to hold Harry back and keep her safe, while wanting nothing more than to leave to fight for her same cause. “She’s a dreamer of she thinks Father will purchase her a commission.”
“Sorry,” he murmured. “Blasted arm.”
“Shall we find a good place to watch the blessing of the fleet?” asked Greg.
“You are right to try and talk her out of enlisting.”
“No! Sebastian, there is – “
“That you truly prefer a Moran to a penniless peddler.” He gripped John’s chin, pushing his face back so his mouth was beneath his.
They shook him viciously and a hand closed around his throat. His eyes blurred, but he heard a shout from the house. He wanted to yell again, but no sound emerged from his throat as he fought for consciousness. Another shout came from the stables, but he couldn’t understand the words through his ringing ears. His captor pushed him away. He struck the wagon and fell to his knees, half blind with the pain along his ribs.
“And?”
“I know a peddler is supposed to hear songs of the road in the rolling of his wagon wheels, but I am afraid I only hear the passage of miles.”
“Why are you lathering me with this falsehood?” Her face fell into a frown. “I thought you a better man than that.”
“Good morning, Sherlock.” John said, his voice quivering. He could not halt his hand from reaching up to brush Sherlock’s freshly shaven cheek.
“You said nothing last night.”
“I do,” his father said.
Sebastian’s name was shouted again from the top of the hill. A man was gesturing to him. When John squinted and put his hand to his forehead to shade his eyes, he still was unsure who stood up there. He could not imagine who wanted to see Sebastian, but John was grateful that he was called away. Nodding in response to his mumbled excuse, John released the sigh he had been holding.
“You are in excellent spirits,” John said, startled by how easily Sherlock accepted that he no longer wished to speak about the previous subject.
Greg gulped so loudly John was afraid he’d swallowed his tongue. Again Greg stood and went to the window. Dropping to the window seat, he glowered at his hands, which he locked together between his knees.
He would rather be anywhere but here at this gathering tonight, however, Greg had told his friends that the whole family would be in attendance. He had considered begging off, saying he did not feel well. That would only create talk that he was with child and start more rumors about why he had wed Sherlock.
John laughed, so Moran could not suspect the depths of his distaste. Then, Sir Albert would press his attack. “You should not listen to the lies spread about the village.”
“But?”
John was surprised to wake up alone in the morning. He had not thought he’d slept, but apparently he’d fallen asleep long enough for Sherlock to slip out of the room. After ringing for Elsa, he was as silent as his maid while he dressed. He saw Elsa glance at the chaise longue on which a folded blanket and pillow were neatly stacked. Still, he said nothing. There had been enough lies in this house, but he could not speak the truth. He could not be sure why. He only knew his heart ached within him like a broken-winged bird’s.
“I believe that is what he said.” John set the packet on the counter. Curiosity taunted him. On his other visits here with Father, Mr. Jensen had been effusive and jolly, not alternately smiling and frowning. Since Sherlock’s arrival, no one acted as they customarily did… except Sebastian. John did not want to think of him and his assumption that John would not only mate with him but would be honored to do so.
“He shall not hurt you again, sweetheart.”
“Some folks don’t trust the government to take care of things for them, so they decide to take care of them themselves.”
John wanted to answer, but sighed as the tip of Sherlock’s tongue outlined his mouth which hungered for his kisses. He wove his fingers through Sherlock’s curls, drawing his mouth over his. Their breaths mingled as Sherlock’s tongue sought to explore every luscious secret in John’s mouth.
Sherlock sucked in a deep breath, wondering how long it had been since he last remembered to breathe. His feet wanted to send him lurching toward John, but he turned and walked toward the back of the grand room. When his name was called, he struggled to smile.
Fingering the fine hair behind John’s ear, he teased the crescent. As John shivered with the power of his heated breath, he pressed closer.
“So you headed for home?”
“I had a few other places to check, as William had requested.”
“Harry!” Greg hissed. “Hush!”
“No wonder everyone expects an announcement.” Sherlock’s voice was laced with laughter as he walked with John along the hall toward the rear of the house. “He acts like the bridegroom who is eager to get through the ceremony to have his wedding night with his mate.”
“I did the flower no favor.”
The shadowed man was framed by the window. Slipping from his bed, he inched across the room until he could grasp the poker from next to the banked hearth.  It was a poor weapon, but he would not let the French blackguard into his room. His breath plugged his throat. What remained in his chest burned but he did not release it.
He went out to the terrace and stared up at the stars shimmering in the distance. Water burbled in the background of the nearby rose garden.
“Not from you!” John pushed him away. Scrambling to his feet, he glowered at Sebastian when he caught his arm again. “Shall we see what
John scowled. The man now sounded more like the Moran’s. John was well within hearing range of the men working the fields across the road and he could certainly look after himself. He wasn’t feeble and was smart enough to know not to go out at night.
“You do look like a shab-rag among these fine peacocks.” She tapped his arm with her feathered fan. “You are excused while you change into something more appropriate.”
Sherlock smiled as Sir Albert came at him. At the last second he stepped aside and put his foot out to trip Sir Albert, who fell against the table with a crash. The wedding cake teetered. The top two layers tumbled to the floor, one striking Sir Albert on the head. With a laugh, Sherlock took the cider and poured it over his head.
Choosing not to answer, he looked into the wagon instead.  His eyes widened at the collection of items inside. It was a jumble of small wonders. Books slouched to one side propped up by, wait, was that a skull? A box of dishes sat nestled in the corner, draped with light blue fabric.
“I shall endeavor, my lady, not to lead you into less than exemplary behavior.”
“Now that’s most peculiar.” Sherlock said quietly.
“Forget it? How – ?”
As close as they were standing, John was unsure if the shivers were only his or if Sherlock’s desire was as uncontrollable. He should push him away, but John slid his hands along the strong muscles of Sherlock’s arms.
Affixing a smile in place that was the twin of Sherlock’s, John said, “Then I shall have to make certain you wait no longer.” He went to the table, hoping to appear nonchalant.
John answered when required as Reverend Hooper read the marriage rite. He kept his gaze in the center of his surplice until he asked, “Who gives this Omega in marriage.”
He put a hand on the side of the seat to climb back aboard. “Thank you, Mr. Watson. If you could step back, I would hate for you to chance getting hurt.”
“Don’t ask about things that are none of your business.”
“But why do you need to meet her? Doesn’t she own a carriage?”
“Who else?”
Sherlock laughed, but Lady Hudson slapped him again on the arm with her fan.
Nodding, he obeyed. His aunt patted his knee, out of sight of the others, in a motion so kind that John feared the gathering tears would not stay in his eyes.
Her nose wrinkled as she stared at his rumpled shirt and waistcoat and breeches, all of which showed the wear from his journey about the bounds. “We must rectify that with all due haste.”
John shook his head. “I didn’t see his carriage. Mayhap he was not going home.”
Even though he wanted to linger, he said, “Thank you for the flower and the compliment, Sherlock.”
John glanced at Sherlock. To hear the pastor speak of love with such ease unsettled him. He wanted to shout that he was not in love with Sherlock, but he remained silent. Auntie was right. Sherlock was right. It was too late for the truth. It was too late for anything but marrying a man he barely knew to begin a new life he could not imagine.
“Yes.” John looked toward the stable where the wagon overturned.
He took a shuddering breath.  The tall man was not a stranger. Sebastian Moran would be known anywhere by his ginger hackles. Even from a distance and despite that red hair, he was undeniably handsome, his chiseled features as strong as his massive shoulders. He dressed, as always, in prime twig, a reminder to everyone that he was the one and only son of Sir Albert Moran.
He rubbed a green hand through pink hair.
“Convenience?” John gasped. “A marriage of
Sherlock shook his head. “Not for sure, but I have ordered my men to alert me to anything they might learn. What they haven’t been able to discover is who is giving the smugglers these orders. I have urged caution because I do not want to lose the alliance with the smugglers.”
John wanted to agree with him fervently, but Greg gave him no chance as he slapped the side of the carriage to let the coachman know they were ready to go.  As the carriage bounced out onto the road in front of the manor house, John clenched his hands in his lap. So many questions he wanted to ask. Some Greg could answer. Even more, he could not.
He wished it were possible to close thoughts out of his mind as readily. On the way down the hill to the village, which clung to the strand, his conversation with Sherlock played through his head. John was not in favor of negotiating with the French for peace, but, somehow, he had found himself arguing for that. What a bothersome man Sherlock was! If John did not owe him the duty of being kind to Sherlock after he saved John from the smugglers, he would have been tempted to cut him direct.
John sank onto a stone bench, only to immediately come back to his feet. His disquiet would not let him sit and think. He wandered off the terrace and into the gardens. When he saw the carriages awaiting Father’s guests, he turned and walked in the other direction. Hopefully by the time he lapped the house they would be gone. If he walked three times around the house, would the fairies come and spirit them away?
John exchanged another glance with his friend. Molly's eyes were wide with a dismay that echoed the feeling that raced through John. “Why?” He asked again.
“I shall not be dishonest with you, sweetheart. You did point me to a possible rendezvous spot, and I did wake up, night after night, to meet with my men and their allies, the smugglers. But, night after night, I delayed a few minutes longer in going to a meeting because I was caught up in the splendor of the moonlight illuminating your face as you slept. I ached to remain here with you, to wake you up with my kisses, to make you my mate in truth. Yet to seduce you and leave you was too cruel even for me, so I knew I must keep to my original plan to arrange an annulment.”
This time, he could not conceal his reaction.  When he drew in a frantic breath, he knew Greg had seen the truth on his face as well.  He never had learned to think before he acted. He should have been prepared for this question, instead of lamenting how far Sherlock was from his arms.
John guessed that he and Molly were somewhere nearer to the leaders than those who had dropped their pace to a stroll, because they matched their steps to the pace of Molly’s words, which showed no sign of slowing down until he had chanced to mention Greg.
Sherlock sent another glower in John's direction and pushed against the bath to stand.
“But that is treason!”
“Is it only your right arm that’s injured?” John asked.
John smiled. “Mayhap, but that will not be announced tonight.”
“Because you love me, John.”
“Your father would not be pleased if he were not.”
John could not believe what Sebastian was doing when he pushed him toward the ground. He was not a prostitute to be treated like this! John fought him, but Sebastian bore down on him until his knees buckled beneath him.
“Or if?”
“We simply had a conversation,” replied Lord Watson with quiet dignity. “Nothing was decided about a betrothal announcement.”
The carriage rocked to a stop so sharply that John was almost thrown into his cousin’s lap.  He nodded when Greg asked if he was alright. That was not that truth, because he had banged his shoulder into the side of the carriage. It ached, and hot pulses jolted his arm like bolts of lightning.
Rehanging the poker next to the fireplace, he grinned. “I thought you would be asleep at this hour, John.”
The cake fell from his fingers, forgotten, as he drew John to him. When John’s hands slipped along him, pressing him to Sherlock, Sherlock knew he had found where he wanted to be.
“Is it more than a rumor?” John asked, hoping Molly would put his mind to rest.
"Just like that! Sher... Please! Harder!"
“Thank you,” he whispered.
has once again been my saving grace.  Lending me motivation on my own work while I dither on editing hers.
“I - I -“ John didn’t know what he wanted to say, but he was certain that he wanted to deny Sherlock’s words. Sir Albert had asked for his hand? He didn’t understand. Sebastian had told him years ago that they would be mated when they were both of age. Or did he? Had Sebastian said instead that John would be living in Sir Albert’s magnificent house when he was grown?
As John’s head turned toward him, Sherlock would have sworn someone had crept up behind him and forced the very breath out of him. He could barely think as he was enveloped in John’s soft gaze. The thought that filtered into his mind was of watching those eyes close as he offered up his lips to him. How much more he wanted now!
“You have my word as a peddler,” Sherlock answered quietly.
“Sherlock, are you going to confront him?”
Sherlock’s arms surrounded John as he silenced him with a kiss. Drawing him close, he refused to let him free himself.  John fought the deluding snares of passion but found he needed their love to erase the fear. He held tightly to Sherlock, wanting the forgetfulness which came at the apex of ecstasy.
He grasped John’s wrist. “Answer my question!”
“If you are weaving a tale for me, in hopes of increasing the price of this pistol, you need not. Give me the truth, man, so we might begin this bargaining in honesty.”
A clock rang from somewhere in the house. “I fear I shall be late, because I must give my friend Molly a look-in before I meet the mail coach at the inn, so I must ask you to excuse me.”
“I was in Dover not more than a week ago.” he replied.
“Then you are most likely the only one.” He patted his friend’s hand.
He could not recall the last time he’d met a man who was unfailing in his loyalty and put country above the profit he could gain by collaborating with the English owls busy plying the Channel with their cargoes of brandy and silk. Sherlock had to own to being curious as to why this baron resisted that temptation. He was as curious about Lord Watson as Mr. Watson had been about himself. He would have to guard himself closely around Mr. Watson, for he had already proven that he had a more insightful nature than would be good for everything Sherlock had planned.
“Do you know this Omega, Captain Huillet?” asked the man who had captured him, “He must be a spy.”
. She puts up with all my personal drama while directing me in how to not make stupid mistakes, and above all, is always a kind and supportive friend.
“That she wants to punch Boney?”
“I would like you there when I speak today with Miss Donovan.”
John raised a trembling finger and pointed to the door. “Father asked you to leave. If he has to ask you again, I swear I shall get his shotgun and pepper your breeches with buckshot.” When a cautioning hand settled on his arm, he stepped closer to Sherlock.
He rested his head on Sherlock’s shoulder as Reverend Hooper walked out onto the pier.  The fishermen, including several he had heard his father deride as smugglers, stood on the decks of their ships that bounced lightly on the choppy waves. Nothing was a simple as he wanted to believe. Mayhap it never had been.
The rather sour faced brunette facing Greg must be Miss Donovan, Sherlock decided. No one had a chance to introduce him to her, as the orchestra began to play the music for the first dance.
“Nonsense.”  She stretched forward to pat his right arm as if he were no older than Harry. “You shall still be with us by then, and you may be necessary to help me convince William that simply because Napoleon is being so beastly is no reason to cancel the beating of the bounds. It is too important to the shire to let a year pass without it. In addition, all the invitations to the ball that evening have gone out.”
“May I introduce my husband, Sherlock Holmes?” John smiled.
Ignoring their previous conversation, Sebastian said to John, “Of course, I came to the beating of the bounds. It is important that the ton recall their duties.”
Sherlock chuckled under his breath. “He seems to be suffering seriously from a case of unrequited love.”
“John,” Sherlock murmured, using his given name with an ease that suggested he used it often, “you need have no fear that you have told me something that will undermine your father’s efforts to protect his family and village. I have traveled far through England, and I have seen similar preparations in every coastal town that faces the continent. It would be more of a surprise if he were not so vigilant.”
With another curse, Sir Albert stormed to the door. He motioned for his son to follow.
His kiss was gentle, asking John to give him only what he wanted to. John wanted to give him everything. He pulled back with a gasp, frightened by his own cravings to make this marriage more than a sham built on lies.
?” Sebastian’s narrow eyes glowed with hatred.
“Call me Sherlock.”
John handed a footman his hat and cloak, then slipped his hand onto Sherlock’s arm again. He had not been in the home since the new black walnut paneling was added to the staircase that rose to separate in two directions to reach both wings of the house. A parade of portraits of Donovans, both past and present, followed the curve of the banister, but John did not notice them as he saw how many eyes were focused on him and Sherlock.
The fresh air was almost as intoxicating as John’s kisses. With a curse, he sat on a bench at the far end of the terrace. He gazed up at the moon that was draped with the last wisps of the lingering mist. How many nights had he spent outside or in some rough byre staring up at this moon and watching the stars pop out in the vast arc of the sky? How many more would he do that?
“As I do, but you must have heard the rumor that a boatload of the accursed Frogs was seen just off the spit.”
“Did you think I would?” John whispered when Sherlock pressed his cheek to his.
“How?”
He had thought he had given up any illusions of being a gentleman, but here he was ready to leap to John’s defense again. Hadn’t he learned anything after last night? The pain from his arm should keep his head clear, but he seemed to be having trouble thinking clearly about John because images of his beguiling smile muddled up his mind.
“The only invasion that matters to me right now is how you invaded my heart.”  Sherlock leaned him back against his arm.
“Because it was only yesterday that I had that conversation with him.  I told him the truth – that they were mine and I did not want to part with them.”
“To do some practice shooting, so I’ll be ready.” She pulled a gun from beneath her riding coat.
“He must if the smugglers come back!” John retorted.
“And mine. Thank you for saving me.”
“To give them a bit of privacy in this crowd,” he murmured as they walked along the street toward the strand.  “Courting requires it, you know.”
John’s head snapped up as he heard Sherlock’s endearment. Then his relief vanished. What had he brought with his attempt to escape Sebastian’s heavy-handed seduction? He might have been enthralled by Sherlock’s tempting kisses, and he might have dreamed of his touch, but he knew nothing of him. No, he knew Sherlock was keeping secrets behind his charming smile.
“If all goes as I hope, we may have other times.”
“Mayhap you should go to Town with Sebastian. You could use those flowery phrases to thrill the Omegas.”
Sir Albert swore. “John was supposed to be a Moran. The people of the village will learn about this faithless whore!”
Sebastian scowled. “I thought I had the right to say what I wished. After all -”
for always being there.
John halted his efforts to escape, staring up at him. “Sir Albert? Mon-” He bit back the French oath. “Are you out of your mind? You should not heed silly gossip.”
“Did they recapture the French prisoner?” he asked.
“I suspect you are right.”
As Sir Albert raised a finger to point at Lord Watson, the baronet said, “We had a gentleman’s agreement, William.”
“I wasn’t sure last night. Your father’s men got my wagon’s brake put back together just this morning.” He patted the side of the wagon. “It is better than new.”
John saw the glitter in his eyes. He’d been a widgeon to own that he was alone. He tried to shrug, but his rigid shoulders refused to move. “I came out here to let Greg know Miss Donovan is looking for him.” He lied, for he had no idea where his cousin was. “Father has not wished me to be by myself – “
Or had he reddened? When his fingers played along John’s arm, the sweet blaze raged within him.
“Have you heard, John?” Molly rushed up to John as soon as he entered the parsonage to leave his family’s three baskets of food with the others brought for the outing after the blessing of the fishing fleet.
He took another step back. “Why? Why do you want to marry me? You told me you were eager to leave, that you could not wait to continue your travels.”
“Mr. Watson?” He asked.
“Yet you fight.”
John took the package which could not hold more than a sheet or two. “Is that what you and Harry were talking about?”
“I thought you might like this.”
Something warned John that he was no longer alone.  More than once, he suffered uneasiness while walking in the garden this afternoon as he waited for the time to meet Aunt Hudson in town. He suspected it to be no more than his imagination being fired by the smugglers’ attack last night. John hadn’t expected them to be so brazen. If he had not chanced by, Mr. Holmes’ wagon would be stripped clean… and Mr. Holmes would be gone.
John glanced from one to the other, then left the sitting room. Damn! Sebastian Moran might not be as loathsome as his father, but he did not in any way want to marry him. He disliked the lascivious stares and coarse jests, which were more appropriate for a pub of rowdy Alpha’s than for an Omega of good stock. Worst though, were the rumors of the part Sebastian had played in the capture of a smuggler who had been betrayed by his own men and sent to hang. Word was, Sebastian Moran had given his name to the authorities in order to gain control of the smugglers and a share of their profits.
His hand on John’s arm warned him that Sherlock refused to be overlooked. He brought John to face him and said softly, “John Holmes. An Omega is something I did not expected to find when I offered you a tin of tea in exchange for a night’s lodging for me and my horse.”
“I did not go far. Your younger sister is not adept at keeping a somber expression while playing a prank.”
“Be silent!” roared Sir Albert.
“Maybe.”
Whirling to see that Sherlock had not moved, John said, “Now that sounds like treason.”
“To hell with my language!” His fingers tightened on John’s arm as he tried to back away. “If you wish me to be courteous, then give me the courtesy of an answer.”
He would have refused. Then John would not have had to suffer his pawing and been so stupid as to speak Sherlock’s name. Then he would not have had to see horror on Father’s face and listen to Sherlock calmly owning how he let passion for John overmaster his good sense.
is not,” the baronet said with a laugh. “But the question is how much he knows about the man who is”
“As do I.”  Sherlock drew a piece of cake out of the basket.  “I wasted that evening I could have spent with you, being miserable because I didn’t want to be falling in love with you.”
?” Molly laughed. “Are you about to journey to London for a Season, Sebastian? Mayhap you can find a destitute duke's Omega who is desperate to marry you.”
“You won’t.”
It has been signed “With love, Sherlock.” No clue to where he was bound or what he must do.  As the days folded one into the next, he had become more anxious with each passing hour.  John did not want to think of what he would do if the week passed and Sherlock still had not returned.  John’s tale that Sherlock had a final delivery to make before he could give up his life as a peddler had brought puzzled glances from his family, but John had not elaborated, fearful that his lies would tumble apart like a stack of child’s blocks.
Sherlock put his arm around John. When John stepped farther within that haven, Sherlock smiled. “Our wedding. John is now my mate.”
Sherlock reached the door in time to see a grand carriage being whipped up. He hoped the coachman was skilled, for a single chuckhole could upend a carriage going at that speed. When it disappeared past the gate, he walked in the opposite direction.
Sherlock enfolded John to him as his lips found his again. Everything he wanted was in Sherlock’s kiss, for it offered him as much rapture as it demanded. His fingers stroked John’s back, sending tingles twisting along his spine. As John’s hand curved along his nape, Sherlock’s thick hair caressed it.
Sherlock came to his feet with care, John noted. Did his head still right with the concussion of the accident, as John’s did if he moved too swiftly? Reaching under his waistcoat, Sherlock pulled out a package wrapped in brown paper. “I was supposed to deliver this to him when I reached the village. I have had it with me since I last left London, so there is no hurry.” He gave John a wry smile. “On the other hand, I have been carrying it about for some time now, so he might be waiting for it.”
“You have a choice.”
When John glanced behind them and saw no one, Sherlock chuckled. “I did not kiss you to create a public spectacle.”
“Don’t say anything,” Sherlock hissed under his breath.
Sherlock had sent him a single message.  Although he was not certain how he had managed to sneak it under John’s pillow without being seen, he was glad he had found it before Elsa had.  He doubted if his maid would have been able to restrain her curiosity.
Hey look!  Two in a row.  Only one left. Unbetad so again, all mistakes are mine.  Feel free to point out glaring ones.
When he took John’s hands, John moaned. The ripple of rapture sweeping along his skin told him that his eyes had not been deceived. This Alpha who wore the elegant French lancer’s uniform was Sherlock Holmes, his husband, the man who held John’s heart. He could not mistake Sherlock’s beguiling touch for any other’s, for his fingers knew the warmth of Sherlock’s.
“No!” Ice dropped to the very center of John’s heart. “When?”
“Your aunt mentioned Moran’s malady.”
“You had best accustom yourself to stares,” John said, tugging at his waistcoat as he climbed the stairs with Sherlock. “You shall endure many tonight.”
“But it’s never been used.”
“John,” his father said quietly. “It is time.”
But he would do something, because if he, as an Omega, couldn’t go, he definitely wasn’t going to send his 17 year old sister off to die.
Mr. Holmes took the pistol from him and returned it to its case. “No, Mr. Watson. I will not trade you that.”
John sighed. The smugglers had never been so daring. Father had vowed to search every outbuilding on Watson Hall property and urged his neighbors to do the same. Most would. As for Sir Albert, John was not sure what he would do, for he was even more incomprehensible than Greg.
“You may take this any way you wish. I would have chosen any man over Sebastian.” John smiled again.
“It shall be a long time before I again have the opportunity to attend a ball at a baron’s country seat.” Sherlock smiled as he leaned back against the stone railing at the edge of the terrace. “I must own to being surprised that these folks have so much energy for dancing after spending the day beating the bounds.”
He walked across the faded Persian rug to stand in the shadows of the doorway. Lord Watson had his back to him, so he had a good view of the baron’s clenched hands clasped behind him. The man who had clearly irritated John’s father stood in profile to Sherlock.
John eased away from Sir Albert, amazed that he released him. Then he realized Sir Albert knew John had no escape from what he had planned for him. He would prove him wrong. John spun about to flee. His arm was grabbed, and he was turned around to see one of the men raise his gun and drive the butt against the coachee’s head.  John shouted.
He came to stand by John again. “Do you share their opinions?”
“Thank you,” John said, knowing he must say something. He chose a chair across from the settee leaving no chance that Sherlock would sit right next to him. Close proximity to him had an odd effect on John, so odd that he found it difficult to think of anything else.
“It’s better than when I was remembered.” Harry rubbed her backside. “Then we had to lean over each boundary stone and have its location imprinted with a stick.”
When Sebastian’s fingers moved along John’s arm, he ripped himself out of Sebastian’s grip, wrenching his elbow.
French soldiers!
John said nothing as Father walked out. He might be able to baffle his father with half-truths, but he couldn’t do the same with himself. There was no reason to remain cowering behind the walls of Watson Hall to hide from the lies the Morans might be spreading when he was living a lie himself.
Greg climbed in and sat beside John.  “It can now go as we planned.”
“Good.” William released him, tugging nervously at his waistcoat. “I do not have time to make sure you have a watchdog every minute.”
John grinned and sank back an inch before pulling forward again.  Arms grasped him and pulled him back to impale him fully on the cock under him.
“That is good.”
John put a hand on Sherlock’s arm as he grimaced. He shook it off and massaged his right shoulder.
“You heard me. He is gone.”
Bending toward him, John put the glass to his lips. He sipped cautiously and smiled as he lowered the glass.
“John Watson.” He stepped closer to the wagon.  What could it hurt to look at the persistent man’s wares? He might find something to take his mind off his troubles.
