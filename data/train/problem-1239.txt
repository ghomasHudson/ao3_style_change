Sherlock shakes his head furiously in mad desperation, tearing at his hair, his collar, his mouth, but all of it in absolute silence. He is clearly well past his wit's end, and he struggles so much with communication
John doesn't even seem to notice it. He's curled his fingers tightly around Sherlock's enough that it mostly stills the tremor entirely. It's barely enough for Sherlock to notice, between the gloves and his own chilled hands, but it's there. Just the slightest tremor in his hand.
"There's really no need to worry," he mollifies, because Sherlock is continuing to try and crane his neck and squirm about in his chair, as if if he maneuvers just enough he'll be able to see right through the closed door and start glaring. "She didn't know about you. And was mortified when she found out."
John glares back at him, his teeth set on edge. How the hell does Mycroft think he is, considering's he upstairs having a
Sherlock swirls out the door in a dramatic swirl of his coat. His phone has already been pushed into John's hand, so that one of them can give the cabbie the address.
Once again, Sherlock was then left to sit silently. Waiting wordlessly as he smoked in a back alley, positioned just so to get a glimpse of when the suspect left his flat and gave him free reign. He smoked and he sat and he waited, and no reply came.
"...Sherlock," he murmurs, his voice thick. He's takenaback and concerned all at once, but mostly, it's concern.
His friend lifted his chin with a haughty sniff. "Dr. Andrews." He started tapping his little finger again, scratching it hard in the crook of his elbow.
did. He wasn't a freak or a baby; wasn't that what part of what he'd wanted to prove by coming to Cambridge at all? To find people like him? To prove that he wasn't alone? Excluding Mycroft, but what the
he loved Rosie, even now, when she could do little more than babble and wave her stuffed toy in the air.
Sherlock rolls his eyes at his retreating back. He already jitters on the spot, his palms sweaty and chest fluttering with something that isn't quite yet a craving, but it will be, if he lets this go on. He will let this go on.
"And I'd feel a lot better if you agreed to... if you at least tried to keep talking to me about it. Or Ella, or another--"
Scooped and scraped clean until he was empty and very, very numb. It was a similar experience to the grief that had taken root inside him when Sherlock had stepped off a rooftop and made John watch it happen, and for two years John had thought it had been his stupid, callous words
couldn't pass-- are you shagging Dr Watson now? Is that how it works?" He flinched even harder back but his mouth was curling again in another sneer, another jab, another sore spot that he thought would hurt. "He does all the work and lets you take half the credit because you're so good in bed?"
you know enough sodding judges and doctors to force it, but it will only make him worse, and then you'll only have yourself to blame."
Sherlock leaned down, and in very full view of the entire restaurant, but very especially the two reporters from the Sun, kissed him.
"Well, Sherlock, that does tend to be what happens, when one takes a baseball bat to the head. Perhaps you'll remember that for next time."
John turns, very slowly, back around. Every trace of his sleepy, early-morning affection is gone, and instead of a smile he now stares are Sherlock with such sudden intensity that the feeling moves inside him and robs the space from the anxiety that wants to grow.
flash across his phone's screen, and he let the name alone fill his chest until that was all that was inside him.
Oscar wasn't the first time. And he hadn't been the last. Oscar was not the only relationship in his life to disintegrate because Sherlock hadn't been enough. Not good enough. Not
he sees it, now, of course. John doesn't realise it was all a plan, that he was never in any genuine danger, of course. John thinks he was actually in danger. Sherlock starts to sign his intentions, trying to explain it as simply as he can--
Mycroft is still in the corridor, of course. Just far enough down that he sits near the lift rather than the ICU itself, his phone out as he taps away. Probably ordering the military itself out to go track down who's done this to Sherlock.
But John looks at him, and somehow those two words were all it took to make him soften, that coldness in his face gone and the mug of tea turned in his hands. "It's... okay. Really. I think neither of us want to fight tonight. I just... I need for you to be all right. And I know you can't promise that but- not Magnussen, Sherlock. If Mary or whatever her name is can't handle him on her own, then fine. But unless you can look at me honestly and say that there was no way whatever plan you were thinking up could end in any way badly for you, then stay out of it. Promise me you'll stay out of it."
John laughed, a vibration that Sherlock felt into his own hands and chest. "Of course. And you'll drink it, even when you complain that it's missing two milligrams of sugar or the temperature is off by .4 degrees, or whatever nitpicky thing that's wrong with it."
is not supposed to entail throwing up at eight in the morning after a night spent not-asleep on the sofa.
The next thing John knows, he's moaning on the floor of the surgery, Sarah kneeling over him sternly calling his name, trying to get him to open his eyes, and his head feeling as if it's about to split open. Bloody
Sherlock flips another page, tracing a finger down the page soundlessly as he reads. He is, very transparently, pretending John does not exist.
He wastes no time in crossing to Sherlock's side, bolting across the room the very moment he determines the flat to be Mycroft-free. "Are you okay?" he demands, one hand settling protectively on his shoulder while the other thrusts the curtain back, John leaning to watch as the long, black car of secrets drives away. "What the hell did he want? I swear, if he tried to pull anything while I wasn't here--"
"No. I said I know the chemist who made the discovery." Sherlock clattered his cup down to the table in a sudden jerk, his eyes shuttered, like steel. His face had gone ice cold and back to hostile. "Victor Trevor."
That's hardly what he does now, even. He lets Sherlock take the lead but he's always stroking his hair, cradling his arse, desperately, almost violently kissing back. There are so many little
He plans the perfect wedding and then kisses John in the middle of the ceremony. He plans the perfect wedding and plays the perfect waltz and gives John the perfect night, and goes home. He doesn't plan the wedding; he doesn't go to the wedding at all. John marries Not-Mary-Morstan and his best man is Gavin Lestrade because Sherlock died in Serbia, and nobody cries because Sherlock did it Wrong, and it's
There is a couple at the reception desk, although 'couple' is perhaps phrasing it much too charitably. A young woman, about John's height and pressing a bloody towel to her forehead, chalk white or even a little green, one arm gripped about by who is certainly supposed to be her boyfriend. A hulking mountain of a man that's taller than Sherlock and not at all as thin, shouting at the poor girl at reception-- the one who'd tried to kiss John earlier today, as a matter of fact. Whatever lingering resentments he has towards her evaporate, because she looks like she's about to cry now, and for good reason. That man is definitely on something, and clearly has no reluctance whatsoever about hitting a woman.
John hesitates, his heart still lodged uncomfortably in his throat. He clenches his hand, uncertain, then just slides his palm up to Sherlock's cheek and nudges, gently, just enough to get him to meet his eyes. Sherlock stares back at him, expressionless and cold and his bright eyes like hard glass, and it hurts more than John knows what to do with.
John hesitated again. "I figured you wouldn't actually care all that much about one for yourself. It's just a piece of paper to you. And like I said, that one's just a copy-- they're sending the real one to his parents, in Sussex. But I wanted to... I thought that this was a start, at least." He broke off again, his fingers working nervously into the blanket over his arm. "Is it... is it all right?"
Sherlock lets his head loll against John's wet shoulder, his cheek pressing against the angry starburst scar.
Because John is a good man. He can make promises to Sherlock, he can sit next to him when he has nightmares, and he can bring Chinese takeaway straight to his hospital bed, and he can't abandon his own child. There's a mess of deductions to be made there about John's own childhood, a veritable thorn bush that makes Sherlock want to hit something, but the point is that John can want this to be simple all that he likes but it's not.
"You're..." Oscar's pathetic struggles stilled, and he started to sit up. His dark eyes widened. "You're Dr Watson. You're Dr John Watson." His face twisted, equal parts derision and fear standing out in the darkness. "Did Sherlock send--"
"He shouldn't have had any more students to begin with. He should've been fired! He should've been fucking
He would also stand as a testament to the day that Sherlock Holmes was chased out of Scotland Yard by one extremely irate John Watson, whacked about the shoulders with a snapping case file, all to the irresistible screeching tune of,
John left that alone, for now. He believed that Sherlock had verbally said yes. He also believed that it hadn't remotely been an enthusiastic one. It hadn't at all been something Sherlock had actually wanted to do, and Oscar had known that. And Sherlock had known he'd known.
Slowly, almost warily, John joined him in sitting down. His fingers stayed curled around his hands but his face stayed calm, always nothing but calm, and Sherlock anchored himself on that as he listened on. He could always trust John.
"And so do I, Sherlock." He smiled back, emotion stinging at the back of his throat, and somehow ended up allowing Sherlock's arm to slide again around his back as he dropped his face against his shoulder. "With everything that we have between us, I think we will. I think we'll be okay."
to get himself free, and if they marked the endgame as him finding his voice? Then that just might be enough. He's smart and resourceful enough to do it. Sherlock just might be able to focus on that, and tear himself apart to stitch the bloody bits back together again with his own two hands, and drag himself over the finish line.
The dealer that he goes to see lives in an upper scale suburb, where he services London's upper class. Sherlock has never frequented these sorts of circles-- the CCTV networks are impossible to avoid here, and in his more heavily recreational days, he''d stood out like a sore thumb. But he's only going just the once, this time. Just one supply is all he needs, and he needs it as high quality as possible.
A short moment of silence followed. Sherlock's breaths continued to stutter over the line, and from behind him, John could just feel Mycroft's level gaze, staring at his back.
The look on Sherlock's face was... it was too much. It was disbelieving and stunned and overwhelmed all at once, and it almost made John want to cry. Because some part of Sherlock clearly didn't believe him and that fact alone was all the difference in the world. That he treated Rosie as a privilege and not a right. It was more than John's parents had ever done.
"Yeah? That'd be because Mycroft made you drink enough water before you passed out. The dehydration is usually what causes the headache, but the nausea's from drowning yourself in what your body thinks is a poison and wants to get rid of it. There's no quick fix for that, I'm afraid." He smirked at Sherlock again, still sitting there with his head plonked down against the mug. "You should send your brother a gift basket."
He drained half his glass in a single gulp, and it made his throat burn so viciously he nearly gagged it straight back up.
Mycroft rolls his eyes again, looking at Sherlock rather than him. "You sorely underestimate my brother."
that you can't do anymore, and you know, probably did take a few years off your life. None of which you talk about, but I'm a bloody good doctor, a trauma surgeon, I
or perhaps John just really does know him that well, because John's smile crumples again, forlorn, like he's falling inward. But his hands around Sherlock's remains strong and he doesn't let go. "You don't believe me," he mutters, touching his face. His hands are cold but Sherlock's even colder, so somehow, it all balances out. "And I can't even blame you, after... but I promise I mean it, Sherlock. Do you have any idea how incredible you are?" He shakes his head again, as if it is one of life's great mysteries, his hand tracing over the side of his face and his hair, and for a moment he looks about to kiss him. "Do you have any idea how incredible you
"Come on," he says, squeezing his hand tightly. "Good work. You did your job, Mr. Consulting Detective. Now it's time to go home."
It's not at all a perfect blog-post-worthy ending. Sherlock's shirt is alternatively wrinkled and sticky, plastered to his skin, and they both look dreadful with bedhead and sleep clinging to John's eyes at seven thirty in the morning. He keeps stumbling over his own words and John landed half on the floor when he tackled him down and is still there, and it is his first words
John turns away, up on his feet to pace, his back to Sherlock as his shoulders hunch and tremble in just barely restrained fury. He ends up in the kitchen, gripping the table of his experiments in white-knuckled fists with each and every breath a fight.
He's wanted to find some way to have Sherlock sit down with a therapist for months, now. A professional of some kind,
"You smell like wine," John chuckles, his breath warm against his skin. His eyes are heavy with sleep, one only half-open at all, but so close and blue and soft Sherlock could drown in them
That was it. He couldn't take this anymore. "Come here," he started, "just-- come over here, Sherlock--" and it was probably a bit not good that Sherlock melted under his words just like that and crossed over to him like being reeled in on a string.
It was one of Victor's old lab notebooks. The graduate student that had shown him around in the spring, and vanished before Sherlock had matriculated. He wasn't sure what had happened to Victor, whether he'd graduated or not, but what was important was that he wasn't here anymore. His notebooks and data, however, were.
It didn't matter if Mary had been dyeing her hair or not. She was dead now. It didn't matter if that was one more lie. Rosie's hair would be whatever color it was going to be, she would be beautiful no matter what, and that was that.
"Right, that's, uh- good to know. Thanks for that." Lestrade hesitated again by the door, rubbing at his eyes with one hand. He looked ready to drop and not entirely sure what to say. "I'll be off, then. Try and get some sleep, the both of you. And for
"Don't do it," John says into his hands. His voice is shaking, very slightly, and his tea is set down with a clatter. "Don't get involved."
He doesn't mention his other failures of the past week. He sees no reason to embarrass himself even further.
John does not give a shit about this case, he does not give a shit about cyanide pills, he does not give a shit about Mycroft's work.
He's considering a dog. Asking about one, at least, to Mrs. Hudson and to Sherlock. He's delayed it thus far since broaching that question would be minefield, because it means admitting to Sherlock he's been talking about him behind his back with Mycroft. But at this point, what else can he do?
Mrs. Hudson is standing right in the doorway to the flat, a bowl of biscuits in hand. Today isn't her baking day. They're from Mr. Chatterjee. They're from Mr. Chatterjee and he hadn't known it because he's been up here all day, but whenever Mr. Chatterjee brings her baked goods she always brings half the box up here to keep him and John fed. Mrs. Hudson is standing in his doorway with biscuits.
It is suffocatingly silent. He nudges opens one folder, then the other, his pale face cold and about as expressive as a stone. He nods.
Victor was the worst student on the floor. What other explanation could there be, for why a professor would be speaking to him like that?
Davis has an eidetic memory, like Sherlock. It's the reason he's able to be so successful, while running this business on the side: he has no paper trail for the police to follow.
The seconds pass in that same suffocating, horrible silence. Sherlock can't stop gasping again, and he can't look at John either, and this on top of never bloody eating or sleeping-- he might well be on his way towards proving Mycroft right, and passing out right there on the floor. Not on John's watch. "Sherlock," he entreats again. He buries his face to his chest, listening to the frantic racing of his heart. "I know I'm probably the last person you want to listen to right now, but love, you're going to faint. Just-- take a breath, Sherlock, with me, just one, there you go. There you go. And another. That's it. Just like that. Brilliant, Sherlock."
"And then you turned up on my doorstep with a limp and a psychosomatic tremor. Purely coincidentally."
1. Sherlock (horribly) hurts John. John (undeservedly) forgives (wretched, loathsome, unforgivable) Sherlock.
violin, his notes and scales that he has spent decades carving into his head, his bow, his music. And now he can't touch it.
"I feel much better, and for the last time, I'm clean as a whistle. My most likely cause of death at the moment is expiring from boredom, but wonderful Geoff has arrived here with the cure! Haven't you, Geoff?"
I promise, the "all this conflict would be resolved with a single straight conversation" won't drag out for too long! John will get there soon. He just needs one or two more nudges to go!
to get out of here, where Molly is staring at him with shocked, pitying eyes, and holding his hand, and taking his pulse because he probably looks like he's having a bloody heart attack. He wants to be alone, in a very deep, dark pit, with the blankets over his head to ride out the oncoming panic where no one can see.
Not the right way. The sort of way that he can't say aloud to him, because it's Not Good, and the sort of way that he knows John will never give back to him, because John is Not Gay. Which is quite all right. Sherlock's has died for John, has stood at his wedding, and now knows exactly what it feels like to die of a literal broken heart. He can easily live with this.
But then he pivoted back around to face John, swiveling around on squeaky shoes to look down at him with those big eyes, his face hard and even paler than before. "John," he started, "is it... is it--" He curled a hand over his stomach, wrenching his shirt into a tight knot in his fist and licking his lips. "Is it normal, to feel... before a date, like I..."
"All right," Ella said gently, holding a hand up in unresisting surrender. "You don't feel it was abusive. All right-- then let's look at it another way. Imagine it wasn't Sherlock that you had feelings for, John. Imagine that it wasn't a man at all. Just... a woman that you'd met at work, that you have no prior history with at all. No faked suicides, or drug addictions, none of the things that make it so complicated with Sherlock. Would you still be willing to try a relationship, with her? Or would you still be wary-- just like you are with him?"
While Sherlock did not have his conductor of light available to best focus his ideas, it still promised to be a thrilling enough case to keep him occupied. And
John let out a very long-suffering sigh, tilting his head to the back of his chair. "I don't understand how someone can be so smart and so
All that did was reaffirm John's decision that this was something they needed to talk about. Right now. He didn't want to start a relationship with someone who'd give him a miserable, reluctant, unwilling but verbal
John is staring at him from his chair, gone pale and tight-fisted again, his each breath jerking in and out of his chest like it's forced. "You said-" He blinks, stricken. "You said it was for a case!"
John briefly squeezed his eyes shut, and pressed those thoughts out of his mind. It didn't matter how bad things were now, for either of them. What mattered was ensuring that they began tomorrow as a fresh start.
God!" He paced forwards and back, reaching up to all but tear his own hair out. "But I could hardly use a real plant! Do you realise how many times we would've killed a real plant, by now? No! Milgram would be dead seventeen times over! Imagine the massacre, my god!"
John kept his mouth shut, his hands clenched in his lap. He didn't want to sit here anymore, he wanted to tear out of the flat, drive Mycroft's fancy car straight down to the fancy restaurant, and drag Sherlock out of there. He wanted to sock Dr. Slug in a Suit in the face and then do it again. He didn't want to hear this.
He thinks he'd rather like to have the Tesco's map framed. Flattened and pinned preciously in careful glass, and hung next to his periodic table and judo certificate. Maybe if John signed it, with the date-- a permanent stamp and recollection of everything that this year has been, and everything that John has done for him, and everything that Sherlock is determined to never need again.
Greg didn't bother to even try to look surprised. Or abashed, for that matter. He shrugged a little, an extremely obvious and graceless affirmation, and Sherlock
aphasia. John is more sure of it by the day. Sherlock is not simply unable to express language. He remains unwilling to try, and he has refused to try it ever since the first day that he woke up. He won't so much as open his mouth, and he won't pick up the pen or paper when it's offered, and he refuses to even try to find a way to express what is wrong.
Sherlock suddenly gestures something. Or he tries to, through one arm being held to his chest and both his hands stiff and constrained, and the signs are slow and hesitant even if the lack of confidence does not show on his face. His mouth is moving through the words, but whatever they are, they are kept completely silent.
chair, his hands folded in his lap and his umbrella propped up by his side. There are no case files in sight, and it is to no one's surprise that Sherlock has not poured him a cuppa. The look on Mycroft's face is-- exasperated, if he has to put a word on it. In a patronising, annoyed sort of way, like a parent who has had to tell their five year old
about what Mary might've done to John is because he loves John. He needs him. John is as essential as air, is an anchor when lost at sea and is the hurricane when Sherlock is wilting and withering on land. He'd throw himself off a building for John. Obviously.
as his wild hair or his dramatic coat or his striking eyes. He misses how it sounds when he laughs, really, genuinely
Sherlock ignores him entirely at that; he hardly knows why Lestrade bothered to say it. He doesn't do patient interviews. He does
He sighs, and for a moment wants to throw the tablet across the room. It'd almost be worth it, just to see the expensive thing smack and break against the wall. "Is this about the heroin?"
He hates that. He hates that it has been three months and he's all but given up at managing anything more than the most basic of conversations, and yet Mycroft's had the time to become entirely fluent in between running the British government and trying to run Sherlock's life. He hates that he's the one that's
Sherlock shakes his head, not looking at John. He spreads his hand as much as he can, raw, sore fingertips pressing into his shirt.
It's not that Sherlock hasn't thought of it before, either. Of course he has. For various reasons, he's shot it down until now, but that's all
Sherlock sniffs a laugh and has to fight to keep it in his throat. He and Mycroft are two peas in a pod, aren't they?
"It's- ah." Sherlock gulped, forcing out twisted, dreadful approximation of a smile. It probably came out looking like he'd swallowed a lemon. "I require a leaf for one of my experiments."
Yes. John." Sherlock breathes in again, and John drops a hand from his face to squeeze his arm around him instead. Oh,
"I..." John leaned closer and pressed his face against Sherlock's shoulder, his arm around his back and his hand slipped under his shirt, fingers tracing over scars and clean skin without regard for the difference. "I will. But not tonight."
Words. Several deliberately chosen, abstract noises. Any noises at all that he picks to come out of his mouth. Preferably some that go together, in an order that makes sense. He has a masterful command of the English language. It can be any one of thousands of possibilities, already brewing inside his skull. Any at all. It doesn't even have to be English, as a matter of fact. He knows Lestrade took French in school, and Sherlock has any one of a dozen languages under his command. Any word from any single one of them would be enough.
"That one," Dr. Andrews sighed, shaking his head. "Never could quite manage a polite conversation." He turned fully to John, holding out his hand again. "And that'd make you Dr. Watson, then? I've seen you in the news, too."
Victor was dead. He'd tried with Victor, and Victor was dead. And he could blame Oscar if he said so, but at the heart of it was, Oscar hadn't injected the heroin. Oscar hadn't even seen him for years. Sherlock was the one who'd been there. He'd lived with him. And Victor had still killed himself.
John gives him another look, one that tries to be unamused but fails at it rather spectacularly. "And what are we supposed to do if they show up, anyway? Have Angelo invite them in for a free glass of wine?"
He pops one of the sticky buttons loose, his hands lingering near his neck. "It is a shame about the shirt," he murmurs, and he's still smiling and breathless and flushed. His hand slides to his sticky collarbone next. "You're an absolute lunatic, you know? Absolutely cracking mad."
when you were let to come home. Then, you are going to have a lie down with me, and have a bloody nap before you
But Sherlock, far from being softened by the concern, just ground his teeth even harder, the muscles in his neck standing out in sudden stark accord. "Well, I don't. It's a second-rate university, the administration is flimsier than wet paper, and I have no interest in assisting at a case on their campus."
His stomach goes cold and miserable, like he's just been forcefed a glass of ice water, and for a moment, John just wants to sit down on the floor and hold his aching head in his hands.
"...When we found him," Mycroft murmurs. He glances at John once, a pointed, needling look, and then down the corridor again, his grim expression softening as he looks towards his little brother's room. His hands clench together, and he looks almost ill. "You say that you read his chart, John? I'm sure that you do not need me to explain to you the condition he was in. You're a doctor. You can fill in the dots."
And then, when Mrs. Hudson is visiting her sister's, and Mycroft is out of the country, and John is going to be home late today because he's got his first meeting scheduled with a BSL tutor, and Sherlock is
A breath stuttered over the phone. Across the room, Mycroft stared at him in pale, barely disguised alarm, and John steadily turned away. This was not his business.
"Yes, yes, Graham, everyone relevant is assembled. Let's skip the pleasantries, shall we?" He all but vibrated as he stood, a self-contained ball of energy and nerves, smile blossoming. "You need me."
It was. John doubted it was all that perfectly steady all day long, because if it was, Sherlock would've shaved. He hated how the stubble felt on his face and he hated how it made him look.
But Sherlock breathed deeply next, his voice muffled, as if he'd buried his face into his hands or knees. "You can't tell John," he said, and there was a loud scrape, like a clumsy footstep. "'ll never forgive you, Mycroft, 'll set your favorite bakery on
Sherlock gently bobs his head once, still not looking at John. That's the limit of his communication, so far. Nodding and shaking his head.
Once again, the poor receptionist looks more than a little frightened. Once again, John can not blame her.
And he is reminded of an ex-army doctor, limping into a shitty bedsit and therapist's office, smiling to Ella, and telling her
hear him, the only thing more frightening than the hell he is currently enduring would be if John's voice vanished to let him endure it alone.
Sherlock opens his mouth, slowly tasting the feel of the words, his lips and tongue dry and his throat sore again. It's painfully quiet, in here, details crushing in around him and the weight of the silence on his tongue.
Sherlock is standing at the sign-in desk for A&E. He is a sight to behold. He gestures madly with his coat disheveled and the usual knot of his scarf hanging loose, and if John didn't know any better, he would've thought Sherlock was on something, too. The receptionist is midway through pushing him back, as if she's just had to double back to stop him from swinging around the counter to check the computer himself.
"I know that you were going to ask me for a collaboration. The answer is no. I don't do research collaborations." Sherlock stopped briefly, unsure if he really wanted to test this further, to go on, but in the end--
one that had probably never had a friend in his life, and all he'd seen was somebody that he could use. He'd used him until there was nothing left and then discarded him like trash, and now he'd come
The nervous work of his fingers dug deeper into his trousers, his eyes slitting open and his shoulders hunching even closer around his ears. "I was so
But Sherlock flinched again, his fingers digging back deeply into his own arms. "I am never going back to school."
When the clock ticks to 2:45 on the dot, Sherlock uses the last of the honey, and forces himself to move on legs filled with lead back to the bedroom.
"No. No, it was fine. Nothing that relevant for you, I think, though I'll see what Sherlock has to say."
Sherlock does his best to frown, to frown severely and sternly and above all else, calmly. He does his best to
"I'm glad we understand each other," he said, when Oscar at least had enough good sense not to argue again. "To make sure, though. I understand Sherlock ruined your marriage already?" He smiled again, and oh,
The data he'd found so far was surprisingly good. A few holes, here and there, but much higher quality than he'd expected, from the exhausted idiot that had shepherded him around last spring. He didn't know why he'd been so disliked, really; the data was higher quality than a lot of what he'd turned up around here.
he mutters, catching him by the arm. Sherlock tries to ignore him and pass on by, and John tightens his grip, his fingers digging into the crook of his elbow. "No. You listen to me, Sherlock. You're not doing anything beyond this scene. Okay? I know you want to be, but you are not ready for it. So help me I will drag you to the cab myself if you make me, Sherlock; nod your head. Tell me you understand."
Something of it must show on his face, because John shakes his head again, the self-loathing in his expression softening into a sad smile. "It's okay," he murmurs. "You don't have to say anything. I know I've said that before but... but I really mean it, this time. You don't ever have to say anything again, if you can't. I want you to be happy and if this is what that looks like for you now, then... that's okay."
He flattens himself into the sofa. Lovely, perfect sofa. Sherlock molds himself into the warm, unspeakably glorious cushion, underneath the soft, no-longer-despicable-hospital blanket.
"John, I've told you many times, if you persist in speaking with a cultural vernacular, you're going to have to retain a translator."
He swallows dryly again, his stomach in knots and his hands still clammy, an itching desire just underneath the surface for the stimulation that is right within arm's reach. He looks away from Mycroft again, glaring sickly at the way he takes up space in John's chair.
It reminds him of Lestrade, a little. What an increasingly irascible, anxious mess he'd been, in the last months of his marriage, but when the papers had finally been signed he'd just been relieved it was finally over.
"Here we are," Davis announces, returning back to Sherlock with a business-like precision, a baggie of very exactly measured and finely cut white powder in hand. "Lucky! Back inside. Mr. Holmes is just leaving."
Sherlock stands there in the cold, all but abandoned corridor, lit only by the glow of red emergency lights that label this area as condemned. It has looked this way for just under a year, now.
Sherlock bullied his way straight into the office without another word, leaving Dr. Andrews, looking particularly insulted, behind. And John probably should've followed him. Sherlock could look after himself, after all, and certainly didn't need John to tell people off behind his back, people that he didn't even care about in the slightest, for comments that Sherlock had brushed off without the faintest pause. What Sherlock actually needed from him now was to head into the crime scene himself, so he could take a look at the body, and give a proper medical consult.
He'd ruined John's life before. Why is John now looking at him like he's insane for trying to take precaution so that it does not happen again?
Sherlock seemed to want, very much, to lay down on the sofa after this, whether John was there or not. Perhaps specifically if John
Normally, he has any number of things to keep him occupied, during a spontaneous couch cuddle. His mind palace, science journals, experiment records. Silently bugging John into changing the channel to something slightly more tolerable than late night talk shows.
John rolls up his trouser leg up without making Sherlock do it himself, very carefully running his hands around the ankle that is now swollen to almost twice the size its supposed to be, and turning colors that would be incredibly fascinating if they weren't on his own limb. John hisses in sympathy, and immediately changes his mind about touching it. "Yeah, you made the right decision not walking anywhere on this. Sorry, but we're going to want to get you down to A&E. It could just be a sprain, but hairline fractures can hide in there without an X-ray, and if you miss that you'll be very sorry later."
John believes in him. John has just watched him strangle on his own tongue, fail in the very moment it mattered, and John
could not look at him. "It is not just an inability to be average. I will never not embarrass you at a party, should I even want to go. I will never not make your friends upset. I will alway say the wrong thing, at the wrong time, to the wrong person. Everyone will always want to know why you insist on wasting your time with such an obnoxious, dreadful person, and you will lose your patience with why I can
to me, I thought then--" Sherlock shook his head back and forth over his knees, his voice stumbling, and John's heart nearly cracked. "He got angry at me plenty of times. But he never made any advances, no matter how opportunities I gave him. Once I pretended to pass out into his bed while wearing a disgusting amount of leather, and he just dropped me in the shower. He listened when I said no. Even about silly things. He listened."
and instead hot arousal pools in his stomach until it can not be ignored. More than once he's almost wished he were a woman, which is a dreadfully abnormal thing to think as he strokes his own throbbing penis and silently whines through clenched teeth, but a woman would not have this...
John was starting to get angry himself, now, provoked by the obvious hostility. Mycroft hadn't been this angry at him when he'd
"I know, you berk." There was no doubt in his mind what Sherlock would've done. There was no doubt because there was no end to what Sherlock would do to keep him safe, and there was no end at all to what he would do for Rosie.
Mind bleach, please. Or for another bomb to go off in the flat. Either one would be welcome, at this point.
Sherlock's trying to speak. He realises how out of control this has gotten and he knows this is his one chance to explain himself before he gets thrown out of this hospital or worse. He has no choice left to speak. And he's
she cries, looking a bit like she's about to hug him again, or perhaps even start to cry. "It's been so
He also had no idea what he was going to say to Sherlock, and could use the night to at least attempt to get his thoughts together.
Sherlock Holmes is, among other things: a one in a million genius, a graduate chemist, and the only consulting detective in all the world over.
"I..." He stops, swallowing. How best to word this, to not set John off... "I might've upset the therapist."
Once again, Mycroft glances at him in that very Holmesian way, the way that makes it clear he thinks John is very, very stupid. "There are two dead bodies in a morgue, four others that my office is handling, and no answers between them, because my brother refuses to provide them. This case is not
Being ambushed and drugged on the street, just when they thought the case was ending. Waking up in the cold pool with the explosives already wired, and Moriarty in his ear. Moriarty's warm, cheerful accent, explaining and promising in very exact detail how he would do to all the pieces of John's body, and what precisely he would do to Sherlock, if John was to disobey.
He wavers suddenly, hitching downward and jerked back up again on wavering legs. He stares at John like he's having to fight very hard to keep his eyes open.
Sherlock mumbled something, still slumped into him. He looked quite content enough to never move again.
"So? So? What are you--" John broke off and shook his head, not at Mycroft anymore but at the dawning sense of horror in his stomach. But no. That didn't make sense. It couldn't be true, because why would Sherlock have lied about that? No,
If there's anything at all that he's learned from this dreadful experience, it's that there are worse things than sentiment.
Lestrade winces, a pale grimace that looks just about as bad as John feels. He doesn't say anything else, just looks across the ridiculous room to Sherlock again, and John follows his gaze to look himself.
It's like the final puzzle piece is dropping, at last clicked down into places of fighting it. Because that is the truth, right there, the truth that John has not wanted to acknowledge, and that Mycroft is in defiance of in coming here today.
My next trick (aside from a few assorted oneshots in my doc, including the Potterlock one) is a somewhat messy fic I'll dub Mutually Unrequited Pining: Fuck TLD, The Fix-It. It is an absolute wreck for everyone, and definitely not one I want to risk leaving hanging, so I'll try to complete it before I start posting. If this fic was a feels-good sort of fic, then that one is a feel-bad one until the end, so... stay tuned :)
John glanced over his shoulder, and for the first time since Sherlock had wrestled the Semtex vest all the way off, he was smiling, now. A small but definitely genuine smile. "Sherlock," he said, tilting the glass of water. "I learned how to mist and pamper your bloody rainforest plant. I'm pretty sure I'm in this with you for the long haul."
Sherlock kissed him for one moment, two moments, three. He made a soft sound into John's mouth, but it wasn't until the second time that he recognised it as a dry, cracked sob. "John," he groaned, and sagged forwards into the crook of his neck. "It's all-- we only--"
Half an hour in. Almost done with the second whiskey. Fifty minutes since Sherlock had left the flat, which meant ten until John would call him. Their orders came. Sherlock had never been less interested in food in his life. Couples that sat around them were quiet and romantic and polite, holding hands and kissing over plates of overpriced salmon and salad, while Oscar continued to sit there and sip soup and butter Sherlock up like a slice of toast.
If he'd thought Sherlock helping to get ready for his date was torture, than this was even wore than that.
"I don't want your wallet." John waited one very careful moment, watching the struggles slow on the ground as Oscar started to look up. "Do you know who I am?"
He wanted to kick the door shut, go make tea, and then sit down right next to Sherlock until he wrangled the truth out of him. He wanted to tell Sherlock to shut the hell up and stop playing him for an idiot, demand to find out what was wrong right now. He wanted to pull Sherlock into a hug and hold him until the pained grimace went away and whatever this was, make it right.
either. Surely John would at least let that wait until they're inside and no longer surrounded by rubbish in an alley.
It has been long enough that the milk might just have spoiled, when Sherlock staggers himself up to his full height.
"Oh, yes, I'm quite sure it'll be just one. Until you want another one. And then another after that. Because that how it goes, isn't it, Sherlock?" Mycroft glances at the ashtray in passing disgust, his glare sliding off of Sherlock like rain slicking the streets outside. "This, Sherlock. This is why I worry about you,
"Home," John agrees, forcing a smile that just about makes him feel sick, and catches Sherlock's cold fingers back into his own
The heart monitor screams in his ear, too fast and arrhythmic. Each peal drives into him and makes it feel like rats are scratching at the inside of his skull.
It's all very mundane and pedestrian. Sherlock lets it happen without anything more than token protestations, and once they are both sufficiently thawed out and defrosted, gets John to make good on his promise to snog the living daylights out of him, Mycroft or no.
and told him he deserved it. A normal person probably would do all those things. A normal person probably would be-- afraid of him.
"Never thought I'd see them working together like this, I'll tell you that much." He hesitates, his voice kept carefully low. John doesn't know why he bothers. Sherlock might as well have deleted their presence in the room entirely. "...how's he doing, then?"
Then, he jammed the flannel hard between his cheek and his shoulder, kicked the fridge shut, and set about making himself as comfortable on the floor as he could.
The only reason Sherlock had squirreled himself away back here was to not be found. He's hardly surprised in the slightest that it's come back to bite him exactly like this.
"He's assigning the problem to Mary. Unofficially, of course. If she is able to handle the problem in such a way that it can not be proved or traced back to her, then she'll have fulfilled her part of the bargain."
"I'm not sure if I agree with her. It wasn't anything like my parents and hell, none of us shot each other again, so it could've been worse. And I know that I wasn't exactly husband of the year, either. But..."
Sherlock stiffened. Open surprise flickered across his face before he controlled it again, beating it back into submission, but John just stared back and let the words settle. Mary: not the right person for him. There. He'd said it. He'd finally said it out loud and admitted it for the very first time.
Sherlock was right, anyway. He always was. John wasn't an alcoholic, no matter what Mycroft thought-- he didn't crave it, like Sherlock did those chemicals to inject in his veins right now. He could stop himself when he'd had enough. But Sherlock was still right. What did he get out of pouring himself half a bottle of whiskey, what did he
Everybody jumps, and John's hopes deflate inside him right along with the tension like a popped balloon.
Mycroft's mouth twitches, a small, upset thing. His patience is gone, now, and he looks ready to abort this entire conversation. Clearly, he had expected to have an ally here today, and had not been prepared to instead be the one that was ganged up upon. He does not like it. "Again," he murmurs, "you sorely underestimate Sherlock." As if Sherlock isn't standing behind John, his wrists red and sore and his eyes wide and his whole body trembling because he is
He ducks his head into his fists, kneading heavily at his temples. The weight on his chest is inescapable and crushing but he fights through it, one breath after another.
Sherlock breathes in raggedly, a deep and shocked inhale. His pale eyes lock with John's, but only for a moment, and his face contorts in the next second, one hand cradling his shoulder in agony. His pain is open-mouthed, but silent.
But it wasn't right. Ella's line of logic wasn't what had actually happened. It was a different interpretation, a different story; it wasn't
Neither happens, though it seems only to be because John is caught between the two. "God, what the hell are you doing out here," he mutters, on his knees beside him, and an attempt at a hug turns into a gruff cough and measuring of his pulse. "You're not an ice cube, at least. All right. Come on, let's see the ankle."
"John," Mycroft greets, up on his feet with a click of his umbrella. He nods at Sherlock, still balled in his chair, and slides past John in the doorway like a snake. "Good afternoon, then."
The search was simple enough. He did not actually need John for backup, though the lookout would have been highly appreciated, and he picked the lock and his way into the flat for a full night's worth of investigation. The suspect shouldn't be back into morning, not if his suspicions were correct, and that left Sherlock with more than enough time to make himself a cup of tea, fetch a snack from the cupboards, and settle in to look for evidence.
Slowly, his eyes drift over John. They're barely cognizant, and John isn't sure if he's being heard at all.
"Sherlock," he says again, pointing his finger at the screen. "If you start touching my clothes, I will start touching yours. I will mismatch your posh trousers with my
Mycroft's pale face pinches. He doesn't answer, just sits there and looks very, very tired. Unfortunately for him, John's patience has been left in the bin somewhere about this time last week.
John swallowed a hard mouthful of whiskey, clutching the glass tightly to his stomach, and stared at the waiting black screen of his phone.
It was something that he'd had to say. He remained firm on that. No matter how much Sherlock didn't want to hear it, and no matter how unhappy he was now.
Sherlock smirked again, hiding it back into his tea, and looked closer to himself again for the first time since they'd sat down. He drained an especially long sip, his mouth twitching, and when he put his mug down it was for an unrestrained grin. "Good," he said. "Because I think we have a case."
Sherlock flinched very slightly. Just a small, full-body twitch. He put his own tea down and steepled his fingers together, winding them into a tight knot as if to keep them still, hiding the shadows of his face behind them. He looked faintly ill for a second and once again stared at his hands rather than John.
It takes John a few moments, his hands slowly repeating the last sign on his own. "Work... a case? He had a case for you?"
do you realise that? If I'd kicked you too hard? If you'd hit your head the wrong way?" He wanted to reach out to him, to take his rough face in his hands and shake him,
started to form in his stomach. For a moment it felt like all the air had been robbed from the room and all that was left was the seething anger inside his head.
Sherlock gave an uninterested shrug, still staring at his feet. What did it matter? He'd been hit before. Nobody had ever asked why or who. He didn't care about getting retribution or protection or... whatever it was the incompetent administration would promise. He just wanted to be left alone. "I suppose. Dr. W--"
John shrugged. "I don't know. Twenty-four, twenty-five, maybe. He was a graduate student. But Dr. Wilson would've been almost twenty years older, and I'm... god." He dropped back heavily in his chair to sink his head against his hand, bearing the brunt of a wave of anger and self-loathing. "You see what I mean? Sherlock would've been a foot taller than him and several dozen times smarter. Seriously, who could take advantage of
The crime scene is a house in the country. It is surrounded by a bed of gravel, with the road, the police cars, and any possible taxis, nearly half a mile away. It had taken them at least five minutes of a brisk walk to reach the crime scene before. At the pace Sherlock is going at now, their ride will take at least three times that.
You're incredible, Sherlock, you know that? Absolutely incredible!" He crouched down for a moment, looking him in the eye again very closely, and smiled. "You know? I've got a suggestion for you."
it was going to be glorious. John was about to question him, it was clear on his face, but Sherlock didn't have the patience to sit there and listen and
John meets Sebastian Wilkes. Unctuous and full of himself and laughably smug, sneering about the freakish spectacle that is Sherlock Holmes- as if the manifestation of slime in human form Sebastian Wilkes is any better. John looks like he'd quite like to punch him. "My colleague, John Watson," Sherlock says-
Slowly, still feeling a bit as if from far away, Sherlock lifted his phone up, showing the incoming call to Oscar. "My apologies," he heard himself say, his voice tiny and distant. "If you'll excuse me a moment." He stood back up on legs that feel empty and numb, shivering inside his coat, and he withdrew.
what the hell else?" And suddenly, Sherlock was shouting over the phone, his voice oddly tiny and cracked through the static. "I hate him. He's a disgusting human being. He makes me sick and he killed my best friend, and I still-- I'd still--"
John stared on at him again, still looking about as startled as a fish on land. He opened and shut his mouth and the number one thing he didn't do was
John did actually look irritated, now, his jaw clenched and one thumb jittering against his tea. As if this was something he'd said before, or had tried to say before, and this was the final straw rather than the start of a conversation. And Sherlock didn't know why. But what he did know was the crime scene was waiting, and if he dallied for too long Anderson would contaminate it like the idiot that he was, and his interesting goldmine of a case would be
Sherlock is spending the evening with Dr. Oscar Wilson, and how on earth he talked you into letting him."
Sherlock presses his ear to his chest, sinking deeper fury and despair and the unfairness of it all, the horrible, disgusting
Well, as it all turned out, it didn't matter what he should've done. Because Sherlock had still made the choice to hang up the phone and step off the rooftop, even with John begging him to stop. For two years, he'd at least had that. That he'd tried, in the end, to stop him. He'd done the right thing and it just hadn't been enough.
Mrs. Hudson was about just frequently enough to be abnormal. She may not've been his housekeeper, but that didn't stop her from popping in on him morning, noon, and night. She made tea, and brought biscuits, and chided at him to
John's tries to reciprocate. More than once, he feels John's hands start to move, clutching his shoulders but wanting to touch more. More than once John arcs to lift his head and kiss back. The furthest he gets is half-slipping one hand underneath his waistband, panting and trembling into Sherlock's neck, his grip curling around the inside of his thigh.
After his little speech, Sherlock simply sat there in perfect silence, long limbs draped all over the sofa and his features hard again, as if carved from a block of stone. He glared across the room and not at John, anger brimming in his eyes, but there was something underneath it. Something that John didn't quite understand, but he could at least translate as hurt. Hurt. John's assumption about his sexuality, his apparently incredibly off-base assumption, had hurt him.
Oscar moved a bit on the sofa, pressing sideways to make more room for Sherlock. He still held his arm out to him and never once stopped smiling. "It's all right," he promised again, warm and welcoming. "It's really all right, Sherlock-- nobody likes it their first few times. You just have to learn how, you know? This is something that adults do. And I've told you before, I know a lot of students, Sherlock-- you're
It was all right. He knew John was planning on asking him to move back in. He could wait for it. The flat had already been made safe for Rosie, Mrs. Hudson would be absolutely beside herself, and Sherlock would... be glad for it. Very much so. Yes.
He paces back to the armchair and settles himself down on his knees before it, palming John's face and breathing in the entire space of him. It's addictive and encompassing, and he presses his forehead down to his and wants nothing more than to swallow this all up and keep this feeling memorised and preserved, right there inside of him.
. The last thing John would recommend to any patient of his that was well enough to work would be to vegetate inside his bloody flat.
John winces, carefully prodding at the short line of stitches in his head. He has to wait on the results to get back from the requisite head scans, but after that, he has his hopes he'll be home free. It's a Tuesday afternoon, one of the slowest times of day, so surely it's not going to take that much longer.
Sherlock bears down, grasping himself closer to John's hips. He scratches a ragged check mark into his side, nodding awkwardly, and.John shudders and whimpers again. He comes into Sherlock's mouth, again hot and salty and so very, very
(And if he really wants to push the metaphor, Magnussen is a bystander ready to upend the whole board, but thinking about Magnussen tends to set off the blood pressure monitor again, so. No go.)
"Sherlock," he started, though the call was still on mute. It was for the best-- John had no idea what to say.
Perhaps if he hid himself in the corner and made himself down as small as possible and pretended to not exist...
Besides, this was what people did, wasn't it? He'd never had so much as a friend, before, never mind a relationship, but he'd observed it in others, and this was something people did. This was something that made people happy. It wasn't Oscar's fault that he couldn't be normal about it, but Sherlock was a good student, wasn't he? He could learn. Oscar said he was brilliant and special and that he loved him-- the least Sherlock could do was try to properly reciprocate.
Mrs. Hudson finishes her bustling, while Sherlock occupies himself with standing there mute like a mannequin. She talks enough for the both of them, deflating the dusty silence of the flat with her chatter alone, the pressure on Sherlock evaporating just like that.
"Is it a good idea for you to poke near your eye with sharp objects right now?" John rolled his eyes, then poked his nose when Sherlock looked to to be about to reply with an indignant defense. "Don't answer that. I'll take them out. Hold still another second." He slipped back to the loo to go through his kit and head back, the proper supplies now in hand. Sherlock had, at least, had the good sense to keep his medical supplies... even if he doubted he'd used most of them for anything that was remotely medically sanctioned.
" Sherlock nuzzled his head into him again, considering. "I won't be able to look after Milgram, obviously. That'll be on you."
unparalleled. In making you feel useful, that is. That's what you like, to feel useful. Isn't it?" He smiled again, in a way that was probably a bit cruel, and Not Good. "Keeping an eye on me to make sure all I'm smoking is a cigarette probably helps you to feel infinitely more
A much quieter story, not a headline at all, was of Oscar's subsequent separation from his wife. It looked likely that divorce proceedings were to follow, along the heels of his retirement.
There'd been a good reason why. But honestly, painkillers and antibiotics lying suffocatingly heavy on his skull, he doesn't even remember it.
There was a knife on the table, and he wanted to pick it up, and he wanted to stab him. Right now. Right in the stomach. Where it would be bloody, and gruesome, and violent. He wanted to feel the blade dig inside him and watch the pain contort on his face and hear him scream, and why the
but that was what she'd meant. How else had Sherlock been meant to interpret that? What else had he been supposed to do?
"Sorry, sorry--" Sherlock's nostrils flare, impatience blazing under the surface, and John can barely scramble his phone out fast enough. "Hang on, will you... Greg? He wants to know about the security system. Were any alarms tripped?"
"--yeah, yeah," Greg chuckled, grinning, "and it's his area of expertise, really. It's a senior professor of chemistry at Oxford."
It was quiet for another moment. Sherlock remained perfectly, obediently motionless under his hands, finally almost like himself again. Just another stitch from over his eye, and all the horrible marks of this dreadful case would be gone. He'd be Sherlock Holmes again and they could finally start making their first strides to moving past this, and on to a better future. Sherlock wasn't going to do drugs ever again, John was never going to hit him again, and... and Sherlock was going to move on. They were going to stop being so bloody co-dependent and he was going to find someone that wasn't John.
and on his own for the first time. Mycroft had been neither of those things. But today had already been difficult enough. Now wasn't the time to try and again drive those points home.
"That's not how it was! Sherlock wasn't, he--" This was not going to happen. No. He could not sit here and listen to this become
He takes five seconds to just sit there at the foot of the stairs, swallowing against his hand, and trying not to weep.
Mycroft stares at him, going ever increasingly red, and Sherlock's own anger finally prods into indignation.
Sherlock utterly ignores him. Sherlock does not respond in any way, and instead just keeps watching John with those narrowed, wary eyes.
"It's not your fault, Greg. Although maybe you should update your passwords." John pauses, chewing on the inside of his cheek. "We both know if Sherlock wants in on a case, he finds a way."

give Sherlock cause to be so worried about a simple date that the world's only consulting detective was trembling in his own kitchen.
It's not even an arguable point, but Sherlock still keeps his mouth shut. John doesn't like it when he lies, and John won't like the truth here, either. There is no recourse but to stay silent, and he frowns across the room again, free hand flexing and clenching under the table so as to not rub at the scar.
"Mrs. Hudson," he spits. She's one foot out the door, her back to him and one second away from disappearing off down the stairs entirely. But she's still there. She can still hear him. "More. Tea."
Sherlock keeps his mouth shut, giving John the dull, unseeing nod that he needs. And John lingers still for a moment longer, his hand catching in his damp hair and his eyes full of so much worry it weighs in his chest like lead.
They start with the standard, and slowly progress to the more and more unlikely. The first outside consultant to be called in is an ear, nose, and throat physician that John rather suspects works in the day at Buckingham Palace, and she wastes no time at all in palpitating Sherlock's pale neck and looking down his throat.
take it from you. Your heart stopped, and Sherlock, just don't insult me right now by telling me she called the ambulance. I'm a doctor. She knew exactly what chances she was giving you and it's a miracle you survived, and she left you with a lifetime of chronic pain, and things about

He's still bundled up in his coat and scarf and shoes, and the ball he makes in his chair is just too limber and flexible to be fair, from a man in his late twenties that takes better care of his violin than he does himself. His bright eyes are staring blindly straight through John, long fingers bouncing against his knees, that clever mouth twitching.

John smirked. The look on his face was lovely enough to be unfair, and made even worse by the fact that John really did not seem to have the slightest sense of pity for him
And Sherlock likes to think there is no limit to what he would do for John, but this is for John. He'd thrown his voice away for him and now he wants it back. He
John shrugged himself. Not really, no. Chemistry was chemistry, no matter the university, and a murder victim was just as dead no matter where they were. "We're fine with either," he agreed, nudging Sherlock's knee. "Yeah?"
A very big part of John wants to jump for joy. Wants to get up and sing a bloody song and then turn around on Sherlock, to press him for more.
I want him and I'm scared of what it'd be because I don't know what worse is. But I can't do worse. I can't anymore. I'm so
The only option he has is to stand there in the doorway, radiating annoyance and disapproval, and do what he can to make sure none of this gets out of control.
It was too difficult to dissect it. He'd given up trying. If he'd have ever gone back to Mary if he hadn't had his unborn child and Sherlock to worry about, because Sherlock had insisted he could trust her, but how, exactly, had John been meant to believe that? She'd already shot Sherlock once. Why was he supposed to trust that she wouldn't shoot him again, if John gave her a reason to? Why was he supposed to trust that she wouldn't do something to their baby? Why was he supposed to trust that she wouldn't shoot
Milgram never would be removed from Baker Street. He would, instead, stand as a permanent icebreaker and testament to the life and ways of Sherlock Holmes (and, more than once, would be utilised as a heavy club against criminals that tried to raid the flat).
"Scott," Francis says quietly. He hands the first set of papers back, allowing for him to crumple and crush them out of existence, his skin crawling and his stomach sick and on fire. "A relationship can't work if you feel the need to hide what hurts you from your partner. The saying is
John looks at him from across the room, his arms full of prescriptions and a new medical kit. Even with his hands busy with sterile alcohol solution and latex gloves, he still can't help but look the slightest bit amused. "Happy to be home?"
John kisses him again, pressing his face to the hollow of his throat, and the very, very end of a scar. He kisses him and kisses him until Sherlock all but comes off the bed, filled with buoyant joy and satisfaction, because John
John's amusement faded as quickly as it had come. He kept his mouth shut, but privately, all he could think was that, once again, Sherlock was being extremely unfair to himself. Mycroft had read the situation better than Sherlock because he had been an adult, with life experience, and had had the opportunity to observe relationships in others and recognise when one was healthy and one was not. Sherlock had been
He's starting to babble, now, to run out of things to say. He keeps on going anyway, repeating himself and reciting older cases and when that runs out just tells him how brilliant he is. How fantastic he is. How
"What?" Sherlock said suddenly. He hauled his head up off the sofa to laser focus on John. "You thought I was what?"
At least Mycroft had known something was wrong. At least Mycroft hadn't all but shoved him out the door onto a
"Can you give me just a few more days?" He breathed deeply again, still stroking her hair, but he sniffed once and battled all the tears back into just silent grief in the back of his throat. He'd cried all over Sherlock; he wouldn't cry all over Rosie, too. "I'm so sorry. You're being so wonderful. So brave, love. Just give me a few more days to make things right, okay?"
Oscar tried to squirm back, tried to tug his head out of Sherlock's grip, his eyes wide. "You!" he gasped, jerked back. "How dare you?! You're a drug addict, a
He forced a smile, anyway. Bit by bit, like pulling teeth, every inch forcibly arranged and dragged through the mud to do it. "And I'm equally surprised," he murmured, lowering himself to sit. "I expected to be left waiting for at least thirty minutes. Have you at last learned punctuality, or has someone just finally given you a watch?"
, and that'll break the dam. Sherlock is absolutely sure of it. If he can just find a way to get one word out, to just do it
Oh, Sherlock." He wiped his mouth, looking up at him with realization dawning over his face as fully as a light being switched to on. He sat up and looked at Sherlock with soft eyes and a softer smile, beckoning out to him for him to rejoin him on the sofa. "Come here. It's okay."
Mary had loved him. He believed that. And she had liked Sherlock. He believed that, too. Sherlock was a very difficult person to love, but once you really got to know him, he was an impossible person to hate. Mary had not hated him. She hadn't even disliked him.
Just a few weeks ago, he'd willingly laid himself out for John to kick him until he'd been coughing up blood, and looked up at the people trying to help him and announced
"Yes," he spat. He could barely hear himself speak, his voice distant and tiny in his ears as if from a hundred miles away. "You were right, Oscar. It certainly does help me to... relax."
He rolls his eyes, once again keeping his hands locked in his lap. Mycroft would sooner quit and retire to Sussex. Sherlock would sooner kill himself.
He proposes a meeting with Magnussen. Because Magnussen remains a threat, primarily in his aims to control Mary, but that puts John under his sphere of influence, and this Sherlock
"Is that the new model of centrifuge?" Sherlock ducked under his stretched out arm, sidestepping him into the deserted lab. It was! "It
"Oh my god." John sat up straighter, the knot in his stomach suddenly softening straight into warm fondness. "You're
John spent several seconds staring alternately between Sherlock and the house plant, a very unusual, prickly thing, an array of red-backed green leaves that were durable and hardy. In their native habitat, they had much use as a building and storage material. There was any number of experiments that Sherlock could do, with the leaves of a
"Sherlock-" John sits at the table with him, his hand reaching out and falling back in the same breath. "Just how much of what you've done these past few years has been for me?"
Sherlock curls himself even tighter around the curve of John's arm, pressing his cheek to the muscle of it. He can not help it; he laughs, he smiles and swallows and silently laughs into his arm, and he feels even lighter when John finally softens to smile back.
about it that I couldn't do anything but be mad at you. I got engaged because you seemed perfectly fine without me and I wanted to prove I could build a life without you, even after I realised I'd probably be happier breaking off the whole damn thing."
Sherlock harrumphs, his sharp eyes rolling at John. The look on his face answers more acutely than any words ever could, and John grins back, acquiescing. "Yeah, figured. Fine. We'll see later tonight." He leans his head against Sherlock's, kissing the shell of an ear.
"Look," he started, clearing his throat. He sounded tired. He sounded very, very tired. "I've been here a while. And--"
Sherlock stands up in a somewhat sad impersonation of his usual bounce to his feet, one leg staggering and his face in a tight grimace. John would be a tad more sympathetic, if they weren't here
John knew exactly what Sherlock had thought he had imagined. And it was with a sad, regretful pang, because it hurt, just a little, that Sherlock couldn't bring himself to believe that what had happened had been real. But John would've thought just the same, if he'd woken up just as hungover as Sherlock and remembered what they'd said on that call.
He gets dressed. He doesn't see the damn point, but John glares at him when he wears a sheet and says it's inappropriate and humiliating over Skype, and he doesn't like when he can see the dots of scars on his chest, so he gets dressed. Mostly. He wears pajamas when he can be bothered.
"Accountant now, actually. The teacher broke up with me, remember? Because you couldn't remember her name."
"You understand the condition he was in," Mycroft says finally. "I didn't see the sense in bringing you here merely to see you pace holes into the waiting room floor for the next ten hours, John."
Sherlock stares down at him with eyes that drive the breath from him. Voice or not, Sherlock Holmes' face is one of the most expressive in the world, and his eyes are daring and powerful and pierce straight through him all the way down to his heart.
They do end up at Angelo's after all, though not that same night. John insists on waiting until Sherlock's temperature has been normal for twenty-four hours before agreeing to a night out in celebration, but when the night comes, it's no question. It's Angelo's. They've always gone there often, because Sherlock dislikes
John gets ready unbearably quickly; he is, as ever, nothing if not efficient. He pulls on his coat and leaves the kettle in the sink in a clatter, pulling together his things, and all Sherlock wants to do is say
"You're a bit quiet," Greg said, upon coming to idle at a red light. They were nearly ten minutes away from campus, and John had barely managed more than a hello. "Something happen, at Cambridge?"
But the interviews are disastrous, and the head scans reveal next to nothing. Sherlock may be unwilling to communicate, but his brain is still working, behind his enigmatic eyes, and the deductions are still happening. The second the doctor hands him a collection of plastic children's blocks, to see if he might've lost shape recognition overnight and try to force a square-shaped peg into a circular block, Sherlock just about has a fit. A violent, spitting, mad fit of a tantrum. John has to desperately play to two sides at once, pleading with Sherlock to stop, stop,
Ah, well. The tabloids would've figured it out sooner or later. No sense to worry about the eventual tears over already spilled milk.
Sherlock swallows harshly, wrenching that train off the tracks. He will not lose John. He's here, isn't he? He's sitting in a bloody therapist's office, not-talking about his
He quickly exchanges a few details with Lestrade, setting up a time when he'll give his statement for the assault case that's currently pending, thanking him for helping Sherlock out, assuring him that he really is fine, he just wants to go home. Sherlock, of course, takes no part in the conversation whatsoever. He seems to be quite content pretending Lestrade does not exist, actually, no attempt made whatsoever to involve himself-- but--
yes, of course that's how this is going to play out, and he's going to feel like an idiot, and then Sherlock is going to fuss over his head and promise to do unspeakable things to the idiot who hit him, and everything is going to be fine.
"Quite." He sent a dark look back over his shoulder, red with exertion while John was left just sitting in his chair, utterly lost. "Knowing my brother, I'm sure he has been as dishonest to you about this as he could-- but if there is anything I have been able to rely on you to do, over these past several years, it is to hurt my baby brother. Did you perhaps finally tire, on your limited but still disastrous influence on his life? Did you finally decide to encourage him straight into the arms of the one person worse than yourself?"
The twitching and tapping stopped, at least. So did everything else. He sat there in the chair that John had pulled out for him, and he stared at John like he'd just been offered a glass full of rat poison. He made no move to take the glass, and in fact looked like had no plans to, either. For one horrible,
He vaguely recognised the look in Sherlock's eyes-- it was reminiscent of how the boy always seemed to look, at his most intoxicated, but this was... more, somehow. The hostility, the primal, aggressive hostility. He was like a wounded animal, licking its hurts in the corner and ready to lash out to prevent any more.
Mycroft hmmed quietly, and returned to his cup of tea. He sipped once, his mouth reduced to a flat, strained line. "It was several months after this," he went on, quietly again, "in August of his final year, that I was contacted. Sherlock had been hospitalised."
He's frozen on the spot. He gulps for air, John can see it from here, one hand clutching at his chest while the other is suddenly shaking, hanging onto the counter for dear life. Combined with having staggered himself into an A&E, a panting and clearly desperate wreck, now he looks like he might just be having chest pain or an anxiety attack, and the receptionist is looking as if she's torn between calling security or a doctor. It's not helping. It's not helping Sherlock's state at all.
John folds his arm around him without waiting for anything more. Sherlock is bigger than him and unwilling to move his arm and they're sitting on rough and pointy gravel, but he pulls him into as close a hug as he can make it. He catches his fingers in his hair and nudges Sherlock's face into his shoulder, and it's a sign of just how
He logs into Mrs. Hudson's youtube, and sets a playlist of an English pastry cooking channel on shuffle. She's currently on a French kick, and hopefully this'll put something that he actually wants to eat into her recommend.
"Yeah? Well, you ought to be ashamed of the fact that you just broke into someone's flat and apparently turned me into a sodding accomplice, but here we are." He yawned, a long, jaw-cracking yawn, and shuffled some of the papers into his own lap, complete with a side-eye at the cup of tea.
"J'hn terrifies me, Mycroft. I can't-- Oscar makes me sick. I can't stand him. I d-don't, don't care what he says about me, what he thinks. But John--" Sherlock stuttered in another heavy breath, his words stumbling. He was barely intelligible at this point and John clutched the phone closer, biting his tongue.
Sherlock does cooperate willingly enough, after that. He eats the three biscuits, and accepts the cup of tea with little more than a small, contented sigh. It's a bit of a risk to sit next to him, but John takes it anyway, and after giving him a few moments to get used to it, he risks curling an arm around him.
of whispering to John from rooms away and in the middle of the night because he is so scared of this.
At one point, stretching around from his abdomen across his right hip to his spine, were once letters, traced by the sharpest point of a knife:
"Four are dead," he murmurs at length. He splays one hand out along the sheets, his fingertips trailing very close to one still, cold arm. "My agents were under orders to take them alive, but two were killed in the resultant shootout, and the two others that were present in their approach committed suicide with cyanide pills. They appear to have had military training. It is unfortunate, but--"
Because Lestrade was looking at him, now. The way John often did when he was losing his patience, suggesting he'd said something stupid, or Not Good. Like there was
He also decided he would very gladly look the other way if Sherlock took the opportunity to trip him on his way into the office.
It is the perfect plan, he thinks. Gavin, Gary, Graham? Lestrade-- Lestrade has already seen him at much worse than he has been exhibiting this entire past year. Lestrade had known him when his veins were more cocaine than blood. This, this pathetic inability to
Mycroft stays with him until John gets home. Sherlock can not honestly say if it is necessary, or appreciated.
"I know I said otherwise before, but... the only reason I was even with Mary was because of you. Most of the time I was with her, I could only think about how much I missed you. How sorry I was that you were dead. And then you came back, and- you were such a bloody
John's own smile grew strained. For just a moment, Sherlock's low, self-assured voice echoed in his head.
The only course of action from here is to shut the door on this entire conversation. Sherlock should go back to his room right now, he should tell John he's tired and wants to rest, and John is a good doctor; John will let him do it. He should shut the door and turn out the lights and tomorrow change the subject permanently and that will be that.
Sherlock started to pull away, lifting his head up to stare at John with wide, indignant eyes. "I've never--"
John lets out a long, heavy sigh, again covering his mouth with his hand. He looks away and his shoulders sag, whatever tension there was between them failing with it. "We've gone and cocked this up good and proper, haven't we?"
"Hmm." Sherlock did, indeed, hold still, perfectly still, his eyes tracking John's every move. Sea-green, today.
"...Right." Lestrade hesitates, glancing up the stairs after to where Sherlock has disappeared. He clearly is unsure of what to say, the situation not one that exactly lends itself to easy explanation, and he chews on his pen. "So, he's still..."
John moved carefully closer, just close enough to close his fingers over his. He didn't realise how tightly he was clenching the paper until John's fingers brushed his knuckles, softly loosening the fist he'd formed around the letter. "Like I said, I didn't think you'd want one for yourself." His voice was low, again, almost gentle. "If I was wrong, Cambridge is willing to talk with you, too, but-- I didn't want to get your hopes up about Victor's. Not until I was sure they'd come through."
"She probably knew that. She probably knew that you didn't love her anymore. That you might have been able to forgive her for lying to you, but not for hurting Sherlock, and that you never would." She set her notes aside again to look at him without any other distractions, because this was
Well. To be thoroughly exact, or quite possibly just pedantic, what he really wishes is that he just weren't like
shouldn't have shown up here without warning, damn it, without actually giving Greg the chance to brief his team.
The seconds tick by. The noises of the hospital fill the silence, footsteps and files and the distant clicks and beeps of monitors, but between him and Mycroft there is nothing but a dead, sickening quiet. Mycroft sits there, looking down the corridor after his brother, and John waits, hot anger building in his chest and the urge to scream along with it.
Sherlock scoffs again-- silent, always silent-- and resists the urge to toss his fucking phone across the room.
Now was not a safe time, for him to be holding something so tiny, fragile, and full of steaming hot liquid.
He comes up the stairs like a soldier into a warzone, his each and every step radiating tension that they can both hear even from all the way upstairs. "Mycroft," John starts, standing stock still in the doorway and staring between the two of the them with a wariness that suggests he worries a bomb might go off in the flat. He looks ready to throw a punch.
John jerked upright out of a half-doze, clutching his glass and his phone back to his chest to blink furiously in the dark. No messages still. 10:45. That was late enough to be a very good date, not so late that--.
Shockingly, there is no mysterious swollen tonsil that only the Queen's physician had been able to see.
"It's just--" he rushed to justify, "I know you hate how it feels, and it might be a week or two more until your hands stay steady enough. ...it's only if you--"
If Sherlock had wanted to allow any of those questions, he already would've written their answers down.
his entire life, to grind his teeth, and bide his time, and it was all supposed to be for this day. University was when he was finally supposed to find people like him. University was where he was supposed to finally slip out from Mycroft's thumb and shadow, and to not be
raw this morning. It was true. He slid his fingers underneath his scarf, palming the hot skin of his throat, tender and still upset with old bruises. Oh, John really was going to throw a fit at this one, wasn't he? Doctors alway tended to get very fussy about injuries in such a delicate place, and John had already proven to be especially wary about injuries to Sherlock's person in general. He...
Sherlock breathed in again, the air warm against his neck. He held John's gaze and did not look away.
It's impossible and then it's only difficult and then it's easy, and then there's even more. It's no longer just one exchange, it's a
He's played it longer than he's been able to talk (though, admittedly, this is because this is not the first time he has lost his voice. Laryngitis. Experiments. Redbeard. Et cetera). It is
"I understand your point," he said finally, voice almost too low. "Intellectually, I mean. But... oh,
He inhales again. He keeps his eyes shut, and he inhales his violin, and the skull, and Mrs. Hudson's tea, and Redbeard, and his voice, and John. John,
You are perfectly fine exactly the way you are. But--" He moved closer to him still, holding Sherlock's gaze even through how clear it was that he wanted to break away. "But
"One last thing, actually-- I was wondering, do you have any idea where Dr. Oscar Wilson might be? I stopped by his office earlier, and he wasn't in."
and he has to lie here awkwardly wanking himself off in bed like a teenage boy because he can't let John do it. He needs control, and that is not control.
But Sherlock's fingers fly, too fast for John to discern, and Mycroft pales again. He glares at Sherlock, suddenly angry in his own right, and the hand draped languidly over the armchair tightens into a fist that scratches the leather. "You wouldn't dare, brother mine."
Sherlock nodded back, saying nothing. The tight grip of his fingers into his jumper was words enough.
She whined quietly, blinking up at him. In a reflex, it seemed like, she pulled the soft toy she was sucking out of her mouth, and reached her arms up to him instead.
Experiments will only keep a restless Sherlock occupied for so long, and they passed that line more than several weeks ago, well before he was in any sort of state to go leaving the flat. Now Sherlock is suffocatingly bored, and looks at his microscope look like it has just personally insulted his mother. Or his coat. He is angry, his face furious and his temper on a knife's edge, and he stomps around the flat and doesn't sleep or eat or speak. He turns away private clients, because he proclaims that his brain rots into mush in the time it takes John to translate out one sentence of what he wants to say. He is in constant pain.
What the hell is wrong with him?! He eats serial killers for breakfast, regularly spars with the British government, and took down
You have every right to be angry with me, please just listen. You can do whatever you want after and I'll probably-- I'll probably deserve it, but
His hands swallow Sherlock's, then move up his arms, tracing up to his shoulders and grasping his shirt to ruin. He stands and this time Sherlock's the one to follow him, and they stand there together with John clutching his shoulders, and he looks so torn that Sherlock wants to physically erase every bit of it from John's face. He wants to permanently erase anything that could ever make John look like that ever again.
It's more sentiment than he knows what to do with and it's overwhelming. He's sitting on the floor with his hands suddenly clammy and his chest tight, and he's about to
he cried. "They wouldn't get us the new one at Eton, they didn't want to train us to use it, but here it is! Just like the catalogue!"
Assuming there aren't guns involved. Angelo does get a tad bit annoyed, when there are shoot-outs on the street outside his restaurant, but... other than that. Perfect.
He suddenly spins to face Sherlock, breathing even faster now, each one a shallow and desperate gasp. "I'm so sorry! I'm so
John nodded, chewing on the inside of his cheek. "That's normal," he told him, keeping his voice patient. "Stay sitting up. With all you've had to drink--"
Mary had bloody shot his best friend, and it had taken him until he'd watched that goddamn video and heard her send Sherlock to hell to finally realise that he'd never actually forgiven her for it.
"Why don't you try the blue one?" He tried not to look too closely at the lean line of Sherlock's back, or at the closet beyond it. It hardly mattered. Sherlock looked amazing in just about everything that he owned, and just about everything that he owned looked like he'd lifted it off a magazine cover.
John stands in the kitchen for the space of three more measured breaths, his shoulders tense, each one a moment of forced calm. When he spins back around it is again with military precision, his eyes gone stormy and cold as he paces back to him, and the look on his face is entirely ex-army doctor.
John raised an eyebrow, barely able to hold back a snicker. That was perhaps the first compliment he'd ever heard Sherlock pay his brother, in all the years that he'd known him. "Mycroft. Who broke into the flat last night to search for drugs that you weren't on and that weren't here, and traced you on his second phone, and then called his army of secret cars to ferry us around the city."
The tense silence that had suffocated his flat with Mary by the end, broken only by Rosie crying in the middle of the night, was not.
He breathes it all in and collects it into the space around his heart where he can feel it and not let it go.
"John," he said, and sat there, stretched out in his armchair, a bundle of dressing gown and stubble and Mrs. Hudson's afghan, and he looked positively
At fifteen minutes to eleven, just before John had been about to finally call the entire damn evening a wash, the door downstairs to the street creaked open.
"I needed to talk to you-- to say something-- about what happened in the morgue, Sherlock. About what I did."
It is a map. Of the grocery store. For him. Because Sherlock could just as easily find the required items by mutely pointing at them on the list and dragging a cashier about the store with him, but that requires
"We both seem intent on making a mess of things, I think," he says. He does not let go. "So I'm going to try not doing that, this time. I figure if we can catch serial killers, we can manage at least that much. Sherlock- the most important day of my life was the day that I met you."
John is already, clearly, shaping up for an argument. It's probably not a good thing for Sherlock to try and provoke a second one.
Sherlock blinks again, still filtering through volumes and volumes of information. None of it shows on his face anymore, his features shifted back into a restrained, careful mask, but he nods slowly once, finding his footing.
Sherlock went perfectly still, revulsion prodded into his chest. It felt like he just been punched in the stomach.
Sherlock stared at him still, his face bleached as white as the milk in his tea and his blue eyes sickeningly huge. For a moment, he wasn't sure if he'd even been heard at all.
He stands there for several moments, wordlessly looking at Sherlock. His eyes are narrowed and searching, examining him for any signs that he might be coming down with something; a fever, chills. Sherlock briefly considers flinging himself back down into the palace just to avoid
for him to hear. "You were incredibly unhappy, John, and while some of those feelings might've been related to how you felt about Sherlock, the root cause of it was that you were married to a woman that didn't care about you. You've said yourself that you felt ignored, belittled, and brushed aside. You didn't feel that she ever took you seriously, and you've said that if it hadn't been for Rosie and Sherlock's encouragement, that you'd never have gone back to her. You've also said that you wished you hadn't." She paused for another long moment, her eyes kind. "That doesn't sound like a happy or healthy marriage, John."
It's that endearing and bit creepy thing he does, when a very crucial and important wire in his brain somewhere trips and leaves him sputtering on an emergency systems update. He sits there and blinks and just stares at him, a connection gone faulty and a team of little Sherlocks in his brain is hard at work rewiring it. He stares up at John with his brilliant eyes fluttering, for just long enough that John knows he's too sleepy to parse his thoughts.
John agreed full-heartedly. Even though just about every contact here had been initiated by Sherlock-- even though the date itself had ended, again, after
But this had been Sherlock's only real relationship. His only experience with what a romantic relationship would be was emotional manipulation and sexual abuse. Maybe he'd had something better with this Victor, maybe not, but--
Sherlock swallowed a bite that tasted like cardboard, and wrangled another strained smile. It felt like he was fishing the words from molasses. "No. I have the funds and facilities to research without anyone's support, and my interests wouldn't be very well supported by a university's lab." Which meant his kitchen, and his trust fund. Oscar didn't need to know that. Oscar also didn't need to know that the majority of his experiments included some variety of mould or amputated limb.
"Evidence currently suggests there are two others," Mycroft admits at last. "They were not present in our raid."
pillow, and he's bone-tired, sore and cold all over, and the cab ride home has moved a sharp throbbing back into his chest, and he has never felt better in his life.
for has gone brittle, and his fingers clench even tighter around his. "You wanted me to go back to Mary because you thought that was best for me. Even after finding out she was a bloody assassin, you still thought I'd be best off if I stayed with her- and I know you liked Mary, before, but that's not why, is it? It's not that you think Mary is all that great, after she bloody
he kisses him until Sherlock is breathless for the second time in as many minutes, and he feels John smile against his cheek and his fingers again curl in his hair. "I love you," John rasps to his ear, and Sherlock signs it back into his chest. He will always sign it back. It is an inescapable, incontrovertible fact of life that Sherlock Holmes loves John Watson.
They have established something that tries at being a regimented morning routine. As close to a routine as Sherlock Holmes and John Watson can get.
John," he moaned, sunk down to the table with a miserable thud of his own. He covered his face with his hands, as pitiful as a genius consulting detective could look. "Of course it was fake. A wilted, dead plant would provide no incentive whatsoever towards giving you a reason to not leave."
Because Sherlock had now started to unbutton his current shirt, his dressing gown already shrugged off to spill around him in a pool of blue silk. If helping him
He left Sherlock sitting there alone in the lab, icepack dripping and forgotten in his hand. His mouth felt cold and wet, and his head felt a little like a box of marbles that had just been rattled within an inch of its life. But inside his chest, he only felt light.
Mycroft closed his eyes for one long second, breathing in deeply. It was clearly taking an astronomical effort to reel in his patience. "Fine. Yes, brother mine. I am extremely upset with you and you are never going to hear the end of it. But not right now. Sherlock, where are--"
It was a good thing that John was already sitting down. Because if he hadn't been, then he might've fallen over, right about now.
The flat looks perfect. John's chair is still where he'd left it, that night he'd been carried off in an ambulance, impeding the path to the kitchen. The Union Jack pillow is back there, too, where it belongs. John's laptop is on the desk underneath random bits of paper and debris, turned on and halfway through proofreading a blog post, likely a perfunctory update that the hat detective is recovering well and a request to be left alone in these difficult times. His microscope is waiting in the kitchen, waiting with the acid solution Molly had dropped off at John's request, and his violin case has been dug out of the clutter to rest neatly against the wall.
It's hateful, and he's also freezing, and really just wants to get inside. Or, more properly, anywhere that is not
Sherlock was muttering to himself again, sounding especially forlorn and mournful. Definitely too much to drink. They needed to track him down, pour him into one of Mycroft's cars, and get him home.
"I know you're thinking, in there," he says. His nails trail gently along his face, under his eye, through his hair. "Stop it. Whatever you're thinking, it's stupid." He grins again, brushing his lips against his. "Don't look like that; it's true. You're a mad genius, but I'm getting pretty good at telling when you're being a genius, and when you're just mad. And the look on your face right now is when you're usually just mad. So I'm going to tell you again, Sherlock. I love you, and you are the most bloody incredible man on the continent. Insufferable, too, but incredible as well." He tilts his head, his tired grin in the low light turning teasing, and he licks his lips in a way that is just simply
But John insists on an answer, he always insists that Sherlock answer him, and he slides his hand to his chest to trace a check mark.
"There's really only so much I can do when you're researching German Renaissance art and I don't speak
And Sherlock insisted he had forgiven it, that he had forgiven it before John had even said he was sorry. Before he had ever promised to never do it again. But forgiveness didn't change the fact that all the experience Sherlock had with intimacy and closeness was the worst things that John had ever done to him.
There's a few beats of silence between them. Of shattered glass on the floor, and John's strong heart thudding against his thumbs.
Instead, he watched his back retreat down the other direction, and bit so hard on the inside of his cheek he nearly cut himself.
"I would have," Sherlock said sharply. John glanced at him to find him sat even more upright and his hands curled together in his lap, gone tense, as if electrified. He blinked at John and swallowed, some of the fervor cooling, but the promise underneath it held fast. "I suspected she never would, of course. I observed and didn't deduce any warning signs of potential violence directed at you or Watson. But if there had been, John. If there had ever been--"
sighed again. He looked down at him for a moment, his smile faded again, this time... displeased. Displeased? At him. Yes. He'd done something wrong, again.
John was quiet for another moment, watching him as his smile fell. "I'd also really like to write a chapter about you," he said finally. "But only if you're all right with it, Sherlock. You're only involved as much as you want to be and if you'd rather not be in it or even if you don't want me to write the book at all, that's okay."
There was silence again, just a bit more odd rustling from Sherlock, but no words followed this excessively odd proclamation. Mycroft glanced at John, frowning slightly, and moved to sit against the desk. "Sherlock, where are you?"
for why his blood pressure got so high in the middle of the night it tripped an alarm, but the truth is disgusting and not permitted under any circumstance.
John smiled back, the acerbic jab again putting him at ease. Sherlock was fine. Annoyed, sulky, exasperated, yes-- and fine.
It's even got the cup of tea and bowl of snacks at his feet. Neither has been touched. Neither had been asked for.
Sherlock spends the week with his head in John's lap, feverish, sick to his stomach, and utterly content
"Everything in balance, Scott. Though if you really must know, yes, I recommend quitting smoking if you can, without reservation or hesitation." He pauses again, the sheet crinkling in his hands. "You know, for some of my patients? Asking a stranger for a cigarette? That's the highlight of their week. That's a huge, very impressive step to take for them."
John's gaze slides downwards to rest on his chest. The scar is hidden underneath buttons and a suit jacket, he hasn't even seen it in weeks, but his eyes still darken to stormy grey.
Dr. Andrews' greeting smile faded as quickly as it had come, and its replacement was an exasperation that John already found much more familiar.
"I'm sorry if you are awake," he whispers, very close to his ear. "It's probably pretty scary, and I'm sure it hurts a lot, but we can't give you anything more. Just try and bear with us for now, love. All right? We're looking after you and it's all going to be okay."
"Right," John murmurs, voice a little high and breathless. He leans his forehead against Sherlock's, cradling his face, his eyes steady and his skin pink. "I'm only going to say this once, because I know you don't like apologies, and moping isn't going to help either of us at all, so I'm just going to say this once and then shut the book on it. Sherlock. I'm sorry for how I've been acting and how hard this must have been for you. I'm sorry that I have to sit here monologuing at you because I can't understand anything back that you want to say. I'm sorry that I haven't listened to you and paid attention to what you were trying to tell me. I love you, and all I want to do right now is to help you. If you're happy, then so am I. All we need to do is work out a new way for you to tell me I'm an idiot." He smiles tentatively, like he's not sure if it's allowed at all, and even less sure if it will be returned. One cold hand curls against the side of his face and the other drops to squeeze even tighter around his. "Okay?"
