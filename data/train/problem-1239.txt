“I would imagine that today’s events would be an impetus to speak on such a topic.”
Sherlock chuckles softly, continuing his worship of John’s neck and collar bone. “My brother doesn’t lie – in this case, at least.”
Stunned and a bit overwhelmed, John jumped up and headed to the kitchen, pausing to lean on the door frame. “I’m going to make myself a cuppa. Erm, can I heat you up some blood? Do you need anything?”
“What are you doing here, Alessandro?”
Mycroft nuzzled his neck. “You’ve just agreed to mate with a vampire. It’s a bit late to appeal to heaven.”
“So. Bonding,” Greg said after a minute of silence.
Stranger: Greg sighed and untangled his fingers, running them through Mycroft's soft brown hair, "I know. I'm sorry I worry you so often. 'S what you get for falling in love with a broken down old dog like me." He said with a sardonic smile, tracing Mycroft's cheekbone lightly.
“Irrelevant.”
You: John nearly fell apart as Sherlock pounded into him. His cock was hard and leaking onto his flat belly between them
A group of police officers began moving their way down the street towards the warehouse where a serial killer was holed up with what was likely a rather impressive arsenal of weapons obtained through mob connections. The second team took their places, and John moved backwards to give them more room. Greg glanced his way once with a nod while speaking softly into a police radio. Around John, officers stood at attention, weapons drawn.
Greg sat heavily next to him with his own pint.
You and the stranger both like johnlock, and mystrade.
“Yes, for both of us. But love, we have so much time to do so.” He pressed his forehead to Greg’s, breathing him in. “Thank you.”
“Yes.” He paused and caressed Mycroft’s chin. Mycroft swallowed and then nodded. Greg looked at John pointedly. “You can stay or leave, but decide now.”
Warning for this chapter: The blood play gets a bit more intense, but it doesn't go into the horror field.
John sat back, thinking about it, and glanced at Sherlock. The vampire looked back, unblinking eyes intent on him. “Ok. Yes, I agree.”
“No! I mean, yes, I love your finger. But…it’s – it’s not big enough,” Greg panted, face flushed.
Across the room, Mycroft is methodically removing his clothing, piece by piece, slowly baring his pale skin. He carefully lays the clothes on a chair and approaches the pair on the loveseat.
John shivers at the words, at their sensuous promise. John presses his lips to Mycroft’s, asking for more. Asking for everything.
“Ok, and Greg? Thanks.”
“Well, I suppose I have no choice….” His voice trailed off. “And John is a – decent sort of human. I just hope that Sherlock understands his responsibilities.”
“I thought you’d like that,” Mycroft said, turning the spray away after a minute.
“Look, Sherlock Holmes is a…decent sort of vampire. He’s not like some of them, thinking they can walk all over us
“If it involves me on an altar like a virgin sacrifice…”
“Savile Row,” the vampire said abruptly.
They stare at each other for a long silent moment.
Mycroft slipped into the car and sat on the seat opposite them. “Well, that was unpleasant. One of my people alerted me that he had entered city limits and I came here.”
”Listen up, Shez! You’ll never guess who I just met! Just kidding, you’ll probably deduce it in a second!”
”Prolly best to take it off for now then, eh? You can always put it back ron later.”
was just standing there, looking smug, so close to Sherlock, and John suddenly felt angry.
”No, I can see how that wouldn’t be the case. But, well, did he ever.. did you talk about… did he ever approach the subject of…”
”Uh huh.” It’s the only thing he can think of to say, since he’s still not following.
Outside, a car came to a halt. He leaped to the window, looked out. It was a taxi but it wasn't John.
, he thought.
“He sent his regards,” Sherlock said awkwardly as he put the crate down on the kitchen counter.
He should just let Sherlock be; of course he’s capable, and he realises he probably comes across as patronising. ”Call me if there’s anything I can do.”
”Snipers and Serbia? What the
, he thought,
John smiled. He could picture how Sherlock would first be all mad for a second and then break out laughing in that happy, relaxed way that he sometimes did when John had managed to catch him off guard.
”I want to. Tell you. If you… want. To listen.”
”God baby, you make me lose all control,” he panted. ”Sherlock-”
In the car ride to the house, John is quiet, mostly because there is no chance to cut in. He’s in the back seat, leaning forward to listen to Sherlock and Caroline talking non-stop in about equal measure. They seem to know each other fairly well, John can see that Sherlock is not putting on an act with her, but is just being himself. For good… and for bad.
, after all, his best friend, the man he’d shared his life with for longer than he ever had with any girlfriend. Hell, longer than with Mary even. Each time John looked at Sherlock, he was overwhelmed with emotion. God how he’d missed him!
Dear friends, here are the final four chapters, and a brief epilogue. How will it all end? :)
he told himself. Sherlock had treated it like a joke.
”Sherlock,” was all he managed to get out.
When he saw Sherlock opening his mouth and closing the last inch of distance between them, he almost felt like he was going to pass out. Then, the intense heat as Sherlock took the head of his cock into his mouth.
”Seemed like a good idea at the time,” Sherlock mumbled back. This was a walk in the park compared to the monster comedown crashes he’d experienced in the past, but that he kept to himself.
”You alright?” John asks. Something is clearly wrong, but he’s unsure if it’s still because of the dog, or.. or something with this photograph?
a need for so called catching up. Can’t deduce details in the past like that, and John certainly can’t deduce things if his life depended on it.
John laughs a little. ”Still a difficult patient, huh?” and is happy when he gets a faint smile and a shrug in return.
By now, he was completely hard. John kept holding him down; he leaned forward and kissed his neck, let his teeth scrape it. Sherlock felt a drop of pre-cum trickle down his shaft, landing at the soft skin at the base. He’d made a last minute decision to get rid of his pubic hair completely at his most recent waxing appointment, and John had seemed to like it, once he’d gotten over his initial shock that a bloke would actually go to someone for his
The fact that John wouldn't look up as he spoke, was a clear indication that he thought this was really difficult. It was quite unlike John, to be this – whatever he was? Embarrassed, maybe? Ashamed?
Maybe she isn’t completely senile yet, because she stops herself, possibly because she managed to notice Sherlock’s angry stare. ”What about your family, John? Did you have any Christmas traditions?”
It had been a given, really it had. He'd known that this was going to happen, one way or another, but that hadn't been enough to hold him back. Oh no. Of course he'd had to push ahead anyway, into things that were bound to come back to hurt him.
”I’m not straight,” Sherlock says.
John took a small, and perhaps ever so slightly sadistic, pleasure in watching as the expression on Gabriel's face changed from close-bitten to shocked when he noticed John.
And despite all the things he can’t stand, this time is different. Returning to the sitting room, he looks around for John. Finds him cornered by a distant aunt that Sherlock has forgotten the name of. Edna? Alma? Never mind. John’s here,
Yes. Made sense. Sherlock felt a little bit uplifted, even, by this crazy idea.
Sherlock looked so very pleased with himself, but John was only listening with one ear. He was too busy remembering what it had been like to be in bed with Sherlock that one night. He wondered what he could possibly do to maximize the chances of that happening again.
Despite it all, this makes John chuckle. ”Sorry, no can do.” He puts his phone back into his pocket, nods towards the front door. ”Come on, then.”
* * * * *
Hears John chuckle. Christ, how can he be so… so
”Tell you what. You get out of that wet coat of yours, and I’ll make the tea, alright?” John said, and Sherlock obliged.
One Friday night in July, a creeping dread had come over John, as he was sitting in front of the telly in the sparsely furnished guest bedroom, eating dinner straight out of the take out bag. He couldn’t shake the feeling. He needed to know how Sherlock was doing.
Sherlock immediately started to mimic the rhythm of John’s hand, never breaking their ongoing kiss.
, John, wait right here! I have something in the back that your Signore will like!”
”Have you decided to leave?” Sherlock mumbled.
He stood up from the sofa, too hasty, his leg bumped into the sofa table and caused the glasses there to wobble precariously for a second. Thankfully they didn’t tip over. He was careful not to meet John’s eyes.
. It dawns on him. The thought of the two of them, together - as in,
”I don’t know, John, you tell me,” Sherlock mumbled and then they both broke out snickering.
John did not like where this conversation -or rather, monologue- was going. Not one bit. And the worst part was that he was running out of arguments. He felt like he was falling.
By the way the Sherlock was looking, John wasn’t expecting much sensible conversation, but then Sherlock suddenly reached out to put his hand on top of John’s that was still pressing to his neck. He stared at John with wild, disbelieving eyes.
”…and if she wakes up, I don’t think she will but if she does, try bringing her here, she likes the sound of the telly, but please keep the volume fairly low. And I will have my phone at hand the entire time - did I give you John’s number? Okay, good.”
“John-”
Moves into place between Sherlock’s legs, then takes himself in hand to line up. When his glans presses bluntly against Sherlock’s hole, neither of them can be quiet.
John can barely think about what Sherlock might make of this, because… Sherlock
”Haven’t gotten a formal offer yet,” John says. ”But that’s a good question. I have a feeling that Mary might be open to move back, as well.”
“John?”
Sherlock recognized the signs of John getting close to climax, too. It seemed like he had deduced this a few moments before John realized it himself, because shortly after, John froze.
Sherlock gasped for air as he did so, and John suddenly felt bad for him. He really was more for giving than receiving in bed, but this.. this was just too damn good to pass up on, and after all, Sherlock seemed to like it.
John sighs. ”It’s New Year’s Eve. You should’ve given yourself some time off, instead of spending it running around town chasing criminals.”
He heard steps approaching. Mrs. Hudson opened the door, wrapped in a purple dressing gown, looking ten years older than usual. John immediately knew something was very, very wrong.
”Wow, impressive. Quoting Churchill, are we?”
John had switched his phone to silent, but it vibrated when three texts appeared in quick succession.
John couldn't wait another second.
There, he’d said it. No taking it back. He didn’t want to take it back. He wanted Sherlock to know.
”Mmm,” he says. ”The day. Not the fun.”
”Decomposing body in the tub. A bit not good?” said John, trying so hard not to laugh, but failing when Sherlock looked at him and grinned.
John wiped his mouth with the back of his arm, then slowly got up, leaned over Sherlock in his chair. Sherlock opened his eyes, and John noticed he looked a bit lost.
Sherlock knows he doesn’t mean anything malicious, that it’s just small talk.
”I want to feel more of you,” John whispered to his mouth. “Can I get you out of these?” He tugged at Sherlock's trousers.
”Oh fuck,” John gasped behind him. ”Oh my god, Sherlock. I had no idea…”
. Sharing John with someone else, it would tear him apart.
”I’m sorry we had to keep you fellas waiting for so long,” one of the officers said. ”If you’d like, we could give you a lift home. No weather to be out walking in, tonight.”
Here's some military slang for you, just in case.
”Oops,” he said.
”John?”
he wrote back.
“But you want... that,” Sherlock said slowly. “The wife and the two point one kids and the-”
He noticed the ashtray on the sofa table, brimming. Slowly, it began to dawn on John just how gruesome this evening must have been for Sherlock. How he had waited for John to show up, and at some point probably decided he wasn't going to. Thought John had let him down.
He made a mental list.
”No, s’ true. Was abar your age. Well hooked on beak at that time, was a proper circus.”
* * *
”A queen?” the girl said.
John's naked torso against his own;
He grabbed Sherlock by the hand, and led the way down the corridor past the kitchen and into Sherlock’s bedroom. He ripped away the cover and the duvet, and then gently lowered Sherlock down on the bed. He guided his head to the pillow, stroked a stray lock of hair out of his eyes and shot him a smile. He felt so happy he could cry when Sherlock returned it.
It was almost the end of his first semester, exams approaching rapidly. Of course, he wouldn’t have to worry about that kind of stuff, not like others would. He already knew everything of this topic, being the undisputed best of his class. There was one person as close as it can get behind him. Would John have to worry about learning? He seems like the person who studies much, trying to be one of the top three. Sherlock would be more than willing to help him remaining his second place.
Just play it cool, let him see that you’re interested.
“Your name is Sherlock, right? I’m John.” A small smile and kind blue eyes hit him hard when he met John’s look.
They didn’t talk after this little conversation and just a minute later the lecture started. Which was actually good, because Sherlock – who always knew what to do – didn’t know what he should have said, if the other wanted to keep conversing with him.
reason he was willing to suffer this torture voluntary.
When the lecture ended everyone was quick to their feet, wanting to leave the room as soon as possible, probably to get to the next class or to their dorm. It was still storming outside.
His gaze shifted through the slowly filling room, not yet spotting his reason. Most of the people weren’t worth his attention, sipping their Starbucks coffee and scrolling through their phone, waiting for the lecture to start.
Several stares were on both of them, some irritated, some just looking why people were talking. One girl who sat in front of John started roaming in her pink pencil case, searching for the needed pen to lend it to John.
Having neither of these two reasons himself he let the professor talk to him, even let her praise him for finally paying attention. It seemed in the way she talked about and looked at him that he was one of her favourites, getting the average of the class higher as other classes.
That staggering smile hit him again and made him speechless. “Thank you.”
Letting his eyes scan the room again Sherlock saw that the first front rows were all full, while the back was only half filled. So there was plenty of seats left, but since he knew where John always sat, he got why the man said that there were no seats free anymore. The one besides Sherlock was the closest to the front as he could get.
Honestly, he just sat here because he had to. Since he already knew the last bit of his study book, there really was no reason for him to sit here and suffer under the boring voice of Professor – what was her name again? Well, it didn’t matter anyway.
“No problem.” He really didn’t know what he should say. This came out of nowhere and he wasn’t used to talking to – God, he sounded like a hormone controlled teenager – his crush. At least he wasn’t blushing again.
“Yeah, but they’re both empty.” The other fidgeted with the end of his sleeve.
He held the gaze for a second, then scanned the others desk, which had a book, a notebook and two pens on it. “You seem to have one?”
His heart had skipped a beat before it went on at almost double the pace. “I have an umbrella with me. So we could go outside. Dinner?”
“Oh, well, sure,” he quickly answered, not wanting the girl to give her pen to John, so holding his own one out to him.
“Sorry to bother you again,” he whispered, catching Sherlocks eyes with his. “But do you have a pen to spare?” A slight smile followed his request, probably wanting to cause sympathy and had Sherlock give him what he wanted.
Opening and closing his mouth, not knowing what to say, Sherlock was sure he looked like a fish on land. What should he do?
John looked outside one of the big windows on the corridor side without classrooms. “Geez, it’s still pouring. We can’t go outside like this.”
Their way out of the department store is quicker, the crowds having dispersed after closing hours. They stop just outside the main entrance. John’s hotel is in Covent Garden and Sherlock is heading home. It’s gotten colder, and Sherlock puts his hands in his coat pockets to warm them.
, he writes, considers adding a smiling face but refrains. Sherlock doesn’t reply, no typing dots either. John keeps glancing at his phone the way back to the hotel, and then all the way up in the elevator. When he’s entered his little room, the phone finally chimes again.
John had experienced panic attacks before, but only ever related to his post traumatic nightmares. Now, however, he was praying that his body wouldn’t launch him into one right there at the table. He felt the all too familiar symptoms coming on: racing heart, tunnel vision, a feeling of constriction in his chest. He reminded himself that these were normal and completely harmless sensations, tried to not let anxiety spiral into full blown panic.
… quite dark.”
“Didn’t hear me then?” He wondered aloud.
a game, all of it…
Not really realising where he was any longer - home, mind palace, wherever, doesn’t matter - and noticing nothing but music and dizziness, he drifted off again.
Silence. Sherlock knew he had to say something. Anything. Deep inside he had known all along that it would come to this. He had feared it. He had hoped for it. He swallowed.
That's what Sherlock was thinking about while making his way back. It reminded him of relentless stubborn persistent John. John who kept going regardless what crossed his way, John who got shot, who got hurt, who had endured loss so many times but kept going and going anyway, always putting himself in harm's way. Invincible John. He had to protect him. Sherlock had to protect this exceptional man from himself, from his own foolish life choices. He had to protect him from Sherlock.
"Well, you said sofa and there're no blankets. Mrs Hudson took them. To clean them or something equally tedious."
"I won't go anywhere either."
“How did you even do that? Jeez…,” John couldn’t believe his eyes. He ran a hand through his own hair, still staring in horror.
So, he had no other choice than to make it work, carry on. Although he refused to move on. Never again. But his life kept crawling forward and he had to decide what to do with it. There weren't that many options and at the same time far too many. And none of them was the one he desired. It didn't matter though. He could hardly travel the world hoping to coincidently spot a head of ebony curls at a random market in Samarra. This was actually the only desirable thing to do right now. Get away himself. At least try! No matter how insane it was. Only... there was no way he would be able to put these thoughts into action... without work, without money, without destination.
“Same reasoning as with the hand sanitiser, John. Do keep up.” Sherlock said bored, as if John were the one not getting the point.
“Good. That’s good.” John looked at the sheets in his hands and sighed in relief.
“Doesn’t make sense, John.” Sherlock stated.
At first Sherlock didn’t move much and John  wondered if he maybe had changed his mind. But then he started tapping his heel in time with the beat and leaned slightly forwards over his bent knee towards John. His body minisculely rocking, absorbing the music, the little nods and shakes of his head indicating that he was sinking deeper into the pool of his emotions; that he was entering an area reserved solely for occasions like this. All the while he held John’s gaze, his eyes telling him
******
“Promise?” John waited for confirmation.
His knees giving in. Struggling. Tumbling.
that door still open, though? Didn't they slam it shut a thousand times? A long time ago? What was he waiting for? For the universe to stop being lazy. For the stars to align. For just one more miracle. Because John Watson loving him, wasn't merely improbable, it was impossible, so it could never be the truth. It wasn't just fear he was afraid of. It was dread. It was horror. He would never survive watching John Watson inevitably move on again.
"Mycroft, really. I don't know what got into you, but I have no time for this display of domesticity." He said while slowly standing again.
“Ah, John, good. You’re back.” Sherlock heard Mrs Hudson slightly out of breath, trying to keep her tone light.
He had never heard Greg call Molly by this nickname. But then, he hadn't seen them lately. Not together at least. He had avoided their early-love-infatuation. He kept telling himself that he wanted to give them space, but in all honesty… he couldn't stand it. He looked around, took in the situation and realised
John was only slightly aware that he was taking little steps forward, as if trying to hold Sherlock back, to follow him where he was going. Already, he was nearly stepping out into the light, revealing his presence. He wouldn't be able to hold himself back much longer.
"Are you quite done?"
John was in no way surprised that Sherlock had fallen back to relying on someone else's words. Sherlock was even worse with words than John himself. What John heard though was only confirming what he had suspected.
“Of course.” Scott rumbled, seemingly slightly offended at the notion it could be any different.
"I know," John would answer before sealing their lips again.
"Mister Holmes." Greg countered impishly, obviously enjoying himself.
From that day on John started to feel like a childminder. He called in sick to keep Sherlock entertained.
@captain_dr_smarterthanhelooks You two are so sweet! This is like a community dream coming alive! I’m SOOO happy to be of service, even if only by accident LOL!!! I wish you guys all the best and I reeeaaallly hope things work out between the two of you! You must have that tumblr-date now, it’s unavoidable (see what I did there? LOL). I hope it will result in a “fun night” together!!! OMG, I can’t wait for an update, my friend. Only if you like of course! You know the rules: only share what you’re comfortable with (BUT TELL US EVERYTHING!!!! LOLOLOL)
If anyone would have watched from the outside, they would have had the pleasure to witness two men gaping at each other as if they’d seen another human being for the first time in their life. If it would have been a movie, one would have wondered if the disc was damaged or the stream was stuck, because there was not a single movement in the room. After a while it could have been mistaken for a waterworld documentary as they both opened and closed their mouth like the carps Sherlock had tried to avoid.
to understand!" Now it was he himself, who was pleading, desperate. He was also pacing again now. When had that happened? He felt pain on his scalp and realised he was clutching his hair with one hand while the other held the phone in a tight grip. As if that could prevent John from hanging up. "Just look. Think, John. It was never my intention, but… first, the fall… all I wanted was… but then… and Mary, John. Mary!! If it wasn't for me, then…"
“It’s a disguise, John.” said the Consulting Detective, currently launching in his chair, totally unaffected.
Aimlessly wandering the streets and scarcely appealed by the mediocre establishments —
This is what they were
He slouched forward, resting his elbows on his knees, letting his head hang heavily between his shoulders. He didn’t care that his tears dropped on the coffee table and on the rug. They weren't the first tears which soaked the furniture of 221B and he was afraid they wouldn’t be the last ones…
Sherlock would never tell John if he had called him last night, too drunk to even remember all the things he had said. Of course that would also mean that John would never get to know how much Sherlock would like to kiss him as well. That however would be a shame, wouldn't it.
21 guns though was exactly the opposite.
! He did mean it. He’d always be Sherlock’s friend, regardless of the outcome of this meeting, this talk. Damn, it all sounded so bloody formal and serious. Although, maybe a bit of formality would be for the best. They’d had enough emotional mess and drama and misunderstanding. Serious it was, so serious it should be treated.
“You’d like that, wouldn’t you?” John hummed, smugly.
talk. He had to find a way!
He stopped and grabbed Sherlock’s coat sleeve. The detective turned immediately and studied John, frowning.
After that, silence. Nothing else. Sherlock found himself forced to say something. It was his turn.
*****
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock felt how anger boiled up in him and replaced annoyance and exhaustion. Didn’t John understand anything? Didn’t he see? All the sacrifices Sherlock was making for him, for John? How difficult it was for Sherlock to hold John at arm's length? How much it took him to protect John, to endure the fear that he might fail? Again!
“Thank God, I didn’ call you. Right, Ssshherlock?” He said, looking Sherlock straight in the eye.
“You’re going to do something about that, young man! Or I’ll have to whip some sense into that silly old brain of yours! And believe me, mister,” she waved an angry finger in front of his nose, “I will. I’ve not been an exotic dancer for nothing! I know my whips!” She resolutely nodded her head, let the bags with groceries nothing but thump on the floor and headed down the stairs without another word.
Tired and exhausted he collected his things, storing them away in their usual hiding place. Pulling out his clothes, he wondered what to do. He couldn’t walk through the city like this, he didn’t even have his coat. He cursed his own silliness. It would be chilly outside now. He should have known that it would get late, considering the state he had been in when he left.

She took a side glance at Greg who was poking his finger in some undefined tissue on Molly's section table.
As if to underline it John tugged on his shoulders in time with the words he was still quietly singing as if he couldn't make himself stop. It made his forearms slide over Sherlock's shoulders, his hands dangling behind his neck; John's fingers unintentionally tickling the hairs on Sherlock's nape. At least he thought it was unintentional, one never knew with one John Watson.
Why would he be happy? There was nothing to be happy about. Neither John's memories in general were any happy nor them still being present subverted his theory. He couldn't be wrong though. These were the remaining facts… it must be the truth.
"Mrs Hudsoooooon!"
“See, that’s the problem, John. That’s what I wonder, too. What if I speak up, as you say, and it’s
"Know." The mumbling now turned into a grumbling.
“Go! Please!” he said impatiently to the cabby. When he realised that the car wasn’t moving he forced himself to open his eyes only to find a gum chewing cabby gazing back at him, one arm thrown over his backrest, looking bemused.
Honestly @unavoidably-hotson, I don’t know what to say… Jeez… However, I’m off, patient calling (well yes, my username is real life related, not fictional… I’m REALLY the “medical assistant” of sorts. Army doctor actually. So.. uhm… yes, admittedly also the military lifesaver… God, I better stop talking LOL) Thank you again U-H!!! Can’t thank you enough!
“The only reason I put up with an old man like you!” The corner of Sherlock’s mouth twitched mirthfully when he turned his face back to look out of the window.
When John apparently didn’t react the way she had been anxious about, she relaxed a bit and turned towards Sherlock again. She slapped him playfully on his corset covered belly.
? They had been colleagues, they had been partners even if only in a professional way, they had been best friends; Sherlock had even been a best man for John - although he didn’t like to think about that part! But... when John said friend, did he mean
"Yes! Yes, that's it!" John nodded.
*** link to song(s) within the chapter (underlined) and in the end notes ***
“Everything alright, dear? You look a bit… well…” she trailed off, probably not quite able to conceive all the emotions showing on John’s face. When he stayed silent she added: “Where’s Sherlock? Is he with you?”
(!!! <3) as well! Love you, guys!!!
He did see it clearly now though, recognised it. He had finally found it. The life he loved. The love of his life. Right in front of him. Solid and living and real. And against all odds—loving him back.
"Sherlock… I don't…" A for Mycroft absolutely atypical hesitation and softness clouded his words, contradicting his still stiff attire.
"If you want…" Sherlock seemed to dislike the thought of it.
And yes, this is the chapter to which the story owes its name... for a reason.
Suddenly the expression on Sherlock's face changed from mildly amused and annoyed to fierce and furious. He stepped forwards, narrowed his eyes.
"Oh, don't worry, it happens to the best of us. I told you, they all leave eventually—all lives end, all hearts are broken…" the creep sighed as if truthfully empathic.
"The metrics, John. You're emphasising the lyrics in the wrong way which messes up the entire melody and rhythm of the Carol."
So they had met at the Yard and John had paid absolutely no attention to where they were going afterwards, his thoughts still revolving around the events which had brought him here. He didn't care about their destination anyway.
“I mean, if you’re not ready, if you’d rather…”
"I think it was the case of the wrecked Pirate and the drowning Captain." he said warmly.
"Mycroft. Why are we here?" He asked, irritated.
"Move your hand now, John.” Scott then suddenly instructed and John was all too happy to comply. "Firmly, slowly. The way you'd like me to suck you." How the hell would he know about the way John liked his blowjobs? Nevermind… even if he was a sorcerer, John couldn’t care less at this moment. This was far too good to think about anything else. John sighed, floating on endorphins. God, he needed more! But could this also please last forever?
So he read it again. And again.
Was he shy? Up to this point Scott had shown many faces — unfortunately not literally — but John would never have expected ‘shy’ to belong to his repertoire. It was pretty endearing though.
"*whistle*"
“You did?” What was it with Scott’s mood swings? Suddenly he sounded much more alert.
Every. Single. Time.
He turned, slowly but confident. John's heart did a little jump, skipped a beat, excited at the promise it held.
The evening went on, the dancers changed, John’s mood didn’t. He watched it all a bit detached, still pondering the question of what would be his task in this case. Did Sherlock need him to come into action somehow? Make random contact? Keep an eye on someone in particular? Did Sherlock already have a suspect? A suspicion? Any kind of clue? Dammit, why hadn’t he briefed him a bit better? Like this he had nothing to go on with. The only thing left to do for him was to watch.
It was when he nearly ran over a toddler in the aisle of the supermarket with his shopping trolley; distracted by a vain attempt to come up with a plausible argument to convince himself that it was a horrible idea after all to contact Scott again, while mindlessly throwing tinned tomatoes, frozen veg, pasta and rice into his trolley to fill up his stock as he couldn’t survive on the remains of takeaway alone; he decided that enough was enough.
"Do you think it's wise if we both…" he hesitantly asked. But Sherlock only laughed, practically jumped from the bed and tugged John up by his wrists to pull him along to the bathroom.
Puffing warm breaths against Johns still wet lips he asked: “How d’you feel about the violin?”
He felt silly, it must have been the alcohol. He had talked to
1.) Thank you. Again and still and always. All of you.
He startled himself, when he heard his own throaty voice crying out
There was silence on the phone and John checked if the connection was broken. It was not. Then after a while Scott cleared his throat.
John snorted bitterly.
his mind screamed, not able anymore to carry the words all the way to his mouth.
“We don’t want to get that dirty, do we?” Sherlock said sultry and captured John’s mouth with a kiss again.
Her hips were thrusting in an unmistakable display, always stopping just short of making contact with the stage; it couldn’t have much effect for herself. For her audience however the effect was more than most men could stand. The adjusting of uncomfortable boners wasn’t all that discreet anymore, in some cases rather bordering on indirect wanking through layers of pants and trousers. Most legs were crossed by now to hide obvious evidence. Some less modest guys on the contrary granted their dicks some extra space to extend and show off and were proudly manspreading in their seats.
John’s mind went absolutely blank in perplexity.
“I know.”
A nod.
“Well…?” He prompted. When John only stared at the ceiling, he added: “Now comes the talking part, you know…”
It could have been hypnotizing if John’s heart hadn’t been racing. He had to admit that he was stunned, he was torn, he was very much drawn to that enigmatic being recently occupying his mind.
He felt the heat of the tender skin of these plush lips against his own small ones and he had no time to make conscious decisions before he gasped at the feeling of that wet tongue he had dreamed of, flicking and sliding against his lips.
“It is
"No need, my fault." he said quickly to shoo the thoughts away like a mayfly buzzing in front of his face and laughed weakly.
... in which John is confronted with his new persona, with old friends of Miss Pirate, with an unpleasant first meeting and a very pleasant reunion.
Still, Sherlock would be able to decipher it under any circumstances. Hadn’t he studied this handwriting a thousand times and had a whole folder storing all it’s details secured in his mind palace. The notes in there may be a bit rumpled now, he mused, remembering the state of his John room.
“Slide your hand over your cock now, John. Slowly, steady hold, not too firm. Imagine it’d be my lips encircling your shaft, the cavity of my mouth enclosing your glans. Are you imaging it?” Scott asked, but John wasn’t able to articulate any coherent noises anymore and only groaned into the speaker. Luckily Scott was panting little breathless puffs between his words as well, when he continued. “When you squeeze your penis now, only a bit… Are you doing it, John?" John hoped Scott didn't expect anything other than needy grunts, because that was all he was capable of right now. "Then, do you feel the soft tissue of your palm? Lick it again, John. Make it wet and imagine it's my tongue. Can you feel my tongue pressing against your erection?"
Still the same anxious voice, John continued, “Did I say something wrong? I’m sorry if I…”
This was too much. He couldn’t do this anymore. He was exhausted.
Almost immediately, Sherlock shouted out, unable to keep his eyes open, his head thrown back, his body tensed before his hot release spilled into John's hand, into the black lace of his tightly strained panties. Through the force of his orgasm his semen stained the suspenders and straps, painted wet blotches on John's shirt and trousers.
plan."
"You're insatiable!" John huffed.
"Well, you already are, aren't you?" he said reluctantly. He had no time for this.
"Alright. But still, don't you dare die without letting me try to rescue you!"
drunk, you know? I talked to you."
Now a new day is dawning and it also slowly dawns on John that something is wrong. If only he'd know what it is. Let's see if he finds out...
John said it as a matter of fact, Sherlock didn't know how to respond. So he kept quiet and wondered if that was what John actually wanted to say.
“No to what?” Greg stubbornly kept on pushing.
"Just… don't leave me," John said, his voice almost breaking, "don't leave me behind ever again!"
Sherlock looked up at him, his hands stilled. John smiled, although a bit forced, and shrugged slightly which made the shirt slide on his shoulders, opening wider, exposing more of his skin. He was hyper-aware of Sherlock’s breath ghosting over it.
The thought of Scott actually teasing his nipples, imagining it was John, spiked John’s arousal like fuel to the fire.
Finally. That's all. That's the note.
... And true to John’s fear, Sherlock’s head snapped up and he narrowed his eyes—showing his opponent the perfect sore spot to further dig his greasy fingers in.
While trying to secure his grip on the bag and holding his phone with the other hand, John wrestled his way through the crowds of people at the underground station and shot a quick glance at the second message Greg had sent directly after the first one.
Seriously, my advice is: scroll through my and other people’s blogs, enjoy all the glory content *pun intended
John didn’t say anything, before looking out of his side's window. So apparently he had already given directions to the driver. Sherlock looked at him curiously, but John didn’t look back, apparently lost in thought.
But he was distracted, he couldn't focus. With every bit that Sherlock was swaying his hips broader, it got a bit harder for John to keep his composure.
Today he was out with Lestrade “for a pint”. Ridiculous term, that. A pint of what? Could be anything. Why not say beer? And why a pint when it never was a pint. No-one ever bothered to properly measure it, he was certain. God, he was bored.
Sherlock moaned, turning his head desperately from side to side on his pillow, his cock oozing precome and pulsing in its abandonment.
"Fascinating."
"That way my mind palace could never have been a home to my mind. I ignored the fact that even a genius brain can't survive without a heart to nurture it."
"Yeah, stop, I get it!" John, whose face was beet red by now, shouted to interrupt his partner in his lecture. "I think it's more… I don't like the thought of it… for you." he added sheepishly. He cautiously looked at Sherlock, whose expression softened slightly.
Suddenly, Sherlock's glances and gazes during that lap dance fell into place. They hadn't been meant to drive John away but to keep him close. John felt a bit sick at the thought of how thoroughly he had misjudged the situation. He was lost for words.
"What is? The flies? They're actually quite dim."
Sherlock thought irritated by himself. Yes, John missed the old times. And yes, John had cried. And yes, John was sentimental. He always was. But this was a bit too much, even for John, wasn’t it? So, what could probably cause these tears? Was it truly just melancholy about the old days John craved for so desperately? Or was it rather something like disappointment about the developments of their shared life? Maybe even regrets about having come back to 221B in the first place and expecting their former life to continue unchanged. Presumably the tears were an expression of how much John was already resigned to the failure of any prospect of improvement! Most likely it was a combination of all of it. From John’s point of view there was nothing desirable left in this way of life, so it seemed. But why... why was he still here? Why would he make them both endure this?
In the same way he finally climbed the stairs to 221b.
John licked his lips. Unaware and uninterested in who might observe his reaction, he shifted on his bar stool to make sitting and watching a bit more comfortable in his lower regions. It had only just started but this show already promised to be something special. Not only what the all too present dancing pole implied, but also a performance John had never seen before. Miss Pirate was on fire tonight.
“You… lost him?” John growled. “You, Mycroft Holmes, fucking lost him?” John raised his voice and pinned Mycroft with a razor sharp gaze, narrowing his eyes.
. Yoga guy? Or the jogger? He was quite handsome as well. Scott had to be handsome, right? With that voice? But what if he was just an ordinary looking bloke? Most likely John wouldn’t even look at him twice. What though, if
Show him how pointless his question was. Maybe that would finally do the trick.
"So. There. And now? What happens now? Why are we doing this anyway?"
exactly did you get that from?” John, already suspicious, asked with clenched teeth.
However sometimes this stubbornness was exactly what stood in the man's own way. As it was right now. The almost frantic determination with which John was trying to find him, was nothing but proving Sherlock right, was confirming all his suspicions. John wouldn't let go, wouldn't accept the obvious, unless Sherlock was out of reach. Eliminated from his life. Erased. Vanished. As very vividly demonstrated by the latest events. Despite all the precautions Sherlock had taken, John had been able to track him down. He was still trying to figure out how John had done it. How had John known where and when to find him. Beneath all the embarrassment he still felt after their encounter, Sherlock couldn't help but be proud of him. His Boswell was learning. If he had succeeded to also pick up some of Sherlock's other skills, then he might be able to detach himself from the sentiment and get through the separation unharmed after all.
In his memory were pictures of him throwing dishes against the kitchen wall, crying out until Mrs Hudson had come up, lingering in the doorway, giving him pitying looks but helpless all the same…
He spat out bitterly in his thoughts.
! But it didn’t have the desired effect, so I also used the rest of them considering my hair is…
From the softness of the mattress and the fabric of the blanket, from the familiar sounds of the London traffic and the angle of the light falling into the room he knew exactly where he was. He was at Baker Street, in his own bed, under his own covers.
It had the desired effect as Sherlock huffed out a laugh and eased back a bit, relieving the pressure with which he was leaning against John. Sherlock then looked down at himself and wrinkled his nose.
"Sweetheart?" Sherlock frowned but left himself be led without restraint.
Sherlock pushed the door open and
"Finally," Sherlock's suppressed laughter made his voice rumbling and thick. "You accepting this obvious fact makes it all worth it."
“I wondered how effective the hair softening ingredients of shaving foam are when applied on other tissue and so I had to inject it into the bronchi of the lungs Molly had provided to recreate the effect on the alveoli in case of inhaled shaving foam.” Sherlock offered, very pleased with himself.
"What, John?"
“And we’ve barely started…” Sherlock pointed out half-heartedly. “Maybe… maybe do my legs first? Can’t promise that I’d be capable of standing upright… after…”
"Working," Miss Pirate hissed through gritted teeth. "What else?"
although in his cryptic way as usual
“Sherlock, I’d never…” he hurried to contradict, but Sherlock wouldn’t have it.
"Purple suits you. Maybe you should try it at some point." She smirked and John snickered, because no… that wasn't something for him and neither did he think that Sherlock would want it. It was just so screwy to joke about him crossdressing while Miss Pirate looked at him in all her stunning beauty. It was crazy. It was perfect! It was so them.
"John, don’t be that dramatic.”
"They are quite cute, but you shine much brighter. You're my conductor of light after all."
A filthy knowing grin spread across the others faces.
Sherlock mock-muttered in his mind, pulling a disgusted face. In
John hadn't time to mentally prepare for Sherlock taking John's not yet fully erect penis in his mouth and sucking him to full hardness in no time. Sherlock didn't wait to move his lips, tightly wrapped around John's cock, up and down in an unrelenting rhythm. Hollowing his checks to increase the suction, pressing his tongue firmly against the underside, rubbing it over the precome oozing slit with every upwards move.
John only now noticed the smell of Sherlock’s cologne, smiling to himself as he recognised the even posher than usual brand for special occasions. He could feel Sherlock’s breath ghost over his skin. Their gazes were linked and John wondered if the sizzling connection might be actually physically traceable. When he realised what a Sherlock-y thing to think it was, he couldn’t suppress the laughter bubbling up. It was one of the happy sorts that rose from deep within. It vibrated through his body and only the moment he felt his shaking belly bounce against Sherlock’s he fully understood just
“... your hand on your...cock? Is that better?” It sounded like an honest question. John hummed affirmatively. Really, this man, one of a kind...
“Describe it for me.” he urged him on.
“We should watch it together someday.” Sherlock hummed, eyeing John's exposed shoulders appreciatively. “Maybe I can get some… inspiration.” And he let himself willingly be pulled closer until they were pressed flush against each other—feet bumping against feet, settling side by side, shins and calves leaning against shins and calves, knees trapping each other, thighs pressed together all the way up to their groins. The heat simmering underneath their clothes, under their skin, crawling through their veins, flared up again. John felt it unfurl and grow and flicker through his body. They were swaying slightly, unsteady, in the attempt to keep eye contact despite their closeness.
John’s heart clenched, ached with the regret of all the lost opportunities. They’d wasted so much time. They could have avoided so much pain, so much hurt. John understood, he could feel Sherlock’s suffering, the tight tangle of contradictory emotions, of regret and gratitude. That they had been allowed to find each other. That they had missed the chance to be more.
, me riding your cock?" Sherlock crooned and started to bounce on John's cock without much effect.
"Okay then, go on," Sherlock agreed, but still didn't stop.
The mobile phone still in his hand. Same position. Hand stiff and cold.
John chuckled a bit at that thought, imagining Sherlock very seriously developing spreadsheets on that topic, before his own very verifiable existent headache and the thought of Sherlock nipped his good mood in the bud.
He took a deep breath, shifted a bit on his chair, never letting go of John’s hands. He never again would.
"You seemed to like it well enough when you saw me on stage. I deduced your attraction to these breasts immediately." Sherlock commented, never faltering in his efforts.
Two days John had been back home. Close to Sherlock. Checking on him. Caring for him.
John rolled his eyes but couldn’t help but chuckle a bit. The chuckle died on his lips the moment the figure took one step forward and moved into the light accompanied by the roaring thunder of firing cannons.
One hand left the pole and moved towards her mouth, fingers resting on her lower lip and gliding from one side to the other until she slid two of them in her mouth.
John wobbled over to the bathroom without acknowledging Sherlock, who was impressed that John still knew the way. The flush indicated that he was also still able to use the loo for business it was created for and the splashing water told the same for the tap. Fascinated, Sherlock watched him making his way back and calculated in his mind how long it would take John to get up the stairs. See, so much more entertaining when John was at home. All boredom was instantly forgotten.
______________________________
The first stones to build Battersea Power Station were set in 1929 and it was in use until 1983. When it was shut down, it was immediately given a Grade II listed status (for buildings of special historic interest with as a main goal to preserve them).
"I don't want to get that dirty," he said and pulled it over his head in one movement, cursing when he realised he had forgotten to open the cuffs. After a bit of fumbling he got rid of the rebellious piece of clothing and saw Sherlock smirking.
“Fuck,” John murmurs.
“Yesss, please,” Greg breathed. “Feed from me. Make me yours again.”
Greg blinked at him, dazed, and then sobering for a moment and nodding.
Greg flushed. “Guess I decided I can put up with his weird vampiric ways for a while longer.” He paused. “Ok. Hopefully they’ve declared an armistice for the moment. You feeling ok enough to get out of bed?”
John’s erection had not wilted at all while he focused his attention on Sherlock. Now, at the simple touch of the other man’s hand, it jumps almost painfully in his pants. He grunts softly and Sherlock smiles at the positive result.
Mycroft shrugged elegantly. “It is his prerogative,” he answered distantly.
“You, my dear Gregory. I get you.”
Greg sat for a minute, thinking. “Thank you for telling me,” he said finally.
Shouldn’t he be wet by now? Or at least starting to be wet?
“Yess,” Greg hissed softly.
Mycroft gently stroked Greg’s cock. “And I
“If the head of the Holmes family has finally chosen a mate. And it seems that you have.”
“Is that for what I think it’s for?” John asked, trying not to sound slightly hysterical.
You: "So do you," John moaned. He held himself open for Sherlock.
The Registrar turned the book around. “Before we proceed, please review this page and confirm that everything is set to your satisfaction.”
“John, for all of their bluster and bite,” they both snorted, “vampires put themselves into vulnerable situations by taking on a donor to feed from repeatedly. Sherlock was right, a vampire biting a human and feeding from him, especially regularly, is a very private and personal thing. It forms a bond. The more he feeds from you, the more you’re a part of him. And if something were to happen to you, he could get hurt. Not to mention you could always simply deny him your blood. Sure he could force you, but I hear that when that happens it doesn’t taste as good and it causes complications.”
“So?” John said with a slow smile.
Your conversational partner has disconnected.
Mycroft stopped their movements and said loud enough for everyone to hear, “I give to you of myself as I take from you, so that we forge a bond that ties us, soul to soul, unbroken, undying, and sealed.”
“Of course!” John replied enthusiastically. He glanced at Greg and then blushed, looking away. It would take him a bit to get over having been aroused at watching Greg and Mycroft in such an intimate and erotic way.
Sherlock slowly ran the tip of his claw down John’s chest in various random patterns. He only pushed hard enough to cut the skin several times, and each time he carefully watched John’s face, mesmerized by the emotions that flitted across his features.
Down the street, the first team moved down the street in short spurts of movement. Above them, Sherlock moved smoothly over the side of the buildings. John was mesmerized by the smooth, alien like motions of the vampire. It was an odd sight, and John noticed some of the officers watching Sherlock’s movement surreptitiously.
“Yes, John. I do believe that this served as a sufficient introduction to sexual relations.” He turns to John and smirks.
John wondered just how fast Sherlock would heal. Vampires were very quiet about their physiology, most likely to protect themselves from the humans obtaining knowledge of their weaknesses. John knew that they could heal very quickly, that they needed human blood to survive, and that they preferred to have specific blood donors.
Mycroft’s movements were hard and fast as he chased the need to claim Gregory completely. He grasped Greg’s hips as he fucked him hard, eyes moving to briefly watch the way his hard cock bounced on his lower belly. It was nearly time. He pulled Greg up so that he was sitting in Mycroft’s lap. They wrapped their arms around each other. “Ride me, pet,” he growled softly. “Show me how much you want to be mine.”
John lightly smacked Sherlock’s hip. “Oy. Still being a prat. Do I need to spank you again?”
“Love, I asked you to stop apologizing for it a long time ago. It was necessary.”
Stranger: Sherlock nodded and pulled back before pushing his hips forward into John.
Still pinning John down, Sherlock reached over to the nightstand and grabbed the bottle of lube he kept there. He roughly pushed John’s left leg up and out, revealing his hole. John inhaled sharply at the sudden stretch. Sherlock ignored him and squeezed some lube down John’s cleft. He smoothed the lube around John’s hole and then pushed one long finger inside.
“Ahh.” John looks around the room again, taking in the details anew. “Your home is very nice. I thought you had a place in London?”
Stranger: "Erm." Sherlock nodded. "Am I doing this right?"
Sherlock was still in position, and John knelt behind him. “Well, I hope you aren’t too attached to this delightful pair of shorts, Sherlock.”
“Erm, I hear congratulations are in order,” John said, looking between Greg and Mycroft.
“Oh, we’re not at the point where you beg, love.” Mycroft licked the side of his neck.
Stranger: Sherlock rolled his eyes, pulling the pants down to stroke his cock slowly. "Better, hm? What got you so turned on? Me, sprawled out on the couch?"
Greg leaned forward and examined the burn mark behind John’s ear. “Yeah, it’s healing fine. You won’t be able to see it by the time the week’s out.”
“I do not believe that is true. You are far more than your experiences in Afghanistan,” Sherlock carefully covered John with a blanket. He ran a hand over the knot of scar tissue on John’s shoulder. “I could take that scar away, you know. I could cut you there,” Sherlock said, pressing his finger gently against the knot of scarred flesh, “and then lick you closed again.”
You: "No. A couple of times in the army. Is - is it yours, Sherlock?"
And then Sherlock groans. His arse clenches down, hard, around John’s cock as he cums. This sends John over the edge, fast and hard.
“You did research? On – vampire bonding?”
When John puts his hand on Sherlock’s thigh, the other man groans softly, eyes falling shut as if this is the most pleasurable touch he’s ever felt.
Stranger: "Whatever you want," Sherlock smiled, beginning to pound into his lover with his hands underneath John's knees, spreading them up higher.
“For me,” Sherlock echoed. Sherlock focused and allowed one nail to grow into a sharp claw. He sliced into soft flesh of his own thumb pad and allowed blood to ooze out. He then did the same to John and pressed the claw carefully down the skin behind his left ear. He ignored John’s hiss of pain and pressed his bloody thumb to the fresh wound, making sure that their blood mingled. Sherlock then picked up the sigil by the chain. It was now hot and he held it carefully away from them with one hand.
“And you’re – you’re nearly being pornographic about it, brother,” Mycroft said, shifting slightly.
Sherlock laughed softly. “No. Though I will admit that you smell divine.”
“Sorry?” John says, nonchalantly picking up a magazine and opening it.
John nodded, eyes wide.
John smiled a bit at the logical nature that Sherlock brought to ‘the situation in which he found himself,’ as he put it. John looked at the space between them. He felt a bit vulnerable, being now naked from the waist up and Sherlock was still dressed. John gathered his courage and propped himself over Sherlock, who stared up at him intently. John’s eyes went to the vampire’s lips. They were barely parted and looked rather kissable. He slowly pressed his lips against him, slowly tasting the vampire beneath him.
John blinked up at him dazedly. “Wha- oh.” He licked his lips and locked eyes with with Sherlock as he began to undo his bow tie and then the waist coat, followed by the shirt buttons. Sherlock’s eyes intently followed the movement of John’s fingers as his flesh was revealed to him. John stood up and slowly pushed off his clothes. By now he was comfortable naked in front of Sherlock, and he stood there for a moment, proudly letting the vampire look at him.
Greg swallowed and gave him an unsure smile before repeating, ““I give to you of myself
The vampire laughed. “Good. I’ve known it, but I enjoy hearing it, too.” He kissed his mate tenderly and pulled away. “I’m afraid we should return to our guests soon.”
After a moment of silence, Sherlock asked, “What do you want, John?”
Watching this interplay, John swallowed as arousal spiked in his groin. He glanced at Sherlock. The younger man was watching with open interest, as if perplexed and trying to deduce more information, and frowning slightly.
John sighed. “Well, Sherlock?” John leaned his hands on the back of a chair, fingers digging into the plush back.
Stranger: "Maybe." He smiled, moving his hand faster. "I know you wanked in the shower this morning. Tell me what you thought about."
Stranger: Sherlock watched the doctor curiously and snapped his hips forward, a harder thrust in experiment.
Mycroft patted the sofa next to him and Greg sat down with a soft sigh. “It will be fine, love. They will be as impressed with you as I have been.” He placed a chaste kiss on Greg’s forehead.
“Yes, and as I’ve said, it will only serve to agitate you. Trust me.”
Sherlock looked up at him. “It would appear that we will need acclimate to new roles.” He slowly spread
Smirking, Sherlock locks eyes with John and slowly eases the boxer briefs down, leaving him naked and bare before the Holmes brothers, who are still fully clothed. John blushes even as his cock jerks at the thought. As flatmates, he and Sherlock have seen each other undressed before. But never completely naked, and he suddenly wonders if Sherlock likes what he sees.
“And what will you do with me for the next two days to…help me relax?”
You: Sherlock's whole body jumped when Greg touched him through his slacks. He eagerly pushed himself into the kiss.
John smiled faintly and swallowed under that intense gaze. “Isn’t that why you like me?” he tried for levity.
“Please,” Melbourne said, closing the door behind them. He sat behind an impressively large desk where a large book lay open, and John and Sherlock took seats in front of the desk. “Now, I understand that you would like to register an official claim on this young man here.”
John tugged at the collar of his shirt. “Is it meant to be so tight?” he asked. “I wasn’t aware that cutting off blood flow to the neck was something vampires wanted.”
John cups his chin and kisses him again while his other hand palms Sherlock’s cock through his pajama bottoms. “Don’t worry. Stop thinking. Let me show you,” he murmurs along Sherlock’s jaw line.
You: "Need you in me," John breathed. "Please!"
Mycroft looks calm and suave as usual, pale fingers wrapped around a martini glass. He takes a sip, eyes meeting his brother’s glare. He smirks.
Stranger: "Please." He said, voice rumbling deep in his chest. "Pretty please."
Sherlock smiled and ran is thumb over John’s lips. “Trust me, John.” He swallowed. “Please?”
You: "Oh I don't know. Sometimes he doesn't even realize I'm gone. He could be hours." John grinned and carded his fingers through Sherlock's hair
You: John braced himself, moaning softly
You: john yelped, body jerking
Sherlock taking his blood in hungry gulps. He could feel Sherlock swallow. He could feel Sherlock’s soft curls tickling the side of his face in direct contract to the sharp push of his fangs.
Greg nodded. “Ok. Not too intimate. Could be elsewhere. And what does it feel like?”
Sherlock continued to feed from John, holding him tightly beneath him. When he felt satiated, he pulled back and lapped at the bite marks. His cock slipped out and he finally released John’s leg. He lay languidly next to John and casually wiped a drop of blood from his lower lip. John panted softly, looking a bit wrecked. “Your terms, John, are acceptable.” He grinned and John returned the smile.
You: "That's too bad," John muttered. And then louder, "Ok, thanks!"
“Why thank you, Gregory. I’m so glad you appreciate my skills.” He slowly pushed the tip of one finger into Greg’s back hole. He knew it was enough to tease, but not enough to actually stretch him.
“True, but honestly this is what the match is for.” Harry crossed her arms. “You can’t hold off of having kids. Mrs. Holmes would blow a gasket.” She stepped forward and touched John’s arm. “Is it – are you
Across the room, Mycroft was still lying over Greg’s lap. They both watched intently, Greg resting a hand on his upturned arse, a small smile playing on his lips.
John climbed the steps and stopped one step higher than Sherlock. “Well, since apparently the whole thing is one big secret, I’m a bit hesitant, yeah,” John said. The anger in his voice was clear.
“Are you dizzy?”
Sherlock had been standing, casually alert and leaning against the wall in the hallway when the bedroom door opened. His sharp eyes flicked to Mycroft who was the first to emerge. “Welcome back, brother,” Sherlock said with a bit of a smirk. “Enjoy your repose?”
An inner office door opened and a man stepped out. His three-piece suit was pristine and he exuded jovial confidence. He smiled at them. “Mr. Holmes. I am Stanworth Melbourne, Registrar.”
In response, Sherlock moves his hand down to the base of their cocks, pressed deliciously pressed together. He pauses and then rubs back up until he can experimentally rub his thumb over the tips. They both groan.
Mycroft snorted softly. “Oh, don’t I ever.” He quickly typed out a text to Sherlock before turning his attention to the beautiful man pinned beneath him. He ground his half-hard shaft downwards. “Now, about that
“No,” John said with a contented sigh. “Just sleepy.” He shifted against Sherlock and his eyes widened a fraction when he felt the vampire’s cock poking at him through their clothes. “You’re hard,” he whispered, nuzzling Sherlock’s neck.
“Soon,” Sherlock growled. He leaned down and sniffed along John’s neck. “Mine.” He teased his fangs along John’s neck, resulting in a thin red line of blood. “Say it,” he commanded.
“Not even to save John? How interesting.” Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Well, if you won’t be bidding on John, then I’m sure you won’t mind if I do?” Sherlock watches out of the corner of his eye as Mycroft’s long fingers begin tapping on his tablet.
Sherlock fed somewhat regularly from John, using him as a donor for blood. Just thinking of the feedings made John’s cock ache in his pants. They were erotic and overwhelming and made John feel like the center of Sherlock’s whole world. But if John tried to ask questions, to
“How often do you see him? Xavier, I mean.”
“Very nice,” he says, breaking the silence.
Sherlock whimpered. “Y-yesss.”
John calmed his breathing and shook his head as if from a fog. “Greg? Why? We’re supposed to go out for drinks tonight, actually.”
“I’m hardly a virgin, which I’m pretty sure you can attest to,” Greg protested.
Greg howled. The water hit him right at his most sensitive spot, making his anus twitch and clench, and Mycroft held it there without mercy.
“We gather the other witnesses. I will pry Anna from her conversation partners.” He gestured to where Anna was speaking with several other guests across the room. Before John could respond, Sherlock had left him and smoothly inserted himself in the group’s conversation.
“Don’t worry about your attire,” Sherlock said with a note of amusement, “We’re going there for you.”
Greg opened his mouth to respond but Mycroft said, “We do need a couple of months to make the proper arrangements. Contact certain…people.” Greg coughed and flushed when the room turned towards him. “As I said,” Mycroft continued, “we need some time to make the proper arrangements.”
“Yes, I know. And because he has been fed from
“That way!” Lestrade ran down the alley after the murderer, Sherlock, John, and a couple of other officers on his trail. They turned several corners, jumping over piles of garbage and dumpsters, and one surprised homeless man buried in a pile of rags. Suddenly, Sherlock stopped. John put his hands out, pushing off of the vampire’s solid back to keep from running into him completely. The rest continued running.
what you need,” he breathed.
“Always the politician, Mycroft. I had forgotten how slippery you are.” He looked closely at Lestrade, sniffing the air. “Not only is he wearing your claim, but he smells like you. "He took another step forward but was stopped when Mycroft bodily stepped between them. “Ah. You take better care of your pet than does your little brother.” He threw Sherlock a smirk. Sherlock snarled, lips pulled back to show his teeth in an animalistic motion.
John quirked an eyebrow. “Speaking of that, well,” John paused and drank some more. “Sherlock said you’ve been a donor for years.” He blushed and looked away. “He said you – you let yourself fed on directly. But if it's been years then it's not a part of a contract. Plus you're too old, right?”
“It would seem prudent.”
“And I won’t suggest it, love. Politically we need to go back out there. With clothes on,” he said, sitting up. He climbed out of bed and offered Greg his hand. “Shall we?”
“Sorry. He told me that it’s, um, private.”
“You know,” John said, breaking the silence, “one good turn deserves another.”
You: "No. A couple of times in the army. Is - is it yours, Sherlock?"
You: [John's eyes linger on the tight boxers for a moment] Um, yeah. I guess. Thanks. -JW
The vampire grinned maliciously and leaned down to John’s neck. He licked once at the skin, causing the John to twist away and shudder. John struggled against him and the vampire tsked softly. He narrowed his eyes and John suddenly felt…oddly tired. No, tired wasn’t the right word. It was as if he suddenly couldn’t collect the energy to resist anymore. He went limp, held up and against the wall by the vampire’s body pressing against him.
“No…just, disoriented I suppose from sleeping so long in the middle of the day. Why?”
Sherlock whined softly, hips jerking up. He nodded.
“How?” John spat out, and he couldn’t help but let the bitterness creep into his voice.
John pulled back and looked him in the eyes. “You need to be bred by your alpha? You need this cock, hmm?”
You: John gasped. "Sherlock," he said shakily. "What are you doing?"
Mycroft smiled and carefully untied him, unwrapped his toned legs from the silk and rolled him under the blankets. He pressed himself up against Greg’s back and pulled him close. “Let it never be known outside of this room that I cuddle.”
Stranger: "Mm? And then what? Because I did consider coming into the bathroom today."
“Fuck.” Greg squeezed his eyes closed and spread his legs more, shuddering as the rough material moved up and down his cleft.
“Oh John…It won’t be so bad. You’ll have the best doctors around you. Like Mrs. Holmes would settle for less. I’m sure Brandon would be willing to talk to you about it,” she said, referring to their cousin, a rather fertile omega who was currently showing the belly of his and his alpha’s fourth child. “I mean look, you - we – we’re omegas. This is what we do, right?”
“No, please don’t,” John replied. He held Sherlock’s hand over the spot. “It’s a part of who I am.”
Sherlock remained silent. He glared.
“Stop it,” Sherlock said. John jumped and looked right up into the vampire’s bright eyes.
“Good, because you need to eat, too, ok?”
“I think you’re forgetting who’s the alpha here,” John growled.
“Yeah. Well, I know that this is important to you. And hey, I benefit from it,” he said with a smile.
“But of course!” the Registrar said. “Though it would seem that not completing this would make Mr. Holmes uneasy, you are not legally obligated to do this. If you read the details of your contract, the agreement does not allow for bonds and claims made without your volition. In fact, you
“He has been sleeping, but he has begun to wake up in the past few minutes,” Sherlock said, crossing his arms.
“Sherlock,” John breathed, “I need…I need….more.”
John adjusted his tie. Again. It was a deep silvery charcoal. All in all his outfit was a bit too much for his tastes, but his future mother-in-law had been adamant that his and Sherlock’s outfits complement each other.  Sighing, he pickup a glass of water.
“It doesn’t hurt anymore,” John says against his neck.
John panted softly as the vampire licked at the puncture wounds he had made, closing and healing them with his saliva. Sherlock lay down and pulled John to rest against his shoulder.
“Ah, Sherlock. You
“And you shall have it, pet. That and more. Everything that I am and have.” He licked the thin lines of blood, healing the wounds. He opened a drawer in a side table and grabbed the bottle of lube he had stashed there when reviewing the room earlier in the day. He coated his fingers and then poured a few drops onto Greg’s exposed balls. He easily pushed two fingers into Greg’s hole, who groaned softly, working quickly to open him up. And leave him wanting.
It's been a while and life has moved on, but I did finally finish this work! I hadn't really meant to finish this but the plot bunnies danced in my head until I did. So I hope you enjoy this. Cheers.
You: (going to have to go soon, unfortunately)
With a bit of a sad smile, Mycroft puts on a silk robe and pads silently to the door. The other two men look at him, John with wide eyes. How had he forgotten that Mycroft was there?
“Ah. So you’re hiding in here.”
Mycroft used one of his claws to slice into his own neck. A line of blood appeared and began to dribble down his pale neck, ensuring that their witnesses saw. He tilted Greg’s head to the side and bit down on the tender skin. His fangs sank easily through Greg’s skin and glorious warm blood filled his mouth. He growled and gently guided Greg’s head down to his own neck. He felt a soft tentative lick to his neck and he let go of Greg’s head. As they drank from each other he began to move his hips, slowly at first and then fast and hard. He slipped a hand between them and grasped Greg’s cock, which had wilted a bit but was growing hard again.
When the door closed and they were alone, Sherlock looked at the sigil being warmed by the flames.
Greg crossed his arms. “You know, if it were me, I’d put him over his knee and spank him.” He watched John out of the corner of his eye.
You: John squirmed on the bed, pulling his knees up and shameless openeing himself up for Sherlock
“I will not fault you if you wish to leave a few minutes early,” Sherlock said tersely.
“So, gonna keep me like this all night?” Greg asked as he caressed Mycroft’s back.
“Cosa ci fai qui, Alessandro?” Mycroft asked. Lestrade lowered his gun at a gesture from the elder Holmes brother.
"That is neither here nor there, cousin. I say that it is so, and my word is final in this family. "
John’s breath hitched as Sherlock leaned down ever so close to his cock. He could feel Sherlock’s cool breath on his hot skin and he shivered. Icy steel eyes bore into him and John struggled to keep his eyes open to watch Sherlock’s fangs slowly descend and then gently pierce the side of his cock.
“Apologies,” Mycroft said, looking at John.
John focused on opening up Sherlock’s body, pushing his fingers in and twisting. And then he smacked Sherlock’s arse cheek three times with his free hand, and Sherlock cried out and came, shuddering through a sudden hard orgasm.
“Father.” Xavier. He gave Mycroft a quick hug.
Stranger: Why does it bother you? SH
Mycroft smiled and pushed two fingers in. He paused and held them still, relishing the feeling of Gregory’s body pulsing gently around him. If he focused, he could hear his heightened heart beat and the air filling and leaving his lungs.
Greg wrinkled his face in response. “Yeah,” he said with a sigh, lying back and staring at the ceiling. “Too bad we can’t go on our honeymoon right now.”
The other witnesses had found seats around the side of the room. In the center, Greg sat on the edge of the large bed, looking up intently at Mycroft’s face, decidedly not looking at the group of people gathered to watch them. Somehow, Mycroft managed to look regal even while wearing a robe. John sat on a soft divan next to Sherlock. He glanced once at Allessandro, who gave him a leer. John looked away.
Greg’s submission was nearly overwhelming in its perfection.
John keened. “Yours! I’m yours!I belong to you...” he nearly sobbed.
for a number of years now.”
“A what?” John asked, sipping his tea.
You: Mycroft walked confidently through the hospital, leaving the paperwork to Anthea, who would smooth out any issues with him leaving the hospital with Gregory in tow. He smiled to Sally as he quietly opened the door to Greg's room and closed it quietly behind him. He nearly laughed when he saw that Gregory was holding a pillow to his face. He approached the bed and gently touched his hand.
You: "You really are trying to kill me," he panted. "Didn't I say I surrender?"
John’s eyes close and his head falls back against the wall. The hand touching him so intimately doesn’t move. It just…presses, forcing him to feel. He opens his eyes. Sherlock is staring at his face intently. “Fuck, Sherlock,” John breathes, swallowing and licking his dry lips.
? Are you sure?”
“John…need….”
“Sherlock, this is very important to me. Not only that, but the tests show that John is the perfect match for you genetically. This match is likely to produce very healthy children, alphas in particular.” She looked back at Mycroft, who was leaning casually against the wall. “Mycroft, make sure your brother is at the ceremony on time.” She gave her sons a blinding smile and said, “Now, be good for Mummy and stay here while I see to the guests.”
Sherlock sat back and chuckled low in his throat. The driver eyed him in the rear-view mirror as John looked pointedly out the window, hands clenched in his lap.
want more, and you hold me at arm’s length. Literally.” John held out his left arm in demonstration.
In their en-suite bathroom, Mycroft started the shower while Greg stripped off his clothes. Mycroft did the same, and he pulled Greg under the warm spray. The DI leaned back against the wall of the large shower and sighed happily as the hot water cascaded down his bare skin.
“Does this mean you’re giving up your claim to me?” John asks, smirking just a bit. “I mean, you did pay for my company.”
John stills Sherlock’s hand with his own, the dark haired man looks up at him, a flash of doubt on his face.
At that, Sherlock grinned. Still pinning John down, Sherlock smirked and bent down to sniff at John’s face and neck. “You smell so delicious. So human. So….vulnerable,” he murmured.
When silence fell on the room, John sat back and watched the fire, Sherlock still sprawled across his lap, unmoving. They were both still hard and John waited, letting his boyfriend work out whatever problem it was in his mind.
John looked down and swallowed nervously.
You: I will be there shortly. -MH
“Why are you here?”
No, forget kissing; this is plundering.
You: Mycroft took pity and entwined their fingers. "You like it. Maybe not this part, but you do. Though I personally wish you would take better care, Gregory. I don't want you hurt - hurt for real."
“Sounds good. We brought some fancy baked things that Sherlock wanted to bring.”
Stranger: Greg nodded sharply, regretting it immediately when his head pounded again. He scowled at his fork and somehow managed to get into his mouth without incident, by the end of the meal managing to take back most of his depth perception, although he had been forced to threaten Mycroft with death by fork stabbing multiple times when he missed his mouth a bit and ended up with ravioli sauce smeared across his cheeks.
“We’ll never hide this,” John said, thumbing the obvious bonding bite on the right side of Sherlock’s long neck. There was no possible way that anyone would see that and confuse it for anything else. It screamed Stay away. He’s mine.
“So fragile,” Sherlock murmured. “So utterly…human.”
“We’ll stay,” John said, his hand splayed possessively over Sherlock’s stomach.
Greg snorted softly. He knew he should be upset over Mycroft’s interference, but somehow, after the day he’d had, he simply didn’t care. Mycroft was taking care of him, and he was ok with that. He read the message from John and his eyebrows rose. He showed it to the vampire.
When John was again impatiently pushing back as his hand, Sherlock decided that he was ready. He made sure to use substantial amounts of lubricant on his cock and pushed just the tip of it into the tempting hole that was winking up at him. John inhaled sharply at the first intrusion.
“It would improve the healing process,” he replied, his voice deeper than a moment before.
“My dear brother is, unfortunately, correct.”
You: John made tea, trying not to let his eyes wander to where Sherlock lounger on the couch, naked.
Sherlock had already begun to stalk off towards a black sedan that had appeared at the end of the alley.
You: John groaned softly and arched his neck. "That you're this gorgeous is criminal....Should I be scared?"
“How did you know that I’m planning to go? Never mind. Forget I asked. I’ll add sugar to the list.”
"Bloody tease," Greg muttered before walking back to his team.
“Social norms ridiculous?! Sherlock! You know how Mummy hates this sort of – “
Sherlock yelped at the first smack but stayed quiet through the next five smacks. John paused briefly, eyes flicking across the room. Greg nodded ever so slightly in encouragement, and he began in earnest, raining smacks down on his lover’s arse. He stopped at 12, imagining that was enough for a first time. He rested his hand on Sherlock’s arse, and was amazed at how he could feel the heat radiating from it through his shorts. What must his skin look like? John swallowed his arousal and focused instead on soothing his lover.
Mycroft lifted his head. “Now, love, we get you ready.”
Stranger: John's*
“You’ve been a prat since we came here tonight, and that’s no way to behave when you’re a guest in someone’s home.” John grasped Sherlock’s hair and gently pulled his head back so that he could see his pale eyes, knowing that the other two men were watching them intently.
You: Mycroft was tempted to lean over and lick the sauce from Greg's lips, but he doubted the man would appreciate that right now. Instead he only offered up the napkin. "How are you feeling now that you've eaten?"
Across the room, John let out a breath he hadn’t known he had been holding in. The experience of watching Mycroft and Greg bond had been surprisingly more erotic and arousing than he had thought it would be. But Greg was a friend and Mycroft was…. not Sherlock. John glanced at Sherlock and found the vampire watching him, face neutral. But John was experienced enough now to recognize when Sherlock’s sharp mind was making deductions at lightning speed. John looked away from the heat he saw in those eyes.
“Yes, John is outside of your reach,” Sherlock said smoothly, appearing just behind John.
Sherlock pulled John’s head to the side by his hair. “Bedroom. Now,” Sherlock growled. He hauled John down the hall away from the noise and pushed him into the room that Mycroft had identified. He slammed the door closed and locked it, turning on John like a predator stalking its prey.
Stranger: ((I'm so sorry but I have to go. This was lovely!))
You: That case was meant for a moron, Lestrade. -SH
“Well between you and me? It leads to the best sex I’ve ever had.”
Mycroft removed his fang quickly and then drank. He groaned at the taste of blood from such an intimate place.
Vindico: claim, lay claim to, arrogate, appropriate, assume, usurp
“I think perhaps that we should – “ Mycroft started.
Translation of Italian at the end.
these weren’t strengths. They were weaknesses. They were so…human.
Sadly I didn't mean for my chat partner for just leave like that, but oh well. It was fun. And schmoopy.
John laughed. “Ok. Fine. It feels good, ok? Like, bloody brilliant. It hurts a bit, yeah, but then it’s like I’m rushing through a bright light and he’s there with me, pulling me with him. And then when he’s done, it’s like I’m plopped back down in reality with two puncture wounds and a hard on.” Greg snorted. “And then he cleans me up and rolls down my sleeve…he’s so oddly tender. Like I’m going to break.” John finished talking, flushed, and took a long swig of beer. When he looked up again, he found Greg looking at him thoughtfully.
Greg chuckled softly at the usually composed man. He placed a finger over Mycroft’s lips. “Mycroft, what are you trying to say?”
John twists around quickly at the smooth deep voice. “Sherlock?”
Mycroft frowned, face pinched in pain. “I’m sorry,” he whispered, running his finger behind Greg’s ear.
You: He stepped under the spray and leaned his face against his arms on the cool tiled wall.
“Diceria?”
At the first smack, John couldn’t help but notice that Sherlock jumped in his arms. His hand pressed tighter on Sherlock’s flat stomach, and he idly played with Sherlock’s long neck as they watched the scene play out before them.
“Needles? What needles? He hasn’t used needles,” John said, confused.
Sherlock Holmes: Dominatrix... [looking at a picture of Irene Adler]
“Well, they’re remarkably emotional when it comes to literature. They’ve had lots of time to hang around and write, see?”
You: "Oh I don't know. Sometimes he doesn't even realize I'm gone. He could be hours." John grinned and carded his fingers through Sherlock's hair
And suddenly he wasn’t. Sherlock flipped them over, rolling them until John was looking up into Sherlock’s pale eyes, framed by his dark curls. Sherlock smirked down at him and roughly pushed their cocks together. They both groaned at the contact. Sherlock pushed his hips down rhythmically. He grasped John’s chin and held his head still as he kissed him roughly.
“Sure,” John said as he sat up and blearily shook his head to clear it. He looked down and realized that Sherlock must have removed his clothes. He pulled the covers tight around his waist when he saw that he was only wearing pants. To cover his embarrassment, he picked up the tea.
“Yes,” Sherlock said after a pause. He turned his attention to a scientific journal.
Maybe it’s a choice. Maybe it isn’t. But Sherlock moves,  sinuously straddling John’s waist. John looks up at him with glazed eyes, darkened by lust.
“Perhaps we should wait until I start to show?” He looked down at his flat belly, imagining it round with their baby.
Around John, the second team rushed down the street and into the building. He grit his teeth, wanting desperately to run into the fray with them. But a glance at the medical backup group told him that he had a duty to them should the action move in their direction. The medical people were milling around an ambulance across the way, and John stood a bit apart from them. He carefully watched the warehouse where several well-armed policemen were stationed around the door.
“Behind his left ear.”
John went very still. He had seen this look on Sherlock before, and it never failed to make him feel hunted. Prey. A thrill or fear and arousal shot up his spine and he let his head tilted back in submission.
Mycroft’s blue eyes met his, face a careful mask devoid of emotion. He blinked once and then re-crossed his legs.
The vampire silently ran the tip of his claw down John’s white undershirt, making the man beneath him hiss softly. He parted the material and revealed a thin line of blood slicing down the middle of his chest. Sherlock smiled and leaned down so that he could lick one long stripe up John’s chest.
Greg turned to Mycroft and spoke softly in his ear, petting his stomach gently.
Mycroft was wearing tight navy shorts, and John had no doubt they were silk. Greg sat back and he gracefully draped himself face down over his boyfriend’s lap, still wearing a crisp long sleeved button down shirt. His arse was pointed up on Greg’s lap, making a rather erotic picture.
“Wait. Wha?”
You: "Only because you weren't here," John replied, letting his head fall back against Sherlock's shoulder.
Sherlock smiled at John’s medical analysis. “How do you feel now? Still tired? Dizzy?”
They pull apart, panting. The blanket has somehow shifted and John’s cock is bare and hard and wanting. John doesn’t move to cover it up, letting Sherlock look. And he does look, long and hard until John shifts under the scrutiny.
Mycroft shrugged elegantly. “I suppose I wasn’t meant to be a father. Or at least, not one to a child born out of necessity with a woman I respect but don’t love.”
John watched as the vampire carefully summarized him on the page. “Location of mark?” he asked, looking up at Sherlock.
from you?”
“Possibly because I haven’t fed properly in a while.” He frowned, looking down at the wound in his side. “Mycroft would love to say ‘I told you so’ were he present at this moment. He’s been trying to get me to find a donor for a while. Blood bags never provide enough nutrition. Like fresh produce, it begins to lose nutritional value while it sits on the shelf.”
“And you enjoyed watching Mycroft in the same situation. Just as you enjoyed them watching you.”
Sherlock’s eyes fluttered closed and he swallowed, head still tilted back on John’s shoulder.
Mycroft broke into a very uncharacteristic grin and caressed his cheek. “You don’t even know what you’re agreeing to.”
You: "Greg. I believe I would like to kiss you if you would be amenable to such a request."
The brothers briefly make eyes contact over their prize, and, as if practiced, they go to work on removing Doctor John Watson of his clothes. Sherlock is surprisingly gentle as he pushes John forward and helps him off with his shirt, and jacket. At the same time, Mycroft kneels in front of him and takes off John’s shoes, socks, and then gently eases up his hips so that he can slide the trousers down and off.
Sherlock closes his eyes again, but John swears he can feel those steel grey eyes on him nonetheless.
The vampire’s cock jumped at his acquiescent words. Mycroft licked up a stripe of skin on his inner left thigh that was exposed between the lines of red silk. Without warning, he bit down, slicing easily into the soft skin. Greg hissed and buried his fingers into the soft bedding beneath him. Mycroft let his strength, his own vitality unfurl, letting himself drink deeply. Greg’s blood practically
“Because I can observe so much more from here.” The deep voice is nearly a purr.
“I’m glad you agree,” Sherlock says. He leans forward even further into John’s personal space.
And then silence. John counted the seconds and made it to five when Lestrade’s voice came out clear over the radios. “Team two, move!”
“What should we tell Sherlock?” John mutters as Myrcoft kisses his jaw line.
You: "You really are trying to kill me," he panted. "Didn't I say I surrender?"
His hand reflexively goes to the nightstand drawer where he keeps a small pistol. He relaxes when he recognizes Sherlock’s tall lanky frame standing in the doorway and framed by light from the hall. John squints to see his face.
“Well….I guess one is what’s involved? I take it it’s a bigger deal than the blood claim thing that we did in private? The uh, simul sanguis?”
Mycroft watched, marveling at the sensual pleasure Greg took in such a simple thing. He soaped up a loofah and picked up Greg’s left arm. He ran the loofah over the skin, letting the water wash off the suds, and then trailed kisses up the sensitive underside. Greg groaned softly, watching him from beneath hooded eyes. Mycroft repeated the action with the other arm, but this time he held the right arm up and gently nipped at the skin on the inside of the elbow. He allowed his fangs to sink into the skin, eliciting a sharp hiss from the other man. Mycroft drank only a little and whet his appetite before lapping the incisions closed.
“You’re stronger. More
“Well, are you?” Sherlock asked after a pause.
Stranger: Greg narrowed his eyes and looked at Mycroft warningly, "The blanket was quite far enough, thanks. I'm a police officer of fifteen year not an invalid. I can feed myself." He grumbled, extracting his hand from the blanket and missing the fork completely, depth perception at an all time low. He scowled and made another attempt, to similar results, "Don't you dare laugh at me, Mycroft Holmes."
John looks up at the two beautiful men and vaguely wonders if he agreed to bottom, but then two fingers slick with lube press into him, and he hisses in pleasure.
“Sempre il politico, Mycroft. Avevo dimenticato quanto scivoloso si è.” He looked closely at Lestrade, sniffing the air. “Non solo portare il vostro marchio, ma lui sa di te.” He took another step forward but was stopped when Mycroft bodily stepped between them. “Ah. Si prende più cura del vostro animale domestico che il vostro fratellino.” He threw Sherlock a smirk. Sherlock snarled, lips pulled back to show his teeth in an animalistic motion.
John smiled at the protective note in the vampire’s voice. “Thank you,” he said softly. He leaned up and place a soft kiss on Sherlock’s lips. He sighed. “We should go or we’ll be late.”
Stranger: "Hmm, you like when I kiss your neck, John..." He whispered happily, scraping his teeth gently over the sensitive skin. "That's so cute..."
“Of course sir.”
“Will it feel very different?” John asked as Sherlock knelt next to him.
Both John and Sherlock stood, and Sherlock shook his hand. “This is Doctor John Watson.”
“Yes. Their family is powerful and it is important that they be here, that one of them witness the bonding. That Victoire herself has come is an honor and will forestall any other complaints that a scion of the Holmes house is bonding with a human.” Sherlock shrugged. “At least, that is what Mycroft was kind enough to remind me of when I protested Allessandro’s presence.” He cupped John’s head and rubbed the near invisible mark behind his ear. “This at least will keep him away from you. You will be protected this time, and I will not allow him to attack you.”
“Aren’t we eager?” Sherlock mutters and watches John’s face as Mycroft push inside. He decides that John’s face while being taken is one of the most arousing things he’s ever seen. He runs his thumbs over John’s jaw line and helps his mouth open. John moans and willingly opens wider as Sherlock pushes his shaft inside.
Stranger: "Whatever you want," Sherlock smiled, beginning to pound into his lover with his hands underneath John's knees, spreading them up higher.
You: John's nipples hardened into small pebbles. "Then I surrender here and now," he said, running his hands over the skin he could get to
Caught up in the feeling of being fucked hard, John lets the two men take what they want from him. He holds tightly onto the back of the loveseat and keeps his legs spread as wide as his mouth.
John was so surprised by the plea, which in his memory the vampire had never used, that his mouth fell open.
Sherlock growled. With so much fresh blood coursing through his veins, the urge to hunt and dominate was overwhelming. He quickly rolled John over so that they were back to front, and roughly pushed John’s slacks to his knees. John was wearing a pair of red shorts underneath, and he could see the wetness of where he had just cum in them. And as he watched, John’s cock was already hardening again.
“Excellent, then let’s proceed, shall we?” Melbourne left the book lying open and gestured to them to follow him. He walked through a small side door and into a side room. This room was comfortably decorated with several plush chairs and sofas. A side table held several drink options, including, John noted, scotch. A fire burned bright and hot in a fireplace.
Xavier laughed. “Father is picky. He has high standards. It’s a true compliment that he is doing more than just keeping you around.”
You: "Y-yesss," John replied, holding his hand to Sherlock's head, pressing him down
“Mm. Remind me to thank my dear brother,” Sherlock replied, voice low and rough.
Mycroft stood back and admired him. The man was perfect.
“I think he likes it. I think the two ‘em had nannies who coddled them as kids and let them run amuck and never had a solid bed time.”
“Of course,” John said tightly, recognizing the dismissal when he saw it. He got out and walked inside, somewhat perplexed.
Stranger: Sherlock caught a brilliant idea and silently made his way to the kitchen, wrapping his arms around John'a waist and whispering into his ear. "You should take off your clothes too, John. It's really too hot in the flat."
. Mycroft periodically kidnapped John in one of his cars. He would ask questions.
Stranger: Greg's eyes widened at the sudden protest of him pulling away, moving back he placed his hand on Sherlock's hip. "We can take things slow, don't worry about my, uh... problem." He said with a nervous laugh.
“Should you ever need anything, Dr. Watson, I do hope that you won’t hesitate to contact me.”
John turned over. Without prompting, he pushed his arse up in the air and rested his head on the pillow.
“Please! John I need you in me so much! Please!” Sherlock pushed his hips up, trying to show his husband how much he needed more. He spread his legs wantonly.
You: John ran a hand over Sherlock's check. "So what course of action do you recommend?"
As the vampire leaned in, Greg tried to relax. He couldn’t quite forget that there were others watching them. He felt Mycroft maneuvering his hand and placing it over his Mycroft’s heart. It beat out strong and regular, and Greg smiled. But then he thought he could feel Mycroft touching him in a way that wasn’t physical, but he couldn’t quite describe it. He gasped softly, eyes widening at the feeling. Was this what Mycroft could feel from him? And then Mycroft was pulling away, but holding him upright as he swayed just a bit.
You: "Y-yesss," John replied, holding his hand to Sherlock's head, pressing him down
Sherlock snorted. “No. He has never been one for diplomacy. He wanted to see whether the rumors are true that Mycroft has chosen a mate.”
John moaned and rolled his hips. He was hard and leaking on his belly. “Please. Fuck! Need to cum,” he whined.
“Shit.”
John suddenly found himself pinned bodily to the kitchen counter, neck craned as he looked up into the vampire’s bright eyes.
“Enough. Both of you,” Greg said firmly. “This fighting has to stop. You’re both acting like children.”
Xavier shrugged. “Glad to be here to support you.”
“So,” Greg said, pushing his hands under Mycroft’s crisp white shirt and up expanse of his back, “now what?”
“What on earth would you talk about?” Sherlock asks, turning towards his brother.
The smile that Mycroft gives him makes the hair on the back of John’s neck stand on end.
“Well, it
“Mmm, it would be awfully convenient.”
Mycroft gave Greg an encouraging smile and reached out to place a hand over the human’s heart. He could feel the organ beating out an anxious pater. “Take a few deep breaths, love,” he murmured. Greg obeyed and Mycroft felt the heartbeat slow a bit. “Good.” Mycroft kept his hand there, feeling the whirlwind of emotions of his beloved singing through the man’s blood. Anxiety, passion, love, determination. He smiled. He lifted Greg’s hand and kissed his palm.
“Cheers,” John said in response.
Sherlock growls. Actually grows  like an animal. And Sherlock Holmes never gives in to his baser animal instincts. He has worked very hard to distance himself from these pesky natural instincts, these coarse emotions. But even Sherlock Holmes has…limits.
Sherlock’s body is hot and tight and so welcoming, as he sinks down. John fights the urge to move. Especially when Sherlock wiggles his hips a bit, just. Like. That.
“I don’t believe that we have reached that stage of our relationship, John,” Sherlock says with a smirk.
Sherlock pulled John harder into his embrace and pounded into his body hard as he continued to drink John’s sweet blood. He came deep inside of John’s body with a low primal growl, eyes glinting.
“Well, in a word, yes.” Mycroft raises his eyebrows in a silent question.
John and the DI looked guiltily over to where Sherlock was waiting by the car. He looked impatient.
John met his sister’s eyes in the mirror and smiled. “Right. Let’s do this.”
John hung his coat on the hook near the door and wandered into the sitting room. His conversation with Greg over drinks was swirling around his brain, and he sat in what had become
After a moment in which John does some mental math to check that he is, in fact awake and not having a very odd wet dream, he looks up again and says, “So, um, what exactly is Mycroft correct about?”
“Cosa ci fai qui, Alessandro?”
“We can’t take too long, pet,” he murmured as he removed his fingers. “Not right now.” With his other hand he slicked up his own cock, making sure it was hard and slick. He stood up, leaving Greg there. He wiped off his hand with a waiting towel before quickly undressing. Naked, he put their clothes in the adjoining bathroom.
The two humans turned and looked at the vampires. Sherlock idly played with his violin, looking bored, while the elder Holmes brother casually looked for all the world as if they were discussing the weather.
Greg laughed, voice low. “Good. Now, are you going to tie me up? Or do I need to threaten to go run some errands on my day off?”
John hisses. The feeling of Sherlock’s long delicate fingers wrapping around him is utterly exquisite. He groans and moves forward, swiftly covering Sherlock’s body with his own, nearly pinning him to the bed. Leaning on one forearm, he grasps Sherlock’s chin and runs his thumb over the pale skin.
Mycroft and Greg stood up as three vampires were shown into the sitting room.
Stranger: Will be home late. Sorry. GL
John is surprised to find himself a bit disappointed. He jealously wants to be Sherlock’s first. In everything. He pushes the possessive thought down.
Stranger: Greg smiled, brought his free hand up to the back of Sherlock's neck tangling his fingers into the curls that fell there. "You don't have to ask to kiss me, Sherlock. Of course I am amenable."
“So beautiful,” Sherlock murmurs in his ear as he leans down to kiss at John’s neck.
"Ah, erm, yes. He has...um…Mycroft says that you were at the charity auction, too? Why didn't you tell me you were planning to go?"
Greg wasn’t sure what to think of this description of a woman he’d never met. He suddenly felt jealous and inadequate. She sounded wholly unlike him.
Stranger: Greg wiped at his face, reclaiming a bit of his dignity and reclining against Mycroft's chest, leaning his head back against the broad shoulder, "Better. Still have a head ache, but better. Love you."
“Ah. Yes.” Mycroft flushed a bit, a feat considering his normally pale pallor. “That is what Alessandro was here to ascertain. Apparently some of our kind are talking.”
“And?”
“Gregory, love, Anna is – she holds no place in my heart save for being the mother of my child and heir. She has, since then, found her own mate. Charles, her bonded, is much more suited to her than I would ever be.” He picked up one of Greg’s hands and kissed the front and back of the palm.
“I considered it to be a distinct possibility. My brother has shown that John is more to him than a mere contract. Though I doubt John understands that.”
“John, I don’t think that –“
“Mmm, yess…I won’t be long.”
You: "Well then what?" John asked, getting frustrated in more way than one. He stood up and stood next to the couch, looking down at Sherlock on the couch.
“Anna, it’s good to see you.” Mycroft turned to the young man. “Xavier,” he said with a fond smile.
Sherlock shrugged. “I assume that, as a human, you experience a different sensation than myself.”
“Excellent. We’ll just take care of the preliminary paperwork and such first,” Melbourne said, slipping back into his jovial demeanor. “I’m sure you won’t be in any condition to do so afterwards, hmm?”
Sherlock finally rolled off John and stretched out on the bed like a satisfied feline.
John’s lips breathed open with a sigh and his hands gripped Sherlock’s arms. After a minute, one moved to Sherlock’s waist and he hummed as arousal bloomed in his belly.
DI Gregory Lestrade looked at his watch as he unlocked the front door to the Belgravia flat he shared with Mycroft.
This is the last chapter. I hope you've enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it.
in his veins, urging him on to press his face shamelessly against him.
“Oh, um, well thank you, I suppose.” John wasn't sure how he felt about this. He decided to watch London pass by through the windows.
Sherlock shot him a smile and pulled out his mobile.
“B-bite me,” John panted, voice rough and demanding.
Mycroft idly thumbed Greg’s right hand where it had been cut earlier in the day. He could feel that the wound was healing beneath the gauze bandage. “I know. But I simply can’t bear the thought of you being hurt, of….losing you.”
“Yup. Basically. Mind if I sit?”
John sent his eyes skyward. “I just want to know…know why!” He gestured vaguely with his hands, flustered.
Mycroft fidgeted, brushing invisible dust off of his deep blue waistcoat. Seeing this sign of nervousness, Greg pulled him back into his arms and wrapped them around his slim waist. “Go on,” he said softly.
“Really?! Mate that’s fantastic! Congratulations!”
Sherlock pulled back. “What do you want, John?” he asked in a soft murmur before sniffing at his neck.
Mycroft stilled and then, after a moment, twisted around in Greg’s arms so that he could look him in his eyes. He searched Greg’s dark brown eyes, trying to guess at the man’s emotions: hope, love, fear, nervousness, longing are all warring with each other despite Greg’s obvious attempts to remain calm. He wasn’t practiced like Mycroft in this area.
Sherlock sat in a chair across from John and looked at him intently. “Yes, we have distant family in Italy. Alessandro is our cousin, if somewhat removed. They are – rather powerful.”
Stranger: John's*
“So many choices,” Mycroft said softly. “Though do I believe I said something about tying you up so that you can’t leave my side.”
Sherlock was half way up the front steps before John even got out of the car. He turned around impatiently and rolled his eyes.
“No. I wish to complete that task,” he said, voice soft. Sherlock leaned down and unbuttoned the shirt, revealing the white undershirt. He allowed John to pull the shirt off before he pulled off John’s slacks and dumped them on the floor. “Lie in the middle of the bed.”
Stranger: Sherlock moaned louder, fucking his m harder.
! Unlike Sherlock’s bites, which were pleasurable, this bite caused a sharp burning pain to spread from the puncture site. He whimpered, unable to struggle.
“I can help, you know,” John said, trying to keep the whining sound out of his voice.
“So you finally claimed him, have you? Got your very own little toy,” Allessandro spat.
John’s legs fell to the bed in a boneless rush and he panted. He let go of the headboard and embraced Sherlock, who lay on top of him. They lay like that for a few minutes, catching their breath, bodies entwined.
Stranger: Sherlock made a noise of thought from where he laid on the sofa and waved a hand at John without looking at him.
John wrinkled his nose at the idea of Mycroft knowing what they had just done, but then he was a  whole lot more comfortable with sex in general since meeting Sherlock. Vampires were remarkably sensuous creatures.
You: "Oh G-d," John breathed. He licked his dry lips. "I-I want you to fuck me, Sherlock."
“No, Greg was right. It’s too late to get out of this.” He lowered his voice and dug his fingers into Sherlock’s stomach. “You know you’re curious, love. Don’t you want to know *why* this is making you so hard? Hmm?”
“I’m in agreement with you on that one.” He shifted uncomfortably. “So…are there, I don’t know, consequences of this? I know it won’t change me into a vampire.”
The vampire watched John with a slightly amused expression as he deftly removed his own clothes. He was eager to feel the heat of John’s skin. Once naked, he smoothly climbed onto the bed and pinned John down on his back. John let out a small indignant squeak, but Sherlock merely gave him a predatory grin, letting his fangs be seen.
“No. More like the ability to sense each other. To be honest, those of my kind who are bonded have said that the sensation – the experience – cannot be described in mere words.”
“Tease,” the vampire murmured.
You: "And I am happy that you aren't a corpse." He hesitantly raised a hand and ran his fingertips down Greg's cheek.
Stranger: Sherlock reached up and cupped his through his trousers.
Stranger: "I do believe that there is a need to celebrate my solving of this case." Sherlock pushed John down until he was laying with his back to the mattress and Sherlock loomed over him. "But remember, John. I am also the criminal," he winked, leaning down to nip over his neck.
John glanced around quickly, saw that they were alone, and leaned up to kiss Sherlock, pouring his arousal into it. Sherlock inhaled sharply but pulled back. “Not yet,” he growled. “But soon.”
“Turn over,” Sherlock said softly.
Mycroft nodded his head and pointedly didn’t look in his direction. “In my hundredth year, my mother despaired that Sherlock or I would ever find our mates. We have to have an heir, you see. We live for so long and real bonds are rare…” He paused and cleared his throat. “My mother asked that one of us sire a child. Well, being the older one, I couldn’t refuse the responsibility.”
“To my knowledge, you assume correctly,” Sherlock said, clearly annoyed at the small talk involving his brother.
Stranger: "Is this your first time?" He muttered breathily. "With a man..."
“You know, cousin, if I owned a pet that smelled like him, I would never let my cock leave his ass.”
“More. Please?” John asked over his shoulder. Sherlock’s fingers felt amazing as they opened him up. The vampire was surprisingly gentle
“John. It occurs to me that I should know whether sex is alarming. It would seem prudent that I learn about it and thus deepen my observations on human behavior.”
John watched, noticing that Mycroft winced for just a moment before folding his hands in his lap.
Sherlock growled, eyes narrowed. “Leave. Now.”
“Mycroft sends one of his minions over, letting me feed, if needed. Really, we can go much longer than humans believe without food.”
After, they lay panting and Sherlock gently laved the puncture wounds with his tongue. He also gently licked at the healing wound behind John’s ear from the day’s earlier marking. John shuddered with a bit of a wince.
you didn’t used to torture people for a living? You’re doing an awfully good job of it.”
Your conversational partner has disconnected.
Sherlock started to pull away but John wrapped his arms around him and pulled his mouth down to meet his own. He pushed his tongue into the vampire’s mouth, aggressively throwing himself at Sherlock.
Sherlock held up a shaking hand. There was something wet, glistening on his finger tips.
Mycroft chuckled lightly and ran his thumb over the back of Greg’s hand. “Well, yes, but this will be a bit more…structured.”
“No. I took the liberty of making an appointment for us at 1pm.” Sherlock stood up abruptly. “Ah! The eyes are done!” Sherlock said after a glance at the wall clock.
“But I want to see you,” John protested.
Greg snorted. “Good chance, that. Clearly that pri-guy was your cousin. So you’ve got an unpleasant cousin. Who doesn’t?”
“Bugs? In a nice place like this?”
the only one who can truly answer this. But what does the bite feel like to you?”
“Ah, Sherlock! Mycroft insists that this tasty morsel belongs to you.”
Stranger: "Hmm, you like when I kiss your neck, John..." He whispered happily, scraping his teeth gently over the sensitive skin. "That's so cute..."
Sherlock pants, his dark curls sticking to his temples with sweat. Slowly, his breath evens out and his eyes snap open, pinning John with another stare.
“It’s ok. Let go. I’ve got you. I’m going to give you what you need,” John said, words falling deliciously from his lips.
John whimpered as Sherlock began to tap into a part of himself he’d rarely looked at or accepted. He tilted his head forward more for Sherlock. “Yes. For you.”
John pushes himself up so that he’s resting on his side. Looking down at Sherlock’s face, he runs a hand over the pointed chin. “Like the man said, this is where I belong.” He smiles and leans down for a kiss.
Stranger: "Excellent job, and what can you deduce from the fact that I'm trying to impress you?" Greg asked finally looking up at Sherlock, and into his crystalline eyes with a small smile,
He managed to put together what he thought was a rather decent pot of tea. He placed the tray on the counter and was just reaching for a mug when a knock came from the door to the stairs.
“So brave, John,” Sherlock said softly.
“Erm, sometimes,” John said, opening the glass doors to the kitchen. “I thought vampires didn’t need to eat food?”
Greg panted heavily, pinned beneath Mycroft. He could feel blood dribbling down his neck for a moment before the vampire licked it up and lapped at the wounds. They lay like that for a while.
For a minute, John didn’t think he would get an answer. He couldn’t see Sherlock’s face as it was still buried in the crook of his neck. “Because you’re you,” he said finally. John frowned. “Because you’re interesting and brave and so very solid. And, you smell utterly divine.” Sherlock sniffed at his neck again and sighed happily.
“That didn’t take long,” John said, feeling foolish the minute he said it.
“That won’t be necessary,” Sherlock stopped him. “I can feed from your wrist.”
“Sir?” he asked tentatively. He had only been in the vampire’s service for four days, and he wasn’t sure what to call him. Or how to approach him. How did one approach a wounded creature that could easily snap him in half?
“Yeah, sorry to just up and leave like that. Sometimes Sherlock – well – you heard what he said.”
“Non sono affari tuoi, Mycroft!”
“We have...touched on the subject, but not at length.”
John ripped the towel away and quickly shed his robe, leaving them both bare and naked. He pushed a knee between Sherlock’s long legs. Sherlock felt the knee nudging up between his spread legs and he groaned, pushing down on it.
“So this would be the
Mycroft leaned their foreheads together. “Gregory, watching you run into that building frightened
Sherlock merely chuckled and removed his fingers. He quickly lubed up his cock and, still holding John’s leg up, positioned the tip at John’s quickly stretched hole. He locked eyes with John and then slammed inside in one powerful move. John keened, throwing his head back as pain ripped up his spine. “Hurts,” he said, voice shuddering.
Beneath him, Sherlock wined, throwing his head back, and presenting his neck in a submissive gesture that made John the newfound alpha in him roar with approval. But not yet. He couldn’t make the bite that would seal their bond until he was inside Sherlock. Very deep inside.
“John! I’m going to – ohhhh –I’m going to cum inside of you,” Mycroft grinds.
“Well,” Greg said after a minute of heavy silence, “I suppose it could be worse.”
You: John nodded and tried to remember to breathe when he felt Sherlock's fingers on his skin
Mycroft frowned. “"Questo non è né qui né là, cugino. Dico che è così, e la mia parola è definitiva in questa famiglia."
Greg groaned, his cock giving a happy leap in his pants at those words. “Yesss, please, Mycroft.”
For several heartbeats, no one moved. Then Sherlock stood up gracefully. He bent down and pulled off his shoes and socks. Keeping his eyes locked on John, he slowly unzipped his slacks and pushed them down. John smiled when he realized that Sherlock was wearing John’s favorite pair of boxer-briefs. They were tight and black with a wide red band along the top. John always thought they were sexy as hell.
John gaped at him. “Wait. Greg? Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade. We’re talking about the same man, right?”
“And I with you,” Sherlock replied, “But I should also point out the fact that I am near bursting.”
Sherlock leaned his forehead against John’s shoulder, breathing hard. “If you have any questions, now is the time to ask while you can still back out.”
Still dressed, Sherlock silently straddled John’s thighs, and John idly ran his hands over the expensive fabric of Sherlock’s slacks. The smile Sherlock gave him was feral and showed his sharp fangs extended. “If you’d like to back out, John Watson,” Sherlock said, his voice dangerously soft as he allowed the claw of one forefinger to grow long and sharp, “now would be a good time to speak up.”
John blinks. He tries to come up with something to say, and isn’t sure whether he should jump out of the bed and run, or grab Sherlock’s hand and press it wantonly between his legs. He settles for gaping at Sherlock’s hand, which has moved an inch up his leg.
“Yes, if Anna is agreeable, they will come to our wedding.”
“Yes, quite.”
Despite his nervousness, Greg shivered and his cock began to fill. He shifted and let his legs fall open even more in invitation.
You: Mycroft frowned. "I will have a word with Sherlock. He and John are getting...out of hand." He absently ran a hand down Greg's chest. "Is the light bothering you?"
The sounds of the reception were dimmed on the second floor as Mycroft led Greg to the room prepared for them, normally a guest bedroom. Mycroft closed the door behind them as Greg looked around, mouth open. The ornate bedroom was awash in soft candle light from dozens of candles placed around the room. In the center was a large bed surrounded on all sides by gauzy cream colored fabric that hung long and heavy, bunching on the floor.
“Fuck you’re tight,” John moans. He jerks his hips up.
, I take it?”
“I’m sorry?”
You: "Must have a criminal kink," John replied with a shudder
Stranger: He sucked the skin greedily, biting and nipping at John as his hand teased his cock, sliding his thumb over the leaking slit and creating a delicious burn. "What do you want me to do to you, John? I won't do anything until you tell me."
“That was most…exhilarating. I had not thought it would feel that way.”
John whimpered and missed the feral grin Sherlock gave him.
Sherlock unfolded himself from where he was sitting and stalked towards John. He gently grasped John’s chin in his hand and kissed him. The kiss was soft and hungry and promised what would happen soon. “I should shower,” Sherlock murmured, pulling away.
But instead the man quickly got rid of his shoes and socks, unfastened his belt, and then continued to climb up on the chair, smiling, straddling Sherlock, wrapped his arms around him and kissed him.
”Oh shut up, will you,” said Sherlock, and John couldn’t help but laugh at this situation. ”I’ll get her out, no worries, doc.”
At dawn, they were both not quite awake but not really asleep, either. Their bodies gravitated towards one another without conscious effort, pressed close again, torso against torso, leg between legs. Lips meeting and tongues quickly catching on. John could feel Sherlock’s body, pliant and relaxed from sleep, moving into him and reacting to his touches. John’s hand found it’s way down to Sherlock’s cock, and he thought that he was already starting to love the sensation of it filling in his fist, growing harder, bigger.
He tried to give her a careful smile. “But you know what? I don't know why. I don't know why you had to become so strong. And I think it's about time that we talked about that.”
“Yeah well,” John said sternly, “you're not exactly my dream date, either, so don't flatter yourself. I do however think you’ll want to hear what I have to say. I suggest you come with me now before I change my mind.”
”I am so, so sorry, Sherlock. I shouldn’t have rushed it like this.”
John found himself completely lost in her story, forgetting all together how they had even ended up there, on the cold kitchen floor.
He turned to look at Sherlock, who was standing with his arms hanging down, looking equal parts excited and lost.
He’d clung to a faint hope that Sherlock would say something at the last minute, suggest they get together again sometimes, something like that. He didn’t.
”I know neither of us is an expert at the talking thing, but we really should try. Try to talk more like this. I don’t want stupid misunderstandings to keep coming in our way.”
A long stretch of silence follows. So much to think about. Too much. All that’s happened since last night, perhaps it’s taking its toll. His eyes feel heavy. Head still spinning from too much wine consumed, he feels it more now when everything around him has gone quiet.
”Oh god,” John managed to complain as Sherlock closed the door behind them. They both toed off their wet shoes and socks, leaving them in a pile by the entrance.
“Sherlock, I- I need to come – do you mind if I-”
He felt Sherlock snuggle in even closer, and John embraced him and squeezed him tight, closed his eyes. He'd sleep well tonight, he could feel it. Tonight, there would be no nightmares, no waking up to panic attacks. This is happiness, he thought hazily. He hadn't felt it for so long he'd almost forgotten what it was like.
The small kitchen filled with the sounds of heavy breathing and occasional gasps and whispers.
Under normal circumstances, Sherlock wouldn’t have given it much thought, but tonight, these little things kept adding up. And then he noticed the way that John was looking at him. John was starting to hold Sherlock’s gaze for a slightly longer than usual, and there was something new in the way he was looking at him.
”You know what they say, Sherlock; third time lucky," Gabriel had said with that warm, unguarded smile over dinner, the first night at the new place.
“And masurb-. Masturbation does not cut it for you, not completely. Not even with the additional stimulus of watching porn.”
He felt his face burn. He knew he was completely clean, having been very thorough in the shower he’d taken when John had made dinner. But still. This was not something he’d imagined John ever doing.
But what to say about Mary? John took one more good look at Sherlock. Told himself it was for him.
”Sherlock,” John said, and he could immediately tell that he was going to say something along the more serious lines.
John didn't let go of his tight grip around Sherlock's wrists, it was starting to hurt a bit but the overall sensation was well worth it. John was naked on top of him, and it was such a mind blowing thing. When their cocks brushed together, Sherlock gasped and John moaned.
you... Your cock is beautiful- fuck, everything about you is. Wanted to suck you ’til you came.” Sherlock gasps. Sees John searching for his eyes.
”Victor was the only one I got to know there, and that was only because of an accident - his bull terrier freezed on my ankle one morning as I was on my way to something.”
”And the key to avoiding that fallacy is..?”
John appears to be in one of his top three best moods. He’s been joking flirtatiously with Mummy, making her blush (she loves it). He’s been chatting with Caroline, they seem to have hit it off immediately, perhaps bonding over the children they’re both missing today. Written a prescription for Uncle Rudy. He’s patiently listened as Mycroft droned on about some godawful government thing, and gently patted Daddy on the shoulder with a short ’Sit down, Sir, I’ll get it’ whenever something was found missing from the already ridiculously overdone meal.
He looks at her, thinks that she’s a really kind person.
”John! How lovely to see you again!” Sherlock’s mum comes out in the hall, wipes her hands at her apron, then gives him a big hug. He takes out the gift bag he’s brought, containing two bottles of Champagne and a large box of Prestat chocolate.
”I got a little bit worried when you weren’t here.”
********************
The radiologist had called John last Thursday about the results, and now John had to be the one to tell the young man that the pain in his stomach indeed was something to worry about.
He had let Sherlock choose the place for the evening; a task which he had approached through meticulous research on his laptop. John had obligingly fetched it for him to use in bed after their last encounter was over with; soiled flannels properly discarded on the bathroom floor and a long snogging session properly accomplished.
He showers, shaves, moisturises. The
She had a no-nonsense air about her, and was making a quite intelligent impression as she spoke to him. Sherlock decided that he’d put her on the list, too.
”Smythson. British luxury leather goods at its finest. Lambskin, hand stitched. The only notebook worth its name.” Sherlock ran his right hand across the cover, flipped through the light blue paper sheets inside. ”Sir Winston Churchill was a fan, as well.”
For a while last night, John had felt sick with worry that something terrible was going to happen to Sherlock, but managed to calm down just a bit after the somewhat reassuring conversation with Mycroft. John had phoned him up as soon as he’d left the restaurant, thankful he had kept the emergency number Mycroft had given him a long time ago, for situations just like this.
He had pulled away from Sherlock, and now felt a massive wave of adrenaline shooting through his body.
”God I wish you had.”
John smiled. “I loved it. Loved everything about it, okay?”
”Want to come with me?”
Oh how that thought hurt. Ripped right through him, like that bullet had. Just in a different kind of way.
John, who had left Baker Street when Sherlock was away. John, who was living with Mary in one of those white new ugly boring houses, with ugly boring neighbors. With furniture that still had that unpleasant odor of new; of chemicals to prevent them from being stained by the obligatory glass of red wine on Friday nights by the telly, and more chemicals to prevent them from suddenly bursting into flames. When did furniture ever spontaneously combust? Neither John nor Mary smoked, and Sherlock felt fairly certain they wouldn’t, say, leave a burning candle in the sofa, so-
John was trying hard to not act any further on his anger. He knew that he had already crossed a few lines, and was beginning to sense that Mary would not put up with more before possibly confronting him, and that he wanted to avoid at all costs. So instead, he was sitting silently at the table, occasionally glancing at Sherlock, who had his phone in his hand and was not looking up.
“I don't know.” He shrugged. “Since you obviously know me far more intimately than I was aware, I guess I felt a nickname would be appropriate.”
”…No.” Sherlock shakes his head slowly. ”No, I don’t. Haven’t, not after I got clean. But I thought that I did, now. It just seems… unreal.”
John had managed to get him to laugh before they’d even made it up the stairs to the flat, and then proceeded to go about with the food, all the while chatting and joking, not giving Sherlock even a moment’s respite to restore his guard.
”Yes, love?”
Opened the browser.
Bright light. Everywhere, he was surrounded by this bloody bright light. It was burning his retinas, even though his eyes were closed.
”Fuck.” Sally turns to Sherlock, explains. ”We’d gotten him to communicate through the landline.”
He visited Sherlock two times at the hospital during the week he spent there, dreading it both times and only ending up going because Greg or Molly dragged him there.
Mark gave him a good pat on the shoulder.
”We need to figure out a way to deal with this situation,” John said. ”It’s getting out of hand.”
John felt very uplifted by the thought. Then again, he had no way of knowing.
It occurs to John how very little he knows about Sherlock now. Has no idea of what his mental state has been these past years, except for the small bits and pieces he’s managed to extract from Molly on the few occasions they’ve been in touch. Has heard that Sherlock seems to be doing fine - staying away from drugs, keeping himself busy with work. It has been easy to tell himself that that was all there was to it.
John strained to see, had to see more, had to know even though he also felt acutely aware that he should immediately turn away and sneak out while he still had the opportunity. To be caught out here would be, well, mortifying was too weak of a word. Sherlock would never speak to him again.
”Oh, John… Well, if you change your mind, you know where to go.”
It was building up, furiously, maddeningly. The telltale feeling in his groin, the rising tension in his body-
“God, I'm coming, baby–”
”Wha?”
”Sherlock…”, John said his name again, on an exhale. He moved his hands, let them glide down Sherlock’s shirted arms until they were resting on top of Sherlock’s tight fists, still gripping the counter.
John had wanted to make Sherlock come first. He'd planned to put his hand around his cock very soon, but suddenly, he was overthrown with the intense, tingling first signs of climax. At this point, there was no holding back.
, he thinks; it’s like they’re fucking.
Eventually, he dozed off. At one o’clock, he was awakened by a vibration and a simultaneous chime.
“I'd love for you to fuck me right now, John,” he mumbled, pushing hard into John's fist. “I've waited so many years to feel your cock up my arse; I really don't think I can wait any longer.”
”Of course you were, love.”
And despite all better judgement, Sherlock gets up from the floor, then carefully gets in the bed. He places himself on the very far edge, facing out the room, away from John.
”No kidding, me neither,” Greg smiles, then turns to Sherlock again.
”Hm”, said Sherlock, his eyebrows furrowed. ”Translate!” he demanded.
Gradually, John has changed his position; is now lying almost on top of him. Sherlock moves to wrap his hand around John’s. Deep kisses; John’s tongue in his mouth, then Sherlock’s tongue in John’s. Hips moving, hard and fast; their cocks sliding against each other inside the tight fist of John’s hand.
”Aww. You think he loves you. Oh John, you poor sucker.” She tutted.
Like an answer to his question, a second later Sherlock’s whining sounds turned into something more decisive, something more like small grunts. ”
”At some point, I think we both need to try to communicate a bit better,” he said. ”You know, instead of trying to mind read.” John’s hand on his hair, a finger absentmindedly twirling a strand.
John was so relieved he had a hard time to keep from sinking to the floor. Oh my god. And if he’d been intent before, it was nothing compared to how he was feeling right now. He needed to act, fast. He needed to make sure that no one else could come in between them. Not ever again.
”You drive me mad; your body, your mouth-” John breathed between two rocking motions that both sent Sherlock momentarily down into the mattress.
Sherlock swallows. ”John, I’ve never talked to anyone about this. It concerns events that took place a long time ago. Ghosts of the past, that… set me on a certain course, in more ways than one.”
Sherlock drew a breath, and continued, now turned to John.
”Are you left waiting, too?” he asks.
In the morning, he made breakfast while John got dressed for another day at the madhouse that was the Trauma Unit. Since John had gotten promoted, more and more of his time there had been spent dealing with all sorts of administrative tasks; conferences and meetings and paperwork, and Sherlock knew he wasn’t happy about that, not one bit.
”It’s been a while,” Sherlock mumbles.
. His noises turned into sharper exclamations as John started to twist his hand on every upstroke, gliding over the head with his thumb.
Silence ensued. John let his head fall back into the backrest of the chair. His eyes were getting heavier by the second. Perhaps he could just close them for a moment-
Please, please, please, Sherlock thought. Please say something.
At 6 in the evening, as John was doing his best to look busy with some of last week's paperwork, Mary came upstairs. Leaned against her shoulder was the half asleep baby.
’Perhaps we can make dinner here,’ he’d written, and by that he meant - obviously - that John could make dinner. John was very good at that.
”It’s just.. I still can’t believe it. Seems we actually got our happy ending, after all this bloody time.”
”Sherlock..?”
He’d been looking forward to this date for quite some time now. He’d never been particularly keen on those dating apps, but as it turns out, being a single dad in a small town is a very different animal from his old bachelor days in London.
* * * * *
, as anything other than an erotic innuendo. Sherlock didn’t see how it could possibly be so, but then again, it made that almost kiss somewhat more understandable.
”Mmm.” Sherlock relocates himself the very short distance from his chair to the sofa, boneless body falling into the soft pillows there.
Sherlock furrowed his eyebrows. ”But why?” he said, looking genuinely confounded.
Sherlock could not remember the last time he had cried. He’d been dangerously close twice recently, once before John’s wedding waltz and then when he had gotten on that plane to leave for Eastern Europe.
”Fuck!” John couldn’t hold back, he moaned loudly. ”Fuck, baby, fuck, fuck, oh fuck-”
”You must be insane,” Sherlock panted. ”If you don’t fuck me tonight, I swear I’m going to kill you.”
’Dust is an essential part of my filing system!’ he had once yelled at poor Mrs. Hudson when she had been kind enough to tidy up the flat.
The first time John had come in Sherlock’s mouth, allowing him to swallow most of it and then to kiss John with the remainder of the load still in his mouth, Sherlock had felt like he was quite possibly going to die of arousal.
“..or you fucking me. That's what I fantasize about, John. And I've even used, you know-” Sherlock paused. A pink flush spread across his already flustered cheeks,
He was fully aware that this time, he wouldn’t be coming back. No need to concern John with that information, he and Mycroft had both agreed. But one thing Sherlock knew he couldn’t do, and that was to part without ever having said it.
Sherlock snickered.
John usually liked giving gifts a whole lot more than receiving them, and he felt a little bit uncomfortable now. It was, however, going to be interesting to see what Sherlock had thought out for him. This could go in absolutely any direction.
”Oh, I’m sorry John, I shouldn’t have asked-” she says, but John just shrugs, smiles.
Always when this would come up, Sherlock would feel like he was waiting for a disaster to happen, like standing at the beach and seeing a tsunami approaching, knowing that you couldn’t outrun the wave.
John held it by the collar and coaxed it out of the door. His experience with dogs amounted to exactly zero, but he figured the same principles should apply as for humans.
”I’m sorry Mary, but I just don't feel the way I ought to,” he had said. ”I think you deserve better.”
”Let’s just forget this whole thing now and watch some telly, okay John?”
He was beginning to feel the effects of kneeling on the ground in nothing but a shirt, a jumper and a pair of cotton trousers, so he kept his parka draped over his shoulders in an effort to warm up.
”You’re insufferable!” said Sherlock, rolling his eyes dramatically. ”If you hadn’t been laughing all the time, it would have been a whole lot easier for me to penetrate you!”
Sherlock’s knees nearly give way. His hands are in John’s hair, gripping randomly, fists opening and closing. The whimpering sound coming from his mouth sounds pained.
John’s hasn’t allowed himself to dwell too much on that, until now. Tried his best to keep at a distance the uninvited images of Sherlock at some New Year’s party, surrounded by all kinds of people who might decide to just…
“John,” Sherlock whispered, ”I would like you to fuck me, I’ve dreamt of it for so long-”
Walking when drunk, good. Fresh air, good.
John draped his Barbour jacket on a chair in the kitchen, left it there, dripping. He proceeded to get the kettle, filled it with water, and put teabags in two cups as the water came to a boil. It occurred to him that perhaps he should have asked first, but it just really felt like home to him, still, after all this time.
“Or is it that you don't want to?” Sherlock asked, and John noticed a hint of worry – or was it embarrassment? - in his eyes.
But first, he needs to get the rest of the Baker Street flat back into shape again. Back to how it used to be. Second; get Sherlock to eat a bit more, better, and on a somewhat more regular basis. Hell, his own eating habits could really need some work as well.
She met his eyes, he could see there was no anger left, only fatigue and sadness.
John had immediately stopped everything he was doing. Sherlock turned his face away.
It was incomprehensible.
”When you were talking about him, over dinner tonight,” she says, smiling apologetically. ”I’m sorry that I misunderstood, hope you don’t take offence.”
”What the- Who the hell are you? I’m a policewoman, not a bloody secretary!” She looks about ready to smack Sherlock in the face.
”John,” Sherlock moaned, his voice sounding almost pained. John had raised himself up more, he was leaning on his elbows, because he sure as hell wasn’t going to miss a single thing of this miracle.
Sherlock had at some point managed to produce out of nowhere a bottle of lube, and the slippery noises from his hand stroking John's dick was almost too much in itself.
Another strange thing, coming back, had been to notice that the thoughts of John had taken on a different character. It was difficult to put into words.
When John is in the loo getting ready, Sherlock hurries to change into his pyjamas, turns the lights out but then changes his mind and quickly flicks it on again. When John comes back, dressed in pyjama pants and a grey t-shirt, Sherlock has just managed to flop down on the roll-out mattress he got from the storage closet in the upstairs hallway. He sees the surprised look at John’s face, but before he has the chance to say anything, Sherlock promptly turns off the light, the room turning almost pitch black.
”John, what a pleasure! Long time no see, my friend.
”It’s been a while,” John said without thinking, and then braced himself for the inevitable comeback.
Once or twice a week, he and Mary would have dinner together in the evening, but usually he would arrange it so that they’d take turns with Anna while the other person was off doing something else.
Mycroft sighed, a deep, sad exhale.
”There,” he says, a few minutes later, all passed in complete silence. ”Give it a moment, and then I’d suggest you get in the shower. You can rinse your hair, but don’t touch the cut.”
”Everyone was so nice, yesterday,” John said, bringing back the conversation to last night’s events.
”I can’t stop thinking about you, Sherlock. These last few months, I’ve missed you so much I thought I’d go crazy. I feel like-”, he hesitated for a moment, spoke in a quiet voice, ”like we belong together.”
John's stomach turned a little bit when he realized this must have been from where that bottle of expensive Single Malt Scotch had been coming from, every Christmas in the past. He'd happily enjoyed it, never asked from whom it was. He'd always assumed it was from a client, or from Mycroft perhaps.
”I assume you’d better head back to your place then, early morning tomorrow and all,” Sherlock said, not meeting John’s eye. It was impossible to know what he was really thinking. John felt at a loss at this sudden shift, and the nervous, fluttery feeling in his stomach was back. He was not used to Sherlock acting this way towards him, but then again, before, there hadn’t been any other people or obligations to come between them before.
”No,” he groans into the pillow.
”No need for small talk to catch up with you,” John says, still smiling. ”Yeah, I might return to surgery. And Rosie’s with Mary. Stays with me every other weekend now, difficult with the school schedule and all.” John glances at Sherlock, then away. "The divorce was finalised about a year ago, but surely you've deduced that already."
John released his hands from his grip, and instead grabbed ahold of Sherlock’s shoulders. In a gentle but determined move, he turned Sherlock around in his arms, never breaking their body contact. Sherlock gathered courage to briefly meet his eyes. All he could see was warm, light, shining. John’s eyes were dark with focus.
But it’s impossible to stop his mind from wandering; back to what happened in the darkness of Sherlock’s childhood room last night. And yes, he knows that Sherlock was asleep, that it was nothing more than an autonomic reflex, just the transport responding -
The way Mycroft was looking at John sent icy chills down his spine.
“I know,” he said.
Gabe was so uncomplicated, so blissfully free from dark moods and anxiety. Easy to like.To love, even? Recently, Sherlock had begun to consider that possibility more. Now he was on a plane heading east. Clueless of what Sherlock was contemplating to do. Would react strongly if he knew. First angry, then hurt. Probably cry.
Sherlock is keeping himself busy with cases, John is working his shifts at surgery, which means neither of them has what other people would consider a normal schedule. Except for the days when Rosie is with them, of course, because Sherlock insists that children need predictability and ’healthy routines’, which actually rendered John speechless the first time he heard him say it.
”Did you call him?”
”I’m not going to last much longer, love, it’s too good. I want to see you when I come,” said John.
He also remembered how, when the flat was almost completely covered in darkness, he had forced himself up from the floor, stumbled across the room and onto the sofa, pulled the blanket up over his head and tried to go to sleep.
Round tables were placed around a dance floor that occupied the middle of the outdoor space, a few people were dancing.
”Ah. You’re up,” Sherlock looked almost startled to find John standing there. Perhaps he was dealing with the same sense of uncertainty about how to proceed.
John laughs as he hangs his jacket on a hanger (neat, orderly), and Sherlock gets all warm inside. To hear John’s laugh again, it’s.. it’s..
He sighs, heavily. "Harry, please don't-"
It had felt… so good. Too good. He had let down his guard and allowed himself to bask in the warm, shining light that was John. It had felt wonderful but had ruined months of hard work.
”God, John, yes, yes,” Sherlock moaned in return, and that in itself was almost enough to push John over the edge.
”What? What the hell is that supposed to mean?” Gabe was waving his arms around. He looked angry.
“Sure. Good night, John. Or should I say goodbye.” She turned around and walked out of the kitchen, he heard her tired steps as she retreated to the upper floor.
When John thought about it all now, he really felt, strongly and deeply, that their relationship – and his love for Sherlock – had begun the moment they first met, in the lab at S:t Bart's, and then it had just kept developing.
At some unknown point during the night, John stirs. He’s drifting in that strange place between sleep and wakefulness, faintly aware of the compact darkness both outside the window and in the room. His entire body is lit up with a strong, tingling arousal; an urgent wish for
“Yes?”
Sherlock doesn't want John's daughter at Baker Street, and he's jealous of the time John spends with her.
He needed to reply. Say something appropriate.
John stops himself again, then looks up. ”Not like you called me a whole bunch of times, either.”
A little bubble of hope begins to form in Sherlock’s chest as he stands there, alone in his bordering-on-OCD-level of clean kitchen.
John’s phone buzzed again.
”I just need a little time to adjust, it’s okay, don’t you dare.”
Sherlock looked uncomfortable, and apparently felt the need to keep explaining.
”Yes, about that, John-” She lowers her voice. ”Can I have a quick word with you, if you don’t mind?”
Sherlock, still in character, looked at the man and nodded, his eyebrows slightly raised.
“Funny.”
As before, it started out light, tentative, but in a matter of seconds, their kisses went from soft to hard. Then it all got frantic.
“Please John... I want you to do what you promised. John-” Sherlock's body was moving so insistently against John, it made him feel dizzy with want. This was really going to happen.
”John,” he whispered.
”What the hell is this, Sherlock, hm. You bring me back here, after a year and a half of silence, and you strip naked and we have sex and now you’re just going to throw me out! Well that’s-” John’s voice cracked, he inhaled sharply through his nostrils, ”That’s really so fucked up I can’t even-”
