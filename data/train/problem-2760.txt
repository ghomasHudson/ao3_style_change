But he does as Dean asked and climbs into bed.  He makes a face and pulls the blue-footed bird doll from under the covers where Miracle buried it.
He half expects her to have changed her mind, but the relief in her voice is audible when she answers the phone.  She calls him a lifesaver (more gratitude than she showed when he literally saved her life) and rambles about the dogs for a full minute, then tries to buy him a plane ticket, and when he refuses, insists she'll be paying for his gas mileage in addition to his time.
“Pretty sure I’m sleeping right now.”  Dean gives up trying to know who he’s talking to and keeps his eyes fixed ahead; the road outside the car is black as night, the headlights just two meaningless spots of white in the dark.
Adam drops by a little later with an honest-to-Jack sack of gifts.  When he sees Sam, he rummages in his bag and produces a headband with reindeer antlers attached.  In wordless agreement, Dean puts them on Sam’s head and poses beside his brother while Adam snaps a picture.
Cas inspects the package, and Dean gestures to him that he can go ahead and open it if he wants.  “Thanks.”
Eileen doesn’t do Christmas, but she’s clearly entertained by Sam’s enthusiasm.  He takes over Dean’s kitchen for a number of baking experiments, entirely too many of which are vegan, for fuck’s sake.  Eileen has been staying with them on and off since Thanksgiving.  She still does her own thing, takes her own jobs with the hunters she knows, but she keeps coming back to watch Sam bake cookies or do his secretive online shopping or hang shiny dollar-store baubles from the Christmas tree.  The bunker was built to hold a lot more than four people, so having her around shouldn’t make Dean feel crowded, but it does.
He hopes that will settle this thing, but Sam is not so easily appeased when he feels like he has something to atone for.
He’s asleep at the kitchen table with the empty bottle beside him when a sound wakes him up.  A door, somewhere in the bunker, slams shut.
“My girlfriend made pie.  For Thanksgiving I usually just do takeout, order the orphan special.  But she had to go and make a meal out of it.”
Eileen signs, “Slow down.”  Dean knows that one, because it gets a lot of use when Sam goes into geek mode.
He would really, really prefer not to, but he’s trying very hard not to piss off any new preternatural beings.  And maybe it’s wishful thinking, but this one sounds less murdery than its predecessors.  He steps through the door and walks between the shelves to the front desk, keeping his hands in sight as he approaches.  Nice, non-threatening Dean Winchester, making no sudden moves.
“If the walls aren’t walls, why do the headphones need to be headphones?”  Brady stares blankly.  “Wouldn’t headphones defeat the purpose of a welcoming atmosphere?”
“Yeah, I know you don’t need it, but you were stuck in that hell-void for six months, so.”  He offers Cas the peppermint bark, the banana, the shitty waffles.  He just gets a deepening frown in response.
Dean tries again.  “The past six months, I’ve been trying to figure out how to be happy.  But I guess in the process I accidentally got you dragged back here.  And I am sorry for that.”
He doesn’t have much to compare with except what he’s seen on TV, but their Christmas is probably weird as hell, the four of them sitting around the tree in the middle of the afternoon because they were too busy dealing with the ongoing metaphysical soap opera that is their lives to open presents in the morning like Dean is pretty sure normal people do.
Dean seriously doubts that, but the rest doesn’t surprise him.  Michael didn’t exactly take his father’s betrayal well.
He gets a burger from a drive-thru in town and only feeds Miracle one french fry because the vet in Lebanon said they’re not good for him.  They’re probably not great for Dean either but free will means he can make his own informed decision to put delicious garbage in his body, especially when there’s nobody there but his dog to tell him he should be taking better care of himself.
Brady nods apologetically.  “I’m afraid my catalog is limited.  When I visit the mortal world, it is rarely for the purposes of appreciating human music.”
“Just the past few weeks.  Now she and Sam are…”  He loses track of his words, because Cas has moved to the far side of the bed and sits holding the blankets aside.  An invitation.  “What?”
“Not on purpose,” Dean says, and he can feel Sam’s eyes on him, and he knows this is doing absolutely nothing to convince his brother that he didn’t know this was going to happen.  Cas is now watching Adam, his eyes narrowed.  Dean’s pretty sure he covered the whole Adam-and-Michael thing in their talk earlier, but it’s hard to say what Cas actually took in.  “You wanna open them?”
“You look constipated,” Dean tells Sam from the doorway of his room, as Sam straightens his tie in the mirror for the sixth time.
“Hello, Sam,” Cas says, in exactly the same tone he has always said those words.  To Dean, he says, “It’s Christmas.”
Seems Eileen is trying to hook him up with more than just a case, and he doesn’t know how to tell her that he doesn’t really… do that, anymore.
“Right.”  Dean leaves his boots beside Cas’s shoes on the floor.  He hands Cas his dinner, grabs his own, and sits beside Cas on the bed and tries to keep himself from counting back to the last time he got into bed with another person.  Cas pulls the sheets and blankets over them both.
“I was drunk,” Dean adds, probably unnecessarily, but in his experience it’s better to have these things out in the open.
Dean gets in his car.  Dog in the backseat, Cas beside him, snacks and a terrible present from a good friend, a new mixtape.  People are waiting for him when he gets back, but not worrying about him too much because it’s
“Uh, yeah.  Actually, these are for you.”  He gathers the blue-and-silver parcels in his arms, but Cas is distracted by the tree.
“That they basically pestered the Empty into spitting you out.”  Cas’s always-intense gaze seems turned up to eleven.  “Is that right?”
He hadn’t really thought about it like that, but it was one of the fun things about raising Jack, back when raising Jack was something they were doing as a family and not just a seemingly endless series of tragedies and impossible choices.
They carry him—Cas, Cas, Cas—to a spare room and lay him, or rather, drop him awkwardly, because he weighs more than a couple feathers, onto the bed.  He lies there, like—well, the expression Dean would use is “dead to the world,” but apparently…
He swallows down all he’d rather be saying (or doing).  “Are you gonna keep avoiding the subject of what happened to you?”
“Today is Christmas,” Dean argues, and Sam gestures for Adam to leave it alone.  Dean takes a couple candy canes as well.  There is clearly a limit to how much Sam is willing to push him around right now, and Dean is so not above milking Sam’s Dean-is-going-through-something-right-now attitude for all it’s worth.
“‘Look at you, planning for the future,’” Cas says, the same words Dean heard in his head the night before.
He stops himself, but Dean knows.  “You thought Emily.”  Sam grimaces.  “Emily has a girlfriend,” Dean adds, because Sam isn’t wrong often enough that it stops being fun to rub it in when it happens.
“So,” Dean says as Miracle shakes melting snow out of his fur, “You wanna tell me what’s going on with you?”
What?  If it were him, he’d be glad to be rid of the son-of-a-bitch angel that had been riding around in his skin all this time.  Except it’s not him, because it’s Adam, so technically Dean has no idea what he must be feeling right now.  To lose someone who was that close to him for such a long time.
But the key is still stuck in the wall, the outline of the door around it, just like it was last time Dean saw it.  No wonder the dog doesn’t want anything to do with this room.
“I’m pretty sure they don’t, they were just calling tech support on what happened to be the week of Christmas.”
So he leaves her there and lets Sam drag him (gently) out of the room.  Dean washes his face, puts on fresh clothes, steals one of Adam’s Eggos, and goes to the storeroom to see for himself that the door is gone.  It’s like it was never there.  Sam has put the key back into its box for safekeeping and the wall is now conspicuously bare—the only part of the room where Sam’s holiday spirit didn’t quite spread—but otherwise unremarkable.
After trying from several angles, he gives the key a final pull and it gives way—and the entire door comes with it.
So much for Sam's “no concept of linear time” theory.  He eases the box onto the desk and sets the dusty tape deck on top.  “Wanted to make sure I got you a good assortment of human music to go with your new, uh, style.”  This he addresses to the posters now adorning the walls around the desk.
“Yeah, well.”  It’s true he’s been avoiding this room, its memories and its cold walls and its darkness.  There’s nothing to fear, though, and maybe there never was; the things that haunt him are gone and Cas is here next to him.  The dark and the cold and the memories all suck, but he’s lived through worse.  “How are you holding up?”
Dean wants to go stand beside Cas because that’s where he always wants to be.  He doesn’t step over the threshold.  Wants to.  Doesn’t.  Wants to.
He waits, but she doesn’t elaborate.  If they’re gonna make a habit of having awkward heart-to-hearts on holidays, okay, but she needs to give him something to work with.  “And?”
“Engaged,” Dean says, but his brain feels like it’s full of cotton and white noise and the four feet of empty space between his body and Cas’s.  “Didn’t I tell you that already?”
“I’ve been so happy, these past few months, and I knew you were dealing with stuff, but it didn’t even occur to me that you were dealing with completely different stuff than I was.  I thought—”
“No change,” Eileen tells him, and he signs back a thank-you because that’s one even an idiot can learn.
“I think she’s bisexual,” Dean says, a little based on some things she’s said but mostly to try out saying the word.  He doesn’t make eye contact with Sam as he says it.  “But I don’t think it would have worked out even if she were single.  She’s a bit…”
“The shirt.  How bad are we talking?  And can I just emphasize that I have a lot of respect for you.  As a person.”  He leaves the note beside the bed and gets the hell out of there.  Because of Cas really can hear what people say while he’s out… yeah.  He heads for the kitchen, figuring he’s got a little time before Sam takes over to prepare his Christmas dinner atrocity.
When all the other gifts have been unwrapped Dean is left with a cookbook, a Santa hat, a pile of things for Cas, and an abrupt need to be elsewhere.  Adam is already deep in one of the books Sam got him; Eileen is wrestling with the packaging on her new socks while Sam unhelpfully helps.  Then Sam’s eyes catch on something over Dean’s shoulder.
“Is that what this is about?  Lots of people don’t finish college.  Hell, some of us don’t even go in the first place.”
His vigil feels different now, like he actually knows what he’s waiting for rather than just feeling around pointlessly in the dark.  Cas woke up, he’ll wake up again.  Dean brought food and water.  He woke up.  He’ll wake up again.  Dean can’t even bring himself to pace when it could happen at any moment.
Since there’s nobody but the faint twang of Johnny Cash to stop him, Dean starts in on the Boston cream, even though it’s basically cake.
So Dean tells the story, how everything was gone but him and Sam and Jack and Chuck, the archangel fistfight in the bunker library, how they realized what Jack was becoming.  How it ended, with Jack putting back everyone Chuck had sent away, even the dog.
Adam tends to stay neutral when Sam and Dean go at it.  He’s probably had enough sibling rivalry that he’s set for eternity.  He watches in silence for a few minutes, with an expression that Dean has come to recognize as his here-and-also-elsewhere look.
The paper is written and drawn all over, the kind of stuff that would scream crazy to anyone less familiar with what it’s like on the inside of an angel’s brain.  Abstract shapes and half-faces and stars and mathematical equations and words and phrases that sound familiar, like he heard them in one of his various freaky dreams.  In the center of it all is Dean’s own writing,
He feels pathetic, useless, but Sam doesn’t give him any crap for it, just steps forward cautiously and crouches beside the still form that lies face-down on the floor.
Dean backs into the hallway, nearly tripping over Miracle, who is sticking anxiously close to his legs.  There is, in fact, a sign taped to the door:
“He was a stray.”  Miracle has followed him into the kitchen, where the sound of the television fades into country music while the dog gazes up at Dean with mournful, ate-dinner-five-hours-ago eyes.
Sam wavers, probably wanting to push it but also he keeps looking at Dean like he thinks he could break down at any moment.
“I am aware,” they say.  “I am working on a solution.  In the meantime, we will be, in a certain sense, neighbors.  I have no interest in revisiting old grievances.  If there is anything within the scope of my power that I might assist you with, please do let me know.”
His smile might be the most beautiful thing Dean has ever seen.  Dean can feel his own face trying to match it, albeit a little more watery.
“I resolved the situation.  Understand, Dean Winchester, this is not a bargain; no deal has been struck.  You owe me nothing.”
“Don’t you want to celebrate saving the world, you know, again?  That this is our first year ever free of Chuck’s plan?”  With a sheepish look to the side he adds, “How about the fact that I just got engaged?”
Cas is still conked out on the bed, but that could mean anything, in the grand scheme of the universe.
The library is empty except for Brady, and silent.  Maybe the Reaper librarians really did dig the music.
Adam emerges from his research cave for the promise of pie, of which they have three kinds, which Sam calls “overkill” and Dean calls “the entire point of this stupid-ass holiday.”  Sam made pumpkin and Dean made apple and Eileen arrived the night before with Boston cream and the intention to stay the whole weekend and it’s freaking hilarious how Sam can’t even pretend to be mad about the amount of sugar in the pies after that news.
The new Death seems… not so bad.  Dresses like a twelve-year-old’s idea of a vampire, talks like a cross between a dictionary and a robot, is not actively trying to kill Dean or anyone he knows personally.  A marked improvement on previous incarnations of Death.  Dean hasn’t been back to the library since he delivered the stuff, but he was thinking about dropping in sometime just to see how things are going.  He was thinking about dropping in on Death.
Dean’s pretty sure he would have risked dismantling the fabric of the universe for the possibility of seeing Cas again, except for the whole thing where he knew it would piss Cas the hell off.  Brady says Cas chose this, and Dean doesn’t know what to do with that.  After hearing Brady’s whole speech, he gets part of it, at least.  It’s not just about string.
Cas is (was) (is) one of Dean’s favorite people in the vast multiverse, and Dean kind of thought he’d have better taste.
He cleans the kitchen.  He walks the dog.  He goes to bed.  He dreams he’s chasing shadows in the dark, and the shadows are made of folk music.
“We could probably get something secondhand if you need one,” Sam tells him. “What exactly are we talking about here?”
Cas manages to stop laughing long enough to lift his right hand and tap his left shoulder.  “You called, I answered.”
“I think I will remain conscious.”  He shivers a little, though.  Dean decides getting him warm takes priority over getting answers, and ushers him on back to his room.
“This is not a gift, either.  Castiel is an autonomous entity, and not a thing to be given.  The choice was his.”
There’s the blanket crumpled at the foot of the bed, the cup still on the floor, granola bars eaten, Cas’s shoes on the floor.  His socks, too.
“Does it help if I point out that the world ending is not a good alternative to having a hard conversation with your girlfriend?  Speaking from experience here.”
It started as a vague idea in the back of Dean’s mind as he watched Cas in the bunker the first few days, moving through good moments and bad.  He’d be friendly with Eileen and then snippy with Sam and then downright hostile towards Adam in the space of five minutes and Dean loves him, always, and would be happy to just sit back with a bowl of popcorn and watch the chaos, but he started to wonder if Cas’s adjustment to his new existence might benefit from a change of scenery.  You know, not being in the same underground bunker with the same four people (and one dog) 24/7.  Except taking him out on a hunt seemed like an even worse idea.  So Dean was stuck.
Dean eases him back onto the bed and Cas doesn’t argue.  He sits on the edge of the bed and stares at the ceiling.  Dean has to call his name a couple times to get his attention, and when he has it, it’s in the form of an annoyed glare.
Dean grabs Cas’s hand and finds it ice-cold.  “For fuck’s sake.  We’re going inside.”  He whistles for the dog and pulls Cas back into the garage.
When it’s clear (at least, as clear as anything on this weird-ass morning) that Cas is not waking up again anytime soon, Sam says, “OK, time to go.”
“You just said that if you—if Death has the freedom to choose who lives and dies, then it’s a problem.  I’ve been down that road, it’s not pretty.”
Emily rolls her eyes.  “I call her Ava.  But her full given name is Avalanche, because I made the mistake of letting my girlfriend pick.”
He takes his packages back to his room, because Sam would probably be pissed if he catches Dean not keeping his Christmas purchases secret.  Not because he can’t deal with what is happening in this room.  It’s fine, it’s great, he just needs to be somewhere else right now.
No other sound.  No, wait, that’s weird.  The bunker hasn’t been this quiet for this long in months.
Death looks from Dean to the red and green garland that for some reason is draped around the shelves even in this creepy-ass room.  They tilt their head to the side and narrow their eyes and Dean feels a little sick to his stomach.  Probably too much nog, that’s what it is.
They get in the car and drive a ways until they hit a town Dean doesn’t recognize, then Dean picks a direction and they start walking under the cold, clear December sky.  Dean is glad for his coat while Miracle with his thick, curly fur seems pretty impervious to the weather.
There’s a new freedom now—the freedom of knowing he could get in his car and drive all day and into night, Cas in the passenger seat, home and holidays and movie night and the rest of his family waiting when the road brings them back this way.  He can send postcards from Houston or Sioux Falls or Wisconsin or wherever in the meantime.
Adam goes and leaves Dean with Cas and his shoes, but he’s back a minute later carrying Eileen’s blanket.
“The Shadow messed with your people, and you found a way to annoy it into solving a problem for you.”
voice.  He turns and the car crashes or the world ends and he wakes up, tangled in the blanket with Miracle standing on his chest.
“I’m doing mine after you old farts go to bed.  Sam’s always out by ten anyway.  Twenty bucks says he falls asleep in front of the TV.”
After a long pause, Adam says, “I made a speech, didn’t I?  I never used to make speeches.  There’s a part of me that’s kind of Michael now, which is, honestly, so weird.”
He’s worn out when he gets back to the bunker, more than he would have expected.  He goes directly to his room, this time remembering to let Miracle in before he shuts the door.  With the dog at the foot of his bed and a fair bit less alcohol in his system, he’s hoping for a more restful night.
He sorts through the yard sale box and and his own collection, accumulated over many years of designing quality soundtracks for cross-country drives.  His tapes are mostly called things like “Road Trip #12” and “Awesome Stuff” and “Sam's Girly Mix.”  (Sam swoops in to confiscate the latter at the last minute, good riddance).  Dean sacrifices a few of the older ones to the donation box, especially the ones that seem to have a weirdly high percentage of Queen songs.  He plans to give Death most of the yard sale stuff.  (Opera.  So much opera.)
“Oh, I just told my girlfriend what I do for a living, twenty minutes before she left town to spend Hanukkah with her parents.  Smart, right?”
Dean hears the chair creak behind him and can picture Sam flailing awake.  “I’m up.  What’s going on?”
Adam’s idea of cooking breakfast is thawing Eggos in the toaster and eating them plain while they’re still pale yellow and squishy.  Even if he were offering pancakes and bacon Dean’s pretty sure he couldn’t eat.
After a long pause, she says, “She knows I’m not telling her everything.  And I don’t know how long she’s going to wait.”
The week after Thanksgiving, Sam goes out alone and comes back with an eight-foot pine tree strapped to the roof of his car.
“Seems like him,” Sam says.  “Except for, you know, inexplicably unconscious.  How did he even get here?”  He looks at Dean like he’s supposed to know.
Knowing that no matter what kind of argument he used, it would be a lost battle against this overexcited version of his daughter, Dean sighed and pulled out his phone.
Just as he got back from bringing Gracie her morning tea, a ring on his laptop let him know that he had an incoming call. Quickly fetching his own tea, he sat down and accepted the call, smiling when the video popped up.
. Skirting the line of pretending they weren’t both still thinking about the past. Weren’t both still remembering how much Dean had hurt him? How would they ever move past it if they never spoke of or resolved it? “I am so sorry I just let you run away that day. You have no idea –”
“No, let me,” Michael interrupted, holding up his hand in an appeasing way, his voice never rising from its usual calm tone. “Please, let me say my piece.”
“Just throw it on the floor,” Dean mumbled, tugging on Cas’ arm again. No stupid towel was worth not having Cas in his arms right away. Arms he already held open, eyes still closed, drifting even further.
Moving on, Dean kept his eyes far ahead, trying to smother the growing fear that something had happened. When he got to the crossroads that either led him on the path he usually took back home or the way towards the Shurley mansion Cas must have taken every morning, he stopped Cherry for real, just standing there, waiting.
To his great delight, Cas did not seem to care at all, quite the contrary, in fact. Resting his head on Dean’s chest, he snuggled closer still and within a few heartbeats, he was boneless and relaxed, his breaths evening out. Telling Dean that he was already in the land of dreams.
Cas to know. “She looked like an angel and she told me that she wanted me to be happy again,” he finally pressed out, and he knew the smile on his lips was probably a soft one, even though he felt a familiar pang of melancholy. He always did and he probably always would when he talked about Lisa. “I mean, she mostly just smiled at me and was just
. When Cas spread his legs even further to give Dean more room between them, Dean had to tame himself to not just rut against him like a horny teenager. Instead, he kept the movement slow, almost lazily, as he let himself all too happily be pulled into another deep kiss. The sweet taste was almost enough to distract him from Cas’ next words.
As they watched the little group prepare the first load of fireworks, he nuzzled against Cas’ hair before finally whispering into Cas’ ear. “I was thinking… Are you still trying to convince me that there’s a better author?”
The moment he crowded into Cas’ space, even those last details fell away, and without any hesitation, he cupped Cas’ cheek and leaned forward, catching Cas’ lips, kissing him for all the world to see.
Once again, Dean read over the words - satisfied with them, even though he wanted to say more. So much more. But for now… for now, this would have to be enough.
Yet, all in all, Dean was glad when the door to his classroom finally closed for the last time that day and a deep sigh left him as the corridors emptied.
wanted to go home, Dean was sure he could call a colleague, make sure someone was there to supervise the students until he got back.
“Of course,” she finally answered his question as she took his gift while handing him hers. “But you first, Daddy.”
“I sure think I did,” Alice replied in a chipper voice. “Though we did stray from the topic somewhat.”
The constant bad mood hung over him like the sword of Damocles and he needed to really pull himself out of it when, just on time, the Skype ringtone called him to the couch.
. They should not be burdened with any problems aside from homework and who to ask to the next prom. Dean knew that that was an utopian wish. Had learned it first hand in his own youth.
For now, though, he watched as the two friends hugged goodbye and when Cas stepped back to his side, snaking his arm around his middle, Dean rested his over Cas’ shoulder. Cas’ other hand had found Gracie’s in the most natural of ways, as if she simply belonged to his side, and the simple gesture made Dean’s heart soar. He pulled Cas closer to press a kiss to his temple, already steering them away from the town square. There was only so long Stars Hollow could collectively hold its breath and Dean could feel the time ticking down. The wave was about to crash – and crash it did the moment they stepped foot on the street. As soon as they left the square, people seemed to find their breath and their voice again and everyone had a word to say about what they had just seen. About Cas’ and Dean’s love life.
Charlie and Jo joined him a few minutes later, the two looking amazing in their outfits. Now that they were six friends, Cas had the idea to go as one big rainbow – and for the first time in years, his two friends had given in and agreed to
Somewhere in the middle of their tale about the country - which, surprisingly, seemed to be one of their favorites so far - Grace had joined them, already ready and quite awake. Seemingly, she could hardly wait to leave for the fair.
It was the night of September 18th – a date Dean would probably never forget again because it was the day his three months in
He liked to keep tabs on some of his former students, so he knew that Miss Masters was a detective over in Hartford. But he hadn’t heard much more of her. However, before he could ask after her welfare, a more insistent shush shut them both up again. Dean pressed his lips together to keep from laughing and the look he shared with Cas left him glad to know they were both grinning at the situation, no hint of discomfort showing on Cas’ part.
He had an inkling by now where this was going. More like, he had known the moment he had seen Michael, he just hadn’t been sure which approach his friend would take.
He did register when the talk going on turned towards the snowman contest, but he still didn’t jump in, letting his daughter enjoy the call with her aunts until she had to leave to get ready. After all, she wanted to be at the square in about an hour.
“And what would be wrong with that?” Cas asked right away, his tone of voice as well as the squinted eyes challenging Dean.
Maybe she could’ve been;  in a world without soulmates, who knew what would’ve been possible. Maybe he would’ve fallen in love with her – maybe he could even now, one day, if he really gave her a chance.
Watching his daughter now, seeing how happy she was, the way it bubbled out of her as she bounced around the kitchen, making cookies with her Grandma... Dean knew
It touched a core inside of Dean… but he found he wasn’t mad at Cas for making Gracie worry. He was simply relieved to have him back at their side.
“I … yeah, I guess he is.” There wasn’t much guessing to do. Not after he’d seen him run away. God, he hoped Michael had gotten to him before he could do something stupid.
So far in his young daughter’s life, there had already been a few hard conversations they had to have. From her mother’s death over natural things like love, all the way to her accident and the following injury. But no matter how many difficult talks they had – it never got any easier.
avoiding him. He’d obviously stopped running, or maybe he was taking another route, or whatever. Dean knew for sure because, yes, damnit, even though it hurt like a bitch every damn time, Dean never missed a morning ride. Just in case.
Dean tried to rein in his grin, but it was simply impossible. This was too fucking amusing - and Cas was… well, he was damn sexy when he was pissed.
Bart seemed to contemplate and for a split second, Dean was thankful it was him and not one of Cas’ siblings. It would probably have taken a lot more than that to convince them – but Rebecca’s husband simply nodded and opened the door further while stepping aside.
Pressing her close to him, he was contemplating leaving, getting them out of this throng of people, when none other than Patty spoke up.
The concierge gave him a smile and pointed to the elevators. “Mr. James’ penthouse is on the top level, his door is the closest to the elevators.”
“Whatever,” she mumbled, letting go of him and leaving in the direction of her first class without even looking back at her father.
“Fine with me,” he told him honestly, not able to help the wink as he let go of his hand. “Come on, Gracie. Time to go home.”
“He’s in publishing,” he said, trotting out the lie Cas had told everyone in Stars Hollow. “He works in his family’s publishing business, editing or something.”
His words alone seemed to elicit a groan from Cas, a beautiful sound that Dean could get lost in. A few heartbeats later, Cas’ arm wound around his back and when Dean realized he wanted to change position, he went willingly. Happily rolling onto his own back, happily letting Cas take the lead. Happily letting Cas show him what he liked.
Great, so obviously Jo had told her about the incident itself. “Don’t blow it up like that, Jo. Cas had a crush, so what? It’s been a long time.”
There was hope in her eyes but he watched it wither away the longer she looked at him. Hugging her pillow close, she let her gaze sink to the ground.
. Just feel the man he loved tremble under his ministrations, feel the smooth skin under his lips, feel the flesh of his ass under one hand and the muscles flex under the other.
There was no way for him to stop the feral growl at hearing Cas tease him like that. There was no way for him to slow down, barely enough presence of mind to make sure Cas wouldn’t hurt himself as Dean crowded him against the door. And there certainly was no way for him to keep his lips and hands away from Cas; kissing and sucking and nibbling on his neck while he also tried to get rid of that offensive hoodie still in the way. When it was finally gone, giving his lips access to even more delicate skin, Dean let his hands wander lower. In one quick and smooth motion, he took hold of the back of Cas’ thighs, lifting him up so he could press even closer.
He wanted to believe it. So badly. But there were things he was sure his daughter didn’t know. Encounters between them Gracie hadn’t witnessed and most likely hadn’t heard about either.
Zar might look and sound like a douchebag – but the protectiveness oozed out of him. He genuinely cared for Cas and for his well-being and Dean had an inkling he was only being polite because… well, he actually had no idea why. Dean was pretty sure if the roles had been reversed, he would’ve punched his smug face.
“How long has it been since the last book was published and the last movie aired? Yet still, people read it, talk about it, define themselves by the Hogwarts House they would be in.”
“Okay, Cas,” Dean spoke up, mostly to reassure Cas but it also had the advantage of getting his head back in the game. “One step at a time. Don’t rush it.”
Either way, they were all perfect angels – which in itself was a bother to Dean. Usually, his class was loud, full of laughter and productive energy. Now it was just boring work and he hated to see how lackluster his students were because of it.
With an annoyed groan, he dropped the fork and pushed the plate away from him, leaning on the table before realizing he needed his hands to sign back to his sister-in-law. Making sure the other judges were still immersed in their conversations, Dean turned to Eileen. The last thing he needed was for Patty to catch a word of what he was going to tell Eileen now, so he kept his hands low.
“Well,” Dean began, brushing a damp strand of hair from where it was plastered to Cas’ forehead. “Maybe because I gave you enough reason to be unsure about this? About us? I don’t know. Guess I– I just wanna make sure you… you know?”
Pulling his girl close, he handed her a tissue and then covered them both with a fluffy blanket. When she snuggled into his side, they continued sitting in silence, absentmindedly staring at the still muted TV.
Chuckling, Dean shook his head. “Get out of here, before I give you those twenty questions after all,” he replied in good humor, happy to see that Andrew’s smile only grew bigger while he waved at Dean and finally left the room.
Dean had browsed the Christmas shelves to distract himself while waiting for his daughter to decide between the two objects she held in her hands and when his eyes had landed on a certain DVD, he had huffed a laugh and looked heavenwards.
Gracie had long since gone to sleep when Dean made himself comfortable in his bed. His thoughts and feelings had been
Tomorrow, they would drink a whiskey together and the rivalry would be forgotten. At least until the next contest.
“Yeah, but... C. S. James? Really? Castiel Shurley James?” Dean couldn’t help but tease. “I mean I’m surprised there aren’t a lot more people who have figured it out.”
With C’s help, Dean had realized that the only reason he didn’t feel ready yet was the missing education, the thought of not being enough – but yes, also that nagging feeling that his parents would always be disappointed in him if he didn’t go to college. Now he did and he couldn’t be happier to have taken that step.
He almost sighed in relief when Cas didn’t ask anything but simply tucked the card under the wrapped gift and then paid his full attention to that. It didn’t look easy, unwrapping a gift with a cast on one hand, but Cas managed rather well. It seemed he had already gotten used to working around the restrictions.
Sam and Eileen didn’t leave until after dinner, promising to be back early tomorrow so they could get ready together. Bobby left with them, leaving Dean and Gracie to snuggle up on the couch and watch some Christmas movies together.
Looking up, Dean gazed at his own reflection in the mirror - cheeks flushed pink, bottom lip swollen from where he had bit it, eyes shining bright - and he knew, he just
The fake groans of the two men filled his ear but all he could hear was Cas’ rough voice. His grip around his rapidly filling cock became stronger - the stokes rougher.
Next time, we'll see fluffy family time with the Winchesters, Charlie and Jo calling from Paris, and Gracie and Dean having a
“Well, I guess that’s it then,” he said, miraculously able to press words past the bile threatening to spill over. “Have a wonderful life in New York.”
He took his sweet time cleaning Cas from all the sweat and cum, enjoying the appreciative moan and the relaxed face and the satisfied smile playing around his lips. As soon as he was done, Dean carelessly dropped the towel to the floor and was back in bed in a heartbeat; back in Cas’ arms, back where he belonged, kissing every inch of his face.
It wasn’t until he became aware of the sticky mess between them that he deemed himself the responsible one this time. It was only fair, after all, Cas had taken the burden of getting up the last time. So he slowly pulled out of Cas and moved to sit up.
When on his last words, he poked Dean in his chest, Dean was quick enough to grab for his hand, holding him tight and not letting go. He wouldn’t risk Cas running away like this. Not a chance in hell! He could be angry at him all he wanted – but he would
“Joshua did that for you, so no worries.” The man’s eyes kept drilling into him, making Dean feel scrutinized in ways he never had before. Finally, rather reluctantly in Dean’s opinion, Zar asked, “Would you like to come in? You can wait for him.”
“I hope you can live with Zar’s choice of a meat lovers pizza because I’m sure as hell not sharing my pepperoni.”
“What?” Realisation dawned as they continued to gape at him. They likely wondered what he was doing here so early. “Hey, last day of school,” he explained before either of them could say anything. “You really think I’d stay any longer than I really had to? Especially when I have more school duties to handle this afternoon?”
Watching after them, Dean was only pulled back to the matter at hand when he heard some chuckle behind him, turning towards the gaggle of girls.
And Dean knew he could trust that promise. Letting go of all the tension and nervous feelings, he let himself fall back into the moment.
, rang loud and clear in Dean’s mind every step of the way. Words that he had quickly copied from his arm, written down on a piece of paper before they would vanish from his skin. The blue paper was still pinned to his wall next to his bed and whenever he doubted himself, he would look at it – wishing that he could see it in his soulmate’s handwriting again but knowing this was good enough for now.
“It’s... it’s this stupid legend and the taste of those damn cookies. It’s the smell that reminds me of... of
Until Cas abruptly jerked away from him, his gaze so quickly morphing into one of distaste it gave Dean whiplash. But it was also like a bucket of icy water and by the time Cas was already shaking his head in disbelief, it was as if Dean woke from a daze.
As most teenagers were prone to doing, his class had seemed to have forgotten about - or at least accepted - his weird behavior by the end of the week, and as Dean entered the room this morning, there seemed to be no trace left of them being scared by their favorite teacher.
Was Cas’ hand shaking? The smile he gave Gracie was definitely forced. Was he eyeing the cookie suspiciously?
“Yeah,” Dean replied, trying to find a plausible excuse. “But you seem to have bonded so much with the two women in my life that I just know you’d find a way to evade me again by talking to them all night long.”
Searching for anything to distract him, he switched on his laptop and went to Youtube, mindlessly watching videos. As he sometimes did, he took out a piece of paper and began doodling around as he let those videos numb his mind.
After a short break - most likely to be filled with some short movies from Disney - the list morphed into family movies, starting with
When Cas finally talked again, Dean knew he would never, ever forget this moment. The words sounded so surreal and held so much meaning, and they cut right to his heart.
Knowing he always felt a little more open-minded late at night, Dean let his mind wander. He needed to know, once and for all, if he was actually attracted to Cas. If he could see himself in a sexual relationship with him.
Catching Cas’ gaze when Cas glanced at him briefly, they exchanged some tight smiles but soon enough, Cas’ left hand covered Dean’s again, holding as tight as the cast allowed; reassuring each other that that time was way past them.
His soulmate’s name, he finally knew it. It was Cas and Dean was grinning like a fool just thinking about it.
Cas. He hadn’t thought about his theory in a while, other revelations much more pressing. But all their talk about authors yesterday and today… well, it had gotten him to think again.
Maybe he didn’t have faith anymore – but he also didn’t have the heart to throw any of these things away.
Dean had to bite his lips to keep from chuckling. Seemed like he wasn’t the only one who needed to ditch questions that couldn’t be answered all that innocently. Sure they were going to come home soon… but probably not before taking a little while to themselves to just… well.
The arms around him tightened, one leg even came up to wind around him; Cas practically clinging to him as he pressed a soft kiss to Dean’s temple.
All contemplating thoughts were chased away the second the car turned onto the ranch and the door to the main house flew open. Gracie raced down the path and Dean could see Sam and Eileen step out onto the porch, with Bobby lingering in the door. The car came to a stop and to Dean’s delight, Gracie aimed for the driver’s side instead of the passenger, throwing herself against Cas before the man had even fully stepped out of the car. Dean could hear his soft grunt as the little wrecking ball tackled him, chuckling when he watched Cas try to find his footing so they wouldn’t stumble.
Dean replied, glad he didn’t have to talk. There was a huge lump in his throat and he tried to swallow past it.
Seeing the insecurity in Cas’ eyes though, Dean threw all these bad ideas to the wind, sighing over his own stupidity. This was a talk that should have happened long before they made it this far and it might have if Dean had only tried harder. Or if he would have had his shit together sooner. As it was, they at least had to discuss some of those things now or neither of them would be able to fully enjoy what they were both so clearly looking forward to.
Sam ended the hug with a clap to his back – and once again, he thought about all the ways to block Sam’s attempts at a conversation, when Sam simply pointed upstairs.
But it was the only way Dean could describe what was happening here. He forgot he’d even argued with Sam, nor did he hear any possible answer his brother was giving him. Cas’ gaze was burning into him, sending his heart racing even though it was over within the blink of an eye. Cas simply moved on and let his gaze wander further, giving not even a little indication that he’d recognized him.
. Realizing quickly that Cas was – rightfully – angry at him, Dean also had a feeling that something weird was going on. This was so not like Cas.
about what he was about to see or hear. But it seemed enough and finally, Gracie nodded and began anew.
After today - after what had just happened between them; after all those emotions he had finally come to terms with - it simply felt like it wasn’t enough. Picking up the card, he stared at the emptiness on the inside, his thoughts fleeting, not able to concentrate.
With the Braedens living over on the West Coast, family visits were rare over the course of the year - which was why Grace enjoyed every minute she got with her grandparents. It was also the reason she hadn’t complained when her time with Cas was cut short today so they could get to the airport on time.
He also shot a quick text to Charlie, grinning when his friend sent him back a picture of Jo and herself in their own outfits, strolling along the street that led from their home to Dean and Cas’ house. Quickly putting on the finishing touches, Dean made sure he hadn’t forgotten anything – wallet, keys, phone, check, check, check – and then left the house.
If he had to name the feeling inside of him at that realization, he would say it was relief – even though it didn’t make sense in the slightest. Or did it? Maybe he was just relieved he hadn’t missed some huge milestones in his friend’s life.
If Dean was being honest, not much about the next few minutes registered aside from Cas’ hand in his and how he pulled him along. Somewhere in the back of his mind, he knew Cas had officially introduced him to Joshua, the nice doorman, but that was as far as his brain was willing to stray from anything
He had no recollection of riding the elevator back down or passing the lobby. He was fairly certain the nice concierge had asked him a question but he simply shook his head and maybe even mumbled a reply. He simply didn’t remember.
“It’s alright,” Luke said, awkwardly patting her shoulder as he looked back at Dean with wide eyes. “Ehm,” he added, turning back to Grace. “I didn’t read it, of course. Oh, and he also asked me to make sure you don’t forget about the gift certificate. So once school starts back up, I expect you to keep coming in to wait for your dad, you hear me?”
His left leg was numb by the time their embrace turned less clingy, Grace’s knee digging into it in an unfortunate angle.
Dean wiped away the sweat from his forehead with his right arm while already reading the words on his left. Pulling out a pen from his back pocket, Dean scribbled back.
Right away, Dean snapped out of it and averted his eyes, looking back down at his notes. He could feel the heat creeping up his neck and into his cheeks; Charlie’s chuckle certainly didn’t make it any better.
C was interviewing for so many different things, it was hard to keep it all straight. Dean would have to remember to ask what this one was for later. Not that C would be able to outright tell him – but they had found some ways to speak about it anyway. Dean knew that C worked with books and had applied for some office jobs that weren’t described in any more detail. So yeah, later on, he would ask and see what he could gather from the hints C was able to give him.
As Charlie’s laugh rang all around campus, Dean did his best to keep his head down. The last thing he wanted was to draw attention to the fact that Charlie was laughing because of something connected to the guy.
Gracie closed the door before turning to look at him. It seemed she was measuring him up, really taking in his appearance, so Dean did the same. Her eyes were still puffy and a bit pink but appeared to be dry. And contrary to yesterday, there was now determination mixed in with the sadness.
“That would be lovely, dear,” Alice replied, but before Dean could get up himself, Harry held out his hand to stop him.
“Shit, that is so hot,” he heard Cas moan out, and he wasn’t sure what exactly Cas meant but it didn’t matter anyway.
Dean was man enough to admit that he was preening under the praise. He would never not be proud of his girl - and he would never not love hearing the praise of others.
– at the same second as Lydia stepped right up to him, not even bothering with a greeting. “Dean, can we talk? I hate how things–”
With the cookies done and perfect for tomorrow’s cookie sale, the family got ready for an afternoon at the fair. During the drive, Gracie was chattering away about all the things they could see, her Grandpa who sat with her in the back this time, nodding with an indulgent smile as she prattled on.
? Really?” Dean asked in disbelief and with a mocking smile, trying to keep the whole thing funny and not let it show how Claire’s words caused the butterflies in his stomach to soar with hope.
,” Dean muttered right away as he dropped his last piece of pizza, eyes wide and internally cursing himself. “I forgot to call Grace.”
Waking later than usual Sunday morning, Dean knew right away that it would be a good day. At least, he hoped the feeling he woke up with rang true. Aside from that, there was this sort of giddiness he felt. That shred of hope? Yeah, that had grown overnight and for once, he made the conscious decision to try and release his negative thoughts and instead bathe in that warmth, in that
“Dad,” Gracie stage whispered, her eyes wide and in the direction of the crowd as well before she pulled on his hand. “Let’s go.”
He couldn’t stop himself, couldn’t hold back anymore. Those lips… he wanted to feel them so badly. The air around him felt like it had been electrified, and it felt inevitable that they would lean in. That their lips would meet. Like this moment was always meant to happen, right here, right now. Dean would kiss Cas and everything,
“But please keep in mind that he already got hurt once - and while I know you never wanted that to happen, it still did. So before you act on anything, just make sure you know what you want. Got that?”
Of course, Dean would stop the second Cas indicated he didn’t want the same but so far, there was no sign of that.
The women’s eyes landed on him and he had a hard time keeping himself from throwing his mugs in their direction. A moment later, they turned around, apparently for the first time becoming aware of who they were standing close to. “Oh dear.”
When Cas stumbled again, Dean once more reached for him but the only good it did him was for Cas to once again try to increase the space between them. Fucking hell!
“No, you didn’t,” Cas was quick to reassure and while it should’ve soothed Dean’s worry, it really didn’t. Because Cas still wouldn’t meet his eyes, looking sideways instead as he continued, “I... I just can’t do this.”
“The poor dear,” Alice said, her free hand on her heart, “It must be hard to come back to this town. And for such a reason.”
Holding the injured hand in one of his, Dean carefully pulled on the sleeve. The tight winter clothing hardly moved but it was enough for him to be able to see the wrist. Turning it just so, Dean could see the coloring that already spread. The wrist was obviously injured and for Cas’ sake he really hoped it was just a bruise - yet he feared that wasn’t the case.
Taking a moment to breathe he looked at Cas. He was sure he would be interrupted at any moment - but now, it was Cas who seemed utterly speechless.
Dean stepped closer to the reception and shook his head. “No, I’m afraid not. And… I’ll be honest, I don’t even know if he would want to see me.”
“I know, right?” Dean replied, huffing in disbelief as he shook his head over how stupid they’d been. “Jesus, Charlie is going to have a field day with this. She’s my bestie,” he quickly added when he saw the question in Cas’ eyes. “She’s told me for months now to take a risk and ask you out to see if maybe you’re my soulmate.”
The man was obviously startled by his sudden appearance, looking so adorable that Dean couldn’t help but ask, “So, anyone ever promised to lasso the moon for you?”
Considering it for a moment, Dean finally nodded. They both wore nothing more than a shirt and some boxer shorts, but those space heaters did an amazing job. “Yeah, I think we’ll be able to manage. But I’ll never say no to you cuddling closer to keep me warm,” he added with a suggestive smile, holding up the plate that was full of pancakes so Cas could lean in and settle against his side.
The way she sounded, the way she had phrased it, made Dean uneasy in his skin. But there was only one way to reply to this question. Anytime she asked.
Holy shit, had he stepped right into a first-class hotel? This lobby looked… well… exactly what Dean would believe a five-star plus hotel lobby to look like. Before he could marvel too long at all that was around him, a voice spoke up.
“For me?” Grace’s voice came from down the hall as she stepped closer. She’d been hiding in her room for a while now but the noise must’ve drawn her out… maybe in the hopes that Cas had come back after all.
He was pretty sure the last one wasn’t the case. Not after his little experiment on Saturday. But then again, maybe it was because he knew all the men there, more or less. Or maybe it was because he knew they were all taken? Dean wasn’t that kind of person to eyeball someone who was spoken for.
At a loss for words, he looked after Cas’ hastily retreading back, familiar black coat quickly blurring into the crowd. His heart was squeezing tightly and as so many times before in his life, every cell in his body screamed for him to rush after the man. To stop him from leaving, to make him talk to him.
This chapter focuses heavily on Dean's past relationship with Lisa and his feelings for her. From previous reactions I know that some of my readers are not happy about this - but Dean
As always, news traveled fast and Dean was aware of the gazes they got while eating their pizza at Antonioli's Restaurant. But they were easily ignored, Dean far too blissfully occupied with watching Gracie and Cas talk animatedly about Cas’ draft. She’d read it, of course, while Cas was gone – twice. All around she seemed to love it; the only downer, in her eyes, was the fact that the two main characters still weren’t a couple. Before Dean could intervene though, not wanting Grace to push Cas in a direction he wouldn’t be comfortable with, Cas addressed the topic.
“Where’s Jack?” Dean asked as he handed over the coffee, Benny smiling at him gratefully and pulling down the scarf to take a deep sip.
“I thought we were too young to know what love is,” Castiel whispered Dean’s words from years ago and Dean shook his head.
“No, it’s not okay,” Dean argued back, kissing him once more before pulling back to meet his eyes. “It’s not okay, but I want to make it up to you.”
“Christmas…” Dean trailed off, then broke out into a smile, throwing his arms around Sam’s shoulders and pulling him in closer. “It’s Christmas, Sammy!”
“I’ll wait with you,” Castiel interrupted, giving Dean a small smile. “As long as you’re comfortable, Jack? I can go with you if you don’t want to be alone.”
that it was the water that turned Uriel and Anna, but Dean’s gut told him there was no doubt. While Dean warred with the idea that someone like Dick fucking Roman would try to hurt billions of people for some sort of twisted monetary gain, Castiel seemed to feel guilty over the lives he was unable to save, his gaze lingering on the empty houses and makeshift memorials longer with each one they passed.
After they were dressed, they exchanged their dirty clothes for their name plaques and quickly made it through breakfast before heading off to their respective jobs. Dean joined up with Jesse and their small team to head outside. As they reached the doors, however, Jesse stopped them and said he had “other things to do today”, leaving them to cross the street to the grassy plot by the boardwalk where the camp’s vehicles were parked.
“Chase is on the case!” Jack answered, then started making police siren sounds as he ‘drove’ himself over to the cabinet, much like his favorite cartoon character. Castiel was already resigned to the fact, through his own son and the grades he taught, that he would never be free of Paw Patrol.
“I was so afraid…” Castiel started again, his voice just above a whisper, his breath hot on the back of Dean’s neck, “that I wasn’t going to get you in time.”
The passenger door opening, the car flooding with sudden yellow light, made him jump, and he turned to see Gabriel sliding in beside him. His older brother closed the door and immediately reached for the handle to recline the seat, falling back with a few clicks. Wherever he was, Gabriel never hesitated to make himself comfortable. Castiel envied him that ability. They stayed, silent, until the overhead light shut back off, the chill of the winter air starting to cut through the heat that had collected from the drive.
The room was suddenly lit up, and Dean slapped his hands up to cover his eyes at the sudden bright white light.
Dean shrugged and slid his bag from his shoulders, opening the bottom pouch. With Castiel’s help, they packed the contents of the drawer. “My Uncle Bobby has his ways… he probably just broke into a pharmacy after everything started.”
An older woman came by almost every day, asking Gabriel questions when she couldn’t get the answers from Lucas, and Gabe told him that she was going to help them find family to stay with.
The makeshift fire pit was overturned, flames licking their way towards the cafe bar by way of the trio’s sleeping gear, the stools, and all of their clothing from the day before. Smoke was thick and black, clinging to the air, and it made Dean’s eyes water. On the ground, Uriel was crouched over Alfie’s body, though his spine was twisted in an unnatural way. Dean didn’t need to see his face to know why.
That left the doors wide open for who Castiel’s partner was, and somehow, all Dean could picture was Casitel’s old, slimy friend from high school, Bartholomew. Dean hated Bart back then, the only openly gay boy in their grade until Castiel proudly proclaimed himself as pansexual. Bart had cornered Dean more than once in the back of classrooms, sneering into his face that
“You were vetted from the moment you came downtown,” Charlie said with a shrug. “Chuck has outposts on the river as well as the lake, safehouses along the way to both observe anyone entering the city and to take out any threats before they can get to us.”
Eileen shrugged and lifted her hands up in a ‘what can I say’ motion, then began signing once more. “He does, though. Your brother takes the world on his shoulders. It’s a heavy burden.”
“You’re too good to us, Dean,” Naomi said with a soft sigh, smiling as Dean nodded his head towards her.
Jo looked between them, then pulled over a chair and sat on the other side of Claire’s bed. “Do you drink a lot, Claire?”
Castiel didn’t move. Vicki, however, thought he should be closer and moved behind to push the chair forward. Castiel tried not to feel terrified, but his hands were shaking and he felt like he was going to throw up.
Castiel nodded, grateful, and left to let Dean wash the blood and dirt from their clothes, unaware of Dean’s racing thoughts. As Dean wrung out the last pair of jeans, he looked up into the mirror again, swallowing hard at his reflection.
"It's my skin now," Lucas answered, looking to the ceiling so both of his brothers could see where the angry, red skin moved down his throat, over the top of his chest, and disappearing over his left shoulder underneath the hospital gown. "My regular skin got burned off. Some of this skin is new, some of it is healed on it's own."
Eileen smiled softly and returned to Sam’s side, slipping up onto the table. Sam turned, laying his head on her lap and closing his eyes as she ran her fingers through his hair.
The red-headed woman rubbed a hand between her shoulder blades, reaching forward to drop down their name tags. Hers fell over and Dean saw ‘Charlie’ printed in neat, block letters. As soon as everyone was seated, Charlie greeted them by raising her hand and giving the Vulcan Salute with a cheery, “Hey, bitches!”
“It’s called a pilot, Castiel.” Lucas rolled his eyes and shifted further away in his seat to look out the window. Castiel hoped he was doing what Dad said and was going to go to sleep.
Gabriel snapped his gum again. “Not what I meant,” he said and Dean glanced over at him. “I care about you both, just don’t want a repeat. Of any of it.”
“I came home this afternoon to find Claire passed out on the bathroom floor with an empty bottle of tequila. When I moved her, she was very confused, throwing up, couldn’t tell me her name…” Castiel sighed and shook his head. “I just… I have seen her intoxicated many times over the last two years, and she’s never been this bad. I was worried about how much she drank.”
. In a way, it was everything Castiel had ever imagined when he thought of his future with Dean. And he could see it, even now, being their life.
Anna nodded and reached for Castiel, hugging him tightly before drawing back. Castiel blew out a slow, deep breath and got to work.
“Yeah, well, Mikey’s a dick. But he’s not exactly wrong… Just, hear me out,” Gabriel pushed on as Castiel made a noise of protest. “I wouldn’t bring it up. Right now you’re single so you don’t have a beau to gush about. And you know what? As far as Mom is concerned? She has a lot to make up for before she gets to be privy to your happiness. I’m not saying don’t be who you are, Cassie. I’m saying that you don’t owe them anything.”
As he came around the corner, he nearly slammed into a child who was struggling to carry a container of chocolate muffins, a bag of cookies, and a bag of sub rolls. He looked up with wide eyes, almost dropping the rolls until Dean moved quickly to adjust his arm load.
The weather outside was perfect, just warm enough to be comfortable, and he found himself walking slowly along the pathways and enjoying the gardens that flourished around the castle. Delicate flowers were teaming with bumblebees and butterflies, such a stark difference from the hearty bushes and trees that grew in the mountains. He bent down to pick a single orange blossom when he jumped back in alarm.
“I just... you’re nervous, and it’s funny, because I was terrified to meet you,” she confessed, giving another laugh. “You know, I was jealous of you for so long.”
Claire smiled against his neck, then pulled back. “Think it would be weird for my wedding party to be my brothers? Maybe we could plan for next summer, before Ben goes to college?”
The creatures, although seemingly more aggressive towards the human species, were hungry for flesh of any kind. They’d come upon a farm, cows screaming in panic as a horde of Lifeless broke through the enclosure and descended upon their prey. Dean sat idling for a moment, a new sense of dread washing over him.
Dean stifferned and then, with a quick nod to Jack, took off to the left, down the aisle. It would fucking figure it was the alcohol. With his head down, Dean barreled forward, ignoring the pang in his chest and the way his skin felt hot and the deep voice now speaking to the kids behind him.
The classrooms themselves went in order, starting with the kindergarten rooms closest to the cafeteria leading all the way to the fifth grade rooms which were at the far end of the school. As they came back around towards the main office, Dean paused outside of his office.
Castiel huffed a small laugh, reaching forward to take Dean’s hand in his own. “Call me crazy, but I’m pretty sure I’m falling in love with you.”
She smiled and pushed around him, coming to stand on the other side of the front desk with her arm extended. “I’m Anna, and that grump over there is Uriel. He found me and my brother, Alfie, when all of this went down, and we’ve been traveling together ever since.”
The first trailer was completely empty, a chaotic mess of upturned furniture, weather destroyed books, and trash everywhere. Someone had already gone through the closets, the bedding, and the cupboards. They moved on to the next one with less hope than before.
“No,” Dean whispered, shaking his head. He took half a step closer, Castiel letting out a surprised huff of air that Dean could feel against his lips. His eyes were wide but Dean recognized the hope in them; the same hope he’d been ignoring for
“Alright,” Sam said after introducing his friend Brady, “we don’t clear the roads down here because it helps us keep track of who’s coming and going. We don’t get people up here often, but ‘DJ Trick’ has a broadcast that does bring a few people in. It’s why we keep a patrol down here during the day.”
"I never imagined I would get this," Dean whispered after a moment, his hands running over Castiel's shoulders and back. "Never thought I would be lucky enough, not like my parents were, not like Sam."
Dean had to laugh at that. Most of the conversation he and Ben had had lately, had been about Jack. “Speaking of,” Dean started, reaching up to scratch the back of his neck, “Ben was wondering if Jack would like to come over tonight for a sleepover.”
“Castiel, we have enough time to get a washcloth, you silly goose! Lucas isn’t going anywhere, I promise.”
“Walking away is brave, and it’s hard, and it’s really important, guys. You can’t get in the habit of fighting back with your fists, okay? The best thing to do with bullies is ignore them, because they get their power from thinking they hurt you.”
Dean gasped, his eyes flying open before squinting at the bright light, his brother’s face full of concern only inches from his.
Anna rolled her eyes before looking over her shoulder at her brother. “That’s how you make friends, Alfie!” She turned back to Castiel and Dean and smiled, her hand still outstretched and waiting.
Ahead of him was the dock and Claire was sitting on the edge, kicking her feet every once in a while and laughing at Jack attempting to catch the frogs. They were either too slippery or too big and kept launching themselves out of his grasp.
“Lucas!” Gabriel whispered and Castiel felt his hip slam into the chair as he moved past, climbing up onto the bed, hesitating until the boy nodded his head and they collapsed together.
Sam sighed and reached over Dean’s shoulder, taking the bottle and glass from him, depositing both in the sink. “Well, I was going to ask if you needed me to tell him to pick anything up, but, I think you should switch to some water or something.”
He’d asked for this. He’d ripped them from their warm, safe cocoon and broken Castiel’s heart. The fear that had driven him to do so was still there, white hot in his gut - his dad
Castiel didn’t know what he wanted. He was just exhausted with hating Dean, with pushing him away. The other man was obviously going to be a staple in his life - between them working together, their mutual friends, having kids around the same age…
Claire nodded and turned away from him, making her way across the front lawn. He sighed as he watched her go and sent up a silent prayer that this would be good for her, good for all of them. He hated that she was hurting, knowing he was at least part of the reason, now that he’d taken her away from the home she knew, her friends. But she was bright, and smart, and beautiful, and fun… she
“Don’t be. Charlie, none of this is your fault, and Gilda loves you. She’s so excited and happy to start this journey with you. I mean,” Dean gave a small huff of laughter and shook his head, “none of us want this shit show that’s going on in the world. None of us would’ve chosen this. But it's happening, and Gilda has one of the best people in the world at her side. You have protected her for months, Charlie. And you’ll continue to do so, because she’s your family.
"I'm glad you approached me," Castiel said as his eyes fluttered shut, the Alpha's mouth moving from his lips to his throat. "I-- Oh, Dean," he sighed, legs tightening around Dean's waist once more, "I can't think when you're doing that."
“Welcome to our camp!” Garth said happily as they joined them, his hand held out to shake. “Like I said, I’m Garth, this is Kevin, and this is Jesse!”
Dean’s flaming red cheeks. Instead of waiting, he ripped his wallet free and slammed two twenties down on the counter, grabbing Jack and nearly pulling him from the restaurant. It was now their waiter’s lucky day.
“Mr. Adler, here are the children,” she spoke quickly, and despite looking right at Castiel, she was talking to someone behind her. Castiel craned his neck, leaning against Lucas’ side to see around her.
“Fuck, Cas,” Dean whispered into his mouth and Castiel smiled back. Dean never failed to come apart with his touch and that trust drove Castiel wild. He let his fingertips trace the contours of Dean’s chest, dragging his shirt out of the way until the couch and their position got in his way.
“We talked all morning,” Castiel replied, looking confused. “We planned our route and said goodbye to Jody…”
“Unlike with the Braden’s, is much harder to erase a celestial being,” Castiel trailed off, his eyes scanning over to the bowl on the bed.
Castiel glared at her and pointedly took a bite of his omelette, forcing himself to stay seated and not turn around and demand answers from the man who had ruined his life. Because, what the fuck? He had a million things he wanted to ask Dean, a million things he wanted to say to him. He
“You’re so infuriating! You just want to blame me for everything because you can’t take responsibility for your own actions-”
Balthazar stared, the apple he was raising to his mouth for another bite now forgotten in his hand. Beside him, Anna's eyes were wide, mirth apparent on the upturn of her lips. Castiel simply cleared his throat, crossing his arms as he leaned back in the oversized chair at the table.
The man was dark-skinned and buff, the oversized sweatshirt he was wearing only serving to make him look more imposing. Behind him, a thin, short woman with long red hair was peeking around his shoulder, surveying the two with interest. The third person was a skinny teenager with a baseball cap pulled too far down on his head. His eyes were wide as he looked between his own group of survivors and the newcomers.
“Guess what else I found upstairs?” Jody said with a wink, pulling a bottle of whiskey out from behind her back and putting it down on the table.
He was also curious to know what happened to Dean afterwards. Gabriel had told him a few years back when John Winchester had passed from a heart attack, and he wondered if John ever knew about them, about Dean. He was way more open about his sexuality when Claire asked, which was surprising, and he wanted to know when Dean stopped being ashamed of it.
“I’m yours,” Dean whispered and Castiel smirked, pushing up to his feet and twisting them around before Dean could even take a breath. Then he was falling onto the bed, his legs falling open wide. Castiel made quick work of the rest of their clothes, then climbed onto the bed on his side. Dean turned to face him and they came together once more.
Castiel picked up some wine, a red and a white since he wasn’t sure what Dean’s preference would be, and debated on what to get for dinner. He settled on pasta with homemade alfredo sauce and ignored the little bubble of excitement he got at thinking of cooking with Dean at his side in the kitchen.
” Chuck whispered, his hands gliding down the wooden closet doors at the back of his room as if he were caressing a lover. “
At the end of the aisle, despite his entire body screaming at him to keep moving, Dean turned around to look.
“You too,” Castiel agreed, reaching for Claire’s shoulders and pulling her in. “This is Claire, and Jack is still sleeping in the car. Claire, this is Gabriel’s fiance, Kali.”
“Ben! Let’s go!” Dean called up the stairs, knocking his knuckles against the wall for emphasis. His son definitely got his time management skills from his mother…
“Alright then,” Casitel said with a genuine smile as he swung the pack back over his shoulder and stood, brushing bits of dirt and gravel from the knees of his pants. “Are you ready?”
Chuck gave a small laugh, accepting his own glass from Garth with a simple ‘thank you’. “Well, if you’re worried about the alcohol content, Garth didn’t pour any of us enough to be off our game. But I promise you, this building is very safe. We are safeguarded against any attack from the new-level beings that walk among us.”
Most of the balcony was closed off but as they walked further there was a door leading to one of the boxes. ‘Chuck’ was written across the door in fancy gold letters, and Dean bit his tongue to keep from snarking out a comment. Garth knocked three times then pushed the door open.
Castiel watched as Dean turned and headed back towards the door and he realized, when Dean reached the handle, that he didn’t want Dean to leave. The twist of conflicting emotions made his head hurt and he hated how every single moment since he’d come back to Kansas was tainted by Dean Winchester. He thought he was past this, thought his heart had learned to ignore, and yet… every beat in his chest had that painful ache.
The last time he was in the hospital was when he had come to identify Kelly. Then, he sat at her bedside while they fought hard to keep her alive. Her body was too broken, the bleeding in her brain too much to reverse, and she ultimately slipped away from him without ever knowing he’d come to be beside her.
“Told the kid to go and get warm. Couldn’t concentrate over his chattering teeth.” Benny chuckled and gave Dean a half-hearted shrug. “Just about to drop anchor out here any way. Told him to warm up and then meet us all in the galley.”
As luck would have it, they were. However, the barn was chock full of farm gear, leaving very little space for them to squeeze in. As Dean secured the doors behind them, they stood in silence as they waited for their eyes to adjust. There was a thin stream of moonlight coming in from a crack in the roof.
Castiel smiled back at him and tugged him forward, kissing him. “I can’t wait to meet your brother, Dean.”
He straightened his tunic, unnecessarily once more, and then reached for the door. He shook his head and bit back a laugh when it opened to reveal Anna, bouncing on the heels of her slippers, her hands clasped tightly in front of her.
“Sam is my family, too. He’s the only family that I have. And yes, I intend on spending my Christmas with him and Eileen, and I intend on enjoying myself for a single moment in which I am treated, in return, as family.”
“Jack,” Castiel said, reaching over and squeezing his shoulder, “Dean isn’t mad. He is worried. I am too. We are taking a huge leap of faith right now. And to be fair, most of the leaps we’ve made have worked out for the best. But right now everything is a risk. Me taking in Dean back in August was a risk. Us helping Jody Mills in Sioux Falls. Us trusting you and your mom. Hell, even
Dean sighed and followed after her, stopping just inside the door when a warm hand touched his arm. He found himself smiling and he turned to the side, greeting Castiel with a soft kiss. “Hey, baby,” he whispered and Castiel kissed him again before pulling back.
“Trying to break my eardrums?” she mumbled, jerking her body around to face the window, apparently not looking for a response.
Dean pulled one of the blankets free, handing it over to Charlie, and found himself burying his nose into the sleeping bag. It smelled of Castiel and Dean found himself smiling again, his eyes closing, and soon fell asleep.
“I don’t know if the second one will be an option for much longer… or at least, I hope it won’t be.”
stopping himself from running away. He hadn’t even grabbed anything for Ben. When he was back to the safety of the table, he released a breath. “Uh, kids, why don’t you go grab a drink?” he said and watched as all of them got back up from their seats and went over to Castiel. When he turned his head, he found Gabriel watching him.
people, but there were too many of them for his liking. If something went wrong, he would be outnumbered. And even if they were normal, there was a chance he’d get jumped for his supplies or they would try to coerce him into helping out, and he didn’t have time to deal with that right now.
Dean watched himself at the table clenching his jaw, his fingers tightening their grip around his glass. He turned, taking a step out into the hallway and nearly running right into Cas. The angel had a goddamn smile on his face…
Castiel laughed but bent down, kissing him once more before disappearing below deck to find the sewing kit. When he came back, they worked together to complete the makeshift crib and Dean was damn proud of the finished product. While it wouldn’t have passed any safety standards, it was sturdy, soft, and would do what it was intended to.
Patrick is, but… I hope it works out with them. He seems like a good dude, and Ben likes him. That’s what matters, right?”
The roads were snow covered and slick, the air icy as they whipped through the path Sam’s group had formed between the trees. Sam tried to yell over the sound of the wind and the engine, but Dean shook his head, tapping his brother’s thigh to let him know it was okay. They had all the time in the world now.
By the time Gabriel came back, stretching out over the opposite couch and leaning bodily against Anna’s side, Castiel realized he was still smiling and he’d relaxed. Maybe this week wouldn’t be so bad afterall…
the point, but he smiled, knowing that Sam was doing right by everyone that walked through the door. He listened as Sam explained the day to day business aspect and what his role was, and then led Castiel and Dean into a back room.
Meg had met Claire first after she took a position as the guidance counselor, and she’d tagged Claire as a challenge from day one. When Claire had wandered into his classroom, with her too-thick eyeliner and a ‘don’t fuck with me’ attitude, Castiel knew what Meg meant. Claire was
"Your Highness!" Jessica interrupted, immediately dipping her head. "I'm so sorry, I would've cleaned up a little bit if I knew." She straightened and promptly smacked Sam in the middle of his chest. "This one's clothes are
Lisa gave him a sad smile, shaking her head. “Because it didn’t matter how much I tried… I could never compare. He never loved me, not really. But he never stopped loving you.”
“You look exhausted,” Dean whispered, reaching up to push Castiel’s hair back from his forehead. “Come on, I’ll get you something to eat and then you should sleep.”
Dean spun around, sloshing what was left of his coffee over his hand, to see Charlie scrambling up out of the hatch. Her hair was still braided for sleep, her eyes wide and terrified.
“They do seem very open to accepting people into the fold,” Castiel agreed and Charlie threw him a small smile. “It was a little… alarming, actually, how easily Garth, Kevin, and Jesse invited us to join the group.”
"I remember that... I could barely stand working through my first trimester with Jo." She looked up and smiled at Castiel over Dean's shoulder. "Dean, are you going to introduce me to your friend?"
“Alright Ben, I’m going to the bathroom real quick. Stay at the table and make sure you ask the waiter for ketchup. Got it, dude?” He smiled and held out his closed fist, Ben immediately knocking their knuckles together.
Castiel forced himself to clear his throat, chalking up the burning in his eyes as nearing the seventh hour on the road. He glanced down at the time on the dash and then back up to the road, happy to focus on finding them something to eat. His GPS’ arrival time was still hovering between 4:20 and 4:30 the following morning, giving them plenty of leeway to actually sit down for a meal. They might even be able to stop for a little nap.
“Like hell you are. I want to see him! I have a few questions for him, anyway.” Dean opened his mouth but Jo was quick to cut him off. “He was my friend, too, Dean! He didn’t just leave you!”
Sighing, Castiel shifted again, leaning over the back of the booth slightly to say, “I’m… sorry. That was inappropriate of me to say.”
“Please, call me Castiel,” Castiel corrected, giving Phoenix another pat before walking over to the two men. He looked Sam over, realizing he was also an Alpha, and picked up on a familiar scent. “Is this your brother?” he asked, turning his head to Dean.
Dean nodded, swallowing thickly and reaching up to wipe his eyes. “They found her in the hallway outside of my room.”
Dean clenched his jaw tight as he rolled his eyes up to the ceiling. He should just stay quiet, let Cas enjoy his newfound love for the classic Christmas songs Sam has been playing relentlessly, and yet -
“Did something happen?” Jo asked, pulling some tubes from her pocket and laying them on the mattress. “I’m going to just start an IV and get some labs here, okay?”
Dean jumped, shoving his good leg against the tile to push himself backwards. His back hit the wall, giving himself full view of the kitchen, his backside protected. At the far end of the table, Benny sat, his head leaning against his fist, a bored expression on his face.
Chuck smiled at Dean’s snark and gave a small laugh, looking up at Jesse and Garth. “He’s such a character, isn’t he? Written in for comic relief.” When he turned his gaze back to Dean, Dean forced himself to hold his head up and maintain eye contact.
Dean’s heart stopped right there in the middle of his chest. The boy, Jack, hugged the container of muffins to his chest, Claire having taken the rest of the goods, and then smiled up at Dean again. And Dean couldn’t move. There was no way - it was just a nickname! Cas was common, right?
“Okay, boys,” Vicki gained their attention, crouching down in front of the wheelchair and helping Gabriel stop it from rolling into her, “this is Lucas’ room. We’re going to have to be kind of quiet down here, okay? The people on the unit are very, very sick and need their rest. Lucas wants to see you guys, but if his nurses says we gotta go, then we have to listen.”
Claire nodded and looked away, a smile still playing on her lips. Castiel waited, knowing she would tell him whatever it was that was on her mind. The most important lesson he’d ever learned from Claire was that of patience. He didn’t have to wait long before she blurted out, “I’m going to ask Kaia to marry me.”
But he forced the thought away and straightened up, screwing the cap on tight. They’d taken to being especially careful since the vineyard. Castiel boiled all of their drinking and cooking water twice before allowing them to use it. It made packing up and traveling take longer as they waited for the water to cool enough to refill the canteens, but the peace of mind was worth it.
“Yes,” Castiel said softly, nodding his head, then turned to meet Dean’s gaze. “Thank you... for showing me around.”
Tyler Lewis’ nose had stopped bleeding, and with a fresh ice pack and a few mom-approved Tylenol, Dean sent him on his way to class. Ben moved to get up and leave with him and Dean immediately pointed back to the seat, watching as his son collapsed into it with a sigh.
He felt the moment his words registered, Castiel’s entire body stiffening against him before he relaxed again into Dean’s back.
Dean glanced around at the three tables, all full of people with only a few empty chairs dotted around. Everyone was laughing and talking. The aroma of good food was overwhelming. He felt slightly guilty about the first impression he’d made with Garth, Jesse, and Kevin. Then his eyes landed on Chuck at the farthest table.
“Love you so much,” Dean panted, reaching back to grab Castiel’s head, moving his hips back in time with Castiel’s. He groaned as Castiel hit his prostate, his entire body stiffening around Cas’ cock.
“You know, you’re going to hit a rock and faceplant,” he called out as she stumbled once, spinning around to flip him off. Her cheeks were as red as her hair and she beamed back at him.
Dean reached back and took Cas’ hand in his own. He was about to repeat Sam’s words when a sudden scream came from the group ahead of them, a short man bursting forth clad in head-to-toe plaid pajamas. Dean looked at his brother in alarm, but Sam looked just as confused.
“What’s going on with you?” Dean asked, moving to stand in front of Castiel as he moved to continue walking. “Come on, talk to me. You’ve hardly said two words to me all day.”
Castiel was chewing quickly, trying to swallow as he shook his head to tell Dean he didn’t have to answer that.
“Oh, you look so good!” Meg was saying into Claire’s hair, the two of them squeezing each other tight and rocking back and forth. Claire’s response was muffled in Meg’s shoulder, but Dean found himself smiling at how at ease the teenager was.
Was this a one time thing? Was it just a release of pent up energy? Was it closure? Sure, he’d all but confessed that he was still in love with Castiel and Castiel had implied that he, too, felt the same but… what if that was it? What if Castiel was content to go back to the friendship they’d formed? What if-
, we have villages full of people who are seeking out their futures in the plentiful lands around them.
“No, I never forgot you, Cas.” Dean cleared his throat, his cheeks turning slightly pink and he took a large gulp from his water glass. “I don’t know how I put it off for so long but… took me a few years to fuck up.” Dean gave another laugh, then shook his head. “Though, best fuck up I ever made.”
Castiel made a small noise, pressing his nose into the back of Dean’s neck. He didn’t speak, but Dean knew.
“Shit, brother,” Benny whispered and Dean looked up to see the Cajun looking at the Lifeless. Then Benny grunted as Jesse moved, slamming himself into Benny’s legs and taking them both down.
Castiel swallowed hard, repressing the chill that threatened to shake him. All of the anxieties he'd felt before the wedding came rushing back, making him nauseous. Every single thing he'd imagined for his future, every plan and fantasy he'd had for what the next couple of months would bring, suddenly came crashing down.
“No, I agree,” Benny said with a sigh. “I’m worried about just cutting straight across, too. There’s a lot of backroads which could be dangerous if there’s a lot of snow. Nothing is going to be plowed or sanded or any of that. If we take the routes and interstates, there’s going to be a smoother ride.”
; this was simply something Dean had to do, not a matter of life and death – but he certainly wouldn’t argue. There was no time for that.
. Dreaded seeing Cas again so soon, with no idea how the man would react to him. As he stepped inside the café, his gaze found Cas right away - how could it not? Cas was magnetic and Dean was drawn to him, always. He had to push down a swarm of butterflies that ambushed him. The ones that gave him a warm and happy buzzing. Especially when those blue eyes looked up and locked on him.
Cas shook his head, no words coming from him. He wouldn’t even look at Dean, his whole demeanor reminding Dean terribly of their interactions those first few days since he had come back to Stars Hollow. But there was also still a fragility to him.
am fine - or at least, I will be. And I’ve already talked to Sam and Eileen about it so no need to burden you with it while you’re not here.” He watched them give each other a meaningful gaze and Dean sighed again. “They told you, didn’t they?”
Dean shook his head while he helped Gracie get her things ready. He tried not to think about it anymore. It still gave him nightmares, no need to think about it in his waking hours. Gracie was fine now, healthy and kicking. While she still had some issues now and then, like with standing too long or too much exercise, she was fine most of the time.
“Right?” Cas replied, his blue eyes shining. With every passing second, Dean had a feeling as if those eyes drew him in, further and further, Cas voice just as enticing. “It has such deep meaning behind it. All these mistakes he thinks he made in life, but really –”
Dean had no idea how he knew, but the few cells in his brain not currently vacationing in fantasyland - those few remaining cells told him it was most likely popcorn.
It was also highly unlikely that he would leave his potential partner just because of a love confession – at least, part of Dean hoped Cas was more truthful and loyal to a partner than that. Dean really didn’t want to be a homewrecker, he really didn’t want to steal someone away from a loving relationship.
A rapid knock against his front door ripped him out of his head and he was stalking over before his brain had fully caught up. What if it was Cas? Maybe it was Michael, ready to finally beat him up… the sad thing was, Dean would even let him…
As they were so often, Gracie and Cas were deep in conversation, not paying any mind to the surrounding world. By now, he did not try to dismiss the quickening of his heartbeat or the way it would jump when he watched the two of them together.
“Hey, I was the one to start it,” Dean jumped to his defense without hesitation, shutting Gabe up. “It’s one of the greatest movies in existence, let us nerd about it.”
Yeah, Dean really wanted an answer to that as well - though he really did not want it to be what Gabriel suggested next.
Dean’s heart felt heavy, as if a vice was squeezing it tight, making it hard for him to even breathe as he watched words appear on his arm.
As he got closer to Eileen, she caught his gaze, then pointedly looked over his shoulder, then back at him… and then she smiled, Dean only understanding why when he realized he was ginning. Probably like a madman. But here he was. Feeling a blush creeping up and into his cheeks, he turned his head down and rubbed his neck. Her soft touch to his shoulder had him look back up.
It was only then he realized that this name would ring a bell for Lisa’s parents. And not a good one.
“Merry Christmas, Dean,” Emma exclaimed in delight as she flung herself into his arms. “Is Gracie here?”
But IF option one was really the case - and that was a pretty big if - his daughter might just have made her point. Lydia’s eyes wandered over to Cas and Dean couldn’t help but think that she was throwing him a calculating gaze, her eyes wandering up and down. Dean might have gotten jealous - if it wasn’t for the coldness he saw in Lydia’s eyes, even though she did her damn best to hide it.
The squeaking of tires and a roaring engine was what drew his attention and like most people at the fair, he turned to look in the direction – catching the last glimpse of a midnight blue Camaro that was speeding away.
Dean could feel the blood draining from his face. His fingers went numb for a second and he had to grip the steering wheel harder so he wouldn’t lose control.
“We couldn’t have asked for a better man for our daughter. Or for a better father for our grandchild. I told you, Dean Winchester, you have the biggest heart. And loving someone and
When he lay down and let the silence engulf him, it took all of two minutes for the first memories of Cas to come back to the surface. Groaning, Dean settled in for a long, sleepless night.
Very soon, Dean became aware that Cas was trying not to put too much weight on him. Allowing none of that, he pulled Cas close until he sensed him giving in. He could take the extra weight - much better, in fact, than he was able to take the closeness. As they made their way up the slippery slope, slowly and step by step, Dean knew his heart was not only racing because of the exercise.
His eyes were fixed on Cas, trailing over every minute detail; the little crinkle in the corners of his eyes when he laughed; the way his smile would twitch in the corner of his mouth before it bloomed over his face.
It was five-thirty in the morning and for a while, Dean considered starting on an early ride. This must have been around the time Cas was now going for his run. As his alarm ticked on, getting closer to six, Dean decided against it.
All too soon though, he noticed that Cas seemed to slow the kiss and in the end even drew back. Frowning again, Dean opened his eyes and caught Cas gnawing on his lower lip; knowing instantly that in the light of the new day, some things needed to be discussed first. Some concerns and worries weren’t so easily pushed aside simply because of their mutual passion.
But he couldn’t. Because Cas was over him. Cas had grown up and had moved on and his feelings for Dean with him. It didn’t matter anymore.
And then Cas was standing right in front of him. Instantly, the mock seriousness was gone, Dean’s smile back in full force. Cas’ face was red from the cold, his striking blue eyes all the more intense because of it.
As they took the first few steps, Dean was relieved that besides his messed up arm, Cas seemed fine. He was able to move almost normally and aside from a grunt here and there, didn’t show any sign of his pain.
His morning rides had undeniably lost a not so small aspect of enjoyment - but Dean made sure to nip any unpleasant feelings about that right in the bud. He had enjoyed them long before his short encounters with Cas and he would
“I still can’t believe my aunt ordered the company’s helicopter,” Cas chuckled, biting into the squishy pastry Dean was holding up for him while Cas expertly navigated his Camaro through the Friday afternoon traffic.
Looking over at his girl with a soft smile, only half following Rebecca’s reasoning for one name or another, he noticed Cas moving over to where Gracie sat on the floor. With no desire to hover, to pry in on their moment, Dean tried to engage more with the ladies around him. That didn’t mean he didn’t see Cas hugging Gracie tight after reading her card and he was sure Cas had at least teared up a little bit. He whispered something into her hair and then pressed a kiss there.
For now, though, he leaned in closer again, hesitantly, not wanting to push his luck, not quite catching Cas’ lips.
“Cas?” he asked into the room, lifting his head to check around. He even turned to the other side, his sleepy mind thinking that maybe they had switched sides somehow.
Yeah, no. Dean didn’t even want to think about that. So being able to join the snowman contest together, just like they had done for seven years now, was certainly amazing.
They sat on the couch, watching a movie when Dean secretly pulled out a pen and wrote a simple message on his arm.
This time Zar nodded, gloomy darkness oozing out of him. “Of course, I will. Have a good life, Dean Winchester.”
Okay then. Dean had known he made a fucking huge mistake – but Cas was still a damn adult! And adults should know better than to
However, there was no way to save this situation now so all he could do was to go on with the lesson. Thankfully, his students seemed to realize that they had tortured him enough for one day and finally followed suit, even if it wasn’t as silently as he would have hoped for.
Hardly able to believe his luck, Dean pulled a little bit on Cas’ hand, drawing them closer together. “I was so conflicted,” he admitted in a hushed whisper. “I wanted to stay faithful to the promise we made each other – but you were drawing me in, so damn much. Those big blue eyes, and that smile of yours. Not to mention your voice.”
A kiss was pressed to his lips but, if that was supposed to convince Dean to let him go, Cas was severely mistaken. Instead, Dean pulled on his wrist, trying to wordlessly get the man back on the bed and more importantly, back into his arms.
“Okay.” After grabbing her book, she got up, turned to Cas, and offered her hand. “Bye, Castiel. It was nice meeting you.”
Gracie seemed to think about that for a moment, then shook her head. “No. No, I wouldn’t. But wouldn’t you then ask what secret it is? I mean, if you didn’t already know.”
to think! All I know is that I have a heartbroken daughter inside–” he pointed to the house to emphasize his point, “who somehow wonders if
Seemed like someone liked it a bit rougher and a strong hold on his ass. Good to know. Dean definitely filtered that information away for later.
At that, the gentleman – Joshua, as Dean could now read on his name tag – raised one eye-brow that had Dean chuckling nervously. The only thing that kept him grounded was the kindness that never left Joshua’s eyes.
He also still hadn’t found a way to stop his heart from hurting whenever he passed the crossroads that would lead him back home without a single sign of the man.
Today is Dean Winchester's birthday so: Happy Birthday 🎉 I guess you could say there's a little gift or two for him in this chapter 🎁
They had pancakes for breakfast, simply because Dean needed some comfort food and because he was sure Grace wouldn’t mind either. He was expecting more questions about … well, anything related to yesterday’s events, really. But Grace was happy babbling about easy subjects, like Christmas and the presents she was preparing for everyone. Or begging Dean to give a hint about her own presents. Thankful for the distraction, he let her have her fun and allowed yes and no questions regarding her gifts.
That certainly got his students’ attention, all eyes on Scott right away. Suddenly the center of everybody’s attention, the boy sat up and hesitated for only a moment. When Dean encouraged him with a nod, he turned towards the class and with a wide grin, he said: “One night a Viking named Rudolph the Red was looking out the window when he said, ‘It’s going to rain.’ His wife asked, ‘How do you know?’ And he said, ‘Because Rudolph the Red knows rain, dear.’”
Thoroughly chastised and unable to stop grinning about it, Dean called his thanks after Luke, who was already on his way back behind the counter.
He didn’t stay long in his class, just long enough to retrieve his bag with a change of clothing. Being one of the substitute teachers for gym class sometimes led to a spontaneous need for gym clothes. And didn’t that come in handy right now?
Not thinking about any of that, Dean finally let his eyes wander away from Cas’ lips, really looking at the men all around their table. Of course there was Chuck, which – yeah no, he certainly didn’t have a daddy kink, thank you very much. Anna’s husband Crowley was just a few short years older than Dean, but imagining anything with him … Dean quickly took a sip of his eggnog, moving on before he would throw up. Rebecca’s husband Bart had joined the family this weekend, just like Inias’ fiancé Gadreel. They both certainly were handsome guys – in a completely platonic, matter-of-fact kind of way. Meaning Dean could see why Cas’ siblings were drawn to their significant others, but he certainly didn’t feel anything while looking at them.
“The thing is,” he went on, still trying to find the right words. “When you came back into my life and I started to realize that what I felt for you was really love... it scared me. What you accused me of – that I was playing with you – that was really just me trying to make sense of it all.”
“Yeah. But I guess it’s okay,” he replied, hoping they would buy that he was just saddened he couldn’t join in with his daughter. Which he was, of course … it just wasn’t the whole truth. And since they would find out anyway, and he really didn’t want them to come up with some absurd reason why he’d withheld this information, he quickly added: “Cas is jumping in, so no harm done on Gracie’s part.”
His friends could be a pain in the ass sometimes – but they also had big hearts and they knew when better not to push him too far. They didn’t mention Cas or Lisa or Dean’s feelings for the rest of their call, rather, they told Dean about how surprisingly friendly people in Germany were.
“So... you ever thought about leaving Stars Hollow for good? Like George wanted to get out of Bedford Falls all his life?”
Dean breathed out a laugh that quickly turned into a fit of crazy-sounding laughter and he had to concentrate to be able to reply.
“Oh?” Lydia asked in surprise as she stepped next to them, “You left her on Christmas Morning? How come?”
Since Sam’s text didn’t make sense on its own, Dean closed the chat and opened the one with Eileen, hoping for an explanation. The first message was from last night.
Letting his fingers brush slowly over Cas’ name, Dean read the quote he had picked to go with his picture for maybe the hundreds time.
And then all thought of that was simply gone from his mind as he saw how Cas’ eyes closed in pleasure and his head dropped back, exposing his neck and his flushed chest, and dear God, Dean had never seen anything comparable. Something so raw and divine and simply beautiful. The view, combined with the sinful moan that was drawn from Cas… Dean was sure he was delirious. In the best possible way.
It was only when the man calmly spoke that Dean had to swallow, but he still nodded, letting Zar know that he heard and respected his warning – and that he took it seriously. He wanted to tell him that it wasn’t needed, that he didn’t plan to ever hurt Cas again, in this life or any of the next. But the truth was, they were all human. They all made mistakes. Dean would say the same if the roles were reversed.
Cas shook his head and Dean could tell that he was holding his breath again; he was likely expecting more pain at any second now.
“Meh,” Dean replied. “It wasn’t too bad. And I needed something to save the seats.” However, he had to admit he was quite glad to be back in his coat. Clapping Bobby on his shoulder in greeting, he sat down on Sam’s other side, settling in to wait for Taylor’s speech.
“You’re here!” came the squeal from Michael’s daughter, Lucy, the moment the man had opened the door. Gracie was similarly excited to see her friend. Lucy was just a year younger than her and while the girls didn’t attend the same school, they spent a lot of time together anyway. A moment later, the rest of the kids were next to them as well, and so were most of Michael’s siblings. Michael hugged him in greeting before Dean carefully navigated through the little ones to greet all the others while somehow getting out of his coat without hitting anyone.
Dean counted himself fucking lucky when Cas turned towards him, no trace of discomfort or malice on his face as he simply replied, “I wasn’t.”
“Cas, man, you gotta decide.” Dean tried, he really tried to play this whole thing down, even smiling at Cas. He wasn’t sure, though, if he didn’t look more like a strangled cat. Still, he went on. “Either you keep running away from me or you continue bumping into me, which one is it going to be?”
He could tell that there was more to the name, could make out the approximate length of it, but everything after the C blurred too much to read and quickly faded away.
” both of them replied, earning a glare from Dean. Ignoring it, Jo went on. “So spill the beans, Winchester? How was the big reunion?”
The question was asked with a raised eyebrow but Dean didn’t let it deter him as he nodded. “If that’s the place we decide on in the future, then yes. Of course.” He was interrupted by a quick kiss but still went on, “Just… please don’t think you have to make that decision alone. I think that’s something we can – and probably should – talk about and discuss together. And we can’t forget about Gracie’s opinion in this.”
“How is it going for us?” Charlie asked back, grinning wildly. “The question should be, how is it going for
Despite that, they all trusted her. She was a damn good vet and she would take care of Ruby. She would help her deliver the foal into this world.
With that, he stepped away from her, instantly seeing his daughter again, this time in Cas’ embrace. They were not even ten yards away from him and when their eyes met, everything else seemed to melt away. The noises and the gazes, the knowledge of what would come after this, and the actual excitement about it. All that mattered was Cas.
However, the moment passed and out of nowhere, Cas’ eyes dimmed and his smile noticeably fell away. He even cleared his throat as if to pull himself out of the moment. He went back to his pie and didn’t reply to Dean at all.
At first, Dean ignored the hushed giggles and the excited tension lurking in the air. It was Monday after all, something probably happened on the weekend. Not to speak of the fact that Christmas was just around the corner.
This time, their friends weren’t calling from Charlie’s laptop while still at the hotel. When the call connected, the two of them were squeezed tight together, obviously calling from a phone. They were wrapped up in thick scarfs and beanies – Charlie’s in Gryffindor red and gold whilst Jo wore her favorite green set (which she adamantly ignored to label as ‘Slytherin’-colors even though everyone in the family knew she totally was a Snake) – and their faces were flushed from the cold, their smiles wide and beaming.
Once his daughter became aware of his presence, she packed up quickly. Giving Cas a hug before she left the diner. Dean fully intended to follow her right away, still adamant about not crowding in on Cas - not only to give him space but now also to avoid any more gossip - but he couldn’t help sending him a smile, quietly thanking him for being such a great friend to his daughter.
“Anyway,” he said, interrupting his own train of thoughts. “I guess it’s time to go before the next movie starts.” Getting up, he turned towards the man. “Cas? Let’s continue this talk tomorrow over dinner?”
Pulling Cas on top of his body, Dean bent one knee, letting Cas rest between his legs and their still clothed erections touch. It pulled a moan from both of them, swallowed by their kisses which grew heated from one second to the next.
Leaving his dark thoughts behind at the table, he didn’t let his mind think for a moment longer. Instead, he let the music wash over him and focused on the menial job at hand, and by the time he came up for air, he was surprised that it was about time to go and collect his daughter.
Thankfully, he was able to calm his mind from his thoughts about Cas enough that he could focus on other things - like work - by the time he parked Baby in the school’s parking lot. Gracie kissed his cheek before sprinting off to meet up with her friends, and Dean was confident that he would not think of blue eyes and a dark voice for the next few hours.
was the reason for him to be there? Can't wait to hear from you 💙💚 let me know if you liked to see this scene from Dean's POV - because I certainly enjoyed writing it!
He lost sight of her for a moment, so he looked back up at Lydia, no words left for her as the giddy excitement inside of him reached its boiling point. Just the prospect of having Cas back in his arms in a second would always do that to him.
hand in Dean’s - he had no desire for Brady’s hand to sully Cas’ touch. But it would be suspicious if he didn’t, so he swallowed any resentment and pasted a smile on his face.
For Eileen, he had found a beautiful print of Jane Austen’s ‘Persuasion’, which alongside ‘Pride and Prejudice’ was her favorite of Austen’s works and she thanked him with another heartfelt hug.
It wasn’t until they drew closer to the city limits of Stars Hollow and thus the road that led to the ranch, that Dean turned to look at Cas, squeezing his thigh to make sure he had his attention.
Rolling his eyes, Dean stepped up to the bed and gave his daughter a kiss on her forehead, letting himself be hugged. There was no use in admonishing her for being just as cheeky as her old man.
While he was certainly enjoying every minute with his family, Dean was - to his great shame - not fully invested, his thoughts often drifting back to last night’s conversation. Or really, any conversation he had been drawn into the past few days with his various family members and friends. But yeah, the one with Alice and Harry… that had been something else. His emotions were still a little out of sorts.
It was Cherry dancing nervously that finally made the decision for him somehow. Turning her around, Dean took the same way along the lake to get back home, eyes scanning the area on both sides closely. The further he got, the heavier his heart grew. Not finding Cas was a good thing, of course. But it also meant he’d missed him today.
He had no idea how much time had passed, maybe they’d even fallen asleep again, maybe not, but the next thing he was aware of was Dean’s hand softly brushing up and down his back.
He knew Max had issues at home and liked to stay in contact with his sister, just to make sure she was doing alright.
his friend was such a shark in the courtroom. He was sure any criminal would just crumble under such an intense gaze.
There was something else that might show Cas that he had nothing to worry about. Something Dean had forbidden himself to ever truly acknowledge. Because it was a line he had never wanted to cross. But he knew he could trust Cas with this.
As he got up to take some of the plates himself, his gaze fell across the table and at his best friend. Michael was still seated, gone was the general good mood he had been in the whole day. His eyes were trained on Dean, gaze darkened. Clearly, he had witnessed some of the exchange between Dean and Cas. And
A single tear ran down Cas’ cheek and Dean had to hold himself back from gently wiping it away. A moment longer, and he would have caved. He would have kissed away that tear – but Cas chose that moment to look at him fully.
At that, Gracie nodded for a long moment, apparently once again deep in thought. Suddenly, her head snapped up.
“What’s going on?” he asked in as calm a voice as he could muster, making it clear that he was not the same asshole he had been last Monday.
Had he been able to… to what? Manage to turn that hate around? Certainly not into love, no. But… maybe at least dimming it?
“I mean… this whole pandemic… all the classes canceled or moved online – which is great for stuff like this,” he said, pointing to his accounting book and the papers for the economics classes he had to take. “But sucks big time for the stuff that’s more practical than theoretical. Can’t really work on a car via Zoom.”
Chuckling darkly, Dean flushed just in case Michael was listening, then turned on the tab. He held his wrists under the water, letting the cold over his pulse slowly calm him and clear his head from all the fuzziness. For good measure, he also washed his face.
The shift in the atmosphere within the room was palpable, confirming Dean’s suspicions about a connection between Cas and the author even further. Trying not to give himself away, Dean turned around towards Gabriel.
The open floor plan made it so that every word spoken in the living room would be heard in the kitchen, even with Gracie’s talking. Dean was already hoping for this conversation to be done with before it even really began, when Eileen pulled at his shirt, marching down the hallway. She opened the door to his office and pushed him through before closing the door behind them.
Dean considered that for a moment before nodding in agreement. “Okay, point taken,” he said as he closed the door. “Guess we’ll order something then – unless you want some more pancakes.”
For the first time since Dean could remember, his mood was low when he got back from his ride. He really tried not to let it out on his horse, scrubbing Cherry down as gently as he could. After taking care of her, he hurried inside to get the first pancakes ready before Gracie would enter the kitchen. Her book was already lying on the kitchen table.
Dean couldn’t help the little teasing note in his voice; he was currently too giddy to control it. “Yeah, I know. It was hard not to hear how you hightailed it out of the city with your Camaro.”
to believe anymore. But whatever the truth is, Cas made it clear that he wants nothing to do with me. Not for real, anyway.”
She’d worn a costume close enough to Charlie’s and his own – a garment put together from their respective pride flags, not that it was all that original to be fair, but as always, C had agreed to what their friends wanted and Dean and Charlie had followed along. Cassie’s attire looked like it had been made by a professional, but who was to say his soulmate wasn’t talented when it came to handcrafted things, right?
“Stop that, Lydia. Stop with your stupid games,” he hissed, still not wanting to draw all that much attention. “You know what I mean.” When all she did was to keep silent and press her lips together, he went on. “You saw that Cas saw us, didn’t you? So you just had to be all over me.”
“What? Oh God, no. No Gracie, don’t think that.” Leaning up, Dean pulled her into a hug, neither of them caring for the awkward angle. “I loved your mother. I still do.”
“You told me to hit you with everything I got, so there we go.” The smile that went along with Cas’ challenging demeanor was rather distracting. “What do you think about Jane Austen?”
to wallow in this pain – did he even have a right to? After all he had put Cas through? – but the tears prickling in his eyes weren’t willed away this time.
The smaller gifts taken care of, Dean moved back to the tree to finally fetch the really important ones – at least in his own eyes.
His daughter nearly dropped the book resting against her bent knees, the flashlight in her right hand falling on her bed, her first reflex obviously being to shut off the light and any evidence. “Dad … it’s not –”
He could tell that Michael was arguing with himself. He probably wanted to say more. But in the end, he only shook his head, clapped Dean on the shoulder, and stepped off the porch.
“Urgh,” Dean groaned out, hiding his burning face in the crook of Cas’ neck. He really didn’t need the teasing and tried to hide away for longer, even when Cas began to gently kiss his neck. It wasn’t until he slowly, carefully nudged him with his shoulder that Dean moved his head, just enough to peek up at him, trying to gauge his reaction. When Cas caressed his cheek and then softly cupped it in his palm, Dean finally let himself relax again.
“It’s quiet here,” Claire replied with a shrug, but she didn’t push Castiel’s hand away and she hadn’t rolled her eyes. “The house is big.”
Dean rubbed a glove hand over his brow, trying to ignore the start of a pounding headache. The walking bridge emptied out into a parking lot, a few cars were parked and buried in snow. They moved into the center of it, looking around.
When Ben came flying down the stairs, his flannel overshirt flapping off one arm, Dean shut his eyes and shook his head, trying not to laugh. With shirt on appropriately, followed by shoes, Dean finally got Ben outside and the door locked behind them.
Not even a ride in Baby could draw his mind away from the ache in his lower back, and he groaned as he lowered himself into the driver’s seat. The heat of the day, emphasized in the black car, made sweat cling to his skin. He needed to go home, strip out of his scrubs, and resist the urge to get a six pack from the corner store.
Castiel turned his head again and gave him a questioning look. “I’m not sure if that was meant to be disappointment?”
“No problem, Ca- Mr. Kline.” He smiled and it was both genuine and stiff. Before Castiel could decipher how that was even possible, Dean slipped away, the door falling shut with a heavy thud. Castiel sighed in the silence and shook it off.
Softly, his hand running slowly over the center of Dean’s chest, Castiel said, “If you could refrain from getting shot again, I would really appreciate it.”
In the far corner, a fat, fresh Christmas tree stood, decorated with popsicle stick reindeer and clay handprints, large golden and red baubles. There was silver tinsel sprinkled across the branches, twinkling with the blinking colored lights, stray pieces littering the floor with pine needles. Dean found himself inhaling, as if he could smell the pine or the freshly baked cookies he could see sitting on a plate on the coffee table.
Two days ago, they’d stumbled upon a camp that had been ripped apart by Lifeless. At least, that’s the conclusion they’d come to. The remains that were there were completely torn apart, and blood covered the area as far as they could see. There was no way a human was responsible, not a way either of them wanted to contemplate. People had to retain their humanity, otherwise, what were they really fighting for?
“Thanks, Cas,” Dean whispered, finding Cas’ hand on the grass between them. Castiel turned his wrist, letting Dean lace their fingers together this time. They stayed there until the flames were out.
She’d launched herself over the counter, nails digging at Dean’s back as she took him down to the ground. He’d received a face-full of blood before he got his wits about him, twisting around to drag her off of him by her hair. She looked like herself, like the Lisa he’d built a life with over the last six years, in every way except for her eyes.
The sun was hot as it beat down on his back and his ass was on fire. Dean hadn’t been on a bike since he was a kid and if he ended up with a blister on his ass… well, he was giving up right then and there. He couldn’t bite back the cry of pain that fell from his lips as he got off the bike and laid it in the grass, his legs shaking with the effort it took to lower himself to sit. Despite the heat, the water in the canteen was cool enough to be refreshing and he ate one of the cucumbers with a few pieces of the chicken jerky. The idea of getting back on the bike made him want to cry, so he fished through the bag for some of the Tylenol he brought and swallowed down three.
Charlie nodded and quickly moved back to her spot, falling to her knees and pressing the baby against Gilda’s chest, both of them leaning over it and talking softly. Castiel was back beneath the blood-soaked sheet, giving gentle instruction to Gilda to finish up her labor, then made quick work of cleaning the area.
Instead of continuing downstairs, Dean went up, giving a cursory glance through Bobby’s room and the main bathroom before going to his old bedroom. It looked like he’d left it last and he sucked in a breath as he saw the two folded outfits on the end of the bed. They were outfits Lisa and Ben had left last summer when they were up for a week. Dean pointedly ignored them and turned to the medium-sized dresser.
Castiel glared at him and shrugged his shoulders. “I enjoy that, too. But Dean… there’s nothing like a good Pinot Grigio or Merlot!”
“She even smells the same,” Castiel commented, reaching forward to run his hands over the dashboard. “Is there still an army man in the ashtray?”
Sam couldn’t help him that time. Dean sold the garage and used the money to live off of, locking himself in the large, three bedroom house with only Jack Daniel’s for comfort. He wouldn’t see anyone - not Uncle Bobby, not Sam or Jess, not his best friend Charlie. Lisa would text him every week or so, with updates about Ben, but never answered any phone calls or replied to any of his drunken ramblings or questions.
“New-level beings?” Dean chewed out the words, swirling the drink in his hands letting the scent of whiskey hitting him. “Uh, you mean the Lifeless that would like nothing more than to tear us apart and suck on our entrails?”
Chuck flung the doors open and Dean jerked back so hard in the chair that it scooted across the carpet a few inches. Inside the closet, a Lifeless was suddenly aware the doors were open, her eyes blood red and her mouth open in a gurgling scream as she flailed against the chains that bound her. Her dress was blood stained, her hair once twisted at the base of her skull was now matted and stringy. Her skin was mottled shades of grey and green and black.
The downstairs was warm and well lit, with people milling about. There were couches and chairs around the room and Castiel could see much of the same through the open doorway. The atmosphere made Castiel instantly comfortable. It took him a moment to recognize who was an employee and who was a client, but every Alpha and Omega seemed relaxed and happy. He supposed that
