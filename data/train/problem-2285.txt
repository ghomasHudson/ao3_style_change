"I mean, come on John, don't make me say it so bluntly. I mean, after the whole leaving your wedding before you even got married sort of thing"
John turned his head, his eyes piercing into Sherlock's and no words were needed, they spoke with their eyes and the words of fear were evident and Sherlock could feel everything.
"If this is love, I don't want it" Sherlock said, his voice frail "take it, I don't want it. Not if it feels like this, it hurts"
"Do you trust me?" Sherlock asked, his hands pushing past John's waist until they reached around his back and pulled him close.
"Oh, John! Look at you" She spoke, covering her mouth as the emotions overwhelmed her "How long has it been?"
"and that's it?" Lestrade asked, his face laced with utter confusion - you'd think after all these years he would be used to this by now.
"Look at you" she snapped, pulling a chair from the kitchen to sit beside John. She sat down, gazing up and down at him in dissatisfaction "I expected more from you"
"You don't miss a thing, do you?" John laughed, turning to look at Sherlock with a smile, he joined him, sitting in the seat beside him and reached his hand out onto his thigh. He felt Sherlock's hand grab his, lacing his fingers through his own. "Well, yes, I suppose we are rather official, I guess. I suppose that happens when you nearly face death, well, it did this time anyway"
"Yes, hilarious Mycroft" John rolled his eyes, he liked mycroft, truly, he did - but like every other person in the world, he found him an utter cock most of the time.
They parked up outside, John's usual space. They stepped out together, John guiding Rosie round towards the door with an arm around her waist, a comforting smile on his face as he tried to keep her calm. He knew she was a mix of both excitement and worry and he hated seeing her worry - she really shouldn't be worried when meeting her god parent.
"As much as I hate to think about how my call was a disturbance to you both, I'm afraid things need to be said and as my brother refuses to turn his phone, you're both to hear what I need to say. - please put me on speaker, John"
"John, can you not just believe me, just this once? I can assure you, I'm telling the truth, I really am" he pleaded.
"Please, yes" Sherlock babbled, soon realising how desperate he seemed, he choked out a quick "If we must" as though to disguise his obvious need. John grinned, his free hand gripping the back of his neck to pull his lips onto his own, his own tongue parting Sherlock's lips to find his, he hummed a moan against Sherlock, admiring how they must have looked to anyone who walked in at that very moment. "Hold on" Sherlock suddenly said, reluctantly removing himself from John's lap and standing in front of him with wary eyes, biting on his lower lip. John watched, confused mainly, unsure if Sherlock actually understood what they were supposed to be doing right now.
"Very well" was all John muttered out, he buttoned his suit jacket and head for the door. His hand grasping the handle, he froze for a second turning to look at her "I'm sorry"
They parted lips, their lips still inches away from one another and John could feel Sherlock's unsteady and heavy breath against his own.
Whereas, Sherlock was experiencing everything all at once, he didn't know what it would feel like to be doing this with John Watson, his best friend. He had thought about it, of course he had, who wouldn't? He had found himself pondering over John's arse on more than one occasion, practically examining it to the last detail, yet, he was still unaware how he had managed to be blessed with such a thick and beautiful arse.
He halted, noting the eyes of their friends as they awaited an answer, even Molly who had been extremely quiet since arriving.
He scooped an arm around his waist and pulled him into his chest, then placed a sloppy, tired, adorable kiss against his lips "Good morning"
"Oh, blame me, why don't you?" Sherlock rolled his eyes, turning to Rosie with a smirk "I actually suggested we turned them off at around one this morning however your daughter convinced me to believe you had said it was okay"
"Did you... Did you just swear?" John's head snapped back slightly as he heard the word fall from Sherlock's lips as though it didn't belong there.
"Yes, but how about we watch a nice soppy movie like you suggested and pretend you're not a detective for the evening" John cocked an eyebrow with suggestion as he pulled Sherlock down to sit beside him. "Don't worry, I won't tell anybody, won't want to ruin your street cred, would I?"
"I-" John began, falling back into his seat, his eyes still wide as he glared at the figure in front of him. He didn't know how to react, he had gone over this moment in his head over and over in the early days. Thinking about all the things he wanted to say to him but when it finally came to it, twelve years later, he was stunned. The speech he once prepared now vanished into a distant part of his brain "-this isn't real. I don't. Why, now? Why now? Twelve sodding years, Sherlock"
I'll be posting 1/2 chapters every two days, there may be some delay if I am working or can't find the time but I'll let you know on my tumblr - Moriartydefence or if you follow me on twitter just send me a dm @text_larry :)
"Oh John, she's allowed to hear about how her dad and his boyfriend used to run the streets of London" Mrs H spoke randomly, swatting John's arm as he walked past.
"He's especially more determined than Jim, that is clear. He really worked for this moment, he knew we'd approach Molly when we returned and he knew that Molly would come home to him and tell him all she has seen, she would have told him everything"
"John has a daughter, he has been out of this now for years, he does not need to be put in danger purely because you cannot handle a situation yourselves. And I, will once again tell you, I am not inclined to your pathetic case or this pathetic character. It is boring. We have done this once before and I refuse to do it all over again"
"You listened to your bloody brother? You actually went to Mycroft for advice? Jesus, Sherlock that was stupid, even for you"
"I'm not going to admit it" he refused, crossing his arms over his chest "it's been years, I think maybe we should all just get over it. Rosie was bloody one when Sherlock up and left, she's now thirteen. That's twelve years here's been gone and he's not coming back. We could all mope around waiting and waiting but it would be a waste of time, that stubborn bastard will hide away until he's ready and knowing Sherlock bloody Holmes, it'll be the day we're all on our death bed"
"You sound sure of yourself" John cocked an eyebrow towards him, not quite sure if he believed him at all.
"God yes" John said without hesitation, admiring Sherlock's lips as they curved into a small smile. He stood up, standing in front of the taller man with cautious eyes, his hands went straight to the bottom of Sherlock's jumper, a tight grip as he pushed it up until he was pulling it from the top of his head and throwing it onto the sofa without a care, knowing that later Sherlock would most likely complain about how John had just thrown a stupidly expensive piece of clothing. His hands then went to the top of Sherlock's polo top, his fingers twiddling to free the buttons one by one, his eyes never leaving Sherlock's nervous ones "Are you sure about this, love?"
Rosie walked ahead, grabbing her dads keys as she head for the front door. "I'll meet you in the car" she said, opening it, leaving it open as she walked out. Sherlock looked at John and could see every inch of worry that spread across his face - he wasn't going to let him lose anybody else, not today, not ever.
He felt the tear fall from his cheek so effortlessly, burning on his skin like his body rejected it. He hated this.
"I was just" He starts and stops, rolling his eyes at himself, clearly growing frustrated "- could we cuddle?"
"In the past two weeks you've managed to come back and be someone completely new, you've done flowers and chocolates, dates in the living room, attempted to cook, surprised me, told me you loved me and managed to be my daughters best friend - please tell me this isn't just a stupid investigation or something"
"I think-" Sherlock starts and stops, trying to consider a proper answer to her admission "your father only has good intentions for you, he most likely hid our past to help not only himself but you also. It wasn't a very safe or stable lifestyle, Rosie, I can assure you"
He stepped inside the restaurant, it was lunch and yet, it was still quiet only the odd two tables being used. His eyes scanned over, looking for the mess of curls, he stood for a minute, nearly giving up before he saw a hand waving at him excessively. He nodded, swerving his way between the tables as he made his way towards Sherlock.
John's eyes softened at that, the smile Sherlock loved so dearly creeping across his now swollen lips.
"but if I persue this, I could also likely lose my life John. There is no winning here - I'm not the man I once was, my mind isn't as strong. I would be putting you and Rosie in danger"
"I deduced you would be - an out of character move from a close friend is out of expectations and that would result in shock, confusion and-"
" he says gesturing between the two of them "is going to be a thing, then I don't think I can bare to lose you - not again"
He stood still, his lips closed, silent - nothing in the air but Sherlock and John's equally unsteady breath, usually Sherlock would have intervened by now but John didn't have the time to ask what he was doing, he was too focused on the man in front of them.
"Honestly, Mr Trainer, I would not be worried. You have slightly shafting between your thighs, you're not going to die" John  explained, his eyes flickering between the clock and his irritating patient
"He always says that, don't believe him" Mrs H winked at Rosie before she turned around and head back into her kitchen.
"I have to say, as much as Mrs hudson does dislike me, John is right, Sherlock" Mycroft added in, his eyes fairly soft compared to his usual glance.
"Yes you did" Mrs Hudson stated as she walked into the room with another tray of tea. "She was bound to be a little like Sherlock, after all, she was with him during her first months"
They arrived at the scene, the first floor of London's biggest NatWest bank - the whole floor cut off with police tape and wire, John stood beside Sherlock as they looked at the victim.
"is that what you're worried about? That I didn't enjoy it? Bloody hell, Sherlock. If I didn't enjoy it I wouldn't have dropped to my knees for you within minutes of being alone"
"Yes, so Jel" John mimicked, stepping in the door and closing it behind him. He shuffled his jacket from his arms, placing it on the rack beside the door as though he was walking back into his own home. He stepped in front of Rosie who was still gawking around in the hallway "Mrs H, are you here?"
"Jesus, but it's no where near Bonfire Night? How does he expect to find a bonfire at this time of the year?"
"but, why? You're there now, it would make better sense if I just came there and me, you and Sherlock could have dinner together"
"Ah, dearest Molly, there was once a time you would have been over joyed by me barging into this room" Sherlock fired back.
Sherlock kept his arm firmly around John's shoulders, his gaze drifting away, obviously thinking, deeply - John was sat awkwardly, just waiting for the moment Sherlock would snap out of it with some comment he wouldn't understand, but a minute passed, then another and then another until his arm was heavy on his shoulder and John became uncomfortable.
"Oh for goodness sake, Sherlock! Look at yourself" Mrs Hudson shouted, standing to her feet at a threatening stance, her eyes glaring at Sherlock until he stood down. His eyes softening slightly "you only have yourself to blame, you have never admitted this to him and he's never been the wiser of it - what did you expect to happen? He stay single forever and scurry round London solving crimes until you are both old and grey?"
The smell was the first thing he noticed, other than the unchanged decor that would most likely still be the same after they were gone, it was fresh, like he had actually cleaned it. John was so used to the smell of dust that he would usually prepare himself with an inhaler in hand before he entered, but not this time, he could actually smell an array of air freshener. That was baffling on its own.
"Surprising. My brother always spoke about your connections with Scotland Yard, they like you, don't they? Very much so. Very good friends, actually, how was the house warming?"
"I took a step backwards and forgot you were there, I attempted to not stand on your head and instead tripped over my own foot"
"Bed? It's six, John. You don't usually sleep until around ten, after you have dozed in your chair for ten minutes of course"
, in fact. I am not going anymore, I'm a grown bloody man and I want to live a normal bloody life with John"
"It's going to be okay, sweetheart. It won't feel like this forever" She cooed into him, holding him tightly.
John looked at his daughter, his eyes filling up slightly, he was bewildered by her. He knew she was smart just like her mum but he never knew just how clever she really was.
They reached the third floor, one below the roof, Sherlock being first to swing the door open making a very startled Molly Hooper jump out of her skin.
Mycroft's eyes had slowly widened as John spoke, shocked by his words and yet as he finished all he could do was nod "Very well, I hope that the two of you spend together as much time as you wish"
"You should never do something you're unsure about, you could live to regret it" John said, a sympathetic smile across his lips, he could see the pain in Craig's eyes "- you've already hurt one of our friends, part of our family actually"
That was the only text John had received that day even after spamming Sherlock's phone with practically hundreds of texts asking what exactly it meant. He had spent his entire day at work trying to figure out what he had planned, that was the thing with Sherlock, he was so unexpected. He would either be planning a dinner out or a thorough examination of the dead human body 4 days post death.
"But, I'm tired" Sherlock whined, pouting at him although still pushing himself up until he sat back on his heels again.
They both watched, Mycroft left the room, his fellow government officials following his steps until the door closed - leaving only John and Sherlock and the odd few officers lurking, in the room.
Sherlock stood still, his lips tightened in a thin line, the first time John had ever seen him even remotely listen to a word he had said. He couldn't see whether or not he was taking it in and coming up with an answer or had just given up.
"Sherlock, please don't encourage her" John sighed, rubbing his eyes with his hands - he knew by now that when together, they were as bad as each other if not worse.
"You barely showed any affection to her when she was first born and now you've managed to get a closer bond with her than I have in years, I just don't understand it, Sherlock" John spoke, baffled and confused all at the same time.
He was in two minds about today, even when he had stepped out of his car and had began his walk down to the small restaurant down the street. He knew that he should have acted differently yesterday, maybe threw a few bottles, head butted Sherlock a few times, even punched him, but when it came to it, he saw no need for it. Not this time. He was so full with gratitude that his best friend was still alive and well that the idea of throwing punches and lunging for him seemed pointless. But it did not defy the fact that he was more than a little pissed off at him. And he was certainly not going to forgive him that easily.
"Because you care about me, that's what friends do, they care about each other and whether you like it or not, you do care about me. That's why you always come back - to me"
"Does anyone want a hot chocolate?" John asked, leaning up slightly with a sigh, looking at Rosie first who smiled and nodded. He turned to the other side "Sherlock? Hot chocolate? They're Rosie's favourites"
"Please, I must ask you not to" Sherlock shook his head firmly, closing his eyes as he turned his back to him "I care for you very much, John Watson. However, I must ask you to give me some time to heal from this whole situation"
Their thighs were touching, John's legs close enough to practically drape over Sherlock's. Probably because of how amazed he was over Sherlock's thighs in those jeans. He tried to act as platonically as possible, which was near impossible. They sat closely, no words spoken as they head to Lestrades, that was until half way through the journey.
"Right - so, research possible deaths through fire?" John cocked an eyebrow, glancing at the laptop.
"Jesus" John sighed leaning his head back against the wall in the hallway, phone still in hand "When will this bloody end?"
John pulled Sherlock's jeans down to his knees and then, teasingly and painfully slow he pulled his boxers down to match. He bowed down slightly, taking Sherlock's cock into his hand, watching as Sherlock's head flung back and his eyes closed, he honestly could have came at the sight. Watching The Sherlock Holmes come undone in front of him, what a sight.
"I'm glad to see you're not deceased" Sherlock simply said, taking a step back until his feet hit the back of the chair and fell onto it.
"Maybe we shouldn't walk in holding hands" John slowly said "it's just, Rosie doesn't know that we're trying this"
He stood up, his legs lifting him without his mind being able to comprehend what he was doing. He felt the blood boil as his name began to roll of his tongue over and over again, the years of pain just flying from him all at once and he was at boiling point.
"Not surprising - all murderers enjoy telling others of their 'victims' and their death, it's a malicious joy for them"
"Very" Mrs H nodded in agreement, taking a sip of her tea. Her eyes were drifting between John and the clock and John had caught onto this, he had forgotten all about Greg coming.
John stiffened, his vision blurry as the anger took over him "Don't you dare pin this on him, your brother did that all on his own - he chose every move he made, every stupid bloody decision and ultimately, instead of saving himself and Sherlock, he took his own life instead - you lost your brother because he was sick, mentally and physically unwell and he needed help, where were you?"
"Did you not enjoy that, Rosie?" Sherlock asked, looking up finally to give her a short smile as he wiped it from his arm "- I wouldn't waste it, you've got a busy day of school"
John sat there, his body still stunned and yet he felt himself tear up, he had never seen him so fragile and frail and to know it was due to him made it hurt even worse.
"Indefinitely, John. I'm not going anywhere" Sherlock spoke and the way his voice cracked, John took it as a promise, he knew that Sherlock's idea of a promise was never to be trusted but as ever, he let his naivety win, accepting that as a valid answer.
Sherlock didn't give her a chance to finish, instead leading a nearly silent John through the hall in a hurried skip, pushing past people with little care. John was still silent, his eyes focusing on Sherlock's hand as he dragged him through and through, he was panicking - he wasn't expecting this, he wasn't ready for this to start again and he most definitely wasn't ready to lose somebody else. Not twelve years later.
He wrapped his arms around her and pulled her close, a small smile on his lips as he held her. And John could feel his eyes welling up, he had no idea what would happen today but to see this picture in front of him warmed his heart. This one moment proved how much they had missed out on whilst Sherlock was away, they could have been so close - best friends, even.
"Really?" She nearly squealed "oh my god, yes, thank you dad! I've got to text the girls, they're all going to be so jealous"
"Of course I do, Sherlock, I just want to know that we're going into this with the conclusion that we're going to walk out alive"
"He never left" Sherlock stated, simply. "I felt to be cautious around you, due to my actions. I am still here"
"I see" John said, although he wasn't entirely sure. He was still baffled "if you did like me, why did you not act sooner?"
And on this day, the day of the wedding, Sherlock had found himself pacing back and forth the living area that he and John once shared and wondering whether things would ever be as they once was.
John cut him off immediately "you just waltz back in as though nothing has happened, as though you haven't missed out on years of my life or years of Rosie's life, you say you're sorry, like last time and expect everything to be fine and dandy again. But that's not how it works anymore Sherlock, we're not two lads going round running the streets of London nearly getting killed every five minutes. Especially not me, I'm not your partner anymore, I'm an adult, with responsibility and you just had to come back and mess that up, didn't you?"
"Dad, is that you?" He heard Rosie's voice after he had heard the running of her footsteps down the stairs.
"What were you even cooking?" John asked, feeling Sherlock's arm as it snaked around his waist pulling him closer to his side.
"Molly? What? I don't understand" John said his famous line, but it was true, he didn't, he never bloody understood.
"I'm sorry for how you have felt, I too did feel that way and I would never wish that on another, especially the person I find myself infatuated with" He apologised, sincerely.
"I was going to say - yes, that's exactly what I wanted to tell you" Sherlock spoke, his voice so little and so fragile as if to admit it was going to jeopardise everything.
"Are you... Sherlock, you're the smartest and most intelligent man I have ever met but you are also the most fucking stupid. I have waited to hear those words leave your lips, dreamt of them, of course I wouldn't say it through pity, you daft twat"
"She's out of surgery, skin graft was successful, however she still hasn't woke up, we're just hoping for the best now"
"Oh, come on babe. You know what he's like, it was probably really hard for him to admit that to you, he's dealing with it all - he'll speak about it when his mind has finally slowed down" She sympathised.
Sherlock stayed still, his arms falling to his sides, his eyes a look of mere confusion. He could never understand this feeling he had encountered but to hear it splayed out in front of him so bluntly, it hit him, he, Sherlock Holmes, was utterly and desperately in love with John Watson and there was nothing he could do about it - not now, not ever.
Sherlock choked out slightly, adjusting himself and his sweater before he slowly and cautiously walked towards John, his head down as his eyes stayed on the floor. John reached out an inch closer, grabbing Sherlock's hand in his own and pulling him closer until he was stood between John's legs, he laced his fingers through his and smiled softly.
Sherlock rolled his eyes before giving in, walking beside John and leaning down to kiss her on the cheek "Right, sorry, Hello Molly, lovely day, isn't it?"
"They don't deserve an answer, they're simply strangers who fixated on two random men who solved crimes. They're nobody to me. I have given my answer to you and that's all what matters"
"A man" He said to himself, already collecting ideas at what this one could be. Maybe a cold and believing they were dying because their temperature was simply 1 point to high?
"Oh" was all that left Sherlock's lips "I have to be honest with you, John. I have no idea how relationships work or how any of it works, I need you to lead me in this or it will be an absolute disaster for both of us"
"That sounds perfect" Sherlock smiled sincerely, reaching out for the cup of tea that John had slid towards him "I told you, the game is on and I'm fully invested, I'll do anything"
"I confided in Irene, she supposed I wait until you were ready to speak about it, be as cold as I possibly could so you would finally make the first move in all of this - god, I knew she was wrong. Bloody criminals these days, they truly cannot be trusted" He spoke clearly, his head lifting from his hands.
"You're only taste is horror films, where you continue to shout abuse at the victims for being so clueless and judge the murderers for being so careless" John argued, standing to his feet, lacing his fingers through Sherlock's as he attempted to lift him.
"You're adorable" John said, resting his head back and replacing it with his fingers, running them through his hair.
"Three in a week, all shot, instant kill" Greg shouted over, unbothered by the glances by the staff members around him.
"Does, I mean, do you think sometimes my dad doesn't like me? I mean, sometimes I think he resents me - because I remind him of mum and I'm scared that every time he looks at me he's just reminded of her and how sad it was" She asked, more of an admittance, her eyes slightly glazed over.
"Oh? Then why are you here? You have become putty in my fingers, Sherlock Holmes, you are simply doing nothing more than bringing yourself to your fate. And that is, inevitably, your end"
"I refuse" Sherlock shook his head "- I refuse to be a part of this absolute madness any longer, I want a normal life with no possible psychopath's coming to haunt me. It's your turn to fight this Mycroft not me"
"Yeah well, that's life I'm afraid. People tend to do that when they're waiting for someone to come back"
"Please, John. Refrain from mocking me, it is all as confusing to me as it is you" Sherlock said, his eyes peering down onto his nervous hands.
John nodded "He didn't ask you that, Craig, his crazy and extremely damaged mind asked you to do that. Can you remember a time when your brother wasn't like that?"
221B was silent, not a single sound airing over the flats, a pin drop could have been heard. The two boys were sat in silence, never had John heard this flat so quiet, even on their off days he would walk in to be greeted with gun shots or some sort of explosion but this time - there was nothing. It was horrible.
However, John was currently sat on his bed, his back up against his headboard, muttering obscene words under his breath - attempting not to run down the stairs and knock him right off his chair with a barrel of insults about his stupid, irritating, lovely curly hair.
He opened the door, walking towards the larger three-seater sofa, but was stopped with a grasp on his arm. He frowned, turning to look at Sherlock. "You alright?"
"Dad" Both of their heads turned as the front door slammed shut, the ruffle of bags, shoes and a coat being thrown around were the only noises distinguishable.
"I'm not letting you come home. You're perfectly fine, you're not being sick, you have not got a high temperature and you're not dying. So, why on earth would you need to come home?"
"I don't know, maybe because you two were walking around London in the middle of the day? You really are stupid sometimes. Anyway, you're the biggest news right now"
"You say that now but-" John was interrupted as his phone began to vibrate on the coffee table beside them.
"Well, considering you are no longer running havoc on the streets, I saw no need to monitor you any longer, clearly that was a bad decision"
"Gladly" Mycroft smiled tilting his head as a short goodbye. "- be careful, brother mine. I do not wish to tell our parents you have died, again"
"After so long? You do realise that in normal people time, that's a lifetime to them. You have affected Doctor Watson more than you could ever imagine"
"I'm not... No, Sherlock, I would never even attempt to mock you because of how you feel" John shook his head, Sherlock soon noticed that John was now kneeling on the end of his bed, slowly shuffling his way towards him "I'm annoyed because you didn't tell me before, I'm annoyed that you waited until the day of my wedding and I'm annoyed because I fell in love with you from the moment I met you and did nothing about it"
"You mean, for sucking your dick?" John asked blatantly, he choked out a laugh as he watched Sherlock halt, his tea spilling slightly onto his lap. "I'm kidding, it's fine, you don't need to bloody thank me. Although, we do need to speak about what just happened"
"Oh, come on dad! Stop acting like I'm oblivious. You do realise that I am currently in high school, right?"
"Yeah, well, she doesn't have a normal sleeping pattern, does she? Remember she was once running a drug lords home. People never popped round in the day to pick a package, she would have to be up all night, just in case"
"You. You're amazing. You spent so long acting as though you had no heart inside that strange body of yours yet all along you've had a heart of gold - how? I mean, why did you act so cold for so long when this version of you was a thing? Why hide it?"
"The Harry Potter films?" John finally asked, hiding his smile beneath his cup "- but you hate fantasy and fiction"
"Do I?" John asked, turning round the look at her "You realise I spent most of my life working, looking after you and then sleeping, right? This is the first time in years I've had my life back"
"You don't have to, not for now, at least. I feel as though we've had enough excitement for one day, don't you?"
"You" John began mumbling against Sherlock's lips as his fingers worked the buttons on his freshly ironed shirt "are fucking beautiful"
She stormed off, her arms folded over her chest as she began pulling every pair of shoes off the rack until she had found the pair she just definitely had wear that day. He was certain that he heard some word of profanity leave her mouth and he was about to lose his shit, but just before he could unleash his wrath his phone began vibrating on the counter beside him, saved by the... vibration?
"There's endless possibilities, John and he will stop at nothing - he will attack everyone that we love, until finally he gets to me, who he needs" Sherlock spoke slowly. "- you realise we are risking everyone's life"
"Will you shut up? Your voice is an irritant. If anything, you completely ruin my thought process" Sherlock waved him off, sitting on the chair in front of his desk in annoyance "I'm not asking for your permission, Mycroft. I'm telling you that I'm going back"
"Look, lads, I'm sorry but your vacation time of well - 12 years, may have to come to an end already"
It was silent again, this time Sherlock leaning his head back to look at John who shrugged his shoulders and after a minute or so, the laughter began to erupt from the two of them.
"Wait, John, stop" Sherlock scattered out, pulling back from his ever so sweet lips and grasping on his hands before he could release the final button of his shirt.
"He got obsessed with some books, I can't remember the names but they were so weird - he spoke about them for days, they were based on hurting people, for fun almost... eventually his friends stopped calling, he stopped going out and he was isolating himself in his room. It was like he lost himself, mum and dad were so worried, they couldn't even talk to him. It was as if he was fighting with himself, we would sit downstairs and hear him shouting at himself, an argument almost"
"And it worked, I didn't see through his mask to begin with - I didn't understand, but I do this time, oh I do this time. Molly, she said early, it was her and her husbands anniversary, what name did she say, John?"
"Ah, he's much more sentimental than you think he is" John smiled fondly, reaching a hand out to take Sherlock's, lacing his fingers through his own and leaning against his leg.
"Thanks mate" John laughed, still finding the compliment side of their 'friendship' kind of awkward "Shall we?"
"You, what?" Sherlock's eyes widened, he peered down to see John's hands now placed on his knees, he pushed them a part and then pulled them so Sherlock lay flat.
"I didn't want to hurt her" He shook his head "I don't want to hurt anybody, I just want to do what he asks, that's all, he just asked me"
"sorry, I got over excited. Anyway, all of my friends are so jealous. My maths teacher spent the whole hour just asking me questions about you both, she was a huge fan during the
"I can't afford to do this unless you're serious, I have a daughter and a life to consider" John closed his eyes, trying to escape his thoughts as they repeated '
He lay there for what seemed an eternity, bellowing in his own self-pity, Mrs Hudson surprisingly staying behind and checking on him two hours after John had left, she sat on the end of bed, her hand rested on his ankle as he simply lay there, tears still streaming down his cheeks and his eyes focused on the plain, pale white wall beside him. Sherlock couldn't fathom out the words she was saying, only noting the name John as it rolled of her tongue and the rest nothing more than a mumble.
Unless he did, Sherlock moved his hands innocently, simply stretching his arm and yet when his hands grazed over John's groin, he had to stifle in the moan that was forcefully trying to escape his swollen lips, he had been biting down on his bottom lip notoriously.
"Lads!' Greg grinned from ear to ear, standing back slightly to let them through the door "Welcome to my humble abode!"
"Yes, but, do you not think that my dad being a hero to the country is something I'd like to know? I felt stupid when everyone knew about it and I didn't, I even had some of the mums come up and ask me if you were single. It was embarrassing"
"Maybe so" Sherlock sighed, his eyes reaching John's "but even if I did, you would be without Rosie. And that is not a life worth thinking about"
"Not physically" Sherlock shook his head, his eyes scrunching shut once again "I... Look, I am not good with declarations nor am I equipped to open myself to others, this is difficult for me and I'm not sure how to say it"
"Good night, sweetheart. Sleep well" He spoke softly, releasing her slightly so she could lean over and kiss her dad on the cheek briefly before heading out of the living room and closing the door behind her.
"Now, usually, after someone declares their love for someone things are different - you, on the other hand, you big bastard you, have done the exact opposite, in fact, you've only gone back into your old ways. I didn't spend all these years getting to know the real you for you to go right back to our first days, that's not how this works" John spoke firmly, ignoring the confused look across Sherlock's face.
"You allow your feelings to get the better of you for even a slight second and suddenly you're back into detective mode?"
"Then, I'll sort you some clothes, let's go for a shower before she gets home" John said, standing to his feet and lacing his fingers through Sherlock's.
"Just this. Sitting in the kitchen of my family home having a cup of tea with you knowing that it'll just be a normal evening - it's strange, usually a cup of tea with you leads to clients and multiple deaths"
He looked around the flat once more, noticing the fine details that concluded that Sherlock really was real and they were, slowly, fading away into the dust, much like the memory of him.
"Mycroft, get out" John rolled his eyes, lifting an arm to point towards the door "you're not convincing him anymore than you have already tried. Just get out"
"Hi, I hope you don't mind. I reserved this table as it was away from the windows. I didn't want the media to get ahold of the fact I'm back, not yet anyway, can't really be dealing with criminals and crazed fans"
"Did you really need security?" A voice spoke, not much different from their own enemy, in fact, quite similar - yet the tone was different. "It's a nice place this, very fitting, isn't it?"
"My brother had only one goal in his life, to destroy you and everyone you loved - he then passed that goal onto me"
"I still can't quite believe that. Usually, knowing you, you have a secret motive behind it, that's usually why you do the things you do"
He glanced up quickly to make sure Rosie hadn't seen the text, the last thing he'd need was for her to see what her beloved father had done today to his best friend. He was lucky, she was still rambling on. He took the chance to quickly text back, nodding every now and then so she would believe he was listening.
"I've had so many people come and ask me if my dad was the real John Watson, to begin with I wondered what the hell they were on about, until I googled your name for the first time. First article that came up was your blog, dad"
"God, you make me sick" Rosie whined, moving her chair away from her dad and closed to Mrs Hudson "Save me, please. He's like a lovesick puppy"
John barely drove, except the past three days, it's the first few times in months that he's needed to drive anywhere. The Doctors office was only a 5 minute walk from his house, Rosie took the bus to school and if they were going anywhere they would usually grab a taxi or ride the tube. But today, he had Rosie in the car with him and they were taking the twenty minute drive into London. To say he was nervous was an understatement, he didn't know what to expect.
His feet carried him to the front door, he lifted his fist considering knocking to begin with but his fingertips soon found the handle and he gripped it tightly, closing his eyes slightly, he knew that this was going to bring back a whirlwind of memories and he really wasn't ready for it. He sighed, pushing the handle down, opening it wide and taking a step inside.
"Why can't you sort this? Actually, why haven't you sorted it? It's been a week and a half since you told us about it and you've allowed him to do this" John accused "- what exactly is your job, Mycroft? Why does it always come down to Sherlock to fight your bloody battles? You're the government for fuck sake"
It took only a few minutes for Rosie to finally release her Godfather from her grips and soon they were all sat around together near the fire place with a nicely made cup of tea curtesy of Mrs Hudson, it didn't take long for Rosie to start piling a tonne of questions at Sherlock.
"Oh shut up, you daft prick. I love it, it's adorable even if we are in our forty's and this is something for people in their tween's" John smiled softly "it's a lovely idea, and is that food I smell? Please tell me you haven't cooked?"
He thought for a second, peering up at the clock with a glance before sighing and nodding his head, he unbuttoned his suit jacket and sat a seat away from him, his back up straight and his palms on his thighs. Uncomfortable.
"Excuse me, I hope you aren't attempting to blame me" Sherlock suddenly waltzed in, he always looked wonderful in the morning.
"It's you" was all that escaped his lips, in his mind that was enough, he admitted it, he said the cause of all his worry, all of the emotions that had pained him for so long, it was all John.
Sherlock tilted his head to the side with a smile "Good Evening Rosie, how was your time at your grandmothers?" He asked, still humming into the feel of John.
"I mean, I'm a real adult now, I'm in my bloody forty's, I have a teenage daughter, an actual, real-life, grown up, mortgage to pay to keep a roof over our heads and a job that I actually have to turn up to every day. It's bloody terrifying"
Sherlock was silent, his hands dropping until they were on his lap, his eyes were slightly frantic. He hadn't expected this.
He was in his kitchen, leaning against the kitchen counter reading the texts he had revived from Rosie whilst getting ready.
"Mycroft" Sherlock's voice alerted John, his eyes finally looking up to see Mycroft and other officials standing around him.
"I take all of my cases extremely seriously John, you know that" Sherlock defended "this is my hardest case yet"
After John had left Sherlock's the night before, he has received not a single text. He maybe assumed that his proposition of him fighting and working for John was something that Sherlock could simply not handle and had most likely turned to drugs or a plane journey to get away from the situation. Or - john was just over reacting, as always.
"Ah" she noted, ushering him to follow her into her kitchen as she head towards the kettle "I understand. Hard work, aren't they?"
"I don't know-" John stopped, peering down at his watch for a second. He still had hours, Rosie was going to her aunts after school so he didn't really have to be home until this evening. Yet, he felt like a stop out already, he had spent two whole days out of the house which was an achievement for him these days. He was usually much lazier. "Okay, I can pop in for a little bit"
"I want no part of it" Sherlock intervened "arrest him, for heavens sake. Stop allowing people to test me to my limits and allow me to run around London after some psychopath and actually do your jobs. You've been doing so for years, you don't need me now"
They remained like that until they reached the hospital, Sherlock threw whatever money he could find in his pocket in direction of the driver and directed John out of the taxi. They remained hand in hand, walking into the hospital together - Sherlock practically pulled John in, knowing that he wouldn't have coped alone.
"okay, you've been talking to Mrs H too much. Stop with all of this. Look, I'm here to visit Sherlock so I'll speak to you later on at home and please, for the love of god, do not call me again"
He could have lay there forever, wrapped against Sherlock, completely bewildered by this beautiful man - however, as his eyes flickered up to the clock on the wall, he knew that they didn't have the time to do that.
"You're very lucky to be alive" Lestrade spoke, his voice firm as he peered over his pint glass. Swallowing some before continuing "if we would have been even five minutes later, the smoke would have filled your lungs"
"Well, I'm surprised you find love so boring - you are after all, married to Molly" Sherlock quizzed, his eyes focused on his every movement, analysing his every breath "I believe marriage is based on love"
"Maybe, if you didn't stay up till godly hours of the morning, you wouldn't be so bloody tired all the time" John retaliated, leaning against the counter.
"You're still bitter about that?" She laughed, rolling her eyes at John as as though he was spitting nonsense "John, when will you bloody realise that he did it for you"
"-Scared that he'd hurt me or worse, not be able to help me. Does he not realise that running away and leaving me alone when I needed him most was the most hurtful thing he could do? That's how he hurt me, but why would ever consider that? He's heartless, always has been and always will be. So you can preach as much as you like about Sherlock Holmes loving me, Mrs H, but the fact of the matter is, he can't love me, because he's incapable of loving anyone"
"I have been dealing with a lot of new emotions and feelings as of lately, in fact, they have all been attacking my mind one by one - almost, taking over my whole being" Sherlock sighed, holding onto the inevitable tears that were attempting to drive their way out "it's just, I can honestly say, I have never felt so much pain and hurt in my entire existence"
"It would seem that Jim's last wish to his brother was that he destroy Sherlock if he hadn't done so already and now he is back, it is only a matter of time before the game begins"
"Your father was an idiot, to say the least. He was absolutely incapable of concluding a detailed deduction, he would come up with the most ridiculous answers. He even doubted me for a while, can you believe it?"
"Because - I miss him, I miss the way he looks, the way he smells, the way he frowns at me all the time because I'm making a human error mistake or the way he would go on and on at me to stop putting severed heads inside the fridge. I miss him, Mycroft. I miss John"
"Fine, but just... You know, be safe, don't... just don't get yourselves killed" She spoke cautiously, stepping down from the stool and grabbing her bag from the floor.
"Oh, no, that was Molly's husband" John spoke casually, swinging his legs "he came to pick up Molly's coat, she left it here"
"Yes, you're not of the hook for keeping Rosie up until early hours, Sherlock" John said, creeping out from his hold. "She's not going to be able to concentrate at school unless she has a healthy eight hours sleep"
"Of course I trust you, you're the only person I'd ever trust with my life" John answered, lifting his head slightly.
"Yes. Answers. I want the truth, I want to know where you were, why it took you so long to come back, what made you listen to your brothers god awful advice for the first time in your bloody life? I want to know everything"
"What about him? As you can see, he's fine, he's the exact same person he was before" John said and it was true, he hadn't changed, even after all what was said - he was
"I'm going to leave the room, okay?" She said, mainly to Sherlock who looked at her with such pleading eyes "you need to do this, Sherlock. Or else you'll never know or understand"
"I'm sorry John" Mrs H spoke, alerting John to turn round and look at her "he's been home for months. I had been ringing and ringing but you just never answered my calls"
The words sent a shiver down Sherlock's spine, the words were like music to his ears, a sweet sympathy consisting only of
"No, god no - I told you Rosie, that's not what we do anymore" John frowned, shaking his head in frustration as he peered up at the time. Hoping just hoping, that they weren't too late.
"It has, hasn't it?" She sighed, sitting opposite. "It's been extremely quiet, in fact, it's been miserable. I've been on my own now for quite some time, the only person bloody making an effort to visit is Lestrade"
"Yes, and you love Italian" Sherlock retorted "Are we just naming food we love? Because, if so, you also love KFC but you know it's full of fat, grease and oil so stray away from it"
"Sherlock, are you nearly ready?" Mrs Hudson shouted, her voice ringing through the halls of 221B "John will be here soon, dear"
"Why on earth would you go to Greg Lestrade before going to me? Most of the time you hated the man! You insisted he was an idiot, nearly, one hundred percent of the time"
He took a deep breath, his fists clenching as he took the first step into the silent room. He looked up at Sherlock who slowly peered up at him, he dropped his phone onto his lap as he moved his hands into the pyramid shape and rested his index fingers on his lips. He was assessing the situation, John knew that.
"I know you're in detective mode, but that doesn't mean you can be an arse nor does it mean you can throw knives at my wall" John warned, his voice firm, he kept his stare until Sherlock's shoulders slumped, his eyes closing for a slight second as a breath escaped.
"Dad" Rosie shouted before shoving the door open, she stood in the door way looking at the two of them, her eyes furrowing for a second before finally a smile appeared on her face.
John just hummed an agreement, sitting back and folding the letter between his hands. He looked up at Mrs Hudson, her eyes were full of sadness when they saw him, he knew it was pity, pity that his best friend had just upped and left him with nothing but a simple fucking letter for a reason. He couldn't blamed her, he'd probably react the same.
"Don't think negatively. We are free, John - we are safe from harms way, we no longer have to worry about the next time one of us will be shot or thrown into a bonfire, we only have to think about this, us and Rosie. That's it. No more trouble, I can assure you"
"Okay great. Why don't you go and get changed out of your uniform and Sherlock and I will order some food?"
"She sounds so cool" She smiled softly but it soon faded, as she twiddled her thumbs on her lap "can I - can I ask one more thing?"
Sherlock cocked an eyebrow, a small smirk raising on his lips. And John had missed that, he had missed those lips, they could define every feeling Sherlock felt.
"- Mycroft is Sherlock's brother. He's - well, if you think Sherlock is bad then when you meet Mycroft you're in for a real shock"
Rosie sighed, stepping forward slightly so she was in Sherlock's view and her mouth opened wide as she gawked at him like he was some celebrity she had been obsessed with that week. John had never seen her so star-struck.
Sherlock's eyes peered up to look back at John and then, his hand gripped onto his cock, his eyes noting the way John arched his back, then his hand ran down, then up, his thumb slicking over the slit, admiring the way John shivered and then, his hand moved more rapidly, up, down, up, down.
But, he definitely didn't expect Sherlock to crouch down, sitting on the back of his ankles a mere two steps away from John, their eyes still locked as they always were, and John searched and searched for an answer but with all his might, he still found, nothing.
He halted in his stance, completely frozen as he felt Sherlock's hand lace its way down onto John's thigh and then he gripped it, pulling it back so John could no longer hide. And then, much to John's shock, he pressed over his groin, this time gripping it in his hands.
"Yes, well, he made it perfectly clear that he didn't want to be found" John's voice flurried with bitterness.
John let out a deep sigh, closing his eyes for a second, usually the indication that he was trying very hard not to lose his mind. "It's Greg. And he's not my best friend"
"You'll be surprised to know that Mary had seen it coming, she said something about always knowing" John attempted to explain "she... well, she was extremely fair, considering I abandoned her on the day of her dreams. I think she'll forgive me with time, I'm sure"
"I'm fine Greg, how are-" he was halted as he heard a shout from the hallway "can you hold on a second?"
"Careful, its hot" Sherlock warned, watching John's fingertips dance along the China attempting to stop it from burning.
John turned to Sherlock, a wash off relief practically waving over his face, his shoulders physically slumping from where he had been stiff notoriously since finding out about it.
"I-" he stopped, thinking about the situation, he had done everything in his power to prevent him from returning to that house at all costs. Usually offering to meet at restaurants and cafes rather than there. But he knew that it wasn't going to last forever and he most definitely couldn't hide forever "okay, I'll meet you there. What time?"
"I can assure you both, he will be coming back and he will be coming for you both - he, much like our original Moriarty knows that John is your weakness Sherlock and he will use him against you at any convenience"
"I just want to make sure, that's all" He sighed, pouring the milk into the two boiling hot cups of tea that he had freshly made, turning round to look at Sherlock who was sat quietly examining the decor of the kitchen "- I know that you get bored easily and really all we'll be doing is watching a film and eating Chinese food"
"Jesus, John" Sherlock sighed, his eyes rolling through the frustration "I don't know how else you want me to explain this?"
"Mind games are never the way, Sherlock. You must have known that I would have appreciated it more if you came to me"
"No worries, mate. Teenagers, hey? Did I hear you say she stole your credit card?" He asked, much more defensively than expected.
She sighed, looking between the pair and she was clueless. She thought for a second or two and although she didn't want to make a wrong decision in all of this, she trusted her gut.
Sherlock closed his eyes for a second, his fear of blood evident, as much as he attempted to hide it, John always noticed "right, shall we?".
"I know that. It's just, I like to know about it all. Not everyone has an army doctor as a dad, an ex-assassin as a mother and a sociopath for a godfather, you know? It's like something out of a fictional story - I want to know about it all"
And by the time lunch had finished, Sherlock still continued to listen, paying the bill, ushering John out of the door and they didn't even notice that they were walking openly side by side in a busy London street. John hadn't realised he had been speaking for that long.
"I'm sure we've already spoken about this. You are fully aware of how I feel about you, John Watson"
"I mourned my brother, I mourned him from the day he took his life - all because of your beloved Sherlock Holmes" He shouted, his eyes furrowed in rage.
"That's not-" John was interrupted by the front door opening before he could carry on with his denial but it didn't refrain from his shock, he knew that Mrs H has always assumed him and Sherlock was an item but he didn't think it went as far as Molly bloody Hopper and Greg.
"Jeremy Kyle" John huffed out a laugh, turning the sound up a few notches "it really is mind blowing that these people and their situations are real, I'm surprised we haven't had a few clients like this"
John closed his eyes, shivering at the contact, attempting to hide his obvious arousal from such innocent and unknowing moves, maybe it was the proximity or maybe it was just him.
"I can, actually" John laughed, pulling away and making room for Sherlock who was standing rather awkwardly in the door way. John turned to him and shot him a stern look, it took a few seconds until Sherlock gave in, rolling his eyes and removing his hands from his pockets.
"The offer... That you would spread me across the floor the next time you saw me, does that... you know, count?" Sherlock spoke quietly, his voice barely recognisable, vulnerable and desperate, a voice that John adored.
"Yes, that's literally all you have to do. There's no need to worry that your limbs will be falling off"
Sherlock frowned "I don't... I only figured this all out in the past year, I wouldn't know how to explain it without knowing fully or-"
"Why would I miss you?" Sherlock's voice came at nothing but a mere whisper, so soft and gentle "why can't I be away from you? Think John, please"
"Thirteen. You can imagine, it's the worst year of a teenagers life, hormones and all that rubbish. Painful, for her and I"
"Yes, thank you for that John. Can't say I don't agree with you, I rather like this edgy look. Shows that I may be older but boy do I get myself into some mad situations"
"What?" He stopped, his feet coming to a halt as the idiotic look of confusion spread across his features.
He pondered over the text, flickering his eyes from the phone and then to Rosie before letting out a deep sigh.
"But why? I forgave you. In fact, I forgave you sooner than I thought I would. Because, I realised it wasn't your fault"
"Shut up" John interrupted, still smiling as he stood up and walked towards him, wrapping his arms around his waist "They're perfect"
John had found himself visiting here, 221b Baker Street, every other day, sitting in his rightful throne that he had claimed as his own several years ago, just waiting for a miracle. But even he knew, that this time, it was different.
"Oh shit, wait, Mrs Hudson, is she okay? Jesus, is she alright? Was she there?" John ran frantic, suddenly sliding off Sherlock's lap to sit beside him "Mycroft, is she okay?"
Sherlock dropped his phone to his lap, his eyes scattering as he noticed the glares from the others.
John stayed still, sat in his chair, his eyes not leaving Sherlock's for even a second. He was still certain that this was all some sick dream or some sick practical joke that they were playing on him but as he concentrated more on his features he knew that this was far from it.
John was sat in his kitchen, Sherlock sat across from him, his laptop his only focus as his glasses sat at the bridge of his nose - he and Rosie were eating breakfast, watching him carefully, waiting for him to finally speak. But, as ever, when the game was on, Sherlock was difficult.
"That you two loved each other? You always spoke about him more than you did mum in your blogs. I'm just curious"
Jealous of the woman that was taking his best friend and pulling him from their antics? No. Jealous of the way John loved this woman and loved enough to marry and declare their love for eternity? Yes, a thousand times yes.
"Johnlock, it's yours and Sherlock's names. It's called a ship, dad. I swear, sometimes it's as though you're in the Stone Age"
"and you love him, yes? Not in the way you would have described many years ago, but differently now?"
"Yeah, it's fine" John said, reaching for the remote on the floor. He turned the tv on, ignoring the way Sherlock's fingertips traced patterns on his hip bone, keeping his mind focused on the numbers on the remote and not the shiver that ran down his spine.
"I don't understand-" John starts and stops, his head shaking vigrousaly before turning to Sherlock "why would someone do this?"
Sherlock let out a deep breath, his eyes scanning over the words over and over as he tried to consume a response, his fingers typed and deleted over and over.
"I think you underestimate the younger generation, John. If anything, she would likely be more accepting"
"It doesn't seem like you can fix any, you're an idiot. For once in your life, Mycroft Holmes, why don't you fix this? Give your brother a break" John spat once more, ending the call, throwing his phone at the wall opposite him.
Sherlock couldn't speak, he couldn't even part his lips to even attempt a reply, he was too busy concentrating on his breathing and his mind working double time to pursue some sort of answer to this ridiculous problem.
"That's children for you, they drive you insanely mad but they still love you and you still love them. It's weird really, isn't it?"
"And you can. But, there's a time and a place for bonding with him and tonight, it's me and him. We also need to find ourselves again, it's been a long time since Sherlock was in my life and I want to be able to get to know him all over again" John spoke sweetly, a small smile on his lips.
"I-" he starts and stops, gulping at the sight of John's plump lips only a mere inch away from his own and he could have moaned at the thought, but he knew better than that. He knew not to allow John to see his vulnerability.
He was well and truly bored and knackered. He didn't realise raising a teenager alone would be as difficult than it really was. It wasn't until she turned eleven that the problems began, she started secondary school and soon learnt how to answer back. And then there was boys, that was a subject she hated to talk about as much John really tried. It turns out being a single dad with a teenager daughter was a situation that would cause more than a few grey hairs.
"No, but how were you supposed to know? You were so bewildered by your brothers wish that you didn't think of the repercussions"
"Yeah, Rosie, shut up" John winked, scooting his chair closer to Sherlock just to wind her up "I'd be careful what you say or Sherlock won't let you read through his old case files"
"You arrived quickly enough" Mycroft greeted, looking between the two of them, his eyes softening towards John although he'd never admit that.
"He's as stupid as you. He has no idea how the human mind works, you're both aliens to the rest of us. If you wanted to know how to help me, then you should have came to me"
"When you say our, you mean you and Sherlock? Wow, Mrs Hudson you're right. They are secretly in love" Rosie giggled, grabbing her jacket from the back of her chair.
"Yeah" He replied, closing the door behind him and walking slowly, step by step towards Mrs Hudson's door. He didn't have time to open it himself, it swung open showing a very smiley and very fragile looking Mrs Hudson.
"We cannot be certain as of now, Doctor Watson" Mycroft spoke firmly. "We will know more after surgery"
John sighed, stretching his limbs as he stood up straight, his eyes were wary as he took small steps over towards Sherlock, he knew that at one point to even attempt to engage in any conversation with Sherlock when he was in that state was beyond dangerous - it would usually end in gun shots firing over his head, mugs thrown at him or enraged shouting however, this time, John didn't want a conversation, he wanted touch.
"Your mother - surprisingly, much like you, she liked me instantly. I met her not long after I had left John for a while, I returned not knowing what to expect and even though your dad wasn't quick to forgive, your mother convinced him instantly. I knew I liked her, even if she did shoot me and drug me" He stopped, realising what he was saying "- yes, but, even so, she was an extremely intellectual, brave and brilliant woman who loved both you and your dad very much. And she even told me she loved me as well, she was very much family to me"
"I've never known a girl to be on their phone so much, it's like she's attached to it, almost like a limb" Sherlock continued. "Should really set a time limit for her usage, John. She's only thirteen and completely reliant on it"
Sherlock frowned, shaking his head violently. He rolled his eyes, standing to his feet as he began to pace once again "I can assure you, I have not taken a thing on John's special day" the last three words coming out much more bitter than he anticipated.
"Dont start, Rosie - we've already spoke about this, haven't we? We're not sending you away because we want to, we're doing it because we have to" John attempted to explain.
"Very well" Sherlock shrugged, this time, he sat back on his heels, his hands gripping the waist of John's jeans and pulling them down in one swift movement and then his finger tips crawled beneath the waistline of his thin boxers, his eyes peered up at John, Sherlock took a deep breath and then pulled them down to reach the jeans.
"That's how he's going to do it, John - He wants to watch me slowly burn, into the ground much like his brothers memory - this is what he wants, I don't know how he will succeed in this, but he has a plan and his plan is a bonfire"
John nodded, it was still strange to be seeing him off as he went to work, a real job, where he actually had to do things he was asked, but for some reason, Sherlock enjoyed it.
"No, it's never bloody locked. It's my home too, Rosie" He laughed lightly, pushing the door open wide and standing to the side to let her in.
"oh" John mouthed, a slight smile appearing on his lips as he turned round in his chair. "What the bloody hell are you doing here?"
She turned to John, his mouth slightly open, his eyes wide and she deduced that was what she must have looked like when she first saw him.
Sherlock's eyes pierced down onto John's free member, noting the way John's eyes rolled back into his head and dear god, the only way John could explain the look in Sherlock's eyes was utter lust.
"Yes, well, that's why you boys love me" She spoke through a gentle smile as she stood up, leaving the tray on the table as she head for the door.
"Yes, well, you'll have to get used to it I'm afraid. I regret to inform you that we are both old now, John"
He reluctantly lifted his head and reached out, pressing the number 3 on his phone to reach reception "Send in the next one, lucy"
He smirked at that, remembering how Sherlock had woken both him and Mary up after he had watched Rosie for two hours and was losing his mind with every second, unable to talk to or understand what the baby wanted.
"Hello, brother mine. I do hope you've enjoyed your retirement - I however, have not. I have been attempting to call you for an hour now, both myself and our parents were worried for your life"
"her mother, you mean, Mary? Who was so bewildered that you both got married in the first place because she was certain you and I were going to elope the night before the wedding?"
He peered at the screen, he saw the name and let out a deep exhale of breath. He reached for it, swiping the screen to answer.
Sherlock stilled, suddenly taking a step back until his feet hit the back of the sofa and soon his body fell, falling onto his arse. No, definitely cannot do this, cannot cope, cannot -
Was Rosie going to get too excited? Was Sherlock going to get annoyed? Was he going to be rude? Would he try and impress her? Will they get along? Constant questions swirling round his head, it was enough to drive him insane.
"Bye" John shouted after her, hearing the door slam behind her. He sighed, turning to Sherlock who's eyes were still filled with worry from the night before, still extremely unsure.
"Not at all" John shook his head, leaning up to smile at him. He really was in love. Sherlock smiled back, reaching his arm around John's shoulders and pulling him into his chest until John's head rested against his side.
"I'm not sure" John shrugged, his eyes scattering across the room in hopes of ideas but he had nothing. He looked back at Sherlock, his eyes piercing down onto his own and John's eyes furrowed, he hadn't seen that look before.
He lifted the police tape for John, waiting until he had walked in before following. John head straight to the body, assessing the lifeless soul in front of him, it was routine now. John would assess time of death, cause and how it would have killed them and Sherlock would figure the finer details, the ones that would solve it.
Here he was, hunched over slightly, a crumpled excuse of a letter in his fingertips where it had been most of the time, his eyes scanning over the marksmanship of his best friends excuse for handwriting. He had examined every scribble, spelling mistake and spillage on the paper, trying to understand what Sherlock would have had to gone through to write this.
"Hey, hey, hey" John quickly cooed, clearing the space between them to rest his hand on Sherlock's thigh. "Woah, calm down, okay? It's only me, why are you so scared? You could tell me anything, nothing surprises me anymore"
"Yes, until I saw sense and when I realised you were so far up John Watsons arse there was simply no return for you"
I suppose, this is the end of this fic. Sherlock and John have to come to terms of their new found relationship and life, John is scared, sherlock is worse and Rosie, can't wait for them to get out of the house.
John could feel the shivers that ran down his back, his eyes gazing at the man in front of him - visibly younger than Moriarty, his hair still the same jet black, his eyes though, a piercing witch-like green and a beard much like Mycroft's when they decided to be pirates for the day, less ginger, more natural, brown. He was dressed down, made a change from the tailored suits, he was dressed in a pair of jeans and a checked shirt much like one that John had at home, very similar in fact. He looked - normal. Much beyond expectations.
Sherlock confidently reached out, grabbing John's hand in his own and laced their fingers together, wresting their hands on his lap. John didn't say anything, he simply looked up at him, Sherlock didn't even blink, he kept his eyes focused on the drivers head in front of him. And John simply smiled, looking down at their hands and stayed like that the rest of the way.
"My intention was never to hurt you. That was noted in that letter and as for the rest of my life, I intend to stick by that. I'm forever in your debt for the way I have treated you, I will always be sorry for the way I left and the years I missed. However, I am Sherlock Holmes, I do stupid things because frankly, I am incapable of human thought processes and that's always who I will be. And I do not ask for your forgiveness, as I do not expect it. However, I do hope that you can work on a way to allow me to continue being your friend even through the actions I have taken"
"You were amazing" Sherlock spoke blatantly, his voice still bewildered as he looked at John with nothing other than fondness "I don't know how you did that, but you did"
Sherlock stiffened, his whole body on lock down and then all you could hear in the room was his uncontrollable breathing, it was hard and heavy, his chest practically convulsing.
"You also left your god-daughter" He spoke softly, tears slowly rolling down his cheeks as he thought about all the lost memories that Rosie missed out on with her Godfather "twelve fucking years, Jesus Christ Sherlock, who does that? Why would someone do that?"
adores you, I think that maybe her dad going from straight, once married to a woman to suddenly with a man will be confusing in some way or another"
John nodded, taking in the scene around him, he really was very lucky to have the people he did have in his life. He was thankful for Sherlock returning, even if it was twelve years too late, he was thankful for right now, having two of the most important people in his life, alive and well.
John pondered over the request, wondering if he was stable enough to talk to Sherlock about this in person, whether he was brave enough, after all, if he wasn't stable around Sherlock then how the hell did he expect Rosie to react.
"I can't have this conversation with you" John rolled his eyes "you said no more games! Why are you acting as though I can read your mind or feel your emotions?"
Not surprising - It was for the police, after his many years service helping, he was offered the job without an interview. And even though he found most of his peers intolerable, he was enjoying it, very much so - made a change from fleeing for their lives off high buildings, being thrown into fires and having their house blew up. It was much calmer this side of the law.
"But I did return" Sherlock inched a step forward, his voice soft and low "I'm here now, I came back to see you John, no one else"
"You nicked this idea from some cheesy Twitter account?" John stifled in a laugh, reaching his hand up to cover his mouth "you're adorable"
"Why didn't you stop him?" Craig finally stopped and asked, his arms falling to his sides almost in defeat.
"You didn't call. You didn't text. You didn't write. You did nothing. You just left me in the dark, do you realise how fucking shitty that is? My best friend fucks off for years and doesn't even send a bloody post card!"
"It's not too late at all" Sherlock shook his head, he couldn't find the ability to find anything even remotely clever to say, he was blank in the mind and that was something he had never felt.
"Maybe we should" Sherlock suggested to John who simply watched and smiled, he couldn't believe how lucky he was.
"Were you not aware of my presence when our devil sister marked revenge? Or were you to bewildered by my brothers magnificence to even notice?" Mycroft fired back, a knowing look in his eyes as he sat on the stool opposite.
"Of course. Don't ever doubt your fathers love for you - you're his world, always" He confirmed, his eyes still furrowed as he looked at her with complete compassion.
"No yoga, just me, being away made me realise a few things. Much to my brothers annoyance, he too believes that it's time for me to stop"
The only problem was, since their declarations, since they finally admitted how they felt, they hadn't discussed it since. Sherlock had gone straight back into detective mode the day after, as if the whole episode never happened.
But he was nervous, bloody nervous and he had no idea why. It was like he was a teenager again about to go on his first ever date, it practically was, had hadn't been with anyone since Mary and had never had the urge to try with anyone else - so really, this was his first date all over again.
Would that be a good thing? Or not? She couldn't figure it out at this point - she was as baffled as Sherlock, that was certain.
"It's obvious - the man is an extremist, totally and utterly fantasies about the possibilities of damage that fire can cause, utterly obsessed. He's obsessed with me, obsessed with his brothers dying wish except he's not as clever, no where near as smart, he is the younger brother - the child that didn't quite live up to his brothers intelligence and now he's fighting for some sort of bloody pride from this, he's a sadistic, disgusting excuse for a man - not eve a man, he's a boy"
"You looked after my dad, after he lost mum. I know you tried to help and I know he loves you, you make him happy and I'm so glad you're back he's been so happy since you came back, it's like he's finally at peace"
"None at all" Sherlock shook his head "I have said repeatedly that I was done. And I stand by word, through and through - the police worked without me for many years, they can do it again now. They don't need me anymore"
"Of course, if you don't like them I can return them immediately and replace them with whatever your heart desires. I just-"
"Shit. When did we get here?" John froze, looking up at 221B, his eyes furrowed as he looked between the house and the distance they had walked.
"Do you? Do you really? Because you didn't seem to care much all those years ag- wait, was bloody Lestrade involved in this as well? Jesus fucking Christ, did everyone know about this but me?"
"Jesus, Sherlock" John gasped, unable to move as he then felt his hand begin to rub up and down on his clothed cock.
"Oh" Sherlock's lips tightened into a thin line, his eyebrows furrowing like they always did when he thought hard "Mike Stamford. I see. He's nice, although I'm not sure how he would cope with-"
He could hear Sherlock rummaging around in his room, his steps banging against the floor - John exhaled a deep breath as the door to his bed room swung open and he was readying himself for the inevitable awkward situation.
Sherlock nodded, taking a few steps out of the door for John to step out. He locked the door and they both head for the taxi that Sherlock had came in, sitting closely together in the backseat.
"You assume I'm living in my brothers shadow, as if that would be upsetting - however, that's exactly what you've been doing for years, isn't it? Living under the shadow of the great Sherlcok Holmes"
Rosie was the first to come downstairs, her eyes drooping from tiredness, the dark circles evident around them and all she did was yawn and walk past her dad to grab the milk from the fridge.
"Look, I know that you're just trying to help. But, if Sherlock really and I mean really needed me, he would be here. He wouldn't be half way across the sodding world on some stupid assignment he most likely begged his brother for. He'd be here, Mrs H, right here"
His hangs flung out in front of him, holding onto the sides of Sherlock's head and only a mere seconds later, his lips had crashed onto his. The feeling was beyond anything he had felt before, a feeling of relief, hope, care and victory all at once. It was as if he had longed for this moment for so long without actually knowing it, to begin Sherlock's body had frozen in spot, like the gesture had been nothing he had hoped for but within seconds, Sherlock lips moulded with John's as they both stood to their feet, his arms wrapped around John's waist, he pulled them together, their chest crashing against each other with nothing but desperation and need.
It was silent for a moment, John simply watching Sherlock with utter admiration as he focused on nothing but the movie that was playing - the only one he had focused on all evening, for the matter.
He spent the next few hours doing nothing, he had used up as much time as he could to just sit on the sofa and be as lazy as possible, it was a rare occasion that he would get a day to himself, in fact, it was the first day he'd managed to get off work for months.
He was a mere few steps from him, his heart racing, Sherlock still staring at the wall - that was until John's smaller hands snaked around onto his waist, his finger tips brushing the material of his shirt until they had reached around to meet together in front of his chest, his fingers lacing through one another to hold him in a tight grip - he could feel Sherlock stiffen in his arms, yet he stayed, for a minute or two until Sherlock softened around him and soon, a deep breathe escaped him.
"They always go for Molly, she's vulnerable, very easy persuaded" Sherlock attempted to explain, his feet pacing back and forth "Moriarty, the original, he knew of Molly, of her vulnerability and attacked that, attaching to her as a means to get to me, yes?"
"The whole thing, it was so different - usually, you would be grilling them until they are ready to rip your limbs off one by one, but you didn't, you didn't do anything. Why is that?"
Rosie smiled, following her dad up the famous stairs that he had written about so often, admiring the holes along the wall, the scuffs on the stair case and finding comfort in the fact this was where her dad was happiest.
"No, well, I didn't expect it to last long. You know how journalists and paparazzi are, they're like leeches, they probably stuck to us the moment they saw you near Baker Street and put one and one together"
"I love him beyond words can explain" John nodded "- your brother is wonderful and I hope I can spend the rest of my life by his side, even if it is by fighting psychopaths who want to kill him, any time spent with him is a blessing"
"What in hell have you two bloody boys done to that kitchen?" Mrs Hudson shouted, waving her hands around as she walked towards them both.
He sighed, taking the keys out of ignition and unbuckling his seat belt, he opened his door stepping out onto the familiar street. Breathing in the London air, so familiar but so foreign, it was an over-whelming feeling.
"That was literally not even half an hour ago" John frowned. "How on earth have you managed to pick on that and get here in that time?"
"No, but it's a case" Sherlock retorted, grabbing his coat from the side of John's chair. "Come along, John"
"Say the words, Sherlock" John whispered, now a mere few inches away from him like before. "Say you want more"
"Bloody hell, what could possibly be wrong with you now?" he sighed, leaning against the door frame, physically and emotionally exhausted.
"It turns out that people had noticed Sherlock a few months back, not just today, a few people that you most definitely would not want to know" Greg explained "turns out that even a twelve year break can't discourage the enemies you've made, Sherlock"
"No, I didn't. I couldn't bare to let it go to anyone else, if I'm honest" She said, stirring the milk into the tea cups "it felt wrong, you know? I couldn't bare to live with anyone else"
"On the day of John's wedding? Surprisingly not. What I mean, is why on earth have you let this go on for this long" She said firmly, crossing her arms over her chest as she leant back against the sofa.
"But-" John's words escaped him, he sat back in a daze "that doesn't make any sense. You spent most of your time preaching that normal is boring, what has this bloody trip done to you? Did you seek out yoga? Did it cleanse your mind?"
He hadn't stepped foot inside for a very long time, eventually giving up on sitting and waiting for him after many years, he almost felt a sense of anxiety, he knew that the moment he walked back in, it would all start again. And that was extremely daunting, but yet, he followed Sherlock in.
John interrupted "you don't. Or you wouldn't have left. I'm old now Sherlock, twelve years really is a long time. I'm too old for games and silly deductions, I just want you to realise what I'm saying and what I am saying is that you made a wrong choice"
He waited until he was certain Mrs Hudson had left and then, slowly and cautiously, he lifted his body, his back shifting until it hit the headrest. His eyes beamed up to look at the man in front of him, his suit that was once ironed and worn to perfection now only a slightly open white shirt, the sleeves rolled up to his elbows and his smart trousers. His once perfectly styled hair now falling over his forehead as though he had been running his fingers through them notoriously, Sherlock noted his breathing, unsteady - had he been running?
"I think it's time for bed, Rosie" John stated, now only one space away from Sherlock. "It's already half ten and you have school"
"Which pair?" He asked, looking down at her feet that were covered by a pair of socks which, if he wasn't wrong, were covered in marijuana plants "Jesus, Rosie, what on earth is on your socks?"
"you've actually deduced this?" John asked, turning to look at Sherlock "I told you the game was on in a humourus sense, I didn't think you'd take it so seriously"
"Frustrated?" Sherlock asked, tilting his head to the side slightly, his tear stained cheeks slightly burning from the obsessive crying.
"Get off" Sherlock said, reaching his arm up to swat him away. He had been laying down with his head on John's torso for the past ten minutes, dressed in a pair of John's over sized joggers and a baggy sweater, his curly locks flat against his head, still slightly wet - he looked absolutely beautiful.
"Yes, Molly did tell me - she did go on about you two though, boring really" He said, tracing his finger tips across the desk opposite them, his eyes still focused on Sherlock "All this talk about how lovely it was to see you two together again, how wonderful it is that you're finally giving love a chance - so stupid, so boring"
"Ah. I should have known this would be a topic of conversation, shouldn't I? How did I not deduce this?"
"I can't speak for later, but I'm pretty sure I'll be hungry for something else" Sherlock slyly side, wrapping an arm around John again.
"Jesus Christ dad, you have to let me meet him eventually I mean come on-" she began to ramble again, this time John zoned out, he slid his phone open and smiled slightly as he began to read the text displayed on his screen.
"I have waited, dreamed, of this day Sherlock. Everyone has always been right, I have always been hopelessly in love with you, Sherlock Holmes" John whispered, his hot breath against Sherlock's lips "so, if you would be so kind. I would very much like to kiss you"
"It's a sad one, get ready to cry" John grinned up at him, a look of utter happiness across his face.
"I haven't got time for lies, Mrs Hudson. What is really going on here? Jesus... don't tell me he's high today? Not today"
"The real world? What makes you say it like that?" she was quick to judge, the question coming out much harsher.
And he noticed Sherlock's smirk as he read the text, John's stomach turned, a knot expanding as it prepared it's decend into explosion.
Someone asked me how I get in the mind-set when I'm writing and honestly, I have to play Ed Sheeran on repeat and focus on nothing but my laptop screen haha. So, if you're considering writing, I highly recommend listening to Divide over and over again.
Sherlock let out a sigh, a groan escaping his lips as he let his head fall to his hands and he mumbled "Oh, John. Fuck, I'm sorry"
"Wow" John laughed, smiling up at Sherlock who looked so uncomfortable in the situation. Never did he believe he would see the day Sherlock Holmes would surprise him at work with flowers and alcohol.
"So, you do? Always had a thing for your best friend, well, that's definitely something for the blog. 'Sherlock Holmes reveals he has always fancied his best friend' "
"Please don't tell me you boys are arguing again" Mrs Hudson rolled her eyes as she stood in the doorway looking at the two men standing nearly against each other in a puddle of hot mess and breathing problems. Completely unaware "you have no time for it, I'm afraid. You have a visitor"
"Well, I might suggest that things are going slightly better than last time I disappeared. You haven't punched nor head-butted me"
"Very. Although, after you left I spent years coming back" John admitted, leaning his arms on the armrests with a gentle sigh.
"You don't have to kill Sherlock" John cut in "we don't have to do any of this, you could live the life that your brother always dreamed of but was incapable of doing - Molly is at home, most likely waiting for your return, waiting to spend the last hour of your anniversary together. She wants you with her and you can do that, but if you harm either Sherlock or myself in any way then you're going to lose that freedom, the police will walk in here and either arrest or shoot you and you will leave Molly to mourn you like you mourned your own brother"
"We have to deal with something" Sherlock spoke up, standing beside her with a short smile "don't worry - your dad will be back by the time your home from school tomorrow"
He looked down at the floor, the space now clear with only a mount of cushions piled against each other, one after the other, candles lit around it, the scent of lavender lifting through the room with every inhale. His eyes scanned the scene, seeing the bottle of wine beside it and two glasses. And then stood behind it with his hands twiddling in front of him and his eyes soft was no one other than Sherlock Holmes. Dressed in an oversized sweater with the sleeves clasped in the palm of his hand and it slightly hanging around his thighs and those jeans he loved so dearly.
After a lot of Chinese food, listening to Rosie slag off her best friends about how they're all a bunch of bitches and being forced to watch Family Guy, John had finally managed to get into bed at eleven. Wrapped up in duvet, his head on his pillow and he couldn't believe the day he had been subjected too. He didn't know whether to cry or laugh, he was completely bewildered by it all. He lay there silently, looking up at the ceiling for ages until he had remembered his phone going off earlier on in the night when Rosie had been ranting, he couldn't check it because she had called him a rude dad and that she would contact social services for neglect if he looked at his phone.
"I suppose I may have realised that I was feeling some sort of strange and unwanted human emotion six months after we met, however I did not know what it was nor did I explore it. It wasn't until I realised I had to fake my own death that I may have began to explore it and realise what it really was" Sherlock explained, cautiously, his voice much more fragile.
"No, no, I don't. You see, I know you better than anyone else" John states, leaning forward once again "you have never let anyone in as much as you have me, I know the things that make you tick, the behaviour that irritates and annoys you, I know everything Sherlock. And I know that you hate being normal"
"Sherlock, you're going to have to tell me, I can't read your bloody mind" John pushed, his hands falling to his side.
"Tedious. Mr Bowler was an absolute idiot, once again. Accused me of cheating on my test when in fact, I was the one who finished the test first" She wailed, walking past her dad and into kitchen, now dressed in her pyjamas "He really does have a cheek, doesn't he?"
"Don't forget to put your clothes in the wash basket, that doesn't mean your floor" he called after her, a small smile on his lips as he turned to look at Sherlock who's expression was nothing more than fond.
"You're going to have to deal with this sooner or later, Sherlock. The game will begin soon and you will have to react, its in your nature. I agreed to allow you back into London to see Mr Watson but I didn't say you wouldn't deal with consequences of your return"
"This is it" Sherlock told the driver, using his free hand to leave a £20 note in the dash. He opened the door with the same hand, keeping his and John's hands still locked as he helped him out of the taxi, closing the door behind him.
He agreed, he dealt with it all, he dealt with the proximity he had to spend around both John and Mary, he dealt with wedding guests, catering, venues and dressage - every part of it, not because he wanted to but because John asked him and he would do anything for him.
They stayed like that, mouths and tongues moulding like lost limbs, as though they had been forced to part and found each other again. And John really didn't want to pull away, honestly, he didn't, he was in an air field, explosions and fireworks setting off around him in such serenity and fear that if he did, that would be the last time. But he was breathless, he needed to.
"You mean, to meet the man who has solved hundreds upon hundreds of crimes? The man who can tell you your life story just from looking at you? And the man who was my dads best and most dearest friend for so long? What do you think?"
He sighed, walking away from the stairs and into the kitchen. He perked himself on the stool beside the counter, pulling the paper towards him, he licked the tip of his fingers, turning the page. It was the same old news every day, boring politics, boring football and most of all, boring and uninteresting crimes. Where had all the interesting criminals gone?
"Oh? What did you expect?" Sherlock asked, cautiously, fighting with all his might not to just grab John and hide him behind him.
"No, that's not the point. It wouldn't have worked, you needed to find Mary and you needed everything that happened - we both did. No other man in his forty's could tell the story of their life like ours, John Watson. And through the pain, loss and extreme suffering we have managed to come out - alive and well"
"He has not been seen since, however an array of deaths due to fire have been noted in the city of London, over 33 deaths due to house fires in the last four months which relates to our situation back at Baker Street and why our beloved Mrs Hudson is currently suffering in a hospital bed"
Mycroft rolled his eyes, standing to his feet attempting not to show any sort of affection towards his brother and his new found love. "You're very aware of what's to come Sherlock, I hope that the two of you won't become to distracted when the game is at hand"
"God, yes" John nodded, a yawn escaping his lips "looks like we'll have to wait, Greg, nothing is happening tonight"
"I'm saying. You're human Sherlock. You miss the man you care for dearly and finally, after years and years, your heart is finally defeating that brain of yours and it's time to come back down to earth"
And he watched the clock until it struck seven and on cue, the door knocked. He was quick to shove his wallet into his back pocket and practically skip to the door, only halting to wonder how on earth Sherlock knew where he lived.
"Not today, love - I've gone without for a while, I can wait a few more days until you've finally cracked this bloody case" John smiled fondly, rolling to the side so he could lay beside Sherlock, his hand reaching out to lace his fingers through Sherlock's.
His eyes were hooked on him, noting his smart casual look, a shirt and trousers, only a few buttons left undone at the top, it suited him. But then again, he was used to seeing him like this. But just not at this age, maturity really did suit him.
The rest of the lunch was calm, there wasn't much conversation from Sherlock's side, it was strange to be in his company and not be over powered by him. He sat back, listening to John go on about how difficult it was raising Rosie, listening to the stories and memories that he had missed whilst away and he could see Sherlock taking it all in, bit by bit.
"But he didn't - not because of you, not because of me, not because of anybody. But because he chose to do so. He was trapped inside his own tortuous mind"
"I was going to. When I returned the last time, I came back to tell you how I felt but when I got there you were with Mary and I couldn't allow myself to jeopardise that, not at all"
"- I understand you find this difficult and I know how stressful it is for you, however, I am not just anybody, I am me,
"Sherlock" John reached out, attempting to grab Sherlock's hand as he stood up but Sherlock quickly swiped his hand away.
"Says you? The man who would forgive him no matter what he done. He died for two years and you pretended you were angry for a bit and then went off back up his arse again" Mary shot back, John could still note the humour in her voice.
"And they just let him?" John asked, baffled "why on earth did they not just fucking shoot him there and then?"
" John spoke carefully, his free hand reaching up to cradle Sherlock's cheek, his thumb stroking in circles. "Don't let them get away with this"
He didn't know what to do, he however, did not expect to find himself calling the person he was. Probably not the best idea.
"Wouldn't you?" John pushed, pushing himself up from the arm of the chair taking only a few steps towards him "if you would like me to, then I will, but only if you want me to"
"Even so. Nobody would ever compare to my Sherlock and Watson" she spoke, turning round with a soft smile, her hands shaking ever so slightly as she walked to place the tray of tea on the dining table.
John rolled his eyes, groaning as he stood up, ignoring the ache in his ever growing old knees, he definitely was getting too old for this. He turned round to face Sherlock, who threw his jacket and him and ran off down the stairs. "Yeah, thanks" He muttered, dragging himself to follow as he shoved his coat on.
And Sherlock's hand was much bigger, covering them both, his hand working at such a speed that John was unravelling beneath him. Flustered, sweating and losing himself.
"So, how long does he usually sit like this?" Rosie asked, cocking her eyebrow as she meant towards her dad.
And John nodded, he said his goodbyes and his I love you and he did exactly that. His steps were slower this time as he walked down the stairs, he knew what he was about to place himself into and he knew it could go two ways. But he also knew he needed to do this and it needed to be now.
And just as John was about to continue what they had started, they heard the door handle go from behind them and instantly turned to the now opened door.
"She's okay" John spoke through a heavy breath, his face falling into his hands. "God, she scared me half to death"
Mrs Hudson stood to the side, allowing both Mycroft and Lestrade to walk in beside her. Mycroft looked stern, as ever his eyes showing no concern for what was going on. Whereas Lestrade had a look of amusement plastered all over his face, his smile wide as he glanced between the two of them and it was clear he knew. In fact, John could sense that he knew, so he simply leaned back onto the arm of the chair, crossed his arms and kept his head down. Not quite ready for whatever he may say next.
"He always described you as arrogant and hostile, you're beyond both of them. I'm really glad I am able to have you in my life" Rosie admitted, a single tear falling down her cheek.
Sherlock nodded, finally putting his phone into his pocket as he hailed for a taxi, his arm waving in the air in front of the black cab approaching them.
"Ah, bullet wound straight through the skull, rapture in the brain, instant death - around, two hours ago? No, an hour and forty five minutes ago. The bullet would have been shot from..." he trailed off, turning around to look at the room "Behind the window at the back fire exit door, there's shattered glass on the floor - someone with a skilled hand, obviously"
And Sherlock had decided that enough was enough, he reached his arm out, his hand out towards John to take ahold of, he watched his eyes take in the situation before he finally, cautiously, placed his hand in his. It took only a few seconds for Sherlock to pull John onto his lap, he could feel John's thick thighs around his legs and he was certain that this was an undiscovered feeling, no-one would possibly understand the feeling of sensation that burst through his body at that moment.
"God" Sherlock's breath hitched as he caught glance of his doctor, noting the scars across his chest and shoulder, noting the struggle that this beautiful man had dealt with and he was so in love "You're fucking beautiful"
"Ah, Mr Watson, day dreaming, are we?" Mycroft approached him, his walking stick in hand as he gave John the most devilish smile.
She flickered her eyes between the two boys once more and then, she left, closing the door behind her and seating herself on the top step. This was extremely more difficult than her time spent running a drug cartel, that was certain.
"Sherlock, we're all over the news" he spoke directly to him this time, his eyes wide as they watched Sherlock just shrug effortlessly. He rolled his eyes, turning his attention back on to Rosie "okay, it's fine, just concentrate on school and I'll see you later"
"Now, if you don't mind" Sherlock choked out, reaching the back of his hand to wipe the tears from below his eyes "I would like to retreat back to my room and forget this happened"
"Things aren't that easy" John admitted, sighing into his hands as his head fell. He leant up, his chin resting on the palm of his hands, his eyes still gazed on Sherlock's.
Mrs Hudson stared at him, her eyes wide as he watched the single tear roll down John's cheek as he let the bundle of words flood from him like an over-due volcano explosion, everything he had thought about for so long just exploding all at once. And John even shocked himself, he didn't know he was capable of saying. As his breath steadied, his eyes were able to find Mrs Hudson, her eyes teary and flicking between John and the door-way. He had been so indulged with anger that he had forgotten the key part that the front door had opened behind him and he knew he most likely made a fool out of himself in front of Greg.
But, he had Rosie out of his mind as he drove towards central London, he knew that the school had to deal with her for the next few hours and she was their problem. It's not that he didn't love his daughter, of course he did, more than anything in the world, he was just tired. And the idea of seeing Mrs Hudson was becoming more and more of an ideal thought, to escape his own little reality for a bit to venture back into his past. Maybe he could pretend he was still The John Watson that people remembered him for.
"Oh, am I? What were you expecting, Sherlock? You have allowed this friendship of yours with John to remain a friendship for years, you have never allowed yourself to reveal the feelings you have and now he's getting married and you, well, you are panicking - because, finally, you're realising that it's all over"
John sighed, listening to his daughter whine and whine on the phone to him as he drove into London. He knew this was going to happen the moment he mentioned meeting another old friend for lunch. She would try and try with all her might to get out of school and back home so she could meet whoever it was. But he wasn't haven't any of it, not today.
"Really?" John laughed, looking at Mrs Hudson who had a permanent smile across her face "Sure, yeah, why not. Send Molly our love"
"how can you be so sure?" John asked, his voice appearing as nothing but a faint whisper, all that was needed from the proximity between the two "- Sherlock, you've never been with anyone else. How do you know that this isn't just a fling? Something in your head that's telling you that it's right? You'll get bored, you'll move on and find a new experiment"
"My apologies, not very gentlemen-like, is it?" Sherlock grinned, his eyes still dazed as they took in every part of the man in front of him.
John cocked an eyebrow, crossing his arms over his chest, he didn't believe that, not in the slightest. He knew that man and he knew that a simple cold could never affect him like this.
Sherlock let out a sigh, closing his eyes trying to rid of the memory. John just nodded, listening carefully, taking in the life of Moriarty. His killing of somebody wasn't a shock, but the idea that he was actually a human being at some point, really was. There was a life behind the demon.
"You're being extremely quiet" She noted, turning onto her side with her head against the head rest. "It's unlike you"
As he turned down the street, his heart sank, house by house as he grew nearer he could feel the nerves kick in. He didn't know why, after all, this was once his home. For so many years of his life. And as he parked outside, his eyes gazed up at the tall Victorian house, the numbers 221B standing out like a sore thumb.
"Check my wallet" John said, waving over to the living room. He left her to it, walking back into the kitchen "Sorry Greg"
It was one month post-wedding drama, things had partially gone back to normal since. Mary had somehow managed to forgive John quite quickly, considering he fled from their wedding at the alter to tell his best friend he loved him. John was currently sitting at the desk in Baker Street, the newspaper spread out as he read about his and Sherlock's latest discovery.
"No, but I'm aware through deductions that the complex of a relationship between yourself and I around twenty years ago would not have been compatible. We would have ruined everything we have now and that is a thought I do not wish to think about, at all" Sherlock quickly fired back, pouring all of his thoughts out at once. "You see, although we both could agree I could have admitted this all sooner - to be the person I am, the person you need, I had to deal with all of that to get here. Without it, this wouldn't be a possibility at all and you know it"
Sherlock sighed, his shoulders slumping, he most definitely hated this sort of interaction "John, I care for you very much. And I enjoyed what happened the other day, very much. And I hope, you feel the same"
"Yes, mum and dad tried all of the doctors, they eventually assessed him and he had all sorts of mental health issues, none his fault, they had been building up in him for years and then all at once they hit him - the books, they opened something in his mind that opened the demons and he refused any help, mum tried and tried to get him to take medication but it was useless. He couldn't be helped, he was so lost"
John grinned and before Sherlock could say much more, John's lips found his, in a sweet, hot, firework explosion. Full of passion, want and need, it was as though John needed to see what Sherlock tasted like, like he had dreamt of this moment a thousand times and as the initial shock had worn down, Sherlock found his lips moulding around John's like they belonged there.
Sherlock pulled back, grabbing his last slice of toast from the plate and biting into it. Waving as he left the kitchen, John shook his head, turning to the kettle once more when he heard Sherlock call out.
"Please, Sherlock, please don't tell me you've taken something... not today, not on John's special day" She pleaded, her eyes concerned.
"Yeah" He shrugged "kind of, I have the chance to take the day off tomorrow though if I want, so I have a long weekend off really"
The name sent shivers down the spines of everyone in that room, Moriarty was a name that most definitely hadn't been mentioned in all that time. It was like a wave of fear had affected them all, but most of all, John, his eyes were wide, his confusion obvious but nonetheless, he turned to Sherlock for an answer but it was clear not even he, knew what was happening.
He nodded a short goodbye, his hurried steps taking him out to the front of the building where Sherlock was stood quietly, his phone in hand as he typed away viciously.
That name hadn't been heard in a long time, the name was foreign to him, he had spent so much of his time trying to forget him and the memories that he had wiped him from his thoughts completely. He spent months, years, even, just waiting and waiting for him to come back like Mrs H said he would but after five years he finally decided enough was enough and that's when he decided to give up. He should have known he would be mentioned.
