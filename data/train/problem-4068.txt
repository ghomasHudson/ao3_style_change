"Dean!" Sam nearly yelled, no doubt afraid that Dean had drank until he was either dead or passed out. "Dean?!"
Images of Cas's dark hair, pink lips that always looked chapped, and stormy eyes filled Dean's mind. He wanted to see that son of a bitch again so badly it hurt; now his hesitance had been replaced by eagerness. Beer was the furthest thing from his mind for once. "I know, but I really want to see that feathery asshole again," Dean said honestly.
"I am. I miss him too," Jack admitted, looking down sadly but trying to hide it. Now there was yet another person whose feelings Dean had neglected. And Jack had been Cas's kid, practically. Dean mentally kicked himself.
"I'm coming in through your door." Dean could already hear Cas's footsteps as they got closer. He hung up the phone when the footsteps stopped in front of his room. Even before the first knock, he'd opened the door. "Hello, Dean."
"I was right," Cas said to himself. "It looks perfect on you." He looked at Dean, whose eyes were locked onto their hands touching and the ring he now wore. "Thank you for accepting it, Dean."
After it happened, Sam and Jack returned to the bunker and found Dean on the floor in the exact same position he'd been in when Cas left. His phone was lit up with unread texts and missed calls from Sam, but not a single one of either of the two had been acknowledged. Sam told Dean later that night that he'd been worried and angry with him, but that Dean didn't deserve to be scolded or yelled at after all he'd witnessed and been told. Sam was what Dean tried to focus on now, not the long-gone angel with blue eyes who loved him.
Well fuck. What was Dean supposed to say to that? He found himself opening and closing his mouth with nothing coming out. He took a step back, hoping to put more room between himself and Cas. Not much, but just enough to think clearly. He'd had no idea how to talk to Cas when the guy was close enough for Dean to see every detail of his face and commit it to memory.
When he came back a minute later he was holding two beers and a sandwich on a plate. "I got hungry," he explained through a bite of the sandwich, not even waiting to sit down before he started eating. "Now talk. I'm not leaving until you do," he said in a serious voice before laughing. "But seriously, there's something bugging you, Cas."
That was the last thing he said before falling asleep. The floor was uncomfortable as all hell, but Dean wouldn't have changed a thing.
Cas had once told him that angels could sense longing. Maybe it was the fact that Dean was getting more and more desperate to see him and he could tell, but he actually texted back this time.
He could hear Cas sighing into the phone. "The slushy machine broke after I tried using it, Dean. I could not fix it."
Sam said the words according to the book, and then it happened. Black goo-like liquid opened like a black hole next to Dean and Jack, following Jack's grace like a stalker following their victim. It took shape steadily in wet phases, and the end result was an oval of nothingness waiting to welcome the nephilim and the hunter along for the ride.
"What the- hey!" Dean almost yelled, annoyed. "Freakin' angels," he said quietly when Cas left him alone again. "I'm calm. I'm fine, damn it. I don't need him anyway," he added, but it was all a lie, especially the last part. Dean did need Cas, and the angel had to know it.
Dean drew in a sharp breath and lifted the shirt away from Cas's skin. There were still some signs that Cas had been stabbed with the lance, but the thick black lines were gone and there was no bleeding.
Without thinking, Dean lowered his head so that their foreheads touched. "I'm all yours, Cas," he whispered. "Always was, really."
Cas's shoes left footprints in the snow and the muddy ground underneath. It was such a simple thing, really, to look behind you and see your own markings in the earth. Humans did it all the time with no idea of how amazing it truly was.
Dean didn't feel it at first. It was only after Jack asked if he'd heard something that the hunter realized there was, in fact, something headed their way. It gradually took shape the closer it got; it was oddly humanlike. Blackness molded together like pieces of clay.
"You weren't meant to stay for a long time. You were a throwaway character, Cas," Dean went on. "But I got attached, and he rewrote the book."
If Cas ever realized that Dean had lost all hope... just the thought of how Cas would react was enough to kick his ass into high gear.
Suddenly, Cas's arms wrapped around Dean in a brief but affectionate embrace. "I promise to love you forever, Dean," and there was a ring sliding onto his finger. It felt perfect and right against Dean's skin.
He should have come clean, but lied instead. "The very same thing. I've wanted you for a long time, Dean." It was still the truth.
Walking around a little more, Dean filled all of his thoughts. He saw him and his eyes, his wonderful green eyes, in every leaf and every blade of grass. If Dean wasn't with Sam and Jack, working, he'd head back to the bunker right now and surprise him with the ring. Dean had given Cas more than he realized, and he really did deserve something in return.
Dean instantly hated it. Cas deserved better, and damn if Dean wouldn't give that to him or die trying. "Well, what the hell happens now, kid?" Dean asked. "We made it, now what?"
But Cas wasn't about to give up. With all the strength he could muster up, he cried out into the blackness; one word: "Dean!"
"You're welcome." Dean, no longer in much of a joking mood, repressed a soft smile at the sight of Cas's, turning his head away so he wouldn't be tempted by those lips and softening blue eyes set attentively on him. "I'm gonna order some food. If you want to stay for a bit, 't's cool with me."
"I'm not losing you like this, and I don't care what you say." Dean carefully wrapped one arm around Cas's waist to keep him steady.
"I'll actually talk about my feelings for once if you do, because there's something you should know, Cas." Dean relaxed (as much as he could, anyway) in the chair. Cas smiled softly. It wasn't often he saw Dean like this.
Crowley was also present, looking bothered by the fact he was there. Gavin smiled next to his father and waved in his seat, turning around to meet Dean's eye. Benny, Andrea, Kevin, Jody, Bobby—all there.
The first thing he noticed was that the angel was breathing, but just barely. He wasn't dead. He could still get better. "He's alive," Dean muttered. "Don't scare me like that, damn it," he said to Cas's body.
"I like that idea, Dean. I would love to." Cas pressed a quick kiss to Dean's cheek. "Your room, I'm guessing?"
"Hm? Oh, I liked it, Dean." Cas relaxed against him even more. "I was much more interested in you, however."
All of a sudden, Cas knew what to do with the ring. No matter how nice it looked on his own hand, it would no doubt look better on Dean's. Not wanting to risk anything happening to it in his pocket, he kept it on for the moment.
Finally, Dean knelt down and ran a hand down the glass and then the tie. "I love you, and I'll keep telling you until you get sick of it. I don't give a crap if you're gone either, Cas. You being dead doesn't change how I feel."
Dean met his brother's eyes in the mirror and nodded. Next to Sam, Eileen looked beautiful in a green dress the color of emeralds. She smiled reassuringly at Dean, mouthing "he's right" and making Dean laugh a bit.
"How many is that?" Sam asked worriedly, pointing to the beer Dean had started in on and the second in his other hand.
"I have something I believe you would like." Cas led him to a somewhat-private space, but they were still within earshot, and sight, of Sam and Jack. "I was walking around and saw it. It made me think of you."
Rather than nod and mumble a "thank you" Dean smiled as best he could and reached out to ruffle Jack's hair, feeling like an unofficial dad. He wondered if his relationship with Cas--because he
"You're okay, Cas, just don't do that so much," Dean said, and Cas seriously nodded as if Dean's words were the most important words in the world. "Now get your ass over here and look at this."
Damn, he was gorgeous. Everything about Cas was absolutely perfect in this moment-- his bluer-than-blue eyes, his pink lips that looked chapped but still so soft, even his hair was a hot mess. This close, the angel's natural scent took over his senses. He smelled like rain, cold steel, something Dean could only describe as clean, and the tiniest hint of honey.
The Empty wouldn't come for Cas yet, right? He could enjoy this time with Dean, couldn't he? This was everything he'd ever wanted... he had to take advantage of it now before it was too late.
The angel tried to push Dean towards the portal, but Dean shook his head firmly. "I'm not leaving you," he promised with a searing sincerity that shocked even him.
But instead of the angel's ideal outcome-- Dean running as fast as his feet could take him, the sight of Dean's emerald green eyes shining with tears, the all-too-familiar feeling of Dean's arms wrapping around him as if he would never let go-- there was nothing. Nothing but a choked-sounding concealed sob. Cas's heart broke into a million pieces.
"Never. I couldn't, Cas, not when you were damn near asking to die," he said. "You freaking passed out in the car, I thought I'd lost your ass already and I was too late."
"Not like I have anything else to do," Dean said, shrugging off his jacket. Jack watched him and followed his lead. "What's up, Cas?"
"You're good at that," Dean whispered, his face suddenly very close to Cas's own. "That complimenting crap that I'm sure as hell not used to."
"Does it even freaking matter, Sammy?" Dean asked his brother accusingly, narrowing his eyes. Sam's face softened. Dean had no idea how bad he must have looked for Sam to look at him with so much damn
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Dean get closer, and then felt the hunter wrap his arms around him in a hug that was most definitely not what friends did.
Dean laid back on his bed. He wished he could just talk to Cas, but he was staying away until the hunter wasn't going to snap at him for just walking up to him. "It's not like the guy lives in my ass," Dean had said once. Now he almost wished he did, it would make things a hell of a lot easier.
"It's a brother thing, Cas. We screw with each other all the freaking time." The angel nodded. He'd seen enough of the Winchesters' behavior to know they messed with one another fairly regularly. "Be right back." Dean quickly kissed Cas and went on his way.
The angel blade didn't have to be touched to go in deeper. One almost-lazy motion from Chuck's pointing finger and the blade twisted in response. Dean held Cas close, as if proximity and sheer force of will was enough to save the angel's life.
Cas was just a good friend, wasn't he? Not just a good friend, but Dean's best friend. He knew everything about Dean, probably including things about his body after rebuilding it from Hell. The thought should have been unnerving, but Dean now wondered: how much did he know that the hunter wasn't aware of?
Dean's hands were slick with blood. Cas's blood, because the guy decided to stand up to his father, not thinking about anything else besides Dean's safety and keeping Dean from getting hurt. At least Sammy wasn't with them, right? If he were, Chuck would have more to hold over Dean.
Half an hour later, Castiel is pretty convinced that he, in fact, cannot do this. He's hot, sweaty, his clothes are sticking to him unpleasantly in places they shouldn't, and he's wishing he'd picked up a water bottle at the mall. He's sitting at a weights machine that purports to do something to his triceps, and he can't bring himself to actually use it. His arms ache, his thighs ache, his abs ache, and his head aches. He's so done with this pathetic attempt at a workout, but if he leaves now he’ll make a fool of himself in front of Bela. He keeps peering down the stairs to see if she's left the desk yet, leaving the coast clear for him to make a hasty retreat, but she seems permanently glued there. He's trapped here for the length of a half-decent workout.
Then, following his brother’s slightly glazed eyes, he sees what made Dean come to an immediate halt and stifles a smirk behind his hand. Not what, but rather
Dean tunes out, even though the suggestion of caramel apple pie is enough to make his mouth water, and watches the snow fall in glittering flakes outside, blanketing the streets and the cars in a perfect white frosting. Across the road, the Impala has a thin layer of snow on her windshield. Dean stirs his vanilla shake slowly, distracted by thoughts of his neighbour. Castiel hasn’t lived opposite him for very long, only a few months, and in that time he seems to do nothing but work and go running. Dean’s never seen any cars outside his house, no guests going in or out, and on moving day Castiel was alone. That’s their only interaction to date: Dean had given the guy what he thought was a friendly smile and offered to help him move in. Castiel, in turn, had looked like a rabbit in the headlights and frantically declined the offer, scurrying up the porch steps and into his house with a box and not reemerging until Dean was safely inside his own home. Since then, all they’ve exchanged are shy smiles and quick waves - all instigated by Dean. Perhaps Sam’s right and he should just let the whole thing go, but something about Castiel is drawing him in magnetically. His house isn’t in disrepair but it’s in dire need of some love and attention and Dean is itching to go over there and fix the porch steps and give it a lick of paint. The only lights that ever go on at night are the kitchen and the bedroom, never the living room or any of the other upstairs rooms. The house feels lonely and cold, and Castiel himself doubly so. And the utter absence of all Christmas decorations is the cherry on top of everything. Dean wonders what Castiel would do if he turned up on his doorstep tonight with a handmade wreath for his door as a Christmas Eve gift.
“Yeah.” Dean glances back down at Lexie, resuming combing his hair with his fingers. “Third night in a row.”
“Good morning to you too,” Gabriel smiles but it doesn't reach his eyes like it normally does. He seems distracted, lost in thought as he turns back to their food, popping a capsule into the Keurig to make Sam his usual soy caramel latte. The machine buzzes to life and they both watch it for a moment. There's a tension in the air and Sam’s sure he knows what it's about.
“Meg isn't just a fuck buddy.” Castiel had dipped his cappuccino with a frown, wiping the foam moustache from his top lip. “There's more to it than that.”
Amara goes to stay at her sister’s for a couple of days and Dean has some breathing space - during which he seems to do nothing but relive the weird conversation in the jacuzzi and dodge Sam’s calls - but when she gets back the atmosphere between them is colder than liquid nitrogen. Every word out of her mouth is a sharp barb in his direction, every glance across the kitchen or bedroom loaded with ire, and Dean feels like he’s constantly walking on eggshells. It’s doing nothing for his nerves which are close to shredded.
His brother hasn’t moved; he’s still standing staring up at the clock, looking for all the world like a man waiting his turn for the gallows.
A buzzing sound snaps him from his reverie and he turns to see his phone, which he had abandoned on the counter earlier in the day, lit up with a text message. He ignores it for a moment, filling his cup with hot water and pausing to take a few deep breaths. The hand pouring the water still shakes, and he forces himself to rein in his anxieties. It was a dream. There's nothing here to hurt him. It isn't real. Well, it was real but it isn't any more. It's in the past, and the past can't hurt him any more. Right?
“Yes…” Cas hears himself answer. He's staring, blank-eyed ahead of him out of the window at the dunes.
She helps him fill in a few forms, checking one box on the health form, then she chaperones him up a sweeping flight of glass stairs overlooking an Olympic-length pool. He tries to keep his awe from showing as she walks him around the state-of-the-art equipment, pointing out the stairs to the sauna, steam room, and sports massage suites. He doesn't want to think about how much a membership to this place must cost. He can't imagine coming here regularly, parting with his own money voluntarily just to keep the card in his wallet. The city gym down the road from his apartment is just fine. The treadmills are all in use by slim women with swinging ponytails and expensive headphones, and the weight section seems dominated by a group of men in a variety of shapes and sizes, working on different parts of their bodies. He swallows hard. He's going to be totally out of place here. In fact, he's dreading having to actually work out here. He should have gifted the voucher to someone else. Maybe Gabriel. His boyfriend is pretty into the gym, he should have passed it on with his compliments. Rookie error. But he trails after Bela obediently, feeling more and more unfit as he passes by the other members.
They weave their way through the dissipating crowd, the sun sinking slowly behind a Gas-n-Sip until everything glows orange and the shadows grow long and slender, the chatter among them dying to a low murmur, and Sam wonders if he can slip off home soon, if he can borrow Dean’s phone to call Charlie then he wouldn’t need to feel bad about taking off and leaving Dean to fend for himself.
Under any other circumstance, this wouldn’t rattle Sam at all. Politeness is something he values. But when his suspicions about her relationship with his brother are so high, a single word out of her mouth bothers him beyond belief.
But he can’t walk away, not now. Not yet. One last-ditch attempt to fix everything should work, right? She was so horrified by the accident that he’s certain they’ve turned a corner now and that nothing similar will ever happen again. They can go back to being the happy couple they once were, surely. Somehow. It must be possible.
He's been pretty stressed lately, he concedes. His garage is always busy and ever since Adam quit to go travel the West coast he's been pushing himself harder than ever, taking on additional work and trying to interview prospective candidates whenever he has an hour free. But somehow, even with his sixty-hour working weeks, money is tight. He hasn't mentioned anything to Amara but their bank account is lower than it has been in months. No, years. He swallows hard, tries not to think about it. It's late, he's been drinking, it's a problem for another day.
“Mr Nannini will show you to your table, sir. He’s one of our finest waiters.” At this praise, Mr. Nannini lifts his chin in pride. “The kitchen was on the brink of closing but I spoke with the chef and you may have whatever you choose from the menu.”
But he didn’t feel like he could after their big, stupid fight. And Dean hates himself for that. His grip on Castiel becomes bruising, and the water that had previously been running hot begins to chill again. His joints are starting to ache and he doesn’t want to think about how sore Castiel must be - nor how likely it is that he’s going to make himself sick sitting here for much longer. All thoughts of sex have gone out the window, and now all he wants to do is wrap the older man in blankets and cuddle him until everything comes right again.
“Not yet, kiddo. Got a few more treats to sell, floors to clean, then I'm all yours.” He blows a raspberry onto Lexie’s neck and the boy giggles and wriggles away. “See anything you fancy?”
“Okay, fine, I haven’t watched it. But I could! I’m sure bees are interesting.” His voice wavers on the last word because, right up until this conversation, he’s never considered bees at all, let alone found them interesting. But that’s the point of a relationship, isn’t it? Compromises, shared interests. Bees, apparently.
“Alright.” Dean had lifted and dropped one shoulder, not really very interested - until he’d noticed Sam turn to walk away and offer his arm to a woman. And not to Jessica, whom he’s engaged to, but to Ruby, who looks as superior and judgemental as ever. She had thrown a saccharine smile in Dean’s direction and walked from the dining room on Sam’s arm, as Dean had stared after them in discomfort. Something didn’t feel right; Ruby was insufferable, they all knew that. But to allow her to worm her way up to Sam like this? What is his brother thinking?
He nudges Cas off him and stands, tugging Cas down the dunes and towards the beach. Laughing and shoving each other they break into a jog, then a run, racing each other to the water. Cas wins, his running regime giving him a head start, and Dean retaliates by tackling him around the waist and they go sprawling into the ocean with cries of laughter, fully-clothed without a care in the world.
As he allows himself to be dragged away into the crowd, he swears the cop turns and shoots him a smile over his shoulder. Their eyes meet for just second. But then someone pushes past him and the moment is lost. But some small part of him knows this isn’t over. That he’ll see that cop again.
“Amara.” He massages his temples. “I don’t know what’s going on with you, but you need to start living in the real world. Our savings are depleted, our rent has gone up, I barely make enough money to cover our expenses these days, and I need you to help me out with this. We need to cut back a little.”
“Kinda intrusive, though.” Dean mumbles, looking down at his boots with flushed cheeks. Most of his embarrassment and fear that Castiel was going to freak out and call the cops has all but dissolved, but he still feels a bit stupid for doing what he’s done. He freezes in utter shock when Castiel’s hand comes into his peripheral vision, hesitates, then reaches over to clasp one of his hands in his own.
When she's done with the tour, she herds him towards the changing rooms in spite of his muttered protests that he might come back another day.
“Don’t jinx us.” Dean pulls Cas from the shower and they dry each other with fluffy towels, then venture down the hallway to the kitchen where Cas makes them both tea and slides a plate of pastries across the counter to Dean. They’re both still a little damp, warm from the shower with wet hair dripping down the napes of their necks and bare-chested. He picks up a croissant and bites into it, sighing in pleasure as the flavor explodes over his tongue.
Sorry this has taken so long! I have an eye ulcer which means writing has been a bit difficult. All on the mend now.
“Will you stay here though, Daddy?” Lexie pats the bed best to him. “I don't want to go to sleep by myself.”
“My father died,” he says, and Dean feels it like a punch to the stomach. “In a car accident on Wednesday morning. I wanted to call you but…”
There’s a cop standing with his arms folded, eyes hidden behind aviator shades, stopping people from crossing the street while a garbage truck goes by. He’s tall, tanned, with thick-set biceps and thighs, and there’s a smear of turquoise glitter down one cheek, catching the sunlight as he moves. He looks like Dean’s dream guy made real, and even Sam has to admit the guy is pretty good-looking. Beside him, Jo whistles lowly and nudges Dean in the back.
“Castiel.” Meg leans forward and rests her elbows on his desk, linking her fingers together. Her nails are painted black, the varnish a few days old and chipped at the tips. “I don't need an excuse to watch you get hot and sweaty. I have plenty of lingerie that has the same effect.”
Dean smiles at him and has to look down a little to match up their gazes with how close they’ve stumbled. “Yeah, I’m—I think I’m a little drunk, dude. Don’t think I don’t notice you fucking around with my liver which, not that I’m complaining, y’know, ‘cause I’m pretty sure I’ve saved a shit ton on booze. Convenient, right? With sleeping ‘n shit, I mean, but fuck,” he laughs, “fuck, you’re making me look bad. Feel like a kid.”
“I wanna track down the thing that pulled me out,” Dean says, point black once the three of them have settled in, Sam sitting on the bed under the mirror he
They’re ordering pizza because that’s a thing they do now, ordering in and eating together. Ruby had kind of forgotten about the strange emotional bond that sharing food stimulates. She’d also forgotten how fucking good greasy food is. Funny the things you forget if you're dead long enough. She’s beginning to remember.
. I gave up. No last calls, no second chances; no saving nothing there, not anybody or anything. Didn’t think there was anything worth saving, neither.”
“We saw it on the way in,” Bobby says. “Big place. Perfect for putting up as many sigils and signs you can think of when you ain’t got a clue what the hell it is you’re wrangling with.”
He pulls back slowly and Cas lets him, arms gently disentangling. He looks at Dean with a peculiar expression, but Dean can’t puzzle it out and recalls that Cas is just a weird guy.
“I didn’t know the man personally but I still have much to say on what modern human’s consider to be the historicity of Yeshua of Nazareth’s life,” Cas grumbles.
But the breeze is soft and smells like the earth and hot asphalt and he knows, because his subconscious is keen on a pattern that he will not admit to, that he will not have nightmares tonight.
For the first time since he’d shown up beaming like a rockstar, Dean hesitated. He flexed his jaw, eyes flitting aside before he eventually shrugged in faux nonchalance. “I remember—being there. And then.”
It takes a moment, but Bobby’s ears finally begin to pick up handfuls of words. “Come on,” Dean is saying, insistent, embittered, “come on. I know you can hear me. I
, however, she’d been fifty-fifty on. Ruby is the first to admit her anticipated role as a kinda Hollywood femme fatale hadn’t exactly been fruitful at first, but it turns out subtle seduction doesn’t work on Sam Winchester as well as literally throwing yourself at him and hoping you keep failing upwards. Turns out, Ruby is fucking awesome at that.
and nearly throws himself into the river to see if the gravity of that thought alone could drown him.
Dean shrugs. He doesn’t want to think about it. He grips his own bare forearm draped over Cas’ back to keep them linked. “Dunno. Just is.”
He fishes out his wallet and barely reels in a dramatic groan at the just-under-three-digit-total, forking over the cash when a thought occurs to him out of the blue as he glances at the calendar behind the desk. “Y’know, we’re exactly a month off from the day we met,” he says, almost to himself, surprised by how tickled he is by the thought. He laughs out loud and Karen gives him what has a fighting chance at being a genuine smile. “Hey, Cas! Go figure! We’re a month early for our anniversary.”
“I’m thinking that you shouldn’t waste money on me,” Cas advises, immediately. “The prices here are exorbitant.”
Bobby tried not to get too riled up, took a deep breath before saying with exaggerated care, “How’d it manage that, then?”
An extra large, then, half veggie for Sam and half everything for Ruby. She wants to see if she can put some meat on her new bones.
Dean laughs, breathily, tucking his face down to rest his cheek on the solid plane of Cas’ shoulder. “Can’t say shit like that, man,” Dean thinks to remind him.
And who says this shit ain’t normal? What about when Kevin Bacon taught Chris Penn how to dance to “Let’s Here It For the Boy'' in
She can see it, clear as day: Dean in the deepest, darkest, most grueling cranny of Hell torturing his little heart out before stopping abruptly, turning to Alistair and saying,
It wells up a lump in his throat. Dean swallows hard and holds tight to what he’s got, presses his face in as close as he can, that ugly fucking coat under his hands, his cheek. Cas holds him right back. They’re only dancing by the loosest definition.
Dean shrugs, mouth full. “Guess friendships between two chicks can get pretty intense. Emotional and shit.”
Dean revises, mentally, taking a long drink. Cas barely knows Sam; Dean doesn’t even think they like each other very much. Cas did this for
It’s a good question but Dean’s not expecting it; it’s not the question most people would ask. Mary’d liked rock ‘n roll and folk. Had a couple of blues albums, too. Handful of country records. She’d play music all the time, swoop Dean up in her arms and dance him around the room. Sometimes his dad would, too, and Mary would laugh and cheer them on. Those were good times.
sleep, even, which is a plus since she can’t really afford to. But this? Sprawling out and taking a sec to decompress a little?
Cas spins them loftily while giving Dean a contrasting dry look. “Yes, Dean, you’re very sexually active, so you’ve said.”
Dean thinks of his early to mid twenties without meaning to, the ache in his chest as he curled up in the backseat of the car that still smelt like his dad underneath the cloying aroma of fast food. He’s thought a lot about those days the past month or so on his own. Loneliness so aching that it digs in deeper than hunger.
Dean jolts to glare at Cas but Cas is just looking at him with open, naive curiosity. Dean lets out a breath and relaxes. Fuck, he’s not even joking. It’s just . . . an observation. God help Cas if he
He rests his head back against the soft leather, slumping down low with a sigh. He lulls his head over to glance at Cas, already looking back at him like the freaky little night creature he is. Dean smiles. “Hey.”
Pamela’s cool. Sam itches to tell her that it’s in her best interests to kick them off her premises. To reiterate: that’s not psychic talk, that’s life experience and a spotty track record.
’,” Dean does a fair impression of both, if he does say so himself, though Cas gives little reaction beyond tilting his head in the shadowed recess of his perch. “And they argue, yada yada, long story short he says, ‘
“Yeah,” Dean agrees, quietly, a half-formed wish that Cas wasn’t dead set on his God quest. “Yeah, it’s lonely.”
, this next bit hits Dean like a brick fucking wall: Cas isn’t mimicking him at all, he’s just not smiling at the same thing Dean is. Cas’ smile isn’t taking cue
, Dean thinks, nonsensically, taking a long drink and looking over Cas’ shoulder at the dark rush of water,
. It’s a gift, and it’s yours, okay? Just yours. It doesn’t matter—like, it couldn’t possibly matter a modicum less who the hell gave you this gift. Got that? It doesn’t matter because it’s
“You’re biased,” Cas points out fiddling with his silverware and hazarding another bite of his steak.
“What, like you did with Chastity back at the bar?” Dean shakes his head. “You’re a pretty focused guy, Cas. Good listener even without the mindmeld crap.”
“You got real big friggin’ hands, dude,” Dean remarks, squeezing the one in his before flexing his fingers and pressing them to mirror Cas’. Dean’s are almost an inch shorter. Jesus.
He’s fucking pissed, he’s fucking ready, Dean can sling him any question he wants to, he’s game, but then Dean just . . . doesn’t.
“Alright,” Dean says, “there. Nice and polite. Don’t push it just—weird, you being shorter than me but just—”
—” and he grips Cas’ shoulders lightly and moves him in an easy back and forth sway, mirroring Dean.
She’s considering needling Sam into something before their food gets here but she also doesn’t want to piss him off
Cas takes this all in with a rapt sort of intrigue before flatly stating, “That’s all fairly convoluted, don’t you think?”
He feels good, though. Really good. He doesn’t want to think about Cas dying because Cas dying would suck, it already
So Dean reaches out and pats Cas’ left shoulder clumsily. “Good,” he mumbles, tilting his head back and shutting his eyes. He squeezes Cas’ arm before letting his hand drop. “Good.”
A shiver whips up from the places of contact up to the base of his skull. Dean slumps in closer. “—Yeah. That. She’ll probably let you do that.”
Dean harrumphs but he smiles a little at that. “Oh, was I included in the silent contemplation agenda?”
It looks . . . well, it looks fucking bad. Real fucking bad. It’s hilarious. “Loosen up!” he orders and Cas raises an eyebrow. “Oh, no, not the singular eyebrow of debasement,” Dean laughs aloud at him. “Come on, Poindexter, we’ll make a dorky little Gene Kelly out of you yet.”
He sort of expects a dirty look or a request to vacate the premises, but Karen huffs and gives him a wry little smirk. “That work with him, huh?” she nods in Cas’ direction.
“Yes, ma’am,” Dean lies through his teeth, tugging Cas along with him and smiling at how Cas lets him. “You have a good night.”
“You know how crazy you sound?” Sam feels a little like he’s itching out of his skin. His head hurts like a bitch, temples pounding.
“Last night,” Cas, who may not be even a little drunk but seems more relaxed regardless, says wryly.
“Your night, man,” Dean chuckles. It is also no coincidence that he is halfway through his second beer.
In the fluorescent glare of the porch light, under the starlit sky, Dean is pacing a furious rut into the dirt path. Back and forth, like a soldier, back and forth, muttering to himself all the while with his eyes shut. He gesticulates, occasionally.
“Sam, he saved me,” Dean says. “I know what this looks like and I don’t care. You don’t understand.”
it. Fuck, if Sam wasn’t suddenly right back in the passenger sear, with all it’s lack of blame, all it’s lack of control.
Another round—it doesn’t drop. It doesn’t even flinch. The lights flare and drop over and over, painting the thing in sharp angles.
“Nothin’,” he explains, shooting him a wry look. “I was just thinking, man is this night totally wasted on us.”
And that’s the last pleasant thought she has for a while because she hears—beyond Sam humming in the other room, beyond the mumbling of the guests in the surrounding rooms, under the low rush of traffic—the low drawl of the late Dean Winchester talking to Bobby Singer on the sidewalk outside.
Eventually Sam says, “Yeah, I’m getting that,” slowly and yeah, a little peevishly but come on, “I am, Dean. But what, like,
Dean scowls. “Okay, fuck off. You wouldn’t catch me dancing in public if my life depended on it, okay? But that is the human condition, bitch—shit’s good for the soul. Also, as I said, it works wonders on the ladies. You should know these things if you’re planning on sticking around.”
Dean frowns, shifting in his seat, feeling a bit like someone’s—that is, Cas’—lab project but not entirely finding the experience to be all that unpleasant, if a little embarrassing. “Sure,” he agrees easily. “So?”
“I’m sorry about your virginity, man,” he says, taking a shot in the dark at remorse, “but you know something? If I couldn’t get you laid, at least I gave you a good first date.”
“It was good, whatever it was that saved me,” Dean had said earlier when he’d shown Bobby the shock of a brand on his arm, a raised raw pink welt, “and not just because it pulled my ass out. I remember it was
Dean is at the far end of the barn looking like he’s been left at the altar. He stares at them blankly for a second like he doesn't quite understand what it is he’s looking at, then he scowls.
“And then . . . .” Bobby cautioned when Dean showed no intention of continuing, eyes settling far off somewhere to Bobby’s right with a distant, bordering on dreamy look. Sharper now, “And then?”
He chuckles to himself and moves to grab their last two beers. When he looks back, Cas is still obediently shuffling back and forth, waiting for him with his arms straight down by his side. Dean nearly chokes on his laughter then has half a mind to feel bad when Cas gives him a look, so he swallows the neck of his bottle and sprints into the circles of light as the music surges, giddy, jumping dramatically and taking Cas’ arm up in a do-si-do, swinging them around as he hands off Cas’ beer.
“You got it,” Dean praises and Cas smiles that sweet little smile. “Now if she’s real receptive you move in a little closer, put your hand on her lower back but, uh, you know. You’ll know what to do when you’re at that point, let’s just keep where we are.”
Cas watches the exchange with a little wrinkle in his brow like he’s puzzling out the nuances of human conversation. God, Dean just fucking—likes him.
Dean can’t help but chuckle at his awkwardness, sways in close to keep from looking him in the eyes. “Yeah, I’m sure she’ll appreciate your civility, Cas, but if a girl gets this close to you that’s usually a sign you can—” and immediately, Cas’ hands press warm and firm, slide to steady him two separate places low along his spine.
“You, Dean, there’s something wrong with you,” Sam says. He does it as gently as he can but cringes as it registers, even to him, as condescension and something shutters behind Dean’s eyes. A twisted, bitter part of Sam wants to snap,
Turns out the radio station is just an indiscriminate 60s station which, hey, Dean’s not complaining.
There’s been crazy demon activity in Pontiac, crazy tremors, crazy power outages. A lot of crazy. They’ve mapped it out with pins, fudged with points and times until something like an event horizon began to crop up. Ruby ignores Sam’s look to bend over and study it now: the strange flowering starburst out from Pontiac, bleeding some into the wider Livingston County. Fucking crazy.
And well, Dean’s not one to turn down pity, but still . . . . he nods and slides the two bills back over to Karen’s side of the counter. “I was never planning on ending the night with this cash, anyhow,” Dean tells her, stupid and honest. “And I didn’t have anything to tip you with anyway, so.”
Whatever Cas is about to say gets cut off by their waitress’ brisk return with two beers. “Here you go,” she says. “Ready to order?”
Words obfuscate things, Sam thinks as they re-enter the city. He had enough credits that he’d been considering going for a double major in psych as well as history, but just about everything he learned in school is contrary to this and absolutely useless in dealing with Dean. They can communicate emotions and anticipate movements with simple glances and twitches; that kind of understanding has always been baseline. Maybe that’s the problem. The both of them are too damn good at just making their own assumptions up in regard to the other.
“Isn’t it?” Sam repeats, relentless, all at once, not without anger but hinged mostly on anxious frustration, a touch desperate, fists balled and white knuckled, “Dean, you need to listen to me: this here? You, here, breathing, driving, talking to me? This is a gift. A
“Dean,” Cas says, with a worried pinch to his brow as he shifts them away from the broken glass. “Are you alright?”
“It’s cosmic,” she tells Sam, who has spent all of one whole day with daddy’s little repressed monster and has apparently rediscovered the stick up his ass that Ruby’s spent the past four months slogging through the muck uphill to remove. Cool. Not like Ruby’s spent her day relearning existential horror or anything, don’t mind her. “Nothing like I’ve ever seen before.”
Bobby hushes him with a sharp hiss, flapping his hands. “He just said it the once. Said it swallowed him whole out of Hell.”
As he’s bagging the cash from the register, afterwards, he suddenly stills. Looks up. The lines of his body stiffen. The racks of junk food tremor.
A glance out of the corner of her eyes reveals, yes, Sam has dropped the bitchface and is staring at her ass.
Karen brings them their drinks and they tuck in full force into their meals, Cas nodding in consideration at Dean’s coaxing like he’s trying to teach him wine tasting or some shit. Detect the notes of meaty sweetness in each bite of nineteen dollar steak.
survive tomorrow, and things continue on as they have been, I may start to further drift out of the celestial plane and ground myself in this vessel. I’ll lose most of my senses that way.”
“There we go,” Dean says, quietly pleased. “The Sun Ain’t Gonna Shine Anymore” by the Walker Brothers picks up where “We’ve Gotta Get Out of This Place” leaves off, only a split second hiss of dead air between them. Apparently somewhere out there there’s a disc jockey clairvoyant enough to know it’s the end of the world. Dean snorts.
He rolls his bottle aside in the direction of the Impala, stumbling a little as he straightens which works with his objective, however, because he’s able to slip his arms right around Cas’ neck as Judy Collins starts singing.
He swallows thickly, visibly. His eyes are shining and his teeth are clenched like they can stifle the bounce of his chin, his lower lip. Sam stares. When he'd asked Dean what Hell had been like, Dean had said that it was all a blur—this doesn’t sound like a blur. This sounds . . . bad.
has concluded, Karen for some reason has apparently warmed up to them. “So what was the special occasion?” she wants to know as she does up their bill. She didn’t bother to bring them the check, just waved them over to the computer when Dean thought to look for her.
“Damn right,” Dean allows. Privately, he thinks about how it’s been a hot minute since someone’s touched him this nicely, let alone had sex with him.
“Like that,” he agrees and turns back to the darkness, the scatter of a few stubborn stars bookending the highway, the shadow of the river. He opens a beer for Cas and then one for himself.
Dean shoulders him clumsily, smiling despite himself. He’s, like, ninety percent sure Cas is screwing with him. Eighty percent, maybe.
Another stoplight and Dean still does not look at him as he asks, tightly even, “Sammy, you got something you wanna tell me?”
Bobby shoots him a look as the wind starts to pick up, hands him a sawed off shotgun from the back as well as a pistol for him to tuck into his waistband, and takes another shotgun for himself. Sam’s hair is whipping into his face, his flannel snapping around his waist, as they make a break for the barn.
Cas nods, solemnly, a sympathetic twitch to his lips warming his face up to something almost resembling coyness. He kicks Dean back, soft, just this side of bruising. Dean’s heart, a year resurrected and not quite up to snuff, squeezes and starts double timing in his chest.
The door slams hard behind them. It catches Sam’s whiteknuckled grip. It fractures at least two of his metacarpal bones. Sam cries out, sees red, as Bobby pulls him fully inside and bolts the door behind them.
Instead he’s thinking about how it’s a nice night, dark and warm, and the river is low and rushing and the sky filled with stars made by the weird little guy next to him drinking his beer, perfunctorily, without wavering, swallowing in smooth gulps because Dean offered it to him and fuck God and the Devil hiding in the dark of the woods, Dean’s having a good night. When was the last time he had a good night?
Cas is back to studying the lamp. Dean smiles, shaking his head at the thought. “He might not look it, but he’s a real pistol.” And, quietly, he confides, “Ain’t never known anyone like him my whole life.”
Bobby shifts in front of Dean, the horror of him empty handed, and points his shotgun at the thing and fires. Sam, with his nondominant hand, does the same with the pistol he still has. Sam gets the stomach and Bobby gets the chest. The thing keeps walking.
“It was an accident,” Dean insists, as soon as they hear from Bobby. They’re sitting at a diner halfway back to the hotel room and these are the first real words Dean has spoken. “I know it was. He didn’t mean to.”
“Dean, come on!” Sam pleads. “Think about this, man. You wanna—what? Shake it’s hand? Give the knight-errant a kiss thank you?”
“Tell you what,” Dean says. “We survive this? All of this, I mean. We live through everything by the grace of God or you or me or
He flicks absently through channel after channel of static as he cautiously continues along until eventually the tail end of an Animals’ song comes through crystal clear.
Once they’re on the road, Sam braces himself for the third degree. He works himself up into a defensive bristle before it begins,
Dean waves this concern away. “What you’re saying is that you got so much going on with, y’know,” he figures broadly to Cas, the space around Cas, as though he is simply an invisible creature bundled inside of this Ruby Tuesday on a plane slightly to the left. Hell, maybe he is. Dean’s been downstairs and back and he’s still never wrapped his head around the metaphysics of the whole thing. “That exorbitantly priced steak is barely making a blip on the ol’ Cas-dar.”
“Yeah,” Dean grunts, shaking himself. “Hang on, lemme just—” and he high tails it for the liquor store and (
Sam’s ipod shuffles from a nice streak of her own personal picks (cheesy synth-punk and 2000s bubblegum pop) to some of Sam’s more unfortunate choices (ie: whiny white guy alt-rock). It’s growing on her, though.
The look Cas levels him is unreadable, almost comically serious with glaze all across his lips. “It was just a hypothetical. It won’t come to that. It won’t.”
Karen smiles soft at Cas’ back before glancing over to Dean. “It’s late and I fucking hate this joint,” Karen tells him.
They get two buck hickory bourbon bacon sirloins, the 8 oz ones that cost an insane nineteen bucks each, like one of them’s getting married tomorrow or something because Cas revealed he still has the cash Dean gave him to get laid with and hey! How different is steak from sex, really? Dean said he was splurging so he’s fucking splurging. It’s the end of the world, baby, they might as well eat like it.
And, well, it turns out it really is a small motel—there’s only two rooms available, the elderly woman behind the desk explains, both singles.
“I won’t, Dean,” Cas promises. “But I don’t think this night is a waste. You remember I was content to just sit in contemplative silence with you.”
The lights scream alight one last time, sparks raining down on them as they’re all set in high contrast—the high arch of the room, the resilient fortitude on Dean’s desperate face, the thing—the thing with its bright terrible eyes set on Dean looking—looking like—like—
But Dean’s jaw is clamped shut, a flush high on his cheeks, and the next thing Sam knows a demon is sitting down at their table, threatening his brother. They end up walking out hungry but without a drop of blood spilt, because Dean has the dumbass perception to roll up his sleeve and show off the welt of a hand print.
Dean frowns as though in deep thought. “You think it’s a chick? Be kinda weird.” He shrugs again, throws on a phony lecherous smirk. “Might be kinda cool, sorta hot,” Dean says, then soberly adds, “pretty sure it’s a dude, though. Felt like a dude.”
Cas rubs a broad palm, hard in pressure and tentative in touch, up to the back of Dean’s neck where the heat of skin over damp skin sears like a whole new brand, is almost overwhelming even before Cas squeezes him there, firm and gentle.
He crawled out of his grave with a virgin liver and no tolerance to speak of, but since he’s been drinking himself hard to sleep at night most nights—he’s pretty sure Cas is healing his liver whenever he heals whatever gaping wound requires his primary attention which is . . . weird, yeah, for sure. But also nice.
So when he says he’s terrified as they’re leaving Pamela’s, watching the ambulance carrying her and Bobby scream away, he is not saying it lightly.
Bobby watches Dean. After he checks him over, after he hugs him so tight his spine cracks, after Dean’s kind enough to pretend Bobby isn’t sniffling and snotting all over him, after all of that, Bobby just—
“I feel . . .” Cas blinks and frowns like he’s trying a new food and isn’t quite sure if he likes it, “silly.”
Dean thinks on it for a second, a little giddy with excitement that he gets to be the one to teach Cas this shit. He takes a drink and when Cas mimics him, he immediately feels the loss of contact and it rubs him wrong right up until Cas puts his hand back on his waist. “Okay, so. If the girl you're with isn’t going to put out or you can’t hook up for some reason, but she still had a good time and she wants to see you again, she’s going to kiss you at the end of the night. On the lips, usually, and especially if you’re being obvious about wanting her, but I’ll let you in on a little known secret, dude: she’s only going to kiss you on the cheek if she’s really,
drunk. “Dunno if you noticed but I ain’t no chick, man. Don’t worry, though—we’ll find you some girl dorky enough for your ass eventually.”
“Yeah, man, of course.” Distantly, Dean thinks of some girl in some near future with the opportunity to dance with Cas slow and close like this. She’s blurry in his mind’s eye but Cas is crystal clear, his big hands and steady arms drawing her in close, closer. She’ll be a real lucky gal, whoever she is.
The waitress nods like this is what she expected, unfortunately. There’s no one else in the joint so she was probably hoping to close up early. She lingers at the table like she’s expecting them to come up with their order here and now, and meanwhile Janis sings, “
as Dean doesn’t quite ignore him, more looks like he’s figuring out the words he wants and Sam tries not to get frustrated. It’s not a new thing, Dean struggling with his words when he’s overwhelmed, but right this moment, Sam just wants to snap,
The man stumbles around the store, bagging up protein bars and water, before taking a long moment verging on vanity to examine himself in the mirror over the faucet. He touches his own shoulder, flinches, knees giving a little and mouth opening with a muted gasp, but then he does it again and holds it. Braced against the sink, he holds his hand there for a long time.
He can picture it easily: his mom with her head tucked safely on the sure bulk of his father’s shoulder, like Dean is at this moment with Cas, John’s hands steady on Mary’s back as Cas’ are on Dean’s. Can picture Mary with her eyes shut thinking,
Bobby doesn’t know what else to do but back away, slowly. To return and settle back into his chair. Pretend to be asleep when Dean wakes him up a couple hours later to start packing for the eight hour drive back to Illinois.
“Youch,” Dean laughs. “Okay. I deserved that, but no, seriously, dude. It’s a compliment. Girls like that.”
At some point during his silent vigil, Bobby must doze off. His dreams are foggy and anxious, and when he wakes it’s with a jolt, a crick in his neck, and a near heart attack when he finds the couch empty.
Cas nods like this is some profound wisdom. “Yes, it’s often very lonely. It took some time to recognize the feeling, I’ve never had reason to experience it before.”
“Bobby,” Dean grunts, when he sees him, wobbling upright. Bobby lunges to steady him and startles to see that Dean’s bleeding from both ears.
he is stating the obvious. Doing it anyway. Like he’s pointedly making conversation for the hell of it, like it’s an indulgence. Dean guesses it kind of is.
Bobby, cursing and spitting, raises his gun again only to realize Dean has put himself between them and the thing, arms spread wide.
It’s a hot night. Dean hip checks Cas playfully as they walk back to the Impala and stumbles, groaning and laughing, when it's like coming up against a brick wall. Cas steadies him and smiles his little mirror smile back. Dean takes off his jacket before slipping into the driver's seat, throws it without ceremony into the back.
A breeze chuffs off of the river and a chill runs over Dean’s bare arms, goosebumps raising up. He takes Cas’ free left hand in his right, moves the one still holding the bottle to his own waist while slinging his own over Cas’ shoulder. There’s still a generous void of space between them but Dean still laughs a little at how close their faces are all of a sudden, Cas blinking his sleepy eyes wide at him, a little like he did when Dean handed him off to the girl at the brothel. Yeesh, the guy is afraid of women.
“Anyways,” Ruby spares him, “it can’t hurt to keep up maintenance. Don’t want this body to die the second I slip out of it if I break it too badly.”
“Dunno,” Dean says. “She liked Judy Collins. Might’ve made her think of Dad, y’know? Leaving the life you know with some guy.”
“I mean,” Dean says, and Cas gives him a warning look. Dean proceeds heedless but slow, “I mean, that would be bad. Like, very bad. For everyone involved, obviously.”
now. It’s not who gave it to you, it’s what you decide to do with it.” Sam takes a deep trembling breath. “
After helping for an hour or so, Sam had thrown in the towel, pleading a migraine that he was not quite exaggerating. Dean huffed but allowed it.
But cirrhosis bullet dodging aside, his tolerance is still wonky; on a full stomach and only a handful of beers (plus two shots, earlier) over the past four hours, he still feels this side of buzzed. He considers the liquor store, again, and the risk of the credit card he’s already going to make on the room.
“Have you lost your damn mind, boy?” Bobby roars over the clatter and band of the overhead shutters. The barn groans all around them like it’s about to be sucked up into space. Beside him, Sam is clutching his hand to his chest, sickly pale.
sake—”Dean, you really don’t think I don’t understand feeling an inexplicable connection to something beyond myself? Me?”
It’s a Springsteen song, one of the popular ones, going a little fuzzy as he turns off onto a backroad off of the one wrapping around back of the shopping center. He thinks of how just the other day “Cover Me” had come on and Dean had thought of Cas, unbidden, and it was weird because it was clearly a love song about some random chick but then, it was a natural connection, Dean guessed: they’d spent the better part of a year literally and metaphorically covering for each other.
this schtick, and he knows it sucks. He points vaguely upwards. “My mom played this album all the time when—”
he has to lie and lie and lie through his fucking teeth about what he’s been up to and when Dean asks him if he made a deal to get him out, Sam will have to explain that
, he deserves a treat and Cas might kick it tomorrow—why not splurge? Besides, Dean’s a generous date.
Dean turns down the radio. Under the ringing screams of crickets, Dean can just pick up the sound of running water. The road continues on. Perfect.
About a mile down the road, where the trees have gotten dense and dark, the station collapses in on itself with static indistinguishable from the wind as the road starts to narrow and turn to gravel. Dean flinches but perseveres, patting the Impala’s side out the window with the flat of his hand. He slows as little rocks ping against them.
Bobby snorts. “Not to sound like a pessimist, but I don’t think the Christian Messiah pulled Dean’s ass out of the friar.”
Sam had had to talk him down from calling Pamela’s extension at the hospital by insisting that yes, Bobby would’ve asked her this or that already and he would’ve told them if he’s learned anything new. Besides, it’s kind of bad taste to demand answers interrogating a friend who’d just gotten burned doing them a favor.
“Well,” Dean says, looking at Cas’ face, half lit up in a glow, half shadowed, and laughs. “You hear that?” he says, signifying the tripping beat of the song by drumming his hands on either of Cas’ shoulders. Cas allows him to with a slight, bemused smile.
“He was a very funny man, apparently, though humor, I find, is subjective. Also, he was a sodomite.”
Nobody else laughs for an awkward half beat. And then Dean snorts, moves in to take the chair to Pamela’s right. Sam and Bobby tentatively follow suit. Pamela lowers the lights and drops the black out curtains until the glow of the candles casts their shadows long and crooked over the floor. Sam swallows and takes his brother’s hand in his.
The electricity comes back on just before noon, and with it the grainy security camera—just in time to catch a young man breaking in.
“We’ll be good,” Dean says, grinning, shooting a glance over to Cas as he nudges him under the table feeling this side of buzzed himself now. “Right?”
She and Sam have been running non-stop this past month, driving straight from lead to lead, Sam taking the days and Ruby the nights. It took him a second to allow that, her driving, and though it’s clearly more of a necessary evil in Sam’s eyes than a grand gesture, Ruby recognizes the prerequisite trust for what it is. Knows it’s a “big deal”. She accepts the wheel without so much as a snide remark, though she does snicker a little in private while Sam snores away from his sprawl in the backseat at the thought of Dean Winchester rolling in his grave.
“It’s you,” Dean breathes out, and he turns to face the thing that looks like a pencil pushing accountant but isn’t. “It’s you.”
He smiles at Cas and Cas gives a little half-smile back, the same one from outside the brothel. Dean’s gotta duck his head into the menu to keep from beaming right in the guy’s face. He’s apparently figured out a pretty sure way of getting Cas to smile—monkey-see, monkey-do; machine learning, except . . . . Well. It don’t seem artificial, is the thing. The way Cas frowns as he reads over the appetizers, glancing quick looks over at Dean.
“You, uh, sure we’re all set?” Dean inquires, chewing at the corner of his lower lip. Bobby and Sam stare.
The surreal thing is that Sam has had this dream before. Not a psychic dream, either (which have tapered off, weirdly enough, but he guesses reality can rarely follow the strict rules fictional stories are meant to keep in order to stay compelling—that would be
Karen hands off the bills with a shrug. She has deep, miserable bags under her eyes, Dean notices and he wonders if his own are that bad. Somebody’s world is always ending somewhere. “My hand slipped, punched in the code for three long islands and a couple beers. Funny that. Just subtracted it.”
But whatever. She’s had a pretty shitty year, lofty aspirations aside. She deserves to be able to enjoy the little things.
in his Stanford educated voice. “I know. But—I mean, why does that mean you can’t enjoy the little stuff? The little stuff being a steak that’s half a pound but still.”
It ricochets up his cranium and down to his knees. Dean lets out a long, trembling breath and is reduced to little better than dead weight. It doesn’t matter: Cas has got him, sure and strong around the waist.
“Nah, man,” Dean says, shaking his head. “You don’t get it. This was—fuck, I couldn’t have been more than eight? Nine, maybe? Sammy was talking in sentences and running around, y’know, real handful, getting harder and harder to just lock him up in a motel room for the weekend, right? I tried to put aside money for when it got real bad so we could walk on over to a discount theater if one was around. That afternoon we theater hopped from
“We have a name, so we summon the thing,” Dean says real slow-like, like Sam’s the one acting like a dumbass.
Cas glances up at that, sharp and quick. “Anna carved her grace out. I’ll slowly be suffocated from mine.”
. Immediately the summer seems to be ending far too soon. Dean squares his shoulders to suppress a shiver. “Don’t sell yourself short. Humans have got a knack for surviving what doesn’t kill ‘em.”
The thing glances almost thoughtlessly over at Bobby and Sam, its eyes dimming to a less radioactive blue. Sam, he thinks, is going to try his luck and fire his gun again at the head and hell, maybe Bobby is too; but the thing raises a hand and with a delicate flick of the wrist they are hitting the ground out cold.
“Sorry, Dude. I really don’t remember you. I was only in my freshman year when I had my knee injury. I wasn’t able to get back to where I was.”
Cas carefully slid out of the car, holding Dean’s head still and steady. Once he was outside, Sam wrapped his arms under his brother’s and slowly started to pull Dean out of the backseat. As soon as Dean was out, Cas moved back in and resumed his original bridal carry of the older Winchester. Sam closed the car door, looking around briefly before moving to their motel room. Cas walked slowly behind him, each step purposeful and precise.
“I have no clue. If I’m being honest, our talk earlier was one hell of a roller coaster ride.” He turned and found Cas’ bright blue eyes focused on him. “Claire made me realize something as well.”
"Dean. I wouldn't ask you if I had another option. I know you're not fond of bugs, but do you honestly think that I broke my leg on purpose? To make you have to interact with them?" Cas huffed as he tried to reach down his cast to scratch himself. "Because let me tell you how much fun I'm having right now."
"I know what you said, doesn't mean I'm not going to be disappointed that I can't find a job," Cas grumbled and ran his fingers through his hair. "We're a team. We're supposed to work together."
Dean made quick work of the remaining hives, repeating the actions from the first hive. He was almost sad that he had gotten through the work so fast.
Cas stomped on Dean’s foot, causing him to cry out in pain. He quickly changed it to what he hoped would pass as in sadness. Cas helped him yank at the same time, successfully pulling his keys free.
Dean pursed his lips before taking Claire by the arm and leading her towards the door. He looked over his shoulder at Cas and Kaia. “We’ll be back. Get started on a new offering.”
“Yeah. Course I am. Just tired. Been up since the asscrack of dawn when the old man called me.” Dean quickly reached for the book of crossword puzzles he kept behind the counter and turned to the last one he worked on. “So, who opened Rentflix this morning?”
“I think Marv just got sick of me leaving the store. He knows he can’t get anyone else to work the fucking job, so as long as I’m somehow available, he doesn’t care.” Cas leaned against the counter, looking out over the store. “Don’t you have practice today?”
Dean shook his head as he tried to slide his key into the lock that secured the metal shutter in place. “Dad’s not here, and as long as you two don’t drag me or the shop into any kind of shit with the cops, I don’t care. Fuck!” Dean cursed and again tried to insert the key into the lock. “What the hell?”
“Okay, I don’t know if I should be mad at you because you lied that you were the reason Cas stopped hanging out with us or because you left him like that!” Charlie had started pacing the room as Dean recounted that fateful night so many years ago. “You absolutely loved him. Anyone who had eyes could see that!” She stopped in front of Dean and jabbed a finger into the shoulder she had punched, causing him to wince. “I get that we were young, and you were afraid. But we were leaving. All of us!”
Dean whimpered internally. At least he hoped it was silent and not out loud. This Cas guy was going to be the death of him.
The following day, Dean woke up to find Cas already out of bed. In his stead was the cursed beekeeper's suit. Dean groaned and pulled his pillow over his face before yelling into it. After getting his frustration out, he removed the pillow and sat up, looking at the suit again. An involuntary shiver went down his back, and he buried his face into the pillow again, letting out another string of curses and profanity.
“And I wasn’t yours?” Cassie crossed her arms over her chest and stared at Dean, cocking her eyebrow.
“Because…” Dean’s unformed argument was lost on his tongue as Cas returned to biting, leaving marks along his neck and shoulder. “Fuck, Cas!”
“He likes that?” Dean shrugged. “I mean, it’s not my thing but to each their own. But now I’m not gonna get that image out of my head. I mean, Andrea’s with Benny now, so I’m assuming she did that in the past with Alistair. Now I need to know if Benny’s into that.”
Pulling into the hotel’s parking lot, Dean found a spot. Once Baby was settled in her place, Dean took a moment to relax and yawned. He looked over at Cas, who had fallen asleep the moment Dean started the three-hour trip, and smiled softly before nudging the former angel. “Cas, we’re here.”
“You just told me you’ve sucked the dicks of thirty-six other guys!” Another customer came up to the counter as Lisa headed towards the exit. “Can you believe it? My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks!”
“I don’t have time for that.” Dean dragged his hand down his face and pushed past the duo. He unlocked the
“How do you feel?” Cas looked up at Dean before nuzzling into his neck. “I know that was quick and dirty, and I’m sorry, I know you deserve more…”
Dean took the ball in hand and looked fondly at Cas. “What would I do without you, man?” He smiled softly, telling himself to keep his emotions in check.
“You’d probably be moping behind the counter, so no different than usual.” Cas knocked on the counter. “I’ll call the ones I know. You call the others. You don’t have much time.” He started swiping on his phone before holding it up to his ear. “Hey, Garth.”
As Dean looked around for Charlie again, her distinct giggle caught his attention. “I know, I know!” She was bright and bubbly, as she often was during social events. Someone was dragged behind her, but from the angle, Dean couldn’t see who it was. “I promise, it’ll be fine.” Charlie came into sight, her arm behind her attached to…
Cas pulled Dean in for a fierce kiss, bashing their lips and teeth together in desperate want. “You’re not moving fast enough.”
Cas sighed. “Movies Plus. They have a movie I want to watch that we don’t have.” He held out his hands and closed his fingers around the keys after Dean dropped them in. “I can’t be gone that long. It’s not like I’m next door, and the walkie will pick up.”
“Dude! I said no soliciting, and that means your unwanted opinion as well. Stop harassing my customers and get out of my store.” Dean dragged his hand down his face. “I’m not even supposed to be here today.”
"I was thinking..." He left soft kisses along Dean's neck. "When my suit comes in, and the cast comes off, you and I can go out and take care of the bees together in our costumes.
"Fuck." Dean stepped into the shower and let the warm water flow over him. It was utterly unfair what Cas was doing to him. Especially because Cas had no way of knowing. Dean leaned forward, resting his head against the wall as he wrapped his hand around his cock. Cas' voice quickly came back to him and, as he stroked himself, Dean imagined that voice saying other filthy things. Within a matter of moments, Dean bit his bottom lip, keeping himself from crying out as he spilled over his hand, painting the shower wall with his come. He took a second to compose himself, surprised that he was still half-hard, before washing himself clean.
“Claire.” Kaia walked up next to her and rested her hand on her shoulder. “You did text him at two-thirty in the morning.”
"That's a fair question, Mr. Mullens. I do have a personal novel that I'm working on, but the reason it's not done is because I focus on the work I'm given." Cas started to speed up his thrusts, each one stoking the flames in Dean's belly.
“Stop, Cas. I’m fine!” Dean reached for Cas’ hand and slapped at it, the motion barely doing anything. “You need your grace.”
“Oh, no.” Lisa laughed awkwardly. “I got the position at the Yoga studio after I got my certifications completed. It’s much better there.”
Sam sat quietly in the peace of the library. Between texting with Eileen, researching a possible hunt, and maybe playing an occasional game on his phone, the morning’s events ended up pushed to the back of his mind. As he finished sending off a response to Eileen, Dean came barging into the library.
“Isn’t even supposed to be here. Trust me, Charlie and I have heard it all day.” Ash tapped Charlie’s leg, and she slid off his back and walked up to the counter next to him. “So, Red and I were thinking. It’s Saturday. You’ve had a shit-ass day. The cops were here, so no one else is going to come in for the rest of the day.” He rested his elbow on the counter and his chin on his fist. “Let’s blow this popsicle stand. Close the shop, we’ll go back to your place, or Cas’ get high as fucking kites. Forget this shit happened!”
“Who is that person, Cas?” Dean leveled a glare at Cas. “Who? Cause you’re right. I know it’s not Cassie. It wasn’t Lydia, and it’s not Lisa. Tell me, who’s going to be the person who does that?” He knew how he sounded, and he didn’t care. But when Cas didn’t respond, he deflated. “That’s what I thought.” Dean licked his bottom lip before sucking it in and biting on it. “Watch the shop? I’ll be back.”
“So, you basically asked Cas on a date?” Charlie snickered as she asked her question. “Like, did you know he’s gay?”
Cas nodded reluctantly before making his way over and grabbing a seat. As he sat down, he noticed two drinks and looked over at Dean. “Either of these yours, Dean?”
“Too many words, Dean,” Cas complained as Dean shoved him into the backseat of the Impala. “I want to ride upfront.”
"Alright, so those are the tools. Let's introduce you to the furnaces." Cas stood up and led the group over to the large ovens, giving Dean the opportunity to adjust himself without anyone seeing. He stood behind everyone as Cas showed off the first one. "This one, along with three others, are our main furnaces. These are the ones that hit about 2,400 degrees Fahrenheit and melt the raw materials into the molten glass. There is what is known as a crucible inside each one. That holds the glass in its liquid form until we're ready to work with it."
Cas moved to his knees. "That would be an interesting way to get you to finally move in with me." He pulled at the drawstring of Dean's pants, untying them, before tugging them down over his hips. "Anyway, when was the last time you got to enjoy my lips around your cock?" Cas pulled down Dean's underwear, exposing his cock. "Can't tell me you wouldn't mind switching it up once in a while." He licked a stripe up Dean's cock before swirling his tongue around the tip."
By the end of the class, no one had made a sphere like Cas'. Of course, not a single one of the instructors had expected them to, but they were impressed with how close Dean and Donna had gotten. Once confirming for next week, the class was dismissed, with Cas sitting at the bench and appearing to stay close to Dean to keep him from bolting. When everyone had left, Cas turned to face him.
“Alright, then you left for a little bit, left your colleague Castiel in charge of the store while you were away, and in that time is when Miss Robinson entered the store.”
“So Victor, in the middle of art class, walked up to the supplies, grabbed another canvas, and just wrote ‘I Love You, Nancy’ in huge letters.” Dean slapped the table as he told the story, crying from laughing so hard. “I swear, I don’t know who was more embarrassed. Nancy, or Victor when she told him that she’s going to the convent after she graduates.”
Dean sharply sucked in air, the wind being knocked out of him by Cas’ gentle touch. He nuzzled into Cas’ hand as much as he dared. “Cas… I… There’s something I—”
Using some sort of magical bullshit —Dean was sure of it— Cas' pout powers grew more potent. Dean found himself unable to resist the baby blues of his boyfriend. "Fine. I'll figure out a way to get in your damn suit and take care of the bees." He jabbed a finger at Cas. "But you owe me. BIG. Write out the instructions, and I'll pep myself up to face the maker tomorrow." Dean collapsed on the sofa, arms folded across his chest in his own pout, as Cas happily hummed and wrote down how to care for his bees.
Dean couldn’t help himself and scoffed. “Yeah, like I’m gonna believe that, Lis.” When she didn’t respond, Dean stood up and shook his head. “You’re telling me that you sucked that guy’s dick? Lisa! He looks like a walking STD!”
“That hasn’t changed, Claire,” Cas spoke up again. “We know you’re both strong, capable women. But we’re here, so we might as well help. You two can take the lead, and we’ll just be here for support.”
He pulled up in front of Honey Dipper early, hoping to have a moment to talk to Cas before class began. However, his plan ended up waylaid as Krissy’s dad dropped her off. Dean frowned, determined to find the courage to stay after class and talk to his teacher.
“This was your doing?” Dean felt Cas’ eyes on him. “Is that what you two talked about when you left the hotel room?”
"First and foremost, Dean. Cas went to do Angel stuff. He can't get phone calls in Heaven, so why would I even attempt to call him?" Sam paused and tilted his head. "Second, I'm not going to pester him about your insecurities."
“It means that you had a specific issue that needed resolving, and I couldn’t fix it.” Cas picked up a pair of cards off a table and handed one to Dean. “Or I uh, I wasn’t your first choice.”
“You know, I get why the rebels blew up the first Death Star.” Cas leaned on the back counter and up at the TV Dean had turned on. “It was completely functional. But blowing up the second one while it was still being built? Something about that’s always bothered me.”
"Think yours can, Cassie?" Balthazar looked at Dean knowingly before whispering something in Gabriel's ear. "
“You’re the best, Dean-O. Not sure how your old man kept you here when you could have gone anywhere, but we’re glad you’re here.” Ash took a drag of the joint and passed it back to Charlie. “Just a heads up, you got five until you’re officially open.”
"Nothing all that exciting. Unless you count the 1967 Mustang Shelby GT500 that was dropped off in the shop. She's not Baby, but she's gorgeous. She's one of a kind."
“Have you ever felt this before, Dean?” Cas waited until Dean shook his head. “Am I your first guy?”
Cas' eyes went dark. "Bedroom. Now. Strip and present." Cas ran his hands quickly down Dean's sides as Dean stood up. "I'll be right behind you."
“I’ll be okay.” He looked up at Charlie, who had made a point of slowly packing up and walking by his desk. “Go find Sammy, meet me at the Impala.” Once she had left the classroom, he looked up at Mrs. Moseley. “I’m sorry.”
Another rush of warm air made Dean melt in pleasure. Cas was chuckling, amused by the suffering he caused Dean. After a few more minutes of delightful torture, Cas pulled back. "You haven't come yet. Which means either I'm not doing a good enough job, or you're being very good."
“Then we stay, Cas.” Sam shut off the car. “I’ll help you get him out.” He got out of the Impala and closed his door before slowly opening Cas’.
"That's my good boy. So good to me. Let me take an interview and kept me warm while doing so." Cas' movements turned frantic and erratic before he froze with his own groan. "That's it, Boy. So good to me. Say my name, Dean. Come for me and say my name."
“Need to at least break even for the day,” Dean replied, his voice quiet and broken. “Can’t do that if the store’s closed.”
"You told me to keep doing what I was doing, should one of the places I applied to call." Cas climbed off the bed, collapsing the bar and setting it on the nightstand before crossing to the bathroom. He returned with a warm washcloth and helped Dean roll over onto his back. "Did you honestly want me to stop?"
Dean bit his bottom lip and grunted. "Not helping, Sir." A tight squeeze around the base of his cock helped to calm him down.
“Dean?” Charlie watched as her best friend paced his bedroom. “Dean! You’re entirely worked up. I don’t get it.”
Dean winced internally and nodded. “Yeah, that one. If you throw it up here, we can finish the period, my break will be over, and I’ll reopen the store.”
Dean lifted his hand and pointed at Claire, licking his lips as his brain sputtered, trying to think of a response. “It’s not the same.”
Cas looked down at Charlie, who conveniently looked away in turn. “A certain friend said it would be in my best interest if I did.” Cas looked back at Dean. “You look good.”
“Wouldn’t need to do that, Mrs. Moseley. I can just turn it down.” It suddenly dawned on Dean what she was getting at. “I’m not cut out for college. Just not gonna happen for me.”
and groaned. Sure, he had agreed to work since his old man asked him to, but fuck if he actually wanted to be there. After dragging his hand down his face, Dean shut off the engine and climbed out of the Impala.
“Do that again, Dean.” Cas moved closer, pressing against Dean. A warm flutter filled Dean’s chest and moved in closer to Cas as well. “Dean. Cover your face. Look like you’re crying.”
“Snowball? What the hell kind of name is that?” Dean grabbed a carton of Nails and started restocking the shelf.
“Yesterday, you sold cigarettes to a four-year-old. Legal age for smoking is 18. You messed up; you pay the fine.” The man smiled smugly.
Dean dragged his feet as he walked across the yard. While he had been proud of himself, coming up with a solution to handle Cas' bees, it meant that he had to work with Cas' bees. And he was doing it in a costume that he had put away, never to be dragged out again. (That's right, he was glaring at Charlie from a distance without her even knowing.) He stopped at a table that Cas had set up and pulled out the instruction on how to take care of the bees. The first thing he had to do was find that weird metal thing —the smoke can, he remembered— and fill it with Cas' special mixture.
“Cas, I have read this book at least twice a year for the past ten years. I know it like the back of my hand.” Dean huffed as Cas quizzed him for the hundredth time. “It was a book of Proust that Sal knew belonged to Dean.”
“I’m gonna kill him.” Dean dialed his father, and it rang several times before going to voicemail. “Fucking hell, I’m going to kill him.”
After several more attempts, including one where Cas had Dean flip the tube, rotating the molten glass over their heads, Cas took a step back from Dean. Despite the temperature of the room around him, Dean instantly felt cold and wanted Cas back. He looked over to Cas, who crossed his arms over his chest, smirking.
Cas rolled his eyes and slowly turned his phone, showing Dean his purchase. In a matter of seconds, Dean went through the five stages of grief, knowing that he'd been caught. "You saw."
"Earth to Dean?" Cas took a step closer, a smirk curling upon his lips. "There you are. Ready to slide that in the furnace?"
“I get the feeling Castiel still doesn’t like me.” Cassie quipped once Cas had left. Another customer had entered the store, and she stepped to the side so he could make his purchase. “You would think that time would have fixed that.”
“I knew you would, Dean.” Cas smiled softly as he took the test and flipped through it. “Looks like you scored higher than me, too.”
“Why, cause I’m telling it like it is?” The guy leaned forward and jabbed a finger at Dean. “Are you afraid of the truth?”
“I never wanted you to stop talking to us, Cas. I wanted you in my life. And even if it took a clue by four to make me realize that your feelings were reciprocated, they always have been.” Dean rested his forehead in the crook of Cas’ neck. “I haven’t wanted anyone but you.”
He quickly cleaned up his station, waved goodbye to the group, and made his way out to his car. Without a doubt, Dean knew he would be having a repeat of last week when he got home.
“Christ, Sammy. Fine.” Dean attempted to relax down into the pillow and turned his head towards Cas. “How long has he been out for?”
“Sarah Blake. I was a year ahead of you in high school.” She points at Dean. “Cassie cheating on you was the scandal of my sophomore year. Have you heard she’s marrying her college sweetheart?”
“Dammit. Should have known I was being suckered.” Dean’s opponent kicked at the leg of the table as Dean sunk the eight ball in the called corner pocket. “You lost that first game too easily.” The man pulled out his wallet and threw the extra cash on the table before Dean handed him back a twenty.
“Sir.” The unknown person interjected again. “Were you here between the hours of noon and three PM yesterday?”
“You still planning on joining me and Charlie at KU?” Dean leaned forward and rested his chin on his fists. “I could request you as my roommate.”
Dean peeked over his laptop and looked at Cas. "Sunshine, I told you, we'll be okay. The severance package they gave you will float us, and I'm still working. You can sit back and take a breather."
“The puncture is larger than we thought.” Sam ran his fingers through his hair and looked at Cas. “I don’t want to pull him out yet, but if you’re up and moving, we risk fluids getting in your lung.”
“Not my problem.” Dean’s eyes slowly fluttered open. “You’re the one who shouldn’t have had so much to drink if you knew you had to work today.”
Once the hive appeared to be completely settled, Dean took a deep breath and pulled out the first frame. He stared at it in amazement, having never been so close to live honeycomb before. A bee was on it, and Dean watched as it continued to work without a care in the world. He smiled softly and, though he would never admit it, he could start to understand why these little guys meant so much to Cas. He went through the rotating process, as Cas had documented, cleaning out debris, making sure there were no dead bees, and taking note of how full the frames were. Once completed, his smile broadened. While he still shivered at the thought of the bees crawling all over him, he knew he could do it. He'd take care of the little fuckers until Cas could get back to it himself.
"And with good reason, it appears." Cas took Dean's hand and held it tightly. "Dean, do you know how much you mean to me?"
“Hello, Dean.” The sound of a Tupperware container hitting the counter made Dean look up. “I’m assuming you didn’t bring lunch.”
The asshole smiled at Dean. “Oh, here it comes. The speech about how he’s just doing his job and following orders.” He looked back at the—
“No!” He took a few more steps away from the counter and stared at Dean. “You go for the things that keep you mediocre. You don’t want to be here? Find courage and leave. You want to be a better person? Then go find the people who make you better! It’s not Lisa or Cassie.” Cas hangs his head and looks at his hands as the tears start to build up in the corners of his eyes. “But it’s sure as hell not me.” He looks back up at Dean as the first tear slides down his cheek. “I thought, maybe. Just maybe, I was doing the right thing. But I’m just as selfish as them. I was afraid to lose the man I love to the greater things he was meant for.”
"I know that my return is surprising you, especially considering that I said I would be gone for a day or two. But it seems like something else has caught you off guard.”
Dean bit his bottom lip, fighting back what he really wanted to say. “You could have asked one of the other employees.”
Dean's classmates cheered in excitement. Dean shivered. It was not lost on him how Cas said those words, how he had looked Dean square in the eye.
“I’m saying we yell at each other to have faith in the people we love, we let them handle the Fomorian, and then we tell them how we feel. Think you can handle that, Hasselhoff?”
“I agree.” Dean handed Frank his change. Cas turned away, giving them both a bit of a cold shoulder. “You have a good day, Sir.” Once Frank left the shop, Dean turned to Cas, looking at his friend’s back. “Alright, spill it.”
"Figured I'd bring a gift. Combination of holidays, and ‘I'm sorry I outed you to our friend group.’" Garth held up a basket as he entered. "It's got some of your favorite candies in there, some popcorn, some..." His voice trailed off as he saw Cas on the couch, curled up under a blanket. "Hey, Cas."
Dean turned his head slowly, afraid to see what had spooked Cassie into hysterics. It took a moment to comprehend what he saw, but he quickly put two and two together when he did. The customer from earlier, who would buy a porno then run to the bathroom, was sitting on the toilet. Dead. His head was rolled back, his face staring up at the ceiling. However, the most unnerving part was the rock-hard cock that stood glistening from a particular kind of moisture.
Lisa tugged on his hair, causing him to yelp. “No one said you both couldn’t leave or chase your own dreams. You have a weird sense of loyalty to your father. It’s almost like Stockholm Syndrome or something.”
Cas released Dean’s cock and focused on driving every movement deeper and harder, hoping that this release would be the one to free him from the siren’s venom. He tumbled over the edge, collapsing on top of Dean as he filled his hunter for the second time. Cas lay there for a moment, catching his breath and worshipping Dean’s body with small kisses. “I’m sorry.”
“Fine.” Lisa nodded and crossed to the door. “For what it’s worth, though, you and Cas? I believe that before I believe you trying to get back with Cassie. But I know you’re too chicken shit to make a move.” She stormed out of the store, the door slamming shut behind her.
"I'm not ashamed of you, Cas. I just... I love our friends, but we're already so up in one another's business. Having this to ourselves? Call me selfish, but I liked only us knowing."
“Oh my god, Dean. He’s just as scared as you. The thing took Cas when he confessed his feelings, so he never got to hear yours. He probably thought he’d never see you again. It’s probably easier for him to deny saying it by faking amnesia than to have to hear you say that you don’t love him.” She grabbed Dean’s arm and turned him around, leading him back towards the parking lot. “I can’t believe I live in a fucking rom-com.”
“There’s no way in hell you’ve been waiting nearly fifteen years to apologize.” Dean rolled his eyes. “Hell, you saw me here in town on multiple occasions when you came home to visit your folks, and you never once apologized then.”
“I know it’s not.” Dean’s face warmed up at the small gesture. “You won’t let me think that anyway.”
Dean froze, his eyes locked on Cas’. He heard the words that Cas said. He understood what they meant. But they didn’t belong to Dean. He couldn’t keep them.  “I’m sorry, Cas.”
“You’re such a fucking idiot.” Cas backed off. “You deserve to be loved, to be cherished. And I can tell you right now that Cassie is not that person.”
“Only a little.” Dean slid his hands out of his pockets and wiped them down on his jeans. “Claire just needed a nudge in the right direction.”
“Nah, get your closure. You know me and enclosed spaces with too many people.” Cas held out his hand for Dean’s keys.
“Don’t. He, uh. He needs this. I told you I would listen.” Dean delicately set his arm down over his head, wincing as he stretched out the mended muscle. The air conditioner kicked on, the only noise in the room until Dean spoke up again. “How did he react?”
“Hush, Cas.” Dean turned to the customer. “My friend here believes that the contractors working on the uncompleted Death Star were innocent victims when the space station was destroyed by the rebels.”
Once Cas made his way between Dean’s legs, he stood up and pulled down on Dean’s jeans and underwear, releasing his throbbing cock from where it had been locked away. Uncaring about the fabric tangled around Dean’s ankles and the shoes still on his feet, Cas focused his mouth on Dean’s inner thigh, biting and sucking until a deep rouge mark appeared. “You are mine.”
After closing the door, Sam took over as Baby’s driver. He angled the rearview mirror so he could see out the rear window as well as watch Cas and Dean. Sam started the engine and began to drive. “Do we risk the night at the motel, or am I taking us back to the Bunker?” His eyes met Cas’ as the question rolled off of his tongue.
“I’ll take whatever he gets, but if there are mushrooms, hold them, please,” Cas asked politely, his hands folded in his lap. “I’m not fond of them.”
"See if I make you any bacon, you ass." Dean smiled and pressed a kiss to Cas' cheek. "So you gonna tell me what happened after I left?"
Dean fell forward, his forehead smacking against the back cushions of the couch. "I hate you so much, Cas. I hate you." He pushed himself back up to sitting, smiling at Cas' bright and mischievous expression. "And I fucking love you."
Cas waved Gabriel over, and after they put in their orders, he replied to Dean. “It was okay. Mom was wondering if I had submitted my choice of college yet. I told her that the deadline was at the end of the month.”
“Long time no see, Dean.” Cassie was more beautiful than Dean remembered. Her smile was radiant and infectious, and her voice had a bright lilt to it. “Still working the family shop, I see.”
“I do not.” Dean withered under the look Cas shot him. “Not all the time.” Dean got to the end of Lydia’s obituary. “Huh.”
“Perhaps we already do.” Desiree stared up at Cas. “Perhaps he was our target all along. My partner is a sucker for the macho-man type. Says the false bravado and testosterone make the suffering that much sweeter.” She licked her lips, a failed attempt at seduction, before continuing. “Are you sure you don’t want to try my kiss? Let your pretty little human kill you while blissed out?”
"I'm sorry, what?" Dean's eyes went wide as Garth went to grab a mask. "Woah, now. What are you doing with that thing?"
"Why are you asking questions you already know the answer to, Bitch?" The coffee finished percolating, and Dean poured himself a mug. "Something about angel business."
Sam quickly unlocked their door and opened it, entering the room and grabbing the lights. He flicked on the closest light to him and turned just in time to watch Cas lay Dean down on his bed. Sam closed the door before moving to his own bed. “Cas, you said you needed to rest? What do I need to watch for so you can get your grace built back up?”
“I… uh…” Cas started to shake his no but changed to a nod. “You weren’t supposed to know. I know you don’t care about me like that, and I’m okay with that, and I don’t want this to—”
The sound of the phone landing on the bed caused Dean to let out a sigh of relief. Until Cas returned his full focus back on Dean.
Standing next to Cas was another person, shorter with sandy blond hair. He had his arms crossed over his chest, and when he made eye contact with Dean, he smirked and leaned into Cas. He whispered something to Cas, and in turn, Cas rolled his eyes and shook his head.
"Which is an indication of enjoyment." Cas hooked his finger in Dean's collar and pulled him down for a kiss. "Thank you, Dean. I know you didn't want to do any of what you did today, but you did. For me. Even when you had a valid excuse of my suit not fitting you."
"You were so good for me, Boy. I want to hear you. Need to hear you." Cas gripped Dean's hips harshly. "I want to hear you cry out my name."
"Me? What are you talking about? I've been in here since,” He picked up his phone and looked at the time. “Since breakfast." Sam rested his chin on his hands. "Is Cas back?"
“IT’S LITERALLY CALLED ORAL SEX!” Dean threw his hands up in the air. “You said only three guys, Lis!”
Dean let out a small sigh of relief. Cas was a lifesaver, even if she didn’t realize it at this point. “Yeah, it’s Cas. He works next door.”
“I uh, I don’t know how I missed this.” He folded the paper and turned it around. It was the obituaries. At the top in the center, a name caught his attention.
Victor put his change in his wallet and pocket. “Doc may say that you’re fine, but do you feel fine? Looks like you got some extra weight that we could turn into muscle.”
“Thought you weren’t working today?” Ash brought what Dean hoped was a cigarette to his lips. “I would have dressed up nicer for you.” The mulleted man spun around, showing off his ever-present hoodie, adorned with patches and buttons of various bands and movements. John repeatedly told Dean to chase Ash and his friend Charlie - currently dressed in her long black trenchcoat - off the property.
"Uh, yeah. Yes. Sure. I can do that." Dean stammered as he walked up to the furnace. Cas opened the door, and Dean started to gather the glass on the end of the pipe.
“And I promise you’ll have me. Anyway you want me.” Dean crossed over to his beer, taking a sniff as he picked it up. Before it got to his lips, he stopped and took another inhale. “Shit. The siren did get you.” He found an empty glass and poured the beer into it, showing the off-color liquid. “Fuck, Cas. They got my beer. You didn’t notice and drank it. You didn’t have a chance to prepare.” He swallowed harshly as Cas stepped into his personal space again. “Cas, I promise you, let me get us back to the hotel room, and we can work this out of your system.”
Dean cried out in relief as Cas reached around him. The hand that had denied him orgasm was now bringing him to it. "Cas! Cas! Fuck. Holy shit, I'm coming." Dean collapsed into the bed, his knees and arms shaky as his body pulsed in pleasure. "Holy hell, Cas." He looked over, his eyes half-lidded as Cas removed the spreader bar from his ankles. "Did you seriously just take a phone interview in the middle of a scene?"
“Shut up,” Dean murmured as he wrapped his arms around Cas’ neck and pulled him in for a kiss. “I may not be as young as I once was, but I’ll make damn sure to keep up with you tonight, as best I can.” He ground down against Cas’ cock, already hardening inside him again. “Fuck, Cas. I know you recover quickly, but that?”
“I know you know this, Dean. But I have to look like I’m at least putting in the effort to get your grades back up to snuff.” Cas shook his head. “What real-life person does Camille represent?”
Cas raised his chin defiantly before taking off his shoes and suit jacket. He laid it with his trench before moving to the open space on the bed next to Dean. Cas sat down, tucking his legs into a cross-legged position. “I’ll be okay here, Sam.”
“Alistair?” Dean stood up next to her and leaned on the counter. He eyed the man up and down, noting the disheveled appearance.
Dean nodded and pulled his phone out of his pocket. He shot off a quick text before meeting up with Sam.
“Better me than her.” Claire stopped. “Would you be willing to let a freshly human Cas go up against the Fomorian?”
After several minutes, Cas had finished blowing the glass into a sphere and pulled the blowpipe away from his mouth. He met Dean's eyes briefly and smirked before looking at Gabriel and Balthazar. "Think you can get your teams making these?"
“Then what did I just say, Cas?” Dean smacked the paper down again. “Cas!” His best friend was frowning, tears welling in his eyes. “Cas?”
Dean slammed his fists on the counter. “That’s it, if you’re buying something, buy it. Otherwise, get the fuck out!”
"Well, your secret is safe with me, believe it or not." Garth offered them both a smile. "But honestly, not a single one of us would judge you, and if you're afraid of being judged by others, know that we have your back." Garth nodded and headed towards the door. "See you guys at the next trivia night." He exited, pulling the door shut behind him.
Dean nodded and ran to the bar, tossing a pair of twenties on the counter. He returned to Cas just as quickly and grabbed his hand, leading him out of the establishment. “Sorry, Cas. I should have been more careful with my drink.”
"You really want to know?" Dean blushed bright red and pointed down at his crotch. "Needed to take care of something."
"Well, now that you all know what we're doing, let's go." Cas clapped his hands together and led the group over to the central furnace he had shown them the previous week. "You guys will be using the furnace closer to the benches, but this is our largest, and you'll all be able to see what I'm doing."
“So, no. You’re not.” Claire shook her head and laughed. “You’re standing there, preaching to me about telling someone you love them and protecting them. You’re doing the same damn thing with Cas.”
Dean was sitting up in the bed, shirtless, and his blanket pulled up over his lap. Around Dean’s waist, a sleeping Cas had wrapped his arms, hugging Dean tightly even as he slumbered and regained his grace.
“Because I’m not sure that I actually want to marry Dagon. At least not without knowing one thing.” Cassie’s voice was frantic but soft. The bell over the door chimed, and Cassie startled before leaning in closer to finish her thought. “I’ve never gotten over you.” She looked up at Dean, her big doe eyes starting to water with the threat of tears.
