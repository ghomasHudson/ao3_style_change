John looks at his friend’s red-rimmed eyes and his heart shatters. Sherlock has been clean for a long time but his history with substance abuse has come back to haunt him at the worst possible occasion. On one hand, John understands the reluctance in giving oxy or morphine to an addict. On the other hand, a one-time administration hasn’t been linked to significant relapses, and even when relapse risk exists, treatment with opioids can be carefully administered. Had they at least considered a spasmolytic?
It will happen soon enough, I am sure.
‘Who could do this’ is a new one, though. Especially in that tone, as if Sherlock cannot quite believe mankind would stoop as low as… well, whatever he was reading.
“Sh-Sherlock Holmes. That’s… not what people usually say.”

“Sherlock, for the love of god,
The exchange with Victor leaves John exhausted and coiled like a spring. Wrapped in his thoughts, he is surprised to find Mycroft in the corridor, who asks for a word in private.
Grudgingly, Sherlock acquiesces. “Very well. Although the Grammys are the last thing I want to have on my mind. Insufferable bonfire of vanities.” He throws himself on the chair next to Mycroft’s bed.
It’s a struggle to even lift his feet to go upstairs. Seventeen steps that feel like a thousand. But up he goes, following John into the flat. From his gait, John is in no better shape.
“They used
, “it could have been
Sherlock grunted a ‘Hm.’
John sighs and reaches for his tea again. He breathes in the soothing bergamot notes of the Earl Grey. Greg had not been in the same division as John in MI5, but they had met regularly and developed something of a camaraderie, before John enlisted to be shipped off to Afghanistan. But celebrities!
Or Sherlock’s, it seems.
“What’s that? I thought you had something against ‘brainless screeching masses’, if I may quote you directly,” he replies without heat.
“Ridiculous. Why not be transported to London? We could put you in a private clinic. Or have the necessary equipment at home,” Sherlock huffs. He wants to return home but cannot abide to leave his brother behind.
at it, John!” Sherlock shoves the phone accusatorily at John. “Who could
“Hmm, maybe so.” John smooths a hand up Sherlock’s body and lands it on his face, a thumb swiping gently on his cheekbone. “But I could still sense your brain working a bit extra. What’s on your mind?”
John is now proper alarmed, but he soldiers on. Whatever— no,
He still remembers bits of what happened after, even though he tries to drown his memories in dregs of cooling tea and relentless work on his newfound patch of solitude. How he stood and left the patisserie without another word. How John rushed after him, calling out his name with increasing urgency. How Sherlock shouted back at him, how he didn’t need charity, he didn’t need help, he didn’t need fucking cake, he didn’t need John. How John flinched at his harsh words. How Sherlock continued with
John collapses on top of Sherlock; they slide arms around each other’s sweaty bodies in a careful, loving embrace. They roll onto their sides in a loose hug and stay like that for long minutes. They kiss, slow, between pants of exhaustion, nuzzling noses on cheeks and necks and sweet spots behind ears and temples. John brushes mussed up curls from Sherlock’s forehead, and the gesture is so affectionate it shatters something inside Sherlock’s chest.
, John.” There is a begging tone in Sherlock’s request that John cannot ignore; he therefore sits back without a single word.
Tonight, they sleep.
“Two hours, John, quite basic arpeggios, really.” He lowered the violin into its case, and loosened the bow.
. Quite suddenly, John is receiving answers to questions he asked himself a long time ago, and to questions he never dared asking at all.
“Tut tut,” Mycroft continues, “the man cares for you but is terrified. Trust issues, I suppose. Quite interesting, as he seems to be nearly fearless otherwise. But when it comes to you…to the perspective of
“Take me through the details of this terrorist plot.”
The name makes bile rise in John’s throat, bitter and rancorous. “The smarmy tosser you locked yourself with in the office for a shag?” John waves his mobile around, which prompts a half-hearted tinny protest from Greg.
There’s something about the keys that niggles John. He has a similar set – access to all areas of the house is essential to his work.
Greg cringes, guilt invading him with the memory of the last press conference he ever convinced Sherlock to attend. Fair point, he has to admit. Sherlock unpacking the deerstalker and being coaxed into wearing it in front of dozens of cameras, a fake smile plastered on his face, looking like he wanted to be a million miles away.
When Mycroft leans in and places a kiss on John’s lips, John is so surprised he doesn’t immediately react.
John jingles the car keys. “Could you help me unload the car? I feel I brought half of the house with me, but you cannot imagine the amount of crap she needs.”
Usually, the vehicle simply takes John wherever Mycroft is, whether this is the Diogenes, his office in Vauxhall or, on one memorable and rather disconcerting occasion, his townhouse in Belgravia. Which is why John is surprised to see Mycroft in the car.
The world seems to be unaware of the push and pull between the men.
"Pain is a landscape."
Later that day, John gets a formal note asking him to escort Mr Holmes on a shopping trip.
Irene narrows her eyes at Richard. She grabs his arm none too gently but he shakes it off and slides past Sherlock, locking eyes with him.
“Well, naturally everything wears out with time, but these come with a five-year guarantee. And,
“Dishonest?” Mary’s eyebrows raise in ill-disguised fake surprise. “I don’t know what you are talking about. Have we not always been very…honest with each other?” She lays a hand on his forearm, which John shakes off immediately.
Ellie looks around in awe. She has stepped in what is obviously the living-room, large windows facing the darkening Baker Street, a few snowflakes still lingering on the window panes, framed by heavy curtains. The old-fashioned damask wallpaper would give the room an oppressive atmosphere but whoever decorated the flat used different colours and patterns on all walls, giving it a modern touch. Then, there’s the décor: eclectic, heavy bookshelves sighing with the weight of old tomes in contrast with glass display cabinets.
Richard places his hands firmly on Sherlock’s waist and drags him until they are chest to chest.
What worries Sherlock now is how distant and distracted John is.
“No, I mean she’s not down there. Nowhere to be seen.” Sherlock looks up and around, perhaps hoping to see a dangling ninja on the roof.
And Sherlock isn’t blind either. He has noticed how Mycroft has been following John with more interest than a mere professional one. It’s only the fact he almost lost Mycroft to a bullet that stops him from letting the ugly blackness of jealousy take over completely.
“You have to tell me about these outings, Victor.”
John raises an eyebrow. “His life?” John does not wait for an answer: he walks down to get closer to Sherlock, and arrives just in time to hold back an overeager fan trying to climb up to the stage.
Greg seems to sense she is fibbing and goes straight for the kill. “You said he isn’t
. This ficlet is dedicated to
“Stop thinking so loud, John. My voice is fine. I’m a bit sore but I don’t think I’ll need additional medical attention. I have you.” He opens his eyes and looks up at John from between thick, dark lashes. Their position is intimate, John standing in the vee of Sherlock’s spread legs, a hand holding the ice and the other on Sherlock’s shoulder. John fights the impulse to caress those impossibly soft curls. Sherlock must have put up a good fight to be able to fend off someone who surprised him with intent to kill, and fondness fills him for this impossibly beautiful, talented man. He knows he can’t touch Sherlock again – it’s not his place, and it’s clear it will only end badly for all involved. But John cannot help feeling tender and protective of him, and he decides to at least not fight that.
As she quickly cries these words at a very confused Sherlock, John comes out of Sherlock’s bedroom with a box in his hands. “Hello, Mrs Hudson; everything alright?”
John throws an incredulous look at him.
The realisation punches Sherlock in the chest. He’s pacing the sitting room, and his footsteps echo, and have they always done so? He had not noticed how every sound he makes in this house reverberates freely, without suffering interference from other sound waves produced by other people. Voices, laughter, shouting, telly. It is only Sherlock who produces noise, the cottage otherwise quiet as a crypt, a premature tomb for the one living soul between these four walls.
“Richard Brook.”
“You’re technically not my employer so I’d rather have my contract terminated by Sherlock himself,” John replies while taking a longer look at the keys. “By the way, I hope those aren’t house keys you’ve just left lying around.”
“Are we alright?” John whispers.
He smiles at me, and the room is filled with sunlight again despite the late hour.
“I mean,” Sherlock clarifies with a smirk, “would you like to dance?”
The meal is a veritable feast for the senses, but the food is the less important piece. Across from him sits John, happily tucking away in other offerings from the steaming baskets. He sends Sherlock the occasional smile, a beautiful thing that reaches his eyes.
an addict. And there’s very little in this world that will prevent him to go out and get high.
This thought energises Sherlock to get up and go inside, find the morning newspaper and slap it decidedly on top the letter. He’ll forget about its existence, probably burn it the next time he lights a fire, an epistolary Schrödinger forever lost and unknown.
“No.”
John grumbles an inaudible reply against Sherlock’s chest. He was having quite the lovely lazy morning in his lover’s arms, all soft-sleepy, waking up slowly to find himself comfortably nestled against Sherlock’s naked form.
Sherlock clenches his teeth but does not turn around. “In a minute,
It’s Sherlock’s turn to look shocked at Mycroft’s outburst but he composes himself quickly enough and adds softly, “Please, brother mine, let’s not discuss motivations and excuses. I’ll take the Eastern Europe job.”
They drive into Soho’s madness of neon and people spilling onto the streets, and as the car turns a corner to the Mayan, John groans. There is a massive crowd blocking the road, police and the club’s security trying to put order to the chaos and clear a way for them. Sherlock squares his shoulders. Victor squeals in delight. John rubs a tired hand over his face.

Sherlock rolls his eyes and turns again to the microscope. “I’m
on his way to certain death anyway. Might as well have some fun. Better life through chemistry and all that rot.
“What’s the rush?” John jogs to keep up. “We have the whole day. Plenty to see and ride on.”
“That’s great, Sherlock! And even if it does not work, you’ll still have had some fun. Nothing lost, right?” John’s imagination starts running loose: they could go on a day trip to Thorpe Park, perhaps even stay a night in the area, take Sherlock to a nice restaurant as a reward…

“It is not too late, little brother,” a tired Mycroft mumbles, his eyes fluttering shut with exhaustion.
John let those slip away easily enough.
John throws him a ‘don’t worry’ shake of his head.
When he returns to his room, he’s surprised to see Sherlock half-lying on the bed, nose buried in John’s pillow but naked feet still on the floor. John helps him gently to sit up, makes him take the pills and the glass of water. He takes in his friend’s misery, a downturned mouth, shallow breathing, rigidity fighting exhaustion. Before he thinks too much about it, he eases Sherlock back down on the mattress, walks around the bed and goes in under the duvet. “Try to rest a bit for now. We’ll go to the surgery as soon as possible, yeah?”
Sherlock cuts the halves in perfect quarters and throws them in the blender. He doesn’t answer.
“Do you understand how much of my brother’s heart is in your hands,” Mycroft whispers sadly.
A few days pass. Sherlock still complains about intermittent pain, but in general it seems to be gradually disappearing. The urine culture comes back negative for bacteria, and Sherlock manages pain with NSAIDs under John’s watchful eye.
“Deal.”
“I’ve had enough of your destroying my lab equipment because something sent you in a strop. Sit the bloody hell down on that stool and drink the damn tea!” She points to a seat just behind Sherlock with one of the mugs, sloshing a few drops over the rim.
, John. Gay. Very,
Oh, no. This is not at all how Sherlock had envisioned the conversation going. “I am indebted to your friendship, which I treasure above everything else in the world, but she is carrying your child, she is your wife, the woman you chose to spend the rest of your life with…” Sherlock trails off as he watches John’s expression turning anger into incredulity. He decides to shut up.
Throwing himself onto his leather armchair, Sherlock closes his eyes and steeples his hands, fingertips brushing absent-mindedly at his lips. Something is nagging him at the back of his mind, related to this increased theatre of security being raised around him. There’s something he doesn’t know.
The day goes to shit.
Sherlock loses his – admittedly short – patience. “What are you doing here?” The question is harsher than he intended but he doesn’t regret the tone. What
Christmas comes and goes; Sherlock scoffs the holidays away, locked in his flat while his staff are mostly off celebrating, and John is not feeling festive, so it’s all business as usual. As time counts down to New Year’s, the house swims again in the frenzy of holidays. Yet, the festive cheer is dampened by the visible tension between John and Sherlock; everybody senses the chilliness in their over-polite exchanges but no one dares to comment on it. Sherlock throws himself at his work, choreographing a brand new routine for the Grammy Awards ceremony less than two months away. John goes back and forth with his resolution to stay – he doesn’t really need the money, he chastises himself over his involvement with his client, he knows he’s emotionally invested…and this is the reason why he can’t decide to pack up and leave. Even with the air between them frostier than December mornings, John convinces himself his sense of duty trumps whatever grudges Sherlock may still hold against him.
“Little brother, someone
“We needed a decoy.”
; does it mean he is in? Is he doing some obnoxious experiment in the flat again?”
This time, John stays outside the fitting room while Sherlock tries on one garment after the other, leaving without purchasing a single one.
John sends him a sympathetic smile. “Oh Sherlock. I’m afraid you
“You still don’t trust me.”
“Hmm. Hopefully, it will not happen during the winter season.”
Sherlock bit his lower lip. “
“You could say so,” John answers. “Going somewhere?”
And there, right at the end, the hitherto unspoken words that now land without a chance of being taken back:
“Uh, bedroom incident?” John asks, one eyebrow raised.
activity is pointless. If it’s in the past, why cling on to it? One cannot relive it to the full extent of the original occasion — especially if it was a particularly joyous one.
They were on the sofa, laptop on the coffee table, abandoned plates after nibbling on some finger food. It was late, outdoor sounds muffled by a fresh blanket of snow.
John murmurs a thank-you and advances cautiously, avoiding a couple of burly men carrying wood planks; he can hear vigorous hammering and drilling not far off. He peeks in a couple of rooms: a large living room, as extravagantly decorated as the foyer, with white leather sofas, velvet curtains draping French doors, gilded details here and there, a faint smell of furniture polish; another room seems to be more of an office, with shelves filled with awards, walls covered in marketing photos and magazine covers of Sherlock and a mishmash of accolades. From the window in this room, John can see the swimming-pool; despite the incoming winter season, the pool is filled with clean water, probably warmed. In contrast to the buzzing occurring out in the corridor, these rooms are devoid of people, immaculate, pristine.
“About…” Sherlock prompts.
“I want him gone.”
Sherlock seems to read his mind. “Yes, I also thought it was a long wait, was told they’re very booked and as long as my symptoms don’t evolve, I should be fine.”
sounds from the flat above. Mrs Hudson flinches but recovers quickly. “I suppose you could call it that, an experiment of sorts.” She smiles unconvincingly and sips her tea.
The dark curls bob. “Who?”
“No, can’t say I’ve heard that name.”
, he tells himself,
John rises slowly from his chair, walks around the table, stops a few inches from his friend.
“What’s going on?” she asks with a yawn.
“I upset you with my…” Sherlock just does a wide movement, encompassing loosely everything on the table and around them.
He certainly never brought a man here. That sort of encounter happened elsewhere.
“Of course you’re my best friend.”
Sherlock’s moue is all John needs as confirmation. Not an unusual occurrence – a full bladder combined with, John reasons, contrast being injected in a rather lengthy examination is enough to push a lot of people just onto the wrong side of ‘needing to go to the loo’. A few seconds after injecting contrast, most people feel hot all over and a pressure in the bladder. Some people can’t avoid it, and the result is a wet table and an embarrassed patient. He had certainly heard enough stories from radiology personnel to know this was a common event. Being the proud man Sherlock is, this would have been a truly mortifying experience for him.
“Hmm. Could it be applied as prophylaxis, you gather?”
Sherlock has the audacity to laugh heartily at John’s suggestions – or his embarrassment. “I think we skip the alternative methods. I don’t know which one is more ludicrous.”
[University reader in molecular biology,
Molly's eyes widened. “Um, I’m just. I’ll go and get some coffee. Or tea. Or anything, really.” She all but ran out of the room before John could bid a proper farewell.
“Hmm,” Mycroft hums, “indeed it is so, and it would be prudent to not ignore this fact.”
Ignoring the already-made smoothie, Sherlock picks up the knife and starts slicing an unpeeled banana. “‘
“You… learned how to play this in two days?”
John is now thoroughly confused. “Presumably, anyone with a saucepan and the right ingredients?”
Still, John insisted both he and Irene would accompany Sherlock. Irene sits in the backseat next to Sherlock, who is engrossed in his mobile, looking sharply around the slow-rolling landscape. John sits next to Molly, keeping an eye on the rear-view mirror and another on the approaching busy crossings of Pimlico.
John closed the lid on his laptop.
“At least let me ring you a cab. And if you change your mind, just call me and I’ll be right there.”
And whose fault is that? Every time Sherlock turned his back, John spiked their drinks with shots of this and that. What the hell had he been thinking? Why had he done that?
. Or something akin to that; John doesn’t care much about that sort of rubbish telly. They seem to be filming something, as there is a cameraman moving about, strong floodlights focused on the stage but no other lighting in the room. Scattered over the room are several armchairs; John spots Greg in one of them and gets his attention with a wave of his hand. Greg waves back and starts moving towards him.
Unacceptable. But there’s nothing for it: we will have to keep her happy. For now.
The traffic into Belgravia is blessedly less heavy, and Molly is able to snake her way around slower cars to put distance between them and their pursuer. As she focuses on navigating the streets of London towards Mayfair, John looks around for the black car.
His fingertips flutter over greedy hands extending from the sweaty mob, taunting, promising. His shorts are digging into the crack of his arse, the fishnet tights are itchy, the metallic top is the single most uncomfortable thing he has ever worn but he is making it all work, and that is all that matters. This performance is flashier and more extravagant than his usual fare, an attempt to get out of his comfort zone and gain a wider audience. And the venue was carefully chosen to cater to the not insignificant number of his LGBT+ followers. He focuses on the moment, on the performance, on the music, on his routine.
“Hmm, indeed. Tacky entertainment for the brainless masses.”
John nudges Sherlock with an elbow. “Having fun, after all?” A light-hearted tease that prompts an easy smile on his companion.
John sighs. “Let me put the kettle on. Might as well have some bloody tea if we’re not going back to sleep.”
“Okay. Okay, Greg. Five minutes. Show me what you’ve got.”
Does the real John miss him? Does he miss him like Sherlock misses John?
John opens the door wider and lets Greg in the flat. Greg takes off his coat – the late autumn morning is sunny but chilly. He hangs the coat next to the door and takes an appreciative look around. John’s flat is small but tidy, almost minimalistic, the hallmark of a man with ingrained military habits. The kitchen shares an open plan with the living-room, running along one wall.
“Hello there, dear; can I help you?”
“There’s always nutcases writing rubbish on social media every time Sherlock makes the cover of a magazine,” Victor cuts in from his phone call, to which he returns promptly, “Yes, of course I’m listening, dear…”
“Those are letters from just last week. Some are print-outs of emails and stuff posted anonymously on social media.” Greg sits on a second armchair.
Greg raises placating hands. “I will talk to him.”
After a few laps, Sherlock slows down to a stop by a small gravel path that snakes up to the back patio. “Thank you for your company, John,” Sherlock exhales as he controls his breathing, still quick after their run.
Greg glances at Sherlock, trying to gauge whether the man is hurt by John’s blatant lack of confidence in Sherlock’s diplomatic skills. But all he sees is Sherlock trying to supress a smile while adding, “I am certainly not investing any intellectual work on this inanity. Might as well do as John suggests.”
“To you, you berk,” John huffs with an eye-roll, trying for levity. But he is wary, waves of uncertainty wafting from his tense posture, that little pinched wrinkle on his forehead that tells Sherlock tales of unslept nights and worry-filled days. “For the thing. In the morgue. For the…” He gestures towards Sherlock’s head. “The beating.”
before the more conscious part shakes such thoughts away. Sherlock seems confused at his own words. On the other hand, his face has gone through so many different grimaces in the last hour John can’t really read him any longer.
– and lets him continue. “There’s a nurse to collect blood, and another gave me a cup to pee in. The toilet was just around the corner, but it took me forever to get there. And then they collected the cup and then I waited. And waited. Most of the time I spent in that godawful place, I waited, John. There was a privacy curtain drawn around the gurney, but it doesn’t really block anything now, does it?
In the shroud of a badly illuminated sitting room, John’s eyes are feral and menacing, and the intimidating step forward while he shouted made Sherlock flinch and recoil. He chastises himself for displaying such weakness, but what can he do? His body still remembers even if his head has tried to forget.
The car rolls to a stop; John grabs his groceries and jumps out. Before slamming the door shut, he looks in one last time. “Try harder, next time.”
“I wanted you not to be dead.”
They both jump in their seats at the sound of china breaking on the kitchen floor, followed by a muffled ‘Bugger!’ from behind the closed door.
In the end, it is not hard to spot: the location is guarded by a high wall that blocks prying eyes. It’s a bit of an eyesore in the otherwise open and friendly character of the district. John finds the road to the main gate, which is a complicated wrought-iron affair; he stops in front of the gate and locates the tired-looking intercom on the wall. He presses a button, frowning at the crackling static noise that accompanies a disinterested male voice:
“‘I have nothing, you have everything. Soon, you will be nothing, drowning in your bathtub, in your blood,’” John reads out loud. He picks another one, “‘I will have the privilege of your last heartbeat, after I carve it out of your chest.’ Christ. How many of these did he get?”
The day after Boxing Day, John is asked to inspect the mail, as a small box had arrived in the middle of fan letters. It’s wrapped in brown paper and the address is written in anonymous block letters.
“Rock’n’
Sherlock exhales a long, weary sigh and in the same breath asks, “So I
“Hello there, little one. Not much of a guard dog, though, are you?” He’s gentle with the terrier, who tries to lick his face, hands, and whatever he can reach.
John grinds his teeth, staring at Sherlock. “Yeah, let’s do that.” His eyes finally slide away from Sherlock’s and to his mobile screen. “Sorry, Greg.”
John clears his throat and turns to Ellie. “So. How is DI Hardy doing?”
They smile softly at each other, the air between them a little clearer and a little lighter. The clatter of the dining room dims down as the notes of a new song float from the old speakers on the dance floor. John recognises it – it’s Dolly Parton’s
“What exactly are your intentions towards my brother?”
As Sherlock’s warm voice utters
Greg pulls her gently by her arm until they are out of hearing range. “Everything alright with you?”
“I just did.” Victor slams the door shut.
I am an imbecile and John is a genius. Apparently, I forgot to account for the most important parameter:
“You… you want me?”
“Alright, alright, I’m awake, Christ!” John jumps off the armchair and looks around, trying to find the threat. “What happened?”
“I worry about him. Constantly.” Mycroft tilts his head and bores his eyes into John’s. “But I also know he tires quickly of his new toys. And thus, I find myself worrying about you, instead.”
Sherlock disappears under the duvet.
Ellie tucks a curl behind her ear and smiles back. “Ah, it’s good to have a few days off. There’s an exhibit on the history of rock at the V&A Tom wanted to go to, so we made a getaway out of it.”
John snaps his head to Victor, who risks a glance at him and mumbles, “It wasn’t me.”
“Guys,” Molly interrupts, fighting a yawn, “could we focus on the problem instead of…other things?”
“It wouldn’t be like last time, Sherlock. I will make sure of it.”
It turns out there is no need for a phone call, as Sherlock receives a letter in the mail that same day. With an appointment for a new CT scan. Three weeks away.
Victor makes a mollifying gesture and backs towards the door. “Alright, darling, we’ll give you some space.” Ignoring John’s venomous glare, he slips out of the room. Irene sighs loudly and follows. Before John steps out, he turns to Sherlock. “I’ll be right out here waiting to take you home.” The door clicks shut behind him.
John has been busying himself with implementing new security measures: setting up CCTV (and making sure someone actually looks at the images) in every dark corner of the property; installing alarms on windows and doors; vetting all personnel and making sure only the minimum possible amount of people visit the house at one time; and even clearing out parts of the garden for a better view. He’s not doing all of this himself, naturally; a carefully chosen crew has been drilling and hammering and cutting and walking all over the place.
, with
The petulant tone makes John grin wider. It’s a good sign if Sherlock is more like himself instead of the pale, subdued version from the last weeks. John makes a half gesture suggesting they take the conversation back to the sitting-room, to which Sherlock acquiesces.
The night outside is inky black; the large French doors facing the courtyard are dark panels, interrupted only by the small, dim lawn light fixtures. Mycroft’s flat across the courtyard is hardly visible – Mycroft is either not home or has already gone to bed. Sherlock stands next to one of the doors, facing the darkness, and turns around to the clinking of crockery.
My stupid mouth moves but does not make a sound; my stupid eyes fill with futile moisture. I reach for the bundle with shaking hands (why are they shaking?) and bury my nose in. I inhale deeply and close my eyes.
The look of perplexity on John’s face matches Sherlock’s own, but soon it becomes clear as Mycroft turns to his brother and explains: “I made a move on John. I am awfully embarrassed by this gauche action of mine. I owe you both an apology.”
“I enjoy my work,” John replies defensively. “I wouldn’t be here otherwise.”
John has answered.
“Ah, here we are, almost done, gentlemen.” If Mr Hardy perceives any tension in the air, his chirpy tone doesn’t betray it.
“Thanks.” John gestures to the sofa. “Have a seat; I’ll put the kettle on.”
Sherlock loses himself in the relentless rhythm, his breath shattering as the onset of an orgasm uncoils from within, and just when he feels he will let go completely, John slows down and stops. He is panting, dilated pupils competing with the indigo blue of his irises, a warm flush reddening his face and neck.
“Although I suppose some posh hotel in London would do–”
The thought of exchanging microbial oral flora should fill anyone with enough horror to never kiss again. Did you know there are around seven hundred species of bacteria and fungus living as biofilms plastered around in diverse cavities of the mouth?
It’s…almost surreal. From the moment John knocked on Sherlock’s flat, announcing it was time to drive to the restaurant, to their return now to his own living quarters, John feels he’s caught in the rapids of a mountain stream, carried by the inevitable current growing faster as the riverbed narrows. He chuckles at himself for the overworked metaphor, although the feeling of being lifted off his feet does not subside.
- he has less than five seconds until he is asphyxiated into unconsciousness.
John has no doubts about popping the big question. At first, he thought Sherlock would not want to get married, that he would ridicule the ceremonial aspect of it all. But, with time, John, who has learned a thing or two about deductions from the world’s only consulting detective, detected the slightest of doubts, the faintest of sorrows, the hint of fear every time they talked about their future.
“Sherlock, the kid was crying after you told him he was in fact eating spiderwebs!” John tries his very best to not laugh.
He just hopes Molly will never have to use her new skill set.
“Hmmm.”
With the first step on the stage, Sherlock pushes away his anger. The clamour of the crowd spurs him forward.
try to find out more about Brook?”
Intense, cramping unilateral back pain that makes the patient restless… “Sherlock, does it burn when you pee?”
“What, then?! It’s a bloody recipe, not a kicked puppy, what’s got into you?”
“What happened?!” John bursts into the dressing room, where Irene and Victor are gathered around a pale but outwardly composed Sherlock. Irene points wordlessly to the computer, where Windows Media Player is paused.
Instead, he put on his professional persona and answered Sherlock. “Ah, that particular model is only sixteen pounds. Very sturdy one, rigid but with good give. Easy to clean, too.”
“No, it’s not– It’s nothing.” John threads nervous fingers through his hair.
That tone. That lost, uncertain, hesitant tone that leaves Sherlock’s lips, one that should not ever be uttered by this beautiful, larger-than-life, confident man, is what finally breaks John’s heart.
Sherlock considers his next step. Should he reply immediately, thus reassuring John? Should he let him stew a bit longer waiting for Sherlock’s reply? He quickly decides against this; he’s not cruel.
John draws back the duvet and gentles Sherlock into bed with a tender but firm grip on his shoulders, and Sherlock follows, eyes heavy-lidded with exhaustion and sleep. As John tucks him in, Sherlock asks in barely a whisper, “Aren’t you going to ask me why I behaved like that?”
Which is precisely the case here, so. No point in celebrating this anniversary anyway.
, John!”
“I must admit the whole venture is proving to be more enjoyable than predicted.”
John becomes instantly more alert. “What about Brighton?”
John and Molly were allowed to stay after explaining they’re Sherlock’s security detail. Even if the clinical setting isn’t a foreign sight to John, this side of the fence is not an easy place to be. Molly rubs a tired hand between John’s shoulder blades, soothing and warm. Mycroft is out of surgery and, while his condition is critical, the prognosis is cautiously optimistic.
John’s careful tone almost hurts more than the bullet wound on Sherlock’s chest. After Mary had shot him, after being bed-ridden for weeks in hospital, John had practically moved back in 221B, assuming the role of caregiver. Sherlock hadn’t asked, and John hadn’t offered; it just had happened. Tentative questions about Mary had been received with dismissive, angry answers or sometimes — and even worse — thick, laden silence. And so, Sherlock had stopped asking, and John had continued to help Sherlock change bandages, eat meals, move around the flat.
They sit close, each on their own towel, near enough to almost share body heat. There’s a cool breeze, and neither have taken off their clothes. Sherlock sorts pebbles into piles according to colour and shape – he didn’t bring a book. All he has is his mobile and his head to lose himself in. He casts furtive glances at John, sees how the sea breeze plays with strands of his silver hair. Contemplates how not so long ago there were more blonde than grey hairs. This look suits John though; it’s a nice complement to the crow’s feet and smile lines, faint but there. Maybe John has had more reasons to smile lately?
, he thinks without wanting to.
“It’s not a game, John.” Sherlock frowns, affronted. “How can you think that of me?”
He looks up from his plate to see John scraping a last piece of tomato while throwing him a shy glance. It’s positively
He turns back to the corridor and passes by a man closing and locking the door to a room John can’t quite manage to peek into. The man does not seem to notice John’s presence and scuttles away. John loses interest in him and takes another glance around: he has the distinct feeling that nobody really uses this part of the house – it’s a trophy place, something flashy to show off. Literally – every metal surface he has spotted is polished to a mirror sheen, adding a bubblegum brightness to what would otherwise be simply very posh rooms. The walls in this hallway are also covered in photos of Sherlock on stage, Sherlock receiving awards, Sherlock in promo photos, Sherlock, Sherlock, Sherlock.
John doesn’t turn to reply, marching to his car. “That was as proper a meeting as necessary, Greg. It was nice to see you; maybe we can grab a pint sometime.”
“Now hold just a damned minute!” John seethes. What the hell? Sherlock had been in no state to take care of himself after the OD on the jet that was supposed to take him into exile.
Their gazes still locked.
“I’ll be fine.”
“Yes, him. You probably don’t know the reason I ended the liaison, though.” Mycroft braces himself for what he has to say. “I found out he was underaged. Barely but still…not legal, and certainly not ethical.”
“Oh. I. My apologies, John. I was inconsiderate. My sympathies–”
“Nonsense, John.” Mycroft raises a placating hand. “I do not share Victor’s opinion on the matter.”
“My goodness, John, that is
“Heh, maybe I can just try to guess what they are hanging on the walls, make my own deductions.” Greg seems to find this immensely amusing, crinkling his eyes with a wide grin and taking another gulp of tea. “I deduce it’s another skull painting. Or more of those drawings of bees.”
Molly emerges from her room, arms crossed against the chill of the night and blinking in confusion.
‘Sofa or armchair?’
Finally, John hears the front door to 221 closing, more of a quiet snick than a slam, and Sherlock’s steps on the staircase. The pace and the gait on the old wooden steps tell John that Sherlock is not free of pain. Concerned, he throws back his duvet and sits up on the mattress, naked feet on the cold floor. He’s about to get up when he realises Sherlock is not stopping at the landing but continuing upstairs. Towards John’s bedroom, instead of his own. Soon enough, there’s a soft rap on his door, and John is already grabbing the handle. Sherlock has not removed his beloved coat, the cold of the late night still clinging onto the fibres, and he’s wearing the most miserable look on his face John has perhaps ever seen.
John didn’t finish his sentence. He had stood up again and was about to organise his products on the stretcher for a proper display when he took in Molly’s horrified expression. “Um, Dr Hooper? Molly, you alright?”
Sherlock looks incredulous at him. “
the right thing to do. And I must be the one taking the step. That's why I am here today, telling you this. It's important.'
Sherlock swallows visibly, but then seems to shake himself off from the momentary state of shock he had fallen into. He smooths down his lapels and straightens his spine. “Victor.” Sherlock steps forward an extends a hand. “Nice to see you. You look… well.”
“Ha, so it is, if I correctly read the fees you take,” Greg jokes, and John is flooded with gratitude at his mate’s deflection.
“I know how you love to play games. And how easily bored you get, and how you strive for change. Why would I… why would
“In a sense, yes. Just about to solve a case. Embezzlement. Something is missing, though.” Sherlock casts a distracted glance at the wall, then focuses back his attention on Ellie. “I did not think you were the type to take random holidays out of season.”
They needed each other to move on. Together.
“Absolutely not,” Sherlock interrupts with a scrunch of his nose, “it’s my property and I’m keeping it. Besides, it is clearly a calcium calculus. Look at the crystalline aggregation and the dark brown speckles, obvious.”
“It’s not like you have to go on a relationship with her–”
In the end, it is the easiest thing in the world to close the distance and pour years of longing and passion into the kiss. To walk into the dark bedroom and remove each other’s clothes. To lie down on cool sheets. To let Sherlock show him how adored John is and always has been. To bond again. To make love to Sherlock Holmes.
The admission arrives quietly: Sherlock is not simply alone – he is lonely, god he is
? What would you care about how I’m feeling!”
at him after
John reaches for his half-pint and quirks up a sad smile. “If someone is truly committed to attempt murder, nothing can stop them.”
John could not hold it any longer. He doubled over laughing. To hell with the lost sales commission; he hadn’t felt this alive in years. Molly tried and failed to look offended, as she furiously pursed her lips to avoid smiling.
Sherlock almost laughs at the absurdity of it all.
Victor looks guilty. “Um, the door wasn’t exactly forced and I’m the only one with the key. I let the staff do maintenance cleaning but that’s it.” He clears his throat. “Maybe I just forgot to lock it that day.”
with Irene Adler! She texts stupid little dinner invitations and crass innuendos just to get a rouse out of me, and quite possibly out of you!”
John Watson is moving into 221b. The question is, will John really take the upstairs bedroom?
He chances a glance at John. Bless his heart – John can sleep anywhere, and the uncomfortable seat is no impediment for a nap. His head lolls against the windowpane, lips slightly open, steady, slow breaths, a relaxed brow.
“John, that’s preposterous. Surely one can measure love through hormonal variations associated with its various manifestations, such as lust, attraction, arousal, affection?”
“Oh wonderful, my budget isn’t very big, so it’s good if it’s a one-time investment.”

And so, Sherlock simply replies full of honesty, “Yes, John. I am alright.”
, John. What sort of perverted souls voluntarily board a flimsy, garishly painted carriage and allow themselves to be subjected to a pointless ride just to experience several
He huffs down the staircase, too worked up to wait for the lift, and storms out of the hotel towards the beach. A brisk walk by the sea, that’s what he needs to clear his head. The sunlight can’t quite compete with the chill from the sea breeze to warm the scenery but John doesn’t feel the cold, the rage within providing an unwelcome source of heat. He walks and walks, and after some twenty minutes of ruminating on the whole situation and realising he’s a fair bit away, he turns back.
Molly bursts into the room. “Bill had spare tyres for his car and was able to jump-start the ignition. He’s making sure the coast is clear. We’re okay to go.”
Sherlock stops and looks up, searching for something. He points up, “There it is!”
“You think there is more glory in protecting politicians than artists, but there’s not. It’s not…I don’t choose clients based on whether they deserve more or less to be protected from harm. Or rather, yeah, I might do, but the choice isn’t based on what they do for a living, but rather…what they are, and what the nature of the threat is.”
Another nod. Sherlock does not make one inch of a move to get into bed.
“—and as you must realise, the chief superintendent wants to use this as a positive reinforcement of the Met’s image to the general public. Such a high-profile case being solved so swiftly, with those kids being rescued before they could be harmed, it’s really stellar.”
“Yeah, tonight. Sure. But I choose the place. And maybe don’t take the shiny metallic suit this time,” John teases gently.
Bill smiles at him. “He did say you were clever. Quite right, I was a nurse.” He follows Sherlock’s line of sight out of the window. “Came back home a couple of months after John. No use for a nurse with severe PTSD. It’s neither here nor there.”
Regret clenches around Sherlock’s heart in a sudden, fierce grip. How could he have been so callous with his friend? His only friend. Sherlock was not lying to get John on his side again, even if John might have thought so – Sherlock has truly never cared for another human being as he does for him.
Because it is. The fine line between being alone and being
A loud buzz unlocks the gate, which starts to open slowly and noisily on its hinges. John shakes his head in incredulity and marches back to the car. His hand on the door handle, he sees a black Land Rover fleeing, tires screeching, from the nearest street corner. John squints – is someone keeping an eye on the front gate? He gets in the car, drives up to the house and finds a small car park where a young woman is sponging a limo.
As he switches to the Jubilee line on Piccadilly, John considers his reasons to have taken Sherlock to Thorpe Park. He is forced to admit to himself it hadn’t all been about the kidney stone. Sure, there

Sherlock doesn’t reply immediately. He seems to be trying to read John’s thoughts, his sharp blue eyes narrowing ever so slightly at him, cool and calculating. “She knows I’m gay. Remember that she ‘knows what people like’?” The quotation marks are obvious in his answer.
Her voice is too chirpy for Sherlock’s foul mood. “Nothing! Absolutely nothing!” He snatches an innocent Erlenmeyer flask from the bench and is about to hurl it against the nearest wall when Molly cuts in with a steely tone:
“Obviously, you are free to reject this proposal if you deem it inappropriate, I fully understand–”
John wishes he had a witty retort but he doesn’t. Sherlock is right. He should’ve been here protecting his client and not letting personal issues affect his work.
John rubs his face, trying to revive himself from the stupor of exhaustion and grief. “Molly…you should go. Get a hotel room for the night.”
!” Sherlock continues to pace the room, hands buried in his curls. He comes to a halt in front of John. “You will tell me everything, right now.”
John nods almost impatiently. “Can I help you with anything, Mycroft?”
“Touch me, John,” he whispers shakily, and John’s eyes widen in wonder, lips parting in a breathy exhale as if releasing some sort of contained anxiety. He fumbles to open the drawer on his bedside table and retrieve a small bottle which Sherlock recognises as lube.
As if on cue, all hell breaks loose.
John frowns at his answer but lets it go for now. “I can’t protect him if he does not understand the danger he’s in.”
Mycroft won’t face him. His eyes are focused somewhere on the floor and he just shakes his head minutely. He opens and closes his mouth a few times, trying to find words. To say that Sherlock is worried would be an understatement – Mycroft has always been the sensible brother, the one who knows what to say when the going gets tough, the one who can find solutions to impossible problems. But he now seems lost for words, adrift in some sort of twisted regret that is painted all over his face. A heavy weight pools inside Sherlock, for he cannot believe Mycroft would hurt him – yet, his behaviour speaks of guilt.

“Yes, yes, now that we’ve established that,” Sherlock interrupts, impatient, “let’s focus on the important subject at hand. The flash drive from the Mayan. I need to listen to the recording again.”

occurred.”
He gets a tired nod as reply and soon enough they are standing, John helping Sherlock remove his long coat and drape it over a chair. He leads Sherlock to the bed, makes him sit on the edge, and sits next to him. He lets a few moments pass, lets Sherlock gather his thoughts and tell his story at his own pace.
John gets a bit antsy to see Sherlock stepping into the vessel, as he had not checked it this morning. “What are you doing?”
Neither of them questions this arrangement. It’s the first night of many to come when they fall asleep in each other’s arms. Tonight, it’s comfort and care; in nights to come, it will be the vulnerability of giving themselves to each other, sometimes passionate and desperate, oftentimes tender and sweet. It will be about filling the cracks with hugs and kisses and intimacy, with laughs and tea and cases. It’s the tangible proof of their love, the sort of love that grows stronger with the years, that survives and blooms brighter after every hardship. The future stretches bright with the promise of togetherness.
John, who tonight shot a man to save Sherlock’s life and now chews on dim sum in a restaurant just around the corner from Baker Street.
“This doesn’t mean…?”
Sherlock stops dead in his tracks and arches a questioning eyebrow at John. “Um. Now that you mention it. You are thinking UTI. Not consistent with back pain, though.”
,” John points out.
“Let me go, Dr Watson,” Mycroft groans, low and dangerous.
“Of course you would accompany me, John, otherwise I’d be alone. Do keep up.” Sherlock’s reply comes out in a huff but contains no heat. His eyes still don’t meet John’s.
John’s first instinct is to break the door down but then he recalls the keys in his pocket and takes them out, quickly unlocks the door, draws his gun, and slams the door open.
Sherlock’s still wearing his clothes from yesterday, barely able to distinguish between ‘yesterday’ and ‘today’ – time seems to have stopped the moment he saw blood sputtering out of Mycroft.
Sherlock sits presently on the (only) narrow bed, elbows on knees, head bowed down, fighting off nausea. The cell is dimly lit, and the late night is quiet and unseasonably warm.
As John opens his mouth to protest, Victor adds quickly, “Look, John, I know what you are thinking – lots of people in the house at all times of the day. It would have been chaos to try and find out who did this. This room is not in use; we have no idea of precisely when the…
“Ummmm, Sherlock, what are you—?”
John aims for a light tone, tries to break the weight of the moment. “Oh, like a vitamin?”
. Sherlock obviously recognises it too as he starts humming along, and glances anew towards the small space, where a few couples sway to the sweet cadence of the ballad.
John closes his eyes and groans. What a mess. He has seen pretty grisly threats to some of the people he has worked for – that being why he’d worked for them in the first place – but the sheer volume of macabre correspondence being thrown at Sherlock is sickening. His alarm bells are ringing – the problem here is more than providing a close eye on the client. He almost feels like this was reason enough to reconsider his decision to walk out of the house and look for another job. He ignores the small voice in his head telling him his reasons to reconsider have less to do with general care for a celebrity than with a pair of sea-coloured eyes reading into his soul. Still…
John freezes with a hand halfway to the kettle and turns around to face Sherlock. What he sees on Sherlock’s expression makes him reach for his mobile instead.
To say John is surprised might be a rather large understatement. He finds himself with a lapful of Sherlock Holmes, clear eyes gazing thoughtfully at him.
hits John like a brick. His face drops, devoid of colour. Ah. He thinks Sherlock is stating he will not forgive John.
Sherlock ignores Greg and instead chats with two of the dancers.
Irene is visibly taken aback with the unexpected retort; John ploughs on, “I’m not here to cater to every whim of his. I’m here to keep him alive. I need your cooperation, not your disdain, Miss Adler.”
When he joins John in the sitting room, there are two tumblers of whisky waiting in John’s hands. John sits on the sofa, the place next to him open and beckoning. Warmth floods Sherlock at the prospect of invited proximity and he only hesitates when he catches John’s faltering smile as he spots the letter in Sherlock’s hands.
This means it’s time to milk the cow. And, given that Sherlock is still rebuilding his reputation after coming back from the dead, this is also going to be good publicity for him. At least, that’s what Greg thinks. So here he is at 221B Baker Street, trying to convince the consulting detective to show up on the big finale.
And Watson! He has
“Why did you never tell me?” John asks softly, so softly. He doesn’t want to scare Sherlock away from having this conversation. Because now, John needs to know more, so much more.
John closes his eyes. Takes in the faint sounds of traffic from the sleepy streets of Stratford.
Sherlock looks up at him, eyes clear and soft. “I will miss you, brother mine.”
Mrs Hudson glances at him, trying to decide how much to say. Not that she is coy about these things, but at her age, there’s things she prefers not to discuss with a gentleman. Also, it’s not really her story to tell, is it?
Greg laughs openly, and she joins him soon enough. There might still be a chance for a universe where Sherlock Holmes and Sally Donovan will get along.
The next morning, John sees Molly approaching one of his French doors, which are slightly ajar to let crisp, cold air into the stuffy, unused flat, and waves her in before she gets a chance to knock.
“Oh my god.”
Sherlock is wearing… not exactly
John raises a sardonic eyebrow. “Had enough?”
“There hasn’t been any appointment, John,” Sherlock replies casually, without lifting his eyes from the newspaper he’s tearing into small bits on the desk (John assumes a ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ at this behaviour for his own peace of mind).
“Ah, I’m terribly sorry, Molly, it was my mistake to bring up that model; it is indeed more adequate for male users. I’ll, um. I’ll just pack this up and leave, eh? Sorry for wasting your time.” John put down the purple dildo he’d been holding all this time, pointy side up; it was a model with a suction cup, and it now bobbed happily at them from the stretcher.
As a guard finally shows up to take Mycroft to a private visiting room, he steels himself. No space for sentimentalities now.
“I know you’re for real.”
“What? You told me to!”
“That is not quite true, now is it.” The quiet comment surprises Sherlock; he looks at Mycroft just to be met with an unreadable expression. “Although I do not condone your romantic involvement with staff, I can see that there is something…different with this particular person.”
The touch is light and hesitant and sends shivers through Sherlock’s whole body. John’s thumb asks a silent question over Sherlock’s left eyebrow. “The eye healed just fine, John,” is the reply. “The ribs too.”
“Unfortunately, someone found out about this and has threatened to expose me. I do not care much about my own reputation, but I am afraid this would reflect poorly on yours, brother mine.” Mycroft drops his gaze again to the floor.
Bill Murray’s house has the outward appearance of a quaint log cabin but is much bigger in size. The glimmer of a small loch is visible just behind it, a simple boathouse with a short dock at the edge. The landscape is dominated by hills and woods, and as the sun peeks shyly out through a crack in the cloud ceiling, the snow blanketing the idyllic view sparkles like glitter. It’s cold, and Bill hurries his guests into his warm home.
“I hope it’s okay to do it on a stretcher. I’d rather not have foreign objects on other surfaces. Sorry. Oh, it-it’s completely clean, I promise!” She giggled nervously.
“Not everything is visible,” John replies softly.
Once again, a person under his protection almost got killed because John couldn’t keep it in his pants. He’s disgusted with himself, shame flooding his guts.
Sherlock scoffs. “You can’t possibly think
The HPLC whirrs and hums as it draws and blends solvents, pushes them through a slim chromatography column, sends data to the connected PC.
It must have taken John perhaps thirty seconds, tops, to get to Sherlock after he fell from the stage, but to John it felt like forever and a day. He had elbowed and pushed through the crowd until he could get his hands on Sherlock and drag the man out of that hellish mess. At that point, John was beyond caring about appearances and possible murderers – it was clear Sherlock was panicking at the loss of control over the situation. It had all happened in the blink of an eye, from that deviant invading the stage to Sherlock’s fall. Seeing him being submerged in a sea of people prompted John to shake off his panic and go get Sherlock.
“I apologise for that comment on fucking half of the hotel. I was way out of line. I’m sorry, Sherlock. I don’t really think that of you.”
What constitutes a kiss? A close-lipped peck is not the same thing as a saliva-exchanging twirl of tongues. I am very much hoping for something resembling the latter rather than the former, so let us focus on this particular subtype.
“Maybe you should. So you, you know.”
He turns to Irene. “I’ll have a look around. Stay here.” Irene rolls her eyes but doesn’t answer.
It is Sherlock who breaks the silence and drags a chair out of the table. “Please, do sit down. I take this is not a social visit.”
what’s been troubling her. “Sally, he doesn’t hold any resentment against us. If he did, he wouldn’t have come here today when I asked him to. He has received a proper official apology, we have talked about this… we were all fooled. It’s water under the bridge. He’s probably forgotten all about it, the way he ‘deletes’ things in his head.” Greg is trying to not be dismissive, but he’s saying nothing but what he believes is the truth. Sherlock, ever the pragmatic detective, had made it clear he did not hold any grudges, as the web Moriarty had spun around them had been clever and tight. Of course, Greg also had lingering thoughts of guilt in his role in all that mess, but it all had sort of been cancelled out by Sherlock’s return from the dead, had it not?
“What am I doing here, Mycroft?” John finds they are standing very close, so close he feels Mycroft’s delicate scent and warm puffs of exhaled breaths.
that hadn’t lasted long – they were on different units, and Mary had disappeared from the radar after a few…trysts. The word around was that she’d been invited to return to England after a series of unexplained deaths in her unit.
Sherlock sits at a small table in a chromed chair, his hands chained and placidly placed on the table top. Mycroft sits across him and observes his brother: Sherlock looks pale but somewhat rested; he’s wearing ill-fitting prison-issued clothes but that doesn’t affect his posture, regal as ever. He has a blank expression on his face and follows Mycroft’s movements with his eyes.
Sherlock nods in return. “Yes. It helped. Thank you.” His answer is also quiet, dampened by exhaustion, discomfort, and sadness. He cradles the tea mug with long fingers, looks pensively at his cooling beverage.
“Sherlock has decided we’re not getting no sleep tonight, that’s what’s happening.”
A man – Mycroft – standing disinterestedly against a wall, scrolls through his mobile and doesn’t raise his eyes to answer: “Yes, wonderful.”
There is such raw honesty and vulnerability in those quiet words that John can’t help feeling a bit broken himself. He understands. He knows that, like himself, Sherlock is ever in motion, always rushing. But also like John, Sherlock isn’t running towards some higher purpose in life. John wonders now if Sherlock isn’t instead running away from those shadows that creep into the edge of the mind when it is idle, when the hands don’t have something to do, when the heart doesn’t beat that much faster.
John pauses for a moment and considers his answer.
Sherlock’s exclamation startles John from his half-sleepy, afterwork tea drinking. “What?” He looks over his shoulder to Sherlock, who has straightened himself from his microscope at the kitchen table and is grinning like a maniac at him.
“There’s space in the sitting room; you can have my bedroom, of course.”
“It’s not the same department, you won’t see radiology.” John suspects Sherlock is unwilling to cross paths with any personnel who might have been involved in his CT scan. Chances are very low, anyway – different shift, different clinic in the large hospital. “Short cab ride, and as I said, I’ll come with you.”
“Brother mine,” Mycroft starts cautiously, “you’ve really done a number on yourself this time.” He’s not here to berate Sherlock but he can’t help himself. The last forty-eight hours have been absolute hell for Mycroft and he’s not in a forgiving mood. “I have managed to convince the people that need convincing that this was not premeditated murder but rather an act equipollent to temporary insanity.”
Sherlock wants to laugh, because how is he supposed to answer that? How can he possibly convey to this extraordinary man the extent of how
“Fantastic.” John exhaled.
Sherlock halts in the middle of their living-room as John shuffles in with… oh. Oh! Before he can stop himself, Sherlock is reaching for the Irish Setter puppy squirming in John’s arms. “John! Oh!” He buries his nose in the soft chocolate fur and lays a hand on the puppy’s neck to avoid the worst of the inevitable frantic licking on his face.
Who is he trying to fool? He
Not all he
Mycroft chews on his bottom lip for a moment, and Sherlock spurs him to say out loud what he’s still brooding over. “I’ve tried to understand why he wants this information,” Mycroft says with an edge of irritation, “but all I get as an answer is that he is your biggest fan.” He finishes with a weary sigh. “I hate not knowing.”
; but Sherlock has learned a long time ago he can’t always get what he wants. So.
. And he’s in a delicate point of his career: he’s just been nominated for several Grammys, and he’ll for sure perform at the ceremony next year. It’s the best he’s ever been, and myself and the rest of his team want it to keep that way. Also…it’s not just letters.” Greg drinks from his mug, collecting his thoughts. “There was an incident last week with a flower wreath that was booby-trapped; it contained a small charge that exploded. Luckily, Sherlock wasn’t in the room when it happened, and no one got seriously hurt.”
“You were wrong.”
She smiles a bright smile. “Come on then, before you threaten my beakers or something. And no, I’m not ‘too kind’ — I do enjoy being your friend and lending you a helping hand.”
. In John’s arms, on the floor of John’s room.
Of all the barbs he has thrown her over the years, this one confuses her the most. “What?!”
He lowers his fist and turns his back to the door, doing what he does best: surveillance while his client is otherwise occupied. John clenches his jaw and stares out into the party. He catches Mycroft’s eye from across the room, raising a glass and taking a sip while staring at him. John nods politely back.
While the previous summer was mostly sunny with pleasant temperatures, this one is shaping up to be filled with thunderstorms and abrupt changes in weather. Sherlock doesn’t mind. He likes the contrasts, the randomness of the lightning strike, the violence of the thunderclap, the petrichor after the rain. He’s almost done with today’s chores minus the watering – there will be plenty coming from the skies soon enough; dark clouds loom over the characteristic oppressive heat that precedes the storm. He retreats inside with a handful of sun-ripe tomatoes that will become a pasta sauce in a couple of hours. As he finishes his evening shower, the skies open and drown the landscape in diluvian white noise.
“Easy, Sherlock, take it easy. I’ll give you some more painkillers, but you should try to eat something first.”
“The timeline doesn’t fit. He’s not our man,” Irene adds. “He did admit to sending letters but nothing gruesome.”
He needs to put some distance between the two of them, both emotional and physical.
John shifts from one foot to the other and clears his throat. “You can choose to be whoever you want to be. It requires discipline but. Yeah.”
“Look, Sherlock… can we make a deal?” Sherlock looks dubiously at him but gives a go-on nod. “I have paracetamol somewhere; you can take one gram now. But we’ll monitor for any signs of infection in the next few hours, okay? And if the pain does not abate, we
He doesn't, though. He's never been one to understand what the "right thing to do" is, anyway. It presumes the world can be categorised into "things that are right" and "things that are wrong", and Sherlock has seen too many crime scenes to fool himself with such categorisation.
The note of triumph does not escape John. “Did Sherlock ask you to fire me for him?”
In the end, all it takes is a cathartic hug. The admission that these are the only arms John ever wants wrapped around him.
And it was John putting the ‘ex’ on ‘ex-lover.’ He’s worn out his welcome in Sherlock’s privacy.
And when John stretches up and kisses him, Sherlock can only agree, as they swim along the current, together. As always.
. Molly’s boyfriend is Moriarty? John’s head is swimming, reeling with the effects of whatever drug he had been sedated with and this new information.
Unfortunately, her hip
Sherlock takes a deep breath. He’s given this same question enough thought. “What makes you think he was trying to kill Mycroft?”

Sometimes, he feels a hundred years old, as if the life he once lived weighed on his shoulders, left only with bittersweet memories and a shrinking future enshrouded in greyness. Yet, an undefined longing for more of the things he resolutely refuses himself intrudes his thoughts every so often: shared touches, laughs, tears. Companionship. Love.

Sherlock winces in pain as he rises from his nap on the sofa. His days are pathetically reduced to trips between his bedroom, the sofa (sometimes the armchair, when armed with enough pillows to support his back) and the loo. Right now, he doesn’t know exactly where he wants to go next: he woke up hungry, but the nausea quenches his appetite.
Because Irene Adler
a one-night stand man, no matter what gibberish the tabloids enjoy publishing. He doesn’t do casual sex. The level of intimacy that is shared isn’t something he easily accesses, either by choice or by design. It’s kept for those who catch his interest and, he has to admit, his heart. So John’s dismissal of what they had rankles him to no end.
Why are you so adamant on going out tonight?
Sherlock throws his duffel bag on the floor and collapses on the mattress, nose buried on a lumpy pillow smelling of cheap laundry detergent. Once, the rough texture of the pillowcase would have grated on his nerves. Now, it’s a welcome change from the park bench, his bed for the last four days while he gathered intelligence on a particularly notorious member of Moriarty’s network.
time?” He broke the handshake and flicked his eyes to Molly, then to the vibrator in her hand and back at her.
He knows Sherlock is alive.
Later, after the fire has died down and the snow has started falling again, as they lay in each other’s arms, John finally allows himself to believe this is no house of cards they are building together. It is not even the start; that beginning of it all was years ago, with ‘Afghanistan or Iraq?’, with a bullet through a window, with late Chinese and giggles at a crime scene.
John’s eyebrows attempt to vanish under his short bangs in astonishment. “Say
Coming back to London directly from Serbia, Mycroft thought prudent to have Sherlock staying a few days with him, before querying about the possibility to return to Baker Street. His little brother was still recovering from a very bruised back, and lord knows the extent of the mental damage brought by torture and captivity. Now, it seemed he might have to recover from more than that.
It should have sounded derisive, but Sherlock’s comment comes out with a hint of amusement.
“That is mostly correct, yes. I am a performer.”
Sherlock stiffens at first but quickly relaxes into the embrace as the water gently roils in the kettle. “I would have killed him.”
The wave of fury Sherlock experienced earlier today tries to wash over him again. Yes, he’s tested the soil because that’s what one does if one is invested in making the most out of one’s cultivation. He needed to know what pH he’s dealing with and whether it requires correction; if there’s enough calcium, phosphorus, nitrogen; if it’s sand or clay, coarse and rocky or fine and dusty. Something in John’s comment grates on Sherlock’s nerves and he is aware he’s overreacting, but good
“I… love you too, John, of course. You are my best friend.” Every word is carefully placed, his face attempting a nonchalant expression, eyes flicking nervously between an undefined point on the rug and John’s face.
Sherlock is heartbroken.
Sherlock’s body is muscular and warm under John’s hand, in contrast with his lithe movements and cool elegance. He doesn’t look away from John, expression soft and a gentle smile blooming on his plush lips, a curl bouncing endearingly on his forehead. John can’t help wondering exactly how he ended up having such a marvel in his arms, as the music drones on:
The silence of the countryside floats in through the open windows and embraces them. The spinning top loses its battle against the forces of physics.
Greg promises to try and get information on Brook, and they finish the call.

“Ridiculous! Of course he can perform, it was just a–”
And so, Sherlock feels that he has the leverage to try to pull John to the surface. ‘I cancelled your card.’ No response. ‘We can go later today to the bank to get you a new one. Or tomorrow. Whenever you– whenever you feel like it.’ Still no reaction.
Later in the morning Sherlock is brooding at John’s clinic waiting for blood and urine analyses results. John had refused to directly assist Sherlock at work, quoting the General Medical Council’s guidelines for maintaining a professional boundary between doctor and patient, and that their friendship was a bit too close to erode such a boundary. Naturally, Sherlock had disagreed but since John had been adamant about this point, he had no choice but to refer to his “official” GP, Dr Afzal.
“Christ, Sherlock. In how much pain are you
“Yeah.” John takes a large sip, almost burning his tongue, in hopes it’s a good enough answer to close the subject.
“Yes,” John interrupts, “but I made the mistake involving myself with my client.” He swallows thickly, avoiding Sherlock’s scrutiny under the pretence of searching for the second shoe, which he finds under the bed.
John gives him a sharp look of warning as Ellie freezes on the spot. She nods and resumes picking up her things in silence.
John clears his throat. “I’ll uh. Step out and let you get in the water.” He steps out to the kitchen as Sherlock slips into the bathroom, closing the door behind him with a quiet snip. John hears adjustments to the flow of the water, and then the splashing noise from the faucet stops; there’s sloshing noises and a drawn-out grunt as Sherlock lowers himself into the bathtub. Feeling a bit of a creep for listening in to his friend’s noises, John decides to put the kettle on. He’s definitely not sleepy now.
“And you’d give your life for me?”
love me too.” John knows the game is up, and there’s no backtracking his confession. There’s no way to go other than let this unravel.
John sighs. He finally turns to Greg and takes a good look at him. Sure enough, Greg’s cool composure has fallen away and his eyes betray unease.
“John!”
you…”
“I’m fine, just clumsy.”
“Oh, hello, you must be Dr Watson.” A young, smart looking lady stood in front of him. She was petite, with long brown hair in a ponytail, and she wore an immaculate lab coat, a name tag and a kind smile.
John’s lips curl up and he joins in the giggling. “Ha, I suppose it is, isn’t it?”
“John, sit down, you need to rest your leg.” Sherlock stares at the kettle as if willing it to boil water faster.
are the one who must be joking. How many more death threats must there be until you take your client’s safety seriously?”
Molly leans against the lab bench and drinks her tea. “Now. Do you want to talk about it?”
He thinks about the physical letter John sent months ago. Why is he still resisting opening it? He mulls over something John said, or rather let slip, when he was stammering his apologies:
, but he
“I saw her jumping out, though. A woman, you say?”
“Thought I’d acquaint myself with your work.” His heart is racing and he takes a deep breath to steady his nerves.
fine.
Sherlock finally seems to gather enough courage to look back at John. There’s sadness and hope and joy and doubt behind his crystal-clear eyes. “Four storeys high.”
Sherlock disappears into the kitchen.
“I received a text message from John.” She picks up her mobile, thumbs the lock code and opens her messages. She turns the screen to both men. “See?”
Sherlock looks thoroughly unimpressed by John’s reaction. “Left the road free for you to reconnect with that harpy that accompanied him. Who
There is no way Mycroft can contain this. There must be consequences, and he’s been hard at work to negotiate the exact extent of such consequences. He now has two alternatives to present to Sherlock, and none of them is good for anyone.
“What would be the point?” Sherlock straightens the chair and slumps back down in it. “It doesn’t matter.”
“He’s a noisemaker, he is. No chance of an intruder getting near the house without us knowing,” Bill explains.
“Was too,” Sherlock breathes across John’s lips, and closes the distance.
It’s a door that opens where one had closed a long time ago.
“Not sure if it even feels new, John. Haven’t we always been here?”
John frowns at the thickness of the envelope and removes its contents into his lap. He starts sorting through everything: photos of Sherlock from magazines and the like, vulgarities scrawled over his face; anonymous emails, some with only a few sentences, others with several paragraphs. “Did you try to trace these emails?”
John is clutching his glass of orange juice. He hasn’t taken a sip – he’s brooding, jaw clenched and fury rising. He knew better than to listen to Greg and be convinced to give this job a shot.
Mycroft slams a fist on the table. “Curse you, Sherlock, this

. Mary isn’t ‘some nurse coming in between them’, she’s his future wife, and has been nothing but supportive of John and Sherlock’s friendship.
John looks thoughtfully at her. “Has… Tom’s father shown up again?”
How arrogant he had been. These days, he can’t even imagine returning. Mrs Hudson was teary but understanding, claiming she would not rent out the flat
but held his tongue.
“I can’t think of a single thing to say.”
Button by button, clothes are shed, and reverent hands slide over naked skin. Teeth graze jaws and cheekbones, tongues taste sweat and salt and each other, heat builds between pressing torsos.
Mrs Hudson stares pointedly at him. “The problem with people like you is that you have no imagination.
“I… might require your medical assistance.”
“You are a figment of my imagination, therefore a part of me and thus, technically, you do know I am alive.”
“Obvious,” Sherlock interrupts and continues in one breath, “You worked as a security agent but your stance is military. You have a faint tan on your face and hands; could have been from holidays in a sunny destination, but your tan lines are visible under your cuffs and collar. So, not holidays. Conclusion? You were abroad doing military service, exposed to harsh sun while wearing clothes covering your whole body – battledress. It must have been a modern conflict zone with British presence, thus limiting the options to Afghanistan or Iraq.”
“He – he likes you, John. He’s not – look,” Molly hesitates, takes a deep breath, and continues in a more assured tone, “I can’t claim to know him well. In fact, I think only a few of us know him well. Mycroft, Greg, Victor…um, Mrs Hudson. But the rest is just staff. Me, Philip, Sally…we’re not important.”

John shakes off his shock from Sherlock’s frighteningly accurate analysis. “This is my disguise.”
John snaps to attention with a dizzying rush of adrenaline, pulse thudding through his body.
The two men look at each other for a few moments, the room filled with anticipation. John settles his tea again on the coffee table, gets up from the sofa and walks to the window. He crinkles his blue-grey eyes against the bright morning sun, still low on the horizon, while he surveys the treetops of Olympic Park. He takes a deep breath. “Seven thousand pounds a week. And a probationary period. He dances my waltz or I’m out.”
She steps in cautiously, a bit more relaxed. “Not Edison, then.”
This is not how John Watson works. He sets his glass down on the nearest table.
“Everybody in the house tries to control my life.” Mycroft and Lestrade and Victor, and now John Watson. And, while Sherlock has veto power, he can hardly say ‘no’ to most events thrown on his agenda.
“What’s wrong, darling?” Victor asks.
John takes a seat next to Sherlock. “Alright, Sherlock?”
“You make a fuss about not being my GP at the surgery, but then nag me endlessly at home to take painkillers.”
” Sherlock aims for irritation but is too worn out to have any biting bitterness. “I refused to listen to his rubbish any longer and left.” A sigh.
For the umpteenth time, Sherlock drags himself to the loo and slams the door shut. John knows what is happening next – Sherlock whimpers, curses, whimpers a bit more, flushes the loo, then there’s a minute where nothing else happens except hand washing and then Sherlock comes out looking green. Rinse and repeat.
He stops at John’s number and taps the phone icon. This is a break in the pattern they had agreed upon without actually having agreed on anything, but Sherlock finds himself too desperate to push away the tendrils of panic nearing his consciousness to care.
The slow drainage of colour from his life, pavement chalk drawings washed away by the rain?
John sighs. Now that Sherlock mentions it, John does notice his defensive posture due to lateral pain. “Alright, I’m sorry. Just ruling out kidney damage. Contusion or–”
wouldn’t notice?”
Sherlock’s bedroom’s door is closed, and muffled voices float from within. Quite distinctively John’s and Sherlock’s.
?” he spits, raising a disbelieving eyebrow. John flinches.
Sherlock peels John’s shirt off his torso, making him lift one arm, then another to slide shirtsleeves off; the movement is inelegant due to their positions, and John chuckles. Sherlock smiles; it could have been an embarrassing moment, this juvenile fashion of removing clothes, but instead there’s humour, lightness, tenderness. Sherlock’s never thought sex could be this type of fun, with giggles and playfulness. John’s shirt joins Sherlock’s in a heap on the floor.
“I forgive you, John,” he adds quietly. “Please stop beating yourself too over this. All the what-ifs in the world will not erase the past.”
Sherlock slams the glass on the worktop and glares at him.
“Alright, tell me more and I’ll think about it.”
“This is not new; it only feels like it.” They are a few short words, but Sherlock feels them hitting the core of him as an absolute truth. Not for the first time, Sherlock wonders if it’s not John who is the real genius here. This is not new, no. It started… when? Somehow, even if them as an item are a new thing, it feels like this had always existed in a plane of its own, and John and Sherlock had simply materialised into it, falling into the flowing waters of their inevitable destiny.
She finally sits across him, pours herself a cup, and takes an apologetic tone, “If I knew we’d have visitors, I would have baked something—”
The next noise makes his blood go cold – definitely something crashing.
Liquid courage. Interesting.
Two days later, a stuffed duffel bag unopened at his feet, John sits on the narrow bed in his small flat. Shoulders slumped, his elbows on his knees, John cradles a small crucifix in his hands. As he absentmindedly rubs the black stone with a tired thumb, he goes over a conversation which had happened just a few hours earlier but might as well have happened in another lifetime:
. How could I let them–’ John’s thoughts scatter as he sniffles, but Sherlock reads it all in the unspoken words.
The clock ticks well over midnight, and Sherlock has still not returned. John changes into his pyjamas, goes to bed and tries to fall asleep, but he keeps tossing and turning, his thoughts busy with his friend’s ailment. Of course, there had not been an immediate diagnosis after the CT scan – results are sent to the physician who wrote the referral as the scan needs to be thoroughly analysed – and so there is still no definite idea of what is going on with Sherlock. The kidney stone is the most likely scenario, though.
HPLC stands for
But I digress. John will kiss me tonight. The thought fills me simultaneously with elation and terror.
“You believe this location to be relatively secure. Is it because you have a good grasp of the floor plan and a view over the whole room?”
What is the worst thing that can happen if he grabs the olive branch?
, he tells himself, but the lyrics wrap around John’s brain. From his vantage point on the balcony, enshrouded by the darkness interrupted only by the low light spilling out from the room, he waits for the song to finish. He knows there are just the two planned, and a lungful of cold sea breeze and a new round of applause later, he goes back in.
with the peel!” Sherlock throws the knife on the worktop and storms out of the kitchen.
The man himself comes brandishing a gun and with a no-nonsense bark orders everyone inside.
Greg shakes his head and sets his hands firmly on his hips. “Sherlock, this is different. Someone tried to blow you up! John is an excellent security expert –”
“John told me you’re a singer.” Bill’s voice cuts through the silence and startles Sherlock.
Sherlock rushes in the flat in a flurry of windswept curls and billowing long coat. “John, you are
Mycroft sips his tea with a noncommittal hum and lets Sherlock continue his rant.
Ooh, John is unbuttoning Sherlock’s shirt, now this is unexpected (but not unwelcome). Unfortunately, it seems Mary and Mycroft are still in the room, which is off-putting, to say the least. Are they into voyeurism? Ew.
He turns again to his beehives and places a careful hand on a roof. 'In any case, and in the spirit of performing seemingly superfluous rituals that will in practice not affect the course of life events, I came down here to tell you, my dear bees, that I am about to go up in that house and ask John Watson to marry me. I… thought you should know. I'll still be the one taking care of you, no worries.' Sherlock gives a light tap on the sun-bleached wood. 'There's so much John is willing to do for love.'
Sherlock does not press. He waits, patiently. Gives a (hopefully) friendly smile back.
John answers after the second ring.
Sherlock takes the microphone:
but this time it was a tiled wall in a dingy ally, not the wallpapered one of Baker Street, it was a cold wall covered in slime and October rain, no smileys or bullet holes, there could not be bullet holes because his gun had disappeared, probably Greg or bloody Mycroft being his usual nosey self, thinking he’d be safer, the bastard,
The idea fills his heart in ways he hadn't known possible. He fidgets with the contents of a pocket in his trousers.
John pushes open the door to the restaurant and lets Sherlock in first. The door closes behind the cold London air with a soft
John has closed that door himself.
Greg and Victor exchange another guilty glance, and it’s Victor who answers this time, “There weren't any police involved in this. The maid removed the cover as soon as I found the mess and washed it straight away. It was a one time incident; we didn’t think much of it.”
“Molly, turn left on the next crossing.”
A few impatient shoves find John climbing into a rental car. Okay, so not a midnight walk in the centre. He becomes increasingly confused when Sherlock drives them outside London; a good hour later, they find themselves in a rural area outside of Harlow. Sherlock parks the car and they walk on a field, the night crystal clear above them.
Who knows if there will be a tomorrow, anyway?
The dinner flows easily with comfortable conversation, elbows on the table, silly stories from everybody’s younger years and way too much food. Bill and John try their best to embarrass each other with increasingly ludicrous stories from the army. Even Mycroft, usually composed and silent, is smiling with a glint in his eye.
Sherlock Holmes is
John’s mood also fluctuates, between the exhaustion of a toddler’s tantrums and the quiet evenings of comfortable shared silence. Except ‘comfortable’ doesn’t quite seem to describe those moments they find themselves in when Rosie is sleeping. There’s a conversation waiting to be started and both are too afraid to ignite it.
The kiss is tentative, a brief press of lips, undemanding and chaste. And, in John’s opinion, over too soon. He chases Sherlock’s mouth as Sherlock starts to draw back, and pours passion and desire into the kiss. Sherlock responds with equal enthusiasm, the initial hesitancy all but gone, the heat rising between them–
“Thanks, Irene, good idea.” Despite their mutual dislike, John and Irene have come to a sort of silent agreement where both acknowledge each other’s competence and try to keep it civil and professional.
Sherlock freezes, tea mug halfway to his mouth. A beat later, he puts the mug down and clears his throat.
The Land Rover follows.
Is this for a case?
, of all people, shunning him, hating him. Had his rescue been out of a sense of obligation?
John’s wriggling shook him out of his reverie.
“Maybe he didn’t hear your texts, with the hammering and all that,” Mrs Hudson interrupts hurriedly.
But it’s Sherlock.
Sherlock locks eyes with John, who seems to be gaining courage to say something important rather than pausing for dramatic effect.
, with
“Sherlock? You okay?”
“They collected evidence and whatnot but the threats haven’t stopped. Whoever is doing this is not afraid.” Greg takes a deep breath to steady himself. “Look, John, all I’m asking is for you to meet him, at least. It’s five thousand quid a week, man.”
, he realises.
John turns abruptly with a disappointed frown. “You must remember I told you there were things I didn’t say then. You,” he points an accusatory finger at Sherlock, “of all people, don’t forget a bloody thing.”
Sherlock slowly turns his phone to face John. John leans down and squints at the screen. On it there is… a recipe for spaghetti bolognese?
“That,” Sherlock huffs an ill-disguised chuckle, “was absolutely terrible, John Watson.” And with that, they are both chuckling, and the breeze feels a little bit fresher and the skies a little bit less grey.
“…You think so?”
Not for the first time in these last few weeks, Sherlock wonders if he isn’t seeing something moving about out of the corner of his eye. He blames the long shadows cast by the mid-July evening sun, leaves fluttering in the wind. He definitely does not think about how his mind is trying to fill a vacuum he had not wanted to acknowledge.
John is very aware his invitation to have a cuppa at his place after the restaurant can be construed as an overture. He is, in fact, not sure if it’s not one. While returning home,  John had gone into a state of hyper-surveillance that seemed to irritate Sherlock. He knows the man does not wish to be treated like porcelain but John is his bodyguard after all, and it won’t do to let his guard down just because they both felt like letting themselves have some fun. Together.
“Say, Mary, isn’t PA a bit of a crummy job for a Colonel?”
“John, Mycroft said you demanded all of Sherlock’s appointments this week to be cancelled. Is this correct?” Greg asks.
“He regretted the
“Oh, that’s just great,” John explodes. “Your own brother, and you blabbed about his entire life to this maniac! Damn it, Mycroft!”
The line goes quiet, and so does the house around Sherlock. But this silence is filled with the promise of
“It’s been years, John.” Greg grins and John feels them easing back into their old camaraderie – it had always been easy enough between them. “Last I heard, you were abroad somewhere getting shot at,” Greg aims for a teasing tone. “What happened?”
“Most definitely so. You definitely saw her
“And a good evening to you too, brother mine,”
John is taken aback by the question.
“I’ve ingested liquids corresponding to several volumes of the Thames, John.”
There are two chairs at his kitchen table. There are two chairs on the patio. There are two armchairs in the sitting room.
Sherlock places a careful hand on Mycroft’s shoulder. “Tell us.”
Neither of the men reply as Molly shuffles to the kitchen and quietly closes the door behind her.
As he gets up and walks to the door, he hears a car door slamming shut. One person only, then. Before they have the chance to rap at his door, Sherlock opens it.
To his mounting horror, another fan
“Oh, I see. You…want to go on a date. Discreetly. I do have to accompany you anyway, you must understand–”
The doors of the lift fling open and the first thing John registers is the absence of Irene Adler from her post.

He almost lost John’s friendship. In fact, Sherlock is not quite sure if John has forgiven him. Panic edges into his thoughts – what if John thinks this was the final drop?
“May I come in? Bit wet out here.”
“John,” Sherlock looks part exasperated, part bemused, and very much trying to not snicker, “do you really think Mycroft and I were the sort of children to frequent amusement parks?”
John is sure he will regret his decision.
They eat at one of the park’s restaurants. Sherlock orders fish and chips and John a hamburger and they end up picking bits from each other’s plates while deciding what to go on after lunch. As the day advances, more people flow in, mostly school groups and parents with young children, and while it is not packed, the place starts to feel populated. There’s less stamina for high thrilling rides after food, and the two men take a leisurely stroll around the park, drifting towards quieter areas. They’re never really far away from any ride, and the blend of mechanical sounds with those of merriment is a constant background, but they find a path that runs along the water and slow their pace.
He’s answered with an annoyed huff. “Do you really expect Sherlock to take care of such a menial task as firing staff? And no, I don’t leave the keys out of my sight, Mr Ex-Head-of-Security.”
Well. He had a general idea of how it could be. After all, there had been Victor back at uni. In retrospect, that relationship did not hold a candle to the present one, although it had been nice enough while it lasted. After their falling out, Sherlock had lost interest in investing himself emotionally to such a high degree. Simply not worth the effort.
back? He’s here; why not take the chance to make amends?”
Irene composes herself. “Is that why you tricked me and left me and Victor and Sally behind?”
Sherlock nuzzles his nose on John’s hair. They are spread on Sherlock’s bed, and John is idly dozing on Sherlock’s chest, arms around his waist. Sherlock has one arm around John’s back and is drawing nonsensical patterns with his fingertips along John’s spine and shoulder blades, which elicits contented sighs from his sleepy lover.
“It will help with the spasms, I promise. I’ll run it for you, alright?” John slides a warm hand up Sherlock’s arm, lands it on his shoulder and gives a reassuring squeeze. “I’ll even throw in my favourite rubber ducky.” He receives the expected reaction – a complete eye-roll – and gets up from the bed. “Do you need help walking downstairs?”
“You’ve probably never had a fun day in your life, Watson. Don’t you dare judge me.”
Then he looked like all Christmases had come at once.
“John. John. John!”
Which turns him proper alarmed. “Sherlock, what–”
He’s afraid of
“Sherlock.” John does not accept the way out.
There was that one time after the… incident with Moriarty at the pool but…
Sherlock narrows his eyes at John and gives him a once-over. He steps slowly forward and offers his hand.
The old lady who had greeted John at the main entrance pops into the room carrying a small pewter tray holding a solitary long glass filled to the brim with orange juice and ice cubes. “Here we are, Mr Ford,” she sing-songs.
, anyway. It is rather the intense, intelligent gaze from a pair of scrutinising crystal-blue eyes, now solidly fixed on him. Despite the business suit, something about Sherlock screams ‘superstar’ and charms the rest of the world into shaping around him.
“Are you okay?” Despite the nugget of jealousy, John wants, above all, to make sure Victor’s visit isn’t stirring old demons in Sherlock. He’s not expecting an answer other than ‘fine’, which is why he is surprised as Sherlock becomes more verbose than anticipated.
Sherlock paces the length of his living-room, seething. A mildly amused Mycroft observes him from the upholstered armchair, steaming teacup in hand.
He observes John’s evening routine after Rosie’s nap, with a snack and running around the backyard until she’s exhausted again, preparing her dinner, winding down to bedtime with a bath and a story. John’s voice floats from the study in the cadence of the children’s book Rosie demanded him to read. Sweet and calm, it reaches Sherlock in the kitchen as he preps dinner for the adults. This scene strikes him as so absurdly domestic he has to shake his head to dismiss the fantasy of a possible future.
here, and John is powerless to prevent an attack. Not the time to be distracted. The dance floor undulates to the beat of the music; Sherlock reaches out to touch teasing fingers to extended hands on the front row.
“That chance doesn’t last forever.”
“John. I am ever so thankful for your presence here.”
‘I know,’ had been the solitary answer, and that was that. Mycroft had left later in the evening, in time for supper in London, and Sherlock stayed behind in his small cottage with his doubts and memories.
“I mean,” Sherlock replies carefully, measuring his words, “if you find your job agreeable. If you enjoy it. Or if it is just a means to a paycheck.”
John leaves. Sherlock hears the front door clicking shut, a car motor brought to life, tyres on wet gravel. He’s alone again.
John finds himself alone in the hallway, stunned by Mycroft’s blend of dismissal and…propositioning? He shakes his head and puts distance between him and yet another confusing Holmes.
Greg gives him a long, weary look and says, “Follow me, will ya.”
Sherlock closes his eyes against the last rays of sunshine. He doesn’t expect John to contact him. Not after…
large,” Sherlock exclaims, obviously impressed.
“For what it’s worth,” John continues carefully, “in my opinion you were not well attended. At all. You’re not an active user, so there really is no reason to not give you an opioid for such severe pain.” He sighs. This is not an easy subject for various reasons. First of all, no one can evaluate how much pain a patient
Because that had been, in essence, the problem from the very start, hadn't it? Sherlock sacrificing himself over and over for a man that was bound to slip away from between his fingers. It was only when he had retreated to Sussex that Sherlock figured out he had gone the wrong way about it. When John had reached out through a (at first unread) letter and then a thunderstorm-framed visit, Sherlock had at last understood his path to healing could not be a lonely one, at least not the whole way through.
. “Just like you.”
Sherlock hands the papers back to the assistant and continues without letting John reply, “There’s no need for that. I suppose the extra bodyguard shall be useful when I go out. You work it out with Irene – I want discretion, not two thugs covering me everywhere I go. I need to
The cadence is almost sweet, the Rs rolled in an Irish accent. John’s head snaps up to find Sherlock still sitting primly on the edge of his chair.
His initial methodical approach to gardening and beekeeping gave way to a more amorphous relationship with the surrounding nature. Sherlock has come to realise a lot of his work is more about feeling what is right to do than following a strict schedule and predefined rules. He’s had to accept a new vulnerability to do so, bring out something from within himself he had tried to bury a long time ago, which has had its mixed consequences. Here is a tomato he planted while recalling a vicious kick on his ribs. There, a patch of herbs he sorted while
sliding down to near-
“Maybe she just wants a one-night stand and would leave you alone after that.” John ignores the clench in his guts as he suggests this. He glances over his shoulder to see a baffled Sherlock staring back at him.
“Does that need further medical attention?” Mycroft nods to Sherlock’s nose; he knows the question is unnecessary, as the answer is right before him. But he wants to break the wall Sherlock is trying to put around him, find out details of his reunion with John Watson. Obviously, things had not gone smoothly. As expected, really.
“Oh. You have it on you now?”
John laughs, claps both hands on Sherlock’s shoulders. “I’m so happy for you! We should send that for analysis, to assess the chemical composition–”
“Stop it!” John tears himself away from Sherlock’s manhandling. “It’s in London, why would I have it on me?”
“It’s about Sherlock.”
“Oh, I’m a last minute plus one,” she waves towards the man talking to Sherlock. “I’m his PA.”
“I’ll stay right outside. You’re safe here.”
When John looks back at Sherlock, he catches a fleeting uncertainty in his face, there and gone; Sherlock flicks his eyes at him, plasters on a put-on smile, and says, “Show time.”
Furious doesn’t even begin to describe John’s mood as he too slams a door behind him. The door to the suite, that is. He needs some air, and Irene can keep an eye on the prima donna.
He needs to answer those ‘what ifs’.
No wonder. The night is turning into dawn, after long hours giving statements and trying to make sense about the twisted game Moriarty played with them at the pool.
His heartbeat hasn’t quite gone down to baseline level when there’s a brisk knock on a French door. John stares at the figure of Sherlock Holmes against the morning light, straight as a rod and hands clasped behind his back. He stumbles to the door to open it, squinting against the sunny glare. “Sherlock. Is everything all right?” The question is polite but John’s voice is strained with guilt and the leftover adrenaline from the not-bomb.
Sherlock is not happy about all the commotion. On a good day, he huffs in disgust at the noise and buries his curly head into a pair of noise-cancelling headphones; on a bad one, he shouts at everybody, John included, to keep quiet.
They jog slowly in silence for several long minutes on the walkway that runs along the outer wall of the property. Usually, John would keep a few steps behind his client, literally watching their back and the surroundings. Instead, he finds himself falling into step side-by-side with Sherlock, and it feels so natural he doesn’t even think about it. While his background alertness is there, ready to burst into full activity at any sight of danger, John relaxes into enjoying this private moment with Sherlock. No words are needed, as both men sync their steps in silent agreement.
driving skills couldn’t be going any better. Molly is a fast learner, and she quickly adds several evasive manoeuvres to her otherwise defensive driving. John is impressed to see that in a pinch, Molly will be able to do rather complicated acrobatics, some worthy of stunt men right out of Hollywood; for example, she is now able to execute a smooth powerslide with the limo, something hard to achieve even with a normal-length car. They’ve also timed – and improved – how fast she can drive away after he jumps into the backseat, as one would do if the need for a fast escape arises.
The two men stand in the room, watching each other, the moment brittle and charged.
hurt.
Major Sholto these days?”
John’s hair smells a bit minty, a bit sweaty, a bit sexy. Sherlock still can’t believe his luck, that he gets to have this now, John in his arms, the assurance that yes, his feelings are returned. It had all started with an awkward conversation late in the evening that evolved into confessions and apologies and promises. And kisses, and more kisses, and hunger, and ecstasy, and intimacy, and so, so much love.
John smiles. The late hour is settling a blanket of fatigue on the two men, but they walk downstairs. John runs ahead of Sherlock, making a beeline to the bathroom and turning on the cold and hot water taps until the mixture falling in the bathtub is just a hair below scalding. He hesitates for a moment, then walks into Sherlock’s bedroom, picks up fresh pyjamas and takes them back to the bathroom, laying them neatly on a stool. He glances nervously over his shoulder and notices Sherlock has caught up and is hovering undecided between the bathroom and the bedroom doors.
They stare at each other, the air filled with unspoken things. The moment is there and gone as Mr Hardy returns.
“Something the matter, beautiful?”
John gasps.
He always takes the same chair, and the other gapes emptily as if expecting someone to come and claim it. But nobody comes, and that really is for the best.
“You are right. One does not do this to their best friend,” his voice is almost steady, but a slight tremor betrays his true state of mind, “yet I would do it all over again to save his life.” He lifts his head fully to look at her. “I would commit suicide for real if that meant he would live. If that makes me a sociopath — so be it.”
The man walks through the dance floor, deserted but for the bustle of a cleaning crew.

has he come to disrupt Sherlock’s peace?
“Ah, John. I was hoping to catch a moment alone with you.”
Something ugly and heavy curls in John’s stomach. He leans over the desk placing his palms flat against the surface in an undeniable threatening pose.
Oh god.

“What do you mean, he’s been caught?” John squints at his mobile, where Irene and Greg share the screen on FaceTime. How Irene’s looking fresh as a cucumber at this ungodly hour, he doesn’t know; Greg looks like he’s been run over by a lorry.
But John seems happy. He and Mary just got engaged, after all. He will not return to share his life with Sherlock. And it is all for the best, really. Sherlock came back with…
“Petting is good, pointing out that I am old is not,” John mumbles, “more petting, less talking.”

Sherlock rises so fast from the chair it nearly topples.

to go to the police! How is Sherlock taking this?”
The Westcott is an imposing Victorian building facing the sea, catering to a very exclusive clientele. John walks through the main kitchen with two of the hotel’s security people, the place abuzz with preparations for the evening’s party. Since he had been coldly informed that tonight’s event would be business as usual for the security detail, John had launched himself into mapping the whole place, planning and positioning guards, installing extra cameras (much to the manager’s chagrin; the man had complained about the equipment’s poor aesthetics and John had patted himself mentally on the back for not telling the man where to stick his aesthetics) and ensuring there would be at least three unobstructed escape routes.
“I don’t give a toss about grammar at bloody–,” John looks at his wristwatch, “half four in the morning,
Sherlock glances uninterested at the screen and back to the microscope. He changes to a new slide. John, standing in front of the stove, stiffens and stirs the pasta sauce a bit more violently than needed.
“Sherlock,” John cocoons Sherlock’s hand between his two warm ones, “you are not unlovable. You are not unwanted. You have tried to convince me for far too long you are not who I want.” He shifts closer, so close Sherlock feels wafts of tea-scented exhales on his cheek. “I heard enough; this ends now.”
Until there was. Because now, months after John moved back to Baker Street, months of rebuilding their friendship, months of growing intimacy and a bond stronger than ever, John has found himself (sometimes, just sometimes, late at night, in his bed, behind the relative safety of a closed door) wondering ‘what if’.
. John breaking down in his arms broke something inside Sherlock too; his sobs and tears drenching Sherlock’s dressing gown seeped through his still sore ribcage and pooled somewhere inside. On his birthday. The rest of that day had passed in a blur, with Molly and John taking him for cake.
“No, I mean. You
“It was regrettable, of course, poor woman.” Sherlock wonders whether he is being a tad too nonchalant about the whole ordeal but is it really a reason for all the paranoia? “Surely it is only a matter of more closely monitoring the packages we receive? I could even do that myself – it’s child’s play, really, and it would put my degree in chemistry to some actual use.” He sighs at this unrealistic thought, as clearly nobody in this household allows him near any sort of correspondence. Sherlock hasn’t seen a physical letter in weeks.
“So, is this a full service date, John?”
John just stares blankly at him. Sherlock sighs as he is forced to explain further.
Silence follows. Sherlock isn’t expecting an answer anyway, so he presses onward.
“I miss you, John,” Sherlock murmurs to the empty bedroom, to the John in his head.
knows John, as she had been all chummy and flirty with him.
He’s so distracted by his internal musings he almost misses John getting up from the table and rinsing their mugs and plates. He disappears briefly into the bathroom, and when he’s out again, Sherlock takes in the dark bags under his eyes, a jacket folded over one arm, and car keys jingling in his left hand. “Well, I’m off, then. Thank you for the…” He makes a vague gesture that could mean ‘tea’, ‘stay’ or whatever, really.
“Mr Trevor.” John doesn’t bother to sit down and Victor doesn’t invite him to.
Mary’s tone is starting to grate on John.
“Sherlock Holmes, get your arse off that chair and meet the man.”
John slid his hands around Sherlock’s waist, and explained, never losing eye contact, “Because I love you and your idiosyncrasies, you absolutely fascinating madman.”
“It’s
“Sherlock. Shut. Up.” John’s protest carries no heat — but the searing kiss he uses to quieten Sherlock does. John smooths his hands along Sherlock’s ribs, eliciting a shiver of pleasure.
And John believes him.
Sherlock sags beside him, sinking into the worn-out cushions. “He made advances on me. Was a bit…handsy.” His eyes don’t quite meet John’s. “But the important part came before we went into the room. Brook presented himself as someone in the film industry but from the projects he was boasting about it was obvious he was lying, otherwise I for sure would have heard about him before, and
thing. Tedious. It would only make John concerned, and he would pity Sherlock. Best to leave John be in peace and quiet with his betrothed.
Sherlock throws him a mock-scandalised look. “And you laughed at the whole situation!”
“Hooper. Molly Hooper.” She nods once and turns to continue cleaning the car. “Alright, go ahead, Mr Edison.”
Victor gets up from his chair so violently it tumbles with a loud crash to the floor.
Sherlock softly pried the vibrator from her hand with a serious look on his face. “You have no use for this one.”
Well.
“What happened now?” Greg asks.
“I am aware—”
It can’t be, it’s not possible that John wants…
There could have been multiple ways to finish this conversation. Sherlock, however, chooses the one that, for once, he truly wants, by closing the gap and laying a soft kiss on John’s lips. A kiss that is reciprocated, a kiss filled with promises, with
“He doesn’t acknowledge
“You’re scared of losing him.”
He shakes away the past and focuses on the man standing before him now. Sherlock is chewing his lips nervously. John realises he is about to do it again, to step back when someone has stepped forward, to recoil when a hand has been extended. John watches helplessly as Sherlock’s gaze turns cold.
John blinks, confused. “What do you mean, someone like you? Why would that be a problem?”
and the
“Isn’t there a way to make it move faster?”
A knot had unravelled in Sherlock’s belly when he saw John recoiling from the harpy. Not that it’s his place to control who flirts with John. After all, John had been very clear: a one-night stand, that’s it.
The aloofness, the coldness, the hubris. It’s all just a façade.
“Do you want me to help you out of those?” He tilts his head towards Sherlock’s lap.
John gapes at him, eyebrows raised in incredulity. Is Sherlock asking…
Suddenly, Sherlock opened his eyes and pinned John down with his sharp gaze, stopping his playing. John hesitated before speaking.
“It’s not that I don’t want to take care of you,” John replies carefully, “it’s just that someone might think it unethical. The last thing I need is a complaint to the GMC.” Sherlock huffs in impatience, and John decides to change the course of the conversation. “When is your CT scheduled?”
he feeling? He hasn’t tried to parse his own emotions until now but the fact is Sherlock is first and foremost, angry. Furious. With Mycroft, the shooter, this Moriarty bastard, the world at large, John for asking him how he’s feeling and for being so caring and protective, and the anger twists into wretchedness because
“That’s not what I mean,” Molly replies. “Look, John, I don’t mean to pry–”
Five minutes pass, then ten. John and Irene stand by the door while Victor buggers off to talk to journalists and admirers, though he casts a nervous glance from time to time towards the locked door of the dressing room. He’s delaying the inevitable: Sherlock’s announcement to cancel tonight’s show. John looks meaningfully at Victor every time Victor glances at the door, reminding him of his demand.
. Why did he have to flirt unabashedly with that repulsive Brook guy in front of him? Everything Sherlock did last night had been to provoke John, John is sure of that. He’s being punished for putting a stop to their…
“Oh.” John comes around the table and sets a gentle hand on his forearm. “Right, that could be due to a number of reasons… Are you feverish? Any pain? How deep was the colour when you peed? Any clots?”
sent. And we need to find that woman; we already lost too much time. John, find me a way up to the roof, we can try to find a trail–”
John notices the angry red marks around Sherlock’s pale neck.
Sherlock nods sharply and walks away, expecting the rest of them to follow. At the end of the corridor, John tries to steer him off to the backstage exit; instead, Sherlock turns in the direction of the staircase leading to the stage and dance floor area.
He’s perfectly aware that there will be consequences for leaving Irene and Victor out of his back-up plans.
This chapter is rated Gen.
“Yeah, I agree with you,” Greg says. “He’s not the type to hire bombers and assassins, I don’t think.”
The “take care of practical details” approach is visibly not working, so Sherlock decides to take a more direct route. He sits in his armchair facing John, who still refuses to move or make eye contact. ‘John,’ he calls softly. ‘John. Please. Look at me.’
“Why won’t you read the letter?”
It had been too good to last long. And it had all vanished in the blink of an eye.
It’s just that every day Sherlock spends trying to mask how unwell he is feeling, John’s heart breaks that little bit more. Perhaps experiencing three
of places he had performed product demos in. Not
Sherlock half turns and shouts to make himself heard above the loud music, “I will not let some maniac command my life!” He continues to run downstairs; John scrambles after him but Sherlock is agile and the staircase is filled with people. The crowd on the dance floor is expectant, as the background music had faded some minutes before forewarning of tonight’s real show. The club’s MC spots Sherlock approaching the stage and hurries up to the microphone:
John gives him a wider smile, one full of fondness, the sort that makes his face soft and open, and Sherlock aches to reply him in kind. Instead, he accepts John’s offer to do the washing up while he prepares fresh cups of tea. They retreat to the sitting room, and the oppressive atmosphere lifts and disappears in wisps, much like the thunderstorm outside gives way to a cool evening. They sink into armchairs, tea in hand, and continue to say nothing.
“What do they usually say?”
Not that he does it on purpose, he ponders while brewing a double espresso with his second-best beans for an exhausted biology student (obvious, look at her backpack and the mismatched earrings). While Sherlock enjoys his job due to its experimental nature and the unlimited amounts of caffeine, how is he to pass the time if not by trying to deduce his clients lives and habits? Making coffee is hardly an intellectual activity.
Because everything that has ever happened, and everything that could ever have happened, has led them to this point in time. And there could never have been any other way to end.
“I hope that, as my personal physician,” Sherlock drawls, “you could help me with that particular therapy option,” and there is definitely a twinkle of mischief in his eyes.
“Sherlock? Sherlock!” John collapses on his knees, drops his gun on the floor and reaches for Sherlock, who is coughing and red-faced but seems otherwise unharmed. “Are you hurt?”
His question hits the mark as she gives him a sour expression.
“She sleeps through the night, there’s no needs to tend to.”
Victor reluctantly releases Sherlock as his mobile rings yet again; he steps aside, still holding himself in the sphere of conversation but acting otherwise disinterested.
“Well, you never were much for the artistic types anyway, huh? You’ve always liked more practical people. Like me.” She gives an exaggerated wink.
In the end, it is so simple.
John allows himself a brief squeeze on Sherlock’s wrist, a reassuring gesture that says ‘I’m here,’ and leaves. He runs into Molly and Bill, both going to their respective rooms before setting up for the night; John will sit on a large lounge chair outside Sherlock’s bedroom door, cushioned with extra pillows and a borrowed duvet as a makeshift bed. Mycroft will sleep downstairs in the living-room; he had insisted the sofa would do just fine (allowing Molly to have the other guest room).
Victor has
John opens his eyes slowly against the flickering light of a humming fluorescent lamp and sits up. As he regains sight, he finds two human-shaped shadows looming over him, one in some sort of ridiculous ninja-like outfit, and the other in an expensive-looking suit. Ninja-man is holding a gun level at John’s head and is impossible to recognize as he is wearing a balaclava.
I am a scientist and will therefore approach the issue in a scientific matter. Research.
John clears his throat and replies in a clipped tone, “That’s my job.”
The mix of hurt, fury and happiness in John’s face is utterly confusing and, Sherlock thinks, wonderfully endearing. Probably because he is high as a kite. Likely because John is a marvellous mix of contradictions.

“Are you being obtuse on purpose? I said that spectroscopy can measure anything, not FTIR in specific. There are hundreds of different techniques covering essentially the whole expanse of the electromagnetic spectrum, from gamma rays to microwaves. Everything emits radiation of some sort,
Except… What is
It all clicks into place for John. He wonders momentarily if this is how Sherlock feels when he has just deduced something brilliant.
John sighs at the steeping tea, then lifts the swollen tea bags from their mugs and tosses them into the rubbish can. He lifts the tray and walks into the living-room.
“Not the front door? Irene was not there.” Which reminds John to call her and ask
“Er. Well.” he stammered but kept his cool. This was a bit of an odd reaction, but some clients were a bit shier than others; as long as he kept a professional tone, he could defuse any potential embarrassment. “This one here is ultra-soft, perfect for beginners, if this is the, um, case. Not too big, and very realistic. They come in a wide range of natural skin colours. Ah, this here is our best-seller in its category–”
“Holmes… Sherlock.”
If Sherlock had been desperate enough to call Mycroft in the middle of the wedding party to “remind” him to show up, it is no wonder he would seek his companionship later.
John keeps an eye on the proceedings while desperately trying to distract himself enough to not linger on the lyrics of the songs Sherlock chose. Is the man trying to kill him? He uses his work as an excuse to glide from one end of the room to the other, but makes the mistake of locking eyes with Sherlock mid-song.
“Yep!” John popped the ‘p’ proudly and proceeded to rummage around in the suitcase. He picked out some of his products, spreading them on one of the stretchers. “I wasn’t sure what type of product you needed, but I brought some of our popular ones. Naturally, our complete catalogue is online for your perusal; anything you don’t find, just call me and I’ll–”
Sherlock loves his private flat. Here, he does not need to don the façade of his public persona with all the interviews and recording and choreographing and more interviews, with the constant barrage of noise from his scurrying minions. He doesn’t know what half of these people do and he doesn’t know the other half
Richard is watching him, bemused.
Greg, in turn, groans softly, passing a hand over his face.
The click of the door shutting out his team sends a wave of relief through Sherlock. Finally, some peace and quiet. Well, relative quiet, as the rather obnoxious electropop now blares from the dance floor and permeates the walls. Irene lets in a couple more flower deliveries but then everything quietens.
Sherlock takes another bite off his spring roll instead of replying with the answer they both know.
John is completely baffled at this. “Did they give you anything to drink? Put you on an IV?”
“Good morning,” Sherlock greets with a sleepy, raspy voice. He licks his lips and coughs to clear his throat. “Sleep well?”
John clasps Sherlock’s wrist with unmistakable possessiveness. “Did he– hmm.” He closes his eyes and fights to keep his voice steady. “Did he touch you, Sherlock?”
“I liked the soundtrack a lot, some lovely tunes there. Was heavy on the violins, no?” John tried to coax some sort of intelligible discussion from Sherlock, whom had spent three quarters of the film sitting with his feet on the sofa, arms around knees, and in uncharacteristic silence.
Mycroft stares at him with an intense look; is it the winter light playing with his features, or have his pupils dilated just the smallest amount?
Sherlock’s breath hitches.
Mycroft extends a hand. “Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock’s PA and older brother. Bill Murray, I presume.”
Sherlock is
“Keep your money, Trevor, and stay the fuck out of my way. I have work to do. If Sherlock wants me out of here, he’d better say it to my face. Until then, it’s business as usual.” He spins on his heel without waiting for an answer and storms out of the office.
. It makes John think more of Ella Fitzgerald’s version than Frank Sinatra’s, velvet and vibrancy floating through the room. An enthralled audience watches and moves with the rhythm, eyes locked on the small stage. John can’t really look away either, and the lyrics wash over him. He wonders if Sherlock chose this song on purpose just to annoy him, and decides he’s being egotistical.
“Should we not follow the Land Rover and get the bastard?” Irene sounds annoyed as she also looks around, more alert than usual.
- pointless to grab whatever is wrapping around his throat, better go for the attacker, and
“Oh, and call whoever has the flash drive,” Sherlock says as he follows John into the kitchen.
how the easy camaraderie of yesteryear has turned into this insuperable distance. They’re half a metre apart but it could be kilometres or eons for what it’s worth. And in the end, it was John who tried to bridge the gap by showing up on Sherlock’s doorstep with no baggage other than the weight of regret and sorrow.
is in – except the patient himself. The pain scale is as useful as the capability of the patient to understand it. Second, not even medical professionals are immune to disinformation and errors of judgement, and in the fast pace of an A&E setting, things can get overlooked. John wants to defend his colleague but at the same time he knows they were wrong, and that is because he knows Sherlock. Sherlock, who had escaped a hospital bed while recovering from a gunshot wound to protect John’s life. Admittedly, he had been drenched in morphine, but he had not been free from pain, far from it. Sherlock, who routinely claims his body is transport and therefore any ailments can and will be ignored.
“They might get me instead.”
John puts down his tea mug. “There are things that are not quantifiable, Sherlock. Not everything can be measured with science.”
Molly bristled. “Excuse me, who do you think you are to tell me that I don’t have use for a. For a.
The kettle clicks off.
Then, there should be a slide of lips so that there is alternation between top and lower lip from both participants. Mental note: apply previous lubrication to lips. This step seems overwhelming; in which direction should the participants move to maximise coverage and pleasure? There is also no data on this, I need data!
He blames the adrenaline lingering from the mysterious Land Rover-escape. Also, the heating in the room is a bit too high to compensate for the draughty old building on a cold December day. Yes, that must be it. Nothing to do with the way those wool trousers smooth over Sherlock’s curves. Definitely not. He runs a finger under his collar, swallows again.
He wipes his face quickly, embarrassed at his momentary lapse of posture, and looks awkwardly at everything and anything around them except Sally. She continues, “Maybe try to keep alive for him instead, heh?”
“There’s a lot of history between us. With the whole thinking he was a fraud and whatnot.”
Yet, for John, Sherlock is astonishingly ready to do it all over again. John is holding the shards of Sherlock’s existence in his hands and slowly gluing them all together again, perhaps without having the slightest idea he is doing so.
Silence fills the space between them; there’s just the hum of the lighting fixtures and muffled noises from ICU activity but it all fades into the background while they gaze at each other.
The last few weeks had seen something shift between them. They have always been close, but lately invisible barriers had started dissolving. There have been more lingering looks, touches on shoulders, an occasional hand on the small of the back. More than closeness, there’s a blossoming intimacy filling the cracks of their broken lives. After so much pain, the change is welcomed, if not openly acknowledged.
Mary Morstan. What is
“Alright. Yeah. Yes, of course. Thank you, Sherlock.”
Sherlock paces the private room with nervous energy.
“Please do try and remain calm after hearing what I am about to say,” says Sherlock with obvious effort to remain calm himself. “There is something fastened in the engine and I am very sure it’s…a block of plastic explosive. And that’s where the wiring is coming from.”
“A one-night stand.” The words are enunciated as if they were poisonous and Sherlock would want to deposit them carefully out of anyone’s reach.
Sherlock continues to observe as the wide glass doors on John’s place are not covered by curtains. John is moving methodically through his living-room; he deposits some books on a side table, opens and closes drawers, then stands at the large French windows and looks out into the night and up towards Sherlock’s flat. His body tenses almost imperceptibly – obviously, he notices Sherlock observing him.
John sees all the unrestrained love in Sherlock’s eyes and must fight a new wave of sobs threatening to break from his chest.
Instead of lashing out, Sherlock deposits his tea on the coffee table and takes a deep, weary sigh. This day has exhausted him. He has no good reply, so he says nothing.
send you an explosive device. Miss Hooper took the brunt of the damage that time. What will happen next time?”
obscure or, more likely, lying. He would not have got into this party otherwise, and Sherlock knows almost everyone on the guest list.
“No worries, just finishing bathing Rosie. Got you on loudspeaker.” Rosie’s babbling becomes clearer, and Sherlock is surprised to learn how much her tinny voice helps to calm him down. “Did you decide to call instead of e-mailing? I hadn’t time to write you today, if you were wondering.”
“Don’t ‘Sherlock’ me, Miss Adler!” he booms back. “And you!” He turns a vicious finger towards Victor. “Were you ever going to tell me?”
As if on cue, a well-timed
Pushing away with one hand, holding on desperately with the other. The precession increases.
Perhaps it’s his imagination running wild, but he’s sure Sherlock is singing to him. John steps out onto the wide balcony and makes a grand show of unnecessarily checking the stability of the railings. Not a bad idea, he tells himself: they are ten floors up, and a fall would be fatal.
“Good evening, Mayan.” His sultry voice quietens the crowd down. “I thought I’d pop in to show you my latest video. Would you like that?”
“Bit of a sweet tooth, heh?” She turns serious. “Do you think Watson will try to shoot me if I come near Holmes?”
“Sherlock, stop. Wait, just. Stop. So, you, um. A date? As in, two people who like each other go out and have fun?”
Ellie takes this as a good opportunity to say her final goodbyes, making the men promise a visit to Broadchurch for a less murder-filled holiday sometime. John steps out of the flat to accompany her downstairs; Ellie notices then the staircase to the upper floor. “Oh, a proper townhouse, is it? What’s up there?”
Sherlock splays his hands over John’s shoulder blades and roams down his muscular back, slowing when he reaches the hem of John’s jeans. He hesitates a second, then continues his travel down John’s body and grabs his arse – firm, delectable, just the right size for Sherlock’s hands,
We love each other. We have said so time and time again, in so many ways. Love is an amorphous concept, a shapeless creature felt and incarnated in the big and small events of shared lives. As a liquid or a gas, it must assume the shape of its container, fill the void with its molecules, permanently in movement. John and I have been building this container for years, yet its contents were elusive enough to give it a name.
On their return, Victor phones John, tone frosty, requiring John’s presence in his office as soon as possible.
Sally seems surprised to hear this, but doesn’t answer, which Greg takes as a good signal: she is thinking about it, turning the suggestion in her head, looking at it from different angles. She is, after all, a fine detective, one that should be up for promotion to DI soon enough if he has any word to say on it.
‘I feel– I feel so
Sherlock gives a small nod and lets himself enjoy John’s steady and warm proximity. He allows it when John tentatively reaches for his hand and holds it between his own, a solid presence tethering Sherlock to the here and now.
Mrs Hudson had not meant to eavesdrop. She had simply gone up to her boys’ flat under the assumption they were out for the day, as usual. She’s not their housekeeper, no, but a little dusting and a little tidying doesn’t really count, does it? And so, Mrs Hudson had quietly climbed the seventeen steps (her hip was giving her hell today, and she had to move slowly), duster in hand, and stepped in from the landing into their kitchen.
A short, broad-shouldered man comes out of the front door and breaks into a toothy smile as he spots John coming out of the car.
Ready for boarding.
he is? When Sherlock had asked him to go out on a date, a tinny voice inside his head had insisted on reminding him of the dangers of attachment, on how it affects his focus on the work. On how, regardless of how much Sherlock gives of himself, it is always wasted as his partners leave when it all becomes too much. When
“Like oxygen.”
“Elementary. Look at the turnup on your jeans.”
And she is his friend. She carried for a long time a secret,
“I’m. I’m sorry, Molly.” John tried to control himself. He wiped tears with the back of his hand. “I. Wait, let me.” He picked a visiting card from a small pocket in his suitcase and handed it to her. “DSMT: Deus Sex Machina Toys.”
When enough time has passed for Sherlock’s bath water to have cooled and John’s tea consumed, Sherlock comes out of the bathroom dressed in the pyjamas John had left him. A fresh cup of tea is gratefully accepted, and the two men sit across the kitchen table, the lamp from the cabinets their only source of light. It’s quiet, the warmth from the bath emanating from both the door left ajar and Sherlock’s body, and John tries to not inhale too deeply. Instead, he asks quietly, “Better?”
“What the hell?” he says, incredulous. He sees Sherlock paying attention to some detail on the windowsill.
Sherlock helps half-heartedly with the search for the living-room bug but his attention is on his brother, who has gone pallid and silent and does not move a muscle from the sofa he’s sitting on. A picture, a very ugly, worrying picture, is forming in his mind. And so, when he finds himself alone with his brother and John, he decides to address the issue.
“Going to bed, goodnight Sherlock.”
They both stiffen and relax in unison as mutual surprise gives way to acceptance. The kiss is brief and chaste, but long enough to leave intent and taste reciprocation.
“Had to return to England because of politics and couldn’t really use the military rank to do something useful. Decided to start over with something easy. Met Richard and the rest is history. He has a use for someone with my skills.”
Despite the low light on the landing, John’s blush is unmistakeable. “Ah, it’s the second bedroom. Sherlock’s bedroom is down the kitchen.”
John shuffles up and takes them both in his left hand after slicking himself, his right hand smoothing over Sherlock’s ribs and resting on his waist. Sherlock gasps at the silky contact of their erections, his own hands stroking John’s hips in rhythm with his small thrusts. It’s slow and sensual, the way John rocks back and forth, his hand stroking them from base to tip. John leans in with a hint of tongue and teeth grazing Sherlock’s jaw, down his long neck, kissing his pulse point. He buries his nose under Sherlock’s chin, and Sherlock cradles his head, fingers combing suede-soft blond and grey hair strands, releasing wafts of shampoo promising a summer breeze and foamy ocean waves. John’s tongue flicks over Sherlock’s jugular notch and he resumes kissing up his neck until their lips meet again. Their position allows John to give longer thrusts, his breath puffing warm on Sherlock’s lips; he licks Sherlock’s cupid bow and sucks gently on the upper lip, then the lower. The kiss is achingly tender as John’s movements turn erratic and he babbles disjointed
Sherlock glares at his violin case and the window. He’s still furious: obviously, blending fruit to oblivion had not helped to release pent-up energy, and he’s considering drawing postmodernist screeches from the violin that would put Penderecki to shame.
John lifts his eyes to Sherlock’s. The room around them is still bustling with activity and noise. Sherlock stares unblinking at John, his piercing gaze establishing a non-verbal conversation John doesn’t know if he cares to take part in.
Sherlock is floating, adrift in pure sensation, higher cognitive functions disappearing fast. It should alarm him but somehow it doesn’t. John tastes like safety and home, his grip on Sherlock’s wrist firm and grounding.
He hates not knowing.
Sherlock also gets up albeit a bit more stiffly and shakes his head. “Not necessary, I’ll manage. I think the pain has receded a bit.” He bites his lower lip, suddenly shy and a bit embarrassed. “Thank you, John. It’s… you’ve helped.”
,” he emphasises with a sniff of disapproval.
John takes the bait. “As your personal physician, I will give you a hand with any suitable therapy option, of course.”
John is taken aback by the question. “Intentions? What do you mean?”
Sherlock interrupts his stammered apology when John starts grinning impishly.
John chuckles at Sherlock’s limpness, weasels himself from Sherlock’s grasp and disappears out of the bedroom, returning minutes later with a damp flannel. He wipes Sherlock’s torso in reverent slow movements; Sherlock looks up at him, unable to put in words the current of thoughts flowing through his head. John’s ministrations are tender, and Sherlock recognises this tenderness as John’s particular way to touch him: from the way he had clasped his hands with Sherlock’s while dancing at the restaurant, to his grip on Sherlock’s wrists, to this careful cleansing of his body. It is fascinating how this man – a war hero, a soldier, a physician, a bodyguard, all those things that make him a fierce protector – shows such gentle care for Sherlock, relishes undemanding in the afterglow, worships his body not as if he had just used it but rather as if it is something precious.
“J-Jim? From IT?”
“Likewise, Mary,” John replies, feeling anything but. “Surprised to see you here, I don’t remember your name on the guest list.”
elsewhere but that was all history, and frankly Sherlock didn’t want to know the lurid details about his landlady’s love life).
“Of course, you are allowed to run. But I’ll have to run with you.” John smiles at Sherlock. The morning sun breaches through the few leaves still clinging to the maple trees that line the path, and John is mesmerised by how the sun rays dance on Sherlock’s curls. The air is crisp and cold, leaving no doubt about the season they are in, but for a moment, Sherlock’s face is flushed like it had been kissed by a warm summer breeze, and John feels unseasonably warm in his clothes.
Another young woman shows up next to Sherlock with a wad of papers and a pen; Sherlock sighs and sorts through papers, scribbling a signature here and there. He looks distracted by the entire exchange until he speaks again, eyes still skimming paperwork. “I’m willing to accept the extra security if this does not interfere with the Work. I told you as much, Greg.”
“I still do. But I did enjoy just… spending time with you.” Sherlock flicks his eyes up to John’s and down again and fiddles with the spring roll to have something to do with his hands.
Even if things went spectacularly haywire between them, Sherlock is still in danger. It’s not about the money, it’s not about them. And while Victor is a literal tosser, he’s not the man threatening Sherlock’s life – he’s endangering it with his reckless behaviour, yes, but taking Victor out of the equation will not save Sherlock.
“Of those? As I told you, what you have in your hands is all from this last week. About two hundred.”
Greg looks guilty and doesn’t answer; Victor fidgets.
The man – Brook – has round brown eyes and laugh lines, dark slicked back hair, and is dressed in an impeccable suit.
John looks up. A comet shines shyly among the stars, so more visible here than in London. John smiles at the astronomical phenomenon but also at the fact Sherlock took them all the way out here to see a comet. “I thought you didn’t care about the Solar System.”
As John was rewarded with a smile, he leaned in for a kiss. And Sherlock reciprocated and kissed his troubles away, the day’s events dissolving into unimportant past.
Mycroft opens the door. “Good evening, Sherlock.”
My breathing has become so shallow it’s almost not detectable, my chest turned into stone. I am out of my depth, and she knows it. “I do not follow.”
Richard does not break eye contact until it becomes impossible to keep his neck twisted back as he walks further into the noisy room. Irene walks behind him, close enough to make sure Richard is in fact leaving the party. Richard meets Mary and all but drags her by a wrist, a confused look on her face, with Irene shadowing them out of the room.
Sherlock’s mournful whimper stops John in his tracks, just-boiled kettle in one hand and two tea bags in the other. John had been preparing their evening tea while Sherlock browsed his phone for news, e-mails, posts on his blog and the like, searching for a new case or anything to learn for future ones.
John stiffens at first but then relaxes into his embrace. “You shouldn’t have come here.”
He feels like he’s not quite in control and he hates it.
He opens a web browser and with a few clicks he plays a video on YouTube – Sherlock’s most recent hit,
?!” Molly was apoplectic.
“I don’t know.” He doesn’t know.

“Mycroft. You of all people should understand why.”
John makes a move to get up from his chair. “Maybe I’ll just go and see if Mrs Hudson has some biscuits–”
John is still here. He stirs awake with a groan. Sherlock feels a twinge of regret over making John sleep on the sofa – his shoulder will probably give him hell. They are not young men any longer. John flutters his eyes open and meets Sherlock’s. “Morning.” He sits up, legs still tangled in a sheet. He had stripped down to vest and boxers for the night but hurriedly reached for the rest of his clothes. “I’ll just— refresh myself and be on my way, then.”
“Dr Watson.” Victor slides an envelope over his desk. “This covers your fees until the end of next month. Take it as an incentive to remove yourself from the premises as soon as possible. Meaning today.”
John frowns. “Shouldn’t he know about them? Also, it sounds like you need the police, not a bodyguard.”
John’s hands are warm and golden against Sherlock’s skin, skimming up and down his chest, reading invisible braille in his chest hair, his nipples, his ribs. Now that they are naked, the initial urgency melts down, the moment turning tender and more impossibly intimate.
‘Backyard’ is perhaps a too-provincial word to describe the patio behind the house. On the right side of the patio, a small detached one-storey house serves as Mycroft’s living quarters; on the other side of the patio, a similar building is used as guest accommodation. Both houses have French doors running along a good part of the walls facing the patio; from his angle, Sherlock can catch a glimpse of whatever they might be up to in their living-rooms, although Mycroft is usually careful enough to draw curtains closed when in need of privacy – which is always.
John Watson will kiss me.
Sally shifts from foot to foot, a sense of discomfort filling her slowly. “Look, it’s none of my business but. He was in a bad shape after you left. And you let him think you were dead for over two years.”
“Believe me, John, from someone who’s
“No, you’re not. Look, I remembered something that might help. It’s,” he chuckles.
At that point, John notices a woman also striding towards him with a stern expression on her face. She moves, catlike, her figure-hugging black clothes making John think of a ninja – one with dark hair meticulously arranged into a bun, distrusting blue eyes and blood-red lips. Greg intercepts her and murmurs a few words John cannot hear over the music, but that has the effect of her halting her march towards him. She casts a contemptuous glare at John and retreats into a corner.
“‘Piss off’,“ but Sherlock is smiling back and before he can think better he’s adding “I’m closing in half an hour. Dinner?” Oh lord, why does he think John will accept?
, he adds in his head, “make sure the security is tight.”
John jolts awake, right hand flying to his holster and finding his Sig. He does a double-take when he realises the voice calling his name was not a dream but rather a disconcertingly alert Sherlock standing in front of his armchair and shaking John’s shoulder.
They share an intense gaze for a long moment, a silent understanding passing between them.
Greg is taken aback, eyebrows knit in a frown. “Shit, mate. I’m sorry. That was insensitive of me.”
“Come on, Sherlock, it’s important! You can’t possibly ignore that appointment. Call them and book a new one right now.”
is a bit of a misnomer. In front of him stands an impressive two-storey manor, built in an eclectic style but with a distinct Victorian flair. The ground floor is covered in French doors and a terrace runs along the top floor. Vines of dull green ivy snake upwards over brown bricks on most of the façade, blending the house in with its surroundings. The bleary sun staves off any dreariness such an austere building would otherwise give off. As John leaves the car, he takes in the scenery around the house: the front yard sports an impeccable garden with a green lawn and scattered flower beds, impossibly lively this close to wintertime. There’s a blend of aromas of freshly mowed grass and blooming flowers. Tall trees cushion the house all the way out to the outer wall, which is hardly visible through the tree trunks and bushes. The whole impression is of a cocooned castle, tasteful yet imposing.
John is surveying the throng when his mobile buzzes in his pocket. As he thumbs the icon to answer the phone call, he tenses, ready to go into battle mode.
Damn it all to hell! The samples are definitely contaminated — it will be next to impossible to make any sense out of these results. And the reason? All thanks to the ineptitude of a
He blinks. Blinks again. Breathes a shaky breath. Curses himself again. Takes another steadier breath and looks at John.
Sherlock frowns perplexedly at the trinket, then at John. “I’m not religious. God is a ludicrous fantasy designed to provide careers to–”
“I’d. Rather not answer, if you don’t mind.”
anyway.
The silver Mercedes C-Class Saloon rolls slowly as Molly drives towards Vauxhall Bridge from South Bank. For once, John gets to know about one of Sherlock’s outings in time: he wants to visit his tailor on Savile Row for a new suit before attending a charity gala. John had decided not to make a fuss about the visit to a London packed with Christmas shoppers or the gala. The gala will be a small event with good security, as several celebrities and high-ranked politicians will also be making an appearance. And the visit to the tailor is  spontaneous; nobody would know about it in advance, except for the shop owner.
Their shouting match is probably audible well outside the office but John is beyond caring at this point. He wants to leave this freak house and never look back.
They walk over the grass to Mycroft’s flat. Mycroft offers John a tight smile as he lets him in first, clicking the door shut softly after them. “John. Thank you for coming.” They stand in the hallway, the winter sunlight streaming in through French doors, casting sharp edges over them.
“Gosh, no, Mrs Hudson, please, no need to apologise. I’m the one with the surprise visits anyway.”
Sherlock hums a noncommittal sound, acknowledging Ellie’s pseudo-explanation. She sees how he knows there’s more to it, but nobody in the room wishes to continue this conversation.
Sherlock exhales an exhausted sigh, but gratefully receives a glass of water and two pills from John’s hands a minute later.
John carries a tray with two steaming mugs and milk to the sofa and gives Greg a reassuring smile. He hadn’t meant to bristle at his former colleague but the memory from being shot in the shoulder and invalided home from Afghanistan still smarts. He had enjoyed the exciting, adrenaline-fuelled life in the military; his medical education, diligently acquired during his years learning the ins and outs of security service at MI5, had landed him a place as an army doctor. He was often close to the action, always ready to intervene at a moment’s notice. It had been in Helmand that John met Major James Sholto after being assigned to his unit all those years ago.
